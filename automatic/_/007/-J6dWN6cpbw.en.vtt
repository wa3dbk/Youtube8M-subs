00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:26.320
 how to use the spotify premium version does not 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.539
 It's quite the prize version but it's the 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.189
 tablet will give you some good access 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:33.100
 interesting 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:35.200
 first, for those who do not know the 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.810
 spotify is a streaming 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:41.170
 music you can listen to music where you 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:42.400
 you just want to use them all together for 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.680
 Internet 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:47.590
 So let's go to you who already know the 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:50.470
 application will see that it is not possible 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:55.680
 in the device version you click on a 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:59.050
 music and play it only works in order 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.390
 in random order then this is a 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:04.590
 What bothers you is our partner. 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:07.780
 reinaldo lopes nac the moderator of the site 

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:08.800
 left this tip here for us then with 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.050
 that works 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:13.030
 we'll need to do ruth 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:16.470
 this same process works 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:20.260
 Come on, I have to have the ex-wife of 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:22.540
 installed is that this application he 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:24.790
 is an application that needs ruth 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.590
 link him the tutorial to use I 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:29.050
 I'll leave it in the description. 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:31.900
 so I'm going to open my 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:36.220
 files and I'm going to install this application 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:39.670
 alone here're the tablet is that metrics 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:42.550
 Make them, he'll leave my cell phone. 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:45.070
 with the same functions your tablet has 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:46.600
 that when I use spotify on the tablet it 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:50.020
 have that version of choosing any 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:53.650
 music to play so I'll install it 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:55.840
 the April to install and install here 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:59.790
 on top of the ex-wife who already gave a warning 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:02.140
 which has been installed but is not enabled 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.200
 or click here 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.829
 the module 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.539
 the former Italian wife tablet metrics is 

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:11.690
 What are you going to do? 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:14.120
 the former little spotify function normally 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.459
 It's not for me to select any song. 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.410
 so it will activate and here on the side and he 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:20.330
 warn me already that will only work this 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:25.120
 after restarting the device 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:25.120
 It's okay, I'm going to hang up and call again. 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:34.220
 Good, my phone has already called here. 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:37.340
 so I'm going to open spotify already with that 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:39.260
 installed, and I'm going to 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.980

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.980

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.360

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:53.030
 to place the music to play the 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:55.250
 I put any song to play from 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.769
 The way that I think it's best 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.660
