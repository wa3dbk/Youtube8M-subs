conjunction with the front cap to reduce
aerodynamic<00:00:24.180> drag<00:00:24.750> it's<00:00:25.619> quite<00:00:25.860> a<00:00:25.890> design

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
aerodynamic drag it's quite a design

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.850 
aerodynamic drag it's quite a design
oh<00:00:26.520> and<00:00:26.970> first<00:00:27.270> glance<00:00:27.540> these<00:00:28.380> just<00:00:28.590> look<00:00:28.710> like

curved radius step and when you step on

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:04.550 
curved radius step and when you step on
them<00:04:03.090> it<00:04:03.269> has<00:04:03.420> a<00:04:03.450> much<00:04:03.660> deeper<00:04:03.959> stepping

also a very unique feature not found on
other<00:04:35.910> fifth<00:04:36.210> wheels<00:04:36.450> and<00:04:36.660> that<00:04:37.230> is<00:04:37.350> the

other fifth wheels and that is the
selector<00:04:37.950> balance<00:04:38.340> which<00:04:39.180> you<00:04:39.300> can<00:04:39.450> do<00:04:39.570> with

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:39.690 
selector balance which you can do with

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:41.830 
selector balance which you can do with
these<00:04:39.780> valves<00:04:40.320> is<00:04:40.770> operate<00:04:41.310> the<00:04:41.460> slides

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:41.840 
these valves is operate the slides

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.060 
these valves is operate the slides
independently<00:04:42.840> let's<00:04:43.260> say<00:04:43.410> you<00:04:43.470> pull<00:04:43.770> into<00:04:44.040> a

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:44.070 
independently let's say you pull into a

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:45.980 
independently let's say you pull into a
truck<00:04:44.370> stop<00:04:44.640> you<00:04:45.090> want<00:04:45.180> to<00:04:45.300> run<00:04:45.480> back<00:04:45.690> and<00:04:45.720> get

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:45.990 
truck stop you want to run back and get

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:47.270 
truck stop you want to run back and get
something<00:04:46.230> out<00:04:46.440> of<00:04:46.500> the<00:04:46.620> refrigerator<00:04:46.740> and

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 
something out of the refrigerator and

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.610 
something out of the refrigerator and
you<00:04:47.340> only<00:04:47.490> want<00:04:47.760> to<00:04:47.820> open<00:04:48.120> one<00:04:48.270> slide<00:04:48.660> all<00:04:49.380> you

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620 
you only want to open one slide all you

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:51.050 
you only want to open one slide all you
have<00:04:49.740> to<00:04:49.830> do<00:04:49.950> is<00:04:50.040> adjust<00:04:50.130> the<00:04:50.460> valve<00:04:50.670> push<00:04:51.030> a

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
have to do is adjust the valve push a

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:53.410 
have to do is adjust the valve push a
button<00:04:51.330> and<00:04:51.570> just<00:04:51.960> that<00:04:52.140> slide<00:04:52.500> operates

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:53.420 
button and just that slide operates

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:55.820 
button and just that slide operates
another<00:04:54.420> nice<00:04:54.660> feature<00:04:54.900> on<00:04:55.140> the<00:04:55.230> Everest<00:04:55.470> is

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:55.830 
another nice feature on the Everest is

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:57.950 
another nice feature on the Everest is
the<00:04:56.010> manual<00:04:56.430> override<00:04:56.790> and<00:04:57.480> the<00:04:57.570> reason<00:04:57.870> you

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960 
the manual override and the reason you

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.330 
the manual override and the reason you
would<00:04:58.050> need<00:04:58.230> that<00:04:58.440> is<00:04:58.650> if<00:04:58.830> you<00:04:58.920> had<00:04:59.010> a<00:04:59.070> full

00:04:59.330 --> 00:04:59.340 
would need that is if you had a full

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:02.570 
would need that is if you had a full
electrical<00:04:59.970> failure<00:05:00.360> both<00:05:00.540> 12<00:05:00.930> volts<00:05:01.290> and<00:05:01.580> 110

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580 
electrical failure both 12 volts and 110

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:04.640 
electrical failure both 12 volts and 110
volts<00:05:02.880> you<00:05:03.150> can<00:05:03.330> still<00:05:03.660> operate<00:05:04.200> your<00:05:04.320> slides

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:04.650 
volts you can still operate your slides

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:06.410 
volts you can still operate your slides
it's<00:05:04.950> very<00:05:05.160> simple<00:05:05.550> all<00:05:05.760> you<00:05:06.120> need<00:05:06.270> is<00:05:06.390> a

to<00:05:39.510> be<00:05:39.600> right<00:05:39.900> where<00:05:40.320> it<00:05:40.440> belongs<00:05:40.470> and<00:05:41.190> they've

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:41.580 
to be right where it belongs and they've

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:43.580 
to be right where it belongs and they've
also<00:05:41.760> added<00:05:42.060> a<00:05:42.210> few<00:05:42.360> things<00:05:42.660> that<00:05:43.260> I<00:05:43.380> don't

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:43.590

the competition only has one like I said
earlier<00:05:59.700> it's<00:05:59.880> the<00:06:00.000> little<00:06:00.210> things<00:06:00.420> that<00:06:00.510> make

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:00.720 
earlier it's the little things that make

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:02.480 
earlier it's the little things that make
a<00:06:00.750> big<00:06:00.870> difference<00:06:01.050> on<00:06:01.590> the<00:06:01.890> outside<00:06:02.220> of<00:06:02.340> your

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:02.490 
a big difference on the outside of your

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:04.550 
a big difference on the outside of your
coach<00:06:02.670> you'll<00:06:02.880> also<00:06:03.030> find<00:06:03.360> a<00:06:03.510> 110<00:06:03.990> volt<00:06:04.020> outlet

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:04.560 
coach you'll also find a 110 volt outlet

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:07.610 
coach you'll also find a 110 volt outlet
and<00:06:04.880> an<00:06:05.880> output<00:06:06.330> for<00:06:06.780> your<00:06:06.870> video<00:06:07.140> signal<00:06:07.590> from

take a television from the inside and

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:14.960 
take a television from the inside and
move<00:06:11.190> it<00:06:11.310> to<00:06:11.400> the<00:06:11.520> outside<00:06:13.400> if<00:06:14.400> you're<00:06:14.580> like<00:06:14.760> me

one<00:06:23.500> thing<00:06:23.680> I<00:06:23.770> really<00:06:24.130> like<00:06:24.280> about<00:06:24.310> the

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:24.700 
one thing I really like about the

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:26.580 
one thing I really like about the
Everest<00:06:24.970> are<00:06:25.210> the<00:06:25.390> windows<00:06:25.750> you<00:06:25.990> can<00:06:26.260> get<00:06:26.500> them

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:26.590 
Everest are the windows you can get them

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:29.430 
Everest are the windows you can get them
in<00:06:26.710> two<00:06:26.920> styles<00:06:27.430> single<00:06:28.090> pane<00:06:28.330> or<00:06:28.690> double<00:06:29.230> pane

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:29.440 
in two styles single pane or double pane

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:31.350 
in two styles single pane or double pane
I'm<00:06:30.040> really<00:06:30.370> interested<00:06:30.730> in<00:06:30.790> the<00:06:30.850> double<00:06:31.150> pane

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:31.360 
I'm really interested in the double pane

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:33.150 
I'm really interested in the double pane
because<00:06:31.720> of<00:06:31.870> the<00:06:31.930> thermal<00:06:32.140> insulation<00:06:32.680> value

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:33.160 
because of the thermal insulation value

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:35.850 
because of the thermal insulation value
their<00:06:33.910> deep<00:06:34.240> tinted<00:06:34.810> safety<00:06:35.260> glass<00:06:35.530> and

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:35.860 
their deep tinted safety glass and

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:37.770 
their deep tinted safety glass and
what's<00:06:36.250> really<00:06:36.430> nice<00:06:36.610> about<00:06:36.670> that<00:06:36.970> is<00:06:37.390> that<00:06:37.630> on

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:37.780 
what's really nice about that is that on

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:39.720 
what's really nice about that is that on
those<00:06:37.900> hot<00:06:38.170> days<00:06:38.410> when<00:06:38.980> the<00:06:39.100> Sun<00:06:39.280> is<00:06:39.400> pouring

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:39.730 
those hot days when the Sun is pouring

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:41.790 
those hot days when the Sun is pouring
into<00:06:39.880> your<00:06:40.030> coach<00:06:40.240> it<00:06:40.660> keeps<00:06:40.900> things<00:06:41.110> nice<00:06:41.440> and

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:41.800 
into your coach it keeps things nice and

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:44.970 
into your coach it keeps things nice and
cool<00:06:42.210> and<00:06:43.210> not<00:06:44.020> only<00:06:44.170> that<00:06:44.410> all<00:06:44.650> of<00:06:44.860> the
