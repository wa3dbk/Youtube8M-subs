pretty good spot but now well okay so

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.969 
pretty good spot but now well okay so
now<00:01:02.070> i<00:01:02.100> have<00:01:02.160> already<00:01:02.489> got<00:01:02.670> a<00:01:02.699> problem<00:01:03.680> it's<00:01:04.680> to

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
now i have already got a problem it's to

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.149 
now i have already got a problem it's to
the<00:01:05.250> bars<00:01:05.430> too<00:01:05.640> fat

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.370 

so<00:01:08.789> I<00:01:09.060> guess<00:01:09.659> that's<00:01:09.780> why<00:01:09.960> they<00:01:10.049> give<00:01:10.200> you<00:01:10.259> this

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
so I guess that's why they give you this

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:16.090 
so I guess that's why they give you this
guy<00:01:10.590> this<00:01:11.280> little<00:01:13.429> spacer<00:01:14.450> so<00:01:15.450> what<00:01:15.569> I<00:01:15.630> do<00:01:15.719> is

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
guy this little spacer so what I do is

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:21.649 
guy this little spacer so what I do is
unscrew<00:01:17.960> this<00:01:18.960> and<00:01:19.590> then<00:01:20.060> take<00:01:21.060> out<00:01:21.179> that<00:01:21.359> fit

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
unscrew this and then take out that fit

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.069 
unscrew this and then take out that fit
maybe<00:01:22.530> we'll<00:01:22.679> stick<00:01:22.950> this<00:01:23.100> piece<00:01:23.369> in<00:01:23.579> there

00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:24.079 
maybe we'll stick this piece in there

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:31.990 
maybe we'll stick this piece in there
then<00:01:25.079> maybe<00:01:25.229> that'll<00:01:25.500> give<00:01:25.740> me<00:01:26.719> more<00:01:29.569> what

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
then maybe that'll give me more what

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.660 
then maybe that'll give me more what
does<00:01:33.000> it<00:01:33.090> make<00:01:33.209> him<00:01:34.579> make<00:01:35.579> a<00:01:35.640> bit<00:01:35.880> of<00:01:35.909> sense
