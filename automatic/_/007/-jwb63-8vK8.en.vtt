00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:12.330
 cultural nerds are welcome 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.950
 again we will then continue here 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.089
 with the tutorial on how to draw a 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.430
 million ne 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:23.130
 the faithful or perhaps not even so faithful 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:25.260
 agents to cribs faithful of the group 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.750
 My favorite evil film is the highlight 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.910
 It's up to me, the second 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.539
 movie I watched was hilarious it was a lot 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.430
 good 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.190
 the stronger participation of boys 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.840
 nec we love them so as O 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.070
 unless you want I will not complain that 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.140
 depending on corn or something of the genus 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.629
 I like them and I want more of them. 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.460
 I would only have a movie with them then 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.010
 after it has already stipulated this first 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.760
 form york was a ball and found 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.010
 down 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.309
 we make a line under that one 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.260
 will be the control of his clothes to 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.230
 People pull the braces and the 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.120
 Pouches then raining if you do 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.840
 a double singer in this line already creates a 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.400
 stitch effect and there and the 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.810
 bag in various formats but what 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.170
 matter is that in the middle of it also you 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.570
 you can add the logo nothing depending 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.610
 of the membership that will be in the moment 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:18.150
 would be the group that he injected into the 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:20.970
 cool square are his feet 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.549
 underneath it means the legs and 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:27.570
 side almost touching the ground we have 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:29.250
 the arms and the mitts that have the hand 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.250
 remember that boys have only 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.380
 three rounded fingers in his hands 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.909
 looks quite like the announced courage 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.510
 or bial in soccer are good 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:41.490
 interesting 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:42.510
 She speaks the interesting word. 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.210
 favorite 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:47.750
 so I made a different position there 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.790
 has such a stupid stance and 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.950
 under the feet of that part of the 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.950
 Tight your feet with your shoe 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:58.710
 of him that allied the head in the proportion but 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.030
 no problem just to increase and 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.090
 leave it any way you want 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.350
 the shoe in a single line that you have 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.480
 how to put there 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.490
 The cool thing about wines is that you 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:10.560
 structure and clothing and body you 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:12.780
 can do now any way you can 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.570
 want to just stretch it up a bit or 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.710
 down from a stretched found that 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:20.640
 you have how to do 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:26.130
 the cab and all the other children there then 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:27.630
 we will delete this line of the 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.700
 ball that we initially did 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:33.060
 will change exactly the 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.590
 Smile of our minimum and a little bit 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.330
 further you can choose how many 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.940
 eyes we will want because the 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:41.340
 boys in various versions, I do not like 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:47.280
 union with the michael style eye 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:50.400
 schalk million then its always your 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:59.100
 glasses that is attached to the head with a 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:03:00.810
 thick strip of leather I made there and the 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:03.120
 corn with two eyes would be the same thing 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:06.060
 only that the glasses are fused there in the 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:08.330
 half of them are not two balls 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.330
 many different 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:14.280
 once you've done little eyes there 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:15.900
 just make them or the hair 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.000
 also with it you can choose your 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.230
 style is not having a hair 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.239
 espetadinho your hair that the match 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:23.250
 in the middle you can choose anyone 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:25.110
 of billions of hair, what matters is that 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.640
 you need this basic structure for 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.480
 low of any me what you 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.350

 So we have the wife there. 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:37.260
 Glitter ball and now it's just you 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:39.269
