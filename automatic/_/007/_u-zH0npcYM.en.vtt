00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:08.099
 good morning my good night my name is edson 

00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:12.450
 I'm better known on the internet as vw 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:15.780
 golf and mst 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:19.920
 I'm here in Sorocaba the purpose of this 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:23.430
 video is to show the behavior of my 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:26.990
 golf on uneven floors 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:31.970
 I will evaluate and the retention of gears 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:31.970
 the noise of the sg of the suspension 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:39.469
 this is my golf one golf 1.4 dsg 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:49.760
 then the test will basically be in this 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:53.480
 street here is a cobblestone street 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.480
 with some ripples 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.940
 the idea of about three or four laps 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:03.140
 on this street here there is no parallel here gives 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:07.530
 of the marginal for those who know sorocaba 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:11.340
 so it's a little busy then it goes 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:13.799
 Give it to make the test legal, and I'll do it. 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:20.100
 the echo mode test that the way it has 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:21.860
 given more trouble and I'm going to make a 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.540
 slow back 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.350
 there for the first time 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.140
 Monday 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:31.170
 perhaps second to third after 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:34.009
 a little faster on picking up 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:38.450
 third to fourth and what is expected is 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:40.869
 retention in the body 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.869
 and 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.840
 who exchanges gears there 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:54.460
 around 2000 maximum rotations in 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:59.979
 who have only complained and who limit the 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:02:01.780
 marches at 3 4 thousand rotations and then I 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:06.430
 I'm going to put the camera on the side 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:08.590
 from outside trying to get the exchange here 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:10.450
 on the left side 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:15.250
 I think it's easier to listen with the 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:16.690
 open windows and the suspension test 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.040
 then I think it's best to close the windows 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.450
 I think you can see the 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:27.660
 interior 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:32.230
 so come on it 's getting dark 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:34.680
 I did a previous video already but not 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.680
 It worked very well 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:46.510
 come on go and start the car 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:10.370
 so I 'll test or turn off the air 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:13.490
 conditioning or turn off the sound for those who 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:17.680
 knows the golf he knows that in eco mode 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:17.680
 I'll put it here in eco mode 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:30.940
 in echo mode it appears in place of pl 1 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:32.950
 and in an indication of the march 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:38.050
 can not really beat the test by placing a 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:40.120
 manual mode because it appeared only 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:44.020
 number and appreciated then it will be a test 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:45.700
 echo mode is that the mode that happens most 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:47.410
 a problem 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:55.120
 so let's go and ask him to put the 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:04:02.880
 belt trying to leave the light on here 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:02.880
 inside is better then come on 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:14.690
 it was not night and nice and 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:22.889
 to like new headlights is cool to me 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:24.780
 car is almost six months old is one of the 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:28.650
 first goals are with eight thousand 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:32.460
 five hundred and ninety two kilometers 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:37.220
 besides the contribution of the xenon headlight here 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:37.220
 Now that connects not adjusted automatically 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:44.960
 there was
