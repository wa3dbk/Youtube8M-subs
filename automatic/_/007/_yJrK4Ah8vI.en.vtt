00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
specifically her arc across these two

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.240 
specifically her arc across these two
movies<00:03:00.970> is<00:03:01.270> immense<00:03:01.600> i<00:03:01.840> think<00:03:02.440> the<00:03:02.650> the<00:03:02.680> thing

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
movies is immense i think the the thing

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.400 
movies is immense i think the the thing
that<00:03:03.459> was<00:03:03.640> probably<00:03:03.910> most<00:03:04.180> exciting<00:03:04.989> to<00:03:05.230> me

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
that was probably most exciting to me

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.550 
that was probably most exciting to me
was<00:03:05.650> was<00:03:06.550> using<00:03:07.150> different<00:03:07.660> directors<00:03:08.200> for

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
was was using different directors for

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.949 
was was using different directors for
for<00:03:08.980> each<00:03:09.250> of<00:03:09.430> the<00:03:09.550> books<00:03:09.790> because<00:03:10.360> i<00:03:10.660> felt

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
for each of the books because i felt

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:12.840 
for each of the books because i felt
like<00:03:11.140> the<00:03:11.320> books<00:03:11.500> always<00:03:11.680> had<00:03:12.010> very<00:03:12.280> different

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850 
like the books always had very different

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:15.210 
like the books always had very different
themes<00:03:13.270> at<00:03:13.510> the<00:03:13.600> cores<00:03:13.840> of<00:03:13.959> them<00:03:14.500> and<00:03:14.709> not<00:03:15.010> all

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
themes at the cores of them and not all

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.400 
themes at the cores of them and not all
directors<00:03:15.730> would<00:03:16.450> would<00:03:16.870> make<00:03:17.050> the<00:03:17.200> same

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
directors would would make the same

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:19.440 
directors would would make the same
movie<00:03:17.770> so<00:03:18.040> I<00:03:18.250> felt<00:03:18.670> like<00:03:18.790> that<00:03:19.000> was<00:03:19.209> a<00:03:19.239> way<00:03:19.420> to

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
movie so I felt like that was a way to

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:21.750 
movie so I felt like that was a way to
keep<00:03:19.720> the<00:03:19.959> the<00:03:20.560> movies<00:03:20.860> fresh<00:03:21.100> for<00:03:21.310> audiences

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 
the themes of Breaking Dawn were the

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:32.940 
the themes of Breaking Dawn were the
most<00:03:30.010> complex<00:03:30.430> and<00:03:30.640> mature<00:03:30.970> and<00:03:31.239> and<00:03:31.950> Bill's

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
most complex and mature and and Bill's

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:34.500 
most complex and mature and and Bill's
kind<00:03:33.340> of<00:03:33.430> commitment<00:03:33.760> over<00:03:34.030> the<00:03:34.120> last<00:03:34.270> two

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
kind of commitment over the last two

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.240 
kind of commitment over the last two
years<00:03:34.540> literally<00:03:35.290> every<00:03:35.650> day<00:03:35.830> for<00:03:36.100> two<00:03:36.220> years

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
years literally every day for two years

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.510 
years literally every day for two years
he's<00:03:36.700> been<00:03:36.880> on<00:03:37.090> these<00:03:37.630> two<00:03:37.870> movies<00:03:38.050> I<00:03:39.040> think<00:03:39.430> a

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:39.520 
he's been on these two movies I think a

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.220 
he's been on these two movies I think a
lot<00:03:39.550> of<00:03:39.700> people<00:03:39.820> about<00:03:40.270> six<00:03:40.540> months<00:03:40.720> ago<00:03:40.900> would

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
lot of people about six months ago would

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.199 
lot of people about six months ago would
have<00:03:41.260> quit<00:03:41.500> push<00:03:41.770> quit<00:03:42.220> pushing<00:03:42.459> and<00:03:42.850> trying

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:43.209 
have quit push quit pushing and trying

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:45.030 
have quit push quit pushing and trying
to<00:03:43.420> make<00:03:43.570> things<00:03:43.600> better<00:03:44.080> but<00:03:44.350> he<00:03:44.440> kept<00:03:44.680> on<00:03:44.860> it

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
to make things better but he kept on it

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.120 
to make things better but he kept on it
and<00:03:45.220> I<00:03:45.400> think<00:03:45.820> the<00:03:45.910> results<00:03:46.360> are<00:03:46.480> fantastic<00:03:47.200> it

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:48.130 
and I think the results are fantastic it

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:49.979 
and I think the results are fantastic it
feels<00:03:48.430> in<00:03:48.910> one<00:03:49.120> sense<00:03:49.330> it<00:03:49.480> feels<00:03:49.690> like<00:03:49.810> it's

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:49.989 
feels in one sense it feels like it's

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:51.540 
feels in one sense it feels like it's
gone<00:03:50.170> on<00:03:50.200> for<00:03:50.380> so<00:03:50.680> long<00:03:50.709> because<00:03:51.250> it's<00:03:51.430> been

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:51.550 
gone on for so long because it's been

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:53.070 
gone on for so long because it's been
such<00:03:51.760> a<00:03:51.790> huge<00:03:52.030> part<00:03:52.269> of<00:03:52.390> our<00:03:52.480> lives<00:03:52.660> and<00:03:52.959> it's

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:53.080 
such a huge part of our lives and it's

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.229 
such a huge part of our lives and it's
meant<00:03:53.260> so<00:03:53.410> much<00:03:53.470> to<00:03:53.800> us<00:03:53.830> but<00:03:54.760> in<00:03:54.880> another<00:03:55.000> sense

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:55.239 
meant so much to us but in another sense

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:59.320 
meant so much to us but in another sense
it<00:03:55.720> it's<00:03:56.140> kind<00:03:56.410> of<00:03:56.530> flown<00:03:56.830> by<00:03:57.100> and

00:03:59.320 --> 00:03:59.330 
it it's kind of flown by and

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:01.030 
it it's kind of flown by and
and<00:03:59.450> then<00:03:59.990> also<00:04:00.140> there's<00:04:00.500> the<00:04:00.590> fact<00:04:00.770> that<00:04:00.890> we

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.040 
and then also there's the fact that we

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.010 
and then also there's the fact that we
finished<00:04:01.340> filming<00:04:01.430> these<00:04:01.880> movies<00:04:02.330> almost<00:04:02.660> two

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:03.020 
finished filming these movies almost two

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:05.770 
finished filming these movies almost two
years<00:04:03.320> ago<00:04:03.580> so<00:04:04.580> it<00:04:04.700> feels<00:04:04.880> like<00:04:05.090> we<00:04:05.270> have<00:04:05.480> been

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:05.780 
years ago so it feels like we have been

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:07.990 
years ago so it feels like we have been
done<00:04:06.080> but<00:04:06.380> then<00:04:06.560> the<00:04:07.070> movies<00:04:07.400> still<00:04:07.670> have<00:04:07.850> yet

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
done but then the movies still have yet

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.670 
done but then the movies still have yet
to<00:04:08.060> come<00:04:08.330> out<00:04:08.510> so<00:04:08.930> it's<00:04:09.080> all<00:04:09.200> very<00:04:09.380> just

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
to come out so it's all very just

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:15.010 
to come out so it's all very just
confusing<00:04:10.370> and<00:04:13.360> it's<00:04:14.360> because<00:04:14.690> it<00:04:14.900> is<00:04:14.990> a

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:15.020 
confusing and it's because it is a

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:16.990 
confusing and it's because it is a
strange<00:04:15.470> feeling<00:04:15.920> it's<00:04:16.280> weird<00:04:16.640> it's<00:04:16.940> weird

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.000 
strange feeling it's weird it's weird

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.080 
strange feeling it's weird it's weird
that's<00:04:17.269> coming<00:04:17.600> to<00:04:17.630> an<00:04:17.840> end<00:04:17.930> to<00:04:18.620> be<00:04:19.090> seriously

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.090 
that's coming to an end to be seriously

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:22.960 
that's coming to an end to be seriously
honest<00:04:20.480> I<00:04:20.750> I<00:04:21.190> think<00:04:22.190> if<00:04:22.250> I<00:04:22.340> were<00:04:22.460> to<00:04:22.550> run<00:04:22.700> into

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:22.970 
honest I I think if I were to run into

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:24.550 
honest I I think if I were to run into
anyone<00:04:23.210> who'd<00:04:23.540> been<00:04:23.720> involved<00:04:24.140> in<00:04:24.200> this<00:04:24.350> thing

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:24.560 
anyone who'd been involved in this thing

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.580 
anyone who'd been involved in this thing
I<00:04:25.150> doesn't<00:04:26.150> matter<00:04:26.270> how<00:04:26.450> many<00:04:26.630> years<00:04:26.720> go<00:04:27.140> by<00:04:27.170> I

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590 
I doesn't matter how many years go by I

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:31.210 
I doesn't matter how many years go by I
think<00:04:27.650> it<00:04:27.920> would<00:04:28.010> be<00:04:28.810> sort<00:04:29.810> of<00:04:29.900> instant<00:04:30.350> you

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.220 
think it would be sort of instant you

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:34.060 
think it would be sort of instant you
know<00:04:31.310> you<00:04:31.370> do<00:04:31.760> you<00:04:32.660> do<00:04:32.960> create<00:04:33.290> a<00:04:33.410> bond<00:04:33.770> when

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:34.070 
know you do you do create a bond when

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:36.790 
know you do you do create a bond when
you<00:04:34.220> love<00:04:34.760> something<00:04:35.090> together<00:04:35.420> and<00:04:35.930> we<00:04:36.650> got
