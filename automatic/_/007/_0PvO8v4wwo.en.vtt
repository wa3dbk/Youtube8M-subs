cost me 20 ramen be I think it's

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:59.880 
cost me 20 ramen be I think it's
probably<00:01:58.490> cheapest<00:01:59.030> one<00:01:59.149> out<00:01:59.270> there<00:01:59.509> that's

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
probably cheapest one out there that's

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.210 
probably cheapest one out there that's
three<00:02:00.890> canadian<00:02:01.429> dollars<00:02:01.960> this<00:02:02.960> guy<00:02:03.289> is

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220 
three canadian dollars this guy is

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.510 
three canadian dollars this guy is
substantially<00:02:04.970> more<00:02:05.119> expensive<00:02:05.750> at<00:02:06.520> 30

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
substantially more expensive at 30

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.790 
substantially more expensive at 30
remedies<00:02:08.090> so<00:02:08.509> what<00:02:08.690> would<00:02:08.780> that<00:02:08.840> be<00:02:08.989> four

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
remedies so what would that be four

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.180 
remedies so what would that be four
dollars<00:02:09.979> and<00:02:10.369> fifty<00:02:10.729> cents<00:02:11.739> big<00:02:12.739> leap<00:02:12.950> there

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
dollars and fifty cents big leap there

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.250 
dollars and fifty cents big leap there
but<00:02:13.730> as<00:02:14.150> you<00:02:14.360> can<00:02:14.450> see<00:02:14.660> it<00:02:14.780> does<00:02:14.989> have

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
but as you can see it does have

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.039 
but as you can see it does have
adjustable<00:02:15.799> tuners<00:02:16.250> on<00:02:16.489> it<00:02:16.670> it<00:02:16.850> has<00:02:17.360> a<00:02:17.660> plastic

00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:18.049 
adjustable tuners on it it has a plastic

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:21.250 
adjustable tuners on it it has a plastic
head<00:02:18.560> instead<00:02:18.980> of<00:02:19.130> a<00:02:19.280> skinhead<00:02:19.820> and<00:02:20.299> it's<00:02:21.049> very

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
head instead of a skinhead and it's very

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.110 
head instead of a skinhead and it's very
very<00:02:21.320> firm<00:02:21.769> so<00:02:22.040> I<00:02:22.070> think<00:02:22.160> that<00:02:22.340> might<00:02:22.610> be<00:02:22.670> good

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
very firm so I think that might be good

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.650 
very firm so I think that might be good
for<00:02:23.390> the<00:02:23.600> actual<00:02:23.930> found<00:02:24.860> itself<00:02:25.400> I<00:02:25.730> noticed<00:02:26.600> I

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
for the actual found itself I noticed I

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.280 
for the actual found itself I noticed I
get<00:02:26.810> quite<00:02:27.019> a<00:02:27.049> dent<00:02:27.380> when<00:02:27.709> I<00:02:27.950> tuned<00:02:28.310> the

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
get quite a dent when I tuned the

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.229 
get quite a dent when I tuned the
tambourine<00:02:30.290> ukulele<00:02:30.920> in<00:02:31.100> the<00:02:31.310> skin<00:02:31.610> that

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:34.489 
worries me a little bit but the biggest

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:37.960 
worries me a little bit but the biggest
difference<00:02:34.760> is<00:02:35.150> this<00:02:35.920> now<00:02:36.920> purely<00:02:37.310> as<00:02:37.519> a<00:02:37.549> drum

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
difference is this now purely as a drum

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:39.610 
difference is this now purely as a drum

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
sucker all put together that translates

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.229 
sucker all put together that translates
into<00:02:59.630> a<00:03:00.079> much<00:03:00.290> louder<00:03:00.590> and<00:03:01.040> clearer<00:03:01.850> sound

hopefully with less vibration then the

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.050 
hopefully with less vibration then the

me now my biggest challenge now is going

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.440 
me now my biggest challenge now is going
to<00:03:11.209> be<00:03:12.370> I<00:03:13.370> don't<00:03:13.700> know<00:03:13.760> if<00:03:13.850> you<00:03:13.910> can<00:03:14.030> see<00:03:14.299> this

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
to be I don't know if you can see this

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.490 
to be I don't know if you can see this
on<00:03:14.660> here<00:03:14.870> not<00:03:15.140> but<00:03:15.790> this<00:03:16.790> guy<00:03:17.030> has<00:03:17.299> seven<00:03:18.260> heads

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
on here not but this guy has seven heads

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.610 
on here not but this guy has seven heads
and<00:03:19.269> being<00:03:20.269> an<00:03:20.390> uneven<00:03:20.810> number<00:03:20.840> I'm<00:03:21.560> thinking

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
and being an uneven number I'm thinking

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.820 
and being an uneven number I'm thinking
the<00:03:22.610> easiest<00:03:23.120> way<00:03:23.360> to<00:03:23.989> make<00:03:24.019> this<00:03:24.379> work<00:03:24.440> is

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:24.830 
the easiest way to make this work is

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:26.410 
the easiest way to make this work is
going<00:03:25.040> to<00:03:25.160> be<00:03:25.250> actually<00:03:25.370> to<00:03:25.760> remove<00:03:26.090> one<00:03:26.390> of

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
going to be actually to remove one of

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:30.250 
going to be actually to remove one of
these<00:03:26.950> tuning<00:03:27.950> knobs<00:03:28.300> completely<00:03:29.300> and<00:03:29.569> then<00:03:30.200> I

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
these tuning knobs completely and then I

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.589 
these tuning knobs completely and then I
will<00:03:30.440> be<00:03:30.560> able<00:03:30.739> to<00:03:30.860> evenly<00:03:31.250> mount<00:03:31.580> the<00:03:32.360> neck

00:03:32.589 --> 00:03:32.599 
will be able to evenly mount the neck

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:35.350 
will be able to evenly mount the neck
and<00:03:32.870> the<00:03:33.040> bridge<00:03:34.040> or<00:03:34.430> at<00:03:34.580> story<00:03:34.819> the<00:03:34.940> tailpiece

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:35.360 
and the bridge or at story the tailpiece

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:40.449 
and the bridge or at story the tailpiece
at<00:03:35.569> the<00:03:35.660> back<00:03:36.459> otherwise<00:03:37.959> it<00:03:38.959> just<00:03:39.440> may<00:03:40.190> not

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:40.459 
at the back otherwise it just may not

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:42.369 
at the back otherwise it just may not
work<00:03:40.760> out<00:03:40.970> properly<00:03:41.510> so<00:03:41.750> i<00:03:41.810> may<00:03:42.019> have<00:03:42.319> to

00:03:42.369 --> 00:03:42.379 
work out properly so i may have to

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:48.430 
work out properly so i may have to
reduce<00:03:42.950> this<00:03:43.250> 26<00:03:44.019> which<00:03:46.300> based<00:03:47.300> on<00:03:47.569> the<00:03:47.720> neck

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
reduce this 26 which based on the neck

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.500 
reduce this 26 which based on the neck
that<00:03:48.650> I<00:03:48.709> have<00:03:48.890> now<00:03:49.099> might<00:03:49.489> still<00:03:49.849> be<00:03:50.030> okay<00:03:50.360> it

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.510 
that I have now might still be okay it

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:53.710 
that I have now might still be okay it
might<00:03:50.629> work<00:03:50.810> out<00:03:51.019> just<00:03:51.230> fine<00:03:51.349> I<00:03:51.920> one<00:03:52.879> other<00:03:53.360> big

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 
might work out just fine I one other big

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:54.970 
might work out just fine I one other big
challenge<00:03:54.230> and<00:03:54.470> I<00:03:54.500> don't<00:03:54.650> know<00:03:54.739> if<00:03:54.800> you<00:03:54.890> can

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:54.980

solution this time I'm really confident
that<00:04:27.560> this<00:04:27.710> problem<00:04:28.159> is<00:04:28.460> going<00:04:28.849> to<00:04:28.970> give<00:04:29.120> me<00:04:29.150> a

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:29.270 
that this problem is going to give me a

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:31.719 
that this problem is going to give me a
much<00:04:29.479> better<00:04:29.510> sound<00:04:30.140> than<00:04:30.470> the<00:04:30.729> tambourine

00:04:31.719 --> 00:04:31.729 
much better sound than the tambourine

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:35.110 
much better sound than the tambourine
did<00:04:32.060> so<00:04:32.990> now<00:04:33.229> it's<00:04:33.470> a<00:04:33.530> waiting<00:04:33.710> game<00:04:34.090> while<00:04:35.090> I'm

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:35.120 
did so now it's a waiting game while I'm

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.899 
did so now it's a waiting game while I'm
