00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.089
 seen as they have also counted out there 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.049

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:09.049

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:19.660
 now he explains fairly if here in 

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:21.610
 hot as 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:24.600
 my heart has found talking 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:24.600
 I tend to look 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:31.470
 ayayay this is the first let me tell 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:34.160
 a lot and when I tell myself 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:39.610
 today at the stop 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.610
 listen to me what are you talking about 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:55.780
 says that apparently pancho if he wants 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.780
 return with alejandra baigorria 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:00.680
 these pigeons 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:04.750
 yes yes 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.200
 a while ago but I did not mean 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.970
 nothing to avoid hurting susceptibilities 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.400
 about an opportunity in it 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.620
 live show dove a lot you will 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:20.220
 approached pancho to hold a score 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:20.220
 of the same 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:23.490
 when it is in the 

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:29.319
 in the program that celebrated a score 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:31.359
 of the red team and palop accommodates well 

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:33.909
 a lot of confidence compadre but they will continue 

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:35.920
 my ideas says I must not good 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:39.270
 ask yourself in any case not then you go 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.270
 to ask apache 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:49.100
 but not 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.100
 and he always said I found 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.960
 running 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:53.960
 by his side 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:02:00.460
 with her then in any case 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:09.420
 with rolling because it does not bother me or 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.420
 Affect I had not heard anything 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:29.350
 it does not have the giant grooves that it has 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:42.430
 the other guy ask him if he is 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:45.239
 like he likes a pretty girl has 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.239
 feelings 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.870
 and I say 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:57.030
 the magical relationship now if it exists is a 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.040
 common labyrinth because to me I 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:03.770
 involve with a girl now she also 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.770
 worked each pigeon with pancho another day it 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:11.550
 It goes out with pigeons and you have to go to 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:20.430
 do the interview always falls very 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:29.280
 well I lower it because it's a stage 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:31.500
 quiet they fight to everyone every 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:35.209
 who is free to do the best with his 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.209
 life can not hit 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:42.690
 good very good 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:45.830
 Dove would really like everyone 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.830
 do not forget that from today 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.560
 actually all right now is pacho 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:01.530
 single as much as you want to go out with the 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:03.450
 Skunk sun friend already and also 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:05.790
 Alejandro does not want anything anymore 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:07.800
 much and is on the other hand value is 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:10.550
 single and in single account and I can 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.550
 do what he wants 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:18.250
