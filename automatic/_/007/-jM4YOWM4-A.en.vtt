first became visible at about 1900 hours
on<00:00:32.130> the<00:00:32.460> fourth<00:00:32.669> of<00:00:32.820> July<00:00:33.090> and<00:00:33.360> we<00:00:34.200> were<00:00:34.350> able

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
on the fourth of July and we were able

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.620 
on the fourth of July and we were able
to<00:00:34.860> follow<00:00:35.010> it<00:00:35.130> for<00:00:35.250> nearly<00:00:35.370> a<00:00:35.520> day<00:00:35.760> using<00:00:36.390> the

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
to follow it for nearly a day using the

Soho lass goes c3 coronagraph for the
observations<00:00:40.230> were<00:00:40.350> interrupted<00:00:40.739> by<00:00:40.800> one<00:00:40.980> of

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
observations were interrupted by one of

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.160 
observations were interrupted by one of
those<00:00:41.190> annoying<00:00:41.370> data<00:00:41.879> gaps<00:00:42.149> the<00:00:42.719> c2

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
those annoying data gaps the c2

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.450 
those annoying data gaps the c2
instrument<00:00:43.559> caught<00:00:43.770> it<00:00:43.920> in<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.070> edge<00:00:44.250> of<00:00:44.370> the

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
instrument caught it in the edge of the

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.639 
instrument caught it in the edge of the
field<00:00:44.670> of<00:00:44.820> view<00:00:45.020> here<00:00:46.020> I've<00:00:46.170> plotted<00:00:46.350> the

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
field of view here I've plotted the

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:47.959 
field of view here I've plotted the
position<00:00:47.070> of<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.219> comment<00:00:47.520> over<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.760> time

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
position of the comment over the time

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.299 
position of the comment over the time
that<00:00:48.120> we<00:00:48.210> observed<00:00:48.539> it<00:00:48.719> you<00:00:49.710> can<00:00:49.890> see<00:00:50.070> that<00:00:50.100> the

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
that we observed it you can see that the

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:51.680 
that we observed it you can see that the
point<00:00:50.640> of<00:00:50.850> getting<00:00:51.059> further<00:00:51.420> and<00:00:51.629> further

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
point of getting further and further

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.299 
point of getting further and further
apart<00:00:51.989> as<00:00:52.320> it<00:00:52.440> approaches<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:52.860> Sun<00:00:53.129> which

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
apart as it approaches the Sun which

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.459 
apart as it approaches the Sun which
means<00:00:53.520> it's<00:00:53.699> accelerating<00:00:54.210> as<00:00:54.570> it<00:00:55.110> should<00:00:55.289> do

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
means it's accelerating as it should do

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.680 
means it's accelerating as it should do
now<00:00:56.340> let's<00:00:56.640> take<00:00:56.789> a<00:00:56.850> look<00:00:57.059> at<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.210> videos<00:00:57.660> of

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
now let's take a look at the videos of

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.290 
now let's take a look at the videos of
the<00:00:57.989> Comets<00:00:58.289> approach<00:00:58.590> first<00:00:59.340> ac3<00:00:59.940> instrument

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
the Comets approach first ac3 instrument

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.430 
the Comets approach first ac3 instrument
which<00:01:00.480> is<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.660> one<00:01:00.780> with<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:00.960> largest<00:01:01.230> field

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
which is the one with the largest field

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.529 
which is the one with the largest field
of<00:01:01.620> view<00:01:01.739> then<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.850> smaller<00:01:03.090> field<00:01:03.359> of<00:01:03.449> you

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
of view then the smaller field of you

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.170 
of view then the smaller field of you
see<00:01:03.809> two<00:01:04.019> instrument<00:01:04.700> now<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.760> question<00:01:05.939> that

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
see two instrument now the question that

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.660 
see two instrument now the question that
if<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.689> comet<00:01:06.990> were<00:01:07.140> to<00:01:07.409> hit<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.799> Sun<00:01:08.040> would

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
if the comet were to hit the Sun would

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.130 
if the comet were to hit the Sun would
it<00:01:08.790> be<00:01:08.909> hitting<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.210> front<00:01:09.479> side<00:01:09.689> of<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:09.930> Sun

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
it be hitting the front side of the Sun

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.899 
it be hitting the front side of the Sun
nearest<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.619> earth<00:01:10.740> well<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.520> back<00:01:11.640> side<00:01:11.880> of

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
nearest the earth well the back side of

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.730 
nearest the earth well the back side of
the<00:01:12.060> Sun<00:01:12.240> away<00:01:12.479> from<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.780> earth<00:01:12.810> look<00:01:13.530> at<00:01:13.619> that

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
the Sun away from the earth look at that

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.230 
the Sun away from the earth look at that
we<00:01:13.860> have<00:01:13.979> to<00:01:14.070> go<00:01:14.159> to<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.340> stereo<00:01:14.640> data<00:01:14.880> and<00:01:15.119> for

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
we have to go to the stereo data and for

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.730 
we have to go to the stereo data and for
this<00:01:15.360> case<00:01:15.600> I'm<00:01:15.780> going<00:01:15.810> to<00:01:15.960> use<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.350> stereo<00:01:16.680> a

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
this case I'm going to use the stereo a

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.399 
this case I'm going to use the stereo a
data<00:01:17.189> which<00:01:18.030> in<00:01:18.180> these<00:01:18.360> in<00:01:18.630> images<00:01:19.020> makes<00:01:19.259> the

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
data which in these in images makes the

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.380 
data which in these in images makes the
earth<00:01:19.590> be<00:01:19.830> on<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.100> left<00:01:20.310> so<00:01:21.119> it<00:01:21.180> would<00:01:21.299> be

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
earth be on the left so it would be

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.570 
earth be on the left so it would be
hitting<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.689> back<00:01:21.900> side<00:01:22.200> of<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.470> Sun<00:01:22.650> I<00:01:22.890> hope

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
hitting the back side of the Sun I hope

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.039 
hitting the back side of the Sun I hope
you'll<00:01:23.759> notice<00:01:24.090> that<00:01:24.150> because<00:01:24.360> of<00:01:24.780> three

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
you'll notice that because of three

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.440 
you'll notice that because of three
repeats<00:01:25.500> it<00:01:26.340> looks<00:01:26.610> as<00:01:26.759> though<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:27.000> comet<00:01:27.330> is

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
repeats it looks as though the comet is

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.179 
repeats it looks as though the comet is
causing<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:27.900> coronal<00:01:28.229> mass<00:01:28.380> ejection<00:01:28.409> but<00:01:29.100> if

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
causing the coronal mass ejection but if

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.160 
causing the coronal mass ejection but if
you<00:01:29.280> look<00:01:29.400> carefully<00:01:29.750> the<00:01:30.750> coronal<00:01:31.049> mass

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
you look carefully the coronal mass

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.660 
you look carefully the coronal mass
ejection<00:01:31.200> occurs<00:01:31.920> at<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.130> beginning<00:01:32.490> of<00:01:32.549> the

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
ejection occurs at the beginning of the

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.330 
ejection occurs at the beginning of the
sequence<00:01:32.880> not<00:01:33.689> at<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:33.930> end<00:01:34.100> so<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.220> next

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
sequence not at the end so the next

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.060 
sequence not at the end so the next
question<00:01:35.460> is<00:01:35.939> did<00:01:36.329> it<00:01:36.479> survive<00:01:36.920> here<00:01:37.920> I've

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
question is did it survive here I've

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.520 
question is did it survive here I've
extrapolated<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.820> points<00:01:39.240> to<00:01:39.869> see<00:01:40.049> when<00:01:40.290> it

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
extrapolated the points to see when it

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.050 
extrapolated the points to see when it
would<00:01:40.680> have<00:01:40.829> hit<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.100> Sun<00:01:41.340> or<00:01:41.549> when<00:01:41.790> it<00:01:41.939> would

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
would have hit the Sun or when it would

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.270 
would have hit the Sun or when it would
have<00:01:42.210> come<00:01:42.450> out<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:42.659> other<00:01:42.899> side<00:01:43.130> so<00:01:44.130> it'll

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
have come out the other side so it'll

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.319 
have come out the other side so it'll
hit<00:01:44.430> the<00:01:44.520> Sun<00:01:44.700> sometime<00:01:45.030> before<00:01:45.180> midnight

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
hit the Sun sometime before midnight

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.270 
hit the Sun sometime before midnight
yesterday<00:01:45.780> and<00:01:46.290> certainly<00:01:47.100> would<00:01:47.250> have

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
yesterday and certainly would have

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.930 
yesterday and certainly would have
reemerged<00:01:47.640> for<00:01:48.000> six<00:01:48.240> UT<00:01:48.689> today

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:49.940 
reemerged for six UT today

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.480 
reemerged for six UT today
and<00:01:50.030> that<00:01:50.300> didn't<00:01:50.660> happen<00:01:50.810> so<00:01:51.440> obviously<00:01:52.070> this

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
and that didn't happen so obviously this

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.730 
and that didn't happen so obviously this
comet<00:01:52.940> did<00:01:53.090> not<00:01:53.240> survive<00:01:53.600> it's<00:01:54.560> worth

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
comet did not survive it's worth

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.020 
comet did not survive it's worth
remembering<00:01:54.950> that<00:01:55.190> often<00:01:55.550> when<00:01:55.700> there's<00:01:55.850> one

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
remembering that often when there's one

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.290 
remembering that often when there's one
comment<00:01:56.420> coming<00:01:56.690> in<00:01:56.870> there's<00:01:57.440> a<00:01:57.530> whole<00:01:57.710> group

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:58.300

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.640 
comment coming in there's a whole group
it's<00:01:59.300> rather<00:01:59.540> like<00:01:59.750> deer<00:02:00.080> and<00:02:00.260> cockroaches

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:00.650 
it's rather like deer and cockroaches

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:02.940 
it's rather like deer and cockroaches
when<00:02:01.190> you<00:02:01.280> see<00:02:01.460> one<00:02:01.640> there's<00:02:01.970> probably<00:02:02.240> a<00:02:02.300> lot

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
when you see one there's probably a lot
