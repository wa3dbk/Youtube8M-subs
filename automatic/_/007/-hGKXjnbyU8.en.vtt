00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.160 

I<00:00:06.830> started<00:00:07.830> at<00:00:08.460> a<00:00:08.490> young<00:00:08.580> age<00:00:09.080> tearing<00:00:10.080> apart

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
I started at a young age tearing apart

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:11.959 
I started at a young age tearing apart
all<00:00:10.410> of<00:00:10.500> my<00:00:10.590> models<00:00:10.740> all<00:00:11.070> of<00:00:11.130> my<00:00:11.190> RC<00:00:11.519> cars<00:00:11.700> I

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
all of my models all of my RC cars I

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.390 
all of my models all of my RC cars I
love<00:00:12.690> pulling<00:00:13.590> apart<00:00:13.799> something<00:00:14.280> and

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
love pulling apart something and

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.279 
love pulling apart something and
figuring<00:00:14.639> out<00:00:14.759> how<00:00:14.940> it<00:00:15.089> worked<00:00:15.299> and<00:00:15.540> finding<00:00:16.260> a

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
figuring out how it worked and finding a

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:17.480 
figuring out how it worked and finding a
way<00:00:16.379> I<00:00:16.410> could<00:00:16.619> actually<00:00:16.650> improve<00:00:16.980> upon<00:00:17.190> it<00:00:17.250> I

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
way I could actually improve upon it I

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.269 
way I could actually improve upon it I
really<00:00:17.820> felt<00:00:18.090> that<00:00:18.590> when<00:00:19.590> I<00:00:19.619> learned<00:00:19.800> about<00:00:19.949> 3d

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
really felt that when I learned about 3d

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:21.470 
really felt that when I learned about 3d
printing<00:00:20.310> it<00:00:20.820> could<00:00:20.939> be<00:00:21.029> something<00:00:21.180> very

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
printing it could be something very

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.090 
printing it could be something very
powerful<00:00:21.660> for<00:00:21.990> me<00:00:22.050> I<00:00:22.260> could<00:00:22.500> actually<00:00:22.619> take<00:00:22.920> it

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
powerful for me I could actually take it

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.570 
powerful for me I could actually take it
and<00:00:23.580> and<00:00:23.900> make<00:00:24.900> my<00:00:25.080> ideas<00:00:25.380> reality<00:00:25.800> being<00:00:26.490> an

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
and and make my ideas reality being an

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:27.859 
and and make my ideas reality being an
architect<00:00:26.789> when<00:00:27.060> I<00:00:27.150> was<00:00:27.269> first<00:00:27.420> designing

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
architect when I was first designing

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.689 
architect when I was first designing
this<00:00:27.960> printer<00:00:28.289> it<00:00:28.980> was<00:00:29.130> my<00:00:29.250> intention<00:00:29.550> to

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
this printer it was my intention to

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.600 
this printer it was my intention to
actually<00:00:30.090> be<00:00:30.210> able<00:00:30.300> to<00:00:30.590> print<00:00:31.610> architectural

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
actually be able to print architectural

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.940 
actually be able to print architectural
joints<00:00:33.000> or<00:00:33.149> details<00:00:33.660> on<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.410> printer<00:00:34.710> and

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
joints or details on the printer and

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.889 
joints or details on the printer and
test<00:00:35.489> them<00:00:35.640> out<00:00:35.670> in<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:35.850> real<00:00:36.000> world<00:00:36.210> you<00:00:36.750> have

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
test them out in the real world you have

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.060 
test them out in the real world you have
right<00:00:37.200> now<00:00:37.380> people<00:00:37.739> sharing<00:00:38.329> models<00:00:39.329> sharing

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:40.070 
right now people sharing models sharing

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.650 
right now people sharing models sharing
designs<00:00:41.070> with<00:00:41.399> users<00:00:42.000> all<00:00:42.180> around<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.510> world

designs with users all around the world

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.240 
designs with users all around the world
so<00:00:42.899> they<00:00:43.020> can<00:00:43.200> print<00:00:43.379> their<00:00:43.530> own<00:00:43.559> and<00:00:43.920> they<00:00:44.070> can

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
so they can print their own and they can

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.160 
so they can print their own and they can
take<00:00:44.460> this<00:00:44.670> model<00:00:45.090> download<00:00:45.300> it<00:00:45.539> it<00:00:45.899> could<00:00:46.110> be

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
take this model download it it could be

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.110 
take this model download it it could be
a<00:00:46.200> part<00:00:46.530> for<00:00:46.739> their<00:00:46.860> car<00:00:47.370> that<00:00:47.700> they<00:00:47.789> want<00:00:48.030> to

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
a part for their car that they want to

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.940 
a part for their car that they want to
print<00:00:48.270> out<00:00:48.450> and<00:00:48.690> use<00:00:48.960> it<00:00:49.110> as<00:00:49.200> an<00:00:49.289> upgrade<00:00:49.379> right

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
print out and use it as an upgrade right

print out and use it as an upgrade right
now<00:00:50.160> there's<00:00:50.520> a<00:00:50.660> large<00:00:51.660> online<00:00:51.989> community

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
now there's a large online community

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.410 
now there's a large online community
where<00:00:52.649> people<00:00:52.710> can<00:00:53.100> share<00:00:53.370> all<00:00:53.850> of<00:00:53.879> their

where people can share all of their

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.600 
where people can share all of their
designs<00:00:54.719> all<00:00:54.930> of<00:00:55.050> their<00:00:55.140> products<00:00:55.500> and<00:00:55.649> others

can just download them and we envision
that<00:00:58.289> this<00:00:58.469> printer<00:00:58.770> will<00:00:58.980> be<00:00:59.129> part<00:00:59.430> of<00:00:59.460> that

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
that this printer will be part of that

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.220 
that this printer will be part of that
community<00:00:59.730> we<00:01:00.420> really<00:01:00.660> want<00:01:00.809> people<00:01:00.870> to<00:01:01.140> be

which<00:01:42.060> is<00:01:42.210> a<00:01:42.240> highly<00:01:42.840> detailed<00:01:42.990> model<00:01:43.470> once<00:01:43.979> we

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
which is a highly detailed model once we

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.440 
which is a highly detailed model once we
decided<00:01:44.520> that<00:01:44.549> we<00:01:44.759> wanted<00:01:45.000> to<00:01:45.060> have<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.299> bed

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
decided that we wanted to have the bed

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.510 
decided that we wanted to have the bed
size<00:01:45.689> large<00:01:46.110> this<00:01:46.649> immediately<00:01:47.070> set<00:01:47.340> this

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
size large this immediately set this

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.100 
size large this immediately set this
stage<00:01:47.820> for<00:01:48.149> other<00:01:48.420> parts<00:01:48.689> of<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:48.810> printer

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
stage for other parts of the printer

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.580 
stage for other parts of the printer
such<00:01:49.560> as<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:50.009> dual<00:01:50.430> z-axis<00:01:51.390> a<00:01:51.689> powerful<00:01:52.380> motor

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
such as the dual z-axis a powerful motor

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.010 
such as the dual z-axis a powerful motor
to<00:01:52.799> move<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.100> bed<00:01:53.220> itself<00:01:53.369> an<00:01:54.240> integrated

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
to move the bed itself an integrated

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.389 
to move the bed itself an integrated
blower<00:01:55.200> fan<00:01:55.470> actually<00:01:55.860> in<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:56.009> extruder

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
blower fan actually in the extruder

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.010 
blower fan actually in the extruder
which<00:01:56.579> allows<00:01:57.210> for<00:01:57.420> your<00:01:57.509> parts<00:01:57.750> to<00:01:57.869> cool

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
which allows for your parts to cool

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.109 
which allows for your parts to cool
quite<00:01:58.290> quickly<00:01:58.530> and<00:01:58.939> along<00:01:59.939> with<00:01:59.969> that

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
quite quickly and along with that

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.639 
quite quickly and along with that
there's<00:02:00.450> actually<00:02:00.570> an<00:02:00.780> LED<00:02:01.079> lighting<00:02:01.619> system

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
there's actually an LED lighting system

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.139 
there's actually an LED lighting system
so<00:02:02.070> you<00:02:02.159> can<00:02:02.189> easily<00:02:02.520> see<00:02:02.670> what's<00:02:03.030> your
