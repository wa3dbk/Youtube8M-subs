00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
modeling amplifiers have evolved as

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.300 
modeling amplifiers have evolved as
we've<00:00:21.180> gone<00:00:21.330> forward<00:00:21.630> this<00:00:21.960> is<00:00:22.470> like<00:00:23.070> the

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
we've gone forward this is like the

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.730 
we've gone forward this is like the
ultimate<00:00:23.340> modeling<00:00:24.119> amplifier<00:00:24.510> is<00:00:24.779> the<00:00:25.410> most

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
ultimate modeling amplifier is the most

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.910 
ultimate modeling amplifier is the most
advanced<00:00:26.640> modeling<00:00:27.060> amplifier<00:00:27.510> out<00:00:27.810> there<00:00:28.170> it

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
advanced modeling amplifier out there it

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.209 
advanced modeling amplifier out there it
still<00:00:29.429> has<00:00:29.820> our<00:00:30.210> patented<00:00:31.170> trance<00:00:31.769> tube

still has our patented trance tube
circuitry<00:00:33.059> so<00:00:33.600> all<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.110> distortions<00:00:34.440> you

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
circuitry so all the distortions you

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.700 
circuitry so all the distortions you
hear<00:00:35.190> are<00:00:35.910> an<00:00:36.149> analog<00:00:36.480> preamp<00:00:36.870> was<00:00:37.170> forced

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
hear are an analog preamp was forced

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.130 
hear are an analog preamp was forced
gain<00:00:37.980> stages<00:00:38.550> in<00:00:38.640> a<00:00:38.700> trance<00:00:38.940> 2<00:00:39.149> p.m.<00:00:39.480> and<00:00:40.020> it

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
gain stages in a trance 2 p.m. and it

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.280 
gain stages in a trance 2 p.m. and it
basically<00:00:40.290> means<00:00:41.270> that<00:00:42.270> it<00:00:42.390> reacts<00:00:42.750> and<00:00:42.989> feels

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
basically means that it reacts and feels

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.520 
basically means that it reacts and feels
like<00:00:44.010> a<00:00:44.040> tube<00:00:44.399> amp<00:00:44.610> and<00:00:44.910> it's<00:00:45.780> not<00:00:46.079> digital

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
like a tube amp and it's not digital

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.459 
like a tube amp and it's not digital
distortion<00:00:47.100> because<00:00:47.460> that<00:00:47.640> is<00:00:47.789> a<00:00:47.820> problematic

00:00:48.459 --> 00:00:48.469 
distortion because that is a problematic

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:52.100 
distortion because that is a problematic
however<00:00:49.469> it<00:00:49.860> does<00:00:50.129> have<00:00:50.340> a<00:00:50.579> dual<00:00:51.030> processor<00:00:51.899> in

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
however it does have a dual processor in

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.069 
however it does have a dual processor in
here<00:00:52.860> so<00:00:53.489> what<00:00:54.180> we<00:00:54.300> can<00:00:54.390> actually<00:00:54.510> do<00:00:54.780> is<00:00:54.899> do

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
here so what we can actually do is do

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.170 
here so what we can actually do is do
all<00:00:55.260> sorts<00:00:55.800> of<00:00:55.890> stuff<00:00:56.129> and<00:00:56.250> everything<00:00:57.030> is

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
all sorts of stuff and everything is

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.959 
all sorts of stuff and everything is
added<00:00:57.449> editable<00:00:58.079> and<00:00:58.260> assignable<00:00:59.160> so<00:00:59.670> first

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
added editable and assignable so first

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.959 
added editable and assignable so first
off<00:01:00.329> we<00:01:00.989> can<00:01:01.170> assign<00:01:01.440> four<00:01:01.949> different<00:01:02.850> models

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
off we can assign four different models

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.649 
off we can assign four different models
here<00:01:03.420> now<00:01:03.989> any<00:01:04.320> four<00:01:04.739> V's<00:01:05.040> can<00:01:05.430> be<00:01:05.640> an<00:01:05.880> amp<00:01:06.390> a

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
here now any four V's can be an amp a

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.380 
here now any four V's can be an amp a
stompbox<00:01:07.530> or<00:01:07.799> rack<00:01:08.130> effects<00:01:08.490> with<00:01:09.299> the

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
stompbox or rack effects with the

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.410 
stompbox or rack effects with the
additional<00:01:10.670> ability<00:01:11.670> to<00:01:11.820> have<00:01:11.970> an<00:01:12.090> instrument

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
additional ability to have an instrument

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.260 
additional ability to have an instrument
model<00:01:12.780> in<00:01:12.900> model<00:01:13.170> one<00:01:13.350> here<00:01:13.590> this<00:01:14.220> means<00:01:14.580> you

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
model in model one here this means you

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.140 
model in model one here this means you
can<00:01:15.509> run<00:01:16.350> four<00:01:16.740> amps<00:01:17.189> in<00:01:17.310> parallel<00:01:17.729> if<00:01:17.939> you

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
can run four amps in parallel if you

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.140 
can run four amps in parallel if you
like<00:01:18.360> you<00:01:19.020> could<00:01:19.200> run<00:01:19.439> free<00:01:20.070> stompboxes<00:01:20.850> and

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
like you could run free stompboxes and

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.450 
like you could run free stompboxes and
one<00:01:21.600> amp<00:01:21.780> or<00:01:22.020> as<00:01:22.200> I'm<00:01:22.350> doing<00:01:22.619> here<00:01:22.890> you<00:01:23.310> could

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
one amp or as I'm doing here you could

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.490 
one amp or as I'm doing here you could
run<00:01:23.670> an<00:01:23.970> instrument<00:01:24.420> model<00:01:24.659> an<00:01:24.869> amplifier<00:01:25.380> a

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
run an instrument model an amplifier a

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.249 
run an instrument model an amplifier a
stomp<00:01:25.890> box<00:01:26.130> and<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.520> rack<00:01:26.700> effect<00:01:27.090> all<00:01:27.540> fully

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
stomp box and the rack effect all fully

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.020 
stomp box and the rack effect all fully
editable<00:01:28.650> was<00:01:28.860> looked<00:01:29.009> five<00:01:29.310> parameters<00:01:29.610> for

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
editable was looked five parameters for

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.740 
editable was looked five parameters for
some<00:01:30.180> effects<00:01:30.560> and<00:01:31.560> that<00:01:32.520> ability<00:01:32.759> just<00:01:33.210> opens

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
some effects and that ability just opens

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.130 
some effects and that ability just opens
up<00:01:33.960> what<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.829> amp<00:01:34.950> can<00:01:35.220> actually<00:01:35.520> do<00:01:35.700> and<00:01:36.140> we

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
up what the amp can actually do and we

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.469 
up what the amp can actually do and we
also<00:01:37.290> have<00:01:37.619> separate<00:01:38.009> delay<00:01:38.310> and<00:01:38.610> reverb<00:01:38.970> to

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
also have separate delay and reverb to

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.780 
also have separate delay and reverb to
add<00:01:39.630> to<00:01:39.840> this<00:01:39.990> but<00:01:40.259> there's<00:01:40.979> different<00:01:41.250> types

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
add to this but there's different types

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.700 
add to this but there's different types
of<00:01:42.000> delay<00:01:42.240> in<00:01:42.390> different<00:01:42.780> types<00:01:42.990> of<00:01:43.140> reverb<00:01:43.320> as

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
of delay in different types of reverb as

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.410 
of delay in different types of reverb as
well<00:01:43.860> and<00:01:44.159> then<00:01:44.490> you<00:01:44.579> can<00:01:44.759> edit<00:01:44.880> stuff<00:01:45.240> like

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
well and then you can edit stuff like

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.899 
well and then you can edit stuff like
the<00:01:45.540> room<00:01:45.720> size<00:01:46.079> of<00:01:46.320> a<00:01:46.409> reverb<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:47.070> level<00:01:47.460> for

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
the room size of a reverb the level for

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.690 
the room size of a reverb the level for
instance<00:01:47.939> and<00:01:48.540> we<00:01:49.320> can<00:01:49.470> also<00:01:49.619> edit<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.369> input

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
instance and we can also edit the input

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.080 
instance and we can also edit the input
and<00:01:50.850> output<00:01:50.939> options<00:01:51.350> so<00:01:52.640> if<00:01:53.640> I<00:01:53.729> just<00:01:53.909> go<00:01:54.000> in

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
and output options so if I just go in

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.179 
and output options so if I just go in
here<00:01:54.240> I<00:01:54.299> can<00:01:54.630> edit<00:01:54.750> what's<00:01:55.560> happening<00:01:55.950> an

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
here I can edit what's happening an

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.830 
here I can edit what's happening an
input<00:01:56.579> station<00:01:56.909> I<00:01:56.939> can<00:01:57.090> actually<00:01:57.390> edit<00:01:57.479> I

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
input station I can actually edit I

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.719 
input station I can actually edit I
could<00:01:58.229> turn<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.500> noise<00:01:58.619> gate<00:01:58.979> on<00:01:59.189> or<00:01:59.340> off<00:01:59.490> I

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
could turn the noise gate on or off I

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.639 
could turn the noise gate on or off I
could<00:02:00.180> turn<00:02:00.360> a<00:02:00.390> bright<00:02:00.630> switch<00:02:00.960> on<00:02:01.140> or<00:02:01.259> off<00:02:01.290> and

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
could turn a bright switch on or off and

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.980 
could turn a bright switch on or off and
this<00:02:01.740> is<00:02:01.890> per<00:02:02.130> preset<00:02:02.729> not<00:02:03.030> a<00:02:03.060> global<00:02:03.600> control

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
this is per preset not a global control

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.310 
this is per preset not a global control
I<00:02:04.710> can<00:02:05.040> change<00:02:05.280> the<00:02:05.460> input<00:02:05.790> sensitivity<00:02:06.240> so<00:02:07.200> if

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
I can change the input sensitivity so if

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.900 
I can change the input sensitivity so if
you<00:02:07.409> have<00:02:07.560> a<00:02:07.590> lower<00:02:07.890> output<00:02:08.099> guitar<00:02:08.610> you<00:02:08.759> can

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
you have a lower output guitar you can

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.300 
you have a lower output guitar you can
match<00:02:09.119> it<00:02:09.149> up<00:02:09.330> here<00:02:09.599> for<00:02:09.780> a<00:02:09.810> preset<00:02:10.259> the<00:02:11.129> gate

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
match it up here for a preset the gate

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.400 
match it up here for a preset the gate

of<00:02:13.470> a<00:02:13.560> wire<00:02:13.770> intensity<00:02:14.490> so<00:02:14.790> you<00:02:14.850> really<00:02:15.180> come

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390

edit<00:02:15.840> every<00:02:16.080> trim<00:02:16.290> and<00:02:16.680> then<00:02:16.770> on<00:02:16.890> the<00:02:16.950> output

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420

just to show you the looper what we can
do<00:04:16.990> here

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:45.620 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:49.700 

you<00:04:46.620> can<00:04:46.800> keep<00:04:46.980> looping<00:04:47.450> up<00:04:48.450> tubes<00:04:48.810> of<00:04:49.140> four<00:04:49.590> or

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
you can keep looping up tubes of four or

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:52.520 
you can keep looping up tubes of four or
five<00:04:49.860> different<00:04:50.190> levels<00:04:50.930> and<00:04:51.930> also<00:04:52.140> the

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:52.530 
five different levels and also the

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:54.890 
five different levels and also the
expression<00:04:52.800> pedals<00:04:53.430> and<00:04:53.700> this<00:04:53.900> foot

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:54.900 
expression pedals and this foot

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.680 
expression pedals and this foot
controller<00:04:55.350> can<00:04:55.590> be<00:04:55.680> assigned<00:04:55.980> to<00:04:56.220> any<00:04:56.690> effect

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:57.690 
controller can be assigned to any effect

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:59.690 
controller can be assigned to any effect
parameter<00:04:58.260> as<00:04:58.800> well<00:04:59.040> so<00:04:59.190> it<00:04:59.280> can<00:04:59.310> bring<00:04:59.640> in

00:04:59.690 --> 00:04:59.700 
parameter as well so it can bring in

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:03.190 
parameter as well so it can bring in
different<00:05:00.240> delay<00:05:00.450> times<00:05:00.810> or<00:05:01.940> different

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:03.200 
different delay times or different

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:07.160 
different delay times or different
modulation<00:05:04.200> speeds<00:05:04.830> etc<00:05:05.760> so<00:05:06.660> as<00:05:06.780> you<00:05:06.870> can<00:05:06.990> see

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:07.170 
modulation speeds etc so as you can see

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:09.350 
modulation speeds etc so as you can see
it's<00:05:07.500> like<00:05:07.830> the<00:05:08.430> ultimate<00:05:08.550> modeling<00:05:09.210> um

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 
it's like the ultimate modeling um

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.350 
it's like the ultimate modeling um
everything<00:05:10.050> is<00:05:10.110> editable<00:05:11.060> complete<00:05:12.060> control

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:12.360 
everything is editable complete control

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.020 
everything is editable complete control
of<00:05:12.480> a<00:05:12.600> foot<00:05:12.780> switch<00:05:13.020> as<00:05:13.200> well<00:05:13.230> and<00:05:13.560> and<00:05:14.550> because

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:15.030 
of a foot switch as well and and because

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:17.090 
of a foot switch as well and and because
it's<00:05:15.150> a<00:05:15.210> transgene<00:05:15.690> bump<00:05:15.930> it<00:05:16.440> sounds<00:05:16.920> great

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:17.100 
it's a transgene bump it sounds great

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:20.330 
it's a transgene bump it sounds great
and<00:05:17.310> feels<00:05:17.640> great<00:05:17.880> as<00:05:18.180> well
