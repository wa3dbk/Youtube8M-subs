just what it looks like like he is being
controlled<00:02:18.780> by<00:02:19.050> this<00:02:19.200> like<00:02:19.620> men<00:02:19.890> thing<00:02:20.460> and

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
controlled by this like men thing and

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.430 
controlled by this like men thing and
it's<00:02:21.270> like<00:02:21.420> a<00:02:21.450> puppet<00:02:21.720> master<00:02:22.170> and<00:02:22.200> it's

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
it's like a puppet master and it's

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.230

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.540 
he looks like he's as strong as he was
when<00:02:26.250> he<00:02:26.310> was<00:02:26.460> alive<00:02:26.670> so<00:02:27.920> therefore<00:02:28.920> pedo<00:02:29.340> has

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
when he was alive so therefore pedo has

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.100 
when he was alive so therefore pedo has
this<00:02:29.700> ability<00:02:29.970> apparently<00:02:30.270> unless<00:02:30.840> it<00:02:31.020> was

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
this ability apparently unless it was

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:32.570 
this ability apparently unless it was
shy<00:02:31.260> a<00:02:31.290> possibility<00:02:31.980> but<00:02:32.100> it<00:02:32.190> was<00:02:32.280> most<00:02:32.520> likely

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
shy a possibility but it was most likely

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.090 
shy a possibility but it was most likely

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
we get a little bit of a glimpse of the

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.210 
we get a little bit of a glimpse of the
fight<00:03:54.360> between<00:03:54.540> knuckle<00:03:55.020> and<00:03:55.170> gun<00:03:55.350> killer<00:03:56.010> was

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:58.320 
staying out of it and basically biscay

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:59.479 
staying out of it and basically biscay
is<00:03:58.380> like<00:03:58.530> if<00:03:58.680> they<00:03:58.800> fight<00:03:59.010> them<00:03:59.220> at<00:03:59.310> full

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
is like if they fight them at full

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:01.940 
is like if they fight them at full
strength<00:03:59.820> they<00:04:00.750> have<00:04:00.900> to<00:04:01.080> accept<00:04:01.590> the

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
strength they have to accept the

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.530 
strength they have to accept the
situation<00:04:02.160> if<00:04:02.670> they<00:04:02.880> win<00:04:03.090> or<00:04:03.120> lose<00:04:03.360> after

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
situation if they win or lose after

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:06.020
