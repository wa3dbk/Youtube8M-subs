00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010

this<00:02:14.810> but<00:02:15.810> because<00:02:16.590> it<00:02:16.739> was<00:02:16.860> so<00:02:17.130> detailed<00:02:17.430> the

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
this but because it was so detailed the

the<00:02:20.629> tim<00:02:20.840> holtz<00:02:21.170> stampin<00:02:21.680> it's<00:02:21.830> just<00:02:22.010> a

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
the tim holtz stampin it's just a

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:28.479 
the tim holtz stampin it's just a
postmark<00:02:24.849> and<00:02:26.110> again<00:02:27.110> just<00:02:27.290> using<00:02:27.409> at<00:02:28.280> this

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:28.489 
postmark and again just using at this

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:30.670

point<00:02:28.730> first<00:02:29.299> for<00:02:29.569> the<00:02:29.599> stamping<00:02:30.110> i'm<00:02:30.230> using

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
point first for the stamping i'm using

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.570 
point first for the stamping i'm using
stays<00:02:31.159> on<00:02:31.400> distress<00:02:32.330> ink<00:02:32.569> wood<00:02:32.780> is<00:02:33.500> too<00:02:33.830> watery

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
stays on distress ink wood is too watery

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.789 
stays on distress ink wood is too watery
so<00:02:35.060> it<00:02:35.269> would<00:02:35.420> just<00:02:35.450> kind<00:02:35.810> of<00:02:35.989> smear<00:02:36.470> and<00:02:36.590> wick

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:36.799 
so it would just kind of smear and wick

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:38.770 
so it would just kind of smear and wick
on<00:02:37.160> the<00:02:37.280> fabric<00:02:37.459> so<00:02:38.180> you<00:02:38.299> need<00:02:38.450> to<00:02:38.599> use

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
on the fabric so you need to use

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.530 
on the fabric so you need to use
something<00:02:39.019> with<00:02:39.440> the<00:02:39.620> pigment<00:02:40.129> in<00:02:40.280> it<00:02:40.540> light

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
something with the pigment in it light

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:46.000 
something with the pigment in it light
stays<00:02:41.840> on<00:02:41.989> our<00:02:42.200> rival<00:02:44.349> and<00:02:45.349> this<00:02:45.620> is<00:02:45.769> another

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010

a little bit more so I put a few Nicks
and<00:04:27.919> cuts<00:04:27.979> in<00:04:28.430> there<00:04:28.640> like<00:04:28.940> in<00:04:29.090> the<00:04:29.180> top<00:04:29.360> left

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.690 
and cuts in there like in the top left

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:31.200 
and cuts in there like in the top left
you<00:04:29.900> can<00:04:29.960> see<00:04:30.110> when<00:04:30.380> where<00:04:30.500> my<00:04:30.620> fingers<00:04:30.950> are

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.210 
you can see when where my fingers are

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:34.070 
you can see when where my fingers are
there's<00:04:32.210> a<00:04:32.300> like<00:04:32.900> a<00:04:32.930> tear<00:04:33.260> in<00:04:33.440> there<00:04:33.620> and

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 
there's a like a tear in there and

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.020 
there's a like a tear in there and
that<00:04:34.139> was<00:04:34.259> intentional<00:04:34.590> and<00:04:35.039> wanted<00:04:35.490> to<00:04:35.610> make

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030 
that was intentional and wanted to make

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:37.580 
that was intentional and wanted to make
it<00:04:36.180> greater<00:04:36.449> I<00:04:36.599> wanted<00:04:36.960> this<00:04:37.050> to<00:04:37.199> look<00:04:37.319> like<00:04:37.379> an

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
it greater I wanted this to look like an

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:40.939 
it greater I wanted this to look like an
old<00:04:37.770> peach<00:04:38.069> of<00:04:38.340> a<00:04:38.610> piece<00:04:39.060> that<00:04:39.270> an<00:04:39.750> old<00:04:40.530> piece

00:04:40.939 --> 00:04:40.949 
old peach of a piece that an old piece

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:47.510 
old peach of a piece that an old piece
of<00:04:40.979> scroll<00:04:41.789> or<00:04:42.349> parchment<00:04:43.669> so<00:04:45.830> yeah<00:04:46.830> that's

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 
of scroll or parchment so yeah that's

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.089 
of scroll or parchment so yeah that's
pretty<00:04:47.819> much<00:04:48.270> it<00:04:48.330> I<00:04:48.870> think<00:04:49.680> there's<00:04:49.860> a<00:04:49.979> little

00:04:50.089 --> 00:04:50.099 
pretty much it I think there's a little

00:04:50.099 --> 00:04:51.950 
pretty much it I think there's a little
bit<00:04:50.370> more<00:04:50.580> I<00:04:50.610> don't<00:04:50.759> know<00:04:50.969> what<00:04:51.120> it<00:04:51.210> is<00:04:51.240> we'll

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:51.960 
bit more I don't know what it is we'll

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:56.570 
bit more I don't know what it is we'll
see<00:04:52.340> um<00:04:54.050> I'm<00:04:55.050> just<00:04:55.259> painting<00:04:55.500> that<00:04:55.710> right<00:04:56.340> side

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:56.580 
see um I'm just painting that right side

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:58.339 
see um I'm just painting that right side
with<00:04:56.879> a<00:04:57.150> little<00:04:57.330> bit<00:04:57.449> of<00:04:57.509> black<00:04:57.719> gesso<00:04:57.960> I

00:04:58.339 --> 00:04:58.349 
with a little bit of black gesso I

00:04:58.349 --> 00:05:00.709 
with a little bit of black gesso I
painted<00:04:59.340> both<00:04:59.490> of<00:04:59.639> the<00:04:59.729> inside<00:05:00.030> covers<00:05:00.419> black

00:05:00.709 --> 00:05:00.719 
painted both of the inside covers black

00:05:00.719 --> 00:05:02.689 
painted both of the inside covers black
so<00:05:01.080> that<00:05:01.259> way<00:05:01.379> it<00:05:01.590> gives<00:05:02.280> a<00:05:02.400> little<00:05:02.520> bit<00:05:02.610> of

00:05:02.689 --> 00:05:02.699 
so that way it gives a little bit of

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:05.200 
so that way it gives a little bit of
contrast<00:05:03.150> to<00:05:03.360> the<00:05:03.449> pages<00:05:03.840> opposite<00:05:04.319> of<00:05:04.680> it

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:05.210 
contrast to the pages opposite of it

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:07.730 
contrast to the pages opposite of it
that's<00:05:06.210> at<00:05:06.330> the<00:05:06.360> inside<00:05:06.780> pages<00:05:07.229> have<00:05:07.560> any

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:07.740 
that's at the inside pages have any

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:10.640 
that's at the inside pages have any
contrast<00:05:08.219> but<00:05:08.610> these<00:05:09.479> ones<00:05:09.690> have<00:05:09.810> contrast<00:05:10.379> so

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:10.650 
contrast but these ones have contrast so

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:14.719 
contrast but these ones have contrast so
there<00:05:11.219> you<00:05:11.340> go<00:05:12.409> so<00:05:13.409> yeah<00:05:13.800> very<00:05:14.099> simple<00:05:14.520> page

00:05:14.719 --> 00:05:14.729 
there you go so yeah very simple page

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:16.640 
there you go so yeah very simple page
but<00:05:15.120> it<00:05:15.300> says<00:05:15.539> zero<00:05:15.690> the<00:05:16.169> number<00:05:16.409> of<00:05:16.500> reasons

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:16.650 
but it says zero the number of reasons

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:19.820 
but it says zero the number of reasons
