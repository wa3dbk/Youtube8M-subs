about the HDS units and a little bit
about<00:00:07.649> the<00:00:07.770> structure<00:00:08.069> skin<00:00:08.460> and<00:00:08.730> how<00:00:08.790> you<00:00:08.849> can

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
about the structure skin and how you can

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:10.730 
about the structure skin and how you can
use<00:00:09.240> those<00:00:09.420> units<00:00:09.809> to<00:00:09.929> mark<00:00:10.139> fish<00:00:10.380> and<00:00:10.620> turn

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
use those units to mark fish and turn

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.070 
use those units to mark fish and turn
around<00:00:10.980> and<00:00:11.070> go<00:00:11.130> back<00:00:11.309> to<00:00:11.490> fish<00:00:11.960> we're<00:00:12.960> out

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
around and go back to fish we're out

around and go back to fish we're out
here<00:00:13.200> trolling<00:00:13.710> we're<00:00:13.920> using<00:00:14.040> the<00:00:14.219> HDS<00:00:14.700> ten

here trolling we're using the HDS ten
we're<00:00:16.289> using<00:00:16.560> the<00:00:16.770> Navionics<00:00:17.190> charts<00:00:17.670> in

there and I've got the safety contour

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.290 
there and I've got the safety contour
set<00:00:20.189> that's<00:00:20.340> why<00:00:20.490> you're<00:00:20.670> seeing<00:00:20.850> the<00:00:21.060> blue

trying to stay out of the trees and then
we've<00:00:59.910> got<00:01:00.030> a<00:01:00.059> couple<00:01:00.300> of<00:01:00.510> LED<00:01:00.690> quarter<00:01:01.020> lines

we've got a couple of LED quarter lines

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.709 
we've got a couple of LED quarter lines
out<00:01:01.500> here<00:01:01.829> in<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.039> leadcore

00:01:02.709 --> 00:01:02.719 
out here in the leadcore

out here in the leadcore
we've<00:01:03.719> got<00:01:03.989> captain<00:01:04.680> max<00:01:04.890> jigs<00:01:05.250> on<00:01:05.489> them<00:01:05.960> with

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
we've got captain max jigs on them with

shadow licious and tsunami baits we've

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.899 
shadow licious and tsunami baits we've
got<00:01:12.720> a<00:01:13.260> pulse<00:01:13.650> jig<00:01:14.010> out<00:01:14.189> because<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.670> pulse

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
got a pulse jig out because the pulse

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.440 
got a pulse jig out because the pulse
jigs<00:01:15.240> have<00:01:15.509> been<00:01:15.630> working<00:01:15.990> really<00:01:16.020> good<00:01:17.450> but

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
jigs have been working really good but

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:19.730 
jigs have been working really good but
we<00:01:18.570> found<00:01:18.810> some<00:01:18.990> fish<00:01:19.200> in<00:01:19.380> here<00:01:19.500> and<00:01:19.650> they're

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
we found some fish in here and they're

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.370 
we found some fish in here and they're
all<00:01:19.860> in<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.189> trees<00:01:20.490> and<00:01:20.880> as<00:01:21.869> you<00:01:22.020> can<00:01:22.110> see<00:01:22.290> from

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
all in the trees and as you can see from

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.620 
all in the trees and as you can see from
the<00:01:22.530> structure<00:01:22.920> scan<00:01:23.009> what<00:01:23.850> we<00:01:24.000> have<00:01:24.240> is<00:01:24.479> I've

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
the structure scan what we have is I've

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.980 
the structure scan what we have is I've
got<00:01:24.810> my<00:01:24.840> down<00:01:25.170> scan<00:01:25.500> on<00:01:25.710> autorange<00:01:26.720> and<00:01:27.720> right

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
got my down scan on autorange and right

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.240 
got my down scan on autorange and right
now<00:01:28.140> it's<00:01:28.350> on<00:01:28.439> a<00:01:28.470> hundred<00:01:28.770> and<00:01:28.860> forty<00:01:29.070> foot

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
now it's on a hundred and forty foot

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.749 
now it's on a hundred and forty foot
scale<00:01:29.930> that<00:01:30.930> means<00:01:31.170> that<00:01:31.439> you<00:01:31.890> know<00:01:32.009> I<00:01:32.040> can<00:01:32.579> see

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
scale that means that you know I can see

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.640 
scale that means that you know I can see
down<00:01:32.880> to<00:01:32.939> 140<00:01:33.810> and<00:01:33.960> that's<00:01:34.079> because<00:01:34.409> we're<00:01:34.619> in

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
down to 140 and that's because we're in

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.130 
down to 140 and that's because we're in
109<00:01:35.520> feet<00:01:35.790> of<00:01:35.939> water<00:01:36.150> and<00:01:36.360> that's<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.600> the

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
109 feet of water and that's the the

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.270 
109 feet of water and that's the the
nearest<00:01:37.409> scale<00:01:37.650> that<00:01:37.799> it's<00:01:37.920> going<00:01:38.009> to<00:01:38.070> go<00:01:38.220> to

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
nearest scale that it's going to go to

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.219 
nearest scale that it's going to go to
and<00:01:38.759> then<00:01:39.060> I<00:01:39.119> got<00:01:39.270> my<00:01:39.360> structure<00:01:39.630> scan<00:01:39.840> looking

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
and then I got my structure scan looking

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.170 
and then I got my structure scan looking
left<00:01:40.409> and<00:01:40.560> right<00:01:40.650> and<00:01:41.130> I've<00:01:41.640> got<00:01:41.820> that<00:01:41.970> on<00:01:42.150> a

left and right and I've got that on a
hundred<00:01:42.570> and<00:01:42.689> eighty<00:01:42.930> feet<00:01:43.229> and<00:01:43.470> I've<00:01:43.530> got

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
hundred and eighty feet and I've got

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.429 
hundred and eighty feet and I've got
that<00:01:43.860> one<00:01:44.040> fixed<00:01:44.640> I've<00:01:44.880> got<00:01:45.390> it<00:01:45.540> on<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:45.750> 455

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
that one fixed I've got it on the 455

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.139 
that one fixed I've got it on the 455
kilohertz<00:01:46.920> and<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:47.340> reason<00:01:47.640> why<00:01:47.759> I<00:01:47.790> have<00:01:48.030> it

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
kilohertz and the reason why I have it

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.389 
kilohertz and the reason why I have it
on<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.360> 455<00:01:49.200> kilohertz<00:01:49.649> is<00:01:49.890> because<00:01:50.189> that's

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
on the 455 kilohertz is because that's

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.120 
on the 455 kilohertz is because that's
what<00:01:50.640> you<00:01:50.759> would<00:01:50.880> want<00:01:51.000> to<00:01:51.149> use<00:01:51.420> in<00:01:52.070> 100<00:01:53.070> feet

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
what you would want to use in 100 feet

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.149 
what you would want to use in 100 feet
or<00:01:53.399> more<00:01:53.930> so<00:01:54.930> any<00:01:55.110> time<00:01:55.320> I'm<00:01:55.439> around<00:01:55.560> 100<00:01:56.009> feet

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
or more so any time I'm around 100 feet

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.499 
or more so any time I'm around 100 feet
I'm<00:01:56.310> typically<00:01:56.670> going<00:01:56.880> to<00:01:56.939> be<00:01:57.030> running<00:01:57.270> that

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
I'm typically going to be running that

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.039 
I'm typically going to be running that
in<00:01:58.070> in<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.340> 455<00:02:00.000> kilohertz<00:02:00.420> if<00:02:00.810> I<00:02:00.930> were

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
in in the 455 kilohertz if I were

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.359 
in in the 455 kilohertz if I were
shallower<00:02:01.439> I'd<00:02:01.590> be<00:02:01.770> running<00:02:01.950> the<00:02:02.219> 800

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
shallower I'd be running the 800

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.499 
shallower I'd be running the 800
kilohertz<00:02:03.439> on<00:02:04.439> the<00:02:04.619> HD<00:02:04.920> si<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:05.549> HD<00:02:05.909> s10<00:02:06.329> you

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
kilohertz on the HD si the HD s10 you

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.270 
kilohertz on the HD si the HD s10 you
can<00:02:06.659> see<00:02:06.840> that<00:02:07.020> I've<00:02:07.110> got<00:02:07.290> my<00:02:07.350> pop-up<00:02:07.920> screens

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
can see that I've got my pop-up screens

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.529 
can see that I've got my pop-up screens
at<00:02:09.030> the<00:02:09.090> bottom<00:02:09.479> of<00:02:09.569> the<00:02:09.629> unit

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:10.539 
at the bottom of the unit

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:12.030 
at the bottom of the unit
a<00:02:10.599> little<00:02:10.989> trick<00:02:11.230> that<00:02:11.260> most<00:02:11.560> people<00:02:11.860> don't

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
a little trick that most people don't

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.430 
a little trick that most people don't
know<00:02:12.190> you<00:02:12.340> can<00:02:12.670> make<00:02:12.790> those<00:02:13.030> go<00:02:13.270> away<00:02:13.390> just<00:02:14.290> by

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
know you can make those go away just by

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:15.960 
know you can make those go away just by
pressing<00:02:14.650> and<00:02:14.980> holding<00:02:15.010> the<00:02:15.400> exit<00:02:15.790> button

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
pressing and holding the exit button

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.180 
pressing and holding the exit button
while<00:02:16.840> I<00:02:17.019> they<00:02:17.200> just<00:02:17.230> disappeared<00:02:17.920> I<00:02:18.010> got<00:02:18.160> a

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
while I they just disappeared I got a

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:19.770 
while I they just disappeared I got a
little<00:02:18.370> bit<00:02:18.550> more<00:02:18.580> screen<00:02:19.120> now<00:02:19.300> you<00:02:19.330> can<00:02:19.450> still

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
little bit more screen now you can still

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.240 
little bit more screen now you can still
see<00:02:19.930> what<00:02:20.080> my<00:02:20.200> Sirius<00:02:20.790> radio<00:02:21.790> channel<00:02:22.239> is<00:02:22.330> on

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
see what my Sirius radio channel is on

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.710 
see what my Sirius radio channel is on
and<00:02:24.250> that's<00:02:24.910> because<00:02:25.269> there's<00:02:25.480> a<00:02:25.540> little

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
and that's because there's a little

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.630 
and that's because there's a little
glitch<00:02:25.989> in<00:02:26.170> 3.5<00:02:26.560> which<00:02:27.040> just<00:02:27.310> came<00:02:27.459> out<00:02:27.610> a

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
glitch in 3.5 which just came out a

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.130 
glitch in 3.5 which just came out a
couple<00:02:27.880> of<00:02:28.000> weeks<00:02:28.180> ago<00:02:28.360> that<00:02:28.660> if<00:02:28.750> I<00:02:28.840> go<00:02:28.989> in<00:02:29.110> to

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
couple of weeks ago that if I go in to

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:34.170 
couple of weeks ago that if I go in to
try<00:02:29.349> to<00:02:29.380> kill<00:02:29.680> that<00:02:29.920> my<00:02:30.790> unit<00:02:32.310> reboots<00:02:33.310> and

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
try to kill that my unit reboots and

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:35.370 
try to kill that my unit reboots and
that's<00:02:34.330> going<00:02:34.480> to<00:02:34.569> be<00:02:34.660> fixed<00:02:34.870> in<00:02:35.050> the<00:02:35.110> next

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
that's going to be fixed in the next

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.920 
that's going to be fixed in the next
update<00:02:35.560> as<00:02:36.489> you<00:02:36.670> can<00:02:36.790> imagine<00:02:36.880> anytime<00:02:37.599> you<00:02:37.750> go

structure scan and radar and all those
other<00:02:45.760> things<00:02:46.090> there<00:02:46.720> are<00:02:46.989> some<00:02:47.290> challenges

other things there are some challenges
with<00:02:48.220> doing<00:02:48.549> it<00:02:48.670> you<00:02:48.819> don't<00:02:48.940> get<00:02:49.090> everything

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
with doing it you don't get everything

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.690 
with doing it you don't get everything
working<00:02:50.410> just<00:02:50.530> exactly<00:02:50.920> right<00:02:51.130> when<00:02:51.579> you'd

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
working just exactly right when you'd

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.280 
working just exactly right when you'd
like<00:02:51.819> to<00:02:51.880> have<00:02:52.120> it<00:02:52.239> working<00:02:52.540> exactly<00:02:52.900> right

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
like to have it working exactly right

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.339 
like to have it working exactly right
but<00:02:54.069> the<00:02:54.489> cool<00:02:54.700> thing<00:02:54.910> about<00:02:54.940> the<00:02:55.420> Lorentz

00:02:56.339 --> 00:02:56.349 
but the cool thing about the Lorentz

00:02:56.349 --> 00:03:00.030 
but the cool thing about the Lorentz
product<00:02:56.739> line<00:02:56.950> is<00:02:57.220> that<00:02:57.549> with<00:02:57.970> the<00:02:58.920> with<00:02:59.920> the
