so<00:00:14.400> let's<00:00:14.549> just<00:00:14.759> say<00:00:14.910> you've<00:00:15.089> built<00:00:15.360> your<00:00:15.450> car

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:15.980 
so let's just say you've built your car

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.849 
so let's just say you've built your car
it<00:00:16.980> way<00:00:17.190> for<00:00:17.699> this<00:00:17.820> car<00:00:18.119> I<00:00:18.150> built<00:00:18.600> a<00:00:18.859> 2007

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
it way for this car I built a 2007

Porsche 919 997 911 gt3 it weighed 30 51
on<00:00:27.060> pounds<00:00:27.510> and<00:00:27.689> it's<00:00:28.680> 38%<00:00:29.640> to<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:29.849> front

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
on pounds and it's 38% to the front

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.569 
on pounds and it's 38% to the front
the<00:00:31.260> car<00:00:31.529> is<00:00:31.769> downforce<00:00:32.640> equipped<00:00:33.120> but

00:00:34.569 --> 00:00:34.579 
the car is downforce equipped but

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:36.889 
the car is downforce equipped but
downforce<00:00:35.579> does<00:00:35.850> not<00:00:36.000> affect<00:00:36.360> your<00:00:36.510> Springs

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
downforce does not affect your Springs

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:42.319 
downforce does not affect your Springs
the<00:00:37.860> spring<00:00:39.170> fluctuation<00:00:40.170> is<00:00:41.149> depends<00:00:42.149> on<00:00:42.270> the

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
the spring fluctuation is depends on the

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.200 
the spring fluctuation is depends on the
mass<00:00:42.690> acting<00:00:43.260> on<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.500> spring<00:00:44.090> when<00:00:45.090> you

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
mass acting on the spring when you

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.020 
mass acting on the spring when you
introduce<00:00:45.600> force<00:00:45.989> you<00:00:46.800> just<00:00:47.100> smash<00:00:47.789> the

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
introduce force you just smash the

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.209 
introduce force you just smash the
spring<00:00:48.329> down<00:00:48.510> partway<00:00:49.020> all<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.590> time<00:00:49.800> but<00:00:50.100> the

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
spring down partway all the time but the

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.950 
spring down partway all the time but the
mass<00:00:50.430> acting<00:00:50.879> on<00:00:51.000> it<00:00:51.120> will<00:00:51.270> still<00:00:51.539> make<00:00:51.780> it

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
mass acting on it will still make it

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.970 
mass acting on it will still make it
bounce<00:00:52.829> at<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.250> same<00:00:53.460> speed<00:00:54.590> but<00:00:55.590> here's<00:00:55.829> the

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
bounce at the same speed but here's the

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.650 
bounce at the same speed but here's the
equation<00:00:56.180> two<00:00:57.180> pi<00:00:57.449> squared<00:00:58.969> times<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.449> mass

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
equation two pi squared times the mass

square of the time that you want it to
complete<00:01:08.670> a<00:01:08.700> cycle<00:01:08.970> you<00:01:09.330> know<00:01:09.420> how<00:01:09.570> a<00:01:09.600> spring

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
complete a cycle you know how a spring

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.800 
complete a cycle you know how a spring
will<00:01:10.260> bounce<00:01:10.500> down<00:01:10.920> and<00:01:11.790> then<00:01:11.909> up<00:01:12.090> and<00:01:12.720> then

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
will bounce down and then up and then

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.390 
will bounce down and then up and then
it'll<00:01:13.049> go<00:01:13.229> back<00:01:13.409> down<00:01:13.650> to<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:13.950> spot<00:01:14.189> where<00:01:14.369> it

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
it'll go back down to the spot where it

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.539 
it'll go back down to the spot where it
was<00:01:14.490> where<00:01:15.330> it<00:01:15.360> started<00:01:15.450> to<00:01:15.780> go<00:01:15.900> down<00:01:16.080> again

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:16.549 
was where it started to go down again

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:20.810 
was where it started to go down again
that<00:01:17.549> distance<00:01:18.030> of<00:01:18.180> time<00:01:18.420> is<00:01:19.460> the<00:01:20.460> time<00:01:20.640> you

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
that distance of time is the time you

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.660 
that distance of time is the time you
want<00:01:20.970> to<00:01:21.060> use<00:01:21.479> here<00:01:21.869> and<00:01:22.400> you<00:01:23.400> need<00:01:23.520> to

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
want to use here and you need to

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.490 
want to use here and you need to
remember<00:01:23.939> that<00:01:24.270> if<00:01:24.479> you<00:01:24.630> divide<00:01:24.990> it<00:01:25.170> by<00:01:25.200> a<00:01:25.380> half

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
remember that if you divide it by a half

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.080 
remember that if you divide it by a half
half<00:01:28.500> of<00:01:28.680> that<00:01:28.799> time<00:01:29.070> will<00:01:29.280> be<00:01:29.310> for<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.759> car<00:01:29.970> is

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
half of that time will be for the car is

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.990 
half of that time will be for the car is
starting<00:01:30.509> to<00:01:30.540> level<00:01:30.930> out<00:01:31.970> three-quarters<00:01:32.970> of

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
that will be at the peak of a bounce up

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.719 
that will be at the peak of a bounce up
and<00:01:36.320> one<00:01:37.320> quarter<00:01:37.619> that<00:01:37.979> will<00:01:38.159> be<00:01:38.280> when<00:01:38.610> the

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
and one quarter that will be when the

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.940 
and one quarter that will be when the
car<00:01:38.939> is<00:01:39.090> at<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.270> bottom<00:01:39.750> of<00:01:39.869> its<00:01:40.020> squish<00:01:42.950> for

me I recommend running 1.125 seconds for

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.760 
me I recommend running 1.125 seconds for
anything<00:01:49.560> that's<00:01:49.799> not<00:01:50.100> r1<00:01:50.850> for<00:01:51.149> r1<00:01:51.360> I<00:01:51.899> will<00:01:52.470> run

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
anything that's not r1 for r1 I will run

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:58.039 
anything that's not r1 for r1 I will run
one<00:01:53.640> or<00:01:54.000> even<00:01:54.920> 0.75<00:01:55.920> 0.75<00:01:56.540> is<00:01:57.540> a<00:01:57.659> little<00:01:57.899> bit

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
one or even 0.75 0.75 is a little bit

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.969 
one or even 0.75 0.75 is a little bit
high<00:01:58.229> but<00:01:59.299> some<00:02:00.299> some<00:02:01.110> cars<00:02:01.439> can<00:02:01.740> get<00:02:01.860> away

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
high but some some cars can get away

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.730 
high but some some cars can get away
with<00:02:02.219> them<00:02:02.369> not<00:02:02.579> all<00:02:02.610> of<00:02:02.790> them<00:02:03.469> to<00:02:04.469> get<00:02:04.619> the

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
with them not all of them to get the

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.050 
with them not all of them to get the
mass<00:02:05.780> its<00:02:06.780> weight<00:02:07.110> times<00:02:08.069> the<00:02:08.340> percent<00:02:08.700> front

mass its weight times the percent front

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.420 
mass its weight times the percent front
expressed<00:02:09.720> as<00:02:09.929> a<00:02:09.959> decimal<00:02:10.080> so<00:02:10.649> percent<00:02:11.190> front

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
expressed as a decimal so percent front

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.900 
expressed as a decimal so percent front
here<00:02:11.610> will<00:02:11.730> be

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
here will be

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
here will be
Oh<00:02:11.970> point<00:02:12.240> three<00:02:12.600> eight<00:02:12.800> times<00:02:13.800> 0.5<00:02:14.750> which<00:02:15.750> is

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
Oh point three eight times 0.5 which is

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.290 
Oh point three eight times 0.5 which is
dividing<00:02:16.410> by<00:02:16.590> two<00:02:16.730> because<00:02:17.730> you<00:02:17.850> have<00:02:18.030> two

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
dividing by two because you have two

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.900 
dividing by two because you have two
tires<00:02:18.630> so<00:02:19.320> we're<00:02:20.160> just<00:02:20.190> looking<00:02:20.640> for<00:02:20.670> the

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
tires so we're just looking for the

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.760 
tires so we're just looking for the
force<00:02:21.150> I<00:02:21.300> meant<00:02:21.480> one<00:02:21.660> tire<00:02:21.990> so<00:02:22.320> we<00:02:22.410> can<00:02:22.560> pick

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
force I meant one tire so we can pick

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.000 
force I meant one tire so we can pick
the<00:02:22.920> spring<00:02:23.280> for<00:02:23.580> one<00:02:23.730> time<00:02:23.970> and<00:02:24.240> then<00:02:25.200> the<00:02:25.320> 32

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
the spring for one time and then the 32

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.310 
the spring for one time and then the 32
is<00:02:26.360> factoring<00:02:27.360> out<00:02:27.540> gravity<00:02:28.940> weight<00:02:29.940> is

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:30.320 
is factoring out gravity weight is

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:37.370 
is factoring out gravity weight is
gravity<00:02:31.320> times<00:02:31.710> mass<00:02:34.010> so<00:02:35.010> you<00:02:35.900> have<00:02:36.900> to<00:02:37.080> divide

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
gravity times mass so you have to divide

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.240 
gravity times mass so you have to divide
weight<00:02:37.850> by<00:02:38.850> gravity<00:02:39.450> to<00:02:39.630> get<00:02:40.140> the<00:02:40.290> mass<00:02:40.440> here

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
weight by gravity to get the mass here

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.720 
weight by gravity to get the mass here
you<00:02:41.400> go

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
you go

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.090 
you go
and<00:02:42.020> then<00:02:43.020> for<00:02:43.410> the<00:02:43.500> rear<00:02:43.770> its<00:02:44.640> weight<00:02:45.480> times

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
and then for the rear its weight times

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:50.240 
and then for the rear its weight times
100<00:02:47.100> minus<00:02:47.400> percent<00:02:47.640> front<00:02:48.180> and<00:02:49.070> another<00:02:50.070> way

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
100 minus percent front and another way

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:56.870 
100 minus percent front and another way
to<00:02:50.280> express<00:02:50.700> this<00:02:51.060> is<00:02:52.040> 6,400<00:02:54.590> its<00:02:55.590> I<00:02:56.070> took<00:02:56.310> the

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
to express this is 6,400 its I took the

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.540 
to express this is 6,400 its I took the
factor<00:02:57.720> of<00:02:57.840> 1/2<00:02:58.320> and<00:02:58.470> put<00:02:58.680> it<00:02:58.770> over<00:02:58.860> here<00:02:59.280> and

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
factor of 1/2 and put it over here and

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:02.780 
factor of 1/2 and put it over here and
then<00:03:00.530> you<00:03:01.530> just<00:03:01.740> need<00:03:01.800> to<00:03:01.980> express<00:03:02.370> this<00:03:02.580> as<00:03:02.640> a

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
then you just need to express this as a

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.010 
then you just need to express this as a
decimal<00:03:02.880> so<00:03:03.390> if<00:03:03.810> your<00:03:03.990> car<00:03:04.170> is<00:03:04.200> 38%<00:03:05.070> front<00:03:06.020> then

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.020 
decimal so if your car is 38% front then

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:13.880 
decimal so if your car is 38% front then
you<00:03:07.650> know<00:03:07.860> that<00:03:08.280> it's<00:03:10.640> 62%<00:03:11.640> rear<00:03:12.800> simple<00:03:13.800> as

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
you know that it's 62% rear simple as

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:14.380 
you know that it's 62% rear simple as
that

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
that

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:16.699 
that
when<00:03:15.390> you<00:03:15.480> use<00:03:15.660> all<00:03:15.900> these<00:03:16.080> numbers<00:03:16.440> that<00:03:16.470> I've

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
when you use all these numbers that I've

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:21.230 
when you use all these numbers that I've
given<00:03:16.860> you<00:03:18.320> you<00:03:19.320> should<00:03:19.620> come<00:03:19.890> up<00:03:20.040> with<00:03:20.240> 565

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:21.240 
given you you should come up with 565

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:24.350 
given you you should come up with 565
pounds<00:03:21.270> for<00:03:21.930> the<00:03:22.020> front<00:03:22.290> and<00:03:22.940> 922<00:03:23.940> for<00:03:24.270> the

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
pounds for the front and 922 for the

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.330 
pounds for the front and 922 for the
rear<00:03:24.570> they<00:03:24.840> just<00:03:25.050> kind<00:03:25.260> of<00:03:25.350> round<00:03:25.620> that<00:03:25.920> way<00:03:26.100> a

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
rear they just kind of round that way a

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.610 
rear they just kind of round that way a
little<00:03:26.910> bit<00:03:27.180> of<00:03:27.300> the<00:03:27.570> little<00:03:27.810> bitty<00:03:27.990> decimal

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
little bit of the little bitty decimal

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.160 
little bit of the little bitty decimal
isn't<00:03:29.220> gonna<00:03:29.310> make<00:03:29.550> a<00:03:29.610> difference<00:03:30.170> just

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
isn't gonna make a difference just

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:32.960 
isn't gonna make a difference just
putting<00:03:31.920> it<00:03:32.040> out<00:03:32.160> there<00:03:32.220> don't<00:03:32.580> worry<00:03:32.820> about

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
putting it out there don't worry about

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:37.640 
putting it out there don't worry about
it<00:03:33.860> 10<00:03:34.860> percents<00:03:35.430> a<00:03:35.490> big<00:03:35.700> difference<00:03:36.180> and<00:03:36.650> 10%

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
it 10 percents a big difference and 10%

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.780 
it 10 percents a big difference and 10%
and<00:03:38.100> 922<00:03:38.970> is<00:03:39.360> a<00:03:39.390> lot<00:03:39.860> there's<00:03:40.860> a<00:03:40.980> lot<00:03:41.040> more<00:03:41.489> than

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
and 922 is a lot there's a lot more than

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.090 
and 922 is a lot there's a lot more than
the<00:03:42.090> little<00:03:42.300> 0.5<00:03:42.989> that's<00:03:43.260> gonna<00:03:43.380> be<00:03:43.590> stuck<00:03:43.920> out

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
the little 0.5 that's gonna be stuck out

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:48.949 
the little 0.5 that's gonna be stuck out
here<00:03:44.130> when<00:03:44.520> you<00:03:44.610> round<00:03:44.760> it<00:03:44.970> off<00:03:47.840> thanks<00:03:48.840> for

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
here when you round it off thanks for

here when you round it off thanks for
watching<00:03:49.290> and<00:03:49.820> you'll<00:03:50.820> see<00:03:51.030> what<00:03:51.180> this<00:03:51.300> is<00:03:51.360> my
