00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 hello better but neither on this nor the points 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.069
 main on the china theory a lot 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:10.950
 often there is the text the question 

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:13.650
 especially pumpkin when it was founded 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.690
 alterio mobile therefore a question 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.460
 as usual for all the others 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.100
 information to take the test I put 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.260
 registration linking if you have problems i 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.650
 doubts asks in the comments now let's see 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.269
 a cellular theory therefore what are i 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:31.019
 fundamental points fundamental points 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.450
 precisely to define the shooting cycle 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.420
 they are essentially three 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:38.100
 these three points came 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.719
 introduced by various scientists who 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.930
 in fact they studied a la 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:46.320
 in fact the cellular jury that 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:49.379
 what he says affirms practically various 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.539
 points first of all states that 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.600
 living beings are formed by one or more 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:57.780
 cells every sky in fact derives from one 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.600
 pre-existing cell and one in the cell is 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.190
 precisely an organizational unit and a 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.049
 tone but these are the main ones 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.260
 features 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:10.250
 the decline in cell phones came 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:15.180
 coined by English physicist Robert Hooke 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:18.090
 this happened in 1665 as it did 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.490
 to observe in this it is voted mild 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.619
 practically the microscope and observed 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.600
 of the cork effects booms 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.689
 cork what cork is 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.490
 remember that practically the portion 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.920
 external of the 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:35.220
 of the tree of the quercus 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.170
 suber that in fact forms this 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.479
 structure that precisely takes the number 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.040
 of exceeds and it is precisely then what 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.460
 it is used to make too many 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:47.729
 so he just looks at these 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:51.479
 thin slices of Sumerian look what 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:53.640
 he practically identical with some 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.979
 small structures that were anyway 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.549
 distinct from each other and that 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:03.569
 they seemed apparently empty 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:06.990
 and they looked like small cells from 

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:09.780
 here he defined the term 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.549
 precisely what cell I associate it with 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:15.470
 these issues not associated with the fact that 

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:18.500
 this excellent practically 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:22.650
 they looked like cells 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:24.690
 this is said of the gods practically 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.750
 monastic convents and therefore he himself 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:32.280
 with this term what did he do in 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:34.620
 actually a cook had observed not so much 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:37.859
 the cell but only the cell in 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:40.350
 toto but only the relative of 

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:42.459
 these cells dead cork cells 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:45.560
 so only the wall 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:48.170
 in fact they had not registered or gods 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.390
 organs and even less so the profit 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.909
 at the beginning on the cellular action you have to 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:56.540
 remember this aspect came precisely 

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:59.180
 described by hulk in 1665 describing 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:02.830
 of the ft cork fruit observed at 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:05.330
 microscope and did not observe just in 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:06.019
 nuclei or organs but will be the wall 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.010
 mobile phone 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:12.319
 so if you happen to antes what you need 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:14.329
 the cell wall the nucleus i 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:16.849
 organs you have to tell me a cellular part 

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:18.769
 don't get confused so this is the 

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:22.519
 first important historical point to be able to 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:24.859
 define the cell theory instead 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:27.170
 so let's remember some of that 

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:30.470
 not defined in the cinema as it is alive but 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:31.819
 just like cell phones to the point like 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:34.129
 essentially this structure 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:35.840
 particular the next step for the 

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:40.700
 definition of cell theory 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:43.430
 happens around precisely at 1800 1830 38 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:47.120
 and 39 what happened in these years 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:50.419
 practically in these years it goes down 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:54.290
 iphone thanks also to the fact that 

00:03:50.419 --> 00:03:58.299
 microscopes perfected what 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:04:01.480
 It just happens that these two happen 

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:04.459
 scientists who actually are 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:08.049
 considered the real authors of the 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:10.370
 a cellphone what they did 

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:12.130
 they identified the unit in the cell 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:14.900
 present in all living beings 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:17.180
 moon in vegetables and one in animals 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.420
 therefore in the seedlings the animals in the 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:21.210
 vegetable shine 

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:23.130
 so if to the test and ask you who it was 

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:25.200
 the real founder of the canvases 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:28.400
 cellular these two jean scientists 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:30.170
 in animals and shane in plants 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.430
 so this is the characteristic 

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:34.770
 essential 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:38.340
 finally the last fundamental step for 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:41.760
 being able to mint the cellular pulls happened 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:44.220
 when when the rude birkhoff that is 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:47.940
 practically considered the most doctor 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:49.110
 important of the nineteenth century when for 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:51.150
 example RAI studies 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:52.650
 some pathologies especially in 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:56.100
 general pathology you will find virco 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:59.010
 everywhere for example the signs of a 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:01.110
 inflammation was indeed introduced 

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:04.530
 from virus therefore really a genius of the 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:06.840
 in fact, remember that medicine 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:09.210
 was the pioneer of concepts from 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:10.770
 modern cellular pathology e 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:13.620
 especially from the pathogenesis of 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:15.870
 diseases therefore truly a genius for 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:17.340
 as far as the theory is concerned 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:18.690
 cell phone we saw that there are 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:20.700
 then these three points 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:26.070
 the last point I was telling myself about 

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:28.800
 collection has precisely ceased in 1855 and 

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:31.590
 what he did practically he concluded 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:34.740
 that every cell is practically born of 

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:36.210
 another cell for existing then for 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:36.990
 the mobile pulls you have to remember these 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:40.830
 three points 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:42.960
 cook discovered these cells that later 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:44.850
 they were the peers of the cell phones to which he gave 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:47.160
 the name point to choose because the 

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:50.340
 resembled what they were 

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:52.110
 excellent scenes are precisely thanks 

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:54.030
 to the improvement of microscopes 

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:55.770
 they just described that all the plants 

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:58.350
 all animals respectively are 

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:59.940
 formed by cells finally virco precisely 

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:02.760
 the third important historical stage 

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:07.350
 define precisely that the cells 

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:09.300
 they were indeed oven doors and derived from 

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:11.220
 pre existing cells so this is 

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:14.449
 this is what I always like 

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:15.979
 following decrees like me like me 

00:06:14.449 --> 00:06:18.710
 I won't wait for ten more mica 

00:06:15.979 --> 00:06:20.449
 channel to stay updated and see me 

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:21.710
 visit the inter registration because it is 

00:06:20.449 --> 00:06:22.909
 just find all the information 

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:25.210
 also to take the test 

00:06:22.909 --> 00:06:25.210
 bye, see you soon
