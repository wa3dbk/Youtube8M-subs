across the map here shortly don't have
to<00:01:14.189> really<00:01:14.340> worry<00:01:14.430> about<00:01:14.640> my<00:01:14.939> expansion<00:01:15.270> it's

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
to really worry about my expansion it's

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.270 
to really worry about my expansion it's
pretty<00:01:15.960> much<00:01:16.110> set<00:01:16.380> up<00:01:16.530> to<00:01:16.650> where<00:01:16.770> he<00:01:17.189> can

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
pretty much set up to where he can

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.990 
pretty much set up to where he can
defend<00:01:17.580> itself<00:01:18.140> if<00:01:19.140> they<00:01:19.350> attack<00:01:19.650> I<00:01:20.040> can<00:01:20.729> just

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
defend itself if they attack I can just

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.120 
defend itself if they attack I can just
bring<00:01:21.360> Maya<00:01:21.540> cities<00:01:21.869> over<00:01:22.110> ideal<00:01:22.409> so<00:01:22.860> here<00:01:23.040> he

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
bring Maya cities over ideal so here he

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.570 
bring Maya cities over ideal so here he
comes<00:01:23.340> and<00:01:23.759> he<00:01:23.820> shoot<00:01:24.720> away<00:01:25.369> he<00:01:26.369> has<00:01:26.549> a

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
comes and he shoot away he has a

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.090 
comes and he shoot away he has a
dropship<00:01:27.330> I<00:01:27.689> didn't<00:01:28.500> notice<00:01:28.619> that<00:01:28.890> in<00:01:29.040> the

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.180 
Marauders that's 400 minerals plus the
medevac<00:02:11.890> and<00:02:12.780> in<00:02:13.780> the<00:02:13.870> medevac<00:02:14.200> cost<00:02:14.500> gas<00:02:14.860> as

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
medevac and in the medevac cost gas as

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.300 
medevac and in the medevac cost gas as
well<00:02:15.220> so<00:02:15.760> that's<00:02:15.940> roughly<00:02:16.350> 500<00:02:17.350> resources

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
well so that's roughly 500 resources

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.110 
well so that's roughly 500 resources
lost<00:02:20.160> and<00:02:21.160> the<00:02:21.250> first<00:02:21.459> thing<00:02:21.640> you<00:02:21.760> want<00:02:21.910> to<00:02:21.970> do

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
lost and the first thing you want to do

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.449 
lost and the first thing you want to do
when<00:02:22.450> playing<00:02:22.959> against<00:02:23.380> anybody<00:02:23.860> Viet

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.100 
Terrans or Protoss cleanup expansions
yeah<00:02:30.190> right<00:02:30.489> now<00:02:30.640> I<00:02:30.670> could<00:02:31.060> run<00:02:31.390> into<00:02:31.510> his<00:02:31.810> main

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
yeah right now I could run into his main

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.110 
yeah right now I could run into his main
and<00:02:32.470> try<00:02:32.680> to<00:02:32.739> destroy<00:02:33.190> all<00:02:33.430> of<00:02:33.519> his<00:02:33.610> production

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
and try to destroy all of his production

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.030 
and try to destroy all of his production
buildings<00:02:34.480> but<00:02:34.690> seeing<00:02:34.959> that<00:02:35.170> won't<00:02:35.709> matter

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
buildings but seeing that won't matter

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.190 
buildings but seeing that won't matter
if<00:02:36.459> he<00:02:36.730> still<00:02:37.030> gets<00:02:37.239> the<00:02:37.329> resources<00:02:38.019> to

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
if he still gets the resources to

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:44.900 
if he still gets the resources to
rebuild<00:02:38.500> them<00:02:42.000> this<00:02:43.000> was<00:02:43.180> stupid<00:02:43.660> on<00:02:43.720> my<00:02:43.959> part

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
rebuild them this was stupid on my part

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.460 
rebuild them this was stupid on my part
should<00:02:45.910> have<00:02:46.000> had<00:02:46.150> some<00:02:46.540> air<00:02:46.780> unit<00:02:47.110> so<00:02:47.320> that<00:02:47.350> I

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
should have had some air unit so that I

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:48.930 
should have had some air unit so that I
could<00:02:47.560> see<00:02:47.920> up<00:02:48.070> onto<00:02:48.340> the<00:02:48.430> high<00:02:48.549> ground<00:02:48.790> and

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
could see up onto the high ground and

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.940 
could see up onto the high ground and
kill<00:02:49.180> that<00:02:49.209> tank<00:02:49.600> first<00:02:49.870> I<00:02:50.200> would<00:02:50.829> have

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
kill that tank first I would have

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.670 
kill that tank first I would have
certain<00:02:51.400> I<00:02:51.549> would<00:02:51.610> have<00:02:52.019> definitely<00:02:53.019> came<00:02:53.530> out

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
certain I would have definitely came out

00:02:53.680 --> 00:03:02.720 
certain I would have definitely came out
better<00:02:53.890> but<00:02:55.320> kind<00:02:56.320> of<00:02:56.440> live<00:02:56.739> and<00:02:56.920> learn

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
going to throw it on top of this video

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.650 
going to throw it on top of this video
anyway<00:03:21.000> so<00:03:22.000> that's<00:03:22.180> how<00:03:22.360> I<00:03:22.390> won<00:03:22.690> that<00:03:22.900> one<00:03:23.640> just

anyway so that's how I won that one just
starting<00:03:25.660> builds<00:03:26.050> are<00:03:26.200> important<00:03:27.180> unit

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
starting builds are important unit

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:29.759 
starting builds are important unit
placement<00:03:28.780> is<00:03:28.900> very<00:03:28.959> important<00:03:29.590> in<00:03:29.680> the

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:29.769 
placement is very important in the

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:32.970 
placement is very important in the
beginning<00:03:30.370> and<00:03:30.640> always<00:03:31.330> always<00:03:31.980> remember

that<00:03:33.010> bunkers<00:03:33.760> are<00:03:34.830> your<00:03:35.830> best<00:03:36.370> bet<00:03:37.000> against

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
that bunkers are your best bet against

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.039 
that bunkers are your best bet against
Reapers<00:03:38.290> or<00:03:38.620> zergling<00:03:39.459> rush<00:03:39.489> so<00:03:40.390> put<00:03:40.870> them

00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:41.049 
Reapers or zergling rush so put them

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:46.020 
Reapers or zergling rush so put them
where<00:03:41.319> it<00:03:41.470> counts<00:03:43.830> anyway<00:03:44.830> it's<00:03:45.489> only<00:03:45.670> second

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
where it counts anyway it's only second

still<00:03:47.920> learning<00:03:50.040> yeah<00:03:51.040> it's<00:03:51.220> pretty<00:03:51.370> much

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:51.580 
still learning yeah it's pretty much

game<00:03:51.910> think<00:03:52.480> I'm<00:03:52.599> going<00:03:52.780> to<00:03:53.970> in<00:03:54.970> this<00:03:55.569> video

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
game think I'm going to in this video

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:04.160 
game think I'm going to in this video
shortly<00:03:57.390> there's<00:03:58.390> me<00:03:58.599> a<00:03:58.630> medevac<00:03:59.110> right<00:03:59.349> there

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:06.720 

now<00:04:05.170> I<00:04:05.200> don't<00:04:05.319> see<00:04:05.680> job<00:04:05.890> my<00:04:06.040> siege<00:04:06.250> tanks

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730 
now I don't see job my siege tanks

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:10.080 
now I don't see job my siege tanks
because<00:04:06.959> their<00:04:07.959> attack<00:04:08.379> rate<00:04:08.620> is<00:04:08.879> double<00:04:09.879> when

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090 
because their attack rate is double when

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:12.750 
because their attack rate is double when
they're<00:04:10.209> not<00:04:10.390> sieged<00:04:11.189> unless<00:04:12.189> I<00:04:12.370> need<00:04:12.609> the

they're not sieged unless I need the
splash<00:04:13.000> damage<00:04:13.269> I<00:04:13.599> don't<00:04:13.840> see<00:04:14.019> ch<00:04:14.049> them<00:04:14.319> anyway

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:15.329 
splash damage I don't see ch them anyway
