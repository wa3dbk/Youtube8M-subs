all<00:02:55.060> right<00:02:55.239> now<00:02:55.420> that<00:02:55.450> the<00:02:55.719> vehicle<00:02:56.049> is<00:02:56.140> a

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
all right now that the vehicle is a

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:02.670 
all right now that the vehicle is a
temperature<00:02:56.969> start<00:02:57.969> the<00:02:58.090> measurement<00:03:01.680> it's

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
temperature start the measurement it's

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:15.290 
temperature start the measurement it's
gonna<00:03:02.859> go<00:03:03.129> through

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.300 

what<00:03:15.900> I<00:03:15.930> expect<00:03:16.500> to<00:03:16.620> see<00:03:16.650> is<00:03:16.890> that<00:03:17.010> it's

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
what I expect to see is that it's

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.180 
what I expect to see is that it's
basically<00:03:17.850> state<00:03:18.390> to<00:03:18.570> act<00:03:18.690> one<00:03:19.050> court<00:03:19.470> which

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
basically state to act one court which

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.580 
basically state to act one court which
is<00:03:20.370> from<00:03:20.580> the<00:03:20.730> bottom<00:03:21.030> to<00:03:21.210> the<00:03:21.270> top<00:03:21.390> now<00:03:22.230> since

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
is from the bottom to the top now since

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.950 
is from the bottom to the top now since
this<00:03:22.770> is<00:03:22.830> a<00:03:22.980> name<00:03:23.220> n6<00:03:23.940> we<00:03:24.090> create<00:03:24.390> the<00:03:24.600> engine

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:24.960 
this is a name n6 we create the engine

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:27.080 
this is a name n6 we create the engine
I'm<00:03:25.530> going<00:03:25.680> to<00:03:25.740> go<00:03:25.830> ahead<00:03:25.950> and<00:03:26.250> add<00:03:26.370> two<00:03:26.550> courts

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
I'm going to go ahead and add two courts

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.630 
I'm going to go ahead and add two courts
and<00:03:27.870> when<00:03:28.320> it<00:03:28.470> updates<00:03:28.860> it's<00:03:29.070> actually<00:03:29.490> not

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
and when it updates it's actually not

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.910 
and when it updates it's actually not
going<00:03:29.700> to<00:03:29.910> read<00:03:30.060> overfill<00:03:30.650> it's<00:03:31.650> going<00:03:31.860> to

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
going to read overfill it's going to

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.310 
going to read overfill it's going to
read<00:03:32.160> the<00:03:32.400> bill<00:03:32.640> full<00:03:33.120> level<00:03:33.540> and<00:03:34.050> then

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:34.320 
read the bill full level and then

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.020 
read the bill full level and then
basically<00:03:34.770> what<00:03:35.010> happens<00:03:35.400> is<00:03:35.520> that<00:03:35.730> you<00:03:35.850> can

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
basically what happens is that you can

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:37.670 
basically what happens is that you can
make<00:03:36.210> it<00:03:36.390> pretty<00:03:36.690> much<00:03:36.990> say<00:03:37.200> your<00:03:37.320> next<00:03:37.470> oil

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
make it pretty much say your next oil

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.300 
make it pretty much say your next oil
service<00:03:38.220> in<00:03:38.400> most<00:03:38.610> cases<00:03:38.910> or<00:03:39.710> you<00:03:40.710> know<00:03:41.070> cut

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
service in most cases or you know cut

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:46.580 
service in most cases or you know cut
your<00:03:41.340> top<00:03:41.700> off<00:03:41.970> requirement<00:03:45.080> the<00:03:46.080> oil<00:03:46.350> pan<00:03:46.560> is

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
your top off requirement the oil pan is

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.280 
your top off requirement the oil pan is
actually<00:03:47.340> larger<00:03:48.180> so<00:03:48.420> it<00:03:48.570> allows<00:03:48.870> for<00:03:49.170> the

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
actually larger so it allows for the

00:03:49.290 --> 00:04:09.910 
actually larger so it allows for the
extra<00:03:49.620> quart<00:03:49.860> of<00:03:49.920> oil

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:09.920 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.900 

yep<00:04:10.920> it's<00:04:11.610> actually<00:04:11.970> showing<00:04:12.180> red<00:04:13.910> below

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
yep it's actually showing red below

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:17.030 
yep it's actually showing red below
minimum<00:04:15.150> please<00:04:15.660> add<00:04:15.870> one<00:04:16.170> quart<00:04:16.530> of<00:04:16.709> engine

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:01.940 
and that was with two quarts and the

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:04.390 
and that was with two quarts and the
recommendation<00:07:02.720> for<00:07:03.170> the<00:07:03.470> iDrive<00:07:03.920> was<00:07:04.130> to<00:07:04.280> add

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:04.400 
recommendation for the iDrive was to add

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:06.820 
recommendation for the iDrive was to add
1<00:07:04.700> quart<00:07:05.060> so<00:07:05.660> realistically<00:07:06.230> if<00:07:06.440> you<00:07:06.560> have<00:07:06.710> the

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:06.830 
1 quart so realistically if you have the

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:07.600 
1 quart so realistically if you have the
n63

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:07.610 
n63

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:11.470 
n63
2<00:07:07.940> quarts<00:07:08.300> and<00:07:08.540> then<00:07:09.970> hopefully<00:07:10.970> you<00:07:11.270> can<00:07:11.420> make

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:11.480 
2 quarts and then hopefully you can make

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:13.420 
2 quarts and then hopefully you can make
it<00:07:11.780> until<00:07:12.080> the<00:07:12.200> next<00:07:12.470> oil<00:07:12.620> service<00:07:13.100> without

it until the next oil service without

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:16.780 
it until the next oil service without
having<00:07:13.880> to<00:07:14.150> come<00:07:14.480> in<00:07:14.630> for<00:07:14.840> a<00:07:14.900> top-up<00:07:15.440> or<00:07:16.400> adding

having to come in for a top-up or adding

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:20.120 
additional oil now with the turbocharger

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:22.450 
additional oil now with the turbocharger
system<00:07:20.690> you're<00:07:21.470> always<00:07:21.650> going<00:07:21.950> to<00:07:21.980> be<00:07:22.040> using
