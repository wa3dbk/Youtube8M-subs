00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:06.380
 hello friends and friends today we are going to do 

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:08.059
 a hairstyle is very easy to do is 

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:10.190
 very simple and I think it can serve 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:13.550
 for those occasions where we want 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:18.219
 see us formal but not so arranged 

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:18.219
 then we start watching this video 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:27.530
 divide your hair 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:33.050
 leave a large separate section for 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:35.720
 do the loaded in the back 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:38.350
 I take a section of hair and pick it up 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.350
 with a rubber 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.960
 with an exfoliating comb starts at 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.960
 load 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:52.430
 you should put your hair up and 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:55.070
 start tangling your hair towards 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:58.520
 down as you download it you go 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:01.330
 putting lacquer to make this better 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.330
 it is not painful 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.430
 if you asked yourself so we did the 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.590
 pigtail from behind you will see that it is ponytail 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.810
 helps to hold the carding because the 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.170
 pins did not fall over the course 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.170
 of the day 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.310
 with the front hair we do what 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:26.330
 next first we have and we apply 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.330
 pretty lacquer 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:32.330
 This section of the hair is divided into 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:36.550
 two and we make a knot and with the hair 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.550
 Too many we keep making more knots 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:43.020
 when you finish you put a pin 

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:43.020
 so that it is not 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.590
 on the other side you do the same 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.900
 so that you do not see so many hooks in 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:14.270
 the heads the lateral knots that 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.610
 we did we fastened them with a rubber 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.920
 small 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.230
 and to cover the rubber you can use 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.970
 accessories as apply seeds and 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.680
 bright pins though what 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.270
 you want me to convince you to do 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.620
 more accessories write less 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:31.500
 comments 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.510
 to finish I raised my fringe and 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.090
 giving her the tips of my hair though 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:38.599
 it was already very grow but this is 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.599
 optional 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:57.200
 when you are going to release it, untangle it 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:59.900
 with dry hair do not get into the 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:02.050
 shower and throw yourself shampoo with hair like that 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:05.060
 because they are going to mistreat him a lot 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:07.670
 unraveled with a comb as they are 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:10.790
 no brushes or anything these things with 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:12.410
 a comb and with dry hair then 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:14.660
 if you leave it you apply the 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:17.989
 conditioner and what you do all the 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:21.200
