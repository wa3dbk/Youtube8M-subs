00:00:04.809 --> 00:00:09.469
 today a technical part that puts 

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:12.160
 not related to gear but related to 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:15.169
 hydration and nutrition 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:18.740
 before during and after so we saw it 

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:20.030
 already in a section with bob that the 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:22.250
 feeding care was starting well 

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:22.940
 upstream so you advise us to 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.090
 three products 

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:28.520
 so yes it's one of the parties 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:31.220
 the most important ones actually we will see 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:32.440
 the dietary aspect and diet that 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.489
 will start already during the preparation 

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:35.989
 very important because the marathoner 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:37.220
 must test everything before his marathon 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:38.750
 ah yes that's it then it's a story 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:39.860
 also of taste and assimilation it is 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.239
 exactly because there is so much taste 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.070
 and then there are stronger products 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:45.020
 but less strong so the marathoner must 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.350
 really tried everything before there before the 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.420
 D-Day 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.100
 so we'll have at first 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.550
 hydration aspect so you go 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:54.199
 have drinks to consume during 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.640
 steps of preparation so the 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:57.410
 efforts a little long successes harvested 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.890
 on the loing essentially exactly 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.899
 so 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.579
 generally we will talk more about the 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.170
 marathon it will take the drink to 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.820
 consume three days before agree 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.530
 to really redo the reserves 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.240
 energetic so three days before 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.190
 we put ourselves 750 thousand liters so a 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.750
 big big blunder so what a dosage 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:13.860
 is already pre-defined to the advanced 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.420
 and then we add you is just 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.070
 water and at that moment where lived a 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.690
 gourd a day three days before 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.460
 since today but it is 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:22.140
 easily everything is easily seen 8 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.909
 that's no problem at the braids 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.140
 easily by kept very important 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.000
 so you see it's really going on the look 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.100
 before the effort before the effort of the day 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.659
 i then you to see and review the aspect 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.399
 so during the effort and after the effort 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.289
 so there's just right before 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:36.330
 forums you told me we can eat 

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:37.649
 things just before the departure of the muy well 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.990
 So Stephane sure we will see the 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:41.520
 bars so I often advocate 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.500
 bars for people who usually have 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.119
 a little bit a little stress etc which 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.470
 have trouble eating in the morning there are 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.640
 bars that can be consumed until just 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.869
 before the righteous just before the start 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.920
 therefore of 3.8 to sell before departure 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.869
 that he would have no impact so 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.210
 it's magnesium-based storeroom is 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.500
 very rich in cereals so that's enough 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.640
 it's pretty light but we can 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.140
 consume just before departure and that 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.119
 do not worry so his target he comes 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.560
 and it is digested well there is no 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.640
 concern for the marathoner who 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.600
 stress a little before from 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.950
 of Accor 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.689
 he will find his account on it and not 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.399
 worry very well so that was for the 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.840
 bars then we'll see the gels that 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.000
 are very important so during 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.410
 the effort during the effort but we will 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.480
 to have one that we will take before 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.000
 the effort which in my opinion one of the most 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.860
 important then this one who that me and 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.410
 choose the antioxidant on this 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:25.260
 magnesium so they really optimize 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.280
 muscle functioning so we're going 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.720
 avoid all that is cramps and fat 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.760
 muscle fatigue we will start it 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.769
 take it three quarters of an hour before 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.030
 departure until the moment of departure 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:34.380
 consume at really small 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.160
 quantities we play a little bit with in 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.410
 mouth etc 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:40.410
 on the other hand with very important water 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.299
 it goes beyond me softly 5000 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.010
 this moment and we finished his little 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:45.600
 pipette exactly not exactly 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.549
 this is what is going to avoid taking 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.140
 take months it's called that 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:51.180
 is called how this project 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.720
 the antioxidant an antioxidant gel on 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.519
 this magnesium 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.100
 so that will also avoid taking 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:57.750
 thaw on the first 10 kilometers 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:59.970
 we will start the next giant between 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.739
 10th and 15th km then we will take on 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.579
 will go on thaw like those who 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:04.079
 are already mixed 

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:05.459
 they are already told that they of his life of 

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:06.660
 drink at the same time okay we can 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:07.890
 review a little bit anyway we can 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.640
 see you again a little bit but that we 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.200
 can avoid drinking 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.100
 so we will see that they will be in 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.020
 advocating taking every 5 km 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.180
 okay that's important so there 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:17.860
 it's ceda food for the muscles 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.250
 that's exactly whose class based on 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.480
 carbohydrates 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.640
 he is everything I need 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.770
 inside and that's learning all 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.030
 the 5 km so that's the team of 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:27.680
 liquid freezes from the effort 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.020
 exactly then we'll see one who 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:32.120
 can be very interesting it's the stroke 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:34.010
 whip to share it on the water if the 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.630
 liquids so the already mixed up good after 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:37.790
 always be careful the taste because 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:38.600
 that you really have to choose this one 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.700
 it's the whiplash and so it's 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.900
 generally learn when when 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.430
 feel that it's going to be a fair bit 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.930
 went a little too fast that we hurt 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:47.990
 managed the effort so not necessarily to the 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:49.760
 end then not necessarily in the end have 

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:51.140
 usually one is enough because after 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.790
 I think this rate will not support 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:54.350
 but really take this one we're going 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:55.250
 say pass the half marathon to 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:56.420
 around the 25th 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.940
 okay we know it's going to start 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:00.560
 difficult on the bar of the 30th not that 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.270
 we will have something else but in 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.500
 passing submitted around the 25th on 

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:04.610
 can say prevent with a little bit of 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.550
 whip okay to give yourself a little 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:09.650
 little bit know how to suffer before 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:10.730
 the wall and then really in case of 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:12.440
 last resort I advise me 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:14.300
 always a little caffeine gel okay 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.980
 so except for here is a little 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:17.090
 exciting stimulating and super powerful 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:20.329
 have only as the brand said which 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:21.680
 75 or 75 mg of caffeine against it by 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:23.450
 it's really to keep on oneself in case 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.710
 of last resort to learn in the 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:25.940
 five or six years ago said m when we 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:28.160
 know more about what's called we know more 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:29.390
 we agree on the caffeine point and the sq 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.520
 on arrival it's a lot of people 

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:33.110
 in the pocket all that we happen a lot 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:36.080
 of world in the pocket and but to my 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:39.070
 notice if necessary ok ok careï 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.070
 thanks thanks
