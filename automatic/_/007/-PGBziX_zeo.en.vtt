excited today to show you a different
kind<00:00:29.530> of<00:00:29.590> tech<00:00:29.800> for<00:00:30.010> a<00:00:30.040> change<00:00:30.310> I've<00:00:30.730> been

kind of tech for a change I've been

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.120 
kind of tech for a change I've been
going<00:00:31.240> around<00:00:31.420> and<00:00:31.690> using<00:00:32.140> the<00:00:32.290> giggle<00:00:32.770> if<00:00:32.890> and

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:33.130 
going around and using the giggle if and

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:34.440 
going around and using the giggle if and
cook<00:00:33.310> it<00:00:33.340> out<00:00:33.520> neck<00:00:33.760> a<00:00:33.790> little<00:00:33.970> bit<00:00:34.090> too<00:00:34.300> much

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:34.450 
cook it out neck a little bit too much

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:35.760 
cook it out neck a little bit too much
so<00:00:34.690> I<00:00:34.750> figured<00:00:35.050> you<00:00:35.140> know<00:00:35.290> something<00:00:35.620> let<00:00:35.740> me

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:35.770 
so I figured you know something let me

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:37.500 
so I figured you know something let me
play<00:00:36.010> single<00:00:36.430> player<00:00:36.460> mode<00:00:36.880> because<00:00:37.120> I<00:00:37.450> know

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:37.510 
play single player mode because I know

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:39.930 
play single player mode because I know
that<00:00:37.960> until<00:00:38.140> I<00:00:38.320> have<00:00:38.530> enough<00:00:38.800> cards<00:00:39.190> to<00:00:39.670> build

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:39.940 
that until I have enough cards to build

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:41.910 
that until I have enough cards to build
up<00:00:40.120> my<00:00:40.239> black<00:00:40.570> soy<00:00:40.780> celoso<00:00:41.290> deck<00:00:41.500> that<00:00:41.680> my

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:41.920 
up my black soy celoso deck that my

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.560 
up my black soy celoso deck that my
options<00:00:42.460> to<00:00:42.610> creating<00:00:43.000> different<00:00:43.210> kind<00:00:43.480> of

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:43.570 
options to creating different kind of

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:45.630 
options to creating different kind of
decks<00:00:43.809> will<00:00:43.989> be<00:00:44.140> limited<00:00:44.350> so<00:00:44.739> I<00:00:44.980> figured<00:00:45.280> out<00:00:45.370> k

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:45.640 
decks will be limited so I figured out k

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.190 
decks will be limited so I figured out k
single<00:00:46.150> player<00:00:46.300> gives<00:00:46.510> you<00:00:46.600> like<00:00:46.809> different

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:47.200 
single player gives you like different

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.990 
single player gives you like different
themes<00:00:47.410> and<00:00:47.680> we<00:00:47.739> just<00:00:47.920> mix<00:00:48.100> that<00:00:48.190> up<00:00:48.340> so<00:00:48.700> we're

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:49.000 
themes and we just mix that up so we're

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.700 
themes and we just mix that up so we're
here<00:00:49.270> against<00:00:49.510> a<00:00:49.600> computerized<00:00:50.140> opponent<00:00:50.650> in

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:50.710 
here against a computerized opponent in

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:52.500 
here against a computerized opponent in
single<00:00:51.070> player<00:00:51.100> mode<00:00:51.489> and<00:00:51.970> i'm<00:00:52.150> using<00:00:52.420> the

and energy attached to that you know I'm
looking<00:01:50.680> out<00:01:50.770> for<00:01:50.829> that<00:01:51.070> so<00:01:51.640> he<00:01:52.000> packs<00:01:52.299> me<00:01:52.479> for

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:52.659 
looking out for that so he packs me for

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:55.200 
looking out for that so he packs me for
10<00:01:52.869> more<00:01:53.049> damage<00:01:53.469> racks<00:01:53.770> up<00:01:53.979> 20<00:01:54.280> in<00:01:54.310> total<00:01:54.729> so<00:01:55.180> I

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210 
10 more damage racks up 20 in total so I

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.120

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
see what i got here i get a fire energy

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.570 
see what i got here i get a fire energy
which<00:02:56.930> is<00:02:57.050> always<00:02:57.290> great<00:02:57.500> and<00:02:57.890> he<00:02:58.190> brings<00:02:58.370> in

batang<00:02:58.970> now<00:02:59.270> I'm<00:02:59.510> Italian<00:02:59.840> does<00:03:00.080> an<00:03:00.290> attack

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:00.740 
batang now I'm Italian does an attack

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:02.950 
batang now I'm Italian does an attack
that<00:03:01.070> deals<00:03:01.670> 50<00:03:02.060> base<00:03:02.300> if<00:03:02.540> i'm<00:03:02.690> not<00:03:02.810> mistaken

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:02.960 
that deals 50 base if i'm not mistaken

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.680 
that deals 50 base if i'm not mistaken
so<00:03:03.560> he<00:03:03.680> goes<00:03:03.800> to<00:03:03.920> the<00:03:03.950> copycat<00:03:04.490> draws<00:03:05.180> one<00:03:05.450> more

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
so he goes to the copycat draws one more

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:07.480 
so he goes to the copycat draws one more
extra<00:03:05.930> car<00:03:06.230> because<00:03:06.530> i<00:03:06.560> have<00:03:06.860> three<00:03:07.280> as

hoping for nine tails i could just use
that<00:05:26.660> heat<00:05:27.020> acceleration<00:05:27.800> and<00:05:28.010> get<00:05:28.550> my

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:28.730 
that heat acceleration and get my

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:31.330 
that heat acceleration and get my
energies<00:05:29.210> back<00:05:29.510> but<00:05:29.900> it<00:05:30.020> will<00:05:30.140> require<00:05:30.340> me

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:31.340 
energies back but it will require me

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:33.040 
energies back but it will require me
