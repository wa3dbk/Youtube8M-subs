00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
container push each of your tiles down

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.849 
container push each of your tiles down
firmly<00:00:57.329> and<00:00:57.870> make<00:00:57.930> sure<00:00:58.649> they're<00:00:58.829> not

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
firmly and make sure they're not

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.200 
firmly and make sure they're not
touching<00:00:59.280> each<00:00:59.609> other<00:00:59.820> you<00:01:00.000> need<00:01:00.149> a

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
touching each other you need a

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.810 
touching each other you need a
reasonable<00:01:00.719> gap<00:01:01.109> between<00:01:01.440> each<00:01:01.920> tile<00:01:02.280> so<00:01:02.640> that

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
reasonable gap between each tile so that

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.660 
reasonable gap between each tile so that
they're<00:01:03.000> strong<00:01:03.329> enough<00:01:03.539> to<00:01:03.719> use<00:01:03.750> as<00:01:04.110> a<00:01:04.140> mold

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
they're strong enough to use as a mold

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.219 
they're strong enough to use as a mold
you'll<00:01:05.670> see<00:01:05.909> here<00:01:06.180> all<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.479> air<00:01:06.689> bubbles<00:01:06.720> are

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
you'll see here all the air bubbles are

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.929 
you'll see here all the air bubbles are
rising<00:01:07.470> to<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:07.799> top<00:01:08.130> which<00:01:08.369> is<00:01:08.400> why<00:01:08.670> we've<00:01:08.820> put

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
rising to the top which is why we've put

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.399 
rising to the top which is why we've put
the<00:01:09.060> tiles<00:01:09.299> at<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.600> base<00:01:09.900> of<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.290> container

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
the tiles at the base of the container

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.800 
the tiles at the base of the container
if<00:01:10.920> you<00:01:11.400> put<00:01:11.580> them<00:01:11.670> on<00:01:11.790> top<00:01:12.030> you'd<00:01:12.270> get<00:01:12.450> bubbles

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
if you put them on top you'd get bubbles

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.310 
if you put them on top you'd get bubbles
in<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.049> mold<00:01:13.320> rather<00:01:13.560> than<00:01:13.860> a<00:01:13.950> smooth<00:01:14.310> finish

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320 
in the mold rather than a smooth finish

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.899 
in the mold rather than a smooth finish
leave<00:01:16.320> it<00:01:16.470> to<00:01:16.590> cool<00:01:16.799> and<00:01:16.860> set<00:01:17.280> this<00:01:17.460> can<00:01:17.670> take<00:01:17.880> a

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
leave it to cool and set this can take a

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.460 
leave it to cool and set this can take a
couple<00:01:18.150> of<00:01:18.299> hours<00:01:18.630> but<00:01:18.750> you<00:01:18.840> can<00:01:18.990> put<00:01:19.140> it<00:01:19.229> into

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
couple of hours but you can put it into

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.190 
couple of hours but you can put it into
the<00:01:19.590> fridge<00:01:19.860> to<00:01:19.920> speed<00:01:20.460> up<00:01:20.640> that<00:01:20.670> process<00:01:21.200> then

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
the fridge to speed up that process then

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.260 
the fridge to speed up that process then
take<00:01:22.470> it<00:01:22.619> out<00:01:22.710> of<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:23.009> container<00:01:23.369> flip<00:01:24.150> it

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
take it out of the container flip it

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.320 
take it out of the container flip it
over<00:01:24.420> and<00:01:24.720> put<00:01:25.140> on<00:01:25.320> each<00:01:25.590> edge<00:01:26.009> of<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.430> tile<00:01:26.759> to

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
over and put on each edge of the tile to

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.539 
over and put on each edge of the tile to
release<00:01:27.720> it<00:01:27.930> from<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.229> mold<00:01:28.619> and<00:01:28.860> you<00:01:29.189> can<00:01:29.340> see

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
release it from the mold and you can see

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.310 
release it from the mold and you can see
there<00:01:29.790> we've<00:01:29.909> got<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.210> letter<00:01:30.479> imprint<00:01:31.140> on

rack you'll need a skinny container with
tall<00:02:07.890> sides<00:02:08.310> I<00:02:08.670> didn't<00:02:09.300> have<00:02:09.479> one<00:02:09.720> suitable<00:02:10.200> so

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
tall sides I didn't have one suitable so

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.650 
tall sides I didn't have one suitable so
I<00:02:10.410> just<00:02:10.619> made<00:02:10.890> one<00:02:11.099> out<00:02:11.129> of<00:02:11.250> foil<00:02:11.610> and<00:02:11.849> twisted

I just made one out of foil and twisted

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.910 
I just made one out of foil and twisted
the<00:02:12.780> ends<00:02:13.020> together<00:02:13.170> so<00:02:13.440> the

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
the ends together so the

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.660 
the ends together so the
leaked<00:02:14.430> out<00:02:14.990> put<00:02:15.990> the<00:02:16.140> tile<00:02:16.410> holder<00:02:17.130> into<00:02:17.580> the

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
leaked out put the tile holder into the

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.030 
leaked out put the tile holder into the
container<00:02:18.120> and<00:02:18.420> pour<00:02:18.989> the<00:02:19.260> molding<00:02:19.590> gel<00:02:19.770> over

container and pour the molding gel over
the<00:02:20.160> top<00:02:20.430> if<00:02:20.730> it<00:02:21.090> starts<00:02:21.420> to<00:02:21.480> float<00:02:21.840> just<00:02:22.110> push

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
the top if it starts to float just push

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.750 
the top if it starts to float just push
it<00:02:22.410> back<00:02:22.440> down<00:02:22.620> and<00:02:23.040> hold<00:02:23.250> it<00:02:23.400> for<00:02:23.520> a<00:02:23.610> moment

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
it back down and hold it for a moment

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.210 
it back down and hold it for a moment
until<00:02:24.209> it<00:02:24.360> stays<00:02:24.660> if<00:02:25.080> it's<00:02:25.500> hollow<00:02:25.709> underneath

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
until it stays if it's hollow underneath

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.860 
until it stays if it's hollow underneath
like<00:02:26.430> mine<00:02:26.670> just<00:02:26.880> allow<00:02:27.209> it<00:02:27.300> to<00:02:27.450> fill<00:02:27.720> up

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
like mine just allow it to fill up

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.740 
like mine just allow it to fill up
because<00:02:28.170> we<00:02:28.290> can<00:02:28.440> get<00:02:28.620> that<00:02:28.770> out<00:02:28.950> afterwards

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
because we can get that out afterwards

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.780 
because we can get that out afterwards
once<00:02:30.750> it's<00:02:30.959> completely<00:02:31.470> set<00:02:31.739> feel<00:02:32.400> off<00:02:32.610> all

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
once it's completely set feel off all

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.120 
once it's completely set feel off all
the<00:02:32.910> foil<00:02:33.209> and<00:02:33.450> then<00:02:33.930> run<00:02:34.170> a<00:02:34.200> knife<00:02:34.530> along<00:02:34.950> the

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
the foil and then run a knife along the

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.330 
the foil and then run a knife along the
top<00:02:35.340> edge<00:02:35.720> pull<00:02:36.720> on<00:02:36.930> each<00:02:37.290> side<00:02:37.650> to<00:02:37.920> release<00:02:38.069> it

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
top edge pull on each side to release it

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.990 
top edge pull on each side to release it
from<00:02:38.370> the<00:02:38.550> mold<00:02:38.790> and<00:02:39.030> take<00:02:39.450> the<00:02:39.660> tile<00:02:39.900> rack<00:02:40.140> out

from the mold and take the tile rack out

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.370 
from the mold and take the tile rack out
