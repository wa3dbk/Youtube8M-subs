00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 
tab which i think is not going to be the

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.309 
tab which i think is not going to be the
same<00:03:12.970> thing<00:03:13.180> because<00:03:13.420> I<00:03:13.510> feel<00:03:13.720> like<00:03:13.750> the<00:03:14.110> hair

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:14.319 
same thing because I feel like the hair

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:16.680 
same thing because I feel like the hair
up<00:03:14.410> here<00:03:14.620> is<00:03:14.739> just<00:03:14.920> taking<00:03:15.790> its<00:03:16.030> time<00:03:16.209> to<00:03:16.450> grow

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
up here is just taking its time to grow

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:29.430 
up here is just taking its time to grow
which<00:03:17.620> is<00:03:17.769> fine

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.220 

and<00:03:30.010> it's<00:03:30.220> not<00:03:30.430> it's<00:03:30.730> also<00:03:31.060> eight<00:03:31.510> and<00:03:31.780> a

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
and it's not it's also eight and a

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.380 
and it's not it's also eight and a
quarter<00:03:32.470> so<00:03:32.890> basically<00:03:33.430> all<00:03:33.730> the<00:03:34.150> way<00:03:34.240> around

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:34.390 
quarter so basically all the way around

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:36.780 
quarter so basically all the way around
I<00:03:35.040> don't<00:03:36.040> know<00:03:36.100> how<00:03:36.190> that<00:03:36.220> happened<00:03:36.400> because

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
I don't know how that happened because

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.510 
I don't know how that happened because
when<00:03:37.000> I<00:03:37.030> did<00:03:37.270> do<00:03:37.510> my<00:03:38.110> big<00:03:38.320> chop<00:03:38.560> at<00:03:38.770> my<00:03:39.220> hair<00:03:39.400> was

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:39.520 
when I did do my big chop at my hair was

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.690 
when I did do my big chop at my hair was
a<00:03:39.550> little<00:03:39.670> bit<00:03:40.030> I<00:03:40.210> think<00:03:40.480> uneven<00:03:41.020> like<00:03:41.140> it<00:03:41.290> was

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
a little bit I think uneven like it was

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.460 
a little bit I think uneven like it was
longer<00:03:42.700> on<00:03:42.910> top<00:03:43.150> and<00:03:43.300> it<00:03:43.390> wasn't<00:03:43.630> a<00:03:43.690> size<00:03:43.900> but

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
longer on top and it wasn't a size but

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.620 
longer on top and it wasn't a size but
right<00:03:44.620> now<00:03:44.800> basically<00:03:45.760> my<00:03:46.030> whole<00:03:46.060> head<00:03:46.510> is

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:46.630 
right now basically my whole head is

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:49.140 
right now basically my whole head is
averaging<00:03:47.170> around<00:03:47.350> eight<00:03:48.250> eight<00:03:48.760> and<00:03:49.120> a

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
averaging around eight eight and a

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.680 
averaging around eight eight and a
quarter<00:03:49.390> so<00:03:50.910> I'm<00:03:51.910> going<00:03:51.970> to<00:03:52.120> start<00:03:52.210> doing<00:03:52.480> with

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 
quarter so I'm going to start doing with

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:53.940 
quarter so I'm going to start doing with
the<00:03:52.780> measuring<00:03:53.110> tape<00:03:53.140> I<00:03:53.440> think<00:03:53.650> it's<00:03:53.770> more

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950 
the measuring tape I think it's more

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:57.870 
the measuring tape I think it's more
beneficial<00:03:54.900> and<00:03:55.900> official<00:03:56.440> to<00:03:57.340> do<00:03:57.520> it<00:03:57.670> that

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:57.880 
beneficial and official to do it that

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:01.290 
beneficial and official to do it that
way<00:03:58.120> i<00:03:58.300> can<00:03:58.360> actually<00:03:58.720> really<00:03:59.170> track<00:03:59.800> how<00:04:00.310> much

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:01.300
