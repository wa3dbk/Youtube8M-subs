I<00:00:24.240> think<00:00:24.510> if<00:00:24.660> you're<00:00:24.779> judging<00:00:25.050> on<00:00:25.350> strength

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
I think if you're judging on strength

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.980 
I think if you're judging on strength
and<00:00:25.890> arm<00:00:26.130> accuracy<00:00:26.970> you<00:00:27.210> like<00:00:27.420> Tripp<00:00:27.689> and<00:00:27.869> I

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
and arm accuracy you like Tripp and I

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.660 
and arm accuracy you like Tripp and I
think<00:00:28.230> if<00:00:28.410> you're<00:00:28.500> judging<00:00:28.769> arm<00:00:29.099> strength<00:00:29.429> and

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
think if you're judging arm strength and

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.939 
think if you're judging arm strength and
arm<00:00:29.849> accuracy<00:00:30.720> you<00:00:30.929> like<00:00:31.140> Tripp<00:00:31.439> and<00:00:31.590> I<00:00:31.710> think

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
arm accuracy you like Tripp and I think

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.290 
arm accuracy you like Tripp and I think
if<00:00:32.130> you're<00:00:32.250> judging<00:00:32.489> arm<00:00:32.850> strength

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
if you're judging arm strength

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.360 
if you're judging arm strength
and<00:00:33.420> arm<00:00:33.600> accuracy<00:00:34.440> you<00:00:34.680> like<00:00:34.890> trash<00:00:35.160> yeah<00:00:35.309> I
