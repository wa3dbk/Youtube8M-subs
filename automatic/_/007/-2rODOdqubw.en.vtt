00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.419
 info 

00:00:06.609 --> 00:00:09.419
 re 

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:13.130
 tan 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.910
 Domo Hello 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:21.800
 Mystery 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.130
 It is today 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.930
 boiling 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:29.400
 In terms of landing net magnet tune 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:31.940
 Say is what a stiff 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.240
 It is a thing but 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:37.350
 Oh yeah 

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:39.500
 It is called Cheeza 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.340
 Well this 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.340
 I usually 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:50.950
 I'd net you are using it is on and do RikuPPari of excerpt 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:53.579
 As you can see it is Iso dumpling 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:54.770
 Churros It is no good with this day 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:59.120
 so 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:01.300
 Hot ground point to wintering Well day in Paris 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.400
 You 're walking 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:06.740
 Red little 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:08.330
 Ekko this part will be 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.930
 Oh 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:17.610
 That thing that you miss 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:19.120
 Well, that 's right, I just want to do that 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:23.700
 1 o 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:29.120
 Charged with magnet in it is a part 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:30.640
 I think I will try to increase the holding power 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:33.090
 When 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.380
 Well to use 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.560
 Entrance 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.920
 Well then 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.920
 Follow 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:45.220
 With super powerful sound 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:50.110
 It is a tiny magnet 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:53.390
 I will 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:55.010
 About 6 mm in diameter 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.890
 To me Well 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:01.040
 From the size 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:01.790
 I think some people will understand it somehow 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.890
 me 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:08.440
 It is neo order 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:11.600
 March vehicles are cooperation and this 100 average 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:15.470
 I use a few of them 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:22.520
 In that it can be obtained in the hundred mean 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:23.150
 Well I think it is very thankful to poor anglers I want to use this 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:23.960
 I'm sorry 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.690
 so 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.810
 Well after that 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:30.080
 Hey you 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.710
 And this and later glue 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.830
 adhesive 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:38.180
 A little fact that that 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:42.880
 It is a momentary enteric agent jelly type 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:46.990
 I used only this time but this time 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:50.319
 Toma a shock if it is true 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:52.300
 Considering that even if it gets wet 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:54.620
 Suitable for it 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:58.180
 The adhesive 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:01.190
 I think it is better to use 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:04.930
 Because it also doubles as an experiment 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:04.930
 I 'm going with this guy this time 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:10.000
 It is a thing 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:16.730
 6 minutes 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:18.940
 But it's not embed Well this part when using magnets 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:23.320
 Wintering 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:24.610
 The fact that the part where the magnet squeezes must be borrowed 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:30.500
 What 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:32.600
 Well, I wonder if this is a part of this color on that magnet 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:36.349
 Memo will be stuck 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:40.430
 Since it has become a metal 

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:43.240
 I already want to go there with this process 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:49.740
 think 

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:51.540
 It I want to another in the immediately is hey in processing 

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:54.469
 DoO Well 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.469
 Here 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:04:03.600
 It is not this main, but this side is a post that looks into this menu 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:05.270
 In the lateral direction, the magnet is 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.580
 very well 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:09.240
 Lost 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:09.240
 Suck it out 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.480
 Because it is a thing 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:15.480
 This Mantaiko 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:19.820
 Not here 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:21.489
 It is a form that is stretched vertically with the form on this side 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:25.500
 8 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:25.500
 I would like to do business 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:35.920
 8 It 's eva immediately 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:38.220
 It is to embed part of the magnet hole 

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:39.560
 I have avoided it for a while 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:44.129
 Hmm 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:46.699
 It's hard to see, but it's hard to see 

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:46.699
 I hear 

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:55.350
 Same ana 

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:55.350
 8 here that came out or it is embedded the like 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:03.430
 I expect to release the numbers 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:03.430
 It's a little 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:09.330
 I thought that I made a mistake 

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:12.590
 I've failed, so 8 Nico 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:14.150
 Let the magnet go in 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:16.280
 Door Well 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:20.390
 Positive hole drilling 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:22.310
 It is said that the point you took care of 

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:26.249
 That little bit 

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:31.449
 I do not feel like that 12 

00:05:26.249 --> 00:05:35.139
 Was Mashi that evil meter setting of tight 

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:36.830
 It It is using they shine life and improvisation Chikko 

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:38.689
 Japan has been 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:43.119
 Here 

00:05:38.689 --> 00:05:43.119
 I hope to have a magnet 

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:56.169
 Well then it's sudden but pour in the glue 

00:05:48.889 --> 00:05:56.169
 I embedded a magnet and it is just dry now . 

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:03.890
 Will you e yeah 

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:03.890
 This with 

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:09.800
 Color etc 

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:09.800
 Firefighting 

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:13.430
 Oh yeah 

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:17.650
 And the sky 

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:17.650
 It has become around the magnet properly 

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:24.780
 There is no intensity for photographs, etc. This is an orange white smoke 

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:26.470
 Hmm 

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:28.139
 Well this 

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:30.810
 eh 

00:06:28.139 --> 00:06:33.569
 At the time of land 

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:37.660
 Even if it falls on a mark or a tree branch 

00:06:33.569 --> 00:06:40.380
 I think it would be better if you could not get in a little 

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:43.520
 Well in prefer eh door strength 

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:45.990
 If you increase magnet with similar feeling 

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:48.770
 Holding force change kana 

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:53.740
 I think so a little to this 

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:56.669
 I think that I want to try my best people of EttorikuPPari 

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:56.669
 Well then
