00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
that with needlenose pliers so you don't

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.660 
that with needlenose pliers so you don't
blow<00:02:33.810> in<00:02:33.989> the<00:02:34.140> terminals<00:02:34.680> make<00:02:35.310> sure<00:02:35.489> your

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
blow in the terminals make sure your

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:45.759 
blow in the terminals make sure your
wires<00:02:35.849> don't<00:02:36.180> go<00:02:36.299> flying<00:02:36.630> back<00:02:36.900> in<00:02:36.959> that<00:02:37.319> hole

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:45.769 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:48.440 

okay<00:02:46.769> we<00:02:46.920> have<00:02:47.130> our<00:02:47.160> baked<00:02:47.519> element<00:02:48.060> out<00:02:48.180> now

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
okay we have our baked element out now

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.470 
okay we have our baked element out now
now<00:02:48.810> we<00:02:48.870> can<00:02:49.140> test<00:02:49.410> this<00:02:49.819> do<00:02:50.819> this<00:02:51.000> with<00:02:51.180> an<00:02:51.329> ohm

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
now we can test this do this with an ohm

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:56.870 
now we can test this do this with an ohm
meter<00:02:53.569> set<00:02:54.569> it<00:02:54.690> to<00:02:54.780> ohms<00:02:55.700> you're<00:02:56.700> going<00:02:56.819> to

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
meter set it to ohms you're going to

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.120 
meter set it to ohms you're going to
need<00:02:57.000> to<00:02:57.150> refer<00:02:57.480> to<00:02:57.510> a<00:02:58.079> text<00:02:58.650> sheet<00:02:58.829> or<00:02:59.099> a

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
need to refer to a text sheet or a

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.340 
need to refer to a text sheet or a
service<00:03:00.030> manual<00:03:00.269> to<00:03:00.599> find<00:03:00.870> out<00:03:01.019> what<00:03:01.200> that

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
service manual to find out what that

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.590 
service manual to find out what that
reading<00:03:01.769> should<00:03:01.980> be<00:03:02.040> and<00:03:02.850> in<00:03:02.940> this<00:03:03.090> case<00:03:03.359> it's

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
reading should be and in this case it's

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.979 
reading should be and in this case it's
supposed<00:03:03.930> to<00:03:04.019> be<00:03:04.140> around<00:03:04.500> 20<00:03:05.010> ohms<00:03:05.250> and<00:03:05.989> that's

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
supposed to be around 20 ohms and that's

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:16.660 
supposed to be around 20 ohms and that's
generally<00:03:07.530> within<00:03:07.739> ten<00:03:08.280> percent

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:21.340 

okay<00:03:17.390> I<00:03:17.420> have<00:03:17.720> 21<00:03:18.410> ohms<00:03:18.650> exactly<00:03:19.550> here<00:03:20.170> so<00:03:21.170> this

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 
okay I have 21 ohms exactly here so this

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:26.470 
okay I have 21 ohms exactly here so this
element<00:03:21.620> is<00:03:22.069> good<00:03:24.790> okay<00:03:25.790> so<00:03:25.850> now<00:03:26.180> that<00:03:26.209> we<00:03:26.450> know

this back in and we'll see if we got 120

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:48.460 
this back in and we'll see if we got 120
volts<00:04:42.260> here<00:04:46.150> okay<00:04:47.150> we<00:04:47.300> got<00:04:47.450> to<00:04:47.570> plug<00:04:47.810> back<00:04:47.840> in

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:48.470 
volts here okay we got to plug back in

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:49.870 
volts here okay we got to plug back in
now<00:04:48.710> I<00:04:48.740> don't<00:04:48.919> know<00:04:49.070> if<00:04:49.190> you<00:04:49.310> can<00:04:49.460> see<00:04:49.729> the

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:49.880 
now I don't know if you can see the

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.719 
now I don't know if you can see the
multimeter<00:04:50.479> in<00:04:50.690> the<00:04:50.810> video<00:04:51.110> or<00:04:51.380> not<00:04:51.610> but<00:04:52.610> what

00:04:52.719 --> 00:04:52.729 
multimeter in the video or not but what

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:53.680 
multimeter in the video or not but what
I'm<00:04:52.820> going<00:04:52.940> to<00:04:53.000> do<00:04:53.090> is<00:04:53.210> I'm<00:04:53.300> going<00:04:53.330> to<00:04:53.450> turn

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:53.690 
I'm going to do is I'm going to turn

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:56.650 
I'm going to do is I'm going to turn
this<00:04:53.930> knob<00:04:54.260> on<00:04:55.150> and<00:04:56.150> I'm<00:04:56.240> going<00:04:56.360> to<00:04:56.390> check<00:04:56.600> for

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:56.660 
this knob on and I'm going to check for

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:02.320 
this knob on and I'm going to check for
120<00:04:57.560> volts

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:02.330 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:04.760 

and<00:05:03.330> there<00:05:03.570> you<00:05:03.690> can<00:05:03.840> see<00:05:04.080> we<00:05:04.230> have<00:05:04.380> a<00:05:04.410> hundred

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:04.770 
and there you can see we have a hundred

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:10.909 
and there you can see we have a hundred
and<00:05:06.170> twenty<00:05:07.170> volts<00:05:07.200> there<00:05:07.860> dub<00:05:09.530> turn<00:05:10.530> to<00:05:10.889> a

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:10.919 
and twenty volts there dub turn to a

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:17.600 
and twenty volts there dub turn to a
baked<00:05:11.790> setting<00:05:15.950> so<00:05:16.950> now<00:05:17.130> we<00:05:17.190> know<00:05:17.430> we<00:05:17.580> have

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:17.610 
baked setting so now we know we have

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:19.820 
baked setting so now we know we have
power<00:05:17.970> going<00:05:18.150> down<00:05:18.720> to<00:05:19.050> that<00:05:19.230> now<00:05:19.500> if<00:05:19.680> our

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:19.830 
power going down to that now if our

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:21.590 
power going down to that now if our
element<00:05:20.370> wasn't<00:05:20.730> heating<00:05:21.090> up<00:05:21.240> we<00:05:21.419> just

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:21.600 
element wasn't heating up we just

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:24.590 
element wasn't heating up we just
replace<00:05:21.990> the<00:05:22.169> element<00:05:23.120> so<00:05:24.120> we<00:05:24.150> know<00:05:24.450> we<00:05:24.570> have

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:24.600 
replace the element so we know we have

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:26.450 
replace the element so we know we have
no<00:05:24.870> problem<00:05:25.320> with<00:05:25.440> this<00:05:25.590> one<00:05:25.830> here<00:05:26.100> so<00:05:26.280> now
