00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:02.900 
we were about trouble the whole first

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.620 
we were about trouble the whole first
half<00:01:03.170> and<00:01:03.500> so<00:01:04.059> it<00:01:05.059> was<00:01:05.180> just<00:01:05.330> kind<00:01:05.510> of<00:01:05.540> a

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
half and so it was just kind of a

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.370 
half and so it was just kind of a
frustration<00:01:06.050> for<00:01:06.320> the<00:01:06.410> kids<00:01:06.680> I<00:01:06.800> think

broke that pretty easily and so we had

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:01.900 
broke that pretty easily and so we had
to<00:03:00.680> adjust<00:03:00.920> and<00:03:01.160> go<00:03:01.220> to<00:03:01.280> something<00:03:01.580> else<00:03:01.730> and

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
to adjust and go to something else and

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.610

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420

we<00:03:29.879> had<00:03:30.120> to<00:03:30.239> block<00:03:30.420> out<00:03:30.659> we<00:03:30.900> had<00:03:31.019> to<00:03:31.140> get<00:03:31.260> the

00:03:31.339 --> 00:03:31.349 
we had to block out we had to get the

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:32.899 
we had to block out we had to get the
board's<00:03:31.680> and<00:03:31.920> it's<00:03:32.190> the<00:03:32.280> first<00:03:32.489> team<00:03:32.670> I<00:03:32.849> think

00:03:32.899 --> 00:03:32.909
