00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:13.980
 there are video games you have 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.990
 not on the screen until finally 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.760
 you can see these at play and from 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.010
 The quality will be blown away 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.600
 with me with the papers the 2d 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.890
 jump'n'run called this country the 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.570
 puppeteer and comes on the 11th 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.160
 september on blu ray disc in the trade 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.920
 and in the playstation store 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.539
 I personally got in 2012 with that 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.030
 Game was announced by Sony 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.010
 but left me absolutely cold then 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.329
 many other titles wanted to play there 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.100
 no room for a cute one 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.899
 So I did not pay attention to puppet players 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.210
 - new screenshots or trainer 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.610
 until the game was about to release and 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.300
 was special and me one 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.300
 to get a review copy 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.340
 I put the blu ray disc in mine 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.170
 console starts and the game and became 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.600
 not from the magical controls 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.030
 more was released from the play 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.460
 a session of several hours each 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.750
 I made a lot of fun 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.060
 was pulled into a world 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.500
 In the evil moon Beijing the souls 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.960
 innocent kids on the moon 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.520
 enslaved in his castle will be the 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.410
 souls are stuck in dolls' bodies and 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.390
 henceforth I have to go to the dark side 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:17.100
 so does the young choir 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.200
 but it hits the main protagonist 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.090
 much worse than the nasty bear 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.640
 king different day groups head and 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.220
 throws him in the dungeons there he meets 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.869
 to the flying cat june to the im 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.910
 order a supposedly good witch 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.369
 examined the young and him on his 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:34.530
 the upcoming adventure is on the side of the 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.450
 flying companion also explained 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.580
 that the boy has different heads up 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.170
 Everyone can wear his shoulders 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:43.170
 look different and own 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.060
 skills 3 d heads quite well but with 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.369
 wear and change with the press of a button 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.290
 but it takes more for the king now 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.940
 to defeat and the souls of the children too 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.200
 to free 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.580
 as far as the story more I would like 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.229
 This place also does not reveal since the 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:58.610
 action and its implementation to the 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.610
 big strengths of the game heard 

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:09.780
 so you jump and fight in the skin 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.720
 from katar through seven current ones 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.190
 in total there are 21 levels each 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.500
 it impresses with a unique 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.300
 graphic and the fact that the 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.030
 world of the good players around you and 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.410
 you are not around the world that lies 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.390
 because the whole game is like a 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.819
 the play is raised say the 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:29.400
 stage is your game world and each one 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:30.810
 other stage deco her design 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.580
 starts at a section at the 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.230
 usually builds and would have to one 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.660
 portal will get you in one 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.640
 another section teleported such 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.470
 an approach in a job 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.120
 I have not seen the date yet 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.739
 game structure is unused 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.019
 and exudes an individual charm 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:47.700
 who mastered the game of competition 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:49.739
 but it goes further 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.690
 to defend yourself against the enemy 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:52.470
 Put a magical pair of scissors 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.940
 to disposal 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.830
 the weapon carries in a cellar brass 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.620
 and has more features than that 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:01.380
 The monsters are set to become pure 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.090
 it serves as fortbewegungsmittel in the 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:05.160
 your fabric paper or even water up 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.829
 button pressure you can cut 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.120
 to move on the material so climbs 

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:11.130
 in this way, for example, the 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.230
 Legs of an opponent in which you through 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:14.820
 seinfeld cuts or crosses one 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.400
 flow we take here by falling 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:18.959
 leaves see a play element what me 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.579
 tremendously fun and again 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:22.650
 fresh wind in the genre breaks 

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:24.239
 guitars heads also point 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.769
 skills on the currencies you 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:28.049
 access to new items or even 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:30.170
 bonus level if you have a certain time 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:32.640
 the ability is activated by pressing a button 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:34.440
 most you have to level even more times 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.130
 Visiting her heads needs her 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.750
 not led at all 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.640
 At first glance this may be the case 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.170
 Although annoying its guaranteed but at 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.870
 exact consider a replay value 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:44.489
 at the end of an act often have one 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.440
 huge and boston 's brow 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:47.670
 taking a long time for a new skill like that 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.280
 about a protective shield or the ability 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.780
 to be bombed this way 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.799
 I constantly motivated on the ball too 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.799
 stay possible top 

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:07.269
 really good on the multiplayer 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.310
 Aspect in a certain way until you guys 

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:11.200
 the game will be a coop mode 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.090
 player controls take a scooter of 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.319
 Players of those who have and 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:16.359
 Can with the cat various objects 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:18.759
 to examine more closely enemies 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:20.350
 so the heroes are so supportive ones 

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:21.669
 solo on the go you control both 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:23.740
 Characters with the help of the two 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:25.560
 analog sticks at the same time what initially 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:27.729
 requires a certain period of accommodation 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:33.669
 makes the game a corner more 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:35.139
 fun in things presentation needs 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:35.820
 the puppeteer under no circumstances 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:38.349
 hide 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:40.509
 graphic level and character design and 

00:04:38.349 --> 00:04:41.380
 especially the artdesign are about everyone 

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:43.509
 doubtful 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:44.740
 the sections are like that 

00:04:43.509 --> 00:04:46.960
 varied and colorful 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.280
 made it a pleasure for me 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.810
 to give my best 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:51.370
 I really wanted to see what happened 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:53.680
 hiding behind the next teleporter 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:54.400
 as ingenious as the opticians are the 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.960
 characters 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.669
 every figure became imaginative 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:00.070
 worked out and started a great 

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:01.800
 synchronous voice donated so that the 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:04.270
 play because I wake up to life 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:06.370
 Much to contribute to the harmonious 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:08.919
 Humor in the dialogues is often yours 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:10.360
 garnished elicited the smile 

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:12.430
 whole with a great soundtrack of 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:14.440
 no wish leaves owner one 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:16.510
 By the way, 3d tv are happy about one 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:18.039
 successful 3d effect as the figures here 

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:19.889
 and there its two-dimensional plane 

00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:22.300
 leave and literally in front of your eyes 

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:26.220
 intern super cool made easier 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:26.220
 make vikings with you 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:30.520
 So you notice I have almost nothing 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:32.289
 to expose the puppeteer 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:34.630
 The criticism I have is only one 

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:36.099
 dripping on the hot stone so had to 

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:38.139
 At first I'm a bit sluggish 

00:05:36.099 --> 00:05:40.539
 acting jump mechanics win the 

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:42.190
 me at littlebigplanet he also had 

00:05:40.539 --> 00:05:43.990
 the game offers a few 

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:46.659
 Frustration moments associated with 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:48.460
 inaccurately jumping are also the 

00:05:46.659 --> 00:05:51.039
 normal opponents in the levels could 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:52.840
 Variations can be achieved in the exceedingly 

00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:53.289
 positive overall impression changes that 

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:55.419
 Nothing 

00:05:53.289 --> 00:05:57.909
 the puppeteer is for me one of the 

00:05:55.419 --> 00:06:01.060
 many surprises of the year 2013 

00:05:57.909 --> 00:06:02.160
 as a fan of german open source thank you for 

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:04.370
 this masterpiece 

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:04.370
 buy yourself
