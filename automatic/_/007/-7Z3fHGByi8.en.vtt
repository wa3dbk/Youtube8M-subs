the worry here is that the crossing
guards<00:01:45.720> are<00:01:45.840> volunteers<00:01:46.500> all<00:01:46.829> of<00:01:47.040> them<00:01:47.189> which

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
guards are volunteers all of them which

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.219 
guards are volunteers all of them which
means<00:01:47.640> that<00:01:47.759> sometimes<00:01:48.090> this<00:01:48.540> isn't<00:01:48.960> staff

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
means that sometimes this isn't staff

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.109 
means that sometimes this isn't staff
now<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:49.560> big<00:01:49.770> worry<00:01:50.009> is<00:01:50.220> that<00:01:50.520> kids<00:01:50.909> come
