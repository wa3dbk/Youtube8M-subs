chopper mimic I'm just kidding he's

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.840 
chopper mimic I'm just kidding he's
probably<00:00:18.930> he<00:00:19.230> looks<00:00:19.560> like<00:00:19.920> his<00:00:20.130> design<00:00:20.490> if<00:00:20.730> you

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
probably he looks like his design if you

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.269 
probably he looks like his design if you
know<00:00:20.970> Land<00:00:21.180> Before<00:00:21.420> Time<00:00:21.480> so<00:00:22.470> shadow<00:00:22.740> goes<00:00:23.130> to
