00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.100
 From JJ Abrams 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
 The visionary behind Star Wars episode 7 and Felicity, 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
 Sort a reboot, impossible not to like 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.500
 unless you are William Shatner. 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
 The new franchise, which uses gibberish travel time to spoil 50 years of history. 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
 But who cares ? because Star Trek is once again breathtaking. 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.000
 Meet Nero 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
 A Romulan looking for revenge after his planet was destroyed. 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000
 He will give a second chance to save his species when a black hole returns him in time 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000
 but instead of warning the imminent disaster, he will go around in circles for 25 years 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:54.000
 Go! They have no phone in the space? 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:56.500
 But there is a man who can stop that! 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 Captain Pike 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.000
 who is quickly capturing. 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.000
 Leaving another man, 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:03.800
 Commander Spock 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.800
 who gives up after a nervous breakdown 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.800
 "I ... emotionally compromised" 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 Leaving yet another man who can stop that 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.000
 Captain James.T.Kirk 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.000
 a surly drunkard who is accepted into Starfleet 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.800
 without all the paperwork, 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 without background checks 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:21.910
 or medical evaluation. 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.910
 Board and order USS Enterpise 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.910
 the heavily armored Apple Store of the Federation. 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.910
 Full of geniuses 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.490
 who climb the ladder 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.000
 not by their services or abilities 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.000
 but because of things like: 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.000
 Influenza 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 "Where is Lieutenant Mckenna?" 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:40.500
 "He's sick, sir, I'm Hikaru Sulu." 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:41.900
 Death 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.900
 "Dr.Piru was on deck 6. He's dead." 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.500
 "Then you become the chief physician" 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.500
 Incompetence 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.500
 "I do not know if I can differentiate Romulan language from vulcanian" 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.500
 "Uhura, relay the Lieutenant" 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 and an approximately clean shirt of a uniform 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.000
 Discover a movie 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:59.900
 who makes the nerds cry, 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.000
 makes them applaud 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.000
 and who will ... 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.000
 ?! 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.000
 Explore a brand new Star Trek universe 

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:11.500
 that affects all Star Trek aliens you know and love 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.500
 and none of them are shown except: 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:16.500
 Big eyes 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:17.500
 Long face 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:18.500
 "Tic Tac Eyes" 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:19.900
 and Tan Mom 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.000
 Get ready to hallucinate in front of a real Star Wars demo by JJ Abrams. 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.000
 It's a saga, 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.980
 which makes us ask important questions like: 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
 Why does Chris Pine make the same silly grimace every time he punches himself? 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.500
 And ... Oh! Winona Ryder still playing? 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
 Out of a new era of Star Trek movies that really let themselves be watched, 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.900
 a movie with action 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000
 excitation 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.000
 and light effects 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
 and even more effects 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
 Seriously, how can we see in this ship? 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000
 Zapp Brannigan (Futurama) 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.000
 fork-spoon 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.500
 No one's favorites 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.000
 The Willie Gardener (Simpsons) 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
 Dude it was great, in how long the reboot of the new generation? 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.000
 that would be great !
