00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 come seventh part of my barth 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:08.760
 tutorials today in the series, it is for 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:10.469
 advanced hc critical and about that 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.179
 Let's take a look at skill mangling 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.150
 we know seven weapon damage 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.770
 pretty good by now and where we have 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.180
 high weapon damage and me at two 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.520
 That's why we also use handguns 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.020
 grain in most cases and 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.820
 That's why we end up a weapon 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.710
 the fewest possible per 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.359
 Seconds has ever fewer attacks per 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.769
 the second she has the higher the 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.289
 weapon damage is the weapon damage 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:34.350
 that's the value over there and scoring 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.540
 has another per second without text it 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.750
 There are even weapons that attack at 0.9 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.640
 have and therefore an extremely high 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:45.809
 but weapon damage have in most 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:48.510
 in the grain we have races 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:52.170
 Two-handed flasks also be very good 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.539
 can and yes the special is ready 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.250
 then rent the rent again 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.760
 can still crib in addition to the high 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.739
 weapon damage times 700 percent can also 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.710
 still crib and then meant that 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:07.950
 he is again increased by 613 percent 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.630
 and that makes us very tall 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.790
 the match output with mangle and 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.770
 actually only because of this 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.530
 threesome combination of damage 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.090
 700 weapon damage and the high 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.880
 caught two of the water 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.560
 there can be no colors and there is 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.100
 of course, a great tool on the 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.390
 We import our point 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.220
 weapons to up here I have the yes 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.250
 everything already made my beard like me 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.960
 Just got him and then go here 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.329
 down to the ent and here we see 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.250
 total damage or we can 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.750
 also damage finished or dps look at us 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.490
 which does not matter in the end 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.220
 you can see that it is 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:48.000
 divided it in normal and it kritt 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.590
 can you see who can crib and yes 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.689
 the normal damage with me for example 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:55.799
 if I just set a trend 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:58.619
 and the unacknowledged 531,000 is okay 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:00.630
 is quite good but really violent if 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:03.780
 he chains because then he makes 3.8 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.490
 Millions harm you and this value to you 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.979
 We want to optimize this when trashing 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.750
 because the power is the most and 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:13.900
 Swatch and is also the cheapest 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:16.450
 perfect to optimize and on 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:19.510
 to bring some level to the TDP 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:21.790
 To increase it is very very expensive 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.320
 sometime yes and he goes with it 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.790
 a high attack speed and it 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:29.440
 contradicts this trend again 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.780
 the text does not come at all 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.670
 there are not more ticks there are 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.350
 no breakpoint or anything that is burning 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.340
 but above all things is the clip 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:42.250
 damage and thus rest with it 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:45.209
 as often as possible must be refuted 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:47.050
 of course, the chance again 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:48.610
 be optimized and how do we do that 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:49.320
 So best how do we go at 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:52.060
 go 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:55.209
 First, our first goal should be 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.140
 in the fire between two and two and a half 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:59.350
 millions 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:01.750
 For this it has a basic skeletons 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:04.420
 skeletons are our main target in the brand 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.950
 because they happen in large quantities and 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.260
 They give a damn good drop 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:10.390
 chance meaning that you have the best 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:14.440
 the best opponents are around Luke too 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:18.150
 get from you and have skeletons 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:20.820
 usually between 2 to 2 5 million hp 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:23.080
 and we want to do that with a profitable one 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.980
 will swirl and set on fire then 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.330
 they really die 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:29.320
 at least when you have a child 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:31.989
 So we optimize our club 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:34.299
 trend to the effect that he first on 2 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:37.510
 up to 2 5 million bring that to it 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:39.579
 then we have increased the 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:42.070
 kids chance so many opponents 

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:44.470
 really around us these too 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:45.970
 get a yes and if we do that trend 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:50.010
 then we can turn 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:50.010
 to increase the trend 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:56.049
 like me, for example, to 38 million 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:58.450
 At some point optimally you want to 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:59.019
 there are 35 then really 4 millions 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:01.239
 to reach 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:03.370
 otherwise between these two 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:05.739
 million or between two and a half 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:08.799
 million and three and a half million 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:12.100
 There are only a few enemy types we kill 

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:14.620
 which we would then have with a clip trend 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:16.900
 that's why he either two and a half or 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.579
 really three and a half to four million 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:19.989
 because then, for example, there are the first 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:21.580
 opponents which we then were back would 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:23.570
 we can not do that before 

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:25.070
 could have for example the oasis 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:28.190
 I do not know what they are called 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:30.260
 invisible with her late this per 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:32.120
 I do not know the name of 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:34.400
 that's about for example 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:36.170
 four million hp yes and when I go to 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.240
 for once purely vortex and then 

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:40.010
 My club trend then set the die 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:42.710
 but that does not work with two and a half 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:44.210
 million percent that means in the 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:46.700
 end effect i had a bit too 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:49.480
 Watch me drive and then just go 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:51.890
 go through in the levels where you are foreign 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:53.530
 how many hp have my opponents there and 

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:56.510
 which types of opponents have how much hp 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:59.810
 which type of opponent and therefore which 

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:01.370
 killer types I kill with a trend for 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:02.330
 which do I need two for which even 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:04.730
 possibly 3 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:06.710
 which I would advise against that 

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:10.760
 three for one somehow 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:12.440
 trash opponents and you have everything 

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:14.420
 to look at it a little bit 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:16.340
 a lot of grip trend you have that's why it is 

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:18.050
 really important this value of you too 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:20.420
 know and you should stop that too 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:22.520
 then totally fits know because in the 

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:24.140
 Most cases around ten opponents to 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:27.200
 put you around and you the edge 

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:28.940
 power is browser enabled bercy 

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:32.030
 mode activates and beg agent superstructure 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:34.550
 also because of that always nice high weapons 

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:36.740
 only here with the skills and then watch 

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:39.680
 how much is running how much the manager 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:42.830
 that is really important there 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:44.300
 trash colors because in the end yes this 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:46.670
 worth boosting it significantly cheaper 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:48.860
 as in tbps you see for example here 

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:50.650
 I just imported from myself 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:53.750
 he has cost 300 million 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:55.610
 And that makes 28 million kwh trend 

00:05:53.750 --> 00:06:00.290
 Almost a bit much in the 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:06:02.270
 end effect and 1 and only 19 million tdp 

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:05.750
 For example , it almost does only half 

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:10.400
 as much tdp as my beard but he 

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:11.510
 makes millions less strange now 

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:13.700
 you can see that it's really a lot 

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:17.530
 cheaper is this silver in the 

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:19.889
 trash of to optimize 

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:21.599
 Yes and 

00:06:19.889 --> 00:06:24.240
 in the course of this then really synonymous 

00:06:21.599 --> 00:06:26.810
 kids chance because of course here 

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:29.639
 klitschkos is not included in it 

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:32.159
 just says how much of kripo and damage 

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:34.050
 How many are hit 

00:06:32.159 --> 00:06:35.909
 that determines the klitschkos and therefore 

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:37.949
 I always say the first one first 

00:06:35.909 --> 00:06:41.639
 the goal is to optimize the coaches 

00:06:37.949 --> 00:06:43.650
 Bring them to 2 to 2 5 million and 

00:06:41.639 --> 00:06:44.999
 then optimize your coaches and if you are 

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:47.810
 that has done and also a bruise 

00:06:44.999 --> 00:06:50.460
 80 to 85 percent 

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:52.110
 then you can again clip here 

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:55.229
 further optimize the trend 

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:57.360
 but that will be more expensive and is 

00:06:55.229 --> 00:06:59.879
 not so necessary and that's why 

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:02.360
 also the reason why we pope 30 

00:06:59.879 --> 00:07:07.979
 Millions can still build the 

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:10.199
 Make 233 million trends and more than 80% 

00:07:07.979 --> 00:07:14.819
 chances to drive super e10 

00:07:10.199 --> 00:07:16.050
 can so and all I will 

00:07:14.819 --> 00:07:18.589
 again discuss a bit more 

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:20.900
 for an upcoming part eight 

00:07:18.589 --> 00:07:25.409
 because there I will most likely 

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:26.969
 that's right, that's what farming is about 

00:07:25.409 --> 00:07:29.580
 again for advanced what is there 

00:07:26.969 --> 00:07:31.439
 Still for small tricks there and how to 

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:33.900
 can further optimize 

00:07:31.439 --> 00:07:35.550
 especially regarding the clip chance 

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:36.800
 some budget pope already went to the 

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:39.710
 direction that I built 

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:42.089
 that will be the next batch 

00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:43.529
 most likely hope you have 

00:07:42.089 --> 00:07:45.870
 this time again learned what these three 

00:07:43.529 --> 00:07:47.789
 sets that I have spoken that should 

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:49.259
 you understand and if you are the 

00:07:47.789 --> 00:07:52.830
 understood it is my opinion 

00:07:49.259 --> 00:07:54.360
 yes, then you are what they are 

00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:56.879
 information and knowledge about the 

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:59.419
 Balkan gives most people far 

00:07:56.879 --> 00:07:59.419
 ahead
