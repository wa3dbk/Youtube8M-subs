00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:14.139
 certainly one of the TV series the 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.070
 most popular of the moment game of 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:17.250
 thrones just made a new 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:19.750
 the object of a video game adaptation 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.340
 after the strategy game place to the games 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.680
 role always developed by the 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:25.689
 french cyanide studio and who says 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.980
 rpg ten major scenarios of 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:28.599
 developers have made the effort to 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.230
 respect the chronology of the first volume 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:30.820
 of the saga 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:34.150
 even if the story told to us 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.559
 remains totally original for the shot 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:36.850
 new characters have been created 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:39.790
 especially for the occasion 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.839
 Morse westford and ballast star weekend that 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.340
 will guide us through 

00:00:40.839 --> 00:00:44.720
 this new adventure 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.400
 this one is also cut into 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.050
 different chapters that gives us 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.110
 alternately the control of one and then 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:53.150
 on the other a good idea that allows the 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.470
 players to taste the game by episode 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:57.410
 like he could do it with a 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:59.510
 good tv series and even though these 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.710
 characters are taxed it is possible 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:04.070
 customize them from head to toe 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:06.260
 and define their fighting style a 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.979
 obligatory passage for a good rpg that 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.240
 respects himself 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:09.680
 especially as some of our 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.820
 behaviors will affect traits 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:15.050
 heroes in terms of gameplay games of 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.210
 thrones also gives pride of place to the 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:19.160
 variety of actions through spells of 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.229
 magic that allows primer to take the 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:23.090
 control of his dog and thus access 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:26.690
 inaccessible places or even 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:28.040
 spy on conversations while talking 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.420
 of the dialogue system know that he 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.479
 allows you to choose your answers and 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:34.220
 to assume the consequences that go with 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:35.630
 a choice that we greatly appreciate and 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.789
 which makes it possible to overcome the shortcomings 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.070
 many of the game it's a disaster 

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:41.300
 the people is at pau graphically everything 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.940
 first the game does not break three legs 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:47.030
 to a duck and on pc we saw much more 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:48.950
 convincing the art direction is 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.300
 also quite rustic and the number 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.560
 Clown quite high in the villages 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.229
 tarnish the immersion 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.780
 she could not slow down the inevitable 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:58.340
 decay of a fief without lord side 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.170
 staging is also quite flat 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.720
 and this proves that the budget allocated to 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:05.150
 title was not stupendous 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.530
 to that you can add some bugs to 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.600
 which may creak 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.890
 teeth 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.630
 we would also have liked a management of 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.100
 the interface clearer but the game having 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.750
 been developed also on consoles 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.090
 the developers certainly had to 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.680
 make some concessions brief the game 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.150
 clearly lacks finishing but 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.530
 luckily games of thrones convinces 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.530
 in the background more than in form 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.600
