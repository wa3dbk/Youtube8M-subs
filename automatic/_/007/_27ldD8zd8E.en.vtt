taken those concepts and modified it

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:34.110 
taken those concepts and modified it
into<00:00:31.150> you<00:00:31.630> know<00:00:31.660> what<00:00:32.470> I'm<00:00:32.789> hoping<00:00:33.789> will<00:00:34.090> be

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:34.120

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
performance surfboard that can be

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.569 
performance surfboard that can be
regarded<00:00:40.059> as<00:00:40.420> it<00:00:40.629> is<00:00:41.110> competitive<00:00:41.590> thrusters

00:00:42.569 --> 00:00:42.579 
regarded as it is competitive thrusters

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:45.510 
regarded as it is competitive thrusters
or<00:00:42.760> even<00:00:43.270> or<00:00:43.510> even<00:00:43.930> more<00:00:44.079> so<00:00:44.289> high<00:00:44.949> performance

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:45.520 
or even or even more so high performance

or even or even more so high performance
in<00:00:45.789> the<00:00:45.910> future<00:00:46.270> so<00:00:46.559> basically<00:00:47.559> I'm<00:00:48.129> working

00:00:48.599 --> 00:00:48.609 
in the future so basically I'm working

00:00:48.609 --> 00:00:51.590 
in the future so basically I'm working
with<00:00:48.760> super<00:00:49.570> fast<00:00:49.780> outlines<00:00:50.289> real<00:00:50.590> straight

tails<00:00:54.760> and<00:00:56.190> parallel<00:00:57.190> set<00:00:57.760> dual<00:00:58.149> fins<00:00:58.420> which

00:00:59.310 --> 00:00:59.320 
tails and parallel set dual fins which

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.580 
tails and parallel set dual fins which
basically<00:00:59.710> allows<00:01:00.100> the<00:01:01.030> minimum<00:01:01.899> drag<00:01:02.170> and

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:02.590 
basically allows the minimum drag and

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:06.899 
basically allows the minimum drag and
and<00:01:03.280> the<00:01:03.969> fins<00:01:04.210> are<00:01:04.449> designed<00:01:05.410> with<00:01:05.590> a<00:01:05.850> kind<00:01:06.850> of

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:06.909 
and the fins are designed with a kind of

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:09.929 
and the fins are designed with a kind of
a<00:01:06.970> hatchet<00:01:07.299> style<00:01:07.540> shape<00:01:07.979> to<00:01:08.979> produce<00:01:09.700> as<00:01:09.820> much

00:01:09.929 --> 00:01:09.939 
a hatchet style shape to produce as much

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:12.780 
a hatchet style shape to produce as much
thrust<00:01:10.390> and<00:01:10.689> power<00:01:11.409> through<00:01:11.710> the<00:01:11.799> turn<00:01:12.009> as

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:12.790 
thrust and power through the turn as

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:15.359 
thrust and power through the turn as
possible<00:01:13.420> so<00:01:13.689> the<00:01:14.380> idea<00:01:14.710> is<00:01:14.860> to<00:01:14.890> achieve

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:15.369 
possible so the idea is to achieve

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:17.910 
possible so the idea is to achieve
maximum<00:01:15.700> thrust<00:01:16.210> with<00:01:16.420> minimum<00:01:16.750> drag<00:01:17.079> you

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:17.920 
maximum thrust with minimum drag you

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.350 
maximum thrust with minimum drag you
know<00:01:18.040> which<00:01:18.189> is<00:01:18.340> true<00:01:18.579> -<00:01:18.759> like<00:01:18.939> a<00:01:18.970> lot<00:01:19.180> of<00:01:19.240> the

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:19.360 
know which is true - like a lot of the

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.210 
know which is true - like a lot of the
theories<00:01:19.720> of<00:01:19.840> like<00:01:19.990> guys<00:01:20.200> agree<00:01:20.619> no<00:01:20.799> and

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:21.220 
theories of like guys agree no and

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.719 
theories of like guys agree no and
Simmons<00:01:21.909> and<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.920> boards<00:01:24.220> are<00:01:24.280> really<00:01:24.520> based

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:24.729 
Simmons and the boards are really based

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:27.420 
Simmons and the boards are really based
on<00:01:24.909> a<00:01:25.540> lot<00:01:26.140> of<00:01:26.170> theory<00:01:26.710> you<00:01:27.009> know<00:01:27.130> a<00:01:27.159> lot<00:01:27.340> of

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:27.430 
on a lot of theory you know a lot of

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.539 
on a lot of theory you know a lot of
science<00:01:27.909> I'm<00:01:29.100> applying<00:01:30.100> Bernoulli's

principle<00:01:30.960> to<00:01:31.960> my<00:01:32.079> work<00:01:32.320> which<00:01:32.649> is<00:01:32.829> which<00:01:33.420> you

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:34.420 
principle to my work which is which you

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.440 
principle to my work which is which you
know<00:01:34.540> explains<00:01:35.340> laminar<00:01:36.340> flow<00:01:36.579> and<00:01:36.610> how

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 
know explains laminar flow and how

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.639 
know explains laminar flow and how
objects<00:01:38.380> relate<00:01:39.070> to<00:01:39.990> flow<00:01:40.990> fluid<00:01:41.350> and

00:01:41.639 --> 00:01:41.649

know when area of an object is

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.880 
know when area of an object is
decreasing<00:01:54.399> for<00:01:54.700> example<00:01:55.180> with<00:01:56.170> my<00:01:56.350> board<00:01:56.619> I

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 
decreasing for example with my board I

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.029 
decreasing for example with my board I
have<00:01:57.579> a<00:01:57.610> decreasing<00:01:58.409> area<00:01:59.409> a<00:01:59.590> gradual

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
decrease not a not a rapid decrease like

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.139 
decrease not a not a rapid decrease like
you<00:02:02.140> might<00:02:02.320> find<00:02:02.469> in<00:02:02.680> the<00:02:02.740> thruster<00:02:03.219> which

00:02:04.139 --> 00:02:04.149 
you might find in the thruster which

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:06.569 
you might find in the thruster which
when<00:02:05.079> it<00:02:05.200> went<00:02:05.409> up<00:02:05.469> when<00:02:05.740> the<00:02:05.829> flow<00:02:06.070> around

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:06.579 
when it went up when the flow around

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:10.260 
when it went up when the flow around
that<00:02:07.350> gradual<00:02:08.350> decrease<00:02:08.700> the<00:02:09.700> speed<00:02:09.940> will

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
that gradual decrease the speed will

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:11.470 
that gradual decrease the speed will
increase<00:02:10.300> and

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
increase and

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.770 
increase and
and<00:02:11.920> the<00:02:12.920> flow<00:02:13.250> of<00:02:13.280> pressure<00:02:14.000> will<00:02:14.269> decrease

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
and the flow of pressure will decrease

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.410 
and the flow of pressure will decrease
with<00:02:14.930> with<00:02:15.440> a<00:02:15.470> velocity<00:02:15.950> increase<00:02:16.400> so<00:02:17.090> stated

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
with with a velocity increase so stated

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.050 
with with a velocity increase so stated
by<00:02:17.599> Bernoulli<00:02:18.110> so<00:02:18.349> using<00:02:19.129> these<00:02:19.220> theories<00:02:19.819> to

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
by Bernoulli so using these theories to

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.690 
by Bernoulli so using these theories to
get<00:02:20.480> a<00:02:20.750> grounding<00:02:21.349> for<00:02:22.190> what<00:02:22.400> I<00:02:22.430> want<00:02:22.640> to

get a grounding for what I want to

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.020 
get a grounding for what I want to
achieve<00:02:22.819> and<00:02:23.530> you<00:02:24.530> know<00:02:24.650> the<00:02:24.890> end<00:02:25.040> result<00:02:25.400> is<00:02:25.700> a

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
achieve and you know the end result is a

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.080 
achieve and you know the end result is a
broad<00:02:26.720> that<00:02:26.900> deforms<00:02:27.379> radically<00:02:28.370> a<00:02:28.670> high

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
broad that deforms radically a high

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.350 
broad that deforms radically a high
speed<00:02:29.480> and<00:02:29.720> it<00:02:29.840> planes<00:02:30.879> really<00:02:31.879> well<00:02:32.000> gets<00:02:32.239> up

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
speed and it planes really well gets up

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:33.460 
speed and it planes really well gets up
on<00:02:32.390> top<00:02:32.599> of<00:02:32.690> the<00:02:32.750> water<00:02:32.930> and<00:02:33.110> has<00:02:33.230> like<00:02:33.379> a

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
on top of the water and has like a

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.009 
on top of the water and has like a
skimming<00:02:34.160> across<00:02:34.400> the<00:02:34.610> water<00:02:34.849> feel<00:02:35.150> but<00:02:35.900> at

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:36.019 
skimming across the water feel but at

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:37.900 
skimming across the water feel but at
the<00:02:36.080> same<00:02:36.260> time<00:02:36.530> with<00:02:36.860> a<00:02:36.890> great<00:02:37.160> level<00:02:37.340> control

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
the same time with a great level control

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.500 
the same time with a great level control
and<00:02:38.799> obviously<00:02:39.799> an<00:02:40.370> all-around<00:02:40.730> real<00:02:41.150> high

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
and obviously an all-around real high

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.770 
and obviously an all-around real high
performance<00:02:42.079> board<00:02:42.400> so<00:02:43.400> it's<00:02:44.299> a<00:02:44.360> really<00:02:44.599> cool

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
performance board so it's a really cool

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.440 
performance board so it's a really cool
arm<00:02:45.489> direction<00:02:46.489> I'm<00:02:46.610> part<00:02:46.819> of<00:02:46.849> moving<00:02:47.030> in<00:02:47.269> and

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
arm direction I'm part of moving in and

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.589 
arm direction I'm part of moving in and
I'm<00:02:47.510> hoping<00:02:47.810> and<00:02:48.760> it<00:02:49.760> takes<00:02:49.970> off<00:02:50.150> here<00:02:50.510> in

00:02:50.589 --> 00:02:50.599 
I'm hoping and it takes off here in

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:53.140 
I'm hoping and it takes off here in
America<00:02:50.989> because<00:02:51.769> you<00:02:52.310> know<00:02:52.430> the<00:02:52.579> American

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
America because you know the American

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.690 
America because you know the American
market<00:02:53.450> obviously<00:02:53.780> really<00:02:54.079> open<00:02:54.410> to<00:02:54.700> this

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
market obviously really open to this

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.199 
market obviously really open to this

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
kind of boards and I'm amped and I hope

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:00.819
