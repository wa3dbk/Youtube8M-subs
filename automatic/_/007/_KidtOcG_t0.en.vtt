aluminum radiator it's made by doing
manufacturing<00:00:52.469> and<00:00:53.129> also<00:00:53.460> these<00:00:53.640> if<00:00:53.820> you<00:00:53.879> look

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
manufacturing and also these if you look

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.819 
manufacturing and also these if you look
really<00:00:54.690> close<00:00:55.050> you<00:00:55.170> might<00:00:55.289> be<00:00:55.440> able<00:00:55.559> to<00:00:55.649> see

Bissell<00:05:04.830> from<00:05:05.220> the<00:05:05.340> registry<00:05:06.590> so<00:05:07.590> I<00:05:07.620> think

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:07.890 
Bissell from the registry so I think

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:10.940 
Bissell from the registry so I think
that's<00:05:08.040> about<00:05:08.190> it<00:05:08.340> we<00:05:08.820> got<00:05:09.000> the<00:05:09.440> new<00:05:10.440> tires<00:05:10.710> in

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:16.490 
the back there to 2570 15s
there<00:05:14.700> are<00:05:14.760> a<00:05:14.790> nice<00:05:14.940> wide<00:05:15.270> tire<00:05:15.570> but<00:05:15.870> the<00:05:16.020> tread

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:16.500 
there are a nice wide tire but the tread

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:19.640 
there are a nice wide tire but the tread
isn't<00:05:17.490> as<00:05:17.610> wide<00:05:17.790> as<00:05:17.970> a<00:05:18.000> sidewall<00:05:18.540> so<00:05:19.350> it's<00:05:19.500> kind

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:19.650 
isn't as wide as a sidewall so it's kind

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:21.260 
isn't as wide as a sidewall so it's kind

lighting<00:05:21.570> them<00:05:21.660> up<00:05:21.780> yet<00:05:21.990> but<00:05:22.830> I<00:05:23.190> imagine

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:23.460 
lighting them up yet but I imagine

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:24.920 
lighting them up yet but I imagine
they're<00:05:23.790> not<00:05:23.910> going<00:05:24.060> to<00:05:24.090> have<00:05:24.240> much<00:05:24.660> traction

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:24.930 
they're not going to have much traction

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:27.200
