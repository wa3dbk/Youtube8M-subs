 almost 1300 ps goosebumps sound and the 

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:19.750
 ask who has earned him the title of 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:23.170
 They are the only true stars together 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:24.580
 over 220.000 euro worth we let the 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:25.600
 best of your class against each other 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:31.720

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:37.739

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:55.160
 Euro 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.600
 the youngest in the field of new boxster 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.309
 porsche you remember his 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.760
 virtues and has the Zuffenhausen 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:03.699
 roadster accordingly revised 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.089
 weight reduced power increased 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:06.800
 315 ps 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:09.470
 Nevertheless, it is more economical than its 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.330
 predecessor the hood is a bit shorter 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.910
 the rear one idea longer the wheelbase 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.790
 grown by 6 centimeters that provides for 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:18.979
 more space and comfort 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:21.110
 a snappy 306 hp 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:23.960
 six-cylinder mercedes tried with the 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.910
 current slk to become sportier with 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.100
 soft automatic and well sprung 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:29.530
 but he is still the chassis 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:33.110
 Comfort 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:36.619
 in contrast to audi tt rs 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.160
 only the power package with 340 ps of 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:39.229
 strongest 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.780
 the power from his 15 he gives on 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:44.190
 most direct on his driver keep it up 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.990
 must be a rockstar lead 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:50.710
 just like the second bayer in comparison 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:53.080
 he has the bmw z4 charged 306 ps 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.970
 extremely under the mighty long hood 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.190
 deep this position before the short 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:00.040
 powerful rear classic can 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:01.480
 roadster barely his brother we have 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.260
 Murat Günak for his assessment 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:04.300
 asked 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:06.610
 The designer has the automotive world with him 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:09.460
 the first mercedes c-class the slk 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:12.160
 or the golf 5 shaped the way you like it 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:13.450
 Girlfriends are really after from here 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.090
 the different concepts of 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.520
 porsche is basically one 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:21.460
 wonderful sculpture of pure culture 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:23.890
 There are no sickening no edges like that 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:26.200
 everything from the full model yes with it 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:29.890
 in the net is very many lines in it car 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:32.860
 is very much designed so beading and 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:37.360
 edges cover a little bit cluttered 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:38.680
 a little cluttered formally shows stop 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.720
 a lot of these are you too 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.240
 big air intakes want impotence 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.970
 show and force a bit clichéd 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:47.770
 but perhaps the whole is of 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.650
 that's why the typical audi wants it 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:51.160
 dominates the bmw that the james bond in 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.890
 Berlin 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:56.569
 that's expression of sex appeal anyway 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:59.659
 a gentleman does that 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:01.609
 friendly short form every beat 

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:04.239
 car has its character and i believe 

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:07.459
 that says the great thing about every car 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:09.560
 look and drive the way, too 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:11.030
 how different they actually are 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.930
 we want to go on the handling course 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.379
 test 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:18.859
 The SLK comes with 35 liter V6 intake engine 

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:20.420
 and 370 newton meters almost to the sport 

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:22.579
 seven-speed automatic switches though 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.989
 comfortable but you use the 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:26.269
 then the rocker switches also fit the 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:30.130
 Speed combined with sports suspension 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:32.890
 made slk really fun then 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:34.660
 Audis RS , on the other hand, is a rocket 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.310
 formally over the course thanks quattro 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:37.960
 he almost clings to the curves 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:39.660
 can also be used in aggressive maneuvers 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:42.040
 do not disturb 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:44.260
 450 newton meters press the driver 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:47.400
 every gear change in the seat always 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:50.380
 accompanied by the brutal sound until 15 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:52.960
 as bmw is the z4 to sportiness 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:54.580
 committed 400 newton meters will be up 

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:57.520
 5000 revolutions on the rear axle 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:59.440
 Fired in sports mode , it's taut 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:01.360
 dynamic and loud about the course 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.340
 Walkman the Munich man casually gone 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:06.640
 exactly as you would expect from a bmw 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:08.410
 the five ps more awaits the new one 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:10.240
 Boxster now does not just find 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:13.180
 the paper instead of in the 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:15.460
 stomach pit of 34 6 cylinders strikes 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:17.920
 to celebrate without interruption 

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:20.170
 the porsche tours to over 7000 

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:23.260
 double clutch changes lightning fast and 

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:25.270
 jerk-free the boxster is spontaneously crisp 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:28.630
 that's exactly how I have to be a porsche 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:30.550
 but who feels the fastest 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:33.940
 the nominal highest value belongs to the 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:37.620
 Boxster s 277 km / h top for everyone 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.620
 other ends the propulsion at 250 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:43.170
 and who has the nose in the sprint front 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:49.550
 the tt rs is the other thanks to allrad 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:53.570
 and the best traction considered by 0 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:05:00.340
 on 100 in 4 4 seconds boxster s in 51 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:05:00.340
 bmw z4 52 and slk in 5 6 seconds 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:05.490
 But that is a comparison of power 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.010
 really fun 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:08.910
 Catch emotional cars with a lot of power 

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:10.500
 we at the porsche 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:11.880
 what do you think of that's right 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:13.410
 well done he has his image as 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.640
 housewives porsche meanwhile completely 

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:16.740
 This is a correct assumption 

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:18.450
 that sports car is easier than 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:19.800
 his predecessor it still stronger 

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:22.140
 consumes less and makes on the 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:24.420
 highway right gaudi the bmw for 

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:27.480
 me the real red ware 

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:29.460
 This is certainly the engine 

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:31.530
 front drive rear long hood 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:33.330
 one sits very deeply has a whole 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:34.950
 Great great straight-six engine 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:37.320
 That's a really classic roadster 

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:39.030
 and the audi the semi- strong of the taxiways 

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:40.290
 yes that is indeed with the 

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:42.300
 Five-cylinder engine has the opposite 

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:44.280
 the others do not have a six-cylinder for it 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:45.540
 but a turbocharger brings that over 

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:47.010
 the four-wheel drive also good on the 

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:48.960
 However, he is really one street 

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:50.670
 Not half-strong in the sprint for it 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:52.590
 so strong and the elder statesman of the slk 

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:53.790
 from mercedes what he always has 

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:55.230
 wanted to show that is a bit 

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:56.790
 what for the gentleman at least 

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:59.280
 in comparison, a bit softer 

00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:01.470
 The engine is sprung a bit 

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:03.720
 silky is full of non-force unfolding 

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:05.430
 quite so great but ultimately one too 

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:06.870
 well made roadster your favorite 

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:08.540
 which one will increase I would him 

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:11.400
 make 

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:13.800
 car image editor stefan voswinkel has 

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:15.750
 his favorites found a unique 

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:17.550
 true a west we can or 

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:19.920
 we do not want to end up anymore 

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:22.500
 determine athletic or comfortable 

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:24.810
 cultivated or wild all are they good 

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:26.820
 real roadsters stand for a class 

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:30.800
 and ultimately with their own 

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:30.800
 Character for different values
