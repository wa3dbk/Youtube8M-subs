 this intervention and our idea with this 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.809
 project is really from time to time 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.579

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.440
 Curatorship of the time, people understand that

 in our mission today is to democratize 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.879

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:16.860
 signed from Rodolfo the wall here too 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:18.600

 business with some dub 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.930
 beneficent even the conversations arose 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.420
 with luciano huck he founded the study 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.950
 created beauty for me it would create 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.780
 because he has a lot of history 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.670
 encouraging new talents is something that 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.759
 I think she believes me the best. 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:41.009
 of this project is ten people 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.049
 totally unlikely to be together 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.630
 Do not you have a lot of strikes? 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:48.299
 bertolino rock and stylist leaving 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:51.570
 very talented very very important 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.950
 in the market with the camila rate that I think 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.720
 who today are the most 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.090
 important they have a very large weight 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.219
 win claudia leitte has raphael falci 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.530
 who made a wonderful collection 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:04.380
 robert ford is an international consultant 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.329
 mateus who is a great person then every 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.429
 one had a story to tell 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:12.379
 they counted through five pieces and 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.379
 future under the study umbrella 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.560
 this shop oscar freire de campo 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.090
 great landmark in the history of the island has arrived 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.760
 because we live a very good moment 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.860
 we made a very 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.780
 great to rejuvenate the brand in 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.660
 last ten years and I think this store 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.310
 crowns this moment very much because first 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.470
 so I think that this emblematic point 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.270
 people had a great desire for 21 points 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.800
 a little more central than sao paulo 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.930
 but we got that point came in the 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.459
 right time because that's how we are a month 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.840
 ago was elected the most fashionable 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:44.640
 valuable from Brazil 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.800
 They have taken their collections 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.080
 stylists some time and they give a lot 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.670
 and I think it's opened a lot 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.830
 but we are in a moment where 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:55.470
 there was very large product investment 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:57.630
 in the valley of the same fashion age and I think the 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.110
 people arrive today in oscar freire can 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.110
 be here 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.570
 the only product that has been developed 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.370
 especially to the postmen and was 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:09.420
 a faster collection that is a super 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.980
 novelty 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.360
 I very much believe that the Navy that 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.459
 people are going to start our store going 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.930
 expand to the other but she confesses 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:18.380
 I hope everyone comes. 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.380
 to know
