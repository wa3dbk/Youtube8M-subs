I'm going to make a box it's two and a
half<00:00:02.790> inches<00:00:03.000> the<00:00:03.799> teacup<00:00:04.799> itself<00:00:05.220> I<00:00:05.430> know<00:00:05.910> a

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:06.740 
half inches the teacup itself I know a

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:10.339 
half inches the teacup itself I know a
quarter<00:00:07.740> of<00:00:07.770> an<00:00:07.980> inch<00:00:08.130> sits<00:00:08.820> into<00:00:09.120> that<00:00:09.570> so<00:00:10.139> I'm

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
quarter of an inch sits into that so I'm

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:19.550 
quarter of an inch sits into that so I'm
going<00:00:10.679> to<00:00:10.740> build<00:00:11.160> a<00:00:15.410> box<00:00:16.410> that<00:00:16.800> is<00:00:18.320> two<00:00:19.320> and<00:00:19.470> a

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.040 
half minus a quarter sitting down in so
once<00:00:23.340> again<00:00:23.519> I<00:00:23.910> measure<00:00:25.550> at<00:00:26.550> my<00:00:26.849> baseline<00:00:27.420> two

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
once again I measure at my baseline two

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:36.410 
once again I measure at my baseline two
and<00:00:28.199> a<00:00:28.260> half<00:00:28.439> inches<00:00:28.650> over<00:00:29.460> I<00:00:35.239> bring<00:00:36.239> that

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
and a half inches over I bring that

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:45.080 
and a half inches over I bring that
information<00:00:36.630> back<00:00:37.879> to<00:00:42.890> the<00:00:43.890> front<00:00:44.370> of<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.610> box

the<00:01:41.610> top<00:01:41.850> of<00:01:42.060> my<00:01:42.210> box<00:01:42.540> now<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.380> now<00:01:44.420> I'll

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
the top of my box now and now I'll

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.630 
the top of my box now and now I'll
construct

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:02:01.830 

a<00:01:50.610> box<00:01:57.690> that's<00:01:58.690> a<00:01:58.810> little<00:01:59.940> higher<00:02:00.940> that<00:02:01.690> will

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
a box that's a little higher that will

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.780 
a box that's a little higher that will
incorporate<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:03.250> teacups<00:02:05.490> but<00:02:06.490> we're<00:02:06.640> going

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:06.790 
incorporate the teacups but we're going

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:11.430 
incorporate the teacups but we're going
to<00:02:06.850> make<00:02:07.060> some<00:02:08.580> interesting<00:02:10.020> notes<00:02:11.020> about

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
to make some interesting notes about

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:27.660 
to make some interesting notes about
this<00:02:11.770> box<00:02:24.959> the<00:02:25.959> first<00:02:26.230> thing<00:02:26.470> we<00:02:26.590> note<00:02:26.830> is<00:02:27.010> at

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
this box the first thing we note is at

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.040 
this box the first thing we note is at
the<00:02:27.880> box<00:02:29.340> that<00:02:30.340> we've<00:02:30.580> constructed<00:02:31.000> is<00:02:31.510> much

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
the box that we've constructed is much

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:34.710 
the box that we've constructed is much
too<00:02:32.320> big<00:02:32.560> for<00:02:33.519> the<00:02:33.640> tea<00:02:33.850> cup<00:02:34.090> itself<00:02:34.480> the

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
too big for the tea cup itself the

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.500 
too big for the tea cup itself the
teacup<00:02:35.110> is<00:02:35.290> much<00:02:35.920> smaller<00:02:36.310> the<00:02:37.030> teacup

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
teacup is much smaller the teacup

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:45.740 
teacup is much smaller the teacup
actually<00:02:38.110> at<00:02:38.519> the<00:02:39.519> top<00:02:40.269> point<00:02:41.100> occupies<00:02:42.100> only

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.170 

three<00:02:46.750> inches<00:02:47.370> so<00:02:48.370> what<00:02:48.550> we're<00:02:48.700> going<00:02:48.850> to<00:02:49.000> do

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
three inches so what we're going to do

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:55.050 
three inches so what we're going to do
is<00:02:49.360> this<00:02:51.360> we're<00:02:52.360> going<00:02:52.480> to<00:02:52.540> make<00:02:52.750> our<00:02:53.820> box<00:02:54.820> a

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
is this we're going to make our box a

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:56.580 
is this we're going to make our box a
little<00:02:55.090> smaller<00:02:55.660> and<00:02:55.930> we're<00:02:56.170> going<00:02:56.290> to<00:02:56.350> try

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
little smaller and we're going to try

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.100 
little smaller and we're going to try
some<00:02:56.920> using<00:02:57.790> some<00:02:57.940> diagonals<00:02:58.540> I<00:02:58.690> want<00:02:58.870> to<00:02:58.930> try

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
some using some diagonals I want to try

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.590 
some using some diagonals I want to try
different<00:02:59.170> ways<00:02:59.709> to<00:02:59.950> do<00:03:00.160> things<00:03:00.430> this<00:03:01.239> isn't

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600 
different ways to do things this isn't

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.699 
different ways to do things this isn't
the<00:03:01.690> only<00:03:01.720> way<00:03:02.790> I'm<00:03:03.790> placing<00:03:04.750> a<00:03:05.019> diagonal<00:03:05.560> from

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
the only way I'm placing a diagonal from

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:08.370 
the only way I'm placing a diagonal from
here<00:03:06.010> to<00:03:06.100> here<00:03:06.400> so<00:03:06.670> I<00:03:06.700> get<00:03:06.970> the<00:03:07.150> top<00:03:07.420> what<00:03:08.260> I'm

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
here to here so I get the top what I'm

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:13.650 
here to here so I get the top what I'm
going<00:03:08.650> to<00:03:08.709> do<00:03:10.440> I've<00:03:11.440> just<00:03:11.640> placed<00:03:12.640> a<00:03:12.820> line<00:03:13.060> here

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
going to do I've just placed a line here

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.729 
going to do I've just placed a line here
I'm<00:03:13.810> going<00:03:14.650> to<00:03:14.739> find<00:03:15.070> out<00:03:15.280> the<00:03:15.549> width<00:03:15.850> of<00:03:16.739> the

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739 
I'm going to find out the width of the

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:19.890 
I'm going to find out the width of the
cup<00:03:17.980> and<00:03:18.160> then<00:03:18.340> draw<00:03:18.640> two<00:03:18.880> perpendicular<00:03:19.239> up

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
cup and then draw two perpendicular up

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.470 
cup and then draw two perpendicular up
when<00:03:20.560> they<00:03:20.709> touch<00:03:20.980> this<00:03:21.430> that<00:03:22.030> will<00:03:22.209> be<00:03:22.329> the

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
when they touch this that will be the

top of it teacup so I know my two
perpendicular<00:03:27.070> zai<00:03:27.640> are<00:03:27.880> what<00:03:28.780> they're<00:03:29.320> about

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
perpendicular zai are what they're about

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:34.770 
perpendicular zai are what they're about
an<00:03:29.829> inch<00:03:30.010> and<00:03:30.190> a<00:03:30.310> half<00:03:32.549> from<00:03:33.549> Center<00:03:33.970> I<00:03:34.150> marked

back<00:03:49.320> my<00:03:50.320> point<00:03:51.070> of<00:03:51.220> sight<00:03:51.430> that's<00:03:52.120> because

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
back my point of sight that's because

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.830 
back my point of sight that's because
these<00:03:52.660> are<00:03:52.840> grid<00:03:53.609> indications<00:03:54.609> and<00:03:54.790> then<00:03:55.690> I'm

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 
these are grid indications and then I'm

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.210 
these are grid indications and then I'm
going<00:03:56.079> to<00:03:56.170> note<00:03:57.180> where<00:03:58.180> is<00:03:58.360> that<00:03:58.390> Center<00:03:59.220> well

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220 
going to note where is that Center well

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:02.250 
going to note where is that Center well
it's<00:04:00.459> between<00:04:00.879> the<00:04:01.120> five<00:04:01.330> and<00:04:01.360> six

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.260 
it's between the five and six

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.130 
it's between the five and six
I<00:04:02.290> have<00:04:02.590> that<00:04:02.799> mark<00:04:03.549> can<00:04:03.790> you<00:04:03.819> see<00:04:04.150> that<00:04:04.330> let<00:04:05.019> me

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:05.140 
I have that mark can you see that let me

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.100 
I have that mark can you see that let me
just<00:04:05.379> draw<00:04:06.340> it<00:04:06.370> again<00:04:06.610> so<00:04:06.939> you<00:04:07.030> can<00:04:07.090> see<00:04:07.450> the

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:08.110 
just draw it again so you can see the

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:13.970 
just draw it again so you can see the
center<00:04:08.560> of<00:04:08.709> the<00:04:10.860> saucer<00:04:11.860> and<00:04:12.069> teacup<00:04:12.549> box<00:04:12.849> here

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 
center of the saucer and teacup box here

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:19.289 
center of the saucer and teacup box here
there<00:04:14.980> we<00:04:15.099> go<00:04:15.310> look<00:04:15.730> at<00:04:15.849> that<00:04:17.549> so<00:04:18.549> where<00:04:18.789> these

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:19.299 
there we go look at that so where these

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:25.790 
there we go look at that so where these
two<00:04:19.780> new<00:04:19.989> vanishing<00:04:20.530> lines<00:04:20.739> intersect<00:04:24.780> are

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
two new vanishing lines intersect are

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:31.350 
two new vanishing lines intersect are
these<00:04:26.800> two<00:04:27.070> points<00:04:28.289> if<00:04:29.400> i<00:04:30.400> draw<00:04:30.699> the<00:04:30.729> line<00:04:31.060> up

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 
these two points if i draw the line up

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:39.090 
these two points if i draw the line up
from<00:04:31.660> there<00:04:32.760> two<00:04:33.760> perpendicular<00:04:34.180> lines<00:04:38.100> they

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:39.100 
from there two perpendicular lines they

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:47.930 
from there two perpendicular lines they
will<00:04:39.880> intersect<00:04:40.860> top<00:04:41.860> of<00:04:42.039> the<00:04:42.100> box<00:04:42.310> here<00:04:45.870> and

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
will intersect top of the box here and

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:54.380 
will intersect top of the box here and
here<00:04:48.940> you<00:04:49.680> will<00:04:50.680> now<00:04:50.919> have

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:54.390 

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:57.410 

the<00:04:54.960> circumference<00:04:55.560> of<00:04:55.590> the<00:04:55.980> circle<00:04:56.330> can<00:04:57.330> you

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:57.420 
the circumference of the circle can you

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:00.290 
the circumference of the circle can you
draw<00:04:57.630> that<00:04:57.660> freehand<00:04:58.080> sure<00:04:58.920> you<00:04:59.100> can<00:04:59.340> let's<00:05:00.060> do

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:00.300 
draw that freehand sure you can let's do

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:06.310 
draw that freehand sure you can let's do
it

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:06.320
