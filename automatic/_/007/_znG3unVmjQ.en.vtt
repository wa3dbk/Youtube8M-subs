00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
when I think the differences are and

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.470 
when I think the differences are and
kind<00:00:51.780> of<00:00:51.899> contrasting<00:00:52.559> them<00:00:52.739> and<00:00:52.920> uh<00:00:53.390> and<00:00:54.390> I

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:20.729 
stay in the same area and continue doing

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:23.150 
stay in the same area and continue doing
well<00:04:20.910> I<00:04:21.150> don't<00:04:21.989> see<00:04:22.350> the<00:04:22.440> point<00:04:22.620> of<00:04:22.740> that<00:04:22.800> I

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
well I don't see the point of that I

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.010 
well I don't see the point of that I
did<00:04:23.430> understand<00:04:23.820> the<00:04:23.880> point<00:04:24.060> of<00:04:24.180> that<00:04:24.360> but

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020
