of a battlefield for people that don't

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.090 
of a battlefield for people that don't
know<00:00:36.239> this<00:00:36.809> game<00:00:37.020> so<00:00:37.260> well<00:00:37.440> it<00:00:37.649> came<00:00:37.860> out<00:00:38.010> in

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
know this game so well it came out in

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.330 
know this game so well it came out in
2002<00:00:39.059> is<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.930> original<00:00:40.379> battlefield<00:00:40.829> fatal

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
2002 is the original battlefield fatal

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.720 
2002 is the original battlefield fatal
and<00:00:42.290> yeah<00:00:43.290> but<00:00:43.770> that's<00:00:44.040> all<00:00:44.190> there<00:00:44.340> is<00:00:44.370> really

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
and yeah but that's all there is really

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.270 
and yeah but that's all there is really
to<00:00:44.910> it<00:00:45.059> so<00:00:45.780> i<00:00:46.260> think<00:00:46.350> i<00:00:46.649> may<00:00:46.770> actually<00:00:46.980> be

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
to it so i think i may actually be

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.459 
to it so i think i may actually be
playing<00:00:47.550> on<00:00:47.789> one<00:00:48.270> of<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.510> expansions<00:00:49.200> because

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
got a lot of flaws though for example

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.660 
got a lot of flaws though for example
the<00:02:14.900> spawn<00:02:15.170> system<00:02:15.440> see<00:02:16.250> that<00:02:16.459> right<00:02:16.610> there

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
the spawn system see that right there

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.309 
the spawn system see that right there
see<00:02:17.060> this<00:02:17.209> base<00:02:17.390> I'm<00:02:17.569> looking<00:02:17.840> at<00:02:17.959> right<00:02:17.989> see

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:18.319 
see this base I'm looking at right see

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:19.449 
see this base I'm looking at right see
on<00:02:18.410> the<00:02:18.530> right<00:02:18.680> there<00:02:18.860> with<00:02:19.010> that<00:02:19.040> explosion

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:19.459 
on the right there with that explosion

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:21.490 
on the right there with that explosion
just<00:02:19.790> happened<00:02:20.120> that's<00:02:20.569> a<00:02:20.690> howitzer<00:02:21.019> gun

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
just happened that's a howitzer gun

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.820 
just happened that's a howitzer gun
that's<00:02:22.430> overlooking<00:02:22.880> a<00:02:23.120> spawn<00:02:23.420> why<00:02:24.110> that

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
that's overlooking a spawn why that

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.880 
that's overlooking a spawn why that
doesn't<00:02:25.099> make<00:02:25.190> any<00:02:25.310> sense<00:02:25.760> late<00:02:26.480> really<00:02:27.019> it's

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
doesn't make any sense late really it's

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.400 
doesn't make any sense late really it's
so<00:02:28.130> stupid<00:02:28.670> I<00:02:28.880> doubt<00:02:29.510> really<00:02:29.959> roll<00:02:30.140> it<00:02:30.230> in<00:02:30.319> this

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
so stupid I doubt really roll it in this

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:32.530 
so stupid I doubt really roll it in this
