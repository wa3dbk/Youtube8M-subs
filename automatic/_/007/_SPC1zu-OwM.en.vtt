about<00:00:26.010> three<00:00:26.220> years<00:00:26.430> ago<00:00:26.580> with<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:27.869> idea<00:00:28.199> of

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
about three years ago with the idea of

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.080 
about three years ago with the idea of
building<00:00:28.500> a<00:00:28.740> flying<00:00:29.010> car<00:00:29.310> I've<00:00:29.550> been<00:00:29.699> thinking

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
building a flying car I've been thinking

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.569 
building a flying car I've been thinking
about<00:00:30.210> that<00:00:30.510> forever<00:00:30.990> so<00:00:31.650> we<00:00:31.800> spent<00:00:32.040> a<00:00:32.099> year

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
about that forever so we spent a year

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.790 
about that forever so we spent a year
doing<00:00:32.969> that<00:00:33.300> is<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:33.570> engineering<00:00:34.170> work<00:00:34.380> and

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
doing that is the engineering work and

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.889 
doing that is the engineering work and
the<00:00:34.890> designing<00:00:35.250> of<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.880> of<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.450> air<00:00:36.600> car

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
the designing of the of the air car

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.430 
the designing of the of the air car
which<00:00:37.200> you<00:00:37.350> can<00:00:37.469> see<00:00:37.500> here<00:00:37.710> and<00:00:38.570> very<00:00:39.570> early<00:00:40.410> on

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
which you can see here and very early on

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.530 
which you can see here and very early on
in<00:00:40.829> that<00:00:40.980> process<00:00:41.280> it<00:00:41.879> occurred<00:00:42.180> to<00:00:42.210> us<00:00:42.390> that

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
in that process it occurred to us that

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.959 
in that process it occurred to us that
while<00:00:43.500> we<00:00:43.739> were<00:00:43.860> building<00:00:44.129> a<00:00:44.370> vehicle<00:00:44.820> that

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
while we were building a vehicle that

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.790 
while we were building a vehicle that
needed<00:00:45.239> to<00:00:45.270> be<00:00:45.360> aerodynamic<00:00:46.170> and<00:00:46.350> lightweight

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
needed to be aerodynamic and lightweight

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.770 
needed to be aerodynamic and lightweight
and<00:00:47.160> strong<00:00:47.760> enough<00:00:48.149> to<00:00:48.239> drive<00:00:48.480> on<00:00:48.660> the

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
and strong enough to drive on the

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.750 
and strong enough to drive on the
highway<00:00:48.809> we<00:00:49.739> should<00:00:49.920> also<00:00:50.070> build<00:00:50.370> an<00:00:50.610> electric

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
highway we should also build an electric

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.990 
highway we should also build an electric
car<00:00:51.149> so<00:00:51.840> within<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:52.980> first<00:00:53.219> six<00:00:53.430> months<00:00:53.640> we

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
car so within the first six months we

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.540 
car so within the first six months we
had<00:00:54.210> decided<00:00:54.539> to<00:00:54.780> build<00:00:55.140> not<00:00:55.860> only<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.280> flying

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
had decided to build not only the flying

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.990 
had decided to build not only the flying
car<00:00:56.850> but<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:57.809> electric<00:00:58.199> car<00:00:58.379> in<00:00:58.680> January<00:00:59.670> of

car but the electric car in January of
06<00:01:00.870> we<00:01:01.680> started<00:01:02.129> building<00:01:02.340> actual<00:01:02.969> prototypes

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
06 we started building actual prototypes

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.119 
06 we started building actual prototypes
and<00:01:03.719> we've<00:01:03.899> been<00:01:04.049> working<00:01:04.199> on<00:01:04.500> these<00:01:04.650> for<00:01:04.979> two

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
and we've been working on these for two

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.520 
and we've been working on these for two
years<00:01:05.369> now<00:01:05.670> now<00:01:06.299> this<00:01:06.510> is<00:01:06.570> our<00:01:06.810> electric<00:01:07.290> car

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530

plenty<00:02:41.590> of<00:02:41.740> power<00:02:41.860> for<00:02:42.010> us<00:02:42.280> we've<00:02:42.670> been

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
plenty of power for us we've been

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.870 
plenty of power for us we've been
driving<00:02:43.090> the<00:02:43.450> electric<00:02:43.810> car<00:02:44.190> and<00:02:45.190> this<00:02:45.700> is

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
driving the electric car and this is

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.570 
driving the electric car and this is
about<00:02:46.090> our<00:02:46.150> sixth<00:02:46.720> version<00:02:47.620> of<00:02:47.800> these<00:02:48.070> motors

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
about our sixth version of these motors

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.280 
about our sixth version of these motors
but<00:02:48.940> I<00:02:49.180> think<00:02:49.690> we're<00:02:49.840> getting<00:02:49.930> close<00:02:50.080> to

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
but I think we're getting close to

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.470 
but I think we're getting close to
having<00:02:50.739> a<00:02:50.950> good<00:02:51.130> unit<00:02:51.610> that<00:02:51.820> will<00:02:51.910> drive<00:02:52.180> right

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
having a good unit that will drive right

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.710 
having a good unit that will drive right
now<00:02:53.410> we're<00:02:53.620> using<00:02:53.770> lead<00:02:54.100> acid<00:02:54.489> batteries<00:02:54.970> but

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
now we're using lead acid batteries but

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.650 
now we're using lead acid batteries but
once<00:02:56.020> we<00:02:56.260> have<00:02:56.560> the<00:02:56.890> motor<00:02:57.160> unit<00:02:57.660> finalized

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
once we have the motor unit finalized

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.780 
once we have the motor unit finalized
then<00:02:59.170> we<00:02:59.380> well<00:03:00.130> we've<00:03:00.280> already<00:03:00.459> started

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
then we well we've already started

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.580 
then we well we've already started
talking<00:03:01.270> to<00:03:01.300> people<00:03:01.390> companies<00:03:02.230> about

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
talking to people companies about

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.310 
talking to people companies about
lithium-ion<00:03:03.489> batteries<00:03:04.120> we<00:03:04.870> expect<00:03:05.200> the

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:05.320 
lithium-ion batteries we expect the

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.940 
lithium-ion batteries we expect the
batteries<00:03:05.709> to<00:03:05.890> weigh<00:03:06.040> about<00:03:06.280> 150<00:03:07.000> pounds<00:03:07.950> and

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.110 
do you feel once you're in one of these

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:19.110 
do you feel once you're in one of these

about<00:03:51.310> 65<00:03:51.880> miles<00:03:52.150> an<00:03:52.360> hour<00:03:52.480> is<00:03:52.780> the<00:03:52.900> fastest

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.410 
about 65 miles an hour is the fastest

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:56.490 
about 65 miles an hour is the fastest
speed<00:03:54.010> so<00:03:54.250> far<00:03:54.549> but<00:03:55.329> it's<00:03:55.450> very<00:03:55.690> stable<00:03:56.110> very

speed so far but it's very stable very
sure-footed<00:03:56.790> how<00:03:57.790> much<00:03:58.000> would<00:03:58.180> one<00:03:58.299> of<00:03:58.450> these

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:02.340 
sure-footed how much would one of these
cars<00:03:58.900> go<00:03:59.170> for<00:03:59.530> on<00:03:59.799> a<00:03:59.829> regular<00:04:00.070> market<00:04:01.110> well<00:04:02.110> I'm

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:02.350 
cars go for on a regular market well I'm

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:04.650 
cars go for on a regular market well I'm
hoping<00:04:02.799> for<00:04:03.130> less<00:04:03.670> than<00:04:03.880> thirty<00:04:04.150> thousand

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:04.660 
hoping for less than thirty thousand

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:07.440 
hoping for less than thirty thousand
dollars<00:04:04.989> my<00:04:05.320> son<00:04:05.620> thinks<00:04:05.890> less<00:04:06.250> than<00:04:06.459> 40<00:04:06.880> it's

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:07.450 
dollars my son thinks less than 40 it's

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:09.180 
dollars my son thinks less than 40 it's
really<00:04:07.660> a<00:04:07.750> function<00:04:08.170> of<00:04:08.200> the<00:04:08.350> battery<00:04:08.709> costs

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.190 
really a function of the battery costs

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:11.729 
really a function of the battery costs
and<00:04:09.370> battery<00:04:09.880> costs<00:04:10.329> are<00:04:10.450> coming<00:04:10.630> down<00:04:10.780> quite

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:11.739 
and battery costs are coming down quite

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:14.160 
and battery costs are coming down quite
a<00:04:11.769> bit<00:04:11.890> there<00:04:12.360> they're<00:04:13.360> half<00:04:13.690> of<00:04:13.870> what<00:04:14.019> they

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:14.170 
a bit there they're half of what they

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:16.650 
a bit there they're half of what they
were<00:04:14.230> a<00:04:14.380> year<00:04:14.650> and<00:04:14.799> a<00:04:14.829> half<00:04:15.010> ago<00:04:15.160> so<00:04:15.970> a<00:04:16.299> lot<00:04:16.630> of

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:16.660 
were a year and a half ago so a lot of

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:18.150 
were a year and a half ago so a lot of
people<00:04:16.810> are<00:04:17.140> working<00:04:17.320> on<00:04:17.530> lithium<00:04:17.890> ion

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.160 
people are working on lithium ion

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.819 
people are working on lithium ion
batteries<00:04:18.640> for<00:04:18.970> automotive<00:04:19.540> purposes<00:04:20.049> so<00:04:20.799> I

00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:20.829 
batteries for automotive purposes so I

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:23.390 
batteries for automotive purposes so I
can<00:04:21.250> envision<00:04:21.640> this<00:04:22.120> being<00:04:22.180> in<00:04:22.570> the<00:04:22.660> mid-20s

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
can envision this being in the mid-20s

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.670 
can envision this being in the mid-20s
25,000<00:04:24.400> well<00:04:24.729> this<00:04:24.880> is<00:04:25.090> a<00:04:25.120> totally

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
25,000 well this is a totally

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.980 
25,000 well this is a totally
operation<00:04:27.340> and<00:04:27.639> once<00:04:28.360> you<00:04:28.509> get<00:04:28.690> rid<00:04:28.810> of<00:04:28.870> the

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 
operation and once you get rid of the

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:30.990 
operation and once you get rid of the
gasoline<00:04:29.470> engine<00:04:29.830> you<00:04:29.979> get<00:04:30.160> rid<00:04:30.639> of<00:04:30.669> a<00:04:30.789> lot<00:04:30.940> of

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
gasoline engine you get rid of a lot of

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.629 
gasoline engine you get rid of a lot of
weight<00:04:31.270> and<00:04:31.479> this<00:04:32.380> will<00:04:32.590> weigh<00:04:32.830> about<00:04:33.009> half<00:04:33.400> of

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:33.639 
weight and this will weigh about half of

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:36.120 
weight and this will weigh about half of
what<00:04:33.699> a<00:04:33.910> Prius<00:04:34.330> has<00:04:34.539> my<00:04:34.780> wife<00:04:34.990> has<00:04:35.199> a<00:04:35.229> Prius<00:04:35.590> she

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:36.130 
what a Prius has my wife has a Prius she

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:38.610 
what a Prius has my wife has a Prius she
likes<00:04:36.340> it<00:04:36.550> but<00:04:37.360> this<00:04:37.539> is<00:04:37.750> a<00:04:37.780> lighter<00:04:38.050> vehicle

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:38.620 
likes it but this is a lighter vehicle

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:40.800 
likes it but this is a lighter vehicle
and<00:04:38.979> so<00:04:39.160> it<00:04:39.280> needs<00:04:39.460> less<00:04:39.729> horsepower<00:04:40.000> it's

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:40.810 
and so it needs less horsepower it's

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:42.930 
and so it needs less horsepower it's
more<00:04:41.020> aerodynamic<00:04:41.740> and<00:04:41.919> it<00:04:42.340> doesn't<00:04:42.669> need<00:04:42.759> the

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:42.940 
more aerodynamic and it doesn't need the

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:46.529 
more aerodynamic and it doesn't need the
gas<00:04:43.060> engine<00:04:43.539> except<00:04:44.380> for<00:04:44.410> charging<00:04:45.389> hope<00:04:46.389> you

00:04:46.529 --> 00:04:46.539 
gas engine except for charging hope you

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:48.060 
gas engine except for charging hope you
