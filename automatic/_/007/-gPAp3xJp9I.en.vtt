00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:09.990
 good morning to all this video e 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.840
 collaboration with a guy who does 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.210
 cooking video tutorials look at that 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:19.250
 beautiful these fingers handmade by her and 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.250
 I think they are also very good 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:27.539
 to see the video of claudia di 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.810

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.810
 image 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.379
 and this is my trick proposal 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.969
 ty 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:55.159
 first of all by year of the team for 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:57.350
 nails and choose the right size for 

00:00:55.159 --> 00:01:00.670
 every nail I use the e'quipe because 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.670
 they are easier to cut 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.610
 once the cuts are applied, why not 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:18.990
 never saw a zombie with an average 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.990
 perfect france 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:33.549
 now I'm going with foam rubber 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:35.880
 to give a first pass on the whole 

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:35.880
 but no 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:51.479
 I apply the codon a little everywhere for 

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:54.479
 create the base of the scales that makes roth 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.479
 subsequently 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:07.430
 and I make another pass of latex 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:11.380
 on the whole hand more passes do more 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:11.380
 your hand will have fine lines 

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:52.019
 now I close my ring finger and my little finger and I do 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:54.959
 a pass of latex this way yes 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:59.239
 creates a patina between the two almost a 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:59.239
 simulate torn skin 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:07.310
 continues the application of cotton in 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:07.310
 latex 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:19.540
 now you have to be very careful not to 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:22.480
 hurt you because with a little frame 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:24.930
 I'm going to tear the paper by creating 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.930
 gashes 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:37.650
 I speak of talcum powder anyway so that 

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:37.650
 the latex is no longer sticky 

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:50.640
 recreates a two-color cream gray 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:50.640
 and lots anyway 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:12.879
 with the black cream I dirty it 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:15.480
 further the nails and some parts 

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:15.480
 of the hand 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:32.230
 cut the nails a little more so 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:32.230
 that meters are closed which is possible 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:42.430
 other things we are and fake in dark paste 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:46.830
 inside the gaps on the lap of 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:46.830
 cuticles and even a little between the fingers 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:10.160
 and now also some liquid blood 

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:40.880
 here is also below the nails and 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:42.800
 on the fingertips and once dry 

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:45.280
 don't go away because it will be like one 

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:45.280
 crust 

00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:00.759
 I hope you enjoyed the tutorial there 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:02.650
