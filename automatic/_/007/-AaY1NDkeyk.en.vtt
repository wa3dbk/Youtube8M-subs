00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:07.700
 next update that each time 

00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:09.320
 closer to those who have 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:10.610
 been asking through twitter and 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:13.009
 my other social networks have told me 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:15.200
 Hey Peter when you think it's no 

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:17.270
 we take into account the images that 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.680
 I put yesterday where good as you know 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:19.820
 If you have not seen the video I invite you to 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.769
 well the video that I was yesterday in 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.410
 where he had told them he would bet 

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:26.000
 uploaded this content by mistake 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.529
 had not done it had not already gone up the 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.599
 content had only gone up is 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:30.859
 strictly what I was going to see see that 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:33.740
 I had told them that this was going to be 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:35.660
 of clan war or stop in out that I in that 

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:37.430
 moment I did not know very well that n 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.380
 I told them that if you knew that what 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.330
 will comment for it someone told me what 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:42.860
 which to me is very pulled this does not 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.560
 is what I clarify because then not to win 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.150
 because he is saying 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:48.890
 friends clarifies that it is not so 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.970
 I only mention it because good this one 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.500
 when to see that serves their 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:53.120
 comments so when I tell them 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.980
 this one even you comment finished 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.690
 young that yes I do it although not always 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:00.510
 I answer if I read your comments 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.710
 this when this person said that what 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.190
 that it was going to be that we were going to 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.659
 let's say you left a clan and you said 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:09.000
 there you do not know that I do not like the clan and 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.100
 it happened to me if I kept looking for another tb 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.690
 Clan is I was getting very dirty 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.820
 why because then generally 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:16.530
 I would look for this clan it's easy it's also 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.299
 the others create easy clans then 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.640
 you will simply never find 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.960
 I would find an easy clan because I no longer 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.070
 only you have to accept but the 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.110
 opposing team also has to 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.030
 accept then it would be like that a 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.360
 eternal no no no no no no mention 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.310
 a stupidity be pretty big that 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.050
 but then well at the end of accounts that 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.179
 yes super being what we did that 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:38.220
 we did not be the same action 

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:40.020
 stupidity what to improve walls with the 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.119
 extinct way this super being did it 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.590
 I insist to my friends they know that a lot 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.960
 People love me personally no 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.630
 I like it and well now let's go to what 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.100
 what does this image mean 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.920
 Does this mean that you are of the opinion 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.830
 you will be able to press a button and say 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.899
 You know I'm out in the war 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.310
 what are you going to do good in the next 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.930
 war that is going to be done in the clan and 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.000
 I, I am inside 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:07.720
 this is going to be active I do not know if you put 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.840
 you are in what would I'm in 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:12.510
 in Spanish you could say 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.010
 if it is not reached for example in the case of 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.780
 many plans like mine where 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:19.440
 we generally declare war the 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:21.209
 Friday and I start looking or in the 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.489
 quarries put to look as it says that 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:26.250
 if you are going to take into account not if 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:29.970
 let's say there are 50 members and 45 says 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:31.769
 that they are and 47 let's say if they are 47 good 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.959
 then 45 own account and 5 are going to 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:34.560
 enter the last two 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:36.720
 unfortunately for the three that 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.120
 They said they were out by X 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.459
 Juan, they will not be able to enter this one 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:44.640
 it's out that would be good I'm 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:46.920
 outside nm this time it 's good 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.380
 because this would happen for people who 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.150
 Suddenly, you're on exams if you do not 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:55.140
 can that weekend because they are 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:56.819
 final exams of things like that because what 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:59.099
 they punish suddenly that it happens to happen 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:00.209
 what has happened to me then these examples 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:02.129
 what I am giving you are things that have 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:03.870
 happened because he had a week 

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:05.310
 excellent stealing black elixir and is 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.310
 down the brewers can not use them 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.920
 and the most 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:13.680
 most common that usually happens more when 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.569
 you're already in town councils 8 9 and 10 that 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.950
 it takes too many days it 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:20.220
 it practically took a week in 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:23.970
 improve in the laboratory azkena the 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:26.099
 casserole of spells well and with 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.050
 this you can generally say what 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:30.180
 they said is that they told you they mention hear me 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:31.860
 pita you know you 're here juanchito a 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.780
 Panchito and Menganita because this week 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.459
 as they just went up town hall level 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.959
 9 since the grains can not be 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:39.599
 chance spells are not going to have it in 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:41.340
 the casserole the best take them out then 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:42.540
 instead of that for example I have 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.940
 to be remembering if I have them 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.380
 be pulling out not you just list 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.390
 Well, when I'm lowering the pot, 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.830
 I will be able to participate, lend you the 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:52.769
 vote where I'm out in this 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:55.170
 occasion and already possess will reduce people 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:56.790
 that will be able to play this too 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:59.099
 works for example if you break the 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.780
 cellular the tablet or by the west you 

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:02.580
 they steal the cell phone as it happened to me 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.440
 and some time and that's why I have not had 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:05.130
 a good cell since I stole my 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.610
 iphone 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:11.450
 many many years ago 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:14.240
 with 4% interesting but good 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:15.710
 then there you put yourself out and 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:17.269
 while rules that kind of 

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:18.920
 problems do not then you feel bad 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:20.630
 because there are problems at home checking 

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:22.730
 the good one puts him in Saudi and fixes 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:24.620
 as long as today I say here I am 

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:27.230
 already this is a personal advice that 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:29.300
 I give to clan leaders and all that 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:31.520
 well try to get these people who 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.840
 they are out to explain it to you 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.790
 try to say you know that I am 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:36.860
 out for that reason for the same reason but 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:38.630
 the next week already within this to 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:41.300
 end of accounts because because you imagine 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:43.250
 you have a plan of 50 but of 50 25 30 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:45.290
 you set us 40 this case only with 25 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:47.060
 wat countries I do not know at the end of accounts 

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:49.910
 well then make a war with 25 but 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:51.680
 does not have the same impact does not have like 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:53.960
 I feel it's more fun when 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:55.880
 everyone comes in order at least with this 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:58.010
 As you can already decide if you want 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:00.710
 come out I think it's a 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:03.020
 update something at least this point 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:05.240
 will help many but I also think 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:07.490
 it is very important that also the 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:09.800
 leaders of each clan in this whether from 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:12.320
 argentina from spain from colombia from here 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:14.000
 from mexico always say you know that if 

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:15.920
 we make for example only war the 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.240
 Friday tell them you know I'll declare you 

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:18.470
 the war at 11 in the morning I'm going to 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:21.080
 declare war at 5 o'clock in the afternoon 

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:22.610
 not specific very well of what schedule 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:24.620
 from what country so for example if jon 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:26.630
 to declare 3 in the afternoon here 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:28.460
 now the center of mexico is 10 

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:30.200
 the night in Spain not then with 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:31.960
 that you get to a this one goes back to 

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:33.889
 declare this time on the morning 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:36.469
 with 24 hours 

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:38.419
 in advance there was a message to the plan 

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:41.030
 and that you 're already implying to the 

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:43.099
 clan that have so much time for this 

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:45.469
 put on and not out 

00:05:43.099 --> 00:05:48.289
 and well practically that would be the biggest 

00:05:45.469 --> 00:05:49.969
 of this image also taking advantage of 

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:52.279
 about the forums and that there was no 

00:05:49.969 --> 00:05:55.039
 commented is a small improvement towards 

00:05:52.279 --> 00:05:56.719
 healing that's good right here in 

00:05:55.039 --> 00:05:58.129
 Town hall level shoot with the account 

00:05:56.719 --> 00:06:01.099
 main because it gives me exactly what 

00:05:58.129 --> 00:06:02.569
 same but with the small account and in 

00:06:01.099 --> 00:06:05.599
 wars and that I think it will be 

00:06:02.569 --> 00:06:07.430
 quite interesting and is that the 

00:06:05.599 --> 00:06:09.770
 air traps will no longer do 

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:11.810
 no harm that they will no longer activate 

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:14.060
 they will go through and the winners and although 

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:15.680
 there are the aerial traps are not going to 

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:18.080
 do absolutely nothing anymore 

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:20.120
 activate this however the defenses 

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:22.550
 Thus, airs are still lethal for 

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:23.930
 they still think that you already saw 

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:25.550
 all year that I was using the 

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:27.620
 winners that my mentions a proper 

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:29.750
 excellent up to town hall level 9 

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:32.120
 full level 10 city hall is not good 

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:34.600
 is that little improvement I would like 

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:37.360
 know your comments what do you think 

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:38.800
 I like this option I would use it not 

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:40.510
 I would use all that you can leave me 

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:42.280
 here remember that all the information 

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:44.530
 diet has put you in some images 

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:46.180
 both in yesterday's video and in my 

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:47.590
 twitter for a couple of days 

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:48.760
 back four days ago in case 

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:51.280
 you want to continue on twitter and that's how it is 

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:53.680
 trained this when I find out 

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:55.450
 when I hear rumors I put them with 

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:57.220
 capital letters are rumors so that later 

00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:58.300
 you win that you told me nothing, not me 

00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:00.310
 when I say that they are rumors are 

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:01.720
 rumors friends but good the 

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:03.520
 update looks very father like them 

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:06.250
 I said at the beginning of the video I think 

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:08.260
 the images that I had put them of what 

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:10.540

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:13.480

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:15.700
 fall between Tuesday no later than 

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:17.080

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:20.170
 on Wednesday since the update 

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:21.370

00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:24.360
