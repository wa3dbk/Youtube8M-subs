00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:08.799
 and this day I will be sharing with 

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:11.650
 you a super easy recipe 

00:00:08.799 --> 00:00:13.749
 prepare distilled or shredded meat 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:16.059
 with egg so let's see the 

00:00:13.749 --> 00:00:19.720
 ingredients one pound of beef 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:24.700
 to distill a whole garlic 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:28.120
 half onion salt 6 to 7 eggs oil 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:31.180
 olive a quarter of chopped onion 2 

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:35.090
 chopped tomatoes a green chili cut 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:36.920
 in julienne consume beef to taste 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.510
 to start preparing the meat what 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.180
 first thing we're going to do is that in a 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:43.340
 pot with hot water let's add 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:46.570
 the meat very carefully not 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:49.829
 burn we're going to add the garlic 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:52.390
 the onion and salt to taste 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:55.989
 now let's let it cook up 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:59.050
 that the meat is soft after 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:01.750
 approximately 15 or 20 minutes already 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:04.150
 that the meat is completely cooked and 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:06.729
 is soft, we are going to remove it from 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:08.920
 fire let's let it cool down by 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:11.740
 a few minutes before starting to distill 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:14.890
 so we're not going to burn 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:17.290
 since the meat is cooked very well like this 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.770
 easy is how it has to be for 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.770
 density 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.530
 and now let's mix the eggs 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:37.730
 Now in a pan preheated to fire 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.870
 medium low we're going to add oil 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:43.140
 olive 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:45.950
 and we will saute onion and tomato 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.950
 the green chile 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:52.470
 since we have let the vegetables 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:56.480
 well for a few minutes let's add the 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.480
 meat and let's mix everything very well 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:06.310
 and now let's season with consumption of 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:08.740
 time to taste remember that the seasoning each 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.479
 who put it on so it is necessary 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:14.730
 to try them to see if we need 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.730
 a little bit more so if it's okay 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.770
 and now let's leave the meat together with 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.230
 the vegetables suffering for a few minutes 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:25.690
 in my house they like that the meat is 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:28.330
 well golden brown so I'll leave it for 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:30.610
 about 5 minutes until 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:33.220
 the flesh has thus gained a color 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:36.050
 little gold being very careful that the 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.910
 meat will not burn 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.860
 now let's add the eggs 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.410
 previously shakes and we're going to 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:45.170
 make sure to stir everything very well 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:47.180
 so that all the meat remains stirred 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:50.350
 with the egg and we will not be left 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.350
 meat without eggs 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:59.560
 since egg is fully cooked 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:01.989
 we are ready to serve you 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.120
 I hope you enjoyed the recipe that
