00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
 hi to klee pts today i bring you the nokia 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:08.370
 Lumia 610 but before as I also have 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.139
 around here the Nokia Lumia 900 because I 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.360
 I'm going to teach a little bit like we did 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.910
 a video review of the Nokia Lumia 800 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.640
 Well, I just tell you very fast 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.470
 the differences because it really is the 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.800
 same phone the fundamental difference 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:25.320
 is that the 800 has a screen of 3.7 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.949
 inches amoled exactly the same as 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.420
 this one only that this is 4.3 inches 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:33.630
 another one of the differences because they are the 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:36.600
 colors while the 800 had color 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.879
 white or black blue and magenta this by 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.760
 example is not available in color 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:45.899
 magenta and finally the weight 160 grams 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:50.910
 compared to 142 grams that weighs 800 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:53.579
 prices 575 the 800 costs 399 euros 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.460
 come on let's go with the 610 or the eclipse test 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.870
 today I bring you a new phone this time 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.940
 how is it going to be very quick then I do it 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.500
 a mini videogram plan and it's already 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.049
 you already know the windows phone 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.430
 because we already talked about what 800 and in 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:09.700
 this time I'm going to talk to you 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:11.530
 Nokia Lumia 610 because this phone 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.170
 because it's a cheap phone 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.910
 in the 250 euros is a phone that is 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.680
 very well built is very nice 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:20.680
 elegant available in various colors in 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:24.310
 blue magenta in white and in this color 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:28.119
 black the screen is 3.7 inches with 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:30.369
 a resolution of 800 x 480 pixels is 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:31.930
 Pretty colorful is very fluid works 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:34.600
 very well it is also true that windows 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:37.390
 phone works quite well and then 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:40.300
 basically it has three buttons 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:42.009
 of browsing windows phones in the 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:44.410
 part above we have a 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:48.220
 minijack connection we have here the 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:51.280
 microusb connection and we have here the 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:53.020
 5 megapixel camera you have here 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.420
 in the back that has theme 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.860
 also from a led flash 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.740
 over here we have the power button 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:02.320
 turn off the volume controls and this 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:05.009
 another button is the shortcut button 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.009
 to the camera 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.580
 the camera is very normal 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:12.560
 vga resolution but good has also 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.330
 face detection has different 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.940
 scene modes such as mode 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.349
 night or landscape mode but the best 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.790
 which has of course is windows phone 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:21.410
 which is an operating system that already 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.680
 you know it is very fluid this is the 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:28.099
 version 7.5 but it has a fat non- stick 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.739
 very fat and that is because if not what 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:32.299
 you know a few days ago he showed up 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:34.310
 windows phone 8 that will be available in 

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:36.379
 autumn any terminal that has 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.970
 sold before will not be able to 

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:40.430
 upgrade to windows was an 8 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.080
 that yes as a solution let's say 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.390
 commitment are going to launch a 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.190
 update that is 7.8 but if you are 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.959

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.090
 do not die for the updates yes 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.130
 It is true that they are always improving 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.760
 little things and a smartphone man has you 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:04.190

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:06.890
 200 300 or 400 euros and that within three 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.989
 months has become obsolete as 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.510
