00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:58.480 
metal rescue rust remover bath so it's

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.330 
metal rescue rust remover bath so it's
very<00:00:58.570> very<00:00:58.690> easy<00:00:58.899> there's<00:00:59.649> three<00:00:59.890> simple

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:00.340 
very very easy there's three simple

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.850 
very very easy there's three simple
steps<00:01:00.399> number<00:01:01.390> one<00:01:01.629> you<00:01:02.170> silk<00:01:02.530> your<00:01:02.650> part

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:02.860 
steps number one you silk your part

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.160 
steps number one you silk your part
number<00:01:03.309> two<00:01:03.640> you<00:01:04.119> check<00:01:04.510> your<00:01:04.780> part<00:01:05.019> and

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.170 
number two you check your part and

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.330 
number two you check your part and
number<00:01:05.470> three<00:01:05.710> you<00:01:06.070> rinse<00:01:06.400> and<00:01:06.640> dry<00:01:06.940> your<00:01:06.970> part

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
number three you rinse and dry your part

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.880 
number three you rinse and dry your part
so<00:01:09.340> we're<00:01:09.460> going<00:01:09.520> to<00:01:09.640> start<00:01:09.820> off<00:01:10.030> with<00:01:10.890> number

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:11.890 
so we're going to start off with number

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:14.040 
so we're going to start off with number
one<00:01:12.190> which<00:01:12.700> is<00:01:12.729> soaked<00:01:13.330> in<00:01:13.360> your<00:01:13.570> parts<00:01:13.840> so

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:14.050 
one which is soaked in your parts so

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:16.020 
one which is soaked in your parts so
we'll<00:01:14.259> take<00:01:14.380> a<00:01:14.440> plastic<00:01:14.710> container<00:01:15.009> just<00:01:15.880> like

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.030 
we'll take a plastic container just like

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.870 
we'll take a plastic container just like
this<00:01:16.210> as<00:01:16.600> we<00:01:16.750> said<00:01:16.960> it's<00:01:17.409> safe<00:01:17.590> on<00:01:17.740> plastic<00:01:18.250> so

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
this as we said it's safe on plastic so

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.810 
this as we said it's safe on plastic so
we're<00:01:19.240> going<00:01:19.300> to<00:01:19.420> put<00:01:19.690> our<00:01:20.320> part<00:01:20.530> in<00:01:20.680> the<00:01:20.950> metal

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:21.820 
we're going to put our part in the metal

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:23.730 
we're going to put our part in the metal
rescue<00:01:22.150> now<00:01:22.390> as<00:01:22.750> you<00:01:22.930> can<00:01:23.050> see<00:01:23.110> take<00:01:23.530> a<00:01:23.560> good

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:23.740 
rescue now as you can see take a good

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.070 
rescue now as you can see take a good
look<00:01:23.950> at<00:01:24.100> this<00:01:24.280> it's<00:01:25.270> a<00:01:25.330> lot<00:01:25.509> of<00:01:25.630> rust<00:01:25.750> on<00:01:25.899> that

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.080 
look at this it's a lot of rust on that

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.580 
look at this it's a lot of rust on that
part<00:01:26.490> it<00:01:27.490> also<00:01:27.640> has<00:01:27.940> wood<00:01:28.479> and<00:01:28.750> there's<00:01:29.410> some

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.590 
part it also has wood and there's some

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:30.900 
part it also has wood and there's some
dissimilar<00:01:30.009> metals<00:01:30.160> here<00:01:30.520> it<00:01:30.610> looks<00:01:30.759> like

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:30.910 
dissimilar metals here it looks like

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:32.790 
dissimilar metals here it looks like
there's<00:01:31.060> brass<00:01:31.360> on<00:01:31.660> there<00:01:31.840> so<00:01:32.050> you<00:01:32.680> just

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:32.800 
there's brass on there so you just

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.650 
there's brass on there so you just
simply<00:01:33.039> want<00:01:33.310> to<00:01:33.369> drop<00:01:33.550> that<00:01:33.729> in<00:01:33.940> the<00:01:34.119> in<00:01:34.330> the

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:34.660 
simply want to drop that in the in the

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:40.499 
simply want to drop that in the in the
container<00:01:35.789> take<00:01:36.789> metal<00:01:37.090> rescue<00:01:38.610> now<00:01:39.610> you<00:01:39.670> want

00:01:40.499 --> 00:01:40.509 
container take metal rescue now you want

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:42.150 
container take metal rescue now you want
to<00:01:40.570> make<00:01:40.660> sure<00:01:40.690> that<00:01:40.990> you<00:01:41.080> have<00:01:41.229> the<00:01:41.259> pre<00:01:41.530> part

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:42.160 
to make sure that you have the pre part

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.609 
to make sure that you have the pre part
completely<00:01:42.460> covered<00:01:43.030> and<00:01:43.780> you<00:01:43.929> can<00:01:44.050> see<00:01:44.259> is<00:01:44.470> I

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:44.619 
completely covered and you can see is I

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:46.139 
completely covered and you can see is I
have<00:01:44.830> my<00:01:44.920> hand<00:01:44.950> in<00:01:45.220> the<00:01:45.310> solution<00:01:45.729> it's<00:01:46.000> very

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:46.149 
have my hand in the solution it's very

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:49.680 
have my hand in the solution it's very
very<00:01:46.390> safe<00:01:47.369> so<00:01:48.369> step<00:01:48.640> number<00:01:48.670> two<00:01:49.000> is<00:01:49.210> check

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:49.690 
very safe so step number two is check

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:52.350 
very safe so step number two is check
