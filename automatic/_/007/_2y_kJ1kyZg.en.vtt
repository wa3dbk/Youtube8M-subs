00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:07.530 
so we are going to introduce to you the

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:09.860 
so we are going to introduce to you the

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
biometric viable to point out the new

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:11.720 
biometric viable to point out the new
innovation<00:00:10.440> and<00:00:10.590> gun<00:00:10.740> safe<00:00:10.980> technology<00:00:11.370> is

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
innovation and gun safe technology is

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.520 
innovation and gun safe technology is
the<00:00:11.850> finger<00:00:12.090> scan<00:00:12.630> system<00:00:13.139> known<00:00:13.290> as<00:00:13.320> the

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
the finger scan system known as the

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.650 
the finger scan system known as the
biometric<00:00:14.100> system<00:00:14.459> with<00:00:15.150> the<00:00:15.270> touch<00:00:15.420> of<00:00:15.450> a

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
biometric system with the touch of a

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.750 
biometric system with the touch of a
finger<00:00:15.690> you<00:00:16.290> can<00:00:16.470> have<00:00:16.860> instant<00:00:17.130> access<00:00:17.460> to

to store it also if you know it's not
really<00:01:20.630> bent<00:01:20.900> for<00:01:21.110> high<00:01:21.259> security<00:01:21.560> if<00:01:22.040> there

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:22.220 
really bent for high security if there

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.460 
really bent for high security if there
was<00:01:22.310> a<00:01:22.340> burglar<00:01:22.759> at<00:01:22.970> the<00:01:23.180> announcement<00:01:24.140> time

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:24.470 
was a burglar at the announcement time

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:25.780 
was a burglar at the announcement time
to<00:01:24.619> tamper<00:01:25.009> with<00:01:25.040> it<00:01:25.159> they<00:01:25.399> could<00:01:25.580> probably

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:25.790 
to tamper with it they could probably

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.389 
to tamper with it they could probably
get<00:01:26.750> a<00:01:26.780> crowbar<00:01:27.080> under<00:01:27.500> here<00:01:27.710> in<00:01:27.830> Papa<00:01:28.070> door

00:01:28.389 --> 00:01:28.399 
get a crowbar under here in Papa door

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:31.600 
get a crowbar under here in Papa door
open<00:01:28.720> but<00:01:29.720> you<00:01:30.080> know<00:01:30.200> just<00:01:30.409> without<00:01:31.100> any<00:01:31.310> tools

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
open but you know just without any tools

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.749 
open but you know just without any tools

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:34.759 
for a child or for a loved one they

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:36.219 
for a child or for a loved one they
really<00:01:35.030> can't<00:01:35.330> access<00:01:35.750> this<00:01:35.869> made<00:01:36.080> without

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:36.229 
really can't access this made without

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:38.800 
really can't access this made without
for<00:01:36.680> fingerprinting<00:01:37.479> decoded<00:01:38.479> into<00:01:38.630> the
