00:05:13.839 --> 00:05:13.849 
that are still down like either immune

00:05:13.849 --> 00:05:15.580 
that are still down like either immune
and<00:05:14.090> you're<00:05:14.240> not<00:05:14.360> getting<00:05:14.690> any<00:05:14.870> hits<00:05:15.139> on<00:05:15.380> them

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:15.590

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:20.120 
hitting critical hits it's just not

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:23.170 
hitting critical hits it's just not
giving<00:05:20.510> any<00:05:20.690> damage<00:05:21.580> but<00:05:22.580> you<00:05:22.729> still<00:05:22.940> get<00:05:23.030> your

00:05:25.779 --> 00:05:25.789 
ammo bag and I like that think that's a

00:05:25.789 --> 00:05:27.790 
ammo bag and I like that think that's a
good<00:05:25.909> feature<00:05:26.180> of<00:05:26.479> the<00:05:26.570> white<00:05:26.750> nail<00:05:27.020> the<00:05:27.620> one
