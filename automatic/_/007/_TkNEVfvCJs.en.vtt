00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
turning the first and second layers you

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.400 
turning the first and second layers you
know<00:00:35.969> I<00:00:36.000> still<00:00:36.149> do<00:00:36.540> I<00:00:36.570> haven't<00:00:36.989> lubed<00:00:37.140> it'll

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
it and washed the lube out you know you

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.220 
it and washed the lube out you know you
jiggle<00:00:43.200> ooh<00:00:43.260> so<00:00:44.129> after<00:00:44.760> that<00:00:45.030> it<00:00:45.870> was<00:00:45.989> better

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
jiggle ooh so after that it was better

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.240 
jiggle ooh so after that it was better
now<00:00:47.059> turning<00:00:48.059> on<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.390> first<00:00:48.629> layer<00:00:49.250> it's

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
now turning on the first layer it's

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.369 
now turning on the first layer it's
really<00:00:50.670> bumpy<00:00:50.910> really<00:00:51.660> really<00:00:51.870> bumpy<00:00:52.170> and

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
really bumpy really really bumpy and

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:53.720 
really bumpy really really bumpy and
catches<00:00:52.829> act<00:00:52.980> travel<00:00:53.219> to<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.370> second<00:00:53.640> layer

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
catches act travel to the second layer

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.330 
catches act travel to the second layer
you<00:00:53.879> see<00:00:54.030> that<00:00:54.149> it<00:00:54.660> catches<00:00:54.930> on<00:00:55.199> to<00:00:55.350> it<00:00:55.559> that's

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
you see that it catches on to it that's

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.599 
you see that it catches on to it that's
not<00:00:56.579> good<00:00:57.559> now<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.620> second<00:00:59.100> layer<00:00:59.219> on<00:00:59.489> the

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
not good now the second layer on the

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.029 
not good now the second layer on the
other<00:00:59.699> hand<00:01:00.109> once<00:01:01.109> you<00:01:01.230> break<00:01:01.410> in<00:01:01.710> a<00:01:01.739> little

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
other hand once you break in a little

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.270 
other hand once you break in a little
bit<00:01:02.129> a<00:01:02.160> bit<00:01:02.309> better<00:01:02.550> it<00:01:02.910> turns<00:01:03.420> smooth

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
bit a bit better it turns smooth

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.230 
bit a bit better it turns smooth
actually<00:01:05.280> not<00:01:05.369> that<00:01:05.400> bad<00:01:05.580> to<00:01:05.880> turn<00:01:06.060> you<00:01:06.210> know

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
actually not that bad to turn you know

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.179 
actually not that bad to turn you know
it's<00:01:06.510> really<00:01:06.750> nice<00:01:06.869> put<00:01:07.380> out<00:01:07.470> of<00:01:07.590> box<00:01:07.799> again

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
it's really nice put out of box again

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.109 
it's really nice put out of box again
it's<00:01:08.540> terrible<00:01:09.860> now<00:01:10.860> we'll<00:01:11.400> go<00:01:11.549> into<00:01:11.700> a<00:01:11.850> size

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
it's terrible now we'll go into a size

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.910 
it's terrible now we'll go into a size
comparison<00:01:12.240> now<00:01:12.570> so<00:01:13.020> compared<00:01:13.650> to<00:01:13.740> a<00:01:13.770> normal

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
comparison now so compared to a normal

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:20.840 
comparison now so compared to a normal
Rubik's<00:01:14.310> Cube<00:01:15.020> it's<00:01:16.020> a<00:01:17.210> lot<00:01:18.210> bigger<00:01:19.850> maybe

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
Rubik's Cube it's a lot bigger maybe

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.740 
Rubik's Cube it's a lot bigger maybe
yeah<00:01:21.659> so<00:01:22.049> that's<00:01:22.409> pretty<00:01:22.560> big<00:01:23.390> now<00:01:24.390> compared

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
yeah so that's pretty big now compared

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.819 
yeah so that's pretty big now compared
to<00:01:24.780> megaminx<00:01:25.790> it's<00:01:26.790> a<00:01:26.909> lot<00:01:27.060> bigger<00:01:27.180> now<00:01:27.829> the

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
to megaminx it's a lot bigger now the

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.160 
to megaminx it's a lot bigger now the
Giga<00:01:29.070> minx<00:01:29.400> is<00:01:29.549> different<00:01:30.540> from<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.780> megamix

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
Giga minx is different from the megamix

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.819 
Giga minx is different from the megamix
obviously<00:01:31.829> because<00:01:32.100> megamix<00:01:32.460> has<00:01:32.640> one<00:01:32.880> layer

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:33.829 
obviously because megamix has one layer

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:37.310 
obviously because megamix has one layer
you<00:01:34.829> know<00:01:34.950> and<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.369> giga<00:01:35.579> means<00:01:35.790> has<00:01:36.570> two

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
you know and the giga means has two

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.700 
you know and the giga means has two
layers<00:01:38.689> which<00:01:39.689> changes<00:01:40.140> with<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.350> whole<00:01:40.470> game

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
layers which changes with the whole game

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.719 
layers which changes with the whole game
because<00:01:41.280> it<00:01:41.460> adds<00:01:41.640> two<00:01:42.450> extra<00:01:42.869> edges<00:01:43.020> and<00:01:43.729> a

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
because it adds two extra edges and a

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.819 
because it adds two extra edges and a
bunch<00:01:45.570> more<00:01:45.689> centerpieces<00:01:46.790> now<00:01:48.590> the<00:01:49.590> sticker

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
bunch more centerpieces now the sticker

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.899 
bunch more centerpieces now the sticker
quality<00:01:50.280> on<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.549> megaminx<00:01:51.979> it's<00:01:52.979> not<00:01:53.549> the

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
quality on the megaminx it's not the

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.090 
quality on the megaminx it's not the
best<00:01:54.210> you<00:01:54.570> know<00:01:54.600> it's<00:01:55.290> good<00:01:55.500> i<00:01:55.619> guess<00:01:55.829> for<00:01:55.950> what

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
best you know it's good i guess for what

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.190
