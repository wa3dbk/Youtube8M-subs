00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.550
 obviously we're talking about whatsapp 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:36.960

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.840
 judgment on this service have been 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.780
 then the official prices for 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.940
 samsung galaxy s 6 rs6 italy law 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.570

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.719
 call part from 739 euros then price 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:07.439
 last year's highest is 10 euros 

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:11.100
 the lowest then juan m9 exists 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:13.530

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.170

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:28.170
 128 gigabytes in our country 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.390
 then we move on to something new that could 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.430
 you may have missed a bit in the past 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.079
 too muted but in my opinion 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.939
 absolutely deserves yours 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.840
 attention, let's talk about 360 videos 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.869
 degrees 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.970
 go with the youtube app to see them 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.200
 using the link in the comments here on 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.880
 youtube 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.220
 and then again if you are owners of 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.530
 samsung galaxy s 4 know that it is 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.579
 a rom from the 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.740
 firmware 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:55.380
 indeed the samsung's own firmware 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.700
 galaxy s 4 black edition to install 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.100
 the only difference on your model 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.079
 reality are just different backgrounds 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.549
 so if you want to try lollipop and not 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.680
 you are afraid of flashing a firmware 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.400
 different this is definitely the 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.220
 your moment 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.899
 we continue then passing to news not 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.330
 closely related to the android world but 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.740
 if you are really tired of android 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.000
 I really hope not 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.000
 be advised that probably soon 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.920
 you can go to an apple store and use 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.710
 your android smartphone like 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:25.290
 product to receive a discount on 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:26.880
 your next iphone but I repeat 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.370
 let's hope you don't 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.410
 always with regards to worlds 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.360
 different entering into that of 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.490
 android we talk about the news a little 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.830
 curious it seems that microsoft can 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:39.750
 release sooner or later we do not know in 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.600

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.430

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.350
 also for android certainly a lot 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.880
 curious to try it since on windows 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:50.010

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:54.140
