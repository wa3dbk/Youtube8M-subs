00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.620
 hello very good to all with echo and 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.180
 welcome to the fifth floor of the tutorial 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:10.200
 of jets in which I will teach you tough 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:12.000
 fight advanced and o competitive and good 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.769
 in this episode instead of doing it 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.070
 just a game I just to explain 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:19.590
 the more or less the turns already I what 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.210
 explain in the first episode how 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.800
 it's good but I'm going to make a 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.470
 summary but good in this video I have 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.939
 I got some clips about two fights from a 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.369
 competitive part of a couple of parties 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:32.189
 competitive I did with my clan 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.589
 a couple of weeks ago and nothing better than 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.870
 show you how strong advanced 

00:00:33.589 --> 00:00:39.389
 they showed the videos of two real phases 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:43.589
 competitive so good good there 

00:00:39.389 --> 00:00:45.389
 charge disabled one and well then the 

00:00:43.589 --> 00:00:46.769
 turns as I said already is taught in 

00:00:45.389 --> 00:00:48.359
 the first episode but well we 're going to 

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:51.690
 do what we're going to remember to do 

00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:53.280
 summary when in competitive end of 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.069
 advanced flight most of the time 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.440
 uses vertical loops because it is 

00:00:56.069 --> 00:01:00.899
 the more what more skill requires and 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.449
 it's like more more determining who is 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:06.090
 the best the best pilot and good for 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:09.000
 do the advanced turns 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.369
 Well, I 'm leaving because it's a very bad idea 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.320
 make a fait in front of the enemy base 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.109
 because they can give us the antiaircraft 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.990
 stinger etcetera so I had to 

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:23.340
 regular and good because the turns in 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.600
 vertical are already done when you go up 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.100
 puts the post combustion a couple of 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.319
 seconds as you are seeing now that 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.020
 they are basically a few clicks and then 

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:34.340
 when it is lowered, the brake is pressed 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.990
 Most time to slow down 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.119
 but good simply with that you see the 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.439
 video you pretty much know how it's done 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:41.420
 but good requires a lot of skill 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:44.479
 a long time so do not worry about the 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.250
 principle comes out and well there I 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:48.140
 charge again 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:52.190
 and I think it destroys helicopter I do not know 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:54.530
 Well, well, that's forgiving 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:57.170
 First forgiveness for taking so long 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:02:00.020
 in the tutorial but this week 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.430
 it's parties of me and my city like this 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.900
 that I have to party with the 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:06.350
 friends and such that I could not record 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:09.920
 nor do the tutorial before I feel it like that 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:11.420
 that's good, well, then also 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.430
 I want to comment on a difference that there is 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.930
 between the planes that you are seeing 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:19.209
 Right now I'm on the American plane 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:23.709
 the f-18 and I'm chasing the flanker 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:23.709
 which is the Russian aircraft the sub 35 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.190
 as good as I am about the 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.260
 seremÃ­a disables me with the extinguish 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.879
 so I had to shoot because I did not 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.819
 I want you to tell me the death because 

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:37.909
 he deserves it with the stinger just just me 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:39.980
 I am left to die to die when when I 

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:42.319
 kills the plane itself the enemy doing 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.330
 a 2 faith otherwise not everything else I throw 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:47.420
 because he does not deserve it he has not done 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:48.799
 nothing for death but good 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.650
 I want to comment the difference between 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:53.209
 between the two planes good as you are 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.299
 seeing how I'm appreciating one for the 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:58.190
 video when I'm with the f-18 with the 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:03:00.470
 with the American plane where you are 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.720
 now as I am most 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:05.329
 third person time because I do not 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.470
 I need to control or get in 

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:08.239
 first person to control the 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:10.790
 speed because I know it more or less 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:12.829
 of memory and with the movement of the plane 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:14.330
 it looks pretty good if you know 

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:18.790
 differentiate them 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:18.790
 but good forgiveness then we'll see 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:25.550
 as with the 35 it costs me more and I'm 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:28.099
 almost all the time in the first person 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:30.260
 to control the speed and also 

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:31.760
 as you can see that all the time I'm with 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.640
 fighting against himself the same 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.980
 enemy be the same uncle the avenger is 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.769
 this 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.780
 I fought with him before and good always 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:41.680
 I'm struggling with this are two games 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:42.940
 one after the other 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.040
 but I want you to see the 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:47.920
 difference because with the f-18 I do not 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:50.590
 It costs a lot to load honey 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:53.410
 in a minute like that but now I want that 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:57.580
 You see how I eat with me it costs me with 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:59.890
 f with the Russian plane sorry to load them 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:02.079
 The difference between the 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:04.090
 two planes is one thing that I hate 

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:05.829
 very much and I really hate the Russian plane 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.900
 is that I can not stand it, I do not like them 

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:09.760
 nothing to use it but good I know that 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.370
 use and is already used and 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.709
 do what you can 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:15.510
 good to do a 2 faith too 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:17.459
 You can use the FM as you will see in 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:19.560
 this video sometimes uses the fm 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:22.230
 to confuse 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.700
 and good if the enemy has your tail 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:26.700
 and sees you how I am right now watching 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:28.650
 read the time as you turn all that if 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:30.660
 you use lcm it will not be much use 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:32.550
 because the enemy already knows where you are going 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:34.740
 to go and where are you and all because you 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:36.690
 is watching all the time but if now 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.820
 same for example that I do not see it or anything 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:41.610
 or I see him only when he goes up when they come down 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:43.590
 a few moments is used is the ecm can 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:45.370
 that confuse me to turn this way 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:47.229
 suddenly 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:51.430
 so if you are going to do a 1 on 1 

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:52.780
 I recommend lcm because it makes you confuse 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:55.000
 to the enemy but there is a part 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:56.830
 competitive 12 against 12 or so for the 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.470
 style what I recommend you are the 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:01.900
 flares because the axis but out there 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:03.790
 works very well and fails the several 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:05.770
 times against stingers and so on so the 

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:07.570
 flares can save us and you can 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:10.360
 give a little time if it makes you 

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:13.780
 missing to knock down the meego and 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:15.220
 good at turns mainly as 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:17.380
 I said before the turns are made in 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:20.590
 vertical loops but good sometimes 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:23.880
 you can also use maneuvers that 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:26.919
 they are like this of distraction or evasion 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:28.750
 which are will change the course sharply 

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:32.150
 as you have seen right now we are 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:34.520
 doing loopings followed 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:36.770
 but the course change made a looping 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:38.330
 followed as a kind of 8 and good 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:40.250
 here you see how he killed him when he goes to his 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:42.140
 base because it gives you a couple of shots and I 

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:45.200
 I do not know if it happened that I think it 

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:47.660
 scared or needed help and that's why 

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:49.280
 he had to go to his base but hey no 

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:50.960
 I want to be pessimistic or anything and I do not want 

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:54.350
 give bad news but I just want that 

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:57.290
 you know if you have a plane in enemy 

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:59.060
 which is very very very competitive what 

00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:00.710
 that is if you have it in the back 

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:02.180
 It is very difficult to take it away from you 

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:04.670
 are worth the normal maneuvers of a 

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:06.740
 normal departure is very difficult you have to 

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:08.240
 ask for help I know it seems that way 

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:10.250
 but you have to ask for help and burdensome 

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:12.550
 will go to your base to ask for help with 

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:14.530
 they extinguish if whatever 

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:16.330
 and well, that's what I think it's all about 

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:18.100
 just watch the video learn from 

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:20.230
 video pretty much there's nothing more than 

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:23.230
 comment is simply the one that turn 

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:26.710
 best wins and that's good and these are 

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:29.530
 clips of what are the 61 against ones 

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:31.000
 real because other times they intervene 

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:32.590
 intention stingers intervenes in 

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.060
 third persons 

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:38.100
 so I'll put on screen two 

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:40.660
 annotations with links so that you go to 

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:42.970
 split to two competitive games 

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:45.880
 whole, that is without cutting or anything 

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:47.350
 just whole with my clan of does 

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:48.880
 a long time but good simply if 

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:51.550
 you want to see a competitive part that 

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:53.050
 so you can see them and well if you have 

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:56.140
 Any suggestions for another tutorial or 

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:59.130
 well put me in the comments and 

00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:59.130
 until the next video
