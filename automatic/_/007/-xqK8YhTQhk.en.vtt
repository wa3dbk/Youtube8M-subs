00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:18.190
 well it him everyone is 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.380
 genetics it's I hope you have 

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:24.820
 the shape anyway I'm fine I could 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:27.640
 watch this gamescom conference from 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.109
 electronic art as well as microsoft which 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.180
 will be the subject of many videos 

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:34.750
 very very soon on my channel in 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:38.440
 waiting we'll talk about microsoft 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:39.489
 xbox one and xbox 360 plus 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.250
 precisely we will talk about the 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:43.210
 backward compatibility 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.760
 it was something that had already been 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:48.190
 presented at the e3 2015 and which was 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.230
 confirmed at gamescom 2015 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.520
 and so I will bring you some 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:53.920
 small details 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:56.440
 because it's all beautiful, but clean 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.840
 behind the scenes is completely different 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.430
 case in relation to what we said 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.329
 microsoft it's quite different so I see 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:02.590
 I explained to you a little more 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:04.690
 clearly in this video that is going to be 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:06.369
 very fast so I want to clarify that 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:07.899
 I had to make a son how dry 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:09.160
 to tell you about this information there 

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:11.320
 as well as other information 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.300
 but I'm just going to do it a 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:16.119
 simple how tahri to go over 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:18.820
 quickly when taking care of 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:20.740
 the video already will come out faster and if 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.350
 I prefer to go out here are the most news 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.840
 quickly rather than having 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.010
 visual quality so here 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.049
 excuse me but I think you 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:31.180
 understand my point easily enough 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:33.909
 of view so we learn that the retro 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.979
 xbox 360 and xbox game compatibility 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:38.530
 one will involve a hundred titles 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:40.540
 by the end of the year all the soft of the 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:43.570
 program game with gold coming soon 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:46.270
 concerned will be free so already 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.140
 first hunt to know in relation to 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.119
 game with gold 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.110
 most gold games games in good he 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:53.860
 will have a lot more going out 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:55.780
 for subscribers of the gold subscribers 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.549
 simply to xbox live gold there 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.020
 will have a lot of games is gold that 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:02.200
 will come out compared to those who do not 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:04.360
 are not subscribers and microsoft wants 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.710
 set up the game with program 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.509
 xbox 360 gold 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.340
 backward compatible on the game program 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:10.899
 with xbox one gold I think you 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.160
 have fully understood is that the 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:14.980
 Most of the game is gold games should 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.540
 maybe go out actually multiconsole 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.900
 end especially on the one the 3.6 games 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.370
 on the one so that's something for 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.440
 the moment that in parentheses see my 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.640
 notice I see I 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.470
 see how badly that is because the 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.680
 most games with gold on 360 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.760
 are pretty big good I think for 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.500
 the moment it will not happen but 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.840
 maybe by October-November 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.340
 why not today? 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.050
 official we have a date of 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.450
 availability for the retro 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:41.580
 compatibility between the xbox 360 and the 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.500
 xbox one an update on the one that 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.140
 will read all the xbox games 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.390
 360 in any case normally this 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.590
 backward compatibility will not be very 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.110
 complicated to set up for 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:54.510
 microsoft car microsoft will make believe 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.680
 to your one that it's a xbox 360 thanks 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.720
 at simulations 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.220
 so it's not very complicated what 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:03.060
 will normally play all 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:05.280
 your xbox 360 games on your one and in 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:08.190
 more of that microsoft had announced that 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.750
 the dlc and the online etc all this 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.970
 would work but the real 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.590
 difficulty of microsoft will be 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.750
 convince publishers and 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.370
 developers to do it and to have them 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.600
 authorizations 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:20.790
 because publishers and developers 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:23.100
 give others the permissions 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.050
 of a series of games for a series of 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.220
 accurate platforms 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:28.530
 ellaone at the time of the games releases 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.580
 was not part of it 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.440
 everyone should agree 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.720
 especially as microsoft will need 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.980
 of patience and talent conviction 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.709
 because right now it's the fashion of 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.840
 remakes of games on next gen and suddenly 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:41.970
 what's the point of paying for a remake game 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.370
 to 60 euros if you can see it 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:46.470
 backwards compatible for free thanks to 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.570
 your old 360 cd 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:51.510
 although some will say yes but the 

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:54.060
 remake are in 1080p 60 fps and so on 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:55.980
 but for the lambda players who has the 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.930
 possibility not to buy a remake 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.739
 but to play the same game of his version 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:02.220
 360 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:04.380
 he will choose this alternative rather than 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:06.269
 buy a 60 euros game in store a 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:08.489
 remake of the shot certainly that some 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:10.709
 publishers or developers will be a small 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:11.459
 not suspicious but microsoft announcement from here 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:12.989
 the end of the year 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:14.610
 a hundred or so retro games 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:16.470
 compatible we wish them a blow 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:18.269
 good luck because he says is a shame because 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:20.190
 it would be a shame to be on a 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:23.880
 bad backward compatibility as there is 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:25.440
 had on the xbox 360 have little or little game 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.630
 market a lot did not work very 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.980
 well we will see how much the publishers 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:31.320
 is moving 

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:33.180
 in any case we learn that ubisoft has 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:34.860
 already announced that he would agree that he 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.510
 currently working with microsoft 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.730
 on the spoke 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:39.980
 compatibility for ghost recon and 

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:42.470
 also have criteria for burnout 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:44.540
 paradise and we hope that others and 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:46.070
 most publishers will do it for 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:47.840
 the good and the pleasure of the players 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:49.310
 I hope all this information 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.150
 you have understood them tell me in the 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:51.700
 comments if you have not well 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:54.440
 understood could perhaps 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:56.750
 here you go a little more then 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.920
 I think there is the middle of the text 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:00.680
 you may not have understood this is 

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:02.180
 simply why why 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:03.440
 publishers would be reluctant I will you 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:05.840
 ask this is the perfect example 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:09.080
 for example we have game of war ultimate 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:11.450
 edition will release a remake on the xbox 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.110
 one and backward compatibility down one 

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:14.180
 could very well 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:15.800
 so do not buy this new 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:17.510
 remake version which is a bit more 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.980
 beautiful with more fps is everything 

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:20.660
 simply take his bios and gears 

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:24.020
 of war and then play it on his 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:25.010
 xbox one of in this case there you 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:26.570
 nick publishers and developers 

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:28.070
 since you do not buy the 

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:29.900
 remake and you can still played 

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:31.880
 so you fuck them deep well ben 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:33.320
 that's the thing that makes you reluctant 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:36.410
 for developers and publishers 

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:38.180
 I hope this video will have you 

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:40.010
 I have no other things to say in 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:41.030
 Maybe waiting for a thunderstorm 

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:42.200
 authorize may appear two videos 

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:45.530
 who are going out do not worry 

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:47.300
 on that I will be there to inform you of 

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:48.230
 everything and then there is meanwhile there is 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:49.640
 full of videos that will arrive so 

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:50.780
 look good all the videos I you 

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:51.140
 says shout to the world who except that at the 

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:52.850
 next 

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:54.380
 subscribe secular and commented and to
