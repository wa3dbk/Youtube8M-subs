00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:43.580 
making this video on tuesday and a
couple<00:01:41.729> things<00:01:41.970> that<00:01:42.240> cut<00:01:42.990> my<00:01:43.110> attention<00:01:43.500> was

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
couple things that cut my attention was

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.889 
couple things that cut my attention was
i<00:01:43.799> watched<00:01:44.180> probably<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.270> first<00:01:45.390> hour<00:01:45.630> hour

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
i watched probably the first hour hour

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.810 
i watched probably the first hour hour
and<00:01:45.930> a<00:01:46.020> half<00:01:46.200> of<00:01:46.320> it<00:01:46.500> and<00:01:47.299> the<00:01:49.610> video<00:01:50.610> that<00:01:50.759> i

thought was the most intriguing was

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.109 
thought was the most intriguing was
actually<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:52.950> battlefield<00:01:53.399> video<00:01:53.670> and<00:01:53.939> that

actually the battlefield video and that

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.280 
actually the battlefield video and that
cop<00:01:54.329> that<00:01:54.540> catches<00:01:54.810> me<00:01:54.930> off<00:01:55.020> guard<00:01:55.049> because

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290

00:03:47.929 --> 00:03:47.939 
impressive I know it was trailer but

00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:48.949 
impressive I know it was trailer but
there<00:03:48.030> was<00:03:48.150> some<00:03:48.239> actual<00:03:48.419> game<00:03:48.599> plan<00:03:48.780> it<00:03:48.930> like

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
there was some actual game plan it like

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:50.479

blows the trailers and was it was it

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:51.649 
blows the trailers and was it was it
looked<00:03:50.699> for<00:03:50.819> interesting<00:03:51.150> so<00:03:51.239> I<00:03:51.299> may<00:03:51.449> actually

00:03:51.649 --> 00:03:51.659 
looked for interesting so I may actually

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:53.509 
looked for interesting so I may actually
have<00:03:51.959> to<00:03:52.049> pick<00:03:52.169> up<00:03:52.290> that<00:03:52.319> game<00:03:52.650> when<00:03:53.250> it<00:03:53.340> comes

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519
