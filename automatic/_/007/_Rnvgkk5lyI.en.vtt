think<00:03:06.180> the<00:03:06.390> GlossyBox<00:03:07.080> tends<00:03:07.380> to<00:03:07.560> be<00:03:07.650> a<00:03:07.680> little

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
think the GlossyBox tends to be a little

bit<00:03:08.040> better<00:03:08.370> most<00:03:09.300> of<00:03:09.480> the<00:03:09.569> time<00:03:09.780> that's<00:03:10.530> a<00:03:10.680> bad

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
bit better most of the time that's a bad
