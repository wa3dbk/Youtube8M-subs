Galil the ak-47 the commando basically

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.470 
Galil the ak-47 the commando basically
the<00:03:13.060> slower<00:03:13.569> firing<00:03:14.019> guns<00:03:14.470> that<00:03:15.430> are<00:03:15.489> quite<00:03:16.329> as

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
the slower firing guns that are quite as

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.140 
the slower firing guns that are quite as
good<00:03:16.629> up<00:03:16.780> close<00:03:17.049> with<00:03:17.200> the<00:03:17.319> hipfire<00:03:18.000> and<00:03:19.000> then

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
good up close with the hipfire and then

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.180 
good up close with the hipfire and then
obviously<00:03:19.269> like<00:03:19.750> the<00:03:19.989> first<00:03:20.410> weapons<00:03:20.919> and

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
obviously like the first weapons and

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.120 
obviously like the first weapons and
whatever<00:03:21.459> but<00:03:22.019> uh<00:03:23.019> I'd<00:03:23.500> recommend<00:03:23.769> at<00:03:24.010> least

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
whatever but uh I'd recommend at least

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.550

give<00:03:24.430> it<00:03:24.459> a<00:03:24.519> shot<00:03:24.730> because<00:03:25.000> it's<00:03:25.450> it's<00:03:26.349> right

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
give it a shot because it's it's right

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.349 
give it a shot because it's it's right
on<00:03:26.590> par<00:03:26.919> with<00:03:26.950> like<00:03:27.250> the<00:03:27.400> stakeout<00:03:27.849> how<00:03:28.180> do<00:03:28.239> you
