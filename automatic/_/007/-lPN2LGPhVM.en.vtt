out your problem and today we're going
to<00:00:42.090> talk<00:00:42.270> about<00:00:42.390> a<00:00:42.510> couple<00:00:42.780> of<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:43.230> tricks

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
to talk about a couple of the tricks

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.729 
to talk about a couple of the tricks
that<00:00:44.100> I<00:00:44.160> use<00:00:44.460> to<00:00:45.050> figure<00:00:46.050> out<00:00:46.140> what's<00:00:46.379> going<00:00:46.620> on

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
that I use to figure out what's going on

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.830 
that I use to figure out what's going on
here<00:00:46.800> and<00:00:47.460> how<00:00:48.450> it<00:00:48.600> relates<00:00:48.989> to<00:00:49.079> my<00:00:49.289> bike<00:00:50.840> all

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
here and how it relates to my bike all

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.840 
here and how it relates to my bike all
right<00:00:52.020> so<00:00:52.260> normally<00:00:52.559> I'm<00:00:52.680> a<00:00:52.739> fan<00:00:52.980> of<00:00:53.250> the

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
right so normally I'm a fan of the

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.139 
right so normally I'm a fan of the
actual<00:00:54.300> physical<00:00:55.520> repair<00:00:56.520> manuals<00:00:56.940> that<00:00:57.030> I

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
actual physical repair manuals that I

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.849 
actual physical repair manuals that I
can<00:00:57.360> take<00:00:57.570> out<00:00:57.750> to<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.109> driveway<00:00:58.350> of<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.649> shop

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
can take out to the driveway of the shop

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.910 
can take out to the driveway of the shop
or<00:00:59.070> whatever<00:00:59.190> and<00:01:00.230> access<00:01:01.230> while<00:01:01.469> I'm<00:01:01.590> working

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
or whatever and access while I'm working

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.680 
or whatever and access while I'm working
on<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.100> bike<00:01:02.280> but<00:01:02.699> when<00:01:03.149> it<00:01:03.239> comes<00:01:03.420> to<00:01:03.510> wiring

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
on the bike but when it comes to wiring

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.539 
on the bike but when it comes to wiring
diagrams<00:01:04.229> sometimes<00:01:04.710> it's<00:01:04.860> useful<00:01:05.189> to<00:01:05.220> find

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
diagrams sometimes it's useful to find

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.340 
diagrams sometimes it's useful to find
an<00:01:05.820> electronic<00:01:06.360> version<00:01:06.510> that<00:01:06.900> way<00:01:07.020> you<00:01:07.080> can

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
an electronic version that way you can

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.870 
an electronic version that way you can
blow<00:01:07.560> it<00:01:07.680> up<00:01:07.830> and<00:01:07.950> you<00:01:08.070> can<00:01:08.189> see<00:01:08.430> what<00:01:08.640> all<00:01:08.790> is

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
blow it up and you can see what all is

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.410 
blow it up and you can see what all is
going<00:01:08.909> on<00:01:09.299> this<00:01:10.200> is<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:11.280> wiring<00:01:11.490> diagram<00:01:12.150> to<00:01:12.390> a

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
going on this is the wiring diagram to a

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.050 
going on this is the wiring diagram to a
k<00:01:12.689> z<00:01:12.750> 400<00:01:13.560> I<00:01:13.740> just<00:01:14.100> googled<00:01:14.340> it<00:01:14.580> found<00:01:14.939> it

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
k z 400 I just googled it found it

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.130 
k z 400 I just googled it found it
online<00:01:15.180> was<00:01:15.570> really<00:01:16.100> easy<00:01:17.100> to<00:01:17.460> access<00:01:17.640> and<00:01:18.150> I

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
online was really easy to access and I

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.929 
online was really easy to access and I
can<00:01:19.380> blow<00:01:19.619> it<00:01:19.770> up<00:01:19.890> so<00:01:20.159> that<00:01:20.310> there's<00:01:20.549> actually

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
can blow it up so that there's actually

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.350 
can blow it up so that there's actually
some<00:01:20.970> white<00:01:21.659> in<00:01:21.869> between<00:01:22.020> those<00:01:22.380> black<00:01:22.619> lines

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
some white in between those black lines

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.359 
some white in between those black lines
so<00:01:24.360> if<00:01:24.750> you<00:01:24.840> guys<00:01:24.960> want<00:01:25.200> to<00:01:25.290> blow<00:01:26.100> up<00:01:26.250> your

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
so if you guys want to blow up your

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.130 
so if you guys want to blow up your
screen<00:01:26.700> too<00:01:26.939> while<00:01:27.299> we're<00:01:27.570> working<00:01:27.720> on<00:01:27.960> this

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
screen too while we're working on this

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.100 
screen too while we're working on this
you<00:01:28.350> can<00:01:28.530> see<00:01:28.860> what<00:01:29.340> I'm<00:01:29.460> talking<00:01:29.850> about<00:01:30.110> all

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
you can see what I'm talking about all

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:31.280 
you can see what I'm talking about all
right

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
right

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.460 
right
so<00:01:31.740> suppose<00:01:32.220> we<00:01:32.250> have<00:01:32.430> a<00:01:32.820> problem<00:01:33.329> let's<00:01:34.320> say

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
so suppose we have a problem let's say

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:35.749 
so suppose we have a problem let's say
with<00:01:34.590> this<00:01:34.770> load<00:01:34.979> this<00:01:35.220> is<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.430> rear<00:01:35.579> left

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
with this load this is the rear left

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.429 
with this load this is the rear left
turn<00:01:36.000> signal<00:01:36.360> let's<00:01:36.570> say<00:01:36.689> it's<00:01:36.840> not<00:01:36.900> coming<00:01:37.229> on

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
turn signal let's say it's not coming on

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.999 
turn signal let's say it's not coming on
right<00:01:37.920> what<00:01:38.820> I<00:01:39.060> will<00:01:39.420> usually<00:01:39.780> do<00:01:39.960> is<00:01:40.229> I<00:01:40.799> will

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
right what I will usually do is I will

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.429 
right what I will usually do is I will
go<00:01:41.189> searching<00:01:41.549> for<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.970> voltage<00:01:42.390> if<00:01:42.780> you<00:01:43.350> know

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
go searching for the voltage if you know

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.109 
go searching for the voltage if you know
somebody<00:01:43.860> on<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.040> forum<00:01:44.310> says<00:01:44.520> to<00:01:44.700> you<00:01:44.790> o<00:01:44.820> go

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
somebody on the forum says to you o go

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.460 
somebody on the forum says to you o go
search<00:01:45.329> for<00:01:45.360> your<00:01:45.570> voltage<00:01:45.930> you<00:01:46.170> know<00:01:46.290> and

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
search for your voltage you know and

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:47.210 
search for your voltage you know and
find<00:01:46.649> out<00:01:46.770> where<00:01:46.890> it<00:01:46.950> is

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
find out where it is

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.060 
find out where it is
this<00:01:47.670> is<00:01:47.790> what<00:01:47.909> they<00:01:48.060> mean<00:01:49.110> you<00:01:49.590> take<00:01:49.829> your

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
this is what they mean you take your

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.740 
this is what they mean you take your
home<00:01:50.549> time<00:01:50.729> when<00:01:50.850> ever<00:01:50.939> put<00:01:51.090> on<00:01:51.119> volts<00:01:51.630> you

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
home time when ever put on volts you

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.249 
home time when ever put on volts you
know<00:01:51.869> 12<00:01:52.140> volts<00:01:52.380> or<00:01:52.439> whatever<00:01:52.500> and<00:01:54.020> put<00:01:55.020> the

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
know 12 volts or whatever and put the

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.730 
know 12 volts or whatever and put the
black<00:01:55.740> end<00:01:56.040> in<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:57.000> battery<00:01:57.329> and<00:01:57.540> for<00:01:58.469> the<00:01:58.560> red

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
black end in the battery and for the red

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.469 
black end in the battery and for the red
end<00:01:58.979> you<00:01:59.250> just<00:01:59.310> take<00:01:59.759> it<00:01:59.880> and<00:01:59.969> start<00:02:00.149> probing

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
end you just take it and start probing

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.480 
end you just take it and start probing
around<00:02:00.899> and<00:02:01.110> find<00:02:01.439> where<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.619> volts<00:02:01.979> are<00:02:02.130> so

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
around and find where the volts are so

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.719 
around and find where the volts are so
let's<00:02:02.700> say<00:02:02.909> you<00:02:02.969> know<00:02:03.329> I've<00:02:03.719> confirmed<00:02:04.350> that

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
let's say you know I've confirmed that

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:08.600 
let's say you know I've confirmed that
the<00:02:05.729> the<00:02:06.689> fuse<00:02:07.020> is<00:02:07.380> still<00:02:07.799> good<00:02:08.039> and<00:02:08.340> the

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
the the fuse is still good and the

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.029 
the the fuse is still good and the
battery's<00:02:09.030> good<00:02:09.270> alright<00:02:10.140> so<00:02:10.739> I'm<00:02:10.830> going<00:02:10.950> to

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
battery's good alright so I'm going to

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.230 
battery's good alright so I'm going to
take<00:02:11.280> my<00:02:11.459> red<00:02:11.610> end<00:02:11.879> and<00:02:12.120> I'm<00:02:12.720> going<00:02:12.870> to<00:02:12.930> turn

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
take my red end and I'm going to turn

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.030 
take my red end and I'm going to turn
the<00:02:13.300> bike<00:02:13.450> I'm<00:02:13.720> gonna<00:02:13.990> flip<00:02:14.440> the<00:02:14.590> switch<00:02:14.800> for

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
the bike I'm gonna flip the switch for

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.560 
the bike I'm gonna flip the switch for
the<00:02:15.100> turn<00:02:15.280> signal<00:02:15.670> and<00:02:15.850> I'm<00:02:15.940> gonna<00:02:16.030> touch<00:02:16.390> it

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:16.570 
the turn signal and I'm gonna touch it

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:17.210 
the turn signal and I'm gonna touch it
right<00:02:16.720> here

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
right here

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.720 
right here
okay<00:02:18.220> this<00:02:19.120> is<00:02:19.270> where<00:02:19.450> the<00:02:19.630> S<00:02:19.900> the<00:02:20.830> S<00:02:21.190> marked

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
okay this is where the S the S marked

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.120 
okay this is where the S the S marked
wire<00:02:22.180> comes<00:02:22.510> out<00:02:22.690> what<00:02:22.900> does<00:02:23.020> s<00:02:23.200> mean<00:02:23.470> well

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
wire comes out what does s mean well

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.910 
wire comes out what does s mean well
this<00:02:24.430> means<00:02:24.730> slate<00:02:25.320> so<00:02:26.320> it's<00:02:26.590> gonna<00:02:26.680> be<00:02:26.830> this

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
this means slate so it's gonna be this

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.310 
this means slate so it's gonna be this
gray<00:02:27.220> marked<00:02:27.820> wire<00:02:28.000> and<00:02:28.330> so<00:02:28.570> I'm<00:02:28.930> gonna<00:02:29.050> touch

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:29.320 
gray marked wire and so I'm gonna touch

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:30.930 
gray marked wire and so I'm gonna touch
it<00:02:29.470> right<00:02:29.590> here<00:02:29.830> if<00:02:30.070> I<00:02:30.310> don't<00:02:30.490> find<00:02:30.730> any

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
it right here if I don't find any

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.670 
it right here if I don't find any
voltage<00:02:31.390> if<00:02:31.570> it<00:02:31.690> doesn't<00:02:31.960> read<00:02:32.050> anything<00:02:32.470> well

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
voltage if it doesn't read anything well

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.770 
voltage if it doesn't read anything well
then<00:02:32.830> I<00:02:32.920> know<00:02:32.980> the<00:02:33.250> problem<00:02:33.670> is<00:02:33.850> back<00:02:34.270> further

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
then I know the problem is back further

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.820 
then I know the problem is back further
along<00:02:35.230> the<00:02:36.070> live<00:02:36.570> line<00:02:37.570> this<00:02:38.170> is<00:02:38.410> where<00:02:38.560> it

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
along the live line this is where it

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:40.290 
along the live line this is where it
grounds<00:02:39.220> out<00:02:39.340> right<00:02:39.550> here<00:02:39.700> it<00:02:39.850> grounds<00:02:40.090> out<00:02:40.180> to

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
grounds out right here it grounds out to

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.480 
grounds out right here it grounds out to
the<00:02:40.390> frame<00:02:40.600> and<00:02:41.020> from<00:02:41.320> there<00:02:41.500> it<00:02:41.650> connects<00:02:42.010> to

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:42.490 
the frame and from there it connects to

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:45.660 
the frame and from there it connects to
the<00:02:42.760> ground<00:02:42.970> on<00:02:43.150> the<00:02:43.240> battery<00:02:43.540> but<00:02:44.440> I<00:02:44.920> know

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
the ground on the battery but I know

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:47.400 
the ground on the battery but I know
that<00:02:45.880> it<00:02:46.030> is<00:02:46.270> gonna<00:02:46.450> the<00:02:46.780> problem<00:02:47.110> is<00:02:47.170> gonna<00:02:47.260> be

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
that it is gonna the problem is gonna be

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:48.900 
that it is gonna the problem is gonna be
further<00:02:47.800> on<00:02:47.980> down<00:02:48.010> the<00:02:48.220> line<00:02:48.400> so<00:02:48.640> I<00:02:48.670> just

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
further on down the line so I just

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:50.700 
further on down the line so I just
follow<00:02:49.150> the<00:02:49.270> line<00:02:49.480> and<00:02:49.750> here<00:02:50.230> I<00:02:50.380> have<00:02:50.590> this

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:50.710 
follow the line and here I have this

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:53.460 
follow the line and here I have this
connection<00:02:51.040> and<00:02:51.460> it<00:02:51.730> connects<00:02:52.270> to<00:02:52.540> a<00:02:52.780> green

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
connection and it connects to a green

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.300 
connection and it connects to a green
wire<00:02:54.090> these<00:02:55.090> connections<00:02:55.660> do<00:02:55.810> go<00:02:55.960> bad<00:02:56.170> and<00:02:56.380> so

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
wire these connections do go bad and so

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:58.560 
wire these connections do go bad and so
it<00:02:57.580> is<00:02:57.760> um<00:02:58.030> you<00:02:58.300> know<00:02:58.390> it's<00:02:58.480> definitely

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570 
it is um you know it's definitely

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:00.000 
it is um you know it's definitely
possible<00:02:58.930> if<00:02:59.200> there's<00:02:59.380> some<00:02:59.500> corrosion<00:02:59.920> in

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
possible if there's some corrosion in

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:01.680 
possible if there's some corrosion in
here<00:03:00.280> and<00:03:00.430> so<00:03:00.580> I'll<00:03:00.700> take<00:03:00.940> this<00:03:01.090> apart<00:03:01.510> and

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
here and so I'll take this apart and

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.240 
here and so I'll take this apart and
I'll<00:03:01.870> put<00:03:02.110> the<00:03:02.260> red<00:03:02.440> wire<00:03:02.620> in<00:03:02.800> there<00:03:02.950> and<00:03:03.100> see

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
I'll put the red wire in there and see

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.110 
I'll put the red wire in there and see
if<00:03:03.340> there's<00:03:03.520> any<00:03:04.380> voltage<00:03:05.380> in<00:03:06.160> here<00:03:06.550> now<00:03:07.090> the

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
if there's any voltage in here now the

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.390 
if there's any voltage in here now the
reason<00:03:07.480> I<00:03:07.540> don't<00:03:07.600> use<00:03:07.870> a<00:03:07.900> test<00:03:08.230> light<00:03:08.500> I<00:03:08.770> used

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
reason I don't use a test light I used

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.070 
reason I don't use a test light I used
to<00:03:09.580> but<00:03:10.000> I<00:03:10.210> won't<00:03:10.330> do<00:03:10.450> it<00:03:10.570> anymore<00:03:10.720> is<00:03:11.050> because

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.080 
to but I won't do it anymore is because

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:17.130 
to but I won't do it anymore is because
some<00:03:11.800> of<00:03:12.270> these<00:03:13.270> you<00:03:14.110> know<00:03:14.200> some<00:03:15.840> devices<00:03:16.840> on

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
some of these you know some devices on

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.490 
some of these you know some devices on
your<00:03:17.170> on<00:03:17.800> your<00:03:18.070> motorcycle<00:03:19.050> will<00:03:20.050> be<00:03:20.290> getting

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
your on your motorcycle will be getting

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.280 
your on your motorcycle will be getting
you<00:03:20.800> know<00:03:20.920> nine<00:03:21.400> 10<00:03:21.970> volts<00:03:22.450> or<00:03:22.600> whatever<00:03:22.720> and

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
you know nine 10 volts or whatever and

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:24.600 
you know nine 10 volts or whatever and
they<00:03:23.500> stand<00:03:23.710> they<00:03:23.830> won't<00:03:24.070> be<00:03:24.400> able<00:03:24.490> to

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:24.610 
they stand they won't be able to

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:26.130 
they stand they won't be able to
function<00:03:24.850> because<00:03:25.450> they<00:03:25.630> need<00:03:25.780> a<00:03:25.810> certain

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 
function because they need a certain

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.320 
function because they need a certain
amount<00:03:26.200> of<00:03:26.440> voltage<00:03:26.800> and<00:03:27.100> so<00:03:27.340> a<00:03:27.580> test<00:03:28.090> light

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:28.330 
amount of voltage and so a test light

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:29.940 
amount of voltage and so a test light
will<00:03:28.540> actually<00:03:28.720> read<00:03:29.230> you<00:03:29.470> know<00:03:29.560> the<00:03:29.770> light

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
will actually read you know the light

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.490 
will actually read you know the light
will<00:03:30.130> shine<00:03:30.340> up<00:03:30.550> with<00:03:31.000> just<00:03:31.240> a<00:03:31.330> couple<00:03:31.500> you

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
will shine up with just a couple you

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.560 
will shine up with just a couple you
know<00:03:32.590> with<00:03:33.010> minimal<00:03:33.400> voltage<00:03:33.430> but<00:03:34.180> it<00:03:34.420> might

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:34.570 
know with minimal voltage but it might

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:37.440 
know with minimal voltage but it might
not<00:03:34.600> be<00:03:34.750> enough<00:03:35.050> to<00:03:35.110> activate<00:03:35.650> say<00:03:36.130> I<00:03:36.450> don't

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
not be enough to activate say I don't

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:39.410 
not be enough to activate say I don't
know<00:03:37.630> a<00:03:37.660> starter<00:03:38.020> motor<00:03:38.200> or<00:03:38.320> whatever<00:03:38.560> and<00:03:38.830> so

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
know a starter motor or whatever and so

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:42.810 
know a starter motor or whatever and so
that's<00:03:40.420> why<00:03:40.690> I<00:03:40.830> that's<00:03:41.830> why<00:03:42.070> I<00:03:42.100> use<00:03:42.430> a

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:42.820 
that's why I that's why I use a

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:46.710 
that's why I that's why I use a
multimeter<00:03:43.660> rather<00:03:44.290> than<00:03:44.440> a<00:03:44.470> test<00:03:44.710> light<00:03:45.720> all

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
multimeter rather than a test light all

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.210 
multimeter rather than a test light all
right<00:03:46.900> and<00:03:47.110> so<00:03:47.350> let's<00:03:47.740> say<00:03:47.920> there's<00:03:48.160> no

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
right and so let's say there's no

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.640 
right and so let's say there's no
voltage<00:03:48.550> in<00:03:49.120> here<00:03:49.510> either<00:03:49.720> well<00:03:50.110> basically

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
voltage in here either well basically

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:52.530 
voltage in here either well basically
all<00:03:50.770> I'm<00:03:50.830> gonna<00:03:50.950> do<00:03:51.160> is<00:03:51.340> just<00:03:51.850> follow<00:03:52.090> the<00:03:52.330> line

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
all I'm gonna do is just follow the line

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.270 
all I'm gonna do is just follow the line
back<00:03:52.810> and<00:03:53.110> here<00:03:53.230> we<00:03:53.350> have<00:03:53.500> a<00:03:53.530> connector<00:03:54.100> it's

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
back and here we have a connector it's

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.520 
back and here we have a connector it's
this<00:03:54.430> five<00:03:54.640> way<00:03:54.790> connector<00:03:55.300> and<00:03:55.630> you<00:03:56.410> know

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
this five way connector and you know

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:57.960 
this five way connector and you know
we're<00:03:56.680> a<00:03:56.710> green<00:03:56.980> wire<00:03:57.220> now<00:03:57.460> that's<00:03:57.700> what<00:03:57.850> the

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
we're a green wire now that's what the

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.810 
we're a green wire now that's what the
gray<00:03:58.180> and<00:03:58.600> the<00:03:58.690> G<00:03:59.020> means<00:03:59.260> so<00:04:00.160> it<00:04:00.280> go<00:04:00.400> here<00:04:00.670> and

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:00.820 
gray and the G means so it go here and

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:02.190 
gray and the G means so it go here and
I'll<00:04:00.910> just<00:04:01.060> do<00:04:01.210> the<00:04:01.330> same<00:04:01.510> thing<00:04:01.570> I'll<00:04:01.900> put<00:04:02.080> my

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 
I'll just do the same thing I'll put my

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.660 
I'll just do the same thing I'll put my
red<00:04:02.380> end<00:04:02.560> in<00:04:02.710> here<00:04:02.950> and<00:04:03.070> try<00:04:03.250> and<00:04:03.280> find<00:04:03.550> some

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 
red end in here and try and find some

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:06.120 
red end in here and try and find some
some<00:04:04.600> voltage<00:04:04.990> I<00:04:05.110> should<00:04:05.290> have<00:04:05.470> alternating

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.130 
some voltage I should have alternating

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:07.650 
some voltage I should have alternating
voltage<00:04:06.280> because<00:04:06.850> the<00:04:07.000> blinkers<00:04:07.330> should<00:04:07.510> be

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:07.660 
voltage because the blinkers should be

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:10.440 
voltage because the blinkers should be
blinking<00:04:08.080> but<00:04:09.040> if<00:04:09.490> not<00:04:09.730> I'll<00:04:09.940> just<00:04:09.970> keep<00:04:10.270> going

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:10.450 
blinking but if not I'll just keep going

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:12.930 
blinking but if not I'll just keep going
back<00:04:10.780> and<00:04:11.020> you<00:04:11.110> just<00:04:11.140> keep<00:04:11.440> going<00:04:11.500> back<00:04:11.940> you

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:12.940 
back and you just keep going back you

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.840 
back and you just keep going back you
know<00:04:13.740> find<00:04:14.740> where<00:04:14.920> it<00:04:14.980> connects<00:04:15.310> where<00:04:15.610> these

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:15.850 
know find where it connects where these

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:17.640 
know find where it connects where these
wires<00:04:16.090> crisscross<00:04:16.720> that's<00:04:17.080> not<00:04:17.230> a<00:04:17.260> connection

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
wires crisscross that's not a connection

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:19.650 
wires crisscross that's not a connection
you<00:04:17.920> need<00:04:18.070> sort<00:04:18.340> of<00:04:18.430> a<00:04:18.520> dot<00:04:18.790> or<00:04:19.000> a<00:04:19.060> blob<00:04:19.359> right

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 
you need sort of a dot or a blob right

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:24.890 
you need sort of a dot or a blob right
here<00:04:21.150> and<00:04:22.150> that<00:04:22.419> is<00:04:22.450> just<00:04:22.930> how<00:04:23.830> the

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
here and that is just how the

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.930 
here and that is just how the
the<00:04:25.110> technical<00:04:25.680> artist<00:04:26.040> or<00:04:26.220> whatever<00:04:26.310> on<00:04:26.880> the

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
graphic designer who made this decide to

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:30.830 
graphic designer who made this decide to
represent<00:04:29.759> it<00:04:29.850> these<00:04:30.000> are<00:04:30.150> as<00:04:30.270> if<00:04:30.479> the<00:04:30.630> wires

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
represent it these are as if the wires

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.330 
represent it these are as if the wires
are<00:04:31.139> just<00:04:31.290> sort<00:04:31.440> of<00:04:31.500> lying<00:04:31.710> on<00:04:31.889> top<00:04:31.919> of<00:04:32.130> each

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
are just sort of lying on top of each

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.879 
are just sort of lying on top of each
other<00:04:32.520> but<00:04:32.759> not<00:04:32.970> connected<00:04:33.509> so<00:04:33.690> we<00:04:34.590> just<00:04:34.740> go

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:34.889 
other but not connected so we just go

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:36.770 
other but not connected so we just go
back<00:04:35.070> and<00:04:35.370> back<00:04:35.490> and<00:04:35.520> back<00:04:35.759> and<00:04:36.210> sometimes

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:36.780 
back and back and back and sometimes

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.200 
back and back and back and sometimes
you'll<00:04:37.560> go<00:04:38.250> all<00:04:38.460> the<00:04:38.580> way<00:04:38.610> back<00:04:38.850> and<00:04:39.090> you'll

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.210 
you'll go all the way back and you'll

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:40.820 
you'll go all the way back and you'll
find<00:04:39.419> yourself<00:04:39.750> at<00:04:39.900> a<00:04:39.930> different<00:04:40.380> load<00:04:40.560> like

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:40.830 
find yourself at a different load like

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:44.029 
find yourself at a different load like
here<00:04:41.130> we<00:04:41.250> are<00:04:41.810> at<00:04:42.810> the<00:04:43.050> turn<00:04:43.259> signal<00:04:43.650> indicator

00:04:44.029 --> 00:04:44.039 
here we are at the turn signal indicator

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:45.290 
here we are at the turn signal indicator
all<00:04:44.280> right<00:04:44.370> well<00:04:44.520> that's<00:04:44.580> obviously<00:04:45.060> not

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300 
all right well that's obviously not

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:46.879 
all right well that's obviously not
where<00:04:45.449> the<00:04:45.539> power<00:04:45.720> is<00:04:45.840> originating<00:04:46.410> from<00:04:46.440> so

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:46.889 
where the power is originating from so

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:48.170 
where the power is originating from so
we'll<00:04:47.009> come<00:04:47.220> back<00:04:47.250> here<00:04:47.460> and<00:04:47.910> here's<00:04:48.120> a

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:48.180 
we'll come back here and here's a

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:51.890 
we'll come back here and here's a
connection<00:04:48.780> and<00:04:49.320> it<00:04:49.770> comes<00:04:49.979> down<00:04:50.220> and<00:04:50.900> we're

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
connection and it comes down and we're

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.480 
connection and it comes down and we're
gonna<00:04:52.289> get<00:04:52.530> we're<00:04:52.710> gonna<00:04:52.770> get<00:04:52.979> to<00:04:53.130> the<00:04:53.220> switch

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
gonna get we're gonna get to the switch

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:54.950 
gonna get we're gonna get to the switch
here<00:04:53.820> you<00:04:53.970> know<00:04:54.090> and<00:04:54.330> you<00:04:54.570> just<00:04:54.600> sort<00:04:54.930> of

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 
here you know and you just sort of

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.330 
here you know and you just sort of
follow<00:04:55.169> it<00:04:55.320> back<00:04:55.440> in<00:04:55.680> every<00:04:56.009> one<00:04:56.160> of<00:04:56.190> these

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340 
follow it back in every one of these

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:59.300 
follow it back in every one of these
Junction<00:04:56.820> points<00:04:57.000> is<00:04:57.510> where<00:04:57.780> I<00:04:57.810> will<00:04:58.139> put<00:04:58.350> my

00:04:59.300 --> 00:04:59.310 
Junction points is where I will put my

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:02.210 
Junction points is where I will put my
my<00:05:00.180> multimeter<00:05:00.449> ends<00:05:00.990> seek<00:05:01.410> for<00:05:01.620> voltage<00:05:02.010> and

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:02.220 
my multimeter ends seek for voltage and

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.460 
my multimeter ends seek for voltage and
when<00:05:02.400> I<00:05:02.460> find<00:05:02.880> the<00:05:03.030> voltage<00:05:03.210> when<00:05:04.110> I<00:05:04.169> go<00:05:04.289> all

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:04.470 
when I find the voltage when I go all

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.379 
when I find the voltage when I go all
the<00:05:04.500> way<00:05:04.650> back<00:05:04.860> and<00:05:05.130> find<00:05:05.370> out<00:05:05.550> where<00:05:05.789> it<00:05:05.910> is<00:05:05.970> I

00:05:06.379 --> 00:05:06.389 
the way back and find out where it is I

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:08.510 
the way back and find out where it is I
know<00:05:06.780> okay<00:05:07.350> right<00:05:07.620> there<00:05:07.830> between<00:05:08.220> there<00:05:08.490> and

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:08.520 
know okay right there between there and

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.550 
know okay right there between there and
the<00:05:08.880> last<00:05:09.090> time<00:05:09.330> I<00:05:09.360> didn't<00:05:09.900> find<00:05:10.110> voltage

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:10.560 
the last time I didn't find voltage

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.350 
the last time I didn't find voltage
that's<00:05:10.830> where<00:05:11.010> the<00:05:11.070> problem<00:05:11.400> is<00:05:11.520> burnt

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:12.360 
that's where the problem is burnt

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.990 
that's where the problem is burnt
outlier<00:05:12.810> credit<00:05:13.530> connection<00:05:14.130> um<00:05:14.550> it<00:05:14.760> could<00:05:14.910> be

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:15.000 
outlier credit connection um it could be

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.980 
outlier credit connection um it could be
a<00:05:15.030> relays<00:05:15.449> gone<00:05:15.720> bad<00:05:15.960> whatever<00:05:17.990> sometimes

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:18.990 
a relays gone bad whatever sometimes

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:20.480 
a relays gone bad whatever sometimes
I'll<00:05:19.229> take<00:05:19.530> a<00:05:19.560> highlighter<00:05:19.919> and<00:05:20.400> highlight

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:20.490 
I'll take a highlighter and highlight

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:25.520 
I'll take a highlighter and highlight
the<00:05:21.419> circuits<00:05:21.930> of<00:05:23.060> the<00:05:24.060> device<00:05:24.930> which<00:05:25.320> isn't

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:25.530 
the circuits of the device which isn't

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:28.879 
the circuits of the device which isn't
working<00:05:25.979> properly<00:05:26.220> and<00:05:26.880> that<00:05:27.210> is<00:05:27.419> the<00:05:27.889> that's

00:05:28.879 --> 00:05:28.889 
working properly and that is the that's

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:30.110 
working properly and that is the that's
the<00:05:29.039> first<00:05:29.250> thing<00:05:29.430> I<00:05:29.580> do<00:05:29.639> when<00:05:29.970> I'm

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:30.120 
the first thing I do when I'm

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:32.390 
the first thing I do when I'm
researching<00:05:30.660> how<00:05:31.440> I'm<00:05:31.560> gonna<00:05:31.770> fix<00:05:31.979> this<00:05:32.099> thing

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.400 
researching how I'm gonna fix this thing

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.339 
researching how I'm gonna fix this thing
is<00:05:32.639> I'll<00:05:32.789> just<00:05:33.030> sort<00:05:33.210> of<00:05:33.349> highlight

00:05:34.339 --> 00:05:34.349 
is I'll just sort of highlight

00:05:34.349 --> 00:05:35.750 
is I'll just sort of highlight
everything<00:05:34.560> so<00:05:34.919> I<00:05:34.979> can<00:05:35.160> see<00:05:35.340> it<00:05:35.400> a<00:05:35.430> little<00:05:35.460> bit

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:35.760 
everything so I can see it a little bit

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:37.909 
everything so I can see it a little bit
easier<00:05:36.120> and<00:05:36.810> I<00:05:36.930> know<00:05:36.990> what<00:05:37.289> route<00:05:37.500> it<00:05:37.680> takes

00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:37.919 
easier and I know what route it takes

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:40.969 
easier and I know what route it takes
throughout<00:05:38.280> the<00:05:38.400> bike<00:05:39.710> sometimes<00:05:40.710> the

00:05:40.969 --> 00:05:40.979 
throughout the bike sometimes the

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:43.879 
throughout the bike sometimes the
problem<00:05:41.370> is<00:05:41.460> not<00:05:41.639> necessarily<00:05:42.330> that<00:05:42.930> load

00:05:43.879 --> 00:05:43.889 
problem is not necessarily that load

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:47.060 
problem is not necessarily that load
doesn't<00:05:44.370> work<00:05:44.639> it<00:05:45.300> just<00:05:45.539> is<00:05:46.080> that<00:05:46.440> it<00:05:46.919> keeps

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:47.070 
doesn't work it just is that it keeps

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:49.339 
doesn't work it just is that it keeps
blowing<00:05:47.370> a<00:05:47.580> fuse<00:05:47.820> this<00:05:48.180> is<00:05:48.240> a<00:05:48.389> pretty<00:05:49.110> big

00:05:49.339 --> 00:05:49.349 
blowing a fuse this is a pretty big

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:52.760 
blowing a fuse this is a pretty big
problem<00:05:49.530> and<00:05:50.270> I<00:05:51.270> see<00:05:51.870> it<00:05:51.960> all<00:05:52.080> the<00:05:52.199> time<00:05:52.229> you

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:52.770 
problem and I see it all the time you

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:55.070 
problem and I see it all the time you
know<00:05:52.889> and<00:05:53.280> so<00:05:53.550> one<00:05:54.000> thing<00:05:54.030> to<00:05:54.330> look<00:05:54.449> for<00:05:54.750> in

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:55.080 
know and so one thing to look for in

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:57.680 
know and so one thing to look for in
that<00:05:55.110> instance<00:05:55.770> is<00:05:56.180> when<00:05:57.180> there's<00:05:57.630> a

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:57.690 
that instance is when there's a

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:00.110 
that instance is when there's a
connection<00:05:58.080> or<00:05:58.500> a<00:05:58.530> wire<00:05:58.889> that<00:05:59.310> has<00:05:59.520> lost<00:05:59.849> some

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:00.120 
connection or a wire that has lost some

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:01.790 
connection or a wire that has lost some
of<00:06:00.150> its<00:06:00.300> insulation<00:06:00.930> and<00:06:01.050> is<00:06:01.169> grounding<00:06:01.680> out

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:01.800 
of its insulation and is grounding out

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:04.159 
of its insulation and is grounding out
to<00:06:01.979> the<00:06:02.070> frame<00:06:02.340> so<00:06:02.610> to<00:06:03.150> find<00:06:03.449> that<00:06:03.630> I<00:06:03.900> will

00:06:04.159 --> 00:06:04.169 
to the frame so to find that I will

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:06.920 
to the frame so to find that I will
start<00:06:04.500> at<00:06:04.770> the<00:06:05.430> turn<00:06:05.639> signal<00:06:06.030> again<00:06:06.180> I'll<00:06:06.599> put

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:06.930 
start at the turn signal again I'll put

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:10.939 
start at the turn signal again I'll put
my<00:06:07.610> my<00:06:08.610> the<00:06:09.240> black<00:06:09.449> side<00:06:09.750> of<00:06:09.780> my<00:06:10.110> multimeter<00:06:10.740> to

00:06:10.939 --> 00:06:10.949 
my my the black side of my multimeter to

00:06:10.949 --> 00:06:13.219 
my my the black side of my multimeter to
a<00:06:11.159> ground<00:06:11.580> just<00:06:12.300> like<00:06:12.449> I<00:06:12.539> did<00:06:12.690> before<00:06:12.720> but<00:06:13.020> this

00:06:13.219 --> 00:06:13.229 
a ground just like I did before but this

00:06:13.229 --> 00:06:15.469 
a ground just like I did before but this
time<00:06:13.409> I'm<00:06:13.530> going<00:06:13.680> to<00:06:13.740> set<00:06:13.889> it<00:06:14.010> to<00:06:14.039> ohms<00:06:14.370> and<00:06:15.060> I'm

00:06:15.469 --> 00:06:15.479 
time I'm going to set it to ohms and I'm

00:06:15.479 --> 00:06:18.140 
time I'm going to set it to ohms and I'm
gonna<00:06:15.599> take<00:06:15.930> my<00:06:15.960> red<00:06:16.440> lead<00:06:17.370> and<00:06:17.729> I'm<00:06:17.909> gonna

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:18.150 
gonna take my red lead and I'm gonna

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:21.379 
gonna take my red lead and I'm gonna
just<00:06:18.539> basically<00:06:19.110> trace<00:06:19.500> back<00:06:19.830> again<00:06:20.280> and<00:06:20.490> try

00:06:21.379 --> 00:06:21.389 
just basically trace back again and try

00:06:21.389 --> 00:06:24.800 
just basically trace back again and try
and<00:06:21.570> find<00:06:22.400> where<00:06:23.400> it<00:06:23.610> is<00:06:23.789> uh<00:06:23.820> where<00:06:24.659> its

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:24.810 
and find where it is uh where its

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:27.529 
and find where it is uh where its
grounding<00:06:25.289> out<00:06:25.380> to<00:06:25.409> the<00:06:25.620> frame<00:06:25.830> if<00:06:26.669> I<00:06:26.909> can<00:06:27.210> put

00:06:27.529 --> 00:06:27.539 
grounding out to the frame if I can put

00:06:27.539 --> 00:06:29.750 
grounding out to the frame if I can put
let's<00:06:28.260> say<00:06:28.349> I<00:06:28.470> you<00:06:28.770> know<00:06:29.070> have<00:06:29.250> my<00:06:29.400> black<00:06:29.580> and

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:29.760 
let's say I you know have my black and

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:31.939 
let's say I you know have my black and
grounded<00:06:30.180> and<00:06:30.330> put<00:06:30.570> my<00:06:30.690> red<00:06:30.870> in<00:06:31.020> here<00:06:31.409> and<00:06:31.590> I

00:06:31.939 --> 00:06:31.949 
grounded and put my red in here and I

00:06:31.949 --> 00:06:33.649 
grounded and put my red in here and I
find<00:06:32.280> that<00:06:32.400> there's<00:06:32.610> continuity<00:06:32.969> that<00:06:33.599> means

00:06:33.649 --> 00:06:33.659 
find that there's continuity that means

00:06:33.659 --> 00:06:35.600 
find that there's continuity that means
that

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:35.610 
that

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:38.089 
that
that<00:06:36.150> means<00:06:36.300> that<00:06:36.479> current<00:06:36.840> is<00:06:36.990> running<00:06:37.379> along

00:06:38.089 --> 00:06:38.099 
that means that current is running along

00:06:38.099 --> 00:06:41.240 
that means that current is running along
these<00:06:38.310> wires<00:06:38.719> and<00:06:39.719> all<00:06:39.960> the<00:06:40.259> way<00:06:40.349> to<00:06:40.409> let's<00:06:41.069> say

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:41.250 
these wires and all the way to let's say

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:43.610 
these wires and all the way to let's say
the<00:06:41.400> problem<00:06:41.699> is<00:06:41.789> like<00:06:41.909> right<00:06:42.180> here<00:06:42.469> let's<00:06:43.469> say

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:43.620 
the problem is like right here let's say

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:45.499 
the problem is like right here let's say
a<00:06:43.830> rat<00:06:44.099> was<00:06:44.250> chewing<00:06:44.550> on<00:06:44.669> it<00:06:44.819> or<00:06:44.909> whatever<00:06:45.060> and

00:06:45.499 --> 00:06:45.509 
a rat was chewing on it or whatever and

00:06:45.509 --> 00:06:47.420 
a rat was chewing on it or whatever and
it's<00:06:45.810> ground<00:06:46.050> out<00:06:46.169> to<00:06:46.199> the<00:06:46.319> frame<00:06:46.590> it<00:06:47.189> will<00:06:47.310> go

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:47.430 
it's ground out to the frame it will go

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:50.260 
it's ground out to the frame it will go
into<00:06:47.729> the<00:06:48.090> frame<00:06:48.389> and<00:06:48.689> then<00:06:49.289> back<00:06:49.560> down<00:06:49.590> to<00:06:49.889> the

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:50.270 
into the frame and then back down to the

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:52.339 
into the frame and then back down to the
ground<00:06:51.270> side<00:06:51.599> of<00:06:51.629> the<00:06:51.810> battery<00:06:52.139> which<00:06:52.319> is

00:06:52.339 --> 00:06:52.349 
ground side of the battery which is

00:06:52.349 --> 00:06:54.290 
ground side of the battery which is
right<00:06:52.650> here<00:06:52.860> and<00:06:53.039> so<00:06:53.669> there's<00:06:54.030> going<00:06:54.180> to<00:06:54.240> be

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:54.300 
right here and so there's going to be

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:57.140 
right here and so there's going to be
sort<00:06:54.599> of<00:06:54.629> like<00:06:54.810> this<00:06:55.020> mini<00:06:55.379> circuit<00:06:56.039> and<00:06:56.250> you

00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:57.150 
sort of like this mini circuit and you

00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:59.209 
sort of like this mini circuit and you
know<00:06:57.780> the<00:06:57.960> electricity<00:06:58.469> takes<00:06:58.650> the<00:06:58.770> path<00:06:58.949> of

00:06:59.209 --> 00:06:59.219 
know the electricity takes the path of

00:06:59.219 --> 00:07:02.570 
know the electricity takes the path of
least<00:06:59.370> resistance<00:06:59.520> and<00:07:00.210> so<00:07:00.569> it's<00:07:01.159> that's<00:07:02.159> you

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:02.580 
least resistance and so it's that's you

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:05.149 
least resistance and so it's that's you
know<00:07:02.669> where<00:07:02.969> the<00:07:03.120> the<00:07:03.719> break<00:07:04.620> is<00:07:04.800> going<00:07:04.949> to<00:07:05.009> be

00:07:05.149 --> 00:07:05.159 
know where the the break is going to be

00:07:05.159 --> 00:07:08.540 
know where the the break is going to be
and<00:07:05.490> so<00:07:06.409> that's<00:07:07.409> just<00:07:07.560> another<00:07:07.710> setting<00:07:08.310> on

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:08.550 
and so that's just another setting on

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:10.249 
and so that's just another setting on
your<00:07:08.580> multimeter<00:07:09.150> that<00:07:09.449> you<00:07:09.539> can<00:07:09.689> use<00:07:09.840> to<00:07:10.050> find

00:07:10.249 --> 00:07:10.259 
your multimeter that you can use to find

00:07:10.259 --> 00:07:13.909 
your multimeter that you can use to find
a<00:07:10.439> different<00:07:10.919> type<00:07:11.340> of<00:07:11.370> problem
