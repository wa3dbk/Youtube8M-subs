00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:06.970
 we come back with more 

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:10.599
 abc rural 

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:12.610
 today in modern agriculture and 

00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:15.369
 in all agricultural development the 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:18.939
 technology is advancing in any 

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:21.519
 farm there is a tractor but the tractor 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:23.439
 must know how to care and maintenance by 

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:24.880
 we turn to someone who knows a lot 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:27.880
 of the subject that is the technician Roberto 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:30.550
 Acosta who will explain to us what they are 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:34.440
 the elements that have to be verified for 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:37.129
 keep a tractor always impeccable 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.129
 Y 

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:42.559
 no no 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:47.809
 the facilities of the tractor workshop 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:50.510
 Answer: we are having a tractor at 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:52.820
 we want to make service 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.730
 maintenance this tractorcito is a 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:58.280
 agricultural tractor equipped with everything 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:00.949
 than a tractor of greater size or power 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:03.530
 may have as being for example all the 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:06.380
 system of lifting and drago of three 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:09.500
 shaft points or PTO output 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:11.570
 to use all kinds of implements 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.720
 how to be a rotary a cutter 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:16.880
 rotary a drag now a drag 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.550
 level now equipment powered by the 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.110
 power take such as being for example 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:23.659
 forage choppers could be made 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:26.179
 water pumps generators even 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:29.270
 we have the advantage with this tractor that 

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:31.340
 has just in the rotation of the 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.350
 PTO in three speeds that 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:37.170
 not all tractors bring it too 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:41.650
 here with the waiter who is 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:43.240
 moving from starting service to the engine 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:46.150
 what is the fundamental 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:49.240
 this little motor of 25 hp and 3 cylinders is 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:50.530
 an engine that is done, let's say 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.570
 the maintenance service as a 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:56.880
 any other engine the control that is 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:56.880
 performed is through an odometer 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.890
 let say 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.090
 is working in relation to the 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.299
 engine rotation 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:09.450
 this gold meter is the one that will give the 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:12.810
 hours or indicate the hours in which 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:15.300
 all services must be done in 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.760
 this motor case is usually 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:21.330
 performs every 150 hours in relation to 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:23.880
 engine maintenance we have 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:28.200
 a little engine that we do 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:32.660
 every 150 hours the oil change 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.660
 true that it is an oil that generally 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.730
 the client 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:44.330
 is the one that decides the brand or type 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:48.170
 to use in this case they are taking out the 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:52.230
 oil filter that should also be 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:54.150
 changed with the oil at least what 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.200
 we recommend but many times 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:59.290
 people 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.489
 takes into account that the fundamental 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.780
 is the main thing that are 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:03.780
 Factory recommendations 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:09.959
 this is an oil filter that is very 

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:13.440
 easy but very easy to change it can 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:15.090
 do it any little operator 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.819
 machine knowledge could 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:20.480
 do it with a single indication of 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:23.000
 technical in 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:26.090
 take me out and put it is easy to say now 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:30.120
 with the lubricant happens the same is 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:33.810
 question is very, very easy 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:37.370
 change the filter every 150 hours on 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:40.950
 oil filter as much as oil 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:45.540
 Recommended is changed every 150 hours 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:48.150
 every 150 hours logically from work 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:52.290
 this is the oil filter the filter 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:53.940
 air that is fundamental fundamental is 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:59.280
 changes 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:04:02.670
 generally generally every 500 to 750 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:05.250
 hours depends on the capacity of 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:07.440
 filtering that has that too 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:10.230
 we would have to take into account the 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:13.829
 technical recommendations or the wing of 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:17.940
 factory but change them every so many each 

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:20.729
 500 to 750 and clean them when 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:24.600
 necessary that the fundamental thing because this 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:27.060
 is let's say practically the soul of 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:30.090
 engine cleaning the air filter that 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:32.910
 it's really fundamental for him 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:35.520
 in the life of the machine or the 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:37.500
 engine in this case you have to clean it 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:40.290
 when it really is necessary 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:42.240
 would be in charge of the operator true he 

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:45.060
 would see the kind of work that is 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:47.460
 performing and cleaning each 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:50.040
 this when it is necessary for us 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:53.729
 We recommend that cleanings be done 

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:57.180
 if possible with compressed air 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:05:00.660
 the system that is generally employed and 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:04.410
 the correct way is to clean those of 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:07.110
 indicate in eating inside 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:09.180
 inside for outside and inside for 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:13.770
 out because logically 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:15.720
 to aspire everything what it aspires or 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:17.850
 everything that filters is on the part of 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:19.860
 outside as they entered outside 

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:22.260
 They would have to leave in for 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:25.020
 outside that is the correct way to 

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:27.090
 clean a filter without hitting it because 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:29.460
 there is a problem with which we are 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:33.030
 stumbling lately it's just 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:36.620
 the lack of this from a compressor cited and 

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:38.810
 that in the end I think the ideal would be 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:40.610
 get a compressor quoted that it's going to 

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:43.220
 get out but much more economical than 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:46.300
 repair the engine that compressor tomorrow 

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:49.520
 cited is of fundamental importance 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:53.000
 because usually the serious problem 

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:55.419
 comes this when the operators or the 

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.160
 people telling us with that compressor 

00:05:55.419 --> 00:06:00.310
 take the filters take out the belts and 

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:02.900
 they start to hit him by the covers 

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:06.020
 when hit by the covers go 

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:09.740
 destroying all the filtering part the 

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:11.870
 let's say the filter paper out there not 

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:15.440
 they realize that it was a small one 

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:17.810
 small drilling and that's already a 

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:20.630
 very, very serious problem for a 

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:25.280
 little motor I would like to emphasize to you that in 

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:29.300
 the engine oil change that this 

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:31.400
 we also do it every 150 hours with 

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:33.830
 the filter 

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:38.510
 we should keep in mind but very 

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:42.590
 Consider what is recommended by the factory 

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:44.860
 and also change the filter is better 

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:48.230
 said the oil in due time 

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:51.200
 because there are usually people who 

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:54.470
 they change only the filter they continue with 

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:58.020
 the oil this old let's say and the oil 

00:06:54.470 --> 00:07:00.780
 have certain hours of useful life 

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:02.819
 Which is why you have to change them to 

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:05.910
 us in this case like in this 

00:07:02.819 --> 00:07:09.560
 motorcito we use the oil 40 that is 

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:09.560
 the one that recommends
