00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.960
 before showing you the recipe 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.790

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.160

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.190

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:57.500
 much more economical and we all want 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:01:00.469
 look for something inexpensive nobody is quality 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:03.020
 with your money then I recommend you 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:05.270
 go to the markets on wheels that 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.820
 are near your city area what 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:09.470
 you can search in google or ask and 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:12.530
 surely there are several if not even 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:15.350
 you have idea then see these markets 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:18.530
 on wheels and questions you can 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:21.290
 in this season and they will tell you and you 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.659
 it's going to come out a lot more economical and 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.970
 good one of the fruits that this time is 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:27.890
 for her is my favorite I love the 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.290
 just tried a little bit ago are the 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:33.080
 lousy or some know them as the 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:36.080
 persimmons and there are two types of next is 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:38.710
 sphere but it seems more like an oval 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:42.710
 well as nice normal egg is called 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:45.170
 Garcia and this one is more chatita and 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.690
 it seems more set since it's called yours 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.880
 ok the tsÃ¡chilas 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:52.819
 you have to eat it when it's so 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:56.030
 it's super the soft little one that about to 

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:58.759
 bust and buttocks then eat like 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:01.130
 apples like that when they're diced and 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:04.220
 they are super sweet they are super rich and 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:06.890
 sure they are in your area and nothing else 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.989
 they ask for another fruit that is 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.630
 in high season but also me 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:14.530
 They bring our salad and pear for 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:17.170
 there are many types of waiting 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.840
 and it's super sweet and it's very good for 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:22.540
 digestion and against better this season 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.160
 it's also the pomegranate fruit you're going to 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.840
 see a lot richer because when you're 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.510
 buying fruit that is seasonal 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:31.390
 It is usually fruit that is believed to be 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:33.370
 is grown locally then when 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.520
 when the fruit and the 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:38.170
 vegetable but you lose a lot 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:40.569
 nutrients and it loses flavor 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:43.480
 Then another reason why buy 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:45.200
 fruit that this season although ready 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.440
 to present it 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:52.600
 I'm very excited ok you will not need 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:55.310
 increase but great nothing 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:59.210
 date 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:04.130
 for a cinnamon and 

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:06.860
 cahill or lousy and finally optional 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:10.010
 for Mexicans and those who like it 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:12.260
 the chile is closing to me the personal thing 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.630
 like it without the serrano but also 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:17.660
 costs depends on what it is 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:19.610
 both opposite but you know that the 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.800
 Mexicans always the noun for 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:25.340
 make the salad and it's very easy 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:27.650
 you only have to dedicate the pear to 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.440
 get them out of our minds a grenade and 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:33.590
 let's make our super dressing that 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:37.360
 is the special part uncontrolled ok 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:40.520
 for the dressing we are going to use persimmons and 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:42.950
 you want to use preferably you brought us 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:46.520
 is in mass more water bills because they are going to 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:49.010
 be more more sweeter and then you will create 

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:52.580
 a thicker consistency of leaders 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:55.760
 ok then remove the gramita and steven 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:57.930
 signal you see this says it looks like this 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:01.650
 as a jam 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:05.219
 super super sweet then just 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:08.159
 taking away Dr. Keith and so what 

00:04:05.219 --> 00:04:11.400
 Let's do with several following you 

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:14.609
 let's put two reptiles to our 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:18.470
 right to make them sweeter and you 

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:18.470
 you take a delight inside 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:25.590
 and finally for the dressing we are going to 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:27.930
 use cinnamon and they know that cinnamon is very 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:30.980
 good for this season because 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:30.980
 the cinnamon was cold 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:34.040
 apart 

00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:47.879
 repeating studying that and you have 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:50.969
 salad and remember that after the 

00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:53.999
 Fat is very high in antioxidants 

00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:56.489
 so this is very good because it's going 

00:04:53.999 --> 00:05:00.049
 to prevent from diseases especially 

00:04:56.489 --> 00:05:00.049
 in this time it's cold 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:17.039
 and good since they have to know that what 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:22.420
 can salad and let the colors 

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:25.260
 they are divine the prayer is ready 

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:27.770
 you will see 

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.770
 this 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:33.310
