magnificent actually the work the way it

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.200 
magnificent actually the work the way it
just<00:03:03.420> kind<00:03:03.840> of<00:03:03.900> picks<00:03:04.200> itself<00:03:04.620> up<00:03:04.890> and<00:03:05.210> surges

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:06.210 
just kind of picks itself up and surges

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:08.000 
just kind of picks itself up and surges
towards<00:03:06.660> the<00:03:06.750> horizons<00:03:07.320> absolutely

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
towards the horizons absolutely

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:12.650 
towards the horizons absolutely
outrageous<00:03:10.760> and<00:03:11.760> one<00:03:11.970> thing<00:03:12.180> you<00:03:12.300> definitely

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
outrageous and one thing you definitely

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.900 
outrageous and one thing you definitely
notice<00:03:13.320> about<00:03:13.770> the<00:03:13.920> speed<00:03:14.160> is<00:03:14.400> that<00:03:14.550> it<00:03:14.640> does

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
notice about the speed is that it does

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.450 
notice about the speed is that it does
definitely<00:03:15.780> go<00:03:15.930> around<00:03:16.200> corners<00:03:16.590> sweeter

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:17.460 
definitely go around corners sweeter

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:20.480 
definitely go around corners sweeter
than<00:03:17.850> the<00:03:18.030> regular<00:03:18.660> mail<00:03:18.840> so<00:03:19.080> it's<00:03:20.010> it's<00:03:20.400> just

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:20.490 
than the regular mail so it's it's just

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:22.880 
than the regular mail so it's it's just
got<00:03:20.880> this<00:03:21.030> sort<00:03:21.330> of<00:03:21.390> edge<00:03:21.570> of<00:03:21.960> precision<00:03:22.560> to<00:03:22.710> it

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
got this sort of edge of precision to it

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.370 
got this sort of edge of precision to it
but<00:03:23.820> does<00:03:24.000> make<00:03:24.210> you<00:03:24.420> want<00:03:24.600> to<00:03:24.660> get<00:03:25.110> in<00:03:25.230> this

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
but does make you want to get in this

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:26.600 
but does make you want to get in this
seat<00:03:25.620> and<00:03:25.650> drive<00:03:25.920> it<00:03:26.100> rather<00:03:26.250> than<00:03:26.400> be

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
seat and drive it rather than be

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:30.849 
seat and drive it rather than be
chauffeured

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:30.859 

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:34.339 

the<00:03:31.859> gearbox<00:03:32.219> is<00:03:32.370> the<00:03:32.489> same<00:03:32.760> 8-speed<00:03:33.450> ZF<00:03:33.659> that

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:34.349 
the gearbox is the same 8-speed ZF that

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:36.199 
the gearbox is the same 8-speed ZF that
you<00:03:34.439> get<00:03:34.590> in<00:03:34.709> the<00:03:34.769> regular<00:03:35.099> mul<00:03:35.249> song<00:03:35.519> but

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
you get in the regular mul song but

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:37.280 
you get in the regular mul song but
again<00:03:36.389> they've<00:03:36.540> tweaked<00:03:36.749> the<00:03:36.810> software<00:03:37.260> just

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
again they've tweaked the software just

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.349 
again they've tweaked the software just
to<00:03:37.530> make<00:03:37.709> the<00:03:37.829> changes<00:03:38.280> bat<00:03:38.819> much<00:03:38.999> sharper

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:39.359 
to make the changes bat much sharper

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:41.629 
to make the changes bat much sharper
when<00:03:39.629> you<00:03:39.749> put<00:03:39.870> it<00:03:39.959> into<00:03:40.170> sport<00:03:40.499> and<00:03:41.069> it<00:03:41.159> works

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:41.639 
when you put it into sport and it works

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:43.190 
when you put it into sport and it works
really<00:03:41.909> well<00:03:42.060> I<00:03:42.180> mean<00:03:42.359> this<00:03:42.510> gearbox<00:03:42.900> is<00:03:43.049> in

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
really well I mean this gearbox is in

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.739 
really well I mean this gearbox is in
all<00:03:43.409> sorts<00:03:44.189> of<00:03:44.249> cars<00:03:44.519> from<00:03:44.700> BMWs<00:03:45.329> to<00:03:45.420> jag<00:03:45.629> you

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:45.749 
all sorts of cars from BMWs to jag you

00:03:45.749 --> 00:03:48.259 
all sorts of cars from BMWs to jag you
as<00:03:45.870> to<00:03:46.049> Range<00:03:46.709> Rovers<00:03:47.069> in<00:03:47.099> it<00:03:47.310> you<00:03:47.700> know<00:03:47.819> it's<00:03:48.090> a

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:48.269 
as to Range Rovers in it you know it's a

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:50.629 
as to Range Rovers in it you know it's a
really<00:03:48.629> good<00:03:48.780> gearbox<00:03:49.230> it<00:03:49.439> works<00:03:49.650> really<00:03:50.129> well

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:50.639 
really good gearbox it works really well

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:52.849 
really good gearbox it works really well

flappy paddles in a Bentley do seem a

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:55.729 
flappy paddles in a Bentley do seem a
little<00:03:53.129> bit<00:03:53.609> weird<00:03:53.849> but<00:03:54.209> I<00:03:54.480> know<00:03:55.260> it's<00:03:55.560> the

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
little bit weird but I know it's the

00:03:55.739 --> 00:04:01.210 
little bit weird but I know it's the
sporty<00:03:56.099> version<00:03:56.489> so<00:03:56.730> why<00:03:57.450> not

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:04.040

breaking in a 2.6 ton car is always

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:05.900 
breaking in a 2.6 ton car is always
going<00:04:04.290> to<00:04:04.350> be<00:04:04.410> shall<00:04:05.160> we<00:04:05.190> say<00:04:05.280> quite

going to be shall we say quite

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:08.330 
going to be shall we say quite
interesting<00:04:06.540> and<00:04:06.720> Bentley<00:04:07.560> hasn't<00:04:07.980> felt<00:04:08.190> the

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
interesting and Bentley hasn't felt the

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.000 
interesting and Bentley hasn't felt the
need<00:04:08.550> to<00:04:08.880> fit<00:04:09.120> the<00:04:09.150> carbon<00:04:09.990> ceramic<00:04:10.170> discs<00:04:10.800> as

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
need to fit the carbon ceramic discs as

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.880 
need to fit the carbon ceramic discs as
standard<00:04:11.640> to<00:04:11.760> the<00:04:11.790> speed<00:04:12.320> and<00:04:13.320> I<00:04:13.380> think<00:04:13.650> I

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:13.890 
standard to the speed and I think I

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:15.410 
standard to the speed and I think I
don't<00:04:14.220> know<00:04:14.430> I<00:04:14.460> think<00:04:14.580> that's<00:04:14.700> a<00:04:14.820> bit<00:04:15.000> mean<00:04:15.240> at

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 
don't know I think that's a bit mean at

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.660 
don't know I think that's a bit mean at
252<00:04:16.260> grand<00:04:16.709> I<00:04:16.860> think<00:04:16.890> I'd<00:04:17.130> rather<00:04:17.340> have<00:04:17.550> the

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:17.670 
252 grand I think I'd rather have the

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:19.729 
252 grand I think I'd rather have the
big<00:04:17.880> rotors<00:04:18.300> that<00:04:18.510> are<00:04:18.959> made<00:04:19.110> from<00:04:19.260> Carly

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
big rotors that are made from Carly

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:21.650 
big rotors that are made from Carly

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:49.750 
city and inevitably it caused a stir

city and inevitably it caused a stir
pretty<00:05:50.319> much<00:05:50.650> everywhere<00:05:51.430> it<00:05:51.639> went<00:05:51.960> never

more so than when we stopped for a

00:06:07.629 --> 00:06:07.639 
so is the Mulsanne speed the drivers

00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:09.999
