this morning and first thing you notice
is<00:02:40.650> just<00:02:40.980> it's<00:02:41.130> flex<00:02:41.430> it's<00:02:42.030> got<00:02:42.210> a<00:02:42.240> great<00:02:42.420> kind

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
is just it's flex it's got a great kind

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.630 
is just it's flex it's got a great kind
of<00:02:42.840> like<00:02:43.170> flex<00:02:43.500> point<00:02:43.800> to<00:02:43.980> it<00:02:44.100> so<00:02:44.280> it's<00:02:44.430> really

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
of like flex point to it so it's really

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.730 
of like flex point to it so it's really
soft<00:02:44.970> to<00:02:45.150> a<00:02:45.210> certain<00:02:45.510> point<00:02:45.690> and<00:02:45.960> then<00:02:46.380> kind<00:02:46.620> of

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:46.740 
soft to a certain point and then kind of

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.320 
soft to a certain point and then kind of
starts<00:02:47.040> to<00:02:47.160> stiffen<00:02:47.490> up<00:02:47.610> so<00:02:47.790> it<00:02:47.880> does<00:02:48.090> really

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
starts to stiffen up so it does really

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.570 
starts to stiffen up so it does really
hold<00:02:48.570> you<00:02:48.720> in<00:02:48.810> those<00:02:48.930> presses<00:02:49.410> then<00:02:50.190> taking
