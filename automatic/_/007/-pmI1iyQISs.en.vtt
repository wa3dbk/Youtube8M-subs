 Hi, I'm Eugenie. 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:16.960
 Today I am going to make chocolate chip cakes, 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:22.960
 Which is one of the most popular recipes at eugeniekitchen.com these days. 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:26.790
 For this recipe, you will need to: 

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:29.120
 2 cups all-purpose flour (250g) 

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.250
 1/2 cup soft sugar (112g of) 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:32.540
 1 egg, medium-sized 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.460
 1/2 teaspoon salt 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.790
 3 teaspoons baking powder 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:39.290
 2/5 cup (which is 1/3 cup + 1 tablespoon) Vegetable oil (95ml) 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:41.590
 4/5 cup (which is 2/3 cup + 2 tablespoons) Full-fat milk (190ml) 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:44.420
 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.750
 2/3 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips (60g) 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:53.380
 Sugar light brown, to remove dust 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:59.380
 First, pan-line cakes with hardcore. 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:07.210
 In a large mixing bowl, sift the flour 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.380
 And bread powder 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.410
 And whisk in combination. Put aside. 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:24.410
 In the medium mixing bowl, break the egg. 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.190
 Add sugar, 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:29.500
 the salt, 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.420
 And vanilla extract 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:38.420
 And beaten up white. 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:41.870
 Now add in vegetable oil, 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:47.300
 Today I used Petro Coricelli grape seed oil, 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:53.300
 And milk. 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:01.690
 And whisk up combined. 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:04.920
 Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients. 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.040
 Add the milk mixture 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:15.040
 And gently moves until just combined. 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:22.880
 Finally add in chocolate chips and stir to combine. 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:33.760
 Then distributed among cakes. Fill only 2/3 of each mold. 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:54.500
 Bake at 400 Â° F (200C) for 20 to 25 minutes, 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.000
 Or even blow and golden brown. 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.540
 Allow to cool on a wire rack for 5 minutes. 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.250
 Voila, 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.290
 Chocolate chip cakes. 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:12.700
 Sprinkle and serve light brown sugar. 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:18.700
 Bon appetite! 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.290
 Oh, I'm done. 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:37.290
 This was the last video of this week, getting my weekly schedule at FB and Einstagram. 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:40.250
 Eugenie was a kitchen. 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:46.250
 Good-bye. thanks for watching.
