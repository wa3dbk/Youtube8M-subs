00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 
the logo tag name but I was also very

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.550 
the logo tag name but I was also very

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
concerned with capturing the context of

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.830 
concerned with capturing the context of
this<00:01:23.560> form<00:01:24.100> of<00:01:24.570> street<00:01:25.570> art<00:01:25.869> I<00:01:26.860> saw<00:01:27.340> as<00:01:27.610> a

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
this form of street art I saw as a

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.600 
this form of street art I saw as a
photojournalist<00:01:28.840> so<00:01:29.229> I<00:01:29.590> I<00:01:29.619> think<00:01:29.860> the<00:01:30.310> book

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610 
photojournalist so I I think the book

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:35.190 
photojournalist so I I think the book
becomes<00:01:31.240> a<00:01:31.509> kind<00:01:31.840> of<00:01:31.990> retro<00:01:32.820> nostalgic<00:01:34.200> look

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
becomes a kind of retro nostalgic look
