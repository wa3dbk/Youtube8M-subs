this one relates to the splash tile that
we're<00:00:11.849> so<00:00:12.030> used<00:00:12.090> to<00:00:12.360> seeing<00:00:12.599> with<00:00:12.840> Windows<00:00:13.230> 8

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
we're so used to seeing with Windows 8

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.620 
we're so used to seeing with Windows 8
now<00:00:14.250> Windows<00:00:14.639> 10<00:00:14.820> has<00:00:14.969> only<00:00:15.150> been<00:00:15.360> available

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
now Windows 10 has only been available

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.050 
now Windows 10 has only been available
for<00:00:15.839> a<00:00:15.990> couple<00:00:16.020> days<00:00:16.550> so<00:00:17.550> I'm<00:00:17.670> making<00:00:17.940> this

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
for a couple days so I'm making this

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.510 
for a couple days so I'm making this
video<00:00:18.300> just<00:00:18.510> to<00:00:18.960> provide<00:00:19.740> some<00:00:19.800> help<00:00:20.279> to

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
video just to provide some help to

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.730 
video just to provide some help to
people<00:00:20.990> who<00:00:21.990> might<00:00:23.869> like<00:00:24.869> to<00:00:24.900> see<00:00:25.199> that<00:00:25.350> splash

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
people who might like to see that splash

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.470 
people who might like to see that splash
screen<00:00:26.099> I<00:00:26.279> know<00:00:26.400> that's<00:00:26.760> probably<00:00:26.939> only<00:00:27.269> about

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
screen I know that's probably only about

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.519 
screen I know that's probably only about
one<00:00:27.660> or<00:00:27.840> two<00:00:27.960> percent<00:00:28.230> of<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.410> population

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
one or two percent of the population

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.910 
one or two percent of the population
maybe<00:00:29.250> 10<00:00:29.550> percent<00:00:29.699> most<00:00:30.420> I<00:00:31.260> think<00:00:31.740> most

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
maybe 10 percent most I think most

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.260 
maybe 10 percent most I think most
people<00:00:32.250> just<00:00:32.520> didn't<00:00:32.850> really<00:00:33.059> like<00:00:33.239> that

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
people just didn't really like that

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.780 
people just didn't really like that
splash<00:00:33.840> screen<00:00:34.200> and<00:00:34.410> of<00:00:35.250> course<00:00:35.520> Microsoft

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
splash screen and of course Microsoft

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.600 
splash screen and of course Microsoft
realized<00:00:36.600> that<00:00:36.840> that's<00:00:37.530> exactly<00:00:37.770> why<00:00:38.280> they

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
realized that that's exactly why they

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.030 
realized that that's exactly why they
basically<00:00:39.000> have<00:00:39.660> this<00:00:39.840> feature<00:00:40.079> now<00:00:40.230> where

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
basically have this feature now where

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.920 
basically have this feature now where
once<00:00:41.520> you<00:00:41.670> hit<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.270> start<00:00:42.510> button

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
once you hit the start button

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.020 
once you hit the start button
it<00:00:43.829> basically<00:00:44.040> winds<00:00:44.760> up<00:00:44.879> having<00:00:45.600> your<00:00:47.030> start

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
it basically winds up having your start

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.580 
it basically winds up having your start
tiles<00:00:48.270> here<00:00:48.950> to<00:00:49.950> the<00:00:50.039> right<00:00:50.250> of<00:00:50.750> this<00:00:51.750> column

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
tiles here to the right of this column

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:58.010 
tiles here to the right of this column
here<00:00:52.860> okay<00:00:53.629> so<00:00:56.210> there's<00:00:57.210> probably<00:00:57.719> small

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
here okay so there's probably small

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.680 
here okay so there's probably small
percentage<00:00:58.559> of<00:00:58.649> people<00:00:58.800> like<00:00:59.160> I<00:00:59.309> said<00:00:59.690> that

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
percentage of people like I said that

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.869 
percentage of people like I said that
actually<00:01:00.899> like<00:01:01.440> those<00:01:01.710> splash<00:01:02.219> tiles<00:01:02.579> those

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
actually like those splash tiles those

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.280 
actually like those splash tiles those
those<00:01:03.120> Windows<00:01:03.510> Metro<00:01:04.460> windows<00:01:05.460> 8<00:01:05.640> Metro

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290 
those Windows Metro windows 8 Metro

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.140 
those Windows Metro windows 8 Metro
tiles<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.560> splash<00:01:08.220> tiles<00:01:08.520> to<00:01:08.700> actually<00:01:09.000> go

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150
