either the first or third question then

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.789 
either the first or third question then
you<00:01:40.560> have<00:01:40.680> a<00:01:40.710> problem<00:01:41.659> if<00:01:42.659> you're<00:01:42.930> putting<00:01:43.680> the

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.260 
planning direct sunlight it will die
because<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.229> plant<00:01:46.470> does<00:01:46.619> not<00:01:46.939> grow<00:01:47.939> in

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
because the plant does not grow in

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.179 
because the plant does not grow in
direct<00:01:48.540> sunlight<00:01:48.750> in<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.110> wild<00:01:49.439> so<00:01:49.680> it<00:01:49.920> will

self-contained<00:03:08.950> in<00:03:09.250> the<00:03:09.610> growing<00:03:09.790> container

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
self-contained in the growing container

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.800 
self-contained in the growing container
and<00:03:11.190> yes<00:03:12.190> those<00:03:12.520> are<00:03:12.790> my<00:03:12.940> birds<00:03:13.210> making<00:03:13.570> noise

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
and yes those are my birds making noise

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:15.360 
and yes those are my birds making noise
behind<00:03:13.990> me<00:03:14.230> try<00:03:14.530> to<00:03:14.590> ignore<00:03:14.980> them

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
behind me try to ignore them

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:16.920 
behind me try to ignore them
so<00:03:15.670> most<00:03:15.820> people<00:03:16.060> find<00:03:16.210> their<00:03:16.360> lucky<00:03:16.570> bamboos

to be and this plant is very healthy if
you<00:03:53.709> look<00:03:53.890> at<00:03:54.070> another<00:03:54.340> plant<00:03:54.670> which<00:03:54.820> I'll

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:54.940 
you look at another plant which I'll

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:56.760 
you look at another plant which I'll
show<00:03:55.060> you<00:03:55.120> a<00:03:55.180> picture<00:03:55.420> right<00:03:55.570> now<00:03:55.750> of<00:03:56.140> this

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:56.770 
show you a picture right now of this

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:59.100 
show you a picture right now of this
plant<00:03:57.100> is<00:03:57.310> not<00:03:57.760> healthy<00:03:58.209> and<00:03:58.480> the<00:03:58.630> leaves<00:03:58.840> are

00:03:59.100 --> 00:03:59.110 
plant is not healthy and the leaves are

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:02.070 
plant is not healthy and the leaves are
extremely<00:03:59.740> yellow<00:04:00.100> and<00:04:00.310> the<00:04:01.209> roots<00:04:01.450> are<00:04:01.690> very

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:02.080 
extremely yellow and the roots are very

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:05.550 
extremely yellow and the roots are very
badly<00:04:02.350> damaged<00:04:03.000> so<00:04:04.000> if<00:04:04.480> you<00:04:04.930> have<00:04:05.170> a<00:04:05.200> plant

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 
badly damaged so if you have a plant

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.310 
badly damaged so if you have a plant
that<00:04:05.680> has<00:04:05.800> no<00:04:06.430> roots<00:04:06.760> on<00:04:06.970> it<00:04:07.120> at<00:04:07.270> all<00:04:07.300> and<00:04:07.750> it

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:08.320 
that has no roots on it at all and it

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:10.770 
that has no roots on it at all and it
looks<00:04:08.709> like<00:04:08.800> it's<00:04:09.040> dying<00:04:09.310> what<00:04:10.060> you<00:04:10.239> can<00:04:10.390> do<00:04:10.570> is

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:10.780 
looks like it's dying what you can do is

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.280 
looks like it's dying what you can do is
get<00:04:11.440> a<00:04:11.680> drinking<00:04:12.250> cup<00:04:12.930> and<00:04:13.930> pour<00:04:14.170> some

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.290

get a drinking cup and pour some
purified<00:04:14.800> water<00:04:14.980> in<00:04:15.190> it<00:04:15.370> nothing<00:04:15.790> else<00:04:15.970> no

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 
purified water in it nothing else no

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.150 
purified water in it nothing else no
fertilizer<00:04:16.600> and<00:04:16.840> nothing<00:04:17.200> just<00:04:17.590> purified

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.160 
fertilizer and nothing just purified

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.130 
fertilizer and nothing just purified
water<00:04:18.370> and<00:04:18.640> then<00:04:19.480> leave<00:04:19.720> it<00:04:19.750> in<00:04:19.930> that

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:20.140 
water and then leave it in that

00:04:23.969 --> 00:04:23.979 
start to notice that it will develop a

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:24.780 
start to notice that it will develop a
lot<00:04:24.370> of<00:04:24.490> root

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:24.790

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:34.930 
which I'm pretty proud of because this

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:37.500 
which I'm pretty proud of because this
takes<00:04:35.140> about<00:04:35.430> two<00:04:36.430> years<00:04:36.460> to<00:04:36.760> get<00:04:37.000> these<00:04:37.120> socks

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:37.510

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:44.410 
spiral which most people don't think

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:46.200 
spiral which most people don't think
much<00:04:44.740> of<00:04:44.770> when<00:04:45.070> they<00:04:45.190> see<00:04:45.250> them<00:04:45.490> so<00:04:45.760> just

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:46.210

long time so okay so like I said if your
bamboo<00:04:56.590> looks<00:04:57.010> like<00:04:57.160> it's<00:04:57.310> dying<00:04:57.520> the<00:04:58.150> last

00:04:58.380 --> 00:04:58.390 
bamboo looks like it's dying the last

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:01.140 
bamboo looks like it's dying the last
resort<00:04:58.720> to<00:04:59.620> get<00:05:00.100> it<00:05:00.250> to<00:05:00.340> come<00:05:00.520> back<00:05:00.550> to<00:05:00.790> life<00:05:00.880> is

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:01.150 
resort to get it to come back to life is

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:03.200 
resort to get it to come back to life is
to<00:05:01.180> just<00:05:01.480> put<00:05:01.630> in<00:05:01.780> some<00:05:01.810> nice<00:05:02.260> clean<00:05:02.530> water

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:03.210

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:06.750 
to just put in some nice clean water
purified<00:05:04.210> like<00:05:04.480> I<00:05:04.720> said<00:05:05.020> and<00:05:05.580> leave<00:05:06.580> it<00:05:06.700> in

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:06.760 
purified like I said and leave it in

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:08.040 
purified like I said and leave it in
there<00:05:06.940> for<00:05:06.970> a<00:05:07.210> month<00:05:07.330> and<00:05:07.540> let<00:05:07.660> it<00:05:07.780> develop

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.050 
there for a month and let it develop

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:10.590 
there for a month and let it develop
some<00:05:08.320> new<00:05:08.350> roots<00:05:08.730> and<00:05:09.730> once<00:05:09.940> it<00:05:10.060> develops<00:05:10.450> new

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:10.600 
some new roots and once it develops new

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.600 
some new roots and once it develops new
roots<00:05:10.840> then<00:05:11.200> you<00:05:11.440> can<00:05:11.680> go<00:05:11.890> ahead<00:05:11.980> and<00:05:12.250> plant<00:05:12.430> it

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:12.610 
roots then you can go ahead and plant it

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:14.880 
roots then you can go ahead and plant it
