to get my boat up a little bit higher

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.010 
to get my boat up a little bit higher
when<00:01:29.189> it's<00:01:29.369> sitting<00:01:29.610> because<00:01:30.329> I<00:01:30.720> don't<00:01:30.900> have<00:01:30.960> a

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
when it's sitting because I don't have a

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.530 
when it's sitting because I don't have a
garage<00:01:31.259> as<00:01:31.590> you<00:01:31.740> can<00:01:31.890> see<00:01:32.130> it<00:01:32.450> watering<00:01:33.450> needs

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
garage as you can see it watering needs

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.990 
garage as you can see it watering needs
to<00:01:33.720> run<00:01:33.900> out<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.380> back<00:01:34.530> of<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.710> boat

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.000 
to run out the back of the boat

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.020 
to run out the back of the boat
with<00:01:37.420> your<00:01:37.600> bracket<00:01:37.930> soldiers<00:01:39.030> have<00:01:40.030> in<00:01:40.240> here

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
with your bracket soldiers have in here

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.850 
with your bracket soldiers have in here
and<00:01:43.030> you<00:01:44.020> grab<00:01:44.260> your<00:01:44.290> trailer<00:01:44.710> jack<00:01:46.860> something

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:47.860 
and you grab your trailer jack something

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.580 
and you grab your trailer jack something
you<00:01:47.920> have<00:01:48.010> to<00:01:48.160> do<00:01:48.310> is<00:01:48.460> line<00:01:48.760> up<00:01:48.790> the<00:01:49.030> holes<00:01:49.590> and

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
you have to do is line up the holes and

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.800 
you have to do is line up the holes and
you<00:01:50.740> figure<00:01:51.040> the<00:01:51.250> spacing<00:01:51.990> ease<00:01:53.250> this<00:01:54.250> is<00:01:54.460> a

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
you figure the spacing ease this is a

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.720 
you figure the spacing ease this is a
three<00:01:55.810> by<00:01:55.990> three<00:01:56.160> but<00:01:57.160> this<00:01:57.310> will<00:01:57.430> work<00:01:57.460> for

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:57.730 
three by three but this will work for

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:59.490 
three by three but this will work for
many<00:01:57.940> other<00:01:58.120> combinations<00:01:58.840> with<00:01:59.020> multiple

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 
many other combinations with multiple

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.360 
many other combinations with multiple
holes<00:02:00.060> I<00:02:01.060> figured<00:02:02.050> space<00:02:02.770> it<00:02:02.950> out<00:02:03.040> evenly

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:03.370 
holes I figured space it out evenly

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:06.780 
holes I figured space it out evenly
would<00:02:03.700> be<00:02:03.880> use<00:02:04.180> the<00:02:04.450> second<00:02:05.230> hole<00:02:05.520> and<00:02:06.520> the

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:06.790 
would be use the second hole and the

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:10.100 
would be use the second hole and the
second<00:02:07.150> hole

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.010 

you<00:02:10.530> need<00:02:10.680> to<00:02:10.770> put<00:02:11.040> the<00:02:11.250> bolt<00:02:11.880> side<00:02:12.180> on<00:02:12.600> the

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
you need to put the bolt side on the

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.520 
you need to put the bolt side on the
trailer<00:02:13.350> side<00:02:13.790> trailer<00:02:14.790> jack<00:02:15.030> side<00:02:15.530> because

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
trailer side trailer jack side because

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.650 
trailer side trailer jack side because
this<00:02:16.770> thing<00:02:17.010> will<00:02:17.190> swing<00:02:17.670> when<00:02:18.120> it's<00:02:18.270> in<00:02:18.420> place

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
this thing will swing when it's in place

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.920 
this thing will swing when it's in place
and<00:02:18.960> you<00:02:19.260> don't<00:02:19.380> want<00:02:19.590> the<00:02:19.740> nuts<00:02:19.920> and<00:02:20.660> heads<00:02:21.660> to
