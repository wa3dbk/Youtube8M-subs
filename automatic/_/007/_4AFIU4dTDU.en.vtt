exploitation<00:01:51.450> going<00:01:52.450> on<00:01:52.570> behind<00:01:52.690> me<00:01:52.900> so

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
exploitation going on behind me so

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:54.540 
exploitation going on behind me so
pretty<00:01:53.410> much<00:01:53.560> the<00:01:54.010> soldiers<00:01:54.340> are<00:01:54.460> going

pretty much the soldiers are going
inside<00:01:54.790> the<00:01:55.030> buildings<00:01:55.420> and<00:01:55.690> looking<00:01:56.290> for<00:01:56.470> any

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
inside the buildings and looking for any

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.360 
information that might help the

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.870 
information that might help the
follow-on<00:01:58.720> missions<00:01:59.290> I<00:01:59.560> think<00:02:00.550> the<00:02:00.610> best<00:02:00.730> way

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
follow-on missions I think the best way

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.160 
follow-on missions I think the best way
to<00:02:00.910> describe<00:02:01.180> is<00:02:01.450> pretty<00:02:01.660> much<00:02:01.780> they're<00:02:01.930> going

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
to describe is pretty much they're going

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:03.600 
to describe is pretty much they're going
in<00:02:02.290> there<00:02:02.440> and<00:02:02.560> taking<00:02:02.620> notes<00:02:03.070> on<00:02:03.220> everything

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610 
in there and taking notes on everything

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:05.640 
in there and taking notes on everything
they<00:02:03.730> find<00:02:03.910> -<00:02:04.540> whether<00:02:04.720> it's<00:02:04.930> electronics

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:05.650 
they find - whether it's electronics

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:09.090 
they find - whether it's electronics
cell<00:02:06.310> phones<00:02:06.610> on<00:02:07.170> any<00:02:08.170> kind<00:02:08.320> of<00:02:08.440> papers<00:02:08.830> that

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.100 
cell phones on any kind of papers that

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.700 
cell phones on any kind of papers that
might<00:02:09.340> give<00:02:10.240> intelligence<00:02:10.560> to<00:02:11.560> higher

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:11.710 
might give intelligence to higher

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:13.140 
might give intelligence to higher
command<00:02:12.070> so<00:02:12.280> that<00:02:12.430> we<00:02:12.550> could<00:02:12.730> have<00:02:12.880> a<00:02:12.940> better

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
command so that we could have a better

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:19.980 
command so that we could have a better
follow<00:02:13.450> on<00:02:13.600> mission<00:02:18.540> personally<00:02:19.540> I<00:02:19.660> think

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:19.990 
follow on mission personally I think

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:22.860 
follow on mission personally I think
it's<00:02:20.170> a<00:02:20.230> great<00:02:20.320> great<00:02:20.950> opportunity<00:02:21.870> this

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
it's a great great opportunity this

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.070 
it's a great great opportunity this
person<00:02:23.200> is<00:02:23.290> like<00:02:23.440> my<00:02:23.740> first<00:02:23.950> mission<00:02:25.080> in

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
person is like my first mission in

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.530 
person is like my first mission in
Ukraine<00:02:26.760> and<00:02:27.760> I<00:02:27.910> think<00:02:28.120> will<00:02:28.210> do<00:02:28.300> a<00:02:28.330> lot<00:02:28.480> of

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
Ukraine and I think will do a lot of

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.360 
Ukraine and I think will do a lot of
good<00:02:28.720> for<00:02:28.900> them<00:02:29.020> I<00:02:29.320> think<00:02:29.860> they<00:02:29.920> have<00:02:30.010> a<00:02:30.100> lot<00:02:30.250> to

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
good for them I think they have a lot to

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.520 
good for them I think they have a lot to
learn<00:02:30.520> I<00:02:30.970> think<00:02:31.510> we<00:02:31.750> can<00:02:31.840> also<00:02:31.990> learn<00:02:32.230> a<00:02:32.290> lot

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
learn I think we can also learn a lot

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:33.870 
learn I think we can also learn a lot
from<00:02:32.590> them<00:02:32.920> since<00:02:33.190> they've<00:02:33.340> actually<00:02:33.520> been

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
from them since they've actually been

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.150 
from them since they've actually been
out<00:02:34.750> to<00:02:34.930> the<00:02:35.020> east<00:02:35.170> I<00:02:35.470> just<00:02:35.860> think<00:02:36.010> it's<00:02:36.100> a

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
out to the east I just think it's a

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:37.470 
out to the east I just think it's a
great<00:02:36.340> opportunity<00:02:36.640> to<00:02:36.970> work<00:02:37.060> with<00:02:37.330> our

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
great opportunity to work with our

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.350 
great opportunity to work with our
