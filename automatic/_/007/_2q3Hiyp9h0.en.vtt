00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:19.500 
you why I won't buy the galaxy gear let
me<00:03:18.190> talk<00:03:18.340> about<00:03:18.370> smartwatches<00:03:19.000> in<00:03:19.180> general

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
me talk about smartwatches in general

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.630 
me talk about smartwatches in general
for<00:03:19.690> a<00:03:19.720> second<00:03:20.170> so<00:03:20.740> I<00:03:20.770> think<00:03:21.010> smart<00:03:21.460> watches

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
for a second so I think smart watches

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.850 
for a second so I think smart watches
like<00:03:21.880> this<00:03:22.210> will<00:03:22.990> never<00:03:23.110> be<00:03:23.230> a<00:03:23.320> product<00:03:23.620> for

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:23.860 
like this will never be a product for

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:25.500 
like this will never be a product for
the<00:03:23.920> masses<00:03:24.310> because<00:03:24.790> I<00:03:25.000> don't<00:03:25.240> have<00:03:25.360> any

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
the masses because I don't have any

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.240 
the masses because I don't have any
unique<00:03:25.780> features<00:03:26.170> you<00:03:26.590> can<00:03:26.680> already<00:03:27.010> make

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.280 
smart phone and in order to use all the
features<00:03:33.550> of<00:03:33.880> your<00:03:34.000> smart<00:03:34.300> watch<00:03:34.480> you<00:03:34.990> need<00:03:35.200> to

carry<00:03:35.560> that<00:03:35.680> phone<00:03:35.950> anyways<00:03:36.460> so<00:03:37.120> the<00:03:37.300> only

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
carry that phone anyways so the only

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:39.930 
carry that phone anyways so the only
value<00:03:37.960> brings<00:03:38.230> this<00:03:38.530> it's<00:03:39.040> an<00:03:39.190> extra<00:03:39.580> screen

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
value brings this it's an extra screen

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.900 
value brings this it's an extra screen
that's<00:03:40.570> easy<00:03:40.900> to<00:03:41.080> access<00:03:41.500> on<00:03:41.740> your<00:03:41.800> wrist<00:03:42.250> but

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
that's easy to access on your wrist but

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:44.820 
that's easy to access on your wrist but
doesn't<00:03:43.300> have<00:03:43.420> any<00:03:43.630> unique<00:03:43.900> features<00:03:44.320> that's

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:44.830 
doesn't have any unique features that's

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:46.650 
doesn't have any unique features that's
why<00:03:44.950> I<00:03:44.980> don't<00:03:45.070> think<00:03:45.310> people<00:03:45.820> would<00:03:46.420> really

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:46.660 
why I don't think people would really

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.320 
why I don't think people would really
buy<00:03:47.020> it<00:03:47.080> some<00:03:47.800> tech<00:03:48.040> people<00:03:48.220> like<00:03:48.460> us<00:03:48.640> will<00:03:49.180> be

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:49.330 
buy it some tech people like us will be

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:51.840 
buy it some tech people like us will be
interested<00:03:49.840> but<00:03:50.350> my<00:03:51.010> normal<00:03:51.430> friends<00:03:51.550> would

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:51.850 
interested but my normal friends would

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:53.850 
interested but my normal friends would
never<00:03:52.000> spend<00:03:52.270> money<00:03:52.450> on<00:03:52.660> that<00:03:52.780> alright<00:03:53.620> now

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:53.860

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.450 
Galaxy s4 but my main concern is the

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.360 
Galaxy s4 but my main concern is the
battery<00:04:01.870> Samsung<00:04:02.560> claims<00:04:02.830> that<00:04:03.010> will<00:04:03.160> last

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
battery Samsung claims that will last

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:06.390 
battery Samsung claims that will last
about<00:04:03.580> 25<00:04:04.090> hours<00:04:04.480> in<00:04:04.660> a<00:04:04.720> normal<00:04:05.140> usage<00:04:05.350> we<00:04:06.160> all

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
about 25 hours in a normal usage we all

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:07.860 
about 25 hours in a normal usage we all
know<00:04:06.670> from<00:04:06.820> experience<00:04:07.240> that<00:04:07.360> products

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
know from experience that products

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:09.840 
know from experience that products
rarely<00:04:08.290> lift<00:04:08.470> up<00:04:08.620> to<00:04:08.770> the<00:04:08.860> battery<00:04:09.070> life<00:04:09.400> the

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:09.850 
rarely lift up to the battery life the

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:12.420 
rarely lift up to the battery life the
manufacturer<00:04:10.570> says<00:04:10.840> it<00:04:11.140> has<00:04:11.380> plus<00:04:12.130> we<00:04:12.280> don't

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.430 
manufacturer says it has plus we don't

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:14.430 
manufacturer says it has plus we don't
know<00:04:12.640> what<00:04:12.790> normally<00:04:13.120> usage<00:04:13.420> is<00:04:13.660> so<00:04:14.170> you<00:04:14.290> will

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:14.440 
know what normally usage is so you will

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:15.600 
know what normally usage is so you will
need<00:04:14.560> to<00:04:14.620> load<00:04:14.860> this<00:04:14.980> thing<00:04:15.190> every<00:04:15.580> night

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:15.610 
need to load this thing every night

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:17.849 
need to load this thing every night
assume<00:04:16.420> Akash's<00:04:16.900> through<00:04:17.080> a<00:04:17.140> day<00:04:17.350> and<00:04:17.620> don't

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:17.859 
assume Akash's through a day and don't

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:19.349 
assume Akash's through a day and don't
forget<00:04:18.070> that<00:04:18.250> better<00:04:18.430> performance<00:04:19.030> can<00:04:19.239> go

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:19.359 
forget that better performance can go

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:21.210 
forget that better performance can go
down<00:04:19.540> quickly<00:04:19.840> so<00:04:20.410> if<00:04:20.470> we<00:04:20.590> even<00:04:20.830> get<00:04:21.010> worse

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:21.220 
down quickly so if we even get worse

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.460 
down quickly so if we even get worse
with<00:04:21.489> time<00:04:21.520> there's<00:04:22.330> more<00:04:22.420> to<00:04:22.900> charge<00:04:23.200> it<00:04:23.350> you

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.470 
with time there's more to charge it you

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:25.410 
with time there's more to charge it you
will<00:04:23.620> need<00:04:23.710> to<00:04:23.830> use<00:04:24.010> a<00:04:24.040> special<00:04:24.580> device<00:04:24.790> so<00:04:25.360> if

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:25.420 
will need to use a special device so if

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:27.060 
will need to use a special device so if
you<00:04:25.510> spent<00:04:25.750> a<00:04:25.840> nice<00:04:25.990> summer<00:04:26.200> a<00:04:26.380> spontaneously
