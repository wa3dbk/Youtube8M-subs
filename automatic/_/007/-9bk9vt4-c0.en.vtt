00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
to fit this is C the piece though you

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.249 
to fit this is C the piece though you
need<00:01:23.369> to<00:01:23.490> basically<00:01:23.670> cut<00:01:24.240> off<00:01:24.270> so<00:01:24.990> relieved

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
need to basically cut off so relieved

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.819 
need to basically cut off so relieved
about<00:01:26.060> say<00:01:27.060> about<00:01:27.299> one<00:01:27.840> to<00:01:28.409> two<00:01:28.470> millimeters

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
about say about one to two millimeters

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.510 
about say about one to two millimeters
left<00:01:29.369> take<00:01:30.270> you<00:01:30.329> to<00:01:30.659> be<00:01:30.780> safe

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
slightly enlarge the hole so this still

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.020 
slightly enlarge the hole so this still
fits<00:01:48.570> in<00:01:48.720> there<00:01:48.979> show<00:01:49.979> you<00:01:50.040> inside<00:01:50.369> and<00:01:50.790> this

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:56.659 
is the finished adjuster you can see yep

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:07.790 
is the finished adjuster you can see yep
that<00:01:57.659> piece<00:01:57.960> has<00:01:58.259> been<00:01:58.619> chopped

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:07.800 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:13.250 

that<00:02:08.800> piece<00:02:09.099> I've<00:02:09.369> chopped<00:02:09.789> off<00:02:10.319> make<00:02:11.319> it<00:02:11.349> fit

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
too much often it's slightly moving very

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:42.610 
too much often it's slightly moving very
slightly<00:02:41.270> you<00:02:41.570> can<00:02:41.600> just<00:02:41.930> put<00:02:42.110> a<00:02:42.140> washer<00:02:42.530> on

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
slightly you can just put a washer on

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.070 
slightly you can just put a washer on
there<00:02:42.820> and<00:02:43.820> that<00:02:44.030> also<00:02:44.180> the<00:02:44.540> clearance<00:02:44.900> issue

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
there and that also the clearance issue

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:50.760 
there and that also the clearance issue
to<00:02:46.040> do<00:02:46.160> your<00:02:46.460> spring<00:02:47.440> you<00:02:48.440> see<00:02:48.620> how<00:02:48.680> it<00:02:48.800> touches

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:50.770 
to do your spring you see how it touches

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:53.980 
to do your spring you see how it touches
yeah<00:02:51.770> that<00:02:52.670> thought<00:02:53.090> that<00:02:53.120> is<00:02:53.390> captain<00:02:53.780> on<00:02:53.900> the

this<00:03:21.860> side<00:03:22.190> and<00:03:22.900> this<00:03:23.900> spring<00:03:24.200> has<00:03:24.380> been

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
this side and this spring has been

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.410
