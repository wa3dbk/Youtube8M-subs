mascara<00:02:37.920> I<00:02:38.250> did<00:02:38.819> not<00:02:39.030> do<00:02:39.239> false<00:02:39.480> lashes

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
mascara I did not do false lashes

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.350 
mascara I did not do false lashes
because<00:02:40.380> she<00:02:40.799> does<00:02:41.400> not<00:02:41.430> have<00:02:41.790> super<00:02:42.150> thick

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
because she does not have super thick

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.270 
because she does not have super thick
voluminous<00:02:42.810> lashes<00:02:43.080> so<00:02:43.470> I'm<00:02:43.560> very<00:02:43.799> very

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
voluminous lashes so I'm very very

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.970 
voluminous lashes so I'm very very
lightly<00:02:44.610> coating<00:02:45.060> my<00:02:45.180> lashes<00:02:45.500> taking<00:02:46.500> a<00:02:46.709> lot

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
lightly coating my lashes taking a lot

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.470 
lightly coating my lashes taking a lot
of<00:02:47.130> care<00:02:47.340> to<00:02:47.370> make<00:02:47.670> sure<00:02:47.700> I<00:02:47.910> don't<00:02:48.030> get<00:02:48.360> it<00:02:48.450> very

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
of care to make sure I don't get it very

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.330 
of care to make sure I don't get it very
smudgy<00:02:49.080> or<00:02:49.230> messy<00:02:49.530> on<00:02:49.709> my<00:02:49.830> lower<00:02:50.040> lashes

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
smudgy or messy on my lower lashes

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.640 
smudgy or messy on my lower lashes
because<00:02:51.090> our<00:02:51.390> eyes<00:02:51.540> are<00:02:51.569> very<00:02:52.079> very<00:02:52.349> clean

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
because our eyes are very very clean

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.110 
because our eyes are very very clean
throughout<00:02:52.920> the<00:02:53.040> movie<00:02:53.310> so<00:02:53.519> just<00:02:53.730> a<00:02:53.849> little

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
throughout the movie so just a little

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.930 
throughout the movie so just a little
bit<00:02:54.269> will<00:02:54.420> do<00:02:54.680> as<00:02:55.680> usual<00:02:56.040> to<00:02:56.370> kind<00:02:56.610> of<00:02:56.700> clean

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
bit will do as usual to kind of clean

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.430 
bit will do as usual to kind of clean
the<00:02:57.030> look<00:02:57.209> up<00:02:57.390> a<00:02:57.510> little<00:02:57.720> bit<00:02:57.870> I'm<00:02:58.019> going<00:02:58.260> to

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
the look up a little bit I'm going to

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.550 
the look up a little bit I'm going to
very<00:02:58.620> lightly<00:02:58.709> contour<00:02:59.489> and<00:02:59.790> I'm<00:02:59.910> using<00:03:00.150> my

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
very lightly contour and I'm using my

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.870 
very lightly contour and I'm using my
makeup<00:03:01.560> forever<00:03:01.950> I<00:03:02.099> almost<00:03:02.310> forgot<00:03:02.640> the<00:03:02.730> name

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
makeup forever I almost forgot the name

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.630 
makeup forever I almost forgot the name
my<00:03:03.239> makeup<00:03:03.660> forever<00:03:04.040> finishing<00:03:05.040> powder<00:03:05.250> and

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
my makeup forever finishing powder and

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:06.949 
my makeup forever finishing powder and
this<00:03:05.760> is<00:03:05.940> actually<00:03:06.269> just<00:03:06.450> like<00:03:06.540> a<00:03:06.569> setting

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
this is actually just like a setting

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:08.420 
this is actually just like a setting
powder<00:03:06.989> but<00:03:07.470> I<00:03:07.500> accidentally<00:03:07.860> got<00:03:08.010> a<00:03:08.160> shade

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
powder but I accidentally got a shade

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:09.920 
powder but I accidentally got a shade
that<00:03:08.459> was<00:03:08.700> too<00:03:08.849> dark<00:03:09.030> for<00:03:09.090> me<00:03:09.299> so<00:03:09.540> it<00:03:09.630> works<00:03:09.780> as

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
that was too dark for me so it works as

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.890 
that was too dark for me so it works as
a<00:03:10.200> perfect<00:03:10.370> beautiful<00:03:11.370> natural<00:03:12.060> contour<00:03:12.660> so

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
a perfect beautiful natural contour so

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.809 
a perfect beautiful natural contour so
I'm<00:03:12.989> just<00:03:13.140> using<00:03:13.290> that<00:03:13.560> to<00:03:13.620> kind<00:03:13.920> of<00:03:14.069> contour

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819 
I'm just using that to kind of contour

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:16.640 
I'm just using that to kind of contour
my<00:03:15.030> cheekbones<00:03:15.299> and<00:03:15.780> give<00:03:15.930> my<00:03:16.049> face<00:03:16.230> a<00:03:16.380> little

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
my cheekbones and give my face a little

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
you can just run out and buy a really

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:50.840 
you can just run out and buy a really
cheap<00:03:49.170> pair<00:03:49.470> of<00:03:49.680> clip-on<00:03:50.100> bangs<00:03:50.370> and<00:03:50.609> kind<00:03:50.790> of

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
cheap pair of clip-on bangs and kind of

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:52.699 
cheap pair of clip-on bangs and kind of
cut<00:03:51.060> them<00:03:51.239> up<00:03:51.329> yourself<00:03:51.480> I<00:03:51.959> probably<00:03:52.440> should

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
cut them up yourself I probably should

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:54.199 
cut them up yourself I probably should
have<00:03:52.739> twisted<00:03:53.250> my<00:03:53.280> bangs<00:03:53.579> a<00:03:53.760> little<00:03:53.940> bit<00:03:54.060> to

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
have twisted my bangs a little bit to

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:55.789 
have twisted my bangs a little bit to
make<00:03:54.329> them<00:03:54.420> look<00:03:54.569> stringy<00:03:54.930> like<00:03:55.139> hers<00:03:55.410> but<00:03:55.709> it

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:55.799 
make them look stringy like hers but it

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:57.949 
make them look stringy like hers but it
totally<00:03:56.010> skipped<00:03:56.430> my<00:03:56.519> mind<00:03:56.549> but<00:03:57.060> I<00:03:57.299> think<00:03:57.810> it

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
totally skipped my mind but I think it

00:03:57.959 --> 00:03:59.809 
totally skipped my mind but I think it
still<00:03:58.230> looks<00:03:58.410> rather<00:03:58.650> comparable<00:03:59.430> and<00:03:59.609> that's

00:03:59.809 --> 00:03:59.819 
still looks rather comparable and that's

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:02.449 
still looks rather comparable and that's
all<00:04:00.060> that<00:04:00.239> really<00:04:00.389> matters<00:04:00.840> but<00:04:01.829> anyway<00:04:02.220> that

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
all that really matters but anyway that

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:04.280 
all that really matters but anyway that
completes<00:04:02.940> the<00:04:03.090> entire<00:04:03.209> look<00:04:03.660> for<00:04:03.930> Lydia

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
completes the entire look for Lydia

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:04.819 
completes the entire look for Lydia
