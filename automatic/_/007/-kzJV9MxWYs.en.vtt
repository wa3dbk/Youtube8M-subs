00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
simple execution is you're able to just

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:12.990 
simple execution is you're able to just
go<00:02:11.350> in<00:02:11.530> and<00:02:11.650> editorialize<00:02:12.400> that<00:02:12.610> list<00:02:12.820> while

content creators are starting to use
SmartGlass<00:02:22.840> to<00:02:23.170> do<00:02:23.290> and<00:02:24.220> I<00:02:24.430> think<00:02:24.640> that<00:02:24.730> you're

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
SmartGlass to do and I think that you're

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:26.070 
SmartGlass to do and I think that you're
just<00:02:24.940> going<00:02:25.150> to<00:02:25.210> see<00:02:25.330> them<00:02:25.450> get<00:02:25.630> richer<00:02:25.960> and

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
just going to see them get richer and

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.160 
just going to see them get richer and
richer<00:02:26.140> with<00:02:26.500> how<00:02:26.650> they<00:02:26.800> use<00:02:26.980> it
