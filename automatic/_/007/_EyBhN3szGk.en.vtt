00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
edge over here looks a little bit

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.700 
edge over here looks a little bit
different<00:00:41.040> this<00:00:41.700> is<00:00:41.760> a<00:00:41.879> TPU<00:00:42.239> case<00:00:42.540> oh<00:00:42.570> it's<00:00:43.500> a

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
different this is a TPU case oh it's a

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.040 
different this is a TPU case oh it's a
flexible<00:00:44.610> but<00:00:44.879> it's<00:00:45.149> not<00:00:45.420> quite<00:00:45.690> as<00:00:45.870> flexible

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
flexible but it's not quite as flexible

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.450 
flexible but it's not quite as flexible
silicone<00:00:47.090> it<00:00:48.090> won't<00:00:48.329> stretch<00:00:48.780> out<00:00:49.020> or<00:00:49.460> you

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
silicone it won't stretch out or you

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.209 
silicone it won't stretch out or you
know<00:00:50.550> deform<00:00:50.969> change<00:00:51.300> shape<00:00:51.480> or<00:00:51.629> anything<00:00:52.219> so

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
know deform change shape or anything so

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.799 
know deform change shape or anything so
let's<00:00:53.399> get<00:00:53.489> into<00:00:53.550> this<00:00:53.969> case<00:00:54.180> it's<00:00:54.390> really

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
let's get into this case it's really

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.389 
let's get into this case it's really
easy<00:00:54.960> to<00:00:55.079> install<00:00:55.500> you<00:00:55.620> just<00:00:55.649> slide<00:00:56.100> it<00:00:56.280> in

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
easy to install you just slide it in

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.450 
easy to install you just slide it in
like<00:00:56.760> so<00:00:57.090> I<00:00:57.649> usually<00:00:58.649> slide<00:00:58.920> this<00:00:59.100> side<00:00:59.309> with

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
like so I usually slide this side with

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.580 
like so I usually slide this side with
the<00:00:59.550> buttons<00:00:59.850> and<00:01:00.030> first<00:01:00.210> and<00:01:00.420> just<00:01:00.570> snap<00:01:01.559> it

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
the buttons and first and just snap it

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.070 
the buttons and first and just snap it
into<00:01:01.800> place<00:01:01.920> like<00:01:02.160> that<00:01:02.250> it<00:01:03.239> does<00:01:03.600> offer<00:01:03.809> lay

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
into place like that it does offer lay

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.600 
into place like that it does offer lay
on<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.320> table<00:01:04.350> design<00:01:04.890> so<00:01:05.159> you<00:01:05.220> can<00:01:05.400> go<00:01:05.489> ahead

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
on the table design so you can go ahead

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.130 
on the table design so you can go ahead
and<00:01:05.729> leave<00:01:05.880> your<00:01:06.060> phone<00:01:06.330> down<00:01:06.570> and<00:01:06.810> you<00:01:06.990> won't

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
and leave your phone down and you won't

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.380 
and leave your phone down and you won't
have<00:01:07.200> any<00:01:07.409> issues<00:01:07.830> with<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.850> screen<00:01:09.119> getting

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
have any issues with the screen getting

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:10.730 
have any issues with the screen getting
dirty<00:01:09.600> or<00:01:09.780> scratched<00:01:10.049> up<00:01:10.229> or<00:01:10.380> anything<00:01:10.470> like

don't use my flash much on the iphone 4
but<00:01:18.659> I<00:01:18.900> did<00:01:19.380> test<00:01:19.799> it<00:01:19.920> out<00:01:19.979> with<00:01:20.040> this<00:01:20.310> case<00:01:20.490> and

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
but I did test it out with this case and

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.300
