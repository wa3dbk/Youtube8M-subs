00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.550

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.309
 which is nowadays if you have not know that it is very difficult to career 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:43.609

 one of the recordings but it's still really very important to be in a 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:54.940
 pastoral letter and not just a complement then it is important that 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:55.610
 you 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:00.450
 as a professional leaves here in this case the classes and that has a result 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:04.690

 people will want here along these videos that I'll be posting mp in this 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:10.040
 period 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.040
 I would like to be trained very much with the methodology 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:19.140
 the whole city as if it were natural to impute the methodology that 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.360
 one should not lose in the Olympic one in which you counterpart the governor 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:24.469
 tarso genro pt 

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:28.770
 It's a totally banned thing. We come here in Venezuela to 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.990
 discuss methodologies but rather 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.799
 so that you have given more attention to what the press is 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.260
 I did not create anything I just did a workout every day that I consider 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.780

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.070
 I made my face 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.940
 Of course, each one has their own very important creativity that you 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.880
 use their own city but it is to make the class better and better 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.100
 and more actionable 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.600

 knowledge with soap 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.920

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.590
 I have had several wonderful results in the vast majority 90% 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.280
 of the students have had results 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.240

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:57.400
 the athlete is even going to come back and will do his marketing using machines 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.349
 of the profession in each piece did not want

 the park importance of the newspaper import meat into the house not because it will not 

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:09.759

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:14.329
 was present on the premises is what is is a more advertising tool 

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:15.689
 important 

00:03:15.689 --> 00:03:19.939
 and is most effective it is also very important that you build in the 

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:22.690
 month up actually 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:25.939
 on top of legal planning over the year 

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:31.549
 now in a construction of the falsification plant on top of that is this 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:34.370
 copies of other people do it yourself 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:37.849
 anyone who has a doubt that is not serious 

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:42.949
 I do not know if a charming person is yourself but of course there are the 

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:46.859
 methodologies to be copied as I did I had a little bit from here 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:53.809
 This increase in metallurgy on the agenda students have been 

00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:59.039
 legal and what is most important is when the student is very well you 

00:03:59.039 --> 00:04:00.850
 prefers to receive captures 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:06.090
 he also reports that it is common for someone who had nothing to do 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.680
 a law that came into force this year 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.589
 &amp; eth you have twitter it too 

00:04:11.589 --> 00:04:12.869
 Fernanda

 and this is what we are going to work for a month of the decisive ones in your video of 

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:22.060
 presentation and believe that I'm there making you 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:25.779
 still my goal here commented 

00:04:25.779 --> 00:04:31.229
 is to make you loose about traditional and who all follow 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:33.379
 of faith in a letter addressed to the room 

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:38.460
 when you do something good to no one the result is the tactical one because the 

00:04:38.459 --> 00:04:39.439
 results 

00:04:39.439 --> 00:04:42.140
 of other people will speak hectares 

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:43.529
 will start 

00:04:43.529 --> 00:04:44.730
 the luck 

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:49.580
 naturally without forcing the bar so I guess this is cool when you 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:51.469
 according to police the mind 

00:04:51.469 --> 00:04:53.580
 modernity feel 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:58.080
 but this guy who is not so cool to stay with it is cool and 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:02.840
 creating more do not settle for what you have yesterday always said 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:07.490
 seek something more nowadays with the advent of the internet of various ages and 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:11.990
 uncovered, but it only depends on how light it gets. 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:16.460
 really make the house a little bit worse than the results already 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:18.100
 know we are neither 

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:22.770
 it is no use discussing methodologies each school each professional only one and 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:26.970
 adds, but I'm here to try to open a little bit 

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:30.730
