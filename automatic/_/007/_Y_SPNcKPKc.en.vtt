00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:39.649 
I'm just sort of cutting a little slit
to<00:01:35.579> create<00:01:35.909> sort<00:01:36.270> of<00:01:36.360> like<00:01:36.420> a<00:01:36.600> half<00:01:37.439> circle<00:01:38.659> I'm

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
to create sort of like a half circle I'm

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:40.940 
to create sort of like a half circle I'm
gonna<00:01:39.840> go<00:01:39.960> all<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.170> way<00:01:40.229> around<00:01:40.380> I<00:01:40.650> usually

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
gonna go all the way around I usually

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.350 
gonna go all the way around I usually
get<00:01:41.070> about<00:01:41.220> four<00:01:41.579> of<00:01:41.700> these<00:01:41.880> across<00:01:44.270> but<00:01:45.270> you

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
get about four of these across but you

get about four of these across but you
want<00:01:45.509> to<00:01:45.570> cut<00:01:45.810> in<00:01:46.049> you<00:01:46.200> wanna<00:01:46.350> make<00:01:46.439> sure<00:01:46.470> you

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
want to cut in you wanna make sure you

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.859 
want to cut in you wanna make sure you
cut<00:01:46.860> in<00:01:47.070> all<00:01:47.640> right<00:01:47.850> then<00:01:48.479> what<00:01:48.659> you're<00:01:48.780> gonna

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
cut in all right then what you're gonna

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.950 
cut in all right then what you're gonna
do<00:01:49.170> take<00:01:49.770> your<00:01:49.920> knife<00:01:50.130> and<00:01:50.430> just<00:01:50.600> cut<00:01:51.600> a<00:01:51.659> little

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
do take your knife and just cut a little

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.289 
do take your knife and just cut a little
bit<00:01:52.170> of<00:01:52.259> this<00:01:52.409> red<00:01:52.740> off<00:01:52.950> between<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.820> two

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
bit of this red off between the two

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.620 
bit of this red off between the two
petals<00:01:54.600> and<00:01:55.729> actually<00:01:56.729> to<00:01:56.850> be<00:01:56.939> honest<00:01:57.270> it'll

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
petals and actually to be honest it'll

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.300 
petals and actually to be honest it'll
look<00:01:57.719> pretty<00:01:57.899> even<00:01:58.140> if<00:01:58.320> you<00:01:58.590> don't<00:01:58.890> do<00:01:59.100> this

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
look pretty even if you don't do this

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.240 
look pretty even if you don't do this
step<00:01:59.810> but<00:02:00.810> I<00:02:01.110> think<00:02:01.409> the<00:02:01.530> contrast<00:02:02.040> between

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
step but I think the contrast between

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.440 
step but I think the contrast between
the<00:02:02.549> red<00:02:02.700> and<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:02.880> white<00:02:02.909> looks<00:02:03.210> really

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
the red and the white looks really

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.780 
the red and the white looks really
pretty<00:02:03.659> so<00:02:04.409> it's<00:02:04.710> worth<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:04.920> extra<00:02:05.159> 30

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
pretty so it's worth the extra 30

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.089 
pretty so it's worth the extra 30
seconds<00:02:06.500> alright<00:02:07.500> once<00:02:07.770> you're<00:02:07.920> done<00:02:07.979> with

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
seconds alright once you're done with

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.430 
seconds alright once you're done with
that<00:02:08.160> we're<00:02:08.759> gonna<00:02:08.879> create<00:02:09.090> more<00:02:09.330> petals<00:02:09.629> so

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
that we're gonna create more petals so

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.660 
that we're gonna create more petals so
now<00:02:10.619> we're<00:02:10.739> going<00:02:10.830> to<00:02:10.890> go<00:02:11.009> in<00:02:11.190> between<00:02:11.310> the

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
now we're going to go in between the

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.370 
now we're going to go in between the
petals<00:02:11.849> you<00:02:12.120> already<00:02:12.360> created

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
petals you already created

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.200 
petals you already created
so<00:02:14.220> again<00:02:14.460> just<00:02:14.730> kind<00:02:15.120> of<00:02:15.420> curve<00:02:15.750> it<00:02:15.960> like<00:02:16.350> that

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:17.210 
so again just kind of curve it like that

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:19.430 
so again just kind of curve it like that
you<00:02:18.210> want<00:02:18.330> to<00:02:18.390> make<00:02:18.480> sure<00:02:18.510> it's<00:02:18.780> still<00:02:19.020> intact

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
you want to make sure it's still intact

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.610 
you want to make sure it's still intact
at<00:02:19.650> the<00:02:19.740> bottom<00:02:20.660> and<00:02:21.660> when<00:02:22.110> you<00:02:22.200> do<00:02:22.290> it<00:02:22.410> first

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
at the bottom and when you do it first

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.200 
at the bottom and when you do it first
time<00:02:22.830> probably<00:02:23.250> do<00:02:23.520> it<00:02:23.610> a<00:02:23.670> lot<00:02:23.850> slower<00:02:24.090> than

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 
time probably do it a lot slower than

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.780 
time probably do it a lot slower than
I'm<00:02:24.480> doing<00:02:24.510> right<00:02:25.020> now<00:02:25.080> but<00:02:25.890> I've<00:02:26.040> done<00:02:26.280> many

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
I'm doing right now but I've done many

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.400 
I'm doing right now but I've done many
of<00:02:26.970> these<00:02:27.210> because<00:02:27.480> my<00:02:27.720> kids<00:02:27.990> think<00:02:28.230> they're

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
of these because my kids think they're

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.150 
of these because my kids think they're
so<00:02:28.680> cute<00:02:29.300> all<00:02:30.300> right<00:02:30.360> and<00:02:30.660> then<00:02:30.980> just<00:02:31.980> keep

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
so cute all right and then just keep

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.070 
so cute all right and then just keep
going<00:02:32.220> between<00:02:32.640> the<00:02:33.000> petals<00:02:33.210> as<00:02:33.600> many<00:02:33.810> as<00:02:33.960> you

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
going between the petals as many as you

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.080 
going between the petals as many as you
can<00:02:34.140> fit<00:02:34.470> without<00:02:34.800> ruining<00:02:34.980> that<00:02:35.280> pretty<00:02:35.700> top

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
can fit without ruining that pretty top

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:41.570 
can fit without ruining that pretty top
you<00:02:36.330> made<00:02:37.970> and<00:02:39.440> this<00:02:40.440> is<00:02:40.650> the<00:02:40.770> most<00:02:40.950> important

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
you made and this is the most important

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.670 
you made and this is the most important
step<00:02:42.000> of<00:02:42.210> this<00:02:42.420> whole<00:02:42.660> thing<00:02:42.930> once<00:02:43.500> you're

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
step of this whole thing once you're

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.860 
step of this whole thing once you're
done<00:02:43.830> with<00:02:43.980> all<00:02:44.220> the<00:02:44.460> cutting<00:02:44.760> you<00:02:45.270> have<00:02:45.300> to
