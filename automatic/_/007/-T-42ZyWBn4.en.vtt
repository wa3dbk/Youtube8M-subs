good day to be working in my garage on
this<00:00:08.760> project<00:00:10.010> where<00:00:11.010> here's<00:00:11.250> what<00:00:11.490> my<00:00:11.849> Joyner

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
this project where here's what my Joyner

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.709 
this project where here's what my Joyner
looks<00:00:12.540> like<00:00:13.790> what<00:00:14.790> this<00:00:14.940> will<00:00:15.150> do<00:00:15.299> is<00:00:15.330> put<00:00:15.690> a

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
looks like what this will do is put a

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.220 
looks like what this will do is put a
nice<00:00:16.220> true<00:00:17.220> edge<00:00:17.490> on<00:00:18.000> the<00:00:18.330> board<00:00:18.539> take<00:00:18.900> out<00:00:19.080> any

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
nice true edge on the board take out any

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.040 
nice true edge on the board take out any
cupping<00:00:19.710> take<00:00:20.189> a<00:00:20.220> closer<00:00:20.580> look<00:00:20.730> at<00:00:21.029> this<00:00:21.210> the

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
cupping take a closer look at this the

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.200 
cupping take a closer look at this the
board<00:00:22.320> is<00:00:22.470> put<00:00:22.800> on<00:00:22.949> the<00:00:23.130> machine<00:00:23.460> like<00:00:23.699> this<00:00:23.730> up

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
board is put on the machine like this up

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.950 
board is put on the machine like this up
against<00:00:24.660> this<00:00:25.369> cast<00:00:26.369> iron<00:00:26.609> fence<00:00:27.060> there's<00:00:27.869> a

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
against this cast iron fence there's a

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.299 
against this cast iron fence there's a
blade<00:00:28.429> underneath<00:00:29.429> it<00:00:30.240> spins<00:00:30.660> and<00:00:31.080> as<00:00:31.949> it<00:00:32.130> gets

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
blade underneath it spins and as it gets

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.700 
blade underneath it spins and as it gets
fed<00:00:32.610> through<00:00:32.880> it<00:00:33.270> just<00:00:33.450> takes<00:00:33.780> a<00:00:33.989> fraction<00:00:34.440> of

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
fed through it just takes a fraction of

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.799 
fed through it just takes a fraction of
an<00:00:34.829> inch<00:00:34.920> off<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.280> edge<00:00:35.489> of<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:35.730> board<00:00:35.910> chews

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
an inch off the edge of the board chews

00:00:36.809 --> 00:01:09.690 
an inch off the edge of the board chews
it<00:00:36.989> up<00:00:37.079> to<00:00:37.230> a<00:00:37.260> nice<00:00:37.620> 90<00:00:38.219> degree<00:00:38.550> angle

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:09.700 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.920 

alright<00:01:10.700> all<00:01:10.850> my<00:01:11.030> parts<00:01:11.360> have<00:01:11.510> now<00:01:11.660> been

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930 
alright all my parts have now been

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.740 
alright all my parts have now been
joined<00:01:12.320> on<00:01:12.590> one<00:01:12.890> side<00:01:13.190> on<00:01:13.550> one<00:01:13.730> edge<00:01:13.970> which

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.750 
joined on one side on one edge which

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:16.330 
joined on one side on one edge which
gives<00:01:15.020> me<00:01:15.140> a<00:01:15.170> nice<00:01:15.410> true<00:01:15.710> edge<00:01:15.890> to<00:01:16.100> run<00:01:16.220> up

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
gives me a nice true edge to run up

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.760 
gives me a nice true edge to run up
against<00:01:16.580> the<00:01:16.760> fence<00:01:16.970> to<00:01:17.270> cut<00:01:17.900> these<00:01:18.110> two<00:01:18.620> their

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
against the fence to cut these two their

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:46.830 
against the fence to cut these two their
final<00:01:18.800> width

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.150 

starting<00:01:47.840> to<00:01:47.930> get<00:01:48.050> some<00:01:48.260> scrap<00:01:48.590> now<00:01:48.860> that<00:01:49.070> I'm

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:49.160 
starting to get some scrap now that I'm

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:50.980 
starting to get some scrap now that I'm
getting<00:01:49.550> down<00:01:49.910> to<00:01:50.150> the<00:01:50.330> end<00:01:50.360> of<00:01:50.660> cutting

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
getting down to the end of cutting

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:56.020 
getting down to the end of cutting
everything<00:01:51.380> to<00:01:51.710> width<00:01:54.460> and<00:01:55.460> although<00:01:55.820> there

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
everything to width and although there

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:57.430 
everything to width and although there
doesn't<00:01:56.360> look<00:01:56.450> like<00:01:56.630> there's<00:01:56.810> a<00:01:56.870> big<00:01:57.080> change

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:57.440 
doesn't look like there's a big change

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.680 
doesn't look like there's a big change
everything<00:01:58.310> is<00:01:58.790> exactly<00:01:59.030> the<00:01:59.570> right

00:01:59.680 --> 00:01:59.690 
everything is exactly the right

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:02.970 
everything is exactly the right
thickness<00:02:00.050> and<00:02:00.470> exactly<00:02:01.250> the<00:02:01.580> right<00:02:01.730> with<00:02:02.240> now

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:02.980 
thickness and exactly the right with now

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:05.290 
thickness and exactly the right with now
everything<00:02:03.980> has<00:02:04.160> to<00:02:04.310> be<00:02:04.340> cut<00:02:04.640> to<00:02:04.880> its<00:02:05.030> proper

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:05.300 
everything has to be cut to its proper

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
everything has to be cut to its proper
length<00:02:10.750> what<00:02:11.750> I<00:02:11.780> like<00:02:12.110> to<00:02:12.230> do<00:02:13.360> is<00:02:14.360> to<00:02:15.140> get<00:02:15.290> a

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.320 
length what I like to do is to get a

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.890 
length what I like to do is to get a
nice<00:02:15.530> room<00:02:15.800> edge<00:02:16.310> I'll<00:02:16.820> nip<00:02:17.270> a<00:02:17.300> little<00:02:17.630> bit<00:02:17.750> off

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
nice room edge I'll nip a little bit off

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.360 
nice room edge I'll nip a little bit off
of<00:02:18.080> this<00:02:18.260> edge<00:02:18.560> and<00:02:18.970> my<00:02:19.970> fence<00:02:20.240> over<00:02:21.190> take<00:02:22.190> that

of this edge and my fence over take that

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.600 
of this edge and my fence over take that
new<00:02:23.020> true<00:02:24.020> edge<00:02:24.230> put<00:02:24.770> it<00:02:24.830> up<00:02:24.890> against<00:02:25.160> my<00:02:25.220> stop

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
new true edge put it up against my stop

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.440 
new true edge put it up against my stop
block<00:02:25.880> and<00:02:26.660> cut<00:02:27.650> off<00:02:27.800> the<00:02:28.010> other<00:02:28.040> side<00:02:28.490> so<00:02:29.390> I

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
block and cut off the other side so I

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:34.840 
block and cut off the other side so I
have<00:02:29.690> to<00:02:30.020> nice<00:02:30.470> 90<00:02:31.070> degree<00:02:31.310> angle<00:02:31.670> edges<00:02:33.850> dust

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
have to nice 90 degree angle edges dust

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:59.979 
have to nice 90 degree angle edges dust
collector<00:02:35.420> on

you an idea what it will look like there
will<00:03:23.250> be<00:03:23.400> a<00:03:23.430> quarter<00:03:23.909> inch<00:03:24.090> piece<00:03:24.299> of<00:03:24.480> paneling

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
will be a quarter inch piece of paneling

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.600 
will be a quarter inch piece of paneling
which<00:03:25.140> will<00:03:25.409> drop<00:03:25.650> into<00:03:25.860> the<00:03:26.010> center<00:03:26.430> of<00:03:26.459> this
