00:00:01.779 --> 00:00:07.079
 you look at the LTV with the Packard Bell to there it 200 Vogts the comma 

00:00:07.079 --> 00:00:10.069
 1 inch screen reflective and 

00:00:10.069 --> 00:00:13.159
 who will be commuting in Ahaus Troche's usage phase today 

00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:18.599
 one and just have to this time just this here 

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:22.159
 nicely remove cover of their underside 

00:00:22.159 --> 00:00:25.589
 so it is also screw once here have a screw just so the room 

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:26.789
 can remove 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.099
 too sour store already Kant or three screws so the hard drive 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:31.499
 change 

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:34.809
 or want to exchange the Bluetooth w-lan chip optically one 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:36.760
 Screw loose made we can see 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.700
 the problem is that it can not be done easily or should you 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.539
 can easily enter with the finger 

00:00:41.539 --> 00:00:44.870
 and it can not lift off too high but rather short BMI which is why I am always here 

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:45.500
 my 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.390
 the legal one plastic card 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:49.600
 open anyway 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.490
 So after it's screwed on 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:55.200
 It's easy to do that and then we're sure we have one 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:00.220
 In this case, maximum installed tram are two possible ddr2 so-dimm memory easy 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:01.160
 as always 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.280
 once right once too left too much 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.330
 with hall cover or helped 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.270
 a grid here up or to the side push 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.110
 then comes out already and we can see we have one 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.070
 Nolan company 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.689
 built around a former one 

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:19.780
 with Samsung chips so song contest finally good 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.660
 and yes wanted to use it 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:25.660
 the short side must be left just beautiful here 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.270
 stuck so that you almost no longer see the contacts here and then 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.450
 press down 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:32.870
 that is a burden 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:36.090
 and then you have to go shit the new Peugeot Black remains after you 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.270
 Building death is because it is not far enough already have one and the 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.950
 Contact is not good in it 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.130
 otherwise 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.400
 then again here 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.080
 Put on plastic cover 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:48.850
 Press dry ice 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.850
 SuS SchÃ¶nberg naked and then another screw 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.140
 and the wars then even if Ramos research 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.230
 to exchange data as already mentioned just here are three 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:01.130
 Loosen screws 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.170
 would not necessarily come out of here you see it still still infected 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.000
 a little stupid 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.929
 "I think I screwed some of them back in 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:11.419
 turn around 

00:02:11.419 --> 00:02:14.950
 and so they will not just screwed up so much used unscrewed 

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:15.579
 are 

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:17.680
 could either go here with your finger 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.909
 this sounds like something easier had to be locked 

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:23.909
 and then this cover could decrease more 

00:02:24.779 --> 00:02:28.229
 and therefore we are struggling here to bring the HDD here 

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:32.749
 to compete with voters the interesting thing is that there was one more 

00:02:33.249 --> 00:02:36.339
 Percent other Peci Express suicide 

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:38.579
 So here you could theoretically still one 

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:41.829
 ASTM it's never completely short installation 

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:44.829
 or possibly a UMTS to engines 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:49.149
 when of course you can also the w-lan and Bluetooth piece completely 

00:02:49.149 --> 00:02:51.019
 Honolulu in the solid build 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:54.219
 or as with the soulful two pci-express 

00:02:54.219 --> 00:02:55.699
 despite being very nice for me 

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:59.129
 Hard drive is quite easy even after he has made this cover 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:02.129
 remove because you just have to back on this Plastiki 

00:03:02.649 --> 00:03:04.809
 7 

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:06.969
 pull tight 

00:03:06.969 --> 00:03:10.199
 and then it looks like the hard drive is coming out slowly 

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:14.940
 and there she is already has 460 work with 5000 revolutions 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.940
 produced in December 2009 

00:03:18.669 --> 00:03:21.799
 so it's really not hard at Packard Bell dot s 

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:27.559
 to exchange the offal, above all, it is good that the percentage here 

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:30.119
 Board can still be installed now I unfortunately can there for 

00:03:30.119 --> 00:03:32.549
 test 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:35.179
 with four screws I'm not completely satisfied 

00:03:35.179 --> 00:03:38.509
 if that goes far enough to accept the other screws 

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:40.609
 to all also freely visible 

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:43.769
 but that does not necessarily mean I'll maybe take a few pictures too 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:44.719
 we do not do that 

00:03:44.719 --> 00:03:47.879
 to that come here yet underscore subscribers but as it 

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:51.099
 actually not necessary because you could get what you need everywhere 

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:56.109
 that was ballast even with other TV and the Packard Bell dot s 2 now I show 

00:03:56.109 --> 00:03:56.739
 you still 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:58.019
 fast one man 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:01.709
 All over the year we would have to rattle the first time and then 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:05.099
 Altenwald performances 

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:06.629
 and screw together 

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:10.189
 even if the climax comes you will find more tutorials and the TuS 

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:12.209
 Wrapping Packard Bell dot that was natural 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:13.709
 and 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:16.180
 yes sports again when it says 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.719
 very cool and boxing 

00:04:18.719 --> 00:04:19.809
 Percent see that
