as<00:00:36.829> I<00:00:37.829> rotate<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.520> lenses<00:00:38.940> in<00:00:39.090> this<00:00:39.239> nose

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
as I rotate the lenses in this nose

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.600 
as I rotate the lenses in this nose
piece<00:00:39.840> it's<00:00:40.350> a<00:00:40.440> good<00:00:40.620> time<00:00:40.860> to<00:00:41.040> point<00:00:41.219> out<00:00:41.399> that

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
piece it's a good time to point out that

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.910 
piece it's a good time to point out that
we<00:00:41.760> have<00:00:41.790> four<00:00:42.390> different<00:00:42.420> lenses<00:00:43.379> in<00:00:43.680> our

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:13.549 

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:16.670 

okay<00:01:14.549> so<00:01:14.790> we'll<00:01:15.420> begin<00:01:15.600> with<00:01:15.930> taking<00:01:16.140> a<00:01:16.350> slide

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
okay so we'll begin with taking a slide

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.969 
okay so we'll begin with taking a slide
and<00:01:17.009> we'll<00:01:17.340> put<00:01:17.549> it<00:01:17.670> on<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.150> stage<00:01:18.979> notice

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
and we'll put it on the stage notice

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.130 
and we'll put it on the stage notice
that<00:01:20.130> I<00:01:20.189> rotated<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:20.909> nosepiece<00:01:21.150> back<00:01:21.689> to<00:01:22.020> the

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
that I rotated the nosepiece back to the

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.170 
that I rotated the nosepiece back to the
shortest<00:01:22.560> lens<00:01:22.830> we<00:01:23.280> always<00:01:23.580> start<00:01:23.909> focusing

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
shortest lens we always start focusing

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.010 
shortest lens we always start focusing
with<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:25.049> 4x<00:01:25.830> lens<00:01:26.130> in<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.520> viewing

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
with the 4x lens in the viewing

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.649 
with the 4x lens in the viewing
dition<00:01:27.320> once<00:01:28.280> my<00:01:28.549> slide<00:01:28.850> is<00:01:29.060> on<00:01:29.240> the<00:01:29.390> stage

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:29.659 
dition once my slide is on the stage

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:32.590 
dition once my slide is on the stage
then<00:01:30.560> I<00:01:30.679> will<00:01:30.859> rotate<00:01:31.130> the<00:01:31.579> stage<00:01:31.880> all<00:01:32.210> the<00:01:32.479> way

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
then I will rotate the stage all the way

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:33.789 
then I will rotate the stage all the way
up<00:01:32.750> until<00:01:33.079> it<00:01:33.229> stops

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:33.799 
up until it stops

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:37.870 
up until it stops
using<00:01:34.310> the<00:01:34.429> coarse<00:01:34.759> focus<00:01:35.119> knob<00:01:36.340> once<00:01:37.340> I<00:01:37.490> feel

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
using the coarse focus knob once I feel

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.760 
using the coarse focus knob once I feel
it<00:01:38.060> stop<00:01:38.329> I'll<00:01:38.840> go<00:01:39.049> ahead<00:01:39.170> and<00:01:39.409> look<00:01:39.590> through

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
it stop I'll go ahead and look through

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.440 
it stop I'll go ahead and look through
the<00:01:39.950> ocular<00:01:40.670> lenses<00:01:41.659> or<00:01:42.020> the<00:01:42.289> eyepieces<00:01:42.829> and

moving the coarse focus knob down until

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.069 
moving the coarse focus knob down until
I<00:01:48.170> find<00:01:48.469> my<00:01:48.619> specimen<00:01:49.310> in<00:01:49.429> view<00:01:49.700> once<00:01:50.659> I<00:01:50.840> have

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:51.079 
I find my specimen in view once I have

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:53.679 
I find my specimen in view once I have
it<00:01:51.110> in<00:01:51.350> focus<00:01:51.560> I<00:01:52.039> could<00:01:52.490> use<00:01:52.670> the<00:01:52.880> fine<00:01:53.149> focus

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:53.689 
it in focus I could use the fine focus

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:56.649 
it in focus I could use the fine focus
knob<00:01:53.929> just<00:01:54.469> to<00:01:54.649> clarify<00:01:54.920> it<00:01:55.250> a<00:01:55.429> little<00:01:55.640> bit<00:01:55.850> but

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:56.659 
knob just to clarify it a little bit but

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:00.010 
knob just to clarify it a little bit but
now<00:01:56.810> I've<00:01:57.020> set<00:01:57.319> up<00:01:57.350> my<00:01:57.469> optics<00:01:58.219> to<00:01:59.179> allow<00:01:59.599> me<00:01:59.810> to

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
now I've set up my optics to allow me to

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.319 
now I've set up my optics to allow me to
toggle<00:02:00.560> through<00:02:00.829> the<00:02:01.130> lenses<00:02:01.579> and<00:02:01.759> continue

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:02.329 
toggle through the lenses and continue

I just have to slide my oil lens in

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.720 
I just have to slide my oil lens in
position<00:03:36.769> which<00:03:37.769> is<00:03:37.890> why<00:03:38.069> it's<00:03:38.250> important<00:03:38.670> to

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
position which is why it's important to

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.539 
position which is why it's important to
know<00:03:38.880> which<00:03:39.239> one<00:03:39.480> is<00:03:39.630> your<00:03:39.780> oil<00:03:39.959> lens<00:03:40.549> I'm

going to slide my nosepiece slide that

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:46.009 
going to slide my nosepiece slide that
oil<00:03:43.980> lens<00:03:44.250> in<00:03:44.459> the<00:03:44.610> position<00:03:45.060> notice<00:03:45.720> that<00:03:45.870> it

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
oil lens in the position notice that it

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:47.930 
oil lens in the position notice that it
comes<00:03:46.200> really<00:03:46.500> close<00:03:46.799> to<00:03:47.040> the<00:03:47.160> slide<00:03:47.430> and<00:03:47.459> even

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
comes really close to the slide and even

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.000 
comes really close to the slide and even
touches<00:03:48.360> the<00:03:48.510> oil<00:03:48.720> because<00:03:49.380> that's<00:03:49.650> what<00:03:49.860> it's

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
touches the oil because that's what it's

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.180 
touches the oil because that's what it's
designed<00:03:50.160> to<00:03:50.519> do<00:03:51.140> looking<00:03:52.140> through<00:03:52.440> my<00:03:52.620> ocular

designed to do looking through my ocular
lenses<00:03:53.610> if<00:03:53.880> it's<00:03:54.060> a<00:03:54.150> little<00:03:54.330> fuzzy<00:03:54.720> all<00:03:55.170> I<00:03:55.230> have

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
lenses if it's a little fuzzy all I have

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.740 
lenses if it's a little fuzzy all I have
to<00:03:55.860> do<00:03:56.010> is<00:03:56.190> use<00:03:56.370> the<00:03:56.549> fine<00:03:56.760> focus<00:03:57.060> knob<00:03:57.390> again

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
to do is use the fine focus knob again

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:02.360 
to do is use the fine focus knob again
to<00:03:57.930> clarify<00:03:59.510> sometimes<00:04:00.510> it's<00:04:01.440> still<00:04:01.920> hard<00:04:02.280> to

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
to clarify sometimes it's still hard to

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.610 
to clarify sometimes it's still hard to
find<00:04:02.670> your<00:04:02.880> sample<00:04:03.330> and<00:04:03.600> when<00:04:04.200> this<00:04:04.380> is<00:04:04.590> the
