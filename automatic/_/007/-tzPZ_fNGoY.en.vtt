00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.370
 so well all the greetings dear friends 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.810
 with you again i 'm ether wolf today i am 

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:09.150
 did make such a small video tutorial 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:12.480
 which tell you how to beat beat 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.490
 fwa 14 penalty I think almost everyone knows 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.460
 how to do it but basically it is only 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:20.939
 I think whether to be targeted yet 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:25.529
 for beginners probably we choose about 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:29.550
 penalty so nose zaglyuchila something so 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.420
 it all means that's a penalty we mean like 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.500
 beat a penalty 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:37.079
 start with this means you see the cursor 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.420
 near me ronaldo such a wand ride 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.879
 here's a red and yellow green line 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.559
 so you're waiting for this stick 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.960
 will be on the green line push 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.820
 choose the force also press on the blow and 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.379
 lead away after this if you 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.739
 want to break through the bay go to the side in 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.550
 any 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:56.309
 you want to wait still while we 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:59.039
 preferably in the green zone 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.980
 squeeze his blow these side that is all 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:05.670
 pretty just can not at all 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.770
 hold just the same blows wait 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.530
 the writer guess the water in the center 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:14.880
 be here's another important point are you 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:17.040
 push it is important not to pinch the side 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.799
 that is, see if I click yes that is 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.740
 and very far in mind the side tass that 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.180
 it will be just wow here it is just catch 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.729
 gets even with such a concourse 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.200
 circumstances here if very much 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:31.680
 remove the side here after all even here 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.509
 by beats here and another important point is impossible 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.970
 too much power to clean or see 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:41.040
 tremendous power then just came out rub 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:42.360
 will strike and everything means everything means 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.470
 now move on to more 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:48.299
 a heaped whack the first thing you must 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.460
 know what else you can beat with a cunning blow 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:53.189
 penalty but it is like but not important 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:57.320
 then just press the button 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:59.670
 keyboard button oh russian usa and punch 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.560
 mean and press after that hit and 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.340
 when this was led away to any 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.840
 after all he is so cheeks beats an empty corner 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.849
 Well, it depends on what was led to the corner not in 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:12.400
 Area there as a conclusion that there's more 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:16.959
 time yes you see a technical man spinning 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:23.620
 that means more well yet know will show 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:24.760
 it's also important not to squeeze the strength . 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.599
 forgot to show 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:32.170
 but if all the same here as newbies 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:34.420
 show what will happen if you choose not green 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.489
 zone yes and somehow away then 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.290
 that is, look here you choose the floor 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:39.730
 teeth let's say in the red zone right here 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.129
 just the name has already been pressed and yes 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.989
 try to punch and where to kill the general 

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:46.150
 just shoot a pigeon not at all 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:48.519
 I'll go where it hits 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.530
 the ram was in the red zone and nowhere 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:54.069
 more oh spark change microsd and 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:55.409
 Of course, green means what is next 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:58.480
 wanted to show more 

00:02:55.409 --> 00:03:00.010
 so you can still make a hit hard for 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.349
 machines can say so that is 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:05.590
 click like it was in the tap 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:08.319
 takeoff zone push strike compress a strike 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:10.900
 here while he runs again blumarine 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:13.299
 until you reached the hit and u 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.419
 that is , here you press again 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:20.079
 punch he runs again push punch and 

00:03:15.419 --> 00:03:22.419
 side so a blow to the center is better not 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:24.400
 beaten look yes again I do here 

00:03:22.419 --> 00:03:27.370
 so here I will not drive both by 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.900
 center see waterbury such moments 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.510
 the goalkeeper sneezes when the ball is centered 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.849
 youtube is still an important point with this lari 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.650
 it is very important that the cursor be exactly 

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:37.690
 the green zone is not even yellow because 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:39.849
 if they are yellow then at great risk and not 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:42.790
 get date 9 just happened and i don't 

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:44.440
 Clamp sales have not pressed I too 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.389
 I'll do the most if I have a piece 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.909
 green zone you see i'm calm 

00:03:46.389 --> 00:03:52.209
 drop top corner and that in fact the universal 

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:53.470
 they got one 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:56.889
 click on the green 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:04:00.129
 on the green again pushing the blows of the water 

00:03:56.889 --> 00:04:02.590
 the side is pretty simple and the last 

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:04.090
 type of impact kpi remind and this is a parachute 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:08.169
 To do this, click on the keyboard 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:08.979
 control key on the gamepad is in my opinion 

00:04:08.169 --> 00:04:11.709
 lt 

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:13.569
 but if I could be wrong chatted grt what 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:16.599
 do not numb clamping 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:18.310
 and click again here is very important 

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:19.989
 so that the cursor was on the zone because if 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:21.310
 he will be elsewhere you are not yet exactly 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:25.169
 get on goal 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:25.169
 that is, just click on the zone and 

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:28.419
 Daoud surprisingly managed to deceive 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:30.639
 goalkeeper 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:32.979
 but made that if you win against 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:34.539
 computer such even use 

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:36.490
 only when you win there 

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:38.590
 there are 40 there when you are sure that you are 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:41.530
 play that just make fun 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:44.020
 ordinary arter beat such blows that 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:46.750
 hour he strangely does not discourage but in 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:48.880
 in most cases he beats them off 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:51.849
 so a punch in the side of the side is better not to drink 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:53.800
 only in the center you see now 

00:04:51.849 --> 00:04:55.949
 zabivon is for countries that is again 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:58.569
 just press kontrol hold 

00:04:55.949 --> 00:05:01.150
 click hit well so here's another important 

00:04:58.569 --> 00:05:04.180
 moment ca n't wait too long for a hit 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:07.840
 here even two lines will be a lot of that 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:10.599
 look again at the two dashes but it 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:15.580
 more than bake glasses turned out yes then I 

00:05:10.599 --> 00:05:19.960
 I will show you once again about 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:22.060
 n runs not just an hour down let down 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:24.729
 if you will not strike it will strike 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:26.229
 by such a gift I do not advise 

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:29.199
 Use only if you are already all over 

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:32.560
 black cases do not now show how 

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:36.520
 beat kick them so now we 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:38.949
 let's play for defending for a second 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:40.479
 we are now playing for the goalkeeper that is 

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:42.880
 to move on the ribbons in 

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:43.719
 just use the stick keys I right now 

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:45.729
 there were two. 

00:05:43.719 --> 00:05:47.050
 that is, to move on a ribbon 

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:49.840
 just use the stick keys 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:53.080
 that you go with us just move 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:55.479
 where you want yes everything and but he jump but 

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:57.219
 tired if you try again on this 

00:05:55.479 --> 00:06:00.039
 key push delight goalkeeper jump 

00:05:57.219 --> 00:06:02.310
 will not mean how to make a quarter 

00:06:00.039 --> 00:06:04.659
 kick and on the second verse 

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:06.909
 click in the direction you want 

00:06:04.659 --> 00:06:08.680
 what did the goalkeeper hold yes just an automaton 

00:06:06.909 --> 00:06:10.270
 enter the direction you want 

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:12.669
 so that artoi can eat them 

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:16.780
 run on erected 

00:06:12.669 --> 00:06:20.469
 I'll say no to the best yet 

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:22.750
 press jump to wartortle side 

00:06:20.469 --> 00:06:24.729
 just before the strike because the player 

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:28.750
 who beats can make a false swing 

00:06:24.729 --> 00:06:31.270
 from the penalty spot and just simply wars wardar 

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:32.349
 yes even gave the gift will fall aside and the player 

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:34.539
 it will kill 

00:06:32.349 --> 00:06:35.740
 that is, this is such a feature then spices 

00:06:34.539 --> 00:06:36.740
 blow live in the side 

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:40.490
 something honest to me 

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:42.889
 the country is now once again not a veil of pier 

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:44.720
 blow that when he will see 

00:06:42.889 --> 00:06:47.900
 that he is probably going to beat that is 

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:49.940
 Well, you press the bar by date and 

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:53.539
 if u put a year to where it will be 

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:55.490
 beat yes here again he is analyzing broadcast 

00:06:53.539 --> 00:06:57.440
 so you can run here he runs 

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:59.240
 you press the side on the second verse no 

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:02.569
 no nato in which you run on the second 

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:05.300
 on which feint is necessary here means you 

00:07:02.569 --> 00:07:08.449
 you can also jump down to the side there 

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:10.729
 up in the side here for example up god here 

00:07:08.449 --> 00:07:15.919
 just hit the crossbar and such 

00:07:10.729 --> 00:07:17.960
 blows don't even jump here that is not 

00:07:15.919 --> 00:07:19.580
 you have to press the jump in advance because 

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:23.090
 you can make a swing and you fall 

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:25.220
 side and paste in your mouth will score here but in 

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:27.319
 In principle, I think it is so accessible. 

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:27.889
 pretty told how to beat beat 

00:07:27.319 --> 00:07:31.490
 penalty 

00:07:27.889 --> 00:07:33.560
 if you like it like 

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:37.340
 liked and dislikes and be sure 

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:38.599
 read leave comments I'm all 

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:43.639
 I read there if something is wrong 

00:07:38.599 --> 00:07:46.550
 I will try to fix it means you still 

00:07:43.639 --> 00:07:48.800
 at the same time i'm shooting my career for milan 

00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:50.419
 if you want you can leave there 

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:55.250
 can reference if you want for him 

00:07:50.419 --> 00:07:59.259
 go see my video oh well 

00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:59.259
 I myself have been a whiffer bye
