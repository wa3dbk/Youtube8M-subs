00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:16.780
 Hello dear viewers with you clay 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:19.090
 and today i would like your advice 

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:21.010
 and that much is not peculiar usually i 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:23.529
 I advise you how to act different 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:26.950
 situations I show tank tactics but 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:29.290
 now you will help me a 

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:31.989
 move on along your path 

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:34.329
 in general, I have a question I'm following 

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:36.850
 decided to launch a new category called 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:39.640
 she will farm time and be concluded 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:42.010
 it will be that I will not only 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.320
 share some impressions about 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.860
 premium tanks that i have in 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.010
 hangar 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:50.740
 but I will collect some definite Euler 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:53.530
 statistics in which it fell to participate 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:56.020
 and so let's say very essentially i just take 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:59.850
 some tank necessarily on the ground 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:01.900
 server rolls on it there are a hundred battles and 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.600
 I bring the results that is 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:07.869
 shows the average result and on damage 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:09.700
 average experience average income average 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:10.509
 level of battles percentage of wins in principle 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.570
 something like this 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:15.789
 and in the end we are now choosing with you 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.310
 the first tank for which you can do 

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:20.679
 video and i start salon on it 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:23.560
 roll on catholicity 

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:25.390
 fighting i will choose the most interesting fight and on 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.670
 his background in the first share 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:30.249
 impressions of the tank say what is in it 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.469
 good that allows you to farm because 

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:34.270
 that mouth any reviews straight tank i 

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:37.420
 specially looked pretty 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:41.380
 subjective and based precisely on 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:43.389
 some kind of objective impressions i 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.909
 I will try it a little more and reduce to 

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:48.579
 table to collect some statistics that 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:52.090
 I think it will also be interesting in general 

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:54.249
 for a start I have a certain park 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:56.770
 premium tanks of which you can in 

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:58.479
 principle start from you what is required from 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.770
 you are required to leave comments 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:02.149
 the name of the tank and all the rest 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.369
 will see a comment must have it for 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:06.950
 Plus I think it's not difficult and 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:09.649
 which tank will get more advantages swamp 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.840
 be the first to open this rubric 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:13.879
 Well, in general, write general interesting 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:18.709
 will it be whether it is just a fool's errand 

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:30.730
 actually what tanks are out of 5 of 6 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:32.660
 su 122 yaga 88 super pershing t-34 750 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:37.069
 type 59 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:39.920
 and vz-111 in fact I am not a word 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:42.049
 take some other tanks for now 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:45.410
 let's say not either lower level or 

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:47.569
 promotional because all the same format them 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:50.030
 will be a little different will be different 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:52.489
 but maybe when it ends right in 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.739
 placed try and on them maybe in 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:57.980
 in the future, I will update the park straight tango 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:03:00.890
 I will undermine the gold so I think that 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:03.650
 if you like the heading will live 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.269
 when the guys forgot to say one more time 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.819
 accent 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:10.579
 everything will happen in battles that is me 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:12.590
 I will definitely play alone because 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:15.950
 but not always we can platoon printing 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:18.470
 and the second moment I will shoot gold and 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:20.870
 we will check which tanks 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:23.000
 ill addicts who can farm and 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.620
 I will not get carried away 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.500
 I will shoot only the most necessary 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:29.389
 moments and actually just the same 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.040
 it should affect yield because 

00:03:29.389 --> 00:03:33.349
 that why do we need a prem tank if on 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.389
 he has to shoot gold all the time 

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:37.910
 I will have everything from consumables 

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:40.030
 standard is the first-aid kit repair and 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:42.440
 gold fire extinguisher therefore in principle 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:44.660
 something like that then there is no dock 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:47.169
 rations nothing will be very important 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:49.940
 so that the purity of the experiment was 

00:03:47.169 --> 00:03:53.299
 so start leave your comments 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:56.560
 I'll say goodbye to you and wait for the results 

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:56.560
 bye everyone
