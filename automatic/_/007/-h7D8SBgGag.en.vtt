00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:07.350
 saha him everyone welcome to the 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.059
 techno chain and we are found 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.860
 today to discover how 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.349
 install the new theme that is 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.910
 available for windows 7 which is os x 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.830
 mavericks the new system 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.960
 operating mac 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.400
 produced by apple I specify well 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.480
 obviously this is only a theme this 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.590
 is absolutely not the system 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.029
 operating that we will install 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.070
 today it's just a 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.260
 overlay actually that will come to be placed 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.550
 in front of your windows 7 in order to give 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.869
 this aspect that you can see 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.790
 currently in video 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.410
 you 're not going to be available 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.079
 your eyes the little dock carries in me I 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.239
 the little adjustment problem to my 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.180
 notice of my registration in any case 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.100
 I did not manage to make it work 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.219
 so here you have just the picture 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.600
 wait I'm not wrong yeah good 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.340
 I'm not going to get there here we 're plague 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.480
 this is just the image that goes 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.000
 to appear from the small dock 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.280
 I will get there the little dock that is 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.719
 super nice in any case to store his 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.329
 applications it's exactly the same 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.039
 dogues that we can have on apple and we 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.799
 obviously all the system that 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.990
 strongly resembles an act since 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.119
 you currently see the icons that 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.549
 we are available so the osx icon 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.960
 original mavericks as well as of course the 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.500
 wallpaper that I do not even have to 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.720
 present 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.280
 we have a little early actually done if I 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.650
 have to say since even the logo of 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.930
 images finally we really have all 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.509
 stolen documents video kids everything has been 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.640
 redo and think mac way it's not 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.869
 not a huge finish 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.430
 but in any case it's very pretty very 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.229
 nice and it changes us a little bit of this 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.329
 windows r2 and so on is from 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.130
 microsoft one has also available 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.840
 when we go to the top left of a 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.310
 new control with applications 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.990
 shortcuts that can be 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.009
 practice for some of you me 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.090
 I find that a little more than a cop 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.729
 another thing because when we want to 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.140
 activate the drop-down menu and have access 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.880
 to our personal files and ben actually 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.649
 the mouse will come to slide slightly 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.180
 on the left and offer you this menu which 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.759
 will bother you for a while 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.780
 we also have two available here that 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.189
 you can not see you 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.299
 unfortunately I am really sorry 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.009
 again I would put you the 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.750
 little picture for you to see 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.460
 it must be widgets so maybe 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.680
 that they are not they are not recognized in 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.930
 any case speaks by the recording but 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.550
 we have available to the google widget the 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.350
 weather widget 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.180
 shows as well as the little notes that 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.310
 can put itself so it's a widget 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.840
 again very friendly we can 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.610
 to add some also finally I you 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.590
 will put all this in photos directly 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.910
 on the live since you do not have the 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.220
 opportunity to see him and I do not know 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.890
 why I failed to succeed 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.270
 install it listen it's all for 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.500
 download all this is very simple 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:30.180
 you go into the description this 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.320
 are my own links so no link 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.090
 do not worry 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.980
 in order to install all this you go 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.990
 to have exactly what came up 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.150
 under your eyes right now rocket dog 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:40.650
 who the software will be able to see the little 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:44.340
 dock as I wanted to show there is to 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:46.200
 two seconds as well as mac os x leopard 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.510
 in fact that's going to be the theme that we have to 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.040
 install on the dock for that it's very 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.960
 simple once you have installed 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.880
 rockets doc you're going to open the 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:56.250
 original file of windows so 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:59.700
 let's imagine I think it's going to be 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:02.130
 here i go in windows application i 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.470
 am going to go on rockets doc which is 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.010
 here and I just slip into the folder 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.140
 skins 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.060
 attention I say well skins I come 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.080
 drag the little file that I open here 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.550
 in vip points 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.459
 here I come to slide this little file 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:16.739
 leopard directly into the skin and you 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:18.480
 will be able to have the opportunity to 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:20.310
 directly configure once you 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.540
 are on the dock doing a little 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.950
 right click unfortunately I can not 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.930
 you explain it directly since 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.030
 you do not see the dock again a 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.260
 times so in any case it's very simple 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.510
 I really invite you to watch 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.250
 other little tutorial on the internet on 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.200
 rocket dog which is called this software a 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.150
 very nice software to use 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.040
 to have the little bar exactly 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:40.080
 as under apple is of course the 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.150
 bone x mavericks software once 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:44.190
 you will open it and well you will not 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.930
 more than to install me I have everything 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.430
 by default it works nickel 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.900
 so I think there is no 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:51.060
 problem we can close our eyes and 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.709
 install it without any worries about it 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.730
 I hope this little video will have you 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:55.170

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:57.989
