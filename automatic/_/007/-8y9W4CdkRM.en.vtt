this for 14 days it's kind of lasted me

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.970 
this for 14 days it's kind of lasted me
longer<00:00:09.030> then<00:00:09.960> it<00:00:10.110> should<00:00:10.320> have<00:00:10.440> because<00:00:10.740> I

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
longer then it should have because I

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.009 
longer then it should have because I
skipped<00:00:11.490> days<00:00:11.790> I<00:00:12.179> was<00:00:12.360> sick<00:00:12.630> during<00:00:12.840> the

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
skipped days I was sick during the

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:14.419 
skipped days I was sick during the
process<00:00:13.500> so<00:00:13.740> I<00:00:13.769> didn't<00:00:14.040> really<00:00:14.070> feel<00:00:14.250> like

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
process so I didn't really feel like

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.519 
process so I didn't really feel like
putting<00:00:14.790> these<00:00:14.940> strips<00:00:15.210> in<00:00:15.360> my<00:00:15.450> mouth<00:00:15.660> but

yeah I basically I have one left over

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.450 
yeah I basically I have one left over
because<00:00:19.500> my<00:00:19.619> mother<00:00:19.859> would<00:00:20.039> really<00:00:20.369> really

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
because my mother would really really

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:21.800

looks like it comes in these kind of

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.580 
looks like it comes in these kind of
pouches<00:00:30.150> and<00:00:31.460> one<00:00:32.460> pouch<00:00:32.700> contains<00:00:33.329> one<00:00:34.230> strip

pouches and one pouch contains one strip

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.280 
pouches and one pouch contains one strip
like<00:00:34.800> this<00:00:34.829> and<00:00:35.399> you<00:00:36.270> have<00:00:36.480> them<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:36.960> bottom

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
like this and you have them the bottom

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.190 
like this and you have them the bottom
of<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:38.010> top<00:00:38.280> strip<00:00:38.670> which<00:00:38.940> is<00:00:39.059> longer<00:00:39.329> that

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
of the top strip which is longer that

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.110 
of the top strip which is longer that
goes<00:00:40.379> on<00:00:40.530> your<00:00:40.590> top<00:00:41.100> row<00:00:41.309> and<00:00:41.610> then<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:41.969> bottom

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
goes on your top row and then the bottom

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.869 
goes on your top row and then the bottom
is<00:00:42.570> a<00:00:42.660> bit<00:00:42.960> smaller<00:00:43.770> as<00:00:43.980> you<00:00:44.100> can<00:00:44.309> barely<00:00:44.670> see

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
is a bit smaller as you can barely see

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.850 
is a bit smaller as you can barely see
and<00:00:45.149> that<00:00:45.570> goes<00:00:45.719> on<00:00:45.840> your<00:00:45.899> bottom<00:00:46.200> rows<00:00:46.530> so

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
and that goes on your bottom rows so

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.100 
and that goes on your bottom rows so
basically<00:00:47.850> they<00:00:48.059> say<00:00:48.239> that<00:00:48.450> they're<00:00:48.629> that<00:00:49.050> you

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
basically they say that they're that you

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.630 
basically they say that they're that you
should<00:00:49.320> first<00:00:49.530> apply<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:49.980> bottom<00:00:50.430> than<00:00:50.610> the

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
should first apply the bottom than the

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.330 
should first apply the bottom than the
top<00:00:50.789> strip<00:00:51.329> I<00:00:51.570> didn't<00:00:52.230> really<00:00:52.379> pay<00:00:53.070> too<00:00:53.100> much

said that the truth is probably not as

connected<00:01:44.820> to<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.360> root<00:01:45.630> so<00:01:46.619> for<00:01:47.009> that<00:01:47.100> reason

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
connected to the root so for that reason

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.359 
connected to the root so for that reason
there<00:01:48.240> might<00:01:48.509> be<00:01:48.539> some<00:01:48.930> discoloration<00:01:49.619> now<00:01:50.100> I

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
there might be some discoloration now I

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.760 
there might be some discoloration now I
don't<00:01:51.329> know<00:01:51.689> if<00:01:51.869> those<00:01:52.049> were<00:01:52.259> his<00:01:52.350> exact<00:01:52.740> words

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
don't know if those were his exact words

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.270 
don't know if those were his exact words
or<00:01:53.310> if<00:01:53.429> I<00:01:53.549> if<00:01:54.119> my<00:01:54.270> memory<00:01:54.750> has<00:01:55.289> the<00:01:55.649> had

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
or if I if my memory has the had

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.789 
or if I if my memory has the had
recollected<00:01:56.970> that<00:01:57.000> information<00:01:57.810> well<00:01:58.350> but

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
recollected that information well but

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.440 
recollected that information well but
that's<00:01:59.310> what<00:01:59.549> I<00:01:59.579> kind<00:01:59.850> of<00:01:59.880> remember<00:02:00.179> what<00:02:00.299> he

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
that's what I kind of remember what he

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.080 
that's what I kind of remember what he
said<00:02:00.479> so<00:02:01.020> after<00:02:01.920> using<00:02:02.280> these<00:02:02.490> strips<00:02:02.850> I<00:02:03.030> do

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
said so after using these strips I do

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.059 
said so after using these strips I do
not<00:02:03.630> as<00:02:03.750> difference<00:02:04.140> between<00:02:04.409> this<00:02:04.560> two<00:02:04.890> it's

00:02:05.059 --> 00:02:05.069 
not as difference between this two it's

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:06.770 
not as difference between this two it's
like<00:02:05.250> it's<00:02:05.460> definitely<00:02:05.880> wider<00:02:06.090> but<00:02:06.390> you<00:02:06.509> still

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
like it's definitely wider but you still

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.389 
like it's definitely wider but you still
I<00:02:06.990> still<00:02:07.049> see<00:02:07.439> difference<00:02:07.890> between<00:02:08.280> this

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
I still see difference between this

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:09.830 
I still see difference between this
tooth<00:02:08.610> and<00:02:08.789> the<00:02:08.849> rest<00:02:09.030> of<00:02:09.149> my<00:02:09.269> team<00:02:09.330> but<00:02:09.690> it's

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
tooth and the rest of my team but it's

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.630 
tooth and the rest of my team but it's
not<00:02:09.899> bothersome<00:02:10.500> and<00:02:10.679> it's<00:02:11.160> definitely<00:02:11.489> I

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
not bothersome and it's definitely I

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.979 
not bothersome and it's definitely I
think<00:02:11.670> it's<00:02:12.030> actually<00:02:12.180> help<00:02:12.569> the<00:02:12.720> situation

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
works out for me so i was really

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.890 
works out for me so i was really
pleasantly<00:03:10.230> surprised<00:03:10.920> at<00:03:11.160> these<00:03:11.910> were<00:03:12.299> sure

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
pleasantly surprised at these were sure

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.410 
pleasantly surprised at these were sure
at<00:03:13.200> some<00:03:13.260> days<00:03:13.739> i<00:03:13.950> felt<00:03:14.190> a<00:03:14.250> little<00:03:14.420> sensitive

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
at some days i felt a little sensitive

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.920 
at some days i felt a little sensitive
and<00:03:15.870> you<00:03:16.709> know<00:03:16.859> but<00:03:17.370> I<00:03:17.639> really<00:03:18.630> think<00:03:18.810> that

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
and you know but I really think that

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.710 
and you know but I really think that
only<00:03:19.139> lasted<00:03:19.799> for<00:03:20.069> only<00:03:20.190> a<00:03:20.730> couple<00:03:20.910> of<00:03:21.359> hours

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
only lasted for only a couple of hours

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.390 
only lasted for only a couple of hours
and<00:03:22.019> then<00:03:22.079> it<00:03:22.380> was<00:03:22.470> already<00:03:22.590> gone<00:03:22.859> but<00:03:23.160> just

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
and then it was already gone but just

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.670 
and then it was already gone but just
for<00:03:23.489> my<00:03:23.880> own<00:03:24.090> sake<00:03:24.480> I<00:03:24.690> kind<00:03:24.989> of<00:03:25.109> took<00:03:25.260> a<00:03:25.319> break

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
for my own sake I kind of took a break

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.630 
for my own sake I kind of took a break
for<00:03:26.370> a<00:03:26.400> day<00:03:26.959> depending<00:03:27.959> on<00:03:28.139> this

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640 
for a day depending on this

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.460 
for a day depending on this
tivity<00:03:28.940> and<00:03:29.240> then<00:03:29.480> I<00:03:29.510> continued<00:03:30.110> again<00:03:30.260> the

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 
tivity and then I continued again the

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:33.130 
tivity and then I continued again the
next<00:03:30.590> day<00:03:30.790> so<00:03:31.790> as<00:03:32.000> I<00:03:32.120> said<00:03:32.180> during<00:03:32.630> the<00:03:32.780> process

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.140 
next day so as I said during the process

almost<00:03:37.730> a<00:03:38.000> month<00:03:38.209> later<00:03:38.480> from<00:03:39.170> my<00:03:39.319> previous

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
almost a month later from my previous

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.949 
almost a month later from my previous
video<00:03:40.100> that<00:03:40.370> I<00:03:40.790> when<00:03:41.060> I<00:03:41.090> started<00:03:41.510> these<00:03:41.660> Sam

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:41.959 
video that I when I started these Sam

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:44.440 
video that I when I started these Sam
strips<00:03:42.410> but<00:03:43.040> I<00:03:43.310> had<00:03:43.910> to<00:03:44.000> do<00:03:44.120> with<00:03:44.300> the<00:03:44.420> fact

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.450 
strips but I had to do with the fact

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:45.880 
strips but I had to do with the fact
that<00:03:44.690> I<00:03:44.810> was<00:03:44.900> sick<00:03:45.230> I<00:03:45.530> didn't<00:03:45.740> feel<00:03:45.860> like

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:45.890 
that I was sick I didn't feel like

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:48.760 
that I was sick I didn't feel like
putting<00:03:46.100> in<00:03:46.280> these<00:03:46.430> strips<00:03:47.560> sensitivity<00:03:48.560> wise

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:48.770 
putting in these strips sensitivity wise

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:51.370 
putting in these strips sensitivity wise
and<00:03:49.580> sometimes<00:03:50.120> yeah<00:03:50.450> I<00:03:50.510> was<00:03:50.690> just<00:03:50.810> plain<00:03:51.110> lazy

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:51.380 
and sometimes yeah I was just plain lazy

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:53.710 
and sometimes yeah I was just plain lazy
and<00:03:51.800> I<00:03:51.890> just<00:03:52.100> didn't<00:03:52.340> feel<00:03:52.459> like<00:03:52.490> and<00:03:52.940> then<00:03:53.060> but

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 
and I just didn't feel like and then but

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.920 
and I just didn't feel like and then but
you<00:03:54.260> know<00:03:54.380> despite<00:03:54.770> taking<00:03:55.340> breaks<00:03:55.910> between<00:03:56.300> a

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
you know despite taking breaks between a

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:59.380 
you know despite taking breaks between a
couple<00:03:57.739> of<00:03:57.800> days<00:03:57.950> and<00:03:58.340> like<00:03:58.790> I<00:03:59.000> think<00:03:59.270> my

00:03:59.380 --> 00:03:59.390 
couple of days and like I think my

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:01.420 
couple of days and like I think my
longest<00:03:59.690> break<00:03:59.870> was<00:04:00.170> maybe<00:04:00.470> three<00:04:00.770> days<00:04:01.040> I

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:01.430 
longest break was maybe three days I

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:04.270 
longest break was maybe three days I
still<00:04:01.940> see<00:04:02.450> a<00:04:02.480> huge<00:04:02.780> difference<00:04:02.840> and<00:04:03.290> I<00:04:03.650> don't

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 
still see a huge difference and I don't

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.360 
still see a huge difference and I don't
feel<00:04:04.489> like<00:04:04.700> my<00:04:04.910> teeth<00:04:05.270> suffered<00:04:05.860> or<00:04:06.860> it

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:07.370 
feel like my teeth suffered or it

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:09.550 
feel like my teeth suffered or it
hindered<00:04:08.000> the<00:04:08.330> the<00:04:08.630> actual<00:04:08.989> effect<00:04:09.260> of<00:04:09.440> the

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560 
hindered the the actual effect of the

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.740 
hindered the the actual effect of the
strip<00:04:09.890> so<00:04:09.920> I'm<00:04:10.580> really<00:04:10.880> happy<00:04:11.120> with<00:04:11.450> it<00:04:11.510> I'm

is actually he's actually a funny story

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:18.810

I<00:04:17.000> left<00:04:17.419> these<00:04:17.630> strips<00:04:17.900> and<00:04:18.049> I<00:04:18.109> was<00:04:18.230> outside

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:18.820 
I left these strips and I was outside

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:22.150 
I left these strips and I was outside
suntanning<00:04:19.820> and<00:04:20.209> I<00:04:20.900> don't<00:04:21.109> know<00:04:21.440> why<00:04:21.620> I<00:04:21.650> by

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:22.160 
suntanning and I don't know why I by

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.430 
suntanning and I don't know why I by
Matt<00:04:22.340> for<00:04:22.610> my<00:04:22.730> strips<00:04:23.060> in<00:04:23.240> for<00:04:24.050> 30<00:04:24.230> minutes

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440 
Matt for my strips in for 30 minutes

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.350 
Matt for my strips in for 30 minutes
while<00:04:24.680> I'm<00:04:24.860> just<00:04:25.100> relaxing<00:04:25.400> and<00:04:25.880> I<00:04:26.000> put<00:04:26.210> them

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360 
while I'm just relaxing and I put them

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.230 
while I'm just relaxing and I put them
in<00:04:26.510> and<00:04:26.810> I<00:04:27.770> basically<00:04:27.919> fell<00:04:28.310> asleep<00:04:28.640> and<00:04:28.850> I<00:04:29.030> had

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.240 
in and I basically fell asleep and I had

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.350 
in and I basically fell asleep and I had
these<00:04:29.450> things<00:04:29.660> in<00:04:29.930> for<00:04:30.350> an<00:04:30.650> hour<00:04:30.919> yes<00:04:31.910> a<00:04:32.150> tower

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 
these things in for an hour yes a tower

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.080 
these things in for an hour yes a tower
so<00:04:32.540> I<00:04:33.250> realized<00:04:34.250> when<00:04:34.370> I<00:04:34.400> was<00:04:34.490> taking<00:04:34.700> them<00:04:34.940> off

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.090 
so I realized when I was taking them off

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:37.150 
so I realized when I was taking them off
it<00:04:35.330> is<00:04:35.450> extremely<00:04:35.960> hard<00:04:36.320> to<00:04:36.440> pull<00:04:36.740> them<00:04:36.950> off

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:37.160 
it is extremely hard to pull them off

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:38.590 
it is extremely hard to pull them off
you<00:04:37.400> and<00:04:37.580> you<00:04:37.669> can<00:04:37.790> still<00:04:38.060> pull<00:04:38.240> him<00:04:38.390> off<00:04:38.479> his

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:38.600 
you and you can still pull him off his

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.060 
you and you can still pull him off his
not<00:04:38.720> like<00:04:38.870> they'll<00:04:38.990> tear<00:04:39.380> when<00:04:39.680> you<00:04:39.800> pull<00:04:39.979> them

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:40.070 
not like they'll tear when you pull them

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:41.620 
not like they'll tear when you pull them
up<00:04:40.250> you<00:04:40.700> just<00:04:40.910> feel<00:04:41.120> it<00:04:41.300> there<00:04:41.450> were<00:04:41.510> more

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:41.630 
up you just feel it there were more

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:44.830 
up you just feel it there were more
stuck<00:04:42.110> to<00:04:42.290> your<00:04:42.440> teeth<00:04:42.740> so<00:04:43.550> I<00:04:43.580> was<00:04:43.850> a<00:04:43.880> go<00:04:44.150> Monica

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:37.460 
really fine it was definitely worth it

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:39.580 
really fine it was definitely worth it
and<00:05:37.700> it<00:05:37.880> was<00:05:38.090> no<00:05:38.330> pain<00:05:38.720> it<00:05:39.020> was<00:05:39.140> just<00:05:39.350> a<00:05:39.380> little

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:39.590
