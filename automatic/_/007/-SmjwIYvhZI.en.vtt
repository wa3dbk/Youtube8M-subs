00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
just a little sign for some friends that

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.660 
just a little sign for some friends that
had<00:02:19.610> a<00:02:19.640> little<00:02:19.820> girl<00:02:20.030> today<00:02:21.610> this<00:02:22.610> little

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
had a little girl today this little

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.380 
had a little girl today this little
machine<00:02:22.970> works<00:02:23.450> pretty<00:02:23.930> well<00:02:25.390> registrations

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
machine works pretty well registrations

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:31.480 
machine works pretty well registrations
pretty<00:02:26.660> tight<00:02:29.200> and<00:02:30.200> I<00:02:30.830> think<00:02:31.010> that's<00:02:31.160> kind<00:02:31.460> of

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:31.490 
pretty tight and I think that's kind of

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:39.690 
pretty tight and I think that's kind of
good<00:02:31.670> kind<00:02:32.090> of<00:02:32.180> cool

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.170 

after<00:02:40.450> the<00:02:40.540> stain<00:02:41.400> then<00:02:42.400> the<00:02:42.790> cut<00:02:43.000> was<00:02:43.150> made

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
after the stain then the cut was made

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.820 
after the stain then the cut was made
and<00:02:43.720> then<00:02:44.500> just<00:02:44.770> a<00:02:44.860> little<00:02:44.980> furniture<00:02:45.700> polish

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
and then just a little furniture polish

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:56.860 
and then just a little furniture polish
was<00:02:47.830> rubbed<00:02:48.099> in<00:02:49.560> thanks<00:02:50.560> for<00:02:50.650> watching

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.789 

a<00:02:56.980> lot<00:02:57.980> of<00:02:58.010> dust<00:02:58.370> in<00:02:58.610> there<00:02:59.150> I<00:02:59.650> should<00:03:00.650> probably

00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:00.799 
a lot of dust in there I should probably

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:03.430 
a lot of dust in there I should probably
replace<00:03:01.250> that<00:03:01.549> bit<00:03:01.970> also<00:03:02.480> it<00:03:02.720> did<00:03:02.840> okay<00:03:03.170> here

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
replace that bit also it did okay here

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:04.509 
replace that bit also it did okay here
but<00:03:03.709> I<00:03:03.739> think<00:03:03.890> it's<00:03:04.069> getting<00:03:04.159> a<00:03:04.280> little<00:03:04.340> bit

00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:04.519 
but I think it's getting a little bit

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:07.240 
but I think it's getting a little bit
tired<00:03:04.730> in<00:03:05.269> any<00:03:05.450> event<00:03:05.720> as<00:03:06.470> mentioned<00:03:06.980> before

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
tired in any event as mentioned before

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:08.830 
tired in any event as mentioned before
this<00:03:07.400> was<00:03:07.580> about<00:03:07.879> the<00:03:08.090> deepest<00:03:08.390> cut<00:03:08.599> that<00:03:08.750> I've

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
this was about the deepest cut that I've

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.869 
this was about the deepest cut that I've
done<00:03:09.019> the<00:03:09.200> biggest<00:03:09.379> letters<00:03:09.769> and<00:03:10.069> it<00:03:10.670> has

00:03:10.869 --> 00:03:10.879 
done the biggest letters and it has

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:15.309 
done the biggest letters and it has
expected<00:03:11.599> blue<00:03:11.959> a<00:03:11.989> lot<00:03:12.319> of<00:03:12.590> dust<00:03:12.769> in<00:03:12.980> there<00:03:14.319> but

00:03:15.309 --> 00:03:15.319 
expected blue a lot of dust in there but

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:18.330 
expected blue a lot of dust in there but
the<00:03:15.440> enclosure<00:03:15.680> kept<00:03:16.129> it<00:03:16.280> pretty<00:03:16.459> much<00:03:17.170> inside

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
the enclosure kept it pretty much inside

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.130 
the enclosure kept it pretty much inside
so<00:03:19.340> need<00:03:19.760> to<00:03:19.790> pull<00:03:20.000> this<00:03:20.150> out<00:03:20.329> clean<00:03:20.659> it<00:03:20.750> up<00:03:20.900> and

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
so need to pull this out clean it up and

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.850 
so need to pull this out clean it up and
I<00:03:21.890> think<00:03:22.129> I<00:03:22.250> might<00:03:22.430> take<00:03:22.730> this<00:03:22.940> off<00:03:23.180> and<00:03:23.860> use

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:24.860 
I think I might take this off and use

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:26.770 
I think I might take this off and use
some<00:03:25.069> spray<00:03:25.340> paint<00:03:25.370> but<00:03:25.879> I'm<00:03:26.329> still<00:03:26.510> thinking

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
some spray paint but I'm still thinking

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:29.830 
some spray paint but I'm still thinking
about<00:03:26.840> that<00:03:27.819> so<00:03:28.819> everything<00:03:29.269> has<00:03:29.390> been<00:03:29.569> taped

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
about that so everything has been taped

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.170 
about that so everything has been taped
off<00:03:30.400> very<00:03:31.400> painstakingly<00:03:32.319> gone<00:03:33.319> over<00:03:33.739> and

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
off very painstakingly gone over and

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:38.410 
off very painstakingly gone over and
individual<00:03:35.180> pieces<00:03:35.420> of<00:03:35.569> tape<00:03:37.180> going<00:03:38.180> around

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:38.420 
individual pieces of tape going around

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.649 
individual pieces of tape going around
all<00:03:38.569> the<00:03:38.720> curves<00:03:39.019> and<00:03:39.410> the<00:03:39.500> angles<00:03:40.420> I'm<00:03:41.420> gonna

00:03:41.649 --> 00:03:41.659 
all the curves and the angles I'm gonna

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:46.390 
all the curves and the angles I'm gonna
leave<00:03:41.930> the<00:03:42.260> sides<00:03:42.560> open<00:03:43.959> and<00:03:45.250> just<00:03:46.250> the

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 
leave the sides open and just the

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.479 
leave the sides open and just the
letters<00:03:46.730> we're<00:03:47.209> gonna<00:03:47.329> make<00:03:47.569> those<00:03:47.840> gold<00:03:48.489> so
