00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:05.700
 hello welcome to a new video on 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:09.929
 this time we are going to make some 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:12.630
 fine crafts that we're going to do it 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.549
 it would be about some dragon ball dolls 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.820
 worth characters there are several now you 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:20.609
 I will show and we will do them in format 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.140
 civil is to say the tiny body and the 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:26.000
 big head 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.000
 I already have one printed here 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.600
 I'm going to wet the turn it would be 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:31.730
 butt 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:35.450
 and well this is quite simple 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:36.950
 I will teach the kraft paper theme to see 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.320
 the most advanced levels if you want 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:41.570
 do something faster and easier you can 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:46.530
 do this to find these are 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:48.750
 templates you search in google 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.670
 dragon ball paper dolls and os 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.890
 will appear in a lot I recommend you 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.989
 because there are various ways that what 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.329
 do you start with the theme of 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.740
 the letters you see that carry some letters 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:03.470
 in the eyelashes 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:06.410
 well this will make the assembly much easier 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:08.900
 we would start by the feet that would be this 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:10.630
 from here here basically what you have 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:15.280
 what to do 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:20.470
 scissors and bar glue then 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:22.390
 we would cut through the area here you see 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:26.010
 that here is a blank hairline this 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:28.350
 we will remember the hairline with a text 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:30.530
 Very slowly it with something low for 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:34.440
 Do not scratch the table or what you have underneath 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:38.250
 and then fold and we'll play the part of here and 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:40.010
 here here what are the lines are you in 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.320
 black bends and masters and lashes 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:45.420
 then fit and mash the tab 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.000
 inside the time where we had done the 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.000
 we will do it and there will be a 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.010
 small square that will be the legs 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:57.030
 We would continue so on by 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:59.280
 example now with the body we have it 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.500
 here the body you see that there are some 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.560
 dashes these appointments or we will have them 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.170
 which cut goes like this to introduce 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:10.130
 then the arms 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:12.860
 is the same here we will cut here in 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:17.560
 what white we will make cuts also for 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.560
 enter the tabs here 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:23.620
 and the up here we see also two 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:26.860
 lines that we will also cut to 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:30.220
 fit the part here below is worth 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:34.660
 it would be this part of here we see that it has 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:37.930
 a number and another from here and would be the d 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:40.720
 and the c vale indicates it very very well there 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.350
 some templates that do not have the 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.000
 letters 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:45.630
 then it makes a bit more difficult if not 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.460
 you have done none we would follow 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:51.400
 introducing the arms that would be 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:54.340
 these here the same when you see a 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.940
 white hairline you remember here in the 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.490
 part of here 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.890
 here that you see a double line cut out 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:04.280
 also because they facilitate the assembly 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:06.800
 from the hands we would have the other hand 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:09.680
 here that would be exactly like the 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:11.540
 another is explained and then the head 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.960
 the head is more of the same 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:17.060
 we cut and open tabs these 

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:19.220
 from here we will also open them because 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:21.740
 these tabs will fit what is the 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:24.080
 torso of the character and then as 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:28.690
 complement we have here what is the 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:28.690
 owl head debut 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:35.070
 if we do not find any hole like that 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.930
 that have marked us we can paste 

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:39.810
 in the part of here back when 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:42.660
 double the character we paste it by 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:44.550
 back and get up well I have done 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:47.820
 sample ones to show you how it is 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:49.710
 finishing and good that as they go 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:51.540
 doing more then yes updating the 

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:54.190
 collection of dolls of these 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:56.050
 goat format 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:58.420
 I'm here at the moment I'm not going to do it 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:00.310
 to make the video more short and more 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:03.330
 enjoyable 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.330
 we have here 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:09.420
 to freezer with her legs and the 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:13.620
 body and the biggest head 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:18.510
 and then he has his tail as a complement 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:22.140
 they are very quick to make and facilitate 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:24.990
 10 15 minutes you can do one here 

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:28.280
 we have bulman at the beginning that is going to 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.280
 be to your watch and all 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:36.100
 good benefit that has fallen for the 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:38.990
 Details of the panties are pretty 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:41.870
 they have enough detail these dolls and 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:44.840
 they're pretty funny and then 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:47.800
 I have old age here is in the saga of 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:50.770
 they have consumed super hair 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:53.729
 and this from here back we can paint 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:53.729
 the black if you want 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:05:00.310
 and what else do we have here in fact 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:02.910
 I've been doing a few days 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:02.910
 here we have 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:11.960
 tomorrow this does not leave my name now 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:11.960
 such a table with its fangs 

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:16.720
 and as a complement it takes the layer 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:25.849
 we can not be there and now I'm going to 

00:05:20.999 --> 00:05:29.340
 look for another one that is congenital that is goal 

00:05:25.849 --> 00:05:31.920
 as we do not have goku here with faces and 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:34.800
 of pissed off 

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:36.630
 with its details of the drops the suit 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:40.130
 same here we can paint in black 

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:40.130
 to make it look better 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:48.570
 and well, this would be everything as you see 

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:50.220
 it's short the video is easy to do not 

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:51.990
 none of the templates has mystery 

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:54.060
 you will find without any problem and if 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:56.760
 you want some of this child for 

00:05:54.060 --> 00:06:00.150
 Here you ask me what I give you 

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:03.330
 and if I'm doing more then follow 

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:07.260
 expanding the sample of characters 

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:12.080
 but you will find ya I tell you goku in 

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:12.080
 super saiyan vegeta with the other suit 

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:16.810
 the guineo command 

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:19.300
 if you already what you are looking for some character 

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:21.040
 that you can not find and what you want to do 

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:23.650
 Well, you tell me and if I have it 

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:26.080
