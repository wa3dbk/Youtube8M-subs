00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:08.649
 breaking 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:08.649
 tender and summers 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:15.799
 a phrase a word a smile a 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:18.290
 song a movie place or anecdote 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:20.210
 They will be enough reason to remind you 

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:22.099
 the rest of my life my heart will 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:24.349
 I used to be without you more, you do not forget 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:26.930
 small details unforgettable moments 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:28.640
 bad days and other good happy ones or 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:31.189
 unbearable does not matter if it is not 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.800
 relationship almost did not work we remain 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:35.300
 together and that was what mattered 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.340
 caprices and tantrums of this type so 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.840
 jealous that I loved you like a man you 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.640
 loved like your husband 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.160
 the couple that occupies our site 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.080
 preferred the date that tells me that it would be 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.300
 another month fulfilled this routine that I 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.190
 says that without you I'm bored it seems 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.820
 that the world tries to remind me that you 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:51.770
 has been 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.840
 the letter that I found when I was looking for 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:56.240
 another thing but I tripped up with her 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:58.460
 mysterious way there is always a reason 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:00.050
 that brings me back to the past and that tells me 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.390
 that here you are in case I had 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:04.309
 forgotten winters summers that go and 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.049
 they come in vain the rain I erase your 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:08.119
 fingerprints but I keep looking for you 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:10.310
 apparently intact feelings 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:12.560
 water, I forgot to forget you and 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.630
 I'm thinking about saying memories 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.189
 everything except knowing that forgotten 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.590
 and forget that it is the best thing that has 

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:20.840
 past the doorbell of my cel announcing 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.390
 a call waiting for you I'm at 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.490
 chop me I do not have any of this 2 - say 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.340
 which it is what I hope and I need you know me 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:30.229
 You took away 25 minutes tucked admire your 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.630
 way to forget me with it is written 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:34.909
 I would like to remain smiling but not 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.100
 I am you with what ease while you are 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:39.530
 with indifference that is in the date I 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.539
 I can not beat your 6 jacks winters and 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.429
 summers every time they spend more sad and 

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:45.679
 Even if you're not with me, I remember you 

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:47.630
 how were you vermon to escape this 

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:49.819
 sadness and do not think about sleep and 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.470
 wake up I would like to run to look for you 

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:53.390
 there is no time or distance that of me 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.970
 they can erase more than pass the 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:58.009
 years and this Mars is located sometimes I 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:00.049
 I wonder where you'll be and who not 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:02.209
 matter if it's with another one I just hope that 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:04.399
 you're fine I'm still standing here and 

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:06.409
 although sometimes he slipped you know that always 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:08.119
 looked for the good side of the bad is that 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:10.369
 I am one of those who cry alone and 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.650
 slowly though sometimes I want to scream 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:14.810
 I need you no matter how long the 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.730
 I keep remembering time because 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.660
 wherever I go your memories will 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.550
 they call though 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.920
 I will continue to be waiting for you 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:24.380
 it's never muscle that people do 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.330
 when they love winters summers that go and 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:28.070
 they come in vain the bored rain your 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.290
 fingerprints but I keep looking for you 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:32.360
 intact feelings I will love you I love you and 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.880
 I love you so I forgot to forget you and for 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:37.100
 that I'm thinking you winters summers 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.020
 that come and go in vain the rain I erase 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.240
 your dreams but I keep looking for you 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:43.340
 intact feelings I will love you I loved you and 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:45.890
 of both I forgot to forget you and for 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.750
 I'm thinking of you, I remember everything 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.520
 less to know than forgotten and because 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.700
 forget you if you are the best thing that has 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.700
 past
