00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.410
 they do not leave us changes 

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:06.410
 the best architects in mexico have brought us projects 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:10.259
 here you can see them in the museum 

00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:13.889
 some of them to be the tower as a pyramid to change the facade to 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.809
 give him another flaw 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.809
 and we receive them with pleasure because 

00:00:19.669 --> 00:00:22.509
 they show us that they are still interested in the tower 

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:24.989
 there is no more that the sharks would not let us change 

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:27.989
 none of the elements and colors of the facade 

00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:31.739
 because it is already considered as something of the most representative 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.580
 of the 20 th or 100 th century holidays 56 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.640
 since the tower was known 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.530
 science designs thinking of a public viewpoint up 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.600
 it is worrisome to make it difficult at that highest moment in Latin America 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.809
 and a building the first in a seismic zone with these characteristics 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:00.530
 everything is the lookout operates from the day the tower was inaugurated an average 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:01.660
 daily 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.269
 during the past year you can practically a thousand daily visitors 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.810
 very close to the thousand daily visitors 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.460
 wounded and we have two very high days like in holy week fe the days of 3 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.330
 thousand 600 visitors 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.380
 You could be very low that can reach 300 350 visitors 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.410
 we visit 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:24.550
 the individual 80% 70% of visitors are national 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.180
 the rest are foreigners 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.580
 and of the national people who visit us for the most part are visitors of 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:32.750
 provinces 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.350
 what good to see the city 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.680
 and I think it's a place that is a must see because it allows us to see 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.140
 the most beautiful area the city in this case historic center 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.580
 from a different perspective from another or an angle of view in one place 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:47.470
 very comfortable for sure 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.900
 and we can therefore really green as are the streets 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:52.230
 after the polls that 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:55.250
 that can be seen from here I think it's a building that has an angel 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.000
 especially among 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.620
 within the Mexicans is a building that 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:02.890
 all before a certain affection on cloth people older the people that 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:06.360
 tusk is contemporary to the tower 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.759
 the issues in common building as a precursor to 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:12.989
 from technology in mexico 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:15.129
 very beautiful are enjoyed 

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:18.920
 the work here in the tall buildings have marked the profile of the city 

00:02:20.419 --> 00:02:24.239
 pa and cities that without high buildings would not have the personality that has 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:28.989
 and they also come out 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:32.229
 the most efficient way to get power 

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:34.459
 more offices 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:36.239
 of services 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:37.649
 in a land 

00:02:37.649 --> 00:02:40.599
 and when the city is growing so much 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:43.769
 it is impossible for them to grow horizontally 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:45.669
 and of necessity it has to be like that
