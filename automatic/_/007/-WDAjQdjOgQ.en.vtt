 tutorial 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:44.470
 what we need is to have our 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.470
 device updated to version 7 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:49.840
 point 1.2 to avoid problems in 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:53.050
 this case we are going to do this tutorial 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:54.460
 with a mac and with an ipad2 however 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.680
 the procedure in windows download is 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.810
 exactly the same 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:01.060
 let's go to the ipad 2 screen and 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:02.230
 let's go to settings to check if 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:03.220
 we have the most recent version of 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:07.210
 device 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:09.790
 we can go to settings and generate a 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:12.370
 software update and we see that in 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:14.290
 my case my device is there 7.1 point 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:17.080

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:19.180
 for the update to have 7.1 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.250
 points is compatible there is no 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.080
 problem but it is better to have it in 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.990
 the latest version meanwhile 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:28.330
 we can start to download the 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.190

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:41.590
 camera let's go to mac because in this 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.460

 any jailbreak you have to back up 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.900
 our data we will go to our 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:56.450
 device here on itunes and we're going to 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:58.340
 make a copy this is done nothing by 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.440
 for security purposes in case it is 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.550
 spoil the boiling process and 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.190
 we have to restore our 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:07.330
 device without having to stop all the 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:07.330
 information that we have valuable 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:12.830
 I've already done it will ask if 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:15.230
 we want to open this item we are going to give it 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:19.159
 the time there is no problem 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:22.760
 and here we have half the boil 

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:24.500
 we have what bread is 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.709
 and it's not saying it's a device 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.480
 to johnson to these two version 7.1 points 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:31.400
 two 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.900
 but before you start doing the 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.970
 Herb tool let's do 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.150
 a series of steps we are going to give you the 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.159
 king jr make 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.640
 and it tells us that we're going to have to go to 

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:45.910
 settings 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:49.210
 to adjustments we're going to go to day time or 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:51.319
 date and time here and disable the 

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:55.099
 automatic adjustment 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:59.930
 let's give it here on the date and we're going to 

00:02:55.099 --> 00:03:02.650
 change it to blue to June 6 and the 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.650
 June 2 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:07.600
 the time does not matter while it does not pass 

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:11.200
 12 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:13.810
 it does not matter we're going to give you cancel and 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.310
 she will be ready to serve as 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.500
 you can see on the screen 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:20.290
 main computer is 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.820
 starting from being the yerbatero this 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.310
 it takes a little time so do 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:27.970
 a little patient and we go back when 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:29.830
 the device is ready 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.990
 after a while to appear the 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:34.980
 panguso application of our rich and 

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:34.980
 several is this 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:40.540
 let's give it we're going to open it for 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:41.890
 continue with the installation and new 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:45.780
 question that we finally want 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:45.780
 install serious let's continue 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.950
 and for the moment we're going to leave it like this 

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:53.230
 let's touch the device or we 're going 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:55.030
 to move the device was already 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.540
 starting no more you have to wait for 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:57.540
 more minutes 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:14.049
 already last when you are restarting 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:15.790
 the payment icon appears at the moment 

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:18.000
 is upside down because I can not afford the 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:18.000
 ipad 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:23.300
 now let's unlock it 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:31.410
 and how can they realize that at 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:33.960
 beginning it seemed an empty screen without 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:35.190
 applications and nothing what installed without 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.320
 But that was a little to 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:39.330
 react again the ipad so that 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:41.580
 return to its original state and appear 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:44.670
 some applications from adjustments again 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:46.800
 is already well or has just been clarified or 

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:49.110
 applications if we are well install 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.630
 however here we already have and for 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:54.660
 it 7 in case it has not worked 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:56.190
 your closing process for some reason what 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:58.560
 more important that you have to have in 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:00.960
 account is one have not have blocked 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:04.320

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:06.030
 activate the fingers of June 3 you have to 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:07.070
 activate the mode well to be boiled in 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:10.250
 if it does not work 

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:10.250
 let's use 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:14.190
 and as always when installing 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:16.260

 the device and it restarted 

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:27.260
 let's block it and we go for a 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.260
 box 

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:32.750
 it is likely that I finished loading and here 

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:36.860
