00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:08.010
 Hello, we are here, commenting for 

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:10.019
 all of you a video tutorial about 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.700
 tips to improve your connection 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:15.280
 in ps3 in my case 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.770
 and for the internet and for what you get 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.800
 from there 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:23.910
 good advice on the play menu 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:28.680
 friends have less than 50 less than 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:31.140
 limit that gives you greater connection and you will go 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.850
 a little better the play the messages of 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.210
 invitations and all that delete it always 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.600
 all delete them because that makes you 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.359
 go slower of the system 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.940
 also the cartoons that this one 

00:00:41.359 --> 00:00:46.550
 they come out in the demos in some demos or in 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.379
 some games that too 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.660
 also lowers us a few or 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:52.460
 Let's stay download or play them 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:55.950
 and delete them 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:58.640
 they are worth the ps3 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:01.110
 those are some small tips 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:04.110
 with the router 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:08.130
 with the router it is best to have it 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:10.500
 connected by cable to the ps3 or the xbox 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.140
 what you have good the team I think 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.730
 it goes by cable it seems good to connect 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.280
 with a cable and they will reach all the 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:20.070
 direct connection to the ps3 and it's getting to 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:24.140
 the best possible 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.140
 if you have if you do not have 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:30.420
 what is your name 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:30.420
 the connector ah 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:37.649
 to the phone to the line in your 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.039
 room and you can not plug it in 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:40.039
 cable 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:47.509
 the router can not have it near 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:49.819
 What I recommend is to put play 3 in 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:53.299
 the room where you have placed the 

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:55.159
 router or bad as close as possible or the 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:57.140
 router put it a little higher too 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:02:00.170
 it's a good idea because you get better 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:02.000
 connection and good 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.619
 those who have the same problem as 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.239
 I have that you have the trio of 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:10.729
 telephone that is the router is coupled 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:13.970
 to this with a cable to go to the 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:16.520
 tele then those low as 20 per 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:19.760
 hundred of the connection so what I do 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:21.890
 I am when I do not watch TV and I go to 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.530
 play play disconnected the cable this 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:28.300
 what comes to you here 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.300
 on the router he disconnected 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:35.980
 and that goes up 20% 20% that takes it away 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:39.230
 you upload it on the play and that goes 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.710
 phenomenal is what better what better 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:44.210
 comes out 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:44.210
 well let's see 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:52.569
 to play 3 I've already said all good to the 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.580
 that you have fiber optics is going to give you 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:57.879
 they also improved the connection you are going 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:03:00.790
 I always tell you this for the 

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:04.769
 that we have little connection as I the nas 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:06.879
 open is achieved I got it with 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:09.700
 when they uploaded me the connection of a 

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:14.140
 mega that had a mega only me the 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:16.150
 they went up to me I hired 10 and they get me 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.489
 four and a half and when I take school 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.890
 they take me six with that you already have the 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:23.440
 more open you leave only to me I get 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:26.170
 just at least and well that's for 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:30.489
 be host 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:33.430
 rarely is and that will better the 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:35.230
 four stripes are not yet achieved with 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.260
 this connection no four kings do not go to 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.769
 to have 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.769
 and 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:44.790
 and I recommend that you join if you live 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:47.180
 in a town like me and we get the 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.180
 optical fiber 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:53.530
 orange because movistar is a scammer 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:56.050
 that you shit hours oil flights get 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:58.840
 to most connection that's my 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:00.580
 recommendation for all of you because 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.980
 I will change in nothing because they are 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:06.400
 pulling a pass 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:10.900
 and good a little more to say these are 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:12.159
 my advice for you to improve 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.780
 your connection I hope that I have 

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:18.040
