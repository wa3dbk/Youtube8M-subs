00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:09.860
 good chained the chorded strings that's 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.900
 more difficult than open agreements 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:14.360
 but basic it's pretty much the same 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:16.100
 principle for working them you take 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.960
 two chords bar is different or a 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.760
 bar agreement and an open deal and you 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.830
 chained slowly playing a 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.660
 each time for example a major fact 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:26.110
 1 the minor 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:28.430
 and you are constantly trying to have 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:30.320
 the fingers that will make the way the 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:32.870
 shortest possible to have a maximum 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:35.270
 of movement savings in fact all 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.920
 the advice I gave for 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.600
 open agreements applies to agreements 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.070
 barred it's just harder but it 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.660
 is working the same way there is 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.980
 however two three little things that 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.379
 we can note in relation to the agreements 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.840
 barred that will complicate things and 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:50.269
 which one must be aware of first 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.680
 compared to open agreements we have very 

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:53.750
 very few pivoting fingers in the 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.610
 strings of chords crossed out it's 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.989
 relatively rare and me tech for 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.730
 evolan quote that two or three who have 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:00.530
 ags of pivotal fingers so if you 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.059
 have worked the agreements open the 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.890
 open body requests you have 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:05.990
 learned what are the pivot audois you 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.640
 have learned to use them to 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.860
 to chain and to make your life easier 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.780
 and there you do not have them so that's 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.060
 one of the things that breaks that complicates 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.710
 all this another chance also of which we have 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.670
 spoken for open chords this was the 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.289
 advice that I had given you 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.050
 to learn to tackle all beautiful dunks 

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:23.030
 or try to make the deal up in 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:24.560
 party and plates and all of a sudden it 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.390
 helps you a lot for 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.069
 chord sequences open for a 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.569
 agreement seemed extremely difficult 

00:01:28.069 --> 00:01:31.160
 finally it's extremely it's a lot 

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:33.500
 harder to put your fingers in 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:35.599
 the air and to flatten everything at once 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.830
 we're not going to do exactly the same 

00:01:35.599 --> 00:01:39.020
 thing for low raymond has agreements 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:41.000
 rather split them into two phases if we 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.640
 wants on one side the bar and on the other 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.640
 side the fingers in the air that leans 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.289
 suddenly you can do it either 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.330
 starting with the bar and then with the 

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:53.179
 other fingers be the audois then the 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:54.800
 bar is basically we're going over 

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:56.690
 try to make all the agreement in one go 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.360
 we will cut it in two steps 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:00.560
 separate 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:03.080
 outside of that he's also 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.310
 anticipation that is done very 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.390
 different in the term warrants 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.099
 barred body in relation to the document 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.710
 okay open since we had 

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:11.490
 learned in the novels open agreement 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:11.490
 to lift your fingers 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.660
 and to leave the bodies of those born to 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.770
 vacuum between two chords to 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.690
 the web a little bit more 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.520
 melodic and more pleasant to the ear 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.980
 this chords bar and that will be done of 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:24.650
 very different way and we'll talk about it 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.880
 in the fourth part devoted to 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.550
 this technique 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.840
 so apart from that the rest is the 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:31.100
 same thing as I say them it's 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.600
 works the same way begins 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.890
 slowly with two chords 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.340
 ate of them then three and then 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.260
 four 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.330
 we accelerate little by little and we try 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.490
 always aim for maximum savings 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.800
 of movement in order to get there the best 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:44.030
 possible 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.990
 so now that I told you everything 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.800
 that and that I reminded you of his 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:47.060
 basic advice 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.790
 we will go to the second part 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.110
 to see quite specific cases that 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.670
 concerns barred tuning dwellings 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.720
 to other agreements stranded ya 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:54.470
 things that will greatly benefit you 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.750
 Make life easier 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.310
 if you become aware of it then we will 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.900
 see this together and before you can 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.610
 always join us on facebook.com 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:05.540
 buy 4 to guitar and twitter.com 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:07.310
 loud acoustic slashtags and well we 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:11.150
 simply by plating the 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:12.740
 first agreement we will take off slightly 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.720
 of the fingers we will actually release the 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:15.200
 pressure we do not want to take off 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.880
 some ropes 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.410
 we want to keep in touch with 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:21.220
 strings that's very important 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:21.220
 you will see why
