Saddam Hussein in his base or something

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.139 
Saddam Hussein in his base or something
that<00:00:42.690> he<00:00:42.750> doesn't<00:00:42.989> want<00:00:43.110> you<00:00:43.170> guys<00:00:43.320> at<00:00:43.530> sea<00:00:43.739> and

00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:44.149 
that he doesn't want you guys at sea and

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:46.130 
that he doesn't want you guys at sea and
alright<00:00:45.149> so<00:00:45.360> he's<00:00:45.480> holding<00:00:45.600> diamond<00:00:46.020> he's

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
alright so he's holding diamond he's

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.330 
alright so he's holding diamond he's
pulling<00:00:46.410> out<00:00:46.469> his<00:00:46.590> diamond<00:00:46.950> man

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
pulling out his diamond man

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.160 
pulling out his diamond man
so<00:00:47.879> he's<00:00:48.059> going<00:00:48.270> to<00:00:48.329> be<00:00:48.420> using<00:00:48.570> cheat<00:00:48.989> engine

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
so he's going to be using cheat engine

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.389 
so he's going to be using cheat engine
is<00:00:49.590> what<00:00:49.920> it<00:00:49.980> looks<00:00:50.129> like<00:00:50.309> yep<00:00:50.700> and<00:00:52.280> what's<00:00:53.280> he

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
is what it looks like yep and what's he

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.240 
is what it looks like yep and what's he
doing<00:00:53.760> here<00:00:54.469> so<00:00:55.469> he's<00:00:55.559> deleting<00:00:55.949> what<00:00:56.070> he's

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
doing here so he's deleting what he's

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.220 
doing here so he's deleting what he's
previously<00:00:56.460> done<00:00:56.969> which<00:00:57.600> I'm<00:00:57.719> guessing<00:00:57.899> is

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
previously done which I'm guessing is

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:07.620 
previously done which I'm guessing is
his<00:00:58.949> diamond<00:00:59.699> stash<00:00:59.969> from<00:01:00.300> for

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:07.630 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.940 

so<00:01:08.170> he's<00:01:08.320> got<00:01:08.470> a<00:01:08.500> cheat<00:01:08.830> engine<00:01:08.950> back<00:01:09.310> open

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
so he's got a cheat engine back open

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.539 
so he's got a cheat engine back open
Hannon<00:01:11.950> what's<00:01:12.670> this<00:01:12.880> all<00:01:13.180> right<00:01:13.330> this<00:01:13.659> is<00:01:13.840> the

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
Hannon what's this all right this is the

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.570 
Hannon what's this all right this is the
guess<00:01:15.549> what<00:01:15.729> he<00:01:15.850> has<00:01:16.000> open<00:01:16.450> right<00:01:16.840> now<00:01:17.580> it's

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:18.580 
guess what he has open right now it's

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.490 
guess what he has open right now it's
according<00:01:18.940> to<00:01:19.000> become<00:01:19.330> Stasia<00:01:19.659> like<00:01:19.960> me<00:01:20.140> and

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:20.500 
according to become Stasia like me and

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.410 
according to become Stasia like me and
you<00:01:20.619> see<00:01:20.950> he's<00:01:21.070> got<00:01:21.100> that<00:01:21.580> minecraft<00:01:21.790> game<00:01:22.270> and

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
you see he's got that minecraft game and

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:23.719 
you see he's got that minecraft game and
he's<00:01:22.570> got<00:01:22.720> open<00:01:22.960> right<00:01:23.110> now

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
he's got open right now

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.850 
he's got open right now
and<00:01:24.729> I<00:01:24.970> think<00:01:25.360> what<00:01:26.170> this<00:01:26.320> does<00:01:26.380> is<00:01:26.740> the

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:26.860 
and I think what this does is the

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.100 
and I think what this does is the
anything<00:01:27.369> with<00:01:27.610> the<00:01:27.729> value<00:01:28.090> of<00:01:28.180> four<00:01:28.539> or<00:01:28.869> maybe

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.110 
anything with the value of four or maybe

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:30.420 
anything with the value of four or maybe
it's<00:01:29.320> anything<00:01:29.680> that's<00:01:29.860> in<00:01:29.979> his<00:01:30.100> inventory

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:30.430 
it's anything that's in his inventory

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:37.200 
it's anything that's in his inventory
right<00:01:31.180> now<00:01:34.979> I'm<00:01:35.979> going<00:01:36.250> to<00:01:36.340> guess<00:01:36.490> that<00:01:36.520> it's

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.210 
right now I'm going to guess that it's

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.050 
right now I'm going to guess that it's
showing<00:01:38.110> all<00:01:38.200> the<00:01:38.350> items<00:01:39.250> in<00:01:39.430> game<00:01:39.670> that<00:01:39.880> have

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 
showing all the items in game that have

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.260 
showing all the items in game that have
a<00:01:40.090> value<00:01:40.630> of<00:01:40.659> four<00:01:41.020> for<00:01:41.229> him<00:01:41.380> so<00:01:42.310> he<00:01:42.640> drops<00:01:42.940> one

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
a value of four for him so he drops one

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.450 
a value of four for him so he drops one
he's<00:01:43.720> like<00:01:43.869> shit<00:01:44.170> too<00:01:44.440> many<00:01:44.590> items<00:01:44.800> so<00:01:45.250> he<00:01:45.369> goes

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
he's like shit too many items so he goes

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.620 
he's like shit too many items so he goes
head<00:01:45.759> types<00:01:46.690> n3<00:01:47.289> and<00:01:48.130> there<00:01:49.030> there's<00:01:49.450> his
