00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
boiling crab so the boiling crab is

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.609 
boiling crab so the boiling crab is
basically<00:00:18.390> a<00:00:18.510> place<00:00:18.750> where<00:00:19.080> you<00:00:19.260> could<00:00:19.439> buy

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
basically a place where you could buy

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.279 
basically a place where you could buy
like<00:00:20.130> seafood<00:00:20.400> by<00:00:20.760> the<00:00:20.820> pound
