00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
connect to real-time vehicle data that's

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:10.190 
connect to real-time vehicle data that's
really<00:00:09.300> open-ended

I<00:00:10.230> mean<00:00:10.469> we've<00:00:10.620> designed<00:00:11.400> the<00:00:11.610> platform<00:00:12.090> such

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
I mean we've designed the platform such

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.049 
I mean we've designed the platform such
that<00:00:12.630> people<00:00:12.780> have<00:00:13.769> real-time<00:00:14.250> access<00:00:14.519> to<00:00:14.730> the

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
that people have real-time access to the

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:16.340 
that people have real-time access to the
vehicle<00:00:15.420> data<00:00:15.630> and<00:00:15.870> then<00:00:15.990> they<00:00:16.080> can<00:00:16.230> do

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
vehicle data and then they can do

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:17.599 
vehicle data and then they can do
whatever<00:00:16.560> they<00:00:16.800> want<00:00:16.830> with<00:00:17.070> that<00:00:17.250> data

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
whatever they want with that data

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.490 
whatever they want with that data
whether<00:00:18.150> it<00:00:18.359> be<00:00:18.480> windshield<00:00:18.990> wiper<00:00:19.140> blade

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
whether it be windshield wiper blade

to are the doors open or closed you can

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.349 
to are the doors open or closed you can
even<00:00:25.320> do<00:00:25.529> Hardware<00:00:26.070> extensions<00:00:26.670> so<00:00:27.119> you<00:00:27.210> could

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
even do Hardware extensions so you could

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.230 
even do Hardware extensions so you could
take<00:00:27.539> the<00:00:28.199> vehicle<00:00:28.650> data<00:00:28.859> and<00:00:29.490> integrate<00:00:30.119> it

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
take the vehicle data and integrate it

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.939 
take the vehicle data and integrate it
with<00:00:30.359> a<00:00:30.390> new<00:00:30.630> hardware<00:00:31.019> device<00:00:31.619> that<00:00:31.859> you

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
with a new hardware device that you

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.950 
with a new hardware device that you
bring<00:00:32.130> into<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.399> vehicle<00:00:32.880> and<00:00:33.120> do<00:00:33.630> something

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
bring into the vehicle and do something

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.530 
bring into the vehicle and do something
new<00:00:34.079> with<00:00:34.110> that<00:00:34.290> data

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:35.540 
new with that data

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.150

my<00:00:36.540> name<00:00:36.690> is<00:00:36.750> Eccleston<00:00:37.260> I'm<00:00:37.739> a<00:00:37.829> research

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
my name is Eccleston I'm a research

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.910 
my name is Eccleston I'm a research
engineer<00:00:38.340> here<00:00:38.820> at<00:00:38.940> Ford<00:00:39.320> what<00:00:40.320> is<00:00:40.559> something

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
engineer here at Ford what is something

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.610 
engineer here at Ford what is something
in<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.129> vehicle<00:00:41.550> that<00:00:42.210> could<00:00:42.420> use<00:00:42.719> some<00:00:43.140> smart

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
in the vehicle that could use some smart

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.380 
in the vehicle that could use some smart
technology<00:00:44.250> and<00:00:44.399> I<00:00:44.460> thought<00:00:44.640> of<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:44.969> manual

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
technology and I thought of the manual

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.420 
technology and I thought of the manual
transmission<00:00:45.600> shift<00:00:46.289> knob<00:00:46.469> so<00:00:47.100> using<00:00:47.370> the

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
transmission shift knob so using the

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.250 
transmission shift knob so using the
vehicle<00:00:47.760> data<00:00:47.940> I've<00:00:48.239> created<00:00:48.539> a<00:00:48.719> haptic

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
vehicle data I've created a haptic

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.200 
vehicle data I've created a haptic
feedback<00:00:49.289> shift<00:00:50.039> knob<00:00:50.280> and<00:00:50.430> what<00:00:50.520> this<00:00:50.700> shift

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
feedback shift knob and what this shift

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.209 
feedback shift knob and what this shift
knob<00:00:51.360> does<00:00:51.629> is<00:00:51.899> it<00:00:52.260> provides<00:00:52.530> a<00:00:52.620> haptic<00:00:52.800> pulse

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
knob does is it provides a haptic pulse

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.279 
knob does is it provides a haptic pulse
when<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:53.969> driver<00:00:54.210> should<00:00:54.510> shift<00:00:54.750> to<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:55.020> next

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
when the driver should shift to the next

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.380 
when the driver should shift to the next
year<00:00:55.649> so<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.340> idea<00:00:56.579> is<00:00:56.730> that<00:00:56.879> drivers<00:00:57.210> no

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
year so the idea is that drivers no

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.080 
year so the idea is that drivers no
longer<00:00:57.719> need<00:00:57.960> to<00:00:57.989> look<00:00:58.890> down<00:00:59.160> at<00:00:59.370> a<00:00:59.399> light<00:00:59.879> or

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
longer need to look down at a light or

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.000 
longer need to look down at a light or
indicator<00:01:00.570> on<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:00.840> dash<00:01:01.050> they<00:01:01.500> can<00:01:01.680> instead

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
indicator on the dash they can instead

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.700 
indicator on the dash they can instead
simply<00:01:02.670> wait<00:01:03.030> for<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.300> haptic<00:01:03.539> feel<00:01:04.019> and<00:01:04.650> you

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
simply wait for the haptic feel and you

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:05.690 
simply wait for the haptic feel and you
can<00:01:04.830> keep<00:01:04.949> their<00:01:05.129> eyes<00:01:05.159> on<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.430> road<00:01:05.519> and

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
can keep their eyes on the road and

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.600 
can keep their eyes on the road and
shift<00:01:06.119> at<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.600> right<00:01:06.750> time<00:01:06.900> this<00:01:07.650> motor<00:01:08.460> is

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
shift at the right time this motor is

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.539 
shift at the right time this motor is

drivers had shift into the next gear to

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.730 
drivers had shift into the next gear to
get<00:01:20.460> best<00:01:20.610> fuel<00:01:20.880> efficiency<00:01:21.390> for<00:01:21.650> people<00:01:22.650> who

application to the physical plastic
housing<00:01:41.549> file<00:01:42.030> so<00:01:42.420> really<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.750> idea<00:01:42.780> is<00:01:43.110> that

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
housing file so really the idea is that

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.230 
housing file so really the idea is that
we<00:01:43.409> can<00:01:43.560> release<00:01:43.829> this<00:01:44.070> design<00:01:44.460> to<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:44.850> public

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
we can release this design to the public

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.389 
we can release this design to the public
and<00:01:45.420> they<00:01:45.570> can<00:01:45.780> then<00:01:45.930> take<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:47.009> haptic

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
and they can then take the haptic

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.520 
and they can then take the haptic
feedback<00:01:47.579> shift<00:01:48.149> knob<00:01:48.299> and<00:01:48.570> further<00:01:49.079> develop

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
feedback shift knob and further develop

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:50.429 
feedback shift knob and further develop
the<00:01:49.619> idea

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:50.439 
the idea

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:52.170 
the idea

the great benefits of open XC is the

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:59.370 
the great benefits of open XC is the
