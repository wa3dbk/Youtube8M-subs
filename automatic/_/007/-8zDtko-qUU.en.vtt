00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
gone through some things to get here we

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.880 
gone through some things to get here we
first<00:00:44.670> started<00:00:45.030> with<00:00:45.180> skins<00:00:45.539> and<00:00:46.350> we<00:00:46.559> use<00:00:46.739> that

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
first started with skins and we use that

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.740 
first started with skins and we use that
data<00:00:47.160> to<00:00:47.309> get<00:00:47.579> make<00:00:47.910> sure<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.180> proportions

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
data to get make sure the proportions

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.479 
data to get make sure the proportions
were<00:00:48.870> right<00:00:49.079> that<00:00:49.440> cold<00:00:49.739> logic<00:00:50.129> was<00:00:50.280> right

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
were right that cold logic was right

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.790 
were right that cold logic was right
under<00:00:50.670> clothes<00:00:51.149> and<00:00:51.480> then<00:00:52.170> we<00:00:52.320> added<00:00:52.530> our

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
under clothes and then we added our

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.830 
under clothes and then we added our
artistic<00:00:53.370> touch<00:00:53.760> to<00:00:53.789> it<00:00:54.030> and<00:00:54.270> we<00:00:54.510> added<00:00:54.629> a

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
artistic touch to it and we added a

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.840 
artistic touch to it and we added a
whole<00:00:55.140> lot<00:00:55.379> of<00:00:55.530> details<00:00:55.949> too<00:00:56.219> so<00:00:56.489> we<00:00:56.730> can

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
whole lot of details too so we can

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.520 
whole lot of details too so we can
actually<00:00:57.000> look<00:00:57.270> at<00:00:57.449> her<00:00:57.539> skin<00:00:57.690> we'll<00:00:58.410> see

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
actually look at her skin we'll see

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.529 
actually look at her skin we'll see
pores<00:00:58.920> you<00:00:59.250> look<00:00:59.609> at<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.820> clothes<00:01:00.059> you<00:01:00.329> see

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
pores you look at the clothes you see

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.020 
pores you look at the clothes you see
all<00:01:00.660> that<00:01:00.809> micro<00:01:01.170> details<00:01:01.350> on<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:02.160> clothes<00:01:02.430> so

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
all that micro details on the clothes so

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.230 
all that micro details on the clothes so
we<00:01:03.180> added<00:01:03.449> a<00:01:03.750> lot<00:01:04.110> to<00:01:04.350> that<00:01:04.739> to<00:01:05.670> make<00:01:05.790> her<00:01:06.000> come

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
we added a lot to that to make her come

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.120 
we added a lot to that to make her come
to<00:01:06.390> life<00:01:06.570> whenever<00:01:07.140> she<00:01:07.380> gets<00:01:07.530> into<00:01:07.740> a<00:01:07.890> fight

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
to life whenever she gets into a fight

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.340 
to life whenever she gets into a fight
she<00:01:08.400> can<00:01:08.549> get<00:01:08.700> dirty<00:01:09.060> or<00:01:09.420> she<00:01:09.750> can<00:01:09.900> get<00:01:10.020> bloody

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
she can get dirty or she can get bloody

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.260 
she can get dirty or she can get bloody
but<00:01:10.920> she's<00:01:11.130> out<00:01:11.250> in<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.460> snow<00:01:11.580> she'll

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
but she's out in the snow she'll

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.539 
but she's out in the snow she'll
actually<00:01:12.420> accumulated<00:01:13.229> snow<00:01:13.680> on<00:01:14.100> her<00:01:14.159> clothes

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
actually accumulated snow on her clothes

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.270 
actually accumulated snow on her clothes
so<00:01:15.210> she<00:01:15.240> fits<00:01:15.840> into<00:01:16.110> every<00:01:16.560> environment<00:01:16.830> that

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
so she fits into every environment that

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.190 
so she fits into every environment that
she's<00:01:17.549> in<00:01:17.729> we're<00:01:18.150> able<00:01:18.299> to<00:01:18.570> actually<00:01:18.600> capture

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
she's in we're able to actually capture

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.240 
she's in we're able to actually capture
the<00:01:20.100> nuances<00:01:20.820> of<00:01:21.060> facial<00:01:21.630> movement<00:01:22.229> and<00:01:22.470> she

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
the nuances of facial movement and she

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.010 
the nuances of facial movement and she
really<00:01:23.610> comes<00:01:23.850> to<00:01:24.000> life<00:01:24.030> and<00:01:24.479> it<00:01:24.570> is<00:01:24.659> so<00:01:24.869> much

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
really comes to life and it is so much

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.719 
really comes to life and it is so much
better<00:01:25.170> than<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.590> bone<00:01:25.770> driven<00:01:26.159> system<00:01:26.520> that

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
better than the bone driven system that

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.749 
better than the bone driven system that
needs<00:01:26.909> to<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.390> past<00:01:27.689> and<00:01:28.049> this<00:01:28.710> all<00:01:28.979> adds<00:01:29.310> to

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
needs to the past and this all adds to

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:36.020 
needs to the past and this all adds to
the<00:01:30.060> realism<00:01:30.329> of<00:01:30.659> her<00:01:31.079> acting
