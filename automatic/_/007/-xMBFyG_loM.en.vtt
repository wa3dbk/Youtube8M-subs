00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
people don't really know the mechanics

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.740 
people don't really know the mechanics
of<00:00:41.040> rain<00:00:41.250> they<00:00:41.520> don't<00:00:41.670> even<00:00:41.760> know<00:00:42.000> why<00:00:42.570> they

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
of rain they don't even know why they

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.360 
of rain they don't even know why they
don't<00:00:42.870> like<00:00:43.110> this<00:00:43.320> thing<00:00:43.379> that's<00:00:43.829> falling<00:00:44.250> on

so I want to talk to you about that a
little<00:00:46.920> bit<00:00:48.710> now<00:00:49.710> some<00:00:49.980> of<00:00:50.100> you<00:00:50.250> perhaps<00:00:50.460> have

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
little bit now some of you perhaps have

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.330 
little bit now some of you perhaps have
heard<00:00:51.090> of<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.270> water<00:00:51.510> cycle<00:00:51.870> it's<00:00:52.320> why<00:00:53.100> do<00:00:53.160> we

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
heard of the water cycle it's why do we

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.310 
heard of the water cycle it's why do we
have<00:00:53.520> brain<00:00:53.820> you<00:00:54.030> see<00:00:54.180> we've<00:00:54.329> got<00:00:54.360> rain<00:00:54.989> up<00:00:55.230> in

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
have brain you see we've got rain up in

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.709 
have brain you see we've got rain up in
the<00:00:55.440> clouds<00:00:55.770> and<00:00:56.100> then<00:00:56.190> it<00:00:56.309> rains<00:00:56.910> down<00:00:57.300> and

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
the clouds and then it rains down and

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.380 
the clouds and then it rains down and
collected<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:58.680> rivers<00:00:59.100> and<00:00:59.399> lakes<00:00:59.579> and<00:01:00.059> and

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
collected and rivers and lakes and and

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.319 
collected and rivers and lakes and and
maybe<00:01:00.780> even<00:01:01.050> your<00:01:01.289> drink<00:01:01.559> it<00:01:01.710> and<00:01:01.829> then

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:02.329 
maybe even your drink it and then

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:05.960 
maybe even your drink it and then
evaporates<00:01:03.329> into<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.470> clouds<00:01:04.830> and<00:01:05.549> that's

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
evaporates into the clouds and that's

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.120 
evaporates into the clouds and that's
how<00:01:06.119> it<00:01:06.240> works<00:01:06.450> and<00:01:06.720> that<00:01:07.020> cycle<00:01:07.500> repeats<00:01:07.860> and

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
how it works and that cycle repeats and

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.070 
how it works and that cycle repeats and
definitely<00:01:08.700> most<00:01:09.060> people<00:01:09.420> have<00:01:09.510> some<00:01:09.840> vague

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
definitely most people have some vague

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.500 
definitely most people have some vague
understanding<00:01:10.470> of<00:01:10.979> that<00:01:11.210> but<00:01:12.210> what<00:01:12.360> most

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
understanding of that but what most

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.520 
understanding of that but what most
people<00:01:12.630> don't<00:01:12.869> realize<00:01:13.080> is<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:14.549> horrible

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
people don't realize is the horrible

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.100 
people don't realize is the horrible

the water cycle ladies and gentlemen is

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.099 
the water cycle ladies and gentlemen is
how<00:03:13.939> species<00:03:14.939> lower<00:03:15.510> down<00:03:15.780> on<00:03:16.019> the

I'm up here like I said I'm a

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.599 
I'm up here like I said I'm a
hydrologist<00:03:48.480> that<00:03:49.409> um<00:03:49.590> that<00:03:50.099> doesn't<00:03:50.310> just

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:50.609 
hydrologist that um that doesn't just

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:53.179 
hydrologist that um that doesn't just
have<00:03:51.000> to<00:03:51.180> do<00:03:51.329> have<00:03:51.810> to<00:03:52.019> do<00:03:52.169> with<00:03:52.379> what<00:03:53.069> the

have to do have to do with what the
water<00:03:53.340> cycle<00:03:53.609> I<00:03:53.879> I<00:03:54.090> study<00:03:54.329> other<00:03:54.480> aspects<00:03:55.019> of

water cycle I I study other aspects of

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:57.979 
water cycle I I study other aspects of
water<00:03:55.379> tip<00:03:55.730> and<00:03:56.730> perhaps<00:03:57.180> perhaps<00:03:57.629> if<00:03:57.900> he

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
water tip and perhaps perhaps if he

00:03:57.989 --> 00:03:59.659 
water tip and perhaps perhaps if he
doesn't<00:03:58.260> even<00:03:58.349> notice<00:03:58.560> from<00:03:58.889> my<00:03:59.129> for<00:03:59.579> my
