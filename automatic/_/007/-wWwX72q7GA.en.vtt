00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:12.670
 Of course good what we need is 

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:16.120
 to have 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:20.450
 android 4.0 point 4 

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:22.430
 a major or recent version after 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:26.090
 we have to have this program that 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:28.550
 called the droid vpn that this will give us the 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:30.140
 free internet good first thing 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.240
 they have to do that is very important 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.700
 pp create an android or has not 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:36.920
 puntocom I the description will leave you the 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.290
 page so you can can 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.140
 create account 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:43.450
 well they are going to put once you already 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:46.780
 have downloaded the application in the 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:50.410
 play these want you to put connect 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:55.000
 connection protocol or something like that good 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:58.540
 then they will point out vp and in the port 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.330
 setting will go to the port set and 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:03.220
 here they will come out first as 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:06.670
 default configuration is going to have 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:09.250
 a 01 10 you have to erase that and 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:12.270
 they will place 53 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.270
 after that 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.270
 since your account was created here you have 

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:18.659
 you place your email with 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:21.579
 which one they registered and their password the 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:26.009
 what to enter 

00:01:21.579 --> 00:01:26.009
 good and then they give to 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:36.290
 namely mail loggins the time and accept 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.530
 and later 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:41.830
 they are going to choose one of these servers 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:45.200
 minus those of grow new york miami 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:47.540
 chicago los angeles die is because those 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.220
 are the ones that you have to premium 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:52.640
 choose are the freezer see an officer 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:55.220
 bird or freezer see you so I paid for 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.229
 a premium account for because what 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.780
 happens if I say is that sometimes if you 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:01.150
 are 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.280
 they are not premium they will not connect 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:06.000
 one because there are several connected so 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.930
 they have to go trying 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.759
 cast 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:11.650
 and if they are first they can connect with 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:13.960
 this I am going to an account rewards for not 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.670
 be so long so it is also 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:18.220
 cheap it costs like two thousand five hundred 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:22.230
 pesos per month but if you do not 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.230
 they want no no they pay it 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:28.060
 and then you have what they have to do 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.060
 is to connect 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.670
 already I have to dodge packages 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.670
 data 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.080
 and now what they have is activated 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:43.290
 what to do is connect the truth is that 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:45.920
 it seems that move to move the configuration 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.920
 of my account 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:50.469
 producers 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:55.950
 there have to be doing because it 

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:58.299
 to leave that as you are not premium you 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:02.040
 that's going to work out for you and you have to continue 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:02.040
 trying like this until you connect them 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.659
 have to continue to keep trying to 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.799
 connect the wagons but they have to 

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:13.799
 keep trying 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:33.599
 They have to try and try until 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:35.010
 work them first when the 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:37.140
 first time they install the program they 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:40.950
 is going to connect you from one of a single 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:42.370
 time but afterwards they are not like that 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.099
 who have 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:47.560
 a machinist did not try to have to 

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:50.310
 choose others the fi server 4 chosen already 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.310
 see if it connects us 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:58.060
 and that there are some that are full of 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:04:01.290
 people that as I do not experience is 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.290
 connected to these servers 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:24.590
 They have seen that here too good either 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:24.590
 wants to connect they have to choose another 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:36.069
 this 100 megabytes free application that 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:38.770
 I in the day at least do not 

00:04:36.069 --> 00:04:41.129
 was consuming when it was not the 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:41.129
 prize 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:57.189
 and with this 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:05:00.310
 well now let's try the connection to 

00:04:57.189 --> 00:05:02.259
 internet I'm going to put the google browser 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:04.409
 chrome that I have it installed here in my 

00:05:02.259 --> 00:05:07.409
 device and we're going to get 

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:07.409
 Facebook 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:24.520
 the speed is super good because I 

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:27.000
 I watched video on YouTube, all that and it was 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:27.000
 Quick 

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:35.470
 having a good signal from part of 

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:37.630
 enter is going to connect you fast only 

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:40.460
 they have to try until it connects 

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:43.370
 the non- positive program 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:45.350
 and that look as you can see works all 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:49.039
 the page even all the applications 

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:51.110
 like facebook line instagram and all the 

00:05:49.039 --> 00:05:52.500
 who wear the place cake is going to 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:54.120
 function 

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:58.140
 good if I hope you liked it 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:06:01.160
 tutorial stations and hopefully serve you 

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:01.160
