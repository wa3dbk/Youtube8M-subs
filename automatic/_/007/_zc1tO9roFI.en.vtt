extended periods of time you know over a
couple<00:00:30.539> of<00:00:30.660> months<00:00:30.990> or<00:00:31.170> years<00:00:31.520> the<00:00:32.520> gas<00:00:32.669> will

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
couple of months or years the gas will

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.630 
couple of months or years the gas will
gummy<00:00:33.149> up<00:00:33.390> it<00:00:33.600> will<00:00:33.690> become<00:00:34.039> more<00:00:35.039> solid<00:00:35.489> and

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
gummy up it will become more solid and

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.790 
gummy up it will become more solid and
you're<00:00:36.180> gonna<00:00:36.300> have<00:00:36.449> a<00:00:36.539> hell<00:00:37.469> of<00:00:37.500> a<00:00:37.649> time

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
you're gonna have a hell of a time

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.399 
you're gonna have a hell of a time
getting<00:00:38.280> that<00:00:38.399> gas<00:00:38.670> out<00:00:38.989> so<00:00:39.989> it's<00:00:40.199> better<00:00:40.319> to

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:40.409 
getting that gas out so it's better to

00:00:40.409 --> 00:00:41.950 
getting that gas out so it's better to
just<00:00:40.649> drain<00:00:40.829> it<00:00:40.890> you<00:00:41.399> don't<00:00:41.579> need<00:00:41.640> a<00:00:41.730> very

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:41.960 
just drain it you don't need a very

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.809 
just drain it you don't need a very
complex<00:00:42.960> tool<00:00:43.370> we're<00:00:44.370> using<00:00:44.519> something

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:44.819 
complex tool we're using something

00:00:44.819 --> 00:00:49.069 
complex tool we're using something
called<00:00:44.940> a<00:00:45.179> siphon<00:00:45.929> pump<00:00:46.199> it's<00:00:46.589> 20<00:00:46.949> bucks<00:00:48.079> the

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
called a siphon pump it's 20 bucks the

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.910 
called a siphon pump it's 20 bucks the
hose<00:00:49.260> is<00:00:49.469> going<00:00:49.530> to<00:00:49.649> go<00:00:49.829> down<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.940> fuel<00:00:51.329> filler

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:51.920 
hose is going to go down the fuel filler

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.950 
hose is going to go down the fuel filler
tube<00:00:52.920> into<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:53.879> gas<00:00:54.059> tank<00:00:54.389> and<00:00:54.600> we're<00:00:54.809> just

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
tube into the gas tank and we're just

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.110 
tube into the gas tank and we're just
going<00:00:55.109> to<00:00:55.139> pump<00:00:55.350> away<00:00:55.469> and<00:00:56.249> get<00:00:56.460> that<00:00:56.639> gas<00:00:56.879> out

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
going to pump away and get that gas out

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.049 
going to pump away and get that gas out
and<00:00:57.359> we<00:00:57.420> can<00:00:57.569> use<00:00:57.719> it<00:00:57.839> in<00:00:57.989> a<00:00:58.049> different<00:00:58.379> car<00:00:59.059> so

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
and we can use it in a different car so

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.509 
and we can use it in a different car so
we're<00:01:00.149> going<00:01:00.239> to<00:01:00.329> show<00:01:00.479> how<00:01:00.629> to<00:01:00.659> do<00:01:00.899> that<00:01:00.929> and

00:01:01.509 --> 00:01:01.519 
we're going to show how to do that and

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:05.390 
we're going to show how to do that and
again<00:01:02.899> siphon<00:01:03.899> pump<00:01:04.170> and<00:01:05.070> we're<00:01:05.220> going<00:01:05.339> to

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
again siphon pump and we're going to

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.810 
again siphon pump and we're going to
show<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.700> procedure<00:01:06.530> so<00:01:07.530> I<00:01:07.860> was<00:01:08.370> unable<00:01:08.760> to

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
show the procedure so I was unable to

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.510 
show the procedure so I was unable to
get<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.600> fuel<00:01:10.260> siphon<00:01:10.680> here<00:01:10.860> down<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.340> gas

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
get the fuel siphon here down the gas

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.330 
get the fuel siphon here down the gas
filler<00:01:11.850> tank<00:01:12.119> filler<00:01:12.899> cap<00:01:13.110> sorry<00:01:13.439> and<00:01:13.680> into

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
filler tank filler cap sorry and into

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.740 
filler tank filler cap sorry and into
the<00:01:14.430> gas<00:01:14.579> tank<00:01:14.789> which<00:01:15.090> is<00:01:15.119> in<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.360> center<00:01:15.659> of

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
the gas tank which is in the center of

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.319 
the gas tank which is in the center of
the<00:01:15.810> vehicle<00:01:16.310> the<00:01:17.310> lines<00:01:17.520> just<00:01:17.939> weren't<00:01:18.119> long

00:01:18.319 --> 00:01:18.329 
the vehicle the lines just weren't long

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:20.149 
the vehicle the lines just weren't long
enough<00:01:18.360> or<00:01:18.869> there<00:01:19.079> was<00:01:19.170> too<00:01:19.320> many<00:01:19.409> bends<00:01:19.920> in

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
enough or there was too many bends in

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.630 
enough or there was too many bends in
the<00:01:21.140> input<00:01:22.140> lines<00:01:22.380> so<00:01:22.950> instead<00:01:23.369> what<00:01:23.490> we're

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
the input lines so instead what we're

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.230 
the input lines so instead what we're
going<00:01:23.670> to<00:01:23.789> do<00:01:23.909> is<00:01:24.320> go<00:01:25.320> through<00:01:25.700> the<00:01:26.700> fuel<00:01:27.000> level

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
going to do is go through the fuel level

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.990 
going to do is go through the fuel level
sender<00:01:27.840> now<00:01:28.829> the<00:01:28.950> fuel<00:01:29.219> level<00:01:29.340> sender<00:01:29.820> is

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
sender now the fuel level sender is

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.060 
sender now the fuel level sender is
accessible<00:01:30.509> from<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:30.899> top<00:01:31.109> of<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.890> gas<00:01:32.039> tank

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
accessible from the top of the gas tank

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.190 
accessible from the top of the gas tank
and<00:01:32.520> this<00:01:32.729> is<00:01:32.820> this<00:01:33.390> is<00:01:33.539> the<00:01:33.630> mid<00:01:33.780> center

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
and this is this is the mid center

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.719 
and this is this is the mid center
console<00:01:34.680> here<00:01:34.859> so<00:01:35.039> we<00:01:35.100> just<00:01:35.219> have<00:01:35.369> to<00:01:35.399> remove

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
console here so we just have to remove

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.550 
console here so we just have to remove
some<00:01:35.789> of<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.179> you<00:01:36.750> know<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:36.869> covering<00:01:37.350> and

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
some of the you know the covering and

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.800 
some of the you know the covering and
then<00:01:37.649> we<00:01:37.740> can<00:01:37.859> access<00:01:38.009> this<00:01:38.460> level<00:01:38.850> sender<00:01:39.179> and

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
then we can access this level sender and

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.870 
then we can access this level sender and
this<00:01:39.960> unit<00:01:40.229> is<00:01:40.350> responsible<00:01:40.530> for<00:01:41.039> determining

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
this unit is responsible for determining

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.609 
this unit is responsible for determining
how<00:01:42.030> much<00:01:42.149> fuel<00:01:42.479> was<00:01:42.659> left<00:01:42.929> in<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.170> gas<00:01:43.320> tank

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
how much fuel was left in the gas tank

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.389 
how much fuel was left in the gas tank
and<00:01:43.799> that's<00:01:44.429> what<00:01:44.820> affects<00:01:45.630> your<00:01:46.369> fuel<00:01:47.369> gauge

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
and that's what affects your fuel gauge

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.929 
and that's what affects your fuel gauge
down<00:01:48.270> here<00:01:49.280> so<00:01:50.280> we're<00:01:50.399> going<00:01:50.490> to<00:01:50.549> do<00:01:50.640> here<00:01:50.850> is

lift it slightly and put the fuel siphon
in<00:01:55.469> there<00:01:55.950> and<00:01:56.159> then<00:01:56.820> meter<00:01:57.090> it<00:01:57.329> out<00:01:58.039> in<00:01:59.039> five

in there and then meter it out in five

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:06.380 
in there and then meter it out in five
liter<00:02:00.479> increments<00:02:02.990> 87<00:02:03.990> and<00:02:04.249> 1887<00:02:05.249> 88<00:02:05.640> and<00:02:05.789> 89<00:02:05.880> I

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
liter increments 87 and 1887 88 and 89 I

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.870 
liter increments 87 and 1887 88 and 89 I

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
believe have a drain plug the bottom of

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.960 
believe have a drain plug the bottom of
the<00:02:08.940> fuel<00:02:09.119> tank<00:02:09.210> so<00:02:09.990> underneath<00:02:10.229> the<00:02:10.470> car<00:02:10.679> I

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
the fuel tank so underneath the car I

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.790 
the fuel tank so underneath the car I
could<00:02:11.970> have<00:02:12.060> done<00:02:12.240> this<00:02:12.390> option<00:02:12.930> but<00:02:13.290> I<00:02:13.560> chose

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
could have done this option but I chose

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.580 
could have done this option but I chose
not<00:02:13.980> to<00:02:14.300> because<00:02:15.300> I<00:02:15.420> don't<00:02:15.780> have<00:02:16.020> a<00:02:16.080> receptacle

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
not to because I don't have a receptacle

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.350 
not to because I don't have a receptacle
it's<00:02:16.920> big<00:02:17.100> enough<00:02:17.220> to<00:02:17.370> hold<00:02:17.640> the<00:02:17.880> whole<00:02:18.090> volume

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
it's big enough to hold the whole volume

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
it's big enough to hold the whole volume
of<00:02:18.660> the<00:02:18.780> tank

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
so and this is a thirty liter tank so

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:24.590 
so and this is a thirty liter tank so
I'm<00:02:23.220> gonna<00:02:23.340> do<00:02:23.490> it<00:02:23.580> step-by-step<00:02:23.790> using<00:02:24.540> the

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
I'm gonna do it step-by-step using the

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.300 
I'm gonna do it step-by-step using the
fuel<00:02:24.810> siphon<00:02:25.230> which<00:02:25.380> is<00:02:25.500> a<00:02:25.530> nice<00:02:25.710> handy<00:02:26.160> tool

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
fuel siphon which is a nice handy tool

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.160 
fuel siphon which is a nice handy tool
and<00:02:26.610> we're<00:02:27.330> going<00:02:27.450> to<00:02:27.510> go<00:02:27.570> through<00:02:27.870> the<00:02:27.990> top

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
and we're going to go through the top

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:38.270 
and we're going to go through the top
here<00:02:28.470> through<00:02:28.980> the<00:02:29.070> fuel<00:02:29.310> level<00:02:29.460> sender
