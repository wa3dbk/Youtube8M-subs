that you have learned the whole shape

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:24.670 
that you have learned the whole shape
you<00:03:21.109> must<00:03:21.379> know<00:03:21.709> when<00:03:22.280> sleeping<00:03:23.379> you<00:03:24.379> have<00:03:24.560> to

you must know when sleeping you have to

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.599 
you must know when sleeping you have to
keep<00:03:24.829> your<00:03:25.010> hands<00:03:25.840> synchronized<00:03:26.840> so<00:03:27.829> you

everything<00:03:43.459> moving<00:03:43.760> down<00:03:43.970> we<00:03:44.450> are<00:03:44.540> having<00:03:44.780> to

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
everything moving down we are having to

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.009 
everything moving down we are having to
keep<00:03:45.280> your<00:03:46.280> hands<00:03:46.909> synchronized<00:03:47.569> in<00:03:47.840> one

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:48.019 
keep your hands synchronized in one

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:50.110 
keep your hands synchronized in one
motion<00:03:48.290> because<00:03:49.280> sometimes<00:03:49.700> you're<00:03:49.909> going<00:03:50.060> to

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120 
motion because sometimes you're going to

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.149 
motion because sometimes you're going to
be<00:03:50.329> trying<00:03:50.720> it<00:03:50.870> and<00:03:51.079> you're<00:03:51.799> just<00:03:51.919> you're

00:03:52.149 --> 00:03:52.159 
be trying it and you're just you're

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:53.649 
be trying it and you're just you're
going<00:03:52.220> to<00:03:52.340> hit<00:03:52.459> other<00:03:52.639> string<00:03:53.090> within<00:03:53.480> its

00:03:53.649 --> 00:03:53.659 
going to hit other string within its

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:55.000 
going to hit other string within its
like<00:03:53.959> yours<00:03:54.290> is<00:03:54.409> going<00:03:54.590> to<00:03:54.650> hear<00:03:54.859> all<00:03:54.980> the

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010 
like yours is going to hear all the

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:57.699 
like yours is going to hear all the
bunch<00:03:55.310> of<00:03:55.720> string<00:03:56.720> the<00:03:56.840> yourens<00:03:57.079> close<00:03:57.260> to<00:03:57.500> hit

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:57.709 
bunch of string the yourens close to hit

00:03:57.709 --> 00:03:59.530 
bunch of string the yourens close to hit
those<00:03:58.250> a<00:03:58.430> bunch<00:03:58.579> of<00:03:58.669> screeching<00:03:59.150> and<00:03:59.329> stuff

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
those a bunch of screeching and stuff

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.869 
those a bunch of screeching and stuff
and<00:03:59.810> that's<00:04:00.319> just<00:04:00.560> because<00:04:00.709> you<00:04:01.280> don't<00:04:01.760> have

00:04:01.869 --> 00:04:01.879 
and that's just because you don't have

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:04.030 
and that's just because you don't have
your<00:04:02.060> hand<00:04:02.239> synchronized<00:04:02.750> and<00:04:02.959> i<00:04:03.590> found<00:04:03.889> the

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.040 
your hand synchronized and i found the

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:08.170 
your hand synchronized and i found the
synchronizing<00:04:04.579> to<00:04:04.849> be<00:04:04.909> the<00:04:05.030> hardest<00:04:06.280> and<00:04:07.280> the

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.180 
synchronizing to be the hardest and the

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.589 
synchronizing to be the hardest and the
other<00:04:08.389> thing<00:04:08.479> is<00:04:08.989> some<00:04:09.590> people<00:04:09.620> have<00:04:10.370> a<00:04:10.940> harder

00:04:11.589 --> 00:04:11.599 
other thing is some people have a harder

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:14.520 
other thing is some people have a harder
time<00:04:11.629> going<00:04:12.109> down<00:04:12.729> like<00:04:13.729> that<00:04:13.879> the<00:04:14.329> love

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
time going down like that the love

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:19.589 
time going down like that the love
easier<00:04:15.530> time<00:04:15.709> going<00:04:15.919> on<00:04:16.130> vice<00:04:16.699> versa<00:04:17.470> so<00:04:18.470> if

00:04:19.589 --> 00:04:19.599 
easier time going on vice versa so if

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:23.140 
easier time going on vice versa so if
you<00:04:20.599> are<00:04:21.019> good<00:04:21.349> at<00:04:21.380> going<00:04:21.919> down<00:04:22.430> i<00:04:22.460> suggest

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.150 
you are good at going down i suggest

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.620 
you are good at going down i suggest
working<00:04:23.479> on<00:04:23.570> going<00:04:24.020> up<00:04:24.169> most<00:04:24.620> of<00:04:24.710> the<00:04:24.800> time<00:04:25.010> and

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:25.630 
working on going up most of the time and

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:28.629 
working on going up most of the time and
once<00:04:26.630> you<00:04:27.229> are<00:04:27.500> to<00:04:27.680> the<00:04:27.800> point<00:04:28.039> that<00:04:28.220> you<00:04:28.490> could

00:04:28.629 --> 00:04:28.639 
once you are to the point that you could

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:33.719 
once you are to the point that you could
do<00:04:28.729> them<00:04:28.849> up<00:04:29.659> and<00:04:29.990> down<00:04:30.199> you're<00:04:31.270> pretty<00:04:32.270> good

00:04:33.719 --> 00:04:33.729 
do them up and down you're pretty good

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:36.760 
do them up and down you're pretty good
so<00:04:34.729> here's<00:04:35.360> an<00:04:35.539> example<00:04:35.599> of<00:04:36.110> me<00:04:36.349> and<00:04:36.650> if<00:04:36.740> you

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:36.770 
so here's an example of me and if you

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:40.449 
so here's an example of me and if you
have<00:04:36.979> any<00:04:37.070> other<00:04:37.220> questions<00:04:37.760> just<00:04:38.180> ask
