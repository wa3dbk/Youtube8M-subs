and<00:00:07.370> this<00:00:07.549> helps<00:00:07.880> you<00:00:08.000> I'm<00:00:08.240> going<00:00:08.510> to<00:00:08.570> revisit

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:08.900 
and this helps you I'm going to revisit

and this helps you I'm going to revisit
inflating<00:00:09.770> a<00:00:09.830> tubeless<00:00:10.070> tire<00:00:11.530> in<00:00:12.530> my<00:00:12.620> previous

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:12.980 
inflating a tubeless tire in my previous

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:14.859 
inflating a tubeless tire in my previous
video<00:00:13.370> about<00:00:13.400> inflating<00:00:14.030> a<00:00:14.090> troupers<00:00:14.450> tire<00:00:14.660> I

00:00:14.859 --> 00:00:14.869 
video about inflating a troupers tire I

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:16.510 
video about inflating a troupers tire I
recommended<00:00:15.500> a<00:00:15.590> compressor<00:00:16.100> to<00:00:16.160> be<00:00:16.309> in<00:00:16.430> the

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:16.520 
recommended a compressor to be in the

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.609 
recommended a compressor to be in the
best<00:00:16.730> way<00:00:17.000> and<00:00:17.270> I<00:00:17.779> still<00:00:18.020> think<00:00:18.050> it<00:00:18.289> is<00:00:18.440> the

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:18.619 
best way and I still think it is the

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:20.980 
best way and I still think it is the
best<00:00:18.800> way<00:00:19.010> but<00:00:19.760> not<00:00:19.880> everyone<00:00:20.330> has<00:00:20.510> access<00:00:20.930> to

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:20.990 
best way but not everyone has access to

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:24.550 
best way but not everyone has access to
a<00:00:21.170> compressor<00:00:22.599> later<00:00:23.599> on<00:00:23.839> I<00:00:23.869> then<00:00:24.109> found<00:00:24.410> on

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:24.560 
a compressor later on I then found on

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.249 
a compressor later on I then found on
the<00:00:24.679> internet<00:00:25.039> plans<00:00:25.310> for<00:00:25.580> making<00:00:25.730> your<00:00:26.150> own

00:00:26.249 --> 00:00:26.259 
the internet plans for making your own

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:30.849 
the internet plans for making your own
DIY<00:00:27.259> giblet<00:00:28.220> inflator<00:00:28.640> and<00:00:29.560> that's<00:00:30.560> what<00:00:30.769> I'm

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:30.859 
DIY giblet inflator and that's what I'm

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:32.589 
DIY giblet inflator and that's what I'm
going<00:00:31.160> to<00:00:31.189> show<00:00:31.369> you<00:00:31.429> how<00:00:31.640> to<00:00:31.669> do<00:00:31.910> now<00:00:32.180> the

00:00:32.589 --> 00:00:32.599 
going to show you how to do now the

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:34.180 
going to show you how to do now the
principles<00:00:33.079> are<00:00:33.230> same<00:00:33.410> as<00:00:33.560> a<00:00:33.650> compressor

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:34.190 
principles are same as a compressor

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.330 
principles are same as a compressor
where<00:00:35.060> the<00:00:35.150> compressor<00:00:35.690> uses<00:00:36.140> a<00:00:36.380> metal

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:37.340 
where the compressor uses a metal

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.900 
where the compressor uses a metal
cylinder<00:00:37.550> to<00:00:38.500> increase<00:00:39.500> the<00:00:39.680> pressure<00:00:39.920> this

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:40.910 
cylinder to increase the pressure this

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:42.760 
cylinder to increase the pressure this
is<00:00:40.970> going<00:00:41.270> to<00:00:41.330> use<00:00:41.540> a<00:00:41.570> plastic<00:00:41.990> two-liter

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:42.770 
is going to use a plastic two-liter

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.280 
is going to use a plastic two-liter
bottle<00:00:43.490> to<00:00:43.640> do<00:00:43.790> the<00:00:43.850> same<00:00:44.090> thing<00:00:44.360> two<00:00:45.110> liter

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:45.290 
bottle to do the same thing two liter

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:49.030 
bottle to do the same thing two liter
bottle<00:00:45.680> acts<00:00:45.980> as<00:00:46.370> a<00:00:46.850> air<00:00:47.300> reservoir<00:00:47.990> and<00:00:48.620> is

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:49.040 
bottle acts as a air reservoir and is

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.090 
bottle acts as a air reservoir and is
held<00:00:49.250> under<00:00:49.490> pressure<00:00:49.910> by<00:00:50.690> the<00:00:50.720> valves<00:00:51.230> in<00:00:51.380> the

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:52.100 
held under pressure by the valves in the

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.460 
held under pressure by the valves in the
cap<00:00:52.310> that<00:00:53.150> pressure<00:00:53.450> is<00:00:53.660> then<00:00:53.840> released<00:00:54.200> by

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:54.470 
cap that pressure is then released by

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:58.840 
cap that pressure is then released by
the<00:00:54.530> tube<00:00:55.240> into<00:00:56.240> your<00:00:56.480> tire<00:00:57.400> the<00:00:58.400> tire<00:00:58.430> will

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
the tube into your tire the tire will

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.480 
the tube into your tire the tire will
then<00:00:58.970> pop<00:00:59.420> onto<00:00:59.810> the<00:00:59.900> rim<00:01:00.140> just<00:01:00.920> like<00:01:01.160> it<00:01:01.310> will

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:01.490 
then pop onto the rim just like it will

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:03.730 
then pop onto the rim just like it will
do<00:01:01.670> when<00:01:01.820> using<00:01:02.150> a<00:01:02.210> compressor<00:01:02.600> it's<00:01:03.560> very

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:03.740 
do when using a compressor it's very

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:05.920 
do when using a compressor it's very
cheap<00:01:03.980> it's<00:01:04.430> very<00:01:04.640> simple<00:01:05.000> to<00:01:05.180> make<00:01:05.210> and<00:01:05.810> it

six mil holes in the bottle top don't

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:48.580 
six mil holes in the bottle top don't
make<00:01:46.880> them<00:01:46.999> too<00:01:47.179> close<00:01:47.450> to<00:01:47.600> the<00:01:47.719> edge<00:01:47.869> because

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
make them too close to the edge because

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.919 
make them too close to the edge because
then<00:01:48.979> it<00:01:49.759> won't<00:01:49.969> screw<00:01:50.270> back<00:01:50.450> home<00:01:50.659> to<00:01:50.840> the

00:01:50.919 --> 00:01:50.929 
then it won't screw back home to the

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:54.370 
then it won't screw back home to the
bottle<00:01:52.179> tighten<00:01:53.179> them<00:01:53.329> down<00:01:53.389> using<00:01:54.139> the

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
bottle tighten them down using the

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.090 
bottle tighten them down using the
Presta<00:01:54.709> valve<00:01:54.920> locking<00:01:55.310> nut<00:01:55.840> and<00:01:57.100> you've

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
Presta valve locking nut and you've

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.859 
Presta valve locking nut and you've
simply<00:01:58.520> got<00:01:58.780> your<00:01:59.780> top<00:01:59.990> ready<00:02:00.229> to<00:02:00.409> go<00:02:01.869> once

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869 
simply got your top ready to go once

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:14.089 
simply got your top ready to go once
this<00:02:03.109> is<00:02:03.459> screwed<00:02:04.459> back<00:02:04.639> onto<00:02:04.880> your<00:02:05.060> bottle

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:14.099 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:16.620 

the<00:02:15.099> idea<00:02:15.459> is<00:02:15.640> that<00:02:15.670> you<00:02:15.910> connect<00:02:16.239> your<00:02:16.360> pump

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
the idea is that you connect your pump

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.710 
the idea is that you connect your pump
to<00:02:16.810> this<00:02:16.930> end<00:02:18.000> pressurize<00:02:19.000> the<00:02:19.180> bottle<00:02:19.330> to

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
to this end pressurize the bottle to

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.300 
to this end pressurize the bottle to
around<00:02:19.900> about<00:02:20.020> 40<00:02:20.440> to<00:02:20.650> 60<00:02:21.010> psi<00:02:23.190> what<00:02:24.190> you're

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
around about 40 to 60 psi what you're
