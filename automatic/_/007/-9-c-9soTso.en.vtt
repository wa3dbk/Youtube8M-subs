previous level what's not handsome okay
stretch<00:00:39.050> what<00:00:39.230> I<00:00:39.260> said

00:00:41.069 --> 00:00:41.079 
stretch what I said

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:42.750 
stretch what I said
originally<00:00:41.920> I<00:00:42.010> thought<00:00:42.039> that<00:00:42.429> you<00:00:42.579> couldn't

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:42.760 
originally I thought that you couldn't

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.610 
originally I thought that you couldn't
get<00:00:42.969> the<00:00:43.059> blue<00:00:43.239> yoshi<00:00:43.420> because<00:00:43.899> one<00:00:44.379> yo<00:00:44.499> she

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:44.620 
get the blue yoshi because one yo she

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.439 
get the blue yoshi because one yo she
was<00:00:44.829> kept<00:00:45.070> alive<00:00:45.190> but<00:00:45.699> that's<00:00:45.940> why<00:00:46.089> you<00:00:46.120> put<00:00:46.390> a

00:00:46.439 --> 00:00:46.449 
was kept alive but that's why you put a

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:48.509 
was kept alive but that's why you put a
halfway<00:00:46.809> point<00:00:46.839> so<00:00:47.379> i<00:00:47.440> can<00:00:47.649> die<00:00:47.890> and<00:00:48.250> come<00:00:48.460> back

00:00:48.509 --> 00:00:48.519 
halfway point so i can die and come back

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:50.430 
halfway point so i can die and come back
here<00:00:49.059> and<00:00:49.210> pretty<00:00:49.510> much<00:00:49.570> be<00:00:49.870> able<00:00:50.050> to<00:00:50.140> take<00:00:50.320> the

the yoshi beat it and it becomes a fully
grown<00:01:13.899> yoshi<00:01:15.299> now<00:01:16.299> we<00:01:16.360> can<00:01:16.569> do<00:01:16.690> this<00:01:16.840> level<00:01:21.270> you

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:22.270 
grown yoshi now we can do this level you

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.190 
grown yoshi now we can do this level you
almost<00:01:22.360> had<00:01:22.720> me<00:01:22.750> there<00:01:24.810> soon<00:01:25.810> as<00:01:25.899> I<00:01:26.020> saw<00:01:26.170> the

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.200 
almost had me there soon as I saw the

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.300 
almost had me there soon as I saw the
halfway<00:01:26.470> point<00:01:26.649> I<00:01:27.039> knew<00:01:27.250> what<00:01:27.940> you<00:01:28.090> intended

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
halfway point I knew what you intended

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:30.930 
halfway point I knew what you intended
especially<00:01:30.310> since<00:01:30.399> you<00:01:30.549> don't<00:01:30.729> put<00:01:30.880> it

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:30.940 
especially since you don't put it

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:32.669 
especially since you don't put it
halfway<00:01:31.060> points<00:01:31.569> normally<00:01:31.990> in<00:01:32.110> hack<00:01:32.289> since

00:01:32.669 --> 00:01:32.679 
halfway points normally in hack since

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:34.800 
halfway points normally in hack since
usually<00:01:33.250> you<00:01:33.399> save<00:01:33.670> states<00:01:33.909> anyways<00:01:34.299> unless

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:34.810 
usually you save states anyways unless

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:36.300 
usually you save states anyways unless
you've<00:01:34.990> met<00:01:35.140> trying<00:01:35.350> to<00:01:35.409> make<00:01:35.530> a<00:01:35.560> legitimate

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 
you've met trying to make a legitimate

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.399 
you've met trying to make a legitimate
hack

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:45.319 

oh<00:01:40.469> gosh<00:01:42.469> what<00:01:43.469> the<00:01:43.729> let's<00:01:44.729> go<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:44.969> long<00:01:45.299> way

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
oh gosh what the let's go the long way

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.930

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:48.940 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:51.030 

we'll<00:01:49.360> work<00:01:49.540> this<00:01:49.690> time

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:51.040 
we'll work this time

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.360 
we'll work this time
I<00:01:51.100> guess<00:01:51.850> not<00:01:51.880> assess<00:01:52.660> Sam<00:01:53.110> and<00:01:53.500> I<00:01:53.980> can't

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:54.370 
I guess not assess Sam and I can't

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:56.520 
I guess not assess Sam and I can't
pretty<00:01:55.300> much<00:01:55.480> can't<00:01:55.930> move<00:01:56.140> from<00:01:56.380> this

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:56.530 
pretty much can't move from this

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:05.860 
pretty much can't move from this
position<00:01:56.800> to<00:01:57.370> the<00:01:57.490> right<00:01:59.400> huh<00:02:02.460> all<00:02:03.460> right

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:05.870

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.220 

well<00:02:11.750> pretty<00:02:12.439> much<00:02:12.620> sambuca<00:02:13.489> play<00:02:14.420> test<00:02:14.989> your

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
well pretty much sambuca play test your

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.000 
well pretty much sambuca play test your
levels<00:02:15.829> and<00:02:16.069> your<00:02:16.280> hack<00:02:16.549> I<00:02:17.439> mean<00:02:18.439> you<00:02:18.799> gotta

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
levels and your hack I mean you gotta

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.679 
levels and your hack I mean you gotta
consider<00:02:19.400> that<00:02:19.730> when<00:02:20.000> he<00:02:20.120> make<00:02:20.269> changes<00:02:20.629> to

00:02:20.679 --> 00:02:20.689 
consider that when he make changes to

00:02:20.689 --> 00:02:24.490 
consider that when he make changes to
the<00:02:20.930> overworld<00:02:21.879> he<00:02:22.879> can't<00:02:23.180> just<00:02:23.269> go<00:02:23.989> and<00:02:24.019> load

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
the overworld he can't just go and load

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.500 
the overworld he can't just go and load
a<00:02:24.530> safe<00:02:24.859> state<00:02:25.099> and<00:02:25.250> be<00:02:25.370> like<00:02:25.489> oh<00:02:25.670> it<00:02:25.849> works<00:02:26.060> no

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
a safe state and be like oh it works no

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:27.849 
a safe state and be like oh it works no
you<00:02:27.170> have<00:02:27.290> to<00:02:27.379> start<00:02:27.620> from<00:02:27.650> the<00:02:27.829> very

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:27.859 
you have to start from the very

00:02:27.859 --> 00:02:30.490 
you have to start from the very
beginning<00:02:28.760> sometimes<00:02:29.239> in<00:02:29.510> order<00:02:29.629> to<00:02:29.900> see<00:02:30.260> the

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
beginning sometimes in order to see the

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.319 
beginning sometimes in order to see the
new<00:02:30.769> changes<00:02:31.219> that<00:02:31.549> applies<00:02:31.849> to<00:02:32.120> the

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:32.329 
new changes that applies to the
