00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
to quickscope while effectively but you

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.609 
to quickscope while effectively but you

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
quickly and you could take a shot even

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:58.039 
quickly and you could take a shot even
though<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.479> bullet<00:01:57.689> will<00:01:57.810> go<00:01:57.840> in<00:01:57.990> a

though the bullet will go in a
completely<00:01:58.409> random<00:01:58.799> direction<00:01:59.549> you<00:01:59.790> can

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
realized that for some odd reason I

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:17.580 
realized that for some odd reason I
don't<00:02:16.510> know<00:02:16.720> if<00:02:16.840> it's<00:02:16.959> because<00:02:17.110> it's<00:02:17.380> not<00:02:17.440> the

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.070 
but considering that your screen shakes
all<00:02:33.790> over<00:02:34.000> the<00:02:34.090> place<00:02:34.270> when<00:02:34.390> you<00:02:34.510> get<00:02:34.600> shot<00:02:34.900> and

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
all over the place when you get shot and

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.120 
all over the place when you get shot and
things<00:02:35.260> like<00:02:35.380> that<00:02:35.560> it<00:02:35.680> makes<00:02:35.709> it<00:02:35.980> very

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
things like that it makes it very

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.100 
things like that it makes it very
difficult<00:02:36.489> to<00:02:36.880> do<00:02:37.120> which<00:02:37.330> is<00:02:37.360> why<00:02:37.569> I<00:02:37.600> say<00:02:37.930> that

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
difficult to do which is why I say that

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:39.870 
difficult to do which is why I say that
quickscoping<00:02:38.890> is<00:02:39.040> not<00:02:39.190> very<00:02:39.400> efficient<00:02:39.819> on

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
quickscoping is not very efficient on

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.490 
quickscoping is not very efficient on
the<00:02:40.000> game<00:02:40.150> you<00:02:40.360> can<00:02:40.540> quickscope<00:02:41.019> them<00:02:41.230> I<00:02:41.319> saw

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
the game you can quickscope them I saw

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.050 
the game you can quickscope them I saw

trailer and the multiplayer and things

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.140 
trailer and the multiplayer and things
like<00:02:44.739> that<00:02:44.980> because<00:02:45.370> there<00:02:45.550> wasn't<00:02:45.790> any

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
like that because there wasn't any

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:47.759 
like that because there wasn't any
sleight<00:02:46.569> of<00:02:46.600> hand<00:02:46.989> or<00:02:47.170> anything<00:02:47.380> in<00:02:47.560> the<00:02:47.650> game

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:47.769 
sleight of hand or anything in the game

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:49.559 
sleight of hand or anything in the game
because<00:02:47.980> the<00:02:48.160> scope<00:02:48.400> was<00:02:48.550> coming<00:02:48.940> in<00:02:49.090> slowly

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:49.569 
because the scope was coming in slowly

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:51.449 
because the scope was coming in slowly
for<00:02:50.050> advanced<00:02:50.470> warfare<00:02:50.500> people<00:02:51.220> were<00:02:51.280> saying

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
for advanced warfare people were saying

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:53.400 
for advanced warfare people were saying
that<00:02:51.580> oh<00:02:51.640> thank<00:02:52.060> god<00:02:52.269> quick<00:02:52.540> scoping<00:02:52.870> is<00:02:52.959> gone

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
that oh thank god quick scoping is gone

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.140 
that oh thank god quick scoping is gone
wait<00:02:53.530> scoping<00:02:53.890> does<00:02:54.040> not<00:02:54.220> require<00:02:54.670> sleight<00:02:55.120> of

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
wait scoping does not require sleight of

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:01.550 
wait scoping does not require sleight of
hand<00:02:55.510> that's<00:02:55.750> just<00:02:55.989> stupid<00:02:56.200> the<00:02:56.440> fucking<00:02:56.769> same

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:11.009 

that<00:03:02.560> fucking<00:03:03.250> accuracy<00:03:04.060> though<00:03:09.930> it<00:03:10.930> would

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:11.019 
that fucking accuracy though it would

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:12.420 
that fucking accuracy though it would
have<00:03:11.110> been<00:03:11.200> terrible<00:03:11.590> but<00:03:11.709> so<00:03:12.250> if<00:03:12.310> you're

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489 
trying to get on it and snipe it's gonna

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:17.160 
trying to get on it and snipe it's gonna
take<00:03:15.730> some<00:03:15.880> getting<00:03:15.910> used<00:03:16.269> to<00:03:16.360> but<00:03:16.450> it's<00:03:16.959> not

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
take some getting used to but it's not
