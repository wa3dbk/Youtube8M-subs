from the continent and obviously once

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.260

begins<00:01:15.869> so<00:01:16.560> we<00:01:16.830> were<00:01:16.950> left<00:01:17.159> as<00:01:17.490> a<00:01:17.580> country<00:01:18.060> to

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
begins so we were left as a country to

begins so we were left as a country to
trying<00:01:19.320> to<00:01:19.380> grow<00:01:19.590> them<00:01:19.740> ourselves<00:01:19.860> and<00:01:20.490> that's

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
trying to grow them ourselves and that's

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.080 
trying to grow them ourselves and that's
again<00:01:21.720> where<00:01:22.140> allotments<00:01:22.950> became<00:01:23.340> really

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
again where allotments became really

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.090 
again where allotments became really
useful<00:01:24.600> because<00:01:25.020> that's<00:01:25.259> where<00:01:25.530> most<00:01:25.770> of

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
about 50 minutes so that the vegetables

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.910 
about 50 minutes so that the vegetables
are<00:02:27.540> soft<00:02:29.150> but<00:02:30.150> once<00:02:30.360> the<00:02:30.690> vegetables<00:02:31.680> have

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
are soft but once the vegetables have

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.559 
are soft but once the vegetables have
softened<00:02:32.220> through<00:02:33.830> and<00:02:34.830> then<00:02:35.069> need<00:02:35.580> to<00:02:35.610> add

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
softened through and then need to add

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:45.259 
softened through and then need to add
them<00:02:36.810> to<00:02:37.940> the<00:02:39.680> pie<00:02:40.680> dish<00:02:43.940> final<00:02:44.940> thing<00:02:45.060> to<00:02:45.150> add

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269 
them to the pie dish final thing to add

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:46.610 
them to the pie dish final thing to add
is<00:02:45.420> some<00:02:45.450> herbs<00:02:45.930> just<00:02:46.200> to<00:02:46.350> give<00:02:46.470> it<00:02:46.500> that

is some herbs just to give it that

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.289 
is some herbs just to give it that
little<00:02:46.769> bit<00:02:47.100> of<00:02:47.130> extra<00:02:47.280> taste<00:02:47.640> now<00:02:48.239> the

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:48.299 
little bit of extra taste now the

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:50.360 
little bit of extra taste now the
recipes<00:02:48.810> I've<00:02:48.959> seen<00:02:49.260> for<00:02:49.530> the<00:02:49.590> period<00:02:49.950> show

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
recipes I've seen for the period show

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.460 
recipes I've seen for the period show
that<00:02:50.640> people<00:02:50.970> were<00:02:51.180> tending<00:02:51.480> to<00:02:51.600> use<00:02:51.810> parsley

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
that people were tending to use parsley

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.890 
that people were tending to use parsley
in<00:02:53.010> this<00:02:53.400> recipe<00:02:54.060> I'm<00:02:54.330> going<00:02:54.360> to<00:02:54.569> put<00:02:54.750> in

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
in this recipe I'm going to put in

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:00.050 
in this recipe I'm going to put in
instead<00:02:55.620> some<00:02:56.280> chives<00:02:56.870> some<00:02:57.870> thyme<00:02:58.620> and<00:02:59.060> some

rosemary<00:03:00.120> and<00:03:00.870> we'll<00:03:00.959> just<00:03:01.080> sprinkle<00:03:01.349> them<00:03:01.680> in

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:06.680 
rosemary and we'll just sprinkle them in
to<00:03:02.549> the<00:03:02.640> top<00:03:02.880> of<00:03:03.450> the<00:03:03.630> dish<00:03:03.810> and<00:03:05.420> finally<00:03:06.420> we've

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
to the top of the dish and finally we've

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.380 
to the top of the dish and finally we've
got<00:03:06.720> to<00:03:07.049> add<00:03:07.200> the<00:03:07.590> topping<00:03:08.130> which<00:03:08.640> is<00:03:08.880> made

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
got to add the topping which is made

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.470 
got to add the topping which is made
from<00:03:09.720> wholemeal<00:03:10.560> pastry<00:03:11.220> and<00:03:11.910> now<00:03:12.060> comeall

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
from wholemeal pastry and now comeall

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.930 
from wholemeal pastry and now comeall
flour<00:03:12.780> is<00:03:13.140> very<00:03:13.620> important<00:03:14.609> for<00:03:14.700> in<00:03:14.850> the

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
flour is very important for in the

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:15.800 
flour is very important for in the
Second<00:03:15.209> World<00:03:15.269> War

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
Second World War

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.750 
Second World War
white<00:03:16.500> flour<00:03:16.799> was<00:03:17.010> virtually<00:03:17.489> unavailable

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
white flour was virtually unavailable

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.670 
white flour was virtually unavailable
and<00:03:18.359> at<00:03:18.480> some<00:03:18.780> point<00:03:19.019> of<00:03:19.170> the<00:03:19.230> government<00:03:19.560> did

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
and at some point of the government did

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.920 
and at some point of the government did
actually<00:03:19.980> ban<00:03:20.130> the<00:03:20.280> production<00:03:20.400> of<00:03:20.930> white

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
actually ban the production of white

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.710 
actually ban the production of white
flour<00:03:22.320> but<00:03:23.070> we<00:03:23.489> have<00:03:23.609> a<00:03:23.640> slight<00:03:24.239> problem<00:03:24.450> when

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
flour but we have a slight problem when

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.050 
flour but we have a slight problem when
I<00:03:24.750> made<00:03:25.019> this<00:03:25.200> because<00:03:25.470> we<00:03:26.370> actually<00:03:26.730> ended<00:03:26.940> up

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
I made this because we actually ended up

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.849 
I made this because we actually ended up
using<00:03:27.329> three<00:03:28.079> ounces<00:03:28.590> of<00:03:28.859> our<00:03:29.280> cooking<00:03:29.850> fats

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:30.859 
using three ounces of our cooking fats

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:36.199 
using three ounces of our cooking fats
and<00:03:32.359> overall<00:03:34.100> one<00:03:35.100> person<00:03:35.519> was<00:03:35.730> only<00:03:35.970> allowed

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
and overall one person was only allowed

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:38.990 
and overall one person was only allowed
typically<00:03:37.170> during<00:03:37.350> the<00:03:37.530> war<00:03:37.709> four<00:03:38.400> ounces<00:03:38.940> of

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
typically during the war four ounces of

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.599 
typically during the war four ounces of
cooking<00:03:39.630> fat<00:03:39.900> per<00:03:40.200> week<00:03:40.440> so<00:03:41.130> we're<00:03:41.370> gonna<00:03:41.489> have

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:41.609 
cooking fat per week so we're gonna have

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:43.670 
cooking fat per week so we're gonna have
to<00:03:41.670> be<00:03:41.730> very<00:03:41.760> careful<00:03:42.569> with<00:03:42.750> the<00:03:42.900> way<00:03:42.930> that<00:03:43.560> we

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
to be very careful with the way that we

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.150 
to be very careful with the way that we
use<00:03:43.889> our<00:03:44.160> cooking<00:03:44.549> fat<00:03:44.790> in<00:03:45.359> future<00:03:46.100> this<00:03:47.100> is

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
use our cooking fat in future this is

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.819 
use our cooking fat in future this is
the<00:03:47.670> final<00:03:48.660> product<00:03:48.900> waiting<00:03:49.319> to<00:03:49.410> go<00:03:49.500> into<00:03:49.650> the

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:49.829 
the final product waiting to go into the

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:51.920 
the final product waiting to go into the
oven<00:03:49.950> looks<00:03:50.819> a<00:03:50.880> bit<00:03:50.910> rough<00:03:51.150> enough<00:03:51.389> already

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
oven looks a bit rough enough already

00:03:51.930 --> 00:04:04.920 
oven looks a bit rough enough already
but<00:03:52.579> here<00:03:53.579> goes

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.289 

well<00:04:05.890> this<00:04:06.220> is<00:04:06.340> the<00:04:06.459> moment<00:04:06.610> of<00:04:06.790> truth<00:04:06.849> my

00:04:07.289 --> 00:04:07.299 
well this is the moment of truth my

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:24.750 
well this is the moment of truth my
first<00:04:08.079> wartime<00:04:08.620> recipe<00:04:09.099> and<00:04:09.450> yeah<00:04:10.450> goes

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:24.760 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:31.680 

so<00:04:25.360> it<00:04:25.510> sounds<00:04:25.780> good<00:04:30.330> what<00:04:31.330> I'm<00:04:31.390> going<00:04:31.480> to<00:04:31.540> do

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:31.690 
so it sounds good what I'm going to do

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:35.160 
so it sounds good what I'm going to do
is<00:04:31.840> put<00:04:32.050> on<00:04:32.140> a<00:04:32.170> bit<00:04:32.410> of<00:04:33.540> gravy<00:04:34.540> that<00:04:34.870> would<00:04:34.990> make

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:35.170 
is put on a bit of gravy that would make

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:36.720 
is put on a bit of gravy that would make
a<00:04:35.200> bit<00:04:35.500> of<00:04:35.530> the<00:04:35.740> juice<00:04:35.950> that<00:04:35.980> was<00:04:36.280> left<00:04:36.580> over

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:36.730 
a bit of the juice that was left over

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:41.250 
a bit of the juice that was left over
it's<00:04:37.480> a<00:04:37.600> bit<00:04:37.750> of<00:04:38.880> vegetable<00:04:39.880> stock<00:04:40.360> vegetable

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:41.260 
it's a bit of vegetable stock vegetable

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:50.179 
it's a bit of vegetable stock vegetable
powder<00:04:43.080> right<00:04:44.080> here<00:04:44.500> we<00:04:44.620> go

00:04:50.179 --> 00:04:50.189 

00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:54.420 

no<00:04:51.189> actually

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:54.430 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:56.480 

Oh

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:56.490 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:04.330 

very<00:04:57.240> hot<00:04:57.600> Oh

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:04.340 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:06.159 

but<00:05:04.940> actually<00:05:05.330> this<00:05:05.540> has<00:05:05.690> come<00:05:05.870> out<00:05:05.930> rather

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:06.169 
but actually this has come out rather

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:10.530 
but actually this has come out rather
well<00:05:06.320> so<00:05:07.040> I<00:05:07.310> think<00:05:08.270> we<00:05:09.020> have<00:05:09.260> a<00:05:09.560> wartime

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:10.540 
well so I think we have a wartime

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:13.540 
well so I think we have a wartime
success
