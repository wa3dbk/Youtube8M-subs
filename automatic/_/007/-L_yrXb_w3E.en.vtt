00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.269
 the court win lose restart i want 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:17.539
 I want to play winning, so I said 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:24.150
 remember and win if you lose you will have to 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:31.140
 restart record gains this will benny 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:36.200
 have to restart a record wins and if 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:41.910
 losing will have to restart the record 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:45.030
 to win and I have to restart 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:58.890
 I think I was a little bit on the agenda. 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:01:01.289
 It's not easy to go back and by the bond 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.160
 walking and this is the intelligence channel 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.379
 artificial 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.640
 Are you missing games here? 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.430
 huh 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.250
 I do not know if I think about it then. 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.090
 I selected five saving games from 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.920
 rows 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.360
 those you do not need more than 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.689
 two minutes to understand what 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:21.090
 passes and saved ground in a row the 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:23.759
 games are available for android is the 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.820
 s only one that is not available for 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:29.549
 but four games already gives bread 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.119
 legal investment then prepared 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.119
 traction 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:41.850
 ok it's a simple but strategist game 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:44.579
 You need to think how to hit a 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.040
 single stroke all shapes 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:50.130
 each concluding phase will be included 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.869
 new challenges at first glance the game is 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.689
 simple but after a few minutes 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:57.420
 playing I started to think that maybe the 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:02:01.259
 developer has not tested all phases 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:03.570
 it's not because in this game you control 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.610
 a square spider 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.220
 so the name of this square parent 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:12.110
 even the name of the place is called 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:14.300
 Square ground up to support for high 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.250
 khar on the screen in the course of the phase you 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:19.520
 will touch that it resembles a little 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:22.010
 flash dynamics adds another great 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:25.400
 game of the newly released ket rapee which is the 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:27.920
 is the premise is that it does not touch the edges and 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.740
 collect the maximum points by increasing the 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:33.230
 size of the tail in the game over with 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:36.350
 the amount of gems collected you 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:39.440
 can exchange for new ping pong heads 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:42.560
 it's a different swing is a pink style 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:45.560
 monkey pink good point goes back and forth 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:48.530
 to the same place however you need 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:51.410
 divert squares for this touch on 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:54.290
 screen to decelerate the point and 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:57.020
 on the speed will increase smo 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.890
 exercise your attention a good trail 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:00.560
 sound 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.810
 you are inside a cubicle that 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.000
 It looks like a game of old and what you 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:07.730
 You have to get the points without 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.570
 hit by any of the balls that are 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.790
 on my way 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:13.700
 as always the first levels are well 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:15.950
 calm a ball there another here but 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:18.410
