00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
thinking of it's a great brainstorm to

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.249 
thinking of it's a great brainstorm to
get<00:01:44.399> you<00:01:44.520> thinking<00:01:44.880> of<00:01:45.000> pages<00:01:45.750> that<00:01:46.049> you<00:01:46.140> might

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
get you thinking of pages that you might

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.340 
get you thinking of pages that you might
not<00:01:46.380> have<00:01:46.470> thought<00:01:46.530> of<00:01:46.710> okay<00:01:47.450> so<00:01:48.450> but<00:01:49.110> you<00:01:49.200> can

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
not have thought of okay so but you can

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:50.960 
not have thought of okay so but you can
actually<00:01:49.500> go<00:01:49.770> much<00:01:50.040> much<00:01:50.220> deeper<00:01:50.490> than<00:01:50.790> this

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
actually go much much deeper than this

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.590 
actually go much much deeper than this
for<00:01:51.869> example<00:01:52.350> you<00:01:52.590> could<00:01:52.890> do<00:01:53.040> something<00:01:53.310> like

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
for example you could do something like

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.179 
for example you could do something like
pages<00:01:54.600> like<00:01:54.780> by<00:01:55.020> people<00:01:55.350> who<00:01:55.470> like<00:01:55.680> think<00:01:56.009> and

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
pages like by people who like think and

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:04.880 
pages like by people who like think and
grow<00:01:56.280> rich<00:01:56.369> and<00:01:57.049> our<00:01:58.399> small<00:01:59.399> business<00:01:59.850> owners

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.830 

so<00:02:05.400> pages<00:02:05.729> like<00:02:05.940> the<00:02:06.060> people<00:02:06.270> who<00:02:06.360> like<00:02:06.510> think

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
so pages like the people who like think

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.809 
so pages like the people who like think
earth<00:02:07.020> and<00:02:07.369> small<00:02:08.369> business<00:02:08.700> owners<00:02:08.940> okay<00:02:09.240> so

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:10.819 
earth and small business owners okay so

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:13.309 
earth and small business owners okay so

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
you go down and it's going to be pretty

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.130 
you go down and it's going to be pretty
similar<00:02:13.709> stuff<00:02:14.670> for<00:02:14.850> that<00:02:15.000> one<00:02:15.209> but<00:02:15.780> let's<00:02:15.959> do

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
similar stuff for that one but let's do

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:21.190 
similar stuff for that one but let's do
something<00:02:16.560> like<00:02:19.520> how<00:02:20.520> about<00:02:20.670> something<00:02:20.910> like

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200
