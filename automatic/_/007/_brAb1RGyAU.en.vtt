pulling that off and once that's off I'm
just<00:03:54.350> going<00:03:54.620> to<00:03:54.650> do<00:03:54.799> that<00:03:54.920> very<00:03:54.980> quickly<00:03:55.370> but

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:55.700 
just going to do that very quickly but

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:57.640 
just going to do that very quickly but
once<00:03:55.910> that's<00:03:56.180> off<00:03:56.390> you're<00:03:56.930> going<00:03:57.110> to<00:03:57.200> go<00:03:57.350> back

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 
once that's off you're going to go back

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:00.640 
once that's off you're going to go back
and<00:03:57.950> take<00:03:58.220> your<00:03:58.519> Christmas<00:03:58.880> tree<00:03:59.510> fold<00:04:00.350> this

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
and take your Christmas tree fold this

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:04.120 
and take your Christmas tree fold this
in<00:04:00.950> half<00:04:00.980> and<00:04:01.930> this<00:04:02.930> will<00:04:03.230> create<00:04:03.680> a

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:04.130 
in half and this will create a

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:06.550 
in half and this will create a
dimensional<00:04:04.970> tree<00:04:05.420> for<00:04:05.810> your<00:04:05.900> Christmas<00:04:06.320> card

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
dimensional tree for your Christmas card

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.050 
dimensional tree for your Christmas card
now<00:04:06.650> what<00:04:06.799> I<00:04:06.830> like<00:04:07.040> about<00:04:07.190> this<00:04:07.459> technique<00:04:07.880> is

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 
now what I like about this technique is

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.030 
now what I like about this technique is
the<00:04:08.090> fact<00:04:08.450> that<00:04:08.570> you<00:04:09.110> can<00:04:09.290> flatten<00:04:09.590> the<00:04:09.799> tree

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 
the fact that you can flatten the tree

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:11.800 
the fact that you can flatten the tree
back<00:04:10.340> down<00:04:10.640> when<00:04:10.850> you're<00:04:11.000> mailing<00:04:11.269> this<00:04:11.540> so<00:04:11.720> it

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:11.810 
back down when you're mailing this so it

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:13.390 
back down when you're mailing this so it
makes<00:04:11.989> it<00:04:12.080> really<00:04:12.260> nice<00:04:12.500> so<00:04:13.130> if<00:04:13.250> you're

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.400 
makes it really nice so if you're

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.460 
makes it really nice so if you're
wanting<00:04:13.640> to<00:04:13.700> do<00:04:13.910> a<00:04:13.940> tree<00:04:14.209> like<00:04:14.390> this<00:04:14.720> this<00:04:15.320> is

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:15.470 
wanting to do a tree like this this is

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:16.870 
wanting to do a tree like this this is
an<00:04:15.590> all<00:04:15.739> pulled<00:04:16.040> out<00:04:16.160> yet<00:04:16.340> but<00:04:16.459> I<00:04:16.519> just<00:04:16.549> want<00:04:16.850> to

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 
an all pulled out yet but I just want to

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.780 
an all pulled out yet but I just want to
show<00:04:17.060> you<00:04:17.150> really<00:04:17.329> quickly<00:04:17.989> how<00:04:18.290> you<00:04:18.320> glue<00:04:19.010> the

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:19.790 
show you really quickly how you glue the

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:23.320 
show you really quickly how you glue the
backs<00:04:20.180> together<00:04:20.870> to<00:04:21.620> create<00:04:22.330> this

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:23.330 
backs together to create this

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.230 
backs together to create this
dimensional<00:04:24.020> tree<00:04:24.890> so<00:04:25.669> this<00:04:25.820> one's<00:04:26.000> pretty

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 
dimensional tree so this one's pretty

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.839 
dimensional tree so this one's pretty
easy<00:04:26.300> to<00:04:26.720> fold<00:04:26.960> in<00:04:27.140> half<00:04:27.410> so<00:04:27.740> what<00:04:28.370> you<00:04:28.490> do<00:04:28.700> is

00:04:28.839 --> 00:04:28.849 
easy to fold in half so what you do is

00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:31.540 
easy to fold in half so what you do is
put<00:04:29.060> your<00:04:29.120> glue<00:04:29.539> on<00:04:29.780> this<00:04:30.050> side<00:04:30.380> and<00:04:30.620> then<00:04:31.190> put

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550 
put your glue on this side and then put

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:33.080 
put your glue on this side and then put
one<00:04:31.940> tree

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.090 
one tree

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:34.370 
one tree
to<00:04:33.210> the<00:04:33.360> back<00:04:33.540> of<00:04:33.750> this<00:04:33.870> and<00:04:33.930> just<00:04:34.139> make<00:04:34.350> sure

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.380 
to the back of this and just make sure

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:37.010 
to the back of this and just make sure
that<00:04:34.560> that<00:04:34.710> is<00:04:34.949> lined<00:04:35.280> up<00:04:35.430> properly<00:04:35.490> and<00:04:36.180> when

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
that that is lined up properly and when

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:38.600 
that that is lined up properly and when
I'm<00:04:37.169> doing<00:04:37.350> a<00:04:37.530> tree<00:04:37.800> like<00:04:37.980> this

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
I'm doing a tree like this

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:41.330 
I'm doing a tree like this
I'm<00:04:38.970> usually<00:04:39.419> its<00:04:40.169> cutting<00:04:40.650> out<00:04:40.860> five

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
I'm usually its cutting out five

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:43.670 
I'm usually its cutting out five
Christmas<00:04:42.180> trees<00:04:42.510> so<00:04:42.960> this<00:04:43.139> makes<00:04:43.410> it<00:04:43.530> you

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 
Christmas trees so this makes it you

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.100 
Christmas trees so this makes it you
really<00:04:44.010> have<00:04:44.040> a<00:04:44.639> very<00:04:45.270> dimensional<00:04:45.630> tree<00:04:45.990> so

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.110 
really have a very dimensional tree so

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:47.570 
really have a very dimensional tree so
you<00:04:46.229> can<00:04:46.350> play<00:04:46.560> with<00:04:46.770> that<00:04:46.800> and<00:04:47.130> see<00:04:47.190> what

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580 
you can play with that and see what

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:52.700 
you can play with that and see what
works<00:04:47.790> great<00:04:48.210> for<00:04:48.240> you<00:04:51.020> the<00:04:52.020> Christmas<00:04:52.290> points

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
works great for you the Christmas points

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:53.930 
works great for you the Christmas points
that<00:04:52.800> it<00:04:52.889> comes<00:04:53.100> in<00:04:53.220> the<00:04:53.310> seasons<00:04:53.669> of<00:04:53.790> joy

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:53.940 
that it comes in the seasons of joy

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:55.670 
that it comes in the seasons of joy
collection<00:04:54.419> I<00:04:54.540> absolutely<00:04:55.080> love<00:04:55.500> this

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680 
collection I absolutely love this

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.620 
collection I absolutely love this
poinsettia<00:04:56.190> because<00:04:56.490> you<00:04:56.729> can<00:04:56.940> stamp<00:04:57.330> this

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:57.630 
poinsettia because you can stamp this

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:00.290 
poinsettia because you can stamp this
image<00:04:58.110> on<00:04:58.470> a<00:04:58.530> background<00:04:59.070> like<00:04:59.490> I<00:04:59.610> did<00:04:59.820> here

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:00.300 
image on a background like I did here

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.120 
image on a background like I did here
and<00:05:00.419> then<00:05:01.080> you<00:05:01.260> can<00:05:01.440> cut<00:05:01.710> it<00:05:01.800> out<00:05:01.919> with<00:05:02.100> a

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:02.130 
and then you can cut it out with a

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:04.010 
and then you can cut it out with a
sun-kissed<00:05:02.490> floor<00:05:03.030> die<00:05:03.210> this<00:05:03.479> makes<00:05:03.750> it<00:05:03.930> you

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020 
sun-kissed floor die this makes it you

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.170 
sun-kissed floor die this makes it you
have<00:05:04.169> ten<00:05:04.530> flowers<00:05:05.010> two<00:05:05.280> leaves<00:05:05.550> cut<00:05:05.880> out<00:05:06.000> with

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:06.180 
have ten flowers two leaves cut out with

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:08.750 
have ten flowers two leaves cut out with
one<00:05:06.450> pass<00:05:06.690> of<00:05:06.960> the<00:05:07.020> machine<00:05:07.110> so<00:05:08.040> to<00:05:08.100> line<00:05:08.460> those

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:08.760 
one pass of the machine so to line those

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:10.700 
one pass of the machine so to line those
up<00:05:08.790> after<00:05:09.479> you've<00:05:09.660> stamped<00:05:10.229> your<00:05:10.320> image

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:10.710 
up after you've stamped your image

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:13.129 
up after you've stamped your image
you're<00:05:11.370> going<00:05:11.700> to<00:05:11.910> lift<00:05:12.210> up<00:05:12.419> this<00:05:12.570> die<00:05:12.780> now<00:05:12.960> I

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:13.139 
you're going to lift up this die now I

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:15.230 
you're going to lift up this die now I
made<00:05:13.440> a<00:05:13.470> template<00:05:14.040> if<00:05:14.250> you<00:05:14.520> don't<00:05:14.850> know<00:05:15.030> how<00:05:15.180> to

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:15.240 
made a template if you don't know how to

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:16.640 
made a template if you don't know how to
make<00:05:15.389> this<00:05:15.540> template<00:05:15.930> watch<00:05:16.110> the<00:05:16.380> video

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:16.650 
make this template watch the video

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:18.680 
make this template watch the video
called<00:05:16.919> matching<00:05:17.580> the<00:05:17.700> stamps<00:05:18.120> and<00:05:18.240> dies<00:05:18.419> and

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:18.690 
called matching the stamps and dies and

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:20.690 
called matching the stamps and dies and
that<00:05:18.840> will<00:05:19.020> give<00:05:19.290> you<00:05:19.470> the<00:05:19.950> instructions<00:05:20.280> for

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:20.700 
that will give you the instructions for

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:22.670 
that will give you the instructions for
the<00:05:20.760> template<00:05:21.150> but<00:05:21.330> basically<00:05:21.840> you'll<00:05:22.410> just

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:22.680 
the template but basically you'll just

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.100 
the template but basically you'll just
line<00:05:23.010> this<00:05:23.310> up<00:05:23.610> and<00:05:23.970> you<00:05:24.570> can<00:05:24.720> see<00:05:24.930> exactly

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:25.110 
line this up and you can see exactly

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:26.960 
line this up and you can see exactly
where<00:05:25.800> that's<00:05:25.979> going<00:05:26.220> to<00:05:26.340> cut<00:05:26.700> out<00:05:26.940> your

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:26.970 
where that's going to cut out your

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:29.659 
where that's going to cut out your
stamped<00:05:27.870> image<00:05:28.169> then<00:05:28.740> we'll<00:05:28.919> flop<00:05:29.160> that<00:05:29.370> down

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:29.669 
stamped image then we'll flop that down

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:32.000 
stamped image then we'll flop that down
press<00:05:30.000> the<00:05:30.210> tape<00:05:30.419> down<00:05:30.630> on<00:05:30.780> the<00:05:30.900> side<00:05:31.139> run<00:05:31.830> this

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:32.010 
press the tape down on the side run this

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:33.590 
press the tape down on the side run this
through<00:05:32.310> the<00:05:32.460> machine<00:05:32.880> and<00:05:33.120> you<00:05:33.240> have<00:05:33.419> those

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:33.600 
through the machine and you have those
