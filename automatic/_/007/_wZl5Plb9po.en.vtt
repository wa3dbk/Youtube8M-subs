00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.760 

pinning<00:02:24.890> it<00:02:25.420> going<00:02:26.420> fast<00:02:26.780> and<00:02:27.230> feeling<00:02:27.650> good

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.360 
and I guess there's nothing that
compares<00:02:31.550> to<00:02:31.820> that<00:02:31.880> feeling<00:02:32.270> in<00:02:32.360> the<00:02:32.420> world

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
compares to that feeling in the world

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.370 
compares to that feeling in the world
yeah
