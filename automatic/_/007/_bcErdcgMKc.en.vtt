I<00:00:31.580> see<00:00:32.029> awesome<00:00:32.329> about<00:00:32.509> this<00:00:32.689> particular

I see awesome about this particular
dream<00:00:33.500> which<00:00:33.739> is<00:00:34.150> something<00:00:35.150> I've<00:00:35.390> been

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:35.420 
dream which is something I've been

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.020 
dream which is something I've been
looking<00:00:35.780> for<00:00:35.989> for<00:00:36.020> a<00:00:36.199> long<00:00:36.350> time<00:00:36.620> and<00:00:37.030> and

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.030 
looking for for a long time and and

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:39.939 
looking for for a long time and and
there's<00:00:38.660> a<00:00:38.840> couple<00:00:39.079> of<00:00:39.230> scientists<00:00:39.739> that<00:00:39.770> have

00:00:39.939 --> 00:00:39.949 
there's a couple of scientists that have

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:42.220 
there's a couple of scientists that have
been<00:00:40.100> working<00:00:40.460> on<00:00:40.610> this<00:00:40.760> and<00:00:41.110> we're<00:00:42.110> gonna

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:42.230 
been working on this and we're gonna

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.560 
been working on this and we're gonna
collect<00:00:42.530> some<00:00:42.650> fun<00:00:43.220> clips<00:00:43.339> so<00:00:43.910> they<00:00:44.059> can<00:00:44.239> do<00:00:44.390> do

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:44.570 
collect some fun clips so they can do do

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.380 
collect some fun clips so they can do do
some<00:00:44.750> genetics<00:00:45.350> on<00:00:46.070> it<00:00:46.220> and<00:00:46.489> it's<00:00:47.000> going<00:00:47.180> to<00:00:47.239> be

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:47.390 
some genetics on it and it's going to be

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:49.299 
some genetics on it and it's going to be
described<00:00:47.780> as<00:00:47.989> a<00:00:48.350> new<00:00:48.559> species<00:00:48.830> so<00:00:49.160> it's<00:00:49.250> very

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:49.309 
described as a new species so it's very

00:00:49.309 --> 00:01:46.060 
described as a new species so it's very
exciting

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.450 

this<00:01:47.070> is<00:01:47.220> one<00:01:47.400> of<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:47.610> three<00:01:47.820> mother<00:01:49.310> there<00:01:50.310> is

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
this is one of the three mother there is

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.030 
this is one of the three mother there is
a<00:01:50.490> better<00:01:51.390> person<00:01:51.840> but<00:01:52.350> this<00:01:52.500> is<00:01:52.680> one<00:01:52.830> of<00:01:52.860> the

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
a better person but this is one of the

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.000 
a better person but this is one of the
species<00:01:53.250> that<00:01:53.610> we've<00:01:54.320> really<00:01:55.320> wanted<00:01:55.440> to<00:01:55.680> come

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:56.010 
species that we've really wanted to come

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:57.260 
species that we've really wanted to come
here<00:01:56.130> to<00:01:56.340> try<00:01:56.520> and<00:01:56.640> catch<00:01:56.850> it

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
here to try and catch it

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.230 
here to try and catch it
apparently<00:01:58.020> undocumented<00:01:58.680> and<00:01:59.130> there<00:02:00.120> is

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
apparently undocumented and there is

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.320 
apparently undocumented and there is
what<00:02:00.450> a<00:02:00.480> whole<00:02:00.690> kids<00:02:01.440> detect<00:02:01.860> genetic<00:02:02.340> thing

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:03.330 
what a whole kids detect genetic thing

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.170 
what a whole kids detect genetic thing
slips<00:02:03.630> at<00:02:03.810> all

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.350 

the<00:02:07.180> beautiful<00:02:07.719> Bree<00:02:07.899> my<00:02:08.140> earnest<00:02:09.209> didn't<00:02:10.209> get

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
the beautiful Bree my earnest didn't get

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.479 
the beautiful Bree my earnest didn't get
any<00:02:10.509> on<00:02:10.599> the<00:02:10.810> spoon<00:02:11.080> but<00:02:11.290> this<00:02:12.220> plaque

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:12.489 
any on the spoon but this plaque

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:15.270 
any on the spoon but this plaque
definitely<00:02:13.150> worked<00:02:13.769> second<00:02:14.769> turnover<00:02:15.130> on

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
definitely worked second turnover on

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.540 
definitely worked second turnover on
Perry's<00:02:16.209> got<00:02:16.390> enough<00:02:16.630> samples<00:02:17.050> now<00:02:17.230> so<00:02:17.550> her

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
Perry's got enough samples now so her

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.180 
Perry's got enough samples now so her
let<00:02:18.790> this<00:02:18.910> boy<00:02:19.150> go
