00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:08.299
 on 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.730
 these management in the project are roaring simple 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.720
 Hello today on the review 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:34.970
 tractor t-150k 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:38.900
 and journal series tractor floor from 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:42.110
 collection number 11 this tractor we like 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:47.239
 could see lit up in the review andrew 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:51.440
 Rybakin and very famous reviewer he 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:54.170
 shot about him a video here and talked about 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.879
 this tractor but now we will 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.580
 talk not about it now we will 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:00.850
 speak for this model and the first thing I do 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:05.390
 wanna say we can pay attention 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:07.670
 the fact that this tractor is a later version 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.590
 because we can see what 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:15.200
 facing here later 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:19.130
 On the first tractors it was as on face as 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:22.070
 on crawler tractors T-150's but 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:25.820
 then with time it changed to 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:27.490
 such more square well let's 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:31.100
 move on to the model itself 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:33.740
 Well , the first thing I want to say is painting 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:37.880
 the models are quite self made me and therefore 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:42.289
 that no complaints can be said 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:45.020
 no, here everything is dyed all good 

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:48.710
 can see the window seals well 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:51.799
 stained every glass around it 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:54.340
 the seal is painted with nothing anywhere 0 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:56.990
 by on very all done neatly 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:59.810
 also can see what the parts department 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:02.060
 front lights are made and also want 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.939
 say that they are made exactly the lens and 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.679
 the skin of the lantern itself 

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:09.500
 made individual parts that is they and 

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:10.190
 not made just that silver 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.980
 covered 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:15.530
 painted everything happens sometimes 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:18.290
 Ashot collections 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.190
 small sidelights with turning with 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.460
 turn signals 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:24.740
 stained here and also painted 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:26.920
 here the grille and we can 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:30.130
 see what is still stamped here 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:32.510
 htz inscription 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:35.810
 can also see what's here 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:38.489
 separate the parts made the filter 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:42.659
 Here is then still separately detail and 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:46.829
 silver painted here muffler 

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:48.749
 mod but also made separate parts 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:52.109
 here the wipers are painted too 

00:02:48.749 --> 00:02:56.340
 silver and then another 10 hatch made 

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:58.079
 separate detail here but here these 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:01.500
 Here, for example, the steps are stamped 

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:03.870
 not bad very believable they 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.620
 they look like they are folded 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.889
 I also want to note that 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.650
 most 

00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:15.319
 models are made of metal that is 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:18.299
 the front is also a copure but the wings and 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:21.829
 that's exactly the back there already goes 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:24.900
 plastic footboard is made here not bad 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:26.760
 mirrors are made well want to note something 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.849
 that the rear mirror painted over here 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:32.430
 silver can also see the rear 

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:35.010
 lights here department details are made 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:38.790
 we can see what these lights here 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:40.829
 the United States painted over them also 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:43.500
 hitch itself here's how 

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:45.419
 looks very believable and by 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:49.620
 I will even do this part of mine 

00:03:45.419 --> 00:03:54.439
 separate from everything else if me 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:57.889
 It seems and also want to note that here 

00:03:54.439 --> 00:04:00.629
 very good discs are made in a very 

00:03:57.889 --> 00:04:05.280
 believable also tread wheels and 

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:09.030
 I also want to note the fact that before 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:11.459
 the output of the model that's gone a lot there 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:14.359
 photos of all sorts of things that are not 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:17.299
 turning back 

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:21.419
 tractors that is we can see what 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:24.990
 really turns and here but 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:29.009
 I have a few suspicions why 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:32.400
 this is the first suspicion that they would hardly 

00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:35.759
 wanted to make a turning point just 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:38.219
 they claim there or here 's the bolt 

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:40.560
 as we see just to concatenate 

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:43.800
 front and rear of the tractor and 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:46.290
 it all turned out that she also 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:49.820
 turn and I got them all 

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:52.889
 thought he was nice and type 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:55.919
 plus more and the model will be more 

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:58.470
 hype to buy this model well and 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:05:01.080
 the second is what could be ashot 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:03.750
 the collection really thought to 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:06.139
 the model sold more times 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:08.790
 did really be 

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:12.590
 swivel so you can say 

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:15.960
 although he would not call povak mechanism 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:17.250
 something like that most likely on him well 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:20.880
 and how would 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:23.580
 Cheap type made type swivel 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:26.400
 mechanism although I think it is just 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:29.639
 claim or back and front 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:31.470
 part bonded it bolton everything and everything as 

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:35.040
 would she turn but looks very 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:38.100
 even implausible I said if 

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:40.770
 look at the bottom well, so that's what you can 

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:43.020
 say days this is done kind of like 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:47.970
 not bad drive shaft there everything is fine 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:50.700
 In principle, here is what can be said for 

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:54.110
 salon and tractor t-150k 

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:57.840
 but quite like a tractor 

00:05:54.110 --> 00:06:00.740
 t-150 is quite a very reliable 

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:03.330
 made the instrument panel look like steering wheel and 

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:07.770
 driver's seat also levers 

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:10.350
 right there everything is one 

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:14.370
 the only thing that there is not firstly 

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:16.860
 decals made sensors all about that is 

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:19.080
 they just pro stamped in the panel but 

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:22.800
 decals haven't done the same 

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:25.080
 note exactly there is no 2 seat next to 

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:28.110
 the driver there it should be done 

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:31.590
 there is only one reason why but one 

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:34.770
 In principle, everything was fine for me 

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:37.919
 I'll show you again, let's see how he is 

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:39.620
 turns here like this 

00:06:37.919 --> 00:06:43.410
 bends 

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:46.860
 two sides well, so if you look 

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:49.479
 front and about like that and bent 

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:53.800
 then he goes but really look like 

00:06:49.479 --> 00:06:56.469
 how bends and so damn it look 

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:59.800
 on him there was an example like 

00:06:56.469 --> 00:07:02.349
 such as the bottom then you become fucking 

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:05.349
 Well, well, auto principle, I'll tell you what 

00:07:02.349 --> 00:07:08.650
 tractor did not like done everything 

00:07:05.349 --> 00:07:11.889
 perfect and painting and detailing 

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:14.409
 everything is made well 

00:07:11.889 --> 00:07:17.199
 That kind of money is no more words 

00:07:14.409 --> 00:07:20.669
 the tractor is just super but thanks everyone for 

00:07:17.199 --> 00:07:20.669
 browsing and bye
