 we see here the Sony Ericsson Cedar and this eco device has of course 

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:11.710
 Even a music player can first of all time its an integrated radio 

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:15.110
 and who put me up a 3q by five millimeter jack for headphones 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.079
 So far, of course, empty states are in the menu and now we have here 

00:00:20.079 --> 00:00:25.640
 Media Guard on it we have photos music video games ski tests and 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:26.929

 all of several books Portas Shenzhen niche or more and Year Zettel's lousy 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.010
 a special thing that it offers Sony Ericsson and indeed a function 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.820
 which makes it possible to have songs stored on the phone according to mood 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.840
 to sort through the one in which he crosses his coup the species 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:01.370
 Unilever single points meanwhile the respective songs her after mood 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.710
 be sorted 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.090
 you could ask for the shade 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.090
 never to all the stars 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.390

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:54.690
 mandatory 

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:13.150
 So whoever causes that women will not become very special we become 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.139
 the percent with the focus for months so you can then one 

00:02:16.139 --> 00:02:17.280
 Connect headphones 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.709
 and then you also have the option of getting your good signal 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:23.569
 So they have the opportunity with this difficult litters 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:26.900
 Play to back in the middle then to the right and left is tilt if I 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.620

 in the list 

00:02:52.089 --> 00:02:56.189

 Musicians man has his shopping spree the mania can connect and then percent 

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:04.499
