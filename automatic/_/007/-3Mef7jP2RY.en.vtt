00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:11.420
 instagram what video do you want for today and 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:13.310
 I'm going to choose between makeup without 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:16.100
 mirror that I personally have 

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:19.789
 very eager to do the test of the 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:22.609
 mascot and the majority by win was the 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:25.279
 is the mascot true so I 'll leave the 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:27.769
 of makeup without mirror for another 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:30.380
 occasion so well let's go with him live 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:32.419
 tag of the mascot for the first 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:36.550
 This question this is what it 's called your 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:36.550
 mascot pet that is here 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:41.490

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.920
 Looks is called 13 

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:49.160
 after finishing the camera my daughter that the 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.160
 see what you want 

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:56.969
 it's called 13 it's called 13 but with z the 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:00.690
 second question is what happens and what kind 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:03.449
 of good pets is a cat like 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:07.170
 can appreciate and the race is a 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:09.630
 mix between Siamese his mother was a 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.420
 Carving table chair is overwhelmed 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.670
 her mother Nancy Meza and her parents because 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:19.409
 You know it was from around but pass the foot 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:22.550
 and not leave that rafael so I tell him 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.550
 that is a Siamese mutt 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.960
 the third question of how many years 

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:31.049
 has and the truth that I do not know if you have two 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.539
 or three years so he took his his 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.159
 passport for pets that 

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:38.130
 is that I am very grateful that the 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:42.929
 have a passport and I do not know but in 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:45.740
 end the things in life as it is 2011 

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:45.740
 say that you have 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:53.130
 today was an old April 2011 11 12 14 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:55.409
 if three year or next year 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:59.340
 meets four the fourth question is how 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:01.950
 you had your pet the truth is that it is 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.689
 a story a bit sad because I 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.310
 before having this cat had another 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:07.409
 cat as well as if we have 13 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.030
 but it lasted me three days the truth is that 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.220
 they gave it to me very small very small very 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.319
 small and remember that I went back to 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.989
 I worked when they called me and they told me 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:18.019
 what data had died and I did not 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:19.380
 I could believe he was on the bus and 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:21.300
 said 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.790
 I was making a joke in bad taste 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.650
 how could it be that everything was fine 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.050
 and when I get home 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:31.920
 I was waiting for him not to be there and if 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:34.350
 I was dead then I remember 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.810
 that my father told me that he is involved 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:39.840
 the cat because another already already already already already 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:42.330
 nothing the week I went to a house a cottage 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:46.170
 that he had many cats have like eight 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:49.560
 novels I saw it was there was eight I kill and 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:51.320
 I saw it and said this is for me and I already 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.030
 I wanted bigger so I would not 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:57.360
 us and they returned it to martÃ­nez in my 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:59.460
 sister-in-law said that she got off on her luck 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:04.530
 that there was already his canary 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:07.250
 just as he always died but just as 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:10.740
 same way and look topo I took it with 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:12.960
 about three months valued and the other one 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:14.880
 the truth was small was that there 

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:17.460
 spoiled was too small 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:19.800
 questioned number five characteristics 

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:21.810
 of the cat either physically or its 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:24.030
 personality when I already noticed him 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.930
 I fixed on him because he lacked a little bit 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.239
 of ears 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:31.950
 here you will not see but on this shore 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:35.459
 from here in this critic lacks here a 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:38.879
 little bit then then because it is very gross 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:40.290
 and very crazy he split a tusk and has 

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:43.680
 the fang like that in half and 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:45.930
 characteristic as a cat that is not a 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.790
 cat is a dog basically is not a 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:50.459
 data that the truth is uploaded to the furniture 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:52.560
 do not upload to sites that should not be climbed 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:54.480
 will always be on the floor or in bed 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:56.519
 because I let him be in bed if 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.500
 you want to go up somewhere you 're 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:00.810
 you sitting I want to climb you high up 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:06.239
 the curtain is not raised it starts to 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:08.780
 make up with the little foot as well as 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:12.989
 that asks you to catch it then dow 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:16.109
 I do not know is very smart is a super cat 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:19.079
 Plaza de affectionate do not like to be 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:21.509
 it just gives you good morning flight 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:25.400
 good morning of the halconazo meowing in 

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:27.050
 the ear while sleeping in the morning 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:30.830
 before and 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:33.789
 to the other thing as you say you see here 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:33.789
 13 11 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:50.190
 he got used to there 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:54.629
 clear asking the 6 I think it's your 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:57.720
 pet as a child or more than my daughter 

00:04:54.629 --> 00:05:01.530

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:04.409

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:06.840

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:08.550

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:13.680
 favorite in your pet because normally 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:16.139
 when he was with me was when something did not 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:18.360

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:19.949
 I go to bed the trunk with me I wash 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:22.199

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:24.449

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:27.150

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:30.030

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:37.189
 I take it like that and the enchanted 

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:43.240
 it's cat love and the last question 

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:45.730
 which is the eighth the nickname of your pet 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:48.760

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:52.060
 it's called 13 but it's usually the case that 

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:55.780
 end do not call him in his name I'll 

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:56.440
 I say tresillo or me that 13 quesito de 

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:58.360
 balls 

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:00.460
 when you are serious that you put the eye 

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:03.370

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:05.740

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:12.860

 he does not stop talking always answers me 

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:18.199
 but until we can not talk, no 

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:20.310
 he wants to talk to me and with salgado 

00:06:18.199 --> 00:06:22.820
 because when he closed 

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:22.820

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:28.140

00:06:54.659 --> 00:07:00.600
