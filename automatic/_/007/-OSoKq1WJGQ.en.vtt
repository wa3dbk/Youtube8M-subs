00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
it there and that's going to take the

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.109 
it there and that's going to take the
rubber<00:02:06.509> once<00:02:06.899> it's<00:02:07.110> burned<00:02:07.619> and<00:02:08.250> then<00:02:09.000> it's

going to take it and harden it so it

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.820 
going to take it and harden it so it
will<00:02:12.510> come<00:02:12.660> out<00:02:12.810> a<00:02:12.840> lot<00:02:12.989> easier

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
will come out a lot easier

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.190 
will come out a lot easier
once<00:02:14.190> once<00:02:14.550> you<00:02:14.670> do<00:02:14.760> that<00:02:14.790> a<00:02:14.970> few<00:02:15.090> times<00:02:15.270> you

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
in I just saw on the centerpiece end and

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.830 
in I just saw on the centerpiece end and
here's<00:02:47.700> what<00:02:47.850> the<00:02:48.000> fourth<00:02:48.270> one<00:02:48.450> is<00:02:48.480> looking

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
here's what the fourth one is looking

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.400 
here's what the fourth one is looking
like<00:02:49.130> it<00:02:50.130> is<00:02:50.250> already<00:02:50.580> burned<00:02:50.910> out<00:02:51.150> and<00:02:51.540> as<00:02:52.230> you

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
like it is already burned out and as you

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.160 
like it is already burned out and as you
can<00:02:52.560> see<00:02:53.060> it<00:02:54.060> still<00:02:54.390> is<00:02:54.510> left<00:02:54.750> with<00:02:54.930> rubber

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.300 
inside and I start to clean that out
with<00:02:56.970> wire<00:02:57.180> brush<00:02:57.510> once<00:02:58.200> that's<00:02:58.440> cleaned<00:02:58.830> you

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310

grease<00:03:30.420> in<00:03:30.450> there<00:03:30.660> so<00:03:31.350> now<00:03:31.470> it's<00:03:31.620> a<00:03:31.709> matter<00:03:31.860> of

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
grease in there so now it's a matter of

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.610 
grease in there so now it's a matter of
just<00:03:32.250> putting<00:03:32.550> them<00:03:32.730> out<00:03:32.880> in<00:03:33.380> pressing<00:03:34.380> it<00:03:34.470> in

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
just putting them out in pressing it in

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.680 
just putting them out in pressing it in
with<00:03:35.100> my<00:03:35.280> hand<00:03:35.550> and<00:03:35.790> you<00:03:36.150> can<00:03:36.270> also<00:03:36.390> use<00:03:36.660> a

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
with my hand and you can also use a

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.710 
with my hand and you can also use a
mallet<00:03:37.590> or<00:03:37.680> something<00:03:38.010> else<00:03:38.360> you<00:03:39.360> know<00:03:39.450> just

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
mallet or something else you know just

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.810 
mallet or something else you know just
to<00:03:39.840> give<00:03:40.080> it<00:03:40.170> a<00:03:40.200> little<00:03:40.320> extra<00:03:40.620> finesse<00:03:41.220> as<00:03:41.489> you

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:41.820 
to give it a little extra finesse as you

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:44.990 
to give it a little extra finesse as you
notice<00:03:42.150> this<00:03:42.989> does<00:03:43.320> make<00:03:43.590> a<00:03:43.620> huge<00:03:44.220> mess<00:03:44.580> to<00:03:44.850> do

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
notice this does make a huge mess to do

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.440 
notice this does make a huge mess to do
this<00:03:45.150> so<00:03:45.480> make<00:03:46.410> sure<00:03:46.440> you<00:03:46.770> do<00:03:46.890> have<00:03:46.920> a

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.450 
this so make sure you do have a

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:49.729 
this so make sure you do have a
opportunity<00:03:48.450> to<00:03:48.510> clean<00:03:48.780> up<00:03:48.930> eventually<00:03:49.500> and

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
opportunity to clean up eventually and

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:52.460 
opportunity to clean up eventually and
now<00:03:50.209> I'm<00:03:51.209> going<00:03:51.660> to<00:03:51.750> move<00:03:51.930> on<00:03:52.110> to<00:03:52.380> the

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
now I'm going to move on to the

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.910 
now I'm going to move on to the
differential<00:03:53.690> okay<00:03:54.690> as<00:03:54.870> you<00:03:55.050> can<00:03:55.200> see<00:03:55.380> here<00:03:55.709> I

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
differential okay as you can see here I

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.280 
differential okay as you can see here I
do<00:03:56.160> have<00:03:56.340> the<00:03:56.430> differential<00:03:56.790> pushed<00:03:57.120> out<00:03:57.330> I<00:03:57.570> do

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
do have the differential pushed out I do

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.410 
do have the differential pushed out I do
have<00:03:58.560> the<00:03:58.739> one<00:03:59.010> the<00:03:59.459> center<00:03:59.670> cup<00:03:59.970> on<00:04:00.150> the

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
have the one the center cup on the

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.530 
have the one the center cup on the
passenger<00:04:01.140> side<00:04:01.290> out<00:04:01.560> now<00:04:01.910> so<00:04:02.910> just<00:04:03.390> letting

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
passenger side out now so just letting

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.360 
passenger side out now so just letting
it<00:04:03.690> burn<00:04:03.930> that<00:04:04.380> way<00:04:04.530> it<00:04:04.680> vulcanized<00:04:05.070> is<00:04:05.250> the

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
it burn that way it vulcanized is the

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.520 
it burn that way it vulcanized is the
rubber<00:04:05.580> and<00:04:05.940> turns<00:04:06.330> it<00:04:06.480> hard<00:04:06.690> and<00:04:06.989> that<00:04:07.050> makes

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
rubber and turns it hard and that makes

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:09.229 
rubber and turns it hard and that makes
it<00:04:07.620> look<00:04:07.770> very<00:04:07.890> brittle<00:04:08.340> comes<00:04:08.760> out<00:04:08.880> very<00:04:09.060> easy

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
it look very brittle comes out very easy

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:11.540 
it look very brittle comes out very easy
so<00:04:09.570> it's<00:04:10.470> gonna<00:04:10.590> give<00:04:10.800> it<00:04:10.920> a<00:04:10.980> little<00:04:11.130> bit<00:04:11.310> more

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:11.550 
so it's gonna give it a little bit more

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:14.780 
so it's gonna give it a little bit more
time<00:04:12.120> to<00:04:12.510> burn<00:04:13.019> and<00:04:13.470> then<00:04:14.430> I'm<00:04:14.550> going<00:04:14.670> to<00:04:14.730> work

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
time to burn and then I'm going to work

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:16.130 
time to burn and then I'm going to work
on<00:04:14.940> the<00:04:15.030> other<00:04:15.060> side<00:04:15.360> and<00:04:15.630> then<00:04:15.720> to<00:04:15.780> clean<00:04:15.959> it

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:16.140 
on the other side and then to clean it

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:18.440 
on the other side and then to clean it
up<00:04:16.230> with<00:04:16.440> a<00:04:16.590> wire<00:04:16.830> brush<00:04:17.150> get<00:04:18.150> it<00:04:18.239> ready<00:04:18.390> for

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 
up with a wire brush get it ready for

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:21.670 
up with a wire brush get it ready for
the<00:04:18.570> new<00:04:18.720> bushings

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:21.680 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.469 

okay<00:04:22.460> you<00:04:22.520> know<00:04:22.759> once<00:04:22.970> you<00:04:23.090> have<00:04:23.240> the

00:04:23.469 --> 00:04:23.479 
okay you know once you have the

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:25.480 
okay you know once you have the
differential<00:04:24.320> mounts<00:04:24.680> back<00:04:24.830> in<00:04:25.009> the<00:04:25.160> subframe

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:25.490 
differential mounts back in the subframe

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:27.790 
differential mounts back in the subframe
in<00:04:25.729> the<00:04:26.330> subframe<00:04:26.660> is<00:04:26.900> ready<00:04:27.050> to<00:04:27.110> go<00:04:27.199> in<00:04:27.380> as<00:04:27.620> you

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:27.800 
in the subframe is ready to go in as you

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.070 
in the subframe is ready to go in as you
can<00:04:27.919> see<00:04:28.070> I<00:04:28.100> already<00:04:28.310> have<00:04:28.520> mine<00:04:28.759> put<00:04:29.030> in<00:04:29.210> it's

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.080 
can see I already have mine put in it's

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:31.420 
can see I already have mine put in it's
just<00:04:30.110> a<00:04:30.289> matter<00:04:30.440> of<00:04:30.590> putting<00:04:30.889> it<00:04:31.100> with<00:04:31.310> the

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.430 
just a matter of putting it with the

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:33.850 
just a matter of putting it with the
floor<00:04:31.669> jack<00:04:31.940> keeping<00:04:32.780> it<00:04:32.840> level<00:04:33.020> and<00:04:33.380> raising

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:33.860 
floor jack keeping it level and raising

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:36.520 
floor jack keeping it level and raising
it<00:04:33.919> up<00:04:34.009> to<00:04:34.160> the<00:04:34.280> car<00:04:34.490> once<00:04:35.300> there<00:04:35.630> it's<00:04:36.320> just<00:04:36.440> a
