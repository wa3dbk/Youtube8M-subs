I<00:02:37.310> was<00:02:38.180> really<00:02:38.420> against<00:02:38.810> getting<00:02:39.049> the<00:02:39.230> msi<00:02:39.680> gtx

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:40.069

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:42.430 
I was really against getting the msi gtx
970<00:02:40.849> just<00:02:41.180> because<00:02:41.450> it's<00:02:41.599> red<00:02:41.810> and<00:02:41.989> i<00:02:42.319> was

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
970 just because it's red and i was

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.830 
970 just because it's red and i was
going<00:02:42.620> for<00:02:42.799> a<00:02:42.860> white<00:02:43.190> and<00:02:43.340> black<00:02:43.519> build<00:02:43.849> but<00:02:44.810> i

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
going for a white and black build but i

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.780 
going for a white and black build but i
really<00:02:45.200> like<00:02:45.349> the<00:02:45.470> fact<00:02:45.500> that<00:02:45.799> the<00:02:46.310> fans<00:02:46.580> don't

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
really like the fact that the fans don't

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.839 
really like the fact that the fans don't
spin<00:02:47.150> until<00:02:47.660> it's<00:02:47.959> under<00:02:48.230> load<00:02:48.519> that<00:02:49.519> along

00:02:49.839 --> 00:02:49.849 
spin until it's under load that along
