exactly playing on at games got it felt

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:37.860 
exactly playing on at games got it felt
the<00:05:36.010> same<00:05:36.280> as<00:05:36.490> III<00:05:36.940> but<00:05:37.180> we<00:05:37.270> don't<00:05:37.449> know<00:05:37.630> if

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:37.870 
the same as III but we don't know if

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:40.260 
the same as III but we don't know if
this<00:05:38.410> is<00:05:38.470> the<00:05:38.680> bill<00:05:39.190> that<00:05:39.220> they're<00:05:39.849> talking

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:40.270 
this is the bill that they're talking

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:42.060 
this is the bill that they're talking
about<00:05:40.300> with<00:05:40.599> the<00:05:40.720> weapon<00:05:41.080> tuning<00:05:41.440> which<00:05:41.770> most

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:42.070 
about with the weapon tuning which most

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:43.680 
about with the weapon tuning which most
likely<00:05:42.159> is<00:05:42.490> not<00:05:42.760> because<00:05:43.180> it<00:05:43.300> doesn't<00:05:43.630> have

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:43.690 
likely is not because it doesn't have

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:46.110 
likely is not because it doesn't have
anything<00:05:44.020> to<00:05:44.169> do<00:05:44.409> with<00:05:44.919> a<00:05:44.949> pass<00:05:45.370> destiny<00:05:45.820> in<00:05:46.000> my

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:46.120 
anything to do with a pass destiny in my

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.210 
anything to do with a pass destiny in my
opinion<00:05:46.449> I<00:05:46.659> kind<00:05:46.930> of<00:05:46.990> feel<00:05:47.440> that<00:05:47.500> it<00:05:47.830> is<00:05:47.860> a<00:05:47.979> bill

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:48.220 
opinion I kind of feel that it is a bill

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:49.950 
opinion I kind of feel that it is a bill
just<00:05:48.490> made<00:05:48.729> for<00:05:48.940> those<00:05:49.090> specific<00:05:49.270> weapons

that they give you with those sub
classes<00:05:52.030> and<00:05:52.180> they<00:05:52.570> just<00:05:52.720> make<00:05:52.930> it<00:05:53.080> so<00:05:53.260> it's

00:05:53.399 --> 00:05:53.409
