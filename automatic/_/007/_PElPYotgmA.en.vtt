00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.960
 very very good 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.430
 I always ask how things are but 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.289
 it's a little paradox youtube 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.090
 no one answers but hey I hope that 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.439
 it's still going really like me 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.359
 said it's okay and today we find ourselves 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.500
 so for the new top 5 of the week 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.180
 by the way this week has received 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.410
 really a lot of clips you have to 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.179
 know that I really look at all 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.560
 clips a game does not do that well I 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.850
 not like I do not like his name so I 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.800
 look no no I really look at him 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.180
 where the team and I thank everyone what 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.070
 sends and of course all those who 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.940
 look every Sunday and for that matter 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.140
 the rest of the week you are not 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.700
 obliged to watch that Sunday finally 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.620
 short so today we left with 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.489
 five clips and so we start at the 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.160
 fifth position 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.020
 it is nocolas doe that surpasses 4 pc on 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.340
 himself or m 40 with three eyes heading 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.870
 like save as copÃ© he sees a little 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.399
 many enemies even and suddenly they 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.309
 start shooting it makes us four 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.420
 five six and a half for a +36 girl whose 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.820
 he made himself bronze since he is sure 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.930
 code cats at war but a +37 that's 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.350
 still something in the fourth 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.300
 position 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.760
 his cages and yes this case that makes us a 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.619
 first turn at c4 then after he goes 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.720
 to begin to chain really violently 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.310
 which I disappointed in nothing to steal recognized 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.750
 so he's pointing to the spawn we've seen 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.159
 he makes us a little bows in 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.650
 screen and it's not over I think that 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.390
 total it will make us a difficult at 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.310
 kg with the first kill that's eleven 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.020
 that he in the clip in second and in 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.880
 third position first sir 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.950
 trash 60 and worries about madness 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.770
 watch out he is his and serves thermal 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.479
 he will jump then 360 and balms 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.009
 the brace in just gorgeous scope 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.750
 the cheater I put you a tyrant 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.310
 drawbar agree the docks 30fps limit 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.079
 not useful it's not really top 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.939
 but hey they frankly he we 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.079
 unique in the late it's finally dreaming 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.000
 me that's the kind of thing I'd like 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.740
 really really came in second 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.540
 position it's skies hours that him on 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.790
 hard hat with the bars and attention he 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.619
 starts with two kills a third a 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.610
 fourth or even godspeed a fifth 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.380
 for the holy christ our hymn and a 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.759
 last for the institute he will even do 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.020
 a seventh but the important thing I 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.280
 think that we have seen it is that it is in 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.350
 bankrupt effect and faced it's 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.909
 just impossible to bring in such a crime 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.310
 really bravo is in first position 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.350
 it's our crypto friend who's also on 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.259
 a date but on a doubled of gizzards 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.489
 end of the 3 pc msr this time he 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.020
 starts with a column while he has 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.940
 kill just before another 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.160

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.600

 the faithful coast to another column on 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.810
 saw the sylph in screen and 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.370

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.250
