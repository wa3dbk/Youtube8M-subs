00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860 
actual actual metal I felt like I liked

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:45.650 
actual actual metal I felt like I liked
the<00:03:44.130> settlement<00:03:44.730> was<00:03:44.820> better<00:03:45.060> constructed

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
the settlement was better constructed

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.540 
the settlement was better constructed
you<00:03:45.810> know<00:03:45.930> in<00:03:46.440> terms<00:03:46.740> of<00:03:46.950> I<00:03:47.280> didn't<00:03:47.459> know

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:47.550 
you know in terms of I didn't know

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:49.220 
you know in terms of I didn't know
anything<00:03:47.730> about<00:03:47.910> the<00:03:48.090> alloy<00:03:48.480> and<00:03:48.750> how<00:03:48.870> it<00:03:49.050> was

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
anything about the alloy and how it was

mixed or whatever you know probably some

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:53.510 
mixed or whatever you know probably some
secret<00:03:51.209> formula<00:03:51.840> you<00:03:52.410> know<00:03:52.590> but<00:03:52.830> but<00:03:53.459> I

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:53.520 
secret formula you know but but I

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.220 
secret formula you know but but I
thought<00:03:53.820> that<00:03:53.880> it<00:03:54.120> was<00:03:54.240> a<00:03:54.270> whatever<00:03:54.660> it<00:03:54.900> was<00:03:55.050> it

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
thought that it was a whatever it was it

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.080 
thought that it was a whatever it was it
was<00:03:55.320> a<00:03:55.350> better<00:03:55.560> formula<00:03:55.890> and<00:03:56.220> it<00:03:56.580> rang<00:03:56.790> better

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
was a better formula and it rang better

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.000 
was a better formula and it rang better
you<00:03:57.510> know<00:03:57.660> now<00:03:57.870> I<00:03:58.260> was<00:03:58.530> never<00:03:58.650> the<00:03:58.830> type<00:03:58.860> of

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:48.440 
getting that sound is that's the reason

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:50.439 
getting that sound is that's the reason
why<00:04:48.590> you<00:04:48.889> know<00:04:49.009> I<00:04:49.039> mean<00:04:49.400> I<00:04:49.669> don't<00:04:50.150> believe<00:04:50.419> that

00:04:50.439 --> 00:04:50.449 
why you know I mean I don't believe that

00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:53.710 
why you know I mean I don't believe that
but<00:04:50.870> some<00:04:51.680> people<00:04:51.710> believe<00:04:52.009> it<00:04:52.490> you<00:04:52.639> know<00:04:52.720> they

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:53.720 
but some people believe it you know they

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:54.850 
but some people believe it you know they
want<00:04:53.930> to<00:04:53.990> play<00:04:54.110> the<00:04:54.229> same<00:04:54.379> thing<00:04:54.440> that<00:04:54.710> their

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:54.860 
want to play the same thing that their

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:56.379 
want to play the same thing that their
favorite<00:04:55.069> saxophone<00:04:55.729> player<00:04:55.940> play<00:04:56.180> or

00:04:56.379 --> 00:04:56.389 
favorite saxophone player play or

00:04:56.389 --> 00:04:58.029 
favorite saxophone player play or
something<00:04:57.139> like<00:04:57.259> that<00:04:57.319> because<00:04:57.590> everywhere

00:04:58.029 --> 00:04:58.039 
something like that because everywhere

00:04:58.039 --> 00:04:59.619 
something like that because everywhere
you<00:04:58.159> go<00:04:58.310> you<00:04:58.759> have<00:04:58.849> saxophone<00:04:59.300> students

00:04:59.619 --> 00:04:59.629 
you go you have saxophone students

00:04:59.629 --> 00:05:01.600 
you go you have saxophone students
asking<00:04:59.900> you<00:04:59.990> what<00:05:00.409> Ryu<00:05:00.740> used<00:05:00.949> what<00:05:01.190> horn<00:05:01.400> what

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:01.610 
asking you what Ryu used what horn what

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:03.550 
asking you what Ryu used what horn what
mouthpiece<00:05:02.030> why<00:05:02.270> but<00:05:02.690> you<00:05:02.840> know<00:05:02.960> everywhere

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:03.560 
mouthpiece why but you know everywhere

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:05.080 
mouthpiece why but you know everywhere
everywhere<00:05:04.129> you<00:05:04.250> go<00:05:04.370> unit<00:05:04.669> you'd<00:05:04.789> have<00:05:04.940> this

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.090 
everywhere you go unit you'd have this

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:08.170 
everywhere you go unit you'd have this
but<00:05:05.659> for<00:05:05.840> me<00:05:05.990> it<00:05:06.500> was<00:05:06.680> the<00:05:06.800> way<00:05:06.979> the<00:05:07.159> metal<00:05:07.430> rang

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:08.180 
but for me it was the way the metal rang

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:11.469 
but for me it was the way the metal rang
and<00:05:08.509> I<00:05:08.569> and<00:05:08.780> the<00:05:08.900> mechanism<00:05:09.469> seemed<00:05:09.740> I<00:05:10.479> mean

00:05:11.469 --> 00:05:11.479 
and I and the mechanism seemed I mean

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:13.119 
and I and the mechanism seemed I mean
the<00:05:11.780> mechanism<00:05:12.259> seemed<00:05:12.440> pretty<00:05:12.620> good<00:05:12.740> you

00:05:13.119 --> 00:05:13.129 
the mechanism seemed pretty good you

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:14.619 
the mechanism seemed pretty good you
know<00:05:13.159> like<00:05:13.400> I<00:05:13.490> said<00:05:13.550> on<00:05:13.759> the<00:05:13.849> mark<00:05:14.060> seven

00:05:14.619 --> 00:05:14.629 
know like I said on the mark seven

00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:17.439 
know like I said on the mark seven
it<00:05:14.810> wasn't<00:05:15.199> the<00:05:15.289> best<00:05:15.560> around<00:05:16.550> in<00:05:16.789> this<00:05:16.940> area

00:05:17.439 --> 00:05:17.449 
it wasn't the best around in this area

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:19.209 
it wasn't the best around in this area
but<00:05:17.750> I<00:05:17.780> could<00:05:18.050> I<00:05:18.169> could<00:05:18.440> deal<00:05:18.620> with<00:05:18.650> it<00:05:18.949> one<00:05:19.129> of

00:05:19.209 --> 00:05:19.219 
but I could I could deal with it one of

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:21.129 
but I could I could deal with it one of
the<00:05:19.280> reasons<00:05:19.520> I<00:05:19.610> play<00:05:19.789> these<00:05:20.000> horns<00:05:20.389> today<00:05:20.990> is

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:21.139 
the reasons I play these horns today is

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:24.040 
the reasons I play these horns today is
because<00:05:21.289> I<00:05:21.469> think<00:05:21.530> the<00:05:21.680> mechanism<00:05:22.629> is<00:05:23.629> it's

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:24.050 
because I think the mechanism is it's

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:28.029 
because I think the mechanism is it's
better<00:05:24.259> you<00:05:24.590> know<00:05:24.620> now<00:05:24.740> people<00:05:25.520> say<00:05:25.759> that<00:05:27.039> the

00:05:28.029 --> 00:05:28.039 
better you know now people say that the

00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:30.159 
better you know now people say that the
reference<00:05:28.460> is<00:05:28.550> close<00:05:28.789> to<00:05:28.940> the<00:05:29.029> sixth<00:05:29.389> you<00:05:30.050> know

00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:30.169 
reference is close to the sixth you know

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:32.620 
reference is close to the sixth you know
I<00:05:30.440> don't<00:05:31.099> feel<00:05:31.310> that<00:05:31.460> way<00:05:31.639> you<00:05:32.150> know<00:05:32.270> I<00:05:32.300> mean<00:05:32.599> I

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:32.630 
I don't feel that way you know I mean I

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:34.689

I<00:05:33.050> actually<00:05:33.529> like<00:05:33.860> it<00:05:34.009> better<00:05:34.190> than<00:05:34.370> different

00:05:34.689 --> 00:05:34.699 
I actually like it better than different

00:05:34.699 --> 00:05:36.820 
I actually like it better than different
six<00:05:34.909> you<00:05:35.060> know<00:05:35.180> this<00:05:35.389> is<00:05:35.449> my<00:05:35.569> personal<00:05:35.830> opinion
