of team deathmatch on cock island I

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.940 
of team deathmatch on cock island I
think<00:00:09.420> a<00:00:09.450> completely<00:00:09.929> butchered<00:00:10.469> the

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
think a completely butchered the

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.820 
think a completely butchered the
pronunciation<00:00:11.849> of<00:00:11.940> this<00:00:12.150> map<00:00:12.420> oh<00:00:12.630> well<00:00:13.530> I

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
pronunciation of this map oh well I

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.730

think<00:00:14.400> the<00:00:14.580> gameplay<00:00:14.940> makes<00:00:15.330> up<00:00:15.509> for<00:00:15.660> it<00:00:15.750> so

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
think the gameplay makes up for it so

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.529

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.090 
damage multiplier well the damage points
are<00:00:41.879> as<00:00:42.000> follows<00:00:42.360> it<00:00:42.719> is<00:00:42.930> for<00:00:43.530> this<00:00:43.739> is<00:00:43.920> without

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
are as follows it is for this is without

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.470 
are as follows it is for this is without
suppressor<00:00:44.640> as<00:00:44.730> well<00:00:45.140> 25<00:00:46.219> points<00:00:47.219> up<00:00:47.370> close<00:00:47.640> 19

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
suppressor as well 25 points up close 19

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.250 
suppressor as well 25 points up close 19
it<00:00:49.379> drops<00:00:49.710> up<00:00:49.860> to<00:00:50.039> 19<00:00:50.489> points<00:00:51.149> when<00:00:52.020> it<00:00:52.110> gets

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
it drops up to 19 points when it gets

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.100 
it drops up to 19 points when it gets
the<00:00:52.379> longer<00:00:52.680> ranges<00:00:53.070> with<00:00:53.910> suppressor<00:00:54.480> is<00:00:54.629> 25

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
the longer ranges with suppressor is 25

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.619 
the longer ranges with suppressor is 25
of<00:00:55.289> clothes<00:00:55.559> and<00:00:55.800> 17<00:00:56.430> at<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:56.969> longer<00:00:57.210> ranges

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
of clothes and 17 at the longer ranges

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.119 
of clothes and 17 at the longer ranges
so<00:00:57.870> it's<00:00:58.050> a<00:00:58.109> little<00:00:58.230> bit<00:00:58.350> less<00:00:58.590> damage<00:00:58.920> but

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
so it's a little bit less damage but

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.119 
so it's a little bit less damage but
it's<00:00:59.969> still<00:01:00.270> good<00:01:00.329> for<00:01:00.930> covert<00:01:01.350> use<00:01:01.649> if<00:01:01.949> you

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
it's still good for covert use if you

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.470 
it's still good for covert use if you
want<00:01:02.309> to<00:01:02.370> put<00:01:02.550> them<00:01:02.640> signs<00:01:02.879> from<00:01:03.059> there<00:01:03.300> it's

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
want to put them signs from there it's

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.920 
want to put them signs from there it's
brilliant<00:01:03.930> still<00:01:04.430> so<00:01:05.430> just<00:01:05.640> use<00:01:05.820> it<00:01:06.030> pretty

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
brilliant still so just use it pretty

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.530 
brilliant still so just use it pretty
much<00:01:07.140> it's<00:01:07.380> got<00:01:07.560> a<00:01:07.590> moderate<00:01:08.130> recoil<00:01:08.939> as<00:01:09.360> well

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
that it is worth the trouble with ease

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.530 
that it is worth the trouble with ease
because<00:01:34.200> it<00:01:34.320> is<00:01:34.409> beast<00:01:34.860> it's<00:01:35.790> one<00:01:36.000> of<00:01:36.090> my<00:01:36.150> favs
