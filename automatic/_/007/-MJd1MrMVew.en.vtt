hard<00:01:31.049> for<00:01:31.259> them<00:01:31.409> routine<00:01:31.740> that<00:01:31.829> set<00:01:32.040> up<00:01:32.159> he's

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
hard for them routine that set up he's

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.160 
hard for them routine that set up he's
forced<00:01:32.700> to<00:01:32.759> mostly<00:01:33.090> use<00:01:33.299> ice<00:01:33.509> Lance's<00:01:34.020> and

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
forced to mostly use ice Lance's and

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.899 
forced to mostly use ice Lance's and
Nova's<00:01:34.470> he<00:01:34.590> can't<00:01:34.799> cost<00:01:35.009> any<00:01:35.220> frost<00:01:35.549> BOTS<00:01:35.759> he's

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
Nova's he can't cost any frost BOTS he's

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.870 
Nova's he can't cost any frost BOTS he's
got<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.210> fell<00:01:36.420> hunter<00:01:37.049> on<00:01:37.200> him<00:01:37.409> and<00:01:37.759> you<00:01:38.759> know

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
got the fell hunter on him and you know

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.510 
got the fell hunter on him and you know
I<00:01:38.909> think<00:01:39.500> inflamed<00:01:40.500> was<00:01:40.770> playing<00:01:41.040> a<00:01:41.189> lot<00:01:41.369> more

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
I think inflamed was playing a lot more

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.249 
I think inflamed was playing a lot more
defensively<00:01:42.119> there<00:01:42.360> and<00:01:42.540> burn<00:01:42.659> berukhi<00:01:42.899> maybe

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
defensively there and burn berukhi maybe

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.230 
defensively there and burn berukhi maybe
not<00:01:43.439> playing<00:01:43.710> quite<00:01:44.250> as<00:01:44.399> aggressively<00:01:44.939> with

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
not playing quite as aggressively with

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.109 
not playing quite as aggressively with
