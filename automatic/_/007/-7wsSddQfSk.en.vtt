those<00:01:32.640> are<00:01:32.820> problems<00:01:33.450> in<00:01:33.659> close<00:01:33.900> quarter

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
those are problems in close quarter

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.140 
those are problems in close quarter
combat<00:01:34.290> that's<00:01:34.740> why<00:01:34.890> I<00:01:34.920> do<00:01:35.009> recommend<00:01:35.430> using<00:01:35.790> a

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
combat that's why I do recommend using a

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.480 
combat that's why I do recommend using a
k-12<00:01:36.720> which<00:01:36.900> i<00:01:37.049> think<00:01:37.110> is<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:37.560> best<00:01:37.799> assault

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
k-12 which i think is the best assault

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.240 
k-12 which i think is the best assault
