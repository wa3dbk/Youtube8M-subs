00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:12.030
 and greet everyone squeezes and kiel 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.440
 24 for the 58th episode of beet 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.240
 in which we have a system that is 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.369
 are at the top and it's a system that 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.770
 allow us to go down to 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:24.150
 low sounds in circles at the same time it's 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.830
 not easy with a little bit of water 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.250
 will allow us not to take any 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.269
 damage 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.510
 what is this 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:33.840
 disco he quarreled with yes ah 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:36.020
 yes it's a small room system in 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.430
 did I advocate on twitter 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.739
 so we come we talked about it 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.780
 so here I decided to make a 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.329
 small rainbow room 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.770
 so I do not know what you think 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:49.079
 so i find it nice monga task 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.399
 were busy with your little plants 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.820
 and then the paintings that I have 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.350
 intentionally put upside down 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:58.199
 so this is a small room to whom 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.300
 been asked by adlane the kills so I 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.649
 thanks because it's really cool 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.650
 I really like this little girl 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:08.970
 disco atmosphere so this is never nor I 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:10.200
 all that and then arrange landscaped and I have 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.780
 laid out the trick 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.830
 so if you have small ones 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.670
 little things to propose had not 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.290
 do not hesitate to put them in 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.119
 comment 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.830
 to hang on between that he has changed 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.340
 recently in the previous episode 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:25.950
 so that makes it change and 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.960
 then it's cool yeah I like ok 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.840
 but qd in gold these systems it's a 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.430
 system that I have not found really fun 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.960
 finally I mean a singer jacques 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.310
 heart if I prizes it was it was 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.140
 is that I loved when I go 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.939
 show is not he directly who 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.439
 do that then show day even between 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.540
 all of us like that it's a little bit 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.189
 easier for the camera to see 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.250
 we are high we want to go down 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:50.180
 we want to go down from one go to I can 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.180
 make the suspense last 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.860
 and it gives us a little bit of water 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.140
 who will be laughing and continually and 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:01.020
 we're down yeah it's a little trick 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.659
 nice touch that was he had seen that 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.030
 on callum minecraft who did it that 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.069
 and suddenly look at the compact and a 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.830
 little bit better and suddenly it's all 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:12.810
 little now and then I had 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.780
 tried it's really cool to make 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.160
 small waves like that makes you 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.709
 need only one jump 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.170
 automatically recharge neighbor you do not 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:25.830
 like that it's nice 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:27.360
 ok yes you are well I'm here I'm coming and 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.040
 I think I have the chimney of Seine 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.000
 of pivotal experience is there 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.060
 enough room to take the middle 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.400
 way go it's gone 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:37.200
 ok so we'll put the beginning of episode 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.080
 episodes of which you will go down to 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.890
 from here hop there are the stuff 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:45.000
 you excuse me it's the best and if so 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.620
 can you remove the whole 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.500
 medicine that has below please 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:53.599
 I forgot to remove it on the middle 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:56.220
 here is here to bomba pardon I m the 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:58.019
 the rate nor the eyes the bling that 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:03.600
 would you do without me will be the best 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:04.709
 my god my serious ok but I believe 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:08.040
 I'll bite right now is 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:10.530
 fashion here or elsewhere under 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.870
 the experience 60 years it could 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:15.420
 maybe increase your skill a little 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.319
 little ok so that's the window that goes 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.459
 let us go down you go 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:21.510
 put a life piston will initially 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:24.989
 lit right after a torch here that 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:30.120
 will then activate the piston here with 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:33.180
 a redstone block as well as a pilot 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:35.040
 of the red stone ah yes pitteloud that 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.209
 you will put on the third step that 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.299
 is going to be the first repeater that goes 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:41.549
 activate the piston as well as the 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:45.510
 has the dispensary that will be right in 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:48.900
 below then next we go 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:52.019
 go down in order to put a piston that 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:54.030
 will be located at the same level as the one 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:55.950
 that we just put with 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.239
 a block of redstone voices it's a bit 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.709
 con because we actually make the system 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:00.870
 and will allow us to go down 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:01.910
 go down in the water so in the end it's 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.830
 a little useless 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:05.240
 do you want to go down in 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:06.830
 the water ride is that the fact 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:08.750
 here so we go down into the water but 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:12.680
 it's a little silly finally we do not care and 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:15.830
 this is a bit worthy of the 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:19.459
 do here I come next then you go 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:21.890
 put in coming out of this block 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:22.580
 redstone of the white stone that will 

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:25.880
 go here 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:29.450
 hop a repeater placed fourth 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:32.390
 who is going to reactivate the dispensary 

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:35.480
 who will be here so wait for me 

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:38.600
 put red stone will be here and 

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:41.060
 the group safra ray handle swallowed coming 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:43.010
 to vallet the lot that was previously 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:46.460
 injected then I do not know what you 

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:48.380
 said about me but I'm stuck to 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:51.620
 that's me I say yes that's all 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:52.910
 here is what game out that goes well is 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:54.080
 what you have a history button the 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:55.910
 match I think it's good 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:58.610
 system is missing a little something a 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:00.620
 little detail is for this piston for 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:04.460
 activate enough to put his and suddenly 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:06.980
 it's enabled us from migdal so where 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:09.670
 should I put on the least single blake 

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:12.500
 they available 

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:17.030
 and attention rolling geek trend 

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:17.960
 link the final button gg bravo you have 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:22.370
 managed to make the system 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:24.260
 if the fisc something no it works 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:28.850
 not because I want to put some 

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:29.810
 the water in this set 10 offside reported a 

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:32.780
 problem is actually I directly 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:35.390

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:55.910
 drowned schools and not because leased 120 

00:05:53.570 --> 00:06:00.530
