we<00:01:26.010> can<00:01:26.040> also<00:01:26.370> bring<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:27.030> gable<00:01:27.390> down

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
we can also bring the gable down

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:35.720 
we can also bring the gable down
slightly

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:35.730 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:38.860 

and<00:01:36.590> now<00:01:37.590> we<00:01:37.650> have<00:01:38.040> our<00:01:38.340> gable

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:38.870 
and now we have our gable

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:42.340 
and now we have our gable
structure<00:01:39.410> will<00:01:40.400> click<00:01:40.700> ok<00:01:41.240> and<00:01:41.480> copy<00:01:42.080> the

gable<00:01:42.770> to<00:01:42.920> the<00:01:43.070> other<00:01:43.220> side<00:01:43.580> like<00:01:44.270> so<00:01:44.570> and

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:44.980 
gable to the other side like so and

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:48.970 
gable to the other side like so and
confirm<00:01:46.600> now<00:01:47.600> it<00:01:47.810> is<00:01:47.900> time<00:01:48.170> to<00:01:48.200> add<00:01:48.500> the<00:01:48.530> roof

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:48.980 
confirm now it is time to add the roof

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:51.190 
confirm now it is time to add the roof
and<00:01:49.160> see<00:01:49.640> if<00:01:49.730> it<00:01:49.880> turns<00:01:50.120> out<00:01:50.330> the<00:01:50.540> way<00:01:50.720> we<00:01:50.960> want

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
and see if it turns out the way we want

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.280 
and see if it turns out the way we want
it<00:01:51.290> to<00:01:52.030> you<00:01:53.030> can<00:01:53.240> see<00:01:53.480> that<00:01:53.720> the<00:01:53.840> system<00:01:54.260> has

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290 
it to you can see that the system has

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.190 
it to you can see that the system has
made<00:01:54.710> all<00:01:54.980> the<00:01:55.190> required<00:01:55.610> angle<00:01:56.240> calculations

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
made all the required angle calculations

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.270 
made all the required angle calculations
so<00:01:57.770> we<00:01:57.920> should<00:01:57.950> get<00:01:58.400> a<00:01:58.460> nice<00:01:58.820> mansard<00:01:59.600> roof<00:01:59.990> and

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
so we should get a nice mansard roof and

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.010 
so we should get a nice mansard roof and
here<00:02:01.280> you<00:02:01.400> can<00:02:01.580> see<00:02:01.880> we<00:02:02.150> have<00:02:02.180> installed<00:02:02.720> the

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
here you can see we have installed the

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.580 
here you can see we have installed the
first<00:02:03.290> mansard<00:02:03.860> roof<00:02:04.240> successfully<00:02:05.380> let's<00:02:06.380> do

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
first mansard roof successfully let's do

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.109 
first mansard roof successfully let's do
the<00:02:06.740> same<00:02:06.980> thing<00:02:07.280> with<00:02:07.460> the<00:02:07.580> other<00:02:07.610> building

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
the same thing with the other building

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.190 
the same thing with the other building
but<00:02:08.750> this<00:02:08.960> time<00:02:09.020> without<00:02:09.530> Gables<00:02:10.900> will<00:02:11.900> right

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200

view<00:02:33.440> we<00:02:33.950> see<00:02:33.980> that<00:02:34.430> the<00:02:34.550> roof<00:02:34.790> has<00:02:35.000> been

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
view we see that the roof has been

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.900 
view we see that the roof has been
created<00:02:35.840> but<00:02:36.530> it<00:02:36.650> seems<00:02:36.980> a<00:02:37.190> little<00:02:37.340> bit<00:02:37.610> too

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
created but it seems a little bit too

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.570 
created but it seems a little bit too
high<00:02:38.180> so<00:02:38.990> let's<00:02:39.290> go<00:02:39.470> back<00:02:39.710> into<00:02:40.070> the<00:02:40.250> roof

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
high so let's go back into the roof

the roof to a specific height of 6
meters<00:02:47.170> we<00:02:48.170> will<00:02:48.380> click<00:02:48.590> apply<00:02:49.010> and<00:02:49.310> then<00:02:49.450> ok

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
meters we will click apply and then ok

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.230 
meters we will click apply and then ok
now<00:02:52.500> we<00:02:52.560> have<00:02:52.860> a<00:02:52.890> line<00:02:53.250> which<00:02:53.520> indicates<00:02:54.120> that

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:54.240 
now we have a line which indicates that

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.550 
now we have a line which indicates that
the<00:02:54.510> cut<00:02:54.720> will<00:02:54.930> be<00:02:55.080> made<00:02:55.320> to<00:02:55.530> our

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
the cut will be made to our

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.340 
the cut will be made to our
specifications<00:02:56.480> but<00:02:57.480> we<00:02:57.600> also<00:02:57.810> need<00:02:58.320> to

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
specifications but we also need to

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.190 
specifications but we also need to
change<00:02:58.800> the<00:02:58.950> angles<00:02:59.550> as<00:02:59.730> well<00:03:00.060> because<00:03:00.930> right

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
change the angles as well because right

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.650 
change the angles as well because right
now<00:03:01.230> the<00:03:01.500> system<00:03:01.950> still<00:03:02.430> thinks<00:03:02.820> we<00:03:02.970> want<00:03:03.180> 75

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
now the system still thinks we want 75

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.340 
now the system still thinks we want 75
degree<00:03:04.230> angles<00:03:04.740> all<00:03:05.040> the<00:03:05.280> way<00:03:05.430> through<00:03:06.350> let's

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
degree angles all the way through let's

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:10.640 
degree angles all the way through let's
just<00:03:07.500> adjust<00:03:08.190> this<00:03:08.430> to<00:03:08.490> 18<00:03:09.150> degrees<00:03:09.410> click<00:03:10.410> OK

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
just adjust this to 18 degrees click OK

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.150 
just adjust this to 18 degrees click OK
hit<00:03:11.610> enter<00:03:12.060> and<00:03:12.300> now<00:03:12.360> you<00:03:13.110> can<00:03:13.470> see<00:03:13.740> how<00:03:13.980> our

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
hit enter and now you can see how our

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.600 
hit enter and now you can see how our
roof<00:03:14.430> structure<00:03:14.880> has<00:03:15.270> changed<00:03:15.900> and<00:03:16.460> here<00:03:17.460> we

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
roof structure has changed and here we

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:21.920 
roof structure has changed and here we
have<00:03:17.640> another<00:03:18.210> completed<00:03:18.900> mansard<00:03:19.530> roof
