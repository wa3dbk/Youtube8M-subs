00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:04.670
 material's list 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:12.440
 piece of paper that you use piece of 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:14.980
 hair and no longer use cotton to 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.980
 Fill 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:22.050
 flat for hair 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.050
 Temperas their wines 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:31.480
 brushes rounded tip scissors 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:34.870
 Needle and thread to use under the 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:36.850
 supervision of a responsible adult the 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:39.010
 next week we will be doing some 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:43.370
 gloves like these 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:45.760
 we started with drawing on paper the 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:48.200
 way you want your doll to have 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.829
 we use the marker and then 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:54.969
 we cut 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:58.450
 of each piece we make two pieces of each 

00:00:54.969 --> 00:01:01.690
 mold we make two pieces 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:03.790
 this is how we will have two pieces for the 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:06.600
 right arm two pieces for the arm 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:09.790
 left two pieces for the legs 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.480
 each one of the legs and two pieces 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.480
 for the torso 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:22.060
 once we have the material trimmed 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:22.060
 we start to sew in a fan shape 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:29.210
 just metisaca the needle of one of the 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:31.600
 same way all around the 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.600
 piece 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.450
 we take out the needle 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.590
 and we are staying like this 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:57.030
 after we cook the piece we give the 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.030
 back and start piloting 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:09.160
 we are starting the position where 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:13.260
 we are cooking 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.260
 we passed the needle from bottom to top 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:24.890
 then we pass the thread that is already out 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.530
 below the needle when we come 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.930
 for the second time 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:33.850
 it's like a first stitch does not matter 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.850
 the others are left filleted 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.670
 we passed the needle again 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:08.800
 and so on until you complete everything 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.800
 the edge 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.220
 has to keep pulling the thread every time 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:29.450
 that you pass the needle so that I'm not going to 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.450
 loose posture 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:37.370
 once you have finished the pyropear 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.370
 we begin to fill 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.680
 making small cotton balls 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:47.900
 you help with a scissors and is filling 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:51.470
 first the tips 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:55.900
 once the limbs are finished 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:59.110
 we will use the torso in the same way 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:00.830
 first we tried the kisses from the side 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:03.290
 in 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:07.040
 in such a way that when we turn the 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:09.700
 Seam the pieces in their part in 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.700
 your post 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:22.140
 we sew all over the little bank of such 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:24.840
 so that all three are sewn 

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:27.800
 pieces we do the same with the 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:31.080
 little legs are placed on the wrong side 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:34.400
 we close like a sandwich and 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.400
 we sew all over the shore 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:41.099
 once cooked add a space 

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:43.249
 open by the head and back to the 

00:04:41.099 --> 00:04:43.249
 doll 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:50.460
 we finished the body of the doll 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:52.740
 we started to catch her short hair 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:55.060
 the strands of yarn of the length that they want 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:57.460
 the woman the hair 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:05:00.130
 and you start to own it 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:01.900
 for the back because to get it 

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:04.270
 to give it because if you do not hit with rubber 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:06.250
 shoes can damage the fabric and 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:08.979
 waste materials 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:12.620
 instead cooked it remains fixed it is firm 

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:14.449
 and it is more aesthetic 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:16.550
 they know in the same way how they have gone 

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:19.160
 doing with the rest of the clothes below 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:21.409
 up and it's coming out one by one 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:24.110
 each strand 

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:25.639
 once with the hair we proceed to 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:28.610
 make the clothes on the wrist is 

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:31.070
 She lists her little arms but her legs 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:35.920
 you need a good dress 

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:35.920
 then we put on paper 

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:50.470
 and we simulate a shot for a pair of trousers 

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:53.930
 marking the points where it is open 

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:58.539
 the clothes and the little arms 

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:58.539
 the legs and the armhole 

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:06.770
 then we draw 

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:06.770
 the long shot of the trousers 

00:06:07.009 --> 00:06:10.180
 the length of the back 

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:13.729
 the armhole 

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:22.340
 and the shoulder 

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:26.889
 and thanks to the neck we cut 

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:26.889
 four equal pieces on the cloth 

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:35.210
 and then what thing we have seeing 

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:35.210
 more then we're going to put it on the wrist 

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:42.630
 here are the four pieces the glues 

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:45.420
 you put them back to back things 

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:48.650
 by the shore then with sense and then 

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:48.650
 closures on the sides 

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:14.020
 then we proceed to use our company 

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:16.949
 of the brush to make the mouth and the 

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:16.949
 face to mine 

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:23.510
 we paint the mouth then we paint the 

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:23.510
 little eyes 

00:07:24.169 --> 00:07:30.949
 and here we have the doll already finished 

00:07:26.599 --> 00:07:33.969
 to accompany him to walk to play 

00:07:30.949 --> 00:07:39.159
 sleep water street with your friends 

00:07:33.969 --> 00:07:39.159
 with his jumpsuit from his own athlete
