00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:28.800
 he did not ask 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.800
 his gangsters his tennis 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:35.400
 other up to his online 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.850
 about me by the way km to him the same 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:41.530
 said and hi with you egor and 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.150
 literally here a couple of hours ago in 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.790
 appstore appeared almost unexpectedly 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:48.100
 bioshock for iphone and pet almost only 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:49.960
 because it is known to release on a with the first 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.280
 parts of the almost legendary series became 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.260
 just a couple of weeks ago 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.420
 what's really great is that 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.520
 bioshock on aas is not some kind of game on 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.019
 topic or handing it out to the franchise like this 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.890
 like to do for example with scales 

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:02.320
 assassins 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.839
 and a full port at the very pr shock 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.490
 which came out already in 2007 and got 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:08.170
 a huge number of awards including 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:09.820
 game year from many editions 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.399
 by the way this year was presented 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:15.070
 first iphone and who would have thought so, and 

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:17.110
 and mozyzes over still really in bioshock how 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.509
 never played just ran a little 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.160
 infinite on your zbox but after the cool 

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:23.289
 video that tells the whole story 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:25.270
 franchise trilogy I really like 

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:27.820
 Syria now has a great reason to start 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.470
 or pass from the smart the same movie 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:31.539
 I will post in the description I recommend it 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:34.240
 see all and especially fans 

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:36.100
 The bioshock itself doesn’t seem at all 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.990
 no different from the strength and console 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.760
 versions except maybe 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.960
 In the graph, in principle, you can understand it. 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.060
 before starting the game 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.799
 for the mobile version weighs only 2 and 6 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.760
 gigabyte while desktop 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:47.590
 about eight 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.270
 despite the fact that performance 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:52.000
 mobile chips gone incredibly far 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:54.250
 forward obviously desktop solution 2007 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.070
 of the year they have not yet managed to catch up 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.990
 and so the graphics in bioshock call 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:01.990
 just super cool but with all desire 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:04.630
 there is no way the average 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.280
 even very much and I did not break off to write 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.170
 excerpt from the desktop version of the mobile 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.519
 so you can compare them so to speak 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:10.630
 face to face and draw conclusions 

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:12.370
 by myself 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.799
 but he is not only because of the mass graph 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:17.200
 love bioshok in particular for the plot and 

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:19.390
 the atmosphere and really run a little by 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.190
 deserted underwater city delight in 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.660
 which accidentally hits the main one 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.850
 character named Jack after the crash 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:27.459
 the plane is still under a little pants 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:29.440
 still had time so that everything is as it should 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:31.150
 i said above in no shock ever before 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.489
 did not play but penetrate the pair 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.079
 hours such had time and I think it will be that 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:37.690
 a game that I will go through on my iphone 

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:39.400
 from and dollar i'm very superficially familiar 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.750
 plot but heard that he is here 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.760
 really cool here 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.860
 first minus for many game appears 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.920
 translated into five languages ​​but Russian in 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.810
 this list is not 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.000
 so people do not know English 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.069
 risk a lot to lose control here 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.750
 typical for games of this genre and the same 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:55.459
 modern combat which review is on 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.260
 channel is almost no different but 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:58.580
 in fairness it should be noted that 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.010
 here I have to cope with the guidance 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:03.170
 The sight turned out somewhat better but 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.120
 again, I thought they thought the best 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:07.250
 controllers for such games were there and 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.540
 there will be a keyboard and mouse in general 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.819
 tell something a lot and project 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:13.040
 seven years ago is actually difficult 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:14.750
 for everything has been told to me myself 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.940
 The game has already been passed by everyone 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.830
 except me the only thing after all 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:21.080
 nilly, I remember this one 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:22.430
 here's the kind of imperishable valentine vilsakoma and 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:24.140
 exit bioshock once again 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.600
 confirm that the best games of the port 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:28.790
 Exclusives such more often go to ios 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.650
 and if it ever comes out on android 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.330
 and with not sour such a delay works 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.680
 they are somewhat different if you are of course 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:35.630
 understand what I mean 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.390
 and zara chips rewind game worth none 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:39.980
 as much as 479 rubles 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:42.650
 not much less a house version 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:45.049
 which costs 649 rubles therefore 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:45.860
 there is quite a logical question 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:48.290
 whether to buy 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:50.660
 In general, you and there get one and that 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:52.820
 same game but in the case of the version you can 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:54.829
 play not and anywhere but true with 

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:55.940
 somewhat simplified graphics and not the most 

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:58.100
 convenient management 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:00.109
 but if you were the same only to me and 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:01.609
 never saw bioshock games 

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:04.190
 shopping is a must 

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:05.989
 Well, that's all thanks and pasha gave . sho
