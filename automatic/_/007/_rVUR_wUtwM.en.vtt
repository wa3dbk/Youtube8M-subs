00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:06.870
 beauty talks, I'll have it with more 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:11.160
 a video and today I'm here with the test 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:15.240
 Tiff has not been 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:17.670
 the most sophisticated there my most educated 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:27.000
 landfill with the perfect boreo does not 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:30.269
 Forget who she is and in good face 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.239
 said here the guy right there wrote a 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.940
 commentary and another day was that 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.469
 Wait, I do not know how many minutes in the game. 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.730
 to work right 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:45.180
 It's because he opened it, but that's a trick. 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:48.719
 And I even read about it somewhere. 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:51.180
 Then I saw some people say that. 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.800
 only I thought it had nothing to do 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.140
 leave right 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:59.129
 I thought it was on the black screen and 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:02.910
 because the ps was really bad and did not 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:07.110
 The game, but I waited some time to 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:09.330
 see and use 100% of the processor so 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:14.040
 I was afraid not right 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:18.659
 He's foggia and I really expected him. 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.350
 He opened it, it's no use. 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.619
 none 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:25.680
 You see that the game is with 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:28.829
 Very poor performance, right? 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.110
 conditions to play so because the game 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:34.860
 wheel on an average of three to four 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:41.400
 fronts there and it sucks that right 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:44.810
 It's always like it seems to play. 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:50.060
 If you had it there, it's good to play. 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:52.880
 30 is that something like 28 to 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.829
 20 he I think I can play 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.840
 I'll play at least not 

00:01:54.829 --> 00:02:00.049
 and to play yes I think you need a 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:03.259
 Good pc and that's why I saw the game 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:06.020
 too heavy right around the game're fucking 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:06.679
 Way 's good, so I guess that's it. 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.470
 guys 

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:12.950
 if you like online extension is favorite 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:15.220
 and if possible and if and until the next 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.220
 video
