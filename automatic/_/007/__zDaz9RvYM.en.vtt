 empty jar I don't really get one 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.119
 very good score or whatever 

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:34.309
 but such a jar in which my hardpoint 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:36.110
 game bo prefix to and magda a reflex 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:37.790
 site quicker and adjustable stick and 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:40.190
 play three against four o'clock I'm in it 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:42.019
 team with wessel and sandy dhd you 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.519
 of course one got used to it eventually 

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:45.260
 potty I can tell you bucket 

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:46.699
 scoring is also pretty good 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.140
 today I want to go with you 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:50.930
 have over ran play and what the 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.640
 benefits were and why was 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.500
 chile playsuit was once for the 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.850
 good people but also for the bad 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.250
 because people naturally play was member 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.900
 introduced in spot or two to black 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.640
 just came naturally to everyone 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.019
 just audience people play and two 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.760
 increasingly famous 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:06.200
 youtubers that ran empty and am uploading 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.820
 also more famous 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.590
 more and more people are playing 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:12.020
 more and more people in them really seasons 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.610
 follow in replay and I personally have 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.320
 i also boy did a lot i really 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:15.799
 brushing portugal plays i have with teams 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.560
 played 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:20.390
 I've done a lot of play now and it 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.829
 is a game where you just have to go 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.259
 really should just concentrate in one 

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:25.969
 playing games with the few people so unique 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:27.740
 very difficult with players because you 

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:28.369
 than with you very often for us in it 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.469
 team is coming 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:31.969
 yo mistake with us in the team is just now 

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:33.740
 put have very much outstanding at 1000 

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:35.359
 10 comes that will only start running 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.130
 racing so we have nothing on you 

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:38.960
 so he always walked around and typed 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.030
 needed and you had to go really well cabbage 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.890
 caress and you had to work together 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.479
 you had to give charcoal from boys 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.280
 they sit one in bed how she sits one 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:48.469
 native youngest are the one 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.390
 in the pension bladiebladiebla everywhere 

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:52.219
 Music can give applause and was real 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.020
 just play well like you and what 

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:55.640
 the worse the player was you actually come 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.609
 the vision if you were a bit better bronze 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.049
 silver gold and eventually master as 

00:01:58.609 --> 00:02:01.969
 you were really just playing well 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:04.670
 and equally impersonal hot chilli demo 

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:06.409
 tom just once they don't get that 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.350
 public girls play public matches 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:11.630
 and 6 against 6 9 against 9 pastors and kill 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:13.010
 confirmed team net knife 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.660
 demolition, I know a lot about games 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.100
 are all in it and that is whole 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.540
 often just the same 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.130
 and if you only public girls 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.319
 you will often come across playing 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:23.959
 people who are about equally 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:25.999
 be good like you and if he ran into it 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:28.549
 players can really many many many 

00:02:25.999 --> 00:02:31.340
 become better player because with and ran 

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:33.650
 play in the same division butt against 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.329
 the same people come that sometimes quite whole 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.889
 be much better than you but sometimes also 

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:38.329
 just on the same level as you 

00:02:36.889 --> 00:02:40.099
 and if you go against people like that 

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:41.840
 games that are simply very good 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:43.849
 in the game you can learn things from them 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.650
 can you take things from them can you 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:47.060
 better get one you can know with which 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.469
 weapons you have to play 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.909
 and of course in call or duty coach from 

00:02:48.469 --> 00:02:52.340
 this game is also back then hot 

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:54.290
 the something else is called follow me clans 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.790
 call of duty ghost clans or whatever 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.709
 so then we can do this again 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.239
 start playing 4 against 4 on call or duty 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:00.980
 ghost and I personally am very sorry 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:04.189
 really fancy just because you 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.540
 A better player can replay words 

00:03:04.189 --> 00:03:07.250
 there are a lot of light play plays then 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.620
 you just know after a while what 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:11.419
 tactics you can keep and you must 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:14.030
 also totally all play than in normal 

00:03:11.419 --> 00:03:14.840
 audience nice but if you walk in learn 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.250
 from 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.230
 something has to be done in situations like this 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:19.489
 play quieter it's a situation must 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.560
 I put a brake on this in this 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:23.209
 type of situation I have to grab an m8 and 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.239
 other situation i have to win and smc 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:27.949
 address then you can get much better in 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:29.569
 going to the audience I have myself 

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:31.609
 does not commit a lot and plays after one 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:33.139
 for a while I just knew okay like me 

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:34.879
 against this kind of enemies come two 

00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:36.859
 Grab me there if it is against this kind and 

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:38.629
 emmy's come hup d-pad mammoth mc and it 

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:40.310
 Really just helps you get a better one 

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:43.609
 player speaks like you for example 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:45.349
 just go play hardcore you can 

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:48.049
 become a much better player because in 

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:49.909
 you always have to be hardcore first 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:51.560
 bullet that you hit because you are 

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:53.150
 killed within a co and if you yourself 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:55.400
 rose good enemy plays 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:57.139
 wash boom you must spot every bullet immediately 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.000
 shoot under target and then you can 

00:03:57.139 --> 00:04:00.709
 For example, you improve on in 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.989
 and it is like against good ones 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:05.030
 teams comes when t party's come then 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:07.340
 you learn better for the objective too 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:08.989
 play and every game has something but ran 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:10.669
 one has it all combined to you 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:12.199
 must play for the objects you must have one 

00:04:10.669 --> 00:04:14.389
 good score makes you score 

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:16.099
 strings can get and so, and sometimes 

00:04:14.389 --> 00:04:17.539
 can dominate with your bark so et 

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:19.280
 cetera et cetera 

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:21.049
 if you ran you play with your score 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:22.550
 study I have then you do not like in the 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:24.320
 audience people just still map 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:26.270
 on resignation he goes a little quieter 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:27.620
 and you try to total your health 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:29.240
 you try his guidance 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:30.469
 try to tell you who can get it 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.270
 and I try that in this background 

00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:33.830
 game is also called always I now have my 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:34.330
 lightning me light flow only far 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:36.009
 in your 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.150
 it and then you can scorsese the again 

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:39.069
 in calling and the works of course too 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:40.360
 for no one ripped my calf Citigo 

00:04:39.069 --> 00:04:41.590
 which was of course come back 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.939
 with a different name and I have 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:44.289
 personally very excited 

00:04:42.939 --> 00:04:45.520
 he never walked've already played 

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:46.930
 then simply I recommend to the 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:49.240
 going to do crates just plays with 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:50.770
 friends of report i of two men three 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.689
 man four man maybe even that you 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:54.340
 just create a whole team and then you can 

00:04:52.689 --> 00:04:56.560
 you just play chill believe you are 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.939
 is better if you do so, he found it 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:59.650
 played a whole day guts you go 

00:04:57.939 --> 00:05:01.569
 he immediately pan back to public people 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:04.090
 there much better score but blackops 2 

00:05:01.569 --> 00:05:05.680
 comes up with this with just about you 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:07.840
 call of duty comes two and a half times better 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.979
 ghosts out and everything is just about u 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:11.349
 done in blackops 2 

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:13.690
 lykle was just one of the best new 

00:05:11.349 --> 00:05:15.550
 games in black as two simply 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:17.229
 because it is very niels first 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:18.789
 of course you bump up that too 

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:20.379
 just clipboard but the museum or 

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:21.099
 via m lg or the music again 

00:05:20.379 --> 00:05:22.690
 Others 

00:05:21.099 --> 00:05:24.340
 so then science museum already claymore 

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:26.650
 you have to play in a private knife 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:29.020
 and that doesn't all work well 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:30.699
 for ordinary people who go for the movie 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:32.919
 comp and fill it out and started playing 

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:34.029
 labels to just really soul souls fail 

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:37.150
 of course it just a little bit 

00:05:34.029 --> 00:05:38.919
 because if you ran impose 40 hours of play 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:41.169
 and if always 

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:42.460
 always love someone in your team 

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:44.949
 you can hardly go there anymore 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:46.659
 Winning in knew if the elevator was an emmy 

00:05:44.949 --> 00:05:49.090
 well then you can win very easily 

00:05:46.659 --> 00:05:51.069
 over there are knife getuind old right 

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:53.139
 when the pot starts and then the florist 

00:05:51.069 --> 00:05:55.060
 suddenly just 3 to 3 or 3 to four 

00:05:53.139 --> 00:05:56.259
 hour or 3 to 2 or whatever 

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:58.089
 and that is of course not nice to 

00:05:56.259 --> 00:05:59.889
 so go with tahiti coast too 

00:05:58.089 --> 00:06:01.810
 dedicated servers clearly come one 

00:05:59.889 --> 00:06:03.940
 service in that call of duty 

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:06.129
 same service goes highest 

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:09.099
 so it's no longer like the host 

00:06:06.129 --> 00:06:11.289
 elevator is the one who has the fame the one 

00:06:09.099 --> 00:06:13.690
 that just gives everyone a connection 

00:06:11.289 --> 00:06:15.610
 if that lift nothing happens at all 

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:17.770
 as that person sweet and place or two 

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:19.599
 happens what comes a lot of DJ's man 

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:22.300
 that I go to service all risks 

00:06:19.599 --> 00:06:24.069
 are hosted by the makers of 

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:25.509
 Collegie movie and so is activision 

00:06:24.069 --> 00:06:27.370
 you no longer suffer from no pride 

00:06:25.509 --> 00:06:28.839
 this no more neck more 

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:30.610
 I hope it will wait for me 

00:06:28.839 --> 00:06:32.110
 make good between service and then 

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:34.300
 it will therefore be exactly the same as now 

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:36.250
 agree on battlefield 4 that you just really 

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:38.229
 can play with a lot of men in call or 

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:39.699
 duty there count 9 to 9 of course 

00:06:38.229 --> 00:06:41.889
 otherwise it will simply become too busy 

00:06:39.699 --> 00:06:43.509
 If account of play color you have it is it 

00:06:41.889 --> 00:06:44.830
 actually a bit too busy 

00:06:43.509 --> 00:06:46.990
 some moment because stand and in blankets 

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:47.630
 six men seven times for you and you can do that 

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:49.190
 Just no 

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:51.680
 jelle that's impossible all of us too 

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:53.360
 killing 9 to 9 is very common 

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:54.800
 the maximum that you can or cannot do 

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:55.610
 going to play more knife just being 

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:57.380
 chaotic 

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:59.270
 more people flipping those spans alone 

00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:00.620
 but much more often are his bait 

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:01.610
 you left of you right of you everywhere 

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:03.110
 nowhere 

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:04.730
 And yes she throws the maximum man 

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:06.170
 by the third chain service 

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:08.420
 so in political east 

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:10.190
 I hope to come and actually know it 

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:12.290
 certainly that it will no longer be a leak 

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:13.880
 no more pride this one could not 

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:15.500
 bullshit more content someone just 

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:16.970
 they randomly pull out the internet and that 

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:18.770
 so you get connection inproduct it 

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:20.120
 if you connexxion internet it goes 

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:20.810
 get in call or duty ghosts there comes 

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:23.420
 Which 

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:24.890
 whether the service is overloaded or you have 

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:26.600
 just really poo internet so that is one 

00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:28.190
 of the two and so you get none 

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:29.750
 bullshit more that someone is hosting for the 

00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:30.170
 because at bollendorf 3 that was real 

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:32.330
 the case 

00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:34.400
 in order to subject 3 it was like that as you 

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:36.110
 the host of the game was for you people 

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:37.730
 wash it in three balls 

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:39.770
 easy to pick up a nice one and 

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:41.780
 so you no longer have angelico tico's 

00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:43.370
 but replay you will be better player 

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:44.420
 I am also a bit better myself 

00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:46.100
 become a player 

00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:47.690
 I almost know a lot of people too 

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:49.610
 Zero stop just played live played 

00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:50.930
 in black or stone is real movie play 

00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:52.310
 the wax one and the more healing sauce 

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:53.120
 can see because they are simply none 

00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:54.050
 was in the mood 

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:55.970
 and then i want to thank you for it 

00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:58.550
 watch the complete people 5 minutes 

00:07:55.970 --> 00:08:00.700
 like and see you again next time 

00:07:58.550 --> 00:08:00.700
 bye bye
