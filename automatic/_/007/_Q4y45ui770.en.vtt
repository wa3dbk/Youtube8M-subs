00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.049
 five four three two one top that's 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.250
 left 

00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:09.780
 so here is hi to all these styles on 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.429
 lose no time we go live 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.889
 since today it would be a video 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.809
 a little mom a little video 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.119
 particular since I decided to 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.350
 make a spoil upload and the president 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.439
 it's really a concept that I called 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:25.199
 all sitting steve a super word game 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.359
 funny it's sweet where I'm going to try to 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.460
 to make a species here so not to say it 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.320
 really do a quasi without volume on 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.180
 do not promise us you will not be hydro us 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.309
 of you talk about it more we put it 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.660
 Parisians do not even have to tula thisted 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.719
 done with machines not really there 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.280
 I play a game there I for example I 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.510
 do not know how you can by more 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.390
 b I wanted to watch for example that 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.100
 no the veiling slap press the 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.730
 keys at the same time boxing that rotten 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.129
 as proof 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.899
 but here I am really really 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.059
 commenting 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.800
 and the trick here is that the challenge 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.180
 was not running away from the game since the game 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.489
 as much as possible because I think that 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.780
 someone who knows the game well 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:03.030
 really really there is way to the 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.830
 do it in pretty much yeah we finish the 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.020
 play in five six minutes in speed run 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.240
 ranking we are not too bad 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.439
 we're doing well the trick the challenge 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.820
 it's to do it we see how you are 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.920
 necessarily since all the sports that I 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.060
 do of course it's more interesting if 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.799
 I was commenting here necessarily it's a 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.270
 species of best to challenge I think 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.570
 if I could succeed in making the 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.400
 loop 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.360
 it would be huge because so the 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.729
 product that I took over this 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.960
 no it was not me I was finished 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:27.750
 never shown full of technique and everything 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.549
 but how to say aigre pee 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.850
 as I do the kéké full of times I 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:34.680
 die I do not know if it's nice but 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.240
 it was not a performance of the same super 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.710
 mario bros saw that I was ready was not 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.240
 no sooner did klopp have to 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.590
 super mario bros 3 ya after that I 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.259
 started to really have some 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.980
 benefits a little respectable but even 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.840
 still there I lost lévis 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:48.280
 I 'm a bit of bullshit there really 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.360
 I really want to do a near vertex 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.190
 to some times you may have the 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.360
 see stubborn on two three bullshit on 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.310
 the stairs that forever and 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:57.780
 still a little shit some times but in 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.780
 all if it's not going to go 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:03.250
 the proof the mini-truce stupid what so 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.350
 there I will really try to do 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:08.830
 our perfect way the thing is that 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:10.030
 good there are still plenty of places that I 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.860
 could use but there in all 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.600
 that I get well mastered so that makes 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.710
 extremely pleasure here before that 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.120
 I had a lot of trouble bleaching 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:18.490
 is almost harder the first time 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.420
 recover the plant by jumping necessarily 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:21.520
 know that you do not mind a little 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:24.940
 pause when I do it because that's 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.350
 not easy but frankly it allows me 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.120
 really ngo militants here it is I 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:29.530
 abut against them controls exist 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.000
 khalid towards there also normally I 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.670
 fell shots wiped the pipes here I 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.960
 loses time alone price I sign I 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.130
 will try to control me so sorry 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:39.010
 if I stress you 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.960
 sorry I'm stressed I 'm stressed I 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.530
 really want to do such a 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:44.920
 performance 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:46.600
 and it's really not too much and there nothing 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.180
 that the answer to a price a clash loses 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:51.520
 time is not very serious but it's me 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.380
 stress and if really the case of your 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.420
 scores vita games it's up to a world 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.250
 it was the level there it was one of the most 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.810
 pierce was subject from the level of the 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.330
 haunting because I never got to 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:02.650
 the finish passing timer that only malange 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.050
 to get there before I arrived not said yes 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.400
 it was stressing me and a level of gold with 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.459
 the holes the alley under the man it's a 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.900
 psychopathy trick now 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:13.660
 now I master well so that the 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:16.209
 doubled the proposed budget like a shit 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.830
 but now it's okay anyway 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:20.200
 rather relatively well manages 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:21.850
 I did not do it before ten days explains 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:26.590
 the spoils relationship do not lose a 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:27.730
 only peace and I still have trouble with that 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.870
 sometimes I watch going from the first 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:32.650
 blow but I'm so scared of myself 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:34.120
 to plant that I could not see it so it's not 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.190
 not perfect but it stresses me even 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.300
 I will really really try to 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:38.370
 catch up on the last 3 levels 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:40.810
 because standards level 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.550
 normally it's okay I rock 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:45.820
 so here comes the guardians that there I 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:48.130
 good rock cgppa 48 years roxas shit 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:50.680
 that's what they do here that one 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:52.360
 so here it is with this kind of 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.550
 passage is where I see that 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:56.620
 super mario bros is unsurpassed in case 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:58.959
 of platform really really this 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:00.190
 accuracy there is that with this game there that 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:01.930
 may or may not have and I'm training 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:03.670
 I'm not looking for poorly trained 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.410
 true but I find this precision 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:06.850
 it is this fact that we can really 12 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:09.640
 and in this way 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:12.640
 really daf that with this game there that I 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:15.040
 do not really come and just for that 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.510
 i am super happy mali sarr proves 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.790
 rapper I think for me that's me 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:20.530
 will find that this game is in terms of 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:22.930
 platform 2d in terms of platform 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:24.910
 2d i think this game there he has a he 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:27.640
 is not the bait cremant to say that he has 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:30.040
 he made the platform succeed and he 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:33.190
 at least well I have it handed all the 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:37.460
 world okay and still today he 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:39.560
 still agrees concentrate 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:41.330
 or it's good you do not have it if I go through 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:42.440
 above that brush the beach loses too much 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:46.669
 time do not too windy too 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:48.740
 time is good the plasters brothers 

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:52.090
 hammer shit so there just in 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:54.530
 monsters before and it goes but good 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:56.900
 that's it I went well so 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:58.490
 this will be the usual mastery I have of 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:00.770
 bad to jump but here I am already 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:02.419
 at 8.4 what I'm already at the 8th you 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:04.220
 can it go super super fast when we 

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:06.110
 master the game well so the little 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:07.720
 technique that I use I pass on the 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:09.940
 left 

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:11.830
 here and go it goes like that I do 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:14.800
 a big strain loses no time 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:20.320
 it should go again one more 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:22.000
 once a mega so we will get there 

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:24.720
 seven minutes of torture what's so vexing 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.380
 this umi we intrusion torture 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:30.230
 no I'm wasting time 

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:31.760
 Taïg Khris is not perfect it perfect 

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:34.510
 remember it got me drunk under him 

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:34.510
 mows I try to focus 

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:37.940
 especially that the gb is even more I like 

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:39.470
 by check with me pretty fast and I 

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:40.580
 do not even know if I'm in 3g in look 

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:42.020
 difficult so I say no bullshit 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:43.550
 but I struggled hard 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:47.060
 because you must not mess with me 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:48.440
 not a firefighter I swear to you that problem 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:50.960
 it's that I know I 'm getting there but it's 

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:54.620
 it was so many times a pixel 

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:56.240
 even though I'm pissing off what I'm calling for 

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:57.380
 for example to I play I'm going to 

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.700
 correct delivery but it's not 

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:02.750
 still my best performance far from 

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:05.070
 there when really far away from there 

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:05.690
 master's degree master's degree go go 

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:09.030
 going 

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:12.180
 and here and I spoiled you super 

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:15.120
 mario bros in a tough look without land 

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:16.980
 of life and without even taking a power 

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:19.710
 after that I think what can be said 

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:20.790
 it's respectful can not be what and 

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:22.080
 so what I want to say to 

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:24.390
 play in the field pisi and fluff with 

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:28.460
 your little spoil of beautiful pee 

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:35.040
 golden gods i want to say what 

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:37.140
 ultimate mastery will be made extremely 

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:38.730
 pleasure to make you this video I 

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:40.650
 did not think that to succeed so fast I 

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:43.500
 have been training what since yesterday virgin 

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:44.610
 to replay and and here I had my ski 

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:46.200
 for me I get up doubled triplets 

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:47.610
 point that we can really all the time 

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:50.880
 was improving this game it's amazing 

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:52.680
 really really really it's 

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:54.660
 these voices, it's for me this game is 

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:56.100
 the ultimate platform game via donations 

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:58.600
 anyone in the trias that you all want 

00:06:56.100 --> 00:07:00.610
 the huge machine games what 

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:02.170
 in terms of gaming sensations w the 

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:04.510
 perfect design meant all that 

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:06.280
 you want this game there it is right 

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:09.640
 indrostable we did not do better I 

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:12.520
 see no frills nothing from fun to
