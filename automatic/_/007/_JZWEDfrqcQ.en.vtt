again<00:03:52.290> just<00:03:53.250> to<00:03:54.169> capitalize<00:03:55.169> on<00:03:55.879> you<00:03:56.879> know<00:03:57.000> the

00:03:57.379 --> 00:03:57.389 
again just to capitalize on you know the

00:03:57.389 --> 00:03:59.530 
again just to capitalize on you know the
amount<00:03:57.659> of<00:03:57.870> money<00:03:58.139> that's<00:03:58.470> out<00:03:58.680> there<00:03:58.889> for<00:03:59.159> him

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
amount of money that's out there for him

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:03.460 
amount of money that's out there for him
so<00:04:00.540> that's<00:04:01.169> what<00:04:01.409> it<00:04:01.440> is<00:04:01.650> right<00:04:01.859> now<00:04:02.069> Marquez

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.470 
so that's what it is right now Marquez

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:06.589 
so that's what it is right now Marquez
considering<00:04:04.470> retirement<00:04:04.859> it<00:04:05.549> is<00:04:06.180> what<00:04:06.419> it<00:04:06.540> is

00:04:06.589 --> 00:04:06.599
