us a lot earlier and I have found to be

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.459 
us a lot earlier and I have found to be
a<00:00:32.070> much<00:00:32.369> nicer<00:00:32.969> and<00:00:33.210> much<00:00:33.840> more<00:00:34.110> enjoyable

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
of issues it is a I just like the figure

better<00:00:41.520> than<00:00:41.730> RC<00:00:42.420> I<00:00:42.660> can<00:00:42.960> actually<00:00:43.110> transform

her<00:00:43.890> back<00:00:44.040> into<00:00:44.219> bike<00:00:44.399> mode<00:00:44.670> unlike<00:00:45.180> RC<00:00:45.570> so<00:00:46.350> as

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
her back into bike mode unlike RC so as

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.170 
her back into bike mode unlike RC so as
you<00:00:46.920> can<00:00:47.039> see<00:00:48.320> fully<00:00:49.320> extended<00:00:50.010> RC<00:00:50.520> is<00:00:50.789> taller

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
you can see fully extended RC is taller

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.069 
you can see fully extended RC is taller
and<00:00:51.980> but<00:00:52.980> not<00:00:53.190> nice<00:00:53.579> not<00:00:54.000> nearly<00:00:54.570> as<00:00:54.840> nicely

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
and but not nice not nearly as nicely

and but not nice not nearly as nicely
proportioned<00:00:55.649> as<00:00:56.160> chromia<00:00:56.789> now<00:00:56.940> I<00:00:57.120> put<00:00:57.360> the

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
proportioned as chromia now I put the

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.369 
proportioned as chromia now I put the
wheel<00:00:57.750> back<00:00:57.809> on<00:00:58.050> chromia<00:00:58.739> you<00:00:59.489> can<00:00:59.699> actually

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:00.379 
wheel back on chromia you can actually

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:03.799 
wheel back on chromia you can actually
swing<00:01:01.379> the<00:01:01.500> wheel<00:01:01.649> up<00:01:01.890> over<00:01:02.489> her<00:01:02.730> head<00:01:02.940> if<00:01:03.539> you

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
swing the wheel up over her head if you

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.230 
swing the wheel up over her head if you
want<00:01:03.960> I<00:01:04.290> prefer<00:01:04.949> having<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.580> wheel<00:01:05.909> a<00:01:06.210> little

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
want I prefer having the wheel a little

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.600 
want I prefer having the wheel a little
bit<00:01:06.510> hidden<00:01:06.780> in<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.140> back<00:01:07.290> that's<00:01:08.280> just<00:01:08.520> my

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
bit hidden in the back that's just my

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.039 
bit hidden in the back that's just my
personal<00:01:09.000> preference<00:01:10.159> unlike<00:01:11.159> RC<00:01:12.049> chromia

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
personal preference unlike RC chromia

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:18.800 
personal preference unlike RC chromia
has<00:01:13.799> one<00:01:14.159> real<00:01:14.610> hand<00:01:15.000> one<00:01:15.390> gun<00:01:15.930> hand<00:01:17.360> but<00:01:18.360> her

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
has one real hand one gun hand but her

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.050 
has one real hand one gun hand but her
stand<00:01:19.140> is<00:01:19.350> I<00:01:19.590> think<00:01:19.770> much<00:01:20.100> nicer<00:01:20.549> and<00:01:20.729> it's

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
stand is I think much nicer and it's

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.420 
stand is I think much nicer and it's
much<00:01:21.270> nicer<00:01:21.420> in<00:01:21.840> vehicle<00:01:22.259> mode<00:01:22.290> as<00:01:22.500> well<00:01:22.650> the

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
much nicer in vehicle mode as well the

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.130 
much nicer in vehicle mode as well the
other<00:01:23.580> reason<00:01:23.850> I<00:01:23.909> pulled<00:01:24.150> chromium<00:01:24.720> out<00:01:24.900> of

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
other reason I pulled chromium out of

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.760 
other reason I pulled chromium out of
the<00:01:25.619> box<00:01:25.850> is<00:01:26.850> because<00:01:27.390> I<00:01:27.420> wanted<00:01:27.720> to<00:01:27.810> just<00:01:28.350> take

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
the box is because I wanted to just take

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.580 
the box is because I wanted to just take
a<00:01:28.829> look<00:01:29.040> at<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.490> combining<00:01:30.210> of<00:01:30.659> these<00:01:31.350> two

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
a look at the combining of these two

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.280 
a look at the combining of these two
figures<00:01:31.829> so<00:01:32.820> as<00:01:33.210> you<00:01:33.360> can<00:01:33.450> see<00:01:33.659> this<00:01:33.810> piece

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
figures so as you can see this piece

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.620 
figures so as you can see this piece
right<00:01:34.530> here<00:01:34.590> just<00:01:35.070> kind<00:01:35.340> of<00:01:35.400> folds<00:01:35.850> down<00:01:36.060> upon

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
right here just kind of folds down upon

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.410 
right here just kind of folds down upon
RC<00:01:37.140> and<00:01:38.040> I<00:01:38.970> guess<00:01:39.240> you<00:01:39.509> can<00:01:39.750> get<00:01:40.880> the<00:01:41.880> farm<00:01:42.150> in

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
RC and I guess you can get the farm in

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.210 
RC and I guess you can get the farm in
such<00:01:42.659> a<00:01:42.689> way<00:01:42.960> that<00:01:42.990> it's<00:01:43.409> not<00:01:43.649> in<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.100> way

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
such a way that it's not in the way

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.819 
such a way that it's not in the way
there<00:01:44.460> we<00:01:44.579> out<00:01:44.670> that<00:01:44.909> works<00:01:45.119> and<00:01:45.540> on<00:01:46.200> chromia

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
there we out that works and on chromia

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.889 
there we out that works and on chromia
that<00:01:47.610> piece<00:01:47.850> is<00:01:48.030> actually<00:01:48.180> connected<00:01:48.810> to<00:01:48.840> the

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
that piece is actually connected to the

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:53.060 
that piece is actually connected to the
kickstand<00:01:49.470> which<00:01:50.000> slides<00:01:51.000> right<00:01:51.270> up<00:01:51.649> so<00:01:52.649> how

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
kickstand which slides right up so how

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.310 
kickstand which slides right up so how
do<00:01:53.130> you<00:01:53.250> connect<00:01:53.549> them<00:01:53.700> well<00:01:54.390> there's<00:01:55.170> this

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
do you connect them well there's this

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.830 
do you connect them well there's this
little<00:01:55.500> tab<00:01:55.860> right<00:01:56.159> here<00:01:56.280> and<00:01:56.880> it<00:01:57.030> slides<00:01:57.420> into

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
little tab right here and it slides into

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.149 
little tab right here and it slides into
the<00:01:58.579> bit<00:01:59.579> here<00:02:00.360> so<00:02:00.689> I'll<00:02:00.780> just<00:02:00.869> show<00:02:01.259> you<00:02:01.290> there

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
the bit here so I'll just show you there

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.999 
the bit here so I'll just show you there
we<00:02:02.250> go<00:02:02.369> and<00:02:03.090> now<00:02:03.149> we<00:02:03.780> have<00:02:04.020> one<00:02:04.259> figure<00:02:04.590> hanging

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
we go and now we have one figure hanging

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.270 
we go and now we have one figure hanging
off<00:02:05.159> of<00:02:05.189> another<00:02:06.680> I'm<00:02:07.680> just<00:02:07.890> holding<00:02:08.220> it

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
off of another I'm just holding it

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.140 
off of another I'm just holding it
because<00:02:08.369> I<00:02:08.520> don't<00:02:08.670> want<00:02:08.789> to<00:02:08.849> break<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.239> tab

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
because I don't want to break the tab

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.720 
because I don't want to break the tab
not<00:02:12.150> totally<00:02:13.050> sure<00:02:13.230> how<00:02:13.950> this<00:02:14.129> is<00:02:14.190> supposed<00:02:14.370> to

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
not totally sure how this is supposed to

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.559 
not totally sure how this is supposed to
work<00:02:15.140> there's<00:02:16.140> going<00:02:16.620> to<00:02:16.739> be<00:02:17.569> supposedly

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
work there's going to be supposedly

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:21.759 
work there's going to be supposedly
according<00:02:18.989> to<00:02:19.080> Hasbro<00:02:19.500> a<00:02:19.680> third<00:02:20.040> bike<00:02:20.459> bit<00:02:21.450> uh

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:21.769 
according to Hasbro a third bike bit uh

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:26.570 
according to Hasbro a third bike bit uh
connects<00:02:22.769> here<00:02:23.090> um<00:02:24.500> that<00:02:25.500> is<00:02:25.739> going<00:02:26.069> to<00:02:26.190> be<00:02:26.340> a

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
connects here um that is going to be a

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.220 
connects here um that is going to be a
jumbled<00:02:27.060> mess<00:02:27.090> the<00:02:27.690> only<00:02:27.900> thing<00:02:28.080> I<00:02:28.170> could

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
jumbled mess the only thing I could

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:34.190 
jumbled mess the only thing I could
think<00:02:28.379> of<00:02:28.890> is<00:02:29.750> that<00:02:32.209> based<00:02:33.209> on<00:02:33.450> the<00:02:33.660> picture

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
think of is that based on the picture

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.930 
think of is that based on the picture
that<00:02:34.560> was<00:02:34.709> released<00:02:35.129> a<00:02:35.340> little<00:02:35.489> while<00:02:35.730> ago

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
that was released a little while ago

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.640 
that was released a little while ago
it's<00:02:36.269> going<00:02:36.480> to<00:02:36.569> sit<00:02:36.840> like<00:02:37.049> this<00:02:37.099> maybe<00:02:38.099> I<00:02:39.650> have

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
it's going to sit like this maybe I have

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.500 
it's going to sit like this maybe I have
no<00:02:40.920> idea<00:02:41.190> how<00:02:41.310> this<00:02:41.489> is<00:02:41.610> gonna<00:02:41.700> work<00:02:41.819> I<00:02:42.329> mean

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
no idea how this is gonna work I mean

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.050 
no idea how this is gonna work I mean
you've<00:02:42.720> just<00:02:42.750> got<00:02:43.200> motorcycle<00:02:44.190> bits<00:02:44.489> hanging

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
you've just got motorcycle bits hanging

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.509 
you've just got motorcycle bits hanging
off<00:02:45.239> everywhere

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 
off everywhere

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:51.680 
off everywhere
I<00:02:48.799> mean<00:02:49.799> chromia<00:02:50.190> right<00:02:50.459> now<00:02:50.670> isn't<00:02:51.120> even<00:02:51.329> tall

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
I mean chromia right now isn't even tall

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.390 
I mean chromia right now isn't even tall
enough<00:02:51.720> to<00:02:53.239> well<00:02:54.239> the<00:02:54.360> way<00:02:54.480> this<00:02:54.660> is<00:02:54.870> working

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
enough to well the way this is working

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.210 
enough to well the way this is working
it's<00:02:56.400> just<00:02:56.610> I<00:02:56.790> don't<00:02:56.849> even<00:02:57.030> know<00:02:57.269> I<00:02:58.010> mean<00:02:59.010> I

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
it's just I don't even know I mean I

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:04.850 
it's just I don't even know I mean I
guess<00:02:59.579> you<00:02:59.940> could<00:03:00.590> kind<00:03:01.590> of<00:03:01.799> do<00:03:01.980> that<00:03:03.560> I'd<00:03:04.560> I

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
guess you could kind of do that I'd I

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.050 
guess you could kind of do that I'd I
don't<00:03:04.890> know<00:03:06.799> the<00:03:07.799> Hasbro<00:03:08.220> engineers<00:03:08.670> or<00:03:08.940> two

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
don't know the Hasbro engineers or two

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.610 
don't know the Hasbro engineers or two
car<00:03:09.299> engineers<00:03:09.690> or<00:03:09.930> whoever<00:03:10.230> the<00:03:10.319> hell<00:03:10.349> is

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
car engineers or whoever the hell is

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.890 
car engineers or whoever the hell is
engineering<00:03:11.040> this<00:03:11.250> thing<00:03:11.459> has<00:03:12.090> much<00:03:12.690> better

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
engineering this thing has much better

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.490 
engineering this thing has much better
clue<00:03:13.290> than<00:03:13.470> I<00:03:13.590> do<00:03:13.650> of<00:03:14.090> course<00:03:15.090> that's<00:03:15.930> not<00:03:16.200> to

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
clue than I do of course that's not to

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.449 
clue than I do of course that's not to
say<00:03:16.739> that<00:03:17.069> it<00:03:17.310> won't<00:03:17.459> though<00:03:17.760> like<00:03:19.310> see<00:03:20.310> if<00:03:20.370> I

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
say that it won't though like see if I

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:26.890 
say that it won't though like see if I
can<00:03:20.639> get<00:03:20.760> this<00:03:20.910> like<00:03:22.100> this<00:03:23.100> that<00:03:23.430> was<00:03:23.609> chromia

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:31.220 

yeah<00:03:27.900> I<00:03:27.930> can't<00:03:28.290> even<00:03:29.329> get<00:03:30.329> that<00:03:30.540> to<00:03:30.750> line<00:03:30.780> up

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
yeah I can't even get that to line up

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.849 
yeah I can't even get that to line up
right<00:03:32.030> sorry<00:03:33.030> sorry<00:03:33.299> I'm<00:03:33.989> just<00:03:34.230> I'm<00:03:34.470> trying<00:03:34.739> to

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:34.859 
right sorry sorry I'm just I'm trying to

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:37.759 
right sorry sorry I'm just I'm trying to
get<00:03:35.040> these<00:03:35.340> two<00:03:35.400> pieces<00:03:35.880> to<00:03:36.269> connect<00:03:36.630> and<00:03:36.930> they

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
get these two pieces to connect and they

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:39.319 
get these two pieces to connect and they
don't<00:03:38.069> there<00:03:38.849> we<00:03:38.940> go

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:39.329 
don't there we go

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:42.890 
don't there we go
I<00:03:39.359> mean<00:03:40.109> that's<00:03:40.290> not<00:03:40.500> to<00:03:40.560> say<00:03:40.889> that<00:03:41.329> RC<00:03:42.329> doesn't

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
I mean that's not to say that RC doesn't

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.650 
I mean that's not to say that RC doesn't
attach<00:03:43.319> to<00:03:43.739> chromia<00:03:44.310> the<00:03:44.730> other<00:03:44.910> way<00:03:45.120> so<00:03:45.480> this

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
attach to chromia the other way so this

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.409 
attach to chromia the other way so this
would<00:03:45.840> be<00:03:45.959> the<00:03:46.079> other<00:03:46.200> way<00:03:46.440> that<00:03:47.370> just<00:03:48.030> kind<00:03:48.389> of

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:48.419 
would be the other way that just kind of

00:03:48.419 --> 00:03:56.259 
would be the other way that just kind of
broke<00:03:48.720> off<00:03:48.989> oh<00:03:54.169> isn't<00:03:55.169> that<00:03:55.349> nice<00:03:55.769> the

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:56.269 
broke off oh isn't that nice the

00:03:56.269 --> 00:04:01.430 
broke off oh isn't that nice the
connector<00:03:57.269> bit<00:03:57.510> on<00:03:58.500> RC<00:03:59.250> just<00:04:00.180> falls<00:04:00.930> right<00:04:01.109> off

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
connector bit on RC just falls right off

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:09.230 
connector bit on RC just falls right off
nice<00:04:02.780> so<00:04:03.780> maybe<00:04:03.810> it<00:04:05.150> damnit

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:09.240 

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:14.930

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:18.980 
let's try it again with chromia being

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:23.620 
let's try it again with chromia being
there

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:31.790

with<00:04:36.690> the<00:04:36.900> third<00:04:37.170> figure<00:04:37.440> not<00:04:37.860> even<00:04:38.310> being

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 
with the third figure not even being

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:46.120 
with the third figure not even being
released<00:04:38.970> yet<00:04:39.120> it's<00:04:39.570> impossible<00:04:40.260> to<00:04:40.380> say<00:04:42.950> so<00:04:43.950> I
