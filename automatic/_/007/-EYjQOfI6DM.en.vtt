00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:01.699
 bats drawing four curves of 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.699

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:34.789
 draw a house making a rectangle and 

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:38.079
 then a triangle on top 

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:38.079
 with your toothpick 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:55.320
 the window uses your pointer again and 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.800
 also paint a door with your small one 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.800

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:10.310
 in the middle finger and the ring finger we will 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:13.430
 a few kittens with black enamel draws a 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:16.510
 rectangle and then the little ears forming 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.510
 two triangles 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:32.469

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.769
 in the little finger and repeat the same as in 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.290
 the index 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:07.620
 but as if the house was a bit 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.620
 closer 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:22.450
