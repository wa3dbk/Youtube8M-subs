00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
this is a fast drying thing so that that

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.690 
this is a fast drying thing so that that
doesn't<00:02:04.340> seem<00:02:04.759> like<00:02:05.180> it<00:02:05.299> is<00:02:05.360> extremely<00:02:05.990> wet

Crick's 39 Oscar which is a fine to
medium<00:02:20.770> nib<00:02:21.280> I<00:02:21.550> would<00:02:21.730> say<00:02:21.940> this<00:02:22.720> is<00:02:22.960> the

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:22.990

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:25.300 
is not something that would be

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:27.760 
is not something that would be

00:05:33.939 --> 00:05:33.949 
space on a as well and then I think we

00:05:33.949 --> 00:05:36.219 
space on a as well and then I think we
should<00:05:34.130> do<00:05:34.280> a<00:05:34.310> bit<00:05:34.699> of<00:05:34.759> this<00:05:35.539> is<00:05:35.690> just<00:05:35.930> ask

00:05:36.219 --> 00:05:36.229 
should do a bit of this is just ask

00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:39.249 
should do a bit of this is just ask
Ric's<00:05:37.599> ballpoint<00:05:38.599> that<00:05:38.780> matches<00:05:39.169> the

00:05:39.249 --> 00:05:39.259 
Ric's ballpoint that matches the

00:05:39.259 --> 00:05:46.409 
Ric's ballpoint that matches the
fountain<00:05:39.650> pen<00:05:39.860> same<00:05:40.250> name<00:05:43.330> quick<00:05:44.330> brown<00:05:44.539> fox

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:46.419 
fountain pen same name quick brown fox

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:49.930 
fountain pen same name quick brown fox
fox<00:05:47.419> clearly<00:05:48.020> there's<00:05:48.860> no<00:05:49.039> real<00:05:49.219> wetness<00:05:49.639> in<00:05:49.849> a

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:49.940 
fox clearly there's no real wetness in a

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:52.629 
fox clearly there's no real wetness in a
ballpoint<00:05:50.919> just<00:05:51.919> give<00:05:52.099> you<00:05:52.159> an<00:05:52.219> idea<00:05:52.280> what

00:05:52.629 --> 00:05:52.639 
ballpoint just give you an idea what

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:54.939 
ballpoint just give you an idea what
ballpoint<00:05:53.060> would<00:05:53.210> look<00:05:53.360> like<00:05:53.590> and<00:05:54.590> then

00:05:54.939 --> 00:05:54.949 
ballpoint would look like and then

00:05:54.949 --> 00:05:57.760 
ballpoint would look like and then
finally<00:05:55.550> I<00:05:55.789> think<00:05:56.180> we<00:05:56.659> need<00:05:56.900> to<00:05:57.139> have<00:05:57.440> a<00:05:57.500> look

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:57.770 
finally I think we need to have a look

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:04.390 
finally I think we need to have a look
at<00:05:58.039> a<00:05:58.070> six<00:05:58.580> millimeter<00:06:00.099> pilot<00:06:01.099> parallel<00:06:03.400> which

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:04.400 
at a six millimeter pilot parallel which

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:07.839 
at a six millimeter pilot parallel which
is<00:06:05.080> six<00:06:06.080> millimeters<00:06:06.710> so<00:06:06.949> this<00:06:07.130> is<00:06:07.310> a<00:06:07.340> very

00:06:07.839 --> 00:06:07.849 
is six millimeters so this is a very

00:06:07.849 --> 00:06:21.010 
is six millimeters so this is a very
broad<00:06:08.270> nib

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:21.020 

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:24.880 

the<00:06:21.680> paper<00:06:21.980> is<00:06:22.340> very<00:06:23.210> smooth<00:06:23.720> which<00:06:24.290> I<00:06:24.560> have<00:06:24.740> to

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:24.890 
the paper is very smooth which I have to

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:28.150 
the paper is very smooth which I have to
say<00:06:24.920> is<00:06:25.400> very<00:06:25.970> pleasant<00:06:26.300> for<00:06:26.720> calligraphy<00:06:27.160> you

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:28.160 
say is very pleasant for calligraphy you

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:29.830 
say is very pleasant for calligraphy you
don't<00:06:28.340> get<00:06:28.490> the<00:06:28.670> texture<00:06:29.090> so<00:06:29.120> your<00:06:29.510> nib

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:29.840 
don't get the texture so your nib

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:31.810 
don't get the texture so your nib
doesn't<00:06:30.170> get<00:06:30.320> snagged<00:06:30.770> and<00:06:31.310> you<00:06:31.460> can<00:06:31.610> really

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:31.820 
doesn't get snagged and you can really

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:36.280 
doesn't get snagged and you can really
make<00:06:32.030> nice<00:06:33.670> flowing<00:06:34.670> lines<00:06:35.090> which<00:06:35.960> is<00:06:36.080> very

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:36.290 
make nice flowing lines which is very

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:39.760 
make nice flowing lines which is very
cool<00:06:36.550> okay<00:06:37.550> guys<00:06:37.790> I<00:06:38.450> don't<00:06:39.050> see<00:06:39.440> any

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:39.770 
cool okay guys I don't see any

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:42.640 
cool okay guys I don't see any
feathering<00:06:40.310> in<00:06:40.640> any<00:06:40.940> of<00:06:41.090> these<00:06:41.240> pens<00:06:41.660> except

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:42.650 
feathering in any of these pens except

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:46.090 
feathering in any of these pens except
maybe<00:06:43.070> for<00:06:43.430> the<00:06:43.730> Delta<00:06:44.150> but<00:06:44.990> that<00:06:45.290> is<00:06:45.710> as<00:06:46.070> I

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:46.100 
maybe for the Delta but that is as I

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:50.980 
maybe for the Delta but that is as I
said<00:06:46.490> an<00:06:46.730> ink<00:06:47.030> O's<00:06:47.300> and<00:06:47.830> even<00:06:48.830> here<00:06:49.310> I<00:06:49.990> would

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:50.990 
said an ink O's and even here I would

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:54.100 
said an ink O's and even here I would
say<00:06:51.230> it's<00:06:52.030> definitely<00:06:53.030> not<00:06:53.300> terrible<00:06:53.870> and

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:54.110 
say it's definitely not terrible and

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:56.980 
say it's definitely not terrible and
again<00:06:55.070> that<00:06:55.280> is<00:06:55.400> pushing<00:06:55.730> it<00:06:55.970> that<00:06:56.120> is<00:06:56.270> a<00:06:56.300> super

00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:56.990 
again that is pushing it that is a super

00:06:56.990 --> 00:07:01.150 
again that is pushing it that is a super
wet<00:06:57.200> ultra<00:06:57.920> broad<00:06:58.190> nib<00:06:59.260> that<00:07:00.260> just<00:07:00.830> you<00:07:01.040> know

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:01.160 
wet ultra broad nib that just you know

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:04.210 
wet ultra broad nib that just you know
just<00:07:01.960> hoses<00:07:02.960> ink<00:07:03.170> on<00:07:03.320> the<00:07:03.440> paper<00:07:03.650> but<00:07:03.890> even<00:07:04.130> if

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:04.220 
just hoses ink on the paper but even if

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:06.760 
just hoses ink on the paper but even if
you<00:07:04.340> look<00:07:04.490> at<00:07:04.610> that<00:07:04.760> puddle<00:07:05.030> I<00:07:05.240> made<00:07:05.480> it's<00:07:06.470> not

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:06.770 
you look at that puddle I made it's not

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:09.190 
you look at that puddle I made it's not
even<00:07:07.160> that<00:07:07.520> terrible<00:07:08.150> the<00:07:08.570> feathering<00:07:08.930> I

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:09.200 
even that terrible the feathering I

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:11.110 
even that terrible the feathering I
would<00:07:09.320> say<00:07:09.470> is<00:07:09.620> very<00:07:09.680> very<00:07:10.550> much<00:07:10.790> under

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:11.120 
would say is very very much under

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:11.650 
would say is very very much under
control

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:11.660 
control

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:14.170 
control
so<00:07:12.290> what<00:07:12.500> we<00:07:12.710> need<00:07:12.890> to<00:07:13.040> see<00:07:13.220> now<00:07:13.460> is<00:07:13.820> bleep

00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:14.180 
so what we need to see now is bleep

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:17.110 
so what we need to see now is bleep
through<00:07:14.450> or<00:07:14.690> show<00:07:15.200> them<00:07:15.530> the<00:07:16.460> paper<00:07:16.700> is<00:07:16.910> torn

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:17.120 
through or show them the paper is torn

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:19.270 
through or show them the paper is torn
off<00:07:17.360> very<00:07:17.870> easily<00:07:18.170> from<00:07:18.530> this<00:07:18.740> pad<00:07:18.980> which<00:07:19.250> is

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:19.280 
off very easily from this pad which is

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:24.960 
off very easily from this pad which is
very<00:07:19.610> plain<00:07:21.910> let's<00:07:22.910> turn<00:07:23.120> the<00:07:23.270> paper<00:07:23.450> around<00:07:23.630> I

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:24.970 
very plain let's turn the paper around I

00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:27.850 
very plain let's turn the paper around I
don't<00:07:25.970> see<00:07:26.450> any<00:07:26.720> bleed<00:07:27.230> through<00:07:27.470> of<00:07:27.740> the

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:27.860 
don't see any bleed through of the

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:31.720 
don't see any bleed through of the
writing<00:07:28.310> that<00:07:29.240> is<00:07:29.420> a<00:07:29.660> little<00:07:30.290> bit<00:07:30.470> here<00:07:30.830> for

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:31.730 
writing that is a little bit here for

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:36.190 
writing that is a little bit here for
the<00:07:31.820> Delta<00:07:32.890> but<00:07:33.890> that<00:07:34.640> too<00:07:34.940> is<00:07:34.970> is<00:07:35.450> very

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:36.200 
the Delta but that too is is very

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:40.360 
the Delta but that too is is very
controlled<00:07:37.000> a<00:07:38.050> zoom<00:07:39.050> out<00:07:39.200> a<00:07:39.260> bit<00:07:39.350> here<00:07:39.770> and

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:40.370 
controlled a zoom out a bit here and

00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:43.630 
controlled a zoom out a bit here and
even<00:07:40.640> for<00:07:41.030> that<00:07:41.150> six<00:07:41.510> millimeter<00:07:42.070> pilot<00:07:43.100> it

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:43.640 
even for that six millimeter pilot it

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:45.610 
even for that six millimeter pilot it
says<00:07:43.910> not<00:07:44.090> no<00:07:44.420> bleed<00:07:44.690> through<00:07:44.870> and<00:07:45.140> there's

00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:45.620 
says not no bleed through and there's

00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:48.100 
says not no bleed through and there's
hardly<00:07:45.950> any<00:07:46.370> show<00:07:46.670> room<00:07:46.940> you<00:07:47.300> don't<00:07:47.510> even<00:07:47.840> see

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:48.110 
hardly any show room you don't even see

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:49.510 
hardly any show room you don't even see
that<00:07:48.140> the<00:07:48.440> other<00:07:48.650> side<00:07:48.920> of<00:07:49.010> this<00:07:49.100> page<00:07:49.310> has

00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:49.520 
that the other side of this page has

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:51.430 
that the other side of this page has
been<00:07:49.610> written<00:07:49.790> on<00:07:50.000> for<00:07:50.300> the<00:07:50.360> most<00:07:50.570> part<00:07:50.870> so<00:07:51.200> I

00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:51.440 
been written on for the most part so I

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:54.460 
been written on for the most part so I
am<00:07:52.100> quite<00:07:52.520> impressed<00:07:53.060> especially<00:07:53.930> because

00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:54.470 
am quite impressed especially because

00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:57.730 
am quite impressed especially because
the<00:07:54.740> price<00:07:54.980> of<00:07:55.010> this<00:07:55.340> pad<00:07:55.640> was<00:07:56.600> 2<00:07:56.930> euros<00:07:57.260> and<00:07:57.440> 50

00:07:57.730 --> 00:07:57.740 
the price of this pad was 2 euros and 50

00:07:57.740 --> 00:08:00.460 
the price of this pad was 2 euros and 50
cents<00:07:58.100> which<00:07:58.580> really<00:07:59.120> isn't<00:07:59.420> that<00:07:59.630> much<00:07:59.750> for

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:00.470 
cents which really isn't that much for

00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:05.170 
cents which really isn't that much for
what<00:08:01.340> you<00:08:01.850> get<00:08:02.030> it's<00:08:02.510> 50<00:08:03.200> sheets<00:08:03.650> of<00:08:03.890> paper<00:08:04.180> and

00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:05.180 
what you get it's 50 sheets of paper and

00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:07.120 
what you get it's 50 sheets of paper and
it's<00:08:05.390> super<00:08:05.810> high<00:08:05.960> quality<00:08:05.990> so<00:08:06.770> I'm<00:08:06.890> very

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:07.130 
it's super high quality so I'm very
