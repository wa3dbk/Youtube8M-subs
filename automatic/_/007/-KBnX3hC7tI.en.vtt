00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.250
 and now it's in the company of Henri Clichy that we captured this 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:09.500
 small crustacean resembling a flight the surplus of 4 8% 

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:14.059
 they have in the wet sand and the substrates one meets it between the 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:15.609
 solitary 

00:00:15.609 --> 00:00:16.820
 they dig galleries 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.330
 his google defense he makes seasonal moves of low 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:21.289
 amplitude 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:23.410
 a beer pump about twenty 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:26.410
 are often used for catching these stomato prod 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.789
 it's early morning that the fisherman gives us an appointment for this 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.449
 next fishing party 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:35.460
 we'll be it's finally cornered on an aquaculture farm in order to initiate Libyan 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.590
 chef with different fishing techniques practiced in 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:41.590
 this region a beautiful day in perspective 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.290
 m 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:49.570
 mua 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.610
 no 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.610
 the amateur fishing technique which is a bit different 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.330
 because we are already going through the match sheet go further and who 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:00.660
 until now 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:01.980
 to use the term 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.850
 we have 90 90 very very flexible 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.620
 it's a studio system is still fishing tight 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:11.620
 and so that's why short-term growth 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:15.690
 in a pan use small pellets 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.930
 little carpistes plumber after that depends pink 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:21.600
 so m 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.600
 we will put them live 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:29.230
 why this plan includes answers 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.760
 after to stop this do not understand all the senses on the hook 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.290
 but who is what are called author stops 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.320
 said for plugs and that we also use 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:40.760
 indeed the plan 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:41.870
 since the 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:44.780
 the cost of the plan and bigger than the sport plants 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.930
 we pass a small pearl a small flexible pearl 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.310
 who will come block 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.939
 in fact what one suspects however if these affirmations to good insurance 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.130
 launch 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.090
 ap a sumptuous pearl coming crashing against strong stan that if you 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.920
 by the saying 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.920
 it'll get you down in this report 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.929
 on the assembly 

00:02:12.929 --> 00:02:13.919
 m 

00:02:13.919 --> 00:02:16.129
 so everything in a bag 

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:17.020
 then after 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:18.359
 live on the wire 

00:02:18.359 --> 00:02:19.869
 we go up to the hook 

00:02:19.869 --> 00:02:22.449
 ban has all it takes to say it's still a bit that we do not put 

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:26.189
 the soul are a function of the ph healthy weight and according to the km passover 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:31.219
 at mans the day before the match at the tournament 

00:02:31.219 --> 00:02:34.239
 we will do everything so you say here and there 

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:37.879
 here with his world by announcing to the neighborhood house 

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:40.679
 in a very good sense 

00:02:40.679 --> 00:02:43.479
 at the mental plane of a jump 

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:46.299
 France 5 broadcast loop like that 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:48.889
 let's put firming cream or you pass in the blood 

00:02:48.889 --> 00:02:51.299
 at best to buckle it 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:52.679
 so your son 

00:02:52.679 --> 00:02:55.819
 and that the bridge around programming 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:57.269
 quite simply 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:00.269
 after good when you pass it in the loop 

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:08.109
 in order to overcome 

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:13.379
 this couple with senna 

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:14.949
 so now 

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:17.949
 we will focus on the hook 

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:23.039
 so you learn that the same time thornton 11 o'clock 

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:25.780
 and for other readers 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:27.589
 just before the holidays the passage 

00:03:27.589 --> 00:03:30.339
 so you spend your soul center leclerc la baumette 

00:03:30.339 --> 00:03:34.019
 the expedition to its eight days of the sea it's like that directly on 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:37.489
 sense and eight more than him the city of padang 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:39.819
 I am the curve of the masts simply 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:41.099
 once you have passed 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:43.819
 like that you did similar because we say 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:47.499
 autonomous sanctifies the puck anyway pulls out the attitude of power and hard 

00:03:47.499 --> 00:03:48.619
 at random 

00:03:48.619 --> 00:03:51.949
 you do not go out the time lapse in the blood between the parties 

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:54.949
 it's not like that and then it allows 

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:57.949
 she keeps moving 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:01.159
 and the fact that they are identifiable 

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:03.250
 it's more attentive to hasty conclusions 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:06.250
 to attract fish 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:11.049
 here is the editing so a final there we are ready to fish 

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:14.709
 shortly after Turin being in France by fleets depending on the length in 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:16.209
 my line that is to say that there 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:19.209
 we will put about 80 90 centimeters 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:22.809
 see the editing it will give me 100 shots 

00:04:22.809 --> 00:04:25.809
 so the plan will oppose the forms 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.350
 and extend on the departure 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:31.350
 so the most important structure can not overshadow 

00:04:33.309 --> 00:04:35.979
 here is a bit the same technique as the shelled crab 

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:39.350
 preventing direct there is no break between cambodia and the bottom of 

00:04:39.349 --> 00:04:40.969
 the long island by the best 

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:41.919
 in the long run 

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:44.680
 the man is cons I advise you not used this method for them 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.499
 big part of the ball 

00:04:46.499 --> 00:04:48.659
 as for all that is beautiful apart 

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:50.199
 that is to say the bottom of the line 

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:53.639
 we try to fish much finer than the body of lyne to honor his 

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:56.870
 hundredth when we fish lab we will try to fish as the points 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:59.979
 are burdened with the molds of the Jews at the bottom we are piqued doubt 

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:03.249
 So we try to put the corps de ligne in France completely rewritten 

00:05:03.249 --> 00:05:05.809
 60th from December against the bottom of the building 

00:05:05.809 --> 00:05:10.019
 this lab are still pretty cunning so that brandishing from December 

00:05:10.019 --> 00:05:13.819
 22 or 23 hundredths down the line depending on the clarity of the water in 

00:05:13.819 --> 00:05:16.819
 function in the two environments in which you peach pears 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.699
 the madelinot adapts according to the environment in which we pass 

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:24.069
 so more to this team is a macho own 

00:05:24.069 --> 00:05:27.360
 we ourselves can also use it for the little soft and the 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:28.159
 small jobs 

00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:30.509
 but for all that is said various trawl 

00:05:30.509 --> 00:05:33.569
 but you still have to ask my motto good because the water 

00:05:33.569 --> 00:05:36.490
 the problem is that if you approach anyway you break every dish all 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:39.319
 break for editing in fact I take as a bottom line this is that 

00:05:39.319 --> 00:05:39.600
