00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:15.340
 well it was my method change 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.730
 I would ask her right now 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:21.430
 get up for 15 seconds and get in 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:27.400
 room to look and get it all 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:29.710
 remember what you see only what is red 15 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:35.520
 Please seconds just about to get up 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:35.520
 and remember everything that is good 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.680
 Thank you, then you are welcome again 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.680
 sit down 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.820
 Well and now we need this one 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.900
 sheet of which I spoke before 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:57.780
 Now there's a test 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:59.489
 They all give a leaf a pen 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.940
 Anyone who does not have a pen 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.940
 Has 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.500
 so now I would ask her very calmly 

00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:17.140
 to be and not anymore 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:22.420
 to exchange yes, who gets infected 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:24.549
 have six-they are all ready now 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.079
 you ten seconds time i sit my 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:27.939
 but our students feel as well 

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:31.689
 always vigorous time pressure and now 

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:37.710
 Please write all on what you like 

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:37.710
 now know what was blue 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:46.000
 hello what is the storm for now 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.760
 wasserglas 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.070
 you will not believe me 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:54.840
 ask what you have learned 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.840
 the hitherto transfer required 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:09.940
 how else should I select mine? 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.340
 Now we have extra here in Bregenz 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.780
 Three exits created for the good ones 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.370
 for the middle ones for the bad and 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:20.770
 I already know which one 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:23.290
 the biggest must be we think so too 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:24.820
 for the good ones out there, yes, such a thing 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.520
 split small wall 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:29.110
 but the three-leaf door that is then 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.860
 on this page and each of them 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:35.950
 will go out through one of these doors 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:37.660
 they do not come around just that 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.780
 we do with our students 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:44.860
 we let them learn red then ask 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:47.530
 we blue and then we give notes and it 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:50.920
 only a few have one and two and 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:54.250
 already the note 3 students feel 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:57.010
 somehow as a failure, even if we 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.239
 telling them permanently answers is three 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.670
 but good grades 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:02.550
 I would like to have a small one 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:06.550
 to do thought experiment with them 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:10.620
 who of them would like to be 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:10.620
 number one for his partner 

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:20.920
 Quite a lot of people are not hunting them all 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:21.580
 others the others are probably just annoying 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.230
 home 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:25.660
 Imagine they are sitting with you 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:28.210
 your heart's partner somewhere 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:31.600
 dinner very romantic candlelight 

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:34.950
 and then your partner tells you so 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:37.710
 It's like that if you ask me yes 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:42.250
 okay 

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:46.900
 so mediocre so only the three but 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:49.750
 just the brazen good note because darkened 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:53.410
 every romanticism is with us 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:55.840
 there we have to look out of this 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:57.430
 number comes out again and that's exactly what 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.500
 it's what we basically took 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:02.770
 always expect our students 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:06.880
 we tell them halo mittelmaÃŸ to plus 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:09.520
 or worse, we actually feel 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:11.620
 what else we do to our children 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:15.160
 grown-ups are now so far away 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:16.870
 from the inner reality of the children that 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:20.260
 we do not remember any more 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:22.930
 experience catastrophes we expect them 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:25.390
 and that although we know by now 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:27.430
 human beings only grow on their strengths 

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:30.220
 brain research tells us that since 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:31.150
 but we do just that 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:34.750
 opposite 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:37.090
 we destroy with our mighty 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:39.370
 Music printing is the most important thing for children 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:43.420
 basis they learn at all 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:47.400
 have and believe in pushing yourself 

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:51.100
 give them a label with each note 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:53.830
 but students are not jam jars 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:57.430
 and when you really paint as a teacher 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:05:01.120
 the disappointment of a student seen 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:04.240
 if you have a job out there 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:06.820
 and when you have the hidden tears 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:09.850
 have discovered and underline 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:12.940
 Now you want to hide on 

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:15.760
 dearest among each of these notes one 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:18.070
 Write a sentence you are more important 

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:21.160
 because so far I would like now 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:25.540
 before I get to the final notes 

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:28.270
 they were fantastic 

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:30.420
 audience i see a lot of potential in 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:30.420
 them 

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:36.700
 it is the system where it is and 

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:40.630
 I think you deserve top marks 

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:43.090
 but so the very good touch has 

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:45.310
 one managed out namely my 

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:47.520
 public papa and a strong 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:47.520
 applause 

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:56.800
 we also have many parents here and me 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:58.570
 I know that parents want theirs 

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:00.970
 Children are well and really 

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:06.040
 hang it in, maybe it's straight 

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:07.870
 this situation in which you stand and 

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:09.880
 Let us have a little one more 

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:13.510
 to do thought experiment 

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:17.700
 let's take 20 years ago and 

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:17.700
 then the situation looks like this 

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:30.900
 and related to that the question was from 

00:06:27.819 --> 00:06:33.910
 Everything that is going on in school now 

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:36.099
 will then be really important 

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:40.030
 what do we want the children in theirs 

00:06:36.099 --> 00:06:43.270
 cv says do and give with and 

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:46.930
 what the pressure of now on her 

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:50.020
 child could take away if 

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:53.319
 she plays this perspective 

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:55.590
 then the geography 4 about the us so 

00:06:53.319 --> 00:06:59.580
 terribly upset in the seventh grade 

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:59.580
 He really plays a role
