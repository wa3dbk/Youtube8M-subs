 stir when the vegetables fry 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:47.079
 add hot water until the vegetables here 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:50.299
 now roast cook a full kettle 

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:52.520
 hot water and add it will be necessary 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:54.920
 so to close all the vegetables meat and more 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:59.590
 on the finger for 2 that the water was higher 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:04.149
 when the vegetables are fried we pour the full 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:04.149
 almost full kettle of hot water 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:12.670
 we pour water must cover all the meat 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:14.410
 and all the vegetables are like if you haven't 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:19.989
 enough as I have now you can 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:22.260
 still heat the water and still remove it is important 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:24.730
 then you can mix 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:27.340
 try adding spices 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:30.459
 salt because then when add rice 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:33.879
 nothing can be stirred 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:37.060
 pilaf can not and will add nothing 

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:37.720
 it will be impossible now here we will add 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:43.019
 more water 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:45.819
 what was somewhere on a finger higher than meat and 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:51.819
 wait until boils and the second important 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:55.090
 moment means add rice when 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:58.000
 boil water immediately add rice forest 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.920
 we are tormented in hot water but 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.709
 it is already cold then we drain the water and 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:07.030
 add rice important i say again in 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:10.000
 boiling water that is here when everything 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:12.850
 will now add rice in order 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.430
 so you do not that we had bad they 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:18.010
 porridge means two things are not important 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:20.889
 mix after added rice 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:26.560
 and add rice to hot so here you are 

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:29.260
 see meat boiling meat vegetables broth 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:32.440
 boils we added salt 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:34.630
 by the way the water should be a little salty 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.940
 slightly salty and must be water because 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:41.440
 now let's put up all loves and 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:46.450
 salt it absorbs itself in boiling water 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:49.540
 add rice important after 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:52.319
 added rice don't stir sour 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:59.460
 so here we will level here so to tear 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:04:06.270
 then it is necessary to make a few of these, I magician 

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:09.600
 we do yankeys all for a card we close 

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:10.020

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.270
 boils 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:15.060
 if you have a drink then wait until 

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:17.550
 it boils and after home a little fire 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:23.850
 we are at Nastya on the smallest fire 

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:27.860
 close the lid and wait about half an hour to 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:27.860
 the smallest fire we have 

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:39.530

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:44.410
 this and set aside it to insist 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:47.000
 come on now here is important how ready 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:52.970
 leave it like this is cover 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:56.650
