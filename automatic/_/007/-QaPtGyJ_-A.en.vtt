00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:12.969 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:15.940 

once<00:00:13.969> you<00:00:14.090> get<00:00:14.270> to<00:00:14.510> closer<00:00:15.260> to<00:00:15.440> the<00:00:15.530> season

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:15.950 
once you get to closer to the season

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:18.220 
once you get to closer to the season
you've<00:00:16.610> done<00:00:16.880> all<00:00:17.090> your<00:00:17.240> boat<00:00:17.480> work<00:00:17.779> all<00:00:18.020> your

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:18.230 
you've done all your boat work all your

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:20.230 
you've done all your boat work all your
strength<00:00:18.560> building<00:00:18.950> so<00:00:19.490> I<00:00:19.760> think<00:00:19.849> the<00:00:20.060> main

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:20.240 
strength building so I think the main

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.410 
strength building so I think the main
thing<00:00:20.270> is<00:00:20.509> in<00:00:21.230> your<00:00:21.349> cardio<00:00:21.710> in<00:00:21.770> and<00:00:22.240> one<00:00:23.240> thing

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:23.420 
thing is in your cardio in and one thing

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:25.179 
thing is in your cardio in and one thing
that<00:00:23.570> I<00:00:23.630> did<00:00:23.840> was<00:00:23.990> a<00:00:24.050> you<00:00:24.439> know<00:00:24.500> pull<00:00:24.800> the<00:00:24.950> sled

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:25.189 
that I did was a you know pull the sled

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:27.909 
that I did was a you know pull the sled
and<00:00:25.580> really<00:00:26.330> work<00:00:26.540> on<00:00:26.720> sort<00:00:27.380> of<00:00:27.470> explosion

00:00:27.909 --> 00:00:27.919 
and really work on sort of explosion

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:30.490 
and really work on sort of explosion
things<00:00:28.669> with<00:00:28.880> the<00:00:29.000> sled<00:00:29.270> but<00:00:29.899> then<00:00:30.020> secondly<00:00:30.410> I

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:30.500 
things with the sled but then secondly I

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.040 
things with the sled but then secondly I
was<00:00:30.890> working<00:00:31.250> a<00:00:31.310> lot<00:00:31.340> of<00:00:31.579> my<00:00:31.640> core<00:00:31.960> being<00:00:32.960> a

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:33.050 
was working a lot of my core being a

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:35.650 
was working a lot of my core being a
pastor<00:00:33.470> sphere<00:00:33.680> I<00:00:33.710> think<00:00:34.010> that<00:00:34.420> you<00:00:35.420> got<00:00:35.570> to

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:35.660 
pastor sphere I think that you got to

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:37.600 
pastor sphere I think that you got to
have<00:00:35.780> a<00:00:35.809> really<00:00:36.079> strong<00:00:36.290> core<00:00:36.590> cuz<00:00:36.920> we're<00:00:37.160> in

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:37.610 
have a really strong core cuz we're in

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.060 
have a really strong core cuz we're in
awkward<00:00:38.030> positions<00:00:38.090> all<00:00:38.660> the<00:00:38.809> time<00:00:39.070> secondly

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:40.070 
awkward positions all the time secondly

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.549 
awkward positions all the time secondly
I<00:00:40.160> did<00:00:40.370> a<00:00:40.399> lot<00:00:40.610> of<00:00:40.640> instability<00:00:41.450> work<00:00:41.899> with<00:00:42.350> the

00:00:42.549 --> 00:00:42.559 
I did a lot of instability work with the

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:45.010 
I did a lot of instability work with the
Werdum<00:00:42.980> X<00:00:43.130> machine<00:00:43.460> using<00:00:44.240> the<00:00:44.270> rubber<00:00:44.480> bands

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:45.020 
Werdum X machine using the rubber bands

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.470 
Werdum X machine using the rubber bands
doing<00:00:45.680> lateral<00:00:46.160> movements<00:00:46.820> doing<00:00:47.030> you<00:00:47.360> know

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:47.480 
doing lateral movements doing you know

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.210 
doing lateral movements doing you know
horizontal<00:00:48.410> movements<00:00:48.800> because<00:00:49.010> on<00:00:49.130> the

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:49.220 
horizontal movements because on the

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:51.460 
horizontal movements because on the
field<00:00:49.490> this<00:00:50.030> work<00:00:50.270> converts<00:00:50.630> -<00:00:50.870> you<00:00:51.290> never

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:51.470 
field this work converts - you never

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:53.770 
field this work converts - you never
want<00:00:51.650> to<00:00:51.710> just<00:00:51.980> have<00:00:52.340> to<00:00:52.370> do<00:00:52.700> a<00:00:52.970> regular<00:00:53.510> squat

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:53.780 
want to just have to do a regular squat

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.480 
want to just have to do a regular squat
or<00:00:54.050> regular<00:00:54.410> bench<00:00:54.590> everything<00:00:55.250> you're<00:00:55.370> going

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:55.490 
or regular bench everything you're going

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:56.770 
or regular bench everything you're going
to<00:00:55.550> do<00:00:55.640> you<00:00:55.730> want<00:00:55.910> to<00:00:55.940> be<00:00:56.030> moving<00:00:56.180> you<00:00:56.570> got<00:00:56.690> to

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:56.780 
to do you want to be moving you got to

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.690 
to do you want to be moving you got to
be<00:00:56.840> stable<00:00:57.200> doing<00:00:57.440> once<00:00:58.100> you<00:00:58.190> get<00:00:58.310> thirty<00:00:58.520> one

00:00:58.690 --> 00:00:58.700 
be stable doing once you get thirty one

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.250 
be stable doing once you get thirty one
year<00:00:58.850> as<00:00:59.210> strong<00:00:59.420> as<00:00:59.540> you<00:00:59.630> want<00:00:59.810> to<00:00:59.870> get<00:01:00.020> I

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 
year as strong as you want to get I

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.260 
year as strong as you want to get I
think<00:01:00.710> it<00:01:00.890> comes<00:01:01.160> down<00:01:01.370> to<00:01:01.430> maintaining<00:01:02.180> that

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:02.270 
think it comes down to maintaining that

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.600 
think it comes down to maintaining that
strength<00:01:02.630> but<00:01:02.900> now<00:01:03.440> what<00:01:03.770> intangible<00:01:04.400> you<00:01:04.489> can

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610 
strength but now what intangible you can

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:06.429 
strength but now what intangible you can
bring<00:01:04.790> to<00:01:04.909> the<00:01:05.030> game<00:01:05.210> and<00:01:05.479> that's<00:01:06.140> like<00:01:06.320> the

00:01:06.429 --> 00:01:06.439 
bring to the game and that's like the

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:08.319 
bring to the game and that's like the
drilled<00:01:06.650> I<00:01:06.740> did<00:01:06.920> today<00:01:07.070> working<00:01:07.729> on<00:01:07.850> more<00:01:08.060> good

00:01:08.319 --> 00:01:08.329 
drilled I did today working on more good

00:01:08.329 --> 00:01:11.590 
drilled I did today working on more good
cardio<00:01:08.890> instead<00:01:09.890> of<00:01:10.040> tearing<00:01:10.909> your<00:01:11.090> body<00:01:11.299> down

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
cardio instead of tearing your body down

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.569 
cardio instead of tearing your body down
using<00:01:12.290> a<00:01:12.470> lot<00:01:12.649> of<00:01:12.680> heavy<00:01:12.950> weights<00:01:13.189> you<00:01:13.340> still

00:01:13.569 --> 00:01:13.579 
using a lot of heavy weights you still

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:15.130 
using a lot of heavy weights you still
have<00:01:13.790> to<00:01:13.939> do<00:01:14.090> that<00:01:14.240> to<00:01:14.420> maintain<00:01:14.720> your

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
have to do that to maintain your

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.560 
have to do that to maintain your
maintain<00:01:15.650> your<00:01:15.770> strength<00:01:16.100> but<00:01:16.820> the<00:01:17.330> main

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
maintain your strength but the main

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.600 
maintain your strength but the main
thing<00:01:17.840> is<00:01:17.870> staying<00:01:18.590> in<00:01:18.920> shape<00:01:19.159> the<00:01:19.280> whole<00:01:19.370> time

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 
thing is staying in shape the whole time

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.130 
thing is staying in shape the whole time
because<00:01:19.760> as<00:01:20.120> you<00:01:20.330> get<00:01:20.479> older<00:01:20.720> you<00:01:20.810> get<00:01:20.900> out<00:01:21.020> of

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
because as you get older you get out of

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.250 
because as you get older you get out of
shape<00:01:21.790> when<00:01:22.790> you<00:01:22.820> think<00:01:23.420> about<00:01:23.659> I<00:01:23.900> think<00:01:23.930> the

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:24.260 
shape when you think about I think the

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.200 
shape when you think about I think the
maximum<00:01:24.740> performance<00:01:25.100> sure<00:01:25.640> you<00:01:25.820> think<00:01:26.030> about

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210 
maximum performance sure you think about

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.140 
maximum performance sure you think about
the<00:01:26.330> ATV<00:01:26.750> 19<00:01:27.170> because<00:01:27.500> the<00:01:28.190> stability<00:01:28.909> that<00:01:29.060> it

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.150 
the ATV 19 because the stability that it

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:30.610 
the ATV 19 because the stability that it
brings<00:01:29.330> when<00:01:29.600> you're<00:01:29.750> pulling<00:01:30.170> the<00:01:30.260> sled<00:01:30.440> like

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:30.620 
brings when you're pulling the sled like

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:32.620 
brings when you're pulling the sled like
I<00:01:30.740> did<00:01:30.950> today<00:01:31.130> when<00:01:31.880> you<00:01:31.970> flipping<00:01:32.299> the<00:01:32.360> tires

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
I did today when you flipping the tires

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.330 
I did today when you flipping the tires
you<00:01:33.229> got<00:01:33.380> to<00:01:33.470> have<00:01:33.620> some<00:01:33.830> type<00:01:34.010> of<00:01:34.040> stability

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
you got to have some type of stability

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.340 
you got to have some type of stability
in<00:01:34.760> the<00:01:34.850> shoe<00:01:35.060> and<00:01:35.420> a<00:01:35.600> lot<00:01:35.780> of<00:01:35.900> shoes<00:01:36.049> don't

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
in the shoe and a lot of shoes don't

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.770 
in the shoe and a lot of shoes don't
offer<00:01:36.560> that<00:01:36.830> but<00:01:37.100> what<00:01:37.909> about<00:01:38.150> the<00:01:38.360> lightness

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
offer that but what about the lightness

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:40.810 
offer that but what about the lightness
the<00:01:38.990> shoe<00:01:39.470> is<00:01:39.619> just<00:01:39.799> as<00:01:39.950> light<00:01:40.220> as<00:01:40.430> a<00:01:40.490> running

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:40.820 
the shoe is just as light as a running

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:42.280 
the shoe is just as light as a running
shoe<00:01:40.970> you<00:01:41.299> can<00:01:41.390> get<00:01:41.570> out<00:01:41.690> there<00:01:41.869> you<00:01:41.960> can<00:01:42.080> cross

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:42.290 
shoe you can get out there you can cross

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.530 
shoe you can get out there you can cross
train<00:01:42.560> in<00:01:42.770> it<00:01:42.890> and<00:01:43.520> it's<00:01:43.670> rugged<00:01:43.850> so<00:01:44.270> you<00:01:44.330> can

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:44.540 
train in it and it's rugged so you can

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.030 
train in it and it's rugged so you can
take<00:01:44.720> it<00:01:44.840> all<00:01:44.960> off<00:01:45.200> terrain

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:46.040
