00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
thought that was nice and this is a

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.120 
thought that was nice and this is a
burlap<00:01:15.330> and<00:01:15.390> twine<00:01:15.810> bond<00:01:16.320> you're<00:01:16.530> a<00:01:16.560> natural

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130

the<00:01:58.250> kids<00:01:58.520> but<00:01:58.729> I<00:01:58.850> guess<00:01:59.000> they<00:01:59.149> can<00:01:59.299> paint<00:01:59.479> a

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
the kids but I guess they can paint a

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.020 
the kids but I guess they can paint a
box<00:01:59.869> and<00:02:00.259> this<00:02:00.860> is<00:02:00.920> just<00:02:01.340> the<00:02:01.460> Tweety<00:02:01.729> ball

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030
