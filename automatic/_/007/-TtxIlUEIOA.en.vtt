is<00:00:38.309> also<00:00:38.610> easy<00:00:39.000> as<00:00:39.660> you<00:00:39.870> see<00:00:40.020> this<00:00:40.200> one<00:00:40.469> piece

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
is also easy as you see this one piece

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.000 
is also easy as you see this one piece
here<00:00:41.040> is<00:00:41.190> old<00:00:41.460> and<00:00:41.700> broken<00:00:42.260> this<00:00:43.260> piece<00:00:43.739> here

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
here is old and broken this piece here

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.080 
here is old and broken this piece here
should<00:00:44.280> be<00:00:44.430> toast

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
should be toast

should be toast
and<00:00:45.950> this<00:00:46.950> here<00:00:47.309> but<00:00:47.940> I<00:00:48.210> try<00:00:48.750> to<00:00:48.809> make<00:00:49.110> it<00:00:49.260> look

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
and this here but I try to make it look

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.160 
and this here but I try to make it look
like<00:00:51.090> you're<00:00:51.329> opening<00:00:52.020> it<00:00:52.170> first<00:00:53.100> what<00:00:53.340> you<00:00:53.460> do

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.170 
like you're opening it first what you do

like you're opening it first what you do
you'll<00:00:55.170> play<00:00:55.920> it<00:00:55.980> on<00:00:56.670> your<00:00:56.850> hand<00:00:57.059> like<00:00:57.360> that

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 
you'll play it on your hand like that

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:06.170 
you'll play it on your hand like that
then<00:00:59.190> you<00:00:59.910> open<00:01:00.300> this<00:01:00.420> hatch<00:01:00.719> here<00:01:04.970> it<00:01:05.970> should

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
then you open this hatch here it should

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.140 
then you open this hatch here it should
stay<00:01:06.450> right<00:01:06.659> here<00:01:07.049> but<00:01:07.470> it's<00:01:07.950> broken<00:01:08.220> so<00:01:08.460> yeah

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
stay right here but it's broken so yeah

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.590 
stay right here but it's broken so yeah
you<00:01:09.360> can<00:01:09.479> throw<00:01:09.659> that<00:01:09.810> away<00:01:10.159> then<00:01:11.330> this<00:01:12.330> has

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
you can throw that away then this has

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.179 
you can throw that away then this has
remained<00:01:13.140> closed<00:01:14.130> right<00:01:14.729> now<00:01:15.860> this<00:01:16.860> piece<00:01:17.159> is

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
remained closed right now this piece is

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.990 
remained closed right now this piece is
broken<00:01:17.659> here<00:01:18.659> it<00:01:18.869> is<00:01:19.110> rubber<00:01:19.460> that<00:01:20.460> protects

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
broken here it is rubber that protects

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.840 
broken here it is rubber that protects
the<00:01:21.090> inside<00:01:21.770> because<00:01:22.770> it<00:01:23.070> was<00:01:23.220> used<00:01:23.430> there<00:01:23.729> is

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.340 
the inside because it was used there is
no<00:01:24.000> rubber<00:01:24.299> because<00:01:24.479> it<00:01:24.750> was<00:01:24.900> thrown<00:01:25.200> away

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350

to<00:03:14.670> the<00:03:14.790> rocket<00:03:15.120> and<00:03:15.500> fire<00:03:16.500> it<00:03:16.680> and<00:03:17.480> this<00:03:18.480> is

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 
to the rocket and fire it and this is

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:21.350 
to the rocket and fire it and this is
all<00:03:19.260> we<00:03:19.380> need<00:03:19.410> to<00:03:19.560> do<00:03:19.769> when<00:03:20.430> you<00:03:20.580> fire<00:03:20.790> you<00:03:21.180> need

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
all we need to do when you fire you need

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.990 
all we need to do when you fire you need
to<00:03:21.510> dispose<00:03:21.870> of<00:03:21.900> this<00:03:22.200> because<00:03:22.530> it<00:03:23.010> is<00:03:23.190> no<00:03:23.370> it

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
to dispose of this because it is no it

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.120 
to dispose of this because it is no it
is<00:03:24.180> more<00:03:24.480> useful<00:03:24.630> normal<00:03:25.019> you<00:03:25.620> just<00:03:25.830> throw<00:03:26.010> it
