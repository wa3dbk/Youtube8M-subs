like<00:00:10.450> an<00:00:10.629> alternator<00:00:10.959> now<00:00:11.769> this<00:00:11.950> alternator

00:00:12.359 --> 00:00:12.369 
like an alternator now this alternator

00:00:12.369 --> 00:00:14.549 
like an alternator now this alternator
is<00:00:12.639> not<00:00:12.820> fitting<00:00:13.269> that<00:00:13.959> you<00:00:14.019> can<00:00:14.169> see<00:00:14.320> back

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:14.559 
is not fitting that you can see back

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:16.470 
is not fitting that you can see back
there<00:00:14.799> it's<00:00:14.949> hitting<00:00:15.219> the<00:00:15.670> thermostat

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:16.480 
there it's hitting the thermostat

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.710 
there it's hitting the thermostat
housing<00:00:16.630> area<00:00:17.199> that<00:00:17.619> bolt<00:00:17.859> and<00:00:18.270> whoa<00:00:19.270> sorry

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:19.720 
housing area that bolt and whoa sorry

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.019 
housing area that bolt and whoa sorry
about<00:00:19.900> that<00:00:19.930> and<00:00:20.259> we<00:00:21.039> don't<00:00:21.099> have<00:00:21.220> enough<00:00:21.279> room

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:22.029 
about that and we don't have enough room

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:23.519 
about that and we don't have enough room
to<00:00:22.060> move<00:00:22.449> this<00:00:22.539> over<00:00:22.720> so<00:00:22.989> we<00:00:23.079> get<00:00:23.199> to<00:00:23.289> bolt

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:23.529 
to move this over so we get to bolt

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:25.859 
to move this over so we get to bolt
through<00:00:23.710> here<00:00:23.949> so<00:00:24.880> I'll<00:00:25.419> show<00:00:25.630> you<00:00:25.720> how<00:00:25.779> to

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:25.869 
through here so I'll show you how to

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:29.940 
through here so I'll show you how to
clock<00:00:26.169> this<00:00:26.469> and<00:00:26.800> it's<00:00:27.009> an<00:00:27.099> easy<00:00:27.250> fix<00:00:28.950> that's

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:29.950 
clock this and it's an easy fix that's

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:33.690 
clock this and it's an easy fix that's
an<00:00:30.099> age<00:00:30.309> star<00:00:30.610> socket<00:00:31.320> or<00:00:32.320> some<00:00:32.920> people<00:00:33.280> clover

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:33.700 
an age star socket or some people clover

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.389 
an age star socket or some people clover
storks<00:00:34.120> so<00:00:34.899> go<00:00:35.170> ahead<00:00:35.410> here<00:00:35.680> and<00:00:35.739> take<00:00:36.250> these

00:00:36.389 --> 00:00:36.399 
storks so go ahead here and take these

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:42.710 
storks so go ahead here and take these
off

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:42.720 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.150 

all<00:00:43.720> right<00:00:43.840> usually<00:00:44.020> sometimes<00:00:44.710> you<00:00:45.040> don't

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:45.160 
all right usually sometimes you don't

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:46.650 
all right usually sometimes you don't
have<00:00:45.280> this<00:00:45.400> tab<00:00:45.670> here<00:00:46.030> and<00:00:46.150> you<00:00:46.239> could<00:00:46.329> clock

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:46.660 
have this tab here and you could clock

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.650 
have this tab here and you could clock
this<00:00:46.900> over<00:00:47.290> but<00:00:47.739> this<00:00:47.890> isn't<00:00:48.070> away<00:00:48.399> now<00:00:48.640> so<00:00:49.420> we

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:49.660 
this over but this isn't away now so we

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.290 
this over but this isn't away now so we
have<00:00:49.690> to<00:00:49.810> take<00:00:49.989> the<00:00:50.110> whole<00:00:50.230> case<00:00:50.500> off<00:00:51.060> in<00:00:52.060> order

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:52.300 
have to take the whole case off in order

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:53.729 
have to take the whole case off in order
to<00:00:52.360> do<00:00:52.420> that<00:00:52.570> guy<00:00:52.899> took<00:00:52.960> the<00:00:53.079> cap<00:00:53.320> off<00:00:53.500> in<00:00:53.649> the

to do that guy took the cap off in the

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:58.110 
to do that guy took the cap off in the
front<00:00:54.010> take<00:00:54.310> the<00:00:54.399> nut<00:00:54.579> off<00:00:56.910> now<00:00:57.910> we're<00:00:58.059> just
