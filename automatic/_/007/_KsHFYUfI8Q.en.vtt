certain genetic issues and black people

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.840 
certain genetic issues and black people
succumb<00:02:21.540> to<00:02:21.660> other<00:02:21.810> ones<00:02:22.430> well<00:02:23.430> that's<00:02:23.610> fine

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
succumb to other ones well that's fine

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.550

that's just a open dialogue about

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.170 
that's just a open dialogue about
biology<00:02:28.460> but<00:02:29.460> whenever<00:02:29.640> you<00:02:29.820> hear<00:02:29.970> somebody

poverty debate

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:51.680 
poverty debate
she's<00:02:50.700> like<00:02:50.790> well<00:02:50.940> yeah<00:02:51.090> you<00:02:51.150> guys<00:02:51.420> got<00:02:51.600> to

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
she's like well yeah you guys got to

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.120 
she's like well yeah you guys got to
understand<00:02:52.080> there<00:02:52.260> are<00:02:52.290> certain<00:02:52.770> things<00:02:52.800> that

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
understand there are certain things that

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.460 
understand there are certain things that
some<00:02:53.490> races<00:02:53.670> just<00:02:54.210> do<00:02:54.450> so<00:02:54.750> for<00:02:54.930> example<00:02:55.320> those

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
some races just do so for example those

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.860 
some races just do so for example those
black<00:02:55.710> people<00:02:55.920> they<00:02:56.610> get<00:02:56.880> sick<00:02:57.150> in<00:02:57.360> these<00:02:57.600> ways

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
black people they get sick in these ways

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.400 
black people they get sick in these ways
so<00:02:58.680> let's<00:02:58.710> just<00:02:59.160> be<00:02:59.280> clear<00:02:59.460> I<00:02:59.520> mean<00:03:00.050> we<00:03:01.050> can

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
so let's just be clear I mean we can

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.470 
so let's just be clear I mean we can
maybe<00:03:01.740> do<00:03:02.070> something<00:03:02.460> to<00:03:02.550> try<00:03:02.670> to<00:03:02.760> fix<00:03:02.970> poverty

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
maybe do something to try to fix poverty

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:04.640 
maybe do something to try to fix poverty
but<00:03:03.600> at<00:03:03.720> the<00:03:03.810> end<00:03:03.840> of<00:03:04.020> the<00:03:04.080> day<00:03:04.200> does<00:03:04.380> it<00:03:04.500> really

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
but at the end of the day does it really

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.080 
but at the end of the day does it really
matter<00:03:04.860> cuz<00:03:05.190> black<00:03:05.430> people<00:03:05.700> are<00:03:05.760> gonna<00:03:05.910> be

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
matter cuz black people are gonna be

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:07.760 
matter cuz black people are gonna be
poor<00:03:06.360> anyway<00:03:06.750> hello

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.770 
poor anyway hello

distribution you know it reminds me of

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:03.830 
distribution you know it reminds me of
last<00:04:01.170> point<00:04:01.610> when<00:04:02.610> I<00:04:02.640> was<00:04:02.700> in<00:04:02.940> college<00:04:03.150> one<00:04:03.810> of

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
last point when I was in college one of

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:04.880 
last point when I was in college one of
the<00:04:03.960> things<00:04:04.140> they<00:04:04.260> first<00:04:04.470> taught<00:04:04.650> us<00:04:04.770> in

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
the things they first taught us in

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:06.560 
the things they first taught us in
sociology<00:04:05.220> they<00:04:05.640> showed<00:04:05.790> us<00:04:05.910> a<00:04:05.940> graph<00:04:06.210> and

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:06.570 
sociology they showed us a graph and

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:09.410 
sociology they showed us a graph and
showed<00:04:07.020> how<00:04:07.200> murders<00:04:07.890> and<00:04:08.250> ice<00:04:08.610> ice<00:04:09.150> cream

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
showed how murders and ice ice cream

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.850 
showed how murders and ice ice cream
sales<00:04:09.690> rose<00:04:10.200> together<00:04:10.800> right<00:04:11.430> so<00:04:12.390> an<00:04:13.260> idiot

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:13.860 
sales rose together right so an idiot

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:14.900 
sales rose together right so an idiot
would<00:04:14.040> look<00:04:14.220> at<00:04:14.340> that<00:04:14.459> and<00:04:14.610> say<00:04:14.730> well

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
would look at that and say well

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:18.800 
would look at that and say well
obviously<00:04:15.360> the<00:04:16.109> ice<00:04:16.290> cream<00:04:16.650> is<00:04:17.570> leading<00:04:18.570> to<00:04:18.690> an

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
obviously the ice cream is leading to an

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:20.300 
obviously the ice cream is leading to an
increased<00:04:19.140> amount<00:04:19.230> of<00:04:19.470> murders<00:04:19.799> so<00:04:19.950> ice<00:04:20.100> cream

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
increased amount of murders so ice cream

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:22.520 
increased amount of murders so ice cream
is<00:04:20.430> dangerous<00:04:20.790> you<00:04:20.820> gotta<00:04:21.060> ban<00:04:21.270> it<00:04:21.450> right<00:04:21.660> well

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.530 
is dangerous you gotta ban it right well

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:24.650 
is dangerous you gotta ban it right well
that's<00:04:22.680> ridiculous<00:04:23.550> nobody<00:04:24.150> would<00:04:24.330> say<00:04:24.479> that

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
that's ridiculous nobody would say that

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:27.530 
that's ridiculous nobody would say that
that's<00:04:25.100> pathetically<00:04:26.100> dumb<00:04:26.310> right

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 
that's pathetically dumb right

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.570 
that's pathetically dumb right
well<00:04:27.720> this<00:04:27.840> is<00:04:28.020> exactly<00:04:28.710> what<00:04:28.860> she's<00:04:29.070> doing<00:04:29.100> so

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
well this is exactly what she's doing so

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.910 
well this is exactly what she's doing so
she's<00:04:29.970> going<00:04:30.210> well<00:04:30.540> look<00:04:30.720> since<00:04:31.020> there's<00:04:31.230> you

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:31.920 
she's going well look since there's you

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:34.190 
she's going well look since there's you
know<00:04:31.950> statistically<00:04:32.700> speaking<00:04:32.820> there's<00:04:33.270> more

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:34.200 
know statistically speaking there's more

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.080 
know statistically speaking there's more
people<00:04:34.530> that<00:04:34.890> are<00:04:35.040> black<00:04:35.250> that<00:04:35.280> are<00:04:35.580> poor<00:04:35.790> well

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 
people that are black that are poor well

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:37.460 
people that are black that are poor well
obviously<00:04:36.240> that<00:04:36.540> means<00:04:36.690> they're<00:04:37.020> inferior

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470 
obviously that means they're inferior

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:38.540 
obviously that means they're inferior
and<00:04:37.680> that<00:04:37.770> no<00:04:37.890> matter<00:04:38.040> what<00:04:38.220> they<00:04:38.310> do<00:04:38.430> they're

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:38.550 
and that no matter what they do they're

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:42.980 
and that no matter what they do they're
going<00:04:38.670> to<00:04:38.730> be<00:04:38.820> poor<00:04:41.780> causation<00:04:42.780> correlation

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 
going to be poor causation correlation

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:46.100 
going to be poor causation correlation
you<00:04:43.680> fool
