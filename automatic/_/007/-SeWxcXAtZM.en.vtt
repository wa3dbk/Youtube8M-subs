00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:08.069
 what's up with people zero tv with one 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.110
 new video to destiny today we show 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.870
 the sought-after quarry valley nix the 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.340
 gluttonous or phoenix or web berlin 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.809
 No way in any case I do not know 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.660
 do not understand anything we definitely go 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:21.330
 now in the patrol to the moon 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:25.140
 and from there directly in the speed run 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.220
 or speed speedboot is no idea 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.529
 She answered a little faster 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.539
 made hellhole because there will be 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.740
 this event must take place 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.780
 then an opponent could know then 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.070
 but also dig through a box 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.730
 we already at the end where we the men 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.770
 by the way, here 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.480
 cool style the type with the scheme off 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.120
 level 35 arena 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.410
 the change means and here's a little hint 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.170
 you've just seen it for a moment 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:49.680
 the yellow enemy is already there after the 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.840
 third fourth round here and there 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.309
 small tip I almost covered her up 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.719
 to shoot the types you have to 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.489
 at least once afterwards us 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.949
 you get the ethereal key here 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.170
 not quite quite important may look as 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.370
 such 45 people somehow are the ball 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.270
 at the so fast down there you can 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.860
 do not look at all 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.530
 and which is a great pity for her 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.000
 only becks and I have the crate 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.159
 I think the others even knew 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.840
 not that there is a box here at all 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.130
 So maybe if the people are in there 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.830
 go round the patrol on the round 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.060
 he may say again when he can 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.310
 it also turn on the super and the too 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.799
 show what I'm doing there nothing pity 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.270
 but now but blood nine times helium 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.159
 clemente and a bit 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.049
 special ammunition is not up to now 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.119
 which is indeed one patched like to gamble 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.780
 apparently can erase because they are all 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.659
 full of it 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.310
 and here are ten years points there 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.380
 By the way, those will continue 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.540
 because the farm are the cream marsch 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.890
 the wars here are more 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.180
 then I would say well 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.970
 what if it was people 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.320
 if the video was informative last 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.340
 a thumbs up there to us 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.649
 support 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.170
 and if you are not one of our daily ones 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:55.159
