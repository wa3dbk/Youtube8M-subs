00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.680 
he was supposed to pay me back over a
few<00:00:34.649> months<00:00:35.010> but<00:00:35.219> then<00:00:35.399> hasn't<00:00:35.670> paid<00:00:36.030> anything

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690

few months but then hasn't paid anything
and<00:00:36.930> seems<00:00:37.739> to<00:00:37.920> be<00:00:38.040> avoiding<00:00:38.309> me<00:00:38.670> he<00:00:39.660> still

goes out on weekends and I think that if
he<00:00:41.640> can<00:00:41.879> afford<00:00:41.969> that<00:00:42.450> he<00:00:42.750> can<00:00:42.899> afford<00:00:43.020> to<00:00:43.320> pay

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:46.850 
me back should I confront him or just
drop<00:00:46.050> him<00:00:46.260> as<00:00:46.410> a<00:00:46.440> friend

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
get anything so chances are Josh you've

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.370 
get anything so chances are Josh you've
lost<00:03:38.670> your<00:03:38.940> money<00:03:39.090> and<00:03:39.450> you've<00:03:39.720> probably<00:03:39.900> lost

lost your money and you've probably lost

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.370 
lost your money and you've probably lost
a<00:03:40.590> friend<00:03:41.120> which<00:03:42.120> by<00:03:42.420> the<00:03:42.480> way<00:03:42.600> in<00:03:42.840> this<00:03:42.990> case<00:03:43.200> I

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
a friend which by the way in this case I

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:44.949 
a friend which by the way in this case I
don't<00:03:43.440> think<00:03:43.620> is<00:03:43.890> necessarily<00:03:44.430> a<00:03:44.610> bad<00:03:44.850> thing

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 
don't think is necessarily a bad thing

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:47.120 
don't think is necessarily a bad thing
because<00:03:45.959> there<00:03:46.260> is<00:03:46.350> a<00:03:46.380> big<00:03:46.680> difference

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
because there is a big difference

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:49.490 
because there is a big difference
between<00:03:47.340> can't<00:03:47.940> pay<00:03:48.270> back<00:03:48.540> and<00:03:48.900> won't<00:03:49.230> pay

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
just put him on the back burner

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.280 
just put him on the back burner
well<00:04:20.940> that's<00:04:21.150> reflective<00:04:21.780> of<00:04:21.870> a<00:04:22.020> lot<00:04:22.169> of

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:22.290 
well that's reflective of a lot of

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:23.780 
well that's reflective of a lot of
qualities<00:04:22.800> that<00:04:22.979> I<00:04:23.040> think<00:04:23.400> would<00:04:23.550> cause

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:23.790 
qualities that I think would cause

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:26.270 
qualities that I think would cause
trouble<00:04:24.720> in<00:04:24.990> different<00:04:25.350> situations<00:04:25.979> in<00:04:26.130> the

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
trouble in different situations in the

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:26.740 
trouble in different situations in the
future

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:26.750 
future

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:29.290 
future
so<00:04:26.900> I<00:04:26.930> wouldn't<00:04:27.380> want<00:04:27.560> a<00:04:27.620> friend<00:04:27.890> like<00:04:28.100> that<00:04:28.370> so

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:29.300 
so I wouldn't want a friend like that so

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.080 
so I wouldn't want a friend like that so
you<00:04:29.810> know<00:04:29.840> I<00:04:30.260> give<00:04:30.950> it<00:04:31.070> one<00:04:31.250> more<00:04:31.400> try<00:04:31.460> give

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.090 
you know I give it one more try give

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:33.430 
you know I give it one more try give
them<00:04:32.270> a<00:04:32.300> call<00:04:32.510> see<00:04:32.900> if<00:04:32.930> you<00:04:33.080> can<00:04:33.230> work

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 
them a call see if you can work

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.860 
them a call see if you can work
something<00:04:33.920> out<00:04:34.150> but<00:04:35.150> don't<00:04:35.360> be<00:04:35.480> surprised

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:35.870 
something out but don't be surprised

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:37.420 
something out but don't be surprised
that<00:04:36.020> you<00:04:36.170> don't<00:04:36.320> get<00:04:36.470> your<00:04:36.620> money<00:04:36.830> back<00:04:37.100> and

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:37.430 
that you don't get your money back and

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:39.970 
that you don't get your money back and
in<00:04:38.150> that<00:04:38.210> case<00:04:38.570> yes<00:04:38.900> I<00:04:39.080> would<00:04:39.260> probably<00:04:39.470> just

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:39.980 
in that case yes I would probably just

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:42.370 
in that case yes I would probably just
drop<00:04:40.220> them<00:04:40.430> not<00:04:41.390> because<00:04:41.750> you<00:04:41.840> value<00:04:42.050> the

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:42.380 
drop them not because you value the

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:44.140 
drop them not because you value the
money<00:04:42.500> more<00:04:43.010> than<00:04:43.190> your<00:04:43.310> friend<00:04:43.640> but<00:04:44.030> the

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:44.150 
money more than your friend but the

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:46.060 
money more than your friend but the
simple<00:04:44.510> simple<00:04:44.840> fact<00:04:45.230> that<00:04:45.380> he<00:04:45.590> won't<00:04:45.710> make<00:04:45.830> an

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:46.070 
simple simple fact that he won't make an

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:47.860 
simple simple fact that he won't make an
effort<00:04:46.280> to<00:04:46.580> pay<00:04:46.730> you<00:04:46.790> back<00:04:47.060> shows<00:04:47.480> that<00:04:47.720> he's

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:47.870 
effort to pay you back shows that he's

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.980 
effort to pay you back shows that he's
not<00:04:48.020> a<00:04:48.080> friend<00:04:48.440> to<00:04:48.560> begin<00:04:48.860> with<00:04:49.510> so<00:04:50.510> there<00:04:50.900> you
