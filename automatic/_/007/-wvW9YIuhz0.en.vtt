one<00:03:29.640> you<00:03:29.820> need<00:03:30.000> to<00:03:30.180> aim<00:03:30.360> for<00:03:30.390> absolutely<00:03:31.230> yeah

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
one you need to aim for absolutely yeah

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.110 
one you need to aim for absolutely yeah
and<00:03:31.769> is<00:03:31.890> there<00:03:32.040> a<00:03:32.070> danger<00:03:32.310> that<00:03:32.489> people<00:03:32.850> can<00:03:33.000> be

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
and is there a danger that people can be

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.790 
and is there a danger that people can be
unrealistic<00:03:33.600> about<00:03:33.900> what<00:03:34.170> shade<00:03:34.440> they<00:03:34.650> can

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:34.800 
unrealistic about what shade they can

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.800 
unrealistic about what shade they can
expect<00:03:35.160> to<00:03:35.220> actually<00:03:35.610> achieve<00:03:35.970> yeah<00:03:36.540> I<00:03:36.570> think

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
expect to actually achieve yeah I think

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.130 
expect to actually achieve yeah I think
that's<00:03:37.140> a<00:03:37.230> real<00:03:37.380> danger<00:03:37.650> so<00:03:38.550> when<00:03:39.269> somebody's

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
that's a real danger so when somebody's

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.620 
that's a real danger so when somebody's
picking<00:03:40.470> a<00:03:40.560> color<00:03:40.769> never<00:03:41.670> go<00:03:41.970> off<00:03:42.269> the<00:03:42.450> front

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
picking a color never go off the front

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:45.440 
picking a color never go off the front

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
naturally this this on this base this is

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.500 
naturally this this on this base this is
the<00:03:55.800> result<00:03:56.190> that<00:03:56.459> you<00:03:56.910> can<00:03:56.940> expect<00:03:57.120> to
