00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
to go you know just a small error you

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.600 
to go you know just a small error you
can<00:00:07.140> say<00:00:07.319> that<00:00:07.560> the<00:00:07.710> leading<00:00:08.160> edge<00:00:08.309> and<00:00:08.490> had

the<00:00:13.110> approach<00:00:13.380> over<00:00:13.980> those<00:00:14.190> first<00:00:14.460> 20<00:00:14.610> overs

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
the approach over those first 20 overs

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.510 
the approach over those first 20 overs
had<00:00:15.150> been<00:00:15.350> very<00:00:16.350> slow<00:00:16.560> then<00:00:17.279> you<00:00:17.369> get<00:00:17.490> even

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
had been very slow then you get even

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.150 
had been very slow then you get even
bell<00:00:17.940> up<00:00:18.119> at<00:00:18.270> number<00:00:18.359> three<00:00:18.750> who<00:00:19.080> thinks<00:00:20.010> he's

bell up at number three who thinks he's

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.010 
bell up at number three who thinks he's
covered<00:00:20.550> that<00:00:20.730> there's<00:00:21.210> enough<00:00:21.449> spin<00:00:21.779> on<00:00:21.900> the

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
covered that there's enough spin on the

covered that there's enough spin on the
wall<00:00:22.170> to<00:00:22.320> take<00:00:22.500> it<00:00:22.680> back<00:00:22.859> off<00:00:23.070> the<00:00:23.100> bat<00:00:23.400> down

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.450 
wall to take it back off the bat down
onto<00:00:24.570> the<00:00:24.660> turf<00:00:24.900> and<00:00:25.170> there's<00:00:25.289> a<00:00:25.350> gap<00:00:25.560> which<00:00:26.310> it

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
onto the turf and there's a gap which it

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.099 
onto the turf and there's a gap which it
sneaks<00:00:26.789> through<00:00:27.000> with<00:00:27.240> enough<00:00:27.449> pace<00:00:27.689> just<00:00:27.960> to

sneaks through with enough pace just to
dislodge<00:00:28.529> the<00:00:28.769> bails<00:00:28.980> and<00:00:29.160> yep<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:30.119> gods<00:00:30.330> were

course all sorts things you can say

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.170 
course all sorts things you can say
about<00:00:39.770> the<00:00:40.770> way<00:00:40.890> people<00:00:41.219> are<00:00:41.250> being<00:00:41.399> given<00:00:41.460> lbw

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
about the way people are being given lbw

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.270 
about the way people are being given lbw
but<00:00:42.390> you<00:00:42.660> look<00:00:42.809> at<00:00:42.899> it<00:00:42.989> again<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.829> bat<00:00:44.010> comes

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
but you look at it again the bat comes

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.389 
but you look at it again the bat comes
down<00:00:44.520> at<00:00:44.700> a<00:00:44.820> strange<00:00:45.270> angle<00:00:45.739> the<00:00:46.739> umpires<00:00:47.100> Paul

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
down at a strange angle the umpires Paul

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.819 
down at a strange angle the umpires Paul
is<00:00:47.670> justified<00:00:48.390> there<00:00:48.690> maybe<00:00:48.989> only<00:00:49.320> just<00:00:49.620> but

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
is justified there maybe only just but

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.180 
is justified there maybe only just but
it's<00:00:50.840> it's<00:00:51.840> out<00:00:52.050> in<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:52.289> book<00:00:52.469> and<00:00:52.649> so<00:00:52.890> is<00:00:53.039> this

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
it's it's out in the book and so is this

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.000 
it's it's out in the book and so is this
more<00:00:53.550> than<00:00:53.760> completely<00:00:54.449> beaten<00:00:54.930> by<00:00:55.110> good<00:00:55.980> a

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
more than completely beaten by good a

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.920 
more than completely beaten by good a
turn<00:00:56.250> here<00:00:56.550> from<00:00:56.820> outside<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.390> off<00:00:57.480> stump<00:00:57.780> bit

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
turn here from outside the off stump bit

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.049 
turn here from outside the off stump bit
of<00:00:58.020> dust<00:00:58.320> as<00:00:58.500> it<00:00:58.530> pitched<00:00:58.890> but<00:00:59.160> again<00:00:59.399> the<00:00:59.879> bat

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
of dust as it pitched but again the bat

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.200 
of dust as it pitched but again the bat
is<00:01:00.270> in<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.510> strange<00:01:00.960> position<00:01:01.850> after<00:01:02.850> that

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
is in the strange position after that

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.390 
is in the strange position after that
things<00:01:03.539> were<00:01:03.719> never<00:01:04.650> going<00:01:04.769> to<00:01:04.890> get<00:01:05.010> better<00:01:05.189> it

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
things were never going to get better it

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.280 
things were never going to get better it
seems<00:01:05.640> strauss<00:01:06.030> has<00:01:06.270> hung<00:01:06.479> in<00:01:06.510> dogged<00:01:06.990> ly<00:01:07.110> but

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
seems strauss has hung in dogged ly but

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.810 
seems strauss has hung in dogged ly but
again<00:01:07.710> you<00:01:07.830> see<00:01:07.979> a<00:01:08.010> bit<00:01:08.130> of<00:01:08.159> turn<00:01:08.400> and<00:01:08.610> bounce

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
again you see a bit of turn and bounce

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.090 
again you see a bit of turn and bounce
what's<00:01:09.450> there<00:01:09.659> enough<00:01:09.810> bounce<00:01:10.020> was<00:01:10.890> the

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
what's there enough bounce was the

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.880 
what's there enough bounce was the
impact<00:01:11.430> close<00:01:11.760> enough<00:01:12.090> well<00:01:12.900> good<00:01:13.380> enough<00:01:13.409> as

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
impact close enough well good enough as

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.830 
impact close enough well good enough as
the<00:01:14.100> hook<00:01:14.310> I<00:01:14.460> tells<00:01:14.760> you<00:01:14.970> try<00:01:15.240> to<00:01:15.299> be<00:01:15.479> numb<00:01:15.630> well

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
the hook I tells you try to be numb well

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.200 
the hook I tells you try to be numb well
I<00:01:16.159> hadn't<00:01:17.159> taken<00:01:17.310> field<00:01:17.640> at<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:17.790> start<00:01:18.030> of<00:01:18.150> the

I hadn't taken field at the start of the
day<00:01:18.390> I<00:01:18.750> haven't<00:01:19.380> really<00:01:19.560> done<00:01:19.740> much<00:01:19.770> with<00:01:19.950> the

bat again there's just enough here he's
beaten<00:01:22.710> fire<00:01:23.490> a<00:01:23.520> little<00:01:23.729> bit<00:01:23.820> of<00:01:23.970> turn<00:01:24.259> by<00:01:25.259> the
