00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:19.970
 brand new information about the exclusive 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.529
 Contents for the ps4 xbox and pc version 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:23.630
 expand from the dave 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:25.939
 exclusive means here in the case that 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.689
 these contents only for the new dj fresh 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:28.910
 apply 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:31.099
 on ps3 and xbox 360 you get the 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.840
 not grow genc justified with the 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:34.880
 weaker hardware performance of the old 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.440
 also exclusive because many of the 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.600
 new interior only for the newcomers 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.340
 So apply to all zocker dj five 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.660
 already on the old consoles 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.580
 have gambled and now on the new 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.050
 version change boxer to newswire 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:47.030
 meant that everyone content to one 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.500
 certain activity is coupled where you are 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.960
 So we can get the content 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.420
 the redesigned world of 35 from 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.700
 A boxer says new and exciting way 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.800
 getting to know an exclusive content is 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.420
 for example the new duo seaplane 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.610
 he certainly knows some of you 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.740
 still the extras was there was the 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:05.720
 skimmer so the seaplane version 

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:07.460
 from the dojo on the first screenshot nice 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.380
 kept in the replay oldschool colors 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.210
 or the first screen is still the 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.590
 is a bit of a firepower needs 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.910
 to get that plane in your finger 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.980
 as I said, the new content 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:17.480
 are to certain events and those with it 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:19.640
 linked challenge 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:21.140
 maybe he is in front of the yacht and 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.000
 you have to clown him while you 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.470
 gangster excreted from the yacht eg 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.760
 the eighth so brings the dignity there 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.920
 you have to deal with michael story-mode 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:30.110
 his daughter tracy save meets the 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.760
 porn actor blake in the altensteiger 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.680
 the yacht as I said only in story mode 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.210
 because of the larger hardware 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.830
 power of the nextgen I could also me 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.270
 Well imagine that we have the yacht too 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.159
 can explore in free mode 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.420
 hopefully my conclusion to the dom 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:44.030
 finally a clever one 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.440
 hydroplane etf on the second 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.690
 screenshots you can see the new import 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.100
 grew up in houston on the dodge charger 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.170
 based on the seventies you know her 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.610
 Still looks like before and now there is 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.800
 him finally back in part 5 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.120
 however in the us version 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.190
 rockstar has quite clearly too much 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:59.840
 death race or mad max looked because 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.970
 The chamber is armored from top to bottom 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.470
 is full with a finger like that of 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.790
 some police cars and armored cars 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:06.710
 side windows like those of the police 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.209
 choose a juicy sucks 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.259
 judge and headlights like those of 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:10.670
 traveler bonuses 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:12.080
 the tires are guaranteed also ball 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.740
 sure he stands somewhere in the 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.750
 lost territory and is heavily guarded 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.160
 new story content is included 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.720
 can in the new version namely a 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.430
 solve the murder case with Michael 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.500
 certain references follows on the 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.120
 walkway advertising poster is to the 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.500
 film producer simon richards to see 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.330
 you will surely get that from him 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.130
 If you solve the murder case there 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.870
 Do you get doubt only filter so 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:33.270

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.480
 The two new weapons are still exclusive 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.640
 once the hatchet and then the 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.350
 new railgun radiate the high energy 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.720
 Some have already decided 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:44.130
 that's why the zdf always gets excited about it 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.110
 more in the direction of nonsense of all 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.000
 Saints row slips but I think the 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.590
 railgun alien and always blurs 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.050

 The new octopus only looks good in the end 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.850
 compared to the old level pretty much 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:11.340
 futuristic has something of the spaceship 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:12.930

00:04:27.719 --> 00:04:30.599
 Questions received from users 

00:04:29.069 --> 00:04:32.099
 For example , someone had asked if you had the 

00:04:30.599 --> 00:04:33.180
 Contents of the collector's and special 

00:04:32.099 --> 00:04:35.009
 edition so for example the at 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.810

 for all who are not the special now 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:48.810
 edition or the collector's edition 

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:50.250
 have another question if you ask the 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:52.110
 character and its progress 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:54.060
 Only once can carry over and whether you 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:56.159
 after that still on the ps3 and 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:57.180
 You can still play xbox 360 

00:04:56.159 --> 00:04:58.680
 the character can only be used once 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.569
 be transferred and you can afterwards 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.159
 but still with him on the old 

00:05:00.569 --> 00:05:03.539
 just gambling on consoles will be yours 

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:04.740
 progress then stop with the 

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:06.569
 new version synchronized 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:08.129
 of course, pc players also get the 

00:05:06.569 --> 00:05:10.110
 new exclusive content like the dodo 

00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:11.460
 or the clubs the new content for 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:13.529
 existing players so except for the 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:15.210
 monkey costumes will not be for the old ones 

00:05:13.529 --> 00:05:17.279
 consoles appear but updates will be 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:18.960
 still for all gdf version 

00:05:17.279 --> 00:05:20.729
 Giving jobs created by you 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:22.889
 transferred to the new consoles 

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:24.689
 but no ranking snap magic photos 

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:26.639
 play list and also no marked 

00:05:24.689 --> 00:05:28.289
 by the way, jobs like 30 players are valid 

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:29.969
 not only for free mode but 

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:31.319
 of course also for death matches and 

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:33.000
 Overall, I think the race is right 

00:05:31.319 --> 00:05:34.529
 great that rockstar games so many 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.879
 Exclusive innovations for the existing ones 

00:05:34.529 --> 00:05:37.529
 player has installed because it otherwise 

00:05:35.879 --> 00:05:39.000
 but a bit boring 

00:05:37.529 --> 00:05:41.009
 would be for the people like me 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.449
 For example, the three almost in and out 

00:05:41.009 --> 00:05:44.279
 I am most pleased to know 

00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:46.770
 By the way, on the murder case with Michael in 

00:05:44.279 --> 00:05:48.210
 Alsace style the dukes and the new 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:49.259
 monster truck of course thats 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:51.330
 At least the stuff I first 

00:05:49.259 --> 00:05:52.589
 try is with the rail farmer 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:53.219
 but also pretty funny in there 

00:05:52.589 --> 00:05:54.659
 of the match 

00:05:53.219 --> 00:05:56.009
