I'll<00:00:28.500> put<00:00:28.650> it<00:00:28.740> in<00:00:28.770> the<00:00:28.920> glass<00:00:29.840> and<00:00:30.840> add<00:00:31.020> about<00:00:31.199> a

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
I'll put it in the glass and add about a

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.119 
I'll put it in the glass and add about a
tablespoon<00:00:31.590> or<00:00:32.279> so<00:00:32.309> of<00:00:32.489> water<00:00:33.860> you<00:00:34.860> can<00:00:34.980> add<00:00:35.100> a

00:00:35.119 --> 00:00:35.129 
tablespoon or so of water you can add a

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:36.260 
tablespoon or so of water you can add a
little<00:00:35.250> more<00:00:35.340> water<00:00:35.640> will<00:00:35.820> make<00:00:35.910> the<00:00:35.970> eggs<00:00:36.180> a

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
little more water will make the eggs a

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.560 
little more water will make the eggs a
little<00:00:36.330> bit<00:00:36.449> softer<00:00:37.050> or<00:00:37.199> it<00:00:37.350> can<00:00:37.500> a<00:00:38.570> little

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
little bit softer or it can a little

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.030 
little bit softer or it can a little
less<00:00:39.720> water<00:00:39.960> to<00:00:40.110> make<00:00:40.260> it<00:00:40.379> firmer<00:00:40.620> something

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
less water to make it firmer something

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.469 
less water to make it firmer something
like<00:00:41.190> that<00:00:41.809> and<00:00:42.809> we<00:00:43.400> mix<00:00:44.400> up<00:00:44.550> with<00:00:44.670> a<00:00:44.699> spatula
