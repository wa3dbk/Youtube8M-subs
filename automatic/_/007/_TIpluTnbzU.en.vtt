of goalies in the NHL 16 beta I did not

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:07.400 
of goalies in the NHL 16 beta I did not
really<00:00:06.210> get<00:00:06.299> much<00:00:06.450> of<00:00:06.509> a<00:00:06.660> chance<00:00:06.690> to<00:00:07.080> play<00:00:07.230> as<00:00:07.379> a

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
really get much of a chance to play as a

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:08.900 
really get much of a chance to play as a
skater<00:00:07.830> and<00:00:08.069> what<00:00:08.220> i<00:00:08.250> did<00:00:08.460> i<00:00:08.490> was<00:00:08.639> pretty

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.330 
skater and what i did i was pretty
sub-par<00:00:09.179> so<00:00:09.900> this<00:00:10.050> review<00:00:10.530> of<00:00:10.740> the<00:00:10.920> beta<00:00:11.099> won't

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
sub-par so this review of the beta won't

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.339 
sub-par so this review of the beta won't
be<00:00:11.429> focused<00:00:11.849> on<00:00:11.910> goaltending<00:00:12.540> and<00:00:12.660> aspects<00:00:13.259> of

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
be focused on goaltending and aspects of

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.939 
be focused on goaltending and aspects of
the<00:00:13.469> game<00:00:13.500> that<00:00:13.889> directly<00:00:14.250> affect<00:00:14.639> goalies<00:00:15.059> I

00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:15.949 
the game that directly affect goalies I

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:18.769 
the game that directly affect goalies I
want<00:00:16.949> to<00:00:17.010> start<00:00:17.220> off<00:00:17.310> on<00:00:17.490> a<00:00:17.520> positive<00:00:17.760> note<00:00:18.150> the

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
want to start off on a positive note the

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.210 
want to start off on a positive note the
new<00:00:18.900> goalie<00:00:19.199> animations<00:00:19.710> are<00:00:19.859> huge

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
new goalie animations are huge

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.310 
new goalie animations are huge
improvement<00:00:20.760> compared<00:00:21.150> to<00:00:21.270> past<00:00:21.449> years<00:00:21.900> the

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
improvement compared to past years the

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.230 
improvement compared to past years the
movements<00:00:22.710> are<00:00:22.800> very<00:00:23.100> realistic<00:00:23.760> in<00:00:23.910> da<00:00:24.029> has

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
movements are very realistic in da has

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.089 
movements are very realistic in da has
given<00:00:24.539> us<00:00:24.630> more<00:00:24.930> than<00:00:24.990> enough<00:00:25.170> tools<00:00:25.560> to<00:00:25.980> make

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
given us more than enough tools to make

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.400 
given us more than enough tools to make
all<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.490> saves<00:00:26.699> we<00:00:26.849> can<00:00:27.029> imagine<00:00:27.300> thank<00:00:28.260> you

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
all the saves we can imagine thank you

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:29.929 
all the saves we can imagine thank you
for<00:00:28.619> giving<00:00:28.710> us<00:00:28.920> control<00:00:29.369> over<00:00:29.640> all<00:00:29.789> the

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
for giving us control over all the

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.880 
for giving us control over all the
desperation<00:00:30.420> saves<00:00:30.840> especially<00:00:31.410> those<00:00:31.590> dives

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
desperation saves especially those dives

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.889 
desperation saves especially those dives
I<00:00:32.189> think<00:00:32.759> they'll<00:00:32.880> actually<00:00:33.090> be<00:00:33.300> used<00:00:33.570> more

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
I think they'll actually be used more

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.299 
I think they'll actually be used more
this<00:00:34.170> year<00:00:34.200> ago<00:00:34.590> Lee's<00:00:34.739> just<00:00:34.860> need<00:00:35.040> to<00:00:35.160> learn

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
this year ago Lee's just need to learn

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.819 
this year ago Lee's just need to learn
when<00:00:35.550> to<00:00:35.610> use<00:00:35.910> them<00:00:36.180> I<00:00:36.360> hold<00:00:37.110> my<00:00:37.320> controller<00:00:37.680> in

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
when to use them I hold my controller in

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.350 
when to use them I hold my controller in
such<00:00:37.980> a<00:00:38.010> way<00:00:38.190> my<00:00:38.370> thumb's<00:00:38.640> hovering<00:00:39.120> over

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
such a way my thumb's hovering over

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.930 
such a way my thumb's hovering over
square<00:00:39.750> on<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:39.989> ps4<00:00:40.320> controller<00:00:40.950> which<00:00:41.670> puts

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
square on the ps4 controller which puts

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.670 
square on the ps4 controller which puts
it<00:00:42.030> right<00:00:42.270> next<00:00:42.629> to<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.780> right<00:00:42.960> stick<00:00:43.260> I<00:00:43.410> find

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
it right next to the right stick I find

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.290 
it right next to the right stick I find
this<00:00:43.800> very<00:00:44.040> comfortable<00:00:44.670> I<00:00:44.879> can<00:00:45.149> do<00:00:45.270> a

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
this very comfortable I can do a

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.310 
this very comfortable I can do a
butterfly<00:00:45.899> slide<00:00:46.230> or<00:00:46.530> a<00:00:46.590> dive<00:00:47.010> if<00:00:47.340> I<00:00:47.789> need<00:00:47.969> to

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:48.320 
butterfly slide or a dive if I need to

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.319 
butterfly slide or a dive if I need to
however<00:00:49.320> my<00:00:49.829> first<00:00:50.100> criticism<00:00:50.760> of<00:00:50.910> this<00:00:51.090> beta

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
however my first criticism of this beta

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.020 
however my first criticism of this beta
was<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:51.780> input<00:00:52.230> lag<00:00:52.440> or<00:00:52.680> delay<00:00:52.980> or<00:00:53.219> just<00:00:53.760> lag

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
was the input lag or delay or just lag

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.420 
was the input lag or delay or just lag
in<00:00:54.239> general<00:00:54.690> input<00:00:55.410> lag<00:00:55.590> suggests<00:00:56.129> it's<00:00:56.280> on

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
in general input lag suggests it's on

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.459 
in general input lag suggests it's on
our<00:00:56.640> end<00:00:56.850> and<00:00:57.030> can<00:00:57.149> be<00:00:57.239> fixed<00:00:57.570> with<00:00:57.629> our<00:00:57.930> TV

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
our end and can be fixed with our TV

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.229 
our end and can be fixed with our TV
settings<00:00:58.770> but<00:00:59.070> this<00:00:59.219> was<00:00:59.370> just<00:00:59.579> normal<00:00:59.760> delay

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
settings but this was just normal delay

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.990 
settings but this was just normal delay
with<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:00.899> EA<00:01:01.199> servers<00:01:01.590> it<00:01:02.190> makes<00:01:02.489> play<00:01:02.699> goalie

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
with the EA servers it makes play goalie

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.060 
with the EA servers it makes play goalie
extremely<00:01:03.750> difficult<00:01:03.989> and<00:01:04.409> render<00:01:04.830> some<00:01:05.040> of

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
extremely difficult and render some of

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.580 
extremely difficult and render some of
those<00:01:05.220> new<00:01:05.489> tools<00:01:05.760> that<00:01:06.060> gave<00:01:06.180> us<00:01:06.360> useless<00:01:06.750> the

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
those new tools that gave us useless the

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.859 
those new tools that gave us useless the
game<00:01:07.799> changers<00:01:08.250> probably<00:01:09.060> played<00:01:09.360> this<00:01:09.600> game

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
game changers probably played this game

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.230 
game changers probably played this game
on<00:01:10.080> a<00:01:10.110> local<00:01:10.560> server<00:01:10.830> so<00:01:11.340> in<00:01:11.460> all<00:01:11.610> fairness<00:01:11.850> to

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
on a local server so in all fairness to

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.940 
on a local server so in all fairness to
them<00:01:12.360> they<00:01:12.570> want<00:01:12.689> to<00:01:12.869> experience<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.619> delay

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
them they want to experience the delay

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.249 
them they want to experience the delay
the<00:01:14.610> only<00:01:14.790> is<00:01:14.880> a<00:01:14.909> reactionary<00:01:15.479> position<00:01:16.080> but

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
the only is a reactionary position but

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.080 
the only is a reactionary position but
we<00:01:16.380> can't<00:01:16.619> do<00:01:16.860> that<00:01:16.890> right<00:01:17.220> now<00:01:17.280> because<00:01:17.729> even

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
we can't do that right now because even

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.490 
we can't do that right now because even
if<00:01:18.180> we<00:01:18.299> react<00:01:18.570> on<00:01:18.750> time<00:01:18.930> with<00:01:19.080> their<00:01:19.229> thumbs

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
if we react on time with their thumbs

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.560 
if we react on time with their thumbs
there's<00:01:20.100> a<00:01:20.189> noticeable<00:01:20.430> delay<00:01:20.880> on<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.210> screen

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
there's a noticeable delay on the screen

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.960 
there's a noticeable delay on the screen
so<00:01:22.170> because<00:01:22.619> of<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:23.040> delay<00:01:23.220> saving

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
so because of the delay saving

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.330 
so because of the delay saving
breakaways<00:01:24.509> has<00:01:24.750> become<00:01:25.110> very<00:01:25.530> difficult<00:01:25.770> a

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
breakaways has become very difficult a

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.490 
breakaways has become very difficult a
well-timed<00:01:27.030> manual<00:01:27.509> Oh<00:01:27.689> check<00:01:27.960> has<00:01:28.170> been<00:01:28.350> the

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
well-timed manual Oh check has been the

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.859 
well-timed manual Oh check has been the
easy<00:01:28.740> solution<00:01:29.040> for<00:01:29.549> many<00:01:29.759> but<00:01:30.329> it's<00:01:30.509> skaters

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
easy solution for many but it's skaters

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.120 
easy solution for many but it's skaters
figure<00:01:31.170> that<00:01:31.350> out<00:01:31.380> they<00:01:31.680> just<00:01:31.710> skate<00:01:32.100> around

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
figure that out they just skate around

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.160 
figure that out they just skate around
us<00:01:32.640> I'm<00:01:33.000> not<00:01:33.150> sure<00:01:33.329> if<00:01:33.450> goalie<00:01:33.630> movement<00:01:34.020> going

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
us I'm not sure if goalie movement going

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.080 
us I'm not sure if goalie movement going

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
can almost guarantee that a pass won't

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.310 
can almost guarantee that a pass won't
get<00:03:03.490> through<00:03:03.670> and<00:03:03.970> focus<00:03:04.720> on<00:03:04.870> the<00:03:04.990> shooter<00:03:05.290> a

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:05.320 
get through and focus on the shooter a

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.100 
get through and focus on the shooter a
little<00:03:05.650> more<00:03:05.800> this<00:03:06.790> is<00:03:06.970> forcing<00:03:07.600> teams<00:03:07.870> to

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.110 
little more this is forcing teams to

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:09.900 
little more this is forcing teams to
take<00:03:08.290> more<00:03:08.650> shots<00:03:08.920> which<00:03:09.520> means<00:03:09.760> we're

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
take more shots which means we're

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:11.820 
take more shots which means we're
getting<00:03:10.030> closer<00:03:10.480> and<00:03:10.660> closer<00:03:10.990> to<00:03:11.200> real<00:03:11.530> hockey

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:11.830 
getting closer and closer to real hockey

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:14.160 
getting closer and closer to real hockey
finally<00:03:12.400> this<00:03:12.970> year<00:03:13.300> a<00:03:13.420> shot<00:03:13.660> on<00:03:13.810> net<00:03:13.930> has<00:03:14.140> a

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
finally this year a shot on net has a

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:15.900 
finally this year a shot on net has a
better<00:03:14.440> chance<00:03:14.560> of<00:03:14.980> creating<00:03:15.250> a<00:03:15.490> scoring

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
better chance of creating a scoring

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:17.670 
better chance of creating a scoring
opportunity<00:03:16.000> than<00:03:16.750> holding<00:03:17.140> on<00:03:17.290> to<00:03:17.410> the<00:03:17.500> puck

that's<00:04:14.860> just<00:04:15.310> my<00:04:15.550> opinion<00:04:15.580> in<00:04:16.180> my<00:04:16.630> eyes<00:04:16.840> it

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:17.080 
that's just my opinion in my eyes it

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:18.599 
that's just my opinion in my eyes it

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:22.550 
now just a couple of miscellaneous

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:24.790 
now just a couple of miscellaneous
points<00:04:23.210> I<00:04:23.389> like<00:04:24.050> that<00:04:24.199> the<00:04:24.289> shots<00:04:24.560> have<00:04:24.770> been

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800 
points I like that the shots have been

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.469 
points I like that the shots have been
nerfed<00:04:25.100> on<00:04:25.340> the<00:04:25.460> different<00:04:25.789> player<00:04:25.970> classes

00:04:26.469 --> 00:04:26.479 
nerfed on the different player classes

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:28.180 
nerfed on the different player classes
this<00:04:26.600> year<00:04:26.660> it's<00:04:26.990> helped<00:04:27.259> totally<00:04:27.680> stop<00:04:27.979> all

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:28.190 
this year it's helped totally stop all

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:29.620 
this year it's helped totally stop all
those<00:04:28.340> cheese<00:04:28.699> shots<00:04:29.000> if<00:04:29.210> we're<00:04:29.360> in<00:04:29.419> the<00:04:29.509> right

everything clearly from that high up and
on<00:05:09.620> such<00:05:09.860> a<00:05:09.889> small<00:05:10.099> TV<00:05:10.669> especially<00:05:11.630> compared

00:05:12.129 --> 00:05:12.139 
on such a small TV especially compared

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:14.469 
on such a small TV especially compared
to<00:05:12.229> last<00:05:12.349> year<00:05:12.620> on<00:05:12.740> my<00:05:12.830> bigger<00:05:13.039> TV<00:05:13.430> I<00:05:13.849> ended<00:05:14.419> up

to last year on my bigger TV I ended up
using<00:05:14.630> dynamic<00:05:14.990> high<00:05:15.440> and<00:05:15.770> I<00:05:15.860> really<00:05:16.099> enjoyed

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:16.430 
using dynamic high and I really enjoyed

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:18.700 
using dynamic high and I really enjoyed
using<00:05:16.699> that<00:05:16.940> view<00:05:17.270> as<00:05:17.509> a<00:05:17.539> goalie<00:05:17.810> when<00:05:18.620> you

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:18.710 
using that view as a goalie when you

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:20.680 
using that view as a goalie when you
walk<00:05:18.889> under<00:05:19.130> your<00:05:19.220> goalie<00:05:19.490> you<00:05:19.970> can't<00:05:20.240> see<00:05:20.509> the

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:20.690 
walk under your goalie you can't see the

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:23.589 
walk under your goalie you can't see the
puck<00:05:20.870> in<00:05:21.020> the<00:05:21.110> corner<00:05:21.699> but<00:05:22.699> it's<00:05:23.030> just<00:05:23.389> about

00:05:23.589 --> 00:05:23.599 
puck in the corner but it's just about

00:05:23.599 --> 00:05:25.750 
puck in the corner but it's just about
as<00:05:23.780> close<00:05:24.110> as<00:05:24.380> a<00:05:24.410> custom<00:05:24.919> three<00:05:25.220> camera<00:05:25.580> view

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:25.760 
as close as a custom three camera view

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:27.279 
as close as a custom three camera view
for<00:05:25.970> a<00:05:26.030> goalie<00:05:26.270> that<00:05:26.479> I've<00:05:26.599> seen<00:05:26.840> I<00:05:26.900> really

00:05:27.279 --> 00:05:27.289 
for a goalie that I've seen I really

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:29.589 
for a goalie that I've seen I really
liked<00:05:27.470> it<00:05:27.650> overall<00:05:28.400> goalies<00:05:29.060> have<00:05:29.210> gotten<00:05:29.510> the

00:06:03.339 --> 00:06:03.349 
better I looked in that because they

00:06:03.349 --> 00:06:04.839 
better I looked in that because they
stopped<00:06:03.620> the<00:06:03.650> high<00:06:03.949> percentage<00:06:04.400> place<00:06:04.669> from

00:06:04.839 --> 00:06:04.849 
stopped the high percentage place from

00:06:04.849 --> 00:06:07.089 
stopped the high percentage place from
happening<00:06:05.419> if<00:06:05.750> they<00:06:05.990> want<00:06:06.259> goal<00:06:06.500> is<00:06:06.620> to<00:06:06.800> truly

00:06:07.089 --> 00:06:07.099 
happening if they want goal is to truly

00:06:07.099 --> 00:06:08.920 
happening if they want goal is to truly
make<00:06:07.430> a<00:06:07.490> difference<00:06:07.610> like<00:06:08.330> they<00:06:08.479> do<00:06:08.539> in<00:06:08.690> real
