out<00:01:25.530> a<00:01:25.560> little<00:01:25.710> tag<00:01:25.979> on<00:01:26.009> it<00:01:26.220> and<00:01:27.140> actually

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
out a little tag on it and actually

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.730 
out a little tag on it and actually
inside<00:01:28.710> of<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.950> package<00:01:29.310> it<00:01:29.610> tell<00:01:30.329> you<00:01:30.630> to

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
inside of the package it tell you to

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.350 
inside of the package it tell you to
basically<00:01:31.740> co<00:01:32.100> wash<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:32.579> hair<00:01:32.729> which<00:01:33.329> is

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.270 
basically co wash the hair which is
pretty<00:01:33.659> good<00:01:33.930> so<00:01:34.320> I'm<00:01:34.439> assuming<00:01:34.710> that<00:01:34.979> once

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
pretty good so I'm assuming that once

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.730 
pretty good so I'm assuming that once
you<00:01:35.369> co<00:01:35.579> wash<00:01:35.820> it<00:01:36.030> it's<00:01:36.540> probably<00:01:37.409> gonna<00:01:37.500> have

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
you co wash it it's probably gonna have

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.380 
you co wash it it's probably gonna have
a<00:01:37.770> little<00:01:38.040> bit<00:01:38.159> more<00:01:38.369> life<00:01:38.610> to<00:01:38.640> it<00:01:38.850> I<00:01:39.180> mean

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
a little bit more life to it I mean

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:40.670 
a little bit more life to it I mean
there's<00:01:39.630> nothing<00:01:39.900> wrong<00:01:40.020> with<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.290> hair<00:01:40.439> now

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
there's nothing wrong with the hair now

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.160 
there's nothing wrong with the hair now
but<00:01:41.070> usually<00:01:41.400> when<00:01:41.549> I<00:01:41.579> co<00:01:41.850> wash<00:01:42.060> my<00:01:42.270> hair<00:01:42.540> it

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
but usually when I co wash my hair it

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.520 
but usually when I co wash my hair it
actually<00:01:43.950> comes<00:01:44.310> out<00:01:44.520> a<00:01:44.549> lot<00:01:45.000> better<00:01:45.180> so<00:01:46.140> I

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
actually comes out a lot better so I

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.450
