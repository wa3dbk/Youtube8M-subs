00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
first image here we see that power-ups

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.670 
first image here we see that power-ups
and<00:00:35.370> equipment<00:00:35.850> are<00:00:35.910> Matt<00:00:36.570> to<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.079> bumpers

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.440 
and equipment are Matt to the bumpers
initially<00:00:38.430> it<00:00:38.520> was<00:00:38.579> assumed<00:00:38.879> that<00:00:38.940> was<00:00:39.149> method

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
initially it was assumed that was method

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.420 
initially it was assumed that was method
a<00:00:39.510> d-pad<00:00:39.870> considering<00:00:40.500> there<00:00:40.620> was<00:00:40.829> really<00:00:41.160> no

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
a d-pad considering there was really no

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
HUD during the multiplayer gameplay

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.959 
HUD during the multiplayer gameplay
reveal<00:00:43.590> so<00:00:44.040> now<00:00:44.160> we<00:00:44.219> also<00:00:44.430> know<00:00:44.670> that<00:00:44.700> it's

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
reveal so now we also know that it's

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.299 
reveal so now we also know that it's
matt<00:00:45.090> to<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.390> triangle<00:00:45.960> button<00:00:46.170> now<00:00:46.800> an<00:00:47.010> image

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
matt to the triangle button now an image

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.250 
matt to the triangle button now an image
to<00:00:47.550> we<00:00:47.700> get<00:00:47.820> a<00:00:47.850> look<00:00:48.120> at<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.450> jetpacks<00:00:49.020> and<00:00:49.140> we

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
to we get a look at the jetpacks and we

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.750 
to we get a look at the jetpacks and we
learn<00:00:49.469> that<00:00:49.680> this<00:00:49.770> is<00:00:49.950> matt<00:00:50.100> to<00:00:50.250> our<00:00:50.399> one<00:00:50.610> but

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
learn that this is matt to our one but

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.250 
learn that this is matt to our one but
more<00:00:50.940> importantly<00:00:51.360> what<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.750> icon<00:00:52.230> for

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
more importantly what the icon for

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.229 
more importantly what the icon for
jetpacks<00:00:52.890> is<00:00:53.190> this<00:00:53.640> will<00:00:53.850> help<00:00:53.910> further

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
jetpacks is this will help further

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.850 
jetpacks is this will help further
analysis<00:00:54.840> like<00:00:54.989> i<00:00:55.110> said<00:00:55.320> some<00:00:55.530> of<00:00:55.620> these<00:00:55.680> are

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
analysis like i said some of these are

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.170 
analysis like i said some of these are
small<00:00:56.070> but<00:00:56.219> some<00:00:56.399> of<00:00:56.460> these<00:00:56.520> are<00:00:56.730> pretty<00:00:57.000> big

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
small but some of these are pretty big

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.170 
small but some of these are pretty big
and<00:00:57.239> detailed<00:00:57.780> now<00:00:58.320> here<00:00:58.710> we<00:00:58.890> see<00:00:59.129> triangle<00:01:00.059> is

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
and detailed now here we see triangle is

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.670 
and detailed now here we see triangle is
mapped<00:01:00.359> to<00:01:00.359> this<00:01:00.660> mobile<00:01:01.170> force<00:01:01.440> field

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
mapped to this mobile force field

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.260 
mapped to this mobile force field
something<00:01:02.070> that's<00:01:02.219> new<00:01:02.520> to<00:01:02.670> battlefront<00:01:03.180> that

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
something that's new to battlefront that

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.670 
something that's new to battlefront that
we've<00:01:03.390> actually<00:01:03.570> never<00:01:03.809> seen<00:01:03.930> before<00:01:04.229> this<00:01:04.530> is

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
we've actually never seen before this is

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:05.840 
we've actually never seen before this is
the<00:01:04.769> first<00:01:04.979> time<00:01:05.129> we<00:01:05.280> actually<00:01:05.309> saw<00:01:05.790> this

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
the first time we actually saw this

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.850 
the first time we actually saw this
ability<00:01:06.180> shown<00:01:06.990> what's<00:01:07.320> interesting<00:01:07.590> about

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
ability shown what's interesting about

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.100 
ability shown what's interesting about
this<00:01:08.130> is<00:01:08.310> now<00:01:08.700> we<00:01:08.939> have<00:01:09.119> a<00:01:09.150> mobile<00:01:09.450> force<00:01:09.869> field

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
this is now we have a mobile force field

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.780 
this is now we have a mobile force field
as<00:01:10.229> well<00:01:10.710> as<00:01:10.830> one<00:01:11.010> that<00:01:11.130> we<00:01:11.220> can<00:01:11.250> plant<00:01:11.610> on<00:01:11.760> the

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
as well as one that we can plant on the

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.370 
as well as one that we can plant on the
ground<00:01:12.060> to<00:01:12.150> protect<00:01:12.510> ourselves<00:01:12.659> from<00:01:12.960> orbital

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
ground to protect ourselves from orbital

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.530 
ground to protect ourselves from orbital
stretch<00:01:13.680> which<00:01:14.100> we<00:01:14.280> saw<00:01:14.520> in<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.790> multiplayer

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
stretch which we saw in the multiplayer

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.530 
stretch which we saw in the multiplayer
gameplay<00:01:15.930> reveal<00:01:16.820> like<00:01:17.820> I<00:01:17.970> said<00:01:18.030> some<00:01:18.450> of

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
gameplay reveal like I said some of

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.480 
gameplay reveal like I said some of
these<00:01:18.600> are<00:01:18.810> big<00:01:18.990> so<00:01:19.259> here<00:01:19.590> we<00:01:19.619> learn<00:01:19.979> that<00:01:20.220> some

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
these are big so here we learn that some

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.219 
these are big so here we learn that some
power-ups<00:01:20.850> can<00:01:21.180> actually<00:01:21.570> be<00:01:21.689> swapped<00:01:22.049> out

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
power-ups can actually be swapped out

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.440 
power-ups can actually be swapped out
mid<00:01:22.500> combat<00:01:23.040> and<00:01:23.189> that<00:01:23.549> these<00:01:23.759> pods<00:01:24.030> most

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
mid combat and that these pods most

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.450 
mid combat and that these pods most
likely<00:01:24.810> drop<00:01:25.020> them<00:01:25.229> as<00:01:25.350> well<00:01:25.710> as<00:01:25.890> weapons<00:01:26.100> in

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
likely drop them as well as weapons in

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.460 
likely drop them as well as weapons in
this<00:01:26.880> first<00:01:27.210> shot<00:01:27.330> here<00:01:27.689> we<00:01:28.049> see<00:01:28.200> that<00:01:28.320> this

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
this first shot here we see that this

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.260 
this first shot here we see that this
class<00:01:28.740> has<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.189> mobile<00:01:29.610> force<00:01:29.820> field<00:01:30.090> from

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
class has the mobile force field from

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.910 
class has the mobile force field from
the<00:01:30.329> previous<00:01:30.810> shot<00:01:30.990> see<00:01:31.200> my<00:01:31.409> little<00:01:31.619> things

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
the previous shot see my little things

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.039 
the previous shot see my little things
are<00:01:32.040> important<00:01:32.430> people<00:01:32.700> but<00:01:33.240> in<00:01:33.450> this<00:01:33.720> shot

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
are important people but in this shot

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.440 
are important people but in this shot
here<00:01:34.439> only<00:01:35.100> a<00:01:35.130> few<00:01:35.340> seconds<00:01:35.670> later<00:01:35.909> we<00:01:36.030> see

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
here only a few seconds later we see

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.749 
here only a few seconds later we see
that<00:01:36.750> he<00:01:37.079> has<00:01:37.259> an<00:01:37.439> orbital<00:01:37.920> strike<00:01:38.130> in<00:01:38.460> the

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
that he has an orbital strike in the

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.460 
that he has an orbital strike in the
triangle<00:01:39.299> slot<00:01:39.600> and<00:01:39.840> a<00:01:40.079> new<00:01:40.229> piece<00:01:40.439> of

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
triangle slot and a new piece of

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.590 
triangle slot and a new piece of
equipment<00:01:40.650> that<00:01:41.100> can<00:01:41.189> be<00:01:41.310> activated<00:01:41.640> using<00:01:41.970> l1

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
equipment that can be activated using l1

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.530 
equipment that can be activated using l1
and<00:01:42.840> r1<00:01:43.229> in<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:44.430> next<00:01:44.759> image<00:01:44.909> we<00:01:45.149> learned<00:01:45.360> that

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
and r1 in the next image we learned that

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.710 
and r1 in the next image we learned that
the<00:01:45.659> icon<00:01:46.140> map<00:01:46.409> to<00:01:46.590> l1<00:01:47.130> is<00:01:47.310> a<00:01:47.369> grenade<00:01:48.149> launcher

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
the icon map to l1 is a grenade launcher

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.240 
the icon map to l1 is a grenade launcher
what's<00:01:48.990> even<00:01:49.229> more<00:01:49.259> interesting<00:01:49.560> about<00:01:50.070> this

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
what's even more interesting about this

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.980 
what's even more interesting about this
grenade<00:01:50.520> launchers<00:01:50.880> not<00:01:51.060> only<00:01:51.390> that<00:01:51.630> it<00:01:51.840> is

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
grenade launchers not only that it is

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.109 
grenade launchers not only that it is
new<00:01:52.350> to<00:01:52.590> battlefront<00:01:53.189> but<00:01:53.369> also<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:53.939> fact

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
new to battlefront but also the fact

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.090 
new to battlefront but also the fact
that<00:01:54.240> it<00:01:54.390> shoots<00:01:54.630> out<00:01:54.780> multiple<00:01:55.380> grenades<00:01:55.829> I

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
that it shoots out multiple grenades I

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.100 
that it shoots out multiple grenades I
wonder<00:01:56.579> if<00:01:56.670> this<00:01:56.790> will<00:01:56.880> be<00:01:57.000> only<00:01:57.180> for<00:01:57.570> survival

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
wonder if this will be only for survival

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.780 
wonder if this will be only for survival
mode<00:01:58.290> or<00:01:58.320> only<00:01:58.619> four<00:01:58.920> missions<00:01:59.280> mode<00:01:59.520> rather

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
mode or only four missions mode rather

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.850 
mode or only four missions mode rather
or<00:02:00.390> if<00:02:00.750> it<00:02:00.840> will<00:02:00.899> actually<00:02:01.049> be<00:02:01.320> able<00:02:01.500> to<00:02:01.740> be

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
or if it will actually be able to be

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.620 
or if it will actually be able to be
used<00:02:02.040> a<00:02:02.250> multiplayer<00:02:02.820> because<00:02:03.119> I<00:02:03.270> feel<00:02:03.600> like

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
used a multiplayer because I feel like

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.060 
used a multiplayer because I feel like
these<00:02:03.899> type<00:02:04.140> of<00:02:04.170> things<00:02:04.290> could<00:02:04.680> be<00:02:04.740> a<00:02:04.829> little

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
these type of things could be a little

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.130 
these type of things could be a little
opium<00:02:05.579> provide<00:02:05.969> a<00:02:06.000> lot<00:02:06.210> of<00:02:06.329> balance<00:02:06.719> issues

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
opium provide a lot of balance issues

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.900 
opium provide a lot of balance issues
but<00:02:07.590> then<00:02:07.710> I<00:02:07.740> think<00:02:08.039> to<00:02:08.160> myself<00:02:08.310> that<00:02:08.670> it's

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
but then I think to myself that it's

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.600 
but then I think to myself that it's
only<00:02:09.149> a<00:02:09.179> one<00:02:09.509> news<00:02:09.750> item<00:02:10.259> so<00:02:10.649> I<00:02:10.679> do<00:02:10.890> wonder<00:02:11.280> how

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
only a one news item so I do wonder how

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:12.880 
only a one news item so I do wonder how
these<00:02:11.849> classes<00:02:12.330> will<00:02:12.480> bow

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
these classes will bow

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:14.740 
these classes will bow
we<00:02:13.130> were<00:02:13.250> able<00:02:13.340> to<00:02:13.580> bring<00:02:13.730> these<00:02:14.000> classes<00:02:14.540> into

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
we were able to bring these classes into

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.630 
we were able to bring these classes into
missions<00:02:15.650> and<00:02:15.800> then<00:02:15.890> bring<00:02:16.069> them<00:02:16.160> back<00:02:16.370> in<00:02:16.550> the

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
missions and then bring them back in the

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.580 
missions and then bring them back in the
multiplayer<00:02:17.120> a<00:02:17.420> lot<00:02:17.930> of<00:02:18.080> questions<00:02:18.470> to<00:02:18.560> be

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
multiplayer a lot of questions to be

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.230 
multiplayer a lot of questions to be
answered<00:02:18.800> but<00:02:19.160> still<00:02:19.459> nonetheless<00:02:19.670> we<00:02:20.120> now

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.240 
answered but still nonetheless we now

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.000 
answered but still nonetheless we now
know<00:02:20.420> that<00:02:20.450> grenade<00:02:20.900> launchers<00:02:21.290> are<00:02:21.530> in<00:02:21.709> Star

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
know that grenade launchers are in Star

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.309 
know that grenade launchers are in Star
Wars<00:02:22.040> Battlefront<00:02:22.520> all<00:02:22.970> right<00:02:23.870> back<00:02:24.080> to<00:02:24.230> the

Wars Battlefront all right back to the

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:25.930 
Wars Battlefront all right back to the
big<00:02:24.500> stuff<00:02:24.740> and<00:02:24.890> by<00:02:25.040> big<00:02:25.220> stuff<00:02:25.430> I<00:02:25.520> mean<00:02:25.670> more

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
big stuff and by big stuff I mean more

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.730 
big stuff and by big stuff I mean more
explosions<00:02:26.540> and<00:02:26.690> more<00:02:26.810> exciting<00:02:27.290> for<00:02:27.319> Star

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:27.740 
explosions and more exciting for Star

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:29.650 
explosions and more exciting for Star
Wars<00:02:27.980> stuff<00:02:28.069> so<00:02:28.370> anyways<00:02:28.790> in<00:02:29.030> this<00:02:29.180> first<00:02:29.480> shot

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
Wars stuff so anyways in this first shot

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.930 
Wars stuff so anyways in this first shot
we<00:02:29.959> see<00:02:30.170> this<00:02:30.350> player<00:02:30.590> acquire<00:02:31.070> in<00:02:31.340> orbital

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
we see this player acquire in orbital

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.280 
we see this player acquire in orbital
strike<00:02:32.090> and<00:02:32.360> the<00:02:32.420> reason<00:02:32.690> it's<00:02:32.840> important<00:02:33.200> to

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
strike and the reason it's important to

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.260 
strike and the reason it's important to
point<00:02:33.470> this<00:02:33.650> out<00:02:33.830> is<00:02:33.980> because<00:02:34.490> we<00:02:34.850> don't<00:02:35.090> see

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.270 
point this out is because we don't see

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:36.880 
point this out is because we don't see
this<00:02:35.390> players<00:02:35.630> point<00:02:35.870> of<00:02:35.990> view<00:02:36.170> for<00:02:36.620> a<00:02:36.650> while

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
this players point of view for a while

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.100 
this players point of view for a while
until<00:02:37.160> this<00:02:37.580> second<00:02:38.120> shot<00:02:38.330> here<00:02:38.600> where<00:02:39.020> it

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
until this second shot here where it

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:40.210 
until this second shot here where it
looks<00:02:39.290> like<00:02:39.410> they're<00:02:39.560> just<00:02:39.739> using<00:02:39.920> their

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
looks like they're just using their

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:41.560 
looks like they're just using their
binoculars<00:02:40.459> now<00:02:40.910> I<00:02:40.940> don't<00:02:41.180> know<00:02:41.270> if<00:02:41.360> it<00:02:41.480> was

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:41.570 
binoculars now I don't know if it was

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:42.940 
binoculars now I don't know if it was
just<00:02:41.600> me<00:02:41.840> but<00:02:42.050> I<00:02:42.170> didn't<00:02:42.440> notice<00:02:42.560> immediately

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
just me but I didn't notice immediately

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.310 
just me but I didn't notice immediately
that<00:02:43.250> this<00:02:43.700> is<00:02:43.880> in<00:02:44.030> fact<00:02:44.060> them<00:02:44.480> calling<00:02:44.870> in<00:02:45.200> the

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.320 
that this is in fact them calling in the

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.140 
that this is in fact them calling in the
orbital<00:02:45.680> strike<00:02:45.890> because<00:02:46.340> that's<00:02:46.640> hinted<00:02:47.030> at

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
orbital strike because that's hinted at

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.120 
orbital strike because that's hinted at
by<00:02:47.360> the<00:02:47.420> next<00:02:47.900> shot<00:02:48.080> that<00:02:48.290> we<00:02:48.380> see<00:02:48.560> here<00:02:48.770> where

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
by the next shot that we see here where

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.130 
by the next shot that we see here where
we<00:02:49.280> see<00:02:49.430> an<00:02:49.550> eight<00:02:49.760> EST<00:02:50.060> getting<00:02:50.570> absolutely

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
we see an eight EST getting absolutely

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.800 
we see an eight EST getting absolutely
obliterated<00:02:52.100> from<00:02:52.160> lasers<00:02:52.910> in<00:02:53.030> the<00:02:53.150> sky<00:02:53.360> the

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
obliterated from lasers in the sky the

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.150 
obliterated from lasers in the sky the
reason<00:02:54.050> why<00:02:54.140> I<00:02:54.170> said<00:02:54.410> this<00:02:54.440> could<00:02:54.739> be<00:02:54.860> missed

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
reason why I said this could be missed

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.400 
reason why I said this could be missed
or<00:02:55.400> looked<00:02:55.700> upon<00:02:55.970> or<00:02:56.390> looked<00:02:56.630> over<00:02:56.930> rather<00:02:57.140> is

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
or looked upon or looked over rather is

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.229 
or looked upon or looked over rather is
because<00:02:58.040> of<00:02:58.160> the<00:02:58.220> fact<00:02:58.430> that<00:02:58.550> it<00:02:58.730> blends<00:02:59.030> in

00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239 
because of the fact that it blends in

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:01.090 
because of the fact that it blends in
with<00:02:59.330> the<00:02:59.390> action<00:02:59.870> going<00:03:00.140> on<00:03:00.290> I<00:03:00.590> could<00:03:01.040> have

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.100 
with the action going on I could have

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:02.590 
with the action going on I could have
missed<00:03:01.250> it<00:03:01.459> just<00:03:01.640> myself<00:03:01.820> but<00:03:02.090> I<00:03:02.209> figured<00:03:02.510> it

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.600 
missed it just myself but I figured it

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.810 
missed it just myself but I figured it
was<00:03:02.690> something<00:03:02.870> worth<00:03:03.110> pointing<00:03:03.470> out<00:03:03.820> and

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:04.820 
was something worth pointing out and

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.030 
was something worth pointing out and
finally<00:03:05.239> at<00:03:05.570> number<00:03:05.600> seven<00:03:06.470> comes<00:03:06.739> at<00:03:06.920> the

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
finally at number seven comes at the

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.770 
finally at number seven comes at the
very<00:03:07.400> end<00:03:07.700> of<00:03:08.000> the<00:03:08.150> trailer<00:03:08.480> with<00:03:08.750> the

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
very end of the trailer with the

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.020 
very end of the trailer with the
following<00:03:09.200> three<00:03:09.530> images<00:03:09.830> here's<00:03:10.700> one<00:03:10.910> of<00:03:10.970> the

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
following three images here's one of the

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:12.970 
following three images here's one of the
more<00:03:11.150> standout<00:03:11.600> images<00:03:12.019> because<00:03:12.380> it<00:03:12.680> seems

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
more standout images because it seems

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:14.350 
more standout images because it seems
like<00:03:13.130> the<00:03:13.310> heroes<00:03:13.670> are<00:03:13.850> confirmed<00:03:14.209> to<00:03:14.300> be

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 
like the heroes are confirmed to be

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.720 
like the heroes are confirmed to be
rather<00:03:14.930> specific<00:03:15.470> two<00:03:15.800> modes<00:03:16.100> than<00:03:16.430> matched

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
rather specific two modes than matched

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:18.069 
rather specific two modes than matched
which<00:03:16.970> is<00:03:17.150> quite<00:03:17.450> different<00:03:17.720> from<00:03:17.930> the

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:18.079 
which is quite different from the

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:19.720 
which is quite different from the
previous<00:03:18.230> battlefront<00:03:19.010> games<00:03:19.220> because

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
previous battlefront games because

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:21.250 
previous battlefront games because
obviously<00:03:19.940> in<00:03:20.269> this<00:03:20.390> shot<00:03:20.600> we<00:03:20.780> see<00:03:20.959> Luke

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.440 
obviously in this shot we see Luke
Skywalker<00:03:21.799> and<00:03:22.040> Darth<00:03:22.070> Vader<00:03:22.459> battling<00:03:23.299> on

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:27.430 
soloist and then during the multiplayer
gameplay<00:03:25.760> reveal<00:03:26.209> we<00:03:26.420> saw<00:03:26.600> them<00:03:26.810> battling<00:03:27.260> on

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440

battlefront reveal from Star Wars
Celebration<00:03:31.579> weekend<00:03:32.269> we<00:03:32.630> saw<00:03:32.840> Darth<00:03:33.110> Vader

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410 
Celebration weekend we saw Darth Vader

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:35.920 
Celebration weekend we saw Darth Vader
on<00:03:33.650> Endor<00:03:34.340> so<00:03:34.760> is<00:03:34.880> it<00:03:34.910> specific<00:03:35.540> to<00:03:35.570> modes

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
on Endor so is it specific to modes

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:37.509 
on Endor so is it specific to modes
because<00:03:36.140> during<00:03:36.500> that<00:03:36.709> reveal<00:03:36.980> trailer<00:03:37.250> once

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:37.519 
because during that reveal trailer once

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:40.390 
because during that reveal trailer once
again<00:03:37.790> we<00:03:37.940> saw<00:03:38.150> Walker<00:03:38.540> assault<00:03:38.840> or<00:03:39.320> an<00:03:39.769> idea

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
again we saw Walker assault or an idea

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.160 
again we saw Walker assault or an idea
of<00:03:40.459> what<00:03:40.640> Walker<00:03:40.880> assault<00:03:41.150> would<00:03:41.510> be<00:03:41.720> like<00:03:41.959> and

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:42.170 
of what Walker assault would be like and

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:43.509 
of what Walker assault would be like and
that's<00:03:42.230> what<00:03:42.350> the<00:03:42.500> press<00:03:42.620> saw<00:03:42.890> behind<00:03:43.220> closed

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:43.519 
that's what the press saw behind closed

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:45.520 
that's what the press saw behind closed
doors<00:03:43.820> so<00:03:44.360> it<00:03:44.600> seems<00:03:44.930> like<00:03:45.140> it's<00:03:45.320> rather

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
doors so it seems like it's rather

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:48.340 
doors so it seems like it's rather
specific<00:03:45.920> two<00:03:46.310> game<00:03:46.640> modes<00:03:46.720> then<00:03:47.720> actually

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:48.350 
specific two game modes then actually

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:49.810 
specific two game modes then actually
the<00:03:48.530> maps<00:03:48.799> so<00:03:49.160> I<00:03:49.190> figured<00:03:49.280> this<00:03:49.640> was<00:03:49.790> a

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:49.820 
the maps so I figured this was a

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:51.160 
the maps so I figured this was a
conclusion<00:03:50.209> that<00:03:50.450> we<00:03:50.540> can<00:03:50.570> make<00:03:50.780> because<00:03:50.959> of

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.170 
conclusion that we can make because of

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:53.020 
conclusion that we can make because of
this<00:03:51.290> trailer<00:03:51.650> because<00:03:51.739> we<00:03:51.920> see<00:03:52.190> the<00:03:52.790> same

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030 
this trailer because we see the same

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:54.729 
this trailer because we see the same
heroes<00:03:53.480> on<00:03:53.660> three<00:03:54.019> different<00:03:54.260> meds<00:03:54.500> which

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:54.739 
heroes on three different meds which

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:55.870 
heroes on three different meds which
we've<00:03:54.920> actually<00:03:55.130> never<00:03:55.370> seen<00:03:55.519> in<00:03:55.790> a
