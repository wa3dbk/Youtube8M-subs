00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:08.290
 the matches at the FIFA World Cup are a 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:11.139
 Model for fair play Unsporting behavior 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:14.869
 two teams who fight hard but fair for the biggest success in football 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.500
 what kind of a game would be without mutual respect and respect of the 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.349
 regulate 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:23.460
 that's how it looks like 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.689
 Football came from competitions of neighboring villages 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:28.869
 many players barely rules 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:32.830
 Given this origin, modern football can be the ideal sporty one 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:35.480
 just can not always live up to it 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.670
 as at the FIFA World Cup 54, there was 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.160
 heated scenes 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.540
 It was the first tournament televised 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:48.020
 Hungary and Brazil do not give each other anything. There were three place referrals and 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.020
 after the game a fight 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.030
 but the so-called battle of the intestine 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.430
 is not an isolated case in the past 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:01.820
 the will to win often causes some players to help with violence 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.410
 if it does not work out otherwise 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:09.460
 In Yugoslavia was in 1962 it rained clock consequences 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.830
 after a nasty foul on Yugoslavia Storyteller Sarstedt game 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:19.010
 The game Chile Italy also went down in history at this tournament 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:23.440
 Italian journalists Antonio Schier Elia and Corrado Pizzi report 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.140
 had published a few unsavory articles about the host country 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.409
 Schiele retaliated for it in the battle of Santiago 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.299
 you do not always have to get in fully 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.299
 just drop your leg for a moment 

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:20.739
 The battle continued in Santiago 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:24.089
 for RenÃ© was sent off after seven minutes 

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:27.089
 8 minutes later he also left the field 

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:33.909
 Cameroon's simple motto for the quarter-finals in 1990 was stopped 

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:36.909
 Claudio Caniggia 

00:02:38.589 --> 00:02:41.589
 they followed this motto with absolute dedication 

00:03:01.289 --> 00:03:06.059
 the most common as exit of the Argentine was Boll the ego Maradona 

00:03:06.059 --> 00:03:10.519
 his incredible ability to cast his maneuverability and speed 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:13.519
 his opponents sometimes no alternative 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:36.999
 In Santiago, it was a little alarming of the Italian performance or 

00:03:36.999 --> 00:03:40.579
 put off because that had kicked by bosses in the neck 

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:44.459
 Officials and journalists intervened to put an end to the violence 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:49.159
 sometimes the most inconspicuous players are responsible for the 

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:50.609
 most dangerous fools 

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:55.009
 The Brazilian Leonardo actually known as a quiet player starts one 

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:58.779
 the most dangerous faults of the 1994 FIFA World Cup 

00:04:02.119 --> 00:04:05.559
 for his elbow check against Pedro Lenz looked quite red 

00:04:06.179 --> 00:04:09.179
 the American had suffered a fractured skull 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:25.370
 There are seldom violent outbreaks at the FIFA World Cup 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:28.590
 Nevertheless, the will to win sometimes misleads oneself 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:29.760
 Player is too lazy 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.070
 Normally, conflicts are limited to a little push 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:36.050
 and push 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:39.539
 It also happens that just the man is affected for order 

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:42.539
 should take care of 

00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:49.699
 whether obvious or hidden fights and wood will always belong to the game 

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:51.849
 sometimes the emotions boil 

00:04:51.849 --> 00:04:55.900
 the most important thing in this situation is that the rules are not forgotten 

00:04:58.159 --> 00:05:01.319
 how could that be better than the real police officers? 

00:05:07.839 --> 00:05:11.319
 the battle of Santiago would probably continue 

00:05:11.319 --> 00:05:13.539
 the referee would not have reached 

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:17.430
 only two players were sent off, the Italians had none 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:18.669
 quiet minute more 

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:21.139
 there were even excesses in the training camp 

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:24.940
 By the way, football was also played two to zero for Chile
