TNT moves when you hit it okay and so
the<00:03:26.209> reason<00:03:26.450> you<00:03:26.480> get<00:03:26.629> the<00:03:26.720> stone<00:03:26.900> slabs<00:03:27.260> is<00:03:27.709> to

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:28.609 
the reason you get the stone slabs is to

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:30.610 
the reason you get the stone slabs is to
put<00:03:28.819> them<00:03:28.939> here<00:03:29.780> okay

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620 
put them here okay

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.680 
put them here okay
this<00:03:31.129> stops<00:03:31.400> the<00:03:31.609> TNT<00:03:31.910> from<00:03:32.120> moving<00:03:32.299> they<00:03:32.510> just

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
this stops the TNT from moving they just

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:34.839 
this stops the TNT from moving they just
fall<00:03:32.840> straight<00:03:33.049> down<00:03:33.169> and<00:03:33.680> so<00:03:34.340> it's<00:03:34.609> not<00:03:34.699> going

00:03:34.839 --> 00:03:34.849 
fall straight down and so it's not going

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:36.970 
fall straight down and so it's not going
to<00:03:34.940> mess<00:03:35.030> up<00:03:35.150> your<00:03:35.209> cannon<00:03:35.629> and<00:03:35.810> to<00:03:36.739> get<00:03:36.889> these

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
to mess up your cannon and to get these

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:38.500 
to mess up your cannon and to get these
in<00:03:37.129> the<00:03:37.220> air<00:03:37.340> like<00:03:37.519> I<00:03:37.609> have<00:03:37.819> them<00:03:37.970> you<00:03:38.209> put<00:03:38.419> the

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 
in the air like I have them you put the

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:40.509 
in the air like I have them you put the
redstone<00:03:38.720> down<00:03:39.139> first<00:03:39.440> and<00:03:39.919> then<00:03:40.160> you<00:03:40.280> try<00:03:40.489> to

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:40.519 
redstone down first and then you try to

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:42.280 
redstone down first and then you try to
put<00:03:40.760> the<00:03:40.849> stone<00:03:41.030> slab<00:03:41.209> on<00:03:41.569> the<00:03:41.659> redstone<00:03:42.049> and

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290 
put the stone slab on the redstone and

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.199 
put the stone slab on the redstone and
then<00:03:42.859> it<00:03:43.040> will<00:03:43.159> automatically<00:03:43.639> move<00:03:43.819> it<00:03:44.000> into

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:44.209 
then it will automatically move it into

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:46.629 
then it will automatically move it into
position<00:03:44.419> that<00:03:44.810> you<00:03:44.900> want<00:03:45.370> all<00:03:46.370> right<00:03:46.549> so
