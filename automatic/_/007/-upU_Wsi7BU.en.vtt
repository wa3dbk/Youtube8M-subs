00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.120
 and 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.550
 we started the circuit just like 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.559
 we always do it by explaining proof to 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.440
 test in this case of the Mahindra brand 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:43.350
 pit instead and where the vehicle is going 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:47.449
 to go through and what you are going to look for is to go 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.449
 side by side of the faces of the pit 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.710
 the second test once it leaves the 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:01:00.400
 pit this curve at 35 degrees where the 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:02.830
 vehicle will go totally inclined 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:05.320
 one thing that would stand out from this mahindra 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:08.500
 double cabin the hardness feels very 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:11.580
 hard it feels very good and over 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.580
 everything comfortable 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.610
 after he leaves the curve of 35 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.640
 degrees is going to get into this pit that the 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:24.750
 We fill with water just to show 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.750
 the power that has 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.909
 you brought all the artillery I see that 

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:32.350
 is mined the place seems right 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:34.270
 to show the people who come here 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.710
 remember that there is a 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.960
 effort to come in all the 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:40.299
 diversity that you have of vehicles and of 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.850
 mahindra range if we were bringing 

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:44.020
 much of the lot we have there 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.670
 the motor market 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.170
 the idea was just that there is a 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.450
 variety of the product or that people 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:51.009
 apart from doing the circuit you can go 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.439
 seeing the units that we have now 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:56.380
 both in the double cabin and in the 

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:59.369
 I hit and the genius guy we're 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.369
 having now also true 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:05.190
 once it leaves the pit it goes to 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:06.950
 face these tests very, very 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.270
 demanding that people like a lot 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:12.690
 here what we are going to check the angle 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:15.570
 of attack that this 4x4 has 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.970
 course will start to descend and here 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:20.430
 what to look for representative 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:24.650
 show how this double cab machine 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:28.810
 it goes down slowly 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.810
 the brakes at its maximum power 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:38.380
 you have the next test that is 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:42.240
 a test where the cushioning is 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.240
 will demand its maximum expression 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.950
 What it is the hardest test that you spend 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.350
 of everything but which cost you a little 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:50.210
 more the day none cost me only 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:52.870
 I wanted to try the issue were 

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:52.870
 balanced 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:03.709
 a small curve and this parallel ramp 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:05.959
 where this really is very demanding 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:08.930
 test for all 4x4 vehicle if it were 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:11.359
 a 4 x would not happen just for this 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:14.060
 one of the wheels is left in the air 

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:16.340
 because the ramp one is further on from 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.939
 another the traction control starts at 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.939
 to work 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.760
 we go to monitor galiana that comes to 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.260
 try it mahindra double cabin that the 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.140
 circuit extradited you thank you very much 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:32.770
 for coming good thanks to you 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:36.970
 to mahindra for the invitation really 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:38.740
 surprised very good very good very well 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:42.640
 he behaves before so many 

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:45.310
 adversities and good pleasant surprise 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:48.820
 also having found a clue 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:51.970
 also made as the one on wheels to 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:55.750
 who in rakiura and the mud is 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:58.390
 quite well however has asked 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:01.260
 we try to be a little soft first 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:01.260
 for the truck but
