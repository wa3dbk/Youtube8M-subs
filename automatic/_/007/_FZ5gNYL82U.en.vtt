00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.090
 but they are having a good time only in lithium querétaro and they are going to learn how 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:14.299
 make icons for both of you 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:16.070
 as for 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:17.169
 windows 

00:00:17.169 --> 00:00:22.450
 because then the good difference for the two has to be the p ng point 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:25.609
 and for it for windows 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:28.609
 it has to be adecco dot format 

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:30.429
 these 

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:32.420
 and how they are not going to be in high quality 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:33.900
 because we were fast 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.850
 to start manás they are going to need 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:38.310
 the prelate 

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:40.890
 here you can download the pdf 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.310
 important when unloading the power it always depends to run the one that jean 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:48.430
 peace 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:51.430
 as an administrator, yes, it will not work 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.900
 follow the instructions step by step 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.900
 perfectly how it says 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:03.320
 in the file of the instructions that appear in 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.140
 in fervor cs4 portable 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:07.640
 or what and chance 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.299
 cheeky files at once downloading them world 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:14.760
 2 not just one and open it and then the other one 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.850
 both once downloaded the two 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.460
 just unzip first and I think the second one is going to appear 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:24.520
 automatically 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.520
 that happens in almost all cases 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:31.850
 i the one of the sellar alvear with 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.280
 attracts with the program 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.240
 this 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.680
 they will not have problems and super simple 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:40.970
 perfect 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.950
 for this to make him shortcuts to his desk 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.469
 everyone to be able to work well because 

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:49.650
 let's start 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:51.039
 fast because 

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:53.790
 there is no much time 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.790
 first let's see a fervor 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.800
 we are going to give in 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.980
 then document 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:06.210
 of favors png 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.009
 let's put him 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.219
 500 by 500 with a resolution of up to 200 pixels per inch 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:16.489
 i bierzo color is the background 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:18.359
 it's going to be transparent 

00:02:18.359 --> 00:02:20.079
 this is important or that 

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:23.489
 so that it is in good quality i 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:27.379
 of course not only do not appear a box but 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:30.879
 let's go away 

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:34.449
 we are going to liven up this program and now we are going to open 

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:36.569
 the power equal k 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:37.990
 if they have 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.860
 because 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.110
 or maybe on how to use it well 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:42.230
 the text be 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:45.689
 can use it doors to any design program 

00:02:45.689 --> 00:02:46.979
 basically 

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:51.349
 but I like cooler side because he has all the tools and is 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:53.529
 much easier 

00:02:53.529 --> 00:02:57.609
 so let's be an icon for the st 

00:02:57.609 --> 00:03:00.829
 that will be easy 

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:02.179
 how are we going to do it 

00:03:02.179 --> 00:03:05.179
 boozer as follows 

00:03:06.429 --> 00:03:07.619
 you can do 

00:03:07.619 --> 00:03:11.529
 logo that you who were drawings what you want to acquire 

00:03:12.139 --> 00:03:15.799
 all this is going to be this because I put to myself I like it more 

00:03:17.339 --> 00:03:20.339
 it's easier for what we're doing right now 

00:03:23.029 --> 00:03:24.910
 let's write the baby 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:28.249
 the go the x 

00:03:28.249 --> 00:03:31.249
 We are going to make them very big 

00:03:31.969 --> 00:03:34.599
 single 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:37.789
 we can change the destination 

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:40.969
 the style we want 

00:03:40.969 --> 00:03:43.969
 propose this 

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:48.069
 I'm going to leave it this way 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:51.069
 but I'm going to be bigger 

00:03:53.289 --> 00:03:56.289
 good not so big 

00:03:59.089 --> 00:04:02.089
 a structure more or less so that it looks good not 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:06.799
 once being this as it is a letter let's go it is not enough to scratch 

00:04:08.309 --> 00:04:10.199
 as you say 

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:13.199
 posada to convert that curve 

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:18.219
 the ship is doing this week seems answered let's go to this 

00:04:18.219 --> 00:04:19.559
 tool 

00:04:19.559 --> 00:04:22.520
 he was wrong 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.520
 and we are going to stretch it to modify it 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.309
 as we close 

00:04:29.309 --> 00:04:32.650
 i make our son do not look more yes no 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.330
 the city also 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:46.090
 no matter how he can be as he is really angry is 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:48.090
 teaching how to be the icons 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:52.469
 let's copy it control c we're going to go alex has appeared 

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:54.389
 wolves to beat control v 

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:57.389
 then let's give it back to sample 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:02.979
 from the corners we can make it smaller so that it fits in our 

00:05:03.689 --> 00:05:06.960
 ours our work area 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.960
 now promote before the white background box 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:16.089
 to remove that let's go to the magic wand and with the 7 button 

00:05:16.089 --> 00:05:19.439
 let's select all the white areas okay 

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:24.819
 all white areas once all the long series are selected 

00:05:24.819 --> 00:05:25.789
 we go 

00:05:25.789 --> 00:05:28.569
 to the delay of seven and pressure 

00:05:28.569 --> 00:05:30.740
 always the branches 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:32.999
 just press in berlin 

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:35.550
 and the background will be removed 

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:38.550
 from there we're going to press the key is that 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:41.150
 and ready 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:44.270
 We can be the smallest without if you wish 

00:05:45.849 --> 00:05:48.849
 On the other hand, what happened 

00:05:49.969 --> 00:05:55.249
 now we are going to 

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:01.169
 things separately by without we are modifying take it out 

00:06:02.139 --> 00:06:04.999
 do not be so difficult in mind very big 

00:06:04.999 --> 00:06:07.999
 I think we can get away 

00:06:16.069 --> 00:06:18.520
 we do the same 

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:21.520
 we will select for all the tasks raised 

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:25.240
 i eliminate it 

00:06:26.669 --> 00:06:30.350
 to see if it disappears that cdc is selected everything 

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:33.539
 here in tolerance they put it to 41 for what 

00:06:33.539 --> 00:06:36.539
 so it's been 

00:06:40.309 --> 00:06:42.200
 we would 

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:44.330
 modify the size 

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:46.889
 in our of our x 

00:06:46.889 --> 00:06:49.889
 to the size or that we want 

00:06:50.619 --> 00:06:53.619
 in this way 

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:02.430
 because we already have our 

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:03.770
 our letters 

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:05.639
 now so it does not look so 

00:07:05.639 --> 00:07:10.030
 so but let's click here and we'll give it where it says tool 

00:07:10.669 --> 00:07:12.339
 tenant 

00:07:12.339 --> 00:07:15.629
 and we go the model up 

00:07:15.629 --> 00:07:18.629
 the other down 

00:07:19.419 --> 00:07:22.319
 and so our image will no longer be so square truth
