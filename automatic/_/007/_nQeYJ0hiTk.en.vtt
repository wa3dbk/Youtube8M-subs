00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:18.320 
and welcome to my C 3 cube review arm i

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.689 
and welcome to my C 3 cube review arm i
will<00:00:19.320> i'm<00:00:19.529> just<00:00:19.710> going<00:00:19.859> to<00:00:19.920> get<00:00:20.250> right<00:00:20.430> down<00:00:20.490> to

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
will i'm just going to get right down to

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.580 
will i'm just going to get right down to
it<00:00:20.910> I<00:00:21.090> guess<00:00:21.300> um<00:00:22.430> so<00:00:23.430> the<00:00:23.609> c3<00:00:24.060> this<00:00:24.240> is<00:00:24.390> a<00:00:24.590> very

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
it I guess um so the c3 this is a very

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.970 
it I guess um so the c3 this is a very
very<00:00:26.189> good<00:00:26.519> cute<00:00:26.849> arm<00:00:27.090> I<00:00:28.050> don't<00:00:28.680> know<00:00:28.769> if<00:00:28.859> you

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
very good cute arm I don't know if you

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.179 
very good cute arm I don't know if you
guys<00:00:29.099> remember<00:00:29.160> my<00:00:29.869> YJ<00:00:30.869> fin<00:00:31.349> hop<00:00:31.529> cube<00:00:31.830> review

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
guys remember my YJ fin hop cube review

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.900 
guys remember my YJ fin hop cube review
but<00:00:32.700> this<00:00:32.880> is<00:00:33.090> probably<00:00:33.360> a<00:00:34.489> perfect<00:00:35.489> when<00:00:35.790> you

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
but this is probably a perfect when you

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.400 
but this is probably a perfect when you
first<00:00:36.120> get<00:00:36.329> it<00:00:36.450> out<00:00:36.540> of<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.719> box<00:00:36.930> it<00:00:37.230> is<00:00:37.290> a

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
first get it out of the box it is a

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.540 
first get it out of the box it is a
perfect<00:00:37.829> mix<00:00:38.219> between<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.850> f2<00:00:39.390> and<00:00:39.420> that<00:00:39.960> arm

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:40.550 
perfect mix between the f2 and that arm

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:47.150 
perfect mix between the f2 and that arm
so<00:00:41.550> this<00:00:41.910> is<00:00:42.290> this<00:00:43.290> is<00:00:43.440> very<00:00:43.860> good<00:00:44.100> I<00:00:45.980> like<00:00:46.980> this

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
so this is this is very good I like this

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.580 
so this is this is very good I like this
a<00:00:47.219> lot<00:00:47.309> but<00:00:48.000> um<00:00:48.239> what<00:00:48.600> I<00:00:48.629> what<00:00:49.020> I<00:00:49.050> did<00:00:49.379> which

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
a lot but um what I what I did which

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.279 
a lot but um what I what I did which
really<00:00:50.039> improved<00:00:50.489> it<00:00:50.670> is<00:00:50.820> i<00:00:51.510> put<00:00:51.539> shock<00:00:51.870> oil<00:00:52.050> in

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
really improved it is i put shock oil in

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.830 
really improved it is i put shock oil in
it<00:00:52.379> which<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:53.129> cube<00:00:53.789> when<00:00:54.329> you<00:00:54.420> first<00:00:54.629> get

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
it which the cube when you first get

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.479 
it which the cube when you first get
it's<00:00:55.050> a<00:00:55.140> little<00:00:55.379> out<00:00:55.500> of<00:00:55.530> control<00:00:55.800> and<00:00:56.129> a

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
it's a little out of control and a

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.729 
it's a little out of control and a
little<00:00:56.730> lucky<00:00:57.800> and<00:01:00.020> putting<00:01:01.020> shock<00:01:01.260> oil<00:01:01.440> and

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
little lucky and putting shock oil and

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.100 
little lucky and putting shock oil and
almost<00:01:02.129> anything<00:01:02.460> will<00:01:02.910> and<00:01:03.329> almost<00:01:03.629> any<00:01:03.809> Q

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
almost anything will and almost any Q

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.410 
almost anything will and almost any Q
will<00:01:04.949> sort<00:01:05.610> of<00:01:05.670> it<00:01:05.790> won't<00:01:05.939> i<00:01:06.030> won't<00:01:06.060> really

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
will sort of it won't i won't really

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.270 
will sort of it won't i won't really
slow<00:01:06.659> it<00:01:06.750> down<00:01:06.810> but<00:01:07.170> some<00:01:07.590> first<00:01:07.920> somehow

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
slow it down but some first somehow

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.179 
slow it down but some first somehow
it'll<00:01:08.880> just<00:01:09.119> bring<00:01:09.630> it<00:01:09.720> under<00:01:09.930> control<00:01:10.189> quiet

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
it'll just bring it under control quiet

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.399 
it'll just bring it under control quiet
the<00:01:11.460> q<00:01:12.320> and<00:01:13.320> i<00:01:13.409> really<00:01:13.650> like<00:01:13.799> that<00:01:13.950> effect<00:01:14.280> and

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:15.409 
the q and i really like that effect and

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:18.020 
the q and i really like that effect and
some<00:01:16.409> cubes<00:01:16.710> those<00:01:16.830> little<00:01:17.159> dramatic<00:01:17.340> like<00:01:17.850> in

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
some cubes those little dramatic like in

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.140 
some cubes those little dramatic like in
the<00:01:18.150> f2<00:01:18.590> i<00:01:19.590> guess<00:01:20.340> it's<00:01:20.490> good<00:01:20.640> for<00:01:20.820> one-handed

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
the f2 i guess it's good for one-handed

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.300 
the f2 i guess it's good for one-handed
but<00:01:21.509> i<00:01:21.659> don't<00:01:21.930> like<00:01:22.049> putting<00:01:22.229> shock<00:01:22.530> wave<00:01:22.710> 1<00:01:22.890> f

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
but i don't like putting shock wave 1 f

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.880 
but i don't like putting shock wave 1 f
2<00:01:23.369> s<00:01:23.729> but<00:01:24.060> um<00:01:24.270> it<00:01:24.780> works<00:01:25.320> really<00:01:25.500> well<00:01:25.650> in<00:01:25.799> the

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
2 s but um it works really well in the

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.990 
2 s but um it works really well in the
c3<00:01:26.280> but<00:01:26.820> i<00:01:26.970> will<00:01:27.150> just<00:01:27.360> go<00:01:27.840> over<00:01:27.990> it<00:01:28.850> right<00:01:29.850> now

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
c3 but i will just go over it right now

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.840 
c3 but i will just go over it right now
so<00:01:30.360> tensions<00:01:31.350> these<00:01:32.130> are<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.400> tensions<00:01:32.729> out

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
so tensions these are the tensions out

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.620 
so tensions these are the tensions out
of<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.000> box<00:01:33.210> um<00:01:33.799> for<00:01:34.799> corner-cutting<00:01:35.420> can<00:01:36.420> cut

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
of the box um for corner-cutting can cut

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.310 
of the box um for corner-cutting can cut
to<00:01:36.840> about<00:01:37.049> their<00:01:37.350> little<00:01:38.310> farther<00:01:38.990> not<00:01:39.990> really

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
to about their little farther not really

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.350 
to about their little farther not really
a<00:01:40.350> whole<00:01:40.500> lot<00:01:40.560> farther<00:01:40.829> zone<00:01:41.220> if<00:01:41.820> you<00:01:41.850> loosen

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
a whole lot farther zone if you loosen

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.880 
a whole lot farther zone if you loosen
it<00:01:42.479> it's<00:01:42.899> some<00:01:43.200> sides<00:01:43.439> are<00:01:43.590> tighter<00:01:43.799> than

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
it it's some sides are tighter than

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.100 
it it's some sides are tighter than
others<00:01:44.250> because<00:01:44.460> this<00:01:44.670> is<00:01:44.820> how<00:01:44.939> it<00:01:45.119> came<00:01:45.270> but

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
others because this is how it came but

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.060 
others because this is how it came but
um<00:01:47.930> if<00:01:48.930> you<00:01:49.110> loosened<00:01:49.530> it<00:01:49.619> enough<00:01:49.860> you<00:01:49.890> could

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
um if you loosened it enough you could

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.639 
um if you loosened it enough you could
probably<00:01:50.280> get<00:01:50.520> close<00:01:50.700> to<00:01:50.820> 45<00:01:51.270> reverse<00:01:52.229> quarter

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
probably get close to 45 reverse quarter

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.190 
probably get close to 45 reverse quarter
cutting<00:01:52.799> just<00:01:53.100> like<00:01:53.220> any<00:01:53.369> other<00:01:53.460> q<00:01:54.170> except<00:01:55.170> for

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
cutting just like any other q except for

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.740 
cutting just like any other q except for
the<00:01:55.380> goo<00:01:55.500> home<00:01:55.880> goo<00:01:56.880> hyung<00:01:57.060> is<00:01:57.270> like<00:01:57.479> the<00:01:57.689> only

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
the goo home goo hyung is like the only

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.170 
the goo home goo hyung is like the only
cube<00:01:58.229> which<00:01:59.009> can<00:01:59.189> reverse<00:01:59.490> quarter<00:01:59.850> cut<00:02:00.030> is

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
cube which can reverse quarter cut is

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.520 
cube which can reverse quarter cut is
invented<00:02:00.840> reverse<00:02:01.200> corner-cutting<00:02:01.740> okay

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
invented reverse corner-cutting okay

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:09.889 
invented reverse corner-cutting okay
pops<00:02:04.820> this<00:02:05.820> cube<00:02:06.299> arm<00:02:06.630> i<00:02:08.119> think<00:02:09.119> it<00:02:09.300> does<00:02:09.569> have

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
pops this cube arm i think it does have

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.340 
pops this cube arm i think it does have
a<00:02:10.370> small<00:02:11.370> amount<00:02:11.849> of<00:02:12.030> pop<00:02:12.300> resistance

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
a small amount of pop resistance

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.560 
a small amount of pop resistance
it's<00:02:13.890> a<00:02:14.040> little<00:02:14.400> bit<00:02:14.520> curved<00:02:14.850> out<00:02:15.150> here<00:02:15.450> I

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
it's a little bit curved out here I

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.000 
it's a little bit curved out here I
don't<00:02:15.780> know<00:02:15.840> if<00:02:15.960> you<00:02:16.020> can<00:02:16.170> notice<00:02:16.200> that<00:02:16.680> it<00:02:16.860> is

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
don't know if you can notice that it is

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.640 
don't know if you can notice that it is
you<00:02:17.970> I<00:02:18.300> think<00:02:18.660> it<00:02:18.900> might<00:02:19.110> be<00:02:19.140> either<00:02:19.410> be<00:02:19.560> an

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
you I think it might be either be an

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.030 
you I think it might be either be an
illusion<00:02:19.950> or<00:02:20.280> it<00:02:20.430> is<00:02:20.520> like<00:02:20.700> that<00:02:21.620> that<00:02:22.620> these

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
illusion or it is like that that these

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.510 
illusion or it is like that that these
pieces<00:02:23.250> are<00:02:23.430> slightly<00:02:23.760> out<00:02:24.060> so<00:02:24.270> it<00:02:24.630> does<00:02:24.870> have

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520 
pieces are slightly out so it does have

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.220 
pieces are slightly out so it does have
some<00:02:26.520> pop<00:02:26.730> resistance<00:02:27.270> and<00:02:27.420> it<00:02:27.810> doesn't<00:02:28.140> pop

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
some pop resistance and it doesn't pop

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.760 
some pop resistance and it doesn't pop
very<00:02:28.500> often<00:02:28.830> for<00:02:28.860> me<00:02:29.130> um<00:02:29.790> oh<00:02:30.570> I<00:02:30.870> have<00:02:31.380> this<00:02:31.560> like

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
very often for me um oh I have this like

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.490 
very often for me um oh I have this like
this<00:02:31.950> i<00:02:32.220> will<00:02:32.610> show<00:02:33.330> you<00:02:33.390> the<00:02:33.660> internals<00:02:34.230> so

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
this i will show you the internals so

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.540 
this i will show you the internals so
first<00:02:34.770> off<00:02:35.900> the<00:02:36.900> core<00:02:37.140> has<00:02:37.350> this<00:02:38.070> pump<00:02:38.400> I

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
first off the core has this pump I

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.400 
first off the core has this pump I
believe<00:02:38.880> it<00:02:39.000> that's<00:02:39.150> similar<00:02:39.510> to<00:02:39.570> the<00:02:39.810> F<00:02:39.990> to

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
believe it that's similar to the F to

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:45.290 
believe it that's similar to the F to
let<00:02:41.340> me<00:02:41.490> see<00:02:41.670> yep<00:02:41.910> see<00:02:42.810> this<00:02:43.500> is<00:02:43.710> the<00:02:43.740> F<00:02:44.400> to<00:02:44.850> see

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
let me see yep see this is the F to see

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:52.700 
let me see yep see this is the F to see
if<00:02:45.360> we<00:02:45.450> can<00:02:45.570> get<00:02:45.690> that<00:02:45.840> in<00:02:45.960> focus<00:02:46.730> okay<00:02:51.710> it's

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:52.710 
if we can get that in focus okay it's

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:54.170 
if we can get that in focus okay it's
about<00:02:52.950> as<00:02:53.040> good<00:02:53.190> as<00:02:53.310> it<00:02:53.400> oh<00:02:53.550> there<00:02:53.790> we<00:02:53.910> go<00:02:53.940> so

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
about as good as it oh there we go so

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.930 
about as good as it oh there we go so
you<00:02:54.270> now<00:02:54.390> you<00:02:54.480> can<00:02:54.630> see<00:02:54.750> the<00:02:54.840> pump<00:02:55.050> and<00:02:55.610> on<00:02:56.610> here

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
you now you can see the pump and on here

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.710 
you now you can see the pump and on here
it's<00:02:57.180> like<00:02:57.450> exactly<00:02:58.080> the<00:02:58.200> same<00:02:58.760> and<00:02:59.760> now<00:03:00.180> this

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
it's like exactly the same and now this

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.050 
it's like exactly the same and now this
part<00:03:01.080> I<00:03:01.230> don't<00:03:01.320> have<00:03:01.530> my<00:03:01.650> YJ<00:03:01.860> with<00:03:02.250> me<00:03:02.460> but<00:03:02.670> this

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
part I don't have my YJ with me but this

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.820 
part I don't have my YJ with me but this
is<00:03:03.210> very<00:03:03.270> similar<00:03:03.660> to<00:03:03.810> the<00:03:03.930> YJ<00:03:04.410> now<00:03:04.680> it<00:03:04.800> just

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
is very similar to the YJ now it just

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.280 
is very similar to the YJ now it just
says<00:03:05.070> these<00:03:05.340> so<00:03:05.550> it<00:03:05.670> doesn't<00:03:05.910> lock<00:03:06.290> putting

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
says these so it doesn't lock putting

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:08.990 
says these so it doesn't lock putting
shock<00:03:07.500> oil<00:03:07.680> and<00:03:07.980> it<00:03:08.070> helps<00:03:08.370> so<00:03:08.610> it<00:03:08.760> doesn't

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
shock oil and it helps so it doesn't

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.590 
shock oil and it helps so it doesn't
lock<00:03:09.240> even<00:03:09.630> more<00:03:09.780> um<00:03:10.220> and<00:03:11.220> then<00:03:11.370> see<00:03:12.150> this<00:03:12.360> part

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
lock even more um and then see this part

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.140 
lock even more um and then see this part
is<00:03:12.810> sanded<00:03:13.200> down<00:03:13.350> a<00:03:13.620> to<00:03:14.400> limit<00:03:14.700> some<00:03:14.880> friction

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
is sanded down a to limit some friction

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:16.820 
is sanded down a to limit some friction
on<00:03:15.360> the<00:03:15.420> core<00:03:15.720> because<00:03:16.020> sometimes<00:03:16.440> if<00:03:16.590> you<00:03:16.650> cut

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
on the core because sometimes if you cut

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.670 
on the core because sometimes if you cut
corners<00:03:17.190> that<00:03:17.910> part<00:03:18.240> will<00:03:18.660> hit<00:03:19.140> the<00:03:19.260> core<00:03:19.530> and

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
corners that part will hit the core and

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.520 
corners that part will hit the core and
so<00:03:20.420> causing<00:03:21.420> lock<00:03:21.570> up<00:03:21.750> so<00:03:21.930> that<00:03:22.080> helps<00:03:22.350> and

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
so causing lock up so that helps and

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.720 
so causing lock up so that helps and
also<00:03:22.830> lightens<00:03:23.250> the<00:03:23.340> cube<00:03:25.010> yeah<00:03:26.010> other<00:03:26.640> than

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
also lightens the cube yeah other than

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:28.190 
also lightens the cube yeah other than
that<00:03:26.880> the<00:03:27.060> corners<00:03:27.330> are<00:03:27.450> pretty<00:03:27.630> normal<00:03:27.870> this

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
that the corners are pretty normal this

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.990 
that the corners are pretty normal this
part<00:03:28.440> is<00:03:28.530> curved<00:03:28.830> just<00:03:29.190> like<00:03:29.310> the<00:03:29.460> f2<00:03:29.820> and

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
part is curved just like the f2 and

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.490 
part is curved just like the f2 and
pretty<00:03:30.960> much<00:03:31.050> all<00:03:31.350> the<00:03:31.530> new<00:03:31.650> cubes<00:03:31.980> nowadays

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500 
pretty much all the new cubes nowadays

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:39.230 
pretty much all the new cubes nowadays
um<00:03:34.730> I<00:03:36.140> I<00:03:37.140> really<00:03:37.620> like<00:03:37.770> this<00:03:37.920> cube<00:03:38.220> all<00:03:38.370> might

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:39.240 
um I I really like this cube all might

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:41.540 
um I I really like this cube all might
go<00:03:39.420> home<00:03:39.630> right<00:03:39.990> now<00:03:40.140> the<00:03:40.200> car<00:03:40.560> is<00:03:40.590> broken<00:03:40.890> so<00:03:41.520> i

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:41.550 
go home right now the car is broken so i

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:45.940 
go home right now the car is broken so i
can't<00:03:41.820> really<00:03:41.850> compare<00:03:42.240> it<00:03:42.330> to<00:03:42.450> the<00:03:42.540> goo<00:03:42.720> hyung

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:49.600 

but<00:03:46.950> besides<00:03:47.370> that<00:03:47.490> this<00:03:47.640> cube<00:03:48.120> is<00:03:48.410> really

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:49.610 
but besides that this cube is really

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:52.430 
but besides that this cube is really
really<00:03:50.610> good<00:03:50.880> i<00:03:50.940> think<00:03:51.360> this<00:03:51.480> is<00:03:51.540> a<00:03:51.720> must-have

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
really good i think this is a must-have

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.850 
really good i think this is a must-have
tube<00:03:53.190> if<00:03:53.430> you<00:03:53.610> uh<00:03:54.320> you<00:03:55.320> know<00:03:55.440> want<00:03:55.650> to<00:03:55.740> be<00:03:55.830> a

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:59.090 
tube if you uh you know want to be a
serious<00:03:56.220> speed<00:03:56.430> cuber<00:03:56.760> uh<00:03:57.800> you<00:03:58.800> know<00:03:58.950> in<00:03:59.070> my

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100 
serious speed cuber uh you know in my

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.660 
serious speed cuber uh you know in my
opinion<00:03:59.490> the<00:03:59.990> f2<00:04:00.990> goo<00:04:01.500> hyung<00:04:01.680> and<00:04:01.950> the<00:04:02.190> c3

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:05.820 
right now are three three by threes that

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:09.440 
right now are three three by threes that
are<00:04:05.970> must-haves<00:04:06.960> oh<00:04:07.910> that's<00:04:08.910> pretty<00:04:09.240> much<00:04:09.390> it

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450 
are must-haves oh that's pretty much it
