00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.820
 but happy to do that a little bit 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.710
 differently a little more scripted not 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.879

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.700
 So I'm here to introduce you 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.470
 what's in this little bag of 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.360
 spring is not very original I do not

 am not there mary bag poppins 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.080

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.420
 nice to watch and it gives ideas 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.589
 that's it it came to me when I love 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.150
 many this kind of videos so I 

00:00:55.589 --> 00:01:00.390
 am that I had presented my version 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:02.430
 I had this wonderful bag from 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.570
 sabrina for spring it's with 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.650
 usher partnership with them since one 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.270
 little moment it's a mark that 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.340
 I love they make bags of extreme 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.380
 quality and each collection is more 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.299
 beautiful than the previous one is really 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.370
 happiness is that and I do not 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.020
 not tired and this model there of the new 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:17.940
 collection is absolutely divine it's a 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.070
 little bag actually I have the version in 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:22.260
 bigger and in gray that I was using 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.880
 a lot this winter alas this version 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.469
 there for spring summer is really 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.869
 Too much pretend play and return 

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:29.700
 the guardrail info but it's not the 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.350
 better because I have a big 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.750
 surprise for you so I invite you to 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.479
 stay until the end of the video for 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.579
 discover all this the first thing 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.229
 we have in his bag when the beautiful 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.909
 days are coming to it's obviously a 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.619
 pair of sunglasses then 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.939
 this one comes from zara I had it 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.560
 bought in Grenoble a little while ago 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.899
 when I went to see my girlfriend oria 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.100
 and I love them they are really very 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.950
 pretty and I find that for spring 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.229
 they are perfect as right now 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:58.289
 had a self-respecting buzz I keep with 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:00.810
 me a little notebook because god knows 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:02.039
 if we still have millions of things to 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.140
 note in 

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:06.030
 I like having lists of little ones 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.259
 little things since quotes and 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.330
 it's always nice to see the 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:12.120
 will come out under moment this one comes from 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.370
 at hema I obviously have with me my 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.960
 wallet so this one is also 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.520
 of the new collection from 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:19.440
 sabrina it is really handy 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.819
 with plenty of pockets in it but 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.020
 as I had just received it and well 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:23.430
 there is not much in it 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.900
 and yes no I do not keep a 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.440
 empty wallet in normal time I 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.540
 reassures you 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.610
 I also have my little tube of gel 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.870
 antibacterial from home andy that 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.020
 I like a lot because he feels 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.250
 extremely good 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.600
 always practical to have when you 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.060
 do not necessarily have a sink for you 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.740
 wash your hands nearby I 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.460
 also with me a small package of 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:41.140
 handkerchiefs 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:43.240
 those are really original 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.130
 since there are flamingos big on it 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:46.720
 it really feels very original 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:48.700
 since there are flamingos on it 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.860
 and they are canon I always like 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.330
 to have on me in a small kit 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.600
 I keep some beauty affairs 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:58.210
 really the kit of the essentials the kit of 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:01.000
 Relief small wipe scents 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:02.790
 cupcakes a powder foundation of 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.620
 at lancome I like a lot 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.810
 a lipstick from etam 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.100
 a little bit flash because that's it 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.660
 sometimes we do not have time to 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.790
 make up and a knife I leave that 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:21.310
 does very well make it a red to 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:27.040
 lip balm slightly tinged pink a 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:29.710
 dry shampoo from klorane and finally 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.510
 a small tweezers so this one 

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:31.870
 comes from primark and I love them 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.240
 a lot 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.340
 then from time to time I keep that in 

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:38.050
 my bag is a role an antistress 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.250
 I like to see her on me when I 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:41.650
 know that I'm going to have events 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:43.360
 a little speed in the day I 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.770
 also keeps charge which comes from 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.060
 at ebay and I like it a lot 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:50.520
 always practical when you have an iphone 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:50.520
 and it's already over for my bag 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:58.650

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:03.090
