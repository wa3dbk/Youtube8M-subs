on the other side um then I decided to

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.930

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
get one cuz I thought it was really

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.890 
get one cuz I thought it was really
convenient<00:02:38.319> it's<00:02:39.319> safe<00:02:39.650> space<00:02:40.750> and<00:02:41.750> we'll

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
convenient it's safe space and we'll

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:47.979 
convenient it's safe space and we'll
come<00:02:42.080> back<00:02:42.110> around<00:02:42.410> and<00:02:43.600> door<00:02:45.700> so<00:02:46.780> yeah<00:02:47.780> that's

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:47.989 
come back around and door so yeah that's

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:50.680 
come back around and door so yeah that's
pretty<00:02:48.080> much<00:02:48.290> it<00:02:48.650> the<00:02:49.610> reason<00:02:50.209> that<00:02:50.420> this

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
pretty much it the reason that this

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:53.380 
pretty much it the reason that this
place<00:02:51.230> is<00:02:51.680> really<00:02:51.920> small<00:02:52.130> because<00:02:52.850> it<00:02:53.180> was

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
place is really small because it was

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.949 
place is really small because it was
meant<00:02:53.690> for<00:02:53.780> two<00:02:54.680> people<00:02:55.069> yeah<00:02:55.790> they<00:02:56.660> made<00:02:56.840> it

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 
meant for two people yeah they made it

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:59.890 
meant for two people yeah they made it
into<00:02:57.200> a<00:02:57.230> triple<00:02:57.500> because<00:02:58.160> of<00:02:58.519> the<00:02:59.180> size<00:02:59.480> of<00:02:59.780> the

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
into a triple because of the size of the

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.920 
into a triple because of the size of the
