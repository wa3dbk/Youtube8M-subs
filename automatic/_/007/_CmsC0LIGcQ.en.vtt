00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.470
 hello people and welcome to facts 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:08.230
 about facts about star fox 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:10.570
 let's start with a little one again 

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:13.209
 history lessons 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:15.369
 on the third of june 1993 the first one appeared 

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:17.770
 star fox litter with the name starring 

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:19.689
 for the nds in europe with his 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:21.509
 integrated superflex chip enabled 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:23.770
 this game at this time 

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:26.079
 revolutionary polygons built 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:27.910
 3d graphic of the shooter is still valid today 

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:29.490
 guidepost of his genre and enjoys 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:33.670
 cult status 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:35.320
 On October 20, 1997, something appeared 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:38.080
 for the nintendo 64 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:40.120
 fox debut on the n64 decreed 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:42.519
 at the time about outstanding polygon 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.260
 graphic English and Latin 

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:48.430
 language issue as well as the multiplayer 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:50.320
 Mode for up to four persons on 22 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.180
 november 2002 appeared starfox 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.399
 adventures for the nintendo gamecube 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.260
 the game reminded of the gameplay to the 

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:56.770
 zelda row what many fans not at all 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.510
 liked 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:00.129
 originally the game was but 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:01.809
 not planned as a star fox part but 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:05.009
 master in the game with the name of yours 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:08.860
 on planet but more on that later 

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:10.210
 on 29 april 2005 various fox 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.399
 salt for the gamecube 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:14.229
 it combines the gameplay suffers from 

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:16.119
 wars with a rather deathmatch-like 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:17.259
 according to the game principle 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:18.850
 multiplayer mode so far 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:21.040
 most extensive of the star fox series 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.610
 anyway peter fox than should as the 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:27.340
 weakest litter of the star fox series 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:29.770
 on 27 january 2007 starfox appeared 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.240
 command for the nintendo ds in this 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.310
 Part of the series were many tactical 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.229
 elements added but otherwise 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:38.590
 basically played like sting or 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:41.320
 suffers wars we continue with the 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:43.330
 just mentioned dinosaur planet he 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.250
 was working on a dinosaur 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:47.049
 planet for the nintendo 64 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.600
 but the memory space of a n64 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:52.060
 cartridge was unfortunately too limited therefore 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.710
 the game has appeared instead 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.210
 appeared two years later starfox 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.789
 adventures which basically the same 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:58.890
 game with better graphics is not 

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:00.729
 all 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.649
 originally there were two different ones 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:04.450
 playable characters between those 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:06.909
 could change the two were 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.769
 Christel and himself was through 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:10.149
 fox replaced and christel in best 

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:12.069
 princess peach spanier easy 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:15.010
 kidnapped and must be rescued 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:16.600
 so much to emancipation it too 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.519
 some film sequences removed 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:21.069
 the story is very much towards the end 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:22.660
 far-fetched looks originally white 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:24.819
 also planned that the characters like 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.739
 Left locally on part during the game 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:27.730
 which of course will be older 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:29.650
 was deleted 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.269
 Final starfox in my opinion 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.920
 after a pretty good game 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:34.620
 easy herten albeit with a 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.030
 aftertaste 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.829
 and because that was so beautiful 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.970
 however, even more star fox lickers the 

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:42.610
 never appeared 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.019
 First, then starfox would be two 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.690
 that actually appear for the nds 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:48.130
 why should not it ultimately 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:50.530
 it was completed unfortunately 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:52.299
 unknown but the good news is 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.280
 that you play star fox two anyway 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:57.130
 because the beta of the game is your way 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:59.170
 found in the internet then there 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:01.720
 it still does not exist or, better yet, does not exist 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.880
 starboxx for the virtual boy of this part 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.080
 should be called a tech demo for the 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.340
 virtual boy children 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.760
 and well, I mean, look at it 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.100
 impressive or 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.660
 This was similar to the planet 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.420
 time out of the box another game 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.980
 and that's what it's all about here 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.070
 for parallel and differences 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:24.670
 I do not know because both games are easy 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:26.320
 well, look at it i have to say 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:27.820
 that I am quite surprised 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:29.260
 if that's the star fox series at all 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:31.120
 is still going on 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.310
 After so many let off easy 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.080
 which has been canceled 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.210
 has devoured development costs 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.950
 bestsellers are the lakers too 

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:41.230
 not necessarily and a revolutionary 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:43.720
 Gameplay battista fox last on the 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.930
 nds I do not understand it but more 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.890
 motor will know what he is doing 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:51.010
 Finally, let's have a look 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:53.140
 pair parallel with the f series to the 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:55.420
 star fox series has many crossovers with 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:58.000
 the ex juror series the other 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:00.400
 futuristic franchise from nintendo in 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.260
 For example, there are aix and tricks 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.360
 a driver of a human the version 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:06.130
 of james with cloud the father of fox 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.470
 there is also a driver with 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:10.239
 the name october also in the 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:12.550
 star fox franchise is represented 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:15.220
 in star fox command there are some nx 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:17.290
 with references to psycho in one end 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:20.850
 for example you can see how fox and falcon 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:23.050
 ride with the c zero copy or 4 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:25.270
 what now with this issue again 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:27.280
 facts about facts and if it is you 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:30.250
 Then he liked it until he let himself 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:34.620
 anna broda rating comment bla bla 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:34.620
 until next time and ciao
