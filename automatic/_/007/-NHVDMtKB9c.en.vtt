00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:41.390 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:47.049 

okay<00:00:42.390> so<00:00:42.559> start<00:00:43.559> off<00:00:43.590> with<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:43.949> D<00:00:44.070> suspended

00:00:47.049 --> 00:00:47.059 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:51.049 

it's<00:00:48.059> just<00:00:48.980> open<00:00:49.980> D<00:00:50.100> chord<00:00:50.399> with<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.760> pinkie

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.310 
it's just open D chord with the pinkie
on<00:00:51.089> 3rd<00:00:51.600> fret<00:00:51.809> on<00:00:51.839> the<00:00:51.960> high<00:00:52.079> E<00:00:53.809> then<00:00:54.809> you<00:00:55.110> lift

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
on 3rd fret on the high E then you lift

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.670 
on 3rd fret on the high E then you lift
off<00:00:55.500> that<00:00:55.949> pinky<00:00:56.280> finger<00:00:56.549> and<00:00:56.790> you<00:00:57.479> strum<00:00:57.809> the

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
off that pinky finger and you strum the

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.369

high

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:07.480 

then<00:01:01.980> you<00:01:02.579> keep<00:01:02.730> on<00:01:02.910> going<00:01:03.059> up<00:01:03.420> each<00:01:05.090> string

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490 
then you keep on going up each string

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:16.070 
then you keep on going up each string
you<00:01:08.490> sometimes<00:01:08.939> add<00:01:09.270> in<00:01:09.450> a<00:01:09.720> couple<00:01:13.729> then<00:01:15.080> it

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
you sometimes add in a couple then it

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:24.069 
you sometimes add in a couple then it
could<00:01:16.200> be<00:01:16.229> different<00:01:16.680> each<00:01:16.860> time

00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:24.079 

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:39.730 

okay<00:01:25.079> slowly<00:01:25.490> very<00:01:26.490> slowly<00:01:26.549> go<00:01:26.939> like<00:01:27.090> this

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.010 

excellent<00:01:40.740> now<00:01:41.040> we're<00:01:41.220> gonna<00:01:41.340> use<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:42.300> G

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
excellent now we're gonna use the G

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.680 
excellent now we're gonna use the G
structure<00:01:43.500> but<00:01:43.800> I<00:01:43.830> move<00:01:44.700> it<00:01:44.820> up<00:01:44.880> to<00:01:45.060> two

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:45.690 
structure but I move it up to two

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:50.900 
structure but I move it up to two
fingers<00:01:48.500> you<00:01:49.500> know<00:01:49.530> just<00:01:49.890> do<00:01:50.520> some<00:01:50.700> kind<00:01:50.880> of

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:50.910 
fingers you know just do some kind of

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:53.240 
fingers you know just do some kind of
strumming<00:01:51.270> pattern<00:01:51.750> that<00:01:51.900> will<00:01:52.050> sort<00:01:52.830> of<00:01:52.890> go

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
strumming pattern that will sort of go

00:01:53.250 --> 00:02:02.240 
strumming pattern that will sort of go
along<00:01:53.490> with<00:01:53.730> the<00:01:54.090> record<00:02:00.290> that's<00:02:01.290> probably

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
along with the record that's probably

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.300 
along with the record that's probably
not<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.820> correct<00:02:03.150> one<00:02:03.330> but<00:02:03.860> whatever<00:02:04.860> this

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
not the correct one but whatever this

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:11.330 
not the correct one but whatever this
isn't<00:02:05.640> a<00:02:05.790> note<00:02:06.090> for<00:02:06.630> note<00:02:07.610> lesson<00:02:09.740> so<00:02:10.740> very

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
isn't a note for note lesson so very

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:26.410 
isn't a note for note lesson so very
slowly<00:02:11.610> it<00:02:12.060> goes

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.200 

and<00:02:27.420> just<00:02:27.600> keeps<00:02:27.750> on<00:02:27.870> doing<00:02:28.230> that<00:02:28.470> until<00:02:29.210> they

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 
and just keeps on doing that until they

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:35.480 
and just keeps on doing that until they
go<00:02:30.330> into<00:02:30.470> distortion<00:02:31.790> power<00:02:32.790> chords<00:02:33.230> and<00:02:34.490> what

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
go into distortion power chords and what

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.850 
go into distortion power chords and what
I<00:02:35.550> sometimes<00:02:35.790> like<00:02:36.360> to<00:02:36.510> do<00:02:36.660> is<00:02:36.840> pick<00:02:37.320> with<00:02:37.500> the

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
I sometimes like to do is pick with the

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:43.850 
I sometimes like to do is pick with the
G<00:02:38.610> chord<00:02:38.820> apart<00:02:39.150> just<00:02:39.780> strum<00:02:41.360> single<00:02:42.860> strings

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
G chord apart just strum single strings
