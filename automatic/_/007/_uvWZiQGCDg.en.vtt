probably want to do if that happens is

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.359 
probably want to do if that happens is

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
corner or the top left corner if you

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.400 
corner or the top left corner if you
have<00:00:32.669> it<00:00:32.820> turned<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.180> way<00:00:33.270> that<00:00:33.420> I<00:00:33.450> did<00:00:33.570> and

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
have it turned the way that I did and

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.869 
have it turned the way that I did and
hold<00:00:34.590> that<00:00:34.710> down<00:00:34.950> for<00:00:37.190> five<00:00:38.190> seconds<00:00:38.670> and<00:00:38.790> then

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
hold that down for five seconds and then

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.670 
hold that down for five seconds and then
slide<00:00:39.180> to<00:00:39.360> power<00:00:39.390> off<00:00:39.719> that's<00:00:40.230> one<00:00:40.410> thing<00:00:40.649> that

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
slide to power off that's one thing that

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.170 
slide to power off that's one thing that
you<00:00:40.860> can<00:00:40.980> do<00:00:41.100> turn<00:00:41.370> it<00:00:41.520> back<00:00:41.640> on<00:00:41.670> and<00:00:41.879> see<00:00:42.090> if

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
you can do turn it back on and see if

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.170 
you can do turn it back on and see if
that<00:00:42.420> helps<00:00:42.840> if<00:00:43.649> that<00:00:43.829> doesn't<00:00:44.190> help<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:44.910> next

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
that helps if that doesn't help the next

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.459 
that helps if that doesn't help the next
thing<00:00:45.329> that<00:00:45.450> I<00:00:45.510> would<00:00:45.570> suggest<00:00:45.750> is<00:00:46.140> going<00:00:46.350> to

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
thing that I would suggest is going to

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.580 
thing that I would suggest is going to
settings<00:00:46.969> and<00:00:47.969> from<00:00:48.360> settings<00:00:48.809> go<00:00:49.469> to<00:00:49.500> general

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
settings and from settings go to general

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.939 
settings and from settings go to general
and<00:00:50.129> to<00:00:50.399> reset<00:00:50.850> and<00:00:51.690> you<00:00:51.840> want<00:00:52.079> to<00:00:52.170> reset<00:00:52.649> all

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
and to reset and you want to reset all

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.830 
and to reset and you want to reset all
settings<00:00:52.980> not<00:00:53.820> erase<00:00:54.149> all<00:00:54.360> content<00:00:54.510> and

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
settings not erase all content and

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.889 
settings not erase all content and
settings<00:00:54.930> but<00:00:55.890> reset<00:00:56.399> all<00:00:56.579> settings<00:00:56.870> when<00:00:57.870> you

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
settings but reset all settings when you

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.439 
settings but reset all settings when you
do<00:00:58.199> that<00:00:58.440> what<00:00:59.340> it<00:00:59.430> does<00:00:59.579> is<00:00:59.730> it<00:00:59.850> resets<00:01:00.030> all

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
do that what it does is it resets all

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.209 
do that what it does is it resets all
the<00:01:00.600> settings<00:01:00.930> that<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.530> apps<00:01:01.739> may<00:01:02.160> be

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
the settings that the apps may be

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.630 
the settings that the apps may be
holding<00:01:02.699> onto<00:01:02.850> and<00:01:03.739> that<00:01:04.739> can<00:01:04.890> just<00:01:04.920> flush<00:01:05.369> out

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
holding onto and that can just flush out

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.359 
holding onto and that can just flush out
a<00:01:05.670> lot<00:01:05.939> of<00:01:05.970> processes<00:01:06.659> that<00:01:06.930> are<00:01:07.250> maybe<00:01:08.250> just

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
a lot of processes that are maybe just

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.399 
a lot of processes that are maybe just
caught<00:01:08.909> it's<00:01:09.330> maybe<00:01:09.479> just<00:01:09.659> a<00:01:09.720> bottleneck<00:01:10.380> of

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
caught it's maybe just a bottleneck of

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.109 
caught it's maybe just a bottleneck of
information<00:01:11.189> that<00:01:11.310> it's<00:01:11.430> trying<00:01:11.580> to<00:01:11.670> process

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
information that it's trying to process

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.969 
information that it's trying to process
and<00:01:12.540> if<00:01:12.600> you<00:01:12.750> reset<00:01:13.200> all<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.470> settings<00:01:13.830> it

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
and if you reset all the settings it

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.130 
and if you reset all the settings it
just<00:01:14.159> flushes<00:01:14.549> all<00:01:14.700> that<00:01:14.880> out<00:01:15.090> and<00:01:15.270> then<00:01:15.869> quite

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
just flushes all that out and then quite

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.340 
just flushes all that out and then quite
often<00:01:17.030> once<00:01:18.030> that<00:01:18.210> we<00:01:18.360> start<00:01:18.720> you<00:01:18.990> can<00:01:19.110> open

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
often once that we start you can open

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.969 
often once that we start you can open
the<00:01:19.439> apps<00:01:19.590> again<00:01:20.030> if<00:01:21.030> that<00:01:21.479> doesn't<00:01:22.110> work<00:01:22.259> you

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
the apps again if that doesn't work you

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.710 
the apps again if that doesn't work you
want<00:01:23.159> to<00:01:23.220> consider<00:01:23.520> maybe<00:01:23.850> deleting<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.600> app

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
want to consider maybe deleting the app

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.270 
want to consider maybe deleting the app
and<00:01:25.020> read<00:01:25.170> I'm<00:01:25.350> loading<00:01:25.710> it<00:01:25.799> if<00:01:25.979> you<00:01:26.070> want<00:01:26.220> to

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
and read I'm loading it if you want to

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.870 
and read I'm loading it if you want to
delete<00:01:26.520> an<00:01:26.729> app<00:01:26.880> I<00:01:28.009> press<00:01:29.009> and<00:01:29.189> hold<00:01:29.340> on<00:01:29.520> any<00:01:29.700> of

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
delete an app I press and hold on any of

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.330 
delete an app I press and hold on any of
them<00:01:30.060> I'll<00:01:30.780> start<00:01:31.020> to<00:01:31.140> shake<00:01:31.380> and<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:32.130> ones

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
them I'll start to shake and the ones

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.190 
them I'll start to shake and the ones
that<00:01:32.670> you<00:01:32.820> purchased<00:01:33.450> or<00:01:33.540> downloaded<00:01:34.049> will

that you purchased or downloaded will

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.410 
that you purchased or downloaded will
have<00:01:34.290> a<00:01:34.320> little<00:01:34.590> eggs<00:01:34.799> before<00:01:35.700> you<00:01:35.970> can<00:01:36.150> delete

have a little eggs before you can delete

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.080 
have a little eggs before you can delete
them<00:01:36.630> and<00:01:36.810> then<00:01:37.590> redownload<00:01:38.220> them<00:01:38.430> sometimes

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
them and then redownload them sometimes

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.170 
them and then redownload them sometimes
that<00:01:39.240> can<00:01:39.509> help<00:01:40.040> still<00:01:41.040> doesn't<00:01:41.400> help<00:01:41.520> what

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
that can help still doesn't help what

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.639 
that can help still doesn't help what
you<00:01:42.210> really<00:01:42.540> want<00:01:42.720> to<00:01:42.810> consider<00:01:43.079> doing<00:01:43.170> is

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
you really want to consider doing is

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.649 
you really want to consider doing is
just<00:01:43.829> wiping<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.430> iPad<00:01:44.759> clean<00:01:45.119> and<00:01:45.299> starting

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
just wiping the iPad clean and starting

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.630 
just wiping the iPad clean and starting
again<00:01:45.840> seems<00:01:46.409> a<00:01:46.530> bit<00:01:46.680> drastic<00:01:47.220> but<00:01:47.399> it's<00:01:47.520> not
