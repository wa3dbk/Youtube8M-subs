00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:41.309 
so boring living but I just think it is
beats<00:03:37.260> gonna<00:03:37.650> need<00:03:37.920> though

00:03:41.309 --> 00:03:41.319 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:43.440 

I<00:03:41.379> also<00:03:42.099> think<00:03:42.280> they<00:03:42.430> use<00:03:42.609> this<00:03:42.790> texture<00:03:43.239> pack

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
I also think they use this texture pack

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:45.929 
I also think they use this texture pack
on<00:03:43.659> the<00:03:43.840> server<00:03:44.230> of<00:03:44.620> some<00:03:44.859> sort<00:03:45.159> not<00:03:45.430> sure<00:03:45.730> what

00:03:45.929 --> 00:03:45.939 
on the server of some sort not sure what

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:49.850 
on the server of some sort not sure what
that<00:03:45.969> server<00:03:46.420> is

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860

10 to be fair my opinion over is an
attend<00:04:56.520> though<00:04:56.700> because<00:04:56.910> i<00:04:57.180> really<00:04:57.450> like<00:04:57.630> the

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:57.900 
attend though because i really like the

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:00.020 
attend though because i really like the
elder<00:04:58.110> scrolls<00:04:58.140> and<00:04:58.800> such<00:04:59.040> and<00:04:59.340> Skyrim<00:05:00.000> is

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:00.030 
elder scrolls and such and Skyrim is

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:02.300 
elder scrolls and such and Skyrim is
just<00:05:00.300> it's<00:05:00.570> a<00:05:00.660> good<00:05:00.810> game<00:05:01.020> so<00:05:01.500> the<00:05:01.860> fact<00:05:02.190> that

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:02.310 
just it's a good game so the fact that

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:04.670 
just it's a good game so the fact that
they'd<00:05:02.490> give<00:05:02.760> like<00:05:02.940> a<00:05:02.970> tribute<00:05:03.540> texture<00:05:04.500> pack

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:04.680 
they'd give like a tribute texture pack

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.230 
they'd give like a tribute texture pack
for<00:05:04.710> minecraft<00:05:05.100> to<00:05:05.610> it<00:05:05.730> that's<00:05:05.910> pretty<00:05:06.030> neat
