00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:06.600
 mari is one of the most 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.910
 emblematic of the world of videogames and 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.620
 although everything is said mario bros is not 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.019
 your last name but it refers to 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.360
 the two brothers mario and luigi for it 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.890
 his full name would be mario mario and 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.350
 as it is very close to his 30th birthday 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.350
 we have prepared this curious data 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.800
 our favorite plumber that little by little 

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:27.690
 he was a carpenter he did not start his 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.490
 adventures in the mushroom kingdom with neither 

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:31.500
 that name but jumping barrels in a 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.020
 Donkey Kong game where by the way 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.360
 I could not jump initially and I had to 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.830
 save Pauline his first great love in 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.660
 a principle was known by the name 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:41.520
 of the champagne or mister video but 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.710
 he was finally called mario in honor of 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.449
 mario sigal since he had a similar 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.949
 physical however and several things guys 

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:48.840
 that you might be surprised at this great 

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:50.610
 character the first is the reason for 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.710
 what's wearing a cap instead of hair and 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.510
 because that big mustache well in that 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.489
 era hair and mouth were impossible 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.320
 to cheer up and it was decided to disguise that 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.120
 way if you ever thought is that the 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.399
 mario's paradise could be amsterdam 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.540
 with so much mush you were right because the 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.640
 name of oil in which it gives its 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:07.130
 powers is amanita muscaria or kills 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.810
 flies that have hallucinogenic effects 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.850
 Moreover, he recalls that according to the 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.590
 instructions of the super mario bros all 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.180
 the blocks and stones are people who 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.520
 have been converted by the invasion of 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.320
 koopas or that mario is a murderer 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.210
 Mario Bros is one of the characters of 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.039
 most recognized fiction in the world by 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.750

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:26.850
 for 'cell and something has to see that 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.260
 until 2009 super mariobros out the 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.450
 best-selling game in history 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.520
 until it came wii sports throughout 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.080
 his existence has appeared in more than 200 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.790
 videogames being the saga with more 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:39.650

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.650
 193 million copies 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.740
 Today I 'm going to reveal something that all gamer 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.990
 that he has tried and has tried 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.640
 failed and is jumping over the 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.110
 flag because I'm sorry to tell you that 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.820
 original games what was behind 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.740
 it was a wall that by no means 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.120
 we could cross as I feel 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.280
 tell you there is a movie of this 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.810
 saga that was a complete shit but of 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.820
 these old ones that make you bleed 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.110
 eyes and certainly if you thought there 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.970
 history after the name of others 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05.950
 characters are right because 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:07.390
 luigi emerged from a pizzeria that was 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.490
 near the offices of nintendo 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.230
 North America called mario and luigi's 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:13.060
 which also means appeared in 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.820
 Japanese the character or several was called 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.800
 well because the w is an inverted m and for 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:19.570
 mean bad as well as the koopas 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.550

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:23.740
 Japanese or book that was inspired by the 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.270
 wife of the co-creator and finally change 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:27.310
 that was inspired by a trauma of the 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:28.690
 childhood of miyamoto then when a 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.310
 dog was attacking him he stayed 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.050
 centimeters of his face to be 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.790
