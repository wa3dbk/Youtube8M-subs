00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:12.930
 and we 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:16.320
 faithful and gluten-free biscuits 

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:18.330

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.160
 You can also taste that as a human very much 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.790

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:32.309
 we need 100 grams for it 

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:35.879
 smoked bacon 50 grams of butter 200 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:39.090
 gram buckwheat flour, even if it is 

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:41.610
 Buckwheat flour is called buckwheat 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.530
 to the family the knotweed and is with it 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.989
 he is related to the rhubarb it is 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:51.570
 no grain and it is absolutely 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:01:01.170
 200 grams of gluten-free 200 of them 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:01:04.649
 lager quark half an apple and 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:07.050
 I have two tablespoons of grated cheese 

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:10.890
 taken the sale and have this here 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:15.149
 already prepared half a grated 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:17.970
 apple and about two tablespoons intervened 

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:25.290
 grated or we make it now 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:30.630
 dog biscuits that he now at lower 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:32.970
 heat 50 grams butter the 100 grams and 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.560
 small cube sliced â€‹â€‹bacon off 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.010
 waiting 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.010
 it will take a little bit 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:49.720
 meanwhile I have 200 in the key 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:55.620
 buckwheat flour and 200 grams 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:55.620
 lean quark combined with the 1 1 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:06.520
 from the escaped bacon butter 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:08.590
 mixed I have three tablespoons fed with 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.130
 added and because the whole now 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.130
 knead 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:17.440
 That's how the day looks when he finishes 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:19.920
 kneaded must now be around the five 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:25.150
 crowns for a few minutes and then add 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:27.850
 in addition to remaining ingredients 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:32.050
 rested dough now come two 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:35.860
 tablespoon of grated cheese half 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:40.900
 grated apple the omitted 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:43.780
 bacon cubes two tablespoons sugar and 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:49.630
 even a pinch of salt all again 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:51.490
 The finished kneading kneads with his knee 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:53.260
 dough is quite soft and leaves 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:58.209
 do not roll out 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:03:01.090
 therefore I have a simple freeze 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:05.470
 Hats taken for 1 liter and in one 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:08.890
 corner made a book and have the time 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:12.690
 Tied up and tied in to 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.690
 make small pots on the baking tray 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:21.670
 This is how the baking tray looks with the finished 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:23.560
 Treats savored injected 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:27.190
 or injected from a bag 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:30.819
 out as a second variant I have now 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:32.620
 would like to splash again 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:35.019
 let's see if he's not good too 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:39.970
 and chop small pieces if you can 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:42.700
 are ready baked and see that 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:46.290
 make a walk biscuits out but 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:50.470
 very delicious taste 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:54.430
 bacon and just delicious and who 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:58.959
 Certainly not if these are in now 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:04:02.819
 Bake oven baked 350 degrees 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:02.819
