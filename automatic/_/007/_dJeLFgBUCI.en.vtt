00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
the first thing to do is to distend them

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.329 
the first thing to do is to distend them
the<00:00:09.000> way<00:00:09.180> we<00:00:09.420> do<00:00:09.660> it<00:00:09.900> is<00:00:10.139> we<00:00:10.380> just<00:00:10.620> snip<00:00:11.160> out

00:00:11.329 --> 00:00:11.339 
the way we do it is we just snip out

00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:14.509 
the way we do it is we just snip out
with<00:00:11.730> a<00:00:11.759> pair<00:00:12.089> of<00:00:12.120> scissors<00:00:12.679> the<00:00:13.679> stem<00:00:14.190> of<00:00:14.459> the

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
pepper making sure that we do not bother

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.540 
pepper making sure that we do not bother
with<00:00:18.000> the<00:00:18.150> little<00:00:18.420> green<00:00:18.660> base<00:00:19.070> which<00:00:20.070> we<00:00:20.279> need

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
with the little green base which we need

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.150

is to put a tablespoon of salt through
the<00:02:08.280> feed<00:02:08.490> tube<00:02:08.729> as<00:02:08.910> well<00:02:09.119> and<00:02:10.340> there<00:02:11.340> it<00:02:11.460> goes

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
the feed tube as well and there it goes

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.650 
the feed tube as well and there it goes
and<00:02:12.090> then<00:02:12.930> the<00:02:13.410> very<00:02:14.280> last<00:02:14.340> thing<00:02:14.880> is<00:02:14.910> to<00:02:15.150> put

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
and then the very last thing is to put

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:16.370 
and then the very last thing is to put
some<00:02:15.930> for<00:02:16.170> men

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:41.460 
week to ferment one week later we have

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.750 
week to ferment one week later we have
our<00:02:41.790> sauce<00:02:42.120> into<00:02:42.930> our<00:02:43.320> jar<00:02:43.620> nicely<00:02:44.160> fermented

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
our sauce into our jar nicely fermented

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.330 
our sauce into our jar nicely fermented
all<00:02:45.000> that<00:02:45.420> bowl<00:02:45.720> yielded<00:02:46.320> one<00:02:46.560> jar<00:02:46.950> of<00:02:47.100> sauce

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
all that bowl yielded one jar of sauce

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.650 
all that bowl yielded one jar of sauce
we<00:02:48.210> pour<00:02:48.570> it<00:02:48.780> into<00:02:49.170> a<00:02:49.620> sieve<00:02:50.310> right<00:02:50.880> over<00:02:51.150> here

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
we pour it into a sieve right over here

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.650 
we pour it into a sieve right over here
as<00:02:51.840> you<00:02:52.020> see<00:02:52.290> and<00:02:52.670> now<00:02:53.670> it's<00:02:53.910> all<00:02:54.060> in<00:02:54.090> the<00:02:54.390> sieve

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
as you see and now it's all in the sieve

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.880 
as you see and now it's all in the sieve
and<00:02:54.930> we<00:02:55.080> start<00:02:55.560> steering<00:02:56.520> it<00:02:56.730> around<00:02:57.860> so<00:02:58.860> that

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
and we start steering it around so that

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.380 
and we start steering it around so that
the<00:02:59.730> liquids<00:03:00.270> will<00:03:00.630> flow<00:03:01.140> down<00:03:01.590> to<00:03:02.060> the<00:03:03.060> pot

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
the liquids will flow down to the pot

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.920 
the liquids will flow down to the pot
and<00:03:03.800> the<00:03:04.800> solids<00:03:05.220> will<00:03:05.400> stay<00:03:05.640> on<00:03:05.760> the<00:03:05.880> seal<00:03:06.150> we

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
and the solids will stay on the seal we

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.960 
and the solids will stay on the seal we
will<00:03:07.080> discard<00:03:07.620> the<00:03:07.890> solids<00:03:08.100> when<00:03:08.580> we're<00:03:08.760> done

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
will discard the solids when we're done

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.690 
will discard the solids when we're done
and<00:03:09.690> we<00:03:10.080> will<00:03:10.260> keep<00:03:10.470> the<00:03:10.530> valuable<00:03:11.190> liquid

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
and we will keep the valuable liquid

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.480 
and we will keep the valuable liquid
which<00:03:12.090> is<00:03:12.330> our<00:03:12.510> sauce<00:03:12.750> our<00:03:13.020> final<00:03:13.470> product<00:03:13.890> we

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:14.490 
which is our sauce our final product we

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:17.050 
which is our sauce our final product we
pour<00:03:14.790> it<00:03:14.910> using<00:03:15.270> a<00:03:15.330> funnel<00:03:15.840> into<00:03:16.110> a<00:03:16.320> bottle<00:03:16.830> and

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
pour it using a funnel into a bottle and

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.330 
pour it using a funnel into a bottle and
there<00:03:18.060> we<00:03:18.300> have<00:03:18.540> it<00:03:18.780> that<00:03:18.990> is<00:03:19.290> our<00:03:19.620> sauce<00:03:19.950> our

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
there we have it that is our sauce our

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.420 
there we have it that is our sauce our
rich<00:03:20.670> hot<00:03:21.030> sauce
