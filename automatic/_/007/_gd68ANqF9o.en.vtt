00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:31.760 
nutrients which we should be using for

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.700 
nutrients which we should be using for
ourselves<00:00:31.970> so<00:00:32.480> garlic<00:00:33.260> is<00:00:33.350> actually<00:00:33.559> one<00:00:33.649> of

ourselves so garlic is actually one of

ourselves so garlic is actually one of
the<00:00:33.800> most<00:00:33.920> powerful<00:00:34.100> ways<00:00:34.520> of<00:00:34.730> getting<00:00:35.210> those

the most powerful ways of getting those

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.510 
the most powerful ways of getting those
organisms<00:00:35.780> out<00:00:36.200> of<00:00:36.559> literally<00:00:36.890> killing<00:00:37.219> them

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:37.520 
organisms out of literally killing them

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.580 
organisms out of literally killing them
the<00:00:38.090> only<00:00:38.239> issue<00:00:38.510> of<00:00:38.719> that<00:00:38.870> is<00:00:38.989> to<00:00:39.110> have<00:00:39.260> enough

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:39.590 
the only issue of that is to have enough

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:42.100 
the only issue of that is to have enough
fresh<00:00:40.190> garlic<00:00:40.879> first<00:00:41.270> of<00:00:41.420> all<00:00:41.480> isn't<00:00:41.570> tasted

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:46.460 
good right second of all it can make

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.180 
good right second of all it can make
your<00:00:46.610> body<00:00:46.730> odor<00:00:47.390> or<00:00:47.899> your<00:00:48.140> breath<00:00:48.350> smell<00:00:48.890> when

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:50.840 
that puts a lot of people off so that's

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.540 
that puts a lot of people off so that's

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
you know totally aware of this the

you know totally aware of this the
ancient<00:01:20.540> Taoist<00:01:20.630> was<00:01:20.869> highly<00:01:21.140> aware<00:01:21.320> of<00:01:21.439> this

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
ancient Taoist was highly aware of this

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.100 
ancient Taoist was highly aware of this
and<00:01:21.799> they<00:01:22.460> used<00:01:22.850> to<00:01:23.000> do<00:01:23.270> something<00:01:23.720> called

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
and they used to do something called

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.560 
and they used to do something called
aging<00:01:24.890> to<00:01:25.130> the<00:01:25.220> garlic<00:01:25.670> and<00:01:26.060> what<00:01:26.299> that<00:01:26.479> would

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:26.570 
aging to the garlic and what that would

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.289 
aging to the garlic and what that would
mean<00:01:26.630> is<00:01:27.020> that<00:01:27.049> it<00:01:27.890> would<00:01:28.040> lose<00:01:28.280> its<00:01:28.310> taste<00:01:28.640> it

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:29.299 
mean is that it would lose its taste it

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:31.780 
mean is that it would lose its taste it
will<00:01:29.540> lose<00:01:29.750> its<00:01:29.960> tendency<00:01:30.860> to<00:01:30.979> create<00:01:31.369> body

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:31.790 
will lose its tendency to create body

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:34.090 
will lose its tendency to create body
odor<00:01:32.030> and<00:01:32.150> even<00:01:32.689> better<00:01:32.900> it<00:01:33.200> would<00:01:33.259> stop<00:01:33.829> that

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
odor and even better it would stop that

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.370 
odor and even better it would stop that
tendency<00:01:34.700> to<00:01:34.880> imbalance<00:01:35.720> the<00:01:35.840> hemispheres<00:01:36.320> of

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
tendency to imbalance the hemispheres of

tendency to imbalance the hemispheres of
the<00:01:36.439> brain<00:01:36.500> which<00:01:37.189> is<00:01:37.340> what<00:01:37.520> long<00:01:38.000> term<00:01:38.030> use<00:01:38.390> of

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
the brain which is what long term use of
