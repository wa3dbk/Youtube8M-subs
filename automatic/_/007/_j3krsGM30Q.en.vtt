00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.219 
has said before that he sees each camera
as<00:01:29.520> a<00:01:29.549> piece<00:01:29.970> of<00:01:30.119> artwork<00:01:30.329> in<00:01:30.600> itself<00:01:30.720> and

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
as a piece of artwork in itself and

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.200 
as a piece of artwork in itself and
whenever<00:01:31.740> he<00:01:32.009> designs<00:01:32.369> these<00:01:32.640> things<00:01:32.909> to<00:01:33.090> go

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
whenever he designs these things to go

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.760 
whenever he designs these things to go
with<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.390> camera<00:01:33.750> he<00:01:34.140> doesn't<00:01:34.439> want<00:01:34.560> anything

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
with the camera he doesn't want anything

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.800 
with the camera he doesn't want anything
to<00:01:35.159> take<00:01:35.400> away<00:01:35.729> from<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.329> design<00:01:36.600> of<00:01:36.720> the

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
to take away from the design of the

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.539 
to take away from the design of the
camera<00:01:37.140> itself<00:01:37.409> and<00:01:37.770> you<00:01:37.890> can<00:01:38.040> see<00:01:38.220> that<00:01:38.369> with

camera itself and you can see that with

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.999 
camera itself and you can see that with
Joel's<00:01:38.759> work<00:01:39.140> even<00:01:40.140> though<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.439> straps<00:01:40.740> and

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
Joel's work even though the straps and

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.710 
Joel's work even though the straps and
all<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.280> other<00:01:41.430> accessories<00:01:41.700> he<00:01:42.119> makes<00:01:42.360> it

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
all the other accessories he makes it

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.749 
all the other accessories he makes it
all<00:01:42.930> looks<00:01:43.229> really<00:01:43.409> good<00:01:43.770> but<00:01:43.829> it's<00:01:44.369> nothing

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
all looks really good but it's nothing

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.359 
all looks really good but it's nothing
flashy<00:01:45.229> it's<00:01:46.229> a<00:01:46.350> nice<00:01:46.530> compliment<00:01:47.159> to<00:01:47.220> the

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
flashy it's a nice compliment to the

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.789 
flashy it's a nice compliment to the
camera<00:01:47.759> and<00:01:47.939> it's<00:01:48.659> all<00:01:48.840> made<00:01:49.049> extremely<00:01:49.439> well

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
camera and it's all made extremely well

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.219 
camera and it's all made extremely well
so<00:01:50.070> even<00:01:50.520> though<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:51.240> idea<00:01:51.570> of<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:51.780> strap<00:01:52.020> is

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
so even though the idea of the strap is

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.929 
so even though the idea of the strap is
more<00:01:52.439> about<00:01:52.619> function<00:01:53.130> it<00:01:53.280> does<00:01:53.610> have<00:01:53.909> a

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
more about function it does have a

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.910 
more about function it does have a
really<00:01:54.270> good<00:01:54.509> look<00:01:54.720> to<00:01:54.899> it<00:01:54.930> for<00:01:55.409> me<00:01:55.530> all<00:01:55.740> the

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
really good look to it for me all the

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.319 
really good look to it for me all the
straps<00:01:56.130> that<00:01:56.340> I've<00:01:56.460> used<00:01:56.759> I<00:01:56.939> don't<00:01:57.149> really

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
straps that I've used I don't really

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.539 
straps that I've used I don't really
like<00:01:57.540> bulky<00:01:57.990> straps<00:01:58.320> and<00:01:58.979> usually<00:01:59.369> I<00:01:59.399> don't

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
like bulky straps and usually I don't

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.090 
like bulky straps and usually I don't
like<00:01:59.790> a<00:01:59.820> strap<00:02:00.180> with<00:02:00.420> a<00:02:00.450> neck<00:02:00.750> pad<00:02:00.960> and<00:02:01.229> Joel

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
like a strap with a neck pad and Joel

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.889

a<00:02:04.049> lot<00:02:04.200> of<00:02:04.259> photographers<00:02:04.680> really<00:02:04.950> prefer

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
a lot of photographers really prefer

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.130 
a lot of photographers really prefer
that<00:02:05.250> but<00:02:05.969> for<00:02:06.180> me<00:02:06.329> I<00:02:06.360> don't<00:02:06.570> really<00:02:06.780> like<00:02:07.110> that

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
that but for me I don't really like that

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.830 
that but for me I don't really like that
because<00:02:07.680> I<00:02:07.710> like<00:02:08.039> to<00:02:08.310> be<00:02:09.209> able<00:02:09.300> to<00:02:09.420> have<00:02:09.599> a<00:02:09.629> few

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
normal strap would be made you know what

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.690 
normal strap would be made you know what
it's<00:02:31.660> used<00:02:31.840> for<00:02:31.930> and<00:02:32.320> that's<00:02:32.890> comfortable<00:02:33.460> but

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
it's used for and that's comfortable but

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.250 
it's used for and that's comfortable but
at<00:02:33.730> the<00:02:33.850> same<00:02:34.000> time<00:02:34.270> these<00:02:34.510> are<00:02:34.690> adjustable

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
at the same time these are adjustable

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.530 
at the same time these are adjustable
lengths<00:02:35.620> so<00:02:36.100> I<00:02:36.130> can<00:02:36.550> kind<00:02:36.790> of<00:02:36.850> fine-tune<00:02:37.360> that

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
lengths so I can kind of fine-tune that

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.060 
lengths so I can kind of fine-tune that
because<00:02:37.900> I<00:02:37.930> also<00:02:38.200> like<00:02:38.320> to<00:02:38.470> wear<00:02:38.650> the<00:02:38.830> strap

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
I use my strap a few different ways and

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:53.820 
I use my strap a few different ways and
that's<00:02:52.720> one<00:02:52.930> of<00:02:52.960> the<00:02:53.080> really<00:02:53.320> nice<00:02:53.500> things

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
that's one of the really nice things

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:55.710 
that's one of the really nice things
about<00:02:53.950> the<00:02:54.250> adjustable<00:02:54.730> length<00:02:54.970> on<00:02:55.240> these<00:02:55.420> and

about the adjustable length on these and

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.380 
about the adjustable length on these and

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.630 
I believe it ranges from 57 inches to 38
inches<00:02:58.600> and<00:02:59.050> I've<00:02:59.890> had<00:03:00.160> a<00:03:00.190> lot<00:03:00.400> of<00:03:00.430> different

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
inches and I've had a lot of different

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.970 
inches and I've had a lot of different
straps<00:03:01.000> that<00:03:01.210> are<00:03:01.330> fixed<00:03:01.540> length<00:03:01.900> and<00:03:02.170> it

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
straps that are fixed length and it

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.910 
straps that are fixed length and it
works<00:03:03.400> good<00:03:03.670> usually<00:03:04.180> a<00:03:04.210> certain<00:03:04.690> way<00:03:04.920> but

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
works good usually a certain way but

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.920 
works good usually a certain way but
being<00:03:06.190> able<00:03:06.310> to<00:03:06.460> kind<00:03:06.880> of<00:03:06.970> fine-tune<00:03:07.180> that<00:03:07.600> to

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
being able to kind of fine-tune that to

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.930 
being able to kind of fine-tune that to
you<00:03:08.200> know<00:03:08.290> each<00:03:08.500> person<00:03:08.770> I<00:03:09.160> think<00:03:09.580> is<00:03:09.640> a<00:03:09.670> big

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:12.490 
deal and even though the strap is

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:14.760 
deal and even though the strap is
adjustable<00:03:12.670> it<00:03:13.360> doesn't<00:03:13.780> add<00:03:14.290> a<00:03:14.320> bunch<00:03:14.650> of

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:14.770
