D string goes up to the fourth fret of
the<00:01:08.740> D<00:01:09.100> strings<00:01:09.460> you've<00:01:09.700> got<00:01:09.880> this<00:01:10.090> and<00:01:12.180> it<00:01:13.180> was

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:13.300 
the D strings you've got this and it was

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.120 
the D strings you've got this and it was
right<00:01:13.630> down<00:01:13.660> to<00:01:14.080> the<00:01:14.170> low<00:01:14.350> E<00:01:14.620> which<00:01:14.770> is<00:01:14.800> now<00:01:15.070> two

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.130 
right down to the low E which is now two

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.870 
right down to the low E which is now two
into<00:01:15.520> a<00:01:15.550> D<00:01:15.850> and<00:01:16.120> you<00:01:16.930> walk<00:01:17.140> it<00:01:17.350> up<00:01:17.530> from<00:01:17.770> one<00:01:18.010> to

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
into a D and you walk it up from one to

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:28.290 
into a D and you walk it up from one to
three<00:01:19.230> to<00:01:20.230> four<00:01:20.560> and<00:01:21.030> five<00:01:26.820> that's<00:01:27.820> the<00:01:28.060> riff

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:28.300 
three to four and five that's the riff

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.380 
three to four and five that's the riff
now<00:01:28.540> it<00:01:28.660> pushes<00:01:29.110> push<00:01:29.740> beat<00:01:30.010> is<00:01:30.220> a<00:01:30.250> what<00:01:31.240> would

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390 
now it pushes push beat is a what would

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.859 
now it pushes push beat is a what would
be<00:01:31.570> a<00:01:32.290> four<00:01:33.130> and<00:01:33.460> in<00:01:34.300> your<00:01:34.420> counts<00:01:34.780> you're

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:34.869 
be a four and in your counts you're

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:37.050 
be a four and in your counts you're
going<00:01:35.050> one<00:01:35.260> and<00:01:35.500> two<00:01:35.740> and<00:01:36.010> three<00:01:36.040> and<00:01:36.520> four<00:01:36.670> and

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060 
going one and two and three and four and

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:38.790 
going one and two and three and four and
so<00:01:37.540> the<00:01:37.690> becomes<00:01:38.140> just<00:01:38.290> a<00:01:38.380> little<00:01:38.560> bit<00:01:38.650> before

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:38.800 
so the becomes just a little bit before

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:54.760 
so the becomes just a little bit before
the<00:01:39.100> one<00:01:39.310> like<00:01:39.970> this<00:01:40.150> one<00:01:40.479> two<00:01:40.930> three<00:01:41.500> four

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.750 

so<00:01:56.630> that's<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:58.290> riff<00:01:58.530> for<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.070> song<00:01:59.310> it's<00:01:59.670> a

00:01:59.750 --> 00:01:59.760 
so that's the riff for the song it's a

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.460 
so that's the riff for the song it's a
terrific<00:02:00.000> riff<00:02:00.390> they<00:02:00.660> play<00:02:00.870> it<00:02:00.930> the<00:02:01.140> entire

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:01.470 
terrific riff they play it the entire

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:03.800
