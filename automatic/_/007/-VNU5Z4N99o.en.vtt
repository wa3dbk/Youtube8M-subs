00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.770
The water is so good

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:07.050
Your so yucky sis

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:07.740
What are you doing?

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:10.570
The water is really good, try it

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:11.310
Sister

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.900
Are you enjoying the camp too?

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.730
Yes dear, why? Are you not enjoying?

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:16.820
Of course I do

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:18.750
But, it's our last night

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.510
I hope this night will be fun, right?

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:22.470
Even though it's our last.

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:23.130
Exactly

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.050
and, I wish, something memorable would happen

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:28.260
that we'll enjoy every bit.

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:29.020
Yes, I hope so

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:32.570
Whatever. We'll do everything to make our last sleep memorable

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:33.610
I agree

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.910
we should do that, so our camp this year

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:38.450
is unforgettable.

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:40.480
We're in this together.

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:43.180
Definitely! *girl giggles*

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.520
So, are we staying here longer?

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:48.840
*girl yawns*

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:53.970
Sister

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.090
I'm sleepy, let's sleep already.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.190
Haiii... Sister, I'm really sleepy.

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:10.580
Let's get inside the tent.

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:17.990
What kind of tent is this?

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.320
Can we even fall asleep with this?

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.580
Haiii... whatever, I'm too sleepy.

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:23.350
Good night.

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:24.920
Okay, good night.

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:55.850
Hey sister

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.540
Sister,  I think there's a man outside our tent.

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:01.070
There's no one there, silly.

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:03.860
Sis, yes there is.

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.470
Just don't mind it, let's just sleep.

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:12.330
Oh my, sis it's here! It's here!

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.060
I'm scared.

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.820
Just don't mind it, there's no one there! No one!

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.180
Ahay..

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.600
Ouch

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:59.980
What?! It's already morning.

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.580
Maryfel!

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.480
Maryfel, Maryfel!

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.340
Oh, yes sis it's really morning

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:12.820
What happened last night?

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:14.730
Nothing. Nothing.

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.310
Maybe it was all my imagination.

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:18.940
It was all nothing.

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:20.270
Please, just tell me.

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:22.590
There was really something. Really.

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:27.650
Why are you all surprised?

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:29.390
I'm beautiful.

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:30.000
Anyway,

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:32.010
Did you know about last night

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:33.820
Just don't be scared, okay.

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:35.970
What about last night?

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.300
I saw a man wearing barong.

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.150
He got near you tent.

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.050
And then,

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:45.350
he walked across both of you.
