00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:15.269
 past Eva Kersting 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.070
 her parents of children 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.130
 oberliga-climber 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:21.339
 participation in 4 4 degrees 

00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:25.499
 the show as usual in red from left to right forward Wacker in 

00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:27.039
 this future 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:31.750
 the match characterized from the beginning by short pass combination b1 lamented the picture 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:34.750
 he pushes rather behavior with less possession 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:40.130
 here once a free kick variant 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:44.520
 with a first warning shot to the address of barca-keeper table food 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:50.830
 on the other hand, ITER attacks then say what they do 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.640
 Rip-off takes the ball 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.600
 Now that's another way 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.700
 but the ball Leticia the VG Bad Heviz Lopez probably with flip-flops 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.160
 the team of coaches with the trouble at this stage just more aggressive 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:10.200
 more passionate with much more courage thereupon rose a counter opinion we 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.509
 need chassis 

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:12.530
 but the Briton 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.770
 Kolat passed the post 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.140
 The leadership fell long ago superfluous football Wacker Schibli 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.140
 leaning 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.640
 DDV had the game under control as thieves also had some time for the bag of tricks 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:31.790
 Watch out here CÃ³rdoba 4 a circus 3 missed developers though 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:34.240
 as fast as he stumbles 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.780
 Forward Captain Concept could push his guys again, too 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:40.720
 that as nothing 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.020
 GDV continues with so-called 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.960
 Ruge with the long ball 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.869
 the Basler Defense Ten complete the small kitchen he puts on the spot 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.659
 in Libya the RAF the man she offers death 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.890
 1 2 0 Feed 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.640
 35 wants to play and at this time the leadership 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.480
 you have to say that very clearly 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:04.480
 zol com to the report 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.679
 and the little poison dwarf with the number 13 of Idi VfB now really up 

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:12.540
 so supported 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.869
 for the PKV must again 

00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:16.380
 there is drawing back to India 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:17.999
 since it came 

00:02:17.999 --> 00:02:21.489
 off in this situation correctly recognized by the impartial 

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:27.139
 second half forward Wacker suddenly agile the Billstedter 

00:02:27.139 --> 00:02:30.139
 acted much more with long balls in the top 

00:02:30.939 --> 00:02:33.219
 the shot of Ivo coffin 

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:35.719
 a little life sign 

00:02:35.719 --> 00:02:39.399
 Slowly it became a cup fight forward Wacker tries it now 

00:02:39.399 --> 00:02:42.399
 Standards for the time 

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:48.269
 the free kick by Treutler is only very close 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:50.739
 past friend and foe 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:54.290
 a few minutes later, the forward captain tries again 

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:01.999
 but all the praise is in the box of the Antarctic in the post 

00:03:03.969 --> 00:03:10.439
 in the following years not much happened he grabbed cup winner 2011 1 gg Vm 

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:13.439
 the KWA celebrated 

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:34.869
 SZ 

00:03:34.869 --> 00:03:37.669
 means so much to me 

00:03:37.669 --> 00:03:40.669
 was re-elected 

00:04:05.789 --> 00:04:07.969
