be a kind of a cool idea a good business

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.850 
be a kind of a cool idea a good business
to<00:01:06.060> get<00:01:06.270> into<00:01:06.330> so<00:01:06.750> we<00:01:06.840> did<00:01:06.960> some<00:01:06.990> research<00:01:07.320> on

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
to get into so we did some research on

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.530 
to get into so we did some research on
the<00:01:08.250> industry<00:01:08.400> and<00:01:08.760> found<00:01:09.000> it<00:01:09.090> was<00:01:09.180> actually<00:01:09.510> a

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
the industry and found it was actually a

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.450 
the industry and found it was actually a
viable<00:01:09.960> market<00:01:10.140> to<00:01:10.380> get<00:01:10.500> into<00:01:10.799> and<00:01:11.010> decided

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
viable market to get into and decided

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.520 
viable market to get into and decided
maybe<00:01:12.270> throw<00:01:12.540> a<00:01:12.570> little<00:01:12.720> bit<00:01:12.869> of<00:01:12.900> a<00:01:12.990> twist<00:01:13.229> at

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
maybe throw a little bit of a twist at

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.830 
maybe throw a little bit of a twist at
it<00:01:13.710> at<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.400> idea<00:01:14.670> and<00:01:15.030> came<00:01:15.479> up<00:01:15.600> with<00:01:15.659> this

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
it at the idea and came up with this

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.960 
it at the idea and came up with this
doing<00:01:16.380> it<00:01:16.439> in<00:01:16.500> a<00:01:16.560> double<00:01:16.860> decker<00:01:17.009> bus<00:01:17.189> well<00:01:17.850> we

right one it was really bad shape so we

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.990 
right one it was really bad shape so we
went<00:01:34.110> out<00:01:34.259> to<00:01:34.380> Missouri<00:01:34.710> and<00:01:34.950> bought<00:01:35.820> it
