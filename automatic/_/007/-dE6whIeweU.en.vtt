00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
ROM now first of all what you see is the

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.800 
ROM now first of all what you see is the
lockscreen<00:00:28.859> which<00:00:29.220> is<00:00:29.369> similar<00:00:29.789> to<00:00:29.820> a<00:00:30.090> USP<00:00:30.660> now

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
lockscreen which is similar to a USP now

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.270 
lockscreen which is similar to a USP now
this<00:00:31.289> one<00:00:31.560> is<00:00:31.800> a<00:00:32.189> USP<00:00:33.030> but<00:00:33.390> it<00:00:33.870> is<00:00:34.020> not<00:00:34.350> a<00:00:34.680> USP<00:00:35.070> as

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
this one is a USP but it is not a USP as

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.049 
this one is a USP but it is not a USP as
in<00:00:35.520> a<00:00:35.670> super<00:00:36.000> Nexus<00:00:37.100> context<00:00:38.100> this<00:00:38.790> is

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
in a super Nexus context this is

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.500 
in a super Nexus context this is
actually<00:00:39.600> compile<00:00:40.379> recompile<00:00:41.160> from<00:00:41.670> slim<00:00:42.239> cam

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
actually compile recompile from slim cam

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.229 
actually compile recompile from slim cam
repository<00:00:43.110> so<00:00:43.770> that<00:00:44.309> means<00:00:44.550> it<00:00:44.730> will<00:00:44.910> have<00:00:45.210> a

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
repository so that means it will have a

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.590 
repository so that means it will have a
lot<00:00:45.510> of<00:00:45.539> slim<00:00:45.960> slim<00:00:46.920> CAD<00:00:47.160> features<00:00:47.579> so<00:00:48.570> let's

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
lot of slim slim CAD features so let's

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.100

2<00:01:06.360> beta<00:01:06.780> 2<00:01:07.140> point<00:01:07.500> 1<00:01:07.590> so<00:01:08.010> it's<00:01:08.159> version<00:01:08.640> 2.1<00:01:09.240> so

2 beta 2 point 1 so it's version 2.1 so

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:15.410 
2 beta 2 point 1 so it's version 2.1 so
yes<00:01:11.390> this<00:01:12.650> while<00:01:13.650> using<00:01:13.979> this<00:01:14.340> I<00:01:14.549> feel<00:01:15.090> that

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
yes this while using this I feel that

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.539 
yes this while using this I feel that
this<00:01:15.600> might<00:01:15.960> as<00:01:16.170> well<00:01:16.380> been<00:01:16.680> called<00:01:17.310> the

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
this might as well been called the

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.350 
this might as well been called the
unofficial<00:01:18.030> slim<00:01:18.600> cat<00:01:18.869> form<00:01:19.110> because<00:01:19.350> it<00:01:19.740> is

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
unofficial slim cat form because it is

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.390 
unofficial slim cat form because it is
entirely<00:01:21.360> derived<00:01:21.840> from<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.320> slim<00:01:22.560> cat<00:01:22.770> ROM

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
entirely derived from the slim cat ROM

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.590 
entirely derived from the slim cat ROM
so<00:01:23.729> yeah<00:01:24.360> it<00:01:24.450> could<00:01:24.630> have<00:01:24.689> been<00:01:25.020> set<00:01:25.380> as<00:01:25.590> the

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
so yeah it could have been set as the

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.050 
so yeah it could have been set as the
unofficial<00:01:27.600> slim<00:01:28.200> cat<00:01:28.439> so<00:01:28.920> it<00:01:29.400> does<00:01:29.610> have<00:01:29.820> slim

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
unofficial slim cat so it does have slim

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.560 
unofficial slim cat so it does have slim
Center<00:01:30.509> and<00:01:30.750> it<00:01:31.320> does<00:01:31.560> have<00:01:31.860> all<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.670> OTA

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
Center and it does have all the OTA

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.330 
Center and it does have all the OTA
settings<00:01:34.020> but<00:01:34.259> this<00:01:34.619> won't<00:01:34.829> really<00:01:35.040> work

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
settings but this won't really work

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.810 
settings but this won't really work
because<00:01:36.240> well<00:01:36.720> it's<00:01:36.900> not<00:01:37.140> a<00:01:37.200> real<00:01:37.380> slim<00:01:37.920> cat<00:01:38.159> it

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
because well it's not a real slim cat it

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.280 
because well it's not a real slim cat it
does<00:01:39.000> have<00:01:39.180> slim<00:01:39.450> sensor<00:01:39.810> which<00:01:39.990> is<00:01:40.110> one<00:01:40.259> of

instability issues so yeah let's get you

00:01:56.689 --> 00:01:59.090 
instability issues so yeah let's get you
interfacing<00:01:57.689> so<00:01:57.930> interface<00:01:58.290> it<00:01:58.439> has<00:01:58.680> battery

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
interfacing so interface it has battery

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.789 
interfacing so interface it has battery
icon<00:01:59.219> it<00:01:59.909> you<00:02:00.390> can<00:02:00.570> change<00:02:00.899> the<00:02:01.079> battery<00:02:01.439> in

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
icon it you can change the battery in

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.950 
icon it you can change the battery in
all<00:02:02.369> of<00:02:02.520> these<00:02:02.729> ways<00:02:02.969> you<00:02:03.299> can<00:02:03.479> change<00:02:03.750> the

quick setting is enabled in this one so
then<00:02:20.799> that<00:02:21.099> means<00:02:21.280> that<00:02:21.640> the<00:02:22.329> quick<00:02:22.689> setting

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
then that means that the quick setting

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:25.170 
then that means that the quick setting
is<00:02:23.170> kinda<00:02:23.650> Slee<00:02:23.769> if<00:02:23.890> you<00:02:24.010> have<00:02:24.189> used<00:02:24.459> domestics

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
is kinda Slee if you have used domestics

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.839 
is kinda Slee if you have used domestics
wrong<00:02:25.450> the<00:02:26.230> tamasic<00:02:26.560> strong<00:02:26.950> actually<00:02:27.519> uses

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:27.849 
wrong the tamasic strong actually uses

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:29.550 
wrong the tamasic strong actually uses
this<00:02:28.090> one<00:02:28.390> so<00:02:28.719> it's<00:02:28.959> not<00:02:29.140> the<00:02:29.319> other<00:02:29.379> way

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
this one so it's not the other way

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:30.059 
this one so it's not the other way
around

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:30.069 
around

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:35.160

them are different so yeah these are the

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:43.190 
them are different so yeah these are the
options<00:02:38.739> which<00:02:38.920> are<00:02:39.069> available<00:02:39.129> in<00:02:40.230> slim<00:02:41.230> cats

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
options which are available in slim cats

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.929 
options which are available in slim cats
title<00:02:44.200> layout<00:02:44.469> setting<00:02:44.859> so<00:02:45.129> yeah<00:02:45.549> it<00:02:45.790> does

have style so you that is one of the
best<00:02:48.099> one<00:02:48.670> of<00:02:48.700> the<00:02:49.079> advantages<00:02:50.079> of<00:02:50.230> using<00:02:50.290> this

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
best one of the advantages of using this

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:53.099 
best one of the advantages of using this
one<00:02:50.980> so<00:02:51.819> you<00:02:51.879> can<00:02:52.150> change<00:02:52.389> the<00:02:52.659> tile<00:02:52.900> layout

00:02:55.649 --> 00:02:55.659 
and number of times per row so that's

00:02:55.659 --> 00:02:57.089 
and number of times per row so that's
pretty<00:02:55.900> cool

00:02:57.089 --> 00:02:57.099 
pretty cool

00:02:57.099 --> 00:02:59.580

00:03:17.339 --> 00:03:17.349 
the slim real slim talk okay this one is

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:20.159 
the slim real slim talk okay this one is
available<00:03:17.530> which<00:03:18.040> changes<00:03:18.790> the<00:03:19.030> web<00:03:19.299> to<00:03:19.599> dark

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:20.169 
available which changes the web to dark

00:03:20.169 --> 00:03:26.039 
available which changes the web to dark
thing<00:03:21.010> so<00:03:21.519> this<00:03:22.090> one<00:03:22.359> is<00:03:22.690> more<00:03:24.090> useful<00:03:25.090> than<00:03:25.389> a

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:26.049 
thing so this one is more useful than a

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:27.899 
thing so this one is more useful than a
lot<00:03:26.470> of<00:03:26.500> the<00:03:26.739> other<00:03:26.859> ones<00:03:27.190> a<00:03:27.400> lot<00:03:27.549> of<00:03:27.699> the<00:03:27.790> other

00:03:27.899 --> 00:03:27.909 
lot of the other ones a lot of the other

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:30.140 
lot of the other ones a lot of the other
rooms<00:03:28.180> just<00:03:28.389> have<00:03:28.900> this<00:03:29.079> implementation<00:03:29.739> but

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
rooms just have this implementation but

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.530 
rooms just have this implementation but
from<00:03:31.150> what<00:03:31.510> I<00:03:31.540> have<00:03:31.989> known<00:03:32.459> this<00:03:33.459> one<00:03:33.849> really

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
from what I have known this one really

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.809 
from what I have known this one really
really<00:03:34.840> changes<00:03:35.379> everything<00:03:35.769> to<00:03:36.099> dark<00:03:36.430> so

00:03:36.809 --> 00:03:36.819 
really changes everything to dark so

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:39.059 
really changes everything to dark so
that's<00:03:37.000> pretty<00:03:37.209> cool<00:03:37.680> most<00:03:38.680> of<00:03:38.829> the<00:03:38.919> features

00:03:39.059 --> 00:03:39.069 
that's pretty cool most of the features

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:41.039 
that's pretty cool most of the features
are<00:03:39.370> similar<00:03:39.519> to<00:03:39.879> whatever<00:03:40.060> you<00:03:40.359> expect<00:03:40.870> from

00:04:24.839 --> 00:04:24.849 
stock options of the other roms so it

00:04:24.849 --> 00:04:27.200 
stock options of the other roms so it
does<00:04:25.029> have<00:04:25.270> a<00:04:25.330> clearer<00:04:26.320> view

from<00:04:34.050> here<00:04:34.440> so<00:04:34.710> you<00:04:35.160> can<00:04:35.340> even<00:04:35.490> change<00:04:35.729> the

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940 
from here so you can even change the

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:39.590 
from here so you can even change the
focus<00:04:36.300> mode<00:04:36.509> to<00:04:36.810> fixed<00:04:37.229> or<00:04:38.120> whatever<00:04:39.120> so

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 
focus mode to fixed or whatever so

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.540 
focus mode to fixed or whatever so
that's<00:04:39.840> pretty<00:04:40.080> cool<00:04:40.289> it<00:04:40.470> that<00:04:40.500> it<00:04:40.800> is<00:04:41.009> a<00:04:41.039> more

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550 
that's pretty cool it that it is a more

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:43.520 
that's pretty cool it that it is a more
of<00:04:41.789> a<00:04:41.970> I<00:04:42.300> would<00:04:42.810> say<00:04:42.960> it<00:04:43.050> is<00:04:43.169> a<00:04:43.199> better

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:43.530 
of a I would say it is a better

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:45.860 
of a I would say it is a better
implementation<00:04:44.490> than<00:04:44.820> most<00:04:45.270> of<00:04:45.479> the<00:04:45.570> warms

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 
implementation than most of the warms

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:49.580 
implementation than most of the warms
but<00:04:46.320> you<00:04:46.470> can<00:04:46.740> change<00:04:47.070> it<00:04:47.340> in<00:04:47.910> the<00:04:47.940> forum<00:04:48.590> there

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
but you can change it in the forum there

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:52.909 
but you can change it in the forum there
is<00:04:49.620> an<00:04:49.979> option<00:04:50.340> to<00:04:50.460> change<00:04:50.729> the<00:04:50.940> camera<00:04:51.570> apk<00:04:52.320> so

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:52.919 
is an option to change the camera apk so

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:54.680 
is an option to change the camera apk so
that<00:04:53.250> is<00:04:53.520> it<00:04:53.789> let<00:04:54.300> me<00:04:54.330> show<00:04:54.479> you<00:04:54.570> guys<00:04:54.600> the

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:54.690 
that is it let me show you guys the

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:57.290 
that is it let me show you guys the
enter<00:04:55.199> to<00:04:55.320> benchmark<00:04:55.770> scores<00:04:56.070> which<00:04:56.400> is<00:04:56.580> well

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:57.300 
enter to benchmark scores which is well

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.629 
enter to benchmark scores which is well
again<00:04:57.870> it<00:04:58.110> is<00:04:58.380> similar<00:04:59.130> to<00:04:59.280> what<00:04:59.400> you<00:04:59.520> would

00:04:59.629 --> 00:04:59.639 
again it is similar to what you would

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:03.230 
again it is similar to what you would
expect<00:04:59.970> this<00:05:00.150> 18<00:05:00.509> 876<00:05:01.320> which<00:05:01.949> is<00:05:02.099> pretty<00:05:02.370> cool

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:03.240 
expect this 18 876 which is pretty cool

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.680 
expect this 18 876 which is pretty cool
all<00:05:03.780> the<00:05:04.080> roms<00:05:04.410> now<00:05:04.560> I<00:05:04.919> believe<00:05:05.280> is<00:05:05.550> having<00:05:06.509> a

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:06.690 
all the roms now I believe is having a

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:11.300 
all the roms now I believe is having a
bit<00:05:07.139> of<00:05:07.320> the<00:05:07.830> similar<00:05:08.280> kind<00:05:08.639> of<00:05:08.970> a<00:05:10.070> score<00:05:11.070> so

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:11.310 
bit of the similar kind of a score so

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:15.350 
bit of the similar kind of a score so
I'm<00:05:12.300> not<00:05:12.479> even<00:05:12.539> feeling<00:05:13.400> the<00:05:14.400> need<00:05:14.639> to<00:05:14.940> show

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:15.360 
I'm not even feeling the need to show

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.140 
I'm not even feeling the need to show
this<00:05:15.570> one<00:05:15.930> because<00:05:16.349> it's<00:05:17.130> similar<00:05:17.430> every<00:05:17.970> ROM

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:18.150 
this one because it's similar every ROM

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:20.960 
this one because it's similar every ROM
has<00:05:18.419> the<00:05:18.660> same<00:05:18.900> amount<00:05:19.770> of<00:05:19.860> score<00:05:20.190> it's<00:05:20.759> all

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:20.970 
has the same amount of score it's all

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:21.439 
has the same amount of score it's all
fast

00:05:21.439 --> 00:05:21.449 
fast

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:24.800 
fast
I<00:05:21.930> believe<00:05:22.620> the<00:05:22.830> AOSP<00:05:23.639> and<00:05:24.060> the<00:05:24.360> stock<00:05:24.599> rom

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:24.810 
I believe the AOSP and the stock rom

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:27.290 
I believe the AOSP and the stock rom
have<00:05:25.169> the<00:05:25.380> only<00:05:25.590> difference<00:05:25.949> now<00:05:26.039> is<00:05:26.460> the<00:05:27.030> RAM

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:27.300 
have the only difference now is the RAM

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:30.409 
have the only difference now is the RAM
usage<00:05:27.539> this<00:05:28.050> one<00:05:28.289> is<00:05:28.800> considerably<00:05:29.550> less<00:05:29.910> ram

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:30.419 
usage this one is considerably less ram

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:33.830 
usage this one is considerably less ram
using<00:05:31.139> and<00:05:31.740> then<00:05:31.949> the<00:05:32.130> stock<00:05:32.400> rom<00:05:32.639> so<00:05:32.849> yeah<00:05:33.180> let

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:33.840 
using and then the stock rom so yeah let

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:35.210 
using and then the stock rom so yeah let
me<00:05:33.870> show<00:05:34.020> you<00:05:34.110> guys<00:05:34.139> the<00:05:34.260> boot<00:05:34.650> animation

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:35.220 
me show you guys the boot animation

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:41.570 
me show you guys the boot animation
which<00:05:35.400> is<00:05:35.520> pretty<00:05:35.729> cool<00:05:39.770> so<00:05:40.770> here<00:05:41.010> is<00:05:41.190> the<00:05:41.370> boot

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:41.580 
which is pretty cool so here is the boot

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:44.510 
which is pretty cool so here is the boot
animation<00:05:42.120> for<00:05:42.360> neat<00:05:42.780> ROM<00:05:43.080> by<00:05:43.560> Co<00:05:43.830> ok<00:05:44.220> you<00:05:44.280> can

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:44.520 
animation for neat ROM by Co ok you can

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:46.909 
animation for neat ROM by Co ok you can
see<00:05:44.760> the<00:05:44.940> meat<00:05:45.210> lover<00:05:45.930> with<00:05:46.169> Samsung<00:05:46.620> Galaxy

00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:46.919 
see the meat lover with Samsung Galaxy

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:50.029 
see the meat lover with Samsung Galaxy
s3<00:05:47.099> and<00:05:48.030> are<00:05:48.419> rotating<00:05:48.960> halos<00:05:49.409> around<00:05:49.440> the

00:05:50.029 --> 00:05:50.039 
s3 and are rotating halos around the

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:51.290 
s3 and are rotating halos around the
logo<00:05:50.220> so<00:05:50.400> that's<00:05:50.699> really<00:05:50.849> cool

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:51.300 
logo so that's really cool

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:53.870 
logo so that's really cool
I<00:05:51.330> guess<00:05:51.900> that<00:05:52.139> much<00:05:52.320> is<00:05:52.470> it<00:05:52.770> not<00:05:53.310> much<00:05:53.550> to<00:05:53.729> say

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:53.880 
I guess that much is it not much to say

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:55.939 
I guess that much is it not much to say
about<00:05:54.000> this<00:05:54.240> ROM<00:05:54.449> this<00:05:54.690> is<00:05:54.870> more<00:05:55.199> of<00:05:55.320> an<00:05:55.440> ESP

00:05:55.939 --> 00:05:55.949 
about this ROM this is more of an ESP

00:05:55.949 --> 00:05:58.760 
about this ROM this is more of an ESP
ROM<00:05:56.190> than<00:05:56.539> CyanogenMod<00:05:57.539> ROM<00:05:57.690> but<00:05:57.900> not<00:05:58.289> to<00:05:58.590> have

00:05:58.760 --> 00:05:58.770 
ROM than CyanogenMod ROM but not to have

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:01.460 
ROM than CyanogenMod ROM but not to have
factor<00:05:59.220> not<00:05:59.699> to<00:05:59.909> an<00:06:00.180> extend<00:06:00.900> that<00:06:01.080> it<00:06:01.289> is

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:01.470 
factor not to an extend that it is

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:04.070 
factor not to an extend that it is
similar<00:06:01.770> to<00:06:02.159> Super<00:06:02.490> Nexus<00:06:02.849> no<00:06:03.000> it<00:06:03.210> is<00:06:03.389> kind<00:06:04.020> of

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:04.080 
similar to Super Nexus no it is kind of

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:06.230 
similar to Super Nexus no it is kind of
in<00:06:04.199> the<00:06:04.289> middle<00:06:04.470> again<00:06:05.130> if<00:06:05.310> you<00:06:05.430> have<00:06:05.550> use<00:06:05.789> slim

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:06.240 
in the middle again if you have use slim

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:09.189 
in the middle again if you have use slim
cat<00:06:06.449> one<00:06:06.690> you<00:06:07.080> will<00:06:07.259> feel<00:06:07.620> right<00:06:08.009> at<00:06:08.159> home<00:06:08.190> so

00:06:09.189 --> 00:06:09.199 
cat one you will feel right at home so

00:06:09.199 --> 00:06:11.600 
cat one you will feel right at home so
yeah<00:06:10.199> I<00:06:10.229> guess<00:06:10.650> how<00:06:10.860> much<00:06:11.009> is<00:06:11.190> it<00:06:11.310> about<00:06:11.490> the

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:11.610 
yeah I guess how much is it about the

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:12.649 
yeah I guess how much is it about the
