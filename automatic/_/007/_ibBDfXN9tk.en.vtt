building<00:01:17.580> temporary<00:01:18.030> walls<00:01:18.270> so<00:01:18.420> that<00:01:18.450> we

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
building temporary walls so that we

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.330 
building temporary walls so that we
could<00:01:18.750> do<00:01:18.900> all<00:01:19.049> that<00:01:19.170> work<00:01:19.350> on<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:20.040> inside

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
could do all that work on the inside

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.030 
could do all that work on the inside
that<00:01:20.490> I<00:01:20.549> was<00:01:20.759> just<00:01:20.970> describing<00:01:21.210> so<00:01:21.659> we<00:01:22.290> got<00:01:22.470> two

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
that I was just describing so we got two

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.469 
that I was just describing so we got two
critical<00:01:23.430> paths<00:01:23.640> going<00:01:23.939> right<00:01:24.090> now<00:01:24.270> our

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
critical paths going right now our

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.570 
critical paths going right now our
interior<00:01:24.840> finishes<00:01:25.259> in<00:01:25.409> an<00:01:25.530> exterior<00:01:25.890> wall<00:01:26.009> so

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
interior finishes in an exterior wall so

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.270 
interior finishes in an exterior wall so
we<00:01:26.759> usually<00:01:26.909> only<00:01:27.150> want<00:01:27.540> one<00:01:27.750> but<00:01:28.020> and<00:01:29.009> we're

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
we usually only want one but and we're

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.460 
we usually only want one but and we're

all that precast concrete is in we have
a<00:01:39.600> bridge<00:01:39.900> that<00:01:39.930> looks<00:01:40.530> pretty<00:01:40.680> serviceable

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
a bridge that looks pretty serviceable

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.770 
a bridge that looks pretty serviceable
at<00:01:41.280> this<00:01:41.369> point<00:01:41.579> it<00:01:41.970> looks<00:01:42.240> like<00:01:42.600> it's<00:01:42.750> ready

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
at this point it looks like it's ready

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.420 
at this point it looks like it's ready
to<00:01:42.990> walk<00:01:43.140> on<00:01:43.320> but<00:01:43.500> we<00:01:43.590> have<00:01:43.710> another<00:01:43.740> layer<00:01:44.159> yet

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
to walk on but we have another layer yet

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:45.920 
to walk on but we have another layer yet
to<00:01:44.549> go<00:01:44.640> on<00:01:44.759> top<00:01:44.970> of<00:01:45.119> that<00:01:45.240> and<00:01:45.420> then<00:01:45.600> of<00:01:45.720> course

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
to go on top of that and then of course

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.080 
to go on top of that and then of course
the<00:01:46.079> tanger<00:01:46.439> Minh<00:01:46.590> exterior<00:01:47.490> wall<00:01:47.790> will<00:01:47.970> be

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
the tanger Minh exterior wall will be

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.260 
the tanger Minh exterior wall will be
opened<00:01:48.540> up<00:01:48.659> to<00:01:48.689> put<00:01:49.439> doors<00:01:49.680> in<00:01:49.890> it<00:01:50.009> so<00:01:50.850> still

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
opened up to put doors in it so still

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.550 
opened up to put doors in it so still
fair<00:01:51.479> amount<00:01:51.600> of<00:01:51.720> work<00:01:51.840> to<00:01:51.960> be<00:01:51.990> done<00:01:52.049> there<00:01:52.229> but

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
fair amount of work to be done there but

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.039 
fair amount of work to be done there but
the<00:01:52.649> heavy<00:01:52.799> lifting<00:01:52.920> is<00:01:53.310> done<00:01:53.340> so<00:01:54.329> and<00:01:54.689> you

the heavy lifting is done so and you
could<00:01:55.229> really<00:01:55.350> start<00:01:55.649> to<00:01:55.770> see<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.070> shape<00:01:56.700> of

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
could really start to see the shape of

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.700 
could really start to see the shape of
it<00:01:57.000> both<00:01:57.180> from<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.420> ground<00:01:57.750> and<00:01:57.960> and<00:01:58.290> up<00:01:58.530> on

really good look instead I think it's a
walnut<00:02:37.830> if<00:02:37.950> i'm<00:02:38.070> not<00:02:38.220> mistaken<00:02:38.370> and<00:02:38.910> so<00:02:39.330> that's

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
walnut if i'm not mistaken and so that's

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.030
