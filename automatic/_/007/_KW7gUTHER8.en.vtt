 afford yourself quite popular and 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.210
 palettes of shadows like Lorac strait neykid 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.130
 123 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.320
 but at the same time each of us must 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.100
 look very beautiful and stylish and 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.170
 naturally 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.050
 today I want to present your attention 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.779
 a palette novelty from meybellin which 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.789
 called brought this palette I bought 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.550
 in the river gosh and on the gold card on me 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.769
 cost about 700,750 rubles and 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.510
 today I would like to make a full 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.059
 review on this palette tell you about 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.550
 cons and and about the pros of course pluses 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.399
 outweigh but let's talk about cons first 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.110
 this packaging is packaging very cheap and with 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.969
 not the same bukhanov you fall then she 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.219
 eroded just to the nines 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.469
 the next drawback is the absence 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.390
 mirrors and now let's talk about 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.969
 pluses the first thing that of course is 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.160
 personally in my eyes is the smell namely his 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.559
 complete absence I do not really like when 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.719
 I smell the shadows and especially the makeup is old 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.520
 type cosmetics Ruby Rose and the girls 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.530
 let's look at it with you today 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.320
 such a palette from meybellin here we have 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.420
 12 shades that will help create both 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.970
 light weightless daytime makeup and 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.650
 bright smokey and evening look like i'm already 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.509
 said the packaging is certainly not super 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.090
 dear but basically decent that 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.830
 the most comfortable she is rather thin he 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.900
 here was useless therefore I him 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.850
 threw the colors here pretty 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.979
 varied and therefore is where 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.530
 roam so let's go over the 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.540
 colors here we have 6 matte 3 satin 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.540
 and 3 shimmer shades 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.280
 Matte and satin shades are very pleasant. 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.189
 very silky 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.200
 so looks sweater but 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:43.530
 shimmer have a slightly different texture 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:46.049
 they are more harsh but also 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:49.530
 very well pigmented and by 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:52.250
 drawing something like cream 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:56.159
 frosted light peach shade 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:58.350
 a little chalky but again 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.680
 very well pigmented 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.210
 shade is easy to apply and 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.070
 good transmits its color perfectly 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.649
 suitable for shading 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.959
 some shade I personally think that 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:13.340
 this gamma is just perfect for day and 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:16.129
 newt make up about applying shadows super pi 2 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.560
 irided color give completely let's 

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:23.120
 I'll show you a few 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:25.030
 sweater aw black shade very pleasant 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:28.099
 very coal 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:30.739
 super pigmented shadows transmit 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:34.370
 the light is completely bright saturated and not 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:36.890
 dance a number with them and want to create 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:39.290
 various makeup single moment 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.900
 when applying a fluffy brush can 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:44.060
 just a little showered and bullet but 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.220
 if they are applied with clapping 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.829
 movements in general, no problems 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:51.260
 will be with sponzhy do not dust at all stew 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:53.269
 good in porridge and stained not going 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.849
 resistance without a base in principle such 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:57.019
 adequately 68 hours icon each 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:58.610
 budget palette 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:00.980
 and not only budget can 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:03.799
 boast such a variety of matt 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:06.769
 I think that this is the most successful 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:08.660
 budget palette for nude makeup 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:10.640
 also for smokey ice is now on the market 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:12.980
 so my verdict 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.870
 Yes, I think that the price of this palette is very 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:17.030
 I am very understated and I can tell you 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.480
 honestly and frankly some of the most 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.609
 the best 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.319
 not the best but some of the best 

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:23.329
 shadows in my collection 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:25.489
 It is a pity that in Russia this palette 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:28.459
 presented only in one range since 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:31.160
 I know that in America there are either 3 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:32.900
 or 4 variants of similar palettes if 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.700
 girls you are looking after yourself some 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.230
 budget policy with neutral 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.359
 shades with which you can 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.760
 create both day and evening makeup 

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:42.980
 I sincerely advise you to try it 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.630
 and today my beauty on it all I 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.790
