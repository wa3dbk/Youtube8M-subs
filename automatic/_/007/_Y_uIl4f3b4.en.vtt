about<00:02:22.150> this<00:02:22.330> is<00:02:22.570> that<00:02:22.600> he's<00:02:22.900> not<00:02:23.080> frozen<00:02:23.560> as

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
about this is that he's not frozen as

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:24.990 
about this is that he's not frozen as
you'd<00:02:23.800> think<00:02:23.830> because<00:02:24.280> the<00:02:24.400> head<00:02:24.580> is<00:02:24.820> actually

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
you'd think because the head is actually

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.490 
you'd think because the head is actually
on<00:02:25.270> a<00:02:25.300> ball<00:02:25.540> drilling<00:02:25.870> so<00:02:26.050> you<00:02:26.140> can<00:02:26.290> get<00:02:26.410> the

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
on a ball drilling so you can get the

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:27.900 
on a ball drilling so you can get the
head<00:02:26.680> to<00:02:26.830> move<00:02:26.950> around<00:02:27.220> that<00:02:27.550> much

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
head to move around that much

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.270 
head to move around that much
although<00:02:28.360> the<00:02:28.480> arms<00:02:28.870> the<00:02:29.500> way<00:02:29.620> they<00:02:29.770> are<00:02:29.920> here

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
although the arms the way they are here

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.610 
although the arms the way they are here
are<00:02:30.370> not<00:02:30.520> going<00:02:30.730> to<00:02:30.790> move<00:02:30.880> at<00:02:31.000> all<00:02:31.440> the<00:02:32.440> lower

going to reflect off that differently as

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.880 
going to reflect off that differently as

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:10.150 
a plastic figure that's to be expected

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:12.610 
a plastic figure that's to be expected
but<00:06:11.150> it<00:06:11.270> just<00:06:11.449> seems<00:06:11.659> to<00:06:11.840> be<00:06:11.870> not<00:06:12.139> so<00:06:12.349> much<00:06:12.409> of

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:12.620 
but it just seems to be not so much of

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:13.839 
but it just seems to be not so much of
an<00:06:12.710> issue<00:06:12.800> with<00:06:13.099> some<00:06:13.280> of<00:06:13.310> the<00:06:13.460> other<00:06:13.580> figures

00:06:13.839 --> 00:06:13.849 
an issue with some of the other figures

00:06:13.849 --> 00:06:15.909 
an issue with some of the other figures
so<00:06:14.180> maybe<00:06:14.449> this<00:06:15.139> one<00:06:15.380> so<00:06:15.560> they<00:06:15.650> could<00:06:15.830> have

00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:15.919 
so maybe this one so they could have

00:06:15.919 --> 00:06:17.439 
so maybe this one so they could have
done<00:06:16.039> something<00:06:16.250> a<00:06:16.370> little<00:06:16.580> bit<00:06:16.699> different<00:06:17.240> I

00:06:17.439 --> 00:06:17.449 
done something a little bit different I

00:06:17.449 --> 00:06:19.149 
done something a little bit different I
am<00:06:18.050> a<00:06:18.080> little<00:06:18.289> bit<00:06:18.469> disappointed<00:06:18.979> that<00:06:19.009> they

00:06:19.149 --> 00:06:19.159 
am a little bit disappointed that they

00:06:19.159 --> 00:06:20.499 
am a little bit disappointed that they
don't<00:06:19.340> have<00:06:19.490> a<00:06:19.520> downward<00:06:19.789> right<00:06:20.150> arm<00:06:20.360> because

00:06:20.499 --> 00:06:20.509 
don't have a downward right arm because

00:06:20.509 --> 00:06:22.659 
don't have a downward right arm because
having<00:06:20.990> his<00:06:21.110> cap<00:06:21.319> on<00:06:21.530> is<00:06:21.710> hip<00:06:21.919> as<00:06:22.099> I<00:06:22.280> mentioned

00:06:22.659 --> 00:06:22.669 
having his cap on is hip as I mentioned

00:06:22.669 --> 00:06:24.279 
having his cap on is hip as I mentioned
is<00:06:22.909> something<00:06:23.509> we've<00:06:23.630> seen<00:06:23.659> Luffy<00:06:24.139> do<00:06:24.259> a

00:06:24.279 --> 00:06:24.289 
is something we've seen Luffy do a

00:06:24.289 --> 00:06:25.899 
is something we've seen Luffy do a
million<00:06:24.620> times<00:06:24.860> and<00:06:25.099> it's<00:06:25.340> done<00:06:25.520> on<00:06:25.669> other

00:06:25.899 --> 00:06:25.909 
million times and it's done on other

00:06:25.909 --> 00:06:29.050 
million times and it's done on other
figures<00:06:26.419> and<00:06:26.599> done<00:06:26.900> quite<00:06:27.680> well<00:06:27.740> and<00:06:28.400> even

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:29.060 
figures and done quite well and even

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:30.339 
figures and done quite well and even
though<00:06:29.150> most<00:06:29.300> of<00:06:29.479> the<00:06:29.570> color<00:06:29.750> wraps<00:06:29.960> are<00:06:30.169> good

00:06:30.339 --> 00:06:30.349 
though most of the color wraps are good

00:06:30.349 --> 00:06:32.019 
though most of the color wraps are good
I<00:06:30.380> would<00:06:30.770> have<00:06:30.889> said<00:06:31.099> that<00:06:31.279> we<00:06:31.370> could<00:06:31.580> see<00:06:31.789> some

00:06:32.019 --> 00:06:32.029 
I would have said that we could see some

00:06:32.029 --> 00:06:33.420 
I would have said that we could see some
better<00:06:32.270> work<00:06:32.539> there<00:06:32.839> with<00:06:33.050> the

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:33.430 
better work there with the

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:34.710 
better work there with the
our<00:06:33.520> could<00:06:33.820> stand<00:06:34.060> out<00:06:34.150> a<00:06:34.210> little<00:06:34.360> bit<00:06:34.570> more

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:34.720 
our could stand out a little bit more

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:37.170 
our could stand out a little bit more
the<00:06:35.320> sash<00:06:35.560> has<00:06:35.770> no<00:06:36.010> detailing<00:06:36.490> whatsoever<00:06:37.000> if

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:37.180 
the sash has no detailing whatsoever if

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:38.310 
the sash has no detailing whatsoever if
you<00:06:37.270> want<00:06:37.450> to<00:06:37.510> go<00:06:37.570> in<00:06:37.690> there<00:06:37.810> and<00:06:37.930> ink<00:06:38.110> it<00:06:38.230> up

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:38.320 
you want to go in there and ink it up

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:40.410 
you want to go in there and ink it up
I'm<00:06:38.530> sure<00:06:38.740> you<00:06:38.920> could<00:06:39.160> but<00:06:39.880> for<00:06:40.030> somebody<00:06:40.300> like

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:40.420 
I'm sure you could but for somebody like

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:41.730 
I'm sure you could but for somebody like
me<00:06:40.600> who<00:06:40.630> just<00:06:40.780> takes<00:06:41.080> it<00:06:41.170> out<00:06:41.260> of<00:06:41.320> the<00:06:41.410> package

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:41.740 
me who just takes it out of the package

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:43.710 
me who just takes it out of the package
it<00:06:42.010> just<00:06:42.400> leaves<00:06:42.580> a<00:06:42.670> little<00:06:42.910> bit<00:06:43.030> to<00:06:43.540> be

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:43.720 
it just leaves a little bit to be

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:45.690 
it just leaves a little bit to be
desired<00:06:43.750> and<00:06:44.440> finally<00:06:44.890> when<00:06:45.100> he's<00:06:45.280> standing

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:45.700 
desired and finally when he's standing

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:48.570 
desired and finally when he's standing
there<00:06:45.760> is<00:06:46.060> he<00:06:46.720> leaning<00:06:47.020> back<00:06:47.440> I<00:06:47.740> wonder<00:06:48.400> if

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:48.580 
there is he leaning back I wonder if

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:50.100 
there is he leaning back I wonder if
that's<00:06:48.790> too<00:06:49.090> much<00:06:49.120> from<00:06:49.480> the<00:06:49.570> front<00:06:49.780> it<00:06:49.930> looks

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:50.110 
that's too much from the front it looks

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:51.060 
that's too much from the front it looks
good<00:06:50.290> and<00:06:50.470> that's<00:06:50.590> the<00:06:50.680> way<00:06:50.770> you're<00:06:50.890> gonna<00:06:50.980> be

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:51.070 
good and that's the way you're gonna be

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:53.400 
good and that's the way you're gonna be
seeing<00:06:51.430> it<00:06:51.640> but<00:06:52.210> from<00:06:52.420> some<00:06:52.660> angles<00:06:53.080> it<00:06:53.230> just

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:53.410 
seeing it but from some angles it just

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:56.160 
seeing it but from some angles it just
looks<00:06:53.650> a<00:06:53.710> little<00:06:53.740> bit<00:06:54.070> strange<00:06:54.190> so<00:06:54.940> my<00:06:55.780> final

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:56.170 
looks a little bit strange so my final

00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:57.570 
looks a little bit strange so my final
verdict<00:06:56.410> though<00:06:56.590> is<00:06:56.800> going<00:06:57.040> to<00:06:57.160> be<00:06:57.280> a<00:06:57.310> positive

00:06:57.570 --> 00:06:57.580 
verdict though is going to be a positive

00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:59.880 
verdict though is going to be a positive
because<00:06:58.030> in<00:06:58.390> the<00:06:58.480> end<00:06:58.630> does<00:06:58.930> it<00:06:59.140> capture<00:06:59.350> the

00:06:59.880 --> 00:06:59.890 
because in the end does it capture the

00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:01.350 
because in the end does it capture the
power<00:07:00.100> of<00:07:00.280> the<00:07:00.370> anime<00:07:00.640> and<00:07:00.760> the<00:07:00.790> manga<00:07:00.940> and<00:07:01.120> I'm

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:01.360 
power of the anime and the manga and I'm

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:04.500 
power of the anime and the manga and I'm
going<00:07:01.600> to<00:07:01.660> say<00:07:01.930> yes<00:07:02.470> it<00:07:02.740> does<00:07:03.240> it's<00:07:04.240> not<00:07:04.480> a

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:04.510 
going to say yes it does it's not a

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:06.510 
going to say yes it does it's not a
stationary<00:07:04.810> toy<00:07:05.380> I<00:07:05.650> was<00:07:05.800> already<00:07:05.950> complaining
