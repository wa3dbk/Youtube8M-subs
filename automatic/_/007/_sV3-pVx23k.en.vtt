00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:38.549 
you one or two easy levels okay so

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:41.030 
you one or two easy levels okay so
yesterday<00:03:38.670> sit<00:03:39.239> in<00:03:39.299> your<00:03:39.420> hand<00:03:39.600> like<00:03:39.750> so<00:03:40.040> left

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
and you have to sort of do the step that

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:50.270 
and you have to sort of do the step that
tells<00:03:45.030> you<00:03:45.209> left<00:03:46.430> stop<00:03:48.230> and<00:03:49.230> if<00:03:49.950> you<00:03:50.040> mess<00:03:50.250> up

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
tells you left stop and if you mess up

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.789 
tells you left stop and if you mess up
it'll<00:03:50.820> notice<00:03:51.180> with<00:03:51.750> the<00:03:51.840> iphone<00:03:52.109> 4<00:03:52.290> gyroscope

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:52.799 
it'll notice with the iphone 4 gyroscope

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:54.860 
it'll notice with the iphone 4 gyroscope
which<00:03:52.829> is<00:03:53.040> really<00:03:53.220> cool<00:03:53.430> um<00:03:53.700> and<00:03:54.450> if<00:03:54.630> you<00:03:54.720> go<00:03:54.810> to

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
which is really cool um and if you go to

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:57.229 
which is really cool um and if you go to
a<00:03:54.930> harder<00:03:55.560> level<00:03:55.769> which<00:03:56.190> I'll<00:03:56.370> do<00:03:56.549> right<00:03:56.579> now

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 
a harder level which I'll do right now

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:02.500 
a harder level which I'll do right now
um<00:03:57.859> how<00:03:58.859> do<00:03:58.920> I<00:03:59.010> go<00:03:59.130> back<00:03:59.310> try<00:03:59.760> again<00:04:00.350> back<00:04:01.370> and

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:02.510 
um how do I go back try again back and

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:05.660 
um how do I go back try again back and
back<00:04:03.510> again<00:04:03.750> and<00:04:04.200> then<00:04:04.319> we'll<00:04:04.410> go<00:04:04.620> to<00:04:04.670> maybe

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
back again and then we'll go to maybe

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:08.180 
back again and then we'll go to maybe
hard<00:04:06.060> level<00:04:06.420> little<00:04:06.840> too<00:04:07.200> how<00:04:07.530> about<00:04:07.709> three

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
hard level little too how about three

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:12.210 
hard level little too how about three
two<00:04:09.380> one<00:04:10.400> left

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:12.220 
two one left

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:20.130 
two one left
down<00:04:12.400> right<00:04:13.650> down<00:04:17.910> and<00:04:18.910> hide<00:04:19.600> you<00:04:19.870> just<00:04:19.989> put

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:20.140 
down right down and hide you just put

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:21.930 
down right down and hide you just put
your<00:04:20.230> finger<00:04:20.530> over<00:04:20.560> and<00:04:21.010> as<00:04:21.459> you<00:04:21.609> can<00:04:21.730> see<00:04:21.760> i

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:21.940 
your finger over and as you can see i

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.360 
your finger over and as you can see i
didn't<00:04:22.330> really<00:04:22.600> complete<00:04:23.020> it<00:04:23.170> so<00:04:23.320> I<00:04:23.560> fail<00:04:24.190> the

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370 
didn't really complete it so I fail the

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:26.550 
didn't really complete it so I fail the
challenge<00:04:24.820> so<00:04:25.660> that's<00:04:25.840> flip<00:04:26.110> it<00:04:26.230> a<00:04:26.260> really

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.560 
challenge so that's flip it a really

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:27.960 
challenge so that's flip it a really
cool<00:04:26.740> application<00:04:27.310> that<00:04:27.460> uses<00:04:27.580> the<00:04:27.850> new

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970 
cool application that uses the new

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:30.810 
cool application that uses the new
iphone<00:04:28.390> 4g<00:04:29.320> otoscope<00:04:29.620> and<00:04:29.980> the<00:04:30.610> last

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:30.820 
iphone 4g otoscope and the last

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:32.190 
iphone 4g otoscope and the last
application<00:04:31.330> i'm<00:04:31.510> going<00:04:31.630> to<00:04:31.690> be<00:04:31.780> showing<00:04:31.930> you

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:32.200 
application i'm going to be showing you

application<00:04:34.870> made<00:04:35.020> by<00:04:35.200> ng<00:04:35.650> moco<00:04:36.070> um<00:04:36.990> so<00:04:37.990> a

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
application made by ng moco um so a

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.740 
application made by ng moco um so a
really<00:04:38.260> cool<00:04:38.410> application<00:04:39.070> and<00:04:39.610> let's<00:04:40.540> get

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:40.750 
really cool application and let's get

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:42.900 
really cool application and let's get
this<00:04:40.810> little<00:04:41.350> video<00:04:41.500> here<00:04:41.680> and<00:04:42.190> here<00:04:42.670> we<00:04:42.790> are

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:42.910

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:54.250 
hard to do these new gyroscope games

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:57.000 
hard to do these new gyroscope games
without<00:04:54.850> getting<00:04:55.330> reflection<00:04:55.990> so<00:04:56.440> anyway<00:04:56.770> as

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:57.010 
without getting reflection so anyway as

without getting reflection so anyway as
you<00:04:57.040> can<00:04:57.220> see<00:04:57.400> you<00:04:57.430> can<00:04:58.180> control<00:04:58.870> it<00:04:58.990> like<00:04:59.020> like

00:04:59.430 --> 00:04:59.440 
you can see you can control it like like

you go so hopefully you get the point
that's<00:05:35.380> gun<00:05:35.680> range<00:05:35.890> a<00:05:36.070> really<00:05:36.280> cool

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:36.460 
that's gun range a really cool

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:38.219 
that's gun range a really cool
application<00:05:37.000> that<00:05:37.120> uses<00:05:37.270> the<00:05:37.570> new<00:05:37.690> iphone<00:05:38.050> 4

00:05:38.219 --> 00:05:38.229 
application that uses the new iphone 4

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:40.620 
application that uses the new iphone 4
gyroscope<00:05:38.919> there<00:05:39.580> are<00:05:39.700> other<00:05:39.910> applications

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:40.630 
gyroscope there are other applications

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:42.600 
gyroscope there are other applications
that<00:05:40.900> use<00:05:41.200> the<00:05:41.380> new<00:05:41.500> features<00:05:41.860> but<00:05:42.040> those<00:05:42.370> are

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:42.610 
that use the new features but those are

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:44.820 
that use the new features but those are
my<00:05:42.700> favorites<00:05:43.180> um<00:05:43.419> so<00:05:44.320> that's<00:05:44.470> really<00:05:44.620> about
