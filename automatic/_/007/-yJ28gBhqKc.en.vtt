00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:16.920
 Hi everybody, how are you today? 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.080
 It is clear that you ask the questions 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.340
 more frequent about him is the one doing 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.430
 row 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.680
 so let's start the question number 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:29.029
 where did you take this diet from a 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.500
 on this diet on television and 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:35.270
 will explain everything right to the average 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:38.610
 French pierre dukan he did the diet 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:40.200
 through books and now mixed 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.270
 so in the whole world so why 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.350
 that he became famous because the diet is 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.059
 super effective 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.399
 so I knew it was through 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.379
 of books on the same day as matter 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.350
 It's in the afternoon I went to a bookstore. 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.270
 But his books and not all 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.399
 first and decide to diet for 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.160
 prove how it had already tasted every 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:02.190
 long-term mortgage loan that 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:05.070
 ended there and ends up leaving 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.439
 decided to approve this short-term era and 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.350
 super effective that worked and that's where 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:12.750
 the diet books that Doctor cam 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:16.409
 another question is faithful feel pain 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.450
 head and yes of the urban son gave much 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.330
 my fiance was super shaken to be 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:24.479
 dispensed culture and with all and 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.460
 headaches the first three days have 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.640
 only from the first phase 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:32.280
 after the past or finance three 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.250
 or four days I felt quoted from the head 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:38.189
 Can I eat meat with eggs? 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.860
 Yes you can eat meat as if it's a tip 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:43.560
 for you I always did was make a 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.750
 video of your quail I ate 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.200
 meat with two colony students 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.310
 every time you will eat because when the 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.350
 confirm the novelty then gave the 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.200
 feeling that I was eating sea 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:58.140
 salad and help a little in the diet 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.509
 how many eggs can I eat a day 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.969
 amount of the next sun 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:06.000
 so the ideal is to eat the maximum 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:08.280
 of a yolk a day or an egg 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.860
 to have if you want to make a 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.050
 omelette with a new whole and several 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.300
 forests can do if you want 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:18.060
 started egg whites you can eat how many 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.700
 You want but Venus can only be food. 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:24.170
 one per day and all week 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:27.750
 can not exceed the maximum of 40 years I 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:29.220
 I understood how you do to face the 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.739
 sky finally olive oil 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:34.620
 I make meat or baked or else there is not 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:36.810
 that electric light that does not turn on 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.970
 need to put nothing olive oil just put 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.500
 upstairs funk with water underneath or leave 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.650
 a picture for you 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:46.739
 and also has another that is round that 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:50.640
 also in light of the Sunni and flu left 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:52.709
 this meat with no oil and if you 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.860
 they want to put a little penguin of olive oil 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:58.590
 put one on buffet strangers try 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:00.840
 hold well and you clean after the 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.530
 paper and makes the meat also without 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.470
 problem 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:06.629
 how to explain or not accepted egg from 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:09.780
 mickey mouse in the kitchen 

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:11.730
 or if you do not eat boiled eggs or if you 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.340
 do not do it anyway scheme with that 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.200
 because the meat places in the skillet a 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.870
 drop of olive oil and let it warm well 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:21.629
 everybody do the school paper and 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:24.620
 put the egg it will not stick 

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:27.269
 of course if the skillet is such 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:29.370
 nonsense a super question 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:32.129
 important thing they did to me is this 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:34.709
 Replace the pure oat bran vein 

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:36.950
 normal oat flakes can not 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:39.260
 replace the bran 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:42.590
 we have come because the focus of agreement 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:44.569
 one whole with many is contains 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:48.290
 more calories than my 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:50.239
 another nice tip 16 is careful 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:52.519
 oat bran we only take as in the 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:55.489
 first phase with diet one and a half 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:56.680
 oat bran for one day only the spoon and 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:59.390
 sock per day 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:01.819
 indifference in the morning can I 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:02.660
 eat your late night in the second phase of 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:04.940
 diet 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:06.349
 Who can not have everything? 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:09.019
 there were very few hours there 

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:11.690
 Calories Can Eat If You Stand After Eating 

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:13.940
 alcoholic beverage during the diet is 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:16.150
 nor in the first phase for attack phase 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:19.070
 or the second phase of cruise phase 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:21.139
 It was very poor in the wine glass in the diet 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:23.060
 continues the third phase you already have 

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:25.400
 right more food 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:27.830
 if I do not cruise the weight change 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.540
 careful three days I wanted to make a 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:31.910
 goal to change the weight one thing that 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:33.889
 was for example in the second phase 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:35.150
 has to be a pure protein where the 

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:37.760
 vegetable protein 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:40.400
 I made 20 pure protein where I have 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:43.610
 natura 2000 has in pure where the coach 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:45.820
 It lasts more or less how I put up with it. 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:48.770
 yes it helps on your balance numbers 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:51.860
 with the amount of food I can 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:54.320
 eat protein and cans 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:57.380
 so the proteins you can eat at 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:59.450
 quantity of cqcs to use a chicken 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:01.280
 in third the skin and begins to win 

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:03.139
 you can eat of course the party 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.930
 frank who keeps more until the end of the year 

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:08.900
 - but you should have no problem always be 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:10.940
 lean meats but you can eat the 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:12.620
 amount of protein you want 

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:16.610
 only when people like him are doing 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:18.740
 a little salt with nothing oil has not 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:21.620
 like me a lot because there should be some 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:23.389
 in which the food does not go down but can eat 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:25.669
 the amount you want and the 

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:29.210
 lapses that are I like white cheese 

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:31.940
 milk is we should not pass the quantity 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:34.340
 if one liter per day 

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:35.430
 fernando henrique gave me this idea 

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:36.900
 to make this dr 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:39.270
 when you are taking a type of 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:40.890
 drug controlled then people I 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:43.020
 I'm going to tell you what I was going for. 

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:45.090
 I am not a nutritionist these videos I 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:47.040
 I explain the experience that I 

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:49.170
 I had with your diet how I did everything 

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:51.300
 right what you can and can not do 

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:53.700
 eat because I have books 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:54.980
 I'm not a nutritionist and of course if you 

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:58.020
 is taking controlled medicines 

00:05:54.980 --> 00:06:00.330
 drug for depression I do not know 

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:02.100
 for whom any type of medicine 

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:05.520
 consulted a doctor in the storch quarter 

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:07.650
 take your medication because it has sugar 

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:09.420
 that we say that the medicine does not 

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:11.430
 have sugar that contain do not know what 

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:13.140
 fattening contains calories 

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:15.360
 No, people, for fuck's sake, I'm not going. 

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:17.400

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:21.480
 see your doctor and then will think 

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:24.000
 on dieting 

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:26.070

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.580
 we do treat you to 

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:30.990
 to diet because to lose weight has time 

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:33.390
 Of course we should not stay 

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:36.390
 leaving of things that fear of everything is the 

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:38.880
 Health of us, it's good, so this is it.
