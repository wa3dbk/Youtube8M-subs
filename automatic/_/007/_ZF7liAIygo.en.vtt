00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
depot and they're all maxed out so they

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:33.920 
depot and they're all maxed out so they

have enough buses they're going to be

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.020 
have enough buses they're going to be
travelling<00:00:34.320> around<00:00:34.380> and<00:00:34.829> what<00:00:35.489> he<00:00:35.579> said<00:00:35.850> is

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
travelling around and what he said is

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.110 
travelling around and what he said is
that<00:00:36.750> if<00:00:36.960> you<00:00:37.230> put<00:00:37.469> down<00:00:37.680> one<00:00:37.980> bus<00:00:38.219> stop<00:00:38.250> in

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
that if you put down one bus stop in

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.580 
that if you put down one bus stop in
your<00:00:39.360> city<00:00:39.600> regardless<00:00:40.200> of<00:00:40.290> whether<00:00:40.440> you<00:00:40.500> have

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
your city regardless of whether you have

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.680 
your city regardless of whether you have
a<00:00:40.620> bus<00:00:40.860> terminal<00:00:41.100> or<00:00:41.550> shuttle<00:00:42.030> bus<00:00:42.210> station

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
a bus terminal or shuttle bus station

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.440 
a bus terminal or shuttle bus station
that<00:00:43.620> Sims<00:00:44.340> will<00:00:44.550> start<00:00:44.789> commuting<00:00:45.210> back<00:00:45.390> and

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
that Sims will start commuting back and

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.900 
that Sims will start commuting back and
forth<00:00:45.690> so<00:00:46.260> this<00:00:46.829> is<00:00:47.039> great<00:00:47.280> advice<00:00:47.430> when<00:00:47.789> you

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
forth so this is great advice when you

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.959 
forth so this is great advice when you
start<00:00:48.239> a<00:00:48.300> new<00:00:48.329> city<00:00:48.660> immediately<00:00:49.530> drop<00:00:50.430> a<00:00:50.670> bus

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
start a new city immediately drop a bus

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:51.380 
start a new city immediately drop a bus
station

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
station

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.000 
station
that<00:00:51.570> means<00:00:51.780> Sims<00:00:52.079> from<00:00:52.260> your<00:00:52.410> other<00:00:52.590> cities

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
that means Sims from your other cities

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.799 
that means Sims from your other cities
in<00:00:53.219> your<00:00:53.430> region<00:00:53.760> will<00:00:53.940> start<00:00:54.390> commuting

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
in your region will start commuting

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.209 
in your region will start commuting
there<00:00:54.960> and<00:00:55.170> I<00:00:55.230> think<00:00:55.289> maybe<00:00:55.710> outside<00:00:55.920> the

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
there and I think maybe outside the

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.340 
there and I think maybe outside the
region<00:00:56.489> I'm<00:00:56.610> not<00:00:56.760> harm<00:00:56.940> Center<00:00:57.300> on<00:00:57.420> that<00:00:57.570> so

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
region I'm not harm Center on that so

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.830 
region I'm not harm Center on that so
there's<00:00:58.829> your<00:00:59.010> first<00:00:59.070> thing<00:00:59.570> should<00:01:00.570> be

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
there's your first thing should be

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.540 
there's your first thing should be
seeing<00:01:01.230> yeah<00:01:01.739> here<00:01:02.100> we<00:01:02.160> go

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
seeing yeah here we go

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.710 
seeing yeah here we go
buses<00:01:03.359> are<00:01:03.480> coming<00:01:03.870> in<00:01:04.080> I<00:01:04.320> started<00:01:04.769> a<00:01:04.830> new<00:01:05.010> map

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:05.720 
buses are coming in I started a new map

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.969 
buses are coming in I started a new map
from<00:01:07.100> Sawyer<00:01:08.100> crossing<00:01:08.760> so<00:01:09.530> their<00:01:10.530> comment

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
from Sawyer crossing so their comment

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.310 
from Sawyer crossing so their comment
across<00:01:11.220> to<00:01:11.430> here<00:01:11.670> crossing<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.930> crossing

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
across to here crossing the crossing

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.170 
across to here crossing the crossing
across<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.710> bridge<00:01:13.860> was<00:01:14.040> pretty<00:01:14.250> cool<00:01:14.400> okay

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
across the bridge was pretty cool okay

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.910 
across the bridge was pretty cool okay
so<00:01:15.509> there's<00:01:15.689> point<00:01:15.990> number<00:01:16.229> one<00:01:16.409> is<00:01:16.590> when<00:01:16.830> you

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
so there's point number one is when you

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.130 
so there's point number one is when you
make<00:01:17.070> a<00:01:17.100> new<00:01:17.280> city<00:01:17.490> drop<00:01:17.909> a<00:01:17.939> bus<00:01:18.210> stop<00:01:18.420> second

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
make a new city drop a bus stop second

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.450 
make a new city drop a bus stop second
thing<00:01:19.259> is<00:01:19.320> I<00:01:19.439> was<00:01:19.530> a<00:01:19.590> little<00:01:19.770> confused<00:01:20.159> on<00:01:20.280> how

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
thing is I was a little confused on how

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:21.980 
thing is I was a little confused on how
the<00:01:20.520> buses<00:01:20.820> were<00:01:21.090> working<00:01:21.479> people<00:01:21.810> have<00:01:21.869> had

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
the buses were working people have had

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.380 
the buses were working people have had
problems<00:01:22.290> them<00:01:22.590> and<00:01:22.939> this<00:01:23.939> guy<00:01:24.090> actually

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
problems them and this guy actually

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.450 
problems them and this guy actually
wrote<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:25.170> tweets<00:01:25.409> around<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:25.710> screen

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
wrote the tweets around the screen

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.490 
wrote the tweets around the screen
this<00:01:26.820> guy<00:01:26.970> actually<00:01:27.420> wrote<00:01:27.689> a<00:01:27.990> really<00:01:28.290> good

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
this guy actually wrote a really good

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.649 
this guy actually wrote a really good
article<00:01:28.740> about<00:01:29.100> shuttle<00:01:29.549> buses<00:01:29.909> and<00:01:30.090> the

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
article about shuttle buses and the

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.149 
article about shuttle buses and the
logic<00:01:30.990> behind<00:01:31.110> them<00:01:31.409> how<00:01:31.530> they<00:01:31.710> choose<00:01:31.890> which

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
logic behind them how they choose which

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.890 
logic behind them how they choose which
station<00:01:32.490> they're<00:01:32.610> going<00:01:32.729> to<00:01:32.790> go<00:01:32.850> to<00:01:32.880> and<00:01:33.180> basic

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
station they're going to go to and basic

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.140 
station they're going to go to and basic
logic<00:01:34.530> is<00:01:34.680> that<00:01:35.100> they<00:01:35.610> go<00:01:35.729> to<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:35.939> station

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
logic is that they go to the station

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.060 
logic is that they go to the station
with<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.479> most<00:01:36.630> people<00:01:37.020> either<00:01:37.710> left<00:01:37.950> or

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
with the most people either left or

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.300 
with the most people either left or
right

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
right

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.010 
right
whatever<00:01:38.820> one<00:01:39.060> they<00:01:39.540> have<00:01:39.630> two<00:01:39.780> choices

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
whatever one they have two choices

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.510 
whatever one they have two choices
either<00:01:40.290> go<00:01:40.560> to<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.710> station<00:01:40.920> to<00:01:41.070> left<00:01:41.340> when

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
either go to the station to left when

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:42.980 
either go to the station to left when
they<00:01:41.579> hit<00:01:41.670> a<00:01:41.729> tee<00:01:41.970> grow<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.540> station<00:01:42.810> with<00:01:42.899> the

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
they hit a tee grow the station with the

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.660 
they hit a tee grow the station with the
right<00:01:43.229> and<00:01:43.470> they<00:01:44.070> go<00:01:44.159> to<00:01:44.220> one<00:01:44.399> of<00:01:44.430> the<00:01:44.579> most

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
right and they go to one of the most

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.520 
right and they go to one of the most
stations<00:01:44.909> most<00:01:45.810> people<00:01:46.140> and<00:01:46.229> then<00:01:46.320> they<00:01:46.409> just

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
stations most people and then they just

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.889 
stations most people and then they just
keep<00:01:46.710> on<00:01:46.799> making<00:01:46.979> that<00:01:47.189> decision<00:01:47.399> again<00:01:47.899> which

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
keep on making that decision again which

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.030 
keep on making that decision again which
is<00:01:49.049> good<00:01:49.229> and<00:01:49.470> bad

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
is good and bad

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.990 
is good and bad
it's<00:01:50.880> here's<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.630> bus<00:01:51.780> is<00:01:51.930> coming<00:01:52.200> in<00:01:53.000> in

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
it's here's the bus is coming in in

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.789 
it's here's the bus is coming in in
theory<00:01:54.930> it<00:01:55.110> should<00:01:55.140> get<00:01:55.409> them<00:01:55.530> all<00:01:55.619> but

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
theory it should get them all but

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.429 
theory it should get them all but
sometimes<00:01:56.430> it<00:01:56.790> causes<00:01:57.210> problems<00:01:57.439> with

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
sometimes it causes problems with

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.209 
sometimes it causes problems with
picking<00:01:59.369> up<00:01:59.490> people<00:01:59.729> or<00:02:00.409> some<00:02:01.409> stations<00:02:02.040> will

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
picking up people or some stations will

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:03.499 
picking up people or some stations will
fill<00:02:02.399> up<00:02:02.520> too<00:02:02.640> much<00:02:02.729> see<00:02:02.969> how<00:02:03.060> many<00:02:03.210> we<00:02:03.360> got

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
fill up too much see how many we got

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.719 
fill up too much see how many we got
okay<00:02:03.990> so<00:02:04.290> there's<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:05.070> first<00:02:05.280> thing<00:02:05.460> you<00:02:05.579> want

to do now I also ask them hey so a lot

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.369 
to do now I also ask them hey so a lot
of<00:02:08.610> my<00:02:08.970> buses<00:02:09.479> to<00:02:09.629> go<00:02:09.780> to<00:02:09.840> the<00:02:09.959> end<00:02:10.140> of<00:02:10.229> the

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
of my buses to go to the end of the

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.650 
of my buses to go to the end of the
street<00:02:10.830> and<00:02:11.039> they<00:02:11.160> immediately<00:02:11.580> turn<00:02:11.849> around

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
street and they immediately turn around

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.420 
street and they immediately turn around
and<00:02:12.750> it's<00:02:13.140> been<00:02:13.320> driving<00:02:13.740> me<00:02:13.830> nuts<00:02:13.860> I<00:02:14.160> couldn't

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
and it's been driving me nuts I couldn't

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.880 
and it's been driving me nuts I couldn't
figure<00:02:14.550> it<00:02:14.700> out<00:02:15.170> so<00:02:16.170> what<00:02:16.350> he<00:02:16.530> said

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
figure it out so what he said

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.400 
figure it out so what he said
I<00:02:16.920> asked<00:02:17.250> him<00:02:17.340> hey<00:02:17.490> would<00:02:17.790> it<00:02:17.820> help<00:02:18.120> I<00:02:18.420> was<00:02:19.050> over

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
I asked him hey would it help I was over

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:20.770 
I asked him hey would it help I was over
shooting<00:02:19.620> my<00:02:19.740> city<00:02:19.950> that's<00:02:20.280> a<00:02:20.340> little<00:02:20.460> weird

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
shooting my city that's a little weird

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.650 
shooting my city that's a little weird
would<00:02:21.780> it<00:02:21.810> help<00:02:22.080> if<00:02:22.380> I<00:02:22.710> put<00:02:23.430> bus<00:02:24.000> stops<00:02:24.270> on<00:02:24.480> both

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
would it help if I put bus stops on both

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.540 
would it help if I put bus stops on both
sides<00:02:24.900> so<00:02:25.080> we<00:02:25.170> said<00:02:25.350> definitely<00:02:25.890> put<00:02:26.340> bus

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
sides so we said definitely put bus

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.880 
sides so we said definitely put bus
stops<00:02:26.940> on<00:02:27.150> both<00:02:27.480> sides<00:02:27.720> so<00:02:28.320> whenever<00:02:28.470> you

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
stops on both sides so whenever you

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.790 
stops on both sides so whenever you
build<00:02:29.040> a<00:02:29.190> bus<00:02:29.400> station<00:02:29.780> bus<00:02:30.780> stop<00:02:30.990> put<00:02:31.470> on<00:02:31.590> both

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
build a bus station bus stop put on both

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.170 
build a bus station bus stop put on both
sides<00:02:32.070> the<00:02:32.280> bus<00:02:32.550> doesn't<00:02:32.760> have<00:02:32.940> to<00:02:33.000> turn

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
sides the bus doesn't have to turn

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.990 
sides the bus doesn't have to turn
around<00:02:33.300> to<00:02:33.540> get<00:02:33.660> the<00:02:33.750> passengers<00:02:33.980> now<00:02:34.980> if<00:02:35.400> you

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
around to get the passengers now if you

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.730 
around to get the passengers now if you
don't<00:02:36.270> know<00:02:36.390> a<00:02:36.420> park-and-ride<00:02:36.960> is<00:02:37.380> just<00:02:37.620> like

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
don't know a park-and-ride is just like

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.700 
don't know a park-and-ride is just like
a<00:02:37.800> bus<00:02:38.130> stop<00:02:38.430> except<00:02:39.210> Sims<00:02:39.780> can<00:02:40.080> drive<00:02:40.440> and

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:40.710 
a bus stop except Sims can drive and

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:42.890 
a bus stop except Sims can drive and
park<00:02:41.010> to<00:02:41.250> the<00:02:41.280> at<00:02:41.580> the<00:02:41.730> bus<00:02:41.910> stop<00:02:42.120> and<00:02:42.390> this<00:02:42.750> is

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
park to the at the bus stop and this is

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.590 
park to the at the bus stop and this is
really<00:02:43.320> good<00:02:43.500> it<00:02:43.680> helps<00:02:43.980> your<00:02:44.160> traffic<00:02:44.670> and<00:02:44.850> I

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
really good it helps your traffic and I

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.150 
really good it helps your traffic and I
think<00:02:45.900> it's<00:02:46.020> better<00:02:46.200> than<00:02:46.350> bus<00:02:46.590> stops<00:02:46.830> you

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
think it's better than bus stops you

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
think it's better than bus stops you
don't<00:02:47.370> have<00:02:47.460> pedestrians<00:02:48.000> walking

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
don't have pedestrians walking

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.900 
don't have pedestrians walking
everywhere<00:02:48.480> so<00:02:49.020> what<00:02:49.170> I<00:02:49.200> like<00:02:49.470> to<00:02:49.620> do<00:02:49.910> the

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
everywhere so what I like to do the

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.140 
everywhere so what I like to do the
city's<00:02:51.210> not<00:02:51.360> built<00:02:51.660> the<00:02:51.720> best<00:02:52.110> but<00:02:53.100> on<00:02:53.310> one

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
city's not built the best but on one

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.730 
city's not built the best but on one
side<00:02:54.420> of<00:02:54.540> the<00:02:54.630> street<00:02:54.780> I<00:02:55.050> put<00:02:55.770> a<00:02:55.800> bus<00:02:57.590> park<00:02:58.590> and

00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:58.740 
side of the street I put a bus park and

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:00.560 
side of the street I put a bus park and
ride<00:02:58.860> and<00:02:59.040> then<00:02:59.730> on<00:02:59.790> the<00:02:59.910> other<00:02:59.940> side<00:03:00.450> of<00:03:00.480> the

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
ride and then on the other side of the

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:03.050 
ride and then on the other side of the
street<00:03:00.780> I<00:03:00.810> put<00:03:01.080> a<00:03:01.110> bus<00:03:01.410> stop<00:03:01.710> now<00:03:02.670> it's

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
street I put a bus stop now it's

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.960 
street I put a bus stop now it's
equivalent<00:03:03.780> to<00:03:04.020> do<00:03:04.230> two<00:03:04.590> bus<00:03:04.890> stops<00:03:05.220> but<00:03:05.850> it's

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
equivalent to do two bus stops but it's

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:07.340 
equivalent to do two bus stops but it's
better<00:03:06.240> because<00:03:06.780> one<00:03:07.020> of<00:03:07.050> them's<00:03:07.230> a

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
better because one of them's a

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.880 
better because one of them's a
park-and-ride

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
park-and-ride

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.570 
park-and-ride
so<00:03:08.790> he'll<00:03:09.360> and<00:03:09.600> then<00:03:09.870> finally<00:03:10.590> sorry<00:03:11.130> the

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
so he'll and then finally sorry the

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:13.580 
so he'll and then finally sorry the
final<00:03:12.120> point<00:03:12.360> I<00:03:12.420> wanted<00:03:12.600> to<00:03:12.690> bring<00:03:12.810> up<00:03:12.900> is<00:03:13.050> he

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
final point I wanted to bring up is he

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.500 
final point I wanted to bring up is he
made<00:03:13.920> a<00:03:13.950> point<00:03:14.340> I<00:03:14.520> didn't<00:03:14.760> ask<00:03:14.910> him<00:03:15.150> this<00:03:15.300> but

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
made a point I didn't ask him this but

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:16.850 
made a point I didn't ask him this but
he<00:03:15.750> was<00:03:15.840> really<00:03:15.960> helpful<00:03:16.110> just<00:03:16.350> brought<00:03:16.680> it<00:03:16.800> up

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
he was really helpful just brought it up

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.750 
he was really helpful just brought it up
was<00:03:17.520> that<00:03:18.240> you<00:03:18.450> should<00:03:18.720> space<00:03:19.110> out<00:03:19.440> your<00:03:20.340> bus

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
was that you should space out your bus

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.820 
was that you should space out your bus
stops<00:03:21.030> if<00:03:21.300> you<00:03:22.110> have<00:03:22.290> them<00:03:22.440> too<00:03:22.620> close

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830 
stops if you have them too close

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:24.470 
stops if you have them too close
together<00:03:23.010> sometimes<00:03:23.580> it<00:03:23.730> causes<00:03:23.880> problems

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
together sometimes it causes problems

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.620 
together sometimes it causes problems
so<00:03:25.080> we<00:03:25.200> said<00:03:25.410> don't<00:03:26.400> spam<00:03:26.880> a<00:03:26.910> street<00:03:27.330> with<00:03:27.480> them

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
so we said don't spam a street with them

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.190 
so we said don't spam a street with them
space<00:03:28.170> them<00:03:28.380> out<00:03:28.470> so<00:03:28.890> that<00:03:28.920> way<00:03:29.220> other<00:03:29.970> people

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
space them out so that way other people

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.510 
space them out so that way other people
and<00:03:31.200> the<00:03:31.320> buses<00:03:31.620> have<00:03:31.740> better<00:03:31.920> flow<00:03:32.220> and<00:03:32.460> they

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:32.520 
and the buses have better flow and they

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.670 
and the buses have better flow and they
don't<00:03:32.670> get<00:03:32.790> stuck<00:03:33.060> so<00:03:33.690> that's<00:03:34.140> what<00:03:34.320> I<00:03:34.350> do<00:03:34.440> in
