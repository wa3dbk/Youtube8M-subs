00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:43.790 
when we talked it was very much there

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:45.340 
when we talked it was very much there
been<00:00:43.970> a<00:00:44.000> fairly<00:00:44.360> big<00:00:44.570> correction<00:00:44.989> a<00:00:45.050> lot<00:00:45.290> of

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:45.350 
been a fairly big correction a lot of

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.110 
been a fairly big correction a lot of
the<00:00:45.410> prices<00:00:45.830> there<00:00:46.129> was<00:00:46.250> questions<00:00:46.820> over

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
the prices there was questions over

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.850

next<00:00:49.129> and<00:00:49.879> I<00:00:49.910> think<00:00:50.089> even<00:00:50.180> back<00:00:50.390> then<00:00:50.629> I<00:00:50.660> said

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:50.960 
next and I think even back then I said

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.930 
next and I think even back then I said
it's<00:00:51.320> very<00:00:51.530> much<00:00:51.769> an<00:00:51.920> individual<00:00:52.489> stock

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 
it's very much an individual stock

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 
up and down a lot of sideways trading

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.380 
up and down a lot of sideways trading
which<00:01:15.380> keeps<00:01:15.680> a<00:01:16.010> lot<00:01:16.189> of<00:01:16.369> investors<00:01:16.850> on<00:01:17.180> the

sidelines

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140 
sidelines

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:19.600 
sidelines
in<00:01:18.350> the<00:01:18.500> commodities<00:01:18.920> and<00:01:19.100> those<00:01:19.310> underlying

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 
in the commodities and those underlying

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.640 
in the commodities and those underlying
companies<00:01:20.299> because<00:01:20.750> where's<00:01:21.200> the<00:01:21.380> market

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:21.650 
companies because where's the market

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:23.080 
companies because where's the market
going<00:01:21.799> next<00:01:21.979> they<00:01:22.159> don't<00:01:22.340> know<00:01:22.490> if<00:01:22.820> you<00:01:22.939> don't

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
going next they don't know if you don't

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:24.999 
going next they don't know if you don't
know<00:01:23.299> you<00:01:23.360> shouldn't<00:01:23.689> be<00:01:23.810> in<00:01:23.900> it<00:01:23.990> so<00:01:24.650> it's<00:01:24.920> a

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:25.009 
know you shouldn't be in it so it's a

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:27.490 
know you shouldn't be in it so it's a
very<00:01:25.670> much<00:01:25.729> like<00:01:26.030> that<00:01:26.179> still<00:01:26.570> I<00:01:26.750> think<00:01:27.170> Gold's

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
very much like that still I think Gold's

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.450 
very much like that still I think Gold's
at<00:01:28.060> 12:40<00:01:29.060> or<00:01:29.240> 12:45<00:01:29.960> this<00:01:29.990> morning<00:01:30.320> so<00:01:30.859> it's

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.460 
at 12:40 or 12:45 this morning so it's

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:32.740 
at 12:40 or 12:45 this morning so it's
been<00:01:31.609> there<00:01:31.759> for<00:01:31.969> quite<00:01:32.060> a<00:01:32.119> while<00:01:32.270> treading

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
been there for quite a while treading

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.450 
been there for quite a while treading
water<00:01:32.929> and<00:01:33.259> that<00:01:33.409> and<00:01:33.649> a<00:01:33.740> new<00:01:33.890> trading<00:01:34.189> range

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
water and that and a new trading range

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:35.889 
water and that and a new trading range
there<00:01:34.759> and<00:01:34.939> I<00:01:34.969> think<00:01:35.179> until<00:01:35.270> we<00:01:35.420> see<00:01:35.539> breakout

00:01:35.889 --> 00:01:35.899 
there and I think until we see breakout

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:36.639 
there and I think until we see breakout
one<00:01:36.079> way<00:01:36.229> or<00:01:36.320> the<00:01:36.380> other

00:01:36.639 --> 00:01:36.649 
one way or the other

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:38.980 
one way or the other
it's<00:01:37.070> difficult<00:01:37.340> to<00:01:37.850> say<00:01:38.390> where<00:01:38.570> it's<00:01:38.689> going

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
it's difficult to say where it's going

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:40.450 
it's difficult to say where it's going
then<00:01:39.259> you<00:01:39.350> look<00:01:39.469> at<00:01:39.560> the<00:01:39.619> base<00:01:39.770> metals<00:01:40.159> always

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
then you look at the base metals always

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.219 
then you look at the base metals always
very<00:01:40.670> interesting<00:01:41.060> you<00:01:41.450> know<00:01:41.570> coppers<00:01:41.960> o<00:01:42.079> was

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:42.229 
very interesting you know coppers o was

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:43.239 
very interesting you know coppers o was
obviously<00:01:42.560> one<00:01:42.710> that<00:01:42.799> you<00:01:42.890> pay<00:01:43.009> a<00:01:43.039> lot<00:01:43.219> of

00:01:43.239 --> 00:01:43.249 
obviously one that you pay a lot of

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:45.999 
obviously one that you pay a lot of
attention<00:01:43.310> to<00:01:43.749> again<00:01:44.749> very<00:01:45.289> reliant<00:01:45.679> on

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009 
attention to again very reliant on

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:48.310 
attention to again very reliant on
what's<00:01:46.549> being<00:01:46.759> said<00:01:47.149> out<00:01:47.509> of<00:01:47.570> the<00:01:47.719> US

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320 
what's being said out of the US

which both came out this morning Chinese
came<00:01:52.880> in<00:01:53.090> Chinese<00:01:53.719> manufacturing<00:01:54.229> data<00:01:55.100> came

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
came in Chinese manufacturing data came

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.819 
came in Chinese manufacturing data came
out<00:01:55.460> better<00:01:55.670> than<00:01:55.880> expected<00:01:56.319> and<00:01:57.319> the<00:01:57.499> u.s.

00:01:57.819 --> 00:01:57.829 
out better than expected and the u.s.

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:00.099 
out better than expected and the u.s.
came<00:01:58.100> out<00:01:58.249> slightly<00:01:58.579> lower<00:01:59.090> than<00:01:59.179> expected<00:01:59.420> so

00:02:00.099 --> 00:02:00.109 
came out slightly lower than expected so

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:03.190 
came out slightly lower than expected so
kind<00:02:00.859> of<00:02:00.950> ends<00:02:01.100> up<00:02:01.369> same<00:02:02.299> problem<00:02:02.689> exactly

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
kind of ends up same problem exactly

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.779 
kind of ends up same problem exactly
exactly<00:02:03.920> where<00:02:04.100> where<00:02:04.310> are<00:02:04.399> they<00:02:04.520> going

00:02:04.779 --> 00:02:04.789 
exactly where where are they going

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:06.429 
exactly where where are they going
everyone<00:02:05.060> wants<00:02:05.329> to<00:02:05.359> see<00:02:05.569> the<00:02:05.600> US<00:02:06.020> grow<00:02:06.289> of

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:06.439 
everyone wants to see the US grow of

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:07.569 
everyone wants to see the US grow of
course<00:02:06.679> we<00:02:06.859> always<00:02:06.950> want<00:02:07.159> to<00:02:07.189> see<00:02:07.310> the<00:02:07.340> grow

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:07.579 
course we always want to see the grow

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:09.160 
course we always want to see the grow
because<00:02:07.789> it's<00:02:07.939> the<00:02:07.999> engine<00:02:08.360> but<00:02:08.720> China's<00:02:09.080> very

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
because it's the engine but China's very

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:10.930 
because it's the engine but China's very
much<00:02:09.410> the<00:02:09.619> next<00:02:09.890> engine<00:02:10.100> of<00:02:10.490> the<00:02:10.729> world

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
much the next engine of the world

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:11.530 
much the next engine of the world
economy

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
economy

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.990 
economy
so<00:02:12.050> like<00:02:12.380> this<00:02:12.470> morning<00:02:12.680> the<00:02:12.830> TSX<00:02:13.190> is<00:02:13.340> up<00:02:13.490> base

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
so like this morning the TSX is up base

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.180 
so like this morning the TSX is up base
metals<00:02:14.390> are<00:02:14.600> up<00:02:14.810> in<00:02:15.080> general<00:02:15.319> because<00:02:15.860> people

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
metals are up in general because people

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:17.230 
metals are up in general because people
are<00:02:16.310> putting<00:02:16.550> more<00:02:16.730> more<00:02:16.850> emphasis<00:02:17.120> on<00:02:17.180> that

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:17.240 
are putting more more emphasis on that

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.600 
are putting more more emphasis on that
Chinese<00:02:17.690> manufacturing<00:02:18.319> data<00:02:18.410> as<00:02:18.890> their<00:02:19.430> big

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
Chinese manufacturing data as their big

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.220 
Chinese manufacturing data as their big
consumers<00:02:20.090> copper<00:02:20.510> especially<00:02:20.990> in<00:02:21.080> base

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
consumers copper especially in base

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:22.720 
consumers copper especially in base
metals<00:02:21.620> other<00:02:21.709> base<00:02:21.890> miles<00:02:22.100> like<00:02:22.310> that

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
metals other base miles like that

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.720 
metals other base miles like that
so<00:02:23.060> yes<00:02:23.209> it's<00:02:23.660> quite<00:02:23.750> interesting<00:02:24.260> to<00:02:24.380> see<00:02:24.730> how

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
so yes it's quite interesting to see how

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.430 
so yes it's quite interesting to see how
things<00:02:26.030> haven't<00:02:26.480> really<00:02:26.540> changed<00:02:26.690> much<00:02:27.260> for

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
things haven't really changed much for

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:28.690 
things haven't really changed much for
the<00:02:27.500> last<00:02:27.650> couple<00:02:27.950> years<00:02:27.980> from<00:02:28.250> that<00:02:28.280> point<00:02:28.580> of

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
the last couple years from that point of

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.420 
the last couple years from that point of
view<00:02:28.790> it's<00:02:29.030> a<00:02:29.270> lot<00:02:29.600> of<00:02:29.890> cautious<00:02:30.890> on<00:02:31.040> the<00:02:31.190> side

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
view it's a lot of cautious on the side

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.220 
view it's a lot of cautious on the side
where<00:02:31.880> are<00:02:31.940> we<00:02:32.030> going<00:02:32.240> next<00:02:32.420> well<00:02:33.020> you<00:02:33.170> know

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
where are we going next well you know

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:34.950 
where are we going next well you know
when<00:02:33.350> you<00:02:33.440> look<00:02:33.590> at<00:02:33.800> the<00:02:33.980> June

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:34.960 
when you look at the June

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.140 
when you look at the June
you<00:02:35.200> know<00:02:35.319> the<00:02:35.500> last<00:02:35.710> couple<00:02:36.100> years<00:02:36.160> obviously

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
you know the last couple years obviously

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.150 
you know the last couple years obviously
been<00:02:37.300> very<00:02:37.600> very<00:02:37.810> rough<00:02:38.170> years<00:02:38.500> do<00:02:38.740> you<00:02:38.860> see

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
been very very rough years do you see

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.790 
been very very rough years do you see
that<00:02:39.370> we<00:02:39.550> are<00:02:39.819> at<00:02:40.810> MIT<00:02:41.110> this<00:02:41.290> is<00:02:41.380> a<00:02:41.410> question

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
that we are at MIT this is a question

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.080 
that we are at MIT this is a question
that<00:02:41.830> you<00:02:42.220> know<00:02:42.340> we've<00:02:42.490> been<00:02:42.580> talking<00:02:42.760> about

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
that you know we've been talking about

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:44.880 
that you know we've been talking about
this<00:02:43.420> is<00:02:43.660> been<00:02:43.900> the<00:02:44.050> question<00:02:44.440> for<00:02:44.620> the<00:02:44.680> past

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
this is been the question for the past

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.309 
this is been the question for the past
two<00:02:45.130> years<00:02:45.340> so<00:02:45.610> are<00:02:45.819> we<00:02:46.030> in<00:02:46.180> recovery<00:02:46.690> now<00:02:46.990> and

00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:47.319 
two years so are we in recovery now and

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:50.130 
two years so are we in recovery now and
or<00:02:47.950> is<00:02:48.220> it<00:02:48.490> a<00:02:48.730> longer<00:02:49.240> term<00:02:49.540> play

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
or is it a longer term play

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.830 
or is it a longer term play
I<00:02:50.170> think<00:02:50.650> the<00:02:50.830> tsx<00:02:51.430> venture<00:02:51.520> as<00:02:52.030> an<00:02:52.300> index<00:02:52.660> has

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
I think the tsx venture as an index has

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.930 
I think the tsx venture as an index has
has<00:02:53.260> hit<00:02:53.470> the<00:02:53.590> bottom<00:02:53.860> and<00:02:54.520> probably<00:02:54.820> hit<00:02:54.910> the

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
has hit the bottom and probably hit the

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.990 
has hit the bottom and probably hit the
bottom<00:02:55.330> second<00:02:56.200> half<00:02:56.350> of<00:02:56.500> last<00:02:56.650> year<00:02:57.070> I<00:02:57.550> had<00:02:57.970> a

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
bottom second half of last year I had a

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.479 
bottom second half of last year I had a
reasonably<00:02:58.990> good<00:02:59.110> first<00:02:59.709> quarter<00:03:00.100> this<00:03:00.220> year

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489 
reasonably good first quarter this year

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:02.790 
reasonably good first quarter this year
and<00:03:00.670> now<00:03:00.760> things<00:03:01.000> have<00:03:01.209> cooled<00:03:01.360> off<00:03:01.600> again<00:03:01.930> I

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800 
and now things have cooled off again I

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.050 
and now things have cooled off again I
think<00:03:03.130> when<00:03:03.280> you<00:03:03.340> get<00:03:03.400> into<00:03:03.819> the<00:03:03.910> more

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
think when you get into the more

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.440 
think when you get into the more
individual<00:03:05.130> venture<00:03:06.130> companies<00:03:06.610> is<00:03:07.090> very

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
individual venture companies is very

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.650 
individual venture companies is very
much<00:03:07.720> still<00:03:08.170> down<00:03:08.470> to<00:03:09.060> quality<00:03:10.060> management

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
much still down to quality management

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.690 
much still down to quality management
quality<00:03:10.930> of<00:03:11.050> project<00:03:11.620> you<00:03:12.040> know<00:03:12.160> what<00:03:12.580> are

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
quality of project you know what are

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.400 
quality of project you know what are
they<00:03:12.760> doing<00:03:13.120> are<00:03:13.390> they<00:03:13.600> able<00:03:13.810> to<00:03:13.959> raise<00:03:14.140> money

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
they doing are they able to raise money

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:16.680 
they doing are they able to raise money
and<00:03:15.010> that<00:03:15.250> still<00:03:15.580> remains<00:03:15.910> a<00:03:16.060> big<00:03:16.209> challenge

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
and that still remains a big challenge

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:18.300 
and that still remains a big challenge
though<00:03:16.900> for<00:03:17.200> a<00:03:17.230> lot<00:03:17.560> of<00:03:17.590> the<00:03:17.769> companies<00:03:18.160> is

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
though for a lot of the companies is

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:19.920 
though for a lot of the companies is
just<00:03:18.519> being<00:03:18.730> able<00:03:18.820> to<00:03:18.940> get<00:03:19.090> that<00:03:19.239> financing

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
just being able to get that financing

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:21.120 
just being able to get that financing
absolutely<00:03:20.320> it's<00:03:20.440> still<00:03:20.560> a<00:03:20.590> big<00:03:20.739> challenge

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
absolutely it's still a big challenge

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:22.800 
absolutely it's still a big challenge
but<00:03:21.280> you<00:03:21.340> do<00:03:21.670> see<00:03:21.850> it<00:03:21.940> getting<00:03:22.090> done<00:03:22.360> it<00:03:22.660> takes

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
but you do see it getting done it takes

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:24.630 
but you do see it getting done it takes
longer<00:03:23.260> than<00:03:23.290> it<00:03:23.500> used<00:03:23.680> to<00:03:23.800> you<00:03:24.340> don't<00:03:24.489> see

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
longer than it used to you don't see

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.100 
longer than it used to you don't see
it's<00:03:24.760> been<00:03:24.940> nearly<00:03:25.180> as<00:03:25.300> many<00:03:25.420> bought<00:03:25.690> deals<00:03:25.930> as

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:26.110 
it's been nearly as many bought deals as
