safe to say this is that was complex
x-men<00:00:12.960> films<00:00:13.290> thus<00:00:13.530> far<00:00:13.910> were<00:00:14.910> you<00:00:15.030> familiar

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
with the original storyline not when I

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.790 
with the original storyline not when I
first<00:00:18.539> heard<00:00:18.720> about<00:00:18.840> it<00:00:19.050> I<00:00:19.380> was<00:00:19.410> actually

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
first heard about it I was actually

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.050 
first heard about it I was actually
shooting<00:00:19.920> Wolverine<00:00:20.369> in<00:00:20.490> Australia<00:00:20.910> they

shooting Wolverine in Australia they

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.210 
shooting Wolverine in Australia they
told<00:00:21.270> me<00:00:21.449> about<00:00:22.020> the<00:00:22.289> idea<00:00:22.619> and<00:00:22.830> I<00:00:22.890> immediately

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
told me about the idea and I immediately

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.970 
told me about the idea and I immediately
was<00:00:24.119> sent<00:00:24.330> like<00:00:24.480> a<00:00:24.510> one-page<00:00:25.080> synopsis<00:00:25.320> on<00:00:25.800> it

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
was sent like a one-page synopsis on it

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.189 
was sent like a one-page synopsis on it
and<00:00:26.250> I<00:00:26.609> was<00:00:26.730> like<00:00:26.849> I<00:00:26.970> mean<00:00:27.150> there<00:00:27.689> first<00:00:27.900> of<00:00:28.019> all

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
and I was like I mean there first of all

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.320 
and I was like I mean there first of all
it<00:00:28.830> would<00:00:29.010> have<00:00:29.099> been<00:00:29.220> really<00:00:29.429> hard<00:00:29.760> to<00:00:30.029> turn

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
it would have been really hard to turn

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.120 
it would have been really hard to turn
down<00:00:30.390> anyway<00:00:30.900> the<00:00:31.050> idea<00:00:31.080> of<00:00:31.650> having<00:00:31.830> Brian

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
down anyway the idea of having Brian

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.860 
down anyway the idea of having Brian
come<00:00:32.399> back<00:00:32.520> with<00:00:32.700> the<00:00:32.820> entire<00:00:33.090> cast<00:00:33.390> and<00:00:33.570> a<00:00:33.690> new

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
come back with the entire cast and a new

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.510 
come back with the entire cast and a new
cast<00:00:34.110> was<00:00:34.410> probably<00:00:34.980> enough<00:00:35.219> to<00:00:35.250> get<00:00:35.460> me

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
cast was probably enough to get me

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.970 
cast was probably enough to get me
across<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:35.760> line<00:00:36.030> but<00:00:36.210> either<00:00:37.110> so<00:00:37.559> this<00:00:37.739> is

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
across the line but either so this is

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.400 
across the line but either so this is
such<00:00:38.280> a<00:00:38.309> brilliant<00:00:38.850> idea<00:00:39.390> in<00:00:39.809> every<00:00:40.050> way<00:00:40.170> it

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
such a brilliant idea in every way it

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.110 
such a brilliant idea in every way it
feels<00:00:40.649> so<00:00:40.920> organic<00:00:41.550> as<00:00:41.670> a<00:00:41.700> way<00:00:41.850> to<00:00:41.910> bring

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
feels so organic as a way to bring

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.110 
feels so organic as a way to bring
everyone<00:00:42.360> together<00:00:42.570> and<00:00:42.960> smart<00:00:43.920> and<00:00:44.219> the

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
mikhyl and complex thing and and you

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.200 
mikhyl and complex thing and and you
can't<00:01:18.990> sort<00:01:19.890> of<00:01:19.979> underestimate<00:01:20.640> how<00:01:20.820> hard<00:01:21.090> it

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
what it is 15 16 main characters mm-hmm

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.980 
what it is 15 16 main characters mm-hmm
you<00:01:25.860> know<00:01:25.950> that's<00:01:26.130> a<00:01:26.220> lot<00:01:26.430> in<00:01:26.759> two<00:01:27.570> hour<00:01:27.720> period

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
you know that's a lot in two hour period

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.499

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:31.880 
to tie up and I just think the film does
that<00:01:30.659> really<00:01:30.900> well<00:01:31.049> in<00:01:31.229> an<00:01:31.380> interesting<00:01:31.590> way

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
that really well in an interesting way

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.859 
that really well in an interesting way
