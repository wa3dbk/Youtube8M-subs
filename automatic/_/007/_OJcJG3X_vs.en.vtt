00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.059
 very good to everyone how are you amy me 

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:17.789
 happens that we are with another new video of 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:21.210
 how can we do to have the 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:24.210
 two bicycles either the acrobatic bike 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:27.930
 or bike race here I'm going to 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:33.250
 teach how you see we can have the 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:36.550
 two and so use and change then 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:39.190
 from one to another and that's what we have to 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.940
 do so now I will explain it to you in 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:43.250
 this video 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.199
 what we have to do is talk to 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.210
 three people who are all over 

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:50.539
 the world the first of them is the 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:52.730
 Route 111 in the desert lies 

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:54.890
 here in this rock as you see in the image 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:58.190
 I do not get it because once we talk 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:00.469
 with them they disappear and they do not return to 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.629
 appear if we return as you see I have already 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:05.299
 talked to her and that's why she does not appear 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:08.600
 and it would appear in the desert in the 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:11.240
 route 111 the next person is in the 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:14.630
 route 119 here we will have to go with the 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.850
 acrobatic bicycle and once here 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.670
 we have to have a pokÃ©mon that knows 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:22.310
 surf and another pokemon that knows waterfall 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:24.440
 because here if you look when we do 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:28.179
 here surf at the end of everything there is a 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.179
 waterfall and we have to climb it 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.040
 ah 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.970
 once here we will have to use the 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.440
 acrobatic bicycle and as you can see 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.659
 first time you arrive then not 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:52.390
 we can pass because there is something that we 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:54.369
 prevents the passage and we will have to use 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:57.430
 the mont detector that will deliver it to us 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:59.259
 maximum and as you can see here is a pokemon 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:01.450
 invisible once we have the detector 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:05.670
 of bonn we can see what kind of pokemon 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.670
 It is and it is a wild Cleon 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:12.180
 once we have removed from the middle 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:15.570
 pokemon we can go through here with 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:19.260
 the acrobatic bicycle if we go through 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:22.440
 the first passage that there is as you see by 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:25.400
 here, here we will find an mt that 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:28.230
 will be the acrobat emt as you are seeing 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.870
 then to where we need to find 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:33.540
 that person is on the second side in 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:36.030
 the second catwalk we're seeing 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.630
 around here we will go here and here you will find 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:41.320
 well as 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:43.390
 a Uruguayan coach or something like that and 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:46.210
 if we talk to him, he will tell us that 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:48.160
 the bike is cool and so is this 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:50.800
 way then we will have the second 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.870
 person was going to for the third the 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:55.330
 third and last person is in 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.860
 the battle resort and to get up 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:59.320
 here you must have completed the 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:01.060
 pokemon league and have spent the chapter 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:03.130
 high we will have to talk to this 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:06.160
 cyclist here if we have the 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:08.830
 acrobatic bicycle when we talk to 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:11.920
 he will be the last person 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:14.290
 let's have so to be able to like this 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.360
 way to get two 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.880
 bicycles both the acrobatic bicycle 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:22.100
 as the races later we will have to 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:25.490
 talk here with the clerk d 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:26.930
 of the bicycles and then as 

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:28.580
 you are seeing then thank you that the 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:31.070
 business that has been selling 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:33.080
 thanks to our advertising because we 

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:35.780
 will deliver if we have one then we 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:38.930
 will deliver the other and as you see here I will 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:41.600
 I'm going to teach that we'll have two 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:45.370
 as you see here the race bike 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:47.530
 without the acrobatic bicycle as you see 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.299
 and well, that's all I hope you 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:51.640
 has helped this video of 

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:54.489
 how can we do to get 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:58.450
 the two bicycles both the bicycle 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:04:00.430
 acrobatic like bicycle racing 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:02.440
 that thus it will serve us for our 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:05.120
 adventure and much easier and we do not have 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:07.159
 to go then at every moment 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.750
 with the gentleman of the store so that 

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:10.819
 bike we change from one to another 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:13.670
 well in this way then we can 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:16.280
 get the two bikes either one 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:18.530
 or the other and you know I hope that I have 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:22.030

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:22.030
