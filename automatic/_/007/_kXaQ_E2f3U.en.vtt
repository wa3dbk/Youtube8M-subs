 protection for what it is that we with more 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:41.760
 days at the beginning of the game do not 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:44.969
 need many items like this and for 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.340
 this they can of pharmaton co-decision 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.030
 equal and who needs to load the 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.780
 I do not play 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.850
 the sitter left him he will only try 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.719
 provide protection for load 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:00.500
 end of the game the main and the baby 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:03.600
 sitter right are certainly not orders 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:06.030

 keep the game in sight 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.189
 the center to be able to change the world 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:15.900
 hordes of enemies and if they require 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:17.970
 a new team to kill you too 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:23.340
 smoke that is a very good item for you 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:26.280
 enemy local power and have to 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:30.540
 your hero even I think only one boot 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.740
 it's already quite an area so if you 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:36.509
 be playing babysitter 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.409
 do not wait t2 question is to have much 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:41.130
 assurance 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:43.340
 so let's go there 1 in the morning it was explained 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.340
 best 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:50.640
 Look at the baby if he should look 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:55.610
 first put words to play 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:58.680
 in the view of its allies and and 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:01.530
 also provide the defense of what the 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.240
 that he can not take much damage in law 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.370
 No, because you will not be able to do it tomorrow. 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.830
 then you should keep pressure on your 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:10.020
 enemies in the field the way it was said 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:12.840
 that the radar all strong 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:18.480
 It's just leaving the enemies behind is in the 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:20.310
 can not let anyone beat the hero is 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.260
 a very easy way for you to take 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.000
 Your enemies, and at the same time 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.620
 dry weather beyond 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.380
 You have to be careful that you do not 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:31.200
 doing that cool is simple, huh? 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:34.800
 with just a pixel web brings you 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:38.700
 we are moving forward and I talked about the tips 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:40.560
 two basic then it is recommended 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:47.610
 is not here until then doing good 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:51.390
 Cuba will not be totally poor in the 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:53.610
 game and will provide your 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.989
 protection of the tower is in case the 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:58.440
 do not get near him 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:03:03.570
 so yes it is a recommended way of 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:05.610
 make the game but it ended up recommending 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:08.130
 Press it again, right? 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:11.190
 so the only enemies will continue 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:15.230
 does not win from xp and said i want 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:15.230
 to get famous easily, right? 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:21.300
 safe way in the game is you can 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:24.720
 call someone else paying case beyond 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:27.930
 Someone wants to attack and then you go along. 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:31.380
 and then you can easily slaughter the 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:34.620
 enemies and and so will give xp gold that 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:37.080
 I'm a warrior, it will not matter much. 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.630
 you if you who is the support die 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:42.150
 the important thing is what is considered 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:43.920
 mirror where even he does not 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.269
 I could only kill to spoil myself 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.420
 I got a good football 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:50.910
 So look, you 're always calling someone. 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:55.840
 ask to be able to position 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:59.379
 because it 's an easier game, right? 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:01.540
 always look to leave what is and is 

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:03.099
 possibility to stay in xp alone, right? 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.650
 so stay more or less in the bush and 

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:08.940
 arise opportunity you seek to kill 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:11.769
 the enemies as easily as possible 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:13.720
 go out into the woods and try to 

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:16.570
 points you get gauche cesinha 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:18.250
 ass but first try to leave 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:20.470
 which is more only when it's loose 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:26.080
 alone nothing while you do not need to 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:27.970
 enemies is a very strong point of be 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:30.550
 if you have it it always has to be 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:36.430
 buying at rest 11 to be able to have 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:40.180
 view of the game then enemies is quite easy 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:41.740
 and get more xp and more good 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:44.860
 salaried people, right? 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:48.220

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:51.960
 Sometimes winning a game is for you always. 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:55.030
 potal waiting for the enemy map and 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:58.050
