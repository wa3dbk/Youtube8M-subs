00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
replanted it the other day is probably a

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:14.000 
replanted it the other day is probably a
good<00:03:10.739> three<00:03:11.160> feet<00:03:11.870> and<00:03:12.870> this<00:03:13.230> is<00:03:13.410> a<00:03:13.440> 4<00:03:13.769> feet

tank so I'd say mmm botsa there about

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:22.910 
tank so I'd say mmm botsa there about
that<00:03:20.010> long<00:03:20.450> it's<00:03:21.450> fully<00:03:21.840> stretched<00:03:22.230> out<00:03:22.500> okay

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920

kind of lay on the top but it's in the

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:33.530 
kind of lay on the top but it's in the
back<00:03:32.160> and<00:03:32.400> it's<00:03:32.550> browned<00:03:32.820> up<00:03:33.030> new<00:03:33.240> little
