 the mission of unesco consists of 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:41.180
 contribute to the consolidation of peace 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:43.730
 the eradication of poverty the 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:46.660
 sustainable development and dialogue 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.660
 intercultural 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:50.460
 we go

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.739
 Justice 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.190
 avoiding the privatization of 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:01:00.650
 knowledge and achieving its 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:03.650
 availability for the entire humanity 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:05.750
 there would be a fundamental impetus for the 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:09.980
 development of the poorest nations 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:14.380
 who do not need alms but talent 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:14.380

 he is more aware than me 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:23.090
 Given the power relations in force 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.500
 in the world and the current state of the 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.860
 humanity 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:32.110
 this is a utopia 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:36.210
 but unesco was born for utopias 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.210
 and as Eduardo Galiano says 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:41.180
 the Uruguayan and author of the veins

 latina 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:51.860
 utopia is like the horizon 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:55.920
 we march two steps and two more away 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:59.939
 we march 10 and it moves away 10 more 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:03.390
 So what is utopia for? 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:05.990
 It serves precisely for that to walk 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.990
