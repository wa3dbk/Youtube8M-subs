00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.620
The Mystery of the Missing Waves on Titan

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.980
Presented by Science at NASA

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.890
One of the most shocking discoveries of the past 10 years 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:17.140
is how much the landscape of Saturn's moon Titan resembles Earth. 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.950
Like our own blue planet, 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:21.720
the surface of Titan is dotted with lakes and seas; 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:28.450
it has river channels, islands, mud, rain clouds and maybe even rainbows. 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.200
The giant moon is undeniably wet.

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.330
The 'water' on Titan is not, however, H2O. 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:40.220
With a surface temperature dipping 290 degrees F below zero, 

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.840
Titan is far too cold for liquid water. 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.950
Instead, researchers believe the fluid that sculpts Titan 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.130
is an unknown mixture of methane, ethane, 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.990
and other hard-to-freeze hydrocarbons.

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.460
The idea that Titan is a wet world with its own alien waters 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.530
is widely accepted by planetary scientists. 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.430
Nothing else can account for the observations: 

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:10.740
NASA's Cassini spacecraft has flown by Titan more than 90 times since 2004, 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.500
pinging the Moon with radar 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.220
and mapping its lakes and seas. 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:19.080
ESA's Huygens probe parachuted to the surface of Titan in 2005, 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.110
descending through humid clouds 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.510
and actually landing in moist soil.

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:25.980
Yet something has been bothering Alex Hayes, 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.360
a planetary scientist on the Cassini radar team at Cornell University.

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.540
If Titan is really so wet, he wonders, 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.140
'Where are all the waves?'

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.760
Here on Earth, bodies of water are rarely still. 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.680
Breezes blowing across the surface 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.710
cause waves to ripple and break; 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:47.510
raindrops striking sea surfaces also provide some roughness. 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.310
Yet on Titan, 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:50.970
the lakes are eerily smooth, 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.070
with no discernable wave action down to the millimeter scale, 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.490
according to radar data from Cassini.

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:00.050
'We know there is wind on Titan,' says Hayes. 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.650
'The moon's magnificent sand dunes [prove] it.'

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.190
Add to that the low gravity of Titan-

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.250
only 1/7th that of Earth-

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:10.910
which offers so little resistance to wave motion, 

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:13.140
and you have a real puzzle. 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.730
Researchers have toyed with several explanations. 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.920
Perhaps the lakes are frozen. 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.580
Hayes thinks that is unlikely, however, 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.220
'because we see evidence of rainfall 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.250
and surface temperatures well above the melting point of methane.' 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:29.750
Or maybe the lakes are covered with a tar-like substance 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:31.720
that damps wave motion. 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.420
'We can't yet rule that out,' he adds. 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.920
The answer might be found in the results of a study 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.870
Hayes and colleagues published in the July 2013 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.650
online edition of the journal Icarus. 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.930
Taking into account the gravity of Titan, 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.250
the low viscosity of liquid hydrocarbons, 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.240
the density of Titan's atmosphere, 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.040
and other factors, 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.590
they calculated how fast wind on Titan would have to blow 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:57.040
to stir up waves: 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.750
A breeze of 1 to 2 mph should do the trick.

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:03.310
This suggests a third possibility: 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.480
the winds just haven't been blowing hard enough. 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.710
Since Cassini reached Saturn in 2004, 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:11.730
Titan's northern hemisphere 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.480
(where most of the lakes are located) 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.820
has been locked in the grip of winter. 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.790
Cold heavy air barely stirs, 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.050
and seldom reaches the threshold for wave-making.

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:24.310
But now the seasons are changing. 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:29.470
In August 2009 the sun crossed Titan's equator heading north. 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:32.640
Summer is coming, bringing light, heat 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:35.080
and wind to Titan's 'lake country.'

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.360
'According to [climate models], 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.970
winds will pick up as we approach the solstice in 2017 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:43.940
and should be strong enough for waves,' he says.

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:45.670
If waves appear, 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:48.140
Cassini should be able to detect them. 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.370
Radar reflections from wavy lake surfaces 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:52.920
can tell researchers a great deal. 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:54.910
Wave dimensions, for instance, 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.810
may reveal the viscosity of the underlying fluid 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:00.430
and, thus, its chemical composition.

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:04.610
Hayes is excited about 'bringing oceanography to another world. 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:08.150
All we need now,' he says, 'are some rough seas.'

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:10.450

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.200
