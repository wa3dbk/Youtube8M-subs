I know his is our the weekend and so we
won't<00:02:07.720> be<00:02:07.810> able<00:02:07.869> to<00:02:08.020> kill<00:02:08.140> me<00:02:08.349> so<00:02:09.340> I<00:02:09.369> decided<00:02:09.880> to

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
won't be able to kill me so I decided to

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.770 
won't be able to kill me so I decided to
call<00:02:10.720> mind<00:02:11.430> but<00:02:12.430> it<00:02:12.550> pushes<00:02:12.910> into<00:02:13.239> a<00:02:13.330> blizzy

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
call mind but it pushes into a blizzy

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.770 
call mind but it pushes into a blizzy
and<00:02:14.610> it<00:02:15.610> takes<00:02:15.819> like<00:02:16.150> a<00:02:16.180> quarter<00:02:16.599> of<00:02:16.630> its

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
and it takes like a quarter of its

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.589 
and it takes like a quarter of its
health<00:02:16.989> from<00:02:17.290> Stelfox<00:02:17.980> and<00:02:18.190> spikes<00:02:18.480> which<00:02:19.480> is

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:19.599 
health from Stelfox and spikes which is

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:22.080 
health from Stelfox and spikes which is
pretty<00:02:19.750> cool<00:02:20.190> so<00:02:21.190> I<00:02:21.220> get<00:02:21.430> the<00:02:21.520> comm<00:02:21.670> line<00:02:21.880> on

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
pretty cool so I get the comm line on

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.500 
pretty cool so I get the comm line on
and<00:02:23.250> well<00:02:24.250> I<00:02:24.400> know<00:02:24.520> the<00:02:24.760> only<00:02:24.880> will<00:02:25.239> take<00:02:25.420> the

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
and well I know the only will take the

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.580 
and well I know the only will take the
thing<00:02:25.690> out<00:02:25.840> is<00:02:25.989> if<00:02:26.140> i<00:02:28.050> combine<00:02:29.050> a<00:02:29.230> whole<00:02:29.440> bunch

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
thing out is if i combine a whole bunch

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.680 
thing out is if i combine a whole bunch
of<00:02:29.680> times<00:02:29.890> and<00:02:30.250> then<00:02:30.819> try<00:02:31.060> to<00:02:31.090> start<00:02:31.420> wailing

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
of times and then try to start wailing

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.750 
of times and then try to start wailing
on<00:02:31.810> it<00:02:31.930> but<00:02:32.110> hexley<00:02:32.560> the<00:02:32.800> toxic<00:02:33.220> stalling<00:02:33.550> kind

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
on it but hexley the toxic stalling kind

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.790 
on it but hexley the toxic stalling kind
so<00:02:34.060> it's<00:02:34.930> toxic<00:02:35.230> off<00:02:35.560> and<00:02:37.440> he<00:02:38.440> goes<00:02:38.560> for<00:02:38.739> the

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
so it's toxic off and he goes for the

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.340 
so it's toxic off and he goes for the
protect<00:02:39.190> well<00:02:39.880> I<00:02:39.910> just<00:02:40.030> keep<00:02:40.569> calm<00:02:40.840> winding

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
protect well I just keep calm winding

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:44.550 
protect well I just keep calm winding
and<00:02:41.970> this<00:02:42.970> part<00:02:43.269> is<00:02:43.360> actually<00:02:43.630> kind<00:02:44.140> of<00:02:44.200> long<00:02:44.350> I

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
and this part is actually kind of long I

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.630 
and this part is actually kind of long I
think<00:02:45.060> so<00:02:46.060> it's<00:02:46.150> gonna<00:02:46.269> be<00:02:46.360> kind<00:02:46.510> of<00:02:46.540> boring

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
think so it's gonna be kind of boring

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:53.970 
think so it's gonna be kind of boring
because<00:02:48.640> it's<00:02:49.030> a<00:02:50.459> stalling<00:02:51.459> blissey<00:02:52.980> which

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
because it's a stalling blissey which

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.509 
because it's a stalling blissey which
are<00:02:54.220> boring<00:02:55.560> so<00:02:56.560> I<00:02:56.590> just<00:02:56.799> go<00:02:56.950> her<00:02:57.069> dragon<00:02:57.370> pulse

00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:57.519 
are boring so I just go her dragon pulse

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:01.710 
are boring so I just go her dragon pulse
just<00:02:58.209> start<00:02:58.630> doing<00:02:58.720> damage<00:02:59.019> to<00:02:59.170> it<00:02:59.440> and<00:03:00.480> it<00:03:01.480> did

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
just start doing damage to it and it did

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.130 
just start doing damage to it and it did
about<00:03:01.930> like<00:03:02.230> thirty<00:03:02.530> percent<00:03:02.799> of<00:03:02.920> itself<00:03:03.130> but

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
about like thirty percent of itself but

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:11.270 
about like thirty percent of itself but
um<00:03:06.120> kegels<00:03:07.120> and<00:03:07.480> remember<00:03:07.989> therapy<00:03:08.530> so<00:03:08.829> now

dragon pulls that turn so it like didn't
do<00:03:37.780> anything<00:03:37.959> because<00:03:38.260> he<00:03:38.590> would<00:03:38.709> protect<00:03:38.829> and

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:40.079 
do anything because he would protect and

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:42.830 
do anything because he would protect and
toxic<00:03:41.079> is<00:03:41.230> really<00:03:41.590> starting<00:03:42.070> to<00:03:42.130> hurt<00:03:42.190> a<00:03:42.340> lot
