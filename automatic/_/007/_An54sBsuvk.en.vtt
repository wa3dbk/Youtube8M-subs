is one good thing about him his mana
regen<00:04:34.380> is<00:04:34.560> pretty<00:04:34.860> slow<00:04:35.330> so<00:04:36.330> if<00:04:36.630> you<00:04:36.780> have<00:04:36.990> a

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
regen is pretty slow so if you have a

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:40.010 
regen is pretty slow so if you have a
class<00:04:37.440> or<00:04:37.770> some<00:04:38.310> ability<00:04:38.910> where<00:04:39.540> you<00:04:39.690> can't

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
class or some ability where you can't

class or some ability where you can't
drain<00:04:40.800> his<00:04:41.100> mana<00:04:41.460> or<00:04:41.850> in<00:04:42.390> other<00:04:43.080> way<00:04:43.910> keep<00:04:44.910> his

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:45.830 
drain his mana or in other way keep his

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:50.210 
drain his mana or in other way keep his
manner<00:04:46.830> down<00:04:47.930> you<00:04:48.930> can<00:04:49.140> actually<00:04:49.320> come<00:04:50.010> to<00:04:50.190> a

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 
manner down you can actually come to a

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.520 
manner down you can actually come to a
point<00:04:50.460> where<00:04:50.640> he's<00:04:51.000> fully<00:04:51.510> depleted<00:04:51.960> of<00:04:52.230> mana

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:52.530 
point where he's fully depleted of mana

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:57.020 
point where he's fully depleted of mana
and<00:04:53.090> he<00:04:54.090> can't<00:04:54.360> heal<00:04:54.630> his<00:04:54.780> comrade<00:04:55.850> this<00:04:56.850> is

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.030 
and he can't heal his comrade this is

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:59.780 
and he can't heal his comrade this is
pretty<00:04:57.240> good<00:04:57.350> because<00:04:58.350> if<00:04:59.100> you<00:04:59.280> come<00:04:59.580> to<00:04:59.610> a

00:04:59.780 --> 00:04:59.790 
pretty good because if you come to a

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:02.780 
pretty good because if you come to a
point<00:05:00.150> where<00:05:00.570> we<00:05:01.410> take<00:05:01.650> him<00:05:01.830> out<00:05:01.979> one<00:05:02.580> of<00:05:02.610> the

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:02.790 
point where we take him out one of the

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:06.050 
point where we take him out one of the
others<00:05:03.060> and<00:05:03.320> if<00:05:04.320> you're<00:05:04.470> unlucky<00:05:04.680> he<00:05:05.400> gets

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:06.060 
others and if you're unlucky he gets

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:10.340 
others and if you're unlucky he gets
heel<00:05:06.419> off<00:05:06.630> and<00:05:08.060> during<00:05:09.060> that<00:05:09.120> time<00:05:09.540> he<00:05:09.810> might

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:10.350 
heel off and during that time he might

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:14.600 
heel off and during that time he might
end<00:05:10.770> up<00:05:11.070> healing<00:05:11.520> himself<00:05:11.850> or<00:05:12.979> the<00:05:13.979> second<00:05:14.430> one

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:14.610 
end up healing himself or the second one

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:17.420 
end up healing himself or the second one
still<00:05:15.000> standing<00:05:15.180> and<00:05:15.830> you<00:05:16.830> don't<00:05:17.040> get<00:05:17.280> them

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:17.430 
still standing and you don't get them

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:19.940 
still standing and you don't get them
down<00:05:17.640> within<00:05:18.240> that<00:05:18.600> three<00:05:19.080> to<00:05:19.229> five<00:05:19.440> second

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:19.950 
down within that three to five second

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:24.540 
down within that three to five second
window<00:05:20.310> and<00:05:20.960> he's<00:05:21.960> going<00:05:22.169> to<00:05:22.260> respawn<00:05:22.650> again

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:24.550 
window and he's going to respawn again

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:27.990 
window and he's going to respawn again
so<00:05:25.180> if<00:05:25.900> that<00:05:26.260> happens<00:05:26.800> the<00:05:27.220> best<00:05:27.520> thing<00:05:27.850> you

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:28.000 
so if that happens the best thing you

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.690 
so if that happens the best thing you
can<00:05:28.120> do<00:05:28.300> instead<00:05:28.750> of<00:05:28.870> keeping<00:05:29.140> to<00:05:29.530> try<00:05:29.800> and

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:30.700 
can do instead of keeping to try and

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:33.840 
can do instead of keeping to try and
getting<00:05:31.120> them<00:05:31.270> down<00:05:31.540> if<00:05:32.110> you<00:05:33.010> can<00:05:33.310> roll<00:05:33.820> over

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:33.850 
getting them down if you can roll over

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:36.510 
getting them down if you can roll over
or<00:05:34.210> in<00:05:34.660> some<00:05:34.900> other<00:05:35.110> way<00:05:35.410> to<00:05:35.440> stop<00:05:36.010> the<00:05:36.250> fight

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:36.520 
or in some other way to stop the fight

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.540 
or in some other way to stop the fight
so<00:05:36.910> they<00:05:37.260> reset<00:05:38.260> that's<00:05:38.890> actually<00:05:39.340> the<00:05:39.460> best

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:39.550 
so they reset that's actually the best

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:43.080 
so they reset that's actually the best
thing<00:05:39.700> to<00:05:39.850> do<00:05:41.100> the<00:05:42.100> second<00:05:42.460> mode<00:05:42.700> the<00:05:42.850> last

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:43.090 
thing to do the second mode the last

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:45.690 
thing to do the second mode the last
time<00:05:43.300> I<00:05:43.330> was<00:05:43.600> doing<00:05:43.870> these<00:05:43.990> guys<00:05:44.260> I<00:05:44.680> got<00:05:45.550> them

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:45.700 
time I was doing these guys I got them

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:50.040 
time I was doing these guys I got them
down<00:05:45.910> but<00:05:46.900> not<00:05:47.860> within<00:05:48.130> the<00:05:48.330> the<00:05:49.330> window<00:05:49.720> that

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:50.050 
down but not within the the window that

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:52.050 
down but not within the the window that
I<00:05:50.080> have<00:05:50.650> to<00:05:50.830> get<00:05:50.980> them<00:05:51.130> down<00:05:51.340> and<00:05:51.580> they<00:05:51.790> came<00:05:52.030> up

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:52.060 
I have to get them down and they came up

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:55.950 
I have to get them down and they came up
to<00:05:52.510> to<00:05:53.290> respawn<00:05:54.130> no<00:05:54.400> 60<00:05:54.790> points<00:05:55.180> sixty<00:05:55.870> percent

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:55.960 
to to respawn no 60 points sixty percent

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:59.250 
to to respawn no 60 points sixty percent
of<00:05:56.320> health<00:05:56.650> again<00:05:56.950> and<00:05:57.310> it<00:05:58.300> was<00:05:58.840> simply

00:05:59.250 --> 00:05:59.260 
of health again and it was simply

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:06.090 
of health again and it was simply
impossible<00:06:00.960> to<00:06:01.960> control<00:06:02.940> at<00:06:03.940> this<00:06:04.270> point<00:06:04.860> so<00:06:05.860> I

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:06.100 
impossible to control at this point so I

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:08.210 
impossible to control at this point so I
just<00:06:06.460> gave<00:06:06.700> up

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:08.220 
just gave up

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:10.790 
just gave up
now<00:06:08.820> if<00:06:09.210> you<00:06:09.420> do<00:06:09.630> get<00:06:09.840> these<00:06:10.050> three<00:06:10.260> guys<00:06:10.440> down

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:10.800 
now if you do get these three guys down

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:14.900 
now if you do get these three guys down
you<00:06:11.520> come<00:06:11.820> to<00:06:12.330> a<00:06:12.540> second<00:06:13.230> phase<00:06:13.470> where<00:06:14.430> a<00:06:14.700> guy

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:14.910 
you come to a second phase where a guy

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:19.190 
you come to a second phase where a guy
spawns<00:06:15.390> and<00:06:16.670> this<00:06:17.670> fight<00:06:17.910> it's<00:06:18.270> actually

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:19.200 
spawns and this fight it's actually

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:21.890 
spawns and this fight it's actually
pretty<00:06:19.380> much<00:06:19.650> a<00:06:19.920> tank<00:06:20.700> and<00:06:20.910> spank<00:06:20.970> this

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:21.900 
pretty much a tank and spank this

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:24.770 
pretty much a tank and spank this
shouldn't<00:06:22.260> be<00:06:22.320> a<00:06:22.410> big<00:06:22.650> problem<00:06:22.800> and<00:06:23.570> when<00:06:24.570> he's

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:24.780 
shouldn't be a big problem and when he's

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:29.660 
shouldn't be a big problem and when he's
down<00:06:25.670> you<00:06:26.670> loop<00:06:26.910> the<00:06:27.500> boss<00:06:28.500> and<00:06:28.830> if<00:06:29.430> you're

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:29.670 
down you loop the boss and if you're

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:33.950 
down you loop the boss and if you're
lucky<00:06:29.850> the<00:06:30.540> amount<00:06:30.750> is<00:06:30.900> going<00:06:31.110> to<00:06:31.200> drop

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:33.960 

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:38.330
