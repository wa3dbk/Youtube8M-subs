00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:03.920
 d 

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:11.100
 the national state meteorological service 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.200
 is reporting on the weakness that 

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.550
 presents the front number 30 already in the 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.620
 North and Northeast of the Mexican Republic 

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:18.570
 and is losing the loss intensity is 

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:20.490
 dissipates in this region the mass of 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.080
 cold air that has not generated will continue 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.390
 going into the all of the north 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.410
 is where we will continue waiting 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.390
 very low temperatures for these 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.090
 states in the moisture input look 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.500
 you conjugate with this situation and 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.020
 We wait some rainfall 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.510
 moderate to strong in coahuila in new 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.500
 lion and in the state of Tamaulipas 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.179
 we will wait for that condition of 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.949
 rainfall also the entrance of 

00:00:39.179 --> 00:00:42.749
 humidity as you can see in this 

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:44.010
 series of satellite images follows 

00:00:42.749 --> 00:00:46.679
 dominating most of the republic 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.870
 Mexican waiting for some sky beyond 

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:49.679
 of the cloudy afternoon 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:53.789
 mainly in eastern states 

00:00:49.679 --> 00:00:55.649
 from the southeast and the yucatan peninsula 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.769
 here rainfalls that go from light 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:01.109
 to occasionally moderate as long as 

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:02.999
 the temperatures we already said in the 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.700
 northern end of the Pacific coast or 

00:01:02.999 --> 00:01:09.300
 be the most northwest of the country is a 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:13.740
 value are the neighborhoods of temperature 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:17.040
 nice look at you 24 28 23 nice 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.620
 but in the north you observe less 4 to 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.720
 14 is a very low ambient temperature 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:23.370
 very cold and this immediately indicates 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.560
 that the cold air mass of these 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:27.360
 systems still dominates most 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.120
 from the Mexican Republic to the 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.580
 northeast also cold temperate morning 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:34.740
 the rest of the day the sky half cloudy 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.090
 some rainfall this means 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.740
 cloudy can reach up to a cloudy 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.260
 in coahuila new tonic with 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.540
 heavy rainfall towards what is 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.590
 this region of the center of the country the sky 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.900
 clear to partly cloudy 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.340
 precipitations very dispersed by the 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.670
 late with relatively warm temperatures 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.050
 low in the west almost clean a 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.520
 sky with some clouds in the afternoon 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.410
 mainly but most of the 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.510
 very sunny day warm temperatures 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:58.830
 to hot in what is the center 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:00.330
 cool in the morning temperatures 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.670
 maximums that reach the scale of 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.890
 tempered just as in the south of 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.780
 shoreline of the Pacific or in fact the 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.570
 good warrior status continue as the 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.850
 really very nice up to 32-33 the 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:15.050
 maximum temperature in this region of the 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:18.090
 Mexican Republic little humidity 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.140
 the south that half cloudy rainfall 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.810
 that are directed occasionally 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.849
 moderate as in the peninsula 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.580
 of Yucatan temperatures that you 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:28.560
 already exceed in some points the 30 33 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.900
 degrees maximum temperature 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.879
 very warm environment very, very, very 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.890
 nice for the capital of the 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:36.870
 Mexican Republic we are still waiting 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.220
 temperatures in the morning relatively 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.140
 low are not many but yes 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.519
 relatively cool fresh in the morning 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.860
 that at some point you can feel 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:46.019
 even cold but with these values of 7 to 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.329
 8 degrees the non-industrial maximum that to 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:50.459
 the 23 22 23 degree maximum temperature 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:52.290
 here in the capital of the republic 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:54.450
 Mexican with a sky with a sky 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.549
 mostly clear very sunny by the 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.170
 late we are still waiting for something again 

00:02:56.549 --> 00:03:00.930
 city in the city of mexico but good 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.579
 part of the day very, very sunny is what 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:06.440
 most important that we have to you from 

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:06.440
 the national meteorological service 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.290
 and 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:14.599
 with water
