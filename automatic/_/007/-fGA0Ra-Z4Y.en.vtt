the ADIZ if off the tiles as well so it

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.770 
the ADIZ if off the tiles as well so it
is<00:02:49.959> only<00:02:50.079> excessive<00:02:50.920> visa<00:02:51.370> Condor<00:02:51.880> you<00:02:52.599> can

is only excessive visa Condor you can
just<00:02:52.930> scrape<00:02:53.139> it<00:02:53.380> off<00:03:00.840> then<00:03:01.840> you<00:03:01.870> can<00:03:01.989> just

down all the joints and across all the
joints<00:03:33.400> so<00:03:34.269> give<00:03:34.420> us<00:03:34.510> a<00:03:34.569> nice<00:03:34.750> finish

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.160 

so<00:03:58.650> by<00:03:58.830> doing<00:03:58.890> this<00:03:59.250> you<00:03:59.310> actually<00:04:00.170> ensure

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
so by doing this you actually ensure

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:02.540 
so by doing this you actually ensure
that<00:04:01.320> the<00:04:01.440> growls<00:04:01.650> pushed<00:04:01.980> in<00:04:02.130> between<00:04:02.430> the

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:02.550 
that the growls pushed in between the

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:04.640 
that the growls pushed in between the
towels<00:04:02.790> and<00:04:03.450> you<00:04:03.570> also<00:04:03.720> get<00:04:03.930> a<00:04:03.960> nice<00:04:04.140> finish<00:04:04.380> as

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
towels and you also get a nice finish as

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:11.120 
towels and you also get a nice finish as
well<00:04:09.110> and<00:04:10.110> then<00:04:10.230> one<00:04:10.350> of<00:04:10.440> the<00:04:10.500> lot<00:04:10.620> of<00:04:10.650> vertical

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.130 
well and then one of the lot of vertical

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:13.190 
well and then one of the lot of vertical
joints<00:04:11.490> I<00:04:11.670> then<00:04:12.120> do<00:04:12.240> all<00:04:12.390> the<00:04:12.540> horizontal

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 
joints I then do all the horizontal

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:35.780 
joints I then do all the horizontal
joints<00:04:33.560> now<00:04:34.560> as<00:04:34.680> I<00:04:34.710> go<00:04:34.980> along<00:04:35.070> I'm<00:04:35.370> just<00:04:35.490> wiping

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:35.790 
joints now as I go along I'm just wiping

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:38.060 
joints now as I go along I'm just wiping
any<00:04:35.940> excessive<00:04:36.480> Deezy<00:04:36.870> but<00:04:37.170> the<00:04:37.320> worktop<00:04:37.770> and

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:38.070

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.000 
I'm also just rubbing the sponge

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.490 
I'm also just rubbing the sponge
underneath<00:04:42.000> the<00:04:42.240> bottom<00:04:42.510> of<00:04:42.600> our<00:04:42.660> towels<00:04:42.960> just

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:43.500

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.870 
to clean out any girl that's got in
there<00:04:45.710> because<00:04:46.710> we<00:04:46.980> need<00:04:47.100> to<00:04:47.190> leave<00:04:47.340> a<00:04:47.370> nice

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:47.880 
there because we need to leave a nice

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.320 
there because we need to leave a nice
gap<00:04:48.120> in<00:04:48.270> their<00:04:48.420> facility<00:04:48.810> calling<00:04:49.230> afterwards

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:50.330 
gap in their facility calling afterwards

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.180 
gap in their facility calling afterwards
once<00:04:51.330> the<00:04:51.510> grafts<00:04:51.720> dried<00:04:52.110> and<00:04:52.530> it's<00:04:52.680> gone<00:04:52.860> tall

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:53.190 
once the grafts dried and it's gone tall

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:55.400 
once the grafts dried and it's gone tall
like<00:04:53.700> a<00:04:53.730> Z<00:04:54.000> and<00:04:54.420> then<00:04:54.570> start<00:04:54.840> to<00:04:54.960> remove<00:04:55.230> it

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:55.410 
like a Z and then start to remove it

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:57.700 
like a Z and then start to remove it
with<00:04:55.680> a<00:04:55.710> sponge

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:57.710 
with a sponge

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:00.140 
with a sponge
the<00:04:58.710> trick<00:04:58.920> here<00:04:58.950> we<00:04:59.220> sort<00:04:59.430> of<00:04:59.490> dump<00:04:59.700> sponge

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150 
the trick here we sort of dump sponge

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:01.610 
the trick here we sort of dump sponge
but<00:05:00.360> not<00:05:00.540> a<00:05:00.570> wet<00:05:00.780> sponge<00:05:01.020> you<00:05:01.230> don't<00:05:01.380> want<00:05:01.500> it

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:01.620 
but not a wet sponge you don't want it

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:05.300 
but not a wet sponge you don't want it
too<00:05:01.770> wet<00:05:01.800> so<00:05:03.500> what<00:05:04.500> you<00:05:04.590> can<00:05:04.710> do<00:05:04.800> that<00:05:04.950> is<00:05:05.100> just

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:05.310 
too wet so what you can do that is just

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:08.570 
too wet so what you can do that is just
clean<00:05:05.730> all<00:05:05.910> the<00:05:06.740> excessive<00:05:07.740> grout<00:05:07.980> from<00:05:08.460> the

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:08.580 
clean all the excessive grout from the

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:21.060 
clean all the excessive grout from the
surface<00:05:08.940> of<00:05:09.060> the<00:05:09.090> towels

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:21.070 

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:23.770 

and<00:05:22.070> then<00:05:22.160> when<00:05:22.460> the<00:05:22.550> sponge<00:05:22.790> is<00:05:22.940> dirty<00:05:23.480> like

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:23.780 
and then when the sponge is dirty like

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:24.940 
and then when the sponge is dirty like
that<00:05:23.810> you<00:05:24.080> can<00:05:24.230> just<00:05:24.350> go<00:05:24.440> and<00:05:24.530> give<00:05:24.650> it<00:05:24.740> a<00:05:24.800> rinse

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:24.950 
that you can just go and give it a rinse

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:25.480 
that you can just go and give it a rinse
out

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:25.490 
out

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:27.940 
out
so<00:05:26.450> once<00:05:26.750> you've<00:05:26.870> rinsed<00:05:27.020> it<00:05:27.230> out<00:05:27.320> again<00:05:27.740> make

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:27.950 
so once you've rinsed it out again make

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:29.950 
so once you've rinsed it out again make
sure<00:05:27.980> it's<00:05:28.130> damp<00:05:28.490> and<00:05:28.610> not<00:05:28.790> wet<00:05:29.000> you<00:05:29.720> can<00:05:29.840> then

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:29.960 
sure it's damp and not wet you can then

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:39.460 
sure it's damp and not wet you can then
continue<00:05:30.140> cleaning<00:05:37.870> the<00:05:38.870> kitchen<00:05:39.050> is<00:05:39.350> now
