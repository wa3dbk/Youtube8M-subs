 Thank you again today 

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:17.710
 Where there is no doubt that the sound of battle will be added and sewed 

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:20.100
 From this point on, I would say that it would be good if you had this kind of other person's information information, and you would get asthma. 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:20.100
 I'd Chau 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:28.689
 I thought I was thinking that I could not increase the number I painted 

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:33.640
 I think that using will decrease as well and become better 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:34.390
 Absolutely that's required But look open when were enemies out also Ne Toga now on extra stage 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:40.400
 I think 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:45.890
 Well, I think if there is something new to add new items, but first of all everyone is Dawn 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:46.430
 Thankfully do you think and Tarasuge become what what new items everyone's think 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:52.520
 Is it 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:54.200
 Please let me know in the comments , so I thought a little more about the order of the other's attack 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:58.000
 Swap the 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:01:04.089
 Open waiting Once I thought I Do not handy'm pretty Is the child 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:05.780
 I wonder if one day and suck to do this concentrated'm the very first to mean that Ms. their own Is the character 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:08.869
 A school that can be understood 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:12.500
 I want three bodies together 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:16.369
 To eat or party seriously I want to be there somehow 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:21.530
 For example , 34 in the attribute from the ground attribute 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:25.220
 For example, Nun-Maya on the theme of Aichi- san attribute to set up a party 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.800
 Every time Chau Shiawasen I chance not Chau the beginning was to me the most 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.760
 Like that 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:35.820
 It is an attribute with the Lion opponent Kordo 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:39.660
 This something for when Tteyuu Let's what I'm trying to do press the cream together 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:44.160
 You say that one cold Mr. is put in the first hole 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:47.370
 It's very convenient if there is a partner who says to use it and move it. 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:49.780
 That Japanese attack is getting stuck 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:54.250
 In Well Well this chat why school 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:57.820
 I thought it would be good but I am now telling the question I thought 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:02:03.220
 I also a painful attack, which came after Yes next turn 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:03.909
 Mad I mean it there for now I'm there two in me that there leisure rush 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:08.770

 Masu you I I mean dungeon first with the story of that masu 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:13.270
 It's not so good 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:16.240
 There are some 113 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:21.190
 Selling I have used's by mistake 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:25.360
 Pattern I mean Tsu would come 1 your mind Soshitara Mr. disappear around the city of two 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:32.110
 Nde I'd end cladding one squares the damage of the previous 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:33.160
 This is the first one I have, but the second and third one is the feeling I said now that high school scissors 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:36.260
 It has been transferred 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:39.950
 2 turns eyebrows and enemies 4 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:44.750
 I want to see After the addition Koch Koch Koch had 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:46.220
 Softening Once you move intends'm So Well cats it's felt to say really, please pardon 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:50.180

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:54.560
 It all means be cut'm moving Tteyuu I'm good if waiting for such partner 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:55.940
 By all means variety in those who have seen do you think everyone thought Well wonder if should say this is good 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.250
 I did my best with my voice 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:02.070
 tube 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:03.570
 As we think whether it was possible to talk that there was not , cancer stems are recruited by people of comment by all means 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:09.150
 It doesn't matter otherwise 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:14.130
 Anything other than battle can be anything and anything ok Comments are free 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:16.240
 Put out this kind of video in Dokkan battle in the future it a kind of feeling in the Well feeling when you fill out 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:23.290
 Go Once Do you think these easy Nane 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:26.490
 To the character rankings that the viewer chooses again next time 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:30.660
 I would like to do there guess the first time was 5 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:37.380
 The number of subscribers is probably only 200 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:42.300
 Certainly commentary I first'm was it started in this channel opened in about not after one month 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:46.480
 You because I think that a little Do not or whether trying to do without doing to do it and I thought Nde elements trying to do 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:49.940
 Also please wait for the video of the other's Runkey this time 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:55.400
 There were quite a few more characters at the time of making 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:04:02.840
 It is thought that ranking is only in the attribute by ssr binding 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:09.260
 For example, ranking of skill attribute of normal character, ranking of child attribute of r, etc. 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:09.930
 Everyone's still vote a little classification often divided finally this win up were guys with the feeling say 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:15.280
 Even if 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:18.370
 It is different from what I'm saying now that the position is determined by the strong one 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:21.700
 All the normal maces that I have won 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:24.450
 Getz, who is absolutely excluded, will enter the final interview 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:31.170
 Group interview normal r 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:33.510
 r sr ssr ssr ssr If it is not complete, but the final interview 

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:38.040
 I do not know I Ademo in stage 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:42.990
 That sort of do not may be whether there is also a vote to say just because the picture of the character is cool 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:44.470
 But I think that I want something decided in the whole overall ranking 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:47.920
 See you again 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:51.730
 There are many different ways open, so I want to do something more widely from now on 

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:55.750
 Dot or battle Ikunda I doing somewhere also in I've done of course in addition to it 

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:59.080
 For example, it is about Dragon Ball or other Dragon Ball games. 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:04.460
 Please tell me what or funny Do Toka old Dragon Ball game 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:09.979
 This game is funny, for example everyone is funny 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:14.889
 Toka even if any all means more than I need your help because we are all reward in the way of comment of Tteyuu 

00:05:09.979 --> 00:05:14.889
