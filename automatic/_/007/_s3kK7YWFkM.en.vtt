days<00:02:03.869> it<00:02:04.439> wasn't<00:02:04.799> I<00:02:05.070> mean<00:02:05.250> I'm<00:02:05.369> happy<00:02:05.610> with

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
days it wasn't I mean I'm happy with

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.969 
days it wasn't I mean I'm happy with
that<00:02:06.000> but<00:02:06.180> it<00:02:06.270> wasn't<00:02:06.420> exactly<00:02:06.600> what<00:02:06.990> I<00:02:07.200> I

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
that but it wasn't exactly what I I

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.100 
that but it wasn't exactly what I I
thought<00:02:08.700> it<00:02:08.849> may<00:02:08.970> have<00:02:09.060> been<00:02:09.179> 60<00:02:09.660> or<00:02:09.750> more<00:02:09.780> but

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
thought it may have been 60 or more but

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.760 
thought it may have been 60 or more but
I<00:02:10.140> would<00:02:10.709> say<00:02:10.890> that<00:02:11.129> maybe<00:02:11.720> had<00:02:12.720> I<00:02:12.750> exercised

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
I would say that maybe had I exercised

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.090 
I would say that maybe had I exercised
is<00:02:13.890> more<00:02:14.220> I<00:02:14.580> would<00:02:15.420> have<00:02:15.450> lost<00:02:16.050> more<00:02:16.440> weight<00:02:16.500> so

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
is more I would have lost more weight so

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.700 
is more I would have lost more weight so
the<00:02:17.730> next<00:02:17.970> go-around<00:02:18.210> I'll<00:02:18.900> implement<00:02:19.290> more

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710 
the next go-around I'll implement more

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:22.010 
the next go-around I'll implement more
exercise<00:02:20.280> because<00:02:20.700> that<00:02:20.910> was<00:02:21.060> fifty<00:02:21.420> pounds

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020

with<00:02:22.590> minimal<00:02:23.130> exercise<00:02:23.310> I<00:02:23.850> did<00:02:23.910> a<00:02:24.030> little

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
with minimal exercise I did a little

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:25.880

exercise<00:02:24.510> in<00:02:24.840> here<00:02:24.990> I<00:02:25.050> hit<00:02:25.170> the<00:02:25.290> gym<00:02:25.470> a<00:02:25.530> couple

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
exercise in here I hit the gym a couple

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.700 
exercise in here I hit the gym a couple
times<00:02:26.100> but<00:02:26.520> that<00:02:26.820> was<00:02:27.510> just<00:02:27.720> all<00:02:28.200> that<00:02:28.500> weight

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
times but that was just all that weight

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:30.650 
times but that was just all that weight
that<00:02:28.920> was<00:02:29.040> lost<00:02:29.280> majority<00:02:29.670> of<00:02:30.240> it<00:02:30.390> I<00:02:30.480> would<00:02:30.630> say

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
that was lost majority of it I would say

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.910 
that was lost majority of it I would say
about<00:02:30.930> 90<00:02:31.590> percent<00:02:32.160> 90<00:02:32.640> percent<00:02:32.670> of<00:02:33.120> it<00:02:33.300> was

just me pushing away from the table so
the<00:02:36.660> next<00:02:37.410> go-around<00:02:37.590> like<00:02:38.040> I<00:02:38.100> said<00:02:38.220> I'm<00:02:38.280> not

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
the next go-around like I said I'm not

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.130 
the next go-around like I said I'm not
at<00:02:38.550> my<00:02:38.610> desire<00:02:39.000> weight<00:02:39.240> yet<00:02:39.660> I<00:02:39.810> still<00:02:39.990> have
