so now that we have that much blended up

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.020 
so now that we have that much blended up
we're<00:01:31.290> gonna<00:01:31.380> add<00:01:31.650> in<00:01:31.920> a<00:01:32.189> little<00:01:32.430> bit<00:01:32.610> of

we're gonna add in a little bit of

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.719

stevia or Truvia whatever you prefer and

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.370 
stevia or Truvia whatever you prefer and
that's<00:01:36.180> going<00:01:36.360> to<00:01:36.420> give<00:01:36.540> it<00:01:36.570> that<00:01:36.689> nice<00:01:37.020> sweet

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
that's going to give it that nice sweet

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.039 
that's going to give it that nice sweet
flavor<00:01:37.409> and<00:01:38.100> probably<00:01:38.700> around<00:01:38.939> a<00:01:39.119> tablespoon

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
flavor and probably around a tablespoon

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.319 
flavor and probably around a tablespoon
and<00:01:40.650> then<00:01:41.490> you're<00:01:41.610> probably<00:01:41.729> going<00:01:41.939> to<00:01:42.090> add<00:01:42.180> it

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329

pan<00:02:02.220> heating<00:02:02.610> on<00:02:02.790> medium<00:02:03.300> heat<00:02:03.450> and<00:02:03.720> you're

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
pan heating on medium heat and you're

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:04.910 
pan heating on medium heat and you're
gonna<00:02:04.080> take<00:02:04.260> a<00:02:04.320> little<00:02:04.470> bit<00:02:04.650> of<00:02:04.770> nonstick

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
gonna take a little bit of nonstick

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.780 
gonna take a little bit of nonstick
cooking<00:02:05.610> spray<00:02:05.670> and<00:02:06.150> spray<00:02:06.660> that<00:02:06.690> on<00:02:06.990> there

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:07.790 
cooking spray and spray that on there

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:10.150 
cooking spray and spray that on there
and<00:02:08.790> then<00:02:09.060> it's<00:02:09.390> pretty<00:02:09.540> self-explanatory

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
and then it's pretty self-explanatory

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.010 
and then it's pretty self-explanatory
just<00:02:11.160> take<00:02:11.730> the<00:02:11.880> amount<00:02:12.150> that<00:02:12.240> you<00:02:12.480> want<00:02:12.630> and

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
just take the amount that you want and

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.180 
just take the amount that you want and
pour<00:02:13.350> that<00:02:13.500> out<00:02:15.680> and<00:02:16.680> now<00:02:16.830> you're<00:02:16.980> just<00:02:17.040> gonna

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
pour that out and now you're just gonna

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:18.560 
pour that out and now you're just gonna
put<00:02:17.430> a<00:02:17.460> lid<00:02:17.670> on<00:02:17.700> it<00:02:17.910> and<00:02:17.940> let<00:02:18.060> it<00:02:18.150> cook<00:02:18.360> on<00:02:18.540> one

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
put a lid on it and let it cook on one

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.390 
put a lid on it and let it cook on one
side<00:02:18.990> and<00:02:19.260> then<00:02:19.350> we'll<00:02:19.590> get<00:02:19.740> ready<00:02:19.890> to<00:02:19.980> flip<00:02:20.220> it

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
side and then we'll get ready to flip it

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.250 
side and then we'll get ready to flip it
on<00:02:20.490> the<00:02:20.670> other<00:02:20.790> side<00:02:20.910> and<00:02:21.480> basically<00:02:22.080> from

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
on the other side and basically from

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.420 
on the other side and basically from
here<00:02:22.320> on<00:02:22.560> out<00:02:22.680> you're<00:02:22.890> just<00:02:22.920> going<00:02:23.190> to<00:02:23.250> treat

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.850 
here on out you're just going to treat
it<00:02:23.550> like<00:02:23.730> a<00:02:23.760> normal<00:02:23.910> pancake<00:02:24.660> so<00:02:25.380> I'll<00:02:25.590> see<00:02:25.830> you

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
one is ready to flip and it smells

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.310 
one is ready to flip and it smells
really<00:02:32.790> good<00:02:33.120> it<00:02:33.270> smells<00:02:33.540> like<00:02:33.720> cinnamon

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
really good it smells like cinnamon

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.500 
really good it smells like cinnamon
sugar<00:02:34.770> flavor<00:02:35.190> but<00:02:35.970> we<00:02:36.060> didn't<00:02:36.240> add<00:02:36.330> any<00:02:36.480> sugar

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
sugar flavor but we didn't add any sugar

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.930 
sugar flavor but we didn't add any sugar
remember<00:02:37.170> we<00:02:37.290> added<00:02:37.620> stevia<00:02:38.459> or<00:02:38.490> Truvia

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
remember we added stevia or Truvia

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.520 
remember we added stevia or Truvia
whatever<00:02:39.300> one<00:02:39.480> and<00:02:39.930> you're<00:02:40.020> just<00:02:40.110> gonna<00:02:40.260> flip

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
whatever one and you're just gonna flip

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.470 
whatever one and you're just gonna flip
this<00:02:40.740> like<00:02:40.980> a<00:02:41.010> normal<00:02:41.100> pancake<00:02:41.820> and<00:02:42.180> it<00:02:42.330> might

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
this like a normal pancake and it might

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.730 
this like a normal pancake and it might
take<00:02:42.660> a<00:02:42.720> couple<00:02:42.840> tries<00:02:43.320> to<00:02:43.620> get<00:02:43.740> this<00:02:43.890> right

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:45.740 
take a couple tries to get this right

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:48.680 
take a couple tries to get this right
but<00:02:46.740> I<00:02:46.980> did<00:02:47.220> a<00:02:47.250> pretty<00:02:47.490> good<00:02:47.670> job<00:02:47.850> there<00:02:47.910> I've

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
but I did a pretty good job there I've

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.510 
but I did a pretty good job there I've
had<00:02:48.810> a<00:02:48.840> lot<00:02:49.020> of<00:02:49.050> practice<00:02:49.500> with<00:02:49.530> these<00:02:49.860> so

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
had a lot of practice with these so

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.100 
had a lot of practice with these so
we're<00:02:50.940> probably<00:02:51.090> gonna<00:02:51.270> let<00:02:51.480> this<00:02:51.630> side<00:02:51.870> cook

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
we're probably gonna let this side cook

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.470 
we're probably gonna let this side cook
for<00:02:52.290> a<00:02:52.320> little<00:02:52.560> bit<00:02:52.650> less<00:02:53.120> just<00:02:54.120> keep<00:02:54.270> an<00:02:54.390> eye

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
for a little bit less just keep an eye

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.030 
for a little bit less just keep an eye
on<00:02:54.510> it<00:02:54.720> like<00:02:54.870> I<00:02:54.989> said<00:02:55.050> and<00:02:55.500> if<00:02:55.560> you<00:02:55.680> want<00:02:55.860> it<00:02:55.920> to

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
on it like I said and if you want it to

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.130 
on it like I said and if you want it to
be<00:02:56.190> a<00:02:56.220> little<00:02:56.550> bit<00:02:56.730> more<00:02:57.000> moist<00:02:57.360> in<00:02:57.750> the<00:02:57.840> center

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
be a little bit more moist in the center

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.290 
be a little bit more moist in the center
obviously<00:02:58.830> taking<00:02:59.459> off<00:02:59.550> a<00:02:59.580> little<00:02:59.850> bit<00:02:59.940> early

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
obviously taking off a little bit early

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.540 
obviously taking off a little bit early
but<00:03:00.900> this<00:03:01.080> should<00:03:01.290> probably<00:03:01.500> be<00:03:02.160> done<00:03:02.340> in

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
but this should probably be done in

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:05.960 
but this should probably be done in
about<00:03:02.670> a<00:03:02.820> minute<00:03:04.160> all<00:03:05.160> right<00:03:05.220> so<00:03:05.519> here's<00:03:05.850> what

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
about a minute all right so here's what

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.449 
about a minute all right so here's what
the<00:03:06.450> final<00:03:06.959> version<00:03:07.350> of<00:03:07.470> the<00:03:07.530> pancake<00:03:08.040> looks

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
the final version of the pancake looks

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:10.430 
the final version of the pancake looks
like<00:03:08.700> and<00:03:09.180> as<00:03:09.300> you<00:03:09.420> guys<00:03:09.600> can<00:03:09.840> see<00:03:10.140> here

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
like and as you guys can see here

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.350 
like and as you guys can see here
there's<00:03:11.160> a<00:03:11.220> lot<00:03:11.400> of<00:03:11.519> batter<00:03:11.700> left<00:03:12.060> and<00:03:12.269> we're

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
there's a lot of batter left and we're

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.120 
there's a lot of batter left and we're
probably<00:03:12.510> gonna<00:03:12.750> be<00:03:12.870> able<00:03:12.930> to<00:03:13.050> make<00:03:13.260> 5<00:03:13.739> or<00:03:13.920> 6

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
probably gonna be able to make 5 or 6

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.880 
probably gonna be able to make 5 or 6
more<00:03:14.480> pancakes<00:03:15.480> with<00:03:15.690> this<00:03:15.870> size<00:03:16.110> so<00:03:16.650> if<00:03:16.769> you

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330 
don't eat it all you could just put it

reason I'm showing you guys how to make

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.670 
reason I'm showing you guys how to make
this<00:03:23.250> is<00:03:23.580> I<00:03:23.640> know<00:03:23.940> some<00:03:24.300> people<00:03:24.450> use<00:03:25.440> this

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
this is I know some people use this

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.729 
this is I know some people use this
stuff<00:03:26.040> called<00:03:26.280> Bisquick<00:03:26.790> it's<00:03:27.450> easy<00:03:27.780> you<00:03:28.530> just

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
stuff called Bisquick it's easy you just

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:30.229 
stuff called Bisquick it's easy you just
put<00:03:28.890> a<00:03:28.920> little<00:03:29.100> water<00:03:29.250> in<00:03:29.550> it<00:03:29.700> and<00:03:29.850> you<00:03:29.970> shake

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
put a little water in it and you shake

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:31.790 
put a little water in it and you shake
it<00:03:30.269> up<00:03:30.480> and<00:03:30.630> then<00:03:30.750> you<00:03:30.840> just<00:03:31.019> pour<00:03:31.590> it<00:03:31.739> out

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:31.800 
it up and then you just pour it out

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.430 
it up and then you just pour it out
there<00:03:32.040> and<00:03:32.130> make<00:03:32.280> a<00:03:32.310> pancake<00:03:32.610> but<00:03:33.480> obviously

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
there and make a pancake but obviously

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.590 
there and make a pancake but obviously
this<00:03:34.769> is<00:03:34.950> not<00:03:35.130> very<00:03:35.370> healthy<00:03:35.700> for<00:03:36.030> you<00:03:36.150> it's

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
this is not very healthy for you it's

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.680 
this is not very healthy for you it's
got<00:03:36.750> 3<00:03:37.019> grams<00:03:37.290> of<00:03:37.560> total<00:03:37.800> fat

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690 
got 3 grams of total fat

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:40.840 
got 3 grams of total fat
one<00:03:38.780> gram<00:03:38.990> of<00:03:39.110> saturated<00:03:39.350> fat<00:03:39.890> and<00:03:40.250> it<00:03:40.550> even

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:40.850 
one gram of saturated fat and it even

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:43.330 
one gram of saturated fat and it even
has<00:03:41.060> a<00:03:41.390> gram<00:03:41.810> of<00:03:42.140> trans<00:03:42.500> fat

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
has a gram of trans fat

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:45.820 
has a gram of trans fat
so<00:03:43.520> trans<00:03:44.480> fat<00:03:44.690> is<00:03:44.900> the<00:03:45.080> worst<00:03:45.260> kind<00:03:45.470> for<00:03:45.770> you

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:45.830 
so trans fat is the worst kind for you

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:48.130 
so trans fat is the worst kind for you
