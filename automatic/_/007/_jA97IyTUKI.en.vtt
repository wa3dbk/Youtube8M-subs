00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:12.389
 It remains unchanged favorite lacquers from 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.889

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.650
 over a very very long time 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.539
 a little and probably not all spring and that's how 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.010
 it began years this is such a beige 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.830
 shade many girls too me 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.680
 asked what kind of lag so here it is 0 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.560
 5 shade from the golden series why it was 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:34.079
 given the old man you are with such a big 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.579
 brush is also not very much I can 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.079
 say that he is probably the only varnish 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.170
 from the mass market which rests on 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.090
 nails to nails more than one day where 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.250
 then three to four days if I'm on top 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.610
 do more sparkles here for example here on 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.200
 this finger I make sparkles from marques 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.570

 yellowish is also very beautiful so 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.270

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.159

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.940

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.820
 enjoy it and the following 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.470
 there ' this is also my constant favorite 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.970
 It is written that to get and the new series tenax 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.400

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:45.519
 left going too go on and 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:47.320
 weeks coal to buy such 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:49.299
 pagoda to tell so maybe 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:51.850
 all stores where Maktab is sold 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:54.459
 bring 6 empty tubes give out one 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:56.140
 new lipstick but i only have 1 empty 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:59.500
 But from a tube of lipstick 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:02.770
 with the name hill in general is very very their 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:04.930
 love and as for my highlighter 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:08.319
 pet for everyday use 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.310
 there was such a chill 3 ordering from 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:12.100
 polish site 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:15.130
 this metaphor series i think is all of you 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.780
 know it says it's powder but i 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.670
 do not use on the whole face only on those 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:21.100
 areas that I wanted to highlight 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.989
 because my skin is problematic and 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:25.450
 exacerbate it with some kind of glow 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:28.180
 places that don't need to show i don't 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:30.640
 I want in contrast to those who 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.459
 I have for example from add resume 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:35.940
 nazir also from 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:38.680
 if I'm not mistaken is called when like 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:40.989
 it fits every day because 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:43.150
 its almost invisible but it is clear that 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:45.340
 you have good skin face for healthy 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.320
 so I think that yes light time 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.060
 days it fits best if 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:51.180
 you enjoyed something 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.890
 tell me about your impressions and 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:56.830
 as for the bronzer, this is here my 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:58.690
 became such a favorite here buna for it 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:00.040
 I have already issued a magnet for a palette 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:02.200
 transfer from catrice 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.880
 and actually made some bad with 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:07.180
 I watched the video Natalia 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:09.730
 volchkova and she shows a different shade 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.980
 helped to be honest I do not remember 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:14.470
 deceased i will definitely indicate which this 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.640
 shade and it turned out to be a little chew 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:21.340
 something that showed it 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:24.880
 he was exactly taupe and was 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:27.340
 very similar to the shade of my palette 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:30.130
 the computer they were not looking for there team kid here 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:32.530
 this shade which does not give vrazhin and 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:35.290
 she showed something similar but i'm a little 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:37.210
 wrong with the swelling took here such why 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:38.710
 you do not listen to it thought that my 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:39.700
 photos seemed to be more 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:40.860
 some gray 

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:42.810
 but the topic 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:45.090
 I calmly use it now 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:47.939
 neck area let me here 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:48.509
 tanned there is a big difference and I 

00:04:47.939 --> 00:04:51.270
 a little bit 

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:53.610
 on our neck so she for example on 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:57.110
 caught up with my face very much to me 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:59.699
 I also like such a good amount 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:04.770
 queue this here as we will here 

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:06.330
 apparently a bit lies but not in quality 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:10.379
 enjoy with pleasure 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:12.270
 I use and as for brushes my 

00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:13.159
 the absolute favorite are their brushes for 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:15.750
 him 

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:17.729
 which replaced almost everyone and 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:19.770
 brushes and what I have is just 

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:23.639

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:25.529
 video they came here they came here 

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:27.719

00:05:27.719 --> 00:05:31.490

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:33.810

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:35.639

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:37.590
 favorites if something is not shown 

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:40.110
