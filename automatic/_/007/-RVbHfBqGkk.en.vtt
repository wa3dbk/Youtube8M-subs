basketball<00:02:33.040> I<00:02:33.130> think<00:02:33.370> our<00:02:33.490> defense<00:02:33.640> and<00:02:33.970> our

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
basketball I think our defense and our

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.200 
basketball I think our defense and our
activity<00:02:34.540> was<00:02:34.690> good<00:02:35.400> offensively<00:02:36.400> that<00:02:36.790> we

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.210 
activity was good offensively that we

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:39.420 
activity was good offensively that we
were<00:02:37.300> in<00:02:37.450> a<00:02:37.570> tack<00:02:37.900> mode<00:02:38.170> and<00:02:38.500> aggressive<00:02:38.950> and<00:02:39.250> I

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
were in a tack mode and aggressive and I

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.760 
were in a tack mode and aggressive and I
got<00:02:39.760> a<00:02:39.790> lot<00:02:39.880> of<00:02:40.030> good<00:02:40.120> things<00:02:40.420> I<00:02:40.750> mean<00:02:41.650> you<00:02:41.710> know

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.770 
got a lot of good things I mean you know

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:43.080 
got a lot of good things I mean you know
we'll<00:02:41.920> learn<00:02:42.040> from<00:02:42.250> the<00:02:42.400> end<00:02:42.490> of<00:02:42.520> the<00:02:42.610> game<00:02:42.640> um
