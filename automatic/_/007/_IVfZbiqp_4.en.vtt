like red velvet cupcake mix but mine

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.620 
like red velvet cupcake mix but mine

came with only one cookie mix and so

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.810 
came with only one cookie mix and so
that's<00:01:16.229> a<00:01:16.320> little<00:01:16.439> bit<00:01:16.650> set<00:01:16.950> but<00:01:17.280> that's<00:01:17.490> okay

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
that's a little bit set but that's okay

and it's actually really heavy I don't

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.510 
and it's actually really heavy I don't
know<00:01:20.310> if<00:01:20.610> it's<00:01:20.790> because<00:01:21.740> the<00:01:22.740> oven<00:01:23.100> is<00:01:23.340> not

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
know if it's because the oven is not

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.289 
know if it's because the oven is not
within<00:01:23.850> light<00:01:24.360> bulb<00:01:24.659> anymore<00:01:25.170> and<00:01:25.500> it's<00:01:25.710> I'm

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
cute I actually like it a lot better

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:43.280 
cute I actually like it a lot better
than<00:02:39.350> the<00:02:41.000> easy-bake<00:02:42.000> of<00:02:42.330> an<00:02:42.480> Instax<00:02:42.900> Center

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
than the easy-bake of an Instax Center

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.229 
than the easy-bake of an Instax Center
one<00:02:43.530> because<00:02:44.040> I<00:02:44.340> don't<00:02:44.519> know<00:02:44.640> it's<00:02:44.880> just<00:02:44.940> very

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
one because I don't know it's just very

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:48.500 
one because I don't know it's just very
cute<00:02:45.630> and<00:02:45.690> looks<00:02:45.900> like<00:02:45.989> a<00:02:46.110> spatula<00:02:47.060> so<00:02:48.060> the

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
cute and looks like a spatula so the

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.050 
cute and looks like a spatula so the
material<00:02:48.989> is<00:02:49.019> a<00:02:49.110> little<00:02:49.350> bit<00:02:49.880> different<00:02:50.880> -

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
material is a little bit different -

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.509 
material is a little bit different -
it's<00:02:51.269> not<00:02:51.450> actually<00:02:51.600> bendable<00:02:52.410> it's<00:02:52.620> a<00:02:52.980> lot

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
it's not actually bendable it's a lot

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:56.390 
it's not actually bendable it's a lot
heavier<00:02:53.819> than<00:02:54.299> the<00:02:54.420> other<00:02:54.569> oven<00:02:55.130> because<00:02:56.130> this

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
heavier than the other oven because this

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.330 
heavier than the other oven because this
one<00:02:56.610> doesn't<00:02:56.819> require<00:02:57.420> a<00:02:57.750> light<00:02:57.959> bows<00:02:58.200> so<00:02:58.590> the

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
one doesn't require a light bows so the

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:04.250 
one doesn't require a light bows so the
front<00:02:59.610> of<00:02:59.760> it<00:02:59.910> is<00:03:00.030> very<00:03:00.299> very<00:03:03.019> this<00:03:04.019> is<00:03:04.230> a

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
front of it is very very this is a

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.370 
front of it is very very this is a
switch<00:03:04.650> which<00:03:04.950> turns<00:03:04.980> the<00:03:05.580> oven<00:03:05.849> on<00:03:06.810> and<00:03:07.170> off

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
switch which turns the oven on and off

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.699 
switch which turns the oven on and off
and<00:03:07.890> I<00:03:08.819> really<00:03:09.540> like<00:03:09.720> that<00:03:09.840> this<00:03:10.019> button<00:03:10.319> is

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
and I really like that this button is

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:14.060 
and I really like that this button is
actually<00:03:10.980> real<00:03:11.730> this<00:03:12.030> time<00:03:12.269> so<00:03:12.920> it's<00:03:13.920> your

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
actually real this time so it's your

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:16.970 
actually real this time so it's your
density<00:03:14.370> of<00:03:14.459> an<00:03:14.579> often<00:03:14.940> and<00:03:15.660> so<00:03:15.930> it's<00:03:16.709> kind<00:03:16.950> of

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
density of an often and so it's kind of

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.400 
density of an often and so it's kind of
like<00:03:17.160> a<00:03:17.430> toaster<00:03:18.269> oven<00:03:18.329> in<00:03:18.630> my<00:03:18.750> opinion<00:03:19.200> a

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
like a toaster oven in my opinion a

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.860 
like a toaster oven in my opinion a
really<00:03:19.950> cool<00:03:20.489> feature<00:03:20.820> that<00:03:21.000> the<00:03:21.269> oven<00:03:21.450> has

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
really cool feature that the oven has

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.240 
really cool feature that the oven has
and<00:03:22.440> the<00:03:23.100> Hat<00:03:24.049> it<00:03:25.049> has

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
and the Hat it has

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:31.440 
and the Hat it has
storage<00:03:28.800> compartment<00:03:29.800> and<00:03:30.070> it's<00:03:30.460> very<00:03:31.030> very

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450
