engines<00:00:54.270> you<00:00:54.449> know<00:00:54.539> those<00:00:54.719> things<00:00:54.899> rarely

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
engines you know those things rarely

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.049 
engines you know those things rarely
ever<00:00:56.280> fail<00:00:56.640> so<00:00:57.120> you<00:00:57.629> know<00:00:57.750> we<00:00:58.260> should<00:00:58.469> be<00:00:58.590> okay

00:00:59.049 --> 00:00:59.059 
ever fail so you know we should be okay

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:01.490 
ever fail so you know we should be okay
well<00:01:00.059> obviously<00:01:00.270> plane<00:01:00.660> Newcastle<00:01:01.199> United

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
well obviously plane Newcastle United

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.590 
well obviously plane Newcastle United
away<00:01:01.710> it's<00:01:01.920> an<00:01:01.980> important<00:01:02.460> game<00:01:02.699> so<00:01:03.510> we

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
away it's an important game so we

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.649 
away it's an important game so we
decided<00:01:03.930> that<00:01:04.080> we<00:01:04.320> take<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.890> plane<00:01:05.210> but<00:01:06.210> as<00:01:06.390> I

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
decided that we take the plane but as I

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.840 
decided that we take the plane but as I
think<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.290> press<00:01:07.650> have<00:01:07.860> announced<00:01:08.460> recently

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
think the press have announced recently

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.910 
think the press have announced recently
that<00:01:09.299> Marcus<00:01:09.659> has<00:01:09.810> got<00:01:09.990> his<00:01:10.110> pilot's<00:01:10.500> license

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
that Marcus has got his pilot's license

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.410 
that Marcus has got his pilot's license
so<00:01:11.580> we<00:01:11.610> thought<00:01:11.760> was<00:01:11.909> an<00:01:11.970> ideal<00:01:12.240> opportunity

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
so we thought was an ideal opportunity

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.480 
so we thought was an ideal opportunity
to<00:01:12.810> you<00:01:13.470> know<00:01:13.530> get<00:01:13.770> them<00:01:13.890> to<00:01:14.040> do<00:01:14.159> something

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
to you know get them to do something

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.190 
to you know get them to do something
additional<00:01:14.880> than<00:01:15.570> just<00:01:15.780> playing<00:01:15.990> and

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
additional than just playing and

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.899 
additional than just playing and
actually<00:01:16.470> as<00:01:17.009> he's<00:01:17.189> not<00:01:17.369> actually<00:01:17.610> been

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
actually as he's not actually been

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.060 
actually as he's not actually been
starting<00:01:18.450> you<00:01:18.810> know<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:19.290> idea<00:01:19.619> of<00:01:19.680> him<00:01:19.860> doing

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
starting you know the idea of him doing

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.100 
starting you know the idea of him doing
something<00:01:20.369> extra<00:01:20.820> for<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.030> team<00:01:21.240> like<00:01:21.810> flying

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
something extra for the team like flying

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.020 
something extra for the team like flying
the<00:01:22.259> plane<00:01:22.470> up<00:01:22.680> to<00:01:22.799> Newcastle<00:01:23.369> is<00:01:23.520> just<00:01:23.820> you

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
the plane up to Newcastle is just you

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.910 
the plane up to Newcastle is just you
know<00:01:24.150> it's<00:01:24.270> perfect<00:01:24.720> and<00:01:24.869> I<00:01:25.020> think<00:01:25.409> he's<00:01:25.710> got

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
know it's perfect and I think he's got

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.249 
know it's perfect and I think he's got
his<00:01:26.040> eye<00:01:26.220> on<00:01:26.250> you<00:01:26.700> know<00:01:27.180> being<00:01:27.689> a<00:01:27.810> commercial

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
his eye on you know being a commercial

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.890 
his eye on you know being a commercial
pilot<00:01:28.909> once<00:01:29.909> he<00:01:30.030> once<00:01:30.360> he<00:01:30.450> retires<00:01:30.810> from

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
pilot once he once he retires from

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.840 
pilot once he once he retires from
football<00:01:31.409> so<00:01:31.619> this<00:01:31.920> is<00:01:32.040> good<00:01:32.280> practice<00:01:32.310> for

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
football so this is good practice for

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.730 
football so this is good practice for
him<00:01:32.939> I<00:01:33.150> wasn't<00:01:33.930> gonna<00:01:34.079> go<00:01:34.200> on<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.380> plane<00:01:34.560> at

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
him I wasn't gonna go on the plane at

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.530 
him I wasn't gonna go on the plane at
all<00:01:34.890> wouldn't<00:01:35.579> a<00:01:35.759> done<00:01:35.790> it<00:01:36.060> until<00:01:36.329> I<00:01:36.360> heard

the<00:01:39.479> qualified<00:01:39.840> co-pilot<00:01:40.470> so

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:35.850 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:39.510 

but<00:04:36.850> clip<00:04:37.240> that<00:04:37.419> tree<00:04:37.630> yeah<00:04:37.810> I<00:04:38.370> couldn't<00:04:39.370> tell

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 
but clip that tree yeah I couldn't tell

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.460 
but clip that tree yeah I couldn't tell
where<00:04:39.820> it<00:04:39.910> was<00:04:40.030> cuz<00:04:40.210> we<00:04:40.300> I've<00:04:41.020> got<00:04:41.200> a<00:04:41.230> loop

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 
where it was cuz we I've got a loop

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:44.070 
where it was cuz we I've got a loop
around<00:04:41.620> that<00:04:41.800> big<00:04:42.040> tree<00:04:42.250> and<00:04:42.720> I<00:04:43.720> clipped<00:04:44.020> that

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.080 
around that big tree and I clipped that

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.350 
around that big tree and I clipped that
branch<00:04:44.410> over<00:04:44.680> there<00:04:44.830> a<00:04:45.070> little<00:04:46.030> bit<00:04:46.210> lower

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 
branch over there a little bit lower

00:04:46.360 --> 00:05:00.000 
branch over there a little bit lower
than<00:04:46.510> I<00:04:46.600> thought<00:04:57.600> yeah<00:04:58.600> that's<00:04:58.780> amazing<00:04:59.080> you
