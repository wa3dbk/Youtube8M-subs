the golems and pekka's lately I've been
up<00:00:15.450> to<00:00:16.100> saving<00:00:17.100> my<00:00:17.250> elixir<00:00:17.670> to<00:00:18.060> try<00:00:18.300> to<00:00:18.359> get<00:00:18.779> an

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
up to saving my elixir to try to get an

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.679 
up to saving my elixir to try to get an
upgrade<00:00:18.990> for<00:00:19.529> pekka's<00:00:20.400> which<00:00:20.789> is<00:00:21.000> pretty

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
upgrade for pekka's which is pretty

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.359 
upgrade for pekka's which is pretty
expensive<00:00:22.050> actually<00:00:22.650> let's<00:00:22.859> check<00:00:23.070> how<00:00:23.220> much

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
expensive actually let's check how much

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.210 
expensive actually let's check how much
it<00:00:23.550> is<00:00:23.640> I<00:00:23.850> haven't<00:00:24.000> checked<00:00:24.269> in<00:00:24.570> a<00:00:24.630> while<00:00:25.039> yeah

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
it is I haven't checked in a while yeah

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.790 
it is I haven't checked in a while yeah
so<00:00:26.369> for<00:00:26.699> one<00:00:27.150> upgrade<00:00:27.330> to<00:00:28.019> make<00:00:28.140> it<00:00:28.289> a<00:00:28.349> level<00:00:28.619> 2

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
so for one upgrade to make it a level 2

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.299 
so for one upgrade to make it a level 2
is<00:00:29.160> 3<00:00:30.060> million<00:00:30.480> elixir<00:00:30.900> and<00:00:31.260> I'm<00:00:31.410> up<00:00:31.560> to<00:00:31.830> almost

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
is 3 million elixir and I'm up to almost

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.880 
is 3 million elixir and I'm up to almost
a<00:00:32.460> million<00:00:32.840> so<00:00:33.840> I've<00:00:33.989> kind<00:00:34.290> of<00:00:34.350> been<00:00:34.469> farming

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.750 
that I haven't really had any challenges
with<00:01:04.470> my<00:01:04.500> base<00:01:04.830> even<00:01:05.220> even<00:01:05.549> here<00:01:05.729> that

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
with my base even even here that

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.370 
with my base even even here that
everyone<00:01:06.299> just<00:01:06.510> goes<00:01:06.750> for<00:01:07.280> my<00:01:08.810> Town<00:01:09.810> Hall<00:01:10.020> so

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
everyone just goes for my Town Hall so

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.539 
everyone just goes for my Town Hall so

base setup is probably gonna stick

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.539 
base setup is probably gonna stick

there<00:06:09.849> is<00:06:11.129> might<00:06:12.129> have<00:06:12.159> started<00:06:12.399> that<00:06:12.699> attack

00:06:12.929 --> 00:06:12.939 
there is might have started that attack

00:06:12.939 --> 00:06:15.029 
there is might have started that attack
