00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.510
 of the so- called family at nintendo 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.980

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.539
 the description we will talk about miu 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.160
 let's go back quickly to this period 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.960
 more than a pokemon game it's a 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.280
 smuggling phenomenon of cards to the 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.050
 playground and cartoons that 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.629
 smashed the kaka box the climax 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.219
 it was the film miu against better all one 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.100
 cartoon based on a video game 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.510
 go to the movies that's the class with 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.610
 personally a scene that will make me 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.829
 always whine but I know he's going 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.270
 survive in a few fit and shit 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.860
 but that's better just like everything 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.640
 good man pokemon master we do not shout 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.320
 in the big unknown 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.170
 as for even yu is low less to have the 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.280
 chance to see and even pokemon banos 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.300
 despite everything in provinces like me 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.859
 you had some people they 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.760
 had the guy who ties the slap I 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.739
 no longer to whom he was proposing the 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.750
 kindly to have it but winner do not 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.000
 you have shown replay and the other guy who 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.439
 had m 2 solutions the one where we go 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.540
 test them his solutions chelou power 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.560
 if it was a cheater or not, but that 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.689
 will see it right now 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.360
 now you push the truck next 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:20.040
 from the oceane and he appears race myth 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.320
 fabulous myth is one of the most 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.509
 wonderful who did not hear 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.299
 you were adopted explain the 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:29.430
 facts so we just ask to push 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.720
 a cannois that cs force or measure is 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.040
 everyone has more to stay this thing 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.530
 so we'll see if it's true or phony 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.840
 oh it's not so simple the oceane and the 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.490
 liner camin schengen acs cuts a 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.780
 once out of the boat it seems a little 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.299
 never come back in this area 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.860
 practice huh so to test it takes 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.479
 that a trade proofs a pokémon that 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.310
 has cut so no longer need the series this 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.960
 after we continue the adventure as if 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.820
 nothing was coming back with a pokemon 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.520
 who's surfing a scream for force and we'll see 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.740
 this myth the kids the truth is going 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.560
 gush out of this truck now all of 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.229
 after 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.250
 now right now oh there this 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:03.070
 not possible 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.899
 can you fucking can do what you do 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.490
 to do that I'm laughing today 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:06.759
 but we are kids we are in this 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.890
 state 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:10.030
 that day my childhood is gone 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.190
 know as the day you are told that the 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.450
 Santa Claus does not exist by that father 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.430
 Christmas does not exist because it's hitler 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.140
 who killed him so badly for nothing but 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.459
 good it's wasted time and it remains 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.580
 still a lot of myths around 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:22.239
 better the next opus the pnue in the 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.489
 city bugs 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:26.140
 so perso I always called this place 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:28.750
 empty bug some call it doctors 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.790
 sin city or bleach and y many names 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.470
 glitch place point a pretty well known bug 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.060
 is relatively simple to do we go to 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.680
 safari park tranquillou and did 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.810
 somewhere in dom we stand in front 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.440
 matching and hop on backup is one 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.000
 and turn it back on 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:44.620
 we take out the cake asks if we want 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.480
 go out we answer him direction the little 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.250
 hut once inside we do not 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.880
 move more one backup is one and 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.410
 on again 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.569
 we go out of the floor the guy we 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:54.220
 asked you want to go on a safari but 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:55.900
 it is in that it does not make sense that 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.880
 does not have a damn sense and is told 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.950
 and there we break we walk tralala 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:03.130
 and all of a sudden an alarm the end of 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.430
 safari but I'm out that it did not 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:05.230
 of sense 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:09.310
 you're back at the park entrance 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:11.650
 safari we know weppes armani when 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.600
 even not bad changed the new kids 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.430
 to the city bug a place of fantasy 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.680
 a lot of myths around we could 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:21.459
 show unep sailed worse or even a 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:24.010
 navy thank you jvc little I thought you 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:25.359
 and so in fact it's good for 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:27.549
 nothing but screw up your backup 

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:30.250
 small risks but they are there 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:31.480
 a useless and dangerous bug is like 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.340
 want to put a wall the night before 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.680
 of a partial without having revised it is 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.730
 dangerous useless idiot but what is it 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.069
 that it can be funny 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:40.569
 iolo can get a better one on the 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:42.430
 crimson ribs 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:43.959
 this one is one of the most known bugs 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:46.359
 of the game is one of the simplest and most 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:48.069
 do not worry too much about this 

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:49.569
 simple we take the sky gadget for us 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:50.200
 show how to capture a pokemon and 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:53.049
 We are leaving 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.189
 ouazine akram yeah that's it once again 

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:56.230
 the terminal runs along the right bank 

00:03:54.189 --> 00:03:57.909
 and boom a pokémon that surpasses the sunrise 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.500
 100 watts 

00:03:57.909 --> 00:04:01.540
 it's a skeleton potting soil that 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.950
 attack I think we woke up a 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:06.459
 power of another dimension 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:06.909
 his name is missing no one years and the 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:08.439
 bullshit 

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:10.239
 in fact it's a bit of memory and he 

00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:11.469
 looking for a pokemon in his base and he 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:13.659
 do not find the rope number and 

00:04:11.469 --> 00:04:14.019
 pokemon so missing number missing and 

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:16.359
 o 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:18.729
 the bug- type pokemon of the hotline 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:23.800
 self classifies at first but it's 

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:25.509
 still loose so we can find 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.669
 different pokemon that would change according to 

00:04:25.509 --> 00:04:28.150
 the name of your character in my life 

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:30.280

 peace to your soul of saving I found 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:35.680
 the atos swingers in 28 years at 4,542 but 

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:36.849

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.410

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:40.180
 pokemon down when we see that we can 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:41.470
 corrupt a party just a year be a 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:43.750
 tutoring while surfing on a coast 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:45.550
 oh yes I propose a technique 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.990
 incredible used by the biggest 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:47.320
 this technique is confidence in 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:49.449
 self 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:51.250
 nope there is a later technique the 

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:53.169
 many red hype blue talk about the day 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:55.750

 demolished his rival and bridge trainers at 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:16.360
 above and it takes one to arm as one says 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:18.669
 old proverb pada arm no 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:20.169
