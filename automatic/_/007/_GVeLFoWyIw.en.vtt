00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
Mau Mau revolution in Kenya is very

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.670 
Mau Mau revolution in Kenya is very
different<00:01:14.820> than<00:01:14.939> ours<00:01:15.270> because<00:01:15.540> he<00:01:16.439> probably

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
different than ours because he probably

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.440 
different than ours because he probably
grew<00:01:16.950> up<00:01:17.040> hearing<00:01:17.310> that<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.939> British<00:01:18.240> were<00:01:18.420> a

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.749 
grew up hearing that the British were a
bunch<00:01:18.630> of<00:01:18.780> imperialist<00:01:19.380> who<00:01:19.759> persecuted

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
bunch of imperialist who persecuted

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.300 
bunch of imperialist who persecuted
grandfather<00:01:21.479> I<00:01:21.720> he<00:01:22.020> despises<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.920> West<00:01:23.100> he

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
despises the Brits and I think he could

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.600 
despises the Brits and I think he could
take<00:01:25.229> it<00:01:25.259> all<00:01:25.500> out<00:01:25.530> on<00:01:25.710> Israel<00:01:26.250> and<00:01:26.340> that's<00:01:26.400> why

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
take it all out on Israel and that's why

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.480 
take it all out on Israel and that's why

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:03.199 
think I mean you seem to think there's
some<00:04:01.530> validity<00:04:01.620> the<00:04:02.100> fact<00:04:02.340> that<00:04:02.819> there<00:04:03.000> may<00:04:03.180> be

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
some validity the fact that there may be

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:05.390 
some validity the fact that there may be
some<00:04:03.540> fundamental<00:04:04.140> anti<00:04:04.560> Americanism<00:04:05.160> in

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
some fundamental anti Americanism in

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.580 
some fundamental anti Americanism in
this<00:04:05.549> president<00:04:06.000> well<00:04:06.930> and<00:04:07.109> that's<00:04:07.260> exactly

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
this president well and that's exactly

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.830 
this president well and that's exactly
the<00:04:07.890> point<00:04:08.100> that<00:04:08.310> I<00:04:08.370> make<00:04:08.579> in<00:04:08.730> the<00:04:08.760> book<00:04:08.850> and<00:04:09.299> I

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
the point that I make in the book and I

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.330 
the point that I make in the book and I
don't<00:04:10.019> know<00:04:10.260> why<00:04:10.380> these<00:04:10.440> reporters<00:04:11.069> maybe

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
don't know why these reporters maybe

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.910 
don't know why these reporters maybe
they<00:04:11.519> can't<00:04:11.760> read<00:04:12.030> I<00:04:12.329> guess<00:04:13.260> that's<00:04:13.500> part<00:04:13.769> of

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 
they can't read I guess that's part of

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.159 
they can't read I guess that's part of
it<00:04:14.069> because<00:04:14.430> it's<00:04:15.060> clearly<00:04:15.510> spelled<00:04:15.810> out<00:04:15.959> and

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
it because it's clearly spelled out and

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:18.680 
it because it's clearly spelled out and
I'm<00:04:16.229> quoting<00:04:16.440> a<00:04:16.680> British<00:04:17.010> newspaper<00:04:17.690> who

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
I'm quoting a British newspaper who

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:20.900 
I'm quoting a British newspaper who
really<00:04:19.530> were<00:04:19.650> expressing<00:04:20.070> the<00:04:20.340> outrage<00:04:20.729> of

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 
really were expressing the outrage of

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:22.909 
really were expressing the outrage of
the<00:04:20.970> Brits<00:04:21.329> for<00:04:21.870> that<00:04:22.019> bus<00:04:22.260> being<00:04:22.560> returned

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 
the Brits for that bus being returned

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:25.219 
the Brits for that bus being returned
and<00:04:23.130> the<00:04:23.669> point<00:04:23.970> was<00:04:24.210> that<00:04:24.240> they<00:04:24.570> felt<00:04:24.780> like<00:04:25.020> to

00:04:25.219 --> 00:04:25.229 
and the point was that they felt like to

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:27.690 
and the point was that they felt like to
do<00:04:25.440> to<00:04:26.030> Obama's

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:27.700 
do to Obama's

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.060 
do to Obama's
during<00:04:27.940> grandfather<00:04:28.480> it<00:04:29.140> could<00:04:29.380> be<00:04:29.560> that<00:04:29.770> his

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.070 
during grandfather it could be that his

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:32.490 
during grandfather it could be that his
version<00:04:30.340> of<00:04:30.640> and<00:04:31.120> and<00:04:31.360> you<00:04:31.690> about<00:04:31.960> the<00:04:32.140> mal<00:04:32.320> mal

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:32.500 
version of and and you about the mal mal

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.740 
version of and and you about the mal mal
revolution<00:04:33.130> was<00:04:33.280> very<00:04:33.520> different<00:04:34.000> than<00:04:34.480> most

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750 
revolution was very different than most

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:37.080 
revolution was very different than most
of<00:04:35.020> the<00:04:35.590> people<00:04:35.770> who<00:04:36.130> perhaps<00:04:36.490> would<00:04:36.880> grow<00:04:37.060> up

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.090 
of the people who perhaps would grow up

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:39.300 
of the people who perhaps would grow up
in<00:04:37.330> the<00:04:37.420> United<00:04:37.810> States<00:04:38.080> and<00:04:38.530> I<00:04:38.950> have<00:04:39.040> said

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:39.310 
in the United States and I have said

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:41.790 
in the United States and I have said
many<00:04:39.490> times<00:04:39.640> publicly<00:04:40.180> that<00:04:41.110> I<00:04:41.140> do<00:04:41.260> think<00:04:41.650> he

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 
many times publicly that I do think he

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:42.930 
many times publicly that I do think he
has<00:04:41.890> a<00:04:41.920> different<00:04:42.370> worldview

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:42.940 
has a different worldview

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:45.810 
has a different worldview
and<00:04:43.120> I<00:04:43.630> think<00:04:43.840> it's<00:04:43.960> in<00:04:44.110> part<00:04:44.340> molded<00:04:45.340> out<00:04:45.520> of<00:04:45.790> a

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:45.820 
and I think it's in part molded out of a

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:47.880 
and I think it's in part molded out of a
very<00:04:46.570> different<00:04:46.960> experience<00:04:47.050> most<00:04:47.650> of<00:04:47.740> us

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:47.890 
very different experience most of us

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:49.710 
very different experience most of us
grew<00:04:48.070> up<00:04:48.100> going<00:04:48.370> to<00:04:48.490> Boy<00:04:48.640> Scout<00:04:49.000> meetings<00:04:49.480> and

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:49.720 
grew up going to Boy Scout meetings and

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.630 
grew up going to Boy Scout meetings and
you<00:04:50.500> know<00:04:50.530> our<00:04:50.740> communities<00:04:51.250> were<00:04:51.400> filled

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:51.640 
you know our communities were filled

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:55.050 
you know our communities were filled
with<00:04:51.730> Rotary<00:04:52.150> clubs<00:04:52.510> not<00:04:53.290> madrasas<00:04:53.980> I<00:04:54.190> think

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:55.060 
with Rotary clubs not madrasas I think

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:58.350 
with Rotary clubs not madrasas I think
that<00:04:55.300> made<00:04:55.510> it<00:04:57.150> okay

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:58.360 
that made it okay

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:01.680 
that made it okay
saying<00:04:59.110> most<00:04:59.470> of<00:04:59.650> us<00:04:59.830> were<00:05:00.520> brought<00:05:01.120> up<00:05:01.390> in

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:01.690 
saying most of us were brought up in

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:03.630 
saying most of us were brought up in
communities<00:05:02.410> with<00:05:02.620> Boy<00:05:02.860> Scouts<00:05:03.190> on<00:05:03.370> Rotary
