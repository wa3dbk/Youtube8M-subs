00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.120 
going to be taking a look at all the
gameplay<00:00:06.180> we<00:00:06.540> have<00:00:06.689> so<00:00:06.990> far<00:00:07.229> of<00:00:07.410> Mario<00:00:07.859> in

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
gameplay we have so far of Mario in

00:00:08.130 --> 00:01:06.540 
gameplay we have so far of Mario in
Super<00:00:08.189> Smash<00:00:08.640> Bros<00:00:09.030> 4

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:06.550 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:39.670 

now

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:39.680 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:02:06.530 

I

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:04:11.860 

Oh

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:14.199 

out<00:04:12.769> of<00:04:12.860> all<00:04:12.980> the<00:04:13.069> characters<00:04:13.280> shown<00:04:13.700> so<00:04:13.970> far

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:14.209 
out of all the characters shown so far

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:16.449 
out of all the characters shown so far
we<00:04:14.450> probably<00:04:14.720> know<00:04:14.989> the<00:04:15.170> most<00:04:15.379> about<00:04:15.709> Mario

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:16.459 
we probably know the most about Mario

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:18.189 
we probably know the most about Mario
so<00:04:16.579> what<00:04:16.760> slow<00:04:17.030> it<00:04:17.150> down<00:04:17.180> and<00:04:17.600> take<00:04:17.750> a<00:04:17.810> look<00:04:18.019> at

00:04:18.189 --> 00:04:18.199 
so what slow it down and take a look at

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:20.110 
so what slow it down and take a look at
some<00:04:18.320> of<00:04:18.410> his<00:04:18.470> moves<00:04:18.859> starting<00:04:19.729> out<00:04:19.850> with<00:04:19.970> his

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.120 
some of his moves starting out with his

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.819 
some of his moves starting out with his
jab<00:04:20.359> attack<00:04:20.630> it<00:04:20.870> looks<00:04:21.049> similar<00:04:21.290> to<00:04:21.560> how<00:04:21.709> it

00:04:21.819 --> 00:04:21.829 
jab attack it looks similar to how it

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:23.620 
jab attack it looks similar to how it
wasn't<00:04:22.190> brawl<00:04:22.400> and<00:04:22.639> if<00:04:22.820> anything<00:04:23.210> looks<00:04:23.419> a<00:04:23.600> bit

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 
wasn't brawl and if anything looks a bit

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:26.080 
wasn't brawl and if anything looks a bit
faster<00:04:24.290> also<00:04:24.860> returning<00:04:25.310> from<00:04:25.430> brawl<00:04:25.699> is<00:04:25.940> this

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.090 
faster also returning from brawl is this

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:27.820 
faster also returning from brawl is this
dash<00:04:26.330> attack<00:04:26.690> which<00:04:26.990> again<00:04:27.260> looks<00:04:27.560> pretty

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
dash attack which again looks pretty

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:29.920 
dash attack which again looks pretty
useful<00:04:28.310> moving<00:04:28.910> on<00:04:29.000> to<00:04:29.120> his<00:04:29.240> up<00:04:29.419> tove<00:04:29.630> attack

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:29.930 
useful moving on to his up tove attack

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:31.719 
useful moving on to his up tove attack
it<00:04:30.199> looks<00:04:30.500> so<00:04:30.620> much<00:04:30.770> than<00:04:30.919> how<00:04:31.070> it<00:04:31.220> always<00:04:31.400> has

00:04:31.719 --> 00:04:31.729 
it looks so much than how it always has

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:33.490 
it looks so much than how it always has
but<00:04:32.060> this<00:04:32.210> time<00:04:32.419> around<00:04:32.750> looks<00:04:32.960> both<00:04:33.169> quicker

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:33.500 
but this time around looks both quicker

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.500 
but this time around looks both quicker
and<00:04:33.740> more<00:04:34.100> useful<00:04:34.340> followed<00:04:35.150> by<00:04:35.300> his

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:35.510 
and more useful followed by his

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:38.110 
and more useful followed by his
unchanged<00:04:36.260> forward<00:04:36.680> tilt<00:04:36.949> now<00:04:37.820> it<00:04:37.880> was<00:04:37.970> down

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 
unchanged forward tilt now it was down

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:39.850 
unchanged forward tilt now it was down
tilts<00:04:38.510> a<00:04:38.570> different<00:04:38.870> story<00:04:39.229> although<00:04:39.740> it

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:39.860 
tilts a different story although it

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:41.530 
tilts a different story although it
looks<00:04:40.010> very<00:04:40.220> similar<00:04:40.460> to<00:04:40.760> how<00:04:40.910> it<00:04:41.060> always<00:04:41.210> has

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:41.540 
looks very similar to how it always has

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:43.330 
looks very similar to how it always has
it<00:04:41.900> looks<00:04:42.080> much<00:04:42.380> quicker<00:04:42.650> and<00:04:42.979> might<00:04:43.190> actually

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.340 
it looks much quicker and might actually

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:45.969 
it looks much quicker and might actually
be<00:04:43.639> useful<00:04:43.729> this<00:04:44.330> time<00:04:44.510> around<00:04:44.810> his<00:04:45.380> for<00:04:45.620> smash

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:45.979 
be useful this time around his for smash

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:47.350 
be useful this time around his for smash
attack<00:04:46.370> looks<00:04:46.699> like<00:04:46.850> a<00:04:46.880> very<00:04:47.120> powerful

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:47.360 
attack looks like a very powerful

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.450 
attack looks like a very powerful
finishing<00:04:48.050> move<00:04:48.260> with<00:04:48.680> a<00:04:48.710> decent<00:04:48.979> amount<00:04:49.220> of

gamers<00:05:46.729> think<00:05:47.060> of<00:05:47.150> Mario<00:05:47.449> so<00:05:47.660> far<00:05:47.930> he's<00:05:48.440> the

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:48.470 
gamers think of Mario so far he's the

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:50.500 
gamers think of Mario so far he's the
first<00:05:48.860> character<00:05:49.310> that<00:05:49.490> has<00:05:49.699> had<00:05:49.970> all<00:05:50.270> his

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:50.510 
first character that has had all his

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:52.120 
first character that has had all his
moves<00:05:50.780> shown<00:05:50.930> off<00:05:51.139> at<00:05:51.470> least<00:05:51.800> to<00:05:51.949> my<00:05:52.099> knowledge

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:52.130 
moves shown off at least to my knowledge

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:54.430 
moves shown off at least to my knowledge
and<00:05:52.669> they<00:05:53.060> all<00:05:53.240> look<00:05:53.539> very<00:05:53.570> similar<00:05:54.139> to<00:05:54.320> his

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:54.440 
and they all look very similar to his

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:56.500 
and they all look very similar to his
moves<00:05:54.710> in<00:05:54.919> brawl<00:05:55.160> personally<00:05:56.090> I<00:05:56.120> would<00:05:56.389> have

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:56.510 
moves in brawl personally I would have

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:58.360 
moves in brawl personally I would have
loved<00:05:56.810> to<00:05:56.870> see<00:05:57.050> his<00:05:57.139> recovery<00:05:57.590> improved<00:05:58.039> but

00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:58.370 
loved to see his recovery improved but

00:05:58.370 --> 00:05:59.890 
loved to see his recovery improved but
on<00:05:58.490> the<00:05:58.580> other<00:05:58.760> hand<00:05:59.060> he<00:05:59.270> does<00:05:59.479> look<00:05:59.720> a<00:05:59.810> little

00:05:59.890 --> 00:05:59.900 
on the other hand he does look a little

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:01.600 
on the other hand he does look a little
more<00:06:00.139> powerful<00:06:00.470> than<00:06:00.770> how<00:06:00.949> he<00:06:01.010> wasn't<00:06:01.430> brawl

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:01.610 
more powerful than how he wasn't brawl

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:03.550 
more powerful than how he wasn't brawl
