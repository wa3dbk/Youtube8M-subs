00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.430 
and you know it's against use in that
case<00:01:44.910> I<00:01:45.030> was<00:01:45.149> very<00:01:45.450> very<00:01:45.660> nervous<00:01:45.960> actually

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:46.440 
case I was very very nervous actually

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.290 
case I was very very nervous actually
going<00:01:46.590> on<00:01:46.710> stage<00:01:46.979> but<00:01:47.640> after<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:47.970> very<00:01:48.119> first

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:48.300 
going on stage but after the very first

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:49.880 
going on stage but after the very first
time<00:01:48.450> I've<00:01:48.630> done<00:01:48.780> it<00:01:48.840> it<00:01:49.380> only<00:01:49.500> helped<00:01:49.830> me

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
time I've done it it only helped me

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.590 
time I've done it it only helped me
because<00:01:50.369> then<00:01:50.550> you<00:01:50.670> get<00:01:50.910> the<00:01:51.000> feeling<00:01:51.300> as<00:01:51.390> well

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
because then you get the feeling as well

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.810 
because then you get the feeling as well
like<00:01:51.869> it<00:01:52.080> carries<00:01:52.619> you<00:01:52.649> so<00:01:53.310> if<00:01:53.369> you<00:01:53.460> do<00:01:53.610> get<00:01:53.790> a

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
like it carries you so if you do get a

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.400 
like it carries you so if you do get a
good<00:01:53.970> start<00:01:54.300> if<00:01:54.450> you<00:01:54.540> do<00:01:54.660> do<00:01:54.899> something<00:01:55.140> really

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:55.410 
good start if you do do something really

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:57.620 
good start if you do do something really
good<00:01:55.619> in<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:55.979> game<00:01:56.160> you<00:01:56.850> hear<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.090> crowd<00:01:57.300> and

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
good in the game you hear the crowd and

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.570 
good in the game you hear the crowd and
you<00:01:57.899> just<00:01:58.110> take<00:01:58.530> it<00:01:58.710> and<00:01:58.860> you<00:01:58.979> roll<00:01:59.310> with<00:01:59.550> it

00:01:59.570 --> 00:01:59.580 
you just take it and you roll with it

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.490 
you just take it and you roll with it
but<00:02:00.390> I<00:02:00.420> like<00:02:00.569> to<00:02:00.660> think<00:02:00.899> okay<00:02:01.110> well<00:02:01.319> the<00:02:01.470> good

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
kind of motivated me to instead of

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.550 
kind of motivated me to instead of
thinking<00:02:11.790> that<00:02:12.060> they<00:02:12.510> are<00:02:12.540> there<00:02:12.870> I<00:02:13.080> try<00:02:13.500> to

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
thinking that they are there I try to

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.570 
thinking that they are there I try to
think<00:02:13.770> that<00:02:13.920> they<00:02:14.040> are<00:02:14.069> there<00:02:14.250> for<00:02:14.280> a<00:02:14.459> good

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
think that they are there for a good

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:15.890 
think that they are there for a good
thing<00:02:14.790> you<00:02:14.910> know<00:02:15.000> like<00:02:15.030> they<00:02:15.569> are<00:02:15.600> cheering

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
thing you know like they are cheering

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.110 
thing you know like they are cheering
not<00:02:16.200> a<00:02:16.230> boon<00:02:16.680> or<00:02:16.980> to<00:02:17.190> watch<00:02:17.400> what<00:02:17.610> I<00:02:17.640> do<00:02:17.760> but<00:02:18.060> to

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
not a boon or to watch what I do but to

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.150 
not a boon or to watch what I do but to
cheer<00:02:18.900> before<00:02:19.319> your<00:02:19.470> in<00:02:19.620> game<00:02:19.770> you<00:02:19.830> are<00:02:20.069> of

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
cheer before your in game you are of

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.800 
cheer before your in game you are of
course<00:02:20.190> really<00:02:20.580> nervous<00:02:20.880> about<00:02:21.240> everything

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
course really nervous about everything

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.290 
course really nervous about everything
and<00:02:21.959> then<00:02:22.620> when<00:02:23.220> you<00:02:23.370> get<00:02:23.550> into<00:02:23.790> the<00:02:23.910> game<00:02:24.060> I

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
and then when you get into the game I

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:25.850 
and then when you get into the game I
don't<00:02:24.569> really<00:02:24.870> even<00:02:24.959> notice<00:02:25.319> the<00:02:25.470> crowd<00:02:25.709> I

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
don't really even notice the crowd I

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.650 
don't really even notice the crowd I
just<00:02:26.190> try<00:02:26.400> my<00:02:26.580> best<00:02:26.700> to<00:02:26.819> focus<00:02:26.970> on<00:02:27.209> the<00:02:27.300> game

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
just try my best to focus on the game

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.020 
just try my best to focus on the game
I<00:02:27.690> think<00:02:28.200> nervousness<00:02:29.160> actually<00:02:29.580> helps<00:02:29.790> me<00:02:29.940> in

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
I think nervousness actually helps me in

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.520 
I think nervousness actually helps me in
many<00:02:30.150> ways<00:02:30.270> because<00:02:30.780> it<00:02:31.020> makes<00:02:31.200> me<00:02:31.319> play<00:02:31.470> so

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
many ways because it makes me play so

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.170 
many ways because it makes me play so
much<00:02:31.800> better<00:02:32.040> than<00:02:32.220> I<00:02:32.340> usually<00:02:32.490> do<00:02:32.790> because<00:02:32.910> I

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
much better than I usually do because I

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.059 
much better than I usually do because I
always<00:02:33.300> think<00:02:34.020> twice<00:02:34.170> about<00:02:34.319> everything<00:02:34.920> I<00:02:35.010> do

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
always think twice about everything I do

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:36.860 
always think twice about everything I do
I<00:02:35.370> don't<00:02:35.880> really<00:02:36.030> have<00:02:36.150> a<00:02:36.180> tactic<00:02:36.569> actually

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
I don't really have a tactic actually

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.449 
I don't really have a tactic actually
it's<00:02:36.990> just<00:02:37.080> sort<00:02:37.410> of<00:02:37.500> the<00:02:37.620> person<00:02:37.950> I<00:02:38.010> am<00:02:38.190> I've

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
it's just sort of the person I am I've

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:40.190

impact of remote audiences on a player
so<00:06:04.719> I<00:06:04.750> put<00:06:05.080> the<00:06:05.139> question<00:06:05.259> to<00:06:05.620> the<00:06:05.710> fnatic<00:06:06.129> guys

00:06:06.269 --> 00:06:06.279 
so I put the question to the fnatic guys

00:06:06.279 --> 00:06:08.369 
so I put the question to the fnatic guys
to<00:06:06.550> get<00:06:06.699> their<00:06:06.849> insight<00:06:07.150> either<00:06:07.900> semis<00:06:08.169> there

00:06:08.369 --> 00:06:08.379 
to get their insight either semis there

00:06:08.379 --> 00:06:11.640 
to get their insight either semis there
is<00:06:08.469> think<00:06:08.770> a<00:06:08.949> 100k<00:06:09.490> won<00:06:09.999> 1<00:06:10.509> million<00:06:10.749> what

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:11.650 
is think a 100k won 1 million what

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:12.989 
is think a 100k won 1 million what
really<00:06:11.830> matters<00:06:12.129> is<00:06:12.249> that<00:06:12.279> people<00:06:12.400> you<00:06:12.759> see<00:06:12.969> in

00:06:12.989 --> 00:06:12.999 
really matters is that people you see in

00:06:12.999 --> 00:06:14.129 
really matters is that people you see in
front<00:06:13.180> of<00:06:13.300> you<00:06:13.419> you<00:06:13.509> know<00:06:13.629> because<00:06:13.900> I<00:06:13.930> think

00:06:14.129 --> 00:06:14.139 
front of you you know because I think

00:06:14.139 --> 00:06:17.070 
front of you you know because I think
everyone<00:06:15.069> counts<00:06:15.550> like<00:06:15.729> the<00:06:15.939> stream<00:06:16.210> as<00:06:16.509> one

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:17.080 
everyone counts like the stream as one

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:18.570 
everyone counts like the stream as one
people<00:06:17.289> one<00:06:17.620> person<00:06:17.800> you<00:06:18.009> have<00:06:18.129> a<00:06:18.159> camera<00:06:18.430> on

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:18.580 
people one person you have a camera on

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:19.920 
people one person you have a camera on
you<00:06:18.699> but<00:06:19.180> you<00:06:19.240> don't<00:06:19.360> even<00:06:19.449> think<00:06:19.659> about<00:06:19.810> that

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:19.930 
you but you don't even think about that

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:21.629 
you but you don't even think about that
you<00:06:20.110> think<00:06:20.169> the<00:06:20.379> cameras<00:06:20.710> are<00:06:20.860> there<00:06:20.889> too<00:06:21.460> so

00:06:21.629 --> 00:06:21.639 
you think the cameras are there too so

00:06:21.639 --> 00:06:23.670 
you think the cameras are there too so
it's<00:06:21.819> tough<00:06:22.060> for<00:06:22.240> the<00:06:22.360> people<00:06:22.659> in<00:06:22.779> the<00:06:22.900> place

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:23.680 
it's tough for the people in the place

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:26.550 
it's tough for the people in the place
so<00:06:24.370> for<00:06:25.180> me<00:06:25.360> I<00:06:25.389> really<00:06:25.659> never<00:06:26.080> thought<00:06:26.199> about

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:26.560 
so for me I really never thought about

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:27.990 
so for me I really never thought about
it<00:06:26.710> it<00:06:26.860> was<00:06:27.009> never<00:06:27.129> a<00:06:27.279> problem

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:28.000 
it it was never a problem

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.570 
it it was never a problem
I<00:06:28.029> never<00:06:28.539> thought<00:06:28.839> if<00:06:28.990> it<00:06:29.080> was<00:06:29.139> 100<00:06:29.710> K<00:06:29.860> or<00:06:30.009> 300<00:06:30.430> K

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:30.580 
I never thought if it was 100 K or 300 K

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:31.769 
I never thought if it was 100 K or 300 K
I<00:06:30.610> never<00:06:30.939> thought<00:06:31.089> it<00:06:31.210> because<00:06:31.419> I<00:06:31.539> don't<00:06:31.689> even

00:06:31.769 --> 00:06:31.779 
I never thought it because I don't even

00:06:31.779 --> 00:06:33.600 
I never thought it because I don't even
know<00:06:31.960> until<00:06:32.110> the<00:06:32.289> game<00:06:32.409> is<00:06:32.439> over<00:06:32.620> anyway<00:06:32.979> so<00:06:33.069> so
