00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
when I was putting that game play

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.360 
when I was putting that game play
together<00:00:33.660> that<00:00:34.500> it<00:00:34.620> wasn't<00:00:34.920> actually<00:00:35.010> the

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
together that it wasn't actually the

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.729 
together that it wasn't actually the
best<00:00:35.489> one<00:00:35.700> had<00:00:35.820> acquired<00:00:36.149> and<00:00:36.570> I<00:00:37.410> was<00:00:37.530> sort<00:00:37.649> of

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
looking at thinking just look at this

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.299 
looking at thinking just look at this
one<00:00:39.120> open<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.660> time<00:00:39.989> frame<00:00:40.410> sort<00:00:40.770> of<00:00:40.829> suited

me<00:03:37.450> up<00:03:37.540> to<00:03:37.750> a<00:03:37.780> couple<00:03:38.079> of<00:03:38.139> his<00:03:38.260> videos<00:03:38.470> and<00:03:38.829> I

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:38.859 
me up to a couple of his videos and I

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:41.220 
me up to a couple of his videos and I
watched<00:03:39.099> one<00:03:39.519> which<00:03:40.510> funnily<00:03:40.870> enough<00:03:40.870> was

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
watched one which funnily enough was

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.770 
watched one which funnily enough was
talking<00:03:41.650> about<00:03:41.950> do<00:03:42.370> shoutouts<00:03:42.669> really<00:03:43.269> work<00:03:43.450> I

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
talking about do shoutouts really work I

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:44.940 
talking about do shoutouts really work I
think<00:03:44.169> I<00:03:44.260> think<00:03:44.440> that<00:03:44.560> was<00:03:44.650> the<00:03:44.680> one<00:03:44.829> eating

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
think I think that was the one eating

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:46.349 
think I think that was the one eating
meat<00:03:45.190> or<00:03:45.370> could<00:03:45.549> be<00:03:45.579> wrong<00:03:45.760> about<00:03:45.910> that<00:03:46.060> but

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:46.359 
meat or could be wrong about that but

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:47.670 
meat or could be wrong about that but
anyway<00:03:46.450> and<00:03:46.810> you're<00:03:46.930> not<00:03:47.049> watching<00:03:47.230> that<00:03:47.410> one

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
anyway and you're not watching that one

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.460 
anyway and you're not watching that one
and<00:03:48.310> I<00:03:48.549> thought<00:03:48.790> this<00:03:49.389> is<00:03:49.450> good<00:03:49.870> I<00:03:50.109> like<00:03:50.290> this

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
and I thought this is good I like this

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.440 
and I thought this is good I like this

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:19.210 
especially when they put so much hard

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:20.880 
especially when they put so much hard
working<00:06:19.630> and<00:06:19.720> so<00:06:19.960> much<00:06:20.110> thought<00:06:20.380> into<00:06:20.440> their

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:20.890 
working and so much thought into their

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:23.220 
working and so much thought into their
content<00:06:21.400> it<00:06:21.550> almost<00:06:21.790> doesn't<00:06:22.060> seem<00:06:22.210> fair<00:06:22.750> they

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:23.230 
content it almost doesn't seem fair they

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:24.780 
content it almost doesn't seem fair they
have<00:06:23.320> these<00:06:23.470> bigger<00:06:23.770> guys<00:06:24.070> leapfrogging

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:24.790 
have these bigger guys leapfrogging

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:26.820 
have these bigger guys leapfrogging
their<00:06:25.150> channels<00:06:25.570> in<00:06:25.720> subscribers<00:06:26.260> when<00:06:26.650> their

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:26.830 
their channels in subscribers when their

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:29.430 
their channels in subscribers when their
content<00:06:27.250> isn't<00:06:27.460> even<00:06:27.850> a<00:06:27.940> contour<00:06:28.570> is<00:06:28.720> good<00:06:28.960> so

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:29.440 
content isn't even a contour is good so

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:31.230 
content isn't even a contour is good so
go<00:06:29.590> check<00:06:29.800> out<00:06:29.980> Higgs<00:06:30.220> e<00:06:30.430> double<00:06:30.730> 07<00:06:30.850> in<00:06:31.210> the
