up there and I really hope that they add
more<00:01:46.700> actual<00:01:47.600> Honda's<00:01:47.960> to<00:01:48.110> these<00:01:48.259> because

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
more actual Honda's to these because

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.469 
more actual Honda's to these because
these<00:01:48.860> will<00:01:49.039> be<00:01:49.189> a<00:01:49.219> nice<00:01:49.490> fun<00:01:49.820> to<00:01:49.969> do<00:01:50.149> with<00:01:50.360> a

my<00:01:56.959> views<00:01:57.229> are<00:01:57.350> beginning<00:01:57.709> I've<00:01:57.799> changed

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
my views are beginning I've changed

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:59.889 
my views are beginning I've changed
after<00:01:58.490> being<00:01:58.700> online<00:01:58.850> and<00:01:59.390> it's<00:01:59.539> just<00:01:59.719> that

00:01:59.889 --> 00:01:59.899 
after being online and it's just that

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:03.340 
after being online and it's just that
makes<00:02:00.110> the<00:02:00.319> environment<00:02:00.770> a<00:02:00.799> lot<00:02:00.920> more<00:02:01.100> fun<00:02:02.350> and

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
makes the environment a lot more fun and

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.289 
makes the environment a lot more fun and
it's<00:02:03.619> I<00:02:03.920> don't<00:02:04.189> know<00:02:04.340> it's<00:02:04.520> just<00:02:04.579> awesome<00:02:04.909> to

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:05.299 
it's I don't know it's just awesome to

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:07.480 
it's I don't know it's just awesome to
get<00:02:05.420> just<00:02:06.079> cruising<00:02:06.590> going<00:02:06.890> compared<00:02:07.399> to

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
get just cruising going compared to

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.330 
get just cruising going compared to
Forza<00:02:07.789> 4<00:02:07.939> right<00:02:08.209> so<00:02:08.479> obviously<00:02:09.259> my<00:02:09.829> pull<00:02:10.130> is<00:02:10.310> a

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
Forza 4 right so obviously my pull is a

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.460 
Forza 4 right so obviously my pull is a
little<00:02:10.579> bit<00:02:10.700> better<00:02:10.819> I<00:02:11.000> did<00:02:11.390> have<00:02:11.630> street

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
little bit better I did have street

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.140 
little bit better I did have street
tires<00:02:12.680> on<00:02:12.950> this<00:02:13.160> because<00:02:13.400> the<00:02:13.670> fact<00:02:13.910> that<00:02:14.060> I

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
tires on this because the fact that I

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:15.490 
tires on this because the fact that I
wanted<00:02:14.480> a<00:02:14.569> little<00:02:14.660> bit<00:02:14.780> more<00:02:14.840> horsepower<00:02:15.380> and

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
wanted a little bit more horsepower and

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.140 
wanted a little bit more horsepower and
it<00:02:15.769> did<00:02:15.950> and<00:02:16.130> then<00:02:16.220> ripping<00:02:16.549> which<00:02:16.730> was<00:02:16.910> nice

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
it did and then ripping which was nice

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.130 
it did and then ripping which was nice
too<00:02:17.480> so<00:02:18.940> we'll<00:02:19.940> be<00:02:20.060> more<00:02:20.239> I<00:02:20.540> will<00:02:20.900> be<00:02:20.989> doing

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
too so we'll be more I will be doing

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:22.539 
too so we'll be more I will be doing
more<00:02:21.290> videos<00:02:21.349> of<00:02:21.799> those<00:02:21.920> street<00:02:22.220> racers

00:02:22.539 --> 00:02:22.549 
more videos of those street racers

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:23.890 
more videos of those street racers
because<00:02:22.790> those<00:02:22.970> are<00:02:23.090> sick<00:02:23.329> probably<00:02:23.810> with

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
because those are sick probably with

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.750 
because those are sick probably with
different<00:02:24.200> cars<00:02:24.410> leg<00:02:24.739> ragini<00:02:25.069> stuff<00:02:25.579> like

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
different cars leg ragini stuff like

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.539 
different cars leg ragini stuff like
that<00:02:25.910> supercars<00:02:26.599> but<00:02:26.900> from<00:02:27.860> right<00:02:28.010> now<00:02:28.160> we<00:02:28.220> are

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:28.549 
that supercars but from right now we are

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:30.970 
that supercars but from right now we are
doing<00:02:28.730> some<00:02:29.000> drifting<00:02:29.450> I<00:02:29.630> was<00:02:29.989> just<00:02:30.650> killing

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
doing some drifting I was just killing

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.670 
doing some drifting I was just killing
drifting<00:02:31.489> last<00:02:31.670> night<00:02:31.880> with<00:02:32.030> my<00:02:32.120> Mustang<00:02:32.680> and

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
drifting last night with my Mustang and

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.259 
drifting last night with my Mustang and
also<00:02:33.980> keep<00:02:34.099> in<00:02:34.190> mind<00:02:34.370> these<00:02:34.579> are<00:02:34.640> just<00:02:34.970> roads

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:35.269 
also keep in mind these are just roads

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:37.360 
also keep in mind these are just roads
that<00:02:35.420> we<00:02:35.599> just<00:02:35.810> decided<00:02:36.260> to<00:02:36.290> just<00:02:36.530> go<00:02:37.040> free<00:02:37.340> on

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
that we just decided to just go free on

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.059 
that we just decided to just go free on
just<00:02:37.910> start<00:02:38.150> drifting<00:02:38.420> and<00:02:38.840> see<00:02:39.769> we're<00:02:39.920> really

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:40.069 
just start drifting and see we're really

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:42.819 
just start drifting and see we're really
where<00:02:40.340> it<00:02:40.430> takes<00:02:40.610> us<00:02:41.319> I<00:02:42.319> don't<00:02:42.530> really<00:02:42.680> know

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:42.829 
where it takes us I don't really know

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:46.059 
where it takes us I don't really know
the<00:02:42.950> map<00:02:43.130> too<00:02:43.370> well<00:02:43.549> right<00:02:43.579> now<00:02:43.790> but<00:02:44.889> we<00:02:45.889> have

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:46.069 
the map too well right now but we have

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:47.949 
the map too well right now but we have
found<00:02:46.310> some<00:02:46.579> decent<00:02:46.970> spots<00:02:47.209> as<00:02:47.420> I<00:02:47.569> said<00:02:47.720> I<00:02:47.750> will

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
found some decent spots as I said I will

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:50.440 
found some decent spots as I said I will
be<00:02:48.079> doing<00:02:48.260> a<00:02:48.590> drifting<00:02:49.040> spot<00:02:49.280> video<00:02:49.639> on<00:02:49.970> sort

be doing a drifting spot video on sort
of<00:02:50.540> sections<00:02:50.989> and<00:02:51.139> circuits<00:02:51.590> that<00:02:51.769> I<00:02:51.829> like

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
of sections and circuits that I like

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.280 
of sections and circuits that I like
doing<00:02:52.310> and<00:02:52.940> I<00:02:53.239> think<00:02:53.299> that<00:02:53.600> you<00:02:53.690> guys<00:02:53.840> a<00:02:53.900> little

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:00.859 
- so I'm drifting here my buddy mafioso

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:04.270 
- so I'm drifting here my buddy mafioso
he's<00:03:01.250> the<00:03:01.400> co-leader<00:03:01.910> of<00:03:01.940> dope<00:03:02.690> and<00:03:03.280> we're

he's the co-leader of dope and we're

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:05.500 
he's the co-leader of dope and we're
just<00:03:04.489> killing<00:03:04.760> it<00:03:04.910> right<00:03:04.970> now<00:03:05.090> we're<00:03:05.420> just

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
just killing it right now we're just

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:07.720 
just killing it right now we're just
sliding<00:03:05.989> I<00:03:06.049> got<00:03:06.260> my<00:03:06.380> wheel<00:03:06.590> oh<00:03:06.829> and<00:03:07.069> I<00:03:07.489> have<00:03:07.700> to

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
sliding I got my wheel oh and I have to

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:09.610 
sliding I got my wheel oh and I have to
say<00:03:08.030> the<00:03:08.180> wheel<00:03:08.389> feels<00:03:08.750> really<00:03:09.200> nice<00:03:09.319> with

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
say the wheel feels really nice with

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:12.280 
say the wheel feels really nice with
this<00:03:09.769> game<00:03:10.239> the<00:03:11.239> only<00:03:11.450> problem<00:03:11.840> is<00:03:11.930> the<00:03:12.079> horse

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
this game the only problem is the horse

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.559 
this game the only problem is the horse
feedback<00:03:12.650> on<00:03:12.859> the<00:03:13.010> dirt<00:03:13.280> is<00:03:13.579> a<00:03:14.030> little<00:03:14.450> bit

00:03:14.559 --> 00:03:14.569 
feedback on the dirt is a little bit

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:15.400 
feedback on the dirt is a little bit
rough

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
rough

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:16.690 
rough
obviously<00:03:16.040> that's<00:03:16.099> the<00:03:16.250> way<00:03:16.340> it<00:03:16.400> would<00:03:16.519> be<00:03:16.579> in

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
obviously that's the way it would be in

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.300 
obviously that's the way it would be in
real<00:03:16.910> life<00:03:17.090> with<00:03:17.269> these<00:03:17.389> curves<00:03:17.690> but<00:03:18.099> it<00:03:19.099> is<00:03:19.280> a

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
real life with these curves but it is a

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.069 
real life with these curves but it is a
very<00:03:19.639> hard<00:03:19.880> to<00:03:20.060> slide<00:03:20.299> at<00:03:20.450> the<00:03:20.540> dirt<00:03:20.720> because

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:21.079 
very hard to slide at the dirt because

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:22.690 
very hard to slide at the dirt because
of<00:03:21.200> that<00:03:21.319> and<00:03:21.650> it<00:03:21.709> makes<00:03:21.889> the<00:03:22.040> wheels<00:03:22.280> kind<00:03:22.519> of

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
of that and it makes the wheels kind of

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.150 
of that and it makes the wheels kind of
slippery<00:03:23.180> as<00:03:23.269> well<00:03:23.540> -<00:03:23.750> so<00:03:23.810> I<00:03:24.380> do<00:03:24.680> like<00:03:24.980> what

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
slippery as well - so I do like what

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:26.339 
slippery as well - so I do like what
they've<00:03:25.340> done<00:03:25.370> in<00:03:25.849> terms

00:03:26.339 --> 00:03:26.349 
they've done in terms

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:28.170 
they've done in terms
I<00:03:26.379> think<00:03:26.709> traction<00:03:27.159> for<00:03:27.310> the<00:03:27.370> wheels<00:03:27.609> and<00:03:27.879> dirt

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
I think traction for the wheels and dirt

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.539 
I think traction for the wheels and dirt
and<00:03:28.510> off<00:03:28.659> traction<00:03:29.230> and<00:03:29.319> stuff<00:03:29.469> like<00:03:29.590> that<00:03:29.829> but

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:30.549 
and off traction and stuff like that but

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:34.170 
and off traction and stuff like that but
it's<00:03:31.359> definitely<00:03:32.430> it<00:03:33.430> is<00:03:33.459> definitely<00:03:33.909> fun<00:03:34.030> to

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
it's definitely it is definitely fun to

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.199 
it's definitely it is definitely fun to
drift<00:03:34.420> with<00:03:34.480> and<00:03:34.950> I<00:03:35.950> could<00:03:36.549> see<00:03:36.700> myself<00:03:36.849> doing

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.209 
drift with and I could see myself doing

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:38.910 
drift with and I could see myself doing
this<00:03:37.359> a<00:03:37.420> lot<00:03:37.659> more<00:03:37.900> just<00:03:38.379> cruising<00:03:38.769> with<00:03:38.859> a

00:03:52.289 --> 00:03:52.299 
video of just drifting with a bunch of

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:54.330 
video of just drifting with a bunch of
people<00:03:52.480> another<00:03:53.079> montage<00:03:53.560> and<00:03:53.919> actually<00:03:54.219> was

posted<00:03:56.590> yesterday<00:03:56.709> it<00:03:56.980> was<00:03:57.099> just<00:03:57.129> a<00:03:57.370> 30<00:03:57.609> minute

00:03:57.899 --> 00:03:57.909 
posted yesterday it was just a 30 minute

00:03:57.909 --> 00:03:59.789 
posted yesterday it was just a 30 minute
clip<00:03:58.150> just<00:03:58.389> to<00:03:58.480> see<00:03:58.689> the<00:03:58.930> camera<00:03:59.290> angles<00:03:59.650> and

00:03:59.789 --> 00:03:59.799 
clip just to see the camera angles and

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:01.379 
clip just to see the camera angles and
see<00:03:59.919> how<00:04:00.040> it<00:04:00.189> actually<00:04:00.489> turns<00:04:00.730> out<00:04:00.909> so<00:04:01.180> I<00:04:01.209> was

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:01.389 
see how it actually turns out so I was

00:04:01.389 --> 00:04:02.580 
see how it actually turns out so I was
very<00:04:01.599> impressed<00:04:01.989> with<00:04:02.079> it

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590 
very impressed with it

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:04.949 
very impressed with it
I<00:04:02.620> do<00:04:03.549> appreciate<00:04:03.939> all<00:04:04.389> the<00:04:04.569> feedback<00:04:04.599> that

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:04.959 
I do appreciate all the feedback that

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:08.099 
I do appreciate all the feedback that
was<00:04:05.260> done<00:04:05.409> in<00:04:05.500> that<00:04:05.620> video<00:04:05.889> and<00:04:06.629> and<00:04:07.629> I<00:04:08.079> mean

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:08.109 
was done in that video and and I mean

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:09.780 
was done in that video and and I mean
definitely<00:04:08.500> expect<00:04:08.949> a<00:04:09.040> lot<00:04:09.159> more<00:04:09.370> to<00:04:09.430> come<00:04:09.609> in

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:09.790 
definitely expect a lot more to come in

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:12.059 
definitely expect a lot more to come in
terms<00:04:09.939> of<00:04:10.120> the<00:04:10.239> drifting<00:04:10.629> in<00:04:10.780> terms<00:04:10.989> of<00:04:11.199> build

00:04:12.059 --> 00:04:12.069 
terms of the drifting in terms of build

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:13.709 
terms of the drifting in terms of build
those<00:04:12.430> actual<00:04:12.730> camera<00:04:13.120> angles<00:04:13.419> I<00:04:13.480> will<00:04:13.629> be

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:13.719 
those actual camera angles I will be

00:04:13.719 --> 00:04:15.569 
those actual camera angles I will be
getting<00:04:13.810> a<00:04:13.930> lot<00:04:14.079> more<00:04:14.109> camera<00:04:14.590> cars<00:04:14.799> I'll<00:04:15.459> be

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:15.579 
getting a lot more camera cars I'll be

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:17.460 
getting a lot more camera cars I'll be
honest<00:04:15.790> and<00:04:15.909> probably<00:04:16.239> gunner<00:04:16.449> 4<00:04:16.720> 5<00:04:16.900> 6<00:04:17.139> 8<00:04:17.320> to

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 
honest and probably gunner 4 5 6 8 to

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:19.560 
honest and probably gunner 4 5 6 8 to
come<00:04:17.650> back<00:04:17.799> as<00:04:18.039> a<00:04:18.070> camera<00:04:18.459> car<00:04:18.669> as<00:04:19.150> well<00:04:19.539> as

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
come back as a camera car as well as

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:22.350 
come back as a camera car as well as
maybe<00:04:19.810> dr.<00:04:20.139> dreamy<00:04:20.590> too<00:04:20.829> so<00:04:21.120> there's<00:04:22.120> gonna<00:04:22.270> be

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 
maybe dr. dreamy too so there's gonna be

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.120 
maybe dr. dreamy too so there's gonna be
some<00:04:22.479> big<00:04:22.780> stuff<00:04:23.020> happening<00:04:23.440> with<00:04:23.500> the<00:04:23.740> with

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
some big stuff happening with the with

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.610 
some big stuff happening with the with
the<00:04:24.280> drifting<00:04:24.639> and<00:04:25.120> I<00:04:25.750> could<00:04:26.199> definitely<00:04:26.320> see

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:26.620 
the drifting and I could definitely see

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.710 
the drifting and I could definitely see
us<00:04:26.830> going<00:04:27.190> pretty<00:04:27.910> big<00:04:28.090> with<00:04:28.210> these<00:04:28.360> videos

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 
us going pretty big with these videos

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.240 
us going pretty big with these videos
and<00:04:29.050> just<00:04:29.139> camera<00:04:29.530> angles<00:04:29.860> and<00:04:29.949> stuff<00:04:30.130> like

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.250 
and just camera angles and stuff like

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:32.490 
and just camera angles and stuff like
that<00:04:30.460> and<00:04:30.759> honestly<00:04:31.330> with<00:04:31.840> my<00:04:32.020> vision<00:04:32.349> that<00:04:32.380> I

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:32.500 
that and honestly with my vision that I

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.529 
that and honestly with my vision that I
want<00:04:32.830> to<00:04:33.039> have<00:04:33.250> on<00:04:33.460> this<00:04:33.610> game<00:04:33.849> it's<00:04:34.150> gonna<00:04:34.330> be

00:04:34.529 --> 00:04:34.539 
want to have on this game it's gonna be

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:36.029 
want to have on this game it's gonna be
sick<00:04:34.870> it's<00:04:35.169> gonna<00:04:35.259> be<00:04:35.409> something<00:04:35.680> that<00:04:35.710> you've

00:04:36.029 --> 00:04:36.039 
sick it's gonna be something that you've

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:38.010 
sick it's gonna be something that you've
never<00:04:36.070> seen<00:04:36.520> before<00:04:36.669> with<00:04:37.090> a<00:04:37.120> lot<00:04:37.330> of<00:04:37.479> these

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
never seen before with a lot of these

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.969 
never seen before with a lot of these
videos<00:04:38.199> and<00:04:38.820> hopefully<00:04:39.820> I<00:04:40.659> mean<00:04:41.620> the<00:04:41.710> drifting

00:04:41.969 --> 00:04:41.979 
videos and hopefully I mean the drifting

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:43.740 
videos and hopefully I mean the drifting
community<00:04:42.430> follows<00:04:42.789> soon<00:04:43.000> and<00:04:43.240> maybe<00:04:43.389> we<00:04:43.599> can

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:43.750 
community follows soon and maybe we can

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:45.420 
community follows soon and maybe we can
get<00:04:43.840> some<00:04:44.080> big<00:04:44.470> videos<00:04:44.800> going<00:04:45.009> in<00:04:45.099> terms<00:04:45.220> of

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:45.430 
get some big videos going in terms of

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:46.830 
get some big videos going in terms of
drifting<00:04:45.789> because<00:04:45.909> I<00:04:46.090> haven't<00:04:46.300> really<00:04:46.509> seen

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:46.840 
drifting because I haven't really seen

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.680 
drifting because I haven't really seen
any<00:04:47.500> montages<00:04:48.340> on<00:04:48.520> drifting<00:04:49.000> yet<00:04:49.210> Forza

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:49.690 
any montages on drifting yet Forza

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:53.129 
any montages on drifting yet Forza
horizon<00:04:49.810> 2<00:04:50.169> so<00:04:51.240> the<00:04:52.240> cockpit<00:04:52.659> view<00:04:52.840> on<00:04:52.990> this

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:53.139 
horizon 2 so the cockpit view on this

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:55.469 
horizon 2 so the cockpit view on this
