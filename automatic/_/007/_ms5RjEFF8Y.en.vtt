 the area known as the campaign with a Mediterranean climate very conducive to 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:44.210
 agricultural production that here has a particular identification with 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:49.270
 a certain exquisiteness of traditional elaboration and with seal of quality of 

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:53.679

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:26.420
 but as we know it today and it was started around 1924 by the grandfather 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.590
 whistleblower orlando its current holder 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.100
 this is strategically located for me from the tourist point of view 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:38.350
 conjugates a wonderful natural landscape historical monuments next to a large

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.650
 the heritage of unesco 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:50.090
 my life called me a 40 and a tourism 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.100
 this is not just unesco heritage and there are several types of tourism 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.020
 is the archaeological tourism that is a little more select tourism 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.340
 is the spa tourism that this area spain had and archeology 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.140
 and as many former archers come we try to offer them the best 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.319
 As a complement we also had lunch on the farm and it is full of 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:14.400
 That spirit of making our products known by red officials 

00:02:15.889 --> 00:02:20.569
 the in dahbar lot and currently has 65 hectares was 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:24.749
 developing around the old house where the family lives and that 

00:02:24.749 --> 00:02:27.929
 was acquired by the grandfather at the beginning of the last century 

00:02:27.929 --> 00:02:32.299
 who paid for them two thousand pounds what today would represent a few 

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:33.329
 euros 

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:38.189
 This is one of the areas in which the best agricultural aptitude of Italy soil are 

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:39.819
 great productive quality 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:45.419
 where the value of the land can range between 100 in 150 thousand euros 

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:49.859
 it is not the same one single goal

 % and pfizer salvation 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:56.959
 we are in an area that hurts us a lot the area is lent because we have everything 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:00.359
 assisted by controlled irrigation pressure irrigation 

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:04.659
 here we do not need engines the water flows so it is suitable for breeding 

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:09.489
 bufalina and this area is very productive apart from other farms with breeding 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:13.109
 buffaloes that are many has the famous artichoke production 

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:17.840

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:28.499
 the commune comprises some 13 to 14 thousand hectares covered mostly by 

00:03:28.499 --> 00:03:32.400
 a good flow for irrigation and an otherwise optimal climate for what has 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.839
 received the name of Little California 

00:03:35.839 --> 00:03:39.019
 finally it must have worked internally 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:41.849
 holger diamonds authorities tell the truth 

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:46.439
 because although we also have winter for example today we have 18 degrees in 

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:50.999
 the coldest periods we reach 8 9 degrees or cold nights are 

00:03:50.999 --> 00:03:55.299
 can reach 5 6 degrees is an ideal temperature both for the 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:56.279
 order cultivation 

00:03:56.279 --> 00:03:59.180
 maybe as for the buffalo breeding according to mine 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.899
 women 

00:03:59.899 --> 00:04:02.899
 I do not regret it 

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:10.790
 the buffalo bells are probably the strangest domestic species and 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:15.499
 particular throughout the European geography but the race is not indigenous to 

00:04:15.499 --> 00:04:18.400
 Italian 'buffalo' is native to eastern India 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:22.800
 the most accurate versions indicate that this animal was introduced to Italy in 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.740
 the Longobard period to irrefutable evidence of its presence in the 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.880
 tattan peninsula just from the 12th century and so the first testimonies are given 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:35.450
 about buffalo mozzarella when it was called simply in monza ok 

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:39.630
 probaturas term that comes from motorcycles I will do that consists in manual cutting of 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:44.750
 pasta and lada la mozarella appears for the first time in 1570 in a text of one 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:48.699
 of the cooks of the papal court but its consumption would spread to 

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:53.930
 end of the 18th century today the product identifies the Italian gastronomy by 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:57.800
 what has been granted the denomination of origin stamp and has been created 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:01.729
 the guard consortium of the mud served as a campaign buffalo 

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:05.830
 the annual production of searching the network hopefully of the hacienda round the 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:07.820
 five hundred sixty thousand kilos 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:13.710
 80 percent of the milk is produced internally in your field and 20% is 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:15.610
 purchase from pig producers 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:19.840
 their market is focused on the italy but they are starting some business 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:20.830
 export 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:23.080
 one was campaigning 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:24.849
 went down to 0 

00:05:24.849 --> 00:05:27.339
 with a boost of the 

00:05:27.339 --> 00:05:30.819
 the world council of the arrogant engine 

00:05:30.819 --> 00:05:35.169
 the entire campaign there under the action with six communes of the city of rome and 

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:38.819
 the high power in the province of foggia were named by the 

00:05:38.819 --> 00:05:41.810
 Ministry are habit of protected origin 

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:45.900
 where the best buffaloes are bred useful to the action that are the best 

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:49.990
 zones for this reason this prompted the formation of a tower consortium 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:52.580
 of which producers and manufacturers are part 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:56.650
 spasic that we have a single consortium for the whole campaign area integrating 

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:59.589
 to the region that is the largest province of production 

00:05:59.589 --> 00:06:01.349
 mamanchura 

00:06:01.349 --> 00:06:04.349
 all provincial and point city 

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:09.560
 time to share a break on the return we will know the characteristics of 

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:12.839
 production of the bid that give for hygiene the emblematic mcsherry
