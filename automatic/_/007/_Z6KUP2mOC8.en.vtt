00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:05.979
 hello girl let's learn today to do 

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:08.170
 one this newspaper or magazine 

00:00:05.979 --> 00:00:10.089
 it is very easy to do this nor the art itself 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:13.419
 You follow the steps right there. 

00:00:10.089 --> 00:00:15.249
 work to start painting your 

00:00:13.419 --> 00:00:16.209
 nails you can paint white 

00:00:15.249 --> 00:00:19.300
 cream 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:20.830
 I used a nude first and then the 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:24.220
 white on top because I did not want it 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:27.029
 stay as white bond paper lead 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:29.830
 a little bit of alcohol in a pot 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.300
 magazine paper and scissors 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:34.570
 so when your nails are already 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:38.649
 and will report a few pieces of the 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:42.160
 newspaper magazine in size covering 

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:44.260
 Your mother before you cut is to give a 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:47.260
 look in the newspaper magazine look for 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:49.539
 texts that have smaller sources 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.940
 those in bold because you know 

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:54.789
 much more ink in this space than 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:57.160
 You will cut and there will be much more. 

00:00:54.789 --> 00:01:00.789
 letters to be transferred to 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:03.519
 your nails to start just looks deceived 

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:05.950
 little by little and already it goes with a bit of 

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:09.280
 paper that you cut like hell 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:11.230
 the letters on the nail so I did it on 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:15.610
 So all of a sudden I went from one side to the other. 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:19.000
 tightening to really impress 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:20.620
 these letters from my fingernail and even fiddle 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.950
 a little from side to side to 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:27.190
 and then I had a good result and 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:30.940
 I liked that you could see some of them. 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:32.470
 symbols and there it is 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.930
 continuing on all the nails you can 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.700
 play for a while you can get the 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.310
 ts put vertically or horizontally 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.980
 diagonally 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:45.880
 I do not know how to do half a half moon 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:48.610
 event and girls use creativity is the 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:51.100
 technique is easy to do it gives a lot 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.600
 cool at the end of the extra 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.480
 shine because when you squeeze 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:58.180
 quite the bread in the nail it finishes 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:00.340
 passing your enamel a little 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:03.010
 that it is very dry I think the 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:05.260
 helped to melt these layers 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:07.470
 and she a little but no problem 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:10.240

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.070
