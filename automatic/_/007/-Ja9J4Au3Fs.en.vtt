00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:09.230
 [music] 

00:00:10.539 --> 00:00:15.019
 hello, I understand what it is 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:19.670
 they 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:21.970
 tayra whether we shit the most today 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:21.970
 shit 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:27.410
 skiing skiing skiing skiing already all countries skiing 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.750
 peculiar skis on the one hand like 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:32.780
 how would briefly radius that is see 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:35.360
 geometry so the coverage is kapous to and wide 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.489
 for your sake should be short but on 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.900
 are they really tough so much like 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:41.270
 to the radius of one of them received 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:45.440
 try very hard to get, as it were 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:47.030
 they are really tough people but i don't 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.580
 I can say that it is like this 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:52.040
 favorite for hedov miserable dull rigidity 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:54.110
 how from iron she's so well enough 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:56.030
 really interesting and spring they have 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.500
 some return but not so sure 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.019
 like all sports skis 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.970
 but sheâ€™s like minutes well, not idiotic 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:07.340
 some know this not drinking legs not 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:09.320
 jingle but ride them are interesting 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.940
 if you can already squeeze something out of them 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.040
 There I have tried them on them 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.990
 project in lite mode there mode there we 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.940
 don't feel sorry for my legs in mode I don't want to 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.280
 pull over but fail like they would 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:21.320
 go into a large radius they disperse 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.180
 at the same time they are catchy because 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.549
 tough but they do not give the controller 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.409
 speed here if for you it's not 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:29.479
 problem you can already push how 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:31.820
 orphan us and so good in gimme there good 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:35.869
 for turning over a good bow somehow 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:37.950
 even interesting but honestly say so for 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:39.390
 I have a lot more interesting 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.740
 in which i can get it there 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.630
 less effort either she will 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.630
 some more dynamically explosive 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.750
 so there really is controversial 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.670
 feeling because newbie can't 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.320
 advise because harsh 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.049
 it wo n't be easy for them 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.490
 heavy skiers expert can not 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:59.369
 advise because there is more 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.710
 interesting decision and I know that they are 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:04.470
 and as if I did not want them through the stocks from 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:08.009
 these really crazy kidneys they hawk 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:09.780
 crazy here for the middle ski I don't know 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.720
 it is necessary how to look at the price that is here 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:15.150
 we have a middleman who is rolling around 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.190
 not too much but it can and 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.080
 this is ready for the coupe to work on the slope 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.750
 in general, as if not against 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.530
 I have how I go there I somehow see them in 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.140
 this role 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.750
 but I'm not a wing case here anyway 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.489
 I'm not ready to jump there is a garbage yes 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.080
 it is in my understanding it is not top but 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:33.180
 that's good there is some kind of here 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.620
 there is something in them that's me 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.950
 makes now on them for so long 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:40.140
 say they are not there the slag here 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.090
 Likely in this series here these here is how she 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.940
 in the super neck were something i don't know and 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:47.459
 not really carried away to super-ship well 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.530
 my opinion is one of me 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:51.720
 yellowish liked because they 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.060
 soft and now these like because 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:57.390
 that they are such springs but green 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:59.730
 some kind of error well, that's the principle 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.049
 all that is, you think now will 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.579
 questions on the forum ask all 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:04.609
 set it up like this for now 

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:07.230
 because the program has this story 

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:09.750
 so here 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:12.120
 they often ask i want here man 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:14.190
 no, here it is already the second day 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.230
 finally they got us to the test and 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:18.120
 Well, I now want to take it and I still can not 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.470
 do with this situation at all here to me 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.599
 what do i ask why 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:24.569
 then armada gitise 

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:27.000
 so here because here because 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:29.670
 that so all nights are lived ch I can not just 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.870
 take and leave to the eye and oh well 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.299
 let's go look for a man 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:35.810
 I hope I will find put so signed 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:35.810
 channel bye
