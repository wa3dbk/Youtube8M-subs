 [Music] 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:12.870
 no no 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.940
 yes yes 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.940
 [Music] 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:37.280
 in this video I want to show you is 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:39.199
 how to get out of mode 62 from outside by 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.410
 the doubts that have been wrong in 

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:43.720
 put the code 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:46.480
 more than twice 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:48.660
 abroad they are going to work and 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.760
 good 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.730
 if they find the code then they do not 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.800
 to be able to enter 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:03.280
 this stereo is a stereo 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:06.100
 w www z 40 74 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:09.369
 in the model of this exterior 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:11.230
 well that town on this side says 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:15.420
 make a note of 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:20.280
 and this is the front has bluetooth 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.280
 card reader 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:26.050
 the usb reader and good if not 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:30.400
 we understand 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:34.810
 I suppose good there is my case is with 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:39.110
 6 only but if we 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:42.070
 we enter an erroneous code 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.070
 and any code 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:50.149
 and we can accept him there and he warns us 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:52.750
 that with 61 we enjoy that we are the 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:56.740
 entry to the code then we enter 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.740
 again another wrong code 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:03.100
 let's enter with this 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:06.760
 if we enter the code twice wrong 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:09.910
 it is 62 and they will not be able to enter 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:12.310
 again the code and then I'm going to 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.230
 show here is how to remove that 62 for 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.930
 that allows them to go back to 6 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:20.370
 only and can enter the code the 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.370
 who have found it 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:28.069
 I have to clarify that I do not do 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:30.790
 absolute I am not responsible for the 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:34.700
 undue courses that you can give to 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:38.300
 this procedure and it remains under the 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:41.540
 entire responsibility of the person 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:45.910
 to perform this method 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:48.340
 if you do it for an undue purpose 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:51.340
 good what we have to do once 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:53.800
 that is in 62 enter the code of 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:56.460
 we feel in this case the source because 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:59.250
 I have it in the test mushroom 

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:02.310
 we remove the current 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:06.070
 we have to take the stage that I already 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:09.300
 I took out the screws takes three screws 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:12.240
 we take out the lid 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:14.340
 we remove the tray that is loose with 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:19.080
 Careful we break the flex 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:21.420
 and if you look closely you can see this well 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:22.950
 is the microprocessor has risen without 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:25.470
 current please this is the 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:28.380
 microprocessor and 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:31.190
 that is the memory of rum 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:33.380
 it is a rom memory 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:35.480
 on this side, good, they are all of them 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:37.400
 the legs of the same because they go towel 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.790
 let's see in different or not I do not have 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:42.010
 why alone 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:45.879
 this dot indicates that the leg is 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:48.250
 number 1 and they were in that order 

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:53.500
 1 2 3 4 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:55.750
 5 6 7 and 8 what they have to do to 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:58.540
 get it out of saif is to bridge with a 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:02.020
 screwdriver or something 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:05.830
 and legs number 5 and 6 

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:10.290
 keeps a bridge one of those two legs 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:10.290
 while they plugged it 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:15.560
 to the current while in your fan 'has 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:20.830
 given his voice either from a source of 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:20.830
 external power or battery 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:29.169
 So what we do is keep 

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:32.340
 dotted the two pins only 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:35.850
 pins with something 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:39.840
 in my case with a screwdriver we are going to 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:42.220
 plug in let's plug in the source 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:45.900
 they keep bridging 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:45.900
 and we are going to 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:52.410
 we are going to light it 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:54.810
 and turn on with the light with the 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:58.280
 screen like that without letters 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:05:01.009
 if we take the bridge we do 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:05.000
 we take out the bridge that we do 

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:06.590
 there is already eliminated 62 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.810
 the screen appears as well as a 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:13.760
 medium strong contrast 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:16.310
 what we do is unplug again 

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:18.230
 we plug in again 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:21.620
 and this time without making the bridge 

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:23.380
 we turn on and as we can see already 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:25.230
 He disappeared 

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:27.420
 62 

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:30.120
 and now it allows us to enter the 

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:31.710
 code that corresponds to that good 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:33.870
 When they find the code enters 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:35.020
 him the corresponding code and what can 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:38.169
 do 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:41.580
 as many times as you want, you can return it to 

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:43.560
 reset in that way 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:45.500
 and I reiterate I am not responsible for the 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:48.389
 improper uses of these procedures 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:52.250
 I hope you have served them and they have 

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:52.250
 liked the video see you in the next
