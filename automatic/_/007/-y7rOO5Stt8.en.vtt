00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.290 

the<00:00:00.930> first<00:00:01.140> step<00:00:01.319> in<00:00:01.500> building<00:00:01.650> any<00:00:02.010> any<00:00:03.000> track

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:03.300 
the first step in building any any track

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.120 
the first step in building any any track
work<00:00:03.510> with<00:00:03.689> our<00:00:03.810> fixtures<00:00:04.230> is<00:00:04.500> to<00:00:04.680> make<00:00:04.859> the

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
work with our fixtures is to make the

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.220 
work with our fixtures is to make the
guardrails<00:00:05.730> I'd<00:00:06.569> like<00:00:06.720> to<00:00:06.810> do<00:00:06.899> this<00:00:07.080> step

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
guardrails I'd like to do this step

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.740 
guardrails I'd like to do this step
first<00:00:07.589> and<00:00:07.980> get<00:00:08.550> that<00:00:08.580> out<00:00:08.910> of<00:00:09.000> the<00:00:09.059> way<00:00:09.210> and<00:00:09.570> I

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
first and get that out of the way and I

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.660 
first and get that out of the way and I
set<00:00:10.200> the<00:00:10.320> guardrails<00:00:10.679> aside<00:00:11.070> the<00:00:11.400> reason<00:00:11.519> I

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
set the guardrails aside the reason I

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.539 
set the guardrails aside the reason I
like<00:00:11.790> to<00:00:11.820> do<00:00:12.030> them<00:00:12.179> first<00:00:12.509> is<00:00:13.280> once<00:00:14.280> you<00:00:14.400> get

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
like to do them first is once you get

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.609 
like to do them first is once you get
all<00:00:15.059> the<00:00:15.299> track<00:00:15.540> in<00:00:15.750> place<00:00:15.990> it<00:00:16.320> can<00:00:16.440> be<00:00:16.590> a

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
all the track in place it can be a

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.620 
all the track in place it can be a
little<00:00:16.770> awkward<00:00:17.160> to<00:00:17.190> use<00:00:17.460> the<00:00:17.760> the<00:00:18.150> forming

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
little awkward to use the the forming

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.620 
little awkward to use the the forming
Gers<00:00:19.520> the<00:00:20.520> forming<00:00:20.820> grooves<00:00:21.000> are<00:00:21.150> these<00:00:21.300> three

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
Gers the forming grooves are these three

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.500 
Gers the forming grooves are these three
little<00:00:22.619> lines<00:00:22.890> and<00:00:23.369> they'll<00:00:23.820> be<00:00:23.970> on<00:00:24.000> every

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
little lines and they'll be on every

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.080 
little lines and they'll be on every
fixture<00:00:24.720> somewhere<00:00:25.470> this<00:00:26.369> example<00:00:26.699> this

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
fixture somewhere this example this

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.429 
fixture somewhere this example this
there's<00:00:27.390> one<00:00:27.570> in<00:00:27.660> the<00:00:27.750> center<00:00:28.019> and<00:00:28.140> two<00:00:28.289> on<00:00:28.410> the

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
there's one in the center and two on the

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.410 
there's one in the center and two on the
outside<00:00:28.859> sometimes<00:00:29.160> they're<00:00:29.550> there<00:00:30.000> in<00:00:30.150> here

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
outside sometimes they're there in here

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.970 
outside sometimes they're there in here
as<00:00:30.510> well<00:00:30.859> and<00:00:31.859> these<00:00:32.070> are<00:00:32.130> we<00:00:32.369> used<00:00:32.640> to<00:00:33.020> to<00:00:34.020> form

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
as well and these are we used to to form

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.889 
as well and these are we used to to form
the<00:00:35.610> guardrails<00:00:36.030> and<00:00:36.329> I'll<00:00:36.480> show<00:00:36.630> you<00:00:36.719> how<00:00:36.780> to

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
the guardrails and I'll show you how to

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.959 
the guardrails and I'll show you how to
do<00:00:36.989> that<00:00:37.219> if<00:00:38.219> you<00:00:38.280> want<00:00:38.430> to<00:00:38.489> just<00:00:38.579> take<00:00:38.670> a<00:00:38.730> piece

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
do that if you want to just take a piece

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.209 
do that if you want to just take a piece
of<00:00:39.120> rail<00:00:39.300> and<00:00:39.510> slide<00:00:39.809> it<00:00:39.989> into<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.350> end<00:00:41.070> of<00:00:41.160> the

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
of rail and slide it into the end of the

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.770 
of rail and slide it into the end of the
groove<00:00:41.460> and<00:00:41.670> this<00:00:41.790> is<00:00:41.940> going<00:00:42.120> to<00:00:42.210> gauge<00:00:42.390> the

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
groove and this is going to gauge the

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.910 
groove and this is going to gauge the
length<00:00:44.570> make<00:00:45.570> sure<00:00:45.719> you<00:00:45.840> got<00:00:45.989> a<00:00:46.020> nice<00:00:46.200> clean

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
length make sure you got a nice clean

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.139 
length make sure you got a nice clean
cut<00:00:47.190> on<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.460> end<00:00:47.550> of<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:47.700> rail<00:00:47.879> you<00:00:48.000> don't

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
cut on the end of the rail you don't

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.049 
cut on the end of the rail you don't
want<00:00:48.329> a<00:00:48.570> piece<00:00:49.260> that's<00:00:49.590> like<00:00:49.829> this<00:00:50.059> that's

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
want a piece that's like this that's

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.850 
want a piece that's like this that's
been<00:00:51.270> mashed<00:00:51.480> over<00:00:51.899> you<00:00:52.020> want<00:00:52.230> it<00:00:52.320> makes<00:00:52.500> me

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
been mashed over you want it makes me

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.439 
been mashed over you want it makes me
some<00:00:53.039> kings<00:00:53.219> it's<00:00:53.910> actually<00:00:54.149> gonna<00:00:54.239> be<00:00:54.329> a

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
some kings it's actually gonna be a

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.290 
some kings it's actually gonna be a
usable<00:00:54.960> end<00:00:55.309> just<00:00:56.309> taking<00:00:56.610> you<00:00:56.699> slide<00:00:57.000> it<00:00:57.149> into

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
usable end just taking you slide it into

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.910 
usable end just taking you slide it into
the<00:00:57.390> fixture<00:00:57.809> as<00:00:58.020> far<00:00:58.230> as<00:00:58.320> it'll<00:00:58.469> go<00:00:58.559> and

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
the fixture as far as it'll go and

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.889 
the fixture as far as it'll go and
that's<00:00:59.850> going<00:01:00.000> to<00:01:00.059> set<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.480> length<00:01:00.660> because

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
that's going to set the length because

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.810 
that's going to set the length because
the<00:01:01.109> length<00:01:01.289> of<00:01:01.410> that<00:01:01.530> groove<00:01:01.920> is<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.340> same<00:01:02.609> as

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
the length of that groove is the same as

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.479 
the length of that groove is the same as
the<00:01:02.969> length<00:01:03.180> of<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:03.989> groove<00:01:04.170> in<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.489> fixture

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
the length of the groove in the fixture

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.969 
the length of the groove in the fixture
which<00:01:05.610> you<00:01:05.790> just<00:01:05.970> take<00:01:06.119> your<00:01:06.270> real<00:01:06.450> nippers<00:01:06.979> up

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
which you just take your real nippers up

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.859 
which you just take your real nippers up
against<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.430> edge<00:01:08.490> of<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.670> fixture<00:01:09.060> cut<00:01:09.780> it

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
against the edge of the fixture cut it

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:15.140 
against the edge of the fixture cut it
off<00:01:11.960> set<00:01:12.960> that<00:01:13.110> piece<00:01:13.320> aside<00:01:13.850> so<00:01:14.850> now<00:01:14.909> we<00:01:15.000> got<00:01:15.119> a

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
off set that piece aside so now we got a

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.789 
off set that piece aside so now we got a
piece<00:01:15.990> of<00:01:16.110> rail<00:01:16.259> that's<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.619> right<00:01:16.770> length

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
piece of rail that's the right length

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.020 
piece of rail that's the right length
for<00:01:17.189> a<00:01:17.220> very<00:01:17.460> real<00:01:18.710> now<00:01:19.710> we<00:01:19.770> use<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.280> bending

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
for a very real now we use the bending

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.630 
for a very real now we use the bending
group<00:01:21.210> and<00:01:21.689> this<00:01:21.960> group<00:01:22.020> is<00:01:22.950> actually<00:01:23.250> on<00:01:23.610> a

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
group and this group is actually on a

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.060 
group and this group is actually on a
bit<00:01:23.850> of<00:01:23.939> an<00:01:24.030> angle<00:01:24.290> that<00:01:25.290> angle<00:01:25.530> is<00:01:25.830> going<00:01:26.009> to

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
bit of an angle that angle is going to

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.469 
bit of an angle that angle is going to
form<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.549> flare<00:01:26.850> at<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.180> end<00:01:27.330> of<00:01:27.420> the

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
form the flare at the end of the

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.090 
form the flare at the end of the
guardrail<00:01:27.930> and<00:01:28.140> you<00:01:28.320> flare<00:01:28.710> at<00:01:28.829> the<00:01:28.920> end<00:01:29.040> of

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
guardrail and you flare at the end of

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.190 
guardrail and you flare at the end of
the<00:01:29.159> guardrail<00:01:29.579> so<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:30.000> wheels<00:01:30.210> don't<00:01:30.930> catch

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
the guardrail so the wheels don't catch

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.929 
the guardrail so the wheels don't catch
it<00:01:33.020> so<00:01:34.020> to<00:01:34.110> use<00:01:34.290> the<00:01:34.439> the<00:01:35.070> bending<00:01:35.310> Girija<00:01:35.640> same

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
it so to use the the bending Girija same

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:36.980 
it so to use the the bending Girija same
way<00:01:36.060> you<00:01:36.150> just<00:01:36.329> slide<00:01:36.509> it<00:01:36.630> in<00:01:36.720> all<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:36.960> way

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
way you just slide it in all the way

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.020 
way you just slide it in all the way
hold<00:01:37.950> it<00:01:38.070> down<00:01:38.159> your<00:01:38.340> finger<00:01:38.460> you<00:01:38.759> just<00:01:38.790> want

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
hold it down your finger you just want

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.600 
hold it down your finger you just want
to<00:01:39.090> bend<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:39.420> rail<00:01:39.600> by<00:01:40.170> eye<00:01:40.340> until<00:01:41.340> it's

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
to bend the rail by eye until it's

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.149 
to bend the rail by eye until it's
perpendicular<00:01:42.240> or<00:01:42.899> square<00:01:43.290> with<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:43.920> edge<00:01:44.040> of

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
perpendicular or square with the edge of

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.969 
perpendicular or square with the edge of
the<00:01:44.250> fixture<00:01:44.640> so<00:01:45.140> it's<00:01:46.140> it's<00:01:46.350> a<00:01:46.470> very<00:01:46.680> slight

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
the fixture so it's it's a very slight

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.179 
the fixture so it's it's a very slight
Bend<00:01:47.280> just<00:01:48.149> enough<00:01:48.450> to<00:01:48.630> create<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:49.799> flare<00:01:50.070> and

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
Bend just enough to create the flare and

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.539 
Bend just enough to create the flare and
then<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.540> same<00:01:51.540> step<00:01:51.840> on<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:52.920> opposite<00:01:53.310> side

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
then the same step on the opposite side

00:01:53.549 --> 00:02:01.160 
then the same step on the opposite side
you<00:01:55.880> slide<00:01:56.880> it<00:01:57.030> in<00:01:57.320> and<00:01:58.320> square<00:01:59.990> never<00:02:00.990> looking

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
you slide it in and square never looking

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.679 
you slide it in and square never looking
you<00:02:01.290> see<00:02:01.469> that<00:02:01.649> the<00:02:02.100> band<00:02:02.340> is<00:02:02.520> on<00:02:02.729> the<00:02:02.909> both<00:02:03.450> on

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
you see that the band is on the both on

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.539 
you see that the band is on the both on
the<00:02:03.750> same<00:02:03.899> side<00:02:03.960> it's<00:02:04.439> almost<00:02:04.710> like<00:02:04.950> a<00:02:04.979> u-shape

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
the same side it's almost like a u-shape

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.210 
the same side it's almost like a u-shape
but<00:02:06.390> very<00:02:06.630> slight<00:02:06.930> as<00:02:07.170> you<00:02:07.290> can<00:02:07.409> see<00:02:07.530> and<00:02:08.099> then

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
but very slight as you can see and then

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.070 
but very slight as you can see and then
we<00:02:08.369> can<00:02:08.489> just<00:02:08.640> take<00:02:08.670> that<00:02:08.940> in<00:02:09.410> we'll<00:02:10.410> do<00:02:10.530> a<00:02:10.560> test

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
we can just take that in we'll do a test

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.680 
we can just take that in we'll do a test
here<00:02:11.230> and<00:02:11.350> see<00:02:11.880> how<00:02:12.880> it<00:02:12.910> fits<00:02:13.180> in<00:02:13.330> the<00:02:13.420> groove

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
here and see how it fits in the groove

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.540 
here and see how it fits in the groove
in<00:02:13.870> the<00:02:13.900> fixture<00:02:14.350> the<00:02:14.740> geometry<00:02:15.280> of<00:02:15.310> this

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
in the fixture the geometry of this

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.370 
in the fixture the geometry of this
groove<00:02:15.820> is<00:02:16.060> the<00:02:16.180> same<00:02:16.390> as<00:02:16.540> the<00:02:16.660> geometry<00:02:17.230> that

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
groove is the same as the geometry that

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.310 
groove is the same as the geometry that
we<00:02:17.440> use<00:02:17.680> in<00:02:17.920> the<00:02:18.120> four<00:02:19.120> meters<00:02:19.420> and<00:02:20.080> you<00:02:20.110> see

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:20.320 
we use in the four meters and you see

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:23.130 
we use in the four meters and you see
how<00:02:20.410> that<00:02:20.560> sets<00:02:20.830> in<00:02:21.010> there<00:02:21.870> it's<00:02:22.870> in<00:02:22.990> there

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
how that sets in there it's in there

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.130 
how that sets in there it's in there
perfect<00:02:23.530> that's<00:02:23.950> the
