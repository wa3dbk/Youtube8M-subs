it a little easier to get to and then
I'm<00:03:17.160> gonna<00:03:17.280> open<00:03:17.460> my<00:03:19.160> software<00:03:20.160> from<00:03:20.460> the<00:03:20.520> GPS

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
I'm gonna open my software from the GPS

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.410 
I'm gonna open my software from the GPS
manufacturer<00:03:22.250> and<00:03:23.250> that<00:03:23.610> will<00:03:23.700> be<00:03:24.270> a<00:03:24.300> little

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.770 
map 60 CSX here and the garmin software
for<00:03:34.410> the<00:03:34.500> computer<00:03:35.070> is<00:03:35.640> mapsource<00:03:36.420> so<00:03:36.690> i'm

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
for the computer is mapsource so i'm

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.440 
for the computer is mapsource so i'm
going<00:03:36.870> to<00:03:36.930> open<00:03:37.050> that<00:03:37.860> software<00:03:38.460> and<00:03:39.360> that

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
going to open that software and that

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.140 
going to open that software and that
will<00:03:39.630> allow<00:03:39.780> me<00:03:39.960> to<00:03:40.110> open<00:03:40.290> the<00:03:40.890> GPX<00:03:41.340> file<00:03:41.670> and

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
will allow me to open the GPX file and

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.930 
will allow me to open the GPX file and
view<00:03:42.450> it<00:03:42.600> in<00:03:42.750> that<00:03:43.230> software<00:03:43.710> so<00:03:44.040> to<00:03:44.700> do<00:03:44.910> that

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940
