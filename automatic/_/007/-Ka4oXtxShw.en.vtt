testing<00:00:03.389> in<00:00:03.780> my<00:00:03.929> Tesla<00:00:04.440> Model<00:00:04.589> S<00:00:07.670> conditions

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
testing in my Tesla Model S conditions

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.509 
testing in my Tesla Model S conditions
right<00:00:08.849> now<00:00:09.000> are<00:00:09.269> very<00:00:09.300> poor<00:00:09.870> roads<00:00:10.590> are<00:00:10.920> icy

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
right now are very poor roads are icy

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.339 
right now are very poor roads are icy
and<00:00:11.849> I'll<00:00:12.030> cover<00:00:12.269> it<00:00:12.450> with<00:00:12.599> snow<00:00:12.870> on<00:00:12.900> top<00:00:13.290> of

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
and I'll cover it with snow on top of

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.970 
and I'll cover it with snow on top of
that<00:00:13.670> right<00:00:14.670> now<00:00:14.820> I<00:00:14.849> am<00:00:15.059> in<00:00:15.179> a<00:00:15.269> parking<00:00:15.719> lot<00:00:15.980> and

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
that right now I am in a parking lot and

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.490 
that right now I am in a parking lot and
wanted<00:00:17.580> to<00:00:17.609> test<00:00:17.940> two<00:00:18.180> things<00:00:20.660> first<00:00:21.660> is<00:00:21.960> just

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
wanted to test two things first is just

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.269 
wanted to test two things first is just
acceleration<00:00:23.220> and<00:00:23.820> second<00:00:24.510> is<00:00:25.130> see<00:00:26.130> what<00:00:26.220> I

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
acceleration and second is see what I

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.700 
acceleration and second is see what I
can<00:00:26.460> do<00:00:26.519> with<00:00:26.640> donuts<00:00:27.060> with<00:00:28.019> and<00:00:28.380> without

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
can do with donuts with and without

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.970 
can do with donuts with and without
traction<00:00:29.900> so<00:00:30.900> right<00:00:31.050> now<00:00:31.199> traction<00:00:31.650> controls

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
traction so right now traction controls

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.970 
traction so right now traction controls

charge<00:00:38.480> controls<00:00:38.900> I'm<00:00:39.079> really<00:00:39.440> heavy<00:00:39.620> but<00:00:40.000> we

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:41.000 
charge controls I'm really heavy but we

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.520 
charge controls I'm really heavy but we
are<00:00:41.090> now<00:00:41.270> moving

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:42.530 
are now moving

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:48.829 
are now moving
problems<00:00:43.809> miles<00:00:44.809> per<00:00:45.050> hour

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:48.839 

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:51.419 

with<00:00:49.839> traction<00:00:50.140> control<00:00:50.320> on<00:00:50.710> and<00:00:50.980> kick<00:00:51.309> the

00:00:51.419 --> 00:00:51.429 
with traction control on and kick the

00:00:51.429 --> 00:00:56.310 
with traction control on and kick the
tires<00:00:52.230> floor<00:00:53.230> it<00:00:53.409> and<00:00:54.539> we<00:00:55.539> are<00:00:55.809> getting<00:00:56.079> a

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:56.320 
tires floor it and we are getting a

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.139 
tires floor it and we are getting a
little<00:00:56.649> bit<00:00:56.949> of<00:00:57.070> sliding<00:00:57.309> on<00:00:57.549> the<00:00:57.640> backside

00:00:58.139 --> 00:00:58.149 
little bit of sliding on the backside

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:02.049 
little bit of sliding on the backside
but<00:00:58.449> not<00:00:58.659> much

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:02.059 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:05.200 

it's<00:01:02.600> a<00:01:02.660> pretty<00:01:02.870> good<00:01:03.519> I'm<00:01:04.519> gonna<00:01:04.640> turn<00:01:04.970> off

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
it's a pretty good I'm gonna turn off

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.410 
it's a pretty good I'm gonna turn off
the<00:01:05.420> traction<00:01:05.690> control<00:01:05.900> now<00:01:06.790> it's<00:01:07.790> disabled

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
the traction control now it's disabled

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.390 
the traction control now it's disabled
same<00:01:10.110> thing

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:12.400 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.450 

yeah<00:01:12.940> we<00:01:13.270> are<00:01:13.390> spinning<00:01:14.230> full-on<00:01:15.040> doughnuts

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:15.460 
yeah we are spinning full-on doughnuts

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:16.320

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.400 
so I'm actually really impressed with
the<00:01:18.070> traction<00:01:18.370> control<00:01:19.110> and<00:01:20.110> go<00:01:20.200> ahead<00:01:20.290> and

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:20.410 
the traction control and go ahead and

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:23.890 
the traction control and go ahead and
turn<00:01:20.470> that<00:01:20.530> back<00:01:20.860> on

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:23.900 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.830 

I'm<00:01:24.080> gonna<00:01:24.230> head<00:01:24.410> out<00:01:24.440> to<00:01:24.680> the<00:01:24.770> road<00:01:24.980> here

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
a very large Hill that has been a

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.960 
a very large Hill that has been a
challenge<00:01:30.330> to<00:01:30.390> get<00:01:30.600> up<00:01:30.750> at<00:01:30.870> times<00:01:31.430> even<00:01:32.430> with

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
challenge to get up at times even with

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.630 
challenge to get up at times even with
all-wheel-drive<00:01:34.010> so<00:01:35.010> you<00:01:35.100> know<00:01:35.250> right<00:01:35.430> now<00:01:35.610> I

all-wheel-drive so you know right now I
am<00:01:35.820> running<00:01:36.060> blue<00:01:36.810> Zach

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.430 
am running blue Zach

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:02:10.260 

which<00:01:43.890> are<00:01:44.130> a<00:01:44.420> performance<00:01:45.649> snow

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:12.330 

there's<00:02:10.990> the<00:02:11.260> hill<00:02:11.470> to<00:02:11.860> raise<00:02:12.010> the<00:02:12.190> suspension

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
there's the hill to raise the suspension

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:21.470 
there's the hill to raise the suspension
to<00:02:12.850> very<00:02:13.300> high

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.600 

it<00:02:21.870> has<00:02:22.110> not<00:02:22.290> been<00:02:22.530> plowed<00:02:22.800> yet<00:02:23.190> it<00:02:23.340> doesn't

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
it has not been plowed yet it doesn't

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.229 
it has not been plowed yet it doesn't
look<00:02:23.700> like<00:02:23.940> that's<00:02:24.569> some<00:02:24.780> pretty<00:02:24.989> heavy<00:02:25.230> slush

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
look like that's some pretty heavy slush

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:33.119 
look like that's some pretty heavy slush
and<00:02:27.569> snow<00:02:27.840> on<00:02:28.079> it<00:02:28.549> and<00:02:29.549> thus<00:02:29.909> far<00:02:30.209> no<00:02:30.780> problems

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:33.129 

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:34.890 

got<00:02:33.459> traction<00:02:33.969> control<00:02:34.239> kicking<00:02:34.540> in<00:02:34.659> if<00:02:34.780> I

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
got traction control kicking in if I

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:41.120 
got traction control kicking in if I
push<00:02:35.109> the<00:02:35.260> pedal<00:02:35.530> to<00:02:35.560> the<00:02:35.680> floor

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
all right this is the steepest point I'm

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:49.280 
all right this is the steepest point I'm
going<00:02:44.010> to<00:02:44.130> come<00:02:44.280> to<00:02:44.400> a<00:02:44.430> complete<00:02:44.850> stop<00:02:48.080> and<00:02:49.080> I'm

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
going to come to a complete stop and I'm

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.350 
going to come to a complete stop and I'm
flooring<00:02:49.740> it<00:02:49.920> I<00:02:50.070> got<00:02:50.430> charts<00:02:50.760> Mitchell<00:02:51.120> fully

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
flooring it I got charts Mitchell fully

I'm not sure what happened here my video
cut<00:02:59.810> out<00:02:59.989> but<00:03:00.310> as<00:03:01.310> you<00:03:01.579> can<00:03:01.700> see<00:03:01.760> I<00:03:02.049> came<00:03:03.049> to

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
cut out but as you can see I came to

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.559 
cut out but as you can see I came to
full<00:03:03.409> stop<00:03:03.739> and<00:03:04.489> was<00:03:05.000> able<00:03:05.150> to<00:03:05.329> get<00:03:05.420> going

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:05.569 
full stop and was able to get going

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:08.440 
full stop and was able to get going
again<00:03:05.810> I<00:03:06.260> had<00:03:06.980> some<00:03:07.189> initial<00:03:07.549> spin<00:03:07.909> I<00:03:07.969> had<00:03:08.329> to

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
again I had some initial spin I had to

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.649 
again I had some initial spin I had to
actually<00:03:08.689> stop<00:03:09.019> and<00:03:09.530> not<00:03:10.069> mash<00:03:10.310> the<00:03:10.579> pedal<00:03:10.879> to

00:03:11.649 --> 00:03:11.659 
actually stop and not mash the pedal to

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:13.630 
actually stop and not mash the pedal to
get<00:03:11.750> going<00:03:12.140> but<00:03:12.409> I<00:03:12.709> was<00:03:13.069> able<00:03:13.159> to<00:03:13.310> climb<00:03:13.459> no

problem<00:03:14.000> there<00:03:14.150> are<00:03:14.180> actually<00:03:14.480> several<00:03:14.750> cars

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
problem there are actually several cars

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:17.890 
problem there are actually several cars
stopped<00:03:16.790> at<00:03:17.000> the<00:03:17.060> bottom<00:03:17.359> of<00:03:17.450> the<00:03:17.510> hill<00:03:17.659> and

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
stopped at the bottom of the hill and

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.399 
stopped at the bottom of the hill and
parking<00:03:18.290> lot<00:03:18.439> there<00:03:19.689> we're<00:03:20.689> unable<00:03:20.870> to<00:03:21.049> get<00:03:21.290> up

00:03:21.399 --> 00:03:21.409 
parking lot there we're unable to get up

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:23.379 
parking lot there we're unable to get up
this<00:03:21.560> hill<00:03:21.799> here<00:03:22.040> I<00:03:22.280> know<00:03:22.760> it's<00:03:22.969> hard<00:03:23.120> to<00:03:23.180> tell

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:23.389 
this hill here I know it's hard to tell

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:25.750 
this hill here I know it's hard to tell
in<00:03:23.540> the<00:03:23.629> video<00:03:23.750> but<00:03:23.959> it<00:03:24.950> is<00:03:25.069> a<00:03:25.099> pretty<00:03:25.430> steep

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
in the video but it is a pretty steep

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:33.710 
in the video but it is a pretty steep
grade<00:03:26.170> I<00:03:28.930> would<00:03:29.930> guess<00:03:30.230> probably<00:03:30.970> 12%<00:03:31.970> or<00:03:32.120> so

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
grade I would guess probably 12% or so

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.720 
grade I would guess probably 12% or so
a<00:03:33.810> little<00:03:34.620> more<00:03:34.740> traction<00:03:35.010> control<00:03:35.430> kicking

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
a little more traction control kicking

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:44.710 
a little more traction control kicking
on<00:03:35.880> as<00:03:36.180> we<00:03:36.330> get<00:03:36.450> to<00:03:36.540> this<00:03:36.660> point

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.780 

we<00:03:44.870> are<00:03:45.020> now<00:03:45.200> up<00:03:45.470> smells<00:03:45.920> getting<00:03:46.040> very<00:03:46.490> deep

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
we are now up smells getting very deep

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:56.619 
we are now up smells getting very deep
here

00:03:56.619 --> 00:03:56.629 

00:03:56.629 --> 00:03:58.989 

so<00:03:57.200> there<00:03:57.409> it<00:03:57.499> is<00:03:57.650> I'm<00:03:57.859> very<00:03:58.489> impressed<00:03:58.760> with

00:03:58.989 --> 00:03:58.999 
so there it is I'm very impressed with

00:03:58.999 --> 00:04:02.769 
so there it is I'm very impressed with
the<00:03:59.090> performance<00:03:59.810> going<00:04:00.319> up<00:04:00.469> that<00:04:00.590> hill
