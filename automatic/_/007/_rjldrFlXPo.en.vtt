variations<00:01:52.950> on<00:01:53.100> like<00:01:53.340> ways<00:01:53.640> to<00:01:53.880> do<00:01:54.000> chocolate

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
variations on like ways to do chocolate

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.709 
variations on like ways to do chocolate
and<00:01:54.570> mint<00:01:54.810> in<00:01:55.680> a<00:01:55.890> Kit<00:01:56.100> Kat<00:01:56.280> chunky<00:01:56.520> bar<00:01:56.850> weird

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
and mint in a Kit Kat chunky bar weird

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.810 
and mint in a Kit Kat chunky bar weird
though<00:01:58.079> because<00:01:58.380> like<00:01:58.710> does<00:01:59.219> it<00:01:59.340> still<00:01:59.579> all

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
though because like does it still all

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.450 
though because like does it still all
follow<00:02:00.270> the<00:02:00.509> Kit<00:02:00.719> Kat<00:02:00.899> formatting<00:02:01.560> I<00:02:01.740> don't

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
follow the Kit Kat formatting I don't

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.520 
follow the Kit Kat formatting I don't
know<00:02:02.579> let's<00:02:03.270> find<00:02:03.509> out

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
know let's find out

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.399 
know let's find out
interestingly<00:02:05.130> just<00:02:05.759> so<00:02:05.850> you<00:02:05.909> know<00:02:06.350> what<00:02:07.350> is

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
interestingly just so you know what is

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.119 
interestingly just so you know what is
this<00:02:07.530> Kit<00:02:07.799> Kat<00:02:07.950> or<00:02:08.099> Nestle<00:02:08.459> so<00:02:08.700> Nestle

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:10.129 
this Kit Kat or Nestle so Nestle

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:13.240

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
New Zealand or in Auckland that makes

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.330 
New Zealand or in Auckland that makes
sense<00:02:18.620> they<00:02:18.740> just<00:02:18.890> have<00:02:19.010> one<00:02:19.160> packaging<00:02:19.670> um<00:02:20.270> so

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
sense they just have one packaging um so

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.950 
sense they just have one packaging um so
are<00:02:22.340> these<00:02:22.430> available<00:02:22.640> in<00:02:22.970> Australia<00:02:23.510> these

which<00:02:54.380> is<00:02:54.500> a<00:02:54.530> good<00:02:54.739> sign<00:02:56.230> let's<00:02:57.230> let's<00:02:57.890> give

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
which is a good sign let's let's give

which is a good sign let's let's give
the<00:02:58.340> first<00:02:58.370> one<00:02:58.790> to<00:02:58.880> try<00:02:59.120> what<00:02:59.420> do<00:02:59.480> you<00:02:59.540> think

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
the first one to try what do you think

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:01.990 
the first one to try what do you think
it's<00:02:59.780> gonna<00:02:59.870> be<00:03:00.050> the<00:03:00.170> smooth<00:03:00.530> or<00:03:01.040> the<00:03:01.670> gooey

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000

I'm<00:03:02.810> gonna<00:03:02.959> say<00:03:03.080> the<00:03:03.170> smooth<00:03:03.670> let's<00:03:04.670> see<00:03:04.880> what

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
I'm gonna say the smooth let's see what

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.890 
I'm gonna say the smooth let's see what
it<00:03:05.120> is

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:15.520 

mm-hmm<00:03:08.930> ah<00:03:14.050> it's<00:03:15.050> almost<00:03:15.170> like<00:03:15.410> you're

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
mm-hmm ah it's almost like you're

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:16.960 
mm-hmm ah it's almost like you're
getting<00:03:15.709> three<00:03:16.160> chocolate<00:03:16.310> bars<00:03:16.640> and<00:03:16.820> one

getting three chocolate bars and one

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:23.080 
getting three chocolate bars and one
well<00:03:17.660> that's<00:03:17.840> really<00:03:18.110> good<00:03:21.370> so<00:03:22.370> it<00:03:22.910> still

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
well that's really good so it still

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.810 
well that's really good so it still
follows<00:03:23.420> standard<00:03:23.660> kik<00:03:24.019> app<00:03:24.820> formatting

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:25.820

wafers<00:03:26.630> on<00:03:26.750> the<00:03:26.840> bottom<00:03:27.790> nice<00:03:28.790> chunky<00:03:29.360> large

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
wafers on the bottom nice chunky large

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.940

slabs<00:03:31.760> of<00:03:32.209> chocolate<00:03:33.019> on<00:03:33.110> the<00:03:33.170> outside<00:03:33.200> I'm

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950 
slabs of chocolate on the outside I'm

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:36.070 
slabs of chocolate on the outside I'm
gonna<00:03:34.130> break<00:03:34.370> this<00:03:34.840> because<00:03:35.840> these<00:03:35.930> are

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:36.080 
gonna break this because these are

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:37.690 
gonna break this because these are
really<00:03:36.230> three<00:03:36.590> different<00:03:36.920> kinds<00:03:37.190> of<00:03:37.220> three

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700 
really three different kinds of three

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.180 
really three different kinds of three
different<00:03:37.850> bars<00:03:38.209> essentially<00:03:38.810> I<00:03:39.130> don't<00:03:40.130> know

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
different bars essentially I don't know

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.310 
different bars essentially I don't know
how<00:03:40.280> you<00:03:40.340> could<00:03:40.549> treat<00:03:40.730> this<00:03:40.880> as<00:03:41.090> I<00:03:41.390> mean<00:03:42.079> it<00:03:42.200> is

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:42.320 
how you could treat this as I mean it is

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:44.199 
how you could treat this as I mean it is
one<00:03:42.500> bar<00:03:42.769> but<00:03:43.040> it's<00:03:43.700> like<00:03:43.820> it's<00:03:44.000> almost<00:03:44.090> like

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:44.209 
one bar but it's like it's almost like

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:47.560 
one bar but it's like it's almost like
it's<00:03:44.780> like<00:03:44.930> a<00:03:45.140> survey<00:03:45.890> of<00:03:45.920> like<00:03:46.400> here's<00:03:47.150> three

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:47.570 
it's like a survey of like here's three

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:49.150 
it's like a survey of like here's three
different<00:03:48.019> ways<00:03:48.140> we<00:03:48.350> could<00:03:48.560> do<00:03:48.680> the<00:03:48.799> Kit<00:03:48.950> Kat

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.160 
different ways we could do the Kit Kat

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.400 
different ways we could do the Kit Kat
chunky<00:03:49.400> what<00:03:49.760> do<00:03:49.850> you<00:03:49.910> think<00:03:50.209> it'd<00:03:51.079> be<00:03:51.110> cool<00:03:51.350> if

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
chunky what do you think it'd be cool if

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:53.560 
chunky what do you think it'd be cool if
it<00:03:51.560> was<00:03:51.620> like<00:03:51.829> I<00:03:52.070> mean<00:03:52.700> this<00:03:52.790> is<00:03:52.940> a<00:03:53.120> neat<00:03:53.540> idea

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:53.570 
it was like I mean this is a neat idea

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:55.390 
it was like I mean this is a neat idea
but<00:03:54.079> it<00:03:54.350> would<00:03:54.470> also<00:03:54.590> be<00:03:54.709> kind<00:03:55.010> of<00:03:55.040> a<00:03:55.130> neat<00:03:55.280> way

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
but it would also be kind of a neat way

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.699 
but it would also be kind of a neat way
to<00:03:55.430> do<00:03:55.640> this<00:03:55.760> as<00:03:55.940> like<00:03:56.120> um<00:03:56.299> a<00:03:56.570> contest<00:03:57.470> maybe

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:57.709 
to do this as like um a contest maybe

00:03:57.709 --> 00:03:59.350 
to do this as like um a contest maybe
like<00:03:58.010> here<00:03:58.459> try<00:03:58.640> out<00:03:58.760> three<00:03:59.030> different

00:03:59.350 --> 00:03:59.360 
like here try out three different

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.710 
like here try out three different
varieties<00:03:59.630> of<00:03:59.989> mint<00:04:00.829> chocolate<00:04:01.540> KitKat<00:04:02.540> and

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720 
varieties of mint chocolate KitKat and

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.420 
varieties of mint chocolate KitKat and
tell<00:04:02.959> us<00:04:03.019> which<00:04:03.110> one<00:04:03.290> you<00:04:03.320> like<00:04:03.530> and<00:04:03.560> the

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
tell us which one you like and the
