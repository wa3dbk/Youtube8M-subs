00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.319 
relief to comment on a few small things
in<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.680> anime<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.250> music<00:01:41.640> is<00:01:41.759> alright<00:01:42.090> but

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
in the anime the music is alright but

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:43.039 
in the anime the music is alright but
nothing<00:01:42.630> great

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
nothing great

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.990 
nothing great
I<00:01:43.079> found<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.710> opening<00:01:44.040> song<00:01:44.189> kind<00:01:44.850> of

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
I found the opening song kind of

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.880 
I found the opening song kind of
annoying<00:01:45.270> and<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:45.869> first<00:01:46.110> ending<00:01:46.649> song

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
annoying and the first ending song

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.639 
annoying and the first ending song
pretty<00:01:47.549> much<00:01:47.700> forgettable<00:01:48.149> but<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:49.170> second

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
pretty much forgettable but the second

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.350 
pretty much forgettable but the second
ending<00:01:49.950> song<00:01:50.250> with<00:01:50.549> which<00:01:50.850> if<00:01:51.090> I<00:01:51.180> recall

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
ending song with which if I recall

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.499 
ending song with which if I recall
correctly<00:01:51.689> starts<00:01:52.470> off<00:01:52.619> during<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.909> second

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
correctly starts off during the second

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.929 
correctly starts off during the second
half<00:01:54.659> fared<00:01:55.530> better<00:01:55.770> and<00:01:56.189> it<00:01:56.579> was<00:01:56.640> a<00:01:56.700> tad<00:01:56.909> more

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
half fared better and it was a tad more

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.630 
half fared better and it was a tad more
dramatic<00:01:57.600> which<00:01:58.110> I<00:01:58.469> felt<00:01:58.829> was<00:01:59.070> pretty<00:01:59.340> fitting

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
dramatic which I felt was pretty fitting

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.850 
dramatic which I felt was pretty fitting
for<00:01:59.759> how<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.119> story<00:02:00.420> goes<00:02:00.719> the<00:02:01.500> art<00:02:01.649> in<00:02:01.770> the

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
for how the story goes the art in the

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.069 
for how the story goes the art in the
manga<00:02:02.219> is<00:02:02.280> pretty<00:02:03.180> good<00:02:03.360> if<00:02:03.630> you<00:02:03.659> like<00:02:03.780> clamp

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
manga is pretty good if you like clamp

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:07.340 
manga is pretty good if you like clamp
art<00:02:04.710> you<00:02:05.250> know<00:02:05.369> this<00:02:05.549> is<00:02:05.670> good<00:02:05.880> and<00:02:06.119> the<00:02:07.049> anime

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
art you know this is good and the anime

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.600 
art you know this is good and the anime
actually<00:02:07.530> does<00:02:07.770> a<00:02:07.799> pretty<00:02:07.860> good<00:02:08.190> job<00:02:08.369> of

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
actually does a pretty good job of

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.430 
actually does a pretty good job of
capturing<00:02:08.879> the<00:02:09.209> feel<00:02:09.629> and<00:02:09.899> style<00:02:10.110> of<00:02:10.319> the

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
capturing the feel and style of the

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.340 
capturing the feel and style of the
original<00:02:10.830> the<00:02:11.640> English<00:02:12.180> dubbing<00:02:12.569> in<00:02:12.750> choke

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
original the English dubbing in choke

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.350 
original the English dubbing in choke
was<00:02:13.560> as<00:02:13.920> far<00:02:14.160> as<00:02:14.190> I<00:02:14.340> could<00:02:14.400> tell<00:02:14.640> not<00:02:14.940> bad<00:02:15.210> at

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
was as far as I could tell not bad at

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.750 
was as far as I could tell not bad at
all<00:02:15.480> but<00:02:15.780> if<00:02:16.500> I<00:02:16.590> would<00:02:16.650> recommend<00:02:17.190> I'd<00:02:17.430> say<00:02:17.640> go

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
all but if I would recommend I'd say go

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.870 
all but if I would recommend I'd say go
with<00:02:17.820> the<00:02:17.910> Japanese

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
with the Japanese

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.050 
with the Japanese
all<00:02:20.880> in<00:02:21.300> all<00:02:21.420> I'm<00:02:22.100> really<00:02:23.100> not<00:02:23.400> quite<00:02:23.760> as<00:02:23.910> far

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
all in all I'm really not quite as far

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.060 
all in all I'm really not quite as far
as<00:02:24.300> of<00:02:24.690> this<00:02:24.840> series<00:02:25.170> that<00:02:25.200> it<00:02:25.410> used<00:02:25.590> to<00:02:25.710> be<00:02:25.860> I

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
as of this series that it used to be I

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:27.800 
as of this series that it used to be I
used<00:02:26.670> to<00:02:26.760> give<00:02:26.880> it<00:02:26.940> a<00:02:27.000> lot<00:02:27.120> of<00:02:27.210> praise<00:02:27.480> but

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
used to give it a lot of praise but

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.120 
used to give it a lot of praise but
right<00:02:27.990> now<00:02:28.170> I'd<00:02:28.350> say<00:02:28.500> it's<00:02:28.680> a<00:02:28.710> pretty<00:02:28.830> average

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
right now I'd say it's a pretty average

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.460 
right now I'd say it's a pretty average
show<00:02:29.550> but<00:02:30.270> I<00:02:30.300> still<00:02:30.480> do<00:02:30.630> enjoy<00:02:30.990> from<00:02:31.170> time<00:02:31.350> to

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
show but I still do enjoy from time to

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:32.000 
show but I still do enjoy from time to
time

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
time

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.760 
time
I'd<00:02:32.220> say<00:02:32.430> it's<00:02:32.550> good<00:02:32.700> for<00:02:32.850> its<00:02:32.970> genre<00:02:33.650> but<00:02:34.650> all

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
I'd say it's good for its genre but all

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.770 
I'd say it's good for its genre but all
in<00:02:34.920> all<00:02:35.040> I<00:02:35.460> can<00:02:36.270> give<00:02:36.450> this<00:02:36.540> highest

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
in all I can give this highest

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.510 
in all I can give this highest
recommendations<00:02:37.560> but<00:02:38.010> I'd<00:02:38.130> still<00:02:38.280> say<00:02:38.460> you

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
recommendations but I'd still say you

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:39.920 
recommendations but I'd still say you
should<00:02:38.700> probably<00:02:38.850> give<00:02:39.030> it<00:02:39.060> a<00:02:39.120> shot<00:02:39.420> but<00:02:39.780> you

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
should probably give it a shot but you

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.450 
should probably give it a shot but you
know<00:02:40.050> if<00:02:40.200> you're<00:02:40.290> not<00:02:40.410> digging<00:02:40.620> it<00:02:40.890> you<00:02:41.100> know<00:02:41.190> I
