me that you know there's other clothes

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.720 
me that you know there's other clothes
out<00:01:21.270> there<00:01:21.510> that<00:01:21.750> would<00:01:22.170> have<00:01:22.260> been<00:01:22.350> better

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:22.730 
out there that would have been better

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:26.150 
out there that would have been better
you<00:01:23.730> know<00:01:23.820> I<00:01:23.850> agree<00:01:24.030> with<00:01:24.270> you<00:01:24.360> guys<00:01:24.510> 100%<00:01:25.160> the

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:26.160 
you know I agree with you guys 100% the

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.600 
you know I agree with you guys 100% the
reason<00:01:26.640> why<00:01:26.730> I<00:01:26.760> went<00:01:27.030> with<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.240> cooler<00:01:27.630> master

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:28.610 
reason why I went with the cooler master

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:33.410 
reason why I went with the cooler master
v81<00:01:29.610> because<00:01:30.000> it<00:01:30.150> fits<00:01:30.840> in<00:01:31.020> with<00:01:31.050> my<00:01:31.230> theme<00:01:32.420> and

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
v81 because it fits in with my theme and

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.590 
v81 because it fits in with my theme and
I<00:01:33.690> liked<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:34.050> way<00:01:34.140> it<00:01:34.170> looked<00:01:35.150> the<00:01:36.150> biggest

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
I liked the way it looked the biggest

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.440 
I liked the way it looked the biggest
reason<00:01:36.930> is<00:01:37.080> that<00:01:37.760> this<00:01:38.760> is<00:01:38.970> probably<00:01:39.150> going<00:01:39.300> to

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
reason is that this is probably going to

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.670 
reason is that this is probably going to
be<00:01:39.540> a<00:01:39.570> temporary<00:01:39.990> cooler<00:01:40.490> my<00:01:41.490> plans<00:01:41.760> are<00:01:41.970> to

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:42.680 
be a temporary cooler my plans are to

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.710 
be a temporary cooler my plans are to
probably<00:01:43.680> go<00:01:43.770> water<00:01:44.040> cooling<00:01:44.520> but<00:01:45.300> I<00:01:45.330> wanted

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
probably go water cooling but I wanted

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.160 
probably go water cooling but I wanted
to<00:01:46.220> install<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:47.370> v8<00:01:47.700> see<00:01:48.600> how<00:01:48.720> it<00:01:48.840> looks<00:01:49.020> in

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
to install the v8 see how it looks in

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.540 
to install the v8 see how it looks in
the<00:01:49.260> case<00:01:49.440> see<00:01:49.740> what<00:01:49.860> kind<00:01:50.040> of<00:01:50.070> temps<00:01:50.400> I'm

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:50.550 
the case see what kind of temps I'm

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
the case see what kind of temps I'm
receiving<00:01:52.700> but<00:01:53.700> with<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:54.000> intentions<00:01:54.480> of

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
receiving but with the intentions of

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.090 
receiving but with the intentions of
possibly<00:01:54.900> glowing<00:01:55.140> large<00:01:55.320> water<00:01:55.680> pulling<00:01:55.950> in

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
possibly glowing large water pulling in

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.790 
possibly glowing large water pulling in
the<00:01:56.190> long<00:01:56.370> run<00:01:56.550> so<00:01:56.850> anyway<00:01:57.479> this<00:01:58.110> will<00:01:58.260> be<00:01:58.440> a<00:01:58.470> I

00:01:58.790 --> 00:01:58.800 
the long run so anyway this will be a I

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.370 
the long run so anyway this will be a I
guess<00:01:59.340> the<00:01:59.460> temporary<00:01:59.850> cooler<00:02:00.060> so<00:02:01.020> anyway

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
guess the temporary cooler so anyway

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:07.940 
guess the temporary cooler so anyway
that's<00:02:01.680> that<00:02:03.110> now<00:02:04.110> with<00:02:04.290> the<00:02:04.700> CPU<00:02:06.920> before<00:02:07.920> I

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
that's that now with the CPU before I

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.119 
that's that now with the CPU before I
install<00:02:08.789> this<00:02:09.000> into<00:02:09.239> the<00:02:09.450> motherboard<00:02:10.129> I'd

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
install this into the motherboard I'd

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.920 
install this into the motherboard I'd
like<00:02:11.340> to<00:02:11.519> check<00:02:12.000> this<00:02:12.209> to<00:02:12.390> see<00:02:12.420> if<00:02:12.659> in<00:02:12.780> each

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
like to check this to see if in each

of people they like to use a razor razor
works<00:02:31.800> really<00:02:32.040> well<00:02:32.250> it<00:02:33.150> gives<00:02:33.300> you<00:02:33.450> a<00:02:33.480> nice

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
works really well it gives you a nice

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.600 
works really well it gives you a nice
straight<00:02:33.990> edge<00:02:34.020> but<00:02:34.470> the<00:02:35.010> problem<00:02:35.310> I<00:02:35.400> have

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
straight edge but the problem I have

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.290 
straight edge but the problem I have
with<00:02:35.640> razor<00:02:36.030> is<00:02:36.709> when<00:02:37.709> I'm<00:02:37.800> holding<00:02:38.160> it<00:02:38.310> I'm

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
with razor is when I'm holding it I'm

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.960 
with razor is when I'm holding it I'm
not<00:02:39.450> sure<00:02:39.630> if<00:02:39.750> I'm<00:02:39.870> holding<00:02:40.080> it<00:02:40.440> as<00:02:40.650> flat<00:02:40.980> as<00:02:41.220> it

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
not sure if I'm holding it as flat as it

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.300 
not sure if I'm holding it as flat as it
needs<00:02:42.150> to<00:02:42.300> be<00:02:42.480> if<00:02:43.170> I'm<00:02:43.319> leading<00:02:43.650> that<00:02:43.830> way<00:02:44.069> or

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
needs to be if I'm leading that way or

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.250 
needs to be if I'm leading that way or
this<00:02:44.459> way<00:02:44.520> or<00:02:44.880> you<00:02:45.569> know<00:02:45.600> put<00:02:46.050> too<00:02:46.170> much

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
this way or you know put too much

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260 
this way or you know put too much
pressure<00:02:46.560> on<00:02:46.680> one<00:02:46.830> side<00:02:47.069> so<00:02:47.910> what<00:02:48.000> I<00:02:48.030> like<00:02:48.209> to

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
pressure on one side so what I like to

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:52.850 
pressure on one side so what I like to
use<00:02:48.770> is<00:02:49.770> a<00:02:49.830> straight<00:02:50.220> edge<00:02:50.630> this<00:02:51.630> is<00:02:51.690> from<00:02:52.020> a<00:02:52.170> de

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
use is a straight edge this is from a de

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.280 
use is a straight edge this is from a de
try<00:02:53.160> square<00:02:53.489> it's<00:02:54.480> got<00:02:54.600> a<00:02:54.630> nice<00:02:54.870> smooth

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
try square it's got a nice smooth

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:56.780 
try square it's got a nice smooth
straight<00:02:55.769> edge<00:02:55.920> on<00:02:56.070> the<00:02:56.160> bottom<00:02:56.190> of<00:02:56.459> it<00:02:56.610> and

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
straight edge on the bottom of it and

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.080 
straight edge on the bottom of it and
what<00:02:57.720> I<00:02:57.750> do<00:02:57.870> is<00:02:58.080> all<00:02:58.260> check<00:02:58.890> this<00:02:59.070> in<00:02:59.340> several

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
what I do is all check this in several

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.770 
what I do is all check this in several
different<00:03:00.330> spots<00:03:01.160> so<00:03:02.160> anyway<00:03:02.459> let's<00:03:03.390> go<00:03:03.540> ahead

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
different spots so anyway let's go ahead

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.350 
different spots so anyway let's go ahead
and<00:03:03.930> see<00:03:04.200> if<00:03:04.230> we<00:03:04.410> can<00:03:04.620> see<00:03:05.550> this<00:03:05.730> I<00:03:05.880> have<00:03:06.030> a

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
and see if we can see this I have a

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.080 
and see if we can see this I have a
light<00:03:06.810> on<00:03:07.050> so<00:03:07.380> so<00:03:08.220> my<00:03:08.370> camera<00:03:08.550> can<00:03:08.790> actually

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
light on so so my camera can actually

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.120 
light on so so my camera can actually
film<00:03:09.300> this<00:03:09.510> but<00:03:09.750> I<00:03:10.019> think<00:03:10.200> we<00:03:10.410> can<00:03:10.530> get<00:03:10.680> an<00:03:10.830> idea

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
film this but I think we can get an idea

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:12.020 
film this but I think we can get an idea
what<00:03:11.340> we're<00:03:11.489> doing<00:03:11.580> here

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
what we're doing here

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.479 
what we're doing here
what<00:03:12.810> I<00:03:12.840> do<00:03:12.930> is<00:03:13.110> I<00:03:13.170> take<00:03:13.319> a<00:03:13.380> pin<00:03:13.620> light<00:03:13.830> just

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
what I do is I take a pin light just

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:19.580 
what I do is I take a pin light just
light<00:03:14.670> right<00:03:14.850> here<00:03:17.930> it's<00:03:18.930> got<00:03:19.050> a<00:03:19.080> nice<00:03:19.290> sharp

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
light right here it's got a nice sharp

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.210 
light right here it's got a nice sharp
pin<00:03:19.830> light<00:03:20.100> to<00:03:20.400> it<00:03:20.550> and<00:03:21.000> I'll<00:03:21.660> set<00:03:21.930> the

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
pin light to it and I'll set the

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.069 
pin light to it and I'll set the
straight<00:03:23.220> edge<00:03:23.370> down<00:03:23.700> on<00:03:23.880> it<00:03:24.060> and<00:03:24.660> then<00:03:24.930> of

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:25.079 
straight edge down on it and then of

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:28.250 
straight edge down on it and then of
course<00:03:25.140> run<00:03:25.530> the<00:03:25.650> light<00:03:25.829> across<00:03:27.049> you<00:03:28.049> can<00:03:28.079> see

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
course run the light across you can see

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.740 
course run the light across you can see
here<00:03:28.799> on<00:03:28.890> the<00:03:28.980> right-hand<00:03:29.160> side<00:03:29.489> just<00:03:30.450> towards

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
here on the right-hand side just towards

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.060 
here on the right-hand side just towards
the<00:03:30.870> end<00:03:30.989> there<00:03:31.170> the<00:03:31.470> lights<00:03:31.680> starting<00:03:31.980> to

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.070 
the end there the lights starting to

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:35.860 
the end there the lights starting to
come<00:03:32.190> through<00:03:32.870> so<00:03:33.870> that's<00:03:34.049> telling<00:03:34.320> me<00:03:34.470> that

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
come through so that's telling me that

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:40.460 
come through so that's telling me that
the<00:03:36.870> CPU<00:03:37.230> is<00:03:37.440> in<00:03:37.620> 100%<00:03:38.100> flat<00:03:38.959> you<00:03:39.959> get<00:03:40.049> a<00:03:40.110> little

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
the CPU is in 100% flat you get a little

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.340 
the CPU is in 100% flat you get a little
bit<00:03:40.620> over<00:03:40.890> on<00:03:41.010> this<00:03:41.220> left<00:03:41.549> side<00:03:42.200> then<00:03:43.200> what<00:03:43.320> I

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
bit over on this left side then what I

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:46.660 
bit over on this left side then what I
do<00:03:43.470> is<00:03:43.590> I'll<00:03:43.829> move<00:03:44.040> it<00:03:44.160> up<00:03:44.250> here<00:03:44.579> to<00:03:45.120> the<00:03:45.150> center

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670 
do is I'll move it up here to the center

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:51.080 
do is I'll move it up here to the center
will<00:03:47.670> do<00:03:47.790> the<00:03:47.910> same<00:03:48.090> thing<00:03:49.700> so<00:03:50.700> it's<00:03:50.820> a<00:03:50.910> little

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
will do the same thing so it's a little

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:52.660 
will do the same thing so it's a little
bit<00:03:51.180> better<00:03:51.299> here<00:03:51.600> on<00:03:51.630> the<00:03:51.780> left<00:03:51.989> side<00:03:52.230> just

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 
bit better here on the left side just

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:57.140 
bit better here on the left side just
barely<00:03:53.670> coming<00:03:54.120> through<00:03:55.489> and<00:03:56.489> as<00:03:56.820> we<00:03:56.970> get<00:03:57.090> to

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
barely coming through and as we get to

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.349 
barely coming through and as we get to
the<00:03:57.450> right<00:03:57.750> side<00:03:58.079> here<00:03:58.320> you<00:03:58.440> can<00:03:58.470> see<00:03:59.329> about<00:04:00.329> a

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:00.359 
the right side here you can see about a

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:02.660 
the right side here you can see about a
quarter<00:04:00.810> inch<00:04:00.840> of<00:04:01.140> it

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
quarter inch of it

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:04.460 
quarter inch of it
the<00:04:03.090> light<00:04:03.269> is<00:04:03.390> coming<00:04:03.660> through<00:04:03.810> maybe<00:04:04.350> a

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
the light is coming through maybe a

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:09.130 
the light is coming through maybe a
little<00:04:04.620> bit<00:04:04.769> more<00:04:05.090> see<00:04:06.090> that<00:04:06.269> right<00:04:06.420> there<00:04:06.450> and

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:09.140 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:12.699 

of<00:04:10.140> course<00:04:10.410> we'll<00:04:10.590> move<00:04:10.709> it<00:04:10.859> up<00:04:10.980> front<00:04:11.220> here

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:12.709 
of course we'll move it up front here

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:17.779 
of course we'll move it up front here
and<00:04:13.709> see<00:04:13.950> what<00:04:14.100> we<00:04:14.220> have<00:04:14.250> here<00:04:16.459> so<00:04:17.459> the<00:04:17.549> left

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:17.789 
and see what we have here so the left

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:21.050 
and see what we have here so the left
side<00:04:18.000> again<00:04:18.120> looks<00:04:18.479> good<00:04:19.579> the<00:04:20.579> metal<00:04:20.850> looks

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
side again looks good the metal looks

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:26.210 
side again looks good the metal looks
really<00:04:21.419> good<00:04:21.600> we<00:04:22.470> get<00:04:22.590> to<00:04:22.710> this<00:04:22.800> right<00:04:23.039> side<00:04:25.220> we

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
really good we get to this right side we

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:29.210 
really good we get to this right side we
can<00:04:26.250> see<00:04:26.520> that<00:04:26.550> light<00:04:26.850> coming<00:04:27.120> through

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 
can see that light coming through

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:30.620 
can see that light coming through
so<00:04:29.610> that<00:04:29.760> tells<00:04:29.970> me<00:04:30.120> I'm<00:04:30.270> going<00:04:30.360> to<00:04:30.450> end<00:04:30.570> up

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:30.630 
so that tells me I'm going to end up

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:35.180 
so that tells me I'm going to end up
lapping<00:04:31.140> this<00:04:31.320> CPU<00:04:33.440> but<00:04:34.440> what<00:04:34.590> I'd<00:04:34.710> like<00:04:34.860> to<00:04:35.040> do

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.190 
lapping this CPU but what I'd like to do

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:38.810 
lapping this CPU but what I'd like to do
is<00:04:35.550> I<00:04:35.700> definitely<00:04:36.150> install<00:04:36.420> this<00:04:36.660> first<00:04:37.820> you

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:38.820 
is I definitely install this first you

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:41.240 
is I definitely install this first you
know<00:04:38.940> run<00:04:39.120> some<00:04:39.330> temp<00:04:39.570> tests<00:04:40.380> on<00:04:40.590> it<00:04:40.620> see<00:04:41.220> what

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.250 
know run some temp tests on it see what

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:43.960 
know run some temp tests on it see what
kind<00:04:41.520> of<00:04:41.580> temperatures<00:04:42.000> I'm<00:04:42.180> receiving<00:04:42.480> and

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:43.970 
kind of temperatures I'm receiving and

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:46.700 
kind of temperatures I'm receiving and
then<00:04:44.970> I'll<00:04:45.180> go<00:04:45.360> ahead<00:04:45.420> and<00:04:45.630> lap<00:04:45.750> it<00:04:45.990> as<00:04:46.470> you<00:04:46.620> can

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
then I'll go ahead and lap it as you can

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:49.940 
then I'll go ahead and lap it as you can
see<00:04:46.860> I<00:04:46.890> turned<00:04:47.010> this<00:04:47.490> diagonally<00:04:48.800> ran<00:04:49.800> the

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:49.950 
see I turned this diagonally ran the

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:51.620 
see I turned this diagonally ran the
straight<00:04:50.190> edge<00:04:50.310> across<00:04:50.490> one<00:04:51.090> corner<00:04:51.420> to<00:04:51.540> the

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:51.630 
straight edge across one corner to the

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:53.960 
straight edge across one corner to the
next<00:04:51.660> you<00:04:52.620> can<00:04:52.770> see<00:04:53.010> on<00:04:53.190> the<00:04:53.280> left<00:04:53.490> side<00:04:53.700> here

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:53.970 
next you can see on the left side here

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:57.050 
next you can see on the left side here
the<00:04:54.930> light<00:04:55.080> coming<00:04:55.380> through<00:04:55.410> and<00:04:55.980> it's<00:04:56.820> pretty

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060 
the light coming through and it's pretty

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:00.470 
the light coming through and it's pretty
good<00:04:58.010> and<00:04:59.010> over<00:04:59.610> here<00:04:59.760> the<00:04:59.880> right<00:05:00.030> side<00:05:00.330> looks

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:00.480 
good and over here the right side looks

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:07.220 
good and over here the right side looks
good<00:05:04.910> so<00:05:05.910> anyway<00:05:06.180> let's<00:05:06.360> turn<00:05:06.720> this<00:05:06.840> one<00:05:07.050> more

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:07.230 
good so anyway let's turn this one more

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:15.590 
good so anyway let's turn this one more
time<00:05:08.480> like<00:05:09.480> that<00:05:14.120> and<00:05:15.120> when<00:05:15.240> you<00:05:15.330> use<00:05:15.420> this

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:15.600 
time like that and when you use this

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:16.820 
time like that and when you use this
straight<00:05:15.900> edge<00:05:15.930> you've<00:05:16.260> got<00:05:16.410> to<00:05:16.500> make<00:05:16.650> sure

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:16.830 
straight edge you've got to make sure

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:18.620 
straight edge you've got to make sure
that<00:05:17.010> the<00:05:17.310> straight<00:05:17.520> edge<00:05:17.670> is<00:05:17.850> somewhat

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:18.630 
that the straight edge is somewhat

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:21.140 
that the straight edge is somewhat
centered<00:05:19.020> you<00:05:19.770> don't<00:05:19.920> want<00:05:20.040> to<00:05:20.130> you<00:05:20.850> know<00:05:20.880> kind

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:21.150 
centered you don't want to you know kind

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:23.690 
centered you don't want to you know kind
of<00:05:21.210> teeter-tottering<00:05:22.400> that<00:05:23.400> I'll<00:05:23.490> give<00:05:23.580> you

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:23.700 
of teeter-tottering that I'll give you

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:26.660 
of teeter-tottering that I'll give you
false<00:05:23.970> readings<00:05:24.450> also<00:05:25.130> so<00:05:26.130> on<00:05:26.190> this<00:05:26.310> left<00:05:26.580> side

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:26.670 
false readings also so on this left side

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:29.990 
false readings also so on this left side
we<00:05:27.030> look<00:05:27.180> pretty<00:05:27.390> good<00:05:28.430> and<00:05:29.430> then<00:05:29.580> we<00:05:29.670> get<00:05:29.820> over

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:30.000 
we look pretty good and then we get over

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.190 
we look pretty good and then we get over
here<00:05:30.030> now<00:05:30.210> you<00:05:30.450> can<00:05:30.540> see<00:05:30.780> the<00:05:30.930> right<00:05:31.080> side<00:05:33.200> so

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:34.200 
here now you can see the right side so

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.960 
here now you can see the right side so
that<00:05:34.230> confirms<00:05:34.770> what<00:05:35.100> we<00:05:35.250> just<00:05:35.490> checked<00:05:35.760> we

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:35.970 
that confirms what we just checked we

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:38.510 
that confirms what we just checked we
United<00:05:36.300> spun<00:05:36.480> at<00:05:36.600> 180<00:05:37.020> degrees<00:05:37.440> we<00:05:38.370> were

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:38.520 
United spun at 180 degrees we were

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:39.650 
United spun at 180 degrees we were
getting<00:05:38.730> the<00:05:38.790> light<00:05:38.940> on<00:05:39.090> the<00:05:39.210> right<00:05:39.390> on<00:05:39.570> the

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:39.660 
getting the light on the right on the

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:40.790 
getting the light on the right on the
left<00:05:39.840> side<00:05:40.050> now<00:05:40.260> we're<00:05:40.410> getting<00:05:40.620> it<00:05:40.680> on<00:05:40.770> the

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:40.800 
left side now we're getting it on the

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:45.290 
left side now we're getting it on the
right<00:05:40.890> side<00:05:43.340> so<00:05:44.340> definitely<00:05:44.730> we<00:05:44.850> again<00:05:45.060> we<00:05:45.180> are

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:45.300 
right side so definitely we again we are

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:47.810 
right side so definitely we again we are
going<00:05:45.390> to<00:05:45.510> end<00:05:45.630> up<00:05:45.660> lapping<00:05:46.080> this<00:05:46.550> so<00:05:47.550> anyway

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:47.820 
going to end up lapping this so anyway

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:51.200 
going to end up lapping this so anyway
uh<00:05:47.850> I<00:05:48.390> just<00:05:49.200> wanted<00:05:49.590> to<00:05:49.650> test<00:05:49.919> that<00:05:50.190> to<00:05:50.490> see<00:05:51.180> if

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:51.210 
uh I just wanted to test that to see if

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:53.030 
uh I just wanted to test that to see if
flapping<00:05:51.720> is<00:05:51.780> going<00:05:51.900> to<00:05:51.960> be<00:05:52.020> required<00:05:52.380> you

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:53.040 
flapping is going to be required you

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:56.300 
flapping is going to be required you
know<00:05:53.070> there<00:05:53.430> are<00:05:53.580> those<00:05:53.850> times<00:05:54.540> when<00:05:55.220> you<00:05:56.220> know

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:56.310 
know there are those times when you know

00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:00.530 
know there are those times when you know
the<00:05:56.430> CPU<00:05:56.990> would<00:05:57.990> be<00:05:58.110> perfectly<00:05:58.530> flat<00:05:59.390> this<00:06:00.390> one

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:00.540 
the CPU would be perfectly flat this one

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:02.360 
the CPU would be perfectly flat this one
isn't<00:06:00.810> really<00:06:00.840> that<00:06:01.020> bad<00:06:01.350> you<00:06:02.040> know<00:06:02.130> I've<00:06:02.250> had

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:02.370 
isn't really that bad you know I've had

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:04.940 
isn't really that bad you know I've had
a<00:06:02.430> couple<00:06:02.520> before<00:06:03.060> that<00:06:03.270> were<00:06:03.830> wearing<00:06:04.830> much

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:04.950 
a couple before that were wearing much

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:06.230 
a couple before that were wearing much
worse<00:06:05.220> shape<00:06:05.400> than<00:06:05.460> this<00:06:05.760> but<00:06:05.940> this<00:06:06.090> one

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:06.240 
worse shape than this but this one

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:08.540 
worse shape than this but this one
really<00:06:06.480> isn't<00:06:06.600> that<00:06:06.750> bad<00:06:07.160> again<00:06:08.160> I'm<00:06:08.280> going<00:06:08.460> to

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:08.550 
really isn't that bad again I'm going to

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:11.480 
really isn't that bad again I'm going to
install<00:06:08.910> it<00:06:09.200> we'll<00:06:10.200> run<00:06:10.380> some<00:06:10.490> temperature

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:11.490 
install it we'll run some temperature

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:13.130 
install it we'll run some temperature
tests<00:06:11.760> on<00:06:12.000> it<00:06:12.030> see<00:06:12.419> what<00:06:12.450> kind<00:06:12.690> of<00:06:12.750> temps<00:06:13.020> were

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:13.140 
tests on it see what kind of temps were

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:15.740 
tests on it see what kind of temps were
getting<00:06:13.380> on<00:06:13.440> our<00:06:13.560> CPU<00:06:14.300> then<00:06:15.300> we'll<00:06:15.419> tear<00:06:15.660> it

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:15.750 
getting on our CPU then we'll tear it

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:19.280 
getting on our CPU then we'll tear it
apart<00:06:15.980> we'll<00:06:16.980> lap<00:06:17.280> this<00:06:17.690> if<00:06:18.690> we<00:06:18.870> have<00:06:19.020> to<00:06:19.169> we'll

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:19.290 
apart we'll lap this if we have to we'll

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:22.610 
apart we'll lap this if we have to we'll
lap<00:06:19.530> the<00:06:19.919> the<00:06:20.340> cooler<00:06:20.550> and<00:06:20.910> then<00:06:21.810> we'll<00:06:22.140> you

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:22.620 
lap the the cooler and then we'll you

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:24.530 
lap the the cooler and then we'll you
know<00:06:22.710> run<00:06:23.460> some<00:06:23.610> more<00:06:23.640> temperature<00:06:24.120> tests<00:06:24.419> and

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:24.540 
know run some more temperature tests and

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:27.710 
know run some more temperature tests and
see<00:06:24.720> how<00:06:25.290> much<00:06:25.440> we<00:06:25.620> gained<00:06:25.910> the<00:06:26.910> reason<00:06:27.630> why<00:06:27.690> I

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:27.720 
see how much we gained the reason why I

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:31.370 
see how much we gained the reason why I
don't<00:06:27.870> like<00:06:28.080> lap<00:06:28.440> in<00:06:28.970> CPUs<00:06:29.970> is<00:06:30.210> one<00:06:30.450> not<00:06:31.350> only

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:31.380 
don't like lap in CPUs is one not only

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:35.270 
don't like lap in CPUs is one not only
does<00:06:31.680> it<00:06:31.940> void<00:06:32.940> your<00:06:33.180> warranty<00:06:33.980> but<00:06:34.980> as<00:06:35.160> you

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:35.280 
does it void your warranty but as you

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:38.090 
does it void your warranty but as you
guys<00:06:35.400> know<00:06:35.669> it's<00:06:36.150> a<00:06:36.210> lot<00:06:36.390> of<00:06:36.510> work<00:06:36.720> so<00:06:37.710> before<00:06:38.070> I

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:38.100 
guys know it's a lot of work so before I

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:41.990 
guys know it's a lot of work so before I
just<00:06:38.370> automatically<00:06:39.350> lap<00:06:40.350> a<00:06:40.590> CPU<00:06:41.190> I'm<00:06:41.789> going

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:42.000 
just automatically lap a CPU I'm going

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:42.990 
just automatically lap a CPU I'm going
to<00:06:42.060> one<00:06:42.210> check<00:06:42.510> to<00:06:42.660> make<00:06:42.780> sure

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:43.000 
to one check to make sure

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:49.450 
it up run my temps see what kind of

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:51.570 
it up run my temps see what kind of
temps<00:06:49.720> I'm<00:06:49.840> getting<00:06:50.170> you<00:06:50.710> know<00:06:50.830> I<00:06:51.100> may<00:06:51.370> get

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:51.580 
temps I'm getting you know I may get

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:53.370 
temps I'm getting you know I may get
temps<00:06:51.910> that<00:06:52.000> are<00:06:52.180> that<00:06:52.540> are<00:06:52.600> acceptable<00:06:53.110> and

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:53.380 
temps that are that are acceptable and

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:55.410 
temps that are that are acceptable and
that<00:06:54.220> being<00:06:54.430> the<00:06:54.520> case<00:06:54.550> and<00:06:54.940> I'm<00:06:55.000> not<00:06:55.180> going<00:06:55.360> to

00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:55.420 
that being the case and I'm not going to

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:58.110 
that being the case and I'm not going to
lap<00:06:55.570> it<00:06:55.710> if<00:06:56.710> the<00:06:56.890> temps<00:06:57.220> are<00:06:57.370> you<00:06:57.700> know<00:06:57.790> kind<00:06:58.000> of

00:06:58.110 --> 00:06:58.120 
lap it if the temps are you know kind of

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:02.100 
lap it if the temps are you know kind of
how<00:06:59.020> to<00:06:59.050> sink<00:06:59.410> then<00:07:00.510> then<00:07:01.510> we'll<00:07:01.720> go<00:07:01.870> ahead<00:07:01.960> and

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:02.110 
how to sink then then we'll go ahead and

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:05.820 
how to sink then then we'll go ahead and
we'll<00:07:02.320> lap<00:07:02.560> it<00:07:03.840> you<00:07:04.840> know<00:07:04.930> and<00:07:05.260> void<00:07:05.680> our

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:05.830 
we'll lap it you know and void our

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:07.830 
we'll lap it you know and void our
warranty<00:07:06.280> but<00:07:06.880> at<00:07:06.940> least<00:07:07.000> by<00:07:07.450> then<00:07:07.630> we've

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:07.840 
warranty but at least by then we've

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:10.310 
warranty but at least by then we've
actually<00:07:08.050> ran<00:07:08.410> it<00:07:08.620> we<00:07:08.920> know<00:07:09.070> the<00:07:09.250> CPU<00:07:09.610> is<00:07:09.670> good

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:10.320 
actually ran it we know the CPU is good

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:13.320 
actually ran it we know the CPU is good
and<00:07:11.320> we're<00:07:12.250> just<00:07:12.340> going<00:07:12.550> to<00:07:12.580> lap<00:07:12.760> it<00:07:12.790> to<00:07:13.090> try<00:07:13.270> to

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:13.330 
and we're just going to lap it to try to

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:17.460 
and we're just going to lap it to try to
improve<00:07:13.960> so<00:07:14.740> anyway<00:07:15.990> let's<00:07:16.990> get<00:07:17.110> back<00:07:17.169> to

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:17.470 
improve so anyway let's get back to

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:20.670 
improve so anyway let's get back to
installing<00:07:18.250> this<00:07:18.340> into<00:07:18.700> the<00:07:19.500> socket<00:07:20.500> and<00:07:20.590> then

00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:20.680 
installing this into the socket and then

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:23.430 
installing this into the socket and then
it's<00:07:20.890> on<00:07:21.010> the<00:07:21.160> cooler
