song and so basically I'm going to begin

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.530 
song and so basically I'm going to begin

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
by explaining that there are 12 keys in

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.840 
by explaining that there are 12 keys in
music<00:01:10.020> and<00:01:10.170> a<00:01:10.590> key<00:01:10.860> is<00:01:11.010> basically<00:01:11.430> a<00:01:11.460> selection

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
music and a key is basically a selection

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.960 
music and a key is basically a selection
of<00:01:12.119> notes<00:01:12.500> so<00:01:13.500> if<00:01:13.710> a<00:01:13.799> song<00:01:14.040> is<00:01:14.070> in<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.400> key<00:01:14.520> of<00:01:14.880> C

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
of notes so if a song is in the key of C

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.780 
of notes so if a song is in the key of C
for<00:01:15.689> example<00:01:16.140> that<00:01:16.590> means<00:01:16.830> that<00:01:16.979> it<00:01:17.159> will<00:01:17.310> use

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
for example that means that it will use

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.550 
for example that means that it will use
a<00:01:18.060> certain<00:01:18.360> selection<00:01:18.720> of<00:01:18.930> notes<00:01:19.140> and<00:01:19.350> it<00:01:19.470> will

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
a certain selection of notes and it will

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.640 
a certain selection of notes and it will
only<00:01:19.799> use<00:01:20.189> those<00:01:20.430> notes<00:01:20.700> now<00:01:21.330> that<00:01:22.080> rule<00:01:22.380> will

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
only use those notes now that rule will

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.310 
only use those notes now that rule will
be<00:01:22.830> broken<00:01:23.420> in<00:01:24.420> music<00:01:24.810> I'm<00:01:24.930> going<00:01:25.080> to<00:01:25.140> give<00:01:25.229> you

like<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:27.000> English<00:01:27.119> language<00:01:27.299> where<00:01:27.840> you<00:01:27.960> have

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
like the English language where you have

like the English language where you have
rules<00:01:28.380> like<00:01:28.710> I<00:01:29.009> before<00:01:29.549> E<00:01:29.820> except<00:01:30.720> after<00:01:30.840> C<00:01:31.229> we

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
rules like I before E except after C we

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.859 
rules like I before E except after C we
need<00:01:32.250> those<00:01:32.400> rules<00:01:32.700> to<00:01:32.850> help<00:01:32.880> us<00:01:33.119> learn<00:01:33.299> to

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
need those rules to help us learn to

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.050 
need those rules to help us learn to
spell<00:01:34.200> but<00:01:34.740> we<00:01:34.979> all<00:01:35.100> know<00:01:35.280> that<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.640> rules<00:01:35.880> are

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
spell but we all know that the rules are

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.539 
spell but we all know that the rules are
broken<00:01:36.210> pretty<00:01:37.200> quickly<00:01:37.470> so<00:01:37.770> that<00:01:38.100> rule<00:01:38.520> is

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
broken pretty quickly so that rule is

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.390 
broken pretty quickly so that rule is
actually<00:01:38.909> gonna<00:01:39.000> be<00:01:39.119> broken<00:01:39.740> but<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.799> basic

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
actually gonna be broken but the basic

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.210 
actually gonna be broken but the basic
rule<00:01:41.640> is<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:42.270> C<00:01:42.540> major<00:01:42.810> or<00:01:43.200> any<00:01:43.320> key<00:01:43.619> if<00:01:44.100> you're

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
rule is the C major or any key if you're

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.950 
rule is the C major or any key if you're
in<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.369> key<00:01:44.460> of<00:01:44.490> C<00:01:44.729> major<00:01:44.759> let's<00:01:45.149> say<00:01:45.329> you<00:01:45.810> will

in the key of C major let's say you will

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.980 
in the key of C major let's say you will
only<00:01:46.170> use<00:01:46.790> the<00:01:47.790> notes<00:01:48.030> that<00:01:48.360> are<00:01:48.390> found<00:01:48.630> in

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.480 
only use the notes that are found in
this<00:01:49.229> in<00:01:49.470> that<00:01:49.950> in<00:01:50.130> that<00:01:50.189> key<00:01:51.290> now<00:01:52.290> C<00:01:53.250> major

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
this in that in that key now C major

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.179 
this in that in that key now C major
basically<00:01:54.420> it<00:01:54.899> is<00:01:55.049> a<00:01:55.079> key<00:01:55.380> which<00:01:55.530> only<00:01:55.740> uses

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
basically it is a key which only uses

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.940 
basically it is a key which only uses
white<00:01:56.520> notes<00:01:56.790> so<00:01:57.689> again<00:01:58.259> this<00:01:58.439> rule<00:01:58.710> will<00:01:58.799> be

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
white notes so again this rule will be

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.590 
white notes so again this rule will be
broken<00:01:59.310> but<00:01:59.399> the<00:01:59.460> basic<00:01:59.820> starting<00:02:00.060> point<00:02:00.149> is<00:02:00.390> C

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
broken but the basic starting point is C

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.660 
broken but the basic starting point is C
major<00:02:00.780> only<00:02:01.140> uses<00:02:01.439> white<00:02:01.710> notes<00:02:01.979> which<00:02:02.430> makes

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
major only uses white notes which makes

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.240 
major only uses white notes which makes
it<00:02:02.759> really<00:02:03.000> easy<00:02:03.119> for<00:02:03.390> us<00:02:03.719> to<00:02:03.750> begin<00:02:04.350> learning

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
it really easy for us to begin learning

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.119 
it really easy for us to begin learning
in<00:02:05.549> and<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:06.180> first<00:02:06.420> few<00:02:06.659> songs<00:02:06.899> iit-jee<00:02:07.710> I

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
in and the first few songs iit-jee I

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:11.479 
in and the first few songs iit-jee I
will<00:02:08.550> only<00:02:08.729> teach<00:02:09.090> you<00:02:09.330> in<00:02:09.479> C<00:02:09.840> major<00:02:10.280> my<00:02:11.280> hope

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
will only teach you in C major my hope

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:11.820 
will only teach you in C major my hope
is

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
is

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.070 
is
is<00:02:11.890> that<00:02:12.220> it<00:02:12.460> will<00:02:12.610> be<00:02:12.790> like<00:02:13.180> learning<00:02:13.690> a

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
is that it will be like learning a

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.280 
is that it will be like learning a
language<00:02:15.210> at<00:02:16.210> the<00:02:16.330> moment<00:02:16.630> you<00:02:16.720> know<00:02:16.870> English

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
language at the moment you know English

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:18.600 
language at the moment you know English
probably<00:02:17.740> you<00:02:17.860> may<00:02:18.010> not<00:02:18.130> know<00:02:18.310> any<00:02:18.460> other

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
probably you may not know any other

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.790 
probably you may not know any other
languages<00:02:18.910> and<00:02:19.420> if<00:02:19.660> I<00:02:19.810> was<00:02:19.960> to<00:02:20.140> teach<00:02:20.320> you<00:02:20.560> all

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
languages and if I was to teach you all

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.190 
languages and if I was to teach you all
12<00:02:21.280> keys<00:02:21.610> in<00:02:22.180> my<00:02:22.510> mind<00:02:22.750> it<00:02:22.900> would<00:02:22.960> be<00:02:23.080> like

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
12 keys in my mind it would be like

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.760 
12 keys in my mind it would be like
trying<00:02:23.410> to<00:02:23.530> teach<00:02:23.740> you<00:02:24.040> 12<00:02:24.880> languages<00:02:25.240> at<00:02:25.450> once

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
trying to teach you 12 languages at once

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.700 
trying to teach you 12 languages at once
and<00:02:26.770> from<00:02:27.490> my<00:02:27.640> perspective<00:02:27.700> it's<00:02:28.630> better<00:02:28.930> to

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:29.710 
and from my perspective it's better to

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:32.790 
and from my perspective it's better to
learn<00:02:29.890> one<00:02:30.280> language<00:02:30.310> and<00:02:31.320> but<00:02:32.320> this<00:02:32.470> is<00:02:32.590> like

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
learn one language and but this is like

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.040 
learn one language and but this is like
having<00:02:33.520> never<00:02:33.820> learned<00:02:34.090> any<00:02:34.330> languages<00:02:34.840> at

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
having never learned any languages at

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:36.990 
having never learned any languages at
all<00:02:35.170> basically<00:02:35.740> so<00:02:36.010> C<00:02:36.250> major<00:02:36.430> is<00:02:36.580> your<00:02:36.700> first

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
all basically so C major is your first

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.820 
all basically so C major is your first
language<00:02:37.270> and<00:02:37.750> once<00:02:38.380> you<00:02:38.500> get<00:02:38.680> really

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
language and once you get really

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:40.770 
language and once you get really
familiar<00:02:39.070> with<00:02:39.340> that<00:02:39.490> we<00:02:40.090> can<00:02:40.240> start<00:02:40.390> adding<00:02:40.600> a

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
familiar with that we can start adding a

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.050 
familiar with that we can start adding a
couple<00:02:41.050> of<00:02:41.110> new<00:02:41.230> keys<00:02:41.670> but<00:02:42.670> you'll<00:02:42.820> probably

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
couple of new keys but you'll probably

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.690 
couple of new keys but you'll probably
still<00:02:43.360> think<00:02:43.840> as<00:02:44.740> though<00:02:44.980> you're<00:02:45.010> in<00:02:45.280> C<00:02:45.520> major

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
still think as though you're in C major

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.040 
still think as though you're in C major
to<00:02:46.000> start<00:02:46.240> off<00:02:46.360> with<00:02:46.510> so<00:02:46.660> it's<00:02:46.780> going<00:02:46.870> to<00:02:46.930> be

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 
to start off with so it's going to be

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:48.990 
to start off with so it's going to be
like<00:02:47.200> if<00:02:47.440> you<00:02:47.590> go<00:02:47.740> to<00:02:47.800> France<00:02:48.190> and<00:02:48.580> you<00:02:48.760> can't

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
like if you go to France and you can't

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.900 
like if you go to France and you can't
speak<00:02:49.240> French<00:02:49.950> when<00:02:50.950> you<00:02:51.070> say<00:02:51.280> your<00:02:51.400> sentences

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
speak French when you say your sentences

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:53.970 
speak French when you say your sentences
initially<00:02:52.450> you'll<00:02:52.900> probably<00:02:53.170> think<00:02:53.740> the

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
initially you'll probably think the

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.070 
initially you'll probably think the
centers<00:02:54.370> in<00:02:54.490> English<00:02:54.880> and<00:02:55.120> be<00:02:55.660> trying<00:02:55.959> to

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
centers in English and be trying to

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.680 
centers in English and be trying to
translate<00:02:56.500> it<00:02:56.830> as<00:02:56.980> you're<00:02:57.160> speaking<00:02:57.690> but

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
translate it as you're speaking but

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:00.600 
translate it as you're speaking but
after<00:02:59.530> you've<00:02:59.650> been<00:02:59.800> in<00:02:59.950> France<00:03:00.160> for<00:03:00.370> a<00:03:00.490> few

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
after you've been in France for a few

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.370 
after you've been in France for a few
years<00:03:00.640> we<00:03:00.970> lived<00:03:01.120> there<00:03:01.420> and<00:03:01.630> you<00:03:01.959> spoke<00:03:02.200> it

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.380 
years we lived there and you spoke it

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:03.930 
years we lived there and you spoke it
for<00:03:02.470> a<00:03:02.530> few<00:03:02.650> years<00:03:02.709> you<00:03:03.220> probably<00:03:03.370> would<00:03:03.700> start

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
for a few years you probably would start

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:05.550 
for a few years you probably would start
thinking<00:03:04.000> in<00:03:04.450> French<00:03:04.870> and<00:03:05.110> not<00:03:05.230> be<00:03:05.350> thinking

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
thinking in French and not be thinking

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.380 
thinking in French and not be thinking
in<00:03:05.860> English<00:03:05.920> anymore<00:03:06.400> what<00:03:06.850> is<00:03:06.940> the<00:03:07.030> same<00:03:07.240> with

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
in English anymore what is the same with

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:09.120 
in English anymore what is the same with
these<00:03:07.540> keys<00:03:07.870> initially<00:03:08.770> I'm<00:03:08.860> going<00:03:08.980> to<00:03:09.040> teach

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.130 
these keys initially I'm going to teach

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.190 
these keys initially I'm going to teach
you<00:03:09.280> see<00:03:09.520> major<00:03:09.780> and<00:03:10.780> I'm<00:03:10.900> going<00:03:11.020> to<00:03:11.080> get<00:03:11.170> you

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
you see major and I'm going to get you

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.530 
you see major and I'm going to get you
really<00:03:11.560> familiar<00:03:11.890> with<00:03:11.920> C<00:03:12.160> major<00:03:12.310> as<00:03:12.610> we<00:03:13.300> start

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
really familiar with C major as we start

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.990 
really familiar with C major as we start
learning<00:03:13.780> new<00:03:13.959> keys<00:03:14.290> you<00:03:14.890> will<00:03:15.040> start<00:03:15.430> you'll

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
learning new keys you will start you'll

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.759 
learning new keys you will start you'll
probably<00:03:16.209> still<00:03:16.510> be<00:03:16.570> thinking<00:03:16.930> the<00:03:17.440> theory

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:17.769 
probably still be thinking the theory

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:20.430 
probably still be thinking the theory
that<00:03:17.830> I<00:03:17.950> teach<00:03:18.160> you<00:03:18.340> in<00:03:18.519> C<00:03:18.850> major<00:03:19.440> eventually

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
that I teach you in C major eventually

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.140 
that I teach you in C major eventually
you'll<00:03:20.950> actually<00:03:21.250> be<00:03:21.459> able<00:03:21.519> to<00:03:21.640> think<00:03:21.850> in<00:03:22.030> a

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
you'll actually be able to think in a

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:23.940 
you'll actually be able to think in a
new<00:03:22.300> key<00:03:22.540> but<00:03:22.780> initially<00:03:22.989> we're<00:03:23.650> going<00:03:23.769> to<00:03:23.860> use

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
new key but initially we're going to use

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.340 
new key but initially we're going to use
C<00:03:24.220> major<00:03:24.370> as<00:03:24.550> a<00:03:24.580> template<00:03:25.090> as<00:03:25.300> we<00:03:25.720> do<00:03:25.870> new<00:03:26.050> keys

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:26.350 
C major as a template as we do new keys

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:27.810 
C major as a template as we do new keys
we're<00:03:26.800> going<00:03:26.950> to<00:03:27.040> you're<00:03:27.190> going<00:03:27.220> to<00:03:27.400> refer

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:27.820 
we're going to you're going to refer
