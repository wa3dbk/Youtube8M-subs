00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:08.099
 That's where they'll make a recipe. 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:10.530
 cool and super easy that I bet 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.269
 Are you watching, never seeing your parents? 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.299

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.050
 line of kick and tobago cookie work of 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.310
 rain 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:48.000
 the bank bic cone is serious and this is more the 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:52.320
 king had only two eggs a shallow spoon 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:01:04.470
 soup baking powder two tablespoons 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:01:12.630
 of margarine 34 cup of sugar and 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:18.780
 that same three are 350 ml of milk two 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:21.439
 cups of wheat flour and 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:26.509
 you will also need oil to 

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:31.799
 fry a little vanilla is here 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:33.540
 to take away the taste of the cocoa egg is 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.659
 I can take these measures 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.729
 we have this glass here you meter 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.820
 you can see the sea because people 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:44.670
 It's getting you focused but it's a 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.860
 cup with several standard measures that 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.960
 It was common with these things and it's very 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.939
 more tactical is not true 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:56.299
 so the first step in our revenue 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:56.299
 is to mix the new margarine 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:03.630
 Pierre the margarine I left a little on the 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:07.350
 microwave 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.729
 now is to put the two games that was 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:17.100
 never on my finger 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:21.330
 bn I sugar on top heal me and stayed 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:23.840
 in ninth place and now suffer will 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.840
 mix 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:38.710
 after you mix well it stays like this 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:43.020
 you will add the flour to the 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:43.020
 along with milk also gradually 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:58.800
 the mouth protocol does not have half of the 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:03:04.320
 flour and stir in yielding with care 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:06.150

 a little flour now we go by 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:11.330
 a little of the milk stops moving one 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.330
 little eff 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:20.390
 plus an inspired robot rival will 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:24.920
 stay cleaner and a bit more 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:29.010
