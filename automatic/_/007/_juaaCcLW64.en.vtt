inch silver stunning diffuser pendant
today<00:01:21.439> and<00:01:22.369> so<00:01:22.639> the<00:01:23.209> way<00:01:23.359> this<00:01:23.509> works<00:01:23.869> is<00:01:24.170> each

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
today and so the way this works is each

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.080 
today and so the way this works is each
little<00:01:24.859> pendant<00:01:25.249> and<00:01:25.369> we<00:01:25.459> do<00:01:25.579> have<00:01:25.729> several

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
little pendant and we do have several

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.749 
little pendant and we do have several
different<00:01:26.240> designs<00:01:26.810> but<00:01:27.590> each<00:01:27.829> pendant<00:01:28.429> has

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:28.759 
different designs but each pendant has

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:31.300 
different designs but each pendant has
some<00:01:29.479> form<00:01:29.810> of<00:01:29.990> ventilation<00:01:30.310> essentially

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
some form of ventilation essentially

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:32.639 
some form of ventilation essentially
there's<00:01:31.490> a<00:01:31.549> place<00:01:31.789> where<00:01:31.969> air<00:01:32.179> can<00:01:32.209> flow

00:01:32.639 --> 00:01:32.649 
there's a place where air can flow

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:35.309 
there's a place where air can flow
through<00:01:33.649> the<00:01:33.799> pendant<00:01:34.189> through<00:01:34.340> the<00:01:34.399> front

00:01:35.309 --> 00:01:35.319 
through the pendant through the front

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:38.559 
through the pendant through the front
because<00:01:36.319> as<00:01:36.740> you<00:01:37.009> know<00:01:37.219> essential<00:01:38.119> oils<00:01:38.389> are

00:01:38.559 --> 00:01:38.569 
because as you know essential oils are

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:40.480 
because as you know essential oils are
aromatic<00:01:39.380> oils<00:01:39.740> there<00:01:39.979> are<00:01:40.009> oils<00:01:40.340> that<00:01:40.429> you

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
aromatic oils there are oils that you

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.109 
aromatic oils there are oils that you
can<00:01:40.670> smell<00:01:41.090> not<00:01:41.810> only<00:01:42.170> from<00:01:42.920> a<00:01:43.189> distance<00:01:43.939> but

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:44.119 
can smell not only from a distance but

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:47.169 
can smell not only from a distance but
really<00:01:44.539> across<00:01:44.840> a<00:01:44.869> room<00:01:45.170> and<00:01:45.380> so<00:01:46.159> the<00:01:46.849> way

00:01:47.169 --> 00:01:47.179 
really across a room and so the way

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:49.359 
really across a room and so the way
these<00:01:47.329> work<00:01:47.630> is<00:01:47.899> they<00:01:48.259> hold<00:01:48.560> your<00:01:48.920> essential

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369

oils<00:01:49.579> inside<00:01:49.999> them<00:01:50.240> and<00:01:50.619> you<00:01:51.619> smell<00:01:51.859> them<00:01:52.039> all

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:52.189 
oils inside them and you smell them all

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:54.569 
oils inside them and you smell them all
day<00:01:52.340> they're<00:01:52.700> carried<00:01:53.060> around<00:01:53.149> on<00:01:53.539> your<00:01:53.719> body
