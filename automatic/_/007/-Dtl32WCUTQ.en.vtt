00:00:01.399 --> 00:00:10.429
 so this is a small big test in the task 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:15.260
 whose purpose is 

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:22.670
 find out whether they will rotate 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:29.210
 the rotor and now if you apply current to the shafts 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:33.510
 here still explain it turns out themselves pulleys 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:36.469
 son between themselves a rubber band such as such 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:42.379
 rubber rope that is seen that when 

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:42.379
 1 pulley rotation 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:49.230
 lip rotate 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:53.460
 here and the periphery of the two twin cocks are connected 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:56.750
 Sliding contacts sequentially but 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:01:02.219
 among themselves, just here that there are three 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:03.920
 the supply of current to the shafts is supposed to 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:07.250
 rotation occurs 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:11.369
 what actually I want to check 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:16.560
 here but how would you call as a question about 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:20.970
 and then what will it repel here 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:24.180
 very many argued that such here 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.189
 Lisovskaya machine can only work 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.470
 like a generator on a nickname engine that is 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.040
 Of course the victims of experiments are not the most 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.189
 clean 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:37.079
 in the sense that contacts on the periphery 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:39.689
 still stand on the pulleys you 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:44.399
 Still, this is not a conductive belt but 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:47.070
 no less i'm sure deep enough in 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.979
 that even with a belt 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.689
 will move with the pulleys 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:55.490
 rotation will also occur but 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:58.490
 Now we will try to demonstrate that 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.490
 happens
