00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:13.030
 the d major chord consists of the tones 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:14.620
 the fis and so on and the d major chord 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:17.230
 is it now so loud grabbing chart 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:18.760
 we play on the deep two sides 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:19.900
 We do not beat them with a different style 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:22.240
 we do not play anything we need 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.039
 not the lesson the page is the first 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:27.340
 Sound we need and grab we do 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:29.760
 the index finger now engages in the second 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:32.889
 bunch on the b side that would be the a 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.139
 Now comes the third finger as 

00:00:32.889 --> 00:00:38.260
 next in the third bunch on the hair 

00:00:35.139 --> 00:00:40.510
 work and the middle finger the second 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:43.899
 the finger should then on the high e 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:46.269
 string in the second bunch grab the fis 

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:48.280
 that would be a dure you see hopefully 

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:50.199
 also in the handle diagram so that 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.950
 Let's beat the teach now 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:56.790
 page on 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:59.160
 that is a d wonderful everything is clear 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:00.720
 that could then use in pieces like that 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.580
 Here 's another small one 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:04.830
 alternatively there are very common in too 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:07.830
 in pieces a version that sees 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.570
 because you're the same as me 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.860
 hereby show ring and middle finger 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.170
 played 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.770
 so does the index finger on the 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.540
 top three pages in the 2018 presses 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.190
 so all down at the same time now 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.790
 comes the second finger of the middle finger 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:25.950
 in the third bunch on the hair side the 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.479
 attacks ton de and now is still a 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.140
 is still a sound to it and that of the 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:35.600
 Ringfinger in the fourth bunch on the 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:37.250
 b-side this is also a d major chord 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.900
 and often you even find the 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.130
 Variation that the little finger as well 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:44.240
 If there is one more gate then it would be in the 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:47.170
 fifth bunch on the a side 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:49.299
 this is also a d major chords 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:51.520
 marianne that is only one again 

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:53.759
 Variation is important for you first 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.759
 here
