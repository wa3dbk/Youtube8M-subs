hi<00:00:01.469> I'm<00:00:01.620> sure<00:00:01.800> Risa<00:00:02.129> and<00:00:02.280> this<00:00:02.399> is<00:00:02.580> how<00:00:02.760> I<00:00:02.790> knit

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:03.090 
hi I'm sure Risa and this is how I knit

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.099 
hi I'm sure Risa and this is how I knit
and<00:00:03.210> purl<00:00:03.240> I<00:00:04.910> use<00:00:05.910> a<00:00:05.940> traditional<00:00:06.210> continental

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
and purl I use a traditional continental

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.100 
and purl I use a traditional continental
method<00:00:07.610> where<00:00:08.610> I<00:00:08.639> carry<00:00:09.030> the<00:00:09.300> yarn<00:00:09.630> in<00:00:09.780> my<00:00:09.900> left

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
method where I carry the yarn in my left

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.190 
method where I carry the yarn in my left
hand<00:00:10.349> but<00:00:11.099> you'll<00:00:11.219> see<00:00:11.370> that<00:00:11.519> I<00:00:11.550> use<00:00:11.880> the<00:00:12.300> my

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
hand but you'll see that I use the my

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.350 
hand but you'll see that I use the my
fingers<00:00:13.590> to<00:00:13.830> sort<00:00:14.040> of<00:00:14.070> stabilize<00:00:14.340> stitches<00:00:15.089> on

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
fingers to sort of stabilize stitches on

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.609 
fingers to sort of stabilize stitches on
the<00:00:15.719> on<00:00:16.260> the<00:00:17.220> needle<00:00:17.550> and<00:00:17.900> be<00:00:18.900> able<00:00:19.109> to<00:00:19.199> control

them<00:00:20.340> as<00:00:20.869> they<00:00:21.869> come<00:00:22.050> off<00:00:22.109> the<00:00:22.289> left<00:00:22.859> needle

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
them as they come off the left needle

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.370 
them as they come off the left needle
onto<00:00:23.310> the<00:00:23.519> right<00:00:23.699> needle<00:00:23.939> I<00:00:24.240> go<00:00:25.050> into<00:00:25.199> the

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
onto the right needle I go into the

needle<00:00:55.789> with<00:00:56.789> this<00:00:57.059> method<00:00:57.719> I<00:00:57.840> am<00:00:58.109> knitting<00:00:58.350> as

00:00:59.260 --> 00:00:59.270 
needle with this method I am knitting as

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.549 
needle with this method I am knitting as
traditionally<00:01:00.270> into<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.780> front<00:01:01.079> of<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.379> loop

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
traditionally into the front of the loop

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.899 
traditionally into the front of the loop
and<00:01:04.010> catching<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.100> loop<00:01:05.280> and<00:01:05.460> then<00:01:05.580> pulling

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
and catching the loop and then pulling

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.420 
and catching the loop and then pulling
the<00:01:06.000> left<00:01:06.180> loop<00:01:06.390> off<00:01:06.600> and<00:01:06.930> moving<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.280> new

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
the left loop off and moving the new

the left loop off and moving the new
loop<00:01:08.670> onto<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.240> right<00:01:09.420> needle

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.789 

I<00:01:17.500> do<00:01:18.500> go<00:01:18.859> into<00:01:19.130> the<00:01:19.729> front<00:01:20.030> of<00:01:20.149> a<00:01:20.299> loop<00:01:20.479> as

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:20.799 
I do go into the front of a loop as

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:28.179 
I do go into the front of a loop as
opposed<00:01:21.799> to<00:01:22.130> the<00:01:22.369> back<00:01:22.520> of<00:01:22.729> the<00:01:22.820> loop<00:01:27.189> and

opposed to the back of the loop and

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:33.029 
opposed to the back of the loop and
there's<00:01:28.399> the<00:01:28.609> back<00:01:28.819> of<00:01:29.060> a<00:01:29.179> loop<00:01:29.829> to<00:01:30.829> the<00:01:30.890> front

00:01:33.029 --> 00:01:33.039 
there's the back of a loop to the front

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:35.319 
there's the back of a loop to the front
and<00:01:34.039> you'll<00:01:34.700> notice<00:01:34.969> that<00:01:35.149> the<00:01:35.299> only

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:35.329 
and you'll notice that the only

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:37.809 
and you'll notice that the only
tensioning<00:01:36.200> method<00:01:36.740> I<00:01:36.860> have<00:01:36.890> this<00:01:37.280> between<00:01:37.579> my

00:01:37.809 --> 00:01:37.819 
tensioning method I have this between my

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:39.699 
tensioning method I have this between my
forefinger<00:01:38.360> and<00:01:38.600> my<00:01:38.719> middle<00:01:39.020> finger<00:01:39.319> I<00:01:39.350> don't

00:01:39.699 --> 00:01:39.709 
forefinger and my middle finger I don't

00:01:39.709 --> 00:01:44.649 
forefinger and my middle finger I don't
loop<00:01:40.069> on<00:01:40.310> my<00:01:40.490> hand<00:01:41.420> at<00:01:41.569> all<00:01:41.799> and<00:01:43.450> here's<00:01:44.450> my

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:44.659 
loop on my hand at all and here's my

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:47.349 
loop on my hand at all and here's my
purl<00:01:44.990> method<00:01:45.409> so<00:01:45.979> I<00:01:46.039> use<00:01:46.219> my<00:01:46.459> thumb<00:01:46.759> to<00:01:46.789> push

00:01:47.349 --> 00:01:47.359 
purl method so I use my thumb to push

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:51.990 
purl method so I use my thumb to push
the<00:01:47.810> wrap<00:01:48.020> stitch<00:01:48.610> off<00:01:50.200> to<00:01:51.200> the<00:01:51.289> right<00:01:51.439> needle

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 
the wrap stitch off to the right needle

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.249 
the wrap stitch off to the right needle
so<00:01:53.000> coming<00:01:53.299> to<00:01:53.329> the<00:01:53.479> front<00:01:53.720> of<00:01:53.899> the<00:01:53.989> stitch

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:54.259 
so coming to the front of the stitch

00:01:54.259 --> 00:02:01.899 
so coming to the front of the stitch
wrap<00:01:54.649> and<00:01:55.780> then<00:01:56.780> pull<00:01:57.229> it<00:01:57.380> through<00:02:00.849> you<00:02:01.849> know

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:01.909 
wrap and then pull it through you know

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:03.699 
wrap and then pull it through you know
you'll<00:02:02.329> notice<00:02:02.629> I<00:02:02.810> Illustrated<00:02:03.500> there<00:02:03.679> a

00:02:03.699 --> 00:02:03.709 
you'll notice I Illustrated there a

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:06.190 
you'll notice I Illustrated there a
little<00:02:03.950> bit<00:02:04.129> that<00:02:04.399> I<00:02:04.579> do<00:02:04.729> a<00:02:05.000> pull<00:02:05.539> on<00:02:05.869> the<00:02:06.170> yarn

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
little bit that I do a pull on the yarn

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:11.619 
little bit that I do a pull on the yarn
on<00:02:06.739> the<00:02:07.069> thread<00:02:07.310> itself<00:02:09.579> to<00:02:10.579> tighten<00:02:11.239> up<00:02:11.360> the

00:02:11.619 --> 00:02:11.629 
on the thread itself to tighten up the

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:14.020 
on the thread itself to tighten up the
stitch<00:02:11.930> so<00:02:12.349> it<00:02:12.379> has<00:02:12.739> the<00:02:12.950> same<00:02:13.160> tension<00:02:13.790> as<00:02:13.970> a

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
stitch so it has the same tension as a

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.670 
stitch so it has the same tension as a
knit<00:02:14.540> stitch<00:02:14.840> and<00:02:16.060> although<00:02:17.079> it<00:02:18.079> looks<00:02:18.440> like

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
knit stitch and although it looks like

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.830 
knit stitch and although it looks like
I'm<00:02:18.950> putting<00:02:19.489> a<00:02:19.640> little<00:02:19.760> more<00:02:19.970> energy<00:02:20.420> into

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
I'm putting a little more energy into

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.970 
I'm putting a little more energy into
the<00:02:20.870> purl<00:02:21.200> stitch<00:02:22.900> it's<00:02:23.900> that<00:02:24.260> extra<00:02:24.470> pull

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
the purl stitch it's that extra pull

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:26.530 
the purl stitch it's that extra pull
there<00:02:25.190> that<00:02:25.370> enables<00:02:25.819> me<00:02:25.910> to<00:02:26.030> have<00:02:26.299> real

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
there that enables me to have real

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:35.500 
there that enables me to have real
consistent<00:02:29.079> fabric<00:02:33.670> but<00:02:34.670> everybody<00:02:35.150> does<00:02:35.359> it

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
consistent fabric but everybody does it

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:36.940 
consistent fabric but everybody does it
differently<00:02:35.540> and<00:02:36.049> that's<00:02:36.230> why<00:02:36.410> I<00:02:36.440> love<00:02:36.709> this

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
differently and that's why I love this

how I knit project challenge on Ravelry

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.970 
how I knit project challenge on Ravelry
in<00:02:40.819> the<00:02:41.000> technique<00:02:41.389> forum<00:02:41.810> because<00:02:42.230> we<00:02:42.650> all<00:02:42.799> do

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
in the technique forum because we all do

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.140 
in the technique forum because we all do
it<00:02:43.099> differently<00:02:43.130> and<00:02:43.760> it<00:02:44.690> all<00:02:44.900> works<00:02:45.200> if<00:02:46.150> we

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
it differently and it all works if we

00:02:47.150 --> 00:03:04.170 
it differently and it all works if we
make<00:02:47.329> fabric<00:02:47.810> then<00:02:48.290> it's<00:02:48.470> right

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:09.179 

and<00:03:04.349> again<00:03:05.349> no<00:03:05.739> tensioning<00:03:07.920> except<00:03:08.920> by

00:03:09.179 --> 00:03:09.189 
and again no tensioning except by

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:11.130 
and again no tensioning except by
holding<00:03:09.700> the<00:03:09.819> arm<00:03:09.969> between<00:03:10.390> before<00:03:10.629> finger

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
holding the arm between before finger

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:12.720 
holding the arm between before finger
and<00:03:11.260> the<00:03:11.319> middle<00:03:11.439> finger<00:03:11.620> which<00:03:12.280> is<00:03:12.310> where<00:03:12.640> the

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
and the middle finger which is where the

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.990 
and the middle finger which is where the
tension<00:03:13.120> comes<00:03:13.329> and<00:03:14.489> I<00:03:15.489> don't<00:03:15.730> have<00:03:15.909> it

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
tension comes and I don't have it

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.550 
tension comes and I don't have it
wrapped<00:03:16.120> around<00:03:16.269> any<00:03:16.569> other<00:03:16.780> digits<00:03:17.260> on<00:03:17.409> my

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
wrapped around any other digits on my
