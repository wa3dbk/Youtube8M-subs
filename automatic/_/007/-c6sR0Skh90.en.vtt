00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.250
 brother who wants to affect the 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.600
 minors we have piles entered several 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.119
 innovations 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:13.170
 many times we have faced and 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:13.170
 how many times does it end 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.580
 my friend the level of cattle three times 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.500
 the same ones that I always have arrived today 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.090
 brother for no reason coffee you have won me 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.260
 I am so imposed that it is for 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.260

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.890
 is right my friend is that I am more 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:33.619
 of those of the neighbors already it is counted but 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.840
 you count different deaths that's why it's 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:44.149
 innocent there is my legacy history 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:45.710
 loses are people with friends who do not 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:48.430
 come 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.430
 love 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.850
 there is a difference between serious favorite and 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:57.280
 think about it because the audience is there but there 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.750
 that to earn it the difference friends is that 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.979
 to be evicted can be the 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.979
 favorite but if you liked 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:13.900
 will not sound and terms I think it is already 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:16.209
 so similar with how to copy with 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.220
 her structure rhyme that she my friend 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:22.720
 I can not understand it if you finish the 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:24.580
 rapper and you picas with your three I do not 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:28.150
 copied to your fax but hey this bastard 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:33.760
 it's fine I give you the reason but if I 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:36.400
 I leave because if it's not like the children 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.950
 thinking still ends more than 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.350
 frustrated friends after I come I 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.650
 I say therefore speaking English to do so 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.650
 Indian 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:49.400
 Today, brother, I think I do not explain, but 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.990
 they did not help in the treasury council not 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.030
 come hair and stole to try their 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:55.500
 reflexes because it will be only bryant to touch 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:58.510
 so possible and means 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:01.590
 If I look in the mirror, it's because I'm so 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:18.580
 hard would be like floor 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:20.950
 that's why I think about this even 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:22.600
 minutes against the jaguar warrior me 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.580
 I think that you lack a lot 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.800
 practice times out there to cry like a 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:30.060
 manila warrior that I give you state seems 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.060
 that here is true 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.830
 I am a gentleman 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:41.079
 an ex is right and friend but for me 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:43.659
 this is pure transacted do the words 

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:46.150
 obviously well they are like this is friends but 

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:49.500
 how to say as avilÃ©s or you will end up with 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.500
 the rhymes said pyramids 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:59.409
 the asthmatic stories you 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:02.200
 Atlantic crazy with me saw it marks 

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:04.629
 and by 2m for the recovery of the mÃ­ster 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.640
 obviously you're not the fantastic 

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:08.560
 happens to me of the three to get closer in a 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:11.170
 classic by the clear mind that only I 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:13.870
 you get angry because they do not get up loud 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:15.819

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.940
 ghost sure to work and to 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:20.799
 success you want because you are in america 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:23.789
 lady that only being in bed could 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:23.789
 ascended to my bed 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.430
 the desire to leave the freestyle carlos 

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:32.110
 in the morning he learns by his letters 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:34.440

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:34.440
