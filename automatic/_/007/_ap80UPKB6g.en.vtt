00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
box a little bit smaller so it's gonna

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.990 
box a little bit smaller so it's gonna
hold<00:00:21.539> a<00:00:21.869> little<00:00:22.350> bit<00:00:22.560> less<00:00:22.800> obviously<00:00:23.369> so

hold a little bit less obviously so

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.080 
hold a little bit less obviously so
let's<00:00:24.869> get<00:00:25.019> started<00:00:25.320> any<00:00:26.039> an<00:00:26.220> empty<00:00:26.550> box<00:00:26.760> you

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
let's get started any an empty box you

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.120 
let's get started any an empty box you
can<00:00:27.300> use<00:00:27.330> the<00:00:27.689> lid<00:00:27.930> as<00:00:28.109> a<00:00:28.199> lipstick<00:00:28.769> holder<00:00:28.890> as

can use the lid as a lipstick holder as

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.890 
can use the lid as a lipstick holder as
well<00:00:29.340> but<00:00:29.609> it's<00:00:29.880> kind<00:00:30.179> of<00:00:30.269> shallow<00:00:30.510> so<00:00:30.810> the

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
well but it's kind of shallow so the

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.479 
well but it's kind of shallow so the
lipsticks<00:00:31.230> won't<00:00:31.439> stand<00:00:31.679> up<00:00:31.830> as<00:00:32.009> well<00:00:32.189> so<00:00:32.460> I

lipsticks won't stand up as well so I

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.740

have<00:01:40.710> nine<00:01:40.860> lipsticks<00:01:41.340> remember<00:01:41.670> there's<00:01:41.820> a

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
have nine lipsticks remember there's a

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.210 
have nine lipsticks remember there's a
little<00:01:42.090> space<00:01:42.329> so<00:01:42.600> you<00:01:42.659> can<00:01:42.960> give<00:01:43.140> leeway<00:01:43.439> as

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
little space so you can give leeway as

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.319 
little space so you can give leeway as
to<00:01:44.579> how<00:01:45.240> wide<00:01:45.540> it<00:01:45.899> is<00:01:46.560> going<00:01:46.860> this<00:01:47.520> way<00:01:47.759> but<00:01:48.180> for

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
to how wide it is going this way but for

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:49.969 
to how wide it is going this way but for
this<00:01:48.420> one<00:01:48.630> it's<00:01:48.840> pretty<00:01:48.930> it's<00:01:49.530> pretty<00:01:49.770> tight

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
this one it's pretty it's pretty tight

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:57.440 
this one it's pretty it's pretty tight
so<00:01:51.020> one<00:01:52.070> two<00:01:53.070> three<00:01:53.329> four<00:01:54.920> five<00:01:55.920> six<00:01:56.729> seven

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
so one two three four five six seven

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.889 
so one two three four five six seven
eight<00:01:58.159> so<00:01:59.159> since<00:01:59.670> there's<00:01:59.880> eight<00:02:00.149> slots<00:02:00.420> you

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
eight so since there's eight slots you

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.679 
eight so since there's eight slots you
make<00:02:01.110> eight<00:02:01.710> dividers<00:02:02.520> on<00:02:02.790> that<00:02:03.149> side<00:02:03.390> so

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
make eight dividers on that side so

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:10.309 
make eight dividers on that side so
here's<00:02:04.049> again<00:02:04.670> one<00:02:05.780> two<00:02:06.799> three<00:02:07.799> four<00:02:08.670> five<00:02:09.539> six

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
here's again one two three four five six

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.410 
here's again one two three four five six
since<00:02:11.220> if<00:02:11.370> it's<00:02:11.520> seven<00:02:11.819> you<00:02:12.000> make<00:02:12.180> six

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
since if it's seven you make six

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.589 
since if it's seven you make six
dividers

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:13.599 
dividers

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:15.149 
dividers
so<00:02:13.719> you<00:02:13.780> want<00:02:14.019> to<00:02:14.079> measure<00:02:14.260> your<00:02:14.499> lipstick<00:02:15.010> and

00:02:15.149 --> 00:02:15.159

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:17.469 
this lipstick is 2 centimetres wide so

00:02:17.469 --> 00:02:18.959 
this lipstick is 2 centimetres wide so
all<00:02:17.680> of<00:02:17.829> the<00:02:18.010> sections<00:02:18.400> are<00:02:18.519> going<00:02:18.549> to<00:02:18.670> be<00:02:18.790> 2

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:18.969 
all of the sections are going to be 2

00:02:18.969 --> 00:02:21.899 
all of the sections are going to be 2
centimetres<00:02:19.450> wide<00:02:19.980> ok<00:02:20.980> so<00:02:21.040> next<00:02:21.430> you're<00:02:21.730> going

00:02:21.899 --> 00:02:21.909 
centimetres wide ok so next you're going

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:24.030 
centimetres wide ok so next you're going
to<00:02:22.030> measure<00:02:22.209> your<00:02:22.420> box<00:02:22.870> and<00:02:23.170> you<00:02:23.680> can<00:02:23.859> use<00:02:24.010> a

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
to measure your box and you can use a

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.679 
to measure your box and you can use a
ruler<00:02:24.310> for<00:02:24.340> this<00:02:24.519> I<00:02:24.730> just<00:02:24.790> use<00:02:25.060> the<00:02:25.209> actual<00:02:25.510> box

00:02:25.679 --> 00:02:25.689 
ruler for this I just use the actual box

00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:27.989 
ruler for this I just use the actual box
you<00:02:25.959> just<00:02:25.989> want<00:02:26.260> to<00:02:26.290> make<00:02:26.439> two<00:02:26.469> dots<00:02:26.950> and<00:02:27.400> then

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:27.999 
you just want to make two dots and then

00:02:27.999 --> 00:02:29.339 
you just want to make two dots and then
you're<00:02:28.239> going<00:02:28.329> to<00:02:28.389> connect<00:02:28.719> these<00:02:28.840> two<00:02:29.139> dots

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:29.349 
you're going to connect these two dots

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:31.649 
you're going to connect these two dots
with<00:02:29.799> a<00:02:30.280> line<00:02:30.639> and<00:02:30.670> that's<00:02:31.150> going<00:02:31.269> to<00:02:31.329> tell<00:02:31.540> you

00:02:31.649 --> 00:02:31.659 
with a line and that's going to tell you

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:34.110 
with a line and that's going to tell you
how<00:02:31.900> long<00:02:32.200> or<00:02:32.889> how<00:02:32.920> wide<00:02:33.219> your<00:02:33.489> first<00:02:33.760> divider

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
how long or how wide your first divider

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.199 
how long or how wide your first divider
is<00:02:34.239> going<00:02:34.420> to<00:02:34.480> be<00:02:34.889> ok<00:02:35.889> so<00:02:35.950> since<00:02:36.519> you<00:02:36.730> know<00:02:36.790> that

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
is going to be ok so since you know that

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:38.640 
is going to be ok so since you know that
seven<00:02:37.569> lipsticks<00:02:37.930> are<00:02:38.049> going<00:02:38.170> to<00:02:38.260> fit<00:02:38.439> here

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
seven lipsticks are going to fit here

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.429 
seven lipsticks are going to fit here
you're<00:02:38.829> going<00:02:38.920> to<00:02:38.980> make<00:02:39.250> six<00:02:39.639> notches<00:02:39.969> so<00:02:40.810> you

00:02:41.429 --> 00:02:41.439 
you're going to make six notches so you

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:42.839 
you're going to make six notches so you
already<00:02:41.530> know<00:02:41.769> that<00:02:41.980> the<00:02:42.069> lipstick<00:02:42.370> is<00:02:42.549> around

00:02:42.839 --> 00:02:42.849 
already know that the lipstick is around

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:44.670 
already know that the lipstick is around
two<00:02:43.060> centimetres<00:02:43.569> each<00:02:43.780> so<00:02:43.989> each<00:02:44.169> section<00:02:44.409> is

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
two centimetres each so each section is

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:45.929 
two centimetres each so each section is
going<00:02:44.799> to<00:02:44.859> be<00:02:44.950> around<00:02:45.189> two<00:02:45.400> centimetres

00:02:45.929 --> 00:02:45.939 
going to be around two centimetres

00:02:45.939 --> 00:02:48.300 
going to be around two centimetres
there's<00:02:46.629> just<00:02:46.900> a<00:02:47.019> tiny<00:02:47.349> bit<00:02:47.709> of<00:02:47.799> space<00:02:48.069> to

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
there's just a tiny bit of space to

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.500 
there's just a tiny bit of space to
ensure<00:02:49.000> that<00:02:49.239> your<00:02:49.510> lipsticks<00:02:49.930> will<00:02:50.169> fit<00:02:50.469> and

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
ensure that your lipsticks will fit and

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.390 
ensure that your lipsticks will fit and
since<00:02:52.510> I'm<00:02:52.629> not<00:02:52.810> I'm<00:02:53.109> never<00:02:53.590> super<00:02:54.069> precise

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
since I'm not I'm never super precise

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.580 
since I'm not I'm never super precise
little<00:02:54.699> anything<00:02:55.090> like<00:02:55.299> I<00:02:55.449> just<00:02:55.569> hate<00:02:57.060> I'm<00:02:58.060> not

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
little anything like I just hate I'm not

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.259 
little anything like I just hate I'm not
super<00:02:59.590> detail-oriented<00:03:00.310> so<00:03:00.760> I'm<00:03:00.879> not<00:03:01.060> going

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:01.269 
super detail-oriented so I'm not going

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:03.059 
super detail-oriented so I'm not going
to<00:03:01.329> measure<00:03:01.540> like<00:03:01.930> I<00:03:02.109> know<00:03:02.199> for<00:03:02.349> a<00:03:02.620> fact<00:03:02.680> these

00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:03.069 
to measure like I know for a fact these

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:05.189 
to measure like I know for a fact these
are<00:03:03.250> not<00:03:03.400> all<00:03:03.579> evenly<00:03:04.030> spaced<00:03:04.359> if<00:03:04.629> you're

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:05.199 
are not all evenly spaced if you're

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:08.009 
are not all evenly spaced if you're
really<00:03:05.560> really<00:03:06.129> crazy<00:03:06.879> about<00:03:07.209> that<00:03:07.269> then<00:03:07.870> you

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:08.019 
really really crazy about that then you

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:09.720 
really really crazy about that then you
want<00:03:08.169> to<00:03:08.260> do<00:03:08.379> exact<00:03:08.769> measurements<00:03:09.310> I<00:03:09.370> just<00:03:09.579> did

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
want to do exact measurements I just did

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:11.369 
want to do exact measurements I just did
around<00:03:10.090> two<00:03:10.269> centimetres<00:03:10.810> as<00:03:10.959> you<00:03:11.109> can<00:03:11.230> see

00:03:11.369 --> 00:03:11.379 
around two centimetres as you can see

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:14.069 
around two centimetres as you can see
there's<00:03:11.590> way<00:03:11.739> more<00:03:12.010> space<00:03:12.250> here<00:03:12.699> than<00:03:13.079> there

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:14.079 
there's way more space here than there

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:15.899 
there's way more space here than there
is<00:03:14.109> in<00:03:14.260> this<00:03:14.620> one<00:03:14.829> so<00:03:15.159> next<00:03:15.370> what<00:03:15.609> you're<00:03:15.790> going

00:03:15.899 --> 00:03:15.909 
is in this one so next what you're going

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:21.990 
is in this one so next what you're going
to<00:03:15.939> do<00:03:16.180> is<00:03:16.449> measure<00:03:17.379> how<00:03:18.250> tall<00:03:18.280> the<00:03:19.150> box<00:03:19.389> is<00:03:21.000> so

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
to do is measure how tall the box is so

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.890 
to do is measure how tall the box is so
right<00:03:22.209> here<00:03:22.870> it<00:03:23.280> stops<00:03:24.280> right<00:03:24.579> there<00:03:24.750> so<00:03:25.750> as

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
right here it stops right there so as

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.390 
right here it stops right there so as
you<00:03:26.079> can<00:03:26.229> see<00:03:26.439> I<00:03:26.470> made<00:03:26.709> another<00:03:26.919> line<00:03:27.189> at<00:03:27.310> the

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
you can see I made another line at the

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.219 
you can see I made another line at the
bottom<00:03:27.579> and<00:03:27.909> that's<00:03:28.060> just<00:03:28.389> how<00:03:28.599> tall<00:03:28.659> the

00:03:29.219 --> 00:03:29.229 
bottom and that's just how tall the

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:31.589 
bottom and that's just how tall the
boxes<00:03:29.650> all<00:03:29.829> together<00:03:30.040> and<00:03:30.549> you're<00:03:31.239> just<00:03:31.419> going

00:03:31.589 --> 00:03:31.599 
boxes all together and you're just going

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:38.360 
boxes all together and you're just going
to<00:03:31.659> bring<00:03:31.900> the<00:03:32.139> notches<00:03:32.349> down<00:03:32.769> halfway

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.530 

so<00:03:39.370> now<00:03:39.549> that<00:03:39.610> I've<00:03:39.849> cut<00:03:40.090> out<00:03:40.120> my<00:03:40.329> first

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
so now that I've cut out my first

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.149 
so now that I've cut out my first
divider<00:03:40.900> I'm<00:03:41.230> just<00:03:41.379> going<00:03:41.530> to<00:03:41.620> slide<00:03:41.890> it<00:03:41.920> into

00:03:42.149 --> 00:03:42.159 
divider I'm just going to slide it into

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:44.339 
divider I'm just going to slide it into
the<00:03:42.280> box<00:03:42.459> see<00:03:42.760> if<00:03:42.879> it<00:03:43.030> fits<00:03:43.329> and<00:03:43.629> if<00:03:44.200> you're

00:03:44.339 --> 00:03:44.349 
the box see if it fits and if you're

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:46.140 
the box see if it fits and if you're
having<00:03:44.469> trouble<00:03:44.950> getting<00:03:45.370> the<00:03:45.549> divider<00:03:45.819> into

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
having trouble getting the divider into

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.059 
having trouble getting the divider into
the<00:03:46.269> box<00:03:46.480> you<00:03:46.689> just<00:03:46.840> want<00:03:47.079> to<00:03:47.200> slice<00:03:47.469> off<00:03:47.739> like

00:03:48.059 --> 00:03:48.069 
the box you just want to slice off like

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:50.640 
the box you just want to slice off like
maybe<00:03:48.489> a<00:03:48.609> tiny<00:03:48.939> bit<00:03:49.239> on<00:03:49.390> the<00:03:49.629> side<00:03:49.870> just<00:03:50.530> to

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
maybe a tiny bit on the side just to

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:52.709 
maybe a tiny bit on the side just to
make<00:03:50.799> sure<00:03:50.829> it<00:03:51.040> fits<00:03:51.250> so<00:03:51.909> for<00:03:52.209> the<00:03:52.329> lines<00:03:52.540> that

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:52.719 
make sure it fits so for the lines that

00:03:52.719 --> 00:03:54.569 
make sure it fits so for the lines that
you<00:03:52.780> drew<00:03:53.079> you're<00:03:53.290> actually<00:03:53.680> going<00:03:53.829> to<00:03:53.950> cut<00:03:54.280> a

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:54.579 
you drew you're actually going to cut a

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:57.270 
you drew you're actually going to cut a
little<00:03:55.480> bit<00:03:55.720> thicker<00:03:56.079> than<00:03:56.590> the<00:03:56.799> line<00:03:57.099> that's

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
little bit thicker than the line that's

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.860 
little bit thicker than the line that's
already<00:03:57.519> there<00:03:57.790> and<00:03:58.030> this<00:03:58.420> is<00:03:58.540> just<00:03:58.720> going<00:03:58.810> to

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
already there and this is just going to

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:00.390 
already there and this is just going to
make<00:03:59.049> it<00:03:59.170> much<00:03:59.409> easier<00:03:59.680> when<00:04:00.010> you're<00:04:00.159> putting

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
make it much easier when you're putting

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.869 
make it much easier when you're putting
together<00:04:00.640> your<00:04:00.849> dividers<00:04:02.400> so<00:04:03.400> once<00:04:03.639> you

00:04:03.869 --> 00:04:03.879 
together your dividers so once you

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:05.369 
together your dividers so once you
finish<00:04:04.120> your<00:04:04.239> first<00:04:04.299> divider<00:04:04.810> you<00:04:04.959> just<00:04:05.230> got

00:04:05.369 --> 00:04:05.379 
finish your first divider you just got

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:06.899 
finish your first divider you just got
to<00:04:05.470> trace<00:04:05.739> it<00:04:05.980> and<00:04:06.129> you<00:04:06.250> can<00:04:06.459> just<00:04:06.670> make

00:04:06.899 --> 00:04:06.909 
to trace it and you can just make

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:09.539 
to trace it and you can just make
multiple<00:04:07.750> and<00:04:08.019> then<00:04:08.409> I'm<00:04:08.709> just<00:04:08.980> doing<00:04:09.250> this<00:04:09.370> to

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:09.549 
multiple and then I'm just doing this to

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:11.129 
multiple and then I'm just doing this to
make<00:04:09.700> sure<00:04:09.909> all<00:04:10.090> of<00:04:10.120> the<00:04:10.359> dividers<00:04:10.629> fit<00:04:10.959> in<00:04:11.049> the

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:11.139 
make sure all of the dividers fit in the

00:04:11.139 --> 00:04:12.660 
make sure all of the dividers fit in the
box<00:04:11.379> as<00:04:11.650> you<00:04:11.799> can<00:04:11.829> see<00:04:12.099> if<00:04:12.220> it<00:04:12.370> bends<00:04:12.519> a<00:04:12.639> little

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:12.670 
box as you can see if it bends a little

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:14.309 
box as you can see if it bends a little
bit<00:04:12.970> there<00:04:13.180> you<00:04:13.329> just<00:04:13.510> want<00:04:13.689> to<00:04:13.720> cut<00:04:13.930> off<00:04:14.079> a

00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:14.319 
bit there you just want to cut off a

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:17.400 
bit there you just want to cut off a
little<00:04:14.349> bit<00:04:14.650> of<00:04:14.829> the<00:04:14.980> edge<00:04:15.099> and<00:04:16.109> basically<00:04:17.109> for

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:17.410 
little bit of the edge and basically for

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:19.259 
little bit of the edge and basically for
the<00:04:17.949> vertical<00:04:18.310> sections<00:04:18.639> as<00:04:18.759> well<00:04:18.910> you<00:04:19.090> do<00:04:19.239> the

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:19.269 
the vertical sections as well you do the

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:21.240 
the vertical sections as well you do the
exact<00:04:19.810> same<00:04:20.049> thing<00:04:20.380> obviously<00:04:20.949> it's<00:04:21.070> going<00:04:21.190> to

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250 
exact same thing obviously it's going to

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:23.580 
exact same thing obviously it's going to
be<00:04:21.400> a<00:04:21.430> little<00:04:21.699> bit<00:04:21.820> longer<00:04:22.060> but<00:04:22.449> measuring<00:04:23.349> and

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590 
be a little bit longer but measuring and

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:28.900 
be a little bit longer but measuring and
all<00:04:23.680> that<00:04:23.860> is<00:04:24.009> going<00:04:24.070> to<00:04:24.190> be<00:04:24.280> exactly<00:04:24.610> the<00:04:24.699> same

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:28.910 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:31.130 

so<00:04:29.910> once<00:04:30.090> you've<00:04:30.240> made<00:04:30.270> all<00:04:30.570> of<00:04:30.690> your<00:04:30.840> dividers

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:31.140 
so once you've made all of your dividers

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:33.020 
so once you've made all of your dividers
all<00:04:31.530> you<00:04:31.680> want<00:04:31.830> to<00:04:31.890> do<00:04:32.010> is<00:04:32.160> line<00:04:32.370> up<00:04:32.400> the<00:04:32.580> slots

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 
all you want to do is line up the slots

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:35.300 
all you want to do is line up the slots
and<00:04:33.360> then<00:04:33.510> just<00:04:34.020> basically<00:04:34.560> slide<00:04:34.980> them<00:04:35.160> in

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.310 
and then just basically slide them in

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:37.280 
and then just basically slide them in
and<00:04:35.490> honestly<00:04:36.150> I<00:04:36.210> would<00:04:36.420> say<00:04:36.450> this<00:04:36.720> is<00:04:36.960> the

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:37.290 
and honestly I would say this is the

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:40.010 
and honestly I would say this is the
most<00:04:37.770> annoying<00:04:38.100> part<00:04:38.520> of<00:04:38.580> the<00:04:38.790> whole<00:04:39.150> lipstick

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
most annoying part of the whole lipstick

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:42.230 
most annoying part of the whole lipstick
holder<00:04:40.200> the<00:04:40.950> measuring<00:04:41.280> stuff<00:04:41.520> is<00:04:41.670> fine<00:04:41.910> but

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 
holder the measuring stuff is fine but

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.140 
holder the measuring stuff is fine but
these<00:04:42.750> damn<00:04:43.170> slots<00:04:43.620> just<00:04:44.250> make<00:04:44.490> me<00:04:44.670> so<00:04:44.880> angry

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150 
these damn slots just make me so angry

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:52.250 
these damn slots just make me so angry
and<00:04:45.630> you'll<00:04:45.840> know<00:04:45.990> why<00:04:46.170> when<00:04:46.410> you<00:04:46.530> make<00:04:46.710> it<00:04:51.260> so

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:52.260 
and you'll know why when you make it so

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.170 
and you'll know why when you make it so
just<00:04:52.680> to<00:04:52.830> make<00:04:53.010> it<00:04:53.070> a<00:04:53.340> little<00:04:53.580> bit<00:04:53.760> easier<00:04:54.120> for

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:54.180 
just to make it a little bit easier for

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:57.230 
just to make it a little bit easier for
you<00:04:54.390> I<00:04:54.510> always<00:04:55.050> put<00:04:55.440> the<00:04:56.370> two<00:04:56.640> top<00:04:56.970> pieces

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240 
you I always put the two top pieces

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:58.850 
you I always put the two top pieces
first<00:04:57.570> at<00:04:57.810> the<00:04:57.870> top<00:04:58.020> and<00:04:58.200> bottom<00:04:58.260> piece<00:04:58.590> just

00:04:58.850 --> 00:04:58.860 
first at the top and bottom piece just

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:02.180 
first at the top and bottom piece just
so<00:04:59.100> the<00:04:59.460> I<00:04:59.880> guess<00:05:00.570> the<00:05:00.750> arms<00:05:01.080> the<00:05:01.560> sections

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:02.190 
so the I guess the arms the sections

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:03.620 
so the I guess the arms the sections
aren't<00:05:02.460> going<00:05:02.580> to<00:05:02.640> be<00:05:02.700> flimsy<00:05:02.970> flopping<00:05:03.540> all

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:03.630 
aren't going to be flimsy flopping all

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:05.960 
aren't going to be flimsy flopping all
around<00:05:03.900> the<00:05:04.020> place<00:05:04.200> but<00:05:04.830> honestly<00:05:05.280> you<00:05:05.760> have

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:05.970 
around the place but honestly you have

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:07.550 
around the place but honestly you have
to<00:05:06.060> be<00:05:06.120> patient<00:05:06.330> with<00:05:06.600> this<00:05:06.690> because<00:05:07.140> I've

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.560 
to be patient with this because I've

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.260 
to be patient with this because I've
done<00:05:07.770> this<00:05:07.830> before<00:05:07.950> and<00:05:08.280> I<00:05:08.550> got<00:05:08.700> so<00:05:08.880> mad<00:05:09.030> that<00:05:09.090> I

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:09.270 
done this before and I got so mad that I

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:10.520 
done this before and I got so mad that I
just<00:05:09.540> ripped<00:05:09.930> them<00:05:10.110> all

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:10.530 
just ripped them all

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:12.920 
just ripped them all
so<00:05:10.920> you<00:05:11.580> just<00:05:11.760> have<00:05:11.940> to<00:05:12.090> be<00:05:12.210> careful<00:05:12.450> and<00:05:12.780> you

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:12.930 
so you just have to be careful and you

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:14.540 
so you just have to be careful and you
have<00:05:13.050> to<00:05:13.200> be<00:05:13.290> really<00:05:13.500> patient<00:05:13.680> with<00:05:13.980> this<00:05:14.220> and

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:14.550 
have to be really patient with this and

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:16.670 
have to be really patient with this and
just<00:05:14.640> make<00:05:14.820> sure<00:05:14.900> everything<00:05:15.900> is<00:05:16.170> where<00:05:16.530> it

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:16.680 
just make sure everything is where it

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:21.450 
just make sure everything is where it
needs<00:05:16.740> to<00:05:17.070> be

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:21.460 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:23.680

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:23.690 
so this is how it's going to look once

00:05:28.689 --> 00:05:28.699

having<00:05:28.970> any<00:05:29.060> trouble<00:05:29.300> fitting<00:05:29.810> into<00:05:29.960> the<00:05:30.169> box

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:30.380 
having any trouble fitting into the box

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:32.230 
having any trouble fitting into the box
you<00:05:30.650> just<00:05:30.680> have<00:05:31.039> to<00:05:31.190> slice<00:05:31.430> off<00:05:31.639> you<00:05:31.910> know<00:05:32.000> just

a<00:05:32.330> tiny<00:05:32.360> bit<00:05:32.780> of<00:05:32.810> the<00:05:33.020> edge<00:05:33.199> and<00:05:33.590> then<00:05:33.770> it

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:33.919 
a tiny bit of the edge and then it

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:39.070 
a tiny bit of the edge and then it
should<00:05:34.100> fit<00:05:34.280> in<00:05:34.400> perfectly<00:05:37.539> so<00:05:38.539> this<00:05:38.780> is<00:05:38.930> the
