00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
kind of a new total direction I mean

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.600 
kind of a new total direction I mean
supernaturals<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.360> show<00:01:57.539> I<00:01:57.810> mean<00:01:58.050> I<00:01:58.140> think

00:02:01.309 --> 00:02:01.319 
that's always been pretty good about

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:04.160 
that's always been pretty good about
reinventing<00:02:01.920> itself<00:02:02.159> and<00:02:02.929> you<00:02:03.929> know<00:02:04.020> it

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
reinventing itself and you know it

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.809 
reinventing itself and you know it
started<00:02:04.560> as<00:02:04.679> a<00:02:04.710> demon<00:02:05.159> show<00:02:05.369> and<00:02:05.640> that<00:02:05.670> it

00:02:05.809 --> 00:02:05.819 
started as a demon show and that it

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:07.490 
started as a demon show and that it
became<00:02:06.119> an<00:02:06.299> angel<00:02:06.659> show<00:02:06.869> that<00:02:07.140> it<00:02:07.229> became<00:02:07.440> a

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
became an angel show that it became a

became an angel show that it became a
fine

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
fine

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.420 
fine
all<00:02:09.030> this<00:02:09.210> from<00:02:09.590> hell<00:02:10.590> even<00:02:10.619> before<00:02:10.950> a<00:02:11.130> demon

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
all this from hell even before a demon

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.820 
all this from hell even before a demon
show<00:02:11.610> is<00:02:11.760> the<00:02:11.910> monster<00:02:12.090> show<00:02:12.510> so<00:02:12.900> so<00:02:13.710> I<00:02:13.740> think

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
show is the monster show so so I think

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.160 
show is the monster show so so I think
it's<00:02:14.100> a<00:02:14.190> show<00:02:14.370> that<00:02:14.400> thrives<00:02:14.880> on<00:02:15.270> always

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
it's a show that thrives on always

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.110 
it's a show that thrives on always
changing<00:02:16.890> into<00:02:17.040> something<00:02:17.250> else<00:02:17.550> and<00:02:17.850> you

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
changing into something else and you

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.080 
changing into something else and you
know<00:02:18.210> and<00:02:18.330> I<00:02:18.390> liken<00:02:18.720> it<00:02:18.780> to<00:02:18.840> or<00:02:19.230> I<00:02:19.260> hope<00:02:19.680> it<00:02:19.890> is

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
know and I liken it to or I hope it is

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.100 
know and I liken it to or I hope it is
the<00:02:21.090> difference<00:02:21.360> between<00:02:21.420> like<00:02:21.810> an<00:02:21.960> alien

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
the difference between like an alien

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.720 
the difference between like an alien
movies<00:02:22.650> I<00:02:22.890> mean<00:02:23.070> before<00:02:23.220> they<00:02:23.370> got<00:02:23.460> weird

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
movies I mean before they got weird

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.830 
movies I mean before they got weird
around<00:02:24.180> like<00:02:24.540> notices<00:02:25.700> 457<00:02:26.700> whatever<00:02:27.000> but

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
around like notices 457 whatever but

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.420 
around like notices 457 whatever but
like<00:02:27.870> the<00:02:28.350> way<00:02:28.380> that<00:02:28.620> like<00:02:28.920> different

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
like the way that like different

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.070 
like the way that like different
filmmakers<00:02:29.970> brought<00:02:30.210> to<00:02:30.420> them<00:02:30.570> a<00:02:30.600> different

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
filmmakers brought to them a different

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.810 
filmmakers brought to them a different
style<00:02:31.470> and<00:02:31.890> I'm<00:02:31.950> hoping<00:02:32.280> that<00:02:32.340> supernatural

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
style and I'm hoping that supernatural

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.090 
style and I'm hoping that supernatural
has<00:02:33.420> a<00:02:33.720> little<00:02:34.350> bit<00:02:34.470> of<00:02:34.560> that<00:02:34.590> I<00:02:34.710> hope<00:02:34.950> it's

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
has a little bit of that I hope it's

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.450 
has a little bit of that I hope it's
recognizable<00:02:35.900> recognizably<00:02:36.900> our<00:02:37.050> show<00:02:37.400> but<00:02:38.400> i

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460 
recognizable recognizably our show but i

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.000 
recognizable recognizably our show but i
think<00:02:38.790> the<00:02:38.880> seasons<00:02:39.240> prettier<00:02:39.960> and<00:02:40.080> kind<00:02:40.920> of

time you learn something new the
mythology<00:03:11.430> it<00:03:11.580> changes<00:03:12.000> the<00:03:12.120> game<00:03:12.360> before<00:03:12.840> it

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
mythology it changes the game before it

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.259
