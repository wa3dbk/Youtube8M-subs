00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:16.929 
it before how do you think of wine well
I<00:00:15.379> thought<00:00:15.769> it<00:00:15.889> were<00:00:15.980> real<00:00:16.129> good<00:00:16.340> one<00:00:16.580> so<00:00:16.730> we

00:00:16.929 --> 00:00:16.939 
I thought it were real good one so we

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:19.120 
I thought it were real good one so we
got<00:00:17.359> partial<00:00:17.570> things<00:00:17.930> up<00:00:18.140> let's<00:00:18.800> get<00:00:19.010> more

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:19.130 
got partial things up let's get more

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.179 
got partial things up let's get more
plays<00:00:19.400> and<00:00:19.760> then<00:00:20.750> just<00:00:21.050> say<00:00:21.260> hello<00:00:21.830> football

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:22.189

plays and then just say hello football
600<00:00:22.820> football<00:00:23.150> so<00:00:23.359> I<00:00:23.570> think<00:00:23.900> over<00:00:24.260> time<00:00:24.289> where

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:24.859 
600 football so I think over time where

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:27.279 
600 football so I think over time where
it<00:00:25.010> was<00:00:25.189> how<00:00:25.550> do<00:00:25.970> you<00:00:26.000> think<00:00:26.210> like<00:00:26.390> the<00:00:26.900> harvest

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:27.289

it was how do you think like the harvest
first<00:00:27.470> first<00:00:27.830> shot<00:00:28.010> I<00:00:28.250> think<00:00:29.090> plate<00:00:29.300> did<00:00:29.660> a

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:29.960 
first first shot I think plate did a

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.290 
first first shot I think plate did a
really<00:00:30.109> good<00:00:30.230> job<00:00:30.289> like<00:00:30.769> I<00:00:30.890> said<00:00:31.180> it's<00:00:32.180> our

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:32.300 
really good job like I said it's our

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.000 
really good job like I said it's our
first<00:00:32.510> game<00:00:32.720> so<00:00:33.110> we<00:00:33.290> had<00:00:33.380> to<00:00:33.470> see<00:00:33.590> what<00:00:33.710> we<00:00:33.830> were

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.010 
first game so we had to see what we were

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.730 
first game so we had to see what we were
and<00:00:34.310> I<00:00:34.580> think<00:00:34.940> overall<00:00:35.300> employment<00:00:35.750> ease<00:00:36.110> we

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:36.740
