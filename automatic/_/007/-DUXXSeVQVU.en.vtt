00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:11.570
 IPhone fourth generation, more wonderful than other products 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:18.720
 I mean, the new iPhone will have a strong impact on how we communicate together 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.100
 In 2007, the iPhone revolutionized the world of phones 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:28.600
 In 2008, the iPhone 3GG technology introduced a 3G compatible speed 

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.990
 There has been a giant revolution in this area 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.360
 In 2009, the iPhone 3GS was twice as fast 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.960
 New features have been added as video recording 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.220
 In 2010, the iPhone develops the fourth generation 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.510
 A big difference from the original generation of it 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.310
 In terms of its great view 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.350
 We have also added a video call service to the world 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.920
 We have called it face-to-face 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.610
 This will change the way we communicate together forever 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.680
 The first time I made face-to-face contact 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:07.980
 I was astounded 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:14.170
 Because it increases our human affinity in a wonderful way 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:18.640
 I am thinking of my children 7 or 8 years old when they go to university 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:24.750
 And imagine the possibility of Mahathm and vision and even look in their eyes 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:26.660
 I see how they really are 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:31.610
 Better to navigate 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.860
 From the front camera to the rear camera 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.120
 So you can show what you see to the other person 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:42.460
 Because it's easy to navigate as your phone, you can have an electronic conversation anywhere 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:47.760
 The wonderful thing is that every time I use it I can not believe it is real 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.990
 And it actually happens 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:57.040
 Another wonderful thing is the view 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.880
 It is the highest level of clarity in all generations of the iPhone 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:06.350
 326 megapixels for an inch are four times the number previously 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.650
 Instead of the blur of the individual pixels 

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:12.230
 You can clearly see the boundaries of the shape 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.460
 It looks like you're carrying a printed page in your hand 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.240
 The ability to get details about images is special 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.710
 Another thing that increases visibility is the size of the thin vision lens 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:30.060
 It is a characteristic technical feature 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.110
 Which thinning the glass display screen 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.180
 Which reduces optical reflectivity 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.960
 So all efforts have been made to obtain a high definition display 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.300
 To show the smallest visible image 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.780
 And above all using IPS technology 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.060
 And LED backlight 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.360
 So you get more luxury in everything you do 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.240
 The level of display over the iPhone is amazing 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:01.620
 You can see the finer details from any other device 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.310
 The text appears wonderfully 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:09.130
 This phone lets you navigate between several tasks for all of its apps 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.740
 You can quickly switch between apps 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.000
 You'll see that each of them stopped completely where I left it 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.730
 If there are multiple applications on your device 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.320
 You can easily organize and access them 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.210
 Just as organized by the files 

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:30.470
 Take a file and drag it to the other, so it will automatically form a folder 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.390
 Which will be cleverly named in the name of the files you have collected 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.890
 As for mail, it is remarkably effective 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.040
 Where you can see all messages from multiple emails 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.120
 In one unified mail 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:48.260
 You can also organize all messages in your mail 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.440
 Thus dealing with each subject together 

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:55.780
 Images taken with a 5 megapixel camera look amazing 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:59.860
 Because of LED light you can take pictures with dim light 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:06.280
 The camera also enables you to capture HD 720p video 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.190
 About 30 pictures per second 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:13.460
 You will not only be able to record a video, but will also be able to edit it 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.950
 Directly via the iPhone with the iMovie program 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:21.900
 The simplicity and ease of the iPhone for the user 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:25.310
 Behind it is huge technology 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:30.330
 One of the most exciting programs is the iFs 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:35.230
 Which is composed of modified silicon, which provides him with efficiency and speed characteristic 

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:37.060
 Really small slice 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:40.110
 The only thing we made bigger was the battery 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.950
 In fact, this phone will save you about 40 percent when you talk more 

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:49.320
 We started with really conflicting goals 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:54.310
 We wanted to make this phone able to implement more properties 

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:58.300
 At the same time we wanted to make it smaller and thinner 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:02.250
 This has made him a remarkable revolution 

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:06.340
 We also formed a new kind of stainless steel 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:12.680
 Making it strong after manufacturing and also coordinated 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.260
 The metal frame is not just an antenna 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:19.490
 But a basic structure that reduces the size of the antennae 

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:23.490
 We also developed a special kind of glass 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:25.710
 The power of the Sava crystal is almost as strong 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:29.330
 And even about 30 times the strength of plastic 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:33.000
 This glass is not only used in the front of the phone 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.810
 But also at the back 

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:41.500
 Material quality, manufacturing process and advanced technology 

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:47.430
 Have become consistent together as soon as you hold it in your hand 

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:52.040
 Even face-to-face communication with all its modern features 

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:54.050
 Means a modern and stunning generation of the iPhone 

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:56.940
 And the fact that we have configured our distinctive phone model 

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:58.910
 And a 5 megapixel camera 

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:00.760
 And long-term video recording 

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:01.960
 And the E4 segment 

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:03.380
 And a larger battery 

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:05.040
 The phone is thin-sized 

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:07.480
 This will change everything 

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:09.640
 one more time 

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:12.160
