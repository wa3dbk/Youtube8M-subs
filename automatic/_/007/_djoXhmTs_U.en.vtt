00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:18.029
 Then, as put so well, because even foraging headed goal put so well that even a letter 

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:19.410
 Today, rather than rolling to the feet , heading into the head 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:24.240
 I'll dig it. 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:31.529
 In order to maximize the bar player, both Ronaldo and Winnie 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:38.130
 If you use players with high cross stats like Rodriguez 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:40.380
 I'll be able to put a lot of more goals in that heading. 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:44.930
 Southern 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:49.850
 The crossroads are well put in good old days 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:51.200
 I think it would be nice if you could write a car-writing statement, 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:55.910
 Ibrahimovic 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:58.290
 The Nazis not come again pushes the tall players need to write the party contains aloe Goals 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:01.410
 Well, 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:04.730
 Fading is a little over heading 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.730
 I'll show you that kind of play. 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:13.180
 In order to maximize Bova's crossplay and heading with 2, 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:17.770
 Uh Uh That is certainly built in the middle 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:21.340
 It is important that the role of build is not even a theme deployment is called 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:25.620
 You can not rush the deployment process too fast. 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:28.720
 If you hurry you are in a hurry Uh minutes more slowly, not like this 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:34.560
 I am currently a three-altering servo ppaek 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:34.560
 I'm playing now and still like this 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.789
 I'll give it to you now . 

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:48.759
 Let's go this way with Rod. 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:50.890
 Leah'm sorry from this time in this way is top-to-be at the center is one person 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:55.569
 Turn around this way. 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:02:00.130
 For he feared to cross the intersection situation creates a lot in this way 

00:01:55.569 --> 00:02:02.670
 The cross tail definitely gets better. 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.670
 Defending with Java 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:08.289
 Now one cross cross cross into the basic timing one before 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:13.360
 I'll show you something . 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:16.920
 Several, but I'll show starting with the most basic 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.920
 Handwriting Door Slowly 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:22.540
 Jeojeo Once you have a blindly-to-reach cross saw geomyeon tutap one week 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.920
 Be 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:28.780
 Uh, just go in now, get out of the site and steam it up. 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:33.240
 A little bit of beginners 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.240
 It can be difficult . 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:41.560
 Now go again itjyo into the opposition plays a central 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:46.210
 In this way, 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:51.400
 More so than some air-to-right when you get out into the top two sides in the middle 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:56.350
 When a person is in this way, one person goes to a short form, 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:59.800
 So watch that crossed the goal put us out when that control movement are 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:05.490
 There's more opportunity to see the acros ball. 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:05.490
 The immersion is now a little like the cross a little backwards 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:16.190
 Haetguyo hold the head rather than just heading 4 in this way also lob 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:20.690
 Well, of course, right Drogba ahkkado what I said only the head of a well-Goals 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:22.430
 Since it is not so good for a player and it is good for a foot , 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:27.800
 When playing, 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:33.290
 Your opponent is doing a little confusing cross-over, and now you're in the center hallway like this 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:38.390
 Let's watch the Drogba Egg maximize his score. 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:40.460
 Well yes rather more defensive tail when this happens because the climate in 2 0 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:47.550
 You lot 

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:53.250
 Your opponent will be more urgent and more forthcoming. I will use that space 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:59.340
 I'll give more characters Drogba's goal put'm going slowly 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:04:02.490
 In the morning, 2 o'clock, 1 o'clock, give it back, take it back again, 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:05.090
 If you kill, you switch against this one by one 

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:09.140
 Please let me attack you. 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:14.030
 Oh, the site is open. Listen now. 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:15.590
 Now a word into yoreonsik sometimes even contrary to stab the future, but for now those 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:21.320
 I see I have the time 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:23.240
 If you are using a groundball cross with a 3-time groundball, 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:27.410
 Your opponent will. 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:32.750
 Yes , Macross is backwards, so when you think about it 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:35.260
 Be the little cross in front of us are seasoned easy win in psychological warfare with the partner 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:35.260
 You can count. 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:40.160
 It's a defense. 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:46.840
 If there is no time to do so, 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:52.120
 Wait play 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:53.830
 I will give it to you, and the bar will come in short. 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:59.500
 As I told you, 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:05:03.970
 When you come in like a spot and do not turn around , 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:08.910
 Sebum aa a 3 times a grounder Yes, you will get used to a 3 times 

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:08.910
 I can easily put my genealogy 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:18.100
 The apostles are going slowly. 

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:19.770
 Going forward now come in exorbitant angamyeon back again once these five 

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:22.889
 By way of 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:27.930
 I'm a professional again. 

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:32.080
 When you press the Forward crossed Yes No straight squatting Add to penetrate so 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:35.470
 Inde button If this happens, hold still 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:40.720
 Bottom of the drogba half with milk 19 

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:42.640
 So when it comes to sizing, it makes q 

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:48.340
 It's not a penetration button. 

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:48.940
 In the tactic, if the cross is over 80 or 2, the two tops intersect on both sides. 

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:54.010
 I will 

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:55.840
 Press Yes q1 is rather more noticeable because the cross play in front 

00:05:54.010 --> 00:06:00.550
 I can not. 

00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:04.840
 So q is more like cy , and you should never eat it. 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:11.310
 Before the surgery a little longer and a little bit up the what and if noteusi foregoing figures are 

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:11.310
 It shows such a movement that crosses without even knowing it.
