asleep<00:03:11.370> I<00:03:11.849> personally<00:03:12.450> thought<00:03:12.599> the<00:03:12.840> crater

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
asleep I personally thought the crater

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.199 
asleep I personally thought the crater
was<00:03:13.260> erupting<00:03:13.530> which<00:03:14.519> was<00:03:14.730> slightly

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
was erupting which was slightly

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:17.570 
was erupting which was slightly
terrifying<00:03:15.900> finally<00:03:16.860> we<00:03:16.950> figured<00:03:17.280> out<00:03:17.370> what

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
terrifying finally we figured out what

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:20.120 
terrifying finally we figured out what
he<00:03:17.700> was<00:03:17.819> telling<00:03:18.180> us<00:03:18.440> we<00:03:19.440> looked<00:03:19.680> outside<00:03:20.069> and

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
he was telling us we looked outside and

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:29.510 
he was telling us we looked outside and
I<00:03:20.400> was<00:03:20.730> perfectly<00:03:21.299> clear

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:29.520 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.670 

the<00:03:29.940> next<00:03:30.240> thing<00:03:30.330> you<00:03:30.450> know<00:03:30.510> we've<00:03:31.470> got<00:03:31.650> a
