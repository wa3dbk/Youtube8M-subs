improvement yeah and the way forward
especially<00:01:14.560> when<00:01:15.430> you<00:01:15.490> use<00:01:15.580> dry<00:01:15.880> palette

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270 
especially when you use dry palette

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.719 
especially when you use dry palette
extremely<00:01:16.690> hard<00:01:16.870> yeah<00:01:17.170> these<00:01:17.680> will<00:01:17.920> last<00:01:18.400> much

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:18.729 
extremely hard yeah these will last much

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:20.610 
extremely hard yeah these will last much
longer<00:01:18.790> than<00:01:19.210> that<00:01:19.270> stainless<00:01:20.229> steel<00:01:20.409> right

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:20.620 
longer than that stainless steel right

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:22.469 
longer than that stainless steel right
yes<00:01:20.950> yeah<00:01:21.220> yes<00:01:21.430> so<00:01:21.760> that<00:01:21.909> they're<00:01:22.210> never<00:01:22.330> gonna

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:22.479 
yes yeah yes so that they're never gonna

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:23.670 
yes yeah yes so that they're never gonna
go<00:01:22.630> up<00:01:22.690> alone<00:01:22.810> no<00:01:22.990> no

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:23.680 
go up alone no no

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.640 
go up alone no no
so<00:01:24.159> what<00:01:24.580> I<00:01:24.610> did<00:01:24.729> just<00:01:25.720> do<00:01:25.900> to<00:01:26.229> resolve<00:01:26.560> this

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:26.650 
so what I did just do to resolve this

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:28.289 
so what I did just do to resolve this
problem<00:01:26.799> was<00:01:27.100> peeling<00:01:27.400> everywhere<00:01:27.850> the

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:28.299 
problem was peeling everywhere the

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:30.870 
problem was peeling everywhere the
crusher<00:01:28.570> bait<00:01:28.810> I<00:01:29.080> just<00:01:29.830> made<00:01:30.010> two<00:01:30.250> different

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880 
crusher bait I just made two different

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.350 
crusher bait I just made two different
funnel<00:01:31.299> I<00:01:31.450> did<00:01:31.960> them<00:01:32.170> connect<00:01:32.799> I<00:01:33.040> screw<00:01:34.000> all

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:34.360 
funnel I did them connect I screw all

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.890 
funnel I did them connect I screw all
over<00:01:34.600> so<00:01:35.760> after<00:01:36.760> you<00:01:36.850> crush<00:01:37.090> your<00:01:37.210> bait<00:01:37.420> you

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:37.900 
over so after you crush your bait you

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.530 
over so after you crush your bait you
always<00:01:38.110> have<00:01:38.229> to<00:01:38.350> remember<00:01:38.409> to<00:01:39.540> leave

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:40.540 
always have to remember to leave

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:42.960 
always have to remember to leave
everything<00:01:40.930> on<00:01:41.140> this<00:01:41.380> one<00:01:41.560> yep<00:01:41.830> and<00:01:42.369> then<00:01:42.729> you

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:42.970 
everything on this one yep and then you

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:47.870 
everything on this one yep and then you
can<00:01:43.150> easily<00:01:43.360> connect<00:01:43.840> a<00:01:44.049> big<00:01:44.380> flow<00:01:46.320> like<00:01:47.320> this

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
can easily connect a big flow like this

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.850 
can easily connect a big flow like this
and<00:01:48.880> it's<00:01:49.119> fixed<00:01:49.330> totally<00:01:50.020> okay<00:01:50.470> so<00:01:50.650> you<00:01:50.740> just

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 
and it's fixed totally okay so you just

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.100 
and it's fixed totally okay so you just
connect<00:01:51.189> your<00:01:51.250> two<00:01:51.490> mesh<00:01:52.030> whatever<00:01:52.479> yeah<00:01:52.900> and

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 
connect your two mesh whatever yeah and

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:54.750 
connect your two mesh whatever yeah and
you<00:01:53.530> fool<00:01:53.710> and<00:01:53.950> now<00:01:54.070> that<00:01:54.280> is<00:01:54.430> the<00:01:54.580> right

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:54.760 
you fool and now that is the right

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.120 
you fool and now that is the right
diameter<00:01:55.119> to<00:01:55.540> fit<00:01:55.570> on<00:01:55.930> two<00:01:56.200> different<00:01:56.920> ways

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
diameter to fit on two different ways

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.399 
diameter to fit on two different ways
for<00:01:57.430> most<00:01:57.759> of<00:01:57.909> the<00:01:58.030> big<00:01:58.360> one<00:01:58.509> yeah<00:01:58.810> and<00:01:59.170> then<00:01:59.290> of

00:01:59.399 --> 00:01:59.409 
for most of the big one yeah and then of

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:01.230 
for most of the big one yeah and then of
