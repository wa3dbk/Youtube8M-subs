00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:47.580 
delve too much into it otherwise we're

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:48.439 
delve too much into it otherwise we're
going<00:00:47.670> to<00:00:47.729> be<00:00:47.820> here<00:00:48.059> all<00:00:48.180> night

00:00:48.439 --> 00:00:48.449 
going to be here all night

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:56.710 
going to be here all night
so<00:00:48.839> the<00:00:49.680> lick<00:00:49.949> itself<00:00:50.780> sounds<00:00:51.780> like<00:00:51.930> this

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:56.720 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.910 

there's<00:00:57.720> two<00:00:57.900> versions<00:00:58.320> there's<00:00:58.530> one<00:00:58.739> where

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
there's two versions there's one where

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.860 
there's two versions there's one where
the<00:00:59.220> bass<00:00:59.400> drum<00:00:59.640> only<00:00:59.729> plays<00:01:00.000> one<00:01:00.269> note<00:01:00.299> one

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
the bass drum only plays one note one

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:12.890 
the bass drum only plays one note one
two<00:01:01.710> a-one<00:01:02.370> two<00:01:02.850> three<00:01:03.000> four<00:01:09.890> so<00:01:11.750> the<00:01:12.750> way

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
two a-one two three four so the way

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.539 
two a-one two three four so the way
we're<00:01:13.049> going<00:01:13.170> to<00:01:13.260> break<00:01:13.440> this<00:01:13.650> down<00:01:13.710> is<00:01:14.280> pretty

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
we're going to break this down is pretty

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.210 
we're going to break this down is pretty
simple<00:01:14.930> you<00:01:15.930> want<00:01:16.140> to<00:01:16.200> think<00:01:16.440> about<00:01:16.530> the

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
simple you want to think about the

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.730 
simple you want to think about the
primary<00:01:17.850> notes<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.750> primary<00:01:19.260> notes<00:01:19.439> are<00:01:19.619> just

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
primary notes the primary notes are just

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:27.910 
primary notes the primary notes are just
one

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.800 

everything<00:01:28.920> else<00:01:29.130> is<00:01:29.400> actually<00:01:29.810> rudimental

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
everything else is actually rudimental

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.380 
everything else is actually rudimental
which<00:01:31.020> is<00:01:31.170> a<00:01:31.200> big<00:01:31.440> part<00:01:31.890> of<00:01:31.979> elven<00:01:32.340> splay<00:01:32.640> so<00:01:33.270> if

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
which is a big part of elven splay so if

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.570 
which is a big part of elven splay so if
we<00:01:33.540> take<00:01:34.400> 1/3<00:01:35.400> and<00:01:35.820> and<00:01:37.159> then<00:01:38.159> we're<00:01:38.399> going<00:01:38.549> to

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:38.580 
we take 1/3 and and then we're going to

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:49.330 
we take 1/3 and and then we're going to
add<00:01:38.960> we're<00:01:39.960> going<00:01:40.110> to<00:01:40.200> slam<00:01:40.830> on<00:01:40.860> 3<00:01:41.549> 1<00:01:42.530> and<00:01:46.820> then

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
add we're going to slam on 3 1 and then

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.109 
add we're going to slam on 3 1 and then
we're<00:01:50.340> going<00:01:50.490> to<00:01:50.549> make<00:01:50.729> it

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
we're going to make it

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.120 
we're going to make it
we're<00:01:51.840> basically<00:01:51.990> turn<00:01:52.380> it<00:01:52.470> into<00:01:52.590> a<00:01:52.680> rough<00:01:52.920> by

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
we're basically turn it into a rough by

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.219 
we're basically turn it into a rough by
adding<00:01:53.549> the<00:01:53.640> bass<00:01:53.820> drum<00:01:54.149> 1<00:01:54.420> 2<00:01:54.810> 3<00:01:55.229> 4<00:01:57.170> right<00:01:58.170> here

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
adding the bass drum 1 2 3 4 right here

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.639 
adding the bass drum 1 2 3 4 right here
that<00:01:58.530> sounds<00:01:59.990> one<00:02:00.990> of<00:02:01.050> the<00:02:01.140> biggest<00:02:01.440> things

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
that sounds one of the biggest things

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.309 
that sounds one of the biggest things
that<00:02:01.740> Elva<00:02:02.100> does<00:02:02.280> correctly<00:02:02.909> is<00:02:03.869> if<00:02:04.110> finding

00:02:04.309 --> 00:02:04.319 
that Elva does correctly is if finding

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:07.210 
that Elva does correctly is if finding
to<00:02:04.500> point<00:02:04.740> out<00:02:04.920> he<00:02:05.520> does<00:02:05.670> anything<00:02:05.970> correctly

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 
to point out he does anything correctly

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.859 
to point out he does anything correctly
but<00:02:08.220> what<00:02:08.550> he<00:02:08.700> does<00:02:08.910> a<00:02:08.940> lot<00:02:09.239> of<00:02:09.300> other<00:02:09.450> drummers

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
but what he does a lot of other drummers

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.720 
but what he does a lot of other drummers
don't<00:02:10.140> quite<00:02:10.410> get<00:02:10.590> about<00:02:10.860> that<00:02:11.069> is<00:02:11.220> you<00:02:11.640> have

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
don't quite get about that is you have

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.580 
don't quite get about that is you have
to<00:02:11.850> focus<00:02:12.030> on<00:02:12.330> the<00:02:12.420> fact<00:02:12.630> that<00:02:12.750> beat<00:02:13.019> three<00:02:13.380> is

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
to focus on the fact that beat three is

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.830 
to focus on the fact that beat three is
the<00:02:13.800> principle<00:02:14.519> note<00:02:14.760> any<00:02:15.390> time<00:02:15.660> you're

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
the principle note any time you're

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.500 
the principle note any time you're
playing<00:02:15.989> a<00:02:16.200> flam<00:02:16.500> or<00:02:16.709> a<00:02:16.739> rough<00:02:17.209> or<00:02:18.209> anything

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
playing a flam or a rough or anything

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:19.070 
playing a flam or a rough or anything
like<00:02:18.780> that

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
like that

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.960 
like that
everything<00:02:19.890> that<00:02:19.920> precedes<00:02:20.489> it<00:02:20.610> is<00:02:20.730> just

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
everything that precedes it is just

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.690 
everything that precedes it is just
ornamentation<00:02:21.780> that<00:02:22.319> the<00:02:22.830> primary<00:02:23.190> note<00:02:23.549> the

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
ornamentation that the primary note the

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.270 
ornamentation that the primary note the
principal<00:02:24.120> note<00:02:24.269> must<00:02:24.750> speak<00:02:25.049> louder<00:02:25.410> so<00:02:26.040> the

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
principal note must speak louder so the

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.229 
principal note must speak louder so the
flam<00:02:27.890> needs<00:02:28.890> to<00:02:29.040> speak<00:02:29.310> where<00:02:29.519> the<00:02:29.670> right<00:02:29.880> hand

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
flam needs to speak where the right hand

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:32.870 
flam needs to speak where the right hand
is<00:02:30.390> softer<00:02:30.870> than<00:02:30.900> the<00:02:31.170> left<00:02:31.380> and<00:02:31.620> that<00:02:32.340> foot<00:02:32.700> is

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
is softer than the left and that foot is

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.539 
is softer than the left and that foot is
also<00:02:33.299> about<00:02:33.810> the<00:02:33.959> same<00:02:34.110> volume<00:02:34.410> as<00:02:34.680> the<00:02:35.100> four

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:35.549 
also about the same volume as the four

but<00:03:43.830> other<00:03:44.160> times<00:03:44.489> we<00:03:45.060> plays<00:03:45.420> it<00:03:45.599> slower<00:03:45.930> I<00:03:46.290> can

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
but other times we plays it slower I can

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:48.080 
but other times we plays it slower I can
tell<00:03:46.830> you<00:03:46.950> is<00:03:47.010> clearly<00:03:47.250> not<00:03:47.430> trying<00:03:47.790> to<00:03:47.849> play<00:03:48.060> a

four-stroke<00:03:50.040> ruff<00:03:53.239> we're<00:03:54.239> going<00:03:54.360> try<00:03:54.510> to

00:03:54.559 --> 00:03:54.569 
four-stroke ruff we're going try to

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:56.600 
four-stroke ruff we're going try to
crush<00:03:55.170> those<00:03:55.379> in<00:03:55.620> right<00:03:55.980> before<00:03:56.129> we<00:03:56.370> get<00:03:56.459> to

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:56.610 
crush those in right before we get to

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:01.490 
crush those in right before we get to
that<00:03:56.640> down<00:03:57.000> so<00:03:58.129> try<00:03:59.129> the<00:03:59.190> the<00:03:59.970> to<00:04:00.330> show<00:04:00.510> pro<00:04:00.780> or

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
that down so try the the to show pro or

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.470 
that down so try the the to show pro or
the<00:04:01.560> I<00:04:01.769> guess<00:04:01.950> three<00:04:02.430> stroke<00:04:02.670> rocket<00:04:03.030> that

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
the I guess three stroke rocket that

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.180 
the I guess three stroke rocket that
there<00:04:03.690> are<00:04:03.810> three<00:04:04.080> notes<00:04:04.290> in<00:04:04.590> front<00:04:05.069> of<00:04:05.129> the

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
there are three notes in front of the

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.210 
there are three notes in front of the
principal<00:04:06.319> and<00:04:07.319> I<00:04:07.500> think<00:04:07.709> of<00:04:07.799> it<00:04:07.830> as<00:04:07.950> four

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
principal and I think of it as four

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.640 
principal and I think of it as four
strokes<00:04:08.610> so<00:04:09.000> you<00:04:09.480> got<00:04:09.660> you've<00:04:09.900> got<00:04:09.930> the<00:04:10.080> four

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
strokes so you got you've got the four

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.080 
strokes so you got you've got the four
stroke<00:04:10.920> version<00:04:11.340> with<00:04:11.459> it<00:04:11.640> which<00:04:11.760> has<00:04:11.940> the

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
stroke version with it which has the

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:13.460 
stroke version with it which has the
double<00:04:12.390> on<00:04:12.510> the<00:04:12.599> base<00:04:12.780> or<00:04:13.079> you<00:04:13.200> play<00:04:13.410> the

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
double on the base or you play the

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.520 
double on the base or you play the
single<00:04:13.769> on<00:04:14.040> the<00:04:14.069> bass<00:04:14.310> drum<00:04:14.690> that<00:04:15.690> link<00:04:16.290> works

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
single on the bass drum that link works

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:18.920 
single on the bass drum that link works
great<00:04:16.950> to<00:04:17.130> solo<00:04:17.430> with<00:04:17.700> it<00:04:18.209> also<00:04:18.479> works<00:04:18.840> great

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
great to solo with it also works great
