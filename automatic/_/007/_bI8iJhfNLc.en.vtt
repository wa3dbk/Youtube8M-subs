stinks because I am gonna be putting up
actually<00:00:25.050> another<00:00:25.380> redstone<00:00:25.619> challenge

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
actually another redstone challenge

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.740 
actually another redstone challenge
video<00:00:26.220> right<00:00:26.460> after<00:00:26.609> this<00:00:26.910> one<00:00:27.180> and<00:00:27.390> I<00:00:27.720> have

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
video right after this one and I have

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.089 
video right after this one and I have
that<00:00:28.080> guy's<00:00:28.289> message<00:00:28.619> there<00:00:28.769> so<00:00:28.859> I<00:00:28.890> kind<00:00:29.070> of

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
that guy's message there so I kind of

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.529 
that guy's message there so I kind of
feel<00:00:29.189> bad<00:00:29.340> for<00:00:29.460> him<00:00:29.580> so<00:00:29.849> if<00:00:29.970> you<00:00:30.090> are<00:00:30.269> the<00:00:30.420> one

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
feel bad for him so if you are the one

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.209 
feel bad for him so if you are the one
who<00:00:30.630> told<00:00:30.840> me<00:00:30.960> to<00:00:31.140> build<00:00:31.320> this<00:00:31.500> pretty<00:00:32.130> much

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
who told me to build this pretty much

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:33.770 
who told me to build this pretty much
don't<00:00:32.369> have<00:00:32.430> to<00:00:32.579> tell<00:00:32.730> me<00:00:32.850> in<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.030> inbox<00:00:33.510> I

don't have to tell me in the inbox I
mean<00:00:34.079> in<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.320> comment<00:00:34.620> section<00:00:34.800> below

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
mean in the comment section below

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.110 
mean in the comment section below
because<00:00:35.040> I'm<00:00:35.309> sure<00:00:35.460> a<00:00:35.489> lot<00:00:35.640> of<00:00:35.700> people<00:00:35.820> will<00:00:36.030> be

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
because I'm sure a lot of people will be

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.340 
because I'm sure a lot of people will be
like<00:00:36.270> oh<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.510> one<00:00:36.630> who<00:00:36.660> told<00:00:36.840> you<00:00:37.020> even<00:00:37.260> though

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
like oh the one who told you even though

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.049 
like oh the one who told you even though
they<00:00:37.469> weren't<00:00:37.800> but<00:00:38.219> I<00:00:38.280> am<00:00:38.489> very<00:00:38.670> sorry<00:00:38.910> I

doors<00:00:45.000> let's<00:00:45.239> see<00:00:45.360> what<00:00:45.510> this<00:00:45.660> thing<00:00:45.840> does<00:00:45.989> so

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
doors let's see what this thing does so

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.990 
doors let's see what this thing does so
we<00:00:46.230> click<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.739> button<00:00:49.039> it<00:00:50.039> opens<00:00:50.489> up<00:00:50.670> we<00:00:50.879> can

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
we click the button it opens up we can

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.400 
we click the button it opens up we can
go<00:00:51.090> inside<00:00:51.300> magic<00:00:51.750> so<00:00:51.870> you<00:00:51.960> can't<00:00:52.199> see

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
go inside magic so you can't see

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.619 
go inside magic so you can't see
anything<00:00:52.739> and<00:00:53.160> if<00:00:53.520> I<00:00:53.640> color<00:00:53.910> like<00:00:54.120> I<00:00:54.329> can<00:00:54.539> click

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
anything and if I color like I can click

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:55.850 
anything and if I color like I can click
this<00:00:54.809> button<00:00:54.870> in<00:00:55.140> here<00:00:55.289> and<00:00:55.469> it<00:00:55.530> will<00:00:55.649> close

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
this button in here and it will close

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.790 
this button in here and it will close
behind<00:00:56.219> us<00:00:57.199> and<00:00:58.199> as<00:00:58.350> you<00:00:58.440> can<00:00:58.500> see<00:00:58.559> it's

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
behind us and as you can see it's

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.189 
behind us and as you can see it's
completely<00:00:59.010> flushed<00:00:59.879> to<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.090> wall<00:01:00.390> so<00:01:01.079> we

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
completely flushed to the wall so we

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.540 
completely flushed to the wall so we
click<00:01:01.469> it<00:01:01.590> again<00:01:01.680> and<00:01:01.800> it<00:01:01.949> keeps<00:01:02.190> opening<00:01:02.430> it

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
click it again and it keeps opening it

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.939 
click it again and it keeps opening it
now<00:01:03.030> there<00:01:03.180> is<00:01:03.329> no<00:01:03.539> T<00:01:03.780> flip-flop<00:01:03.989> action<00:01:04.650> here

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
now there is no T flip-flop action here

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.530 
now there is no T flip-flop action here
or<00:01:04.979> anything<00:01:05.189> is<00:01:05.430> completely<00:01:05.909> monostable

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
or anything is completely monostable

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.929 
or anything is completely monostable
circuitry<00:01:07.470> I<00:01:07.680> think<00:01:08.310> I<00:01:08.340> used<00:01:08.520> about<00:01:08.640> four

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
circuitry I think I used about four

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.310 
circuitry I think I used about four
monostable<00:01:09.330> circuits<00:01:09.810> in<00:01:09.900> this<00:01:10.049> section

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
monostable circuits in this section

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.330 
monostable circuits in this section
let's<00:01:10.439> just<00:01:10.560> count<00:01:10.680> it<00:01:10.830> real<00:01:10.950> quick<00:01:11.100> we<00:01:11.220> got

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
let's just count it real quick we got

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.550 
let's just count it real quick we got
one<00:01:11.460> right<00:01:11.580> here<00:01:11.880> one<00:01:12.630> right<00:01:12.659> here<00:01:12.990> that's<00:01:13.290> two

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
one right here one right here that's two

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.950 
one right here one right here that's two
one<00:01:14.520> right<00:01:14.640> here<00:01:14.760> that's<00:01:14.939> three<00:01:15.270> and<00:01:15.299> one<00:01:15.810> down

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
one right here that's three and one down

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.690 
one right here that's three and one down
here<00:01:16.140> that<00:01:16.170> yep<00:01:16.470> that<00:01:16.680> is<00:01:16.799> four<00:01:17.040> completely

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
here that yep that is four completely

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.039 
here that yep that is four completely
run<00:01:17.909> Dom<00:01:18.090> Mountain<00:01:18.420> SEPA<00:01:18.600> circuit<00:01:18.840> so<00:01:18.900> it's

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
run Dom Mountain SEPA circuit so it's

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.260 
run Dom Mountain SEPA circuit so it's
completely<00:01:19.200> pulse<00:01:19.650> generated<00:01:20.130> there<00:01:20.610> is<00:01:20.820> no<00:01:21.060> T

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
completely pulse generated there is no T

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.550 
completely pulse generated there is no T
flip-flop<00:01:21.450> whatever<00:01:22.020> all<00:01:22.259> that<00:01:22.290> good<00:01:22.530> stuff

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
flip-flop whatever all that good stuff

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.800 
flip-flop whatever all that good stuff
in<00:01:22.920> there<00:01:23.220> so<00:01:23.909> pretty<00:01:24.060> much<00:01:24.180> all<00:01:24.390> that<00:01:24.450> it<00:01:24.659> did

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
in there so pretty much all that it did

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.810 
in there so pretty much all that it did
was<00:01:25.020> pretty<00:01:25.200> much<00:01:25.350> take<00:01:25.530> a<00:01:25.560> Jeb<00:01:25.979> door<00:01:26.250> and<00:01:26.759> I

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
was pretty much take a Jeb door and I

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.160 
was pretty much take a Jeb door and I
made<00:01:27.030> a<00:01:27.060> double<00:01:27.450> extent<00:01:27.750> I<00:01:27.810> mean<00:01:27.930> a<00:01:27.960> double

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
made a double extent I mean a double

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.190 
made a double extent I mean a double
extending<00:01:28.770> Jeb<00:01:29.130> door<00:01:29.400> that<00:01:29.939> is<00:01:30.390> seamless<00:01:30.869> and

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
extending Jeb door that is seamless and

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.020 
extending Jeb door that is seamless and
flush<00:01:31.439> and<00:01:31.680> right<00:01:32.250> up<00:01:32.340> here<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.729> reason<00:01:32.939> why

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
flush and right up here the reason why

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.429 
flush and right up here the reason why
it<00:01:33.090> lets<00:01:33.299> go<00:01:33.450> those<00:01:33.659> blocks<00:01:33.900> is<00:01:34.049> due<00:01:34.200> to<00:01:34.350> this

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
it lets go those blocks is due to this

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.380 
it lets go those blocks is due to this
monostable<00:01:34.860> circuit<00:01:35.340> right<00:01:35.490> up<00:01:35.579> here<00:01:35.850> that

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
monostable circuit right up here that

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.789 
monostable circuit right up here that
goes<00:01:36.540> into<00:01:36.720> this<00:01:36.930> stuffs<00:01:37.229> right<00:01:37.350> here<00:01:37.530> thus

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
goes into this stuffs right here thus

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:38.960 
goes into this stuffs right here thus
letting<00:01:38.040> go<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:38.310> blocks<00:01:38.520> and<00:01:38.700> then<00:01:38.790> I<00:01:38.820> have

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
letting go the blocks and then I have

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.910 
letting go the blocks and then I have
another<00:01:39.060> monostable<00:01:39.720> circuits<00:01:40.320> these<00:01:40.710> two

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
another monostable circuits these two

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.770 
another monostable circuits these two
right<00:01:41.130> here<00:01:41.159> that<00:01:41.850> let<00:01:42.060> go<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.329> blocks<00:01:42.570> for

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
right here that let go the blocks for

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.960 
right here that let go the blocks for
the<00:01:42.869> bottom<00:01:43.200> ones<00:01:43.409> as<00:01:43.590> well<00:01:44.189> and<00:01:44.460> that's<00:01:44.729> why

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
the bottom ones as well and that's why

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.310 
the bottom ones as well and that's why
the<00:01:45.030> reason<00:01:45.390> why<00:01:45.479> these<00:01:45.540> two<00:01:45.930> don't<00:01:46.079> mess

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
the reason why these two don't mess

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.649 
the reason why these two don't mess
around<00:01:46.470> with<00:01:46.770> this<00:01:47.189> right<00:01:48.119> here<00:01:48.149> because<00:01:48.360> when

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
around with this right here because when

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.080 
around with this right here because when
the<00:01:48.780> Pistons<00:01:49.380> are<00:01:49.500> extended<00:01:50.009> out<00:01:50.189> this<00:01:50.909> will

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
the Pistons are extended out this will

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.030 
the Pistons are extended out this will
stay<00:01:51.540> retracted<00:01:52.079> down<00:01:52.229> so<00:01:52.439> it<00:01:52.560> won't<00:01:52.680> mess<00:01:52.920> up

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
stay retracted down so it won't mess up

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.859 
stay retracted down so it won't mess up
anything<00:01:53.430> but<00:01:54.060> pretty<00:01:54.420> much<00:01:54.570> this<00:01:54.810> whole

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
anything but pretty much this whole

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.139 
anything but pretty much this whole
thing<00:01:55.380> can<00:01:55.799> be<00:01:55.860> ruined<00:01:56.280> by<00:01:56.430> pretty<00:01:56.880> much<00:01:57.000> just

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
thing can be ruined by pretty much just

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.600 
thing can be ruined by pretty much just
one<00:01:57.450> tick<00:01:57.780> off<00:01:58.020> on<00:01:58.320> anything<00:01:59.100> pretty<00:01:59.340> much<00:01:59.369> see

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
one tick off on anything pretty much see

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.459 
one tick off on anything pretty much see
like<00:01:59.759> look<00:01:59.909> if<00:02:00.000> I<00:02:00.090> put<00:02:00.240> one<00:02:00.570> take<00:02:00.840> more<00:02:01.110> on<00:02:01.259> this

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
like look if I put one take more on this

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.679 
like look if I put one take more on this
right<00:02:01.680> here<00:02:01.890> it<00:02:02.460> will<00:02:02.579> completely<00:02:02.939> ruin<00:02:03.270> the

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
right here it will completely ruin the

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.980 
right here it will completely ruin the
left<00:02:03.899> hand<00:02:04.140> side

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.670 

sake<00:02:09.090> ruined<00:02:10.090> it<00:02:10.240> so<00:02:10.720> pretty<00:02:10.840> much<00:02:11.050> one<00:02:11.380> tick

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
sake ruined it so pretty much one tick

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.860 
sake ruined it so pretty much one tick
can<00:02:12.070> ruin<00:02:12.340> everything<00:02:12.640> on<00:02:13.210> this<00:02:13.360> thing<00:02:13.420> it<00:02:13.750> is

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
can ruin everything on this thing it is

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.200 
can ruin everything on this thing it is
a<00:02:13.900> very<00:02:14.320> sensitive<00:02:14.950> build<00:02:15.310> and<00:02:15.550> of<00:02:16.000> course

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.210 
a very sensitive build and of course

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:18.480 
a very sensitive build and of course
like<00:02:16.360> if<00:02:16.480> you<00:02:16.540> rent<00:02:16.990> keep<00:02:17.500> punching<00:02:18.190> the

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
like if you rent keep punching the

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:20.070 
like if you rent keep punching the
button<00:02:18.760> over<00:02:18.970> and<00:02:19.060> over<00:02:19.210> again<00:02:19.300> it<00:02:19.540> will<00:02:19.750> break

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
button over and over again it will break

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.230 
button over and over again it will break
it<00:02:20.350> it's<00:02:20.890> just<00:02:21.250> a<00:02:21.340> very<00:02:21.520> very<00:02:21.610> like<00:02:22.030> I<00:02:22.090> said

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:22.240 
it it's just a very very like I said

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.180 
it it's just a very very like I said
it's<00:02:22.360> a<00:02:22.390> very<00:02:22.420> sensitive<00:02:23.050> build<00:02:23.380> so<00:02:23.860> let's<00:02:24.040> put

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
it's a very sensitive build so let's put

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.180 
it's a very sensitive build so let's put
all<00:02:24.280> this<00:02:24.400> stuff<00:02:24.640> back<00:02:24.820> actually<00:02:25.890> the<00:02:26.890> sticky

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
all this stuff back actually the sticky

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.250 
all this stuff back actually the sticky
pistons<00:02:27.520> and<00:02:27.790> we're<00:02:28.000> going<00:02:28.150> to<00:02:28.210> need<00:02:28.390> less<00:02:28.960> and

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
pistons and we're going to need less and

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.140 
pistons and we're going to need less and
we're<00:02:29.500> going<00:02:29.680> to<00:02:29.710> need<00:02:29.860> white<00:02:30.100> glue<00:02:30.340> so<00:02:30.970> let's

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
we're going to need white glue so let's

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.910 
we're going to need white glue so let's
fix<00:02:31.360> this<00:02:31.570> all<00:02:31.780> up<00:02:32.520> there<00:02:33.520> but<00:02:34.150> that<00:02:34.180> there

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
fix this all up there but that there

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.080 
fix this all up there but that there
there's<00:02:35.920> a<00:02:35.980> glass<00:02:36.160> out<00:02:36.400> right<00:02:36.580> now<00:02:36.640> yep<00:02:36.820> device

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
there's a glass out right now yep device

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.380 
there's a glass out right now yep device
is<00:02:37.240> out<00:02:38.370> there<00:02:39.370> we<00:02:39.430> got<00:02:39.760> delete<00:02:40.030> this<00:02:40.180> block

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
is out there we got delete this block

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.370 
is out there we got delete this block
that<00:02:40.720> back<00:02:42.570> and<00:02:43.570> there<00:02:43.959> we<00:02:44.020> go<00:02:44.110> it<00:02:44.170> should<00:02:44.230> be

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
that back and there we go it should be

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.590 
that back and there we go it should be
fixed<00:02:44.620> now<00:02:44.709> so<00:02:45.640> if<00:02:45.760> I<00:02:45.820> click<00:02:46.150> the<00:02:46.300> button<00:02:46.510> it

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
fixed now so if I click the button it

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.310 
fixed now so if I click the button it
should<00:02:46.690> be<00:02:46.780> fixed<00:02:48.480> well<00:02:49.480> yes<00:02:49.630> it<00:02:49.810> is<00:02:49.900> a<00:02:50.050> very

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320 
should be fixed well yes it is a very

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.140 
should be fixed well yes it is a very
very<00:02:50.980> sensitive<00:02:51.280> build<00:02:51.670> and<00:02:51.820> here's<00:02:51.970> the

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
very sensitive build and here's the

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:53.610 
very sensitive build and here's the
first<00:02:52.300> version<00:02:52.720> I<00:02:52.810> built<00:02:53.020> over<00:02:53.320> here<00:02:53.500> as<00:02:53.560> you

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
first version I built over here as you

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.940 
first version I built over here as you
can<00:02:53.740> see<00:02:53.830> it's<00:02:53.950> a<00:02:53.980> little<00:02:54.220> bit<00:02:54.370> yeah<00:02:55.739> it<00:02:56.739> works

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
can see it's a little bit yeah it works

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.949 
can see it's a little bit yeah it works
completely<00:02:57.220> fine<00:02:57.670> I<00:02:57.910> try<00:02:58.420> to<00:02:58.450> come<00:02:58.630> back<00:02:58.780> time

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
completely fine I try to come back time

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:00.030 
completely fine I try to come back time
probably<00:02:59.110> to<00:02:59.290> try<00:02:59.380> to<00:02:59.470> even<00:02:59.620> come<00:02:59.739> back<00:02:59.890> to

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
probably to try to even come back to

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.860 
probably to try to even come back to
more<00:03:00.310> than<00:03:00.550> that<00:03:00.790> as<00:03:01.300> you<00:03:01.390> can<00:03:01.480> see<00:03:01.600> it<00:03:01.690> works

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
more than that as you can see it works

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:03.540 
more than that as you can see it works
completely<00:03:02.200> fine<00:03:02.650> it's<00:03:02.800> a<00:03:02.830> little<00:03:03.160> bit<00:03:03.280> slower

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:03.550 
completely fine it's a little bit slower

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.130 
completely fine it's a little bit slower
because<00:03:03.820> I<00:03:03.910> did<00:03:04.090> use<00:03:04.239> old<00:03:04.510> or<00:03:04.690> monostable

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
because I did use old or monostable

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:06.990 
because I did use old or monostable
circuits<00:03:05.620> on<00:03:05.739> this<00:03:06.040> one<00:03:06.220> when<00:03:06.670> I<00:03:06.700> was<00:03:06.880> building

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
circuits on this one when I was building

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.250 
circuits on this one when I was building
it<00:03:07.270> just<00:03:07.300> to<00:03:07.480> make<00:03:07.600> sure<00:03:07.630> everything<00:03:08.050> worked

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
it just to make sure everything worked

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:09.630 
it just to make sure everything worked
fine<00:03:08.350> and<00:03:08.590> then<00:03:08.680> when<00:03:08.800> I<00:03:08.830> switch<00:03:09.160> them<00:03:09.340> out<00:03:09.459> for

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
fine and then when I switch them out for

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.330 
fine and then when I switch them out for
the<00:03:09.760> newer<00:03:09.910> ones<00:03:10.150> the<00:03:10.360> new<00:03:10.660> ones<00:03:10.840> do<00:03:11.110> have<00:03:11.260> a

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
the newer ones the new ones do have a

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.620 
the newer ones the new ones do have a
quicker<00:03:12.340> pulse<00:03:12.640> actually<00:03:12.820> for<00:03:13.239> some<00:03:13.360> reason

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
quicker pulse actually for some reason

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:14.970 
quicker pulse actually for some reason
it<00:03:13.900> just<00:03:13.959> feels<00:03:14.290> like<00:03:14.410> it<00:03:14.530> has<00:03:14.650> a<00:03:14.680> quicker

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
it just feels like it has a quicker

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.550 
it just feels like it has a quicker
pulse<00:03:15.340> cuz<00:03:15.610> see<00:03:15.730> how<00:03:15.790> it<00:03:16.150> feels<00:03:16.450> slower<00:03:16.660> it

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
pulse cuz see how it feels slower it

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.590 
pulse cuz see how it feels slower it
just<00:03:17.769> feels<00:03:17.920> like<00:03:18.040> a<00:03:18.100> like<00:03:18.489> a<00:03:18.519> tick<00:03:18.880> slower<00:03:19.120> on

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:19.600 
just feels like a like a tick slower on

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.500 
just feels like a like a tick slower on
this<00:03:19.810> side<00:03:20.050> but<00:03:20.860> this<00:03:21.010> build<00:03:21.220> is<00:03:21.459> a<00:03:21.640> 5<00:03:22.150> wide

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
this side but this build is a 5 wide

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.000 
this side but this build is a 5 wide
build<00:03:22.840> as<00:03:22.959> you<00:03:23.049> can<00:03:23.140> see<00:03:23.230> it's<00:03:23.350> 5<00:03:23.530> wide<00:03:23.799> and<00:03:23.950> I

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
build as you can see it's 5 wide and I

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.280 
build as you can see it's 5 wide and I
believe<00:03:24.220> it's<00:03:24.400> 12<00:03:24.880> long<00:03:25.209> and<00:03:25.480> when<00:03:26.110> you<00:03:26.170> have

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
believe it's 12 long and when you have

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:27.930 
believe it's 12 long and when you have
to<00:03:26.350> dig<00:03:26.560> down<00:03:26.680> you<00:03:26.830> only<00:03:27.040> have<00:03:27.220> to<00:03:27.310> dig<00:03:27.489> down<00:03:27.640> 3

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
to dig down you only have to dig down 3

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:29.610 
to dig down you only have to dig down 3
4<00:03:27.970> it's<00:03:28.360> not<00:03:28.630> that<00:03:28.840> bad<00:03:28.959> I'm<00:03:29.140> not<00:03:29.290> sure<00:03:29.440> if<00:03:29.500> I'm

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
4 it's not that bad I'm not sure if I'm

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.320 
4 it's not that bad I'm not sure if I'm
going<00:03:29.830> to<00:03:29.980> do<00:03:30.100> a<00:03:30.130> tutorial<00:03:30.370> on<00:03:30.790> it<00:03:30.910> I<00:03:31.060> can<00:03:31.299> I

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:31.330 
going to do a tutorial on it I can I

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.110 
going to do a tutorial on it I can I
know<00:03:31.510> how<00:03:31.810> to<00:03:31.870> build<00:03:32.080> this<00:03:32.700> 100%<00:03:33.700> by<00:03:33.850> heart

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
know how to build this 100% by heart

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.300 
know how to build this 100% by heart
already<00:03:34.540> and<00:03:34.989> these<00:03:35.350> lamps<00:03:35.920> right<00:03:35.980> here<00:03:36.130> are

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
already and these lamps right here are

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:38.400 
already and these lamps right here are
not<00:03:36.549> for<00:03:36.730> show<00:03:36.880> these<00:03:37.360> actually<00:03:37.750> do<00:03:37.930> update

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
not for show these actually do update

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:39.630 
not for show these actually do update
the<00:03:38.590> pistons<00:03:38.980> right<00:03:39.130> here<00:03:39.250> the<00:03:39.340> reason<00:03:39.430> why<00:03:39.610> I

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.640 
the pistons right here the reason why I

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.580 
the pistons right here the reason why I
used<00:03:39.880> lamps<00:03:40.390> here<00:03:40.540> is<00:03:40.720> because<00:03:41.230> when<00:03:41.380> I<00:03:41.410> had

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
used lamps here is because when I had

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:43.380 
used lamps here is because when I had
normal<00:03:41.950> blocks<00:03:42.160> here<00:03:42.370> it<00:03:42.519> was<00:03:42.640> ruining<00:03:43.090> the

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:43.390 
normal blocks here it was ruining the

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:44.610 
normal blocks here it was ruining the
bottom<00:03:43.720> Pistons<00:03:44.019> kind<00:03:44.200> of<00:03:44.260> like<00:03:44.380> with<00:03:44.500> the

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
bottom Pistons kind of like with the

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.170 
bottom Pistons kind of like with the
sliding<00:03:45.100> door<00:03:45.280> that<00:03:45.310> I<00:03:45.459> just<00:03:45.700> did<00:03:45.880> the<00:03:46.000> other

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
sliding door that I just did the other

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.210 
sliding door that I just did the other
day<00:03:46.450> how<00:03:46.870> the<00:03:46.959> bottom<00:03:47.410> sliding<00:03:47.739> Pistons<00:03:48.100> will

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
day how the bottom sliding Pistons will

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.850 
day how the bottom sliding Pistons will
get<00:03:48.370> ruined<00:03:48.640> if<00:03:48.940> there<00:03:49.150> was<00:03:49.330> a<00:03:49.530> not<00:03:50.530> a<00:03:50.560> half

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:50.860 
get ruined if there was a not a half

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:52.680 
get ruined if there was a not a half
slab<00:03:51.160> here<00:03:51.370> so<00:03:51.700> actually<00:03:51.970> had<00:03:52.060> to<00:03:52.120> use<00:03:52.150> lamps

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 
slab here so actually had to use lamps

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:54.750 
slab here so actually had to use lamps
to<00:03:52.780> update<00:03:53.260> the<00:03:53.380> top<00:03:53.590> piston<00:03:54.040> block<00:03:54.220> but<00:03:54.670> yeah

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
to update the top piston block but yeah

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.490 
to update the top piston block but yeah
guys<00:03:54.910> that's<00:03:55.090> pretty<00:03:55.239> much<00:03:55.600> it<00:03:55.810> if<00:03:56.350> you
