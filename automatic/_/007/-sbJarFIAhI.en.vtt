00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:05.400
 Is it one day God or something like that? 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:17.150
 There is no doubt that Suzumiya has the power to change this present 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:19.880
 But I don't think it will change the way the world works 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.360
 This world has been like this from the beginning 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:25.800
 That's it 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:29.599
 Koizumi is an opinion that is strongly opposed 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.599
 I think I also think of something different 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:37.410
 Is but I do not forget how bad a little draw play and tell you a thing 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:39.360
 Koizumi team 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.770
 me 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.840
 I do not do the Maru scene 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.870
 Yeah but there is a Luo misleading 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.870
 Yeah 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:51.210
 Explain that it is difficult to limit 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.590
 I understand 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:06.160
 One day is not a star of God's reason 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:06.160
 It is still easier for me to understand Asahina-san than Koizumi 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:16.660
 There is no place for the Red Seven Shiho Koizumi National Uniform 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.660
 Please understand that too 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:27.960
 It seems that the claim of black is this in the morning sun 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:34.950
 Suzumiya Haruhi did not create, but the world existed from a good line in this form 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:36.060
 Since the supernatural presence of such extraterrestrial life super powers and time the mobile concept has had originally there 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:41.820
 is there 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:43.120
 Suzumiya Haruhi's office is to discover them without awareness and people's ability is from 3 years ago 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.150
 Being exhibited 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:48.210
 However Do not be able to detect her world more 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:53.750
 I will never recognize it 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.750
 It is because it is here and it seems to open the democratic system 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.370
 That's us 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:00.700
 Ah ah ah 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:05.400
 Asahina has a different reason from Koizumi 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:12.000
 It is No. 2 that Haruhi finds a strange phenomenon 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:14.760
 She is an important somehow have come to this time in order to protect the 3 first space she is attributable 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:20.160
 I feel not like was said Sararito 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:26.500
 I do not appreciate if Asahina was for the noise to your each other off the opponent's interpretation 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:31.930
 Different splurge of theory for them is none other than the ones that shake the existence foundation of their 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:36.310
 Oh, Koizumi is a bird that supernatural powers stayed in my village year ago . 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:38.030
 It guarantees that things catcher missing a ball February is true am nowhere 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:44.330
 What 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:45.319
 Certainly Koizumi's theory with no guarantee gives a plausible commentary on the event I suffered 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.980
 It is only 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:50.460
 Who knows it is the correct answer 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:55.680
 Asahina 's reasoning is the same 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:57.680
 Who guarantees that Asahina version answers are correct 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.709
 What do you think 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:04.180
 You said before that which was the correct answer 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:09.219
 'S version of you in the end because the possibility of self-evolution 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:11.730
 What truth can I tell you that I can not get your confirmation 

00:03:09.219 --> 00:03:11.730
 Such 0 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.620
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:21.690
 There is no guarantee that my words are true 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:25.400
 There for you 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.560
 From 

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:39.160
 Do you usually understand 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:39.160
 I want to talk about clarity of really Nagatomo was Koizumi Panamax 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:52.960
 Kasuga thinks that filming is going well, and I and Koizumi and Asahina-san are gradually turning their faces 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:58.030
 Such a vertical line was supposed to be darker shadows 

00:03:52.960 --> 00:04:03.760
 What It is from the model gun it was supposed to as water hammer team comes out rather than a bb bullets 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:06.620
 Asahina-san, please send out a copy of something each time you bring a different color contact 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:10.610
 Chez had been bitten by a village convenience thing 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:16.829
 If you think that the cherry blossoms are in bloom, you will know the numbers later 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:21.620
 It seems that the white pigeons of the shrine had already become a travel pigeon that should have become extinct 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:21.620
 It seems that the precession of the earth was slightly shifted 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:31.330
 The highest price lowest of 10 at all 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.330
 No 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.680
 No 

00:04:37.719 --> 00:04:46.070
 I say even if the fine setting and foreshadowing for Sezumiya's 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:49.729
 You probably don't even think about falling 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:52.100
 N'ne might possibly end up in the unfinished 

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:57.880
 It will be troubled that 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:57.880
 It is the theory of the six who suffer when the world is fictionalized 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:10.460
 I would like to tell you the true story of having some theory centered on Mr. Suzumiya 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:13.390
 We did not just say the agency and Asahina-sama 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:16.480
 There are many 

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:21.249
 And the idea that we have a variety of doing under the surface 

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:24.609
 I would like to tell you in the digest of the Middle Middle's extermination war. 

00:05:21.249 --> 00:05:26.580
 Alliances and Betrayal Extravaganza 

00:05:24.609 --> 00:05:31.909
 Red and killed 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:31.909
 Each group is a survival battle with all power 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:39.240
 Well these things Hey I think that unrelated to you 

00:05:37.009 --> 00:05:41.030
 Or even to Suzumiya's 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:43.650
 Especially Suzumiya Sally 

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:47.960
 I want a not to know 

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:54.039
 I do not want to do things like annoy her mind 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:54.039
 Speaking of Nok's criteria, Mr. Suzumiya should bring out a lovable character 

00:05:54.830 --> 00:06:00.520
 Oh of course you too 

00:05:57.569 --> 00:06:02.600
 Why am I the Lord 

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:04.810
 My mouth slipped 

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:07.810
 There is no reason 

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:11.380
 It's a boring story 

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:14.550
 Not at all interesting, such certainly 

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:19.190
 One more thing for the boring story 

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:22.689
 Why is Asahina acting with me and you 

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:26.340
 Have you ever considered the reason 

00:06:22.689 --> 00:06:32.529
 Her role is to connect you 

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:36.249
 Because you are the only one who can tell Suzumiya what to say 

00:06:32.529 --> 00:06:41.379
 It 's best to get around you 

00:06:36.249 --> 00:06:44.449
 I would like to see only the cover that looks like a child and the overcoming difficulty of Mr. Suzumiya 

00:06:41.379 --> 00:06:48.440
 Poor standing position is also so 

00:06:44.449 --> 00:06:51.880
 Everything is to turn your eyes on you 

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:51.880
 I got tired of listening to the upper row 

00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:59.670
 I'm sorry 

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:03.009
 After all I 

00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:05.120
 I 'm lacking in the ability to keep the joke going 

00:07:03.009 --> 00:07:07.770
 It's a lie 

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:10.860
 I was serious 

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:15.500
 He and Haruhi's movie and class drama 

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:15.500
 Many pressures are pretty tough 

00:07:15.529 --> 00:07:23.590
 If I go out in a closed space, there is a fallen Nisei himself. 

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:26.770
 Because of that, I came to ask you 

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:29.700
 Suzumiya-san's movie is the source 

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:36.420
 You and do not get to stop this place upper limit number 

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:39.040
 Make Mr. himself aware of the fact that the contents of one day's movie are all troubles 

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:41.289
 Not clear, but it was 

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:45.360
 It is to be aware ne 

00:07:41.289 --> 00:07:45.360
 If possible before shooting is over 

00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:54.570
 Thank you 

00:07:57.289 --> 00:08:02.940
 What is it? 

00:07:59.110 --> 00:08:02.940
 Have you come under pressure on me ? 

00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:07.759
 Well but 

00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:14.080
 Is it okay to leave me alone ?
