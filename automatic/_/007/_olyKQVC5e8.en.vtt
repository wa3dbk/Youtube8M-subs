00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:11.000
 Ezreal, a fearless young adventurer, explored some of the most remote and abandoned areas of Runer 

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:19.120
 When Ezreal discovered the underground remains of Shurima; Probably designed for the wearing of one of the "Ascended" 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.880
 He found a talisman with a high degree of mystical power 

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:34.480
 The gigantic Talisman nevertheless sat comfortably on Ezreal's arm and increased Ezreal's pure magic abilities so much that Ezreal is known as a hero himself, as embarrassed as himself. 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:36.820
 This is Ezreal's story. 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:37.960
 So why ? 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.660
 Why is the story of such an old and important champion so short? 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.740
 Because it was recently changed a second time and this time it was clipped too much. 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:55.660
 My guess is that Riot Games is currently doing this because of the fact that I was hoping that it was temporary. 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:00.300
 Skarner, Ezreal and Rammus Shurima all the champions who were involved with. 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.360
 The story of Ezreal will probably be rearranged in the future, and then we'll re-catch the story. 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.580
 Let's take a look at the old story. 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:15.020
 When Ezreal was very young he was very clever and at the age of 8 he had an excellent map of Piltover's underground tunnels. 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.940
 The maps were so good that he bought and mapped Ezreal's maps. 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.800
 Later, the adventures of Ezreal were brought into a novel. 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:33.660
 One day Ezreal found that in Shurima there was a talisman designed for about twice the size of Ezreal, and when he examined it he realized that the magic of the talisman increased his magic. 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.540
 But the annoying aspect of the work was that the talisman was made more suitable for calling spells. 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:45.080
 This also meant that; Ezreal could have been called into an outlander and found himself as a champion without even realizing it. 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.520
 However, Ezreal considers calling the League of Legends a small price next to the talisman he has 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:58.180
 So the story of Ezreal may have changed as a result of LoL's new stories policy. 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:03.980
 If you watched Braum, Gnar, Reksai, Bard, such as the last of the champions did not write why they participate in the league 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:12.340
 Because the League and the Institute of War from the story to remove the concepts; They plan to make the game play as independent as possible with the story of the Universe 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.780
 Changes in this direction come quickly but without feeling too much 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.140
 Let's see what we're going to see. 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:28.420
 In the meantime, Riotcum warning, Talisman is not made by ascended heir 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.400
 You can tell your translator. 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.080
 See you, thanks for watching
