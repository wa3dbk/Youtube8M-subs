00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:51.250 
being a subject in my art I mean I

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.670

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:53.680 
started drawing from like five years ago

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.090 
started drawing from like five years ago
because<00:00:54.430> I<00:00:54.550> love<00:00:54.699> the<00:00:54.820> shape<00:00:55.059> and<00:00:55.300> the<00:00:55.360> color

because I love the shape and the color

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.880 
because I love the shape and the color
and<00:00:57.100> then<00:00:57.400> the<00:00:57.550> rest<00:00:57.760> is<00:00:57.910> sort<00:00:58.089> of<00:00:58.180> history<00:00:58.239> so

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
and then the rest is sort of history so

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.110 
and then the rest is sort of history so
using<00:00:59.890> them<00:01:00.010> as<00:01:00.100> a<00:01:00.129> traditional<00:01:00.700> work<00:01:00.820> five

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:01.120 
using them as a traditional work five

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:08.120 
using them as a traditional work five
years

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.709 

I<00:01:10.430> suppose<00:01:11.430> what<00:01:11.640> you<00:01:11.729> could<00:01:11.880> say<00:01:12.030> is<00:01:12.060> my<00:01:12.299> style

00:01:12.709 --> 00:01:12.719 
I suppose what you could say is my style

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:14.510 
I suppose what you could say is my style
is<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.079> way<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.350> paint's<00:01:13.710> applied<00:01:14.070> I<00:01:14.340> mean

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
is the way the paint's applied I mean

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.730 
is the way the paint's applied I mean
that's<00:01:14.670> quite<00:01:14.909> expressionistic<00:01:15.619> you<00:01:16.619> know

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
that's quite expressionistic you know

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.139 
that's quite expressionistic you know
you<00:01:16.799> could<00:01:17.100> see<00:01:17.310> these<00:01:17.490> as<00:01:17.729> almost<00:01:18.030> like

00:01:18.139 --> 00:01:18.149 
you could see these as almost like

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:20.990 
you could see these as almost like
Popeye<00:01:18.659> I<00:01:18.689> take<00:01:19.110> icons<00:01:19.590> and<00:01:19.799> you<00:01:20.039> know<00:01:20.369> use

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
Popeye I take icons and you know use

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.419 
Popeye I take icons and you know use
them<00:01:21.179> with<00:01:21.299> my<00:01:21.479> twist<00:01:21.899> and<00:01:22.200> to<00:01:22.950> be<00:01:23.070> honest<00:01:23.310> with

00:01:23.419 --> 00:01:23.429 
them with my twist and to be honest with

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:24.560 
them with my twist and to be honest with
me<00:01:23.549> it's<00:01:23.670> all<00:01:23.789> about<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:24.090> way<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.360> paint

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
me it's all about the way the paint

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.270 
me it's all about the way the paint
moves<00:01:24.869> I<00:01:25.049> mean<00:01:25.200> that's<00:01:25.350> something<00:01:25.590> that<00:01:25.979> just

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
moves I mean that's something that just

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.389 
moves I mean that's something that just
came<00:01:26.490> naturally<00:01:26.970> as<00:01:27.090> an<00:01:27.210> artist<00:01:27.630> and<00:01:28.220> so<00:01:29.220> it's

00:01:29.389 --> 00:01:29.399 
came naturally as an artist and so it's

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:30.859 
came naturally as an artist and so it's
more<00:01:29.640> about<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:30.030> way<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.240> paint<00:01:30.509> you<00:01:30.750> know

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
more about the way the paint you know

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.749 
more about the way the paint you know
sort<00:01:31.170> of<00:01:31.200> performs<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:31.890> way<00:01:32.009> it's<00:01:32.159> flattening

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
sort of performs the way it's flattening

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.090 
sort of performs the way it's flattening
that<00:01:32.939> my<00:01:33.119> signature<00:01:33.630> style<00:01:33.689> er<00:01:34.170> I<00:01:34.409> can't

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
that my signature style er I can't

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
explain to you how or why that's just as

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.539 
explain to you how or why that's just as
soon<00:01:37.439> as<00:01:37.530> I<00:01:37.619> picked<00:01:37.829> up<00:01:37.920> paint<00:01:38.189> that's<00:01:38.369> what

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
soon as I picked up paint that's what

soon as I picked up paint that's what
happened

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:47.439 

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:50.590 

and<00:01:48.439> I<00:01:48.950> mean<00:01:49.130> with<00:01:49.789> every<00:01:50.030> subject<00:01:50.450> matter

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
unlike you especially with these works I

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.670 
unlike you especially with these works I
mean<00:01:52.549> I'll<00:01:52.820> study<00:01:53.299> it<00:01:53.479> for<00:01:53.630> a<00:01:53.689> while<00:01:53.930> you<00:01:54.649> know

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:54.680 
mean I'll study it for a while you know

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.310 
mean I'll study it for a while you know
I'll<00:01:54.890> do<00:01:55.070> like<00:01:55.250> a<00:01:55.280> very<00:01:55.579> detailed<00:01:56.450> quick<00:01:57.140> on

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320 
I'll do like a very detailed quick on

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.050 
I'll do like a very detailed quick on
the<00:01:57.500> sketch<00:01:57.770> to<00:01:58.009> get<00:01:58.159> the<00:01:58.310> shape<00:01:58.520> in<00:01:58.700> the<00:01:58.820> form

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
the sketch to get the shape in the form

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.209 
the sketch to get the shape in the form
then<00:01:59.840> obviously<00:01:59.990> colors<00:02:00.590> start<00:02:00.829> to<00:02:00.890> get<00:02:01.070> and

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:01.219 
then obviously colors start to get and

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:04.450 
then obviously colors start to get and
applied<00:02:01.520> and<00:02:01.939> then<00:02:02.299> the<00:02:02.509> actual<00:02:03.460> spontaneous

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 
applied and then the actual spontaneous

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:05.679 
applied and then the actual spontaneous
way<00:02:04.610> that<00:02:04.819> the<00:02:04.909> page<00:02:05.119> sort<00:02:05.450> of<00:02:05.539> you<00:02:05.659> know

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:05.689 
way that the page sort of you know

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:09.070 
way that the page sort of you know
applied<00:02:06.079> later<00:02:06.470> on<00:02:06.619> is<00:02:06.740> very<00:02:06.920> very<00:02:07.130> quick<00:02:07.840> so<00:02:08.840> I

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
applied later on is very very quick so I

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.870 
applied later on is very very quick so I
suppose<00:02:09.590> what<00:02:09.830> it's<00:02:09.979> all<00:02:10.130> about<00:02:10.160> really<00:02:10.670> is

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:10.880 
suppose what it's all about really is

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.670 
suppose what it's all about really is
trying<00:02:11.150> to<00:02:11.239> get<00:02:11.360> something<00:02:11.870> that's<00:02:12.019> instantly

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
trying to get something that's instantly

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.000 
trying to get something that's instantly
recognizable<00:02:13.610> with<00:02:14.450> my<00:02:14.900> twist<00:02:15.349> on<00:02:15.560> it<00:02:15.709> sort<00:02:15.950> of

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
recognizable with my twist on it sort of

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.259 
recognizable with my twist on it sort of
thing<00:02:16.220> so<00:02:16.250> it's<00:02:16.580> something<00:02:16.760> looks<00:02:17.060> very

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:17.269 
thing so it's something looks very

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:19.630 
thing so it's something looks very
spontaneous<00:02:18.140> and<00:02:18.410> place<00:02:19.010> is<00:02:19.190> very<00:02:19.400> accurate

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
spontaneous and place is very accurate

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.580 
spontaneous and place is very accurate
