I've<00:01:36.460> die-cut<00:01:37.000> and<00:01:37.150> I<00:01:37.300> decided<00:01:37.720> that<00:01:37.870> one<00:01:38.170> of

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
I've die-cut and I decided that one of

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.810 
I've die-cut and I decided that one of
them<00:01:38.440> would<00:01:38.590> be<00:01:38.650> flush<00:01:39.010> mounted<00:01:39.400> to<00:01:39.520> the<00:01:39.550> card

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:39.820 
them would be flush mounted to the card

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.400 
them would be flush mounted to the card
base<00:01:40.000> and<00:01:40.330> the<00:01:40.570> other<00:01:40.720> to<00:01:40.900> us<00:01:41.050> going<00:01:41.230> to<00:01:41.320> go

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:41.410 
base and the other to us going to go

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:42.810 
base and the other to us going to go
ahead<00:01:41.500> and<00:01:41.830> pop<00:01:42.070> up<00:01:42.280> so<00:01:42.460> I'm<00:01:42.520> just<00:01:42.640> going<00:01:42.760> to

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 
ahead and pop up so I'm just going to

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.300 
ahead and pop up so I'm just going to
play<00:01:43.060> a<00:01:43.090> little<00:01:43.270> bit<00:01:43.540> with<00:01:44.260> the<00:01:44.410> placement<00:01:44.680> and

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
play a little bit with the placement and

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.670 
play a little bit with the placement and
then<00:01:45.610> because<00:01:46.360> I<00:01:46.390> can<00:01:46.660> never<00:01:46.870> remember<00:01:47.140> how<00:01:47.650> I

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:47.680 
then because I can never remember how I

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.770 
then because I can never remember how I
had<00:01:48.040> it<00:01:48.250> I<00:01:48.430> like<00:01:48.880> to<00:01:48.970> take<00:01:49.090> a<00:01:49.150> picture<00:01:49.480> with<00:01:49.510> my

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780 
had it I like to take a picture with my

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.510 
had it I like to take a picture with my
cell<00:01:49.810> phone<00:01:50.020> and<00:01:50.500> then<00:01:50.650> I<00:01:50.770> can<00:01:50.950> use<00:01:51.160> it<00:01:51.370> as<00:01:51.490> a

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
cell phone and then I can use it as a

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.460 
cell phone and then I can use it as a
guide<00:01:51.820> map<00:01:52.120> when<00:01:52.480> I'm<00:01:52.630> putting<00:01:53.350> everything

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:53.470 
guide map when I'm putting everything

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:55.140 
guide map when I'm putting everything
and<00:01:53.950> gluing<00:01:54.220> everything<00:01:54.340> down<00:01:54.730> into<00:01:55.000> place

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:55.150 
and gluing everything down into place

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.390 
and gluing everything down into place
permanently<00:01:55.510> and<00:01:56.050> call<00:01:56.770> me<00:01:56.890> a<00:01:56.920> glutton<00:01:57.250> for

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:57.400 
permanently and call me a glutton for

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.850 
permanently and call me a glutton for
punishment<00:01:57.540> you<00:01:58.540> could<00:01:58.750> draw<00:01:59.110> the<00:01:59.170> balloon

00:01:59.850 --> 00:01:59.860 
punishment you could draw the balloon

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:01.140 
punishment you could draw the balloon
strings<00:02:00.250> but<00:02:00.460> I<00:02:00.520> just<00:02:00.820> thought<00:02:00.910> it<00:02:01.030> would<00:02:01.090> be

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:01.150 
strings but I just thought it would be

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:04.620 
strings but I just thought it would be
really<00:02:01.510> fun<00:02:01.690> and<00:02:02.290> an<00:02:02.410> extra<00:02:02.890> special<00:02:03.220> touch<00:02:03.630> to

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
really fun and an extra special touch to

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.840 
really fun and an extra special touch to
take<00:02:04.840> twine<00:02:05.140> and<00:02:05.170> tie<00:02:06.040> that<00:02:06.220> around<00:02:06.280> the<00:02:06.670> ends

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
take twine and tie that around the ends

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:08.550 
take twine and tie that around the ends
of<00:02:07.060> the<00:02:07.150> balloons<00:02:07.450> and

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
of the balloons and

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.290 
of the balloons and
have<00:02:08.979> those<00:02:09.130> streaming<00:02:09.550> down<00:02:09.759> the<00:02:09.940> card<00:02:10.149> front

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.300 
have those streaming down the card front

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.690 
have those streaming down the card front
so<00:02:10.599> I'm<00:02:10.690> going<00:02:10.720> to<00:02:10.899> go<00:02:10.989> ahead<00:02:11.110> and<00:02:11.370> flush<00:02:12.370> mount

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
so I'm going to go ahead and flush mount

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.080 
so I'm going to go ahead and flush mount
the<00:02:13.480> balloon<00:02:13.810> that's<00:02:13.989> going<00:02:14.110> to<00:02:14.200> be<00:02:14.319> in<00:02:14.500> the

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
the balloon that's going to be in the

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
the balloon that's going to be in the
farthest<00:02:16.090> part<00:02:16.270> of<00:02:16.390> the<00:02:16.450> background<00:02:16.930> there

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
farthest part of the background there

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:18.510 
farthest part of the background there
and<00:02:17.260> it's<00:02:17.349> up<00:02:17.470> towards<00:02:17.800> the<00:02:17.860> top<00:02:17.950> so<00:02:18.310> I'm<00:02:18.370> going

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
and it's up towards the top so I'm going

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.190 
and it's up towards the top so I'm going
to<00:02:18.550> go<00:02:18.670> ahead<00:02:18.700> and<00:02:18.880> let<00:02:19.120> it<00:02:19.150> hang<00:02:19.480> off<00:02:19.750> the<00:02:19.780> edge

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
to go ahead and let it hang off the edge

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.350 
to go ahead and let it hang off the edge
there<00:02:21.130> and<00:02:21.430> that's<00:02:21.550> okay<00:02:21.760> because<00:02:21.910> we'll<00:02:22.150> trim

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
there and that's okay because we'll trim

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.790 
there and that's okay because we'll trim
it<00:02:22.450> off<00:02:22.540> later<00:02:22.750> go<00:02:23.410> ahead<00:02:23.590> and<00:02:23.680> get<00:02:23.739> that

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
it off later go ahead and get that

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.430 
it off later go ahead and get that
mounted<00:02:24.430> and<00:02:24.700> then<00:02:25.060> I<00:02:25.090> can<00:02:25.480> go<00:02:25.599> ahead<00:02:25.690> and<00:02:25.840> 3d

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
mounted and then I can go ahead and 3d

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.620 
mounted and then I can go ahead and 3d
mount<00:02:26.650> the<00:02:27.220> other<00:02:27.400> balloons<00:02:27.819> over<00:02:28.090> the<00:02:28.360> top

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
mount the other balloons over the top

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.509 
mount the other balloons over the top
and<00:02:29.050> then<00:02:29.530> we<00:02:29.650> got<00:02:29.800> to<00:02:29.890> keep<00:02:30.010> those<00:02:30.220> little

and then we got to keep those little

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:32.940 
and then we got to keep those little
tails<00:02:31.269> out<00:02:31.569> of<00:02:31.660> the<00:02:31.840> way<00:02:31.989> they're<00:02:32.260> kind<00:02:32.890> of

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
tails out of the way they're kind of

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:34.440 
tails out of the way they're kind of
have<00:02:33.099> one<00:02:33.340> going<00:02:33.640> at<00:02:33.760> a<00:02:33.790> little<00:02:34.180> bit<00:02:34.269> of<00:02:34.360> an

have one going at a little bit of an

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.479 
have one going at a little bit of an
angle<00:02:34.660> there<00:02:35.080> and<00:02:35.440> they'll<00:02:35.800> just<00:02:35.830> trim<00:02:36.310> that

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:36.489 
angle there and they'll just trim that

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:39.150 
angle there and they'll just trim that
off<00:02:36.730> and<00:02:37.239> then<00:02:37.420> when<00:02:37.630> I<00:02:37.660> flip<00:02:38.050> it<00:02:38.170> back<00:02:38.319> over<00:02:38.380> I
