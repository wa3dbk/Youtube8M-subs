00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:06.649
 this is the most complete and gigantic 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.570
 book of the story of the wonder bones 

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:13.710

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.300
 read and highlight 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.849
 reading and highlighting is the basis of any 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.890
 good study method allows the 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:30.259
 student deepen and concentrate on the most 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:33.260
 important separating the good from the bad 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:37.449
 the wheat of the straw going to the essence 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.449
 of all knowing what you have up to now 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:45.170
 highlighting the whole thing does not really 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:48.470
 stop the wheat from the straw 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:52.420
 from the good to the bad 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:52.420
 Hey, I'm not that tall 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.390
 and good rainbow I see that read and highlight 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:01.630
 is not your style of study so 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:04.020
 let's pass the approved method collection of 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:04.020

 Now make yourself comfortable and live 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.950
 the magic of learning 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:29.150
 prior to the separation between heavenly and 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.520
 moon there was no need for the guard 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.000
 terrestrial unicorn and pegasus or guard 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.610
 TV 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.670
 but when waking the moon they were created 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.830
 the protective squads put in the 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.300

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:44.300
 peace there was a celebration

 to commemorate the special occasion the 

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:57.640
 first performance had so much energy 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:59.890
 So much enthusiasm that I saw rays 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.560
 magical about the crowd and all 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:05.020

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.409

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.900

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:15.050
 very mudas you can repeat something of my 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.050
 choice

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.500
 rhythm 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.790
 pretend 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.540
 let's move on to my favorite style of 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.540
 learning 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.540
 sacred 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:59.099
 means that I will briefly learn that 

00:02:56.379 --> 00:02:59.099
 It is what I hope 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:04.330
 the leader of the von de bolsa in the 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:09.069
 fourth heavenly era was known by 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:14.310
 its that you did not see what happened 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:14.310
 and I was enthralled with your chips 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.049
 after becoming the squadron 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:24.140
 official flight of the heavenly princess 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:24.140

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:29.300
 the original grace badge of the 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:32.750

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:36.470

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:39.670
 blowgun seriously a role in the eye not 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.670
 It's a matter of laughter 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:44.610
 if you can be playing like that obviously 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:47.549
 you are ready for the exam 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:49.710
 obviously good then you're also 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:55.650
 ready for 

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:59.700
 a test on the initials of upi 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:02.010

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:04.830

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:16.190
 general sugar donut glass 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:23.340
 well I looked like that or that you did not have 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:27.210
 a correct answer 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:31.120
 but I do not know it never listens to answers 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:34.449
 so bad and related to food 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:36.760
 if you had done the official exam today 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:39.930
 my dream of being in the reserve 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:39.930
