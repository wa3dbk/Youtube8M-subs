powered<00:00:06.750> cars<00:00:07.280> these<00:00:08.280> are<00:00:08.429> actually<00:00:08.730> balloons

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:09.650 
powered cars these are actually balloons

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:16.430 
powered cars these are actually balloons
this<00:00:10.650> one<00:00:10.950> was<00:00:11.580> a<00:00:11.969> fish<00:00:13.280> its<00:00:14.280> burst<00:00:14.570> after<00:00:15.570> my

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
this one was a fish its burst after my

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.870 
this one was a fish its burst after my
grandchildren<00:00:17.070> had<00:00:17.160> a<00:00:17.220> good<00:00:17.400> bit<00:00:17.580> of<00:00:17.609> fun<00:00:17.850> with

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
grandchildren had a good bit of fun with

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.720 
grandchildren had a good bit of fun with
it<00:00:18.060> in<00:00:18.420> fact<00:00:19.260> it<00:00:19.470> bursts<00:00:19.830> its<00:00:20.039> left<00:00:20.279> up<00:00:20.369> against

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
it in fact it bursts its left up against

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.410 
it in fact it bursts its left up against
a<00:00:20.789> radiator<00:00:21.270> these<00:00:22.080> blow<00:00:22.350> up<00:00:22.500> really<00:00:22.920> big<00:00:23.420> butt

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
a radiator these blow up really big butt

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.900 
a radiator these blow up really big butt
up<00:00:25.260> against<00:00:25.560> the<00:00:25.680> radiator<00:00:25.859> they<00:00:26.340> blew<00:00:26.580> up<00:00:26.609> too

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
up against the radiator they blew up too

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.750 
up against the radiator they blew up too
far<00:00:27.210> so<00:00:27.449> that<00:00:27.570> ombre<00:00:28.310> this<00:00:29.310> one's<00:00:29.580> actually

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
far so that ombre this one's actually

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.180 
far so that ombre this one's actually
got<00:00:30.029> a<00:00:30.060> leak<00:00:30.679> somewhere<00:00:32.960> but<00:00:33.980> they're<00:00:34.980> still

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
got a leak somewhere but they're still

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.090 
got a leak somewhere but they're still
stretchy<00:00:35.730> so<00:00:36.300> I'm<00:00:36.450> going<00:00:36.630> to<00:00:36.660> use<00:00:36.899> them<00:00:37.170> to

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
stretchy so I'm going to use them to

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.979 
stretchy so I'm going to use them to
power<00:00:38.309> one<00:00:39.090> of<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.300> rubber<00:00:39.480> band<00:00:39.750> powered

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
power one of the rubber band powered

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.830 
power one of the rubber band powered
cars<00:00:42.980> we'll<00:00:43.980> try<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:44.280> fish<00:00:44.550> first<00:00:44.940> or<00:00:45.780> the

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
cars we'll try the fish first or the

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.740 
cars we'll try the fish first or the
remains<00:00:46.350> of<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.739> fish<00:00:49.309> I've<00:00:50.309> mounted<00:00:50.750> mobile

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
remains of the fish I've mounted mobile

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.520 
remains of the fish I've mounted mobile
phone<00:00:52.020> on<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:52.320> back<00:00:52.440> of<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.850> car<00:00:54.260> so<00:00:55.260> we<00:00:55.379> can

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
phone on the back of the car so we can

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.060 
phone on the back of the car so we can
video<00:00:55.710> it<00:00:57.289> see<00:00:58.289> if<00:00:58.350> we<00:00:58.379> can<00:00:58.559> get<00:00:58.649> a<00:00:58.710> straight

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
video it see if we can get a straight

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:11.070 
video it see if we can get a straight
run

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:11.080 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:28.860 

that<00:01:12.080> worked<00:01:13.300> subang<00:01:14.300> get<00:01:14.510> straight<00:01:14.870> run

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:28.870 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:36.430 

this<00:01:29.870> time<00:01:30.140> we'll<00:01:30.380> use<00:01:30.560> the<00:01:30.740> tiger<00:01:35.440> stretch

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:36.440 
this time we'll use the tiger stretch

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:46.149 
this time we'll use the tiger stretch
him<00:01:36.650> a<00:01:36.740> bit<00:01:37.510> let's<00:01:38.510> put<00:01:38.720> the<00:01:38.810> camera<00:01:39.170> on

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:46.159 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:54.999 

you

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:55.009 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:02:17.740 

it's<00:01:56.009> given<00:01:56.250> him<00:01:56.340> a<00:01:56.430> good<00:01:56.610> stretch

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:33.530 

that'll<00:02:18.750> do<00:02:31.939> let's<00:02:32.939> get<00:02:33.120> a<00:02:33.150> little<00:02:33.239> good

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
that'll do let's get a little good

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:58.690 
that'll do let's get a little good
stretch<00:02:56.480> so<00:02:57.480> there<00:02:57.659> we<00:02:57.780> go<00:02:57.930> a<00:02:58.139> couple<00:02:58.409> more

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
stretch so there we go a couple more

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.479 
stretch so there we go a couple more
alternatives<00:02:59.700> to<00:03:00.090> rubber<00:03:00.689> bands<00:03:01.290> for<00:03:02.280> rubber

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
alternatives to rubber bands for rubber

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:05.839 
alternatives to rubber bands for rubber
band<00:03:02.760> powered<00:03:03.060> cars<00:03:03.530> they're<00:03:04.530> basically<00:03:04.950> big

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:05.849 
band powered cars they're basically big

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:09.699 
band powered cars they're basically big
balloons<00:03:07.579> latex<00:03:08.579> rubber<00:03:08.760> I<00:03:08.909> think<00:03:09.180> they<00:03:09.299> are

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
balloons latex rubber I think they are

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:13.160 
balloons latex rubber I think they are
this<00:03:10.709> one's<00:03:10.980> already<00:03:11.189> burst<00:03:11.870> and<00:03:12.870> that<00:03:12.989> one's

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
this one's already burst and that one's

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.460 
this one's already burst and that one's
got<00:03:13.349> a<00:03:13.379> hole<00:03:13.620> in<00:03:13.650> it<00:03:14.810> but<00:03:15.810> they<00:03:15.930> both<00:03:16.079> still

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
got a hole in it but they both still

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.330 
got a hole in it but they both still
work<00:03:16.500> as<00:03:16.949> far<00:03:17.220> as<00:03:17.370> stretching<00:03:18.090> and<00:03:19.340> storing

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
work as far as stretching and storing

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:27.170 
work as far as stretching and storing
the<00:03:20.489> energy<00:03:20.519> and<00:03:22.430> pulling<00:03:23.430> the<00:03:23.579> car<00:03:26.030> just<00:03:27.030> to

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
the energy and pulling the car just to

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.409 
the energy and pulling the car just to
make<00:03:27.329> it<00:03:27.359> interesting<00:03:27.540> I<00:03:28.790> stuck<00:03:29.790> a<00:03:30.000> mobile

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:30.419 
make it interesting I stuck a mobile

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:34.010 
make it interesting I stuck a mobile
phone<00:03:30.690> on<00:03:30.870> the<00:03:30.989> back<00:03:31.139> so<00:03:31.349> we<00:03:31.470> could<00:03:31.590> film<00:03:31.859> it
