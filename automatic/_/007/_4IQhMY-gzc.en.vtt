00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
here to the object area distribution

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.360 
here to the object area distribution
we'll<00:02:31.070> change<00:02:31.340> that<00:02:31.430> to<00:02:31.640> volume<00:02:32.450> and<00:02:33.160> make<00:02:34.160> the

we'll change that to volume and make the

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:39.280 
we'll change that to volume and make the
count<00:02:34.640> to<00:02:34.940> about<00:02:35.140> 500<00:02:37.720> as<00:02:38.720> you<00:02:38.870> can<00:02:38.989> see<00:02:39.080> we<00:02:39.170> got

all that little all over our text and
then<00:02:43.430> we're<00:02:44.209> gonna<00:02:44.360> add<00:02:44.570> a<00:02:44.600> metal<00:02:45.110> ball<00:02:47.290> and

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
then we're gonna add a metal ball and

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.250 
then we're gonna add a metal ball and
drag<00:02:48.709> our<00:02:48.890> cloner<00:02:49.310> with<00:02:50.269> our<00:02:50.420> sphere<00:02:50.720> into<00:02:51.140> the

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
drag our cloner with our sphere into the

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:52.509 
drag our cloner with our sphere into the
metal<00:02:51.530> ball<00:02:51.650> and<00:02:51.769> make<00:02:51.860> it<00:02:51.890> a<00:02:52.040> child<00:02:52.220> of<00:02:52.430> the

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:52.519 
metal ball and make it a child of the

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:57.039 
metal ball and make it a child of the
middle<00:02:53.890> then<00:02:54.890> you<00:02:54.980> get<00:02:55.070> this<00:02:55.220> big<00:02:55.549> giant<00:02:56.090> thing

with the values and get them to where
you<00:03:52.090> like<00:03:52.299> them<00:03:53.219> okay<00:03:54.219> now<00:03:54.400> let's<00:03:55.319> add<00:03:56.319> a<00:03:56.349> floor

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:03.390 

you<00:04:00.459> know<00:04:00.549> I<00:04:00.579> had<00:04:00.790> some<00:04:01.060> materials<00:04:02.400> first

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
you know I had some materials first

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.089 
you know I had some materials first
material<00:04:03.969> will<00:04:04.120> make<00:04:04.269> it<00:04:04.419> the<00:04:04.629> slimy<00:04:05.469> liquid

00:04:06.089 --> 00:04:06.099 
material will make it the slimy liquid

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:08.039 
material will make it the slimy liquid
substance<00:04:06.639> we're<00:04:07.090> going<00:04:07.269> to<00:04:07.329> change<00:04:07.810> that<00:04:07.989> to

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:08.049 
substance we're going to change that to

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:15.599 
substance we're going to change that to
like<00:04:08.500> a<00:04:10.019> greenish<00:04:11.019> yellowish<00:04:11.530> color<00:04:14.219> add<00:04:15.219> some

around<00:04:19.359> 7%<00:04:20.820> add<00:04:21.820> a<00:04:21.880> texture<00:04:22.570> or<00:04:22.870> make<00:04:23.020> it<00:04:23.139> a

00:04:23.189 --> 00:04:23.199 
around 7% add a texture or make it a

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:29.990 
around 7% add a texture or make it a
Fresnel<00:04:27.180> turn<00:04:28.180> down<00:04:28.389> the<00:04:28.630> mix<00:04:28.930> strength

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
Fresnel turn down the mix strength

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.010 
Fresnel turn down the mix strength
wherever<00:04:31.000> you<00:04:31.060> like<00:04:31.300> it<00:04:31.539> let's<00:04:31.840> add<00:04:31.990> a
