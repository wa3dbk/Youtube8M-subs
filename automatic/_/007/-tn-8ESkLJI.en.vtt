we have pre sorted I'm gonna slide that
over<00:01:31.940> to<00:01:32.360> one<00:01:32.600> side<00:01:32.630> and<00:01:33.260> bring<00:01:34.250> up<00:01:34.460> our

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:35.440 
over to one side and bring up our

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.810 
over to one side and bring up our
pre-sorted<00:01:36.470> box<00:01:36.920> that<00:01:37.130> we<00:01:37.220> have<00:01:37.250> here

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:37.820 
pre-sorted box that we have here

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.960 
pre-sorted box that we have here
so<00:01:37.940> again<00:01:38.150> if<00:01:38.299> I<00:01:38.450> lift<00:01:38.810> this<00:01:39.140> lid<00:01:39.440> up<00:01:39.760> we've<00:01:40.760> got

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:40.970 
so again if I lift this lid up we've got

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.719 
so again if I lift this lid up we've got
that<00:01:41.150> element<00:01:41.450> overview<00:01:42.170> card<00:01:42.530> again<00:01:42.950> but<00:01:43.580> now

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729 
that element overview card again but now

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:45.789 
that element overview card again but now
as<00:01:44.210> you<00:01:44.330> can<00:01:44.450> see<00:01:44.510> we've<00:01:44.869> got<00:01:45.049> the<00:01:45.229> top<00:01:45.560> saw

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:45.799 
as you can see we've got the top saw

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:48.010 
as you can see we've got the top saw
entry<00:01:46.190> with<00:01:46.580> all<00:01:46.850> the<00:01:47.060> elements<00:01:47.570> are<00:01:47.690> sorted

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
entry with all the elements are sorted

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.080 
entry with all the elements are sorted
into<00:01:48.170> different<00:01:48.650> categories<00:01:48.950> so<00:01:49.850> now<00:01:49.970> we've

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
into different categories so now we've

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.030 
into different categories so now we've
got<00:01:50.240> those<00:01:50.330> stickers<00:01:50.780> I<00:01:50.840> talked<00:01:51.170> about<00:01:51.290> on<00:01:51.650> the

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:52.040 
got those stickers I talked about on the

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.789 
got those stickers I talked about on the
edge<00:01:52.190> of<00:01:52.460> each<00:01:52.820> of<00:01:53.060> those<00:01:53.659> segments<00:01:54.530> so<00:01:54.710> you

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:54.799 
edge of each of those segments so you

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:56.170 
edge of each of those segments so you
can<00:01:54.920> actually<00:01:55.250> sort<00:01:55.460> these<00:01:55.610> into<00:01:56.060> those

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180 
can actually sort these into those

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.359 
can actually sort these into those
different<00:01:56.510> categories<00:01:56.630> which<00:01:57.049> are<00:01:57.369> sceneries

00:01:58.359 --> 00:01:58.369 
different categories which are sceneries

different categories which are sceneries
props<00:01:59.180> characters<00:02:00.170> and<00:02:00.439> so<00:02:00.979> on<00:02:01.130> now<00:02:01.610> if<00:02:01.760> I<00:02:01.880> lift

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:02.150 
props characters and so on now if I lift

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:04.899 
props characters and so on now if I lift
that<00:02:02.240> top<00:02:02.689> sorting<00:02:03.290> tray<00:02:03.650> out<00:02:03.890> we've<00:02:04.640> then<00:02:04.850> got
