developed<00:02:10.979> for<00:02:11.220> visual<00:02:11.760> research<00:02:12.240> but<00:02:13.020> the

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
developed for visual research but the

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.470 
developed for visual research but the
very<00:02:13.440> same<00:02:13.800> tests<00:02:14.370> work<00:02:14.580> perfectly<00:02:15.180> for

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
very same tests work perfectly for

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.220 
very same tests work perfectly for
visual<00:02:16.040> rehabilitation<00:02:17.040> ok<00:02:17.820> so<00:02:18.480> this<00:02:18.960> is<00:02:19.110> the

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
visual rehabilitation ok so this is the

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.210 
visual rehabilitation ok so this is the
last<00:02:19.410> test<00:02:19.650> to<00:02:19.740> do<00:02:19.920> today<00:02:20.100> we<00:02:20.880> are<00:02:21.180> adjusted<00:02:22.220> so

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
last test to do today we are adjusted so

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.550 
last test to do today we are adjusted so
that<00:02:23.250> is<00:02:23.820> not<00:02:24.240> terribly<00:02:24.720> frustrating<00:02:25.440> and

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
that is not terribly frustrating and

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.280 
that is not terribly frustrating and
then<00:02:26.100> we<00:02:26.250> make<00:02:26.400> it<00:02:26.520> harder<00:02:27.030> and<00:02:27.180> harder<00:02:27.450> so

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
then we make it harder and harder so

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.070 
then we make it harder and harder so
that<00:02:28.320> the<00:02:29.250> patient's<00:02:29.730> was<00:02:29.880> loads<00:02:30.330> of<00:02:30.540> practice

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
that the patient's was loads of practice

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.520 
that the patient's was loads of practice
can<00:02:31.710> really<00:02:32.190> get<00:02:33.000> better<00:02:33.240> and<00:02:33.510> eventually<00:02:34.260> the

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
can really get better and eventually the

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.210 
can really get better and eventually the
brain<00:02:34.860> would<00:02:35.310> you<00:02:36.300> might<00:02:36.570> say<00:02:36.930> loosely<00:02:37.620> rewire
