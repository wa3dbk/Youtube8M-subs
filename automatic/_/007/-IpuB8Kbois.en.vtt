have a nice looking bookcase the problem

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.040 
have a nice looking bookcase the problem
is<00:00:29.189> at<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:29.429> inside<00:00:29.849> is<00:00:30.330> like<00:00:30.599> looking<00:00:30.900> at<00:00:31.019> a

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
is at the inside is like looking at a

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.650 
is at the inside is like looking at a
black<00:00:31.289> hole<00:00:31.560> so<00:00:32.189> my<00:00:32.369> idea<00:00:32.700> is<00:00:32.940> to<00:00:32.969> wallpaper<00:00:33.540> in

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
black hole so my idea is to wallpaper in

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.240 
black hole so my idea is to wallpaper in
the<00:00:33.719> back<00:00:33.899> creating<00:00:34.350> a<00:00:34.530> more<00:00:34.710> beautiful<00:00:35.100> focal

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
the back creating a more beautiful focal

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.220 
the back creating a more beautiful focal
point<00:00:35.640> there's<00:00:36.180> two<00:00:36.390> ways<00:00:36.540> to<00:00:36.570> do<00:00:36.870> this<00:00:37.020> if

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
point there's two ways to do this if

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.690 
point there's two ways to do this if
you're<00:00:37.320> assembling<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:37.890> bookcase<00:00:38.340> you<00:00:38.550> can

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
you're assembling the bookcase you can

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.850 
you're assembling the bookcase you can
actually<00:00:38.850> wallpaper<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.690> backing<00:00:40.140> before

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
actually wallpaper the backing before

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.280 
actually wallpaper the backing before
attaching<00:00:41.190> it<00:00:41.489> in<00:00:42.210> our<00:00:42.420> case<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:42.870> backing<00:00:43.230> is

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
attaching it in our case the backing is

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.380 
attaching it in our case the backing is
already<00:00:43.649> stapled<00:00:44.100> on<00:00:44.219> and<00:00:44.550> I<00:00:44.910> don't<00:00:44.969> want<00:00:45.300> to

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
already stapled on and I don't want to

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.090 
already stapled on and I don't want to
compromise<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.989> structure<00:00:46.379> by<00:00:46.530> removing<00:00:46.980> it

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
compromise the structure by removing it

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.729 
compromise the structure by removing it
therefore<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.120> solution<00:00:48.690> is<00:00:48.870> to<00:00:48.899> create<00:00:49.320> four

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
therefore the solution is to create four

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.279 
therefore the solution is to create four
individual<00:00:50.219> panels<00:00:50.719> wallpaper<00:00:51.719> that<00:00:51.960> and

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
individual panels wallpaper that and

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.529 
individual panels wallpaper that and
then<00:00:52.620> attach<00:00:52.890> them<00:00:53.160> directly<00:00:53.969> on<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.210> inside

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
then attach them directly on the inside

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.640 
then attach them directly on the inside
it's<00:00:55.050> going<00:00:55.199> to<00:00:55.320> look<00:00:55.379> awesome

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:57.650 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:59.710

this<00:01:22.970> one<00:01:24.760> because<00:01:25.760> we're<00:01:26.090> working<00:01:26.180> with<00:01:26.330> the

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:26.510 
this one because we're working with the

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:28.030 
this one because we're working with the

pattern we want it to be continuous from

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.070 
pattern we want it to be continuous from
one<00:01:28.220> cubbyhole<00:01:28.700> to<00:01:28.880> the<00:01:28.970> next<00:01:29.300> in<00:01:29.450> order<00:01:29.840> to

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:30.080 
one cubbyhole to the next in order to

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.660 
one cubbyhole to the next in order to
achieve<00:01:30.380> that<00:01:30.410> I'm<00:01:30.770> attaching<00:01:31.070> the<00:01:31.280> wallpaper

and<00:01:34.790> putting<00:01:35.330> it<00:01:35.450> in<00:01:35.570> place<00:01:35.600> and<00:01:36.080> then<00:01:36.470> I'm

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:36.619 
and putting it in place and then I'm

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:37.930 
and putting it in place and then I'm
repeating<00:01:36.979> the<00:01:37.040> same<00:01:37.190> process<00:01:37.640> for<00:01:37.670> the<00:01:37.850> other

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:37.940 
repeating the same process for the other

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:42.400 
repeating the same process for the other
side<00:01:39.880> there<00:01:40.880> you<00:01:41.000> go<00:01:41.150> the<00:01:41.690> pattern<00:01:42.080> matches

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:42.410 
side there you go the pattern matches

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:44.380 
side there you go the pattern matches
from<00:01:42.470> top<00:01:42.710> to<00:01:42.740> bottom<00:01:43.040> from<00:01:43.340> left<00:01:43.430> to<00:01:43.670> right<00:01:43.910> so

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
from top to bottom from left to right so
