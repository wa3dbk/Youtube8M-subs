00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.420
 sant joan 

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:04.950
 when passing 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.959
 saw a man blind from birth 

00:00:07.959 --> 00:00:11.269
 his disciples asked him 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:14.669
 who stung of this one or his parents so that he was born blind 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.730
 Mythical dress and its patients 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.930
 if not that this happened so that the work of God will be demonstrated in its track 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.620
 while we are warm we have to do the work of the crime saw 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:28.919
 here the night 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:32.050
 when nobody can work 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:33.970
 while I am in the world 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:37.090
 sobhi the light of the world 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:38.860
 having said that 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:40.810
 he spat on the ground 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:46.170
 made with the saliva a little mud and only a point in the eyes to the man and 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.480
 Told him 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.010
 labaque in the siloé pond 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.060
 this word means 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:54.460
 sent 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.780
 so man 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.460
 it was designed 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.300
 and he came home coming 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.190
 his neighbors and those who had previously seen him begging 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:09.680
 this is not the same one who used to ask for alms 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.070
 so the 3rd 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:14.700
 it looks like 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.530
 I'm myself 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:17.920
 10 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.100
 with them were the eyes 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.120
 the man they call jesus I made some mud and melon all in the eyes 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:26.719
 He told me that this is how he did it 

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:29.200
 has the rod 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.190
 the bird 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.690
 and then I could see 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:34.900
 all this to that man 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.810
 I dont know 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.709
 they brought the man who had been blind before the Pharisees 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:47.150
 it was Sabbath the day Jesus had made the mud and opened it 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:49.340
 eyes to the blind 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.960
 That's why the Pharisees were asked how he had received his sight 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.219
 I have everything in my eyes since the sale and now I see 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.660
 some of the Pharisees decision 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:05.090
 that man does not have god 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.259
 because he does not keep the Sabbath 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.909
 how can a sinner before such miraculous signs 

00:02:13.079 --> 00:02:18.010
 so there was division between them they finally resorted again to heaven 

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:25.019
 what do you say thunder the juices that he opened were yours which is a prophet 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:27.420
 they still did not want the Jews 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.940
 that the man had been blind and had received his sight until they called 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.369
 His parents 

00:02:33.369 --> 00:02:35.090
 that is that his son 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:40.159
 is this what you say that was born blind how can you now believe 

00:02:41.109 --> 00:02:45.169
 we know he is our son and we know he was born blind 

00:02:46.029 --> 00:02:48.979
 we do not know how it is that he can now see 

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:51.499
 and who opened his eyes 

00:02:51.499 --> 00:02:53.499
 it is good that the lord 

00:02:53.499 --> 00:02:57.009
 movie stars will answer for himself 

00:02:57.809 --> 00:02:59.769
 this their parents said 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:02.029
 because they feared the Jews 

00:03:02.029 --> 00:03:06.129
 because they had already agreed that he should be expelled from the synagogue 

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:10.429
 Anyone who recognized that Jesus Christ and Christ 

00:03:11.179 --> 00:03:13.969
 That's why his parents said 

00:03:13.969 --> 00:03:16.149
 ask him 

00:03:16.149 --> 00:03:17.709
 he's older 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:22.139
 for the second time min yamaha roman who had been blind and told him 

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:24.419
 this glory of God 

00:03:24.419 --> 00:03:29.370
 we know that man is a sinner if he is a sin rondón this is not what 

00:03:29.369 --> 00:03:29.969
 he 

00:03:29.969 --> 00:03:31.939
 one thing is that they are 

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:33.669
 that I was blind 

00:03:33.669 --> 00:03:35.109
 and now I see 

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:38.109
 He did as he opened your eyes 

00:03:38.839 --> 00:03:42.790
 I already told them and they do not listen because they want to run away and again 

00:03:43.529 --> 00:03:46.979
 is that you also want to become disciples of yours 

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:53.859
 you are a disciple of that man they told him after consulting us 

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:55.889
 we are pupils of moses 

00:03:55.889 --> 00:03:59.289
 we know that god pablo love this month 

00:03:59.289 --> 00:04:01.099
 but as for this man 

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:03.619
 we do not even know where it comes from 

00:04:03.619 --> 00:04:06.049
 this is extraordinary 

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:09.309
 they do not know where it comes from and yet it opened my eyes 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:14.849
 we know that God does not listen to sinners he hears the pious one who 

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:16.349
 he does his will 

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:21.609
 I've never heard anyone open their eyes to a blind man of birth if he's 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:24.609
 man did not come from god could not do anything 

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:26.979
 you who were born sun 

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:31.889
 I measure sin how you dare to make mone arno famous dogs 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:34.909
 and he was expelled 

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:38.059
 Jesus learned that he had been expelled 

00:04:38.059 --> 00:04:41.729
 and when he found him he asked 

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:44.569
 what is the son of man 

00:04:44.569 --> 00:04:46.569
 yes the sr 

00:04:46.569 --> 00:04:49.849
 tell him what they allow for me to believe in him 

00:04:49.849 --> 00:04:51.629
 you have not seen 

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:54.309
 b is the one who is talking to you 

00:04:54.309 --> 00:04:55.270
 I believe it 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:57.110
 Mrs 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:59.779
 for judgment of come to this world 

00:04:59.779 --> 00:05:03.249
 so that the children see and those who see become human beings 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:06.569
 some Pharisees who were with him 

00:05:06.569 --> 00:05:09.460
 they heard him say this and said 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:10.580
 believe 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:13.919
 therefore we are also 

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:16.919
 if they were blind they would not be guilty of tecate 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:21.000
 but now that they claim they can see it their body remains
