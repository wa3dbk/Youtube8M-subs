00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
different places like that that's it but

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.469 
different places like that that's it but
it's<00:02:08.399> it's<00:02:08.670> cool<00:02:08.910> then<00:02:09.149> it<00:02:09.239> gives<00:02:09.330> you

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
multiple choice I don't know why I

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.220 
multiple choice I don't know why I
couldn't<00:02:11.700> have<00:02:11.850> just<00:02:11.940> lives<00:02:12.810> now<00:02:12.989> and<00:02:13.020> I

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
couldn't have just lives now and I

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.270 
couldn't have just lives now and I
couldn't<00:02:13.410> have<00:02:13.560> just<00:02:13.650> turned<00:02:13.830> on<00:02:14.040> the<00:02:14.070> light

apparently<00:02:16.560> Dexter<00:02:16.980> is<00:02:18.110> one<00:02:19.110> of<00:02:19.200> those<00:02:19.260> people

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
apparently Dexter is one of those people

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:20.840 
apparently Dexter is one of those people
who<00:02:19.769> just<00:02:19.950> you<00:02:20.130> know<00:02:20.250> can't<00:02:20.550> use<00:02:20.670> light

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850

know<00:02:23.190> he's<00:02:23.700> probably<00:02:23.940> too<00:02:24.150> short<00:02:24.450> to<00:02:24.660> reach<00:02:24.840> it

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
know he's probably too short to reach it

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.440 
know he's probably too short to reach it
that's<00:02:25.769> probably<00:02:26.160> it<00:02:26.519> with<00:02:27.000> the<00:02:27.090> Geiger

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
you to flip all these switches this is

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.560 
you to flip all these switches this is
this<00:02:38.489> is<00:02:38.610> just<00:02:38.760> for<00:02:38.850> memory<00:02:39.150> i<00:02:39.180> mean<00:02:39.330> i<00:02:39.360> don't

you do it again I bunda and now an apple
suppose<00:03:52.420> that's<00:03:53.609> teleportation<00:03:54.609> I<00:03:54.760> mean

00:03:54.869 --> 00:03:54.879 
suppose that's teleportation I mean

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:57.300 
suppose that's teleportation I mean
that's<00:03:55.000> cool<00:03:55.530> okay<00:03:56.530> anything<00:03:56.859> anything

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400
