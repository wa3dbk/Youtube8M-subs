if you want the pole to be out just a
little<00:01:24.729> bit<00:01:24.940> of<00:01:25.119> an<00:01:25.180> angle

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:42.860 

with<00:01:29.760> the<00:01:29.880> door

the back of the town is exactly the same
I'm<00:01:45.300> going<00:01:45.420> to<00:01:45.510> insert<00:01:45.690> the<00:01:45.930> handle<00:01:46.920> of<00:01:47.010> the

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:26.830 

take<00:02:08.750> out<00:02:08.869> the<00:02:08.959> corner<00:02:11.709> the<00:02:12.709> wall<00:02:12.920> guylines

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:33.500 

at<00:02:26.989> the<00:02:27.170> corner

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.540 

there's<00:02:34.230> actually<00:02:34.470> three<00:02:34.500> guidelines<00:02:34.950> on<00:02:35.430> the

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
there's actually three guidelines on the

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.030 
there's actually three guidelines on the
wall<00:02:35.750> depending<00:02:36.750> on<00:02:37.050> how<00:02:37.170> windy<00:02:37.560> it<00:02:37.650> is<00:02:37.680> you

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
wall depending on how windy it is you

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.080 
wall depending on how windy it is you
can<00:02:38.190> use<00:02:38.370> all<00:02:38.760> of<00:02:38.790> them<00:02:39.060> or<00:02:39.299> just<00:02:39.330> one<00:02:40.940> if<00:02:41.940> you

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
can use all of them or just one if you

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.520 
can use all of them or just one if you
have<00:02:42.209> them<00:02:42.360> adjusted<00:02:42.840> just<00:02:42.870> right<00:02:43.110> you<00:02:43.409> might

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
have them adjusted just right you might

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.979 
have them adjusted just right you might
be<00:02:43.650> able<00:02:43.769> to<00:02:43.970> get<00:02:44.970> away<00:02:45.060> with<00:02:45.269> one<00:02:45.450> stick<00:02:45.720> for

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
be able to get away with one stick for

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:49.970 
be able to get away with one stick for
all<00:02:46.080> three<00:02:48.440> that's<00:02:49.440> what<00:02:49.620> I'm<00:02:49.680> going<00:02:49.769> to<00:02:49.890> do

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
all three that's what I'm going to do

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.790 
all three that's what I'm going to do
right<00:02:50.099> now

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.920 

if<00:02:53.310> it<00:02:53.520> was<00:02:53.670> windy<00:02:54.000> year<00:02:54.120> out<00:02:54.270> I<00:02:54.480> might<00:02:54.720> use

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
if it was windy year out I might use

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.260 
if it was windy year out I might use
multiple<00:02:55.560> stake<00:02:55.830> and<00:02:56.130> sway<00:02:56.790> them<00:02:56.970> out<00:02:57.060> to<00:02:57.180> the

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.270 
multiple stake and sway them out to the

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:58.910 
multiple stake and sway them out to the
sides<00:02:57.510> for<00:02:57.840> more<00:02:57.990> stability<00:02:58.170> for<00:02:58.500> the<00:02:58.740> wall

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
sides for more stability for the wall

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.760 
sides for more stability for the wall
but<00:02:59.760> in<00:03:00.000> for<00:03:00.510> this<00:03:00.750> trick<00:03:01.290> that's<00:03:01.500> pretty<00:03:01.710> good

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 
but in for this trick that's pretty good

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:04.820 
but in for this trick that's pretty good
you<00:03:02.760> can<00:03:02.910> use<00:03:03.090> a<00:03:03.420> minimum<00:03:03.960> of<00:03:04.080> eight<00:03:04.230> stake<00:03:04.530> or

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
you can use a minimum of eight stake or

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.730 
you can use a minimum of eight stake or
up<00:03:05.370> to<00:03:05.520> 12<00:03:05.790> depending<00:03:06.090> on<00:03:06.420> how<00:03:07.380> you<00:03:07.440> do<00:03:07.590> the

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:07.740 
up to 12 depending on how you do the

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:12.850 
up to 12 depending on how you do the
wall<00:03:07.890> peyote<00:03:10.880> both<00:03:11.880> sides<00:03:12.150> of<00:03:12.300> the<00:03:12.390> tent<00:03:12.570> have

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 
wall peyote both sides of the tent have

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:16.640

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.050 
of the way like see there or they can be
clipped<00:03:21.330> down<00:03:21.420> to<00:03:22.250> the<00:03:23.250> carabiner<00:03:23.670> on<00:03:23.970> the

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
clipped down to the carabiner on the

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:31.190 
clipped down to the carabiner on the
front<00:03:24.530> skyline

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.260 

so<00:03:31.709> both<00:03:31.920> sides<00:03:32.130> of<00:03:32.370> this<00:03:32.459> candy<00:03:32.760> closed<00:03:33.000> up

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:33.270 
so both sides of this candy closed up

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:39.670 
so both sides of this candy closed up
typically<00:03:37.550> or<00:03:38.550> they<00:03:38.700> can<00:03:38.849> both<00:03:38.970> be<00:03:39.000> rolled<00:03:39.330> up

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
typically or they can both be rolled up

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:53.410 
typically or they can both be rolled up
depending<00:03:40.680> on<00:03:40.800> the<00:03:40.950> weather

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:59.420 

so<00:03:54.420> meaning<00:03:55.410> inside

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.120 

the<00:04:00.430> triplex<00:04:01.000> is<00:04:01.180> really<00:04:01.510> big<00:04:01.920> the<00:04:02.920> floor

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:03.130 
the triplex is really big the floor

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:06.030 
the triplex is really big the floor
space<00:04:03.400> is<00:04:03.670> 60<00:04:04.630> inches<00:04:04.900> wide<00:04:04.959> that's<00:04:05.830> wide

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040

the floor another thing that you can
kind<00:05:21.910> of<00:05:21.970> see<00:05:22.180> I<00:05:22.419> don't<00:05:23.229> know<00:05:23.350> if<00:05:23.380> you<00:05:23.500> can<00:05:23.590> see

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:23.710 
kind of see I don't know if you can see

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:26.659 
kind of see I don't know if you can see
it<00:05:23.770> or<00:05:23.860> not<00:05:23.979> but<00:05:24.250> the<00:05:24.570> the<00:05:25.570> tarp<00:05:25.840> of<00:05:26.020> the<00:05:26.080> tent

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:26.669 
it or not but the the tarp of the tent

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:30.230 
it or not but the the tarp of the tent
actually<00:05:27.669> sticks<00:05:27.970> out<00:05:28.120> about<00:05:28.479> four<00:05:28.750> inches

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240 
actually sticks out about four inches

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.300 
actually sticks out about four inches
past<00:05:31.240> the<00:05:31.690> bathtub<00:05:32.169> of<00:05:32.260> the<00:05:32.350> tent<00:05:32.560> so<00:05:33.160> what

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:33.310 
past the bathtub of the tent so what

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:34.770 
past the bathtub of the tent so what
that<00:05:33.490> means<00:05:33.700> is<00:05:33.970> if<00:05:34.120> the<00:05:34.240> rain<00:05:34.450> is<00:05:34.630> falling

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:34.780 
that means is if the rain is falling

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:36.330 
that means is if the rain is falling
straight<00:05:35.169> down<00:05:35.440> or<00:05:35.470> if<00:05:35.800> the<00:05:35.890> wind<00:05:36.070> is<00:05:36.190> blowing

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:36.340 
straight down or if the wind is blowing

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:38.700 
straight down or if the wind is blowing
this<00:05:36.700> way<00:05:36.940> you<00:05:37.510> can<00:05:37.660> leave<00:05:37.810> the<00:05:37.930> doorway<00:05:38.290> open

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:38.710 
this way you can leave the doorway open

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:40.080 
this way you can leave the doorway open
and<00:05:38.919> the<00:05:39.190> rain<00:05:39.340> will<00:05:39.490> fall<00:05:39.669> and<00:05:39.910> hit<00:05:40.000> the

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:40.090 
and the rain will fall and hit the

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:42.029 
and the rain will fall and hit the
ground<00:05:40.120> rather<00:05:40.600> than<00:05:40.750> falling<00:05:41.650> onto<00:05:41.800> your

00:05:42.029 --> 00:05:42.039 
ground rather than falling onto your

00:05:42.039 --> 00:05:55.280 
ground rather than falling onto your
bathtub

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:55.290 

00:05:55.290 --> 00:06:48.690 

so<00:05:56.130> I'm<00:05:56.580> going<00:05:56.730> to<00:05:56.790> take<00:05:56.880> it<00:05:57.000> down

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:48.700 

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:50.820 

so<00:06:49.540> for<00:06:49.750> a<00:06:49.780> three-person<00:06:50.350> test<00:06:50.560> it's<00:06:50.800> not

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:50.830 
so for a three-person test it's not

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:56.560 
so for a three-person test it's not
particularly<00:06:51.460> big
