00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 beautiful to all the guys here sixers and 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:08.610
 metroid of the brand new video I think 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:10.980
 is the world record at least in 5 on the 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.170
 time to beat crota they put us 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.260
 in all four minutes and 27 these 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:19.619
 boys if a slashing portentous devil 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:22.949
 lucas in some kolymas are boys 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:26.580
 that made me see how little 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:29.460
 time can do crota timers I 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.740
 started when they open when 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.329
 the glasses disappear and I want immediately 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.450
 so I'm not in five I do like 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.760
 you can only see as a spectator the 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.379
 visual will be centered mainly on the 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.600
 grab your shoulders because it's stuff 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:47.070
 phenomenal there is an absurd speed 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:49.739
 manages to give 4 spadate each time is the 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.600
 second round he throws it down to the second 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.640
 at the second shoulder and could also 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.730
 throw it down first if maybe to go 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.550
 a bit of luck and there was less lag the 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.079
 practicing that they use is almost like 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.030
 the one they all use has gone to them 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.790
 they know really fast they have one 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.070
 crazy coordination throw it all out of 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.020
 how many leave the knights for the 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.299
 sorcerers so the sorcerers gen and one 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.909
 story of light as you always have 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:19.439
 always available spheres of light to the 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:21.780
 first wave will come out to the left and after 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.060
 you will see why the video speaks for itself 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.570
 in fact in the video on how to kill 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.850
 crotta is slightly different they do 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:31.860
 another another method is the barrier 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.960
 wheezing on the left practically 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.600
 just outside the door to attract the 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.340
 knights use the barrier 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.560
 prolonged the titan so lasts longer 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.409
 so as to make three waves for yes because 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.810
 they rattle them down three times a 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:48.619
 date and I don't really know how the fuck they go 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.299
 however they succeed so it is possible 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:52.710
 now everyone is getting ready 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.110
 they have also lost time for 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.820
 peel objects to make them last longer 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.890
 the barrier to get more ammo 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.329
 on the ground shit various so they could 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.810
 do it in less time but I think that 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:05.750
 the time has more than come out that good 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.679
 here the frost do it here anyway later 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.810
 now always in the picture 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:13.629
 holding swords because they had already done so 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.040
 first and the second found it 

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:16.629
 time to let me drop again e 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.310
 they made it even faster then 

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:20.469
 from amazing stuff we pipe up 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.969
 always in apulia sword bolano killed 

00:02:20.469 --> 00:02:23.769
 as you can see the shoulders hold 

00:02:21.969 --> 00:02:26.560
 on the column and firm he also throws 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:29.349
 down gallaro he doesn't even take what 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:31.659
 he says from the boys shoots and he plays 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:35.920
 immediately jumps again le 

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:38.590
 shoot as you can see comes from 44 e 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.299
 run away now was immediately fired by 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.650
 new 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:43.030
 see snipers did not break the 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.079
 balls because they are shooting truths 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.950
 the barrier down there 

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:49.959
 here at the 34 we usually shoot here 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.730
 in addition to the 3 spadate not 4 conceals 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:54.819
 we flee instead they throw it down of 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:56.829
 new until the destruction of the sword 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:59.439
 as you can see at the end it makes the super 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:03:01.930
 I go and shoot the super after more 

00:02:59.439 --> 00:03:04.689
 run away quietly and repeat the 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:07.359
 all on the right but this time me 

00:03:04.689 --> 00:03:10.120
 apparently they come out from the right I would not say 

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:12.219
 good crap here recovers life like 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:15.150
 you can know the titan doing the 

00:03:12.219 --> 00:03:17.560
 barrier manages to recover life here 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.970
 how can you see life and suffered 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.979
 I'll put the screen because I couldn't 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:23.949
 see the life of the crust being dead 

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:27.790
 the life is at the lower half of the o 

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:29.799
 of altitude so I see the videos on 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.629
 maximum that they arrived and right 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:33.909
 on the exact half here and even less 

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:36.370
 of the half they are in five are one 

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:40.359
 less to throw it down then 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:42.759
 really crazy to say that in 

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:44.709
 these games in this match not here 

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:45.939
 there is minimal lag then given 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:49.209
 it's all OK 

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:52.120
 I was lost so maybe I was dead 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:55.329
 perhaps it helped to make the 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:58.479
 game was fluid I did n't have any 

00:03:55.329 --> 00:04:00.639
 However, this problem has been 

00:03:58.479 --> 00:04:04.569
 fantastic of dalian more than anything else me 

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:06.609
 I no longer know how to comment because there is a 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:09.519
 the game comments on itself is another 

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:11.680
 their fundamental thing in making themselves of 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:14.980
 knock it down in two steps 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:16.090
 you don't even care about the orcs then 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:20.350
 they do n't even have to make the orcs 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:23.050
 you see portento immediately goes on the column 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:25.539
 and he throws them down enjoyed at fist and swords 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:28.360
 re and this is a great way to 

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:30.100
 buy time to get three done 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.930
 waves at a time not two 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:33.370
 because we like in the video you have 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:33.850
 seen previously that it goes to 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:36.250
 right 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:38.740
 in the previous videos we hold the handle 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:40.479
 shoulders we didn't throw with the door yes 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:42.250
 shoulders we didn't throw down in Puglia 

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:46.570
 shoulders the one that made the sword fall 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:48.460
 however 4 spadate they revise zuma in 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:50.919
 you go out of the second they were like this 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:54.370
 missing a spit is pack 2 explore 

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:56.199
 given down four minutes and 27 thinks that 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:58.800
 are world-class casey guys are 

00:04:56.199 --> 00:05:00.820
 phenomenal they have a crazy speed 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:02.620
 I entered pacts virtually 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:04.270
 latch the rise to have entered a 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:06.190
 latch to catch I'll take though 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:08.199
 how many two pc at 30 that I needed 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:10.259
 still make them fast if it's not there 

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:13.060
 very little a problem selling 

00:05:10.259 --> 00:05:15.900
 guys like told they are hit 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:18.159
 portento devil lucas incerte colima e 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:19.960
 I hope I have all the judgments 

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:22.300
 exact 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:25.060
 if they give me the consent I will put their i 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:26.680
 playstation below if they want in the meantime 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:28.380
 good however the names you know of those 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:31.150
 of the guys who did the business 

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:33.870
 quadra sixer of metroid is still gaal 

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:33.870
 next video
