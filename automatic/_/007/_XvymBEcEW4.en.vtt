00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.040
 Talk to people when you see a multi here. 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.540
 too hot people had to talk 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.179
 global warming but that does not change 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.679
 the fact that the 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:11.730
 Rio de Janeiro had three weeks more 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.889
 warm of the year 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.990
 in the first three weeks of the year is 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.380
 this does not remove the fact that it is very 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.949
 hot but I think we could tap hours 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:25.800
 in having a worse place the club is who is 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:28.019
 for example we could be in the 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.029
 surface of the sun imagine if 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.640
 on the sun's surface aspects of the sun and 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.309
 temperature is 6000 degrees celsius 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.780
 this gives approximately 150 times the 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.670
 the hottest temperature recorded in the 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.530
 rio de janeiro this week 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.350
 It's too hot for you to have an idea of 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.629
 that this opens the chest stove inside it 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.399
 it at the most and this will be a twenty 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.489
 grandparents sun surface temperature 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.860
 And the kid that you will remember your 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:56.070
 stove do not do this was just figure of 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.530
 language but even knowing this fiber 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.180
 it was absurd that the only benefits are 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:04.170
 inconceivable way to save the 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.760
 sunless civilization and I 'm sure 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.040
 that the British Empire did not 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.350
 manages to conceive a civilization without 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.780
 sound in 1922 of the British Empire 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.979
 dominated around 31 million 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.150
 square kilometers around the 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.950
 planet 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.360
 which I think is too much for an island 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.400
 of 130 thousand square kilometers 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.229
 administer more the case we 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.380
 the case is this generate a 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:27.150
 incredible phenomenon it was impossible for the 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.960
 night fell in all territories 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:33.270
 at the same time the sun never 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.630
 put into the British Empire 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:39.570
 This means that where the sun hits 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.850
 there would be either a cross of Saint George Mali 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.970
 the jec 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:47.070
 no crisis inside things to england 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:52.340
 crevices and Antarctic territory 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:58.229
 Imagine living in Antarctica must be cold 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:02:00.570
 the dark and the circulation of 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.759
 approximately 23 degrees from the land 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.670
 opposition play with the south passes six 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.979
 months of the year in the dark 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.869
 It's good the part that england owns 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:10.970
 not after six months of the year in the dark 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:13.880
 because it was closer to the circle 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:16.550
 polar and farther from the pole with everything 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:19.550
 What happened and even dark is the lap 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:22.090
 geographical center of a circus 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:24.500
 how does light work practically 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.959
 tangency of these points 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.300
 these wells because he said toró because the 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:30.590
 that happens in the South Pole also happens 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.450
 at the North Pole 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.980
 but this happens alternately or 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.080
 when the one on the 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.239
 North pole this generates a curiosity a 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.830
 as much as mine because I think 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:40.640
 No one is giving enough talk 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:43.370
 this kind of thing 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.290
 In any case, is it possible to 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.450
 human being spends a lifetime in the 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.769
 the surface of the earth without having 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.989
 the sunlight 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:52.940
 you would say at first that 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:55.400
 Paulo is six months old and others 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.870
 six months of good day 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.239
 Are you going to have the sunshine on some? 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.290
 moment but if you can 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:02.959
 walk the distance between the two 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.700
 poles before 12 hours ie before 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:06.200
 necessarily the day will dawn 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:10.630
 in the full extent of the land that you 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:12.799
 would have been able to occur 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:14.060
 the fastest man has ever built 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:16.730
 go through this path of 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:19.280
 approximately 9 o'clock sr 71 cagão 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:21.290
 military ax that fans capture 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.720
 knows how to blackbird 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:26.030
 distance and 15 hours 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:29.090
 however the two planes against me one 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:31.040
 barrier has taken this route in both 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:33.019
 airplanes have 20,000 kilometers of 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.820
 flight range of 20,000 kilometers away 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:36.350
 which separates the two poles 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:39.049
 Moreover, no 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:40.280
 produced has this autonomy of flight to 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:44.120
 greater autonomy of flight than people 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:46.280
 know 1 and 2 a340 HGW 500 to 17 000 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:49.459
 kilometers only a few aircraft 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:53.120
 after this type were modified to 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:54.620
 more than 20 thousand kilometers and 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:58.930
 still they did not reach the 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:04:00.920
 The speed we need is 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:03.769
 impossible you see those species of the 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:05.900
 earth and escape the sun 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:07.670
 but does the sun go away from us? 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:10.000
 philosophically speaking, nothing prevents 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:12.440
 the sun sumo of the sky is as the request said 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.090
 more physically speaking there are millions 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.290
 of reasons why it just will not go away 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:17.690
 out of the blue 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:20.360
 however this could only really 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:22.460
 heaven that will sweep the earth is that the 

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:24.380
 people were going to suffer about it 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:26.480
 good this video here a video of hiv 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.610
 partner of the American channel that forms 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:29.840
 enough of this and you can 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:31.970
 Do you watch the video I mirror? 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.860
 enough of the model of this channel to 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:36.020
 mount a tv light 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:37.340
 Good, I hope to release one video per week. 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:38.870
 I want you to help me by posting 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:41.390
 stupid curiosities that you have so 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:43.010
 like the one I had now says is that it 's 

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:44.120
 human being and on the surface of the 

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:45.680
 earth without light 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:47.450
 I want you to send the choices 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:49.310
 the techniques you have a case that is 

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:50.510
 adopted measures that no case you 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:52.100
 I do not have only you like 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:55.580
 share a morning with the 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:57.230
 friends and make a feedback you guys 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:59.060
 like you guys will like it if you think 

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:01.310
 these do not say what you want 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:03.790
 fast channel will not have this channel and 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:06.250
 on the crazy channel 

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:09.910
 I thought the first episode is TV 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:09.910
 from childhood
