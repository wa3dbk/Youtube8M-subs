00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:27.900
 for example another one of right 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:36.180
 use the right hook for the 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:36.180
 left-handed because he shapes them for you 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:43.290
 ChÃ¡vez pulled out a sack and entered 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:51.720
 completely backwards 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:01:00.580
 the left-hander for the right is 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:00.580
 I already see myself 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:08.680
 there is not 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.000
 for there 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:23.700
 many things 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.829
 Well, it works from a distance then in that 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.869
 distance but they were not glove that 

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:31.259
 We are raw, I want you to have me 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:34.350
 like at home and pull not to play 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:37.740
 owns this time he made it clear to us then 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:42.090
 you to start signing for 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:45.340
 work as you do if you 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:48.670
 the others are bursting here he affirms 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:53.939
 mind think alike everything so no 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:53.939
 we are throwing me 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:00.450
 we are instant and I want up to 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:00.450
 work because base 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:07.289
 i 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.210
 and I'm going to hurt you 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:22.570
 you approach near where you were 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:25.630
 then how are we doing to shorten the 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:30.060
 distance as old for short to 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:30.060
 can enter work quiet 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.260
 one 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:57.620
 short farm that is very short 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.060
 apart 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.610
 until seven shots 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:31.020
 he never let me do it is very difficult 

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:34.260
 imagine imagine what it would be if I 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:37.050
 out taller and with arms plus the no 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:40.890
 they are going to kill more you want to be more 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:43.590
 that a whole is going a blue step 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:47.100
 where there has been a very long arm 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:50.850
 but good to its in under then 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:52.360
 because that kind of try to enjoy long or 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:54.670
 the one that most 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:59.710
 compressed but because it's okay 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:04:02.140
 Long distance but not good 

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:04.020
 that an involution of our weight be 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:06.900
 very high 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:08.700
 it's not very good because the speed and 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:12.480
 waist is not going to be the same ever 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:14.700
 one of the best is very limited 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.870
 healthy and of our height are nadien 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:20.680
 They are the same 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:25.889
 and the good ones and I have a long arm 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:25.889
 that is normal 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:29.639
 so 

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:46.270
 or longer 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:54.000
 we are from the batteries 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.940
 d
