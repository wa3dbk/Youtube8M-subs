a baby with a simple phone call now I'm

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.960 
a baby with a simple phone call now I'm
not<00:02:12.850> so<00:02:13.030> sure<00:02:13.060> if<00:02:13.540> that<00:02:13.750> was<00:02:13.990> a<00:02:14.020> good<00:02:14.290> idea

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
not so sure if that was a good idea

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.400 
not so sure if that was a good idea
despite<00:02:15.970> their<00:02:16.150> slow<00:02:16.270> pace<00:02:16.600> I<00:02:16.840> have<00:02:17.080> a<00:02:17.170> long

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
despite their slow pace I have a long

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:18.900 
despite their slow pace I have a long
history<00:02:17.620> of<00:02:17.890> becoming<00:02:18.190> addicted<00:02:18.370> to<00:02:18.700> sim

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
history of becoming addicted to sim

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.210 
history of becoming addicted to sim
games<00:02:19.150> I<00:02:19.420> guess<00:02:20.140> many<00:02:20.350> other<00:02:20.590> people<00:02:20.950> do<00:02:21.069> as

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
games I guess many other people do as

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.070 
games I guess many other people do as
well<00:02:21.400> since<00:02:21.760> there<00:02:21.910> have<00:02:22.000> been<00:02:22.090> 28<00:02:22.570> released

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
well since there have been 28 released

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.470 
well since there have been 28 released
so<00:02:23.290> far<00:02:23.320> so<00:02:24.280> if<00:02:24.700> you're<00:02:24.910> wondering<00:02:25.270> what<00:02:25.360> the

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
so far so if you're wondering what the

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.350 
so far so if you're wondering what the
carriages<00:02:26.020> that<00:02:26.170> were<00:02:26.290> on<00:02:26.410> sale<00:02:26.680> on<00:02:26.890> eBay<00:02:27.400> I

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
carriages that were on sale on eBay I

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.390 
carriages that were on sale on eBay I
only<00:02:28.780> put<00:02:28.989> five<00:02:29.200> of<00:02:29.350> them<00:02:29.470> up<00:02:29.560> for<00:02:29.769> sale<00:02:30.010> and

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
only put five of them up for sale and

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.860 
only put five of them up for sale and
that's<00:02:30.580> because<00:02:31.000> eBay<00:02:31.450> has<00:02:31.690> some

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
that's because eBay has some

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.390 
that's because eBay has some
restrictions<00:02:32.380> on<00:02:32.560> how<00:02:32.890> many<00:02:32.980> things<00:02:33.160> you

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
restrictions on how many things you

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.400 
restrictions on how many things you

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
could sell if you weren't a really

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.330 
could sell if you weren't a really
prominent<00:02:36.040> seller<00:02:36.640> so<00:02:37.330> those<00:02:37.900> five<00:02:38.200> sold<00:02:38.830> it

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
prominent seller so those five sold it

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.520
