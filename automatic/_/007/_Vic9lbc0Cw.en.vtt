 Tour de France Special Sprinters 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.040
 especially on my youtube channel since 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.590
 you have been over 100 to put to 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.659
 respond favorably to this survey and 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.759
 so bah it makes me super happy 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:18.640
 today to offer you this let's 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:20.049
 special play sprinters it was just that 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.549
 survey to find out if there was any 

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:24.549
 the interest on my youtube channel if you 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:27.039
 want to still see the videos 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:28.960
 on this game since it can maybe 

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:30.189
 become boring for some but I 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.890
 see it so that makes me very much 

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:34.270
 pleasure since I love this game then at 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.280
 level of the team I can not 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.299
 choose the extras I do not know I do not 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.499
 can not but I do not want 

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:41.859
 choose the teams I already have 

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:43.359
 used and so you were very 

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:45.759
 many to ask me the slang team 

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:49.030
 shimano 2 marcel kittel since it was 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:51.939
 a revelation about this tour de france the 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.950
 tour de france in reality he was 

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:56.710
 unknown to the general public and he won 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.579
 if I'm wrong 3 3 or 4 steps to 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:58.840
 not to say nonsense 

00:01:57.579 --> 00:02:00.520
 so it was really a revelation 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.709
 you have been very many to me 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.880
 ask to play with this runner then 

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:07.959
 I'm just going to selected 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:09.310
 quickly all the steps like that I 

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:10.600
 will do one by one all the steps 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.550
 which I selected I selected 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.470
 six since I do not have a lot of 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.030
 time lately with the return 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.950
 who approach to be able to do you 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.630
 a lot of videos and anyway 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.819
 it's in cash fished a sprinter 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:24.850
 so I chose some steps with a 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:26.980
 profile that corresponds to this type of 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:29.080
 specialties then the first step and 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.870
 porto vecchio bastia you see is holding 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.730
 moderate wind is in full form 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.580
 clement so with the wind will have to 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:38.220
 be careful the second step I 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.599
 look at my cards if I had all 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.090
 I had prepared including aix en provence 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:43.950
 Montpellier with a very strong wind 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.560
 so we'll have to pay attention to 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.390
 border strokes next the next 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.340
 step and saint gildas of the holy woods 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.470
 malo with also very strong wind 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:55.950
 so we'll have to be careful 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:58.290
 once again to the breaks after the 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:01.170
 next step and ferns ride with 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:03.840
 this time a zero wind and a profile 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:06.150
 which fits perfectly with a team 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.640
 of sprinters the next step is 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.799
 tower saint-amand de mauron then with 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.540
 this time a profile of full wind 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:13.980
 no one also against you see 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.690
 that before the arrival in the last ten 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.799
 kilometers away little bumps and so 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.930
 we are very badly placed 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:23.010
 it's impossible to argue 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:25.349
 final sprint then the last step 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.640
 simply Versailles paris the 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:28.319
 champs-elysÃ©es a very very step 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.450
 happy with a very very flat profile 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:32.340
 we turn around the elysed fields 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:35.430
 and the triumphal arch if I'm wrong 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.260
 not before an arrival on the most beautiful 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.340
 avenue of the world 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.989
 so here is a little bit for them 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.489
 different steps i'm going to go 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:42.000
 now in the composition of 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:44.069
 teams 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.139
 so web2 genkoise is the best 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:47.879
 runner anyway the best sprinter of 

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:49.319
 this team but I'm going to choose from 

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:51.480
 play with marcel kittel as I say 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:53.840
 it's a revelation frohlinger was 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:56.280
 on the tour weiler it was simone 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.260
 gutch i do not know how to pronounce 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:01.709
 german i'm sorry yoann huguet there 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:04.799
 was not albert timmer was there matthieu 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:07.560
 sprick was not curling brow 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:10.349
 was body quan who was patrick 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:14.669
 gretsch were not there he misses tom 

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:17.000
 dumoulin who is here who is a 

00:04:14.669 --> 00:04:18.949
 dutch dub if a team 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.260
 German and Dutch 

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:23.699
 basically then it must be said that 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:26.760
 for my strategy of equipped it's going to be a 

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:30.000
 it will be frohlinger willers guedj that 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:32.130
 timmer two-string curlers and dumoulin 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.520
 who will help me in the relays to 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:36.949
 avoid a breakaway 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:39.650
 these runners there will allow me in 

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:42.199
 to control the race of genk old 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:43.819
 will be the pilot fish 2 marcel kittel 

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:46.819
 who will be the leader of this team 

00:04:43.819 --> 00:04:50.780
 for only special aspect sprinters so 

00:04:46.819 --> 00:04:54.110
 to win the maximum of the maximum 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:56.449
 how to say of the maximum of step then 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:58.159
 the goals are simple they are two 

00:04:56.449 --> 00:05:02.090
 so played the yellow jersey 

00:04:58.159 --> 00:05:04.220
 with kitten the green jersey too 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:05.509
 also the yellow jersey since you 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:07.880
 want him to be 25 so he does 

00:05:05.509 --> 00:05:10.699
 still part of the runners 

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:12.560
 compete in the shirt of best young he 

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:13.699
 seems to me except small mistake it is necessary that 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:17.300
 I check I do not know if it's 

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:19.370
 under 25 only or 25 years old 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:21.080
 understood also in it but it sum 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:23.270
 can play the jersey the jersey 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:25.669
 best young if not discuss it with 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:27.860
 dionne of galls colts since him by 

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:29.090
 against at 24 and so is not this little 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:30.740
 doubt but it seems to me that can 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:33.530
 play the jersey the white jersey 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:35.419
 kitten because he is 25 years old after the 

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:38.630
 polka dot jersey I forget it I will not play 

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:40.370
 never the best jersey points 

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:43.639
 climber knowing that it's not at all 

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:45.110
 the goal of solex pleases so here is a 

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:47.419
 little bit for goals after 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:49.940
 team ranking I do not care about 

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:51.979
 super combative also so jersey 

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:54.529
 yellow green jersey white jersey it's 

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:57.050
 the main goal of my team 

00:05:54.529 --> 00:05:58.250
 knowing that I will never sacrifice the 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:00.440
 stage wins and the yellow jersey 

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:02.060
 for the green jersey that is 

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:04.130
 compete in intermediate sprints 

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:05.330
 tiring a lot to win these 

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:06.620
 points knowing that there is always 

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:09.440
 a lot of points at the finish 

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:10.279
 since they are doubled so here I am 

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:11.659
 think I went around 

00:06:10.279 --> 00:06:13.340
 at the level of programming 

00:06:11.659 --> 00:06:15.050
 video outputs i do not know when 

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:15.560
 does that mean when I record 

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:17.479
 the video 

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:18.889
 I do not know how it's going to unfold 

00:06:17.479 --> 00:06:20.330
 anyway I invite you to go 

00:06:18.889 --> 00:06:21.919
 in the description of this video you 

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:23.539
 there will be plenty of information 

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:26.000
 useful especially the output of videos 

00:06:23.539 --> 00:06:28.520
 so that lets you know when 

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.569
 will they also come out I 

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:32.300
 invite you to go into the description 

00:06:29.569 --> 00:06:34.279
 knowing that you will find the links 

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:35.990
 different playlists of let's play 

00:06:34.279 --> 00:06:38.509
 special tour de france on my channel 

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:40.400
 youtube it's possible that you 

00:06:38.509 --> 00:06:41.409
 you did not see them all like that 

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:43.029
 it allows you to 

00:06:41.409 --> 00:06:45.009
 to see a little bit what I did 

00:06:43.029 --> 00:06:46.539
 before and then I think I have 

00:06:45.009 --> 00:06:48.339
 go around we find ourselves very soon 

00:06:46.539 --> 00:06:50.619
 for the first step between porto 

00:06:48.339 --> 00:06:52.300
 vecchio and bastia thank you for watching 

00:06:50.619 --> 00:06:54.669

 I just remind you that all 

00:07:00.789 --> 00:07:03.909
 videos are shot in advance so this 

00:07:02.439 --> 00:07:05.529
 is not worth giving me 

00:07:03.909 --> 00:07:07.229
 race instructions I will not be able to 

00:07:05.529 --> 00:07:09.849
 apply them unfortunately since 

00:07:07.229 --> 00:07:11.080
 connection forced a weak connection and 

00:07:09.849 --> 00:07:12.639
 I have to plan everything 

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:15.009
 advanced to be able to stand out 

00:07:12.639 --> 00:07:16.659
 videos in a small space and ben 

00:07:15.009 --> 00:07:18.099
 listen I have nothing to add 

00:07:16.659 --> 00:07:20.169

 hi everyone
