00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
it very well could be just a vacuum

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:39.860 
it very well could be just a vacuum
problem<00:03:35.180> but<00:03:37.910> it<00:03:38.910> goes<00:03:39.090> back<00:03:39.300> down<00:03:39.450> the<00:03:39.600> first

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
problem but it goes back down the first

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:46.040 
problem but it goes back down the first
just<00:03:40.170> fine<00:03:42.860> she<00:03:43.860> was<00:03:43.980> pretty<00:03:44.130> firm<00:03:45.050> doesn't

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:46.050 
just fine she was pretty firm doesn't

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:48.230 
just fine she was pretty firm doesn't
slip<00:03:46.440> you<00:03:46.860> know<00:03:46.980> it<00:03:47.280> goes<00:03:47.400> right<00:03:47.700> to<00:03:47.760> here<00:03:48.060> when

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:48.240 
slip you know it goes right to here when

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:50.060

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:02.919 
on that if anyone's got any stuff going

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:06.240 
on that if anyone's got any stuff going
as<00:05:03.400> far<00:05:03.669> as<00:05:03.790> you<00:05:03.880> know<00:05:03.970> what<00:05:04.150> the<00:05:04.389> deal<00:05:04.600> is<00:05:05.250> some

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:06.250 
as far as you know what the deal is some

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:08.760 
as far as you know what the deal is some
people<00:05:06.610> say<00:05:06.820> that<00:05:06.850> it's<00:05:07.240> most<00:05:07.750> likely<00:05:07.900> if<00:05:08.560> the

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:08.770 
people say that it's most likely if the

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:12.830 
people say that it's most likely if the
vacuum<00:05:08.980> is<00:05:09.430> fine<00:05:09.700> they<00:05:10.330> say<00:05:10.600> that<00:05:10.810> it's<00:05:10.990> the

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:12.840 
vacuum is fine they say that it's the

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:17.220 
vacuum is fine they say that it's the
governor<00:05:13.840> probably<00:05:15.480> but<00:05:16.480> I<00:05:16.510> guess<00:05:16.810> we'll<00:05:17.050> see

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:17.230 
governor probably but I guess we'll see

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:21.840 
governor probably but I guess we'll see
I<00:05:17.260> know<00:05:17.820> but<00:05:19.680> thanks<00:05:20.680> for<00:05:20.830> this<00:05:20.950> little<00:05:21.220> thing
