00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.149
 hi it's me to propose you 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:06.120
 today a video unpacking the 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:08.189
 fujitsu stylistic s11 mobile that comes 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.000
 just to be integrated by orange 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.620
 in its catalog 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.150
 you have to know that it's an exclusivity 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.469
 and fujitsu does not market its 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.690
 mobile in France 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.650
 will not have an online store 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:19.020
 fujitsu point something that they the 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.340
 sell it is not yet referenced in 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.220
 any case my knowledge by actors 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.199
 type e-traders so you do not 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.099
 would not find anywhere else but on 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.150
 orange shops anyway if 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.220
 the information I still have today 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.900
 the fujitsu stylistic s1 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.369
 it's a word we had already had 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:38.100
 the opportunity to meet in any case 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:39.719
 duty at the fujitsu stand on 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.670
 the mwc show held in february 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.050
 2013 in barcelona it is at this time 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.280
 Moreover most j you put'll talk 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.230
 that they were going to enter the market 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.000
 French with a strong partner and 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.230
 well there for once the partner that 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.460
 only his oranges and it's not just 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.530
 which is the first operator 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.789
 national 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.800
 we are on a law so cobras have 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.090
 parade on cobrandÃ©e oran day 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.379
 so on the stylistic inscription it's 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.140
 the range in which to do well this 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.750
 phone this is precisely a 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.700
 stylistic s 01 and there it is in version 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.020
 black so this team on it and if 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.850
 we make the small tour of the strength of the pure 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.770
 take a walk around the box on 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.390
 look we see a scabbard years that we 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.650
 can very easily removed on which 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.400
 we find and well the two logos of the 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:20.040
 mark and the ch'ti stick and the wharf 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.200
 range found in the packaging a 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:26.440
 added that these sticks visuals 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:28.570
 sportsman we will say recreation relaxation of this 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.070
 phone a phone that I say 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.620
 immediately and mainly the 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.330
 spirous bar among seniors this is the 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:37.150
 politically correct term to say the 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:39.220
 market of sixties and more 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:40.270
 so actually bamba box finally we 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.900
 will do the little trick we did the 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:46.930
 a little tour to new horizons 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:49.450
 good discovery here is what to what 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.640
 looks like the box of fujitsu stylistic 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.680
 German s 01 to be precise this is his 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.690
 exact name then we find in the 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.040
 boiboite a ball a sheath in all 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.649
 case a small case in which we find 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.610
 the doc a dvd tutorial mons ac 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:02.440
 to learn how to use your phone 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.090
 it's not stupid because our dear ones 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:05.500
 seniors may not be already 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.119
 regulars or phone they have 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.340
 may need some training 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:10.570
 fast dvd it's not stupid it can 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.130
 teach them how to use 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:14.470
 features a bit advanced when rick 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:16.320
 phone and then small dealers 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.640
 in a service presentation guide 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.750
 orange may not have in my 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.760
 guide dog presentation of services 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.800
 from fujitsu and with a guide 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:27.100
 of use of fujitsu at the end of the world 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.459
 he's also considering 6 0 so all of this is going to get 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:28.810
 pass 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:30.940
 he is clearly quite nice little 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.769
 sheath small holster I do not know how 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.000
 you did that to me here are the readers for 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:35.980
 you to be prevented from sticking where are 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.150
 you are a burden to you precisely wheat 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.519
 to deceive become as it is called his 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.720
 small pocket maybe so logo 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:41.860
 fujitsu again to 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.180
 inside the mobile actually doing 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.880
 the earth of the box we still find 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:48.640
 a little doc handheld mobile 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.390
 in any case quick start is found 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.860
 mobile in itself 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.480
 so it's 40 mobile type 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.090
 smartphones you see it does not cheat 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.400
 not with a beautiful touch screen 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.440
 we will see in particular these notions of beautiful 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.519
 touch screen during the test we will return 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.950
 in detail with elements 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:05.940
 concrete screen size resolution of 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:08.440
 the screen for it to be we have others 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.220
 listen we have a little logo and then we 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.480
 does it have the functions 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.750
 main 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:16.030
 precisely from this phone then the 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.200
 emergency buzzer that's here that's who 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.840
 allows you to make an emergency call 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:22.060
 here is a powerful sound and that 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.019
 it was at the micro usb jack ok which is 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.230
 below 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:27.640
 yeah and then actually to keep 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:28.670
 the tightness of the phone because good 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.220
 point apparently this last 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:32.900
 tight so actually a whole bunch 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:34.280
 good points to know a smartphone 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.599
 intended for seniors certainly but that is 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.900
 a smartphone so with a real screen 

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:40.910
 touch then and then so this famous 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.739
 emergency buzzer and this notion 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:44.420
 sealing the first contact is 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:47.000
 positive we are on a phone that 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:48.110
 Of course, here is a little 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.670
 weight still in the hand we feel 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:50.900
 that it is dense but who has the 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:53.030
 dimensions quite reasonable and 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.260
 which is absolutely not cheap it is 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.459
 really patient a phone chip 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.480
 that's what we're waiting for 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:57.680
 precisely phones that are at 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.569
 destination of the signing market this is at 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.190
 say phones that really gives 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:02.630
 this feeling is more than the feeling 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:04.130
 besides of solidity 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:06.440
 so it's already seeing a first good 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:07.640
 contact then what is it 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.950
 found others in the linen alan box 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:11.959
 eye full of small sachets in the 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:17.150
 bags we find a pedestrian kit 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:19.700
 ok usb cable usb micro firefighters a 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:23.750
 AC adapter for the classic 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:25.520
 with usb connectivity and a dock a 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:26.900
 finger that allows neither son - and 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.800
 to install phone and that of 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:29.419
 change more easily 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.380
 that's a good note also on 

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:32.540
 senior mobile in general we find 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:34.490
 this kind of accessories with absolutely 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:35.510
 not stupid at all since this allows in 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.460
 made of AIDS clips that makes the phone 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:39.770
 to avoid getting your head upset 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:41.539
 precisely for the senior chariot tried 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:43.400
 to find at the micro-usb connection 

00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:43.700
 it's from the east branch and that's what 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.440
 offense 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:47.390
 there we come back we imagine that it was 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:49.550
 asked for example on a table a 

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:51.110
 game table or whatever you want in 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:51.950
 the team this phone and it works 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:53.300
 directly recharge 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:55.250
 so that would not be my point 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.640
 actually that the doc provided with the 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:57.320
 phone 

00:04:55.640 --> 00:05:00.380
 so that's the first glimpse of this 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:02.120
 phone first positive contact then 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:03.350
 we had already seen on the mwc show 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:05.660
 as I wanted to mention but this is 

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:07.550
 simply also the opportunity to 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:10.460
 take charge in a new stage 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:12.229
 and especially to test it and ben first 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:14.960
 positive contacts a phone that already 

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:16.160
 in a well- conditioned environment 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:18.169
 in any case the package is nice 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.910
 everything is well cut we have the back that goes 

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:21.050
 with one has documentation with a 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:21.560
 dvd to learn how to use his 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:23.990
 smartphone 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:25.940
 it's a good idea precisely and then 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:28.039
 we have the phone itself that is 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:29.840
 good or the satin finally very simple 

00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:35.240
 So here is the unpacking video 

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:36.680
 exclusive fujitsu stylistic s01 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.729
 currently at orange 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:40.689
 Thank you for watching 

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:40.689
 and in Chad
