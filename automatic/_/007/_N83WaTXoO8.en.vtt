00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
believe it was created like this

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:45.779 
believe it was created like this
originally<00:01:38.930> in<00:01:39.080> late<00:01:39.380> 1981<00:01:40.040> from<00:01:40.460> the<00:01:40.550> factory

model<00:02:15.800> I<00:02:15.890> like<00:02:16.040> powershift<00:02:16.400> because<00:02:16.820> they

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
model I like powershift because they

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.330 
model I like powershift because they
created<00:02:17.239> so<00:02:17.600> many<00:02:18.010> of<00:02:19.010> those<00:02:19.250> tractors<00:02:20.260> in
