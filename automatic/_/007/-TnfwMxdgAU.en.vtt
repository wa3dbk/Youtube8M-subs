00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.260 
go small over actual usability and you
look<00:01:28.229> at<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.409> thinness<00:01:28.619> I<00:01:28.979> mean<00:01:29.189> even<00:01:29.610> if<00:01:29.670> the

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
look at the thinness I mean even if the

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.450 
look at the thinness I mean even if the
current<00:01:30.450> or<00:01:30.960> this<00:01:31.110> brand-new<00:01:31.470> iPod<00:01:31.920> Nano<00:01:32.159> even

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
current or this brand-new iPod Nano even

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.800 
current or this brand-new iPod Nano even
if<00:01:32.549> it<00:01:32.640> didn't<00:01:32.880> have<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.090> belt<00:01:33.270> clip<00:01:33.420> I<00:01:33.600> think

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
if it didn't have the belt clip I think

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.319 
if it didn't have the belt clip I think
it<00:01:33.900> still<00:01:34.259> might<00:01:34.560> actually<00:01:34.740> be<00:01:35.040> thicker<00:01:35.970> or

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
it still might actually be thicker or

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.450 
it still might actually be thicker or
just<00:01:36.930> a<00:01:36.990> little<00:01:37.170> bit<00:01:37.500> thicker<00:01:38.220> than<00:01:38.310> the

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
just a little bit thicker than the

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.370 
just a little bit thicker than the
previous<00:01:38.880> version<00:01:39.210> of<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:39.420> iPod<00:01:39.810> Nano<00:01:40.079> so

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
previous version of the iPod Nano so

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.260 
previous version of the iPod Nano so
people<00:01:40.920> have<00:01:41.130> a<00:01:41.159> really<00:01:41.460> big<00:01:41.640> decision<00:01:41.759> which

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
people have a really big decision which

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.399 
people have a really big decision which

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
one they want to get and hopefully that

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.230 
one they want to get and hopefully that
can<00:01:43.439> help<00:01:43.649> you<00:01:43.799> decide<00:01:43.920> there<00:01:44.369> now<00:01:44.820> let's<00:01:45.119> look

at<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.689> OS<00:01:46.290> and<00:01:46.320> how<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:46.680> software<00:01:47.340> runs<00:01:47.670> on

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
at the OS and how the software runs on

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.960 
at the OS and how the software runs on
this<00:01:48.240> iPod<00:01:48.840> Nano<00:01:49.170> so<00:01:49.680> it<00:01:49.860> features<00:01:50.220> up<00:01:50.460> again

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
microphone I mean has all these things

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.259 
microphone I mean has all these things
that<00:03:34.739> really<00:03:34.979> make<00:03:35.159> it<00:03:35.190> a<00:03:35.370> nice<00:03:35.549> device<00:03:35.909> a<00:03:35.940> nice

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
that really make it a nice device a nice

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:38.000 
that really make it a nice device a nice
alternative<00:03:36.510> to<00:03:36.930> the<00:03:37.139> iPod<00:03:37.409> Touch<00:03:37.680> really

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
alternative to the iPod Touch really

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:39.619 
alternative to the iPod Touch really
besides<00:03:38.370> applications<00:03:39.030> and<00:03:39.150> stuff<00:03:39.269> like<00:03:39.419> that

00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:39.629 
besides applications and stuff like that

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:42.259 
besides applications and stuff like that
and<00:03:40.560> it's<00:03:40.829> really<00:03:41.040> a<00:03:41.129> I<00:03:41.519> think<00:03:41.940> it's<00:03:42.060> probably

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
and it's really a I think it's probably

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:44.059 
and it's really a I think it's probably
for<00:03:42.659> people<00:03:42.900> who<00:03:42.989> use<00:03:43.199> that<00:03:43.229> as<00:03:43.530> their<00:03:43.739> primary

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:44.069 
for people who use that as their primary

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:46.250 
for people who use that as their primary
mp3<00:03:44.699> player<00:03:44.940> the<00:03:45.150> previous<00:03:45.479> generation<00:03:45.930> iPod

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
mp3 player the previous generation iPod

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.289 
mp3 player the previous generation iPod
Nano<00:03:46.290> maybe<00:03:46.769> the<00:03:47.010> one<00:03:47.159> that<00:03:47.310> go<00:03:47.400> for<00:03:47.639> you<00:03:47.790> so

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:48.299 
Nano maybe the one that go for you so

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:49.550 
Nano maybe the one that go for you so
again<00:03:48.359> it's<00:03:48.659> going<00:03:48.810> to<00:03:48.870> be<00:03:48.959> dependent<00:03:49.109> on<00:03:49.379> your

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
again it's going to be dependent on your

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.189 
again it's going to be dependent on your
needs<00:03:49.769> this<00:03:50.459> new<00:03:50.609> one<00:03:50.790> does<00:03:50.970> have<00:03:51.150> 24<00:03:51.629> hours<00:03:52.019> of

00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:52.199 
needs this new one does have 24 hours of

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:54.409 
needs this new one does have 24 hours of
music<00:03:52.680> playback<00:03:52.949> and<00:03:53.549> I<00:03:53.609> tested<00:03:54.120> that<00:03:54.150> and<00:03:54.359> it

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:54.419 
music playback and I tested that and it

00:03:54.419 --> 00:03:56.479 
music playback and I tested that and it
really<00:03:54.540> does<00:03:54.840> go<00:03:55.409> for<00:03:55.650> 24<00:03:56.069> hours<00:03:56.400> straight

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:56.489 
really does go for 24 hours straight

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:58.009 
really does go for 24 hours straight
even<00:03:56.970> longer<00:03:57.150> than<00:03:57.239> that<00:03:57.359> for<00:03:57.510> music<00:03:57.720> playback

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 
even longer than that for music playback

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:00.349 
even longer than that for music playback
and<00:03:58.590> it's<00:03:58.829> very<00:03:59.010> nice<00:03:59.250> and<00:03:59.400> very<00:03:59.489> very<00:04:00.120> small

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:00.359 
and it's very nice and very very small

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:02.119 
and it's very nice and very very small
very<00:04:00.419> compact<00:04:00.780> and<00:04:01.260> I<00:04:01.319> think<00:04:01.530> it's<00:04:01.650> really<00:04:01.949> a

00:04:02.119 --> 00:04:02.129 
very compact and I think it's really a

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:04.520 
very compact and I think it's really a
good<00:04:02.549> device<00:04:02.819> there<00:04:03.090> for<00:04:03.449> an<00:04:03.720> alternative<00:04:04.470> to

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
good device there for an alternative to

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.409 
good device there for an alternative to
the<00:04:04.739> shuffle<00:04:05.220> which<00:04:05.849> is<00:04:05.939> a<00:04:05.970> little<00:04:06.180> bit<00:04:06.269> more

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:06.419 
the shuffle which is a little bit more

00:04:06.419 --> 00:04:07.999 
the shuffle which is a little bit more
features<00:04:06.840> now<00:04:07.019> the<00:04:07.079> price<00:04:07.439> point<00:04:07.709> doesn't

00:04:07.999 --> 00:04:08.009 
features now the price point doesn't

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:09.589 
features now the price point doesn't
really<00:04:08.159> hit<00:04:08.340> me<00:04:08.430> I<00:04:08.609> mean<00:04:08.879> I<00:04:08.909> don't<00:04:09.239> really<00:04:09.419> like

00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:09.599 
really hit me I mean I don't really like

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:12.199 
really hit me I mean I don't really like
the<00:04:09.750> price<00:04:09.959> point<00:04:10.229> at<00:04:10.319> all<00:04:10.439> for<00:04:11.220> $149<00:04:12.090> or

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 
the price point at all for $149 or

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:13.249 
the price point at all for $149 or
something<00:04:12.479> this<00:04:12.569> small<00:04:12.689> I<00:04:12.840> think<00:04:13.139> they

00:04:13.249 --> 00:04:13.259 
something this small I think they

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:14.719 
something this small I think they
probably<00:04:13.409> got<00:04:13.680> together<00:04:13.799> with<00:04:14.069> 100<00:04:14.459> bucks<00:04:14.639> for

00:04:14.719 --> 00:04:14.729 
probably got together with 100 bucks for

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:16.339 
probably got together with 100 bucks for
