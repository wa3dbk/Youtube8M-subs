00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:07.250
 welcome to the workshop 

00:00:08.319 --> 00:00:10.919
 you know fihri 

00:00:10.919 --> 00:00:13.919
 my heart 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:16.460
 now let's put together a 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.220
 most holy death a regulator of powers with a reo tato 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:22.849
 let's occupy one that is 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:26.439
 approximately about 35 ups 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:29.880
 to be able to control 12 to 18 flips 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.110
 after twelve 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:35.110
 polanski is so brutal a body of the female 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.700
 guys we started to export hollow first so we could stick our hand in with him 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.610
 remote 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.050
 the cutters urge at low speed 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.050
 it's just a good port to put your hand 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.930
 all the holes that you make to the ones a little bigger and more precise 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.840
 because what happens is that if you do it the same month of the can not put the 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:58.360
 pieces 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.360
 of that total a little bit bigger so you have space 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.470
 and you have to be very precise 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.340
 many times he for a hundred 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.890
 of the material that paralyzed the pieces highlights 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.490
 it's very easy to stay 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.200
 we have to be very careful in auger 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.660
 drill and do all this carefully and at low speed 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.250
 missed the classic melts 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:23.520
 but when you do it well 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.400
 they will be able to enjoy india than to paint it 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.240
 It is usually a lot of garbage and it sucks all the dust and very sticky 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.290
 anywhere cepeda 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:35.680
 you have to lower some parts that are put by the same neighbor 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.950
 to be able to accommodate the doors and the pieces kepa couples back 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.330
 many times one does not do it can not expose the nut 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.110
 for rivers data has a part that hold portrait so that it does not go around 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.530
 to the oracle back the hand 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.350
 despite cutting the peak and when tightening 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.689
 I'm in the inside, it's not going to let me back 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.140
 rejoice 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.430
 and villa barely fits 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:10.260
 I do not fear all the parts inside already put now we proceed absolute so 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.859
 general the or any wire that I find today 

00:02:12.859 --> 00:02:15.639
 has always done the penalties and taxi 

00:02:15.639 --> 00:02:17.799
 all the pen the best 

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:21.119
 to dismiss slowly because of fist burn more things 

00:02:21.119 --> 00:02:24.629
 and always remember to put solder the tips before putting it 

00:02:25.289 --> 00:02:28.289
 It makes everything easier for you are already armed 

00:02:30.499 --> 00:02:33.569
 all finished connected and you see 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:35.259
 this machine where I made 

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:37.939
 with the knives 

00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:40.129
 it seems that it works well 

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:42.139
 Look, it's there 

00:02:42.139 --> 00:02:45.139
 now you have a decoration 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:49.249
 I thought that this machine was going for him too 

00:02:49.249 --> 00:02:53.459
 for chacÃ³n the royal room two knifes punterozo to be a part of down 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:56.889
 wrought goal machined knows all to be able to give 

00:02:57.649 --> 00:03:00.749
 and what to put together nothing more than anything for me to prop up the machine 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:04.739
 but it runs well 

00:03:08.219 --> 00:03:09.479
 Yes now 

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:12.219
 you already have a deleted that you can use to activate 

00:03:12.219 --> 00:03:16.809
 we will work as to decorate also and you can use it with other eliminators 

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:21.279
 many people do not know but you can grab any kind of mined moscow that is 

00:03:21.279 --> 00:03:24.479
 from 12 volts to 20 began to work well 

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:27.479
 the parma that is not made with 3 numerals 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:31.609
 it is also highly understand the piece below in the first set that 

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:34.979
 put them in coils and frame them together 

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:37.669
 put the ankles down 

00:03:37.669 --> 00:03:40.219
 It seems that it also works well 

00:03:40.219 --> 00:03:44.399
 paquita the parts ready to work with the little machines and the most holy as 

00:03:44.399 --> 00:03:46.419
