00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:12.150
 hello and welcome to the street workshop 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.650
 men after cleaning and then 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.390
 feeds the leather of voting articles of 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.580
 leather goods now it's time to 

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:18.930
 protect against external aggressions 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.580
 like rain for example who can 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.220
 stain leather or sun rays 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.660
 who can dry it this step allows 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.400
 also to the tasks of not 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.199
 train and dust encore 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.060
 on the leather for this use 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.949
 the most frequently used products 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:36.120
 on the waterproofing where the anti 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.879
 spot for this demonstration we 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.069
 have chosen to use spirit 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:41.999
 waterproofing for its practicality 

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:45.239
 it's also the smartest choice 

00:00:41.999 --> 00:00:46.829
 for items with a large front surface 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.190
 of a master on all surfaces of the 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.589
 bag 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.620
 thought as for the case cream is 

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:55.859
 born it is on a hidden part of the bag 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:57.780
 like here for example make sure always 

00:00:55.859 --> 00:00:59.789
 choose the most maintenance product 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.510
 adapted to the specificities of your room 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.510
 leather goods 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:09.450
 for example for suede articles the 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:12.450
 spray will not be the same as for a 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.460
 leather bag as presented here each 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:18.240
 maintenance product has its own 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:20.790
 instructions for use concerning our 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.920
 this price must be sprayed about 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:26.330
 20 centimeters from the article of 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.920
 leather goods shook the bomb 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:31.650
 know that a general distance has 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.410
 observed is equivalent to the length of 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.900
 the aerosol it is better to use 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:40.670
 this waterproofing in a room 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:44.240
 airy spray on a regular basis 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.240
 and uniform 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.299
 we now have to reach 30 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.429
 minutes for the product to enter the 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:54.560
 always leave to dry 

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:56.210
 article to the ambient air and avoid 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.670
 sources of intense heat where the veill 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.439
 of the sun after that time you 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.509
 you can quietly go out with your 

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:03.430
 bag without fear of damage or 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:06.140
 smear 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:09.709
 we can even do a simulation 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:11.590
 take a soda for example and green on 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:15.230
 the on the bag 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:17.959
 as you see the liquid bis and not 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:21.400
 not penetrate to remove it enough in 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:21.400
 his palate or a damp cloth 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.720
 the copper does not stick and thanks to 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:35.890
 protective film deposited by the internat 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:38.390
 big is an the bag is like new 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.280
