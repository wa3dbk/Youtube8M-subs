00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.399 
of them in a Mitsubishi Overland Park
and<00:01:02.430> that<00:01:03.329> was<00:01:03.449> a<00:01:03.510> lot<00:01:03.629> of<00:01:03.660> fun<00:01:03.899> it<00:01:04.170> all<00:01:04.229> looked

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
and that was a lot of fun it all looked

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.950

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
very good and look very impressive but I

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.690 
very good and look very impressive but I
wasn't<00:01:07.350> running<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.770> highest<00:01:08.159> settings<00:01:08.490> that

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
still an optimized it feels for PC and I

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:15.859 
still an optimized it feels for PC and I
imagine<00:01:14.970> it's<00:01:15.090> because<00:01:15.240> they're<00:01:15.360> focusing<00:01:15.750> on

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
imagine it's because they're focusing on

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.510 
imagine it's because they're focusing on
the<00:01:16.049> console<00:01:16.590> market<00:01:16.619> and<00:01:17.070> one<00:01:17.189> that's<00:01:17.310> where

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
the console market and one that's where

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.230 
the console market and one that's where
the<00:01:17.610> money<00:01:17.790> is<00:01:17.880> I<00:01:18.000> guess<00:01:19.189> they<00:01:20.189> there<00:01:21.090> were<00:01:21.210> a

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
the money is I guess they there were a

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.440 
the money is I guess they there were a
couple<00:01:21.450> of<00:01:21.659> areas<00:01:21.810> that<00:01:22.229> were<00:01:22.560> really<00:01:22.860> quite

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
couple of areas that were really quite

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.609

ragged around the edges I mean for

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.179 
ragged around the edges I mean for

I<00:01:36.810> would<00:01:37.110> just<00:01:37.259> crash<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.619> game<00:01:38.070> and<00:01:38.220> just

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
I would just crash the game and just

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.640 
I would just crash the game and just
crash<00:01:38.579> not<00:01:38.790> to<00:01:38.850> come<00:01:38.970> out<00:01:39.119> of<00:01:39.180> it<00:01:39.329> and<00:01:39.509> I<00:01:40.500> mean

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
crash not to come out of it and I mean

broken at this point I wouldn't race
them<00:01:57.659> they<00:01:57.869> just<00:01:58.009> they<00:01:59.009> punt<00:01:59.340> you<00:01:59.490> off<00:01:59.520> on<00:01:59.790> each

sounds a good improvement I guess that's

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.850 
sounds a good improvement I guess that's
to<00:02:27.209> be<00:02:27.330> expected<00:02:27.390> as<00:02:27.930> the<00:02:28.160> game<00:02:29.160> is<00:02:29.310> optimized

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
sound but they all come from the same

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.110 
sound but they all come from the same
sample<00:03:01.069> they<00:03:02.069> there's<00:03:02.700> not<00:03:02.819> much<00:03:02.970> variation

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
between them the sounds are still we

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:06.860 
between them the sounds are still we
know<00:03:05.459> they're<00:03:05.580> still<00:03:05.730> pretty<00:03:05.850> impressive<00:03:06.330> but

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
know they're still pretty impressive but

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.840 
know they're still pretty impressive but
they've<00:03:07.680> not<00:03:07.799> really<00:03:07.920> moved<00:03:08.250> on<00:03:08.400> the<00:03:08.519> toxins

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
they've not really moved on the toxins

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:10.039 
they've not really moved on the toxins
to<00:03:08.910> start<00:03:09.180> the<00:03:09.299> game<00:03:09.510> that's<00:03:09.750> kind<00:03:09.930> of

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:10.049 
to start the game that's kind of

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:13.520 
to start the game that's kind of
disappointing<00:03:10.560> I<00:03:10.650> guess<00:03:12.200> but<00:03:13.200> I<00:03:13.260> guess<00:03:13.410> I'm

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
disappointing I guess but I guess I'm

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:14.720 
disappointing I guess but I guess I'm
gonna<00:03:13.680> have<00:03:13.860> to<00:03:13.920> just<00:03:14.010> gonna<00:03:14.220> wait<00:03:14.400> and<00:03:14.430> see

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
gonna have to just gonna wait and see

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:18.289 
gonna have to just gonna wait and see
for<00:03:15.600> later<00:03:16.560> cars<00:03:16.950> and<00:03:17.430> later<00:03:17.579> sounds<00:03:18.000> to<00:03:18.120> come

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:18.299 
for later cars and later sounds to come

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:20.569 
for later cars and later sounds to come
out<00:03:18.480> back<00:03:18.720> at<00:03:18.810> the<00:03:18.870> moment<00:03:19.049> I'm<00:03:19.500> really<00:03:20.340> not

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:20.579 
out back at the moment I'm really not

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:23.479 
out back at the moment I'm really not
know<00:03:21.329> they've<00:03:21.900> stayed<00:03:22.200> okay<00:03:22.590> and<00:03:22.859> that's<00:03:23.100> it

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
know they've stayed okay and that's it

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:26.120 
know they've stayed okay and that's it
I<00:03:23.840> guess<00:03:24.840> now<00:03:25.049> probably<00:03:25.290> the<00:03:25.440> most<00:03:25.500> important

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
I guess now probably the most important

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:29.660 
I guess now probably the most important
bit<00:03:26.340> for<00:03:26.609> me<00:03:26.730> anyway<00:03:27.150> as<00:03:27.390> a<00:03:27.890> sim<00:03:28.890> racer<00:03:29.280> is<00:03:29.430> how

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
bit for me anyway as a sim racer is how

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.620 
bit for me anyway as a sim racer is how
the<00:03:30.180> physics<00:03:30.510> are<00:03:30.720> in<00:03:31.049> the<00:03:31.320> game<00:03:31.530> and<00:03:32.630> again

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
the physics are in the game and again

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.660 
the physics are in the game and again
this<00:03:33.720> has<00:03:33.870> been<00:03:34.019> a<00:03:34.109> constant<00:03:34.620> since<00:03:35.190> I've

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
this has been a constant since I've

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.509 
this has been a constant since I've
walked<00:03:36.120> throughout<00:03:36.510> my<00:03:36.720> project<00:03:37.200> cars

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:37.519 
walked throughout my project cars

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:40.670 
walked throughout my project cars
experience<00:03:38.519> is<00:03:39.480> that<00:03:39.870> through<00:03:40.230> development

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
experience is that through development

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.650 
experience is that through development
and<00:03:40.769> it's<00:03:40.950> to<00:03:41.070> be<00:03:41.100> expected<00:03:41.310> some<00:03:42.060> cars<00:03:42.329> are

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
and it's to be expected some cars are

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.259 
and it's to be expected some cars are
good<00:03:43.140> and<00:03:43.350> some<00:03:43.859> are<00:03:44.040> awful<00:03:44.790> and<00:03:44.970> when<00:03:45.060> I<00:03:45.120> say

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
good and some are awful and when I say

the<00:03:55.739> project<00:03:56.070> cars<00:03:56.280> and<00:03:56.549> they're<00:03:56.670> very<00:03:56.790> they

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
the project cars and they're very they

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:58.910 
the project cars and they're very they
like<00:03:57.660> to<00:03:57.810> say<00:03:57.959> that<00:03:58.200> the<00:03:58.410> sim<00:03:58.590> is<00:03:58.739> very

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
like to say that the sim is very

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.400 
like to say that the sim is very
hardcore<00:03:59.310> but<00:04:00.299> I<00:04:00.359> just<00:04:00.570> don't<00:04:00.750> feel<00:04:00.930> that<00:04:01.200> I

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
hardcore but I just don't feel that I

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:04.370 
hardcore but I just don't feel that I
feel<00:04:01.560> like<00:04:01.950> there<00:04:02.670> are<00:04:02.760> times<00:04:03.480> where<00:04:03.870> you<00:04:03.900> can

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380 
feel like there are times where you can

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:06.410 
feel like there are times where you can

you<00:04:23.040> know<00:04:23.390> that<00:04:24.390> there<00:04:24.600> is<00:04:24.630> different<00:04:25.200> levels

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
you know that there is different levels

you know that there is different levels
of<00:04:25.800> assistance<00:04:26.130> you<00:04:26.370> can<00:04:26.430> have<00:04:26.760> to<00:04:27.090> tailor

of assistance you can have to tailor

of assistance you can have to tailor
your<00:04:28.200> experience<00:04:28.410> but<00:04:29.130> I<00:04:29.190> really<00:04:29.610> thought

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:29.760 
your experience but I really thought

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.130 
your experience but I really thought
that's<00:04:29.940> not<00:04:29.970> the<00:04:30.150> way<00:04:30.270> to<00:04:30.300> go<00:04:30.570> with<00:04:30.690> this<00:04:30.900> I

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:31.140 
that's not the way to go with this I

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:34.910 
that's not the way to go with this I
mean<00:04:31.410> a<00:04:32.870> lot<00:04:33.870> of<00:04:33.930> people<00:04:34.110> were<00:04:34.230> afraid<00:04:34.350> of<00:04:34.620> end

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:34.920 
mean a lot of people were afraid of end

mean a lot of people were afraid of end
up<00:04:35.100> like<00:04:35.340> need<00:04:35.520> the<00:04:35.640> speed<00:04:35.880> shift<00:04:36.210> and<00:04:36.450> shift

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:36.630 
up like need the speed shift and shift

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:39.200 
up like need the speed shift and shift
too<00:04:36.900> and<00:04:37.250> that's<00:04:38.250> not<00:04:38.430> the<00:04:38.550> case<00:04:38.670> at<00:04:38.880> all

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.210 
too and that's not the case at all

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:41.330 
too and that's not the case at all
like<00:04:39.450> the<00:04:39.780> cars<00:04:40.050> feel<00:04:40.830> like<00:04:41.010> they're<00:04:41.220> on<00:04:41.310> the

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
like the cars feel like they're on the

you<00:04:43.860> look<00:04:44.010> how<00:04:44.070> you<00:04:44.160> would<00:04:44.370> expect<00:04:44.640> them<00:04:44.850> to

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 
you look how you would expect them to

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.560 
you look how you would expect them to
but<00:04:45.840> the<00:04:45.990> force<00:04:46.230> feedback<00:04:46.440> is<00:04:46.940> pretty<00:04:47.940> poor<00:04:48.270> at

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:48.570 
but the force feedback is pretty poor at

but the force feedback is pretty poor at

considerable input lag and it really

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:01.740 
wasn't to a point where I'd say it would

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.410 
wasn't to a point where I'd say it would
be<00:05:01.770> a<00:05:01.860> full<00:05:02.070> sim<00:05:02.370> I'd<00:05:02.610> still<00:05:02.910> buy<00:05:03.060> it<00:05:03.090> and<00:05:03.360> I

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:03.420 
be a full sim I'd still buy it and I

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:05.270 
be a full sim I'd still buy it and I
still<00:05:03.630> play<00:05:03.660> it<00:05:04.020> because<00:05:04.560> the<00:05:04.740> driving<00:05:05.130> is

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:05.280 
still play it because the driving is

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:06.740 
still play it because the driving is
pretty<00:05:05.550> fun<00:05:05.790> and<00:05:06.120> I<00:05:06.240> guess<00:05:06.420> that's<00:05:06.630> what

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:06.750 
pretty fun and I guess that's what

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:07.820 
pretty fun and I guess that's what
matters<00:05:07.020> for<00:05:07.080> a<00:05:07.200> lot<00:05:07.350> of<00:05:07.410> people<00:05:07.650> especially

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:07.830 
matters for a lot of people especially

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:09.800 
matters for a lot of people especially
that<00:05:08.160> console<00:05:08.550> market<00:05:08.730> everyone's<00:05:09.630> really

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:09.810 
that console market everyone's really

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:12.260 
that console market everyone's really
into<00:05:10.050> that<00:05:10.110> fun<00:05:10.380> factor<00:05:10.890> as<00:05:11.400> well<00:05:11.700> as<00:05:11.790> a<00:05:11.850> career

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:12.270 
into that fun factor as well as a career

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:14.450 
into that fun factor as well as a career
that's<00:05:12.990> why<00:05:13.170> so<00:05:13.380> many<00:05:13.470> game<00:05:13.800> modes<00:05:14.130> where<00:05:14.400> you

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:14.460 
that's why so many game modes where you

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:16.700 
that's why so many game modes where you
can<00:05:14.580> just<00:05:14.760> know<00:05:14.880> mash<00:05:15.210> all<00:05:15.780> these<00:05:16.110> cars

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:16.710 
can just know mash all these cars

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:20.390 
can just know mash all these cars
together<00:05:16.950> and<00:05:17.340> these<00:05:17.430> hilarious<00:05:17.760> races<00:05:19.400> but

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:20.400 
together and these hilarious races but

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.090 
together and these hilarious races but
as<00:05:20.520> of<00:05:20.730> now<00:05:20.760> I<00:05:21.300> wouldn't<00:05:22.020> drive<00:05:22.500> it<00:05:22.680> for<00:05:22.920> sim

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:23.100 
as of now I wouldn't drive it for sim

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:25.460 
as of now I wouldn't drive it for sim
purposes<00:05:23.840> personally<00:05:24.840> I<00:05:24.870> think<00:05:25.080> the<00:05:25.290> project

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:25.470 
purposes personally I think the project

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:27.320 
purposes personally I think the project
cast<00:05:25.800> is<00:05:25.980> gonna<00:05:26.160> work<00:05:26.340> really<00:05:26.670> well<00:05:26.970> as<00:05:27.270> a

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:27.330 
cast is gonna work really well as a

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:30.500 
cast is gonna work really well as a
single-player<00:05:28.230> game<00:05:28.410> I<00:05:28.890> don't<00:05:29.550> see<00:05:29.790> it<00:05:30.030> taking

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:30.510 
single-player game I don't see it taking

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:33.790 
single-player game I don't see it taking
off<00:05:30.980> massively<00:05:31.980> the<00:05:32.220> multiplayer<00:05:32.640> community

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:33.800 
off massively the multiplayer community

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:36.260 
off massively the multiplayer community
and<00:05:34.800> the<00:05:35.220> experience<00:05:35.640> I've<00:05:35.730> had<00:05:35.760> on<00:05:35.940> mine<00:05:36.120> has

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:36.270 
and the experience I've had on mine has

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:39.290 
and the experience I've had on mine has
been<00:05:36.420> negative<00:05:36.900> so<00:05:37.590> far<00:05:37.890> and<00:05:38.220> I<00:05:38.370> guess<00:05:38.610> I<00:05:38.640> go<00:05:39.000> no

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:39.300
