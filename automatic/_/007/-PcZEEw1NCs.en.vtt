00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.880
 curiosity is nothing more than an HD 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.920
 notebook sata but it already comes with this 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.010
 15 specific to go 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.750
 the xbox 360 that you are going to put my 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.930
 advice is just to ask how many gigs 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.780

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.640

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.640
 him to put on mine and it 's a 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.410
 right here down in the census 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.690
 those causing about one hand 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:01.950
 here but knows the inside door 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:05.519
 It will hardly focus the camera here. 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:08.909
 more than the fittings there as you go 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.820
 fit that part that simple is well 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.890
 placed in the drawer 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:17.039
 careful not to force good small 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:20.789
 Pressure without listening, I wanted to 

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:24.210
 It is installed on your hd xbox 360 

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:26.460
 close it goes there in the option of 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.530
 storage and you will format the HD 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.689
 configure on the console 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.729
 but people here are the tip of today's person 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.289
 I asked a lot to show him how he puts HD 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.869
 if you can see they could see that it is well 

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:39.060
 simple hd installation is a lady 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.310
 very useful it is worth buying a 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.049
 hd for the xbox required for non-users 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.350
 have hd can use the pen drive 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:49.259
 but nothing compared you have there 250 gb of 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.119
 store your console in addition to 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.490
 from what is more it retains much reader 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.119
 why not when you install the games 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.329
 no hd 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:02:00.090
 he reads - here is a boot and I started 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:01.560
 This is where the reader willer turn 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.840
 only what is installed in place 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.670
 But there are people this tip today. 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.039
 I hope you have enjoyed increases 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:12.180
 can see that the door is below 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:13.500
 a bridge on the line and then you'll put 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.150
 your hd 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.650
 I hope you enjoyed hope 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.140

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.920
