the shower and that did not detangle and

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:39.300 
the shower and that did not detangle and
then<00:02:36.819> in<00:02:37.450> small<00:02:38.080> sections<00:02:38.290> are<00:02:38.650> plotted<00:02:39.040> eco

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
then in small sections are plotted eco

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:40.800 
then in small sections are plotted eco
styler<00:02:39.520> gel<00:02:39.700> so<00:02:40.090> I<00:02:40.120> just<00:02:40.300> want<00:02:40.510> to<00:02:40.599> kind<00:02:40.750> of

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
styler gel so I just want to kind of

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.350 
styler gel so I just want to kind of
show<00:02:40.989> the<00:02:41.110> before<00:02:41.310> so<00:02:42.310> I'm<00:02:42.489> going<00:02:42.730> to<00:02:42.819> be

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.390 
condition detangle etc and then I will
come<00:02:49.270> back<00:02:49.660> and<00:02:50.020> show<00:02:50.440> you<00:02:50.500> guys<00:02:50.650> how<00:02:50.860> I

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:39.690 
back and show you guys how it looked
once<00:05:37.600> it's<00:05:37.840> mostly<00:05:38.290> dry<00:05:38.680> now<00:05:39.100> that<00:05:39.130> we're

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:39.700 
once it's mostly dry now that we're

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:41.100 
once it's mostly dry now that we're
getting<00:05:40.150> ready<00:05:40.300> to<00:05:40.390> leave<00:05:40.540> it's<00:05:40.780> been

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:41.110 
getting ready to leave it's been

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:45.870 
getting ready to leave it's been
probably<00:05:41.410> in<00:05:42.660> close<00:05:43.660> to<00:05:43.960> an<00:05:44.110> hour<00:05:44.230> since<00:05:44.890> the

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:45.880 
probably in close to an hour since the

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:47.940 
probably in close to an hour since the
last<00:05:46.090> thing<00:05:46.420> I<00:05:46.540> videos<00:05:47.020> so<00:05:47.440> I<00:05:47.470> got<00:05:47.740> dressed

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:47.950 
last thing I videos so I got dressed

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:51.659 
last thing I videos so I got dressed
we'll<00:05:48.190> make<00:05:48.370> one<00:05:48.640> of<00:05:48.760> everything<00:05:49.240> on<00:05:49.620> and<00:05:50.669> so

00:05:51.659 --> 00:05:51.669 
we'll make one of everything on and so

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:55.190 
we'll make one of everything on and so
this<00:05:51.910> is<00:05:51.970> how<00:05:52.480> much<00:05:52.870> shrinkage<00:05:53.500> you<00:05:54.220> can<00:05:54.430> tell

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:55.200 
this is how much shrinkage you can tell

00:05:55.200 --> 00:06:00.659 
this is how much shrinkage you can tell
the<00:05:56.200> difference<00:05:56.440> from<00:05:56.860> the<00:05:57.480> video<00:05:58.480> that<00:05:59.669> from

00:06:00.659 --> 00:06:00.669 
the difference from the video that from

00:06:00.669 --> 00:06:03.890 
the difference from the video that from
before<00:06:00.820> and<00:06:01.120> now<00:06:01.690> it's<00:06:02.470> still<00:06:02.740> a<00:06:02.830> little<00:06:03.010> dance

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:03.900 
before and now it's still a little dance

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:07.740 
before and now it's still a little dance
so<00:06:04.900> there's<00:06:05.140> still<00:06:05.350> some<00:06:06.419> obvious<00:06:07.419> and<00:06:07.600> more

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:07.750 
so there's still some obvious and more

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:09.450 
so there's still some obvious and more
shrinkage<00:06:08.200> that<00:06:08.380> will<00:06:08.530> happen<00:06:08.710> but<00:06:09.070> this<00:06:09.280> is

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:09.460 
shrinkage that will happen but this is

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:12.360 
shrinkage that will happen but this is
pretty<00:06:09.669> much<00:06:10.530> it's<00:06:11.530> pretty<00:06:11.830> much<00:06:11.950> how<00:06:12.190> it's

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:12.370 
pretty much it's pretty much how it's

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:15.150 
pretty much it's pretty much how it's
gonna<00:06:12.520> look<00:06:12.760> um<00:06:13.630> so<00:06:14.470> I<00:06:14.530> just<00:06:14.710> have<00:06:14.890> to<00:06:14.950> come

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:15.160 
gonna look um so I just have to come
