I<00:00:09.290> was<00:00:10.290> familiar<00:00:10.470> with<00:00:10.740> mistress<00:00:11.220> but<00:00:11.670> passing

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
I was familiar with mistress but passing

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.210 
I was familiar with mistress but passing
through<00:00:12.540> it<00:00:12.660> always<00:00:12.960> to<00:00:13.350> Venice<00:00:13.710> mistress

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:14.220 
through it always to Venice mistress

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:16.880 
through it always to Venice mistress
part<00:00:14.520> of<00:00:14.640> the<00:00:14.730> backyard<00:00:15.240> of<00:00:15.420> Venice<00:00:15.750> and<00:00:15.990> this

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
part of the backyard of Venice and this

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.380 
part of the backyard of Venice and this
is<00:00:17.039> the<00:00:17.130> problem<00:00:17.369> I<00:00:17.669> always<00:00:17.910> had<00:00:18.060> a<00:00:18.089> sort<00:00:18.300> of

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
is the problem I always had a sort of

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.929 
is the problem I always had a sort of
negative<00:00:18.900> image<00:00:19.679> of<00:00:19.800> mystery<00:00:20.279> as<00:00:20.580> you<00:00:20.789> walk

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
negative image of mystery as you walk

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.429 
negative image of mystery as you walk
around<00:00:21.089> you<00:00:21.419> see<00:00:21.449> a<00:00:21.630> lot<00:00:21.810> of<00:00:21.839> things<00:00:22.050> which<00:00:22.289> are

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
around you see a lot of things which are

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.890 
around you see a lot of things which are
very<00:00:22.619> pleasant<00:00:22.890> and<00:00:23.310> I<00:00:23.550> think<00:00:23.999> it's<00:00:24.210> image<00:00:24.689> of

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
very pleasant and I think it's image of

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.109 
very pleasant and I think it's image of
it<00:00:25.019> is<00:00:25.199> worse<00:00:25.410> than<00:00:25.619> the<00:00:25.740> reality<00:00:28.550> in<00:00:29.550> terms<00:00:29.939> of

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
it is worse than the reality in terms of

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.600 
it is worse than the reality in terms of
the<00:00:30.210> sight<00:00:30.449> of<00:00:30.480> course<00:00:31.019> I<00:00:31.320> think<00:00:31.679> it's<00:00:32.100> a

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
the sight of course I think it's a

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.060 
the sight of course I think it's a
really<00:00:33.450> fascinating<00:00:33.690> sight<00:00:34.350> and<00:00:34.860> could

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
really fascinating sight and could

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.860 
really fascinating sight and could
really<00:00:35.310> help<00:00:36.650> re-energize<00:00:37.650> this<00:00:38.460> area

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:38.870 
really help re-energize this area

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.470 
really help re-energize this area
physically<00:00:39.870> and<00:00:40.260> socially<00:00:41.100> there's<00:00:42.030> a<00:00:42.120> lot<00:00:42.330> of

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
physically and socially there's a lot of

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.870 
physically and socially there's a lot of
elements<00:00:42.780> which<00:00:43.230> are<00:00:43.410> working<00:00:43.830> maybe<00:00:44.550> then

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:44.880 
elements which are working maybe then

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.840 
elements which are working maybe then
the<00:00:45.540> totality<00:00:46.170> isn't<00:00:46.440> quite<00:00:46.650> working<00:00:46.830> I<00:00:47.250> don't

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
the totality isn't quite working I don't

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.730 
the totality isn't quite working I don't
think<00:00:48.060> a<00:00:48.120> museum<00:00:48.570> can<00:00:48.840> turn<00:00:49.470> everything

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:49.740 
think a museum can turn everything

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:50.300 
think a museum can turn everything
around

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:50.310 
around

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:54.620 
around
however<00:00:51.030> a<00:00:51.650> community<00:00:52.650> that<00:00:53.190> decides<00:00:53.670> to

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:54.630 
however a community that decides to

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:57.740 
however a community that decides to
build<00:00:54.960> a<00:00:55.470> museum<00:00:56.400> it's<00:00:57.030> always<00:00:57.240> a<00:00:57.270> good<00:00:57.450> sign

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
build a museum it's always a good sign

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.320 
build a museum it's always a good sign
the<00:00:58.290> museum<00:00:58.650> has<00:00:58.830> a<00:00:58.860> serious<00:00:59.280> role<00:00:59.490> as<00:00:59.850> a

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:00.330 
the museum has a serious role as a

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.480 
the museum has a serious role as a
public<00:01:00.870> building<00:01:00.990> the<00:01:01.650> museum<00:01:02.130> is<00:01:02.280> for

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:02.490 
public building the museum is for

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:04.700 
public building the museum is for
citizens<00:01:02.670> more<00:01:03.240> than<00:01:03.450> tourists<00:01:03.870> so<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.469> first

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
citizens more than tourists so the first

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.069 
citizens more than tourists so the first
thing<00:01:04.920> is<00:01:05.100> it<00:01:05.249> it<00:01:05.759> should<00:01:05.969> be<00:01:05.999> built<00:01:06.329> for<00:01:07.020> the

00:01:07.069 --> 00:01:07.079 
thing is it it should be built for the

00:01:07.079 --> 00:01:09.620 
thing is it it should be built for the
people<00:01:07.499> of<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.710> place<00:01:07.950> I<00:01:08.310> think<00:01:09.210> if<00:01:09.329> it's<00:01:09.450> done

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
people of the place I think if it's done

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.539 
people of the place I think if it's done
well<00:01:09.869> then<00:01:10.170> tourists<00:01:10.530> will<00:01:10.679> come<00:01:10.710> but

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
well then tourists will come but

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.639 
well then tourists will come but
tourists<00:01:12.090> also<00:01:12.329> will<00:01:12.479> leave<00:01:12.659> so<00:01:13.020> you<00:01:13.079> have<00:01:13.469> to

00:01:13.639 --> 00:01:13.649 
tourists also will leave so you have to

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:15.920 
tourists also will leave so you have to
first<00:01:14.579> of<00:01:14.789> all

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
first of all

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:26.310 
first of all
your<00:01:16.620> audience<00:01:16.860> must<00:01:17.460> be<00:01:17.730> the<00:01:18.540> local<00:01:18.870> people

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:26.320 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.670 

publicness<00:01:27.760> of<00:01:28.760> the<00:01:29.030> building<00:01:29.420> cute<00:01:29.960> could<00:01:30.440> be

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:30.680 
publicness of the building cute could be

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.390 
publicness of the building cute could be
emphasized<00:01:31.370> by<00:01:31.670> the<00:01:32.510> architecture<00:01:33.170> we<00:01:33.650> tried

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:34.400 
emphasized by the architecture we tried

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.870 
emphasized by the architecture we tried
to<00:01:34.550> make<00:01:34.729> a<00:01:34.760> building<00:01:35.210> which<00:01:35.530> purports<00:01:36.530> to<00:01:36.620> be

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
to make a building which purports to be

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.450 
to make a building which purports to be
quite<00:01:37.880> public<00:01:38.380> so<00:01:39.380> it's<00:01:39.680> organized<00:01:40.250> around

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
quite public so it's organized around

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.060 
quite public so it's organized around
the<00:01:40.700> central<00:01:41.060> hall<00:01:41.350> which<00:01:42.350> has<00:01:42.800> an<00:01:42.920> atmosphere

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070 
the central hall which has an atmosphere

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.490 
the central hall which has an atmosphere
of<00:01:43.520> being<00:01:43.550> a<00:01:43.760> public<00:01:44.060> space<00:01:44.270> when<00:01:44.990> you<00:01:45.080> walk<00:01:45.290> in

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
of being a public space when you walk in

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.680 
of being a public space when you walk in
there<00:01:45.680> it<00:01:46.640> feels<00:01:46.880> like<00:01:47.060> part<00:01:47.270> of<00:01:47.390> the<00:01:47.479> city

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:47.690 
there it feels like part of the city

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:49.840 
there it feels like part of the city
it's<00:01:48.440> a<00:01:48.619> nearly<00:01:48.830> like<00:01:48.979> a<00:01:49.040> courtyard<00:01:49.430> with<00:01:49.790> a

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
it's a nearly like a courtyard with a

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.420 
it's a nearly like a courtyard with a
roof<00:01:50.060> on<00:01:50.240> it<00:01:50.270> because<00:01:50.869> I<00:01:50.990> think<00:01:51.050> that<00:01:51.530> for<00:01:52.160> the

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:52.430 
roof on it because I think that for the

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.359 
roof on it because I think that for the
future<00:01:52.640> of<00:01:52.940> the<00:01:53.000> museum<00:01:53.420> it<00:01:53.570> has<00:01:53.810> to<00:01:53.990> be

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:54.369 
future of the museum it has to be

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:57.670 
future of the museum it has to be
absorbed<00:01:55.540> into<00:01:56.540> the<00:01:56.840> normal<00:01:57.170> structure<00:01:57.619> of

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:57.680 
absorbed into the normal structure of

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.130 
absorbed into the normal structure of
the<00:01:57.770> city<00:01:58.180> it's<00:01:59.180> important<00:01:59.630> that<00:01:59.660> people<00:01:59.840> walk

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
the city it's important that people walk

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.170 
the city it's important that people walk
in<00:02:00.320> and<00:02:00.470> out<00:02:00.590> and<00:02:01.280> even<00:02:01.610> if<00:02:01.700> you<00:02:01.820> don't<00:02:01.910> want<00:02:02.119> to

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
in and out and even if you don't want to

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:03.700 
in and out and even if you don't want to
go<00:02:02.270> to<00:02:02.330> the<00:02:02.450> museum<00:02:02.810> or<00:02:02.960> you<00:02:03.050> just<00:02:03.350> want<00:02:03.560> have<00:02:03.649> a

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
go to the museum or you just want have a

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:05.740 
go to the museum or you just want have a
coffee<00:02:03.950> or<00:02:04.190> you<00:02:04.520> want<00:02:04.729> to<00:02:04.880> meet<00:02:05.060> a<00:02:05.090> friend<00:02:05.330> or

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
coffee or you want to meet a friend or

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.270 
coffee or you want to meet a friend or
something<00:02:06.320> like<00:02:06.410> that<00:02:06.470> so<00:02:06.860> I<00:02:06.890> think<00:02:07.009> it's

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
something like that so I think it's

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.889 
something like that so I think it's
important<00:02:07.670> that<00:02:07.700> the<00:02:07.850> building<00:02:08.179> has<00:02:08.869> a

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
important that the building has a

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:11.530 
important that the building has a
certain<00:02:09.560> balance<00:02:10.250> between<00:02:10.610> being<00:02:11.000> special

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
certain balance between being special

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.449 
certain balance between being special
and<00:02:11.750> normal<00:02:13.630> this<00:02:14.630> museum<00:02:15.200> it<00:02:15.920> won't<00:02:16.280> be<00:02:16.430> a

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:16.459 
and normal this museum it won't be a

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:18.729 
and normal this museum it won't be a

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
give you address that problem and also

three times in your life you know once

the<00:02:45.320> museum<00:02:45.769> has<00:02:46.400> that<00:02:46.610> danger<00:02:48.040> in<00:02:49.040> a<00:02:49.130> case

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
the museum has that danger in a case

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:50.979 
the museum has that danger in a case
like<00:02:49.459> this<00:02:49.519> I<00:02:49.940> think<00:02:50.000> it's<00:02:50.269> got<00:02:50.480> to<00:02:50.600> be<00:02:50.720> a<00:02:50.750> sort

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:50.989 
like this I think it's got to be a sort

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:53.110 
like this I think it's got to be a sort
of<00:02:51.049> cultural<00:02:51.260> centre<00:02:51.860> to<00:02:52.280> have<00:02:52.400> events<00:02:52.700> and

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
of cultural centre to have events and

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.880 
of cultural centre to have events and
those<00:02:53.239> things<00:02:53.540> then<00:02:53.959> then<00:02:54.470> it<00:02:54.620> can<00:02:54.769> do

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
those things then then it can do

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.010 
those things then then it can do
something<00:02:55.250> for<00:02:55.370> the<00:02:55.459> life<00:02:55.670> of<00:02:55.880> the<00:02:56.000> city

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:57.020 
something for the life of the city

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:09.700 
something for the life of the city
I<00:03:05.470> think<00:03:06.470> we've<00:03:06.680> done<00:03:06.890> a<00:03:06.950> a<00:03:08.020> quiet<00:03:09.020> building<00:03:09.380> I

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:09.710 
I think we've done a a quiet building I

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:11.800 
I think we've done a a quiet building I
mean<00:03:09.920> it's<00:03:10.070> not<00:03:10.250> a<00:03:10.310> spectacular<00:03:11.240> building<00:03:11.600> I

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
mean it's not a spectacular building I

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.950 
mean it's not a spectacular building I
think<00:03:12.350> its<00:03:12.770> qualities<00:03:13.600> organization<00:03:14.600> I<00:03:14.750> mean

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:14.960 
think its qualities organization I mean

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:16.540 
think its qualities organization I mean
I<00:03:15.020> think<00:03:15.080> it's<00:03:15.410> well<00:03:15.650> organized<00:03:16.190> I<00:03:16.280> mean<00:03:16.430> we've

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:16.550 
I think it's well organized I mean we've

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:19.810 
I think it's well organized I mean we've
done<00:03:16.580> a<00:03:16.730> museum<00:03:17.410> project<00:03:18.410> which<00:03:19.250> works<00:03:19.520> very

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:19.820 
done a museum project which works very

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:22.480 
done a museum project which works very
well<00:03:19.990> we've<00:03:20.990> come<00:03:21.410> up<00:03:21.440> with<00:03:21.560> a<00:03:21.680> nice<00:03:21.890> plan<00:03:22.220> in

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:22.490 
well we've come up with a nice plan in

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:24.130 
well we've come up with a nice plan in
terms<00:03:22.760> of<00:03:22.940> the<00:03:23.030> section<00:03:23.450> it's<00:03:23.660> also<00:03:23.840> very

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.140 
terms of the section it's also very

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:25.990 
terms of the section it's also very
clear<00:03:24.380> and<00:03:24.620> you<00:03:24.650> know<00:03:24.830> you<00:03:25.220> have<00:03:25.340> the<00:03:25.430> more<00:03:25.610> the

ground floor and the theater the

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.290 
ground floor and the theater the
auditorium<00:03:30.260> then<00:03:30.920> you<00:03:31.010> have<00:03:31.160> to<00:03:31.850> permanent

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:32.300 
auditorium then you have to permanent

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:33.370 
auditorium then you have to permanent
floors<00:03:32.510> and<00:03:32.720> then<00:03:32.840> you<00:03:32.900> have<00:03:33.020> the<00:03:33.110> temporary

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
floors and then you have the temporary

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.100 
floors and then you have the temporary
exhibition<00:03:33.890> so<00:03:34.010> that<00:03:34.690> the<00:03:35.690> changing

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:36.110 
exhibition so that the changing

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:37.570 
exhibition so that the changing
exhibition<00:03:36.590> which<00:03:36.680> attracts<00:03:37.070> most<00:03:37.220> people

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:37.580 
exhibition which attracts most people

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:41.320 
exhibition which attracts most people
brings<00:03:37.970> people<00:03:38.390> up<00:03:38.960> and<00:03:39.790> from<00:03:40.790> from<00:03:41.210> an

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:41.330 
brings people up and from from an

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.210 
brings people up and from from an
urbanistic<00:03:41.780> point<00:03:42.200> of<00:03:42.350> view<00:03:42.530> we<00:03:42.920> really

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
urbanistic point of view we really

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:47.080 
urbanistic point of view we really
concentrated<00:03:43.970> on<00:03:44.620> compacting<00:03:45.670> the<00:03:46.670> building

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
concentrated on compacting the building

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.240 
concentrated on compacting the building
the<00:03:47.660> issue<00:03:47.780> is<00:03:48.050> what<00:03:48.350> should<00:03:48.560> a<00:03:48.590> museum<00:03:49.070> look

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
the issue is what should a museum look

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:51.400 
the issue is what should a museum look
like<00:03:49.460> and<00:03:49.730> how<00:03:50.030> should<00:03:50.210> it<00:03:50.300> behave<00:03:50.600> in<00:03:50.900> its<00:03:51.050> in

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
like and how should it behave in its in

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:53.380 
like and how should it behave in its in
its<00:03:51.500> architecture<00:03:52.250> on<00:03:52.400> the<00:03:52.580> ground<00:03:52.820> floor<00:03:53.150> I

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:53.390 
its architecture on the ground floor I

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:55.810 
its architecture on the ground floor I
think<00:03:53.510> it's<00:03:53.840> not<00:03:54.050> so<00:03:54.350> difficult<00:03:54.590> because<00:03:54.980> you

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:55.820 
think it's not so difficult because you

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:57.550 
think it's not so difficult because you
can<00:03:56.000> find<00:03:56.180> a<00:03:56.360> certain<00:03:56.480> level<00:03:56.810> of<00:03:56.870> transparency

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 
can find a certain level of transparency

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.670 
can find a certain level of transparency
and<00:03:57.740> accessibility<00:03:58.690> so<00:03:59.690> we<00:03:59.990> have<00:04:00.140> a<00:04:00.170> passage

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680 
and accessibility so we have a passage

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.070 
and accessibility so we have a passage
through<00:04:01.040> we<00:04:01.820> have<00:04:02.030> shops<00:04:02.780> on<00:04:02.959> the<00:04:03.050> ground

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:03.080 
through we have shops on the ground

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:04.660 
through we have shops on the ground
floor<00:04:03.410> and<00:04:03.740> when<00:04:03.890> you<00:04:03.980> come<00:04:04.190> up<00:04:04.280> the<00:04:04.400> staircase

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:04.670 
floor and when you come up the staircase

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:07.750 
floor and when you come up the staircase
you<00:04:05.540> look<00:04:05.690> over<00:04:06.020> the<00:04:06.110> square<00:04:06.410> that<00:04:07.040> creates<00:04:07.490> a

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760 
you look over the square that creates a

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:13.060 
you look over the square that creates a
in<00:04:08.480> a<00:04:08.570> way<00:04:08.690> a<00:04:08.720> house<00:04:09.020> with<00:04:09.620> a<00:04:09.650> facade<00:04:12.070> the

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:13.070 
in a way a house with a facade the

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:15.760 
in a way a house with a facade the
architecture<00:04:13.850> of<00:04:13.940> museums<00:04:14.770> contemporary

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:15.770 
architecture of museums contemporary

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:20.530 
architecture of museums contemporary
museum<00:04:16.190> has<00:04:16.430> become<00:04:16.850> a<00:04:17.380> sort<00:04:18.380> of<00:04:18.530> game<00:04:19.359> it's<00:04:20.359> an

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:20.540 
museum has become a sort of game it's an

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:23.920 
museum has become a sort of game it's an
opportunity<00:04:20.989> for<00:04:21.500> architects<00:04:22.490> to<00:04:22.760> be<00:04:22.970> very

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:23.930 
opportunity for architects to be very

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:27.340 
opportunity for architects to be very
inventive<00:04:24.230> and<00:04:25.070> I<00:04:25.370> suppose<00:04:25.820> my<00:04:26.780> feeling<00:04:27.170> is

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:27.350 
inventive and I suppose my feeling is

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:32.470 
inventive and I suppose my feeling is
that<00:04:27.620> the<00:04:28.580> more<00:04:30.010> strange<00:04:31.010> it<00:04:31.580> becomes<00:04:32.000> the

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:32.480 
that the more strange it becomes the

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.930 
that the more strange it becomes the
more<00:04:32.660> exclusive<00:04:33.290> it<00:04:33.410> becomes<00:04:33.800> and<00:04:34.190> the<00:04:34.910> more

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:34.940 
more exclusive it becomes and the more

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:39.310 
more exclusive it becomes and the more
alien<00:04:35.740> it<00:04:36.740> becomes<00:04:37.100> and<00:04:37.370> unless<00:04:38.030> Babel<00:04:38.900> into

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:39.320 
alien it becomes and unless Babel into

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.860 
alien it becomes and unless Babel into
become<00:04:39.680> part<00:04:40.160> of<00:04:40.430> the<00:04:40.610> city<00:04:40.820> structure<00:04:41.210> so<00:04:41.840> I

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:41.870 
become part of the city structure so I

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:44.250 
become part of the city structure so I
think<00:04:42.050> that<00:04:42.470> was<00:04:42.830> what<00:04:43.040> motivated<00:04:43.310> the

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:44.260 
think that was what motivated the

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.530 
think that was what motivated the
architectural<00:04:45.260> ideas<00:04:45.470> was<00:04:46.220> to<00:04:46.430> find<00:04:47.360> a

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:47.540 
architectural ideas was to find a

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:50.290 
architectural ideas was to find a
building<00:04:47.720> typology<00:04:48.560> and<00:04:49.070> find<00:04:49.460> the<00:04:49.700> building

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:50.300 
building typology and find the building

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:51.780 
building typology and find the building
organization<00:04:51.140> that

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:51.790 
organization that

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:53.580 
organization that
has<00:04:52.210> allowed<00:04:52.420> special<00:04:52.930> things<00:04:53.140> to<00:04:53.230> happen

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:53.590 
has allowed special things to happen

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:58.920 
has allowed special things to happen
inside<00:04:54.030> that<00:04:55.030> quietly<00:04:56.760> just<00:04:57.760> becomes<00:04:58.270> part<00:04:58.780> of

00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:58.930 
inside that quietly just becomes part of

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:08.710 
inside that quietly just becomes part of
the<00:04:59.110> city

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:08.720 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.780
