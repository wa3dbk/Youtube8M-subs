00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.659
 in which it differs 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:21.439
 here is the lam and to the good people 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:23.419
 mister nick, alright with you boys and 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:28.340
 girls because I know there are also 

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:32.419
 girls who come to my videos and good 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:36.140
 I'm making this video because it's missing 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:38.540
 three days to finish the deadline 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:41.809
 contest to enter here in my 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:45.530
 server and I'm going to leave some 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:48.379
 information that I think are 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:51.399
 necessary because I have received many 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:53.839
 questions even though I have already answered 

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:57.260
 even in the comments 

00:00:53.839 --> 00:01:00.409
 in other videos these issues arise 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.159
 always new people with the same 

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:03.620
 questions 

00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:05.570
 so I'm making this video here I think 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:08.300
 that everything is already cleared up 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.700
 well first of all, people do not 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:15.229
 has much to do with the subject here, but it is 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:21.140
 I must say that the name is the music of 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:26.030
 my input is down and it's called rolling 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:29.240
 in the deep and a remix of the next and me 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:33.159
 I left a link of the ninth and discretion is 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:35.149
 can be withdrawn or downloaded 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:39.110
 as you prefer 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:42.200
 It's music and please, I asked no more. 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:44.509
 what is the name of the song nobody brings has 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:48.350
 how to spend on all videos from 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:52.789
 I'm leaving the Olympic team 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:55.789
 that can then download the song and 

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:58.670
 fact do not ask more because there is always 

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:59.299
 many many comments on this is 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.240
 good 

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:04.609
 This being personal, I'll answer here 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:07.729
 some questions that are frequent 

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:09.710
 the first is whether it is necessary to have one in 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:12.650
 creta that entered here in the 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:15.080
 server is not personal do not worry 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.930
 in case you are not original 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:20.360
 I'm not even going to ask why it is not 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.430
 If you do not have the conditions we do not have the 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.170
 credit card says to me it's me 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:28.080
 face the inter-sm you build 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:30.270
 This is the most important thing here so it 's 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.520
 send our constructions that 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.950
 regardless of whether the original is not 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.300
 you are able to enter the 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.370
 server 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:42.390
 Another thing I also wonder a lot 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:45.330
 is whether it will take a mach to enter 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:49.830
 here on the server not only is not it also is not 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:52.650
 I need mach if 11 of the 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:57.390
 winners just after we pass the ipÃª 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:03:00.840
 and you're entering in through ip not 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:05.400
 it will be necessary to mach them being these 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:08.880
 a server is a place or is it people 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.730
 paid a monthly fee so that the server 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:14.280
 can be here 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:16.170
 connected 24 hours this is something else that 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:21.180
 I also wanted to tell you guys, you guys are going 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:25.290
 being built 24 hours a day 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:28.410
 because it is always on and news 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:32.549
 I have to think that many will 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:36.030
 to like is that I really need it 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:38.910
 of builders and staff if you are 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:43.260
 to see this video of you in wine that 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:44.970
 have or the world is building know 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.609
 who had requested only one building 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:51.120
 but in the meantime also receive Epic 

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:53.910
 many messages is to ask they could 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:57.239
 exploded and old rode then choose 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:58.799
 a building can do this 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:03.810
 They also think that there is no problem or that 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:05.910
 have sent me something else as well. 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:09.060
 I would like to say is that I am 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:12.620
 need builders so they will go 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:16.890
 be three winners but possibly 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:19.919
 or quite possibly I'll choose 

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:21.630
 more and more two or three 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:23.340
 in addition to the three winners would 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:26.340
 choose two or three more to 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:29.580
 build here with me so maybe not 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:33.360
 will be announced more and then send 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:35.099
 a message in private and then enter 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.870
 also the possibility since I 

00:04:35.099 --> 00:04:38.880
 I like our buildings 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:42.030
 therefore personal 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:44.690
 are three days has your world 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:47.880
 minecraft be only voice or with friends 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:49.170
 stay very full do not send me already 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.880
 I received many worlds 

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:53.070
 I have not yet had the opportunity to see 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:55.650
 no, I want to lose one 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:58.560
 time and see everyone followed to 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:00.450
 choose the three winners but with 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.730
 I said here I need to 

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:05.550
 builder collaborators 

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:08.330
 so it is because even if 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:11.520
 not one of the three winners may 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:14.520
 come build here with me please 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:18.350
 do not ask if they can build 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:21.990
 here you know that the only way in which 

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:24.690
 participate in the contest and being chosen 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:27.990
 for me otherwise it will not be 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:31.710
 possible because your strength as you should 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:35.070
 first be a force to invite all people 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:37.470
 that prevents is and not even logical tracks 

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:41.070
 I'll have to show you here with you. 

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:46.290
 can see we have 10 of the lots alias 

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:48.510
 We're already from 12 to 18 and that 's it. 

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:51.150
 It's just technical, we're all in 

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:53.370
 on the server which gives them 

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:54.540
 makes it possible to build 

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:57.270
 we want 

00:05:54.540 --> 00:06:00.780
 so only how can you see it's hard to 

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:04.110
 I 'll be inviting everyone really. 

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:06.810
 want to join participate and then in the contest 

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:08.580
 I think it has just answered the 

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:12.180
 most frequently asked questions 

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:13.620
 other issues that arise please 

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:15.780
 leave it in the comments that I'm going 

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:19.500
 answer questions related here with 

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:21.480
 the server is clear and in the background is this 

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:24.660
 Guys I think I wanted to say more 

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:26.730
 anything else also creates it saying that 

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:28.020
 it's a beautiful time to play 

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:30.360
 Bell 

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:32.880
 I do not know if you've seen the 

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:35.220
 child to say for having a new look in the 

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:37.770
 channel very soon still today 

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:42.990
 possibly so stay in and try 

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:45.180

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:48.510
 I also say what they found of the new look 

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:49.260
 Ok, this is just another video to the 

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:51.919
