00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.400
 this is an experimental rolls royce 

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.140
 where of the three buildings are 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.540
 a true 28 to break the 100 miles per hour barrier 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:10.730
 and this is 17 jacks and is therefore the only one of the three actually 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:12.009
 have done 

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:14.980
 sports car manufacturer spyker is on top again 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:19.070
 a cio victor muller has the time to return after a year full of stress and stress 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:20.039
 to look 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.679
 it was a different sport from libya lies but can still have a golden edge 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:27.550
 we spoke to victor muller about his frustrations 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:31.490
 how do you get appreciation as an entrepreneur and holland is steeped in one 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:34.710
 stifling Brussels sprout taelen is among all those cars 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.050
 you have never had the best cars in the last year 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.340
 collect his leg moderately 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:43.470
 make it true 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:45.740
 because seven, but maybe I have to 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:48.370
 with work it is natural there are two 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.830
 separatists 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:51.930
 apparently 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.210
 but they come forth 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:54.670
 from the same passion 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:55.890
 now if not me 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.150
 also my eighteenth cars had started collecting and he first stood the car 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:01.650
 rear left bring North Holland 2000 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:03.010
 and then 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:05.880
 although I had never started building cars in his life 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.250
 yet it seemed to a buyer that you step back in or maybe out 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.470
 the company also expects an hour 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.170
 we are not talking about it yet 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.270
 and i have to say ingrid sand everything a piece afterwards 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.200
 this has been an unbelievably good decision that I then made 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.390
 feathers that one has gone 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.510
 if I had stayed where I was 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:28.130
 then I could never have done what we have in the six following months 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:29.580
 seen that happened 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.240
 And that each time led to a success there went 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.170
 because i am way too much 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.360
 in the past 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.640
 I could not and would love the media all day long and be busy in the meantime 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.530
 to top it off in the van der meer to manage the company every day 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.290
 under the back earlier 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.680
 perhaps one of the best designs from before the war 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.810
 and those are from 5 series 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.800
 and notorious bondage 39 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.800
 joining a final peat is motor 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:58.350
 six-cylinder 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.270
 and 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.600
 and they are that his equal does not know in terms of 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.120
 elegance and 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.610
 a beautiful car value of mi6 made are still exist 4 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.029
 you had all the media attention yes 

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:13.989
 We have Dubai simply because it costs you so much time or because you are up 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:17.909
 churches in the media result has naturally been very curious about it 

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:18.799
 result 

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:20.209
 and in particular 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:22.799
 because it was no longer about the facts 

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:25.899
 and only possible to go 

00:02:25.899 --> 00:02:28.569
 otherwise it will shortly become a strong match 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:31.689
 who had nothing to do with the underlying business 

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:35.230
 was no longer based on the facts 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.170
 the ps has that it goes bad start to shoot at me take it 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:40.859
 did not go bad at all 

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:43.200
 that is the name stand as from England 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.069
 it had been going bad for a while for neighborhoods where nails were going badly 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:48.699
 that was due to the negative media attention 

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:51.549
 the bunt met 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:52.969
 hurley but capable 

00:02:52.969 --> 00:02:55.960
 in the meantime, I always have it on the edge of 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:58.249
 from from from our borders 

00:02:58.249 --> 00:03:01.909
 we have never paid anything in our history to anyone 

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:04.339
 we have people very often 

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:06.479
 let's pay late 

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:07.909
 there is no discussion about that 

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:09.179
 not at all 

00:03:09.179 --> 00:03:11.189
 some of that saying so it's just 

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:15.029
 start-up companies might like to take a look at this one 

00:03:15.029 --> 00:03:17.349
 black sector v12 

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:20.859
 which I still win also by 99 

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:23.229
 when I come as an independent entrepreneur 

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:26.599
 and then I bought butcher Chris Keulemans from my brand 

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:30.229
 the deserter for 2 12 

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:31.599
 city ​​3 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:33.009
 diane 

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:34.859
 when it just went out of production 

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:35.880
 and 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.679
 I have always kept it because it has some sort of sentimental value for me 

00:03:39.679 --> 00:03:41.759
 because he symbolizes me then 

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:45.079
 As an entrepreneur started for myself we bought lottery tickets that couldn't get him 

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:45.749
 Pay 

00:03:45.749 --> 00:03:48.879
 and I did because I knew that if I did that I would force myself 

00:03:49.499 --> 00:03:53.829
 to do so terribly best to make money that I have the lines of 

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:56.769
 suitcase busy with a list that I could not afford it is very good 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:57.929
 succeeded and I have one 

00:03:57.929 --> 00:03:59.649
 still seven years later 

00:03:59.649 --> 00:04:01.880
 if you had been in another country 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.149
 do you think i don't know 

00:04:04.149 --> 00:04:07.149
 that is also the only hit of the evening on the cover of ford fiesta 

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:09.299
 as an entrepreneur 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:12.699
 which successfully brings the timber brand back to 

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:16.109
 and a real business I think it's about the word success 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:19.930
 when its but that obliges the definition of success 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:21.720
 in the netherlands is so different 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.189
 then for example in america 

00:04:24.189 --> 00:04:27.649
 again that is not a clarifier that is an objective determination 

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:32.520
 in America or Shiite undertakes and tries 

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:34.849
 and you do that 

00:04:34.849 --> 00:04:38.729
 Do you have a certain degree of success I obviously didn't do that 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:40.969
 I don't turn you around to explain that 

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:42.750
 that's making it through 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:45.759
 the year horribilis 2007 different 

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:47.639
 I would have liked for that 

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:50.159
 but if it does happen and you come 

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:53.159
 with really battered and bloody heads after other side 

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:55.840
 then you better do it 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:57.809
 keep something positive about it 

00:04:57.809 --> 00:05:02.470
 to that to that year and I think the only real concrete toast is therefore a park 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:04.789
 a few positive things to say 

00:05:04.789 --> 00:05:06.999
 I think we have learned a lot 

00:05:06.999 --> 00:05:10.310
 we have to never again go into the money of a deadly mix 

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:12.639
 I think we 

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:16.669
 nevertheless a global work this is positive for brand prominence 

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:20.460
 more church than before here falls more church fame approaching 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:22.710
 try not to quantify whether it is good or bad 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:24.860
 but more I've known 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:26.490
 and I think 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:28.699
 that our friends got to know 

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:29.870
 and 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:32.870
 it was a year to stab with the words of a loved one 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:35.130
 so it is nice on it
