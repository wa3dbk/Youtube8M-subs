00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
too much the fact that there's only 250

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.270 
too much the fact that there's only 250
of<00:01:37.260> these<00:01:37.550> from<00:01:38.550> like<00:01:38.730> what<00:01:38.940> 2000<00:01:39.480> in<00:01:40.280> 2000

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
of these from like what 2000 in 2000

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.650 
of these from like what 2000 in 2000
like<00:01:41.400> 6<00:01:43.220> 2011<00:01:44.220> but<00:01:44.880> this<00:01:45.030> was<00:01:45.180> some<00:01:45.390> time<00:01:45.630> ago

mats<00:01:48.390> have<00:01:48.570> been<00:01:48.750> lost<00:01:49.020> so<00:01:49.410> they<00:01:49.560> have<00:01:49.650> been

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:49.830 
mats have been lost so they have been

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:52.460 
mats have been lost so they have been
damaged<00:01:50.430> or<00:01:50.820> something<00:01:51.600> bad<00:01:51.810> has<00:01:51.990> happened<00:01:52.020> to

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
damaged or something bad has happened to

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:52.880 
damaged or something bad has happened to
them

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
them

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.170 
them
and<00:01:54.020> yeah<00:01:55.020> this<00:01:55.320> is<00:01:55.380> a<00:01:55.770> gorgeous<00:01:56.490> play<00:01:56.970> match
