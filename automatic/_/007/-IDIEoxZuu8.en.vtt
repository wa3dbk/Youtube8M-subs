you're gonna have to be having him make

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:41.999 
you're gonna have to be having him make
you<00:01:40.869> more<00:01:41.079> than<00:01:41.259> like<00:01:41.409> a<00:01:41.439> hundred<00:01:41.709> K<00:01:41.950> to

actually get a decent profit of him

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.870 
actually get a decent profit of him

because tax from a million coins is five

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.309 
because tax from a million coins is five
percent<00:01:46.270> and<00:01:46.420> that's<00:01:46.539> fifty<00:01:46.869> thousand<00:01:47.200> coins

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:49.289 
percent and that's fifty thousand coins
and<00:01:47.679> there's<00:01:48.159> a<00:01:48.219> lot<00:01:48.369> of<00:01:48.399> coins<00:01:48.670> so<00:01:48.999> you<00:01:49.060> know

and there's a lot of coins so you know

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:50.429 
and there's a lot of coins so you know
you<00:01:49.359> can<00:01:49.450> see<00:01:49.719> kind<00:01:49.899> of<00:01:49.990> see<00:01:50.109> where<00:01:50.200> I'm<00:01:50.259> coming

you can see kind of see where I'm coming
from<00:01:50.590> here<00:01:50.939> so<00:01:51.939> I<00:01:51.969> would<00:01:52.179> kind<00:01:52.270> of<00:01:52.359> stay<00:01:52.539> away

00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:52.719 
from here so I would kind of stay away

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:54.319 
from here so I would kind of stay away

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
that I think could you know definitely

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.139 
that I think could you know definitely
rising<00:01:59.259> prices<00:01:59.619> this<00:01:59.889> guy<00:02:00.009> Figueroa<00:02:00.549> now

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
that inform battery Sonya as well and

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.100 
that inform battery Sonya as well and
he's<00:02:06.880> a<00:02:06.909> lot<00:02:07.119> cheaper<00:02:07.149> and<00:02:07.659> he's<00:02:07.749> kind<00:02:07.929> of<00:02:07.959> got

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
he's a lot cheaper and he's kind of got

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:09.660 
he's a lot cheaper and he's kind of got
the<00:02:08.200> same<00:02:08.410> kind<00:02:08.619> of<00:02:08.740> stats<00:02:08.950> obviously<00:02:09.369> do<00:02:09.580> it

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
the same kind of stats obviously do it

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.330 
the same kind of stats obviously do it
too<00:02:09.910> as<00:02:10.060> kind<00:02:10.360> of<00:02:10.390> a<00:02:10.599> worse<00:02:11.140> degree<00:02:11.590> but<00:02:11.860> he

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
too as kind of a worse degree but he

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:13.770 
too as kind of a worse degree but he
would<00:02:12.430> still<00:02:12.490> be<00:02:12.790> absolutely<00:02:13.180> fantastic

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
would still be absolutely fantastic

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.900 
would still be absolutely fantastic
here's<00:02:14.290> a<00:02:14.410> little<00:02:14.680> small<00:02:14.920> but<00:02:15.460> i<00:02:15.520> think<00:02:15.730> is<00:02:15.820> the

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
here's a little small but i think is the

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.390 
here's a little small but i think is the
same<00:02:16.090> height<00:02:16.360> as<00:02:16.570> back<00:02:17.440> with<00:02:17.590> sonya<00:02:17.890> so

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
same height as back with sonya so

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.220 
same height as back with sonya so
I'm<00:02:18.909> not<00:02:19.060> too<00:02:19.239> sure<00:02:19.390> how<00:02:19.569> much<00:02:19.689> is<00:02:19.870> going<00:02:20.049> for

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
I'm not too sure how much is going for

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:21.390 
I'm not too sure how much is going for
at<00:02:20.290> the<00:02:20.349> moment<00:02:20.379> but<00:02:20.769> I<00:02:20.860> definitely<00:02:21.099> think

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
at the moment but I definitely think

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.559 
at the moment but I definitely think
this<00:02:21.579> guy<00:02:21.700> could<00:02:21.849> be<00:02:21.909> a<00:02:22.000> good<00:02:22.120> player<00:02:22.329> to<00:02:22.450> pick

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:22.569 
this guy could be a good player to pick

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:24.089 
this guy could be a good player to pick
up<00:02:22.750> I<00:02:22.930> can't<00:02:23.349> see<00:02:23.500> him<00:02:23.560> getting<00:02:23.739> another

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:24.099 
up I can't see him getting another

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:25.319 
up I can't see him getting another
informed<00:02:24.579> because<00:02:24.700> he's<00:02:24.879> not<00:02:25.030> really<00:02:25.150> that

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:25.329 
informed because he's not really that

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:26.729 
informed because he's not really that
kind<00:02:25.480> of<00:02:25.599> player<00:02:25.810> that<00:02:25.840> gets<00:02:26.260> you<00:02:26.650> know

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:26.739 
kind of player that gets you know

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:29.130 
kind of player that gets you know
several<00:02:27.040> informs<00:02:27.700> but<00:02:28.000> you<00:02:28.420> know<00:02:28.540> I<00:02:28.569> think<00:02:28.720> he

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
several informs but you know I think he

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.470 
several informs but you know I think he

he's been fantastic so definitely worth

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.599 
he's been fantastic so definitely worth
a<00:03:03.970> look<00:03:04.150> in<00:03:04.329> there<00:03:04.540> and<00:03:05.379> then<00:03:05.560> we<00:03:05.680> have<00:03:05.920> Rafael

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:06.609 
a look in there and then we have Rafael

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:09.599 
a look in there and then we have Rafael
the<00:03:06.790> second<00:03:07.120> informer<00:03:07.629> Rafael<00:03:08.230> 86<00:03:09.220> place<00:03:09.400> each

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:09.609 
the second informer Rafael 86 place each

Center<00:03:11.799> 7<00:03:11.950> passing<00:03:12.519> I<00:03:12.700> think<00:03:13.239> a<00:03:13.269> shooting<00:03:13.569> bit

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
Center 7 passing I think a shooting bit

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.030 
Center 7 passing I think a shooting bit
should<00:03:13.959> be<00:03:14.049> a<00:03:14.079> lot<00:03:14.349> more<00:03:14.379> than<00:03:14.560> that<00:03:14.709> some<00:03:14.950> of

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
should be a lot more than that some of

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.199 
should be a lot more than that some of
the<00:03:15.099> goals<00:03:15.250> he<00:03:15.340> scored<00:03:15.400> have<00:03:15.760> been<00:03:15.879> absolute

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
the goals he scored have been absolute

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:17.729 
the goals he scored have been absolute
sensational<00:03:16.870> sewing<00:03:17.409> it's<00:03:17.530> pretty

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739 
sensational sewing it's pretty

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:19.349 
sensational sewing it's pretty
ridiculous<00:03:17.950> that<00:03:18.250> as<00:03:18.370> shooting<00:03:18.639> as<00:03:18.730> only<00:03:18.909> 63

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:19.359 
ridiculous that as shooting as only 63

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:22.710 
ridiculous that as shooting as only 63
should<00:03:19.629> be<00:03:19.750> at<00:03:19.840> least<00:03:19.900> 70<00:03:20.560> even<00:03:21.720> 75-77

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
should be at least 70 even 75-77

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.990 
should be at least 70 even 75-77
somewhere<00:03:23.169> around<00:03:23.230> that<00:03:23.500> mark<00:03:23.819> but<00:03:24.819> yeah

overall<00:03:25.480> this<00:03:26.079> guy's<00:03:26.319> a<00:03:26.349> bit<00:03:26.560> of<00:03:26.620> an<00:03:26.709> if<00:03:26.799> you

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:26.859 
overall this guy's a bit of an if you

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:28.800

one<00:03:27.010> like<00:03:27.220> it<00:03:27.400> he<00:03:27.790> could<00:03:28.000> get<00:03:28.150> another<00:03:28.329> inform

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:30.960 
one like it he could get another inform
you<00:03:29.650> know<00:03:29.739> it's<00:03:30.099> very<00:03:30.280> very<00:03:30.519> likely<00:03:30.699> that<00:03:30.849> i

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
you know it's very very likely that i

00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:36.069 
good one to buy and because he's kind of

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:38.099 
good one to buy and because he's kind of
like<00:03:36.159> a<00:03:36.220> cheap<00:03:36.489> inform<00:03:37.329> right<00:03:37.510> back<00:03:37.720> from

like a cheap inform right back from
Brazil<00:03:39.040> even<00:03:39.699> though<00:03:39.819> there<00:03:39.970> was<00:03:40.120> another<00:03:40.359> I

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
Brazil even though there was another I

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.180 
Brazil even though there was another I
think<00:03:41.079> I<00:03:41.139> was<00:03:41.230> it<00:03:41.349> informed<00:03:41.680> Annie<00:03:41.859> low<00:03:42.010> that

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 
think I was it informed Annie low that

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:44.039 
think I was it informed Annie low that
came<00:03:42.370> out<00:03:42.519> the<00:03:42.639> other<00:03:42.669> week<00:03:42.940> this<00:03:43.750> guy's<00:03:43.900> from

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:45.479 
came out the other week this guy's from
the<00:03:44.109> box<00:03:44.319> from<00:03:44.530> league<00:03:44.769> and<00:03:44.949> he's<00:03:45.040> you<00:03:45.370> know<00:03:45.400> I

this<00:03:48.909> moment<00:03:49.090> in<00:03:49.239> time<00:03:49.269> so<00:03:49.690> it<00:03:49.959> is<00:03:50.319> worth<00:03:50.530> a

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
this moment in time so it is worth a

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.490 
this moment in time so it is worth a
shot<00:03:50.680> maybe<00:03:51.040> picking<00:03:51.459> up<00:03:51.579> this<00:03:51.699> guy<00:03:52.379> you<00:03:53.379> know
