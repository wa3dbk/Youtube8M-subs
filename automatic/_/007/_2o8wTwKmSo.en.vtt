me
realistically<00:01:11.700> I'm<00:01:12.030> never<00:01:12.420> going<00:01:12.780> to<00:01:12.810> own<00:01:13.229> one

realistically I'm never going to own one
of<00:01:13.560> them<00:01:13.729> I<00:01:15.049> could<00:01:16.049> probably<00:01:16.320> own<00:01:16.710> one<00:01:17.009> if<00:01:17.280> I

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
of them I could probably own one if I

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.480 
of them I could probably own one if I
won<00:01:18.030> it<00:01:18.180> from<00:01:18.509> somewhere<00:01:19.070> but<00:01:20.070> I'm<00:01:20.189> never

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
won it from somewhere but I'm never

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.740 
won it from somewhere but I'm never
going<00:01:20.880> to<00:01:20.909> ever<00:01:21.180> be<00:01:22.140> able<00:01:22.229> to<00:01:22.380> afford<00:01:22.560> one<00:01:23.009> so

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.750 
going to ever be able to afford one so

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.330 
going to ever be able to afford one so
it's<00:01:24.750> actually<00:01:24.930> technically<00:01:25.439> maybe<00:01:25.710> if<00:01:26.009> I<00:01:26.130> won

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
it's actually technically maybe if I won

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.289 
it's actually technically maybe if I won
the<00:01:26.490> lottery<00:01:26.520> I'd<00:01:27.330> be<00:01:27.540> able<00:01:27.689> to<00:01:27.780> afford<00:01:27.869> on<00:01:29.299> so

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
the lottery I'd be able to afford on so

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.350 
the lottery I'd be able to afford on so
I<00:01:30.570> might<00:01:31.310> be<00:01:32.310> able<00:01:32.460> to<00:01:32.549> afford<00:01:32.729> it<00:01:32.850> at<00:01:33.030> some

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
I might be able to afford it at some

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.240 
I might be able to afford it at some
point<00:01:33.390> but<00:01:33.810> realistically<00:01:34.500> yeah

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
point but realistically yeah

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.910 
point but realistically yeah
so<00:01:36.240> yeah<00:01:36.479> I've<00:01:36.689> bought<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:36.960> v6<00:01:37.350> Sport<00:01:37.619> and<00:01:37.799> I

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
so yeah I've bought the v6 Sport and I

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.289 
so yeah I've bought the v6 Sport and I
tuned<00:01:38.369> it<00:01:38.520> up<00:01:38.640> and<00:01:39.049> that<00:01:40.049> car<00:01:40.290> goes

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:41.299 
tuned it up and that car goes

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:44.630 
tuned it up and that car goes
acceleration<00:01:42.299> is<00:01:42.390> a<00:01:42.420> little<00:01:42.720> bad<00:01:42.869> but<00:01:43.649> once<00:01:44.490> it

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
acceleration is a little bad but once it

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.210 
acceleration is a little bad but once it
hits<00:01:44.820> top<00:01:45.000> speed<00:01:45.329> it<00:01:45.990> just<00:01:46.229> out<00:01:46.439> classes<00:01:46.979> and

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
hits top speed it just out classes and

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.100 
hits top speed it just out classes and
most<00:01:47.549> of<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:47.880> events<00:01:48.360> that<00:01:48.630> I'm<00:01:48.720> doing<00:01:48.869> at<00:01:49.049> the

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
most of the events that I'm doing at the

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.800 
most of the events that I'm doing at the
moment<00:01:49.229> and<00:01:50.240> this<00:01:51.240> is<00:01:51.299> another<00:01:51.540> thing<00:01:51.689> I<00:01:51.750> was

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
moment and this is another thing I was

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.929 
moment and this is another thing I was
going<00:01:51.930> to<00:01:52.049> talk<00:01:52.140> about<00:01:52.290> was<00:01:53.810> that<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:55.619> AI<00:01:56.430> and

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
going to talk about was that the AI and

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.120 
going to talk about was that the AI and
it<00:01:57.479> seems<00:01:57.719> if<00:01:57.930> you<00:01:58.049> find<00:01:58.290> a<00:01:58.409> really<00:01:58.619> good<00:01:58.860> car

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
it seems if you find a really good car

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.760 
it seems if you find a really good car
that<00:01:59.340> you<00:01:59.399> can<00:01:59.579> intervention<00:02:00.360> to<00:02:00.600> and<00:02:00.899> the<00:02:01.500> IOA

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
that you can intervention to and the IOA

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.830 
that you can intervention to and the IOA
tends<00:02:02.280> to<00:02:02.430> be<00:02:02.549> a<00:02:02.579> little<00:02:02.759> bit<00:02:02.969> easier<00:02:03.360> you<00:02:03.570> find

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
tends to be a little bit easier you find

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:04.810 
tends to be a little bit easier you find
it<00:02:03.960> a<00:02:04.020> lot<00:02:04.110> easier

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820 
it a lot easier

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.220 
driving simulator it's not been a racing
simulator<00:02:23.520> and<00:02:24.239> you<00:02:24.840> thought<00:02:24.989> this

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
simulator and you thought this

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.530 
simulator and you thought this
simulation<00:02:25.709> or<00:02:25.950> driving<00:02:26.220> it<00:02:26.459> it<00:02:27.030> sort<00:02:27.239> of<00:02:27.270> kV

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
simulation or driving it it sort of kV

aspect of like yeah I'm actually a good

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.330 
aspect of like yeah I'm actually a good
driver<00:02:32.580> and<00:02:32.880> I<00:02:32.940> never<00:02:33.120> realized<00:02:33.660> that<00:02:33.900> um<00:02:34.590> you

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
driver and I never realized that um you

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:36.380 
driver and I never realized that um you
should<00:02:35.459> have<00:02:35.550> had<00:02:35.640> this<00:02:35.760> dream<00:02:36.060> that<00:02:36.120> you

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
should have had this dream that you

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.330 
should have had this dream that you
could<00:02:36.600> drive<00:02:36.989> any<00:02:37.260> car<00:02:37.350> and<00:02:37.769> stuff<00:02:37.950> like<00:02:38.160> that

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.580 
could drive any car and stuff like that
but<00:02:38.550> it's<00:02:39.330> not<00:02:39.480> really<00:02:39.660> a<00:02:39.690> technically<00:02:40.530> a

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
but it's not really a technically a

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.390 
but it's not really a technically a
racing<00:02:41.130> simulator<00:02:42.380> and<00:02:43.380> I<00:02:43.500> just<00:02:43.709> crashed<00:02:44.040> hell

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
racing simulator and I just crashed hell

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.870 
racing simulator and I just crashed hell
yeah

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
yeah

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.970 
yeah
this<00:02:45.420> is<00:02:45.540> how<00:02:45.660> the<00:02:45.720> pros<00:02:45.989> do<00:02:46.170> it<00:02:46.200> guys<00:02:46.440> in<00:02:46.860> case

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
this is how the pros do it guys in case

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.290 
this is how the pros do it guys in case
you<00:02:47.100> don't<00:02:47.190> know<00:02:47.340> you've<00:02:47.580> got<00:02:47.700> a<00:02:47.730> like<00:02:47.970> if

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
you don't know you've got a like if

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:49.930

so I lost my train of thought so anyway

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:36.350 
so I lost my train of thought so anyway
the<00:04:35.280> train<00:04:35.460> of<00:04:35.580> thought<00:04:35.610> Bart<00:04:35.880> was<00:04:36.030> on<00:04:36.180> was

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
the train of thought Bart was on was

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:37.640 
the train of thought Bart was on was
that<00:04:36.390> the<00:04:36.600> fact<00:04:36.750> that<00:04:36.870> this<00:04:37.050> was<00:04:37.230> a<00:04:37.320> driving

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 
that the fact that this was a driving

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:39.890 
that the fact that this was a driving
simulator<00:04:37.890> and<00:04:38.250> not<00:04:38.400> necessarily<00:04:38.850> a<00:04:39.180> racing

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:39.900 
simulator and not necessarily a racing

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:41.480 
simulator and not necessarily a racing
simulator<00:04:40.190> but<00:04:41.190> if<00:04:41.250> they're<00:04:41.340> going<00:04:41.430> to

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
simulator but if they're going to

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:42.830 
simulator but if they're going to
erasing<00:04:41.790> it<00:04:42.060> you<00:04:42.150> kind<00:04:42.390> of<00:04:42.420> feel<00:04:42.630> that<00:04:42.660> AI

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 
erasing it you kind of feel that AI

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.290 
erasing it you kind of feel that AI
needs<00:04:43.230> to<00:04:43.380> be<00:04:43.500> you<00:04:44.160> know<00:04:44.280> top<00:04:44.520> notch<00:04:44.730> but<00:04:45.030> still

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300 
needs to be you know top notch but still

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.420 
needs to be you know top notch but still
