by sunlight when you have the lack of
vitamin<00:01:39.659> D<00:01:40.020> you<00:01:40.049> develop<00:01:40.650> any<00:01:40.860> kind<00:01:41.040> of

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
vitamin D you develop any kind of

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.999 
vitamin D you develop any kind of
deficiency<00:01:41.880> because<00:01:42.030> vitamin<00:01:42.479> D<00:01:42.810> is<00:01:42.960> just<00:01:43.920> a

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
deficiency because vitamin D is just a

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.899 
deficiency because vitamin D is just a
fundamental<00:01:44.250> element<00:01:44.850> for<00:01:45.570> our<00:01:45.689> health<00:01:45.960> and

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:46.909 
fundamental element for our health and

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:50.149 
fundamental element for our health and
vitamin<00:01:47.909> D<00:01:48.060> prevents<00:01:48.750> us<00:01:48.930> from<00:01:48.960> getting<00:01:49.740> skin

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
vitamin D prevents us from getting skin

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.090 
vitamin D prevents us from getting skin
cancer<00:01:50.509> so<00:01:51.509> if<00:01:51.750> you<00:01:51.840> don't<00:01:52.049> have<00:01:52.229> sunlight<00:01:52.560> and

cancer so if you don't have sunlight and

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.179 
cancer so if you don't have sunlight and
you<00:01:53.280> don't<00:01:53.460> produce<00:01:53.579> vitamin<00:01:54.180> D<00:01:54.420> you

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:55.189 
you don't produce vitamin D you

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:57.560 
you don't produce vitamin D you
automatically<00:01:56.189> have<00:01:56.340> a<00:01:56.369> problem<00:01:56.850> but<00:01:57.420> the
