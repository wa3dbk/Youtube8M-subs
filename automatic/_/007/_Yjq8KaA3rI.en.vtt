shorts and a polo shirt with slippers

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.360 
shorts and a polo shirt with slippers
which<00:02:19.480> was<00:02:19.630> perfectly<00:02:20.080> acceptable<00:02:20.250> but<00:02:21.250> I

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
which was perfectly acceptable but I

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.600 
which was perfectly acceptable but I
still<00:02:21.670> looked<00:02:22.510> presentable<00:02:23.019> so<00:02:23.610> just

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
still looked presentable so just

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:25.830 
still looked presentable so just
something<00:02:24.760> you<00:02:24.910> want<00:02:25.060> to<00:02:25.120> keep<00:02:25.269> in<00:02:25.390> mind<00:02:25.569> when

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
something you want to keep in mind when

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.180 
something you want to keep in mind when
you're<00:02:25.989> talking<00:02:26.290> to<00:02:26.319> coaches<00:02:26.590> and<00:02:26.769> making

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
you're talking to coaches and making

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.339 
you're talking to coaches and making
your<00:02:27.310> visits<00:02:27.700> to<00:02:27.880> different<00:02:28.000> colleges<00:02:28.690> you

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:29.349 
your visits to different colleges you

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:31.440 
your visits to different colleges you
know<00:02:29.380> a<00:02:29.500> lot<00:02:29.709> of<00:02:29.739> times<00:02:30.040> there's<00:02:30.970> a<00:02:31.030> lot<00:02:31.360> of

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
know a lot of times there's a lot of

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.090 
know a lot of times there's a lot of
players<00:02:31.599> that<00:02:31.780> have<00:02:31.900> questions<00:02:32.349> about<00:02:32.680> how<00:02:32.860> to

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
players that have questions about how to

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.699 
players that have questions about how to
do<00:02:33.310> this<00:02:33.549> or<00:02:33.880> how<00:02:34.060> can<00:02:34.750> they<00:02:34.870> do<00:02:34.989> that<00:02:35.230> and<00:02:35.530> I

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
do this or how can they do that and I

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:39.289 
do this or how can they do that and I
think<00:02:36.310> that<00:02:36.970> coaches<00:02:37.930> you<00:02:38.380> know<00:02:38.500> are<00:02:38.560> very

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:39.299 
think that coaches you know are very

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:43.710 
think that coaches you know are very
most<00:02:40.299> of<00:02:40.510> them<00:02:40.660> are<00:02:41.640> pretty<00:02:42.640> willing<00:02:43.120> and<00:02:43.360> they

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
most of them are pretty willing and they

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.509 
most of them are pretty willing and they
want<00:02:43.930> to<00:02:44.080> help<00:02:44.200> you<00:02:44.410> in<00:02:44.470> any<00:02:44.620> way<00:02:44.709> they<00:02:44.799> can<00:02:44.980> and

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 
want to help you in any way they can and

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:47.550 
want to help you in any way they can and
a<00:02:46.239> lot<00:02:46.390> of<00:02:46.420> times<00:02:46.630> it's<00:02:46.930> just<00:02:46.989> because<00:02:47.410> they

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
a lot of times it's just because they

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.339 
a lot of times it's just because they
don't<00:02:47.680> know<00:02:47.799> unless<00:02:48.250> you<00:02:48.489> ask<00:02:48.930> the<00:02:49.930> question

00:02:50.339 --> 00:02:50.349 
don't know unless you ask the question

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:51.720 
don't know unless you ask the question
and<00:02:50.560> I<00:02:50.769> think<00:02:50.980> they'll<00:02:51.130> be<00:02:51.250> more<00:02:51.430> than<00:02:51.549> willing

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
and I think they'll be more than willing

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:56.430 
and I think they'll be more than willing
to<00:02:51.880> help<00:02:51.970> you<00:02:54.180> whether<00:02:55.180> it's<00:02:55.390> with<00:02:55.630> school<00:02:55.959> or

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
to help you whether it's with school or

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.940 
to help you whether it's with school or
with<00:02:57.130> football<00:02:57.610> or<00:02:58.120> whatever<00:02:59.019> sport<00:02:59.440> just

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
with football or whatever sport just

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.440 
with football or whatever sport just
working<00:03:00.340> out<00:03:00.519> how<00:03:01.420> you<00:03:01.480> can<00:03:01.780> better<00:03:01.959> yourself

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
working out how you can better yourself

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:09.479 
working out how you can better yourself
in<00:03:04.450> the<00:03:05.079> sport<00:03:05.470> that<00:03:05.650> you're<00:03:05.769> playing<00:03:06.510> I<00:03:08.489> guess

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:09.489 
in the sport that you're playing I guess

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:12.330 
in the sport that you're playing I guess
have<00:03:09.970> the<00:03:10.150> courage<00:03:10.570> I<00:03:10.959> know<00:03:11.709> for<00:03:11.920> me<00:03:12.070> growing

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
have the courage I know for me growing

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.120 
have the courage I know for me growing
up<00:03:12.609> is<00:03:12.820> even<00:03:13.420> for<00:03:13.600> myself<00:03:13.959> is<00:03:14.170> difficult<00:03:14.859> to

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.130 
up is even for myself is difficult to

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:19.820 
up is even for myself is difficult to
really<00:03:16.120> talk<00:03:16.359> to<00:03:16.569> the<00:03:16.660> coaches

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:23.280 

not<00:03:20.830> so<00:03:21.010> much<00:03:21.160> the<00:03:21.640> coaches<00:03:22.060> I<00:03:22.390> guess<00:03:22.810> more<00:03:23.050> so

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
not so much the coaches I guess more so

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.370 
not so much the coaches I guess more so
is<00:03:23.710> this<00:03:23.980> myself<00:03:24.460> and<00:03:24.790> my<00:03:25.330> personality<00:03:25.780> I<00:03:26.080> just

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
is this myself and my personality I just

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.730 
is this myself and my personality I just
kind<00:03:26.620> of<00:03:26.730> didn't<00:03:27.730> wanna<00:03:28.290> ask<00:03:29.290> too<00:03:29.650> many

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:29.740 
kind of didn't wanna ask too many

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:32.700 
kind of didn't wanna ask too many
questions<00:03:29.890> I<00:03:30.460> guess<00:03:30.640> but<00:03:30.820> I<00:03:30.880> think<00:03:31.320> asking<00:03:32.320> a

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:32.710 
questions I guess but I think asking a

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:34.560 
questions I guess but I think asking a
lot<00:03:32.860> of<00:03:32.890> questions<00:03:33.010> is<00:03:33.460> better<00:03:33.730> than<00:03:34.000> asking

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:34.570 
lot of questions is better than asking

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:39.410 
lot of questions is better than asking
no<00:03:34.720> questions<00:03:35.230> and<00:03:35.500> trying<00:03:36.280> to<00:03:36.370> figure<00:03:36.670> out

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.490 

everything<00:03:40.420> this<00:03:40.540> is<00:03:40.660> a<00:03:40.720> it's<00:03:41.110> a<00:03:41.200> totally

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
everything this is a it's a totally

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:42.930 
everything this is a it's a totally
different<00:03:41.560> world<00:03:41.890> out<00:03:42.220> there<00:03:42.250> and<00:03:42.610> the<00:03:42.700> fear

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
different world out there and the fear

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.960
