gonna be able to want to be able to boy

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.819 
gonna be able to want to be able to boy
for<00:00:36.480> those<00:00:36.630> tricks<00:00:36.930> pretty<00:00:37.380> comfortably

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
for those tricks pretty comfortably

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.799 
for those tricks pretty comfortably
before<00:00:38.489> you<00:00:38.579> attempt<00:00:39.090> mitch<00:00:39.480> around<00:00:39.750> the

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
before you attempt mitch around the

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.560 
before you attempt mitch around the
world<00:00:39.989> so<00:00:40.590> inside<00:00:41.040> a<00:00:41.070> ramrod<00:00:41.309> and<00:00:41.790> crossover

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
world so inside a ramrod and crossover

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:49.910 
world so inside a ramrod and crossover
and<00:00:42.750> they<00:00:42.840> look<00:00:43.020> like<00:00:43.200> this<00:00:48.200> okay<00:00:49.200> so<00:00:49.260> if<00:00:49.800> you

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
and they look like this okay so if you

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.979 
and they look like this okay so if you
can't<00:00:50.129> do<00:00:50.280> those<00:00:50.430> two<00:00:50.700> tricks<00:00:51.000> just<00:00:51.600> go<00:00:51.780> onto

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
can't do those two tricks just go onto

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.180 
can't do those two tricks just go onto
my<00:00:52.020> profile<00:00:52.559> and<00:00:53.000> asked<00:00:54.000> or<00:00:54.149> else<00:00:54.360> to<00:00:54.480> them<00:00:54.600> so

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.190 
my profile and asked or else to them so

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.770 
my profile and asked or else to them so
check<00:00:56.190> them<00:00:56.370> out<00:00:56.430> learn<00:00:56.789> them<00:00:57.059> and<00:00:57.270> then<00:00:57.480> once

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
check them out learn them and then once

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:58.849 
check them out learn them and then once
you're<00:00:57.899> comfortable<00:00:58.020> with<00:00:58.289> them<00:00:58.469> then<00:00:58.770> you

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
you're comfortable with them then you

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.040 
you're comfortable with them then you
can<00:00:58.980> come<00:00:59.129> back<00:00:59.160> to<00:00:59.430> this<00:00:59.489> tutorial<00:00:59.870> but<00:01:00.870> if

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
can come back to this tutorial but if

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.810 
can come back to this tutorial but if
you<00:01:01.140> already<00:01:01.260> can<00:01:01.530> do<00:01:01.680> them<00:01:01.859> then<00:01:02.160> let's<00:01:02.640> move

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
you already can do them then let's move

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.270 
you already can do them then let's move
on<00:01:03.000> to<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.449> next<00:01:03.660> step<00:01:03.930> okay<00:01:04.650> so<00:01:04.769> now<00:01:05.129> you've

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
on to the next step okay so now you've

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.800 
on to the next step okay so now you've
got<00:01:05.400> those<00:01:05.549> two<00:01:05.970> new<00:01:06.060> tricks<00:01:06.330> you<00:01:06.450> want<00:01:06.600> to<00:01:06.659> mix

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
got those two new tricks you want to mix

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.289 
got those two new tricks you want to mix
them<00:01:06.900> together<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:07.619> do<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.460> Michie<00:01:08.729> run<00:01:09.060> WOD

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
them together and do the Michie run WOD

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.570 
them together and do the Michie run WOD
so<00:01:09.780> it's<00:01:09.930> a<00:01:10.140> inside<00:01:10.770> run<00:01:10.979> wild<00:01:11.280> and<00:01:11.340> crossed

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
so it's a inside run wild and crossed

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.600 
so it's a inside run wild and crossed
over<00:01:11.760> in<00:01:12.150> one<00:01:12.330> motion<00:01:12.650> now<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:14.189> first<00:01:14.460> thing

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
over in one motion now the first thing

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:15.710 
over in one motion now the first thing
you're<00:01:14.729> going<00:01:14.880> to<00:01:14.939> notice<00:01:15.090> when<00:01:15.299> attempting

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
you're going to notice when attempting

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.990 
you're going to notice when attempting
it<00:01:16.020> is<00:01:16.170> that<00:01:16.439> your<00:01:16.560> timings<00:01:17.009> going<00:01:17.159> to<00:01:17.220> be<00:01:17.369> all

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
it is that your timings going to be all

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.600 
it is that your timings going to be all
over<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.299> place<00:01:18.420> might<00:01:19.290> tend<00:01:19.500> to<00:01:19.619> find<00:01:20.430> that

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
over the place might tend to find that

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.249 
over the place might tend to find that
one<00:01:20.820> of<00:01:20.850> those<00:01:21.030> letting<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.570> mixture<00:01:21.869> on<00:01:22.020> Lord

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
one of those letting the mixture on Lord

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.260 
one of those letting the mixture on Lord
seemed<00:01:22.920> a<00:01:23.009> lot<00:01:23.159> more<00:01:23.189> scarier<00:01:23.850> I<00:01:24.030> don't<00:01:24.210> know

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
seemed a lot more scarier I don't know

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.960 
seemed a lot more scarier I don't know
why<00:01:24.479> because<00:01:24.780> maybe<00:01:25.710> because<00:01:25.799> I<00:01:26.040> do<00:01:26.310> outside

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
why because maybe because I do outside

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.569 
why because maybe because I do outside
around<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.330> walls<00:01:27.509> usually<00:01:28.070> but<00:01:29.070> yeah<00:01:29.430> and<00:01:29.549> I

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
around the walls usually but yeah and I

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.179 
around the walls usually but yeah and I
was<00:01:29.729> just<00:01:29.850> one<00:01:30.450> thing<00:01:30.689> that<00:01:30.900> I<00:01:30.930> was<00:01:31.710> afraid<00:01:31.950> of

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
was just one thing that I was afraid of

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.249 
was just one thing that I was afraid of
I<00:01:32.310> was<00:01:32.430> afraid<00:01:32.579> of<00:01:32.700> falling<00:01:32.909> over<00:01:33.270> so<00:01:33.930> if

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
I was afraid of falling over so if

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.990 
I was afraid of falling over so if
you're<00:01:34.740> afraid<00:01:34.979> of<00:01:35.070> that<00:01:35.220> just<00:01:35.520> practice<00:01:35.909> on

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
you're afraid of that just practice on

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.539 
you're afraid of that just practice on
the<00:01:36.119> grass<00:01:36.450> and<00:01:36.810> try<00:01:37.020> and<00:01:37.140> block<00:01:37.290> it<00:01:37.470> out<00:01:37.619> but

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
the grass and try and block it out but

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.340 
the grass and try and block it out but
yeah<00:01:38.850> you're<00:01:39.090> going<00:01:39.210> to<00:01:39.270> do<00:01:39.420> an<00:01:39.750> insider<00:01:40.170> on

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
yeah you're going to do an insider on

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.499 
yeah you're going to do an insider on
Wat<00:01:40.590> and<00:01:41.220> when<00:01:41.520> you<00:01:41.610> get<00:01:41.759> free<00:01:42.000> quarters<00:01:42.360> of

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
the way around or maybe not free quads

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.300 
the way around or maybe not free quads
are<00:01:44.939> around<00:01:45.229> sort<00:01:46.229> of<00:01:46.320> like<00:01:46.500> just<00:01:47.100> past

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
advice I would say is um keep the ball

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.729 
advice I would say is um keep the ball
very<00:02:35.519> centered<00:02:36.090> with<00:02:36.330> your<00:02:36.450> body<00:02:36.660> don't<00:02:37.110> like

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
very centered with your body don't like

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:40.790 
very centered with your body don't like
spinning<00:02:38.280> off<00:02:38.400> to<00:02:38.580> the<00:02:38.640> side<00:02:38.910> or<00:02:39.620> keep<00:02:40.620> too

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
spinning off to the side or keep too

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.440 
high you want to keep it very centered
and<00:02:43.050> try<00:02:43.680> and<00:02:43.769> keep<00:02:43.860> the<00:02:43.980> ball<00:02:44.160> low<00:02:44.330> think<00:02:45.330> that

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
helps with the mitch around a lot if the

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:55.220 
helps with the mitch around a lot if the
