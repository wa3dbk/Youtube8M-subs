00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.680
 Explain how this exercise has been done 

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:06.520
 asks them that this one showed all his figures 

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:09.520
 these quantities that are expressed in scientific rotation 

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:11.599
 as we see 

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:15.769
 the first case I know how I haiti five poles raised to 8 make a front 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:16.999
 positive 

00:00:16.999 --> 00:00:19.489
 it is a large amount 

00:00:19.489 --> 00:00:22.489
 so what we have to do is multiply 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.800
 I can not say anything and scientific these 25 a part the coefficient 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.800
 by the university of eight zeros 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.800
 so we have to shift the comma eight places 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:38.320
 if from mac and the result what has been done from the pse like to 25 the 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.320
 I was standing the follow up asia of payment some 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.650
 and we have had a bath and sincere map which has moved eight places 1 2 3 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:50.390
 4 5 6 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.130
 7 and done 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:56.130
 separate the case d 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:01.650
 which is 5 as 18 times 10 raised to 14 is the same is a very large amount 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.940
 because you still profit by the university of 14 zeros 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.060
 and we have to fame as 14 places prosalta will also have to add 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.440
 two styles so that the amount I did not want that day 5 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.020
 1 8 and then added 12 more zeros 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.660
 that would be the equivalent amount issued as to its figures equivalent to 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.450
 5 28 why this Saturday 14 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.570
 the example in the case once 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.590
 so we have negative west 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.530
 this is not going to indicate she is a small amount we have to move 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:31.350
 comma 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.610
 four places asia the left 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.330
 so that in a gravel slope two we have to add 3 0 ahead to 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.220
 that four places can be moved 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.720
 3 and 4 and that is to be the result 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.820
 in the case in 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.180
 so we have 10 raised to -9 is also a negative exponent is also 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.060
 a small amount after the day like this one should note that the 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.920
 left 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.979
 and as stable of grant the 3 for to move nine places I think that 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:01.270
 have willing to do ahead of Messi 1 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.670
 3 4 5 6 7 8 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.459
 the result equivalent to 3 as to 25 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:12.839
 3com to 215 model to verÃ³n 9 

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:14.199
 but eat 

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:17.069
 0 0 0 0 0 0 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:19.409
