quickly<00:01:40.409> now<00:01:41.400> I<00:01:41.430> do<00:01:41.729> think<00:01:41.909> it<00:01:42.210> was<00:01:42.270> a

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
quickly now I do think it was a

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.090 
quickly now I do think it was a
premature<00:01:42.630> stoppage<00:01:43.140> considering<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:43.920> fact

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
premature stoppage considering the fact

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.980 
premature stoppage considering the fact
that<00:01:44.130> toreano<00:01:44.549> Johnson<00:01:45.000> was<00:01:45.149> obviously<00:01:45.689> ahead

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
that toreano Johnson was obviously ahead

but
and<00:02:13.599> it<00:02:13.690> wasn't<00:02:13.840> to<00:02:14.050> be<00:02:14.230> and<00:02:15.750> from<00:02:16.750> just<00:02:17.140> in<00:02:17.230> my

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:17.379 
and it wasn't to be and from just in my

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:20.040 
and it wasn't to be and from just in my
opinion<00:02:17.500> I<00:02:17.860> think<00:02:17.890> that<00:02:18.250> the<00:02:18.310> referee<00:02:19.050> did

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
opinion I think that the referee did

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:21.630 
opinion I think that the referee did
coach<00:02:20.319> Johnson<00:02:20.739> a<00:02:20.800> favor<00:02:21.040> and<00:02:21.370> I<00:02:21.400> think<00:02:21.580> the

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
coach Johnson a favor and I think the

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.850 
coach Johnson a favor and I think the
referee<00:02:22.060> was<00:02:22.239> hoping<00:02:22.989> to<00:02:23.140> do<00:02:23.230> coasters<00:02:23.709> and

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860
