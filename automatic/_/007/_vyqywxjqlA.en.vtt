00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.899
 we are in france and this is a new peugeot 308 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.179
 and I imitate Mikhail one of those 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.040
 who was lucky to be the first to see this 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:11.849
 car i'm not mistaken this 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.059
 exactly 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:17.570
 peugeot 308 and this is exactly the new peugeot 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.850
 308 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:23.340
 henceforth and in this sense perhaps this 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.230
 the main innovation of this car is everything 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.390
 new at least cars 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.029
 Peugeot cars will be called 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.949
 also that is the next generation of this 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.719
 car car was a golf class 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:39.170
 will also be called peugeot 308 

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:45.120
 as for design if you are familiar with 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:48.180
 the previous 300 eighth it is the most 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.670
 plain hatchback golf class 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.920
 in this case for all the time 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:01:00.690
 peugeot releases hatchbacks 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:01:02.520
 but the interior I liked the fight very much 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.530
 succinctly and most importantly instantly 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.510
 there is no characteristic may be for 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:11.909
 french car feeling 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:15.600
 as a steering wheel it is small 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:18.000
 below and the devices are above the wheel and from 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.729
 This creates a feeling like you but 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.310
 play playstation that's probably 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:26.390
 the most important thing and imagine it 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.390
 seemed comfortable 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.930
 mercedes and belgian 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:45.630
 Devices also have their own fishechka but not 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.819
 sure how practical it is 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:53.280
 we have now solved the engine ourselves 

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:55.709
 See here it is a tachometer and it will be 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:02:04.079
 rotate counterclockwise as far as 

00:01:55.709 --> 00:02:07.469
 gaining momentum in terms of impressions 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:10.259
 stars time but maybe 5 years ago 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:12.240
 my son who was then 8 to 9 years 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.310
 he then 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.740
 quite attentive read by the author and 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.840
 the artist stop being more attentive than me and 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:21.120
 he once asked me dad here 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.370
 Here you wrote that management 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.710
 car like reminds game in 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:28.140
 playstation i just didn't get it 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:30.780
 good or bad but essentially varnish so far 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:33.420
 blocking is rather bad but I when 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:36.990
 tried to explain what's up in this 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:40.260
 case rather poorly, and you know if 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:43.440
 this question was raised today I would 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:46.980
 probably already changed the answer I would say 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:49.860
 probably it is good and here is peugeot 308 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:52.530
 maybe not the very first car but 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.690
 who is his own behavior 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.540
 power response to 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.030
 pedals mainly 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.640
 on the steering wheel 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:03.819
 he confirmed like a crystal blockage 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:06.300
 this new paradigm for the current 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:10.020
 generations for the younger generation 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:13.750
 Good car buyers will be the one 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:15.520
 which goes as he drove 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:18.069
 virtual car let's say on 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:21.760
 playstation or on some kind of computer 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:24.580
 the game that is peugeot 308 is so good 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:27.610
 what to manage it like playing 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:30.040
 playstation but i'm for sure all 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:32.680
 done great you will not find 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:35.110
 those delights that say but have reached 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:37.630
 apogee in peugeot 306 when you could 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:40.630
 playing with gas and changing this one 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:43.810
 virtually change to turn radius 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:46.630
 it does everything right and if you can 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:48.670
 it would be at first to complain 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:51.940
 oh something a little reactive action 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:54.190
 something i don't feel anything like that 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.750
 To the extent that I rode I understood 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.910
 that on the one hand thanks very much 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:58.989
 good chassis settings limits very 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:01.630
 great from 1 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:03.549
 and when you really get close to 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:04.810
 this limit when the car is about to 

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:07.780
 will begin to slide 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:11.410
 there is both a reactive action and a complete 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:14.769
 understanding of what happens when 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:17.320
 year, the peugeot 308 definitely won't appear in 

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:19.539
 Russia, I'm talking about the new 308 at its best 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:22.870
 case next year prices are understandable 

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:24.729
 also unknown yet but in france they 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:28.000
 even new tricky you say a little bit 

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:29.530
 that the new 308 is worth a little less 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.289
 predecessor but this is due to the fact 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:34.330
 that appeared a little three-cylinder 

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:36.880
 we have a motor chick under the hood 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:39.190
 there will be no total 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:41.410
 will be as always the car can 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:45.810
 sell another product for money 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:45.810
 who will be willing to pay for it
