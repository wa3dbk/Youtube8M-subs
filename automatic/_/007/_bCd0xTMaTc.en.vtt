through other aspects that are really

through other aspects that are really
made<00:00:43.260> out<00:00:43.470> of<00:00:43.740> water<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.670> reason<00:00:45.060> why<00:00:45.180> water

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
made out of water the reason why water

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.360 
made out of water the reason why water
is<00:00:45.570> so<00:00:45.870> important<00:00:46.410> to<00:00:46.530> our<00:00:46.590> health<00:00:46.890> especially

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
is so important to our health especially

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.820 
is so important to our health especially
in<00:00:47.790> these<00:00:47.940> days<00:00:48.270> is<00:00:49.110> that<00:00:49.170> probably<00:00:49.620> the

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:49.830 
in these days is that probably the

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:52.460 
in these days is that probably the
majority<00:00:50.310> of<00:00:50.790> people<00:00:51.270> are<00:00:51.470> chronically

majority of people are chronically

dehydrated chronically do not drink
enough<00:00:55.950> water<00:00:56.490> on<00:00:56.910> a<00:00:56.970> regular<00:00:57.600> basis<00:00:58.290> and<00:00:58.590> why

00:00:58.940 --> 00:00:58.950 
enough water on a regular basis and why

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:01.310 
enough water on a regular basis and why
is<00:00:59.010> it<00:00:59.340> that<00:00:59.370> it's<00:00:59.640> so<00:00:59.850> important<00:01:00.390> why<00:01:00.810> is<00:01:01.080> it

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
is it that it's so important why is it

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.549 
is it that it's so important why is it
that<00:01:01.350> it's<00:01:01.650> a<00:01:01.770> problem<00:01:02.090> we<00:01:03.090> all<00:01:03.120> live<00:01:03.810> in<00:01:04.140> a

illnesses inflammation overheating is a
part<00:01:26.729> of<00:01:26.880> it<00:01:27.060> so<00:01:27.960> something<00:01:28.380> simple<00:01:28.950> and

00:01:29.059 --> 00:01:29.069 
part of it so something simple and

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:30.919 
part of it so something simple and
importance<00:01:29.609> that<00:01:29.729> we<00:01:29.819> can<00:01:30.119> do<00:01:30.299> is<00:01:30.509> simply

00:01:30.919 --> 00:01:30.929 
importance that we can do is simply

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:33.410 
importance that we can do is simply
drink<00:01:31.380> enough<00:01:31.770> water<00:01:32.009> maybe<00:01:32.729> between<00:01:33.119> eight

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
drink enough water maybe between eight

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.190 
drink enough water maybe between eight
cups<00:01:34.319> of<00:01:34.499> water<00:01:34.740> two<00:01:35.189> quotes<00:01:35.579> to<00:01:36.210> 16<00:01:36.719> cups<00:01:36.990> of

cups of water two quotes to 16 cups of

cups of water two quotes to 16 cups of
water<00:01:37.439> it<00:01:38.069> depends<00:01:38.579> on<00:01:38.639> our<00:01:38.759> age<00:01:39.119> on<00:01:39.569> our

00:01:40.129 --> 00:01:40.139 
water it depends on our age on our

00:01:40.139 --> 00:01:42.469 
water it depends on our age on our
activity<00:01:40.799> and<00:01:41.009> on<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:41.520> weather<00:01:41.729> we<00:01:42.329> of<00:01:42.450> course

activity and on the weather we of course

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.569 
activity and on the weather we of course
will<00:01:42.810> need<00:01:43.109> much<00:01:43.350> more<00:01:43.380> water<00:01:43.859> if<00:01:44.189> it's<00:01:44.340> very

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
will need much more water if it's very

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.999 
will need much more water if it's very
hot<00:01:44.789> outside<00:01:44.999> and<00:01:45.479> especially<00:01:46.170> if<00:01:46.439> it's<00:01:46.590> dry

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
hot outside and especially if it's dry

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.129 
hot outside and especially if it's dry
when<00:01:47.759> is<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:48.030> best<00:01:48.179> time<00:01:48.359> to<00:01:48.689> drink<00:01:48.929> water

00:01:49.129 --> 00:01:49.139 
when is the best time to drink water

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:51.949 
when is the best time to drink water
it's<00:01:49.889> best<00:01:50.280> to<00:01:50.490> drink<00:01:50.729> water<00:01:50.969> on<00:01:51.240> its<00:01:51.420> own<00:01:51.689> and

00:01:51.949 --> 00:01:51.959 
it's best to drink water on its own and

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:53.899 
it's best to drink water on its own and
not<00:01:52.380> to<00:01:52.530> drink<00:01:52.770> water<00:01:52.979> while<00:01:53.369> we<00:01:53.579> are<00:01:53.700> eating

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
not to drink water while we are eating

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.870 
not to drink water while we are eating
the<00:01:54.749> reason<00:01:55.109> is<00:01:55.319> that<00:01:55.590> when<00:01:56.189> we<00:01:56.369> drink<00:01:56.609> water

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
the reason is that when we drink water

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.529 
the reason is that when we drink water
while<00:01:57.240> we<00:01:57.450> are<00:01:57.569> eating<00:01:57.780> we<00:01:58.499> are<00:01:58.619> diluting<00:01:59.539> the

00:02:00.529 --> 00:02:00.539 
while we are eating we are diluting the

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:03.319 
while we are eating we are diluting the
juices<00:02:01.109> of<00:02:01.139> the<00:02:01.499> stomach<00:02:01.799> we<00:02:02.579> are<00:02:02.729> diluting

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
juices of the stomach we are diluting

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.629 
juices of the stomach we are diluting
the<00:02:03.479> digestive<00:02:04.049> enzymes<00:02:04.560> and<00:02:04.859> we<00:02:05.369> are<00:02:05.459> making

00:02:05.629 --> 00:02:05.639 
the digestive enzymes and we are making

00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:08.120 
the digestive enzymes and we are making
our<00:02:05.909> stomach<00:02:06.420> less<00:02:06.659> acidic<00:02:07.109> which<00:02:07.920> can

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
our stomach less acidic which can

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:09.949 
our stomach less acidic which can
interfere<00:02:08.280> with<00:02:08.910> the<00:02:09.000> digestion<00:02:09.450> of<00:02:09.690> food

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
interfere with the digestion of food

our first glass of water we suddenly

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.140 
our first glass of water we suddenly
feel<00:03:07.500> our<00:03:07.620> thirst<00:03:08.040> and<00:03:08.400> when<00:03:08.550> we're<00:03:08.760> doing<00:03:08.910> our

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
get stronger and then it's amazing we

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.160 
get stronger and then it's amazing we
may<00:03:14.430> find<00:03:14.700> out<00:03:14.820> that<00:03:14.850> we<00:03:15.060> can<00:03:15.090> ring<00:03:15.390> five<00:03:15.840> six

takes us to finally feel that we're not

goes away our body feels less tight we

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.240 
goes away our body feels less tight we

you<00:03:46.680> drink<00:03:46.980> these<00:03:47.220> you<00:03:47.489> actually<00:03:47.519> get<00:03:48.000> thirsty

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:48.300 
you drink these you actually get thirsty

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:50.960 
you drink these you actually get thirsty
and<00:03:48.780> the<00:03:49.380> reason<00:03:49.590> is<00:03:49.890> a<00:03:49.920> high<00:03:50.250> sugar<00:03:50.730> content

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
and the reason is a high sugar content

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.300 
and the reason is a high sugar content
the<00:03:51.930> highest<00:03:52.350> molarity<00:03:52.920> is<00:03:53.040> the<00:03:53.190> high

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
the highest molarity is the high

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.380 
the highest molarity is the high
concentration<00:03:54.209> it<00:03:54.720> utterly<00:03:55.110> will<00:03:55.320> pull<00:03:55.650> out

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:56.390 
concentration it utterly will pull out

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:59.420 
concentration it utterly will pull out
water<00:03:57.390> out<00:03:57.690> of<00:03:57.720> the<00:03:58.049> cells<00:03:58.350> instead<00:03:59.220> of

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
water out of the cells instead of

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.220 
water out of the cells instead of
allowing<00:03:59.700> the<00:04:00.090> water<00:04:00.239> that<00:04:00.510> we<00:04:00.660> drink<00:04:00.930> to<00:04:01.080> go

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
allowing the water that we drink to go

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.800 
allowing the water that we drink to go
into<00:04:01.500> the<00:04:01.769> cells<00:04:02.070> actually<00:04:02.880> creating<00:04:03.690> a

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
into the cells actually creating a

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.710 
into the cells actually creating a
greater<00:04:04.320> level<00:04:04.680> of<00:04:04.950> dehydration<00:04:05.510> so<00:04:06.510> there<00:04:06.690> is

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
greater level of dehydration so there is

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.760 
greater level of dehydration so there is
