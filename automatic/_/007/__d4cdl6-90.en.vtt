00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.050

realized<00:01:49.770> I<00:01:49.979> wrote<00:01:50.159> out<00:01:50.310> of<00:01:50.430> birthday<00:01:50.729> shampoo

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
realized I wrote out of birthday shampoo

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.060 
realized I wrote out of birthday shampoo
I<00:01:51.299> was<00:01:51.570> like<00:01:51.720> oh<00:01:51.899> it's<00:01:52.140> but<00:01:52.560> it<00:01:52.770> is<00:01:52.920> the

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
I was like oh it's but it is the

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.620 
I was like oh it's but it is the
basically<00:01:53.610> a<00:01:53.899> diluted<00:01:55.759> dye<00:01:56.759> that<00:01:57.240> you<00:01:57.299> put<00:01:57.540> in

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
basically a diluted dye that you put in

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.630 
basically a diluted dye that you put in
your<00:01:57.810> hair<00:01:58.020> we<00:01:58.500> know<00:01:58.590> when<00:01:58.680> you<00:01:58.710> wash<00:01:58.890> it<00:01:59.070> so<00:01:59.340> it

your hair we know when you wash it so it

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.160 
your hair we know when you wash it so it
keeps<00:02:00.180> the<00:02:00.360> color<00:02:00.509> without<00:02:00.719> you<00:02:00.960> know<00:02:01.079> having

to redo it so underneath my hair at the
moment<00:02:03.299> I<00:02:03.810> undo<00:02:04.079> all<00:02:04.259> the<00:02:04.320> pink<00:02:04.469> dye<00:02:04.590> I<00:02:04.860> have

include<00:02:07.079> a<00:02:07.229> picture<00:02:07.380> of<00:02:07.590> it<00:02:07.710> here

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
include a picture of it here

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.390 
include a picture of it here
and<00:02:09.300> yeah<00:02:09.450> I<00:02:09.480> have<00:02:09.830> very<00:02:10.830> very<00:02:10.950> blonde<00:02:11.250> hair

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
and yeah I have very very blonde hair

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.520 
and yeah I have very very blonde hair
anyway<00:02:11.700> so<00:02:11.760> I<00:02:11.940> knew<00:02:12.120> add<00:02:12.750> I<00:02:12.930> was<00:02:13.200> going<00:02:13.350> to<00:02:13.410> take

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
anyway so I knew add I was going to take

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.320 
anyway so I knew add I was going to take
quite<00:02:13.740> well<00:02:13.920> Anna<00:02:14.100> Anna<00:02:14.280> pastel<00:02:14.610> shade<00:02:14.790> and

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
quite well Anna Anna pastel shade and

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.710 
quite well Anna Anna pastel shade and
but<00:02:16.020> I<00:02:16.200> didn't<00:02:16.440> dilute<00:02:16.830> this<00:02:17.250> color<00:02:18.150> with<00:02:18.420> any

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
but I didn't dilute this color with any

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.390 
but I didn't dilute this color with any
sort<00:02:19.230> of<00:02:19.290> conditioner<00:02:19.860> I<00:02:19.890> think<00:02:20.130> this<00:02:20.220> is<00:02:20.340> the

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
sort of conditioner I think this is the

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.550 
sort of conditioner I think this is the
color<00:02:20.580> it<00:02:20.640> came<00:02:20.850> in<00:02:21.000> in<00:02:21.090> the<00:02:21.150> bottle

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
color it came in in the bottle

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.260 
color it came in in the bottle
essentially<00:02:22.560> what<00:02:22.680> I<00:02:22.740> did<00:02:22.770> was<00:02:23.220> I<00:02:23.580> separated

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
essentially what I did was I separated

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.150 
essentially what I did was I separated
my<00:02:24.480> hair<00:02:24.660> took<00:02:24.990> basically<00:02:25.470> the<00:02:25.620> underneath

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
my hair took basically the underneath

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:31.810 
my hair took basically the underneath
parts<00:02:27.050> and<00:02:28.880> put<00:02:29.880> dye<00:02:30.060> on<00:02:30.210> them<00:02:30.450> and<00:02:31.320> then

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
parts and put dye on them and then

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.100 
parts and put dye on them and then
literally<00:02:32.820> just<00:02:33.030> scratched<00:02:33.660> it<00:02:33.840> in<00:02:33.930> with

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
literally just scratched it in with

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.400 
literally just scratched it in with
gloved<00:02:34.740> hands<00:02:35.010> um<00:02:35.750> into<00:02:36.750> my<00:02:36.840> hair<00:02:37.020> rubbed<00:02:37.320> it

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
gloved hands um into my hair rubbed it

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.100 
gloved hands um into my hair rubbed it
in<00:02:37.790> all<00:02:38.790> the<00:02:38.940> layers<00:02:39.210> I<00:02:39.390> leave<00:02:39.570> my<00:02:39.690> roots<00:02:39.870> last

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
in all the layers I leave my roots last

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.080 
in all the layers I leave my roots last
because<00:02:40.530> they're<00:02:41.280> close<00:02:41.490> to<00:02:41.610> your<00:02:41.730> head<00:02:41.880> and

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
because they're close to your head and

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.050 
because they're close to your head and
they'll<00:02:42.240> actually<00:02:42.450> like<00:02:43.460> develop<00:02:44.460> quicker<00:02:44.700> so

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
they'll actually like develop quicker so

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.150 
they'll actually like develop quicker so
if<00:02:45.120> you<00:02:45.240> like<00:02:45.630> putting<00:02:46.470> dye<00:02:46.650> on<00:02:46.830> they<00:02:47.010> will

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
if you like putting dye on they will

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.260 
if you like putting dye on they will
develop<00:02:47.310> quick<00:02:47.550> -<00:02:47.700> didn't<00:02:47.970> need<00:02:48.090> to<00:02:48.120> your

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
develop quick - didn't need to your

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:49.250 
develop quick - didn't need to your
roots<00:02:48.450> so<00:02:48.600> that's<00:02:48.750> why<00:02:48.810> I<00:02:48.840> always<00:02:49.050> start<00:02:49.200> at

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
roots so that's why I always start at

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.140 
roots so that's why I always start at
the<00:02:49.320> ends<00:02:49.590> go<00:02:50.010> up<00:02:50.070> to<00:02:50.160> the<00:02:50.250> roots<00:02:50.400> and<00:02:50.910> you<00:02:51.060> get

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
the ends go up to the roots and you get

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.210 
the ends go up to the roots and you get
a<00:02:51.180> nice<00:02:51.300> even<00:02:51.510> color<00:02:51.780> all<00:02:51.960> over<00:02:52.040> and<00:02:53.040> it<00:02:53.130> says

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
a nice even color all over and it says

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:54.680 
a nice even color all over and it says
to<00:02:53.310> leave<00:02:53.430> on<00:02:53.550> here<00:02:53.730> or<00:02:54.060> I<00:02:54.090> think<00:02:54.330> of<00:02:54.540> it<00:02:54.630> as

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
to leave on here or I think of it as

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.410 
to leave on here or I think of it as
like<00:02:54.840> 15<00:02:55.320> minutes<00:02:55.680> but<00:02:56.130> by<00:02:56.730> the<00:02:56.790> time<00:02:57.060> I'd

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
like 15 minutes but by the time I'd

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.570 
like 15 minutes but by the time I'd
applied<00:02:57.810> it<00:02:57.960> all<00:02:58.020> over<00:02:58.130> it<00:02:59.130> already<00:02:59.250> been<00:02:59.490> like

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
applied it all over it already been like

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:00.800 
applied it all over it already been like
15<00:02:59.880> minutes<00:03:00.030> underneath<00:03:00.420> and<00:03:00.600> I<00:03:00.630> didn't

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
15 minutes underneath and I didn't

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.180 
15 minutes underneath and I didn't
really<00:03:00.960> want<00:03:01.110> streaky<00:03:01.350> colors<00:03:01.620> I<00:03:01.740> know<00:03:01.800> the

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
really want streaky colors I know the

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:03.590 
really want streaky colors I know the
top<00:03:02.400> part<00:03:02.670> of<00:03:02.760> my<00:03:02.850> hair<00:03:03.090> being<00:03:03.330> so<00:03:03.510> much

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
top part of my hair being so much

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:04.160 
top part of my hair being so much
lighter

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
lighter

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.620 
lighter
would<00:03:04.560> take<00:03:04.710> the<00:03:04.830> color<00:03:05.010> a<00:03:05.070> lot<00:03:05.190> more<00:03:05.430> so<00:03:05.760> I<00:03:06.060> did

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
would take the color a lot more so I did

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.270 
would take the color a lot more so I did
leave<00:03:06.780> it<00:03:06.810> on<00:03:06.960> probably<00:03:07.500> once<00:03:07.800> I<00:03:07.950> put<00:03:08.100> it<00:03:08.160> all

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
leave it on probably once I put it all

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.050 
leave it on probably once I put it all
on<00:03:08.430> for<00:03:09.180> about<00:03:09.510> five<00:03:10.170> minutes<00:03:10.940> how<00:03:11.940> do<00:03:12.000> you
