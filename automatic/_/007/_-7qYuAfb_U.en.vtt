you see two bass together you got

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.620 
you see two bass together you got
probably<00:02:43.180> a<00:02:43.690> 50/50<00:02:44.350> on<00:02:44.650> catching<00:02:45.100> one<00:02:45.310> of<00:02:45.340> them

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
probably a 50/50 on catching one of them

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.590 
probably a 50/50 on catching one of them
and<00:02:46.630> if<00:02:46.810> you<00:02:46.930> see<00:02:47.140> three<00:02:47.380> or<00:02:47.860> more<00:02:48.430> a<00:02:48.760> lot<00:02:49.510> of

and if you see three or more a lot of

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.300 
and if you see three or more a lot of
times<00:02:49.840> it's<00:02:50.140> about<00:02:50.320> a<00:02:50.380> guarantee<00:02:50.950> that<00:02:51.190> at

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
times it's about a guarantee that at

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:52.620 
times it's about a guarantee that at
least<00:02:51.400> one<00:02:51.670> of<00:02:51.760> those<00:02:51.880> fish<00:02:52.150> is<00:02:52.300> going<00:02:52.420> to<00:02:52.510> run

least one of those fish is going to run
over<00:02:52.660> there<00:02:52.870> and<00:02:53.020> take<00:02:53.140> a<00:02:53.170> shot<00:02:53.410> at<00:02:53.560> your<00:02:53.650> top

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
over there and take a shot at your top

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:55.620 
over there and take a shot at your top
water<00:02:54.100> just<00:02:54.670> because<00:02:54.880> I<00:02:55.210> guess<00:02:55.360> it's<00:02:55.540> a

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
water just because I guess it's a

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:56.970 
water just because I guess it's a
competition<00:02:55.960> between<00:02:56.320> the<00:02:56.530> fish<00:02:56.800> and<00:02:56.920> I

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
competition between the fish and I

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.740 
competition between the fish and I
little<00:02:57.220> pack<00:02:57.430> so<00:02:58.890> that<00:02:59.890> being<00:03:00.130> said<00:03:00.450> bass<00:03:01.450> real

easy to work it's really easy to

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.530 
easy to work it's really easy to
overwork<00:03:06.070> at<00:03:06.250> the<00:03:06.400> same<00:03:06.610> time<00:03:06.880> meaning<00:03:07.240> it's

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.540

the dog like a Sammy basically you just

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.660 
the dog like a Sammy basically you just
throw<00:03:22.180> it<00:03:22.240> out<00:03:22.390> there<00:03:22.570> a<00:03:23.310> lot<00:03:24.310> of<00:03:24.370> times<00:03:24.550> I<00:03:24.640> like

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
throw it out there a lot of times I like

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:26.370 
throw it out there a lot of times I like
to<00:03:24.880> let<00:03:25.000> a<00:03:25.060> top<00:03:25.270> water<00:03:25.450> sit<00:03:25.720> for<00:03:25.900> a<00:03:25.930> second<00:03:26.290> or

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
to let a top water sit for a second or

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:27.840 
to let a top water sit for a second or
to<00:03:26.500> let<00:03:26.740> the<00:03:26.830> Rings<00:03:27.040> dissipate<00:03:27.580> in<00:03:27.700> case

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:27.850 
to let the Rings dissipate in case

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:29.310 
to let the Rings dissipate in case
there's<00:03:28.060> one<00:03:28.210> sitting<00:03:28.570> right<00:03:28.750> there<00:03:28.990> and<00:03:29.200> then

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:29.320 
there's one sitting right there and then

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:30.720 
there's one sitting right there and then
second<00:03:29.740> you<00:03:29.770> move<00:03:29.950> it<00:03:30.130> just<00:03:30.220> a<00:03:30.340> little<00:03:30.520> bit<00:03:30.640> he

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
second you move it just a little bit he

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:34.110 
second you move it just a little bit he
blows<00:03:30.940> up<00:03:31.150> on<00:03:31.330> it<00:03:31.480> that's<00:03:31.870> what<00:03:31.990> you<00:03:32.110> hope<00:03:33.120> then

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
blows up on it that's what you hope then

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.810 
blows up on it that's what you hope then
give<00:03:34.270> it<00:03:34.360> like<00:03:34.510> two<00:03:34.750> little<00:03:35.200> pools<00:03:35.580> it's<00:03:36.580> not<00:03:36.790> a

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:36.820 
give it like two little pools it's not a

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.450 
give it like two little pools it's not a
sharp<00:03:37.210> pop<00:03:37.540> it's<00:03:37.900> more<00:03:38.110> of<00:03:38.230> a<00:03:38.380> more<00:03:39.370> of<00:03:39.430> a

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:39.460 
sharp pop it's more of a more of a

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:42.660 
sharp pop it's more of a more of a
little<00:03:39.670> gradual<00:03:40.090> pool<00:03:40.330> it's<00:03:40.900> real<00:03:41.230> easy<00:03:41.670> but

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 
little gradual pool it's real easy but

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:45.920 
lines the reason you want to use
monofilament<00:04:44.580> is<00:04:44.970> because<00:04:45.180> it<00:04:45.300> floats<00:04:45.570> better

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930 
monofilament is because it floats better

than fluorocarbon fluorocarbon will sink

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:49.550 
than fluorocarbon fluorocarbon will sink
