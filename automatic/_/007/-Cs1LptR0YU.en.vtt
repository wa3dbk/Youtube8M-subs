00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:02.790 
just coming back from the post office

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:04.250 
just coming back from the post office
now

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:04.260 
now

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:09.379 
now
and<00:00:06.500> two<00:00:07.500> times<00:00:07.800> I<00:00:08.220> thought<00:00:08.730> about<00:00:08.880> time<00:00:09.270> of

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
and two times I thought about time of

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.500 
and two times I thought about time of
the<00:00:09.450> video<00:00:09.630> on<00:00:10.110> whenever<00:00:10.440> I<00:00:10.650> left<00:00:11.010> they're

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:11.510 
the video on whenever I left they're

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:16.609 
the video on whenever I left they're
bigger<00:00:12.860> yeah<00:00:14.209> don't<00:00:15.209> do<00:00:15.389> it<00:00:15.539> since<00:00:15.780> it's<00:00:16.440> not

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
bigger yeah don't do it since it's not

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.670 
bigger yeah don't do it since it's not
doing<00:00:17.070> it'll<00:00:17.220> anyways<00:00:17.789> you<00:00:18.150> know<00:00:18.470> the<00:00:19.470> notch

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
doing it'll anyways you know the notch

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:20.450 
doing it'll anyways you know the notch
eNOS

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
eNOS

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.700 
eNOS
and<00:00:20.670> sure<00:00:21.240> enough<00:00:21.269> both<00:00:21.929> times<00:00:22.230> I<00:00:22.380> go<00:00:22.529> in<00:00:22.650> the

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
and sure enough both times I go in the

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.950 
and sure enough both times I go in the
third<00:00:22.890> gear<00:00:23.099> it<00:00:23.550> doesn't<00:00:24.060> so<00:00:24.210> I<00:00:24.240> figure<00:00:24.630> I<00:00:24.660> turn

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
third gear it doesn't so I figure I turn

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.589 
third gear it doesn't so I figure I turn
this<00:00:25.080> back<00:00:25.349> on<00:00:25.580> now<00:00:26.580> it's<00:00:26.820> probably<00:00:27.029> not<00:00:27.330> going

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
this back on now it's probably not going

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.279 
this back on now it's probably not going
to<00:00:27.660> do<00:00:27.810> it<00:00:27.900> so<00:00:28.380> we'll<00:00:28.919> see<00:00:29.929> he's<00:00:30.929> got<00:00:31.050> about

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
to do it so we'll see he's got about

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.710 
to do it so we'll see he's got about
another<00:00:31.499> eight<00:00:32.070> hundred<00:00:32.460> feet<00:00:32.640> to<00:00:32.820> drive<00:00:33.060> I'll

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:33.720 
another eight hundred feet to drive I'll

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.410 
another eight hundred feet to drive I'll
be<00:00:33.810> making<00:00:34.140> a<00:00:34.200> right<00:00:34.380> so<00:00:34.620> I<00:00:34.680> had<00:00:34.829> to<00:00:34.920> downshift

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:35.420 
be making a right so I had to downshift

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.600 
be making a right so I had to downshift
and<00:00:36.420> I'll<00:00:36.629> be<00:00:36.840> down<00:00:37.170> shifting<00:00:37.559> in<00:00:37.860> two<00:00:37.980> seconds

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
and I'll be down shifting in two seconds

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.139 
and I'll be down shifting in two seconds
so<00:00:39.090> I<00:00:40.129> had<00:00:41.129> to<00:00:41.219> go<00:00:41.309> over<00:00:41.340> so<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.640> train<00:00:41.879> tracks

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
so I had to go over so the train tracks

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.880 
so I had to go over so the train tracks
wants<00:00:42.420> to<00:00:42.480> go<00:00:42.600> with<00:00:42.750> train<00:00:43.379> tracks<00:00:43.649> and<00:00:43.800> I'll

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
wants to go with train tracks and I'll

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.979 
wants to go with train tracks and I'll
go<00:00:44.010> on<00:00:44.129> third<00:00:44.370> gear<00:00:44.579> and<00:00:44.730> hopefully<00:00:45.329> hopefully

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
go on third gear and hopefully hopefully

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.220 
go on third gear and hopefully hopefully
it'll<00:00:46.800> do<00:00:46.980> it<00:00:47.129> turn<00:00:47.910> this<00:00:48.030> off<00:00:48.270> so<00:00:48.510> check<00:00:48.989> it<00:00:49.170> as

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
it'll do it turn this off so check it as

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.770 
it'll do it turn this off so check it as
much<00:00:49.680> sound<00:00:50.519> as<00:00:50.670> possible<00:00:50.760> so<00:00:51.329> you<00:00:51.390> can<00:00:51.570> hear

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
much sound as possible so you can hear

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:59.910 
much sound as possible so you can hear
hopefully<00:00:53.449> second<00:00:54.920> hold<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:56.010> camera

00:00:59.910 --> 00:00:59.920 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:06.310 

go<00:01:00.190> to<00:01:00.250> train<00:01:00.550> tracks

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.720 

are<00:01:06.860> you

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:08.730 
are you

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:11.280 
are you

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:11.290 
now I hope y'all seen the vibration

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:17.800 
now I hope y'all seen the vibration
ain't<00:01:11.530> heard<00:01:11.710> that<00:01:11.920> I<00:01:12.190> really<00:01:12.640> do

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:19.649 

look<00:01:18.140> at<00:01:18.290> this

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:19.659 
look at this

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:26.399 
look at this
and<00:01:19.840> I'm<00:01:19.960> hoping<00:01:20.530> to<00:01:20.880> stay

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:26.409 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:30.359

third<00:01:37.560> year<00:01:37.829> 3200<00:01:38.869> it<00:01:39.869> didn't<00:01:40.170> do<00:01:40.259> it<00:01:40.380> that

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
third year 3200 it didn't do it that

third year 3200 it didn't do it that
time

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:47.799 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:50.340 

I'll<00:01:48.159> be<00:01:48.310> shifting<00:01:48.670> to<00:01:48.700> the<00:01:48.850> third<00:01:49.119> one<00:01:50.110> more

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 
I'll be shifting to the third one more

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:59.679 
I'll be shifting to the third one more
time<00:01:50.649> so<00:01:51.840> see<00:01:52.840> how<00:01:53.020> it<00:01:53.170> goes

00:01:59.679 --> 00:01:59.689 

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:14.290 

for<00:02:00.350> the<00:02:00.560> second<00:02:01.810> turn<00:02:02.810> up<00:02:02.960> my<00:02:03.109> road

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.890 

I<00:02:15.400> turn<00:02:16.400> on<00:02:16.610> my<00:02:16.880> street<00:02:17.210> and<00:02:17.240> I'll<00:02:17.480> have<00:02:17.720> to

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
I turn on my street and I'll have to

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.570 
I turn on my street and I'll have to
turn<00:02:18.200> I'll<00:02:18.650> have<00:02:18.860> to<00:02:18.980> go<00:02:19.100> third<00:02:19.370> year<00:02:19.610> now

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.700 

just<00:02:23.660> fell<00:02:24.660> out<00:02:24.720> my<00:02:24.870> hand<00:02:25.080> but<00:02:25.170> still<00:02:25.350> didn't

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
just fell out my hand but still didn't

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:28.100 
just fell out my hand but still didn't
do<00:02:25.800> it<00:02:25.920> so
