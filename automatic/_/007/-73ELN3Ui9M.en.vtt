argue<00:00:32.790> so<00:00:33.329> let's<00:00:34.170> kind<00:00:34.260> of<00:00:34.350> run<00:00:34.500> through<00:00:34.530> this

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
argue so let's kind of run through this

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.319 
argue so let's kind of run through this
really<00:00:34.890> quick<00:00:35.130> three<00:00:35.460> and<00:00:35.579> a<00:00:35.610> half<00:00:35.640> pounds<00:00:35.940> an

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
inch deep 11.6 inch screens so obviously

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.110
