00:03:03.839 --> 00:03:08.029
 transferring other device for others, this feature is not accessible 

00:03:08.029 --> 00:03:11.589

 all telephone connections incoming and outgoing including sms texts 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:39.120
 the device sends the targets in the background 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.120
 via a data connection to a server in Thailand 

00:03:44.679 --> 00:03:48.369
 and the data collected can be turned into companies anywhere in the world 

00:03:48.369 --> 00:03:49.470

00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:00.169
 the Thai operator could access this data 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:03.310
