humanity'<00:01:51.149> that<00:01:51.810> are<00:01:51.930> amazing<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.680> first

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
humanity' that are amazing the first

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.160 
humanity' that are amazing the first
time<00:01:53.100> you<00:01:53.220> play<00:01:53.430> it<00:01:53.579> and<00:01:53.729> then<00:01:54.060> it<00:01:54.360> just<00:01:54.630> gets

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
time you play it and then it just gets

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.959 
time you play it and then it just gets
old<00:01:55.470> and<00:01:55.799> you<00:01:56.790> don't<00:01:56.969> touch<00:01:57.119> it<00:01:57.299> ever<00:01:57.420> again<00:01:57.630> so

00:01:58.959 --> 00:01:58.969 
old and you don't touch it ever again so

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:01.670 
old and you don't touch it ever again so
it's<00:01:59.969> I<00:02:00.299> do<00:02:00.479> think<00:02:00.869> this<00:02:00.990> is<00:02:01.049> a<00:02:01.200> game<00:02:01.409> that<00:02:01.590> will

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
it's I do think this is a game that will

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.130 
it's I do think this is a game that will
have<00:02:01.860> longer<00:02:02.159> replay<00:02:02.729> value<00:02:02.909> which<00:02:03.299> is<00:02:03.540> a<00:02:03.570> good

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
have longer replay value which is a good

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.830 
have longer replay value which is a good
thing<00:02:04.320> I<00:02:04.850> what<00:02:05.850> I<00:02:05.880> enjoyed<00:02:06.270> about<00:02:06.299> it<00:02:06.479> the<00:02:06.659> most

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
thing I what I enjoyed about it the most

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.070 
thing I what I enjoyed about it the most
was<00:02:07.259> the<00:02:07.590> way<00:02:07.740> the<00:02:08.009> tension<00:02:08.629> very<00:02:09.629> smoothly

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
was the way the tension very smoothly

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.660 
was the way the tension very smoothly
ratchets<00:02:10.770> up<00:02:10.950> through<00:02:11.370> a

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
ratchets up through a

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.660 
ratchets up through a
turns<00:02:12.590> the<00:02:13.590> rules<00:02:13.800> have<00:02:14.069> not<00:02:14.250> yet<00:02:14.490> been

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
turns the rules have not yet been

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.150 
turns the rules have not yet been
finalized<00:02:15.300> so<00:02:15.690> we<00:02:15.900> did<00:02:16.140> run<00:02:16.380> into<00:02:16.530> one<00:02:16.950> little

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
finalized so we did run into one little

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.020 
finalized so we did run into one little
quirk<00:02:17.550> towards<00:02:18.120> the<00:02:18.330> ends<00:02:18.750> that<00:02:19.819> I'll<00:02:20.819> talk

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
quirk towards the ends that I'll talk

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.600 
quirk towards the ends that I'll talk
about<00:02:21.239> in<00:02:21.330> the<00:02:21.390> next<00:02:21.480> video<00:02:21.690> probably<00:02:22.400> but<00:02:23.400> I'm

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
about in the next video probably but I'm

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.400 
about in the next video probably but I'm
sure<00:02:24.000> it'll<00:02:24.120> be<00:02:24.180> addressed<00:02:24.599> by<00:02:24.840> the<00:02:24.900> time<00:02:25.260> the

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
sure it'll be addressed by the time the

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.540 
sure it'll be addressed by the time the
full<00:02:25.530> game<00:02:25.709> comes<00:02:26.010> out<00:02:27.319> it<00:02:28.319> was<00:02:28.680> a<00:02:28.709> quite<00:02:29.310> a<00:02:29.340> fun

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
full game comes out it was a quite a fun

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.360 
full game comes out it was a quite a fun
quite<00:02:30.300> a<00:02:30.330> fun<00:02:30.510> game<00:02:30.690> to<00:02:30.720> play<00:02:30.930> now<00:02:31.370> typically

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
quite a fun game to play now typically

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.250 
quite a fun game to play now typically
when<00:02:32.730> I'm<00:02:32.910> playing<00:02:33.239> a<00:02:33.420> game<00:02:33.569> I<00:02:33.780> like<00:02:34.020> there<00:02:34.230> to

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
when I'm playing a game I like there to

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.910 
when I'm playing a game I like there to
be<00:02:34.440> a<00:02:34.590> strong<00:02:35.430> balance<00:02:36.000> between<00:02:36.920> randomness

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
be a strong balance between randomness

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.300 
be a strong balance between randomness
and<00:02:38.160> strategy<00:02:38.790> so<00:02:39.450> in<00:02:39.930> theory<00:02:40.410> if<00:02:40.739> by<00:02:41.280> chance

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
and strategy so in theory if by chance

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.330 
and strategy so in theory if by chance
you're<00:02:41.970> dealt<00:02:42.269> the<00:02:42.569> worst<00:02:42.930> possible<00:02:43.470> hand<00:02:44.069> if

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
you're dealt the worst possible hand if

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.240 
you're dealt the worst possible hand if
you<00:02:45.269> execute<00:02:45.600> the<00:02:46.050> best<00:02:46.319> possible<00:02:46.950> strategy

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
you execute the best possible strategy

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.970 
you execute the best possible strategy
you<00:02:48.090> can<00:02:48.239> still<00:02:48.510> win<00:02:48.720> that's<00:02:48.989> the<00:02:49.470> balance

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
you can still win that's the balance

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.759 
you can still win that's the balance
that<00:02:50.100> is<00:02:50.519> my<00:02:51.269> personal<00:02:51.750> taste<00:02:51.989> in<00:02:52.290> a<00:02:52.350> game<00:02:52.530> and

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
that is my personal taste in a game and

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:55.759 
that is my personal taste in a game and
I<00:02:53.580> felt<00:02:53.880> exploding<00:02:54.450> kittens<00:02:54.780> was<00:02:55.110> a<00:02:55.319> little

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
I felt exploding kittens was a little

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:59.360 
I felt exploding kittens was a little
bit<00:02:55.950> too<00:02:56.430> far<00:02:56.790> on<00:02:57.090> the<00:02:57.390> random<00:02:57.630> side<00:02:58.110> and<00:02:58.440> the

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
bit too far on the random side and the

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.940 
bit too far on the random side and the
strategies<00:02:59.880> they<00:03:00.120> talked<00:03:00.390> about<00:03:00.950> that's

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
strategies they talked about that's

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.240 
strategies they talked about that's
rather<00:03:02.549> minimal<00:03:02.790> so<00:03:03.299> I<00:03:03.739> would<00:03:04.739> have<00:03:04.860> liked<00:03:05.130> to

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
rather minimal so I would have liked to

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.270 
rather minimal so I would have liked to
have<00:03:05.370> seen<00:03:05.430> a<00:03:05.640> little<00:03:05.940> more<00:03:06.739> like<00:03:07.739> just<00:03:08.069> a

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
have seen a little more like just a

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.680 
have seen a little more like just a
little<00:03:08.610> more<00:03:08.760> strategy<00:03:09.450> in<00:03:09.630> there<00:03:11.330> like<00:03:12.330> poker

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
little more strategy in there like poker

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.460 
little more strategy in there like poker
this<00:03:13.200> strategy<00:03:13.739> is<00:03:14.069> a<00:03:14.819> lot<00:03:15.360> of<00:03:15.510> interpersonal

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
this strategy is a lot of interpersonal

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.880 
this strategy is a lot of interpersonal
stuff<00:03:17.060> for<00:03:18.060> instance<00:03:18.420> there<00:03:19.320> are<00:03:19.440> cards<00:03:19.709> that

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
stuff for instance there are cards that

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:21.620 
stuff for instance there are cards that
let<00:03:20.130> other<00:03:20.280> people<00:03:20.640> take<00:03:20.880> one<00:03:21.120> of<00:03:21.209> your<00:03:21.359> cards

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
let other people take one of your cards

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:25.550 
let other people take one of your cards
and<00:03:22.940> the<00:03:23.940> more<00:03:24.150> cards<00:03:24.480> you<00:03:24.690> have<00:03:24.959> the<00:03:25.350> less

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
and the more cards you have the less

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.020 
and the more cards you have the less
odds<00:03:25.920> they<00:03:26.250> have<00:03:26.459> of<00:03:26.640> getting<00:03:26.730> one<00:03:26.940> here

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
odds they have of getting one here

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.330 
odds they have of getting one here
defuse<00:03:27.420> cards<00:03:27.870> you<00:03:28.709> can<00:03:28.829> do<00:03:28.920> little<00:03:29.100> mind

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
defuse cards you can do little mind

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.099 
defuse cards you can do little mind
games<00:03:29.609> like<00:03:29.940> you<00:03:30.060> know<00:03:30.150> cluster<00:03:30.570> your<00:03:30.720> cards

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:31.109 
games like you know cluster your cards

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:32.720 
games like you know cluster your cards
or<00:03:31.260> put<00:03:31.410> one<00:03:31.440> a<00:03:31.620> little<00:03:31.829> bit<00:03:32.010> out<00:03:32.160> so<00:03:32.400> it's<00:03:32.519> more

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
or put one a little bit out so it's more

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.550 
or put one a little bit out so it's more
obvious<00:03:32.940> or<00:03:33.480> put<00:03:33.660> it<00:03:33.750> a<00:03:33.810> little<00:03:33.840> in<00:03:34.200> source

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
obvious or put it a little in source

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.140 
obvious or put it a little in source
there's<00:03:34.980> stuff<00:03:35.160> like<00:03:35.310> that<00:03:35.459> that's<00:03:35.850> kind<00:03:36.060> of

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
there's stuff like that that's kind of

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.840 
there's stuff like that that's kind of
interesting<00:03:36.359> I<00:03:37.010> liked<00:03:38.010> the<00:03:38.250> way<00:03:38.400> the<00:03:38.609> non

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
interesting I liked the way the non

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.360 
interesting I liked the way the non
action<00:03:39.060> cards<00:03:39.600> scaled<00:03:40.380> up<00:03:40.560> where<00:03:40.920> if<00:03:41.040> you<00:03:41.160> have

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
action cards scaled up where if you have

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.640 
action cards scaled up where if you have
to<00:03:42.359> you<00:03:42.630> can<00:03:42.780> get<00:03:42.870> a<00:03:42.930> random<00:03:43.200> card<00:03:43.590> from

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
to you can get a random card from

to you can get a random card from
someone<00:03:44.070> else<00:03:44.190> if<00:03:44.370> you<00:03:44.459> have<00:03:44.579> three<00:03:44.970> you<00:03:45.180> can

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:45.359 
someone else if you have three you can

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:47.090 
someone else if you have three you can
request<00:03:45.660> a<00:03:45.900> card<00:03:46.170> but<00:03:46.410> if<00:03:46.530> they<00:03:46.650> don't<00:03:46.829> have<00:03:46.980> it

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
request a card but if they don't have it

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:55.829 
enjoyed the way that scaled up so it

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:59.120 
enjoyed the way that scaled up so it
kind<00:03:56.069> of<00:03:56.280> encouraged<00:03:57.239> you<00:03:57.450> to<00:03:57.500> hold<00:03:58.500> out<00:03:58.769> and

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130 
kind of encouraged you to hold out and

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:01.670 
kind of encouraged you to hold out and
get<00:03:59.280> a<00:03:59.310> more<00:03:59.519> powerful<00:03:59.670> hand<00:04:00.239> so<00:04:00.690> I<00:04:00.720> did<00:04:01.440> enjoy

get a more powerful hand so I did enjoy
that<00:04:01.859> element<00:04:03.680> so<00:04:04.680> I<00:04:04.739> think<00:04:05.340> this<00:04:05.670> will<00:04:05.790> be<00:04:05.940> a

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
that element so I think this will be a

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:08.840 
that element so I think this will be a
fun<00:04:06.660> game<00:04:06.690> it'll<00:04:07.380> end<00:04:07.889> up<00:04:08.250> being<00:04:08.579> something

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:08.850
