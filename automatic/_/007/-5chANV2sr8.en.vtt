00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.350
 don't even go anywhere not saving not 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.869
 we â€™ll just go to the start of the game 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.930
 TV in the option and setting up audio and 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:00.299

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:05.729
 Songs that is, as if played will take what 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.459
 we put roughly a folder 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.780
 copied and created a shortcut after which 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.730
 click back and now you 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.370
 I will demonstrate how this will sound 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.890
 song 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:17.290
 do these choose your radio decline 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.830
 player and how do you hear it sounds 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:22.390
 fine but i won't you her 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.860
 play on computer because 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.110
 just simply me can youtube 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.120
 block if me from behind once and 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.010
 robin not blocked in the hitman 2 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:33.129
 then for this song she is very popular 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:35.440
 has for sure I don't know this channel taught 

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:38.140
 away from and I have done so many videos already 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.239
 205 in my opinion I do not need this 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.569
 happiness so better do without 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:43.329
 of this 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:45.549
 if anything else you can start the game 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:47.709
 start the game or load the total then 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:50.319
 the very house to sit down the car is the same turn 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:53.230
 this radio ministry Player or just 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:55.180
 called their radio and everything and will 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.519
 sound all the songs that you copied 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.829
 you can copy them in my opinion not 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:02.230
 limited amount but per night 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:04.109
 until computer memory is full there 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.700
 weston randomly 

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:09.430
 it is worth playing random random 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:12.250
 like i told you everything i think that 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:14.319
 This video helped a lot 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:17.829
 know how to do it and I myself wonder 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:20.290
 I guessed honestly okay so 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:23.380
