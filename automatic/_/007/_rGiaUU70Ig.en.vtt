actually think that spirit team is a

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.059 
actually think that spirit team is a
very<00:02:09.300> brilliant<00:02:09.539> choice<00:02:09.869> right<00:02:10.200> now<00:02:10.229> you<00:02:10.950> kind

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
very brilliant choice right now you kind

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.620 
very brilliant choice right now you kind
of<00:02:11.160> think<00:02:11.340> it<00:02:11.489> through<00:02:11.700> spirit<00:02:12.450> to

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
of think it through spirit to

of think it through spirit to
doesn't<00:02:13.140> have<00:02:13.230> that<00:02:13.350> ghost<00:02:13.590> weakness<00:02:13.950> ghost

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
doesn't have that ghost weakness ghost

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:15.470 
doesn't have that ghost weakness ghost
they<00:02:14.490> have<00:02:14.610> those<00:02:14.760> ghost<00:02:15.000> weaknesses

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
they have those ghost weaknesses

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.600 
they have those ghost weaknesses
spiritomb<00:02:16.200> also<00:02:16.470> throws<00:02:16.680> out<00:02:16.800> the<00:02:16.950> dark<00:02:17.340> and

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
spiritomb also throws out the dark and

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.120 
spiritomb also throws out the dark and
the<00:02:17.790> ghost<00:02:18.030> mix<00:02:18.330> up<00:02:18.510> it<00:02:19.140> can<00:02:19.320> probably<00:02:19.620> be<00:02:19.770> a

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
the ghost mix up it can probably be a

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.700 
the ghost mix up it can probably be a
monstrous<00:02:20.730> hit<00:02:20.940> so<00:02:21.240> drifblim<00:02:22.050> going<00:02:22.500> to<00:02:22.560> lead

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710

the sucker punch the shadow snake is
going<00:03:04.620> to<00:03:04.680> outpace<00:03:05.010> it<00:03:05.250> gets<00:03:06.120> a<00:03:06.210> little<00:03:06.390> bit<00:03:06.600> of

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
going to outpace it gets a little bit of

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.540 
going to outpace it gets a little bit of
damage<00:03:06.840> in<00:03:07.170> there<00:03:07.350> so<00:03:07.650> we're<00:03:08.130> gonna<00:03:08.250> try<00:03:08.460> to

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550
