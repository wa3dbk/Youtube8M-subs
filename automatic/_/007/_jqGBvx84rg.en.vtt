00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:16.760
 which are the cereals most indicated in one 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.610
 healthy diet and which ones those from 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.860
 avoid but cereals 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:24.320
 starting from the assumption that we must not 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:26.180
 exaggerate in quantity and that maybe that 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.100
 which has been said so far that they must 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.560
 be the basis of human nutrition 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:33.680
 is a bit exaggerated at the base let's put it 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:35.329
 rather to vegetables we say that they have 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.340
 however, a role that can be 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:39.590
 it is important to prefer those 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:42.050
 which are one hundred percent integral 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:45.590
 difference may seem non-substantial 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:48.770
 but in reality it is the refined cereal 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:51.140
 white devoid of the fiber at a 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.609
 very high penetration speed 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.730
 through the gastrointestinal tract 

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:57.559
 of absorption and a bump in the 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:59.870
 blood sugar in insulin production 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:02.929
 which is very similar to a real sugar e 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.730
 just the whole grains on the contrary 

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:07.640
 being rich in fiber at an absorption 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:09.410
 much slower and this involves a 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.880
 increase in blood glucose and 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:13.520
 insulin production that is 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:16.760
 absolutely different so you see 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.740
 as with equal calories and also with 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.329
 foods that are stackable and for 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.030
 example the white pasta for pasta 

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:25.040
 wholemeal or white rice and brown rice 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.020
 but we have a metabolic effect that is 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.530
 completely different 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.939
 another aspect is that this in any case 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.380
 increases the share of fiber that does not 

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:35.299
 we introduce in this case we are 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.720
 speaking particularly of fiber 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:42.110
 the other category is insoluble fiber 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:44.329
 soluble more present in the fruit and which 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:47.030
 has very important functions for 

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:48.590
 our health 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.170
 I believe that whole grains are 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:53.420
 well tolerable more or less by everyone 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:56.479
 I'm not convinced they can be 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:59.270
 these are the cause of abdominal bloating 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:02.149
 at the base of the swelling there is more often or 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.130
 a bad chewing and then the 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:06.680
 fact that the person eats too much 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.690
 quick chew badly or an alteration 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.789
 of the intestinal bacterial flora that in 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.770
 this case must be reconstituted assuming 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:15.310
 for example of probiotics ie i 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.310
 lactic ferments
