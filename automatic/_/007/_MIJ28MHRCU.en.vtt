00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
was able to gather over 11 K bolts which

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.360 
was able to gather over 11 K bolts which
is<00:01:01.050> going<00:01:01.170> to<00:01:01.230> last<00:01:01.440> a<00:01:01.620> really<00:01:01.649> really<00:01:02.250> long

is going to last a really really long

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.369 
is going to last a really really long
time<00:01:02.670> and<00:01:02.940> they're<00:01:03.359> absolutely<00:01:03.570> amazing<00:01:04.019> for

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
time and they're absolutely amazing for

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.770 
time and they're absolutely amazing for
cubed<00:01:04.830> e<00:01:04.890> really<00:01:05.100> essential<00:01:05.760> one<00:01:06.630> of<00:01:06.720> the

cubed e really essential one of the

fastest<00:01:07.140> ways<00:01:07.260> in<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.500> game<00:01:07.650> to<00:01:07.770> kill<00:01:07.950> them

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
fastest ways in the game to kill them

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.190 
fastest ways in the game to kill them
it's<00:01:08.220> debatably<00:01:09.000> maybe<00:01:09.360> a<00:01:09.450> little<00:01:09.659> bit<00:01:09.840> faster

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
it's debatably maybe a little bit faster

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.990 
it's debatably maybe a little bit faster
to<00:01:10.229> kill<00:01:10.470> cubed<00:01:10.770> e<00:01:10.830> with<00:01:10.979> seismics<00:01:11.460> but<00:01:11.700> other

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.310 
ascension crossbows but I will be
showing<00:01:23.729> exactly<00:01:24.270> how<00:01:24.420> fast<00:01:24.630> it<00:01:24.869> is<00:01:24.930> to<00:01:25.140> make

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
showing exactly how fast it is to make

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.140 
showing exactly how fast it is to make
them<00:01:25.500> at<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:26.070> end<00:01:26.189> of<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.340> video<00:01:26.580> but<00:01:26.820> next

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
them at the end of the video but next

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.910 
them at the end of the video but next
that<00:01:27.420> you<00:01:27.540> once<00:01:28.320> you<00:01:28.409> have<00:01:28.439> all<00:01:28.619> your<00:01:28.650> you

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
that you once you have all your you

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.170 
that you once you have all your you
actually<00:01:29.009> have<00:01:29.250> to<00:01:29.340> tune<00:01:29.490> yours<00:01:29.790> so<00:01:29.970> you<00:01:30.000> just

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
actually have to tune yours so you just

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.410 
actually have to tune yours so you just
want<00:01:30.360> to<00:01:30.390> have<00:01:30.540> any<00:01:30.720> dragon<00:01:31.380> item<00:01:31.909> as<00:01:32.909> in<00:01:33.240> any

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
want to have any dragon item as in any

want to have any dragon item as in any
of<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.600> dragon<00:01:33.930> leathers<00:01:34.259> or<00:01:34.560> it<00:01:35.250> also<00:01:35.400> works

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
of the dragon leathers or it also works

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.270 
of the dragon leathers or it also works
with<00:01:35.790> a<00:01:36.079> KBD<00:01:37.079> head<00:01:37.350> and<00:01:37.590> also<00:01:37.920> works<00:01:38.130> with

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
with a KBD head and also works with

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.980 
with a KBD head and also works with
dragon<00:01:38.939> bones<00:01:39.090> so<00:01:39.360> basically<00:01:39.600> any<00:01:39.810> of<00:01:39.930> those

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
dragon bones so basically any of those

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.690 
dragon bones so basically any of those
items<00:01:40.350> you<00:01:40.500> just<00:01:40.770> have<00:01:41.009> an<00:01:41.130> inventory<00:01:41.369> make

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
items you just have an inventory make

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:42.920 
items you just have an inventory make
sure<00:01:41.850> you're<00:01:41.970> on<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.090> lunar<00:01:42.360> spell<00:01:42.630> book<00:01:42.780> and

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
sure you're on the lunar spell book and

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.539 
sure you're on the lunar spell book and
you<00:01:42.990> just<00:01:43.140> need<00:01:43.320> asteroids<00:01:43.950> and<00:01:44.130> earth<00:01:44.250> runes

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
you just need asteroids and earth runes

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.639 
you just need asteroids and earth runes
and<00:01:44.729> then<00:01:45.149> you<00:01:45.240> just<00:01:45.420> tune<00:01:46.020> all<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.320> ore<00:01:46.439> like

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
and then you just tune all the ore like

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.200 
and then you just tune all the ore like
I<00:01:46.770> do<00:01:46.829> here<00:01:47.009> actually<00:01:47.220> cast<00:01:47.549> a<00:01:47.670> spell<00:01:47.909> on<00:01:48.060> the

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
I do here actually cast a spell on the

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.179 
I do here actually cast a spell on the
weather<00:01:48.360> and<00:01:48.600> then<00:01:49.140> just<00:01:49.560> tune<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:49.890> ornate

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
weather and then just tune the ornate

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.010 
weather and then just tune the ornate
gives<00:01:50.520> you<00:01:50.610> pretty<00:01:50.759> good<00:01:51.030> magic<00:01:51.270> speeds<00:01:51.810> like

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
gives you pretty good magic speeds like

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.590 
gives you pretty good magic speeds like
2.5<00:01:52.829> k<00:01:53.100> XP<00:01:53.399> drops<00:01:53.759> every<00:01:54.060> single<00:01:54.329> time<00:01:54.479> you

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
2.5 k XP drops every single time you

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.480 
2.5 k XP drops every single time you
make<00:01:54.720> it<00:01:54.869> so<00:01:54.990> it's<00:01:55.140> pretty<00:01:55.290> crazy<00:01:55.530> and<00:01:55.770> once

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
make it so it's pretty crazy and once

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:57.830 
make it so it's pretty crazy and once
you<00:01:56.610> have<00:01:56.729> all<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:56.969> ore<00:01:57.090> tune<00:01:57.329> you<00:01:57.479> just<00:01:57.689> want

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
you have all the ore tune you just want

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.539 
you have all the ore tune you just want
to<00:01:57.869> smell<00:01:58.049> 2<00:01:58.229> in<00:01:58.350> a<00:01:58.439> furnace<00:01:58.740> so<00:01:58.829> any<00:01:59.159> furnace

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
to smell 2 in a furnace so any furnace

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:00.859 
to smell 2 in a furnace so any furnace
works<00:01:59.759> to<00:01:59.880> this<00:02:00.000> again<00:02:00.270> there's<00:02:00.479> a<00:02:00.540> lot<00:02:00.719> of

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
works to this again there's a lot of

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.899 
works to this again there's a lot of
steps<00:02:01.049> for<00:02:01.350> this<00:02:01.469> but<00:02:01.860> I<00:02:02.130> would<00:02:02.610> say<00:02:02.729> in<00:02:02.820> the

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
steps for this but I would say in the

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.039 
steps for this but I would say in the
long<00:02:03.000> run<00:02:03.210> it's<00:02:03.360> really<00:02:03.659> worth<00:02:03.840> it<00:02:03.930> because

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
long run it's really worth it because

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.020 
long run it's really worth it because
these<00:02:04.259> bolts<00:02:04.560> are<00:02:04.710> so<00:02:05.219> good<00:02:05.490> and<00:02:05.729> you'll<00:02:05.820> see

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
these bolts are so good and you'll see

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.449 
these bolts are so good and you'll see
that<00:02:06.180> later<00:02:06.329> on<00:02:06.479> I<00:02:06.920> toes<00:02:07.920> just<00:02:07.950> use<00:02:08.310> the

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
that later on I toes just use the

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:09.979 
that later on I toes just use the
furnace<00:02:08.729> and<00:02:08.849> Edgeville<00:02:09.179> again<00:02:09.780> it's<00:02:09.959> just

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
furnace and Edgeville again it's just

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.510 
furnace and Edgeville again it's just
kind<00:02:10.110> of<00:02:10.259> like<00:02:10.319> smelting<00:02:10.800> gold<00:02:11.009> bars<00:02:11.220> there's

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
kind of like smelting gold bars there's

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.010 
kind of like smelting gold bars there's
not<00:02:11.730> really<00:02:11.970> a<00:02:12.120> whole<00:02:12.330> lot<00:02:12.360> to<00:02:12.690> it<00:02:12.720> it's

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
not really a whole lot to it it's

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.260 
not really a whole lot to it it's
probably

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
probably

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.540 
probably
the<00:02:13.360> most<00:02:13.540> boring<00:02:14.140> parts<00:02:14.650> of<00:02:14.830> the<00:02:15.100> entire

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
the most boring parts of the entire

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.490 
the most boring parts of the entire
process<00:02:15.850> but<00:02:16.360> after<00:02:16.690> this<00:02:16.960> we<00:02:17.140> get<00:02:17.260> to<00:02:17.350> smell

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
process but after this we get to smell

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:18.360 
process but after this we get to smell
two<00:02:17.650> bolts<00:02:17.890> which<00:02:18.010> is<00:02:18.130> a<00:02:18.160> little<00:02:18.310> more

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
two bolts which is a little more

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:19.830 
two bolts which is a little more
interesting<00:02:18.790> just<00:02:18.970> make<00:02:19.120> sure<00:02:19.270> you<00:02:19.390> have<00:02:19.570> all

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
interesting just make sure you have all

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.680 
interesting just make sure you have all
of<00:02:19.900> your<00:02:20.380> dragonbane<00:02:20.890> bars<00:02:21.220> there<00:02:21.550> I<00:02:21.580> made<00:02:21.880> 224

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
of your dragonbane bars there I made 224

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.180 
of your dragonbane bars there I made 224
and<00:02:22.720> again<00:02:23.020> that<00:02:23.170> took<00:02:23.290> about<00:02:23.440> 45<00:02:23.740> minutes<00:02:24.040> to

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
and again that took about 45 minutes to

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.130 
and again that took about 45 minutes to
gather<00:02:24.370> and<00:02:24.700> next<00:02:25.210> you<00:02:25.330> want<00:02:25.510> to<00:02:25.630> go<00:02:25.780> to<00:02:25.840> the

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
gather and next you want to go to the

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.070 
gather and next you want to go to the
island<00:02:26.350> of<00:02:26.740> kasi<00:02:27.370> so<00:02:27.730> if<00:02:28.180> you<00:02:28.660> scroll<00:02:28.930> all<00:02:28.960> the

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
island of kasi so if you scroll all the

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.900 
island of kasi so if you scroll all the
way<00:02:29.200> down<00:02:29.290> in<00:02:29.650> your<00:02:29.680> faring<00:02:30.100> codes<00:02:30.340> it's<00:02:30.640> going

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
way down in your faring codes it's going

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.850 
way down in your faring codes it's going
to<00:02:31.000> be<00:02:31.120> there<00:02:31.330> there's<00:02:32.110> like<00:02:32.320> two<00:02:32.500> codes<00:02:32.770> you

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
to be there there's like two codes you

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:34.380 
to be there there's like two codes you
have<00:02:32.950> to<00:02:33.040> input<00:02:33.160> but<00:02:33.520> for<00:02:33.820> me<00:02:33.970> for<00:02:34.240> whatever

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
have to input but for me for whatever

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.150 
have to input but for me for whatever
reason<00:02:34.540> I<00:02:34.990> could<00:02:35.560> just<00:02:35.710> click<00:02:35.860> on<00:02:36.010> an

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
reason I could just click on an

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:37.770 
reason I could just click on an
immediately<00:02:36.460> teleport<00:02:36.940> there<00:02:37.150> like<00:02:37.570> you're

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
immediately teleport there like you're

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.660 
immediately teleport there like you're
supposed<00:02:37.960> to<00:02:38.080> go<00:02:38.260> to<00:02:38.290> something<00:02:39.190> that<00:02:39.400> I<00:02:39.430> can't

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
supposed to go to something that I can't

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.180 
supposed to go to something that I can't
read<00:02:39.820> and<00:02:40.000> then<00:02:40.150> the<00:02:40.270> code<00:02:40.480> aks<00:02:41.020> but<00:02:41.440> I<00:02:41.650> guess

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
read and then the code aks but I guess

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.460 
read and then the code aks but I guess
if<00:02:42.370> you<00:02:42.460> click<00:02:42.700> on<00:02:42.820> it<00:02:42.880> in<00:02:43.120> the<00:02:43.240> faring<00:02:43.900> logs

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
if you click on it in the faring logs

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:45.810 
if you click on it in the faring logs
that<00:02:44.710> you<00:02:44.770> have<00:02:45.010> you<00:02:45.220> only<00:02:45.370> have<00:02:45.520> to<00:02:45.640> do<00:02:45.730> it

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:45.820 
that you have you only have to do it

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:47.850 
that you have you only have to do it
once<00:02:46.000> but<00:02:46.660> again<00:02:46.930> there's<00:02:47.380> really<00:02:47.440> no<00:02:47.710> reason

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
once but again there's really no reason

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:49.320 
once but again there's really no reason
to<00:02:48.130> go<00:02:48.250> to<00:02:48.280> this<00:02:48.490> island<00:02:48.730> after<00:02:49.180> you've

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
to go to this island after you've

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.210 
to go to this island after you've
completed<00:02:49.450> our<00:02:49.870> o<00:02:49.900> TM<00:02:50.290> other<00:02:50.560> than<00:02:50.860> to<00:02:51.010> smash

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
completed our o TM other than to smash

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:52.950 
completed our o TM other than to smash
these<00:02:51.400> bolts<00:02:51.730> so<00:02:51.910> if<00:02:52.150> you<00:02:52.450> remember<00:02:52.720> there's<00:02:52.900> a

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:52.960 
these bolts so if you remember there's a

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:54.630 
these bolts so if you remember there's a
little<00:02:53.140> anvil<00:02:53.500> here<00:02:53.770> that<00:02:54.310> you<00:02:54.400> saw<00:02:54.580> during

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
little anvil here that you saw during

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.580 
little anvil here that you saw during
the<00:02:54.910> island<00:02:55.240> that<00:02:55.480> had<00:02:55.660> really<00:02:55.900> no<00:02:56.110> use<00:02:56.320> at<00:02:56.500> all

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
the island that had really no use at all

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.470 
the island that had really no use at all
during<00:02:56.800> the<00:02:56.920> quest<00:02:57.130> that<00:02:57.400> anvil<00:02:57.610> is<00:02:57.970> used<00:02:58.240> to

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
during the quest that anvil is used to

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.870 
during the quest that anvil is used to
make<00:02:58.690> the<00:02:59.170> bolts<00:02:59.860> and<00:03:00.040> also<00:03:00.280> the<00:03:00.370> arrows<00:03:00.640> but

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
make the bolts and also the arrows but

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.310 
make the bolts and also the arrows but
the<00:03:01.000> bolts<00:03:01.240> are<00:03:01.390> much<00:03:01.630> much<00:03:01.840> better<00:03:02.020> there's

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:02.320 
the bolts are much much better there's

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:03.720 
the bolts are much much better there's
really<00:03:02.440> no<00:03:02.590> reason<00:03:02.950> to<00:03:03.220> use<00:03:03.310> the<00:03:03.490> arrows

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
really no reason to use the arrows

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.820 
really no reason to use the arrows
because<00:03:04.420> there's<00:03:04.660> no<00:03:04.870> high<00:03:05.200> level<00:03:05.560> bows<00:03:05.800> that

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:05.830 
because there's no high level bows that

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:08.010 
because there's no high level bows that
require<00:03:06.550> arrows<00:03:06.880> I<00:03:07.060> mean<00:03:07.210> the<00:03:07.270> only<00:03:07.390> real<00:03:07.810> high

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:08.020 
require arrows I mean the only real high

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:09.720 
require arrows I mean the only real high
level<00:03:08.170> bow<00:03:08.380> there<00:03:08.560> is<00:03:08.650> is<00:03:08.800> their<00:03:09.190> eye<00:03:09.220> PO<00:03:09.520> but

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
level bow there is is their eye PO but

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.450 
level bow there is is their eye PO but
that<00:03:09.880> fires<00:03:10.120> its<00:03:10.360> own<00:03:10.480> arrows<00:03:10.840> anyway<00:03:11.200> so<00:03:11.460> yeah

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:12.460 
that fires its own arrows anyway so yeah

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:13.560 
that fires its own arrows anyway so yeah
this<00:03:12.790> is<00:03:12.970> the<00:03:13.090> only<00:03:13.210> thing<00:03:13.420> that<00:03:13.540> that

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:13.570 
this is the only thing that that

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:14.970 
this is the only thing that that
involves<00:03:14.050> used<00:03:14.230> for<00:03:14.410> and<00:03:14.500> you<00:03:14.560> can't<00:03:14.770> submit

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
involves used for and you can't submit

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:16.560 
involves used for and you can't submit
them<00:03:15.160> on<00:03:15.280> any<00:03:15.430> other<00:03:15.580> anvil<00:03:15.970> it<00:03:16.120> has<00:03:16.270> to<00:03:16.480> be

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:16.570 
them on any other anvil it has to be

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:18.510 
them on any other anvil it has to be
this<00:03:16.690> one<00:03:16.930> so<00:03:16.990> I<00:03:17.440> recommend<00:03:18.070> just<00:03:18.100> filling<00:03:18.430> up

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:18.520 
this one so I recommend just filling up

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:19.620 
this one so I recommend just filling up
your<00:03:18.550> beasts<00:03:18.790> of<00:03:18.910> burden<00:03:18.940> whether<00:03:19.330> that's<00:03:19.540> a

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
your beasts of burden whether that's a

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.230 
your beasts of burden whether that's a
war<00:03:19.810> tortoise<00:03:20.050> or<00:03:20.230> a<00:03:20.350> yak<00:03:20.580> full<00:03:21.580> of<00:03:21.790> the<00:03:21.940> bars

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:22.240 
war tortoise or a yak full of the bars

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.630 
war tortoise or a yak full of the bars
and<00:03:22.600> then<00:03:22.750> just<00:03:22.990> Smith<00:03:23.410> away<00:03:23.680> again<00:03:24.220> it's<00:03:24.370> 82

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
and then just Smith away again it's 82

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:25.980 
and then just Smith away again it's 82
smithing<00:03:25.000> to<00:03:25.060> make<00:03:25.180> these<00:03:25.330> bolts<00:03:25.660> so<00:03:25.780> if<00:03:25.900> you

smithing to make these bolts so if you
have<00:03:26.110> lower<00:03:26.290> smithing<00:03:26.709> like<00:03:26.860> on<00:03:27.010> my<00:03:27.130> newbie

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
have lower smithing like on my newbie

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.490 
have lower smithing like on my newbie
account<00:03:27.700> I<00:03:27.850> have<00:03:28.000> 80<00:03:28.209> smithing<00:03:28.690> so<00:03:29.110> what<00:03:29.230> I<00:03:29.260> did

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
account I have 80 smithing so what I did

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.530 
account I have 80 smithing so what I did
is<00:03:29.650> I<00:03:29.770> just<00:03:30.010> brought<00:03:30.250> mature<00:03:30.850> dwarven<00:03:31.300> stouts

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
is I just brought mature dwarven stouts

is I just brought mature dwarven stouts
with<00:03:31.750> me<00:03:31.930> and<00:03:32.110> they<00:03:32.530> boost<00:03:32.770> you<00:03:32.920> to<00:03:33.070> smithing

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
with me and they boost you to smithing

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:34.680 
with me and they boost you to smithing
levels<00:03:33.640> and<00:03:33.820> I<00:03:33.880> was<00:03:34.000> able<00:03:34.180> to<00:03:34.209> make<00:03:34.360> the<00:03:34.480> bolts

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
levels and I was able to make the bolts

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:36.630 
levels and I was able to make the bolts
that<00:03:34.810> way<00:03:34.959> and<00:03:35.140> then<00:03:35.740> once<00:03:35.980> you<00:03:36.100> have<00:03:36.280> all<00:03:36.490> the

good fletching XP is 70 XP drops and

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:46.980 
good fletching XP is 70 XP drops and
they<00:03:45.400> come<00:03:45.580> really<00:03:45.790> fast<00:03:46.060> so<00:03:46.420> it's<00:03:46.840> not

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:46.990 
they come really fast so it's not

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:48.330 
they come really fast so it's not

exactly a waste of time doing this as

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.070 
exactly a waste of time doing this as

you're getting pretty darn good XP as it
is<00:03:50.200> I'd<00:03:50.380> Simone<00:03:50.770> 6p<00:03:51.250> so<00:03:51.520> it's<00:03:51.970> normally<00:03:52.330> 70

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 
is I'd Simone 6p so it's normally 70

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.040 
is I'd Simone 6p so it's normally 70
even<00:03:52.870> though<00:03:53.020> I'm<00:03:53.110> getting<00:03:53.260> 140<00:03:54.160> XP<00:03:54.550> drops<00:03:54.790> and

even though I'm getting 140 XP drops and

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
even though I'm getting 140 XP drops and
finally<00:03:56.050> the<00:03:56.170> time<00:03:56.350> where<00:03:56.500> I<00:03:56.530> actually<00:03:56.650> test

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:57.070 
finally the time where I actually test

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:59.070 
finally the time where I actually test
them<00:03:57.220> versus<00:03:57.580> QP<00:03:57.910> DS<00:03:58.060> so<00:03:58.270> I'm<00:03:58.720> just<00:03:58.930> using

00:03:59.070 --> 00:03:59.080 
them versus QP DS so I'm just using

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:00.360 
them versus QP DS so I'm just using
chaotic<00:03:59.500> crossbows<00:03:59.890> here<00:04:00.100> I<00:04:00.130> do<00:04:00.250> have

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
chaotic crossbows here I do have

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.280 
chaotic crossbows here I do have
ascensions<00:04:01.060> but<00:04:01.300> I<00:04:01.330> decided<00:04:01.600> not<00:04:01.780> to<00:04:01.900> use<00:04:02.140> the

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.290 
ascensions but I decided not to use the

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:03.960 
ascensions but I decided not to use the
ascensions<00:04:02.709> because<00:04:02.950> I<00:04:03.040> figured<00:04:03.340> you<00:04:03.850> know

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
ascensions because I figured you know

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:05.430 
ascensions because I figured you know
that's<00:04:04.120> probably<00:04:04.450> not<00:04:04.570> accessible<00:04:05.020> by<00:04:05.260> as

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440 
that's probably not accessible by as

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.650 
that's probably not accessible by as
many<00:04:05.620> people<00:04:05.860> so<00:04:06.280> I<00:04:06.310> want<00:04:06.520> to<00:04:06.670> do<00:04:07.209> it<00:04:07.330> with<00:04:07.450> cata

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:07.660 
many people so I want to do it with cata

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:09.690 
many people so I want to do it with cata
crossbows<00:04:08.200> and<00:04:08.470> have<00:04:08.920> a<00:04:08.950> bow<00:04:09.160> that<00:04:09.370> probably<00:04:09.610> a

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:09.700 
crossbows and have a bow that probably a

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.310 
crossbows and have a bow that probably a
lot<00:04:09.730> more<00:04:09.970> people<00:04:10.120> have<00:04:10.390> and<00:04:10.750> actually<00:04:10.930> would

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:11.320 
lot more people have and actually would

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:13.170 
lot more people have and actually would
use<00:04:11.590> you<00:04:12.160> can<00:04:12.310> also<00:04:12.459> use<00:04:12.700> them<00:04:12.850> with<00:04:12.970> Royal

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.180 
use you can also use them with Royal

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:15.210 
use you can also use them with Royal
crossbow<00:04:13.660> if<00:04:13.840> you'd<00:04:13.959> like<00:04:14.170> they<00:04:14.709> do<00:04:14.770> work<00:04:15.040> with

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
crossbow if you'd like they do work with

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.789 
crossbow if you'd like they do work with
that<00:04:15.400> but<00:04:16.030> overall<00:04:16.330> as<00:04:16.570> you<00:04:16.690> can<00:04:16.840> see<00:04:17.049> this<00:04:17.620> is

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799 
that but overall as you can see this is

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:19.289 
that but overall as you can see this is
with<00:04:17.950> the<00:04:18.100> Dragon<00:04:18.400> Balls<00:04:18.669> and<00:04:18.820> I<00:04:18.910> actually<00:04:19.060> do

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:19.299 
with the Dragon Balls and I actually do

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:21.300 
with the Dragon Balls and I actually do
a<00:04:19.330> test<00:04:19.600> with<00:04:19.780> royal<00:04:20.080> bolt<00:04:20.350> after<00:04:20.560> the<00:04:21.010> dragon

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:21.310 
a test with royal bolt after the dragon

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:23.820 
a test with royal bolt after the dragon
paint<00:04:21.489> bolts<00:04:21.760> same<00:04:22.330> exact<00:04:22.690> gear<00:04:22.960> same<00:04:23.500> exact

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
paint bolts same exact gear same exact

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.640 
paint bolts same exact gear same exact
kill<00:04:24.070> really<00:04:24.750> and<00:04:25.750> it's<00:04:26.080> much<00:04:26.260> much<00:04:26.470> faster

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 
kill really and it's much much faster

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:27.120 
kill really and it's much much faster
with<00:04:26.950> the

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
with the

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:28.650 
with the
in<00:04:27.280> Maine<00:04:27.430> bolds<00:04:27.730> so<00:04:28.090> what<00:04:28.210> the<00:04:28.300> dragon<00:04:28.540> men

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:28.660 
in Maine bolds so what the dragon men

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:30.210 
in Maine bolds so what the dragon men
bolts<00:04:28.900> do<00:04:29.020> is<00:04:29.140> when<00:04:29.320> used<00:04:29.530> against<00:04:29.860> dragons

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
bolts do is when used against dragons

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.520 
bolts do is when used against dragons
they're<00:04:30.400> plus<00:04:30.730> 25%<00:04:31.210> more<00:04:31.690> damage<00:04:32.080> so<00:04:32.500> that

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:32.530 
they're plus 25% more damage so that

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:35.250 
they're plus 25% more damage so that
brings<00:04:32.890> a<00:04:33.100> dragon<00:04:33.400> Mabel<00:04:33.640> up<00:04:33.820> to<00:04:34.030> 720<00:04:34.750> damage

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:35.260 
brings a dragon Mabel up to 720 damage

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.230 
brings a dragon Mabel up to 720 damage
which<00:04:35.470> I<00:04:35.650> believe<00:04:35.980> is<00:04:36.160> around<00:04:36.670> roughly<00:04:37.000> the

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:37.240 
which I believe is around roughly the

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.360 
which I believe is around roughly the
same<00:04:37.420> as<00:04:37.600> a<00:04:37.630> royal<00:04:37.870> bolt<00:04:38.170> but<00:04:38.770> they<00:04:39.010> also<00:04:39.160> add

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.370 
same as a royal bolt but they also add

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:42.180 
same as a royal bolt but they also add
30%<00:04:40.270> more<00:04:40.420> accuracy<00:04:40.900> so<00:04:41.320> that's<00:04:41.800> not<00:04:42.010> useful

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:42.190 
30% more accuracy so that's not useful

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:44.910 
30% more accuracy so that's not useful
most<00:04:43.030> places<00:04:43.270> where<00:04:43.600> you<00:04:43.660> use<00:04:44.140> arrows<00:04:44.650> since

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:44.920 
most places where you use arrows since

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:46.650 
most places where you use arrows since
like<00:04:45.100> most<00:04:45.370> dragons<00:04:45.730> for<00:04:45.940> example<00:04:46.240> celestial

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:46.660 
like most dragons for example celestial

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:47.970 
like most dragons for example celestial
dragons<00:04:47.050> or<00:04:47.140> black<00:04:47.320> dragons<00:04:47.680> you're<00:04:47.800> going<00:04:47.920> to

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:47.980 
dragons or black dragons you're going to

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:50.100 
dragons or black dragons you're going to
have<00:04:48.100> really<00:04:48.340> good<00:04:48.520> accuracy<00:04:48.910> as<00:04:49.150> it<00:04:49.390> is<00:04:49.510> but

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.110 
have really good accuracy as it is but

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:52.290 
have really good accuracy as it is but
against<00:04:50.440> QbD<00:04:51.010> which<00:04:51.370> often<00:04:51.820> you<00:04:51.970> will<00:04:52.150> have

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:52.300 
against QbD which often you will have

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.300 
against QbD which often you will have
some<00:04:52.570> accuracy<00:04:53.170> problems<00:04:53.560> usually<00:04:53.830> I<00:04:53.860> just

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:54.310 
some accuracy problems usually I just

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:56.880 
some accuracy problems usually I just
don't<00:04:54.640> miss<00:04:54.910> I<00:04:55.180> am<00:04:55.750> overloaded<00:04:56.410> of<00:04:56.530> course<00:04:56.740> and

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:56.890 
don't miss I am overloaded of course and

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:58.320 
don't miss I am overloaded of course and
I<00:04:56.920> am<00:04:57.070> using<00:04:57.280> turmoil<00:04:57.820> so<00:04:57.940> that<00:04:58.060> probably

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:58.330 
I am using turmoil so that probably

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:59.760 
I am using turmoil so that probably
helps<00:04:58.570> a<00:04:58.630> little<00:04:58.750> bit<00:04:58.990> but<00:04:59.290> as<00:04:59.410> you<00:04:59.620> will<00:04:59.710> see

00:04:59.760 --> 00:04:59.770 
helps a little bit but as you will see

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:01.350 
helps a little bit but as you will see
when<00:05:00.100> I'm<00:05:00.220> using<00:05:00.370> my<00:05:00.580> royal<00:05:00.820> bolts<00:05:01.180> I<00:05:01.240> actually

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:01.360 
when I'm using my royal bolts I actually

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.380 
when I'm using my royal bolts I actually
splash<00:05:01.840> quite<00:05:02.170> a<00:05:02.200> bit<00:05:02.470> and<00:05:02.620> with<00:05:03.070> these<00:05:03.390> dragon

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:04.390 
splash quite a bit and with these dragon

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:05.850 
splash quite a bit and with these dragon
being<00:05:04.510> bolts<00:05:04.720> I<00:05:04.750> really<00:05:05.020> don't<00:05:05.230> splash<00:05:05.560> at<00:05:05.770> all

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:05.860 
being bolts I really don't splash at all

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:06.690 
being bolts I really don't splash at all
it's<00:05:06.040> pretty<00:05:06.190> incredible

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:06.700 
it's pretty incredible

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:09.210 
it's pretty incredible
so<00:05:07.120> my<00:05:07.540> first<00:05:07.930> ever<00:05:08.140> kill<00:05:08.440> dragon<00:05:08.860> maid<00:05:08.980> bolts

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:09.220 
so my first ever kill dragon maid bolts

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:11.490 
so my first ever kill dragon maid bolts
I<00:05:09.250> got<00:05:09.430> 152<00:05:10.120> that<00:05:10.360> is<00:05:10.480> not<00:05:10.660> like<00:05:10.840> a<00:05:10.870> record<00:05:11.290> time

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:11.500 
I got 152 that is not like a record time

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:13.110 
I got 152 that is not like a record time
or<00:05:11.650> anything<00:05:11.800> and<00:05:12.010> you<00:05:12.070> can<00:05:12.310> definitely<00:05:12.640> get

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:13.120 
or anything and you can definitely get

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.300 
or anything and you can definitely get
faster<00:05:13.660> kills<00:05:13.900> than<00:05:14.080> that<00:05:14.260> I'm<00:05:14.470> using<00:05:15.040> the

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:15.310 
faster kills than that I'm using the

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:16.770 
faster kills than that I'm using the
cata<00:05:15.490> crossbow<00:05:15.940> with<00:05:16.180> dragon<00:05:16.510> bang

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:16.780 
cata crossbow with dragon bang

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:18.810 
cata crossbow with dragon bang
however<00:05:17.410> that's<00:05:17.860> really<00:05:18.280> really<00:05:18.460> good<00:05:18.610> that's

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:18.820 
however that's really really good that's

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:20.580 
however that's really really good that's
pretty<00:05:19.000> much<00:05:19.180> comparable<00:05:19.600> to<00:05:19.840> drag<00:05:20.050> oars<00:05:20.290> and

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:20.590 
pretty much comparable to drag oars and

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:22.830 
pretty much comparable to drag oars and
of<00:05:20.980> course<00:05:21.250> when<00:05:21.940> you're<00:05:22.030> off<00:05:22.240> that's<00:05:22.660> like

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:22.840 
of course when you're off that's like

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:24.300 
of course when you're off that's like
comparable<00:05:23.320> to<00:05:23.410> using<00:05:23.680> drag<00:05:23.860> orders<00:05:24.130> on

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:24.310 
comparable to using drag orders on

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:26.250 
comparable to using drag orders on
slayer<00:05:24.670> task<00:05:24.940> and<00:05:25.150> this<00:05:25.240> is<00:05:25.390> officer<00:05:25.720> task<00:05:25.990> and

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:26.260 
slayer task and this is officer task and

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.110 
slayer task and this is officer task and
yes<00:05:26.590> I<00:05:26.740> am<00:05:26.770> aware<00:05:26.950> that<00:05:27.250> you<00:05:27.400> can<00:05:27.580> get<00:05:27.730> faster

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:28.120 
yes I am aware that you can get faster

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:29.880 
yes I am aware that you can get faster
kills<00:05:28.360> and<00:05:28.570> not<00:05:28.660> using<00:05:29.020> drag<00:05:29.200> oars<00:05:29.470> but<00:05:29.650> you

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:29.890 
kills and not using drag oars but you

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:31.410 
kills and not using drag oars but you
can<00:05:30.070> also<00:05:30.220> get<00:05:30.490> faster<00:05:30.910> kills<00:05:31.120> than<00:05:31.270> that

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:31.420 
can also get faster kills than that

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:33.960 
can also get faster kills than that
using<00:05:31.840> dragonbane<00:05:32.770> with<00:05:33.400> the<00:05:33.580> chaotic<00:05:33.880> I

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:33.970 
using dragonbane with the chaotic I

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:35.100 
using dragonbane with the chaotic I
suppose<00:05:34.270> just<00:05:34.420> keep<00:05:34.600> in<00:05:34.690> mind<00:05:34.840> that<00:05:34.930> was<00:05:35.020> my

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:35.110 
suppose just keep in mind that was my

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:36.900 
suppose just keep in mind that was my
first<00:05:35.320> ever<00:05:35.500> kill<00:05:35.680> using<00:05:35.950> them<00:05:36.040> I<00:05:36.190> am<00:05:36.520> not<00:05:36.700> used

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:36.910 
first ever kill using them I am not used

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:38.520 
first ever kill using them I am not used
to<00:05:37.030> killing<00:05:37.330> QED<00:05:37.720> with<00:05:37.840> range<00:05:38.050> at<00:05:38.200> all<00:05:38.290> so<00:05:38.470> I

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:38.530 
to killing QED with range at all so I

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:40.440 
to killing QED with range at all so I
kind<00:05:38.800> of<00:05:38.860> had<00:05:39.010> no<00:05:39.190> clue<00:05:39.760> what<00:05:39.820> I'm<00:05:40.000> doing<00:05:40.240> I<00:05:40.330> was

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:40.450 
kind of had no clue what I'm doing I was

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:42.000 
kind of had no clue what I'm doing I was
still<00:05:40.630> able<00:05:40.750> to<00:05:40.900> get<00:05:41.080> a<00:05:41.110> sub<00:05:41.350> two-minute<00:05:41.830> kill

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:42.010 
still able to get a sub two-minute kill

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:43.260 
still able to get a sub two-minute kill
so<00:05:42.190> I<00:05:42.220> thought<00:05:42.490> that<00:05:42.640> was<00:05:42.730> really<00:05:42.880> good<00:05:43.090> and

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:43.270 
so I thought that was really good and

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:44.910 
so I thought that was really good and
here's<00:05:43.750> my<00:05:43.900> test<00:05:44.110> with<00:05:44.230> the<00:05:44.320> Royal<00:05:44.500> bolts<00:05:44.770> as

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:44.920 
here's my test with the Royal bolts as

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:46.590 
here's my test with the Royal bolts as
you<00:05:45.100> can<00:05:45.250> see<00:05:45.430> I'm<00:05:45.640> just<00:05:45.670> splashing<00:05:46.300> a<00:05:46.390> lot

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:46.600 
you can see I'm just splashing a lot

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:48.450 
you can see I'm just splashing a lot
really<00:05:46.930> missing<00:05:47.320> a<00:05:47.380> lot<00:05:47.530> the<00:05:47.830> only<00:05:48.010> problem<00:05:48.430> is

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:48.460 
really missing a lot the only problem is

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:50.310 
really missing a lot the only problem is
like<00:05:48.550> robots<00:05:49.090> do<00:05:49.300> decent<00:05:49.630> damage<00:05:49.810> but<00:05:50.170> it's

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:50.320 
like robots do decent damage but it's

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:51.810 
like robots do decent damage but it's
more<00:05:50.440> of<00:05:50.530> the<00:05:50.590> accuracy<00:05:51.220> that<00:05:51.370> is<00:05:51.430> really<00:05:51.730> the

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:51.820 
more of the accuracy that is really the

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:53.790 
more of the accuracy that is really the
problem<00:05:51.910> with<00:05:52.180> the<00:05:52.240> cata<00:05:52.450> crossbows<00:05:52.990> you<00:05:53.680> have

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:53.800 
problem with the cata crossbows you have

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.860 
problem with the cata crossbows you have
a<00:05:53.830> bit<00:05:53.980> more<00:05:54.010> accuracy<00:05:54.550> when<00:05:54.880> using<00:05:55.120> ascension

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:55.870 
a bit more accuracy when using ascension

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:57.690 
a bit more accuracy when using ascension
crossbows<00:05:56.260> with<00:05:56.410> ascension<00:05:56.680> bolts<00:05:57.040> but<00:05:57.220> even

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:57.700 
crossbows with ascension bolts but even

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:59.400 
crossbows with ascension bolts but even
using<00:05:57.850> the<00:05:58.060> centrum<00:05:58.390> crossbows<00:05:58.810> that<00:05:59.290> is

00:05:59.400 --> 00:05:59.410 
using the centrum crossbows that is

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:01.140 
using the centrum crossbows that is
without<00:05:59.830> the<00:06:00.010> dragon<00:06:00.190> brain<00:06:00.460> bolts<00:06:00.730> you<00:06:00.880> still

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:01.150 
without the dragon brain bolts you still

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:03.510 
without the dragon brain bolts you still
do<00:06:01.360> splash<00:06:01.720> a<00:06:01.750> decent<00:06:02.350> amount<00:06:02.440> so<00:06:03.250> that's<00:06:03.400> why

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:03.520 
do splash a decent amount so that's why

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:04.800 
do splash a decent amount so that's why
these<00:06:03.580> dragon<00:06:04.030> bolts<00:06:04.390> are<00:06:04.450> just<00:06:04.630> so

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:04.810 
these dragon bolts are just so

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:06.870 
these dragon bolts are just so
incredibly<00:06:05.050> effective<00:06:05.890> you<00:06:06.100> just<00:06:06.310> don't<00:06:06.670> miss

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:06.880 
incredibly effective you just don't miss

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:08.430 
incredibly effective you just don't miss
it<00:06:07.060> all<00:06:07.180> especially<00:06:07.450> if<00:06:07.810> you're<00:06:07.930> on<00:06:07.960> a<00:06:08.110> slayer

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:08.440 
it all especially if you're on a slayer

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:11.190 
it all especially if you're on a slayer
task<00:06:08.680> where<00:06:08.950> you<00:06:09.010> have<00:06:09.160> that<00:06:09.340> bonus<00:06:10.200> 14%

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:11.200 
task where you have that bonus 14%

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:13.110 
task where you have that bonus 14%
accuracy<00:06:11.710> from<00:06:11.860> the<00:06:12.010> slayer<00:06:12.250> helm<00:06:12.400> it<00:06:12.670> tears

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:13.120 
accuracy from the slayer helm it tears

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:15.720 
accuracy from the slayer helm it tears
them<00:06:13.360> the<00:06:14.260> QbD<00:06:14.560> apart<00:06:14.800> so<00:06:15.010> as<00:06:15.190> you<00:06:15.550> saw<00:06:15.700> I

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:15.730 
them the QbD apart so as you saw I

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:17.400 
them the QbD apart so as you saw I
didn't<00:06:16.000> mess<00:06:16.120> up<00:06:16.150> there<00:06:16.480> I<00:06:16.510> wasted<00:06:17.020> like<00:06:17.200> I

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:17.410 
didn't mess up there I wasted like I

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:19.080 
didn't mess up there I wasted like I
don't<00:06:17.470> know<00:06:17.620> four<00:06:17.890> or<00:06:18.010> five<00:06:18.160> seconds<00:06:18.580> by<00:06:18.790> miss

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:19.090 
don't know four or five seconds by miss

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:21.390 
don't know four or five seconds by miss
clicking<00:06:19.480> I<00:06:19.770> kind<00:06:20.770> of<00:06:20.830> miss<00:06:20.980> clicked<00:06:21.190> on<00:06:21.310> the

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:21.400 
clicking I kind of miss clicked on the

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:22.770 
clicking I kind of miss clicked on the
tortured<00:06:21.700> soul<00:06:21.940> and<00:06:22.090> then<00:06:22.180> miss<00:06:22.360> clicked<00:06:22.630> and

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:22.780 
tortured soul and then miss clicked and

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:24.480 
tortured soul and then miss clicked and
ran<00:06:22.900> into<00:06:23.080> the<00:06:23.170> firewall<00:06:23.560> so<00:06:23.740> I<00:06:24.100> mean<00:06:24.400> this

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:24.490 
ran into the firewall so I mean this

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:25.560 
ran into the firewall so I mean this
kill<00:06:24.700> could<00:06:24.910> have<00:06:25.000> been<00:06:25.120> four<00:06:25.360> or<00:06:25.450> five

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:25.570 
kill could have been four or five

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:28.650 
kill could have been four or five
seconds<00:06:25.990> faster<00:06:26.380> but<00:06:26.920> overall<00:06:27.250> I<00:06:27.670> mean<00:06:27.730> dragon

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:28.660 
seconds faster but overall I mean dragon

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:30.390 
seconds faster but overall I mean dragon
main<00:06:28.900> bolts<00:06:29.080> are<00:06:29.200> still<00:06:29.410> just<00:06:29.590> a<00:06:29.680> lot<00:06:29.950> faster

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:30.400 
main bolts are still just a lot faster

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:32.550 
main bolts are still just a lot faster
to<00:06:30.430> kill<00:06:30.670> QB<00:06:31.030> and<00:06:31.210> also<00:06:31.840> I<00:06:31.870> mean<00:06:32.050> you<00:06:32.200> only<00:06:32.320> use

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:32.560 
to kill QB and also I mean you only use

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:34.710 
to kill QB and also I mean you only use
a<00:06:32.590> couple<00:06:33.070> bolts<00:06:33.220> a<00:06:33.430> kill<00:06:33.640> so<00:06:33.970> if<00:06:34.240> you<00:06:34.390> only<00:06:34.600> use

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:34.720 
a couple bolts a kill so if you only use

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:37.469 
a couple bolts a kill so if you only use
these<00:06:35.110> dragon<00:06:35.440> baton<00:06:35.590> bolts<00:06:35.830> on<00:06:35.979> qbd<00:06:36.520> you're

00:06:37.469 --> 00:06:37.479 
these dragon baton bolts on qbd you're

00:06:37.479 --> 00:06:39.270 
these dragon baton bolts on qbd you're
really<00:06:37.840> going<00:06:38.350> to<00:06:38.470> have<00:06:38.590> them<00:06:38.950> last

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:39.280 
really going to have them last

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:41.430 
really going to have them last
