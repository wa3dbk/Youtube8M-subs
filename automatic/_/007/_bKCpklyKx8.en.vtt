that folder they all need each other in

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.360 
that folder they all need each other in
order<00:02:14.480> to<00:02:14.600> run<00:02:14.750> properly<00:02:14.830> so<00:02:15.830> let's<00:02:16.069> launch

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
order to run properly so let's launch

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.400 
order to run properly so let's launch
the<00:02:16.670> model<00:02:17.000> a<00:02:17.060> virtual<00:02:17.420> brain<00:02:17.690> program<00:02:18.230> by

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
the model a virtual brain program by

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.949 
the model a virtual brain program by
double<00:02:18.740> clicking<00:02:18.980> that<00:02:19.220> and<00:02:19.569> the<00:02:20.569> first<00:02:20.780> thing

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 
double clicking that and the first thing

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:22.449 
double clicking that and the first thing
we'll<00:02:21.080> do<00:02:21.170> when<00:02:21.319> the<00:02:21.409> program<00:02:21.739> opens<00:02:22.099> up<00:02:22.280> is

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
we'll do when the program opens up is

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:25.570 
we'll do when the program opens up is
set<00:02:23.450> up<00:02:23.569> our<00:02:23.690> driver<00:02:24.049> window<00:02:24.349> so<00:02:25.099> the<00:02:25.220> program

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
set up our driver window so the program

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:26.350 
set up our driver window so the program
rec

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
rec

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.110

izes<00:02:26.870> our<00:02:27.140> pad<00:02:27.890> that<00:02:28.340> we've<00:02:28.460> plugged<00:02:28.700> into<00:02:28.940> the

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
izes our pad that we've plugged into the

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.530 
izes our pad that we've plugged into the
USB<00:02:29.360> port<00:02:29.510> and<00:02:30.280> so<00:02:31.280> that<00:02:31.490> we<00:02:31.730> have<00:02:31.940> set<00:02:32.180> up<00:02:32.330> the

USB port and so that we have set up the

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.590 
USB port and so that we have set up the
audio<00:02:32.780> output<00:02:33.230> properly<00:02:34.070> okay<00:02:35.060> so<00:02:35.120> here<00:02:35.480> we

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
audio output properly okay so here we

is now represented by this pad number

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.729 
is now represented by this pad number
one<00:03:09.500> up<00:03:09.680> here<00:03:09.860> in<00:03:09.950> the<00:03:10.040> software<00:03:10.400> and<00:03:10.989> if<00:03:11.989> you

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:12.739 
one up here in the software and if you

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:16.390 
one up here in the software and if you
actually<00:03:13.070> tap<00:03:13.280> on<00:03:13.520> your<00:03:13.670> pad<00:03:13.880> now<00:03:15.040> you'll<00:03:16.040> see

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
actually tap on your pad now you'll see

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.130 
actually tap on your pad now you'll see
you're<00:03:17.120> getting<00:03:17.239> a<00:03:17.450> reading<00:03:17.660> there<00:03:17.900> on<00:03:18.020> the

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
you're getting a reading there on the

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:19.690 
you're getting a reading there on the
screen<00:03:18.350> exactly<00:03:18.980> where<00:03:19.130> you're<00:03:19.280> tapping<00:03:19.610> on

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
screen exactly where you're tapping on

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.010 
screen exactly where you're tapping on
your<00:03:19.730> pad<00:03:19.970> so<00:03:20.180> you<00:03:20.209> know<00:03:20.420> that<00:03:20.570> you<00:03:20.630> just<00:03:20.840> set

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:21.020 
your pad so you know that you just set

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:23.140 
your pad so you know that you just set
up<00:03:21.050> that<00:03:21.170> connection<00:03:21.590> properly<00:03:22.190> okay<00:03:22.940> now<00:03:23.090> we

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
up that connection properly okay now we

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:24.940 
up that connection properly okay now we
want<00:03:23.360> to<00:03:23.420> make<00:03:23.540> sure<00:03:23.570> the<00:03:23.750> audio<00:03:24.050> works<00:03:24.410> so

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
want to make sure the audio works so

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:28.020 
want to make sure the audio works so
let's<00:03:25.160> turn<00:03:25.400> audio<00:03:25.850> on<00:03:26.120> and<00:03:26.690> in<00:03:27.410> the<00:03:27.500> driver

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
let's turn audio on and in the driver

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.580 
let's turn audio on and in the driver
