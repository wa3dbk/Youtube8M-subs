 she was so not overcooked 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:01.440
 beets were boiled 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:08.220
 peeled and grated 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:12.299

 contains enough salt 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:06.340

 all the salad is ready the salad is ready it's healthy 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:36.400

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.269
 a lot of fiber and this salad to cook 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.180
 not difficult 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:42.909
