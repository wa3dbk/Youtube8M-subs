00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:13.330 
well my sense is that when we try to

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:16.500 
well my sense is that when we try to
take<00:00:13.600> the<00:00:14.110> bull<00:00:14.559> by<00:00:14.590> the<00:00:15.000> orange<00:00:16.000> were<00:00:16.299> the

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:16.510 
take the bull by the orange were the

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:19.859 
take the bull by the orange were the
ones<00:00:16.950> that<00:00:17.950> end<00:00:18.220> up<00:00:18.340> getting<00:00:18.640> hurt<00:00:18.849> you<00:00:19.689> know

and hopefully we're gonna start to learn

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.069 
and hopefully we're gonna start to learn
from<00:00:47.290> that<00:00:47.350> experience<00:00:48.270> that<00:00:49.270> this<00:00:49.480> is<00:00:49.660> not

00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:50.079 
from that experience that this is not

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:53.180 
from that experience that this is not
the<00:00:50.440> way<00:00:50.649> to<00:00:50.680> bring<00:00:51.250> healing<00:00:51.550> to<00:00:52.180> ourselves

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
feelings of less than sometimes it helps

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.590 
feelings of less than sometimes it helps
to<00:02:02.530> close<00:02:02.799> our<00:02:03.189> eyes<00:02:03.490> like<00:02:03.970> when<00:02:04.180> we<00:02:04.390> meditate

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
to close our eyes like when we meditate

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.980 
to close our eyes like when we meditate
because<00:02:05.380> the<00:02:05.619> idea<00:02:06.100> of<00:02:06.509> looking<00:02:07.509> outside

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
because the idea of looking outside

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:13.970 
because the idea of looking outside
there<00:02:08.920> for<00:02:10.110> love<00:02:11.110> and<00:02:11.500> approval<00:02:12.489> doesn't<00:02:13.239> work

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
there for love and approval doesn't work

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:19.890 
there for love and approval doesn't work
so<00:02:14.980> as<00:02:15.190> we<00:02:15.400> turn<00:02:15.760> our<00:02:16.060> gaze<00:02:16.570> inside<00:02:18.180> and<00:02:19.180> we

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
so as we turn our gaze inside and we

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.950 
so as we turn our gaze inside and we
look<00:02:20.590> for<00:02:20.980> that

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
look for that

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:26.510 
look for that
place<00:02:22.530> of<00:02:22.560> peace<00:02:23.300> inside<00:02:24.300> and<00:02:25.260> we<00:02:26.130> breathe

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
place of peace inside and we breathe

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:32.750 
place of peace inside and we breathe
into<00:02:26.850> that<00:02:29.990> we<00:02:30.990> begin<00:02:31.350> to<00:02:31.560> discover<00:02:32.040> that<00:02:32.520> it

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
into that we begin to discover that it

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.160 
into that we begin to discover that it
is<00:02:32.790> there<00:02:33.390> maybe<00:02:34.260> in<00:02:34.680> the<00:02:35.340> beginning<00:02:36.170> it's

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
is there maybe in the beginning it's

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.720 
is there maybe in the beginning it's
just<00:02:37.650> a<00:02:37.860> few<00:02:38.190> seconds<00:02:38.730> of<00:02:38.910> peace<00:02:40.250> maybe<00:02:41.250> it's<00:02:41.460> a

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
just a few seconds of peace maybe it's a

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.970 
just a few seconds of peace maybe it's a
few<00:02:41.940> minutes<00:02:43.160> but<00:02:44.160> as<00:02:44.340> we<00:02:45.080> go<00:02:46.080> into<00:02:46.470> the

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
few minutes but as we go into the

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.880 
few minutes but as we go into the
process<00:02:47.550> of<00:02:47.700> loving<00:02:48.060> ourselves<00:02:48.240> and<00:02:48.990> make<00:02:49.740> the

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
process of loving ourselves and make the

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.760 
process of loving ourselves and make the
commitment<00:02:50.550> to<00:02:50.730> doing<00:02:50.910> that<00:02:51.350> we're<00:02:52.350> able<00:02:52.530> to

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
commitment to doing that we're able to

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:56.600 
commitment to doing that we're able to
find<00:02:53.040> that<00:02:53.250> place<00:02:53.460> more<00:02:53.970> in<00:02:54.210> more<00:02:54.950> often<00:02:55.950> it

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
find that place more in more often it

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.100 
find that place more in more often it
doesn't<00:02:56.820> mean<00:02:57.060> we<00:02:57.180> stop<00:02:57.390> taking<00:02:57.810> the<00:02:57.930> bull<00:02:58.080> by

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
doesn't mean we stop taking the bull by

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.100 
doesn't mean we stop taking the bull by
the<00:02:58.260> horns<00:02:58.970> we<00:02:59.970> go<00:03:00.120> right<00:03:00.330> back<00:03:00.360> out<00:03:00.750> there<00:03:00.960> and
