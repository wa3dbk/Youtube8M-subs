00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:24.000
 we have some important the reality of the 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.920
 metropolitan of Rome 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.090
 we know that the metro c will go ahead of 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.150
 all that has been said in these 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:34.350
 days to desserts stop however it is not 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:36.870
 true is not true there was in 2006 gross 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.690
 increase in the cost of the subway 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.829
 planned concerning previous 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.360
 administrations 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.730
 today there are all the resources for 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.370
 get to the colosseum 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.920
 the problem is after the coliseum and per 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.960
 regarding piazza venezia and beyond 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.539
 we are facing it but up to 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.000
 Colosseum to the intersection will see that 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.850
 actually go be the meter to that 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.350
 with the metro b there are the resources 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.969
 support us for the increases were 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.100
 in the past there are no others 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.619
 then united on the Rome underground 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.930
 nonsense was integrated and yes 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.549
 continues to a work of defamation that 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.110
 does not affect so much and alone 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.970
 the administration because it says that 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.920
 offends the daily work of many 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.960
 so many patients who work every day 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.049
 they do everything to keep these going 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.909
 metropolitan and well does all this with 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.140
 scary cuts in public transport 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.479
 local 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.790
 those who see these works must 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.159
 remember that we have a cut 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:35.130
 of state and region transfers on 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:38.100
 then 42 percent exchange rate 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.770
 a very difficult reality and despite 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.640
 this attacks goes on that day after 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.190
 has in front 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.380
 rome in its caregiver compensation 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:47.970
 when what is your historian of 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.340
 this city that the problem of 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.080
 traffic and mobility then after 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.290
 this way that was the ticket 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:57.060
 access the access door to the city 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.380
 we will go ahead will proceed for 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.760
 as for the transportation of 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.460
 surface and in June 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:04.590
 we will deliver with the part minus c is that 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.790
 other penalty of meter b1 therefore I find 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.770
 elections out of controversy 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.840
 hopefully in a climate of election 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.880
 tranquility we will deliver and when 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.430
 will be delivered there will be 50 per 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.770
 one hundred more food than in 2008 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:19.470
 of this I must thank the assessor 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.970
 actor from the igea and after him 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.320
 the commissioner maria hopes because not 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.360
 worked a lot on this point of view 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.760
 they do not face very difficult problems 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.100
 we know how many buildings and coordinate the 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:32.010
 different different powers of este 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:34.050
 expectations of administrations e 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.370
 of the different photographs but the end ce 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.290
 we did it and in the end it goes on 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.330
 from this point of view and these are 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.310
 construction sites that were working in thousands of 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.810
 people the yards extremely 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.460
 important 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.560
 the last point is the last underline 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:48.330
 that made it is just that 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.010
 possibility of giving the job of giving 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.930
 development to our city through 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.989
 these great infrastructural works 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:57.300
 through this we will go ahead and 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:59.959
 I believe we are made for the whole city 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.959
 thank you
