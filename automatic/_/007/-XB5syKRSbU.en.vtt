00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 he 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.360
 it is a very efficient machine for surf challenge here I am underlined so 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:10.230
 it's not necessarily the same this gentleman 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.639
 the most effective here are the two search engines under the keyboard 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.639
 we will attack the said 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.929
 and we end up on the blog 

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:31.049
 So the machine displays all of this peacefully 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.250
 fast enough 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.159
 even big fat items 

00:00:37.159 --> 00:00:39.240
 priori 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.240
 it works well 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.200
 this one 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.240
 all display very quickly it is little to say that problem 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.690
 we will launch a youtube video 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.440
 at 11:10 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.220
 for surfing again this is a very very very nice solution 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.680
 in europe it's going pretty well here as sweet home 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.120
 but a multitouch management 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.510
 complete so for the young zoom out a little bit my page a little of the sleeve 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.510
 than consume it 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:26.910
 as if the past in fashion 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.330
 portrait 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.820
 of this beautiful display here is north 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.600
 for the moment I am able to display troubleshooting so 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:43.720
 very correct 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.060
 and for dexia 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.220
 with tubman according to a beautiful and a beautiful image of brightness 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.240
 but one of them even price that we can succeed their ticket to his 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.090
 eyes to follow 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.360
 too heavy even 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.360
 with a lot a lot of imagery and it's pretty much 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.850
 very well we try to return another 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:03.210
 a youtube video 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.980
 we will be easy 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:06.560
 in the morning he has a name 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.200
 except that here I am in 720p on youtube I hope it's time to change a 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.200
 a bit 

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:18.649
 we get the impression that fangs goodbye 103 forcing to stop 

00:02:22.119 --> 00:02:25.119
 yes according to the same source 

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:29.839
 I'm shopping 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:34.090
 they still did its bit as well in its role without 

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:36.329
 difficulty on the quarterly dashboard 

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:39.170
 this type of processor the go his graphics circuit know how to handle 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.569
 the pier they are together for no more 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:46.379
 here is a good surfing solution also to report it on a site 

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:49.949
 known as the world 

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:56.039
 I saw the site quite heavy 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:11.559
 so we are waiting 

00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:13.519
 here, however, 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:14.969
 also very fast 

00:03:14.969 --> 00:03:17.969
 of the page 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:21.899
 absolutely 

00:03:21.899 --> 00:03:24.899
 quite exploitable 

00:03:31.469 --> 00:03:34.469
 you go on the left diffuse page 

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:50.909
 having started 

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:52.469
 rather fast 

00:03:52.469 --> 00:03:55.469
 it works pretty well 

00:03:58.689 --> 00:04:00.739
 a game in schruns miss 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:01.889
 very fluid and very bad
