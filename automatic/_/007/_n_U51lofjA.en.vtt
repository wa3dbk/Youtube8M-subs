and<00:04:07.220> it's<00:04:08.220> great<00:04:08.430> so<00:04:08.760> these<00:04:09.209> were<00:04:09.599> I<00:04:09.930> think<00:04:09.989> and

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
and it's great so these were I think and

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:13.460 
and it's great so these were I think and
they<00:04:11.609> were<00:04:11.669> originally<00:04:11.959> 140<00:04:12.959> from<00:04:13.139> Lord<00:04:13.319> &amp;

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
they were originally 140 from Lord &amp;

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:14.599 
they were originally 140 from Lord &amp;
Taylor<00:04:13.739> but<00:04:13.919> they<00:04:14.010> were<00:04:14.099> doing<00:04:14.250> twenty

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:14.609 
Taylor but they were doing twenty

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:16.310 
Taylor but they were doing twenty
percent<00:04:14.849> off<00:04:15.060> so<00:04:15.299> it<00:04:15.419> worked<00:04:15.660> out<00:04:15.780> to<00:04:15.959> be<00:04:16.049> I

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
percent off so it worked out to be I

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.779 
percent off so it worked out to be I
think<00:04:16.739> i<00:04:16.799> paid<00:04:16.949> about<00:04:17.209> 120<00:04:18.209> for<00:04:18.389> these

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:19.789

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.560 
naughty cuz this was three hundred and

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.520 
naughty cuz this was three hundred and
fifty<00:05:04.860> dollars<00:05:05.250> and<00:05:05.610> I<00:05:06.150> forgot<00:05:07.020> that<00:05:07.229> there's

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:07.530

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 
like texts and stuff so it has to be a

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:10.850 
like texts and stuff so it has to be a
little<00:05:09.270> bit<00:05:09.389> more<00:05:09.599> than<00:05:09.780> that<00:05:09.990> but<00:05:10.469> I<00:05:10.529> really

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:10.860 
little bit more than that but I really

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:12.740

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:15.679 
it so it's all work to ask me like 20
miles<00:05:14.879> cheaper<00:05:15.150> than<00:05:15.270> what<00:05:15.389> i<00:05:15.449> would<00:05:15.659> have

00:05:15.679 --> 00:05:15.689 
miles cheaper than what i would have

00:05:15.689 --> 00:05:17.390
