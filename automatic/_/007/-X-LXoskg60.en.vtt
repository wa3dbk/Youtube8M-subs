00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:08.849
 watson everyone has created his 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.670
 hearing open itunes about home 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.980
 iphone min apple and yeah actually 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.509
 it's starting to become so far 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.910
 there are rumors all this but still to 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.470
 to become a small reality that started 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.920
 secret since it spreads from site to site 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.510
 site 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.460
 and then there in my bubble on youtube 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.199
 a see how it would have fallen to 1 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.490
 1 laughing but somewhere in fact 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.470
 like what we have small information 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.810
 here could really deduce from a 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.980
 iphone mini so would be wrong for 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.600
 the moment ends up my heart a 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.969
 phone with reduced dimensions 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.890
 will insure and somewhere we could 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.750
 compare it to this phone just before 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.219
 to taste a topic of waterfalls and apple 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.690
 I really want to give you 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.160
 examples to show you down like 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.289
 what for the moment even though the 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.840
 new generations of smartphones get 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.250
 directs to ready mention more 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.050
 big actually at the waist level of 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.969
 the screen access below that we do not notice 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.710
 that cannabis is this case the bag of 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.600
 bigger bigger screens in 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.430
 autonomy but it's true that if they 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.199
 do versions we'll say reduced 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.770
 ie not like a flat htc with 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.170
 the one 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.630
 the samsung galaxy s 4 we found 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.790
 also in mini version and the lg the g2 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.990
 of umbro also found in small screen 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.580
 so it's true that it's still 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.780
 phones that is debated in 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.240
 each brand since we find in 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.369
 htc and samsung lg is for the moment at 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.750
 Apple's level is well at the level 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.189
 smartphones 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.860
 we do not have a reduced version yet 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.000
 so we really think that in 2014 we have 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.500
 found a room and presents this 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.630
 year there in 2013 we had the end and 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.700
 the iphone tested with this color color 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.049
 with the iphone 5 is it's done we think 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.909
 next year find each other and well 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.579
 again with two smartphones the iphone 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.979
 mini with iphone 6 that will be with big 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.790
 screen the iphone 6 bigger screen than 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.909
 iphone 5 s 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:44.159
 but the iphone the iphone actually min if 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.540
 you want will be smaller than that 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.840
 the iphone face between iphone fifth to 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.460
 screen size level 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.140
 and so at the information level so 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.700
 already with some small conferences 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.829
 all this there have already been conditions that 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.780
 have been asked to loans from apple 

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:57.850
 who have already made this remark there this 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.530
 that we know is that already and they have 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.869
 already said no if you're not that we have 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.340
 already actually created versions of 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:06.789
 reduced dimensions already for others 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:08.890
 for others then for others 

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:09.729
 style interfaces for example and well 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.190
 ipad 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.790
 we found the ipad mini in full 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.379
 ipad 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.090
 and then finally we find it in 

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:16.540
 mini version so certainly we will the 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.000
 find 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.370
 a kind of united iphone was not good 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.170
 happened because they have what they could 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.910
 quote but they also had to for example 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.709
 that certainly be able to find 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:29.230
 next year but there will be new 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:31.420
 iphone generation is the iphone 6 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.640
 with the mimic iphone that will be very 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.530
 little and attention he was quoted so 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.230
 we want to actually create a little 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.700
 smartphone more compact and cheaper 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:43.420
 I hope it's the cheapest will be 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.560
 not mens not really that's 10 less 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.299
 dear I hope it will be really less 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.190
 expensive if it's not like the iphone 5 it's 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:49.989
 or supposedly it is cheaper the more we 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.730
 found at almost the same low price as 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:53.139
 the other iphone no that limit to nothing 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.340
 since it is plastic and 

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:56.109
 frankly I hope he will really 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.700
 a change on it but at the site and 

00:02:56.109 --> 00:03:00.730
 here is a more compact smartphone so 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.109
 have broken reduced more crushed actually if 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.060
 you want to be smaller and less 

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:06.250
 dear so that's really their goal 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.560
 for the year 2014 to create this smartphone 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.720
 there with an iphone 6 in celebration that will 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.120
 much more powerful than the iphone 5 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.099
 is this of course and bigger screen a 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.720
 little sense of resemblance to the 

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:17.500
 galaxy s 4 years old level of 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.989
 the screen so anyway 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.340
 quite a lot in terms of 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:22.450
 characteristics of his I you in 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.980
 will speak very soon for 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:25.690
 the iphone me so far it's true 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.370
 is very we are we are in there neither 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.870
 really an iphone mini is well that's 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:29.889
 that it will be they will actually comprise a 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.569
 more powerful processor 

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:33.970
 simply with the new update 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:35.410
 day you know with ios is actually these 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.959
 workers by rip on can not put a 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:39.370
 old processor program on it's going 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:40.630
 have to really get a new 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.370
 processor because somewhere is going 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:44.470
 have to turn anyway this 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.090
 new this new update which 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.900
 is still pretty low 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:49.090
 large 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:51.400
 it has a lot of things and she 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.670
 will have the same characteristics in fact 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.230
 similar to 2 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:55.760
 to that of iphone 4 so that and we 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:58.040
 will also find itself at the level of 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:00.260
 features with an iphone 4 except 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.060
 smaller more compact and I hope 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.520
 cheaper so that is 300 400 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:05.959
 euros that was already something 

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:07.010
 from extraordinary at apple so at 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:08.450
 level of the features you in 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:10.040
 will speak very soon on the way 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:11.870
 say 5 megapixel camera 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.290
 all that except the processor actually who 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:13.790
 will change 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:15.050
 the German it should be very recent 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:16.760
 processors since as I tell you 

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:18.290
 with its new version the country where s 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.459
 is actually I hope now they 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:21.650
 will have to put a new processor 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:23.810
 because otherwise, there will still be 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:25.700
 a lot of bugs a lot of lag and 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:28.040
 a lot of frieze and that I think it's going 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:29.419
 really really kill the mini iphone which 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.710
 will have after a bad reputation 

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:32.510
 goal is to have a good reputation 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:34.220
 with a price they will put it 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:35.960
 still quite expensive but around 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:38.440
 300 400 euros it will be already some 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:40.070
 something extraordinary you see limit 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.810
 already well chap 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:43.250
 thank you to all the people frankly 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:44.210
 need months have passed in the bar 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:46.100
 comments know it's a 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:47.180
 topic a little bit interesting to 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:49.280
 which one to choose because it is 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:50.630
 really necessary not necessary 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:52.610
 even frankly an iphone maintenance 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:54.470
 nowadays is the iphone 5 is this me 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:56.389
 I have the 4th and they fit well into your 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:57.110
 pocket has no size problem 1 on 

00:04:56.389 --> 00:04:59.390
 agrees 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:01.880
 why look for smaller who is 

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:03.169
 very well already even times stop 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:04.610
 to watch videos all that is 

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:07.370
 a little relou that's good the screen and already 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:09.169
 small but hey we have a larger screen 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:10.610
 like the iphone 6 good there we can we can 

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:12.260
 watch it can be interesting it's 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:14.330
 an evolution for iphone 4 with 26 

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.530
 for people who pass between these two 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:19.820
 generations that can be interesting 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:22.610
 but go to the iphone min good it stays 

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:23.479
 a record a long discussion that 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:25.220
 can do it to have comments 

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:26.330
 no thing what the version see all 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:27.830
 people there seems to be a little I like with 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:28.700
 two especially of me on my page 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:30.260
 personal facebook he modestly 

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:31.370
 often thought that that's it 

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:34.100
 weird then I tell you in la rochelle 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:37.370
 catch up is out it's very weird even 

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:39.380
 iphone mini ipad mini iphone mini it 

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:41.539
 without even logic and no longer to have 

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:42.229
 rumors of that frankly years 

00:05:41.539 --> 00:05:44.380
 2014 

00:05:42.229 --> 00:05:47.380
 it's going to sound do not worry 

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:47.380
 it is
