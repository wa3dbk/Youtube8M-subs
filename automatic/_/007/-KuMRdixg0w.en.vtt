00:00:56.599 --> 00:00:56.609 
to it as does the tongue we'll get to

00:00:56.609 --> 00:00:59.059 
to it as does the tongue we'll get to
the<00:00:56.730> tongue<00:00:56.909> a<00:00:56.940> little<00:00:57.149> later<00:00:57.629> but<00:00:57.899> I'm<00:00:58.679> taking

00:00:59.059 --> 00:00:59.069 
the tongue a little later but I'm taking

the tongue a little later but I'm taking
a<00:00:59.129> color<00:00:59.370> called<00:00:59.640> henna<00:01:00.030> and<00:01:00.659> I'm<00:01:01.379> just

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
a color called henna and I'm just

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:08.450 
a color called henna and I'm just
blocking<00:01:01.920> in<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:03.589> whole<00:01:04.589> nose<00:01:07.159> I'm<00:01:08.159> doing

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
blocking in the whole nose I'm doing

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.250 
blocking in the whole nose I'm doing
this<00:01:08.580> larger<00:01:09.120> so<00:01:09.330> that<00:01:09.360> you<00:01:09.630> can<00:01:09.810> see<00:01:10.110> it<00:01:10.229> a

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
this larger so that you can see it a

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.760 
this larger so that you can see it a
little<00:01:10.560> better<00:01:11.840> and<00:01:12.840> this<00:01:13.140> is<00:01:13.320> kind<00:01:13.590> of<00:01:13.680> the

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
little better and this is kind of the

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.730 
little better and this is kind of the
procedure<00:01:14.190> that<00:01:14.490> I<00:01:14.549> use<00:01:15.229> whenever<00:01:16.229> I<00:01:16.470> do<00:01:16.590> a

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
procedure that I use whenever I do a

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.280 
procedure that I use whenever I do a
nose<00:01:17.340> I<00:01:17.610> had<00:01:17.640> shaded<00:01:18.240> this<00:01:18.420> earlier<00:01:18.840> with<00:01:19.020> dark

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
nose I had shaded this earlier with dark

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.430 
nose I had shaded this earlier with dark
number<00:01:19.740> on<00:01:19.950> this<00:01:20.760> picture<00:01:21.170> I'm<00:01:22.170> gonna<00:01:22.290> go

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:22.440 
number on this picture I'm gonna go

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.170 
number on this picture I'm gonna go
ahead<00:01:22.530> and<00:01:22.770> just<00:01:22.920> go<00:01:23.160> straight<00:01:23.460> to<00:01:23.640> black<00:01:23.880> on

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
ahead and just go straight to black on

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.470 
ahead and just go straight to black on
this<00:01:24.360> one<00:01:24.570> so<00:01:24.750> you<00:01:24.840> can<00:01:25.050> see<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:26.150> darkness<00:01:27.150> of

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:27.480 
this one so you can see the darkness of

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:35.240 
this one so you can see the darkness of
it<00:01:27.630> quickly<00:01:31.220> there's<00:01:32.220> a<00:01:32.310> little<00:01:33.200> curl<00:01:34.250> opening

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
it quickly there's a little curl opening

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.370 
it quickly there's a little curl opening
that<00:01:35.430> goes<00:01:35.610> right<00:01:35.880> back<00:01:36.180> up<00:01:36.420> into<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.840> nostril

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
that goes right back up into the nostril

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.890 
that goes right back up into the nostril
so<00:01:37.500> you<00:01:37.560> want<00:01:37.770> to<00:01:37.860> capture<00:01:38.100> that<00:01:38.490> and<00:01:38.870> then<00:01:39.870> I

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
into the where the fur would begin on

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.080 
into the where the fur would begin on
