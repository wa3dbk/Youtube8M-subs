the data to actually used again and I
believe<00:00:56.190> I<00:00:56.550> formatted<00:00:57.210> it<00:00:58.850> so<00:01:00.320> we<00:01:01.320> are<00:01:01.649> going

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
believe I formatted it so we are going

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:13.010 
believe I formatted it so we are going
to<00:01:03.260> try<00:01:04.260> to<00:01:04.290> recover<00:01:07.070> the<00:01:08.070> data<00:01:08.340> on<00:01:08.700> that<00:01:08.850> drive

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
let me try it a format recovery now I

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.289 
let me try it a format recovery now I
have<00:01:18.899> recovered<00:01:19.439> data<00:01:19.619> before<00:01:19.909> it's<00:01:20.909> not<00:01:21.090> that

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
have recovered data before it's not that

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:26.300 
have recovered data before it's not that
big<00:01:21.479> of<00:01:21.570> a<00:01:21.659> deal<00:01:23.149> but<00:01:24.590> this<00:01:25.590> would<00:01:25.799> save<00:01:26.039> me<00:01:26.280> a

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
was some totally different types of data

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.910 
was some totally different types of data
documents<00:02:07.860> so<00:02:09.200> let's<00:02:10.200> see<00:02:10.380> what<00:02:10.530> we<00:02:10.619> could<00:02:10.769> do

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
documents so let's see what we could do

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.300 
documents so let's see what we could do
here<00:02:10.950> we're<00:02:11.610> clicking<00:02:11.819> next

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
here we're clicking next

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.990 
here we're clicking next
okay<00:02:14.310> so<00:02:15.049> this<00:02:16.049> screen<00:02:16.319> just<00:02:16.590> popped<00:02:16.860> up<00:02:17.100> tells

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
okay so this screen just popped up tells

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.490 
okay so this screen just popped up tells
me<00:02:18.239> there's<00:02:18.420> about<00:02:18.600> a<00:02:18.660> minute<00:02:19.079> what<00:02:19.519> if<00:02:21.500> 336

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
me there's about a minute what if 336

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.550 
me there's about a minute what if 336
directories<00:02:23.100> and<00:02:23.959> 5,000<00:02:24.959> just<00:02:25.140> sort<00:02:25.290> of<00:02:25.350> 10

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
directories and 5,000 just sort of 10

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.830 
directories and 5,000 just sort of 10
files<00:02:25.859> and<00:02:27.680> hoping<00:02:28.680> that<00:02:29.010> it<00:02:29.910> has<00:02:30.060> fun<00:02:30.359> the

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
files and hoping that it has fun the

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.569 
files and hoping that it has fun the
files<00:02:31.910> that<00:02:32.910> I<00:02:33.750> actually<00:02:33.930> need<00:02:34.500> because<00:02:35.370> I

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:35.579 
files that I actually need because I

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:37.520 
files that I actually need because I
might<00:02:35.790> have<00:02:35.820> formatted<00:02:36.420> this<00:02:36.720> drive<00:02:37.019> a<00:02:37.049> few

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
might have formatted this drive a few

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:43.670 
might have formatted this drive a few
times<00:02:37.829> so<00:02:39.530> we<00:02:40.530> shall<00:02:40.769> see<00:02:41.040> but<00:02:41.600> um<00:02:42.600> it<00:02:43.319> seems<00:02:43.590> to

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
times so we shall see but um it seems to

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.259 
times so we shall see but um it seems to
be<00:02:43.799> wrapping<00:02:44.220> up<00:02:44.310> pretty<00:02:44.579> quickly<00:02:44.970> and<00:02:46.910> what<00:02:47.910> I

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
be wrapping up pretty quickly and what I

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:51.750 
be wrapping up pretty quickly and what I
want<00:02:49.230> to<00:02:49.350> do<00:02:49.530> is<00:02:49.709> basically

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
want to do is basically

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.920 
want to do is basically
highlight<00:02:52.480> all<00:02:52.720> the<00:02:52.900> files<00:02:53.310> and<00:02:54.450> just<00:02:55.450> drop

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
highlight all the files and just drop

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:57.809 
highlight all the files and just drop
them<00:02:56.110> into<00:02:56.290> the<00:02:56.409> directory<00:02:57.040> or<00:02:57.189> once<00:02:57.430> this<00:02:57.640> is

00:02:57.809 --> 00:02:57.819 
them into the directory or once this is

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:00.780 
them into the directory or once this is
through<00:02:58.620> and<00:02:59.620> then<00:02:59.829> just<00:02:59.860> sort<00:03:00.220> them<00:03:00.549> real

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
through and then just sort them real

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:09.930 
through and then just sort them real
quick<00:03:04.920> okay<00:03:06.840> so<00:03:08.280> since<00:03:09.280> I<00:03:09.430> recovered

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
quick okay so since I recovered

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:17.190 
quick okay so since I recovered
everything<00:03:10.440> about<00:03:11.440> five<00:03:11.739> minutes<00:03:14.010> no<00:03:15.659> okay<00:03:16.659> so

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
everything about five minutes no okay so

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:25.740 
everything about five minutes no okay so
let's<00:03:18.190> check<00:03:18.310> out<00:03:18.640> what<00:03:18.819> it<00:03:18.940> has<00:03:22.109> okay<00:03:24.450> so<00:03:25.450> if<00:03:25.599> I

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
let's check out what it has okay so if I

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:32.059 
let's check out what it has okay so if I
go<00:03:25.959> here<00:03:25.989> I<00:03:26.739> just<00:03:26.950> type<00:03:27.340> in<00:03:28.109> Star<00:03:29.109> Ferry<00:03:29.440> PDF
