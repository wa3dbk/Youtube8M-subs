first step into the macbook pro line
because<00:00:18.990> I've<00:00:19.590> always<00:00:19.800> been<00:00:20.100> little<00:00:20.279> hesitant

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
when it comes to macbooks I guess

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.140

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.700 
but it's real simple I kind of like the
keys<00:01:30.030> in<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.390> trackpad<00:01:30.900> and<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.380> screen<00:01:31.680> is

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
keys in the trackpad and the screen is

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.770 
keys in the trackpad and the screen is
one<00:01:32.189> of<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.400> main<00:01:32.640> attractions<00:01:33.420> for<00:01:33.509> me

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
one of the main attractions for me

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.890 
one of the main attractions for me
because<00:01:34.140> if<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:34.860> resolution<00:01:35.460> is<00:01:35.490> at<00:01:35.720> 2560<00:01:36.720> by

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
because if the resolution is at 2560 by

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.260 
because if the resolution is at 2560 by
1600<00:01:37.470> and<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.130> screen<00:01:38.340> resolution<00:01:38.909> is<00:01:39.000> really

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
1600 and the screen resolution is really

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.539 
1600 and the screen resolution is really
great<00:01:39.479> when<00:01:39.659> it<00:01:39.750> comes<00:01:39.960> to<00:01:40.140> watching<00:01:40.549> YouTube

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
great when it comes to watching YouTube

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.460 
great when it comes to watching YouTube
videos<00:01:41.579> some<00:01:42.240> netflix<00:01:42.810> anything<00:01:43.290> like<00:01:43.439> that

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
and just when I really enjoy using this

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.010 
and just when I really enjoy using this
computers<00:01:46.799> when<00:01:46.950> I'm<00:01:47.100> out<00:01:47.869> traveling<00:01:48.869> and

computers when I'm out traveling and

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.539 
computers when I'm out traveling and
things<00:01:49.200> like<00:01:49.350> that<00:01:49.409> and<00:01:49.590> just<00:01:49.950> can<00:01:50.220> pull<00:01:50.430> it

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
things like that and just can pull it

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.340 
things like that and just can pull it
out<00:01:50.700> pop<00:01:51.060> it<00:01:51.240> up<00:01:51.329> real<00:01:51.600> quick<00:01:51.869> and<00:01:52.020> it<00:01:52.140> just

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
out pop it up real quick and it just

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.100 
out pop it up real quick and it just
starts<00:01:52.680> right<00:01:52.890> old<00:01:53.100> enough<00:01:53.310> and<00:01:53.549> Mac<00:01:54.240> OS<00:01:54.270> the

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
starts right old enough and Mac OS the

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.260 
starts right old enough and Mac OS the
OS<00:01:55.439> itself<00:01:55.890> is<00:01:56.040> really<00:01:56.219> interesting<00:01:56.939> as<00:01:57.030> far

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
OS itself is really interesting as far

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.630 
OS itself is really interesting as far
as<00:01:57.420> using<00:01:57.689> it<00:01:58.409> with<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:58.920> multiple<00:01:59.219> desktops

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
as using it with the multiple desktops

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.880 
as using it with the multiple desktops
you<00:02:00.299> can<00:02:00.479> really<00:02:00.719> do<00:02:00.960> a<00:02:00.990> lot<00:02:01.110> of<00:02:01.350> multitasking

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
you can really do a lot of multitasking

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.760 
you can really do a lot of multitasking
with<00:02:02.610> this<00:02:02.759> OS<00:02:03.180> and<00:02:03.360> I<00:02:03.450> really<00:02:03.750> enjoy<00:02:04.110> and<00:02:04.469> you

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
days but one of the main things I notice

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:11.080 
days but one of the main things I notice
when

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
when

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.140 
when
come<00:02:11.390> to<00:02:11.660> using<00:02:12.470> the<00:02:12.560> OS<00:02:12.890> it<00:02:13.190> is<00:02:13.340> a<00:02:13.370> bit<00:02:13.819> of<00:02:14.030> a

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
come to using the OS it is a bit of a

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:15.550 
come to using the OS it is a bit of a
learning<00:02:14.330> curve<00:02:14.540> because<00:02:14.930> of<00:02:15.050> the<00:02:15.140> jesters

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
learning curve because of the jesters

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.979 
learning curve because of the jesters
you<00:02:15.709> can<00:02:15.860> do<00:02:16.099> with<00:02:16.459> the<00:02:16.970> OS<00:02:17.360> and<00:02:17.390> things<00:02:17.840> like

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:17.989 
you can do with the OS and things like

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:20.320 
you can do with the OS and things like
the<00:02:18.140> macro<00:02:18.590> where<00:02:18.800> system<00:02:19.280> works<00:02:19.519> for<00:02:19.640> this<00:02:19.849> 13

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
the macro where system works for this 13

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:21.640 
the macro where system works for this 13
there's<00:02:20.569> display<00:02:20.959> but<00:02:21.140> I<00:02:21.230> just<00:02:21.410> feel<00:02:21.620> like

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
there's display but I just feel like

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.500 
there's display but I just feel like
it's<00:02:22.010> meant<00:02:22.220> to<00:02:22.370> be<00:02:22.400> displayed<00:02:22.790> or<00:02:23.239> one<00:02:23.480> of

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
it's meant to be displayed or one of

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.630 
it's meant to be displayed or one of
those<00:02:23.690> Thunderbolt<00:02:24.319> displays<00:02:24.709> there<00:02:24.950> was<00:02:25.040> 27

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
those Thunderbolt displays there was 27

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.220 
those Thunderbolt displays there was 27
inch<00:02:25.819> displays<00:02:26.300> and<00:02:26.510> things<00:02:26.690> like<00:02:26.810> but<00:02:26.989> it

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
inch displays and things like but it

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.440 
inch displays and things like but it
just<00:02:27.530> seems<00:02:27.769> like<00:02:27.890> this<00:02:28.340> OS<00:02:28.849> is<00:02:29.060> meant<00:02:29.299> to<00:02:29.420> be

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
just seems like this OS is meant to be

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.300 
just seems like this OS is meant to be
displayed<00:02:29.870> on<00:02:30.110> a<00:02:30.140> real<00:02:30.410> giant<00:02:30.739> screen<00:02:31.069> they

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
charge that's where fifty percent

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.339 
charge that's where fifty percent
brightness<00:02:35.150> for<00:02:35.299> me<00:02:35.450> i<00:02:35.480> don't<00:02:35.780> keep<00:02:36.140> it<00:02:36.260> on

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
charge and a better because some of the

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.780 
charge and a better because some of the
pcs<00:02:56.540> that<00:02:56.569> iphone<00:02:57.019> i<00:02:57.319> roughly<00:02:58.040> got<00:02:58.250> maybe<00:02:58.489> two

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
pcs that iphone i roughly got maybe two

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:00.670 
pcs that iphone i roughly got maybe two
and<00:02:58.910> a<00:02:59.000> half<00:02:59.239> hours<00:02:59.660> three<00:03:00.049> hours<00:03:00.079> on<00:03:00.530> a<00:03:00.560> charge

can get out there but the process alone

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.370 
can get out there but the process alone
is<00:04:04.400> like<00:04:04.489> a<00:04:04.519> 1.1<00:04:05.239> gigahertz<00:04:05.630> and<00:04:05.989> i<00:04:06.079> definitely
