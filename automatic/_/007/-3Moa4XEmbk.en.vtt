00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
had faith in them all years so I very

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:13.350 
had faith in them all years so I very
well<00:02:12.010> could<00:02:12.310> be<00:02:12.340> wrong<00:02:12.730> you<00:02:13.000> know<00:02:13.090> what<00:02:13.239> the

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
well could be wrong you know what the

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.930 
well could be wrong you know what the
guys<00:02:13.540> wait<00:02:13.900> unreal<00:02:14.380> but<00:02:15.040> I<00:02:15.100> don't<00:02:15.520> think<00:02:15.760> they

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
guys wait unreal but I don't think they

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.340 
guys wait unreal but I don't think they
can<00:02:16.000> keep<00:02:16.239> it<00:02:16.390> going<00:02:16.630> especially<00:02:16.870> if<00:02:17.200> Matt

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
can keep it going especially if Matt

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:19.320 
can keep it going especially if Matt
deschaines<00:02:17.680> out<00:02:17.890> back<00:02:18.100> that's<00:02:18.760> my<00:02:19.030> opinion
