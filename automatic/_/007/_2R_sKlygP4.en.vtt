understand myself either reaches like a
super<00:00:16.680> bad<00:00:16.800> science<00:00:17.279> are<00:00:17.400> gonna<00:00:17.520> try<00:00:17.730> to<00:00:17.789> do

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
super bad science are gonna try to do

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.189 
super bad science are gonna try to do
this<00:00:18.060> one<00:00:18.210> more<00:00:18.300> time<00:00:18.510> hopefully<00:00:18.810> it<00:00:19.050> works

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
this one more time hopefully it works

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.279 
this one more time hopefully it works
this<00:00:19.470> time<00:00:19.529> and<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.730> basic<00:00:21.109> idea<00:00:22.109> of<00:00:22.170> this

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
this time and the basic idea of this

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.140 
this time and the basic idea of this
video<00:00:22.560> is<00:00:22.740> to<00:00:22.769> talk<00:00:23.010> about<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.490> dnd<00:00:23.850> tracker

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
video is to talk about the dnd tracker

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.730 
video is to talk about the dnd tracker
which<00:00:24.390> was<00:00:24.570> added<00:00:24.720> to<00:00:24.960> the<00:00:25.109> game<00:00:25.289> earlier

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
which was added to the game earlier

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.470 
which was added to the game earlier
today<00:00:25.920> and<00:00:26.279> where<00:00:26.789> you<00:00:26.849> can<00:00:26.970> find<00:00:27.150> that<00:00:27.269> is

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
today and where you can find that is

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.970 
today and where you can find that is
based<00:00:27.689> upon<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:27.960> kind<00:00:28.260> of<00:00:28.349> quest<00:00:28.560> mark<00:00:28.769> over

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
based upon the kind of quest mark over

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.710 
based upon the kind of quest mark over
here<00:00:29.189> we<00:00:29.279> click<00:00:29.460> on<00:00:29.580> it<00:00:29.670> and<00:00:29.849> it<00:00:30.269> got<00:00:30.420> up<00:00:30.599> this

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
here we click on it and it got up this

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.150 
here we click on it and it got up this
kind<00:00:30.960> of<00:00:31.050> new<00:00:31.140> page<00:00:31.410> well<00:00:31.650> I<00:00:31.830> wasn't

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
kind of new page well I wasn't

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.920 
kind of new page well I wasn't
challenging<00:00:32.610> smoke<00:00:32.820> but<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.149> basic<00:00:33.750> risk

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
challenging smoke but the basic risk

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.959 
challenging smoke but the basic risk
recommending<00:00:34.410> games<00:00:34.590> and<00:00:34.860> get<00:00:35.610> this<00:00:35.760> page

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
the game at the moment that it can do or

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.400 
the game at the moment that it can do or
not<00:00:41.610> do<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:42.300> time<00:00:42.570> of<00:00:42.750> it<00:00:42.870> as<00:00:43.020> you<00:00:43.110> can<00:00:43.230> see<00:00:43.379> our

not do the time of it as you can see our
example<00:00:43.920> with<00:00:44.010> troll<00:00:44.190> invasion<00:00:44.340> you<00:00:45.120> can<00:00:45.300> see

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
example with troll invasion you can see

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:46.970 
example with troll invasion you can see
it's<00:00:45.510> like<00:00:45.600> 24<00:00:46.050> days<00:00:46.200> before<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.620> reed<00:00:46.770> says

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
it's like 24 days before the reed says

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.979 
it's like 24 days before the reed says
you<00:00:47.100> can<00:00:47.280> do<00:00:47.370> it<00:00:47.489> again<00:00:47.610> even<00:00:48.510> though<00:00:48.660> like<00:00:48.870> you

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
you can do it again even though like you

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.270 
you can do it again even though like you
have<00:00:49.110> claimed<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.410> reward<00:00:49.500> because<00:00:49.890> like

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
have claimed the reward because like

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.010 
have claimed the reward because like
I've<00:00:50.460> claim<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:50.879> reward<00:00:50.969> already<00:00:51.360> now<00:00:51.960> you

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
I've claim the reward already now you

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.720 
I've claim the reward already now you
can<00:00:52.350> say<00:00:52.500> that<00:00:52.739> it's<00:00:52.949> a<00:00:53.190> but<00:00:53.340> it's<00:00:53.489> still<00:00:53.670> a

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
can say that it's a but it's still a

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.250 
can say that it's a but it's still a
checkpoint<00:00:54.090> a<00:00:54.210> minute<00:00:54.449> because<00:00:54.570> you<00:00:54.780> can<00:00:54.989> do

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
checkpoint a minute because you can do

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.430 
checkpoint a minute because you can do
it<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.860> things<00:00:56.100> like<00:00:56.960> bitchy<00:00:57.960> sharper<00:00:58.350> for

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
it the things like bitchy sharper for

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.709 
it the things like bitchy sharper for
example<00:00:58.800> if<00:00:58.859> you<00:00:58.920> do<00:00:59.070> it<00:00:59.190> two<00:00:59.309> times<00:00:59.340> I<00:00:59.910> don't

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
example if you do it two times I don't

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.240 
example if you do it two times I don't
really<00:01:00.870> think<00:01:00.960> they<00:01:01.199> can<00:01:01.230> do<00:01:01.469> it<00:01:01.500> again<00:01:01.739> so

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
really think they can do it again so

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.189 
really think they can do it again so
therefore<00:01:02.640> like<00:01:02.850> it's<00:01:03.090> like<00:01:03.329> just<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.019> time

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
therefore like it's like just the time

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.450 
therefore like it's like just the time
kind<00:01:04.439> of<00:01:04.470> thing<00:01:04.619> it's<00:01:04.769> normal<00:01:05.040> to<00:01:05.070> this<00:01:05.250> i'm

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
kind of thing it's normal to this i'm

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.070 
kind of thing it's normal to this i'm
not<00:01:05.580> sure<00:01:05.700> if<00:01:05.760> you'll<00:01:05.850> be<00:01:05.970> xed<00:01:06.240> out<00:01:06.420> if<00:01:06.689> you<00:01:06.840> can

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
not sure if you'll be xed out if you can

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.560 
not sure if you'll be xed out if you can
lo<00:01:07.320> i<00:01:07.560> have<00:01:08.400> done<00:01:08.610> it<00:01:08.729> two<00:01:08.850> times<00:01:09.000> a<00:01:09.210> day<00:01:09.360> Mila

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
lo i have done it two times a day Mila

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:10.550 
lo i have done it two times a day Mila
check<00:01:09.720> that<00:01:09.900> out<00:01:09.960> that's<00:01:10.140> probably<00:01:10.439> something

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
check that out that's probably something

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.890 
check that out that's probably something
I<00:01:10.770> should<00:01:10.799> check<00:01:11.159> but<00:01:11.340> like<00:01:11.540> it's<00:01:12.540> basically

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
I should check but like it's basically

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.660 
I should check but like it's basically
showing<00:01:13.170> you<00:01:13.380> how<00:01:13.740> much<00:01:13.799> time<00:01:14.189> is<00:01:14.340> left<00:01:14.369> before

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
showing you how much time is left before

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.300 
showing you how much time is left before
it<00:01:14.909> starts<00:01:15.360> at<00:01:15.840> like<00:01:16.110> every<00:01:16.470> hour<00:01:16.830> I<00:01:17.100> guess

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
it starts at like every hour I guess

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.410 
it starts at like every hour I guess
it's<00:01:17.490> something<00:01:17.610> we'll<00:01:17.820> have<00:01:17.850> wilderness<00:01:18.240> war

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
it's something we'll have wilderness war

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.210 
it's something we'll have wilderness war
base<00:01:18.600> and<00:01:18.750> everything<00:01:19.110> and<00:01:19.380> this<00:01:19.680> one<00:01:19.890> is<00:01:20.009> kind

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
base and everything and this one is kind

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.710 
base and everything and this one is kind
of<00:01:20.280> where<00:01:20.430> this<00:01:20.580> world<00:01:20.820> because<00:01:21.030> at<00:01:21.630> the

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
of where this world because at the

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.030 
of where this world because at the
moment<00:01:21.750> here<00:01:22.080> it<00:01:22.200> says<00:01:22.320> I've<00:01:22.500> done<00:01:22.710> two<00:01:22.890> or

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
moment here it says I've done two or

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.770 
moment here it says I've done two or
three<00:01:23.250> events<00:01:23.490> a<00:01:23.640> day<00:01:23.670> but<00:01:24.270> I<00:01:24.330> haven't<00:01:24.689> done

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
three events a day but I haven't done

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.899 
three events a day but I haven't done
war<00:01:25.020> bands<00:01:25.200> like<00:01:25.380> a<00:01:25.439> few<00:01:25.890> months<00:01:26.460> now<00:01:26.610> believe

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
war bands like a few months now believe

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.969 
war bands like a few months now believe
like<00:01:27.060> I<00:01:27.090> think<00:01:27.600> it<00:01:27.689> did<00:01:27.780> one<00:01:27.990> like<00:01:28.590> a<00:01:28.619> month<00:01:28.860> ago

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
like I think it did one like a month ago

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.830 
like I think it did one like a month ago
or<00:01:29.130> so<00:01:29.400> and<00:01:29.579> it<00:01:29.909> says<00:01:30.060> I've<00:01:30.210> done<00:01:30.360> two<00:01:30.540> or<00:01:30.659> three

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
or so and it says I've done two or three

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.660 
or so and it says I've done two or three
events<00:01:31.079> a<00:01:31.170> day<00:01:31.200> which<00:01:31.470> i<00:01:31.590> think<00:01:31.860> is<00:01:32.100> based<00:01:32.430> on

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
events a day which i think is based on

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.850 
events a day which i think is based on
the<00:01:32.820> cycle<00:01:33.360> on<00:01:33.780> how<00:01:33.990> this<00:01:34.229> works<00:01:34.470> like<00:01:34.680> I<00:01:34.799> don't

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
the cycle on how this works like I don't

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.219 
the cycle on how this works like I don't
think<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.340> next<00:01:35.579> one<00:01:35.759> would<00:01:35.880> be<00:01:35.939> before<00:01:36.750> the

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
think the next one would be before the

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.520 
think the next one would be before the
day<00:01:37.979> is<00:01:38.220> over<00:01:38.460> basically<00:01:39.090> so<00:01:39.479> I<00:01:39.750> think<00:01:40.259> this

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
day is over basically so I think this

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.350 
day is over basically so I think this
one<00:01:40.740> basically<00:01:41.040> says<00:01:41.310> that<00:01:41.340> s<00:01:41.640> been<00:01:41.909> two<00:01:42.119> of

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
one basically says that s been two of

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.690 
one basically says that s been two of
three<00:01:43.020> warbands<00:01:43.560> today<00:01:43.950> basically<00:01:44.369> and

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
three warbands today basically and

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.490 
three warbands today basically and
that's<00:01:44.939> kind<00:01:45.149> of<00:01:45.180> how<00:01:45.329> that<00:01:45.540> one<00:01:45.689> works<00:01:45.840> on<00:01:46.290> the

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
that's kind of how that one works on the

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.840 
that's kind of how that one works on the
bottom<00:01:46.770> here<00:01:46.890> we<00:01:46.979> can<00:01:47.130> see<00:01:47.250> a<00:01:47.280> locket<00:01:47.610> on<00:01:47.700> with

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
bottom here we can see a locket on with

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.100 
bottom here we can see a locket on with
this<00:01:47.939> x-art<00:01:48.420> kind<00:01:48.659> of<00:01:48.720> one<00:01:48.840> so<00:01:48.990> that's

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
this x-art kind of one so that's

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.450 
this x-art kind of one so that's
basically<00:01:49.320> means<00:01:49.799> that<00:01:49.890> i<00:01:49.979> don't<00:01:50.250> have<00:01:50.310> the

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
basically means that i don't have the

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.010 
basically means that i don't have the
requirements<00:01:51.000> for<00:01:51.030> it<00:01:51.240> like<00:01:51.329> i<00:01:51.479> can't<00:01:51.720> access

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
requirements for it like i can't access

too bad we're kind of good if it did in

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:42.960 
too bad we're kind of good if it did in
my<00:03:41.079> own<00:03:41.290> opinion<00:03:41.530> and<00:03:41.829> this<00:03:42.280> one<00:03:42.519> is<00:03:42.639> well<00:03:42.849> with

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
my own opinion and this one is well with

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:44.699 
my own opinion and this one is well with
all<00:03:43.090> the<00:03:43.209> speed<00:03:43.329> check<00:03:43.780> on<00:03:43.989> even<00:03:44.290> though<00:03:44.560> if

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:44.709 
all the speed check on even though if

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:46.289 
all the speed check on even though if
there's<00:03:44.859> nothing<00:03:45.040> you<00:03:45.340> basically<00:03:45.910> can<00:03:46.150> do

there's nothing you basically can do
there<00:03:46.480> and<00:03:46.599> think<00:03:46.810> like<00:03:47.290> if<00:03:47.410> you'll<00:03:47.530> both<00:03:47.799> of

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
there and think like if you'll both of

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:49.920 
there and think like if you'll both of
your<00:03:48.099> ship<00:03:48.280> sent<00:03:48.519> away<00:03:48.790> nothing<00:03:49.630> meaning

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
your ship sent away nothing meaning

whatever<00:03:51.579> I'd<00:03:51.760> stick<00:03:52.359> it<00:03:52.510> still<00:03:52.720> gonna<00:03:52.900> be

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:53.019 
whatever I'd stick it still gonna be

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:54.720 
whatever I'd stick it still gonna be

not<00:04:17.709> really<00:04:17.859> based<00:04:18.130> on<00:04:18.370> me<00:04:18.549> a<00:04:18.579> combatant

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:19.120

search<00:04:19.359> is<00:04:19.510> kind<00:04:19.690> of<00:04:19.780> like<00:04:19.840> just<00:04:20.079> a<00:04:20.500> small

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739 
search is kind of like just a small

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:22.080 
search is kind of like just a small
common<00:04:21.070> factor<00:04:21.340> in<00:04:21.459> it<00:04:21.609> which<00:04:21.760> is<00:04:21.849> kind<00:04:21.969> of

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 
common factor in it which is kind of

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:24.029 
common factor in it which is kind of
weird<00:04:22.210> but<00:04:22.419> I<00:04:22.450> guess<00:04:22.690> it<00:04:23.349> gives<00:04:23.530> people<00:04:23.830> a

00:04:24.029 --> 00:04:24.039 
weird but I guess it gives people a

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:26.100 
weird but I guess it gives people a
chance<00:04:24.550> to<00:04:24.849> know<00:04:25.030> that<00:04:25.270> hey<00:04:25.450> you<00:04:25.719> can<00:04:25.870> actually

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110
