00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:10.469
 lego products are marketed worldwide 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.450
 but in every country others apply 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.119
 safety regulations for toys 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.920
 how does the company make lego? 

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:19.080
 sure the products are all 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.119
 international claims and the 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.939
 own quality ideas are sufficient 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.220
 we have to find out with you 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.679
 the lego scene quality manager michael 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:32.089
 met Larsen and gave us the in-house 

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:32.089
 quality assurance looked at 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.020
 we have in all the world's existing ones 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.210
 laws looked into it we have 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.620
 then derived our own code 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.809
 that with us, however, product 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.829
 safety manual means at the 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.520
 preparation we have the 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.350
 diverse 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.940
 security guidelines looked at and 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.980
 for each of these tests worldwide 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.840
 Hardest existing rule picked out 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.820
 In our product safety is one 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.920
 more profound with our provisions 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.320
 The toughest rules for the world 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.579
 The safety of toys is so 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.899
 Let's make sure that the products 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:08.000
 one in the world 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.000
 to have consistent very high quality 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.880
 especially when we produce duplo products 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.620
 It is important to define how to speak 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.280
 what we mean by a small part 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:19.900
 understand 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.300
 a small part is a piece of the 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:24.610
 product it in this cylinder guest 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.530
 If we give this designer a cylinder 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.090
 give and he for example a part for 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.100
 which is supposed to design such a railway 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.979
 it must be so big that it is not 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.930
 completely in the cylinder connects everyone 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:36.820
 Of course, designer thinks when I am 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:38.770
 to do a part that does not quite the 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.360
 I can make signs of disappearing 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:43.150
 it just as small as possible 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.500
 So he will design it that way 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.560
 maybe just half more 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.729
 millimeter protrudes from the cylinder 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.070
 That's why all designers have one 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:53.259
 bigger cylinder 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.970
 I have the right here with me so 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:56.979
 let's be sure that all of them 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:00.210
 Designers designed parts over the 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:00.210
 legal requirements 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.620
 this is our device for the case 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:13.630
 test as the default for the products 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.370
 that we every toy from one and a half 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:25.480
 meters have to be dropped 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:27.400
 from here our responsibility leads is 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.090
 it is the weakest part of the toy 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.190
 to find 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.540
 if i put the car on the example 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.910
 would like to celebrate trailer hitch 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:37.320
 then I have to put it on top of the device 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.320
 to hold the right position 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.060
 so we do not always have to look at ourselves 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.150
 we have a small elevator of that 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.860
 game shows again conveyed upwardly 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:56.240
 here you can see it now 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.240
 has fallen behind 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.560
 As you can see , this one is just deformed 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:06.360
 and that is not dangerous for one 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:08.370
 child every time we test this 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.410
 we have to make sure that 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.180
 small parts break off the swallowed 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:14.190
 can be or sharp edges 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.340
 arise and he hurt a child 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.340
 can 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:26.700
 one of the most important elements in all 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.470
 Douglas is the character I guess 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.510
 that in 90 percent of all lego duplo 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.820
 packs a game figure is included 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:35.100
 be it an adult figure or 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:36.660
 a child figure if so 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:39.570
 There are difficulties with the figures 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:41.310
 this affects the sale of it 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:44.840
 So it is very important for us that the 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.840
 figures are more than perfect 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:57.540
 We know that children like the characters 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:04:00.230
 to take in the mouth and love it 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:02.940
 take everywhere 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:04.950
 So if it solves an element of it 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.430
 is that something we a killer 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.200
 call 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:08.970
 That's why we need to be 100 percent sure 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:11.370
 that this never happens 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:14.459
 I'll show you our special one now 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:16.440
 train test on this figure given that 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:18.150
 the head of every luther figure of a force 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.010
 of at least 100 minutes 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:22.560
 needs are ten kilogram sugar 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:25.440
 Nebenpunkt the figure I'll show you 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:27.830
 how it goes with let's say 500 newton 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:34.440
 so that the head going in any case and 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:36.090
 He is in every single figure 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:38.600
 such a test with a power of 100 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:40.800
 minutes 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:43.550
 of course, luckily does not lose 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.550
 every figure's head 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:48.760
 but fact is that every figure is the test 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.260
 with or in youth 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:05:04.990
 must and then she comes in the 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:05:06.940
 trade my friend is we have one 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:09.220
 weight of one kilo from one 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:13.860
 standardized height of 10 cm on the 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:13.860
 toy field and it is even 12 cm 

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:20.280
 I can not hold it 

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:26.370
 a kilogram is free on the 

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:28.470
 downstairs 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:31.970
 then we look if something is broken 

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:31.970
 or small parts have jumped off 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:44.970
 Components like this one you can 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:47.310
 see that pretended by beat 

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:48.479
 are actually at 150 minutes so 

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:50.460
 50 kilograms 

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:52.889
 I press now but with the double 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:55.349
 power so 300 minutes and you can 

00:05:52.889 --> 00:06:03.659
 see how it turns after the pressure test 

00:05:55.349 --> 00:06:05.550
 Let's go back to tearing one 

00:06:03.659 --> 00:06:07.379
 sharp corner or he knew the light of 

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:09.750
 if you want to be here in this little one 

00:06:07.379 --> 00:06:11.789
 apparatus pushes this part goes 

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:14.159
 For example, not into it is without 

00:06:11.789 --> 00:06:15.479
 lace knew if I now but to 

00:06:14.159 --> 00:06:19.710
 for example, push in this pen 

00:06:15.479 --> 00:06:21.810
 the light shines on this device 

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:22.949
 So decides if the edge too 

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:25.110
 pointed or not 

00:06:22.949 --> 00:06:27.740
 this decision will not be made 

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:27.740
 discussed 

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:35.460
 we have a lot of ourselves 

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:37.500
 a simple test designed around 

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:39.710
 to find out if a ridge is shaaf 

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:43.820
 or not 

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:56.790
 We take a very thin paper 

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:58.620
 it is about 38 microns thick we 

00:06:56.790 --> 00:07:00.389
 also have a rubber chopsticks that 

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:02.580
 a degree of hardness determined by us 

00:07:00.389 --> 00:07:04.560
 owns the paper is now around the 

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:06.539
 town rolled and in this bracket 

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:08.610
 clamped when I with my finger 

00:07:06.539 --> 00:07:11.930
 against the bracket press there is one 

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:11.930
 resistance of 200 grams 

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:18.449
 the weight is calibrated so it is 

00:07:16.919 --> 00:07:20.070
 always the same and we are safe 

00:07:18.449 --> 00:07:25.350
 that the test is always under the same 

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:27.270
 Conditions take place when we join 

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:29.280
 want to check a part if there is one 

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:37.830
 sharp edge, we were so on the 

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:43.860
 Paper along 5 cm in the device 

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:45.930
 on back to the starting point when 

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:48.410
 the paper is cut there is one 

00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:48.410
 sharp edge
