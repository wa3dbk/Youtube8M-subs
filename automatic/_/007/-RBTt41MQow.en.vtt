 I'll tell you everything now 

00:00:07.769 --> 00:00:11.440
 dangerous illusion is a mixture of genres but by 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:12.730
 most of it is drama 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.619
 Andy drama, that is, the movie shot 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:17.680
 independent without financial and technical 

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:19.869
 assistance from a studio or company in 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:22.150
 starring shia labaf movie debut 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:23.680
 Frederick Bond story's work will tell 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:25.630
 how can you fog so that you will be later 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.430
 more interesting to watch a movie picture 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.470
 it starts with the boy shaya 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:31.150
 Labafa dies mother and by virtue of the fact that 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.739
 forehead throws psychotropic 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:35.050
 drugs he has 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:37.660
 hallucination where mother advise him 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:39.190
 fly to bucharest he does so in 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:40.780
 plane lobov get acquainted with one 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.460
 a positive man and upon arrival 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.129
 meet and with his daughter 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:47.260
 evan rachel wood further lbafa waiting for different 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:50.079
 scrape in general interesting Romanian 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.879
 adventures you know the movie did not like and 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:54.069
 first of all for artistry 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:56.109
 directorial work vision me at all 

00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:58.120
 insanely pleased even a little surprised 

00:00:56.109 --> 00:00:59.949
 what is the debut picture so much she 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.889
 it looks finished me crazy 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:04.330
 liked many directorial finds 

00:01:01.889 --> 00:01:06.640
 for example in the moment when the forehead flies in 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.890
 the plane and zalazyat under the blanket drenched 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.350
 the sun or when the labor in the bag flies on 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.420
 the background of the sun flooding the screen you will understand 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.950
 what do i see if the first half 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.020
 the film I even thought it was pure 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:20.050
 art house cinema is so much emphasis 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:22.120
 on the emotions of perception and the director 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:24.220
 honestly say arthouse i love only for 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:26.290
 non-standard directors vision in 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.480
 the rest of the room I somehow do not like for 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.920
 rare exceptions this picture is big 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:31.480
 a mixture of genres here and love of life 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.970
 felt and there is room for 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:35.710
 mediocre humor to with ron weasley and for 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:38.050
 forbidden love here you will not see 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:38.620
 something beyond the new plot is actually 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.210
 is simple 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:41.500
 although the first half of the film even 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.660
 could not imagine what would happen 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.760
 happen next the picture represents 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:48.130
 is something well recycled old 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.110
 montage with beautiful vision 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.820
 the movie is great for example when lobov 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.560
 just came to bucharest in places 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.900
 noticeably what kind of installation support 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.880
 the dynamics of the films he dealt with by the way 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:59.350
 experienced and nodes i'm born owners 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.780
 Oscar for the best montage of the film 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.370
 collision he was also engaged in mounting in 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.740
 films like servants 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:07.659
 and in the pursuit of happiness from acting 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.819
 I was surprised by shia labaf who, since 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:11.830
 constantine and transformers are now grown 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:14.170
 and can play strong dramatic 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:16.719
 the roles of til schweiger mads mikkelsen 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.230
 Evan Rachel Wood did not period cut 

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:20.180
 they excelled in my opinion 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.580
 this film is rather a benefit of a labaffe here 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.200
 he and in joy and fell ride which he 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.549
 really used relevant 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.069
 scenes and sadness 

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:29.900
 general well done also in the picture beautiful 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:32.180
 music for me for example 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.010
 very pleased familiar notes from moby 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.019
 the only thing the movie didn't like 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.879
 so this is a little oiled end to me 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:39.950
 it seemed that the writers could not 

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:41.780
 decide exactly how to finish 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.970
 the film was emotional with well 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.170
 veiled but beautifully beaten 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.299
 simple plot 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.489
 good acting great 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:51.650
 directorial visions are great 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:53.540
 sensual picture of forbidden love like 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.250
 just right for watching with a girl 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.410
 Personally, I will now watch 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.239
 the work of the director Frederick Bond 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:02.840
 I hope he still surprised pleasant 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:04.489
 watching people while the movie starts with 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.200
 the fact that leaving home is not bad 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:07.910
 actor stellan skarsgard to music 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.129
 ramstein and finds doorways beaten 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:12.500
 charlotte gainsbourg love actress larse 

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:15.849
 and decides to help her apply to his home 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.849
 on wondering what's wrong with her
