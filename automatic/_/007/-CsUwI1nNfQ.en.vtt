00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.610
 people believe that this is fatigue 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:14.100

 the value of our local variable 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.430
 today he pointed out that although it would be 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:29.720

 for that to happen but what scrutiny we will do 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.330
 let's do it 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:46.760

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:53.199
 from one to another 

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:56.979
 practically nothing simply that now what we're going to write is a 

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:59.309
 extra option but crazy 

00:02:59.309 --> 00:03:00.979
 the also the global 

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:04.629
 aggravating quiet of the other and we keep it in our local option that would be 

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:05.999
 is 

00:03:05.999 --> 00:03:09.519
 if it is the one that determines without appearing a cube will offer 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:13.849

 there seems to be no agreement 

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:36.750
 what I hope is that this equipment is executed before anything else that flight to 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.750
 the actress like this the sun explains that kind efe 

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:46.039

 let's say with variable load 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:48.779
 at the beginning 

00:03:48.779 --> 00:03:51.739
 it was good because it will bc load bc before the program 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:55.790
 today I made some other equipment that depends on this initial and loads before each 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:56.899
 branch 

00:03:56.899 --> 00:03:59.680

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:07.879
 you know that it is already 

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:10.679

 there were scenes that we face 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.169
 I hope we are center 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:29.840
 from the back 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.020
 because nothing else that we want to get 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:37.199
 today I will leave this double draw file was paid and download from tdt to 

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:38.360
