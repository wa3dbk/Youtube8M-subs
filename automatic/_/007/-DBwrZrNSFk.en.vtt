00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:17.380
 the idea starts earlier than from 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.269
 fabric 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:21.759
 comes from the material from the idea of 

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:25.410
 dress is dressed as a kind of 

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:25.410
 uniform of uniform 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:36.829
 some clothes that weren't just mine 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:39.170
 mali or mixed with other people's clothes 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:41.570
 friends friends to whom precisely who on 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:43.920
 give me their dress that somehow 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.600
 to represent yourself 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:50.219
 which later was 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.989
 destroyed and assembles that is between them 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:59.129
 these clothes have been assembled for 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:01:05.250
 create a rope then a kind of of 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:07.890
 cordon of how the emotional we say between 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:12.380
 which symbolizes a relationship in 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.380
 this sense my idea was to 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.610
 to return from a point of view 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.689
 poetic to what is the essence of a 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.820
 I live above all a topic that comes 

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:26.200
 no one lives in a manner 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:32.240
 constant non-course of life 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:34.430
 inside the store that this 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.940
 cordon is sent down from the 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:41.299
 ceiling almost like a liana 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:46.700
 return maybe a natural element of the 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:50.149
 so my work there is this almost a 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:53.869
 willow let's say by giving yourself a license 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:57.530
 poetic there is this thing that cries from 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:02:00.020
 ceiling and the idea was to bring it back then 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:03.049
 to the nation that was that 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:06.319
 to use this string earlier 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:08.500
 to climb from the street to my ceiling 

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:10.509
 which is on the third floor is not 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:15.880
 in the historic center of vittorio veneto 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:18.550
 so somehow it was the idea of 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.490
 get back to work very much 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:22.420
 it simply is undoubtedly 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:25.240
 undoubtedly another very aspect 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:27.459
 strong the fact that I decided that 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:31.390
 this was not simply an object 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:33.340
 not just something it represents 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:37.959
 something but an object that comes 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:41.850
 used becomes a sculpture linked to 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:41.850
 a person related situation 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:52.030
 delivery and above all in the choice 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:55.380
 in the choice of the material is to greater 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:58.290
 right when I talk about 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:02.980
 dressed as an extension in some way 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:05.940
 of the person not as a way also of 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.940
 recognize 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:19.760
 therefore these machine movements 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:22.290
 these these concentric whirlwinds this 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:26.030
 very very hard on the other hand 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:32.250
 to the material they use so lightly 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:34.920
 precious that sinuous sinuates and therefore 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.780
 somehow I believe the first one 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:41.460
 fascination was really for the 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:43.440
 movement of the fabric that rises as a memory 

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:46.590
 especially this machine 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:49.110
 this, however, is one of the pieces of cloth 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:52.110
 very white and black printed 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:54.780
 light that looked like a cobra when of 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:56.610
 who got up almost mentioned this 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:01.290
 this dance 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:04.140
 I would say that these were for me the 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:07.460
 basic elements of which I started 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:07.460
 to conceive the work
