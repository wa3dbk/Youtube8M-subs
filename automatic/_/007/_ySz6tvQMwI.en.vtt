00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:34.809
 hello everyone I'm killer scorpion and the 

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:36.820
 today I bring you for 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:39.280
 half of this video an achievement for the 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:41.829
 turn reich the name of the achievement is 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:44.829
 They have always been faster and 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:46.900
 get it will give us 25 gamerscore what 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:48.790
 first you have to know is that this 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.710
 only unlocks by playing the 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:53.260
 second mission which is plan 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.780
 winter the difficulty can be from 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:58.210
 easy to legendary so much the 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.159
 skulls as the score are optional 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:03.160
 so if you want to activate them activate 

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:05.289
 the otherwise do not do it xd for 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.240
 all those who have already passed this 

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:09.130
 mission start the from the point of 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.110
 alpha control so they appear 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.300
 immediately on the part where it 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.610
 get the achievement and for those who do not 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.500
 have passed the mission then start the 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:20.940
 from the beginning and move to the 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.940
 part where I am right now 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.700
 ah 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.280
 but we are at six important 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:40.410
 when they are facing against these 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.210
 elites almost always appear three but 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:44.550
 in other occasions only two or 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.260
 four but how to eliminate them for 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:49.790
 proceed to the part where initial 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.790
 unlock the achievement xd 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:02.760
 now that we have neutralized the little 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.220
 hostile force advances a bit to 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:07.170
 find you with this vehicle starting 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.060
 from here you do not have to enter any 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.280
 vehicle since to do it not 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.030
 you will unlock the achievement so how do you 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.950
 to suppose 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.500
 we will have to go on foot all the 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.330
 you must be using the 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.830
 arcade sprint skill that's 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.890
 available so that way 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.990
 advances faster another thing that you 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.450
 I advise is that it simply kills 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:29.550
 enemies that are necessary to kill for 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.560
 so do not waste a lot of time though 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.900
 if you are interested in getting credits 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.520
 then it is advisable to exterminate 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.810
 each and every one of you 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.810
 find the way 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:52.520
 here as you can see the road is divided 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:54.710
 You can complete the mission by watching 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:56.900
 wherever you want but I already got used to 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:59.740
 pass it this way so we 'll go 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.740
 to the left 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.890
 what luck have I found 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:10.230
 elite of explorer rank and how this 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:12.650
 elite is rare to find I will give him cane 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.650
 xd 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:18.920
 this is for being orange x of this for 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.640
 be an elite and this other because you came out 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.920
 in Youtube 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:25.050
 in this second path they turn towards the 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.950
 right or go south as you want 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:27.950
 tell him heh heh 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:32.129
 that is all 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:42.250
 in this part we will find the 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.049
 second enemy base which 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:47.760
 optionally if they want credits 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:47.760
 additional should clear 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:53.990
 continues moving towards the north because 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:56.780
 we are close to achieving the achievement 

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:58.820
 Now if you look to the sky you should 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:01.370
 see a spirit that is attacking something 

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:03.080
 to achieve the achievement we will have to 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:05.660
 discover what that spirit is 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:08.000
 attack the road to get to it is 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:09.620
 just follow this path do not have 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.500
 why to deviate because otherwise 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:15.550
 they would be lost just keep going straight and they will arrive 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.550
 to the objective xd 

00:04:24.009 --> 00:04:27.009
 two 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:32.320
 the last part to achieve the achievement 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.660
 is that once you get to where 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:36.580
 was the spirit now we will have given 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:38.650
 mind that they were attacking some 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:41.530
 soldiers which we must protect 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:45.690
 and if they manage to kill them good at least 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:45.690
 we must clear the area xdddd 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.500
 where I took the m &amp; r if you raise the 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:00.390
 stairs there is a vehicle I inform them 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:02.730
 so that they do not think about getting on the 

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:06.770
 since doing so would cancel the achievement 

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:06.770
 and they would have to do it again xd 

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:37.430
 as soon as they finish clearing the area and 

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:40.169
 if they did not grab any vehicle they will see the 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:42.800
 Xbox notification appear 

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:42.800
 all clear 

00:05:47.449 --> 00:05:52.270
 clear landing zone forward 

00:05:49.789 --> 00:05:52.270
 connected
