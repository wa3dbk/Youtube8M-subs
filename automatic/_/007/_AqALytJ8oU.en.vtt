00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.500
 I want to end this long journey leaving a memory full of 

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:07.290
 hope and love friendship as the protagonist who has us 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.290
 accompanied in this unusual 20 

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:15.740
 it is a story that perhaps many of you will already know but that 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:16.659
 of course 

00:00:16.659 --> 00:00:17.400
 validated 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.570
 do not forget 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:23.699
 the protagonist is a lion cub that at the end of the 60s 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.099
 for purchased by two friends in the department store caress in the shade 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:33.150
 the puppy called Christian had been separated in his parents because of the 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.150
 selling the zoo in which these videos 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:37.910
 john go and bay street 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.210
 that was the name of the girls 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:45.160
 decided to buy the puppy of a few weeks they raised it they took 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.800
 prizes up to 2 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.210
 but this condition 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.150
 it couldn't last long 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:53.820
 for a fortuitous event 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.010
 they showed up at the furniture store where the two boys worked as actors 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.379
 they ask for free as soon as the filming of the famous movie is over 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:06.980
 taken from novel of joy song that tells the events part of it 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:10.670
 a lioness raised by the same writer from her husband 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.110
 sent 26 hello hello song 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.050
 it 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:17.340
 it was integrated into its natural habitat in that 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.200
 in agreement with the two boys the actors decided to contact their own 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.660
 naturalist at lunch to ask for help with the aim of reintegrating 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:27.770
 Christians too 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.870
 the nature reserve 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:30.829
 and so 

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:33.920
 after a few months randall and burka 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.420
 accompanied by them stink in the nicola reserve in the end 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.780
 lion was inserted in an already existing colony 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:47.150
 the attempt succeeded and after 2 years christian siena inserted so well 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.100
 who had become even England 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.280
 after reintegration in nature 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:57.700
 rarely approached the camp and to the men this was a good sign for adam 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.380
 sandler since the original project provided for this very detachment 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.620
 between a man and me 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:07.520
 to this bittersweet news 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.459
 my London friends decided to take a last trip to Kenya 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.380
 to be able to personally observe the full integration of their lion 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.129
 and to give you a last goodbye 

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:22.749
 before the arrival of randall and burke adam's song he told the two boys that the 

00:02:22.749 --> 00:02:27.329
 their journey would have been wasted because Christian did not show up 

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:27.870
 live 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:28.909
 moment 

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:32.479
 but the two boys decided to leave anyway 

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:35.169
 they still went to the bottom 

00:02:35.169 --> 00:02:36.120
 and here 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.120
 what happens 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:04.949
 these images are worth more than any word 

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:10.139
 the only thing I can say is that many times freedom goes to someone 

00:04:10.139 --> 00:04:12.169
 it is the greatest gesture of love
