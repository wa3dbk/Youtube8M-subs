doctor pet so you couldn't eat that like
even<00:03:18.430> though<00:03:18.639> there's<00:03:19.000> probably<00:03:19.269> a<00:03:19.359> bit<00:03:19.509> more

00:03:19.649 --> 00:03:19.659 
even though there's probably a bit more

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:21.749 
even though there's probably a bit more
meat<00:03:19.900> on<00:03:20.049> it<00:03:20.259> then<00:03:20.439> there<00:03:20.620> is<00:03:20.739> a<00:03:20.769> snake<00:03:21.189> I'm

00:03:21.749 --> 00:03:21.759
