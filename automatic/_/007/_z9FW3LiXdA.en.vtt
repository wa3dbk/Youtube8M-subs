00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
I think of me account certainly fits

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.740 
I think of me account certainly fits
that<00:00:49.079> mold<00:00:49.200> and<00:00:50.090> is<00:00:51.090> there<00:00:51.329> a<00:00:51.360> possibility

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
that mold and is there a possibility

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.330 
that mold and is there a possibility
that<00:00:51.899> if<00:00:52.140> I<00:00:52.289> can<00:00:52.350> happen<00:00:52.680> sure<00:00:52.829> there's<00:00:53.190> some

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
that if I can happen sure there's some

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.380 
that if I can happen sure there's some
other<00:00:53.430> flights<00:00:53.699> were<00:00:53.789> looking<00:00:54.000> at<00:00:54.090> as<00:00:54.210> well

other flights were looking at as well

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.049 
other flights were looking at as well

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
but that's certainly a distinct

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.389 
but that's certainly a distinct
possibility<00:00:57.149> and<00:00:57.809> you<00:00:58.710> know<00:00:58.829> I<00:00:58.859> wouldn't<00:00:59.250> rule

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
possibility and you know I wouldn't rule

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.970 
possibility and you know I wouldn't rule
