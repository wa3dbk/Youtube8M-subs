there are any errors in this video
they're<00:00:24.359> completely<00:00:24.840> mine<00:00:25.769> now<00:00:26.640> let's<00:00:26.880> move

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
they're completely mine now let's move

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.950 
they're completely mine now let's move
on<00:00:27.359> to<00:00:27.390> formative<00:00:28.050> and<00:00:28.260> reflective<00:00:28.949> measures

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:29.960 
on to formative and reflective measures

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.659 
on to formative and reflective measures
now<00:00:30.960> we<00:00:31.019> spend<00:00:31.500> a<00:00:31.619> lot<00:00:31.650> of<00:00:31.800> time<00:00:32.160> developing

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
now we spend a lot of time developing

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.200 
now we spend a lot of time developing
our<00:00:33.320> framework<00:00:34.320> our<00:00:34.649> research<00:00:35.460> model<00:00:35.940> and

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
our framework our research model and

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.209 
our framework our research model and
then<00:00:36.840> we<00:00:37.350> spend<00:00:37.890> a<00:00:38.010> lot<00:00:38.190> of<00:00:38.219> time<00:00:38.520> again<00:00:39.000> on<00:00:39.329> the

00:00:40.209 --> 00:00:40.219 
then we spend a lot of time again on the

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:43.010 
then we spend a lot of time again on the
constructs<00:00:41.219> on<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:42.120> relationship<00:00:42.899> between

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
constructs on the relationship between

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.190 
constructs on the relationship between
the<00:00:43.320> constructs<00:00:43.920> but<00:00:44.730> in<00:00:45.090> between<00:00:45.570> what<00:00:45.989> gets

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
the constructs but in between what gets

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.299 
the constructs but in between what gets
ignored<00:00:46.680> sometimes<00:00:47.460> is<00:00:47.989> the<00:00:49.309> daily

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
ignored sometimes is the daily

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.910 
ignored sometimes is the daily
importance<00:00:50.969> of<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.629> measurement<00:00:52.590> of<00:00:52.739> those

importance of the measurement of those

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.779 
importance of the measurement of those
constructs<00:00:53.579> in<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.690> structural<00:00:55.410> equation

00:00:55.779 --> 00:00:55.789 
constructs in the structural equation

00:00:55.789 --> 00:01:00.049 
constructs in the structural equation
modeling<00:00:56.870> the<00:00:57.949> measures<00:00:58.949> make<00:00:59.850> the

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
modeling the measures make the

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.319 
modeling the measures make the
measurement<00:01:00.660> model<00:01:00.719> and<00:01:01.320> it's<00:01:01.800> the

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:02.329 
measurement model and it's the

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:04.700 
measurement model and it's the
constructs<00:01:03.329> that<00:01:03.510> make<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.080> structural

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
constructs that make the structural

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.219 
constructs that make the structural
model<00:01:04.890> now<00:01:05.700> if<00:01:05.909> there<00:01:06.150> is<00:01:06.180> a<00:01:06.390> problem<00:01:06.750> with<00:01:07.140> the

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
model now if there is a problem with the

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.350 
model now if there is a problem with the
measures<00:01:07.909> automatically<00:01:08.909> there<00:01:09.150> will<00:01:09.240> be<00:01:09.270> a

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
measures automatically there will be a

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.710 
measures automatically there will be a
problem<00:01:09.990> with<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.619> structural<00:01:11.250> model<00:01:11.720> also

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
problem with the structural model also

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.820 
problem with the structural model also
so<00:01:13.790> there<00:01:14.790> are<00:01:14.909> actually<00:01:15.090> two<00:01:15.720> models<00:01:16.500> of<00:01:16.710> the

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
so there are actually two models of the

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.130 
so there are actually two models of the
relationship<00:01:17.610> between<00:01:17.939> constructs<00:01:18.810> and

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
relationship between constructs and

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.830 
relationship between constructs and
measures<00:01:19.580> the<00:01:20.580> first<00:01:20.909> one<00:01:21.180> is<00:01:21.360> called<00:01:21.689> the

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
measures the first one is called the

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.140 
measures the first one is called the

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
reflective measurement model and the

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.850 
reflective measurement model and the
second<00:01:24.570> one<00:01:24.750> is<00:01:24.960> called<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.380> formative

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
second one is called the formative

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.440 
second one is called the formative
measurement<00:01:26.790> model<00:01:27.210> now<00:01:27.840> in<00:01:28.380> case<00:01:28.829> of<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.520> in

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:33.829 
case of the reflective measurement model

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:37.609 
case of the reflective measurement model
it's<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:35.509> construct<00:01:36.509> that<00:01:36.990> causes<00:01:37.500> the

change in the measurement items
sometimes<00:01:44.670> also<00:01:44.909> called<00:01:45.110> indicators<00:01:46.110> or

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
sometimes also called indicators or

formative model

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.600 
formative model
it's<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:51.210> measurement<00:01:52.170> items<00:01:52.770> that<00:01:53.340> cause

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
the change in the construct and that's

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.990 
the change in the construct and that's
the<00:01:56.640> reason<00:01:56.939> why<00:01:57.149> here<00:01:57.869> in<00:01:58.049> Figure<00:01:58.560> B<00:01:58.640> we<00:01:59.640> have

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
the reason why here in Figure B we have

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.090 
the reason why here in Figure B we have
the<00:02:00.030> arrows<00:02:00.719> pointing<00:02:01.409> towards<00:02:01.799> the

the arrows pointing towards the

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.459 
the arrows pointing towards the
construct<00:02:02.729> indicating<00:02:03.659> that<00:02:03.689> the<00:02:03.960> change<00:02:04.259> is

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
construct indicating that the change is

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.280 
construct indicating that the change is
coming<00:02:04.950> from<00:02:05.399> the<00:02:05.670> measurement<00:02:06.180> items<00:02:06.630> and<00:02:06.869> it

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
coming from the measurement items and it

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.029 
coming from the measurement items and it
goes<00:02:07.500> towards

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:09.039 
goes towards

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:12.479 
goes towards
the<00:02:10.349> construct<00:02:11.349> main<00:02:11.830> case<00:02:12.099> of<00:02:12.340> the

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:12.489 
the construct main case of the

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:15.690 
the construct main case of the
reflective<00:02:13.209> measurement<00:02:13.989> model<00:02:14.349> the<00:02:15.280> change

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
reflective measurement model the change

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.390 
reflective measurement model the change
comes<00:02:16.090> from<00:02:16.360> the<00:02:16.599> construct<00:02:17.349> and<00:02:17.590> the<00:02:17.980> arrows

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
comes from the construct and the arrows

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.880 
comes from the construct and the arrows
therefore<00:02:19.030> are<00:02:19.269> pointed<00:02:20.049> towards<00:02:20.200> the

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
therefore are pointed towards the

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.670 
therefore are pointed towards the
measurement<00:02:21.400> items<00:02:21.819> now<00:02:22.480> it's<00:02:22.810> important<00:02:23.590> to

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
measurement items now it's important to

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.240 
measurement items now it's important to
remember<00:02:24.209> here<00:02:25.209> that<00:02:25.989> in<00:02:26.709> case<00:02:26.980> of<00:02:27.010> the

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
remember here that in case of the

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.280 
remember here that in case of the
reflective<00:02:27.940> measurement<00:02:28.659> model

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
reflective measurement model

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
reflective measurement model
it's<00:02:29.739> the<00:02:31.079> correlation<00:02:32.079> between<00:02:32.680> the

major conflict between these two

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:53.939 
major conflict between these two
perspectives<00:03:51.669> is<00:03:52.449> the<00:03:52.930> role<00:03:53.139> of<00:03:53.169> the<00:03:53.470> theory

develop series of the relationship

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.640 
develop series of the relationship

between the constructs and use those

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:16.280 
between the constructs and use those
theories<00:04:14.370> to<00:04:14.970> shape<00:04:15.270> how<00:04:15.540> data<00:04:15.840> will<00:04:16.110> be

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:16.290 
theories to shape how data will be

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:20.620 
theories to shape how data will be
collected<00:04:17.030> by<00:04:18.030> in<00:04:18.180> case<00:04:18.480> of<00:04:18.840> the<00:04:19.400> formative

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:23.900 
collected by in case of the formative
perspective<00:04:21.630> we<00:04:22.230> should<00:04:22.470> look<00:04:22.710> for<00:04:23.280> patterns

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
perspective we should look for patterns

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:26.570 
perspective we should look for patterns
in<00:04:24.210> data<00:04:24.450> and<00:04:24.870> let<00:04:25.380> the<00:04:25.410> data<00:04:25.590> provide<00:04:26.370> the

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580 
in data and let the data provide the

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.270 
in data and let the data provide the
basis<00:04:27.090> for<00:04:27.120> the<00:04:27.390> theories<00:04:27.900> so<00:04:28.860> these<00:04:29.100> are

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
basis for the theories so these are

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.930 
basis for the theories so these are
completely<00:04:29.540> two<00:04:30.540> different<00:04:31.940> perspectives

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:32.940 
completely two different perspectives

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:37.430 
completely two different perspectives
now<00:04:34.520> what's<00:04:35.520> also<00:04:35.730> important<00:04:36.600> to<00:04:36.780> understand

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 
now what's also important to understand

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.320 
now what's also important to understand
in<00:04:37.710> this<00:04:37.920> case<00:04:38.250> is<00:04:38.490> that<00:04:38.820> in<00:04:39.060> case<00:04:39.300> of

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:39.330 
in this case is that in case of

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:43.190 
in this case is that in case of
reflective<00:04:40.430> indicators<00:04:41.430> the<00:04:42.300> indicators<00:04:43.020> are

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:43.200 
reflective indicators the indicators are

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:44.990 
reflective indicators the indicators are
essentially<00:04:43.800> interchangeable<00:04:44.790> and

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.000 
essentially interchangeable and

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.900 
essentially interchangeable and
therefore<00:04:45.990> the<00:04:46.260> removal<00:04:46.830> of<00:04:46.920> an<00:04:47.070> item<00:04:47.250> does

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:47.910 
therefore the removal of an item does

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:50.150 
therefore the removal of an item does
not<00:04:48.090> change<00:04:48.390> essentially<00:04:49.290> the<00:04:49.410> nature<00:04:49.770> of<00:04:49.800> the

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.160 
not change essentially the nature of the

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.370 
not change essentially the nature of the
construct<00:04:50.790> but<00:04:51.390> in<00:04:51.510> case<00:04:51.720> of<00:04:51.900> the<00:04:52.020> formative

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380 
construct but in case of the formative

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:56.140 
construct but in case of the formative
measures<00:04:53.480> since<00:04:54.480> it's<00:04:54.780> the<00:04:55.140> indicators<00:04:55.830> that

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:56.150 
measures since it's the indicators that

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:58.960 
measures since it's the indicators that
lead<00:04:57.150> to<00:04:57.180> the<00:04:57.420> change<00:04:57.450> in<00:04:58.080> the<00:04:58.290> construct

00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:58.970 
lead to the change in the construct

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:02.900 
lead to the change in the construct
vomiting<00:04:59.970> and<00:05:00.180> indicator<00:05:01.080> is<00:05:01.790> emitting<00:05:02.790> a

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:02.910 
vomiting and indicator is emitting a

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:04.910 
vomiting and indicator is emitting a

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:04.920 
part of the construct and therefore

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:06.200 
part of the construct and therefore
there<00:05:05.070> will<00:05:05.130> be<00:05:05.190> there<00:05:05.670> will<00:05:05.700> be<00:05:05.850> a<00:05:05.880> huge

there will be there will be a huge

there will be there will be a huge

true<00:05:18.060> about<00:05:18.390> formative<00:05:18.810> measures<00:05:19.440> you<00:05:19.830> can

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:20.010 
true about formative measures you can

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:22.340 
true about formative measures you can

formative<00:05:28.980> and<00:05:29.400> reflective<00:05:30.030> measures<00:05:30.510> I<00:05:30.720> hope

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:31.230 
formative and reflective measures I hope
