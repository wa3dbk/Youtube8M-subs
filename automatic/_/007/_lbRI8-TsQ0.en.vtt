whatsoever<00:04:46.490> so<00:04:47.180> with<00:04:47.870> making<00:04:48.169> it<00:04:48.260> tough<00:04:48.440> to

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:49.400 
whatsoever so with making it tough to

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.520 
whatsoever so with making it tough to
get<00:04:49.490> by<00:04:49.729> but<00:04:49.970> just<00:04:50.180> that<00:04:50.300> one<00:04:50.510> lap<00:04:50.780> I<00:04:50.960> got<00:04:51.140> just

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:53.140 
get by but just that one lap I got just
close<00:04:51.770> enough<00:04:51.800> to<00:04:52.160> get<00:04:52.250> a<00:04:52.310> run<00:04:52.550> and<00:04:52.580> get<00:04:53.030> up

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:53.150 
close enough to get a run and get up

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:55.120 
close enough to get a run and get up
inside<00:04:53.660> through<00:04:54.020> the<00:04:54.050> through<00:04:54.680> the<00:04:54.740> drop<00:04:54.979> on

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:55.130
