next<00:01:38.369> taking<00:01:38.670> this<00:01:38.759> matte<00:01:39.030> topee<00:01:39.479> brown<00:01:39.720> color

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:40.400 
next taking this matte topee brown color

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.160 
next taking this matte topee brown color
I'm<00:01:41.400> not<00:01:41.880> going<00:01:42.119> to<00:01:42.210> put<00:01:42.360> it<00:01:42.479> right<00:01:42.509> my<00:01:42.840> crease

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
I'm not going to put it right my crease

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.289 
I'm not going to put it right my crease
but<00:01:43.890> instead<00:01:44.280> I'm<00:01:44.520> gonna<00:01:44.700> hold<00:01:44.939> my<00:01:45.000> brush

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
but instead I'm gonna hold my brush

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.640 
but instead I'm gonna hold my brush
upward<00:01:45.930> and<00:01:46.110> put<00:01:46.290> it<00:01:46.380> right<00:01:46.409> above<00:01:46.979> my

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:49.650 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:51.930 

the<00:01:50.650> reason<00:01:50.950> we<00:01:51.040> don't<00:01:51.160> put<00:01:51.370> this<00:01:51.460> color<00:01:51.700> right

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:51.940 
the reason we don't put this color right

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:53.520 
the reason we don't put this color right
in<00:01:52.060> my<00:01:52.150> crease<00:01:52.420> is<00:01:52.630> because<00:01:52.960> by<00:01:53.110> putting<00:01:53.290> it

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
in my crease is because by putting it

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.620 
in my crease is because by putting it
above<00:01:53.920> my<00:01:54.190> crease<00:01:54.250> it<00:01:54.880> gets<00:01:55.090> the<00:01:55.240> illusion

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
above my crease it gets the illusion

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:56.760 
above my crease it gets the illusion
that<00:01:55.720> my<00:01:55.870> eyes<00:01:56.020> are<00:01:56.050> a<00:01:56.260> little<00:01:56.410> bit<00:01:56.590> bigger

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:56.770 
that my eyes are a little bit bigger

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:58.560 
that my eyes are a little bit bigger

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:01.270 
because if your eyelashes down outward

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:02.880 
because if your eyelashes down outward
they'll<00:04:01.840> tend<00:04:02.020> to<00:04:02.140> hit<00:04:02.260> the<00:04:02.410> rim<00:04:02.710> of<00:04:02.740> your
