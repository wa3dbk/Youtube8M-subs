there
so<00:00:51.309> this<00:00:51.460> is<00:00:51.640> very<00:00:51.909> clear<00:00:52.239> wine<00:00:52.769> now<00:00:53.769> there<00:00:53.979> may

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:56.400 
be a little bit of debris at the bottom

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.710 
be a little bit of debris at the bottom
so<00:00:57.400> we<00:00:57.790> are<00:00:57.909> going<00:00:58.150> to<00:00:58.299> do<00:00:58.570> our<00:00:58.600> final<00:00:59.500> racking

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:00.720 
so we are going to do our final racking

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.310 
so we are going to do our final racking
and<00:01:02.549> then<00:01:03.549> with<00:01:03.879> the<00:01:04.119> final<00:01:04.540> racking<00:01:04.960> this

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:05.320 
and then with the final racking this

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.690 
and then with the final racking this
will<00:01:05.500> also<00:01:05.680> help<00:01:06.130> to<00:01:06.280> make<00:01:07.030> the<00:01:07.240> alcohol

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
will also help to make the alcohol

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.420 
will also help to make the alcohol
throughout<00:01:09.700> all<00:01:10.180> the<00:01:10.480> wine<00:01:10.720> because<00:01:11.440> after<00:01:12.400> a

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:12.430 
throughout all the wine because after a

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:14.520 
throughout all the wine because after a
while<00:01:12.670> your<00:01:12.970> alcohol<00:01:13.450> sinks<00:01:13.900> down<00:01:14.170> to<00:01:14.440> the

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.530 
while your alcohol sinks down to the

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.490 
while your alcohol sinks down to the
bottom<00:01:14.890> so<00:01:15.580> we<00:01:15.760> after<00:01:16.360> we<00:01:16.570> rack<00:01:16.990> it<00:01:17.170> up<00:01:17.290> one

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:17.500 
bottom so we after we rack it up one

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.470 
bottom so we after we rack it up one
more<00:01:17.710> time<00:01:17.740> it'll<00:01:18.340> help<00:01:18.520> to<00:01:18.670> stir<00:01:18.940> it<00:01:19.120> up<00:01:19.270> and

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:19.480 
more time it'll help to stir it up and

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.480 
more time it'll help to stir it up and
make<00:01:19.660> it<00:01:19.690> more<00:01:20.080> even<00:01:20.410> so<00:01:20.830> when<00:01:20.980> we<00:01:21.100> put<00:01:21.310> it<00:01:21.400> in

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:21.490 
make it more even so when we put it in

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.210 
make it more even so when we put it in
bottles<00:01:21.730> it's<00:01:22.570> a<00:01:22.720> more<00:01:22.960> even<00:01:23.380> wine<00:01:23.650> if<00:01:24.070> we

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:24.220 
bottles it's a more even wine if we

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.280 
bottles it's a more even wine if we
don't<00:01:24.400> have<00:01:24.610> some<00:01:24.940> with<00:01:25.270> eight<00:01:25.720> percent

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:26.290 
don't have some with eight percent

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:28.200 
don't have some with eight percent
alcohol<00:01:26.470> and<00:01:27.040> some<00:01:27.580> with<00:01:27.760> even<00:01:28.060> maybe

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.210 
alcohol and some with even maybe

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.320 
alcohol and some with even maybe
seventeen<00:01:28.870> percent<00:01:29.110> so<00:01:30.040> everything<00:01:30.760> has<00:01:31.060> been

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:31.330 
seventeen percent so everything has been

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.200 
seventeen percent so everything has been
cleaned<00:01:31.690> already<00:01:31.930> i've<00:01:32.560> got<00:01:33.430> the<00:01:33.640> usual

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.210 
cleaned already i've got the usual

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.260 
cleaned already i've got the usual
siphon<00:01:34.930> hose<00:01:35.110> and<00:01:35.500> then<00:01:36.400> just<00:01:36.700> take<00:01:36.909> the<00:01:36.940> cap

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270 
siphon hose and then just take the cap

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:42.050 
siphon hose and then just take the cap
off<00:01:37.480> here

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.870 

and<00:01:42.630> as<00:01:42.900> you've<00:01:43.200> seen<00:01:43.440> demonstrated<00:01:44.280> in<00:01:44.490> all

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
and as you've seen demonstrated in all

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.740 
and as you've seen demonstrated in all
of<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.330> other<00:01:45.479> videos<00:01:47.150> it's<00:01:48.150> just<00:01:48.240> a<00:01:48.510> matter

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
of the other videos it's just a matter

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.330 
of the other videos it's just a matter
of<00:01:51.170> putting<00:01:52.170> all<00:01:52.440> the<00:01:52.470> wine<00:01:52.740> in<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.070> next

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
of putting all the wine in the next

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.780 
of putting all the wine in the next
container<00:01:56.420> so<00:01:57.420> I'll<00:01:57.600> thunk<00:01:57.840> this<00:01:57.990> a<00:01:58.050> few<00:01:58.380> times

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:58.790 
container so I'll thunk this a few times

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.310 
container so I'll thunk this a few times
actually<00:01:59.790> wants<00:02:00.390> us<00:02:00.509> all<00:02:00.659> it<00:02:00.780> needed<00:02:01.140> and

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
actually wants us all it needed and

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.380 
actually wants us all it needed and
again<00:02:01.979> to<00:02:02.280> make<00:02:02.460> sure<00:02:02.610> you<00:02:02.759> try<00:02:02.970> to<00:02:03.030> keep<00:02:03.240> out

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
again to make sure you try to keep out

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.719 
again to make sure you try to keep out
as<00:02:03.570> little<00:02:03.869> air<00:02:04.080> as<00:02:04.259> possible<00:02:04.890> try<00:02:05.460> to<00:02:05.520> get

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
as little air as possible try to get

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.789 
as little air as possible try to get
your<00:02:05.820> tube<00:02:06.090> all<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:06.420> way<00:02:06.810> near<00:02:07.259> the<00:02:07.440> bottom

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
your tube all the way near the bottom

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.790

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
time we're just going to go ahead and

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.979 
time we're just going to go ahead and

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
then we can start bottling welcome back

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.570 
then we can start bottling welcome back
we're<00:02:34.140> just<00:02:34.170> about<00:02:34.560> done<00:02:34.830> transferring<00:02:35.459> the

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
we're just about done transferring the

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:41.620 
we're just about done transferring the
wine<00:02:35.760> into<00:02:36.030> the<00:02:36.510> other<00:02:37.500> container<00:02:37.680> here<00:02:40.580> and

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
wine into the other container here and

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:46.310 
wine into the other container here and
there<00:02:42.630> is<00:02:42.750> not<00:02:42.930> very<00:02:43.560> much<00:02:44.040> leaf<00:02:44.880> or<00:02:45.510> sediment

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
there is not very much leaf or sediment

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.259 
there is not very much leaf or sediment
at<00:02:46.470> the<00:02:46.500> bottom<00:02:46.590> of<00:02:47.040> this<00:02:47.130> racking<00:02:47.640> there<00:02:47.940> is<00:02:48.239> a

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
at the bottom of this racking there is a

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:51.110 
at the bottom of this racking there is a
little<00:02:48.690> bit<00:02:48.870> you<00:02:48.989> can<00:02:49.110> tell<00:02:49.380> it<00:02:49.590> on<00:02:50.400> the<00:02:50.760> bottom

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
little bit you can tell it on the bottom

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.030 
little bit you can tell it on the bottom
there<00:02:51.360> it's<00:02:51.720> just<00:02:52.019> sticking<00:02:52.350> a<00:02:52.560> little<00:02:52.680> bit

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
there it's just sticking a little bit

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.720 
there it's just sticking a little bit
but<00:02:53.880> there<00:02:54.150> is<00:02:54.329> not<00:02:54.660> very<00:02:54.959> much<00:02:55.260> at<00:02:55.470> all<00:02:55.730> that's

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
but there is not very much at all that's

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.850 
but there is not very much at all that's
why<00:02:57.120> you<00:02:57.180> rack<00:02:57.600> your<00:02:57.870> wine<00:02:58.079> up<00:02:58.350> several<00:02:58.680> times

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
why you rack your wine up several times

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.949 
why you rack your wine up several times
to<00:02:59.430> get<00:02:59.549> rid<00:02:59.610> of<00:02:59.790> that<00:03:00.030> so<00:03:00.360> you<00:03:00.480> don't<00:03:00.600> get<00:03:00.840> it

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
to get rid of that so you don't get it

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:04.479 
to get rid of that so you don't get it
in<00:03:01.079> your<00:03:01.110> final<00:03:01.620> finished<00:03:01.980> product<00:03:02.690> and

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:04.489 
in your final finished product and

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:11.000 
in your final finished product and
that's<00:03:05.489> it<00:03:06.410> now<00:03:07.410> comes<00:03:07.739> fill<00:03:08.040> you<00:03:09.709> what<00:03:10.709> I<00:03:10.739> have

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
here is a bottle filler

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:21.710 
here is a bottle filler
it's<00:03:17.910> a<00:03:18.210> fairly<00:03:18.930> cheap<00:03:19.230> generic<00:03:19.800> one<00:03:20.720> it's

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
it's a fairly cheap generic one it's

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.990 
it's a fairly cheap generic one it's
just<00:03:21.960> a<00:03:22.230> hard<00:03:22.560> plastic<00:03:22.860> tube<00:03:23.400> and<00:03:23.700> it<00:03:23.850> has<00:03:23.970> a

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
just a hard plastic tube and it has a

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.180 
just a hard plastic tube and it has a
spring-loaded<00:03:24.690> trigger<00:03:25.200> at<00:03:25.410> the<00:03:25.530> bottom<00:03:25.890> and

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
spring-loaded trigger at the bottom and

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.190 
spring-loaded trigger at the bottom and
when<00:03:26.610> it's<00:03:26.730> depressed<00:03:27.210> at<00:03:27.390> the<00:03:27.480> bottom<00:03:27.870> of<00:03:28.080> the

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
when it's depressed at the bottom of the

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.930 
when it's depressed at the bottom of the
barrel<00:03:28.650> or<00:03:28.860> the<00:03:28.920> bottom<00:03:29.250> of<00:03:29.340> the<00:03:29.430> bottle<00:03:29.790> it

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
barrel or the bottom of the bottle it

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.040 
barrel or the bottom of the bottle it
allows<00:03:30.900> the<00:03:31.490> wine<00:03:32.490> to<00:03:32.880> filter<00:03:33.240> into<00:03:33.450> the

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.050 
allows the wine to filter into the

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:37.640 
allows the wine to filter into the
bottles<00:03:34.410> the<00:03:35.250> bottles<00:03:35.960> then<00:03:36.960> you<00:03:37.170> just<00:03:37.380> attach

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
bottles the bottles then you just attach

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:46.680 
bottles the bottles then you just attach
it<00:03:37.680> to<00:03:38.010> the<00:03:38.130> end<00:03:38.370> of<00:03:38.580> your<00:03:38.760> hose<00:03:38.940> here

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:48.990 

now<00:03:47.260> the<00:03:47.320> first<00:03:47.650> bottle<00:03:48.070> is<00:03:48.250> very<00:03:48.310> hard<00:03:48.880> to

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
now the first bottle is very hard to

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.410 
now the first bottle is very hard to
fill<00:03:49.330> why<00:03:50.110> well<00:03:50.740> because<00:03:50.950> since<00:03:51.700> this<00:03:51.910> end

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:52.420 
fill why well because since this end

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:55.860 
fill why well because since this end
stops<00:03:53.410> the<00:03:53.770> flow<00:03:53.920> no<00:03:54.850> air<00:03:55.090> is<00:03:55.300> getting<00:03:55.450> in<00:03:55.720> or

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
stops the flow no air is getting in or

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:58.080 
stops the flow no air is getting in or
out<00:03:55.900> so<00:03:56.410> you<00:03:56.470> need<00:03:56.890> to<00:03:57.100> somehow<00:03:57.580> figure<00:03:57.850> out

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
out so you need to somehow figure out

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:01.740 
out so you need to somehow figure out
how<00:03:58.270> to<00:03:58.330> depress<00:03:59.080> this<00:03:59.530> while<00:04:00.370> you<00:04:00.700> pump<00:04:00.970> your

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
how to depress this while you pump your

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:06.060 
how to depress this while you pump your
siphon<00:04:02.260> that<00:04:02.590> way<00:04:03.430> the<00:04:03.940> flow<00:04:04.420> can<00:04:04.690> start<00:04:05.070> so

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:06.070 
siphon that way the flow can start so

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:08.130 
siphon that way the flow can start so
I'm<00:04:06.640> going<00:04:06.880> to<00:04:06.940> have<00:04:07.060> to<00:04:07.180> do<00:04:07.330> the<00:04:07.480> first<00:04:07.690> bottle

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:08.140 
I'm going to have to do the first bottle

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:10.260 
I'm going to have to do the first bottle
up<00:04:08.320> here<00:04:08.650> so<00:04:08.890> I<00:04:08.920> can<00:04:09.190> kind<00:04:09.430> of<00:04:09.520> hold<00:04:09.760> this<00:04:09.940> down

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:10.270 
up here so I can kind of hold this down

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:12.720 
up here so I can kind of hold this down
in<00:04:10.540> the<00:04:10.690> bottle<00:04:11.110> and<00:04:11.380> also<00:04:12.040> pump<00:04:12.280> at<00:04:12.430> the<00:04:12.520> same

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:12.730 
in the bottle and also pump at the same

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:21.379 
in the bottle and also pump at the same
time<00:04:15.780> so<00:04:16.780> I<00:04:16.810> put<00:04:17.019> that<00:04:17.049> down<00:04:17.380> in<00:04:17.560> your<00:04:17.680> bottle

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:21.389 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:25.790 

put<00:04:21.870> that<00:04:22.049> in<00:04:22.259> there<00:04:24.020> go<00:04:25.020> ahead<00:04:25.050> and<00:04:25.500> start

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
put that in there go ahead and start

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.659 
put that in there go ahead and start
priming<00:04:26.129> that<00:04:26.460> a<00:04:26.490> little<00:04:26.819> bit<00:04:28.400> now<00:04:29.400> I've<00:04:29.520> got

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:29.669 
priming that a little bit now I've got

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:35.929 
priming that a little bit now I've got
my<00:04:29.819> arm<00:04:30.090> holding<00:04:30.689> this<00:04:30.810> down<00:04:31.110> here<00:04:31.560> and<00:04:34.939> there

00:04:35.929 --> 00:04:35.939 
my arm holding this down here and there

00:04:35.939 --> 00:04:40.700 
my arm holding this down here and there
goes<00:04:36.180> the<00:04:36.389> blow<00:04:38.870> so<00:04:39.870> I'll<00:04:40.020> just<00:04:40.199> continue<00:04:40.409> to

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710 
goes the blow so I'll just continue to

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:42.529 
goes the blow so I'll just continue to
hold<00:04:40.889> this<00:04:41.069> down<00:04:41.340> and<00:04:41.639> it<00:04:41.699> will<00:04:41.789> fill<00:04:42.060> this<00:04:42.270> and

00:04:42.529 --> 00:04:42.539 
hold this down and it will fill this and

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:45.260 
hold this down and it will fill this and
then<00:04:43.139> I'll<00:04:43.259> get<00:04:43.409> one<00:04:43.680> of<00:04:43.710> the<00:04:44.219> clear<00:04:44.729> bottles

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.270 
then I'll get one of the clear bottles

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:48.249 
then I'll get one of the clear bottles
and<00:04:45.479> you<00:04:45.569> can<00:04:45.719> see<00:04:45.930> how<00:04:46.110> it<00:04:46.259> works<00:04:46.469> better

00:04:48.249 --> 00:04:48.259 
and you can see how it works better

00:04:48.259 --> 00:04:51.559 
and you can see how it works better
then<00:04:49.259> once<00:04:49.500> the<00:04:49.590> bottle<00:04:49.949> gets<00:04:50.159> filled<00:04:50.569> it'll

00:04:51.559 --> 00:04:51.569 
then once the bottle gets filled it'll

00:04:51.569 --> 00:04:53.809 
then once the bottle gets filled it'll
just<00:04:51.780> pull<00:04:52.379> up<00:04:52.409> your<00:04:52.620> flow<00:04:53.009> or<00:04:53.370> and<00:04:53.520> pull<00:04:53.669> up

00:04:53.809 --> 00:04:53.819 
just pull up your flow or and pull up

00:04:53.819 --> 00:04:57.429 
just pull up your flow or and pull up
your<00:04:54.259> filler<00:04:55.259> go<00:04:55.680> move<00:04:56.460> it<00:04:56.550> a<00:04:56.580> little<00:04:56.669> over<00:04:57.120> and

00:05:02.439 --> 00:05:02.449 

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:07.429 

so<00:05:03.449> that<00:05:03.479> was<00:05:03.870> all<00:05:04.020> that<00:05:05.180> push<00:05:06.180> the<00:05:06.360> bottom<00:05:06.689> and

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:17.900 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:20.770 

so<00:05:18.470> that<00:05:18.830> is<00:05:18.980> how<00:05:19.160> you<00:05:19.190> bottle<00:05:20.150> your<00:05:20.270> wine<00:05:20.450> this

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:20.780 
so that is how you bottle your wine this

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:22.960 
so that is how you bottle your wine this
is<00:05:20.990> a<00:05:21.020> quick<00:05:21.830> and<00:05:21.860> easy<00:05:22.100> way<00:05:22.370> to<00:05:22.400> do<00:05:22.670> it<00:05:22.820> of

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:22.970 
is a quick and easy way to do it of

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:24.580 
is a quick and easy way to do it of
course<00:05:23.270> you<00:05:23.420> do<00:05:23.540> not<00:05:23.570> need<00:05:23.900> the<00:05:24.050> bottle<00:05:24.380> wand

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:24.590 
course you do not need the bottle wand

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:27.520 
course you do not need the bottle wand
you<00:05:25.400> could<00:05:25.940> just<00:05:26.180> use<00:05:26.480> this<00:05:26.780> which<00:05:27.050> is<00:05:27.230> what<00:05:27.380> we

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:27.530 
you could just use this which is what we

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:30.100 
you could just use this which is what we
originally<00:05:28.130> used<00:05:28.490> which<00:05:28.700> is<00:05:28.850> a<00:05:28.970> clamp<00:05:29.360> so<00:05:30.020> you

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:30.110 
originally used which is a clamp so you

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:32.530 
originally used which is a clamp so you
can<00:05:30.260> clamp<00:05:30.590> the<00:05:30.830> flow<00:05:31.040> on<00:05:31.310> and<00:05:31.490> off<00:05:31.610> but<00:05:32.360> this

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:32.540 
can clamp the flow on and off but this

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:34.810 
can clamp the flow on and off but this
way<00:05:32.780> is<00:05:33.020> a<00:05:33.050> lot<00:05:33.350> easier<00:05:33.830> and<00:05:33.920> a<00:05:34.160> lot<00:05:34.280> cleaner<00:05:34.640> to

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:34.820 
way is a lot easier and a lot cleaner to

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:38.320 
way is a lot easier and a lot cleaner to
use<00:05:35.000> so<00:05:35.900> that's<00:05:36.860> how<00:05:37.070> the<00:05:37.130> bottle<00:05:37.430> wine<00:05:37.610> thanks

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:38.330
