00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:14.650
 we have the best and biggest expense per 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:19.500
 below but less 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:19.500
 here we have the previous closed 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:26.820
 previous 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:26.820
 the oblique of the equipment 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:34.189
 but I only took how many people 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:41.320
 and here we have ours is fine the 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:43.330
 externally they look like they did there 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:46.260
 so the external intercostal and the 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:50.089
 internal intercostals to the other side 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.089
 this source 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:01:01.469
 before we all have the discussion so 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:01.469
 through him 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:12.200
 this is the capsule lifter 

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:15.100
 then it must be muscles and this is the 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.100
 office in the head 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.509
 The directors 

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:39.789
 on the latissimus 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.590
 if it has 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.300
 all this and the greater minutes 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:09.670
 previous this dorsal that we are going to open 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:09.670
 a future lung 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.610
 all right 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.390
 and above all we only have him or not 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.319
 I do not remember too 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.400
 these verses
