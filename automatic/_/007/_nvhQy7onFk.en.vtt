that is the time you will add the ground

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.340 
that is the time you will add the ground
rice<00:01:14.840> mixture<00:01:15.410> so<00:01:16.010> if<00:01:16.160> you<00:01:16.310> don't<00:01:16.580> add<00:01:17.210> the

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350 
rice mixture so if you don't add the

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.700 
rice mixture so if you don't add the
rice<00:01:18.350> mixture<00:01:18.830> in<00:01:19.640> the<00:01:19.910> beginning<00:01:20.590> you<00:01:21.590> will

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
rice mixture in the beginning you will

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.120 
rice mixture in the beginning you will
see<00:01:21.920> that<00:01:22.100> there<00:01:22.790> are<00:01:22.870> lumps<00:01:23.870> that<00:01:23.900> fall<00:01:24.470> so

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
see that there are lumps that fall so

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.570 
see that there are lumps that fall so
very<00:01:25.460> important<00:01:25.970> and<00:01:26.680> you<00:01:27.680> sprinkle<00:01:28.100> some

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:28.580 
very important and you sprinkle some

green cardamom powder now when the milk
is<00:01:31.730> cold<00:01:32.120> you<00:01:33.050> will<00:01:33.110> see<00:01:33.320> that<00:01:33.500> the<00:01:33.680> green

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
cardamom powder mixes up easily now I'm

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.330 
cardamom powder mixes up easily now I'm
not<00:01:37.400> handing<00:01:37.970> sugar<00:01:38.480> to<00:01:38.630> this<00:01:38.780> fear<00:01:39.050> me<00:01:39.340> simply

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
not handing sugar to this fear me simply

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.960 
not handing sugar to this fear me simply
because<00:01:40.760> the<00:01:41.600> multitude<00:01:42.170> ladoos<00:01:42.710> that<00:01:43.160> I<00:01:43.430> am

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
because the multitude ladoos that I am

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.410 
because the multitude ladoos that I am
adding<00:01:44.450> have<00:01:45.050> so<00:01:45.560> much<00:01:45.680> of<00:01:45.740> sugar<00:01:45.890> in<00:01:46.370> it<00:01:46.520> once

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
adding have so much of sugar in it once

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.020 
adding have so much of sugar in it once
the<00:01:47.630> mixture<00:01:47.900> becomes<00:01:48.620> homogeneous<00:01:49.070> nice<00:01:49.730> and

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
the mixture becomes homogeneous nice and

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.420 
the mixture becomes homogeneous nice and
thick<00:01:50.300> you<00:01:50.600> can<00:01:51.200> always<00:01:51.230> reduce<00:01:51.830> the<00:01:52.220> gas

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:52.430 
thick you can always reduce the gas

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.240 
thick you can always reduce the gas
flame<00:01:52.730> or<00:01:53.380> like<00:01:54.380> I<00:01:54.500> am<00:01:54.560> using<00:01:54.740> an<00:01:54.980> induction

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
flame or like I am using an induction

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.470 
flame or like I am using an induction
you<00:01:55.970> can<00:01:56.150> always<00:01:56.650> reduce<00:01:57.650> the<00:01:58.070> induction<00:01:58.760> you

00:01:59.470 --> 00:01:59.480 
you can always reduce the induction you

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:00.940 
you can always reduce the induction you
need<00:01:59.630> to<00:01:59.750> keep<00:01:59.960> cooking<00:02:00.350> because<00:02:00.620> the<00:02:00.770> rice

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
need to keep cooking because the rice

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.430 
need to keep cooking because the rice
needs<00:02:01.310> to<00:02:01.460> get<00:02:01.580> cooked<00:02:01.910> the<00:02:02.630> rawness<00:02:02.900> in<00:02:03.320> the

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:03.440 
needs to get cooked the rawness in the

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.160 
needs to get cooked the rawness in the
rice<00:02:03.620> should<00:02:04.460> not<00:02:04.700> be<00:02:04.940> in<00:02:05.270> the<00:02:05.660> mouth<00:02:05.810> filled

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
rice should not be in the mouth filled

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.240 
rice should not be in the mouth filled
and<00:02:06.830> quickly<00:02:07.509> to<00:02:08.509> this<00:02:08.659> mixture<00:02:09.110> now<00:02:09.319> to<00:02:10.039> add

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
and quickly to this mixture now to add
