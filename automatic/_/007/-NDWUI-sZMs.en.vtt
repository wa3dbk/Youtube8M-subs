00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 hello youtube friends like they are 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.779
 your friend speaks what whole myers good 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.719
 this is the last video that I will do in this 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.700
 year so I hope you like it good 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.710
 in this video I will talk about the magnificent 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.960
 the undertaker's streak and I'll give you some 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.240
 how many reasons why your streak 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.420
 in thick men can not finish good 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:25.289
 let the good video begin the streak of 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:27.599
 undertaker started in 1991 in thick men 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.760
 already 7 when he defeated jimmy super is 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.250
 never good when the undertaker 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.040
 faced shawn michaels in bone mania 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.620
 25 the fight was named as the best 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.590
 2009 so when was the 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.090
 confrontation of gross mania 26 many 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.370
 they thought that shawn's career 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.680
 michaels mattered more than the streak of 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.200
 where taker but it's not like that the fight 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:52.890
 of undertaker against triple h in thickness 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:55.350
 mania 27 won 68.3 percent of 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.750
 ticket sales so thanks to that 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.340
 fight attended many people to the event by 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.739
 thanks to the streak of 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.930
 undertaker there are many people to thick 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.150
 already the day that the undertaker no longer 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.870
 be in thick men will already be the doom 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.660
 from the ub 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:12.240
 w then without undertaker in bone men already 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:14.400
 will be the end of that event because thanks to 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.530
 he thick men is already as it is when 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.510
 he leaves he will leave a hole that never 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.790
 they will repair or it will take a long time 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:22.860
 time to cover up that's why the 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.110
 undertaker is more important than 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.360
 shawn michaels career even that the 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.550
 career of many more fighters besides 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.250
 in a recent interview the undertaker 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:34.440
 stated that he still did not give all of himself 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.230
 means that he will retire when his 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:39.030
 streak come 25 to 0 so we'll have to 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:41.160
 undertaker five more years 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.010
 also the undertaker is telling us 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:46.170
 five years before this happens that 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:48.330
 is to prepare us for his retirement and so 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.780
 Try to make sure that your retirement does not affect 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:55.170
 to wwf the undertaker's streak is very 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:57.480
 important to wwf is probably what 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.910
 more important that you also have define 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:02.100
 since when the undertaker arrived at the 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:04.410
 six consecutive victories in thick 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.600
 since then he turned his face 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:08.940
 of thick men and that's why you take long 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.520
 breaks like 10 months and after 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.980
 before royal rumble appears and looks for a 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.140
 Challenger then during all your rest 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:19.049
 he spent training for average thickness 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:21.330
 so yes fight in thick men and 29 no 

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:23.580
 be surprised that after thick menu 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:26.580
 already take a long break like 10 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:29.069
 months until your streak reaches 25 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.980
 wins and 0 losses and after that 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:34.470
 will retire good friends that has been 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.780
 I hope you liked it, I know that 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:39.750
 He was a bit screwed but it was for lack of 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:42.299
 time they subscribe they rate themselves like 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:46.129
 comment and share the video you have 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:46.129
