00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:07.670
 next i have an error in the 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:10.210
 patent pattern and that is a mesh 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:13.639
 which belongs actually lifted off to the left 

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:14.590
 knitted on the right you can see it better 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:18.500
 this side 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:20.480
 here is the mistake we correct 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:25.339
 also in which we the affected mesh 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:29.179
 drop on the right side like that 

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:31.400
 just not so mistake again we resolved 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:34.310
 Take our crochet hook grab again 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:37.760
 the mesh it always concerns 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:41.440
 Thinking of a damage that runs high 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:44.660
 is envelope driveways to knit 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:50.539
 mesh envelope then he comes to 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:54.070
 stretch traveled mesh envelope that 

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:54.070
 Here he is to knit the rides 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:01:04.040
 mesh envelope of length is the too 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:06.940
 knitting thread mesh envelope that 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:11.450
 longer is the to drive on stretched 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:15.440
 mesh envelope the longer it is too 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:20.420
 knit the rides in the fall 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:22.900
 I then the stitch on the thread 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:25.580
 I have to stretch too 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:28.610
 now I can dare to because the mesh 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:30.950
 on this needle the turn 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.840
 because the direction is knitted it is 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.210
 a left mesh but this is left 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.800
 lifted now I have the problem 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.740
 that mesh really is one 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:42.560
 should be double mesh without the 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:46.490
 Umschlag lies you turn the whole thing a bit 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:48.650
 you can see that two fell here once 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:52.210
 against which are not knitted 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:55.550
 the shorter is also envelope thread 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:57.650
 the pioneer the longer one belongs here 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:02.410
 high you just lift him on the 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:02.410
 left nobility and strict pattern continues
