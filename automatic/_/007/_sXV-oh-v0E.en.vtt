00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:13.910
 do not 

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:28.950
 did you know that the development of bathroom case 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.750
 Jim knotts both was a bit messy 

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:32.400
 in fact the final product sparingly 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.320
 resembles the initial design 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.150
 radjavi nicknamed the new bathroom game 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.900
 case I saw how it goes on youtube from the 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:41.640
 launch of van youtube in 64 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:43.470
 they even showed a mobile page tech 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.809
 war of 2000 although they never called it 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:47.940
 banjo tree was a sure sign that 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.910
 was producing a new title of the 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:54.090
 series and this is where things start 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.640
 to get weird in September of 2002 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.870
 Roger was bought by micros purchase 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.940
 included all the properties 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.290
 web network intellectuals including baby 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.120
 with that multiple games of nintendo 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:04.890
 they were canceled jáiber began to 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.720
 work in games for the Mac xbox 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.730
 they are and so we know this too 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.830
 included banier a while ago the 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:12.570
 central network administrators said 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.450
 that they worked with a game called 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.190
 banjo x clearly demonstrating that it would be 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.229
 a title for the original black without 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.909
 However, the project never started 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.470
 never saw the light they took the code of 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.600
 game and we could see new devices 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.610
 like spring in my shoes 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.200
 rockets the most metal curros of 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.050
 invisibility chocolates aviator 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.720
 bag 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:33.580
 and a diamond peak also includes 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.350
 Game objects like brand by the 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.910
 world and viva piñata we know that both 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.070
 games were developed for the 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:40.810
 original reader at a certain time so 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.700
 this makes sense in a chat from the 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.440
 community with several people fans of the 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.360
 series of jacques maynes a programmer 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.220
 key in the franchise revealed that they are not 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.680
 bosc but the third attempt to make 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.540
 a year helmet and three the first ideas 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:55.570
 include redoing the game with changes 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:57.520
 very bizarre and unexpected 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:59.860
 something similar to how they remade a game 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.050
 of Kurdish behavior and an example of this 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.820
 it was a termite queen at the top of the 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:05.770
 first level of bathroom ksweet monbus 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:08.290
 mountain doing that with vale launch 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.510
 for oranges by the wind the next 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:11.860
 idea was a traditional platform with 

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:13.300
 groupe life chasing our 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.420
 couple for each level 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:18.250
 trying to destroy them in every scenario 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.810
 then in the respect of the both were 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.570
 so complicated that it is almost impossible 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.610
 decide where was left of the x without 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:27.400
 However, there is something that we can do 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.410
 be sure in 2004 king started to 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.450
 work on a beloved game by joe that 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.040
 I assumed when this name came out people 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.520
 thought about creating title in development of 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.130
 game 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:38.200
 25 years dance but it was really a 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.510
 racing game designed for the xbox 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.490
 the focus of the game was to build their 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.110
 own vehicles with different parts 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:46.030
 and then start running their own 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.440
 creations however the game was 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.180
 stored and the concept was 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.040
 implemented in both when the 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.270
 developers realized that 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.830
 the levels were very large for 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:55.240
 tour them here this made the 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.460
 project was redone 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:59.530
 completely with vehicles in mind the 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:02.080
 titles for this game include banjo 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:04.600
 would be my new case and 3 and neighborhood trex and 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.700
 all these suggest that our partners 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:09.670
 of the idea of a traditional tour band 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:12.460
 3d plataformer as well as banjo 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:14.620
 kazooie went on youtube 

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:17.200
 in case you have lost, here 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.570
 a summary of the tri was presented in the 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:22.480
 space book as a show video but 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:26.490
 a meter only buy vaio x bathroom katsumi 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:29.100
 and finally upload 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:30.900
 did you know that I dance that initially I was going to 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:33.690
 be a super nintendo game called 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.550
 project min focusing on a boy 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.590
 called erection and banjo was a 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:39.510
 secondary character that resembled ones 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.100
 generic there was also an idiot dog and 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.330
 a school the delinquent game 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:44.130
 developed more than expected and 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:47.880
 They decided to move the project 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:49.260
 super nintendo nintendo 64 the character 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.150
 main in the game was changed the 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.860
 rabbit actually changed into repeated 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:55.320
 occasions until the paper was given 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:56.760
 I 'm not loving was worth not mentioning that the 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:58.710
 main argument took a change 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.810
 massive blue and it's not going to have any 

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:02.760
 meanings including but it appeared 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:03.690
 like a bird inside a nest in its 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.340
 own house 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.750
 the main enemies of the game was 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.490
 a band of pirate videos by the 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.110
 Captain Black Eyed is indeed 

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:11.820
 reference the street of bathroom game almost 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:13.800
 at the level of more they do not stain their 

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:15.990
 portrait comes out behind a chest of these 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:18.239
 appeared later on a cam on youtube 

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:20.580
 go repeating constantly a subtraction 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:23.860
 of use in reference is projectile 

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:26.090
 talking about a bear that stole his glory 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:28.580
 taking the receptors and leaving the 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:30.560
 black eyed captain in the dark together 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.389
