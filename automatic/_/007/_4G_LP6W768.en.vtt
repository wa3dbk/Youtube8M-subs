controllers you have to have comfort I

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.950 
controllers you have to have comfort I
also<00:02:20.520> like<00:02:20.790> how<00:02:21.000> the<00:02:21.060> analogues<00:02:21.570> are<00:02:21.720> more

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
also like how the analogues are more

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.570 
also like how the analogues are more
tense<00:02:22.290> than<00:02:22.560> the<00:02:22.650> previous<00:02:23.070> model<00:02:23.460> they

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
tense than the previous model they

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.490 
tense than the previous model they
aren't<00:02:23.910> super<00:02:24.300> loose<00:02:24.510> but<00:02:24.810> still<00:02:25.080> move<00:02:25.260> freely

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
aren't super loose but still move freely

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.380 
aren't super loose but still move freely
which<00:02:26.280> in<00:02:26.430> return<00:02:26.580> makes<00:02:26.970> it<00:02:27.120> even<00:02:27.240> more

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
which in return makes it even more

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.690 
which in return makes it even more
accurate<00:02:27.960> they<00:02:28.410> also<00:02:28.590> added<00:02:28.860> a<00:02:29.040> share<00:02:29.340> button

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
accurate they also added a share button

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.250 
accurate they also added a share button
and<00:02:29.850> an<00:02:30.120> options<00:02:30.540> button<00:02:30.630> right<00:02:31.050> in<00:02:31.080> the

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
and an options button right in the

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:32.750 
and an options button right in the
controller<00:02:31.620> for<00:02:31.800> easy<00:02:31.950> access<00:02:32.160> and<00:02:32.550> we'll<00:02:32.640> go

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
controller for easy access and we'll go

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.670 
controller for easy access and we'll go
through<00:02:32.970> those<00:02:33.120> in<00:02:33.450> our<00:02:33.870> next<00:02:34.170> video

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
through those in our next video

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.380 
through those in our next video
between<00:02:35.280> analogs<00:02:35.730> you<00:02:35.940> will<00:02:36.060> find<00:02:36.300> an

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
between analogs you will find an

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.330 
between analogs you will find an
extension<00:02:36.690> port<00:02:37.230> along<00:02:37.590> with<00:02:37.650> your<00:02:37.980> headphone
