and<00:01:40.030> you<00:01:40.540> are<00:01:40.720> a<00:01:40.860> practitioner<00:01:41.860> of<00:01:42.280> one<00:01:42.850> of<00:01:42.939> the

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 
and you are a practitioner of one of the

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.020 
and you are a practitioner of one of the
oldest<00:01:43.360> forms<00:01:43.509> of<00:01:43.780> technology<00:01:44.290> that<00:01:44.970> I'm<00:01:45.970> a

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
oldest forms of technology that I'm a

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.060 
oldest forms of technology that I'm a
dinosaur<00:01:46.329> already<00:01:47.140> and<00:01:47.380> you<00:01:47.439> use<00:01:47.560> technology

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070 
dinosaur already and you use technology

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:49.710 
dinosaur already and you use technology
as<00:01:48.159> little<00:01:48.400> as<00:01:48.520> possible<00:01:48.670> in<00:01:49.090> your<00:01:49.119> entire

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:49.720 
as little as possible in your entire

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.480 
as little as possible in your entire
process<00:01:50.170> right<00:01:50.350> and<00:01:50.500> that's<00:01:50.740> not<00:01:50.920> because<00:01:51.460> I

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 
process right and that's not because I

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:52.980 
process right and that's not because I
don't<00:01:51.700> like<00:01:51.880> technologies<00:01:52.509> just<00:01:52.720> because<00:01:52.869> I

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
don't like technologies just because I

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.080 
don't like technologies just because I
was<00:01:53.439> some<00:01:53.710> slow<00:01:54.009> to<00:01:54.070> the<00:01:54.250> game<00:01:54.400> I'm<00:01:54.549> trying<00:01:54.820> and

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
was some slow to the game I'm trying and

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.719 
was some slow to the game I'm trying and
trying<00:01:55.210> to<00:01:55.390> learn<00:01:55.540> this<00:01:55.869> is<00:01:56.020> my<00:01:56.170> technology<00:01:56.729> or

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 
trying to learn this is my technology or

00:01:57.729 --> 00:01:59.639 
trying to learn this is my technology or
maybe<00:01:57.939> like<00:01:58.149> my<00:01:58.299> ideas<00:01:58.600> of<00:01:58.840> technology<00:01:59.500> as<00:01:59.619> a

00:01:59.639 --> 00:01:59.649 
maybe like my ideas of technology as a

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:01.950 
maybe like my ideas of technology as a
mechanical<00:02:00.220> version<00:02:00.880> of<00:02:01.180> these<00:02:01.329> have<00:02:01.899> you

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
bucks and then you have to look down at

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:41.310 
bucks and then you have to look down at
his<00:02:40.060> hand<00:02:40.300> and<00:02:40.540> see<00:02:40.630> that<00:02:40.750> he's<00:02:40.840> holding<00:02:41.020> like

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:41.320 
his hand and see that he's holding like

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:42.900 
his hand and see that he's holding like
a<00:02:41.350> paint<00:02:41.710> roller<00:02:41.770> like<00:02:42.340> he's<00:02:42.520> just<00:02:42.610> gonna<00:02:42.730> go

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:45.490 
but you have to see that and so I design

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:47.490 
but you have to see that and so I design
and<00:02:45.730> you<00:02:45.940> know<00:02:46.030> with<00:02:46.240> angles<00:02:46.690> so<00:02:46.960> that<00:02:46.990> your

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
and you know with angles so that your

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.370 
and you know with angles so that your
eye<00:02:47.530> kind<00:02:48.160> of<00:02:48.360> finds<00:02:49.360> that<00:02:49.540> joke<00:02:49.870> on<00:02:50.110> your<00:02:50.230> own

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 
does make people sort of think about

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:10.140 
does make people sort of think about
what<00:04:07.540> we<00:04:07.630> do<00:04:07.810> in<00:04:08.110> a<00:04:08.620> way<00:04:08.800> you<00:04:09.790> know<00:04:09.880> I<00:04:09.910> thought

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 
what we do in a way you know I thought

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:11.220 
what we do in a way you know I thought
at<00:04:10.300> one<00:04:10.330> point<00:04:10.450> that<00:04:10.720> it<00:04:10.840> would<00:04:10.930> make<00:04:11.050> people

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.230 
at one point that it would make people

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:13.890 
at one point that it would make people
think<00:04:11.530> gosh<00:04:11.890> this<00:04:12.130> is<00:04:12.220> really<00:04:12.430> hard<00:04:12.670> yeah<00:04:13.390> but

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:13.900 
think gosh this is really hard yeah but

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
think gosh this is really hard yeah but
I<00:04:13.959> don't<00:04:14.020> know<00:04:14.170> if<00:04:14.320> it's<00:04:14.440> doing<00:04:14.680> that<00:04:14.799> it

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:14.920 
I don't know if it's doing that it

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.860 
I don't know if it's doing that it
almost<00:04:15.040> makes<00:04:15.310> people<00:04:15.609> think<00:04:15.820> like<00:04:15.940> because

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:16.870 
almost makes people think like because

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:18.240 
almost makes people think like because
everyone<00:04:17.200> you<00:04:17.320> talk<00:04:17.470> to

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250 
everyone you talk to

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.039 
everyone you talk to
who<00:04:18.760> submitted<00:04:19.120> thinks<00:04:19.510> their<00:04:19.630> idea<00:04:19.900> was

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049 
who submitted thinks their idea was

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:21.890 
who submitted thinks their idea was
brilliant<00:04:20.260> like<00:04:20.860> mine<00:04:21.070> should<00:04:21.400> have<00:04:21.489> won<00:04:21.640> it

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
brilliant like mine should have won it

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.240 
brilliant like mine should have won it
so<00:04:22.900> it's<00:04:23.020> maybe<00:04:23.140> doing<00:04:23.380> the<00:04:23.530> opposite<00:04:23.860> making

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250 
so it's maybe doing the opposite making

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:27.090 
so it's maybe doing the opposite making
them<00:04:24.340> think<00:04:24.490> it's<00:04:24.640> too<00:04:24.760> easy<00:04:25.800> we<00:04:26.800> could<00:04:26.920> have<00:04:27.070> a

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:27.100 
them think it's too easy we could have a

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.910 
them think it's too easy we could have a
guy<00:04:27.430> over<00:04:27.640> here<00:04:27.970> this<00:04:28.900> is<00:04:29.080> a<00:04:29.110> terrible<00:04:29.500> cartoon

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:29.920 
guy over here this is a terrible cartoon

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:31.230 
guy over here this is a terrible cartoon
we<00:04:30.070> could<00:04:30.220> have<00:04:30.310> a<00:04:30.370> guy<00:04:30.490> over<00:04:30.610> here<00:04:30.820> saying<00:04:31.030> why

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.240 
we could have a guy over here saying why

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.980 
we could have a guy over here saying why
the<00:04:31.300> long<00:04:31.660> face<00:04:33.180> you're<00:04:34.180> laughing<00:04:34.420> you<00:04:34.690> didn't

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:34.990

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:39.390 
the long face you're laughing you didn't
be<00:04:35.080> laughing<00:04:35.410> at<00:04:35.500> that<00:04:35.680> that<00:04:36.430> is<00:04:36.460> a<00:04:36.580> dumb<00:04:36.910> joke
