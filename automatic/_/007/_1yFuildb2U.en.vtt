00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.059
 hello everyone so too in the map 

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.410
 defendants in a point 18 on ps3 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:19.720
 unchecked his to show you this 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:21.520
 after patch at the web bretz level of this 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.140
 pillar then you can wait until the 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.400
 tsunami they're past to be 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.289
 you can do it before 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.240
 remember you could do a watch 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:30.520
 very simple with one on the double jump 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.529
 boost inside this pillar actually it 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:34.149
 was patched is the after patch exists 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:36.219
 since it was bad patch is still a 

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:37.719
 time so it's on the other side there you 

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:39.280
 have an invisible being stumped with the 

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:41.019
 double jump and completing yourself 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.300
 quickly and then then you can 

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:44.579
 actually rich oil and the wall then 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.469
 we will do it first in an external view 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.449
 so double jump and you press 

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:51.670
 circle on your ps3 controller for you 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:53.499
 crouch quickly incident you go 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.629
 to get to the others that it is necessary 

00:00:53.499 --> 00:00:55.959
 arrived here and there you go on the 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:57.609
 left 

00:00:55.959 --> 00:00:58.989
 in fact you go where you will have the 

00:00:57.609 --> 00:01:01.569
 rock on your left you need here 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:03.309
 to announce a little bit and try 

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:05.080
 to rush gently because if 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:06.580
 you go too fast you fall so he 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.130
 must find see the right path 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.900
 to fall inside 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.370
 here it is not the outside to be able to 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.810
 actually be in pillars like 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:17.290
 before to be able to move a little 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:18.670
 360 degrees the shots of course crosses the 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:20.320
 rock wall one could kill the 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:23.460
 enemies and which you see we can 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:26.230
 return without problem in this pillar 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:29.440
 so in the defendant in 1.18 two 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:31.120
 updates on ps3 so that's it 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.610
 now we will put ourselves on the sight 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:35.680
 spectators dauger hers because I 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.480
 I'll ask him to do it again 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.310
 he did for by turns against it 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:41.320
 that we get the hang of it by doing all 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.630
 both to embody one of the two 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:47.110
 that they do so there he will do them 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.730
 kindly at my request to be able to you 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.930
 can you see a little bit about how 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:51.580
 pass as if you were doing it 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.890
 so see this famous invisible ledge 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.600
 here against the pillar we advance a whole 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.460
 little bit going to the left on 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.860
 try to rush flocks a whole 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.940
 little bit softly not too fast and a 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.010
 given moment actually 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:05.680
 do not rush too badly and we'll 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:07.180
 start precisely to fall so he 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.649
 must be controlled when one falls to be 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.969
 inside you see the pillar here 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:12.950
 there we can move a little bit like 

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:14.780
 before and that's it and it's done so 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.280
 here we see this after-patch for 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.980
 go back inside the pillar here 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.480
 in defendants in 1.18 on ps3 I hope 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.160
 that you will have liked it can make you 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.489
 Service in private online I tell you
