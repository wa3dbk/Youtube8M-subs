 steal music and movement here a 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.490
 technicality how to develop number one 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.310
 typicality how do we tear 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:56.800
 this exercise is dancing than 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.420
 can be more 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:01.940
 have time dance half an hour a day and 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:04.160
 regular firstly regularly secondly 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:06.290
 preferably of course more works 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:09.770
 half an hour and 45 minutes just moved under 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:14.740
 press-up music was done by the press already 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:18.340
 good how do you develop number two music 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:18.340
 listen to music and 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:27.170
 cast the picture well for example there is music 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:30.110
 there is a musical pattern necessarily pam 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:33.010
 pam there all the stops punch or 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:38.390
 clap your hands just this knee 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:40.280
 then you can make music three-dimensional 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:43.130
 for example move down lead music same 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:45.620
 and down and up the music went up 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:48.170
 high notes music went down low 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:50.600
 the notes up don't escape nice nice nice 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:54.830
 and all you do is hand movement can 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:57.830
 head on the mountain like any 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:59.960
 part of the body can dance and number three 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:05.780
 drive energy well then train raffia 

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:08.600
 mergi can not them but rather you can but it 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:11.780
 just how you feel the music 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:14.000
 how do you skip through this 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:16.310
 need to show it is impossible 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:20.440
 feel and just keep your head 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:22.850
 fad such that you need to invest yourself 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:24.860
