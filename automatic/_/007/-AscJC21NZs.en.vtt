00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.879
 as far as Morocco is concerned, it is a 

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:11.230
 team that is very very young that we 

00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:13.180
 we'll say do not know we just saw 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:14.920
 some videos on the internet 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:17.080
 they did a tour in France in 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:19.150
 2007 when I think it's this same 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.289
 collective is not bad it's technical 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:21.699
 to 6 against the paraguay 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:23.410
 I think as soon as they defend them 

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:25.779
 played in 2006 to the world champion in 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:28.289
 argentina to buenos aires this is a 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:30.579
 very strong team defensively 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.140
 offensively a team are two 

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:32.920
 triggers and it's guys who can 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.290
 to do very very badly 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.520
 in japan we will say that we know them 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:38.110
 quite well because we met them 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.580
 already we invited them to France on a 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:41.440
 tournament as were at the tournament of 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:44.170
 noisy dry in the Paris region has us 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:47.200
 met twice we also meet 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:50.560
 in December - December 2013 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:53.560
 we invited them to paris for for 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:55.150
 friendlies ended with a 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:57.790
 victory of the France team 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:58.900
 a goal at 0 and a draw we tried 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:01.110
 to work for a year 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:04.299
 several gaming systems 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:06.579
 devices including defensive and 

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:10.390
 offensive to be able to counter sees the 

00:01:06.579 --> 00:01:13.060
 back these teams there and we go there like 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.649
 I also said today it's us 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.810
 who should make the game how will you do 

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:20.560
 the ball and try to go mark if 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:24.490
 you score a goal his 20 points ok if 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:26.859
 you frame the time it's 10 points the 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:29.010
 collective is very very young because 

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:31.020
 that after the games of london we have 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:33.120
 we redid politics and we bet 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.630
 on youth is safe on the mind 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:38.220
 equipped and especially on the collective 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.990
 that's what makes our goals 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.900
 for this world championship we will say 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.940
 that we are going to make a podium this will be 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.440
 this a great first for the team of 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.670
 france who has never made a podium in 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.140
 World's Championships 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.970
 it is true that we have today we are 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.140
 Paralympic vice champion threat is 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.010
 a competition apart we'll let the 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.740
 bigger competition 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:58.170
 but if a major competition also 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.580
 as a most beautiful world champion 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:10.560
 place that had until today is 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:12.270
 fifth place comes the husband that's 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:16.950
 very simple we are european champion in 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:19.410
 2009 European champion 2011 and vice 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.830
 Paralympic champions 2012 so 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.830
 silver medal
