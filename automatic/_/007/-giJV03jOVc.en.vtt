I'm going to show you some evasive

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.730 
I'm going to show you some evasive
footwork<00:00:04.319> for<00:00:04.710> use<00:00:04.980> in<00:00:05.160> boxing<00:00:05.580> or<00:00:05.759> fighting

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:06.740 
footwork for use in boxing or fighting

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:09.860 
footwork for use in boxing or fighting
breaking<00:00:07.740> it<00:00:07.859> down<00:00:08.300> there's<00:00:09.300> two<00:00:09.510> kinds<00:00:09.780> of

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
breaking it down there's two kinds of

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:10.370 
breaking it down there's two kinds of
footwork

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
footwork

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.009 
footwork
this<00:00:10.530> is<00:00:10.620> that<00:00:10.740> a<00:00:10.769> linear<00:00:11.070> footwork<00:00:11.700> or

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:12.019 
this is that a linear footwork or

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:16.760 
this is that a linear footwork or
circular<00:00:13.019> footwork<00:00:13.490> so<00:00:14.490> for<00:00:14.790> example<00:00:15.560> if<00:00:16.560> I'm

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
circular footwork so for example if I'm

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:17.810 
circular footwork so for example if I'm
moving<00:00:17.130> my<00:00:17.250> right<00:00:17.400> foot

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
moving my right foot

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.519 
moving my right foot
that<00:00:17.940> means<00:00:18.119> it's<00:00:18.300> either<00:00:18.510> going<00:00:18.779> here<00:00:19.080> it's

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
that means it's either going here it's

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.689 
that means it's either going here it's
going<00:00:19.770> away<00:00:19.970> okay<00:00:21.050> linear<00:00:22.340> all<00:00:23.340> right<00:00:23.550> I'm

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
going away okay linear all right I'm

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.730 
going away okay linear all right I'm
going<00:00:23.939> on<00:00:24.029> a<00:00:24.060> line<00:00:24.269> or<00:00:24.539> it's<00:00:25.199> pivoting<00:00:25.619> it's

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
going on a line or it's pivoting it's

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:26.450 
going on a line or it's pivoting it's
going<00:00:25.949> around

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
going around

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.169 
going around
it's<00:00:26.789> a<00:00:26.880> pivot<00:00:27.210> pivot<00:00:27.900> pivot<00:00:28.949> so<00:00:29.490> all<00:00:29.820> forward

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
it's a pivot pivot pivot so all forward

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.089 
it's a pivot pivot pivot so all forward
movements<00:00:30.630> either<00:00:30.750> a<00:00:30.929> line<00:00:31.199> or<00:00:31.529> a<00:00:31.560> pivot<00:00:31.980> and

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
movements either a line or a pivot and

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.490 
movements either a line or a pivot and
you<00:00:32.360> decide<00:00:33.360> so<00:00:33.780> if<00:00:33.899> I'm<00:00:34.020> fighting<00:00:34.260> my

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
you decide so if I'm fighting my

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.979 
you decide so if I'm fighting my
opponent<00:00:34.980> I<00:00:35.160> can<00:00:35.820> use<00:00:35.940> a<00:00:35.969> linear<00:00:36.270> foot<00:00:36.600> to<00:00:36.840> go

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
opponent I can use a linear foot to go

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.030 
opponent I can use a linear foot to go
here<00:00:37.430> okay<00:00:38.430> then<00:00:38.910> here<00:00:39.059> to<00:00:39.180> go<00:00:39.329> here<00:00:39.739> maybe<00:00:40.739> to

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
here okay then here to go here maybe to

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.700 
here okay then here to go here maybe to
the<00:00:41.129> side<00:00:41.360> okay<00:00:42.360> to<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.079> back<00:00:43.260> a<00:00:43.290> little<00:00:43.530> bit

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
the side okay to the back a little bit

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.040 
the side okay to the back a little bit
that's<00:00:43.980> a<00:00:44.129> little<00:00:44.280> bit<00:00:44.399> of<00:00:44.489> a<00:00:44.550> pivot<00:00:44.850> okay<00:00:45.510> so<00:00:46.020> I

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
that's a little bit of a pivot okay so I

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.350 
that's a little bit of a pivot okay so I
can<00:00:46.320> use<00:00:46.440> a<00:00:46.469> linear<00:00:46.829> movement<00:00:47.039> to<00:00:47.309> get<00:00:47.460> away<00:00:47.550> to

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
can use a linear movement to get away to

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.720 
can use a linear movement to get away to
get<00:00:48.480> away<00:00:48.600> I'll<00:00:49.289> show<00:00:49.469> you<00:00:49.530> from<00:00:49.739> behind<00:00:49.950> I'm

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
get away I'll show you from behind I'm

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.000 
get away I'll show you from behind I'm
going<00:00:50.940> out<00:00:51.180> here<00:00:51.539> I'm<00:00:51.750> going<00:00:51.960> back<00:00:52.199> here<00:00:52.500> I'm

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
going out here I'm going back here I'm

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:53.959 
going out here I'm going back here I'm
going<00:00:53.219> out<00:00:53.340> at<00:00:53.520> an<00:00:53.610> angle

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
going out at an angle

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.920 
going out at an angle
okay<00:00:54.840> or<00:00:55.079> I<00:00:55.620> can<00:00:55.920> escape<00:00:56.129> with<00:00:56.430> a<00:00:56.550> pivot<00:00:56.930> boom

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
okay or I can escape with a pivot boom

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.630 
okay or I can escape with a pivot boom
there's<00:00:58.590> only<00:00:58.680> two<00:00:58.829> ways<00:00:58.949> a<00:00:59.070> pivot<00:00:59.340> I<00:00:59.430> think

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
there's only two ways a pivot I think

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.670 
there's only two ways a pivot I think
I'm<00:00:59.730> going<00:00:59.910> clockwise<00:01:00.570> or<00:01:00.960> I'm<00:01:01.379> going

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
I'm going clockwise or I'm going

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.490 
I'm going clockwise or I'm going
counterclockwise<00:01:02.149> you<00:01:03.149> will<00:01:03.300> find<00:01:03.570> which<00:01:04.290> one

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
counterclockwise you will find which one

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.200 
counterclockwise you will find which one
is<00:01:04.619> easier<00:01:04.769> depending<00:01:05.430> on<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.640> situation

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
is easier depending on the situation

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.910 
is easier depending on the situation
you're<00:01:06.390> in<00:01:06.450> and<00:01:06.810> where<00:01:07.290> your<00:01:07.439> head<00:01:07.619> and<00:01:07.799> body

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
you're in and where your head and body

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.149 
you're in and where your head and body
is<00:01:08.220> which<00:01:08.549> one<00:01:08.729> is<00:01:08.850> easier<00:01:09.409> now<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:11.130> real

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
is which one is easier now the real

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.570 
is which one is easier now the real
trick<00:01:12.060> to<00:01:12.710> evasive<00:01:13.710> footwork<00:01:14.100> is<00:01:14.310> when<00:01:14.490> you

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
trick to evasive footwork is when you

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.940 
trick to evasive footwork is when you
start<00:01:14.850> to<00:01:14.939> put<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.240> two<00:01:15.420> together<00:01:15.619> so<00:01:16.619> you<00:01:16.710> can

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
start to put the two together so you can

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.490 
start to put the two together so you can
either<00:01:17.070> go<00:01:17.369> lie<00:01:18.030> and<00:01:18.330> then<00:01:18.450> pivot<00:01:18.720> or<00:01:18.990> pivot

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
either go lie and then pivot or pivot

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.830 
either go lie and then pivot or pivot
and<00:01:19.650> then<00:01:19.830> line<00:01:20.070> I'll<00:01:20.970> show<00:01:21.270> you<00:01:21.330> what<00:01:21.570> I<00:01:21.600> mean

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
and then line I'll show you what I mean

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:28.399 
and then line I'll show you what I mean
let's<00:01:22.710> say<00:01:23.479> lion<00:01:24.479> pivot<00:01:25.320> okay<00:01:26.570> right<00:01:27.570> here<00:01:27.780> by

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
let's say lion pivot okay right here by

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.649 
let's say lion pivot okay right here by
if<00:01:29.450> okay

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
if okay

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.990 
if okay
I<00:01:30.689> can<00:01:31.140> even<00:01:31.320> go<00:01:31.409> forward<00:01:31.860> lying<00:01:32.490> under<00:01:32.970> a

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
I can even go forward lying under a

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.410 
I can even go forward lying under a
shoulder<00:01:33.390> pivot<00:01:33.750> and<00:01:33.900> I'm<00:01:34.350> out<00:01:34.670> okay<00:01:35.670> so<00:01:36.180> line

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
shoulder pivot and I'm out okay so line

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.679 
shoulder pivot and I'm out okay so line
in<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.689> pivot<00:01:37.020> line<00:01:37.500> pivot

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:38.689 
in the pivot line pivot

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:43.550 
in the pivot line pivot
okay<00:01:39.920> or<00:01:40.920> he's<00:01:41.670> coming<00:01:41.880> in<00:01:42.150> boom<00:01:42.570> and<00:01:42.869> him

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
okay or he's coming in boom and him

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.469 
okay or he's coming in boom and him
around<00:01:43.829> him<00:01:44.009> put<00:01:44.280> him<00:01:44.399> in<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.579> corner<00:01:44.790> fired

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
around him put him in the corner fired

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.840 
around him put him in the corner fired
shot<00:01:45.780> that's<00:01:46.590> lying<00:01:46.890> in<00:01:47.009> the<00:01:47.070> period<00:01:47.399> I<00:01:47.520> can<00:01:47.729> do

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
shot that's lying in the period I can do

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.819 
shot that's lying in the period I can do
it<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:48.030> other<00:01:48.060> way<00:01:48.240> around<00:01:48.600> -<00:01:48.780> I<00:01:48.990> can<00:01:49.500> fit<00:01:49.740> it

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
it the other way around - I can fit it

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.370 
it the other way around - I can fit it
in<00:01:49.950> that<00:01:50.130> line<00:01:50.340> boom<00:01:51.360> pivot<00:01:51.750> under<00:01:51.990> him<00:01:52.170> and

in that line boom pivot under him and
step<00:01:52.950> away<00:01:53.299> okay<00:01:54.299> before<00:01:54.560> he<00:01:55.560> stole<00:01:55.740> it<00:01:55.920> up
