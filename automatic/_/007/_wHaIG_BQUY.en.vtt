 would have to enter it here I am in 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.799
 no guild 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.990
 That's why I do not do that and here 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:31.380
 you can choose which games you like 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.720
 you've already played that makes you final 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.740
 I did not play fantasy 11 something 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.280
 scary also not played too 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.990
 not played 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.250
 yes I have to say many of these 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.689
 player I did not play 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.439
 not bings chance now 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.640
 I must say 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.130
 of course I have world of warcraft 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.320
 played without question by the way world of 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.149
 warcraft is doing a very complete 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.060
 great last-rich for fixed play 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.770
 must you necessarily all times still 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.210
 played lord of the rings online wise 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.290
 which is also incredibly short on the way 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.280
 bad game 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.870
 I have to be time and it was good 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.520
 which he has the short games you 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.810
 Of course, I already played 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.070
 not played the whole series is 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.620
 completely passed me by 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.300
 I'm all the more curious that 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:13.320
 to be able to play online now 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:15.240
 and here is please please me mmo goes 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.770
 I have already tested there 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.240
 I am and I have not played any 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.130
 I am a closed beta of 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:24.900
 allods online and so on but by 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:27.060
 a mg I'm not sick select io 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.800
 play styles yes I'm rather solo 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.110
 especially on the way here for these let's 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.750
 play and then more likely to quest 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:36.060
 interested in or roleplaying or 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:39.150
 the story maybe here too 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:42.240
 you just become your styles yours 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.840
 insert preferences and now it works 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.260
 continue 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:49.080
 so now you have to know more complicated and 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:52.050
 Although there is a system here 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.610
 Information that we copy here purely 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.590
 Okay, how are we going to get here 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.360
 declared click of the state praised 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.130
 windows button in debates left off your 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.230
 screen we get the bottom left 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:03.390
 on our city ledge on the 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:07.890
 start button and enter in programs 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:17.820
 files examine dx de ag 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:20.160
 okay we do that and go for it and 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:27.590
 look what happens there aha there we have 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:27.590
 every each and every amount of information 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:34.110
 clicked essay of information button 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:36.320
 we need the water problems we 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:38.940
 do not have any problems 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:41.130
 we can do it both 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:44.400
 save information as soon as it 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:45.430
 which is probably ready and need 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.230
 then 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:50.650
 probably this information the 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.689
 we have saved there indicate that 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:52.930
 Now we'll do all the information 

00:03:51.689 --> 00:03:57.430
 to save 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:59.069
 on the desktop and then we can do that 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.969
 I think quit 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:02.920
 then we should actually if we 

00:04:00.969 --> 00:04:04.000
 Now we have the search again 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.469
 file on the desktop 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.269
 my goodness these are ours 

00:04:05.469 --> 00:04:11.680
 Everything is clear 

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:14.650
 we'll copy that in here now and me 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:16.840
 hope that was enough 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.639
 you see is a bit more complicated 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.560
 the first time that i did it that way 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:21.430
 something for a beta registration at all 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.400
 had to do 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:27.639
 and well let's see if that works 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:29.590
 so now you should virtually apply 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:32.229
 Why do you just write as beta 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:35.259
 tester in question is well I could 

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:37.680
 Now, I'm basically writing that 

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:37.680
 make 

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:50.759
 let's play videos from the games magazine 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:55.930
 end games youtube channel 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:57.669
 that's actually the reason 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:59.530
 Of course I want to participate in the beta 

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:01.270
 because then I'll let you in with nice 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:02.650
 can provide play 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:04.510
 and maybe I can still be there 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:07.440
 that i also act as editor in chief 

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:07.440
 could write 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:27.159
 maybe it was also very good 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:28.360
 if a bit says that you 're real 

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:29.710
 it's up to you to play this game 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:33.669
 that will also write again now 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:37.259
 am really excited to play this game and 

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:38.860
 then again perhaps a little 

00:05:37.259 --> 00:05:42.400
 conclusion at the front 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:44.050
 so here you can choose if the 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.710
 also want to be informed by 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:46.690
 e mail 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:49.249
 if there is anything new first 

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:51.739
 online for a short time and ever for 

00:05:49.249 --> 00:05:53.869
 on new games and let's see 

00:05:51.739 --> 00:05:56.899
 that we also click here 

00:05:53.869 --> 00:05:58.699
 because of course we agree 

00:05:56.899 --> 00:06:00.529
 so now we have a captcha here 

00:05:58.699 --> 00:06:01.639
 Enter code you may hate that 

00:06:00.529 --> 00:06:03.319
 just like me, I can do that sometimes 

00:06:01.639 --> 00:06:07.159
 I do not read but I think that is 

00:06:03.319 --> 00:06:11.899
 Now, relatively simply, we do that 

00:06:07.159 --> 00:06:16.549
 so and yes I think I hope that 

00:06:11.899 --> 00:06:18.109
 Now it's enough to see where it is 

00:06:16.549 --> 00:06:19.819
 Now it has to go now 

00:06:18.109 --> 00:06:23.209
 actually come a button 

00:06:19.819 --> 00:06:25.129
 if the button was not there but he was 

00:06:23.209 --> 00:06:27.679
 invisible so you have to be in the 

00:06:25.129 --> 00:06:30.169
 dark black hole under the 

00:06:27.679 --> 00:06:32.089
 Click captcha code and then you have 

00:06:30.169 --> 00:06:34.519
 you have mediated your application 

00:06:32.089 --> 00:06:36.139
 written and let's hope that we 

00:06:34.519 --> 00:06:38.089
 to be taken here as 

00:06:36.139 --> 00:06:39.799
 arrested because I'm with you 

00:06:38.089 --> 00:06:41.239
 let's play is for youtube supply 

00:06:39.799 --> 00:06:43.279
 I wish you much luck 

00:06:41.239 --> 00:06:45.919
 for your applications and let's hope 

00:06:43.279 --> 00:06:48.769
 that we'll soon be together as well so scrolls 

00:06:45.919 --> 00:06:51.429
 playing online can learn from
