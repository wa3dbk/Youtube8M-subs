00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.190
 comrades who are already ready to 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.230
 tell us what happens at this time in 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.639
 Colombia we started with reports from the 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.740
 family tragedy this in the south of 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.240
 Bogota for the death of two people 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.309
 they investigate if it was for a gas leak 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.540
 propane or by the smoke from burning the 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.430
 leaves of the tamales that were 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:21.619
 heating in the place is 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.619
 red hector that says the bull family 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:26.449
 Well, there is great sadness 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:28.009
 part of the relatives to meet 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:30.470
 with this news it turns out that they 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:32.780
 they thought that the couple had left 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.940
 vacation to rest a few days and at no 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.920
 have news arrived here to this 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.890
 home just that you see my 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:42.019
 back and that's when they find the 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.629
 terrible news this terrible event 

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:46.790
 find the two dead people 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:48.860
 apparently there are two hypotheses that 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.900
 the authorities are handling a 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:53.570
 should because of one gas leak and the other 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:55.520
 because the couple sold tamales them 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.859
 they say and the family and the neighbors said 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.680
 that they used to place the 

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:02.989
 pots in the evening hours and then they left 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:06.080
 at dawn to sell them just the 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:09.380
 couple placed these pots to cook the 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:12.020
 tamales and they went to sleep product 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.460
 of this because apparently they died this 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.650
 is the report 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:18.020
 after calling several times and not 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:20.180
 get response from his brother joana 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.729
 He came to this house to look for his relative 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:25.700
 and he found a painful scene 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:28.850
 I thought he was traveling it turns out that 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:32.299
 they were dead 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:35.330
 they got intoxicated they left those leaves I do not know 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:37.610
 how come I do not understand the doors and 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:39.350
 windows were closed so 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.360
 johanna had to seek help from a 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.820
 neighbor to know what had happened with 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.820
 his brother and sister-in-law who sold 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.590
 tamales in the sector of corabastos 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:51.380
 we open we broke the glass and when 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:54.350
 we enter everything is everything is a magician all 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.740
 inside and they are my little brother 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:59.810
 thrown out and my sister-in-law on top of the bed 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:03.740
 we arrived and turned off the keys 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.970
 del del sil in beets according to the 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.250
 first investigations of the 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:09.950
 authorities the couple died apparently 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.600
 by inhaling propane gas and the 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.940
 smoke from the leaves of the tamales that 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.819
 they were cooking and they burned what 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.560
 the 105 to them was what burned 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:19.970
 humanan tamales burned leaves 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.560
 inside the pot and that generated a lot 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.240
 smoke from the day be a night the 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.720
 they put 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:28.670
 cooking in cooking and it is presumed that 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.500
 to this day the inhabitants of the 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.540
 sector said that they felt a 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.630
 strong burnt smell but never 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.940
 they imagined what happened in the smell of 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:40.300
 smoke 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:42.460
 burned like grass like we did not know to 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.050
 what did all of these smell 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:46.030
 forgotten days we did not know where 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:48.460
 Heaven would be the tragic outcome 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:50.620
 alerted the community in front of the 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:53.800
 use of gas to prevent recurrence 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.870
 stories like this 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.760
 then see is that precisely the 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.250
 technicians of the gas to which we have 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.980
 consulted say that frequently the 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:05.350
 people place something on the stove and 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.630
 they suddenly leave the store or even 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:10.180
 they go to the bathroom to shower and then there 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.860
 a tragedy may occur as is the 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.240
 that we are recording here in the yard 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.430
 nice that's the information by the 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:17.800
 moment hector red news snail 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:20.260
 Hector and that's what the 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.970
 firefighters assure that a pot to maximum 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.490
 temperature is one of the most dangerous 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:26.560
 great for a person's life the 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:28.540
 burning of this pot produces emissions of 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.610
 carbon monoxide that could cause 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.650
 death in a matter of hours on the 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:35.080
 theme or jacobo castellano sent us the 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:37.840
 next report 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:40.420
 we have at this moment the tamale that 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.880
 let's put it to heat in water in 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:45.280
 a pot in what they commonly call 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.140
 like a reverberant lieutenant welcome to 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:50.500
 snail news that happens from 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:53.110
 this moment with this cooking if one is 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:54.820
 forget that he has a tamale cooking 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:56.170
 in good water the first thing that can happen 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:59.050
 at this moment is that the gases 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:00.280
 obviously by the same friction by the 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:02.110
 same heat that is being generated 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.780
 precisely in this in this utensil 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:07.060
 that simply evaporate what is the 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:09.100
 water in that moment when it evaporates 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.930
 totally the water that is where it started 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:14.020
 there the danger is it starts to burn 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:16.390
 this issue of this this banana leaf and 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:19.239
 can generate a harmful co2 

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:22.360
 for the famous sweet death have passed 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:23.350
 some minutes already the pot was left without 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.260
 Water 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:28.960
 the tamale has begun to burn 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:30.850
 basically the sheet and you see smoke coming out 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.670
 from the pot we see that the burner also 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:35.710
 this maximum at room temperature 

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:37.750
 here the production begins 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:39.730
 carbon monoxide yes sir in that 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:41.830
 moment a combustion has already started 

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:45.160
 obviously if the 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:47.260
 hydrogen molecules and therefore already 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:48.250
 begins to have a spread of co2 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:51.850
 lieutenant what are the recommendations 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:55.150
 not to die on account of death 

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:57.460
 sweet with an oblivion of a pot over 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:05:02.740
 from a corner of the kitchen first thing 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:04.420
 obviously it 's putting out the second fire 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:07.360
 place enough water 

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:10.150
 so do not allow yourself precisely 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:12.430
 combustion and third is always a 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:15.190
 adult close lieutenant thank you very much 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:17.170
 for being in news snail is this the 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:18.910
 abandoning the pots with food in 

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:22.120
 its interior that dry practically 

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:24.730
 in the kitchen is a very high risk and a 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:27.580
 fire generator like few in
