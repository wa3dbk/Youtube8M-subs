00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
and this is just a lull the yeah

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.200 
and this is just a lull the yeah
will-o'-wisp<00:02:14.920> so<00:02:15.250> I<00:02:15.280> can<00:02:15.610> do<00:02:15.700> in<00:02:15.820> a<00:02:15.880> Hallam<00:02:16.090> to

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.210 
will-o'-wisp so I can do in a Hallam to

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:17.910 
will-o'-wisp so I can do in a Hallam to
him<00:02:16.330> but<00:02:16.420> he<00:02:16.540> does<00:02:16.660> Thunderbolts<00:02:17.290> so<00:02:17.620> I<00:02:17.650> didn't

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
him but he does Thunderbolts so I didn't

know<00:02:18.010> that<00:02:18.040> squeezing<00:02:18.400> a<00:02:18.460> thunderbolt<00:02:18.970> anyway

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
know that squeezing a thunderbolt anyway

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.780 
know that squeezing a thunderbolt anyway
he<00:02:20.530> gets<00:02:20.710> a<00:02:20.770> thunderbolt<00:02:21.190> in<00:02:21.250> my<00:02:21.340> hand<00:02:21.640> doom

he gets a thunderbolt in my hand doom

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.490 
he gets a thunderbolt in my hand doom
and<00:02:22.000> that's<00:02:22.120> rather<00:02:22.330> sad<00:02:22.720> and<00:02:22.990> I'm<00:02:23.350> going<00:02:23.470> to

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
and that's rather sad and I'm going to

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.020 
and that's rather sad and I'm going to
predict<00:02:23.800> the<00:02:23.830> switch<00:02:24.100> here<00:02:24.340> and<00:02:24.520> to<00:02:24.610> star<00:02:24.850> me

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
predict the switch here and to star me

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.640 
predict the switch here and to star me
and<00:02:25.180> go<00:02:25.300> dark<00:02:25.600> pulse<00:02:25.840> and<00:02:26.080> that's<00:02:26.230> a<00:02:26.290> pretty

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
and go dark pulse and that's a pretty

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.350 
and go dark pulse and that's a pretty
awesome<00:02:26.890> prediction<00:02:27.520> because<00:02:27.700> I<00:02:27.850> take<00:02:28.180> down

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
awesome prediction because I take down

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:29.880 
awesome prediction because I take down
the<00:02:28.510> star<00:02:28.720> me<00:02:28.900> and<00:02:29.110> that's<00:02:29.380> really<00:02:29.650> awesome

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
the star me and that's really awesome

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:31.470 
the star me and that's really awesome
because<00:02:30.190> Darma<00:02:30.700> can<00:02:30.730> be<00:02:31.000> really<00:02:31.300> annoying

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
because Darma can be really annoying
