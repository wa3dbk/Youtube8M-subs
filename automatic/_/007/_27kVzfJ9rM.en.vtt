and<00:00:05.640> it's<00:00:05.850> a<00:00:05.970> silent<00:00:06.150> ROM<00:00:06.450> which<00:00:06.480> is<00:00:06.779> based<00:00:07.049> off

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
and it's a silent ROM which is based off

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.459 
and it's a silent ROM which is based off
cm10<00:00:07.799> so<00:00:08.610> this<00:00:08.760> is<00:00:08.790> a<00:00:08.880> very<00:00:09.059> clean<00:00:09.510> android<00:00:10.170> and

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
cm10 so this is a very clean android and

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.640 
cm10 so this is a very clean android and
fact<00:00:10.830> it's<00:00:11.340> so<00:00:11.370> clean<00:00:11.730> it<00:00:12.000> is<00:00:12.150> i<00:00:12.509> think<00:00:13.410> the

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
fact it's so clean it is i think the

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.650 
fact it's so clean it is i think the
moment<00:00:13.889> the<00:00:13.950> smallest<00:00:14.370> custom<00:00:15.000> rom<00:00:15.179> available

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
moment the smallest custom rom available

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.090 
moment the smallest custom rom available
which<00:00:15.960> size<00:00:16.500> is<00:00:17.810> 116<00:00:18.810> megabytes<00:00:19.260> so<00:00:19.949> that

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
which size is 116 megabytes so that

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.980 
which size is 116 megabytes so that
means<00:00:20.400> it's<00:00:20.730> going<00:00:20.880> to<00:00:21.029> be<00:00:21.119> very<00:00:21.150> very<00:00:21.660> smooth

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
means it's going to be very very smooth

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:36.740 
means it's going to be very very smooth

took we're going to flesh now this won't
take<00:02:36.600> very<00:02:36.720> long<00:02:36.959> as<00:02:37.260> I<00:02:37.860> said<00:02:38.100> it's<00:02:38.250> only<00:02:38.450> 114

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
take very long as I said it's only 114

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:40.790 
take very long as I said it's only 114
megabytes<00:02:39.900> so<00:02:40.290> that's<00:02:40.470> going<00:02:40.590> to<00:02:40.650> be<00:02:40.739> very

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
megabytes so that's going to be very

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.640 
megabytes so that's going to be very
very<00:02:41.280> quick<00:02:41.519> in<00:02:41.640> flashing<00:02:42.440> once<00:02:43.440> it's

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
very quick in flashing once it's

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.890 
very quick in flashing once it's
completed<00:02:44.040> we<00:02:44.430> are<00:02:44.760> then<00:02:45.090> going<00:02:45.209> to<00:02:45.510> go<00:02:45.630> and

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
completed we are then going to go and

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.590 
completed we are then going to go and
flesh<00:02:46.470> google<00:02:47.190> apps<00:02:47.340> now<00:02:48.209> if<00:02:48.299> you<00:02:48.390> don't<00:02:48.510> want

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
flesh google apps now if you don't want

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.060 
flesh google apps now if you don't want
that<00:02:48.870> that's<00:02:49.320> fine<00:02:49.530> you<00:02:49.650> don't<00:02:49.680> have<00:02:49.830> to

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
that that's fine you don't have to

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:51.680 
that that's fine you don't have to
install<00:02:50.430> google<00:02:50.760> apps<00:02:50.910> you<00:02:51.090> can<00:02:51.150> just<00:02:51.420> go<00:02:51.600> on

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
install google apps you can just go on

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.870 
install google apps you can just go on
and<00:02:51.780> reboot<00:02:52.110> your<00:02:52.140> device<00:02:52.260> as<00:02:52.739> is<00:02:52.950> but<00:02:53.760> that

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
and reboot your device as is but that

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.340 
and reboot your device as is but that
means<00:02:53.910> you<00:02:54.150> won't<00:02:54.269> have<00:02:54.420> the<00:02:54.630> Play<00:02:54.810> Store<00:02:54.870> or

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
means you won't have the Play Store or

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:59.840 
means you won't have the Play Store or
any<00:02:56.340> other<00:02:56.549> Google<00:02:56.850> applications<00:02:58.790> okay<00:02:59.790> so

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
any other Google applications okay so

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:01.580 
any other Google applications okay so
let's<00:03:00.150> have<00:03:00.239> a<00:03:00.330> look<00:03:00.450> at<00:03:00.540> the<00:03:00.750> system<00:03:01.320> itself

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
let's have a look at the system itself

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.509 
let's have a look at the system itself
now<00:03:02.250> once<00:03:02.430> you<00:03:02.519> build<00:03:02.700> up<00:03:02.970> you<00:03:03.299> can<00:03:03.540> import

00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:04.519 
now once you build up you can import

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:07.220 
now once you build up you can import
settings<00:03:05.519> from<00:03:05.790> other<00:03:05.970> launchers<00:03:06.180> are<00:03:06.930> using

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
settings from other launchers are using

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:08.600 
settings from other launchers are using
TouchWiz<00:03:07.739> so<00:03:07.920> that's<00:03:08.070> not<00:03:08.250> going<00:03:08.370> to<00:03:08.459> work<00:03:08.489> for

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
TouchWiz so that's not going to work for

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.920 
TouchWiz so that's not going to work for
me<00:03:08.760> and<00:03:09.320> let<00:03:10.320> me<00:03:10.410> just<00:03:11.390> move<00:03:12.390> some<00:03:12.600> icons

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
me and let me just move some icons

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.670 
me and let me just move some icons
around<00:03:13.079> okay<00:03:13.890> so<00:03:13.950> this<00:03:14.790> is<00:03:15.000> running<00:03:15.680> nova

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
around okay so this is running nova

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.020 
around okay so this is running nova
launcher<00:03:16.769> so<00:03:17.160> you<00:03:17.220> can<00:03:17.370> see<00:03:17.489> can<00:03:17.700> create

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
launcher so you can see can create

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.620 
launcher so you can see can create
folders<00:03:18.510> I<00:03:19.670> just<00:03:20.670> want<00:03:20.850> to<00:03:20.910> show<00:03:21.299> you<00:03:21.360> how

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
folders I just want to show you how

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:25.870 
folders I just want to show you how
smooth<00:03:22.850> editing<00:03:24.049> deleting<00:03:25.049> and<00:03:25.290> moving<00:03:25.620> these

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
smooth editing deleting and moving these

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.569 
smooth editing deleting and moving these
application<00:03:26.880> icons<00:03:27.299> around<00:03:27.950> right<00:03:28.950> so<00:03:29.220> I'm

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:29.579 
application icons around right so I'm

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:35.210 
application icons around right so I'm
now<00:03:30.390> going<00:03:30.600> to<00:03:30.660> go<00:03:30.840> into<00:03:32.420> my<00:03:33.420> widgets<00:03:34.140> and<00:03:34.350> put

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
now going to go into my widgets and put

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.780 
now going to go into my widgets and put
a<00:03:35.250> couple<00:03:35.459> of<00:03:35.579> widgets<00:03:35.820> in<00:03:37.100> that<00:03:38.100> is<00:03:38.250> you<00:03:38.519> can

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
a couple of widgets in that is you can

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.729 
a couple of widgets in that is you can
probably<00:03:38.970> see<00:03:39.180> that<00:03:39.329> the<00:03:39.930> experience<00:03:40.440> is<00:03:40.560> very

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
probably see that the experience is very

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:43.460 
probably see that the experience is very
smooth<00:03:41.160> and<00:03:41.400> this<00:03:42.239> is<00:03:42.390> because<00:03:42.750> it<00:03:43.110> doesn't

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
smooth and this is because it doesn't

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.440 
smooth and this is because it doesn't
have<00:03:43.500> any<00:03:43.739> touch<00:03:44.010> was<00:03:44.340> applications<00:03:45.269> or

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
have any touch was applications or

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:48.949 
have any touch was applications or
Samsung<00:03:45.870> applications<00:03:46.440> like<00:03:46.739> its<00:03:47.270> note<00:03:48.270> it's

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
Samsung applications like its note it's

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:50.230 
Samsung applications like its note it's
calendar

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:50.240 
calendar

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:53.610 
calendar
and<00:03:50.330> so<00:03:51.170> it's<00:03:51.920> a<00:03:52.040> very<00:03:52.070> clean<00:03:52.760> experiences

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
and so it's a very clean experiences

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.110 
and so it's a very clean experiences
probably<00:03:54.620> the<00:03:54.770> closest<00:03:55.670> you're<00:03:55.790> going<00:03:55.940> to<00:03:56.030> get

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
probably the closest you're going to get

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.970 
probably the closest you're going to get
to<00:03:56.300> have<00:03:56.420> any<00:03:56.570> nexus<00:03:56.900> for<00:03:57.230> operating<00:03:57.650> system

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
to have any nexus for operating system

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:01.120 
to have any nexus for operating system
on<00:03:58.130> your<00:03:58.160> Galaxy<00:03:58.640> Note<00:03:59.740> okay<00:04:00.740> so<00:04:00.800> these<00:04:00.980> are

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:01.130 
on your Galaxy Note okay so these are

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:03.970 
on your Galaxy Note okay so these are
not<00:04:01.250> a<00:04:01.460> widget<00:04:02.300> and<00:04:02.930> we<00:04:03.080> can<00:04:03.230> see<00:04:03.440> that<00:04:03.650> it's<00:04:03.890> a

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:03.980 
not a widget and we can see that it's a

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:07.870 
not a widget and we can see that it's a
very<00:04:04.160> small<00:04:04.370> indeed<00:04:06.130> this<00:04:07.130> probably<00:04:07.490> would<00:04:07.670> be

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:07.880 
very small indeed this probably would be

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.290 
very small indeed this probably would be
my<00:04:08.770> my<00:04:09.770> choice<00:04:10.010> of<00:04:10.130> ROM<00:04:10.370> if<00:04:10.580> I<00:04:10.760> wasn't<00:04:11.120> going<00:04:11.240> to

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:11.300 
my my choice of ROM if I wasn't going to

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:13.570 
my my choice of ROM if I wasn't going to
use<00:04:11.420> my<00:04:11.450> Easter<00:04:11.810> night<00:04:11.930> very<00:04:12.260> often<00:04:12.560> so<00:04:13.340> if

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:13.580 
use my Easter night very often so if

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:15.670 
use my Easter night very often so if
that's<00:04:13.970> for<00:04:14.240> you<00:04:14.390> if<00:04:14.960> you're<00:04:15.110> not<00:04:15.230> going<00:04:15.440> to<00:04:15.500> be

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 
that's for you if you're not going to be

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.530 
that's for you if you're not going to be
much<00:04:15.890> of<00:04:15.950> a<00:04:16.160> nice<00:04:16.310> note<00:04:16.520> user<00:04:16.790> or<00:04:17.060> you're<00:04:17.239> not<00:04:17.390> a

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:17.540 
much of a nice note user or you're not a

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:20.020 
much of a nice note user or you're not a
nice<00:04:17.690> night<00:04:17.930> user<00:04:18.140> then<00:04:18.770> i<00:04:19.280> would<00:04:19.580> recommend

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:21.730 
you download this one is very very quick

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:25.720 
you download this one is very very quick
I<00:04:23.230> don't<00:04:24.230> usually<00:04:24.410> compare<00:04:24.980> roms<00:04:25.250> and<00:04:25.520> say

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:25.730 
I don't usually compare roms and say

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:28.690 
I don't usually compare roms and say
which<00:04:25.910> is<00:04:26.060> the<00:04:26.180> best<00:04:26.950> but<00:04:27.950> if<00:04:28.250> there<00:04:28.520> was<00:04:28.670> a

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:28.700 
which is the best but if there was a

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:30.610 
which is the best but if there was a
category<00:04:29.060> then<00:04:29.420> this<00:04:29.600> run<00:04:30.050> would<00:04:30.260> certainly

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:30.620 
category then this run would certainly

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:33.730 
category then this run would certainly
be<00:04:30.860> up<00:04:31.010> in<00:04:31.160> the<00:04:31.250> top<00:04:31.460> type<00:04:31.940> five<00:04:32.210> runs<00:04:32.740> I'm

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:33.740 
be up in the top type five runs I'm

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:35.740 
be up in the top type five runs I'm
going<00:04:33.890> to<00:04:33.980> roll<00:04:34.130> this<00:04:34.160> and<00:04:35.060> use<00:04:35.390> it<00:04:35.420> as<00:04:35.570> my
