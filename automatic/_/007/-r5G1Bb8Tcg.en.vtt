00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
little section it's a little bit

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.680 
little section it's a little bit
difficult<00:00:46.320> to<00:00:46.770> see<00:00:47.010> but<00:00:47.399> I've<00:00:47.670> airbrushed<00:00:48.420> a

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
difficult to see but I've airbrushed a

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.590 
difficult to see but I've airbrushed a

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
but I'm using it as a guide to be able

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.209 
but I'm using it as a guide to be able
to<00:00:59.100> pipe<00:00:59.550> my<00:01:00.140> intricate<00:01:01.140> design<00:01:01.559> that<00:01:01.590> I<00:01:01.829> want

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
to pipe my intricate design that I want

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.429 
to pipe my intricate design that I want
there<00:01:02.550> just<00:01:02.789> to<00:01:02.969> repeat<00:01:03.390> it<00:01:03.600> and<00:01:03.629> have<00:01:04.049> it<00:01:04.260> all

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
there just to repeat it and have it all

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.160
