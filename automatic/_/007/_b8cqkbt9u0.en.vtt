00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
let's look at a possible topic sentence

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.290 
let's look at a possible topic sentence
as<00:00:37.079> we<00:00:37.200> can<00:00:37.380> write<00:00:37.590> so<00:00:38.399> first<00:00:38.700> we<00:00:38.850> start<00:00:38.879> what

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
as we can write so first we start what

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.290 
as we can write so first we start what
is<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.600> paragraph<00:00:40.020> about<00:00:40.710> it's<00:00:41.579> about<00:00:41.700> Amos

and<00:00:42.450> Kevin<00:00:43.100> and<00:00:44.100> then<00:00:45.000> we<00:00:45.420> focus<00:00:45.660> on<00:00:45.960> what<00:00:46.079> is

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
and Kevin and then we focus on what is

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.260 
and Kevin and then we focus on what is
the<00:00:46.379> important<00:00:46.860> difference<00:00:47.340> between<00:00:47.430> Amos

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
and Kevin and let's say it's the

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.729 
and Kevin and let's say it's the
approach<00:00:51.690> to<00:00:52.020> life<00:00:53.090> so<00:00:54.090> one<00:00:54.510> possible<00:00:55.320> topic

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
approach to life so one possible topic

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.010

let's<00:01:12.119> focus<00:01:12.390> on<00:01:12.750> developing<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.470> paragraph

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
let's focus on developing the paragraph

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.080 
let's focus on developing the paragraph
but<00:01:14.340> since<00:01:14.970> we<00:01:15.150> have<00:01:15.330> a<00:01:15.360> topic<00:01:15.900> sentence

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
but since we have a topic sentence

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.870 
but since we have a topic sentence
again<00:01:18.090> we<00:01:18.240> go<00:01:18.390> back<00:01:18.420> to<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:19.560> qualities<00:01:20.310> of<00:01:20.340> the

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
again we go back to the qualities of the

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.980 
again we go back to the qualities of the
two<00:01:21.119> men<00:01:21.420> and<00:01:22.400> we<00:01:23.400> see<00:01:23.640> these<00:01:23.880> three<00:01:24.659> areas

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
two men and we see these three areas

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.850 
two men and we see these three areas
where<00:01:25.350> they<00:01:25.530> contrast<00:01:27.380> now<00:01:28.380> when<00:01:28.590> we<00:01:28.710> do

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
where they contrast now when we do

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.249 
where they contrast now when we do
contrast<00:01:29.790> we<00:01:30.000> have<00:01:30.030> to<00:01:30.360> work<00:01:30.570> with<00:01:30.780> signal

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
contrast we have to work with signal

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.440 
contrast we have to work with signal
words<00:01:31.500> and<00:01:32.310> some<00:01:32.640> of<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:32.820> signal<00:01:33.240> words<00:01:33.420> are

contrast we have two possible types of

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.620 
contrast we have two possible types of
organization<00:03:02.950> so<00:03:03.760> let's<00:03:04.000> look<00:03:04.150> at<00:03:04.300> the<00:03:04.420> first

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:04.630
