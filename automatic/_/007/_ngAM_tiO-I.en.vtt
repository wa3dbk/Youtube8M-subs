I've<00:02:04.710> noticed<00:02:05.070> compared<00:02:05.369> to<00:02:05.490> xbox<00:02:05.729> is<00:02:06.030> that

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
I've noticed compared to xbox is that

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.830 
I've noticed compared to xbox is that
you<00:02:06.810> know<00:02:06.930> when<00:02:07.049> you<00:02:07.110> play<00:02:07.290> domination<00:02:07.770> on<00:02:08.840> and
