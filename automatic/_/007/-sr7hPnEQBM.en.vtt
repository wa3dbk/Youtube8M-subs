00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.030
 Hmm 

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:11.370
 The other day I went on a business trip to Tokyo 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:16.529
 There 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:18.850
 Well when traveling on a wi-fi spot or lte connection 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:24.970
 And yeah example 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:26.410
 It is in the Shinkansen I would like to report today about the feeling of use of iphone 5 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:31.330
 I think 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:32.619
 Tokyo of various the place of Toka some of it is I Yamada war because the true next 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:37.059
 Even though it was around 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:38.620
 Every time I take out this iphone and lt is connected to the ad lib line 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:38.840
 It means that there is 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:40.560
 Oh dear 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:45.810
 I tried 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:51.630
 Well this is lt Ya at quite a wide range of even the Yamaguchi-ray It is so say dinner 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:52.290
 Confirmed that are connected well to it is only connected at the same time Nema 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:56.340
 speed 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:58.320
 It 's like these speed nets because it's different in these places 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:02.100
 Te be of that speed 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:07.890
 Use an app that measures 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:11.250
 Location Suma Location Suma Location We also measured the speed of the shrimp. 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:15.359
 Of course there are some differences, but of course 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:20.819
 It is about the move and open a McCaw I package is a YouTube 

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:21.569
 Speed ​​is also in the place of the public of Mart ld I think that it seems that it was out where it is connected 

00:01:20.819 --> 00:01:24.630
 I will 

00:01:21.569 --> 00:01:27.760
 Buber I'm Shibuya area of 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:32.770
 Well to Well Kedomo it was moving relatively Yachiko land 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:33.160
 Shibuya is the connecting station of its connection area lte and it is very wide 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:37.900
 Ne 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:44.560
 Is up to you feel truly Well it is that a little different Do that if there Tokyo 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:44.980
 It is a good Well Deetto is in order to check the connection status of this lt Toka it g 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.630
 Ne 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:49.689
 It is in the above 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:57.050
 This number of antennas 

00:01:49.689 --> 00:02:00.440
 Well often just because it has led all of it this is also I'd be your reference 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:05.360
 It's actually a very stable number 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:09.039
 Rate of speed Toka of the foot does not mean the relationship 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:13.629
 The antenna is the number of one antenna 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:13.959
 It will be one standard but the number of antennas and just the throughput actual speed 

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:19.450
 Ne 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:23.440
 There is a difference in evidence 8 so still put it in the bar 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:28.120
 This has become necessary to actually check the speed Then say 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:33.340
 Oh yeah this time in the Shinkansen is this iphone 5 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:34.420
 I tried dub so far I used to use Softbank's iphone 4 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.210
 Though 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:43.480
 In the case of Softbank Yes 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:47.860
 The automatic What if you ride in Well ride and n is the hotels 700 Shinkansen bullet train 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:49.360
 When you open safari etc. It will automatically login and wait for wi-fi 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:55.660
 I will throw you 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:57.230
 Well, but in terms of experience so far, it is actually wi-fi connected in the car 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:03.049
 Speed ​​is very 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:08.450
 From where it says the is it quite this way can use comfortable where the hero because it was far from 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:09.300
 It is in Nema tried to use a little Well hoping that imposing something change Kana that 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:10.190
 The 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:14.540
 so 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:17.540
 What I will talk about from now on also includes things that did not go well 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:23.630
 I would like you to tell me if you know 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:25.340
 If au 's page 8 is checked, it will certainly be connected by the Shinkansen and au's 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:28.880
 At the wi-fi spot 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.210
 It is written well as saying that it connects automatically 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:34.770
 And 1 

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:36.480
 How to set eye-fi that section is already very simple and this au's home 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:41.610
 Though pages are included 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:43.140
 Wind that'll automatically connect only to turn on it is the wi-fi from the place settings 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:47.100
 I write in this way 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:50.200
 The place is in a and Shinkansen 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:54.280
 Well Kedomo I tried to repeat it is a way 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:55.230
 Unfortunately I did not connect automatically 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:59.159
 so 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:02.549
 It 's a child of Oh yeah Ma lead to wi-fi 

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:07.500
 Well a lot of it is it came out the wi-fi school in the ne masu 

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:09.800
 The name uq wi-fi is related, so the name came out so it 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:12.890
 When we choose 4 schools 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:18.350
 If the login screen comes out, the id password is this 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:24.960
 Well it is also in what to say to the fact there sought and is involved because to obtain what 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:29.729
 As I did not understand, as a result iphone 5 in the new cheers 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:32.009
 go is it is that the wi-fi connection also return also I was variously land work place 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:35.699
 But I could not even 

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:39.360
 This is the steady state of that hero 

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:44.550
 Although I tried to also collect other information Toka You can choose to Well 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:44.950
 Maybe this is something I do not understand, but this au iphone 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:49.570
 Five 

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:50.860
 You're wifi in the shinkansen wi-fi connection is still in place 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:56.050
 Not reached 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:05:01.330
 That it did not reach is one of the report items of this time 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:04.940
 Deetto there was one thing that was a little surprised it is the other 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:10.010
 Just as in the bullet train when the typhoon came closer 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:15.199
 I came back to Tokyo from Tokyo, but usually I'm in this car or in a royal court 

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:18.329
 I'm in the manner mode and I try not to do anything anymore 

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:22.379
 You're in the emergency bulletin me 

00:05:18.329 --> 00:05:28.889
 Where So it is like a please evacuate Well It is a heavy rain 

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:31.430
 Even though this emergency alert was turned off in this manner mode, is it? 

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:36.400
 It is a loud sound of gold tree 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:41.300
 I am of course Fu what it is the home thing because a now fair 

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:44.960
 Though I thought that I would not be myself, I overlooked the great good condition Kyoro Kyoro 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:50.000
 After all I realized from my pocket that I realized it 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:51.420
 I jumped out , but this means that I have to be careful a little , I feel outside 

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:56.490
 After all 

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:57.450
 I think there are places where you shouldn't make sound, or that kind of time 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:02.490
 Though 

00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:03.390
 Say usually if only vibration becomes is it cat temple in It is simply silent mode 

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:09.660
 But 

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:10.200
 If there is an emergency alert , it will be forced to notify you with a loud noise. 

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:11.409
 so 

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:17.199
 By the case and the time of Epstein 

00:06:11.409 --> 00:06:23.230
 Well, when it comes to being a serious thing, it's really important time too 

00:06:17.199 --> 00:06:28.000
 There is no bridge that I felt that I had to put the power back 

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:30.760
 As a result, if you go out on the wi-fi iphone 5 in that Shinkansen 

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.710
 I could not do that 

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:36.360
 so 

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:39.870
 Door Well other woman also those who are a little experience, such as the same it is when you examine the Internet 

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:44.040
 But I found one 

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:46.620
 I did not know before this is to buy iphone 5 of it is before au buy the arrow 

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:49.890
 It is while various finishing even though I 

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:51.700
 au such machine machine 

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:56.800
 Iphone 5 but iphone 5 

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:57.820
 Only can wi-fi connection of it is the iphone 5 if you have a 

00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:01.090
 It is not necessary 

00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:04.960
 This ipad you have at hand 

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:08.800
 It is one more for PC notebooks 

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:11.689
 It means that you can connect by 

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:17.509
 Application to download the last stage that app 

00:07:11.689 --> 00:07:21.199
 Download and set it up and it's connected, but anyway 

00:07:17.509 --> 00:07:22.159
 It is iphone 5 except iphone i bought iphone 5 

00:07:21.199 --> 00:07:26.629
 In case 

00:07:22.159 --> 00:07:31.159
 There is one more than iphone 5 It says that wi-fi connection can be done 

00:07:26.629 --> 00:07:31.710
 After all this I was not able to do because of lack of preparation, but it is quite big 

00:07:31.159 --> 00:07:35.610
 Advan 

00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:41.280
 I think Good Points kana of the Ordinary and say you do au I ne Well Service 

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:43.770
 That perhaps it is the Softbank another one in addition to the kind of iphone 5 

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:47.580
 I do n't think the service is ok 

00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:51.030
 If Well it is that I mean soft bank or au 

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:51.700
 If there is a person who thinks, it is one difference 

00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:56.020
 To see 

00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:59.800
 This is hey door in the fact that I thought to Fu called Do I think we can 

00:07:56.020 --> 00:08:02.980
 even though wi-fi connection itself it did not work in the Shinkansen 

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:07.990
 It is in the Tokyo metropolitan area and it is the range of lt 

00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:11.689
 Then I understand that au has its own services etc. 

00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:16.659
 I was able to do it, so in the future I will be more about wi-fi 

00:08:11.689 --> 00:08:16.659
 I also want to check a little bit about
