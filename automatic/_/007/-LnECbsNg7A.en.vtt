next thing we don't actually know the

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.290 
next thing we don't actually know the
true<00:01:29.409> pace<00:01:29.680> of<00:01:29.890> the<00:01:29.979> cause<00:01:30.190> because<00:01:30.400> they<00:01:30.820> they

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:31.300 
true pace of the cause because they they

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:32.700 
true pace of the cause because they they
have<00:01:31.659> been<00:01:31.810> told<00:01:32.020> that<00:01:32.200> they've<00:01:32.350> only<00:01:32.530> be

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:32.710 
have been told that they've only be

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:34.920 
have been told that they've only be
running<00:01:33.010> fifty<00:01:33.370> percent<00:01:33.640> pace<00:01:33.940> yeah<00:01:34.690> we've

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:34.930 
running fifty percent pace yeah we've

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.590 
running fifty percent pace yeah we've
found<00:01:35.500> out<00:01:35.800> that<00:01:36.370> apparently<00:01:37.000> some<00:01:37.330> teams

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 
found out that apparently some teams

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:38.969 
found out that apparently some teams
were<00:01:37.780> only<00:01:37.930> covering<00:01:38.320> fifty<00:01:38.650> percent<00:01:38.890> of

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:38.979 
were only covering fifty percent of

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:42.660 
were only covering fifty percent of
their<00:01:39.130> pace<00:01:39.310> exactly<00:01:39.940> yeah<00:01:40.299> so<00:01:41.400> they<00:01:42.400> can<00:01:42.580> go

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
their pace exactly yeah so they can go

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:44.850 
their pace exactly yeah so they can go
even<00:01:42.790> faster<00:01:43.060> exactly<00:01:43.900> so<00:01:44.140> actually<00:01:44.560> that's

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:44.860 
even faster exactly so actually that's

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.670 
even faster exactly so actually that's
about<00:01:45.130> all<00:01:45.159> for<00:01:45.610> the<00:01:46.180> direst<00:01:46.750> testing<00:01:47.140> the

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:47.680 
about all for the direst testing the

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.469 
about all for the direst testing the

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
well the internal packaging of the car

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:18.890 
well the internal packaging of the car
was<00:03:16.960> too<00:03:17.170> tight<00:03:17.500> that<00:03:18.220> caused<00:03:18.550> the

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
was too tight that caused the

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.200 
was too tight that caused the
overheating<00:03:19.900> issues<00:03:20.260> and<00:03:21.090> apparently<00:03:22.090> they

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 
can see exactly here another key point

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.200 
can see exactly here another key point
is<00:03:38.860> that<00:03:38.920> obviously<00:03:39.370> because<00:03:39.940> of<00:03:40.060> that

is that obviously because of that

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:42.480 
is that obviously because of that
problem<00:03:40.440> the<00:03:41.440> Rhino<00:03:41.650> powered<00:03:41.980> cars<00:03:42.280> will<00:03:42.460> be

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:42.490 
problem the Rhino powered cars will be

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:45.940 
possible yeah they'll be pushing really

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:47.700 
possible yeah they'll be pushing really
hard<00:03:46.060> i<00:03:46.360> think<00:03:46.570> yes<00:03:46.750> they're<00:03:47.200> forced<00:03:47.590> through

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:47.710 
hard i think yes they're forced through

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:49.200 
hard i think yes they're forced through
yeah<00:03:48.100> they're<00:03:48.280> pushing<00:03:48.580> really<00:03:48.700> hard<00:03:48.820> to<00:03:49.090> get

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:49.210 
yeah they're pushing really hard to get

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:51.180 
yeah they're pushing really hard to get
as<00:03:49.420> many<00:03:49.690> laps<00:03:50.020> as<00:03:50.170> done<00:03:50.380> collect<00:03:50.830> as<00:03:50.950> much

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.190 
as many laps as done collect as much

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:53.010 
as many laps as done collect as much
data<00:03:51.250> as<00:03:51.640> they<00:03:51.790> can<00:03:51.970> because<00:03:52.180> they<00:03:52.840> have

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:53.020 
data as they can because they have

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:55.080 
data as they can because they have
really<00:03:53.350> behind<00:03:53.680> on<00:03:53.860> day<00:03:54.010> there<00:03:54.280> hundreds<00:03:54.940> and

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
really behind on day there hundreds and

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.210 
really behind on day there hundreds and
hundreds<00:03:55.480> of<00:03:55.540> laps<00:03:55.780> behind<00:03:55.990> yeah<00:03:56.470> that's

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
hundreds of laps behind yeah that's

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:58.920 
hundreds of laps behind yeah that's
really<00:03:57.430> crucial<00:03:57.760> right<00:03:58.150> information<00:03:58.450> that<00:03:58.810> it

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
really crucial right information that it

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:01.410 
really crucial right information that it
could<00:03:59.080> have<00:03:59.170> used<00:03:59.350> yet<00:03:59.740> yeah<00:04:00.270> next<00:04:01.270> thing

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:01.420 
could have used yet yeah next thing

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:04.110 
could have used yet yeah next thing
Mercedes<00:04:02.110> McLaren<00:04:02.460> to<00:04:03.460> be<00:04:03.550> honest<00:04:03.760> I<00:04:03.880> think

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 
Mercedes McLaren to be honest I think

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.400 
Mercedes McLaren to be honest I think
they<00:04:04.180> were<00:04:04.240> already<00:04:04.390> dominant<00:04:04.840> what<00:04:05.260> they

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:05.410 
they were already dominant what they

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:07.800 
they were already dominant what they
were<00:04:05.590> obviously<00:04:05.800> they<00:04:06.190> proved<00:04:06.460> it<00:04:06.610> over<00:04:07.450> 300

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:07.810 
were obviously they proved it over 300

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:10.530 
were obviously they proved it over 300
laps<00:04:07.930> between<00:04:08.320> them<00:04:08.500> and<00:04:08.710> I<00:04:09.400> think<00:04:09.460> they<00:04:10.150> do

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:10.540 
laps between them and I think they do

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:11.520 
laps between them and I think they do
you<00:04:10.600> think<00:04:10.750> they<00:04:10.840> can<00:04:10.990> keep<00:04:11.260> up<00:04:11.410> their

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:11.530 
you think they can keep up their

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:14.160 
you think they can keep up their
dominance<00:04:11.920> I<00:04:12.100> say<00:04:12.850> yes<00:04:13.090> i<00:04:13.330> think<00:04:13.630> so<00:04:13.930> as<00:04:14.140> well

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:14.170 
dominance I say yes i think so as well

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:16.830 
dominance I say yes i think so as well
because<00:04:14.650> the<00:04:15.490> Mercedes<00:04:15.880> engine<00:04:16.060> seems<00:04:16.510> to<00:04:16.720> be

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840 
because the Mercedes engine seems to be

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.050 
because the Mercedes engine seems to be
the<00:04:17.109> most<00:04:17.230> reliable<00:04:17.410> at<00:04:17.770> the<00:04:17.859> moment<00:04:18.190> yeah<00:04:18.670> so

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.060 
the most reliable at the moment yeah so

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:22.110 
the most reliable at the moment yeah so
I<00:04:19.480> think<00:04:20.470> they've<00:04:21.280> covered<00:04:21.489> the<00:04:21.700> most<00:04:21.880> laps

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
I think they've covered the most laps

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.380 
I think they've covered the most laps
they've<00:04:23.050> got<00:04:23.230> brilliant<00:04:23.710> drivers<00:04:24.150> McLaren<00:04:25.150> I

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:25.390 
they've got brilliant drivers McLaren I

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:28.440 
they've got brilliant drivers McLaren I
feel<00:04:25.990> other<00:04:26.230> team<00:04:26.560> that<00:04:26.860> had<00:04:27.400> the<00:04:27.550> need<00:04:27.700> to<00:04:27.880> to

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:28.450 
feel other team that had the need to to

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:29.730 
feel other team that had the need to to
show<00:04:28.630> what<00:04:28.840> they<00:04:28.960> can<00:04:28.990> do<00:04:29.260> because<00:04:29.440> Mercedes

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:29.740 
show what they can do because Mercedes

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.100 
show what they can do because Mercedes
are<00:04:30.250> dead<00:04:30.430> they've<00:04:31.270> been<00:04:31.450> progressing<00:04:31.990> really
