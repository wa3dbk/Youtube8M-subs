00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:05.879
 Indian curry in principle the 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.560
 development for what we use 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:20.490
 our gara masala what we did the other day 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:22.710
 have shown the ingredients for our 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:26.210
 Indian curry beside our gram 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:29.939
 astana of linked at the end o drop 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:34.309
 vegetable paprika here we have jams 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:37.380
 carrots to onions while pineapple 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:39.840
 coconut milk very important and 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.730
 cashew kernels still garlic and what 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.090
 naturally belongs to india to lenses 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.739
 that's grinning in the mountain when you 're right 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.480
 Looks you can see that are actually the 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:54.670
 red lentils with shell still 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:57.010
 We cooked that for ten minutes 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:59.640
 you see that ten minutes cooked and 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:02.760
 then just pulled aside 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.320
 that means they are good half gare in 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.240
 Of course, you can get it all in India 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.170
 but we also want a pot to the 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.060
 have vegetables 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.410
 so just take this one off and on 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.360
 we have the rostocker then to the 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:18.850
 Personally , I just like products 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:20.460
 better well ok first having seen the 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.460
 have already made lenses in principle 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.460
 onion 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:34.630
 in principle, this whole vegetables since 

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:38.369
 some time is only small together 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:42.610
 cut and then given in pot 1 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:44.110
 along with celery in half 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.410
 you can see how sure he is 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:50.770
 apart after cutting 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:52.450
 for his own life the peppers 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.310
 I like them just love to just 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.599
 She loves to cook 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:02:07.989
 also have a big advantage 

00:01:55.599 --> 00:02:11.410
 one can almost like inside life 

00:02:07.989 --> 00:02:14.080
 By the way, even with food not at all 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.730
 Bad, I have to get some vegetables 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.390
 get rid of the we heated ours 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:24.090
 buck and add some coconut oil 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:24.090
 ears already share of vegetables purely 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:28.900
 we make the same cover it sit 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.870
 to keep 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:35.440
 no, we quickly the paprika comes 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:37.000
 after all, like that 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.709
 You have to think about it yourself 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.209
 although they have it out or wanted it 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:42.209
 I did not let it out now 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:46.090
 While it's often asked why did you do that 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.040
 Sharp knives where do you get something like that 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.840
 I have on my page the biokost de 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.160
 there is also a fresh and in 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.780
 Syria we rely on myvideo 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.260
 description purely there you see mine 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.790
 kitchen appliances and I work at all 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.140
 The papers also admitted that 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:02.519
 Project now everything to yourself 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:02.519
 Now we make the pineapple 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:09.540
 simply cut off both ends 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.540
 put down 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:23.840
 I'm using the video for the video now 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.580
 Half pineapple that's why I look if it 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.820
 Do not let the skin go 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.820
 dries up 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:33.500
 you still have to 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:35.750
 halve and then first the medium 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.900
 It's hard to get it out there 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:41.200
 my parrots on it eat like that 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.200
 scary happy 

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:49.550
 and then the paprika pineapple 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:56.000
 in principle in the same way as it is from the see 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:57.020
 ago knows well the roast group has one 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.180
 already given 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:01.870
 the topic of cashew kernels adds to that 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.870
 upgrade 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:11.230
 yes that's never been burned so 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.230
 do not worry about gara masala now 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:16.510
 as I said either do it yourself or 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.859
 Of course you can buy it as well 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:20.720
 our karama scale is now 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:25.570
 then the spices at even ginger 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:28.910
 and chili with rent differently 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:30.680
 Now we have moisture again 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:39.260
 The moisture is quite good which dissolves 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:40.970
 Now just put our attached on 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:43.300
 first at the moment it continue 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:43.300
 to let 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:53.169
 now this has been nice and clean 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:53.169
 our lenses come in handy and 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:05.780
 coconut milk let's do it all 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:07.430
 again to the boil and a 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:14.450
 10 bit I'd say so 5 minutes 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:18.200
 simmer similar, I finish now 

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:19.550
 it looks so delicious 

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:22.910
 of course can to taste with 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:24.830
 salt pepper paprika turmeric or one 

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:26.390
 other curry or even more gara 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:28.700
 Masala as you like it 

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:30.470
 let's try a really great one 

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:32.040
 I fit very exotic travels 

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:35.070
 of course, and 

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:36.690
 I wish you waited and running 

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:38.490
 now addressed in the video earlier 

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:40.320
 our gara masala how to do it yourself 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:41.970
 As I said of course you can do this 

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:43.730
 Mix yourself to buy yourself there 

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:45.660
 It also has different qualities 

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:47.580
 different nuances garam masala 

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:49.980
 is such a story in india as 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:52.080
 keep carry in china everyone's power 

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:53.550

 always easy to share is glad about me 

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:55.980
 especially 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:58.370
 but I hope you are the sixth time 

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:58.370
