00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
for third place in the beginning I think

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.400 
for third place in the beginning I think
that<00:00:44.399> our<00:00:44.820> first<00:00:45.000> goal<00:00:45.270> settled<00:00:45.899> us<00:00:46.050> a<00:00:46.260> little

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
that our first goal settled us a little

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.720 
that our first goal settled us a little
bit<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:47.360> maybe<00:00:48.360> took<00:00:48.600> away<00:00:48.840> some<00:00:49.079> of<00:00:49.110> their

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:49.730 
bit and maybe took away some of their

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.189 
bit and maybe took away some of their
energy<00:00:50.730> that<00:00:51.210> stuff<00:00:51.449> and<00:00:51.629> then<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:51.870> second

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
energy that stuff and then the second

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.279 
energy that stuff and then the second
goal<00:00:52.350> obviously<00:00:53.690> made<00:00:54.690> things<00:00:54.930> a<00:00:55.020> little<00:00:55.140> bit

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
goal obviously made things a little bit

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.020 
goal obviously made things a little bit
more<00:00:55.440> comfortable<00:00:55.739> first<00:00:56.070> I<00:00:56.340> know<00:00:56.820> they've

always<00:02:38.830> stay<00:02:39.010> in<00:02:39.130> the<00:02:39.220> game<00:02:39.400> even<00:02:39.670> though<00:02:39.790> he

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
always stay in the game even though he

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.910 
always stay in the game even though he
went<00:02:40.090> up<00:02:40.210> one<00:02:40.960> and<00:02:41.170> then<00:02:41.260> just<00:02:41.440> ended<00:02:41.800> up

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
went up one and then just ended up

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.310 
went up one and then just ended up
losing<00:02:42.220> at<00:02:42.310> all<00:02:42.460> I<00:02:43.150> think<00:02:43.720> today<00:02:43.960> we<00:02:44.140> just

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
losing at all I think today we just

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:45.870 
losing at all I think today we just
figured<00:02:44.590> out<00:02:44.710> that<00:02:44.920> we<00:02:45.340> just<00:02:45.430> play<00:02:45.610> for<00:02:45.670> our

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
figured out that we just play for our

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.330 
figured out that we just play for our
pride<00:02:46.120> and<00:02:46.150> then<00:02:46.420> just<00:02:46.630> score<00:02:47.290> and<00:02:47.650> keep<00:02:48.220> on

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
pride and then just score and keep on

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:49.560 
pride and then just score and keep on
scoring<00:02:48.580> and<00:02:48.850> then<00:02:48.940> just<00:02:49.150> I<00:02:49.270> do<00:02:49.450> it<00:02:49.540> for

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
scoring and then just I do it for

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:51.120 
scoring and then just I do it for
ourselves<00:02:49.750> I<00:02:50.170> think<00:02:50.500> this<00:02:50.590> particular

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
ourselves I think this particular

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.580 
ourselves I think this particular
experience<00:02:51.580> on<00:02:51.780> speaking<00:02:52.780> personally<00:02:53.290> the

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
experience on speaking personally the

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.080 
experience on speaking personally the
last<00:02:53.770> time<00:02:54.040> we<00:02:54.520> went<00:02:54.640> home<00:02:54.850> with<00:02:55.030> the

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
last time we went home with the

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.300 
last time we went home with the
championship<00:02:55.600> so<00:02:55.960> it's<00:02:56.230> unfortunately<00:02:56.980> one

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
championship so it's unfortunately one

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.220 
championship so it's unfortunately one
difference<00:02:57.730> will<00:02:57.880> be<00:02:57.910> not<00:02:58.840> having<00:02:59.050> the

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
difference will be not having the

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.800 
difference will be not having the
storybook<00:02:59.710> ending<00:03:00.130> but<00:03:00.370> but<00:03:01.360> I<00:03:01.390> think<00:03:01.720> it's

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
storybook ending but but I think it's

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.840 
storybook ending but but I think it's
always<00:03:01.990> it's<00:03:02.290> a<00:03:02.620> great<00:03:02.830> opportunity<00:03:03.130> to<00:03:03.550> test

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
always it's a great opportunity to test

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.700 
always it's a great opportunity to test
yourself<00:03:03.970> against<00:03:04.510> the<00:03:04.690> very<00:03:04.840> very<00:03:05.080> best<00:03:05.350> and

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:05.710 
yourself against the very very best and

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:07.980 
yourself against the very very best and
I<00:03:06.460> think<00:03:07.210> you<00:03:07.390> know<00:03:07.420> one<00:03:07.630> of<00:03:07.660> the<00:03:07.780> approaches

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:07.990 
I think you know one of the approaches

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:09.450 
I think you know one of the approaches
we've<00:03:08.320> tried<00:03:08.530> to<00:03:08.620> have<00:03:08.740> what<00:03:08.860> the<00:03:08.980> kids<00:03:09.220> was

we've tried to have what the kids was
you<00:03:09.790> know<00:03:09.910> whether<00:03:10.120> you<00:03:10.270> get<00:03:10.390> the<00:03:10.570> final<00:03:11.380> metal

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:11.830 
you know whether you get the final metal

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:14.040 
you know whether you get the final metal
