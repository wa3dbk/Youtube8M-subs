 for the first time but as I said packs and 

00:04:05.619 --> 00:04:07.279
 start like 

00:04:07.279 --> 00:04:09.329
 last five years ago and unrest 

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:12.329

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:29.080
 gold 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:30.139
 the situation is really 

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:32.530
 critical as critical 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:35.530
 requires special 

00:04:42.559 --> 00:04:44.939

 signatures 10 days zenith away from Russia 

00:05:07.649 --> 00:05:10.649
 money as it turns out 

00:05:12.529 --> 00:05:15.529

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:23.969
 a lot to do for many citizens 

00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:26.969

00:05:27.809 --> 00:05:29.490
 Minina and the fireman 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:32.490
