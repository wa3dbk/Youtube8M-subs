tutorial during this video I'm gonna
show<00:00:15.669> you<00:00:15.730> two<00:00:16.059> methods<00:00:16.240> that<00:00:16.570> I<00:00:16.630> employ

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:16.990 
show you two methods that I employ

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:19.440 
show you two methods that I employ
whenever<00:00:17.590> I'm<00:00:17.740> d<00:00:17.950> barbing<00:00:18.310> hooks<00:00:18.520> this<00:00:19.390> is

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:19.450 
whenever I'm d barbing hooks this is

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:21.650 
whenever I'm d barbing hooks this is
done<00:00:19.810> right<00:00:20.230> before<00:00:20.349> the<00:00:20.829> tying<00:00:21.099> of<00:00:21.250> the<00:00:21.369> fly

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
done right before the tying of the fly

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.970 
done right before the tying of the fly
it's<00:00:22.660> gonna<00:00:22.750> be<00:00:22.930> based<00:00:23.140> upon<00:00:23.439> the<00:00:23.619> vise<00:00:23.769> that

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:23.980 
it's gonna be based upon the vise that

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.029 
it's gonna be based upon the vise that
you<00:00:24.070> have<00:00:24.279> and<00:00:24.519> I'll<00:00:24.880> get<00:00:25.060> to<00:00:25.150> that<00:00:25.179> real<00:00:25.539> soon

you have and I'll get to that real soon
I've<00:00:27.039> been<00:00:27.189> tying<00:00:27.400> flies<00:00:27.609> for<00:00:28.000> about<00:00:28.119> 25<00:00:28.630> years

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:28.900 
I've been tying flies for about 25 years

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.990 
I've been tying flies for about 25 years
and<00:00:29.140> my<00:00:29.650> early<00:00:29.830> group<00:00:30.160> of<00:00:30.279> mentors<00:00:30.490> used<00:00:30.910> to

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:31.000 
and my early group of mentors used to

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.820 
and my early group of mentors used to
always<00:00:31.210> stress<00:00:31.689> that<00:00:32.080> you<00:00:32.199> should<00:00:32.379> dbar<00:00:32.739> up

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:32.830 
always stress that you should dbar up

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:35.250 
always stress that you should dbar up
the<00:00:32.920> hook<00:00:33.100> first<00:00:33.510> whenever<00:00:34.510> I<00:00:34.660> asked<00:00:34.839> them<00:00:35.080> why

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:35.260 
the hook first whenever I asked them why

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.670 
the hook first whenever I asked them why
there<00:00:35.710> were<00:00:35.830> two<00:00:35.860> common<00:00:36.309> answers<00:00:37.110> first<00:00:38.110> they

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:38.680 
there were two common answers first they

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.530 
there were two common answers first they
wanted<00:00:39.070> to<00:00:39.159> ensure<00:00:39.460> that<00:00:39.489> that<00:00:39.790> hook<00:00:40.030> wasn't

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:40.540 
wanted to ensure that that hook wasn't

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.149 
wanted to ensure that that hook wasn't
too<00:00:40.720> brittle<00:00:41.110> then<00:00:41.440> it<00:00:41.559> had<00:00:41.680> been<00:00:41.830> finished

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:42.159 
too brittle then it had been finished

00:00:42.159 --> 00:00:45.479 
too brittle then it had been finished
properly<00:00:42.430> if<00:00:43.000> you<00:00:43.989> D<00:00:44.320> barb<00:00:44.559> the<00:00:44.710> hook<00:00:44.890> and<00:00:45.100> it

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:45.489 
properly if you D barb the hook and it

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:47.759 
properly if you D barb the hook and it
broke<00:00:45.699> you<00:00:46.089> didn't<00:00:46.330> waste<00:00:46.540> any<00:00:46.869> time<00:00:47.019> on<00:00:47.290> a<00:00:47.500> fly

00:00:47.759 --> 00:00:47.769 
broke you didn't waste any time on a fly

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:49.799 
broke you didn't waste any time on a fly
that<00:00:48.010> would<00:00:48.190> ultimately<00:00:48.479> not<00:00:49.479> have<00:00:49.659> been

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:49.809 
that would ultimately not have been

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:52.740 
that would ultimately not have been
fished<00:00:50.400> the<00:00:51.400> second<00:00:51.760> reason<00:00:51.909> was<00:00:52.269> a<00:00:52.449> lot

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:52.750 
fished the second reason was a lot

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:54.840 
fished the second reason was a lot
simpler<00:00:53.080> and<00:00:53.290> that<00:00:53.440> was<00:00:53.619> because<00:00:54.070> they<00:00:54.580> wanted

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:54.850 
simpler and that was because they wanted

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:56.729 
simpler and that was because they wanted
to<00:00:54.909> ensure<00:00:55.239> that<00:00:55.269> you<00:00:55.900> didn't<00:00:56.229> forget<00:00:56.470> to<00:00:56.530> D

00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:56.739 
to ensure that you didn't forget to D

to ensure that you didn't forget to D

on<00:01:20.859> quite<00:01:21.310> often<00:01:21.520> I<00:01:21.789> see<00:01:22.060> on<00:01:22.179> some<00:01:22.390> internet

00:01:22.739 --> 00:01:22.749 
on quite often I see on some internet

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:25.349 
on quite often I see on some internet
forums<00:01:23.439> but<00:01:23.920> I<00:01:24.130> really<00:01:24.490> think<00:01:24.700> that<00:01:24.820> most<00:01:25.210> of

00:01:25.349 --> 00:01:25.359 
forums but I really think that most of

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:27.120 
forums but I really think that most of
those<00:01:25.479> points<00:01:25.840> are<00:01:25.960> moved<00:01:26.170> it<00:01:26.619> just<00:01:26.679> makes

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
those points are moved it just makes

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.700 
those points are moved it just makes
more<00:01:27.340> sense<00:01:27.670> I<00:01:27.909> hooked<00:01:28.899> my<00:01:28.990> vest<00:01:29.320> before<00:01:29.469> I

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:29.710 
more sense I hooked my vest before I

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.069 
more sense I hooked my vest before I
hooked<00:01:30.159> my<00:01:30.219> shirt<00:01:30.549> before<00:01:30.909> if<00:01:31.509> there's<00:01:31.749> a<00:01:31.810> barb

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
in it you know it's a lot tougher to get

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.609 
in it you know it's a lot tougher to get
out<00:01:33.999> and<00:01:34.210> it's<00:01:34.509> the<00:01:34.630> same<00:01:34.840> with<00:01:34.990> that<00:01:35.109> fish<00:01:35.380> I

will not shut until I manually do that
with<00:03:24.670> the<00:03:24.819> lever<00:03:25.739> whenever<00:03:26.739> we're<00:03:27.190> using<00:03:27.340> a

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:27.489 
with the lever whenever we're using a

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:30.090 
with the lever whenever we're using a
vise<00:03:27.700> like<00:03:28.180> this<00:03:28.450> I<00:03:28.630> really<00:03:29.290> prefer<00:03:29.680> to<00:03:29.709> open

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:30.100 
vise like this I really prefer to open

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.520 
vise like this I really prefer to open
the<00:03:30.190> jaws<00:03:30.400> a<00:03:30.430> little<00:03:30.760> bit<00:03:30.910> and<00:03:31.139> place<00:03:32.139> the<00:03:32.380> hook

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
the jaws a little bit and place the hook

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:35.430 
the jaws a little bit and place the hook
in<00:03:32.709> what<00:03:32.859> I<00:03:32.889> consider<00:03:33.359> perpendicular<00:03:34.410> what<00:03:35.410> I

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 
in what I consider perpendicular what I

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.650 
in what I consider perpendicular what I
mean<00:03:35.680> by<00:03:35.859> that<00:03:36.069> is<00:03:36.280> basically<00:03:37.000> think<00:03:37.329> of<00:03:37.420> it<00:03:37.510> as

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 
mean by that is basically think of it as

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.030 
mean by that is basically think of it as
whenever<00:03:38.019> you<00:03:38.170> have<00:03:38.410> your<00:03:38.620> hook<00:03:38.799> in<00:03:38.920> the<00:03:38.950> vise

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
whenever you have your hook in the vise

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.819 
whenever you have your hook in the vise
regular<00:03:39.910> we'll<00:03:40.359> call<00:03:40.569> that<00:03:40.720> parallel<00:03:41.290> and

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:41.829 
regular we'll call that parallel and

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:43.920 
regular we'll call that parallel and
we'll<00:03:41.980> just<00:03:42.160> turn<00:03:42.430> it<00:03:42.579> 90<00:03:43.329> degrees<00:03:43.359> and<00:03:43.690> we'll

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
we'll just turn it 90 degrees and we'll

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.440 
we'll just turn it 90 degrees and we'll
call<00:03:44.109> that<00:03:44.290> perpendicular<00:03:45.120> so<00:03:46.120> you<00:03:46.209> can<00:03:46.329> see

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
call that perpendicular so you can see

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:47.659 
call that perpendicular so you can see
what<00:03:46.569> I'm<00:03:46.660> talking<00:03:46.690> about

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:47.669 
what I'm talking about

00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:51.000 
what I'm talking about
I'll<00:03:48.669> change<00:03:49.000> the<00:03:49.180> position<00:03:49.510> of<00:03:49.599> my<00:03:49.720> jaws<00:03:50.010> I've

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 
I'll change the position of my jaws I've

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:53.550 
I'll change the position of my jaws I've
opened<00:03:51.250> them<00:03:51.519> and<00:03:51.730> I<00:03:52.569> can<00:03:52.720> place<00:03:52.959> that<00:03:53.139> hook<00:03:53.349> in

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
opened them and I can place that hook in

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.190 
opened them and I can place that hook in
so<00:03:54.069> that<00:03:54.220> the<00:03:54.340> Barb<00:03:54.549> fits<00:03:54.880> between<00:03:55.060> those<00:03:55.959> two

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:56.200 
so that the Barb fits between those two

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.180 
so that the Barb fits between those two
jaws<00:03:57.329> once<00:03:58.329> it<00:03:58.510> is<00:03:58.599> between<00:03:58.959> those<00:03:59.139> jaws<00:03:59.410> we

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.190 
jaws once it is between those jaws we

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:03.690 
jaws once it is between those jaws we
can<00:04:00.340> close<00:04:00.579> them<00:04:00.790> and<00:04:01.319> typically<00:04:02.319> we<00:04:03.280> will<00:04:03.459> at

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:03.700 
can close them and typically we will at

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:05.610 
can close them and typically we will at
this<00:04:04.000> point<00:04:04.299> have<00:04:04.510> completely<00:04:04.959> dbar<00:04:05.440> of<00:04:05.500> the

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
this point have completely dbar of the

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.099 
this point have completely dbar of the
hook<00:04:06.150> that's<00:04:07.150> what<00:04:07.359> happens<00:04:07.660> whenever<00:04:07.810> you're

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:08.109 
hook that's what happens whenever you're

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:10.289 
hook that's what happens whenever you're
using<00:04:08.319> smaller<00:04:08.950> trout<00:04:09.519> hooks<00:04:09.790> whenever<00:04:10.180> I'm

00:04:10.289 --> 00:04:10.299 
using smaller trout hooks whenever I'm

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:12.330 
using smaller trout hooks whenever I'm
using<00:04:10.329> larger<00:04:11.019> hooks<00:04:11.260> such<00:04:11.829> as<00:04:11.980> those<00:04:12.099> for

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340 
using larger hooks such as those for

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:14.220 
using larger hooks such as those for
saltwater<00:04:12.639> or<00:04:13.060> streamers<00:04:13.510> I'll<00:04:13.870> typically

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.230 
saltwater or streamers I'll typically

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:16.740 
saltwater or streamers I'll typically
have<00:04:14.440> the<00:04:14.739> barb<00:04:14.950> twice<00:04:15.400> so<00:04:16.299> I'll<00:04:16.389> go<00:04:16.539> through

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750 
have the barb twice so I'll go through

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:17.879 
have the barb twice so I'll go through
that<00:04:16.780> portion<00:04:17.500> once

00:04:17.879 --> 00:04:17.889 
that portion once

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:20.670 
that portion once
I'll<00:04:18.130> close<00:04:18.910> the<00:04:19.120> jaws<00:04:19.299> a<00:04:19.329> little<00:04:19.690> bit<00:04:19.810> and<00:04:19.959> D

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680 
I'll close the jaws a little bit and D

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.860 
I'll close the jaws a little bit and D
barb<00:04:20.950> a<00:04:21.039> second<00:04:21.370> time<00:04:21.519> it's<00:04:22.479> kind<00:04:22.630> of<00:04:22.690> tough

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:22.870 
barb a second time it's kind of tough

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:25.170 
barb a second time it's kind of tough
for<00:04:22.900> me<00:04:23.110> to<00:04:23.200> do<00:04:23.320> that<00:04:23.530> on<00:04:24.250> camera<00:04:24.760> so<00:04:24.910> I'll<00:04:25.000> just

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:25.180 
for me to do that on camera so I'll just

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.630 
for me to do that on camera so I'll just
turn<00:04:25.360> it<00:04:25.510> so<00:04:25.630> I<00:04:25.660> can<00:04:25.870> see<00:04:26.080> it<00:04:26.169> ID<00:04:27.010> barb<00:04:27.340> once

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:27.640 
turn it so I can see it ID barb once

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:30.330 
turn it so I can see it ID barb once
there<00:04:27.880> it's<00:04:28.450> partially<00:04:29.020> that<00:04:29.979> barb<00:04:30.219> is

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:30.340 
there it's partially that barb is

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:32.070 
there it's partially that barb is
partially<00:04:30.789> down

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 
partially down

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.950 
partially down
now<00:04:32.169> the<00:04:32.229> second<00:04:32.680> time<00:04:33.419> that<00:04:34.419> barb<00:04:34.780> is

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 
now the second time that barb is

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.980 
now the second time that barb is
basically<00:04:35.409> all<00:04:35.650> but<00:04:36.069> gone<00:04:36.509> now<00:04:37.509> I<00:04:37.539> have<00:04:37.750> a<00:04:37.780> hook

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:37.990 
basically all but gone now I have a hook

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:39.540 
basically all but gone now I have a hook
that<00:04:38.020> I<00:04:38.199> really<00:04:38.560> don't<00:04:38.710> have<00:04:38.830> to<00:04:39.039> worry<00:04:39.250> too

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:39.550 
that I really don't have to worry too

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:40.860 
that I really don't have to worry too
much<00:04:39.580> about<00:04:39.759> I<00:04:40.240> don't<00:04:40.360> have<00:04:40.539> to<00:04:40.629> worry<00:04:40.810> about

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:40.870 
much about I don't have to worry about

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:43.350 
much about I don't have to worry about
hooking<00:04:41.530> another<00:04:41.860> person<00:04:42.310> hooking<00:04:42.669> myself

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.360 
hooking another person hooking myself

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.029 
hooking another person hooking myself
hooking<00:04:43.900> something<00:04:44.199> that<00:04:44.319> I'm<00:04:44.409> wearing<00:04:44.620> or

hooking something that I'm wearing or

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:47.369 
hooking something that I'm wearing or
more<00:04:45.400> importantly<00:04:45.879> removing<00:04:46.810> this<00:04:46.990> hook<00:04:47.199> from

00:04:47.369 --> 00:04:47.379 
more importantly removing this hook from

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:49.610 
more importantly removing this hook from
a<00:04:47.530> fish's<00:04:47.830> mouth<00:04:48.009> after<00:04:48.849> I've<00:04:48.969> caught<00:04:49.240> it

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620 
a fish's mouth after I've caught it

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:51.959 
a fish's mouth after I've caught it
again<00:04:50.620> that<00:04:50.770> first<00:04:51.039> technique<00:04:51.400> is<00:04:51.520> going<00:04:51.789> to

00:04:51.959 --> 00:04:51.969 
again that first technique is going to

00:04:51.969 --> 00:04:53.850 
again that first technique is going to
be<00:04:52.449> used<00:04:52.689> whenever<00:04:52.900> you<00:04:53.139> have<00:04:53.289> a<00:04:53.349> vise<00:04:53.590> that

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:53.860 
be used whenever you have a vise that

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.159 
be used whenever you have a vise that
will<00:04:54.310> always<00:04:54.580> have<00:04:54.909> open<00:04:55.419> jaws<00:04:55.629> that<00:04:55.900> you<00:04:55.990> have

00:04:56.159 --> 00:04:56.169 
will always have open jaws that you have

00:04:56.169 --> 00:04:59.309 
will always have open jaws that you have
to<00:04:56.349> manually<00:04:57.069> close<00:04:57.810> I'm<00:04:58.810> now<00:04:59.050> going<00:04:59.229> to

00:04:59.309 --> 00:04:59.319 
to manually close I'm now going to

00:04:59.319 --> 00:05:01.559 
to manually close I'm now going to
change<00:04:59.469> our<00:04:59.680> vices<00:05:00.069> and<00:05:00.250> show<00:05:00.520> you<00:05:00.580> the<00:05:01.180> second

00:05:01.559 --> 00:05:01.569 
change our vices and show you the second

00:05:01.569 --> 00:05:04.649 
change our vices and show you the second
method<00:05:02.699> before<00:05:03.699> I<00:05:03.909> show<00:05:04.060> you<00:05:04.090> the<00:05:04.300> second

00:05:04.649 --> 00:05:04.659 
method before I show you the second

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:06.839 
method before I show you the second
method<00:05:04.780> I<00:05:05.110> want<00:05:05.979> to<00:05:06.099> really<00:05:06.310> just<00:05:06.490> point<00:05:06.729> out

00:05:06.839 --> 00:05:06.849 
method I want to really just point out

00:05:06.849 --> 00:05:08.610 
method I want to really just point out
that<00:05:06.909> the<00:05:07.479> hook<00:05:07.629> size<00:05:07.900> I'm<00:05:08.110> using<00:05:08.349> is

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:08.620 
that the hook size I'm using is

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:10.740 
that the hook size I'm using is
irrelevant<00:05:09.009> this<00:05:09.759> is<00:05:09.909> a<00:05:09.940> larger<00:05:10.389> hook<00:05:10.569> and

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:10.750 
irrelevant this is a larger hook and

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:12.270 
irrelevant this is a larger hook and
that's<00:05:10.810> for<00:05:11.080> the<00:05:11.139> purposes<00:05:11.560> of<00:05:11.710> this<00:05:11.949> video

the<00:05:17.259> method<00:05:17.620> on<00:05:17.770> the<00:05:18.129> vise<00:05:18.310> that<00:05:18.490> I'm<00:05:18.580> using<00:05:19.169> in

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:20.169 
the method on the vise that I'm using in

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:21.899 
the method on the vise that I'm using in
this<00:05:20.379> second<00:05:20.770> method<00:05:20.889> I'm<00:05:21.159> using<00:05:21.190> a<00:05:21.490> stone<00:05:21.729> foe

00:05:21.899 --> 00:05:21.909 
this second method I'm using a stone foe

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:24.269 
this second method I'm using a stone foe
came<00:05:22.150> advice<00:05:22.650> this<00:05:23.650> is<00:05:23.710> a<00:05:23.889> vise<00:05:24.069> that's

00:05:24.269 --> 00:05:24.279 
came advice this is a vise that's

00:05:24.279 --> 00:05:27.119 
came advice this is a vise that's
similar<00:05:24.490> to<00:05:24.610> a<00:05:24.759> regal<00:05:25.210> and<00:05:25.919> these<00:05:26.919> are

00:05:27.119 --> 00:05:27.129 
similar to a regal and these are

00:05:27.129 --> 00:05:29.640 
similar to a regal and these are
spring-loaded<00:05:28.029> vices<00:05:28.569> they<00:05:29.139> have<00:05:29.259> a<00:05:29.289> lot<00:05:29.620> of

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:29.650 
spring-loaded vices they have a lot of

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:31.409 
spring-loaded vices they have a lot of
holding<00:05:30.069> power<00:05:30.250> and<00:05:30.550> whenever<00:05:31.210> they're

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:31.419 
holding power and whenever they're

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:33.749 
holding power and whenever they're
sitting<00:05:31.779> idle<00:05:32.080> the<00:05:32.500> jaws<00:05:32.830> are<00:05:33.099> clamped<00:05:33.550> tight

in order to open them you have to apply

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:38.399 
in order to open them you have to apply
pressure<00:05:36.400> to<00:05:36.580> the<00:05:36.759> grip<00:05:36.940> and<00:05:37.150> they<00:05:38.020> will<00:05:38.199> open

00:05:38.399 --> 00:05:38.409 
pressure to the grip and they will open

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:42.059 
pressure to the grip and they will open
slightly<00:05:40.050> when<00:05:41.050> it<00:05:41.139> comes<00:05:41.379> to<00:05:41.529> Dee<00:05:41.650> barbing
