00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.040
 well let's prepare a screencast in 

00:00:02.479 --> 00:00:07.900
 the one that we're going to explain how to eliminate 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:11.480
 this type of dirt from the images 

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:14.150
 that we have in our library is worth 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:16.490
 this is dirt that comes from most 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.870
 of the times comes from the goal of the 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.780
 camera 

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:23.380
 and we are going to explain an edit form 

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:25.460
 non-destructive to remove this society 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:29.840
 Well, the first thing we are going to do is 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:32.680
 create a new layer by clicking here 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:36.250
 we create a new blank layer 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:39.890
 now we are going to use this utility 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:43.150
 corrective brush tool punctual 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:45.730
 according to this tool 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:48.160
 we will be able to remove all these spots 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.420
 in a very simple way not that 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:53.320
 modification we are going to do here in 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:55.210
 this top layer because in this way 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.800
 we are not going to alter what is in the 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.630
 original layer of the top layer is 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.310
 blank but all the modifications 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:02.170
 we will do them in it and we will not modify 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:03.550
 this so that if we want to do 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.170
 disappear the modifications that we have 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:07.420
 done we will just have to hide the layer 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.550
 and it will be as good before we go to 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.300
 start 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:13.550
 we choose this utility 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:16.250
 here we select according to the content 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:17.960
 so that it goes so that it goes modifying 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.640
 now you will see it so that it 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.070
 modifying all these spots according to the 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.510
 content and to show it in all 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.030
 layers sample in all layers 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:27.830
 sorry because that because because although 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.120
 let's do it on this letter 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.130
 I want that comes also what is it 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:33.530
 there is in the layer below to make it 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.920
 here where the modification but having 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:39.090
 consider what is in the lower layer 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.090
 it will look very easy 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:45.250
 we just went over and 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:47.960
 disappears in each of the spots 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:50.869
 what do we have going on doing it 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.970
 and the spots disappear this 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:55.400
 way to do it is almost always the 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.260
 better but sometimes you can present 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:00.350
 some problem especially when the 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:02.540
 spots are at intersections of 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.280
 different colors etc. for example 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.979
 If there was a stain here, 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.360
 could cause a problem when it comes to 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:09.530
 try to correct it with this technique what 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.090
 let's see right now and so we 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.500
 we remove from doubts 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.160
 I'm going to put a spot here 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:19.260
 intentionally with the brush I will 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.269
 make a little spot here if I 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.060
 I would like to solve this with this 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:25.350
 technique what happened would be what 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.540
 following 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.130
 how have you taken the information from the layer 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.140
 lower 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:33.230
 and the surrounding area , because it has 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:36.420
 put here an artifact appeared that did not 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:38.790
 I should leave then in another way 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:42.100
 I'm going to undo we keep our same 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:44.120
 layer but we use the buffer 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.000
 to clone 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.530
 in agreement 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.970
 to do this we continue in the same 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:53.570
 transparent layer 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:57.020
 aligned with the sample and acting on 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:59.300
 the current layer and lower that why 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:00.650
 because because if the sample we will be able to 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:02.300
 catch from the bottom layer although not 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.500
 let's go changing layers even though 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.960
 we are in the upper layer we are going to 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:08.150
 be able to copy what is in the lower 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:09.920
 this is very simple with the with the 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.930
 tool is simply with the 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.900
 alt key we press where we want 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:17.390
 take the sample let's go here and now here 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:21.610
 As you can see, this appears 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:21.610
 he just lined it up he put me here 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.410
 and even corrected the other way 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:33.090
 It would have been a lot more complicated 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.590
 direct is already corrected already 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.030
 only we would have to do if 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:39.720
 we remove this we see that the 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:40.710
 failures of agreement return the spots already 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.130
 all we have to do is 

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:45.410
 save a copy of this image 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:46.760
 saving the previous one if we want or if already 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:49.810
 we want to load the previous one 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:52.850
 simply by merging these two layers 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:56.660
 simply giving command for an evil 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:58.520
 command or for pc controls we work 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:02.800
 with the one below and the image is already 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:02.800
 modified thank you very much
