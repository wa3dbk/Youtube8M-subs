00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
better look at the detail try to keep it

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.910 
better look at the detail try to keep it
and<00:01:32.640> focused<00:01:33.240> you<00:01:33.360> can't<00:01:33.570> go<00:01:33.659> too<00:01:33.720> close<00:01:34.020> but

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920

now these spin so I have to learn about
that<00:01:45.590> learning<00:01:46.590> curve<00:01:46.740> here<00:01:46.799> like<00:01:47.280> I<00:01:47.430> said

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
that learning curve here like I said

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.730 
that learning curve here like I said
there's<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.320> bottom<00:01:49.470> of<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:49.799> figure<00:01:51.740> pretty

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740
