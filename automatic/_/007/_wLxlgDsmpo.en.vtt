00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 the girls very good guys only 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.060
 How are you doing? I hope you are all 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.490
 very well today I bring you the news that you 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.849
 angry this news is not an opinion 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:14.070
 mine this news is what I have 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.320
 commented an eye game engineer about 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.570
 will you and I think you tell me what 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:22.250
 you think about this phrase 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:23.960
 I 'm not going to say it yet 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.010
 from the source of the news that you have 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.570
 in the description we have received a 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:29.840
 information that is quite surprising 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:32.689
 because it's about a tweet published by 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:36.680
 an engineer from james who calls willy 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:38.720
 of trash it's about pop your email will 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.449
 who is james software engineer 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:44.420
 who has harshly criticized wii for 

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:46.910
 be less powerful than xbox 360 and lacking 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.970
 of feasibility for super publishers 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:53.030
 wild that who according to his profile 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:54.530
 in linkedin he is a senior engineer in a 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.220
 sorry in software the director of 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.040
 electronic arts 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.360
 has launched its water attack through the 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.580
 twitter in response to messages 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.770
 related to the current lack of 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:09.540
 development for wii by james 

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:12.390
 You already know what has been said about 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.990
 they are not going to do any games for 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:19.690
 this console and this then to be able 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:21.910
 add a little more charcoal to 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.890
 barbecue because he said it is a 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:24.820
 garbage or a little bit wider is a 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.530
 shit 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:29.350
 that bothers me a lot but good 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:31.150
 has also commented this engineer that 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.650
 the nintendo platforms have always 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:35.890
 been very unprofitable for the 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:38.050
 developers only mario and zelda dan 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.610
 money is also true that the 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:41.980
 engineer has taken to criticize 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.410
 the internal hardware philosophy of 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:46.690
 nintendo with wii compared to their 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:49.780
 current rivals that are sony microsoft 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:51.490
 apple google for example everything follows the 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.070
 same philosophy that is to offer 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:56.260
 something standard with huawei with hardware 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:58.510
 powerful and focused on software and 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:02.730
 nintendo services is still running 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:02.730
 as if we were in 1990 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:09.619
 I will not read more 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:12.950
 I will not read more because it has fabric I 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:15.500
 you know and nintendo I really like 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.550
 I've always had it at home 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:21.390

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:24.090
 he's awesome as an engineer 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:26.160
 another company may come to criticize 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:29.580
 as hard as one because it is a 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:31.800
 console like others maybe not 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.320
 has the same characteristics as 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.810
 consoles that we have at home but it's a 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:39.120
 console that we offer 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:42.870
 entertainment you can criticize 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:45.950
 dislike of an imbecile console is that 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:49.370

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:51.440
