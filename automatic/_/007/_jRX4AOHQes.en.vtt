00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.540
 hello everyone I'm here in a new 

00:00:04.229 --> 00:00:11.370
 Trojan and I'm going to show you how 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:13.469
 render in 4k with sony vegas 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.439
 I think it works with any sound 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:19.050
 I'm 13 and well, well, let's go 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:22.070
 to start I already added a video what 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.900
 you have to do is point out the part that 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:27.260
 You want to analyze, for example, with 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.330
 a small part 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:31.720
 and what you have to do is give this 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:31.720
 here 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:40.770
 from here to this arrow work x puts 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:45.400
 2 and 4 below 64 here you give 4 below 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:47.400
 this has to see that you have 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:50.400
 square 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:53.300
 and that we have to put it in 29 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.300
 you must apply 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.960
 and accept 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.539
 do not 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.540
 once this is done what we have to 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:09.070
 do is 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.070
 of the render as 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:17.369
 and from here I was already lacking here 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.369
 where do you put windows 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:24.650
 be here, you have to do it 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:28.150
 is to select any of these 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.150
 of the template 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:33.799
 you go to bible 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:36.030
 and in image size you give to keep 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:39.740
 original size 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.740
 you give to accept 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:42.970
 and you give him to perform 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.200
 title 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.960
 anyone 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.950
 and you 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.909
 as the four fields will take longer 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.740
 weather 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.259
 and then this will depend on your 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.520
 computer if it's worth putting four 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.170
 each one 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:09.380
 and well, this has been the tutorial 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:09.380
 I hope I have served you and to another
