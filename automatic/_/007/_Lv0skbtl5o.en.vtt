00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:15.990
 a shadow of the colossus teach how it is 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.890
 that makes to kill the first giant 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.890
 right here 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:28.310
 For those who do not know how it would be 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:32.949
 Difficult does not know how to download 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:38.360
 the only giants you tighten ball 

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:42.019
 Lyon showing which has the thinnest 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:43.909
 sword has been pointing here 

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:46.809
 it's only you to follow that sword bill 

00:00:43.909 --> 00:00:50.059
 very thin you will arrive the first 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:53.140
 giant even suits others 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:53.140
 Giants understood 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.650
 it already is based on every time you 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:10.740
 find the first or other giants 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:14.150
 first will close the screen is touch the 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.150
 music and suspense 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:24.890
 When I did that, you 're already in place. 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.890
 Giant right 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.960
 ae 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:53.800
 is your first giant 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:57.500
 is that in another video lessons that I will do 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:03:01.910
 show how the other 15 spend 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:05.470
 giants actually watched giant right 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:09.130
 The hardest that I found was the last one. 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:09.130
 very difficult 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.739
 This act is easy, right? 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.040
 what does not have much can find out 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:40.890
 it's just you jumping his leg in the hair 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.890
 always where he has hair 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:56.210
 there with a triangle and holding r1 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:04:01.480
 right of the square and is not connected is the 

00:03:56.210 --> 00:04:01.480
 second is for him to fall 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:12.820
 When he does that , it 's just you. 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:12.820
 came up now 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:30.020
 wait a little bit for the ball to end 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:33.100
 for the return match 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:41.460
 always when focus safe 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:41.460
 the r1 in time you hold it right 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:50.940
 Look, this is coming, always continue. 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:53.610
 up most of the time always 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:56.210
 weak point of the first is at least 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:56.210
 Head right? 

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:08.610
 on arriving just a little bit to 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:08.610
 he regain eye on her steel 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:23.039
 ae 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:38.290
 Ready's there the death of his first 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:40.830
 giant as I had said the first 

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:43.840
 giant did not have much difficulty or 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:46.650
 I do not know if to buy people who do not 

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:46.650
 know the game 

00:05:47.569 --> 00:05:55.360
 for those who already know the view of others 

00:05:51.949 --> 00:05:58.189
 giants much more difficult 

00:05:55.360 --> 00:06:02.800
 other giants have no comparison of 

00:05:58.189 --> 00:06:02.800
 difficulty that I play 

00:06:04.189 --> 00:06:10.849
 this is normal happen step who is 

00:06:07.249 --> 00:06:13.419
 knowing the game now it 's normal you 

00:06:10.849 --> 00:06:13.419
 did not die 

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:24.169
 will happen will happen whenever it 

00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:27.020
 in all the giants that takes you from 

00:06:24.169 --> 00:06:36.349
 back to his place of origin 

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:37.930
 Just save it here to show it to me. 

00:06:36.349 --> 00:06:41.959
 you 

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:44.089
 This mandatory damn save 

00:06:41.959 --> 00:06:48.429
 I found another alternative, I did not 

00:06:44.089 --> 00:06:48.429
 But there was no way 

00:06:50.929 --> 00:06:57.709
 continuation 

00:06:53.509 --> 00:07:03.259
 I'll show you there again 

00:06:57.709 --> 00:07:06.229
 where you got back there the spirit 

00:07:03.259 --> 00:07:14.949
 the first giant you've just 

00:07:06.229 --> 00:07:14.949
 Kill shows her the princess neither 

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:29.770
 these states each represent 

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:44.080
 a giant giant that you have just 

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:47.140
 kill is already bi little by little is already all 

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:48.970
 He already went to the right bag. 

00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:49.810
