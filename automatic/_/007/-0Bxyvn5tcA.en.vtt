00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
on the road in the future I mean this

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.690 
on the road in the future I mean this
factory<00:01:28.860> since<00:01:29.780> 1985<00:01:30.780> so<00:01:31.770> it's<00:01:31.950> a<00:01:32.130> pretty<00:01:32.460> long

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
factory since 1985 so it's a pretty long

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.860 
factory since 1985 so it's a pretty long
time<00:01:33.350> our<00:01:34.350> factory<00:01:34.920> it's<00:01:35.220> a<00:01:35.730> good<00:01:36.180> example<00:01:36.540> of

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:36.870 
time our factory it's a good example of

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:40.040 
time our factory it's a good example of
what<00:01:37.320> can<00:01:37.740> do<00:01:38.010> the<00:01:39.000> Italian<00:01:39.600> craftsmanship

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:40.050 
what can do the Italian craftsmanship

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:44.270 
what can do the Italian craftsmanship
and<00:01:40.670> how<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:41.729> technologies<00:01:42.690> we<00:01:43.500> can<00:01:43.860> match

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
and how the technologies we can match

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.800 
and how the technologies we can match
everything<00:01:45.290> in<00:01:46.290> good<00:01:47.280> example<00:01:48.090> of<00:01:48.150> quality

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
everything in good example of quality

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.980 
everything in good example of quality
and<00:01:48.990> performance<00:01:49.260> and<00:01:50.330> yeah<00:01:51.330> this<00:01:51.510> is<00:01:51.570> still

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
and performance and yeah this is still

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.380 
and performance and yeah this is still
an<00:01:52.320> Italian<00:01:52.890> factory<00:01:53.280> but<00:01:53.760> we<00:01:53.970> will<00:01:54.119> have

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
an Italian factory but we will have

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.330 
an Italian factory but we will have
anyway<00:01:55.020> a<00:01:55.320> big<00:01:56.190> help<00:01:56.490> from<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:58.340> LD

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
anyway a big help from the LD

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.090 
anyway a big help from the LD
technologies<00:01:59.940> the<00:02:00.930> main<00:02:01.170> thing<00:02:01.440> for<00:02:01.619> the<00:02:01.950> new

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
technologies the main thing for the new

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.370 
technologies the main thing for the new
car<00:02:02.430> in<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:02.700> future<00:02:03.030> I<00:02:03.060> think<00:02:03.420> it's<00:02:03.570> make<00:02:04.170> the

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
car in the future I think it's make the

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.830 
car in the future I think it's make the
car<00:02:04.619> lighter<00:02:05.070> as<00:02:05.490> lighter<00:02:06.060> as<00:02:06.300> possible

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
car lighter as lighter as possible

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.000 
car lighter as lighter as possible
because<00:02:07.500> that's<00:02:08.660> LED<00:02:09.660> let<00:02:10.260> possible<00:02:10.800> to

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:11.010 
because that's LED let possible to

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:13.400 
because that's LED let possible to
improve<00:02:11.340> the<00:02:11.580> performance<00:02:12.150> and<00:02:12.330> reduce<00:02:13.200> the

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
improve the performance and reduce the

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.170 
improve the performance and reduce the
pollution<00:02:13.680> I<00:02:14.070> think<00:02:14.640> that<00:02:14.760> it's<00:02:14.910> a<00:02:15.030> really

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
pollution I think that it's a really

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.949 
pollution I think that it's a really
good<00:02:15.840> opportunity<00:02:16.530> for<00:02:16.560> Lamborghini<00:02:16.950> to
