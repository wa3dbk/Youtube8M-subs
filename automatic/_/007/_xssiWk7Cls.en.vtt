package of the first thing we see is an

package of the first thing we see is an
e3<00:00:10.950> cute<00:00:11.309> store<00:00:11.550> business<00:00:11.759> card<00:00:12.120> it<00:00:12.389> has<00:00:12.450> a

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
e3 cute store business card it has a

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.180 
e3 cute store business card it has a
very<00:00:12.719> clean<00:00:13.049> design<00:00:13.349> and<00:00:13.559> I<00:00:13.590> like<00:00:13.769> the<00:00:13.889> purple

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
very clean design and I like the purple

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.129 
very clean design and I like the purple
on<00:00:14.280> the<00:00:14.400> back<00:00:14.610> the<00:00:15.269> box<00:00:15.509> seems<00:00:15.839> to<00:00:15.990> be<00:00:16.109> very

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
on the back the box seems to be very

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.439 
on the back the box seems to be very
beat<00:00:16.740> up<00:00:16.890> but<00:00:17.279> I'm<00:00:17.490> not<00:00:17.640> too<00:00:17.820> worried<00:00:18.150> since

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
beat up but I'm not too worried since

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.240 
beat up but I'm not too worried since
I'm<00:00:18.779> sure<00:00:18.900> this<00:00:19.050> is<00:00:19.230> partly<00:00:19.470> because<00:00:19.590> the

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
I'm sure this is partly because the

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.640 
I'm sure this is partly because the
pyraminx<00:00:20.609> isn't<00:00:20.939> really<00:00:21.150> cubicle<00:00:21.630> puzzle<00:00:21.960> so

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
pyraminx isn't really cubicle puzzle so

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.769 
pyraminx isn't really cubicle puzzle so
I<00:00:23.070> expect<00:00:23.640> a<00:00:23.730> little<00:00:23.939> bit<00:00:24.060> damage<00:00:24.300> to<00:00:24.449> the<00:00:24.539> box

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
I expect a little bit damage to the box

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.290 
I expect a little bit damage to the box
hopefully<00:00:25.350> the<00:00:25.470> puzzle<00:00:25.740> is<00:00:25.830> fine<00:00:26.300> looking

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
hopefully the puzzle is fine looking

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.279 
hopefully the puzzle is fine looking
inside<00:00:27.420> we<00:00:27.689> first<00:00:27.900> see<00:00:28.019> a<00:00:28.050> pamphlet

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
inside we first see a pamphlet

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.230 
inside we first see a pamphlet
describing<00:00:28.800> how<00:00:29.220> to<00:00:29.279> solve<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:29.820> pier<00:00:30.029> makes

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
describing how to solve the pier makes

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.680 
describing how to solve the pier makes
as<00:00:30.420> well<00:00:31.019> as<00:00:31.170> different<00:00:31.619> types<00:00:31.800> of<00:00:31.949> pieces<00:00:32.399> and

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:32.690 
as well as different types of pieces and

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:35.150 
as well as different types of pieces and
finally<00:00:33.690> we<00:00:33.840> get<00:00:34.020> to<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.320> actual<00:00:34.649> pyraminx

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
finally we get to the actual pyraminx

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.740 
finally we get to the actual pyraminx
the<00:00:35.610> first<00:00:35.850> thing<00:00:35.969> I<00:00:36.030> noticed<00:00:36.360> is<00:00:36.450> that<00:00:36.510> the

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
the first thing I noticed is that the

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.810 
the first thing I noticed is that the
stickers<00:00:37.079> are<00:00:37.230> very<00:00:37.590> very<00:00:38.040> nice<00:00:38.309> they're

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
stickers are very very nice they're

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.729 
stickers are very very nice they're
quite<00:00:39.420> similar<00:00:39.719> to<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:39.960> stickers<00:00:40.230> i<00:00:40.350> have<00:00:40.530> on

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
quite similar to the stickers i have on

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.740 
quite similar to the stickers i have on
my<00:00:40.770> current<00:00:41.070> main<00:00:41.399> which<00:00:41.640> is<00:00:41.760> e<00:00:41.790> QJ<00:00:42.180> pyraminx

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
my current main which is e QJ pyraminx

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.510 
my current main which is e QJ pyraminx
and<00:00:43.020> you'll<00:00:43.440> notice<00:00:43.739> that<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:44.160> orange<00:00:44.430> is

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
and you'll notice that the orange is

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.369 
and you'll notice that the orange is
sort<00:00:44.730> of<00:00:44.789> this<00:00:44.940> fluorescent<00:00:45.480> orange<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:46.170> blue

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
sort of this fluorescent orange the blue

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.260 
sort of this fluorescent orange the blue
is<00:00:46.410> a<00:00:46.530> bright<00:00:46.770> blue<00:00:46.980> fluorescent<00:00:47.700> green<00:00:47.820> and

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
is a bright blue fluorescent green and

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.209 
is a bright blue fluorescent green and
then<00:00:48.390> fluorescent<00:00:48.989> yellow<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.710> pieces<00:00:50.190> seem

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
then fluorescent yellow the pieces seem

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.920 
then fluorescent yellow the pieces seem
to<00:00:50.460> be<00:00:50.579> pretty<00:00:51.030> lubed<00:00:51.360> and<00:00:51.539> actually<00:00:51.840> the

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
to be pretty lubed and actually the

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.660 
to be pretty lubed and actually the
stickers<00:00:52.230> are<00:00:52.350> very<00:00:52.559> oily<00:00:52.770> so<00:00:53.250> I'll<00:00:53.460> have<00:00:53.640> to

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
stickers are very oily so I'll have to

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.330 
stickers are very oily so I'll have to
clean<00:00:53.940> that<00:00:54.059> up<00:00:54.120> first<00:00:54.750> turns<00:00:55.110> I'm<00:00:55.829> not<00:00:56.190> really

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
clean that up first turns I'm not really

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.430 
clean that up first turns I'm not really
digging<00:00:56.610> this<00:00:56.850> puzzle<00:00:57.210> too<00:00:57.390> much<00:00:57.690> I<00:00:58.020> think

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
digging this puzzle too much I think

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.650 
digging this puzzle too much I think
it's<00:00:58.620> a<00:00:58.770> little<00:00:58.980> tight<00:00:59.190> and<00:00:59.399> its<00:01:00.090> way<00:01:00.390> to<00:01:00.449> you

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
it's a little tight and its way to you

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.750 
it's a little tight and its way to you
cookie<00:01:01.020> for<00:01:01.260> me<00:01:01.440> but<00:01:02.100> it<00:01:02.219> does<00:01:02.370> seem<00:01:02.520> very

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
cookie for me but it does seem very

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.640 
cookie for me but it does seem very
stable<00:01:03.090> and<00:01:03.359> again<00:01:04.049> I<00:01:04.140> really<00:01:04.379> like<00:01:04.530> the

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
stable and again I really like the

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.200 
stable and again I really like the
colors<00:01:04.920> and<00:01:04.949> I<00:01:05.159> just<00:01:05.309> like<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.610> overall<00:01:05.880> feel

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
colors and I just like the overall feel

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.510 
colors and I just like the overall feel
of<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.570> cube<00:01:06.780> in<00:01:06.960> my<00:01:07.080> hand<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.979> tips<00:01:08.250> turn

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
of the cube in my hand the tips turn

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.170 
of the cube in my hand the tips turn
very<00:01:08.850> well<00:01:09.210> and<00:01:09.479> I<00:01:10.200> really<00:01:10.650> like<00:01:11.189> them<00:01:11.430> what

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
very well and I really like them what

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.280 
very well and I really like them what
you're<00:01:12.299> watching<00:01:12.420> right<00:01:12.600> now<00:01:12.750> is<00:01:13.020> an<00:01:13.140> average

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
you're watching right now is an average

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.050 
you're watching right now is an average
of<00:01:13.500> five<00:01:13.650> with<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:13.950> shank<00:01:14.280> out<00:01:14.430> pyraminx<00:01:14.850> I

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
of five with the shank out pyraminx I

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.460 
of five with the shank out pyraminx I
did<00:01:15.270> loosen<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.720> tensions<00:01:16.080> and<00:01:16.259> I<00:01:16.380> actually

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
did loosen the tensions and I actually

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.020 
did loosen the tensions and I actually
found<00:01:16.770> one<00:01:16.890> of<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.130> screws<00:01:17.400> to<00:01:17.430> be<00:01:17.670> stripped

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
found one of the screws to be stripped

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.609 
found one of the screws to be stripped
the<00:01:18.390> screw<00:01:18.630> head<00:01:18.869> was<00:01:19.080> actually<00:01:19.470> just

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
the screw head was actually just

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.740 
the screw head was actually just
circular<00:01:20.310> so<00:01:20.549> it<00:01:20.909> was<00:01:21.030> very<00:01:21.060> difficult<00:01:21.390> for<00:01:21.630> me

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
circular so it was very difficult for me

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.929 
circular so it was very difficult for me
to<00:01:21.960> loosen<00:01:22.229> that<00:01:22.380> single<00:01:22.740> side<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.460> rest<00:01:23.700> of

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
to loosen that single side the rest of

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.190 
to loosen that single side the rest of
the<00:01:24.060> puzzle<00:01:24.390> seems<00:01:24.570> to<00:01:24.689> be<00:01:24.810> a<00:01:24.840> very<00:01:24.900> good

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
the puzzle seems to be a very good

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.140 
the puzzle seems to be a very good
condition<00:01:25.740> and<00:01:25.950> overall<00:01:26.340> I<00:01:26.369> really<00:01:26.520> like<00:01:26.970> the

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
condition and overall I really like the

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.390 
condition and overall I really like the
feel<00:01:27.390> of<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.780> puzzle<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.590> turning<00:01:28.950> is<00:01:29.100> pretty

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
feel of the puzzle the turning is pretty

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.130 
feel of the puzzle the turning is pretty
fast<00:01:29.729> and<00:01:30.030> it's<00:01:30.299> actually<00:01:30.600> quite<00:01:30.720> smooth

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
fast and it's actually quite smooth

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.620 
fast and it's actually quite smooth
despite<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.100> clicks<00:01:32.400> however<00:01:33.030> i<00:01:33.150> think<00:01:33.299> the

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
despite the clicks however i think the

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.420 
despite the clicks however i think the
clicks<00:01:33.869> are<00:01:34.049> somewhat<00:01:34.650> annoying<00:01:34.920> right<00:01:35.369> now

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
clicks are somewhat annoying right now

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.280 
clicks are somewhat annoying right now
since<00:01:35.880> i<00:01:35.970> haven't<00:01:36.090> really<00:01:36.329> broken<00:01:36.509> it<00:01:36.810> in<00:01:36.930> i'll

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
since i haven't really broken it in i'll

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.960 
since i haven't really broken it in i'll
have<00:01:37.560> to<00:01:37.680> work<00:01:38.070> with<00:01:38.250> that<00:01:38.400> a<00:01:38.430> little<00:01:38.610> bit<00:01:38.790> more

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
have to work with that a little bit more

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.819 
have to work with that a little bit more
before<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.390> review<00:01:39.720> but<00:01:40.259> overall<00:01:40.530> first

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
before the review but overall first

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.440 
before the review but overall first
impressions<00:01:41.369> i<00:01:41.460> really<00:01:41.729> like<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:42.090> shang<00:01:42.299> xiao

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
impressions i really like the shang xiao

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.149 
impressions i really like the shang xiao
pyraminx<00:01:42.869> even<00:01:43.200> though<00:01:43.320> my<00:01:43.470> times<00:01:43.740> on<00:01:43.890> it<00:01:44.040> are

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
pyraminx even though my times on it are

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.429 
pyraminx even though my times on it are
nowhere<00:01:44.579> as<00:01:44.759> good<00:01:44.970> as<00:01:45.329> on<00:01:45.509> my<00:01:45.630> main<00:01:45.869> which<00:01:46.259> is<00:01:46.409> a

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
nowhere as good as on my main which is a

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.370 
nowhere as good as on my main which is a
QJ<00:01:46.890> but<00:01:47.579> again<00:01:47.970> before<00:01:48.630> i<00:01:48.810> do<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:49.049> review<00:01:49.290> i'm

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
QJ but again before i do the review i'm

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.840 
QJ but again before i do the review i'm
going<00:01:49.530> to<00:01:49.590> be<00:01:49.649> doing<00:01:49.710> hundreds<00:01:50.130> of<00:01:50.189> salts<00:01:50.520> so

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
going to be doing hundreds of salts so

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.670 
going to be doing hundreds of salts so
hopefully<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:51.780> puzzle<00:01:52.200> becomes<00:01:52.470> a<00:01:52.560> lot

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
hopefully the puzzle becomes a lot

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.320 
hopefully the puzzle becomes a lot
better<00:01:52.829> and<00:01:53.130> until<00:01:53.939> then<00:01:54.320> toodles
