a reinforcement for the board but also
to<00:01:52.900> elevate<00:01:53.530> the<00:01:54.160> rear<00:01:54.400> of<00:01:54.640> the<00:01:54.790> board<00:01:55.030> so<00:01:55.300> that

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:55.480 
to elevate the rear of the board so that

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.300 
to elevate the rear of the board so that
it's<00:01:55.600> at<00:01:55.840> an<00:01:56.080> angle<00:01:56.590> so<00:01:56.770> that<00:01:56.800> it<00:01:57.040> has<00:01:57.190> an

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
it's at an angle so that it has an

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.870 
it's at an angle so that it has an
incline<00:01:57.700> toward<00:01:58.120> the<00:01:58.270> end<00:01:58.480> just<00:01:58.960> as<00:01:59.170> elevation

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.790 
three long planks of the board which
have<00:02:10.300> a<00:02:10.330> little<00:02:10.630> bit<00:02:10.750> of<00:02:10.840> give<00:02:11.080> in<00:02:11.110> them<00:02:11.470> when

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
have a little bit of give in them when

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.700 
have a little bit of give in them when
you<00:02:11.890> step<00:02:12.160> on<00:02:12.340> them<00:02:12.550> to<00:02:12.910> engage<00:02:13.720> a<00:02:13.750> pedal<00:02:14.230> so

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:14.710 
you step on them to engage a pedal so

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:16.440 
you step on them to engage a pedal so
they<00:02:14.980> need<00:02:15.220> a<00:02:15.490> little<00:02:15.730> something<00:02:16.180> to<00:02:16.210> give

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
they need a little something to give

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.000 
they need a little something to give
them<00:02:16.630> a<00:02:16.720> little<00:02:16.870> bit<00:02:17.020> more<00:02:17.080> strength<00:02:17.590> so<00:02:17.860> we'll

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
them a little bit more strength so we'll

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.700 
them a little bit more strength so we'll
run<00:02:18.220> that<00:02:18.370> board<00:02:18.640> across<00:02:18.880> the<00:02:19.180> back<00:02:19.710> to

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:20.710 
run that board across the back to

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:22.620 
run that board across the back to
reinforce<00:02:21.220> the<00:02:21.460> three<00:02:21.700> main<00:02:21.940> long<00:02:22.210> boards

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
reinforce the three main long boards

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:26.220 
reinforce the three main long boards
here<00:02:22.900> and<00:02:23.110> then<00:02:23.860> finally<00:02:24.400> I<00:02:24.960> wanted<00:02:25.960> initially

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
here and then finally I wanted initially

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.160 
here and then finally I wanted initially
to<00:02:26.740> get<00:02:26.890> rubber<00:02:27.220> feet<00:02:27.580> for<00:02:28.480> the<00:02:28.570> bottom<00:02:28.900> of<00:02:29.020> the

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
to get rubber feet for the bottom of the

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.400 
to get rubber feet for the bottom of the
board<00:02:29.700> but<00:02:30.700> you<00:02:31.120> would<00:02:31.360> be<00:02:31.510> amazed<00:02:31.990> at<00:02:32.380> how

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
board but you would be amazed at how

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.810 
board but you would be amazed at how
difficult<00:02:32.830> it<00:02:33.400> is<00:02:34.180> to<00:02:34.510> find<00:02:35.050> rubber<00:02:35.680> feet<00:02:36.010> that

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820 
difficult it is to find rubber feet that

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.000 
difficult it is to find rubber feet that
you<00:02:36.940> can<00:02:37.120> screw<00:02:37.600> that<00:02:38.020> have<00:02:38.170> washers<00:02:38.650> in<00:02:38.830> them

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
you can screw that have washers in them

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.240 
you can screw that have washers in them
at<00:02:39.370> local<00:02:39.940> stores<00:02:40.390> I<00:02:41.200> looked<00:02:41.740> at<00:02:41.830> Walmart

those<00:03:28.390> rubber<00:03:28.660> rubber<00:03:29.560> grommets<00:03:30.100> so<00:03:30.670> I'm

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 
those rubber rubber grommets so I'm

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.480 
those rubber rubber grommets so I'm
hoping<00:03:32.020> that<00:03:32.080> they<00:03:32.290> work<00:03:32.470> I<00:03:32.770> mean<00:03:33.130> after<00:03:33.160> all

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:33.490 
hoping that they work I mean after all

hoping that they work I mean after all
this<00:03:33.730> is<00:03:33.910> a<00:03:34.020> this<00:03:35.020> is<00:03:35.080> a<00:03:35.230> hack<00:03:35.440> job<00:03:36.030> so<00:03:37.200> we'll

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
this is a this is a hack job so we'll

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.470 
this is a this is a hack job so we'll
put<00:03:38.380> it<00:03:38.470> together<00:03:38.590> and<00:03:39.040> after<00:03:39.819> assembly<00:03:40.330> we'll

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
put it together and after assembly we'll

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.440 
put it together and after assembly we'll
see<00:03:40.720> okay<00:03:41.709> now<00:03:42.100> I've<00:03:42.280> got<00:03:42.520> the<00:03:42.640> reinforcement

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
see okay now I've got the reinforcement

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:45.090 
see okay now I've got the reinforcement
bar<00:03:43.480> installed<00:03:44.200> as<00:03:44.440> you<00:03:44.500> can<00:03:44.709> see<00:03:44.920> I<00:03:44.950> just

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:45.100 
bar installed as you can see I just

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.800 
bar installed as you can see I just
basically<00:03:45.730> took<00:03:45.880> a<00:03:46.030> couple<00:03:46.209> screws<00:03:46.540> and

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
basically took a couple screws and

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.430 
basically took a couple screws and
screwed<00:03:47.080> it<00:03:47.170> through<00:03:47.520> so<00:03:48.520> now<00:03:48.640> this<00:03:48.850> middle

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
screwed it through so now this middle

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.770 
screwed it through so now this middle
these<00:03:50.440> sections<00:03:50.920> of<00:03:51.040> wood<00:03:51.300> don't<00:03:52.300> stand<00:03:52.630> any

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780 
these sections of wood don't stand any

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.360 
these sections of wood don't stand any
chance<00:03:52.930> of<00:03:53.260> flexing<00:03:53.680> when<00:03:53.800> I<00:03:53.830> step<00:03:54.130> on<00:03:54.280> them

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
chance of flexing when I step on them

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.370 
chance of flexing when I step on them
right<00:03:57.370> now<00:03:57.430> I<00:03:57.700> have<00:03:58.180> also<00:03:58.480> installed<00:03:59.020> the

right now I have also installed the

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:03.030 
right now I have also installed the
second<00:03:59.980> support<00:04:00.580> bar<00:04:01.170> across<00:04:02.170> the<00:04:02.290> back<00:04:02.650> here
