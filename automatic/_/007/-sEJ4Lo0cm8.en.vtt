00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:12.440 
hey guys it's Jodi and I want to show
you<00:00:05.220> this<00:00:05.640> new<00:00:09.170> virtual<00:00:10.170> joystick<00:00:11.450> technology

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
you this new virtual joystick technology

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.189 
you this new virtual joystick technology
or<00:00:12.630> whatever<00:00:12.990> that<00:00:13.290> I've<00:00:13.469> come<00:00:13.799> up<00:00:13.830> with<00:00:15.199> I

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
or whatever that I've come up with I

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.300 
or whatever that I've come up with I
think<00:00:16.920> it's<00:00:17.130> way<00:00:17.369> better<00:00:17.609> than<00:00:17.970> what<00:00:19.310> most

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
think it's way better than what most

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:26.060 
think it's way better than what most
games<00:00:20.670> are<00:00:21.000> possibly<00:00:21.570> all<00:00:21.810> games<00:00:22.140> use<00:00:22.769> so<00:00:25.070> I've

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
games are possibly all games use so I've

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.970 
games are possibly all games use so I've
got<00:00:26.250> this<00:00:26.430> purple<00:00:26.900> area<00:00:27.900> here<00:00:28.320> which<00:00:28.590> is<00:00:28.619> like

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
got this purple area here which is like

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.380 
got this purple area here which is like
the<00:00:29.340> this<00:00:30.140> rectangle<00:00:31.140> where<00:00:31.769> if<00:00:32.610> you<00:00:32.880> touch<00:00:33.149> in

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
the this rectangle where if you touch in

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.930 
the this rectangle where if you touch in
there<00:00:33.600> that's<00:00:34.020> that's<00:00:34.980> when<00:00:35.250> you'll<00:00:35.430> control

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
there that's that's when you'll control

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.830 
there that's that's when you'll control
the<00:00:36.180> joystick<00:00:36.829> I've<00:00:37.829> got<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.250> yellow<00:00:38.840> circle

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
the joystick I've got the yellow circle

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.619 
the joystick I've got the yellow circle
which<00:00:40.140> is<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:42.739> basically<00:00:44.149> you<00:00:45.149> know<00:00:45.270> you<00:00:45.300> move

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
which is the basically you know you move

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.260 
which is the basically you know you move
within<00:00:45.989> it<00:00:46.320> to<00:00:46.710> move<00:00:47.309> your<00:00:47.520> analog<00:00:47.879> stick

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
within it to move your analog stick

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.740 
within it to move your analog stick
around<00:00:48.500> and<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:50.010> red<00:00:50.280> circle<00:00:50.820> is<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.390> current

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
around and the red circle is the current

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.010 
around and the red circle is the current
position<00:00:52.730> inside<00:00:53.730> you<00:00:54.210> know<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.690> current

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
position inside you know the current

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.319 
position inside you know the current
value<00:00:55.379> of<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.739> stick<00:00:56.039> and<00:00:56.820> so<00:00:57.600> you<00:00:58.109> can<00:00:58.350> see

00:00:59.319 --> 00:00:59.329 
value of the stick and so you can see

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:02.389 
value of the stick and so you can see
wherever<00:01:00.329> I<00:01:00.600> tap<00:01:01.140> this<00:01:01.710> is<00:01:01.949> something<00:01:02.370> that

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
wherever I tap this is something that

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.240 
wherever I tap this is something that
games<00:01:02.850> already<00:01:03.270> do<00:01:03.600> you<00:01:04.110> know<00:01:04.260> it<00:01:04.530> centers<00:01:04.979> my

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
games already do you know it centers my

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.830 
games already do you know it centers my
joystick<00:01:06.020> move<00:01:07.020> it<00:01:07.170> around<00:01:07.290> you<00:01:08.250> know<00:01:08.600> the<00:01:09.600> new

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
joystick move it around you know the new

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.100 
joystick move it around you know the new
things<00:01:10.619> I<00:01:10.830> added<00:01:11.070> were<00:01:11.570> when<00:01:12.570> I<00:01:12.689> go<00:01:12.900> outside

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
things I added were when I go outside

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.480 
things I added were when I go outside
the<00:01:13.860> range<00:01:14.159> of<00:01:14.430> this<00:01:14.670> stick<00:01:15.590> it<00:01:16.590> drags<00:01:17.009> it<00:01:17.280> with

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
the range of this stick it drags it with

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:23.570 
the range of this stick it drags it with
it<00:01:17.930> so<00:01:18.930> that<00:01:19.140> way<00:01:19.909> no<00:01:20.909> matter<00:01:21.060> what<00:01:22.430> you<00:01:23.430> know

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
it so that way no matter what you know

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.170 
it so that way no matter what you know
you're<00:01:24.390> always<00:01:24.630> got<00:01:25.280> you<00:01:26.280> always<00:01:26.580> can<00:01:26.820> kind<00:01:27.090> of

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
you're always got you always can kind of

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.880 
you're always got you always can kind of
know<00:01:27.450> where<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.840> center<00:01:28.140> of<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:28.409> stick<00:01:28.680> is

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
know where the center of the stick is

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.060 
know where the center of the stick is
because<00:01:29.790> you<00:01:29.970> might<00:01:30.180> be<00:01:30.360> playing<00:01:30.659> a<00:01:30.869> game<00:01:31.070> and

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
because you might be playing a game and

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.249 
because you might be playing a game and
then<00:01:32.670> without<00:01:33.000> thinking<00:01:33.509> you're<00:01:33.689> some<00:01:33.990> kind

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
then without thinking you're some kind

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.399 
then without thinking you're some kind
of<00:01:34.320> like<00:01:34.560> moves<00:01:34.920> outside<00:01:35.610> of<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:36.380> you<00:01:37.380> know

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
of like moves outside of the you know

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.069 
of like moves outside of the you know
the<00:01:37.860> range<00:01:38.130> and<00:01:38.939> then<00:01:39.090> it'll<00:01:39.210> kind<00:01:39.450> of<00:01:39.509> slide

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
the range and then it'll kind of slide

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:47.030 
the range and then it'll kind of slide
to<00:01:40.530> adjust<00:01:43.549> so<00:01:44.960> there's<00:01:45.960> also<00:01:46.140> this<00:01:46.680> little

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
to adjust so there's also this little

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.330 
to adjust so there's also this little
bitty<00:01:48.030> feature<00:01:48.479> here<00:01:49.049> there's<00:01:49.860> kind<00:01:50.130> of<00:01:50.189> like

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
bitty feature here there's kind of like

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.190 
bitty feature here there's kind of like
an<00:01:50.460> extra<00:01:50.640> padding<00:01:52.070> so<00:01:53.070> that<00:01:53.399> your<00:01:54.200> circle

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
an extra padding so that your circle

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.959 
an extra padding so that your circle
can't<00:01:55.470> get<00:01:55.710> right<00:01:55.920> up<00:01:56.100> against<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:56.610> edge<00:01:56.640> of

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
can't get right up against the edge of

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.800 
can't get right up against the edge of
the<00:01:57.119> screen<00:01:57.530> because<00:01:58.530> your<00:01:58.710> thumb<00:01:59.070> kind<00:01:59.369> of

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
the screen because your thumb kind of

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.090 
the screen because your thumb kind of
you<00:02:00.810> know<00:02:00.930> it'll<00:02:01.229> eventually<00:02:01.530> stop

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
you know it'll eventually stop

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.010 
you know it'll eventually stop
registering<00:02:02.850> your<00:02:02.969> thumb<00:02:03.270> so<00:02:03.570> it<00:02:03.689> just<00:02:03.899> helps

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
registering your thumb so it just helps

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.810 
registering your thumb so it just helps
it<00:02:04.290> work<00:02:04.500> a<00:02:04.649> little<00:02:04.770> better<00:02:05.040> when<00:02:05.369> you<00:02:05.460> get<00:02:05.640> to

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
it work a little better when you get to

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:11.029 
it work a little better when you get to
the<00:02:06.380> edges<00:02:08.119> so

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
the edges so

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.429 
the edges so
hope<00:02:11.129> that<00:02:11.370> somebody<00:02:11.790> will<00:02:12.239> make<00:02:12.750> use<00:02:13.019> of<00:02:13.049> this

00:02:13.429 --> 00:02:13.439 
hope that somebody will make use of this

00:02:13.439 --> 00:02:16.039 
hope that somebody will make use of this
because<00:02:13.680> I<00:02:13.829> certainly<00:02:14.159> am<00:02:14.549> going<00:02:14.909> to<00:02:15.120> so<00:02:15.959> you

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
can see when I move outside it doesn't

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:25.789 
can see when I move outside it doesn't
control<00:02:18.420> it<00:02:18.629> I<00:02:18.950> move<00:02:19.950> back<00:02:20.060> it<00:02:21.060> does<00:02:24.799> it's

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:25.799
