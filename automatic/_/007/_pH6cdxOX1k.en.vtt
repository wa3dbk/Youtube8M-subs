daily<00:00:30.359> intake<00:00:30.510> and<00:00:31.309> like<00:00:32.309> for<00:00:32.430> example<00:00:32.520> if<00:00:32.969> you

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
daily intake and like for example if you

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.450 
daily intake and like for example if you
if<00:00:33.390> you<00:00:33.630> are<00:00:33.960> going<00:00:34.320> to<00:00:34.440> snag<00:00:34.800> a<00:00:34.829> lot<00:00:35.100> then<00:00:35.370> I

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
if you are going to snag a lot then I

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.970 
if you are going to snag a lot then I
recommend<00:00:35.969> that<00:00:36.030> you<00:00:36.120> get<00:00:36.840> healthy<00:00:37.350> healthy

snacks<00:00:38.489> like<00:00:38.730> for<00:00:38.910> example<00:00:38.969> here's<00:00:39.930> a

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
snacks like for example here's a

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.610 
snacks like for example here's a
vegetable<00:00:40.950> chip<00:00:41.280> based<00:00:41.610> snap<00:00:42.510> which<00:00:43.110> is

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
vegetable chip based snap which is

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.670 
vegetable chip based snap which is
cooked<00:00:44.040> in<00:00:44.280> vegetable<00:00:45.000> oil<00:00:45.469> so<00:00:46.469> that's

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
cooked in vegetable oil so that's

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.880 
cooked in vegetable oil so that's
already<00:00:46.940> reduces<00:00:47.940> your<00:00:48.030> LDL<00:00:48.450> intake<00:00:48.989> and<00:00:49.230> it's

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
already reduces your LDL intake and it's

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.250 
already reduces your LDL intake and it's
vegetable<00:00:50.489> so<00:00:50.640> it's<00:00:50.760> high<00:00:50.910> in<00:00:50.940> protein<00:00:51.360> high

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
vegetable so it's high in protein high

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.130 
vegetable so it's high in protein high
in<00:00:52.440> fats<00:00:52.770> and<00:00:53.160> fibers<00:00:54.030> because<00:00:54.480> fiber<00:00:54.719> is<00:00:55.110> a

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
in fats and fibers because fiber is a

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.350 
in fats and fibers because fiber is a
good<00:00:55.620> source<00:00:55.890> to<00:00:56.100> absorb<00:00:56.520> LDL<00:00:57.030> from<00:00:57.239> your

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
good source to absorb LDL from your

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.500 
good source to absorb LDL from your
blood<00:00:57.570> system<00:00:57.780> so<00:00:58.170> that<00:00:58.199> you<00:00:58.590> can<00:00:58.800> get<00:00:58.949> less

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 
blood system so that you can get less

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.319 
blood system so that you can get less
LDL<00:01:00.510> deposit<00:01:01.469> into<00:01:01.649> your<00:01:01.680> vessels<00:01:02.160> so<00:01:02.730> when

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
LDL deposit into your vessels so when

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.690 
LDL deposit into your vessels so when
you're<00:01:03.449> thinking<00:01:03.480> about<00:01:03.870> snacking<00:01:04.680> or<00:01:05.129> eating
