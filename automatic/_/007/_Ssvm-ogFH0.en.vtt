we're going to go ahead and try this

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.960 
we're going to go ahead and try this
recipe<00:01:03.180> out<00:01:04.250> okay<00:01:05.250> so<00:01:05.309> here's<00:01:05.640> what's<00:01:05.850> your

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
recipe out okay so here's what's your

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.190 
recipe out okay so here's what's your
solution<00:01:06.240> is<00:01:06.450> going<00:01:06.659> to<00:01:06.720> look<00:01:06.840> like<00:01:06.869> I<00:01:07.140> just

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
solution is going to look like I just

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.560 
solution is going to look like I just
put<00:01:07.619> mine<00:01:07.799> in<00:01:07.830> a<00:01:08.159> bowl<00:01:08.369> you<00:01:08.400> put<00:01:08.790> yours<00:01:08.970> in<00:01:09.210> a

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
put mine in a bowl you put yours in a

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.600 
put mine in a bowl you put yours in a
bottom<00:01:10.260> of<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.380> spray<00:01:10.650> and<00:01:10.890> eyes<00:01:10.979> have<00:01:11.220> my<00:01:11.340> rag

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
bottom of the spray and eyes have my rag

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.609 
bottom of the spray and eyes have my rag
and<00:01:11.970> we're<00:01:12.570> just<00:01:12.689> gonna<00:01:12.780> go<00:01:12.900> ahead<00:01:12.990> and<00:01:13.110> dip<00:01:13.470> it

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
and we're just gonna go ahead and dip it

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.320 
and we're just gonna go ahead and dip it
into<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:14.100> solution<00:01:14.369> and<00:01:14.700> then<00:01:14.790> rub<00:01:15.030> it<00:01:15.119> onto

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
into the solution and then rub it onto

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.760 
into the solution and then rub it onto
the<00:01:15.479> woods<00:01:15.750> I<00:01:15.960> want<00:01:16.170> to<00:01:16.229> show<00:01:16.350> you<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.530> area

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
the woods I want to show you the area

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.060 
the woods I want to show you the area
that<00:01:16.860> I'm<00:01:16.979> retreating<00:01:17.780> okay<00:01:18.780> so<00:01:18.840> we<00:01:19.140> are<00:01:19.170> on<00:01:19.439> my

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
that I'm retreating okay so we are on my

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.310 
that I'm retreating okay so we are on my
side<00:01:20.100> tables<00:01:20.970> and<00:01:21.210> you<00:01:21.299> can<00:01:21.479> see<00:01:21.689> right<00:01:21.869> here

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
side tables and you can see right here

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.560 
side tables and you can see right here
or<00:01:22.500> what's<00:01:22.920> kind<00:01:23.159> of<00:01:23.220> damage<00:01:23.580> so<00:01:24.119> that<00:01:24.330> is<00:01:24.479> the

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
or what's kind of damage so that is the

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.530 
or what's kind of damage so that is the
area<00:01:24.810> i'm<00:01:24.990> going<00:01:25.259> to<00:01:25.380> try<00:01:25.710> it<00:01:25.920> on<00:01:26.159> first<00:01:26.520> so<00:01:27.299> i'm

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
area i'm going to try it on first so i'm

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.109 
area i'm going to try it on first so i'm
just<00:01:27.570> going<00:01:27.900> to<00:01:27.960> take<00:01:28.110> my<00:01:28.170> rag<00:01:28.880> dip<00:01:29.880> it<00:01:30.030> in<00:01:30.090> a

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
just going to take my rag dip it in a

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.679 
just going to take my rag dip it in a
little<00:01:30.150> bit<00:01:30.450> of<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.600> solution<00:01:31.170> and<00:01:32.479> we're<00:01:33.479> go

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
little bit of the solution and we're go

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.219 
little bit of the solution and we're go
ahead<00:01:33.900> and<00:01:34.229> try<00:01:34.650> this<00:01:34.680> out<00:01:35.570> I'm<00:01:36.570> not<00:01:36.990> real<00:01:37.200> sure

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
ahead and try this out I'm not real sure

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.480 
ahead and try this out I'm not real sure
if<00:01:37.439> it<00:01:37.650> work<00:01:37.829> on<00:01:37.979> areas<00:01:38.369> like<00:01:38.520> that<00:01:38.810> or<00:01:40.490> we'll

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
if it work on areas like that or we'll

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.340 
if it work on areas like that or we'll
just<00:01:41.549> treat<00:01:42.060> all<00:01:42.240> this<00:01:42.630> maybe<00:01:42.930> I'll<00:01:43.079> just<00:01:43.170> do

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
just treat all this maybe I'll just do

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.440 
just treat all this maybe I'll just do
the<00:01:43.409> entire<00:01:43.829> thing<00:01:43.890> and<00:01:44.280> just<00:01:44.520> see<00:01:44.729> if<00:01:44.759> my<00:01:45.210> wood

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
the entire thing and just see if my wood

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:46.789 
the entire thing and just see if my wood
looks<00:01:45.659> new<00:01:45.869> because<00:01:46.110> that<00:01:46.320> is<00:01:46.470> definitely

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
looks new because that is definitely

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.639 
looks new because that is definitely
