is gonna feature less fiberglass than
what<00:00:29.850> we<00:00:29.970> would<00:00:30.150> see<00:00:30.330> in<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:30.480> one-point-six

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
what we would see in the one-point-six

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.369 
what we would see in the one-point-six
which<00:00:31.949> in<00:00:32.129> turn<00:00:32.309> makes<00:00:32.669> this<00:00:32.850> an<00:00:33.079> overall<00:00:34.079> more

00:00:34.369 --> 00:00:34.379 
which in turn makes this an overall more

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:37.129 
which in turn makes this an overall more
lightweight<00:00:34.649> and<00:00:35.100> more<00:00:35.339> responsive<00:00:35.909> stick<00:00:36.179> so

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:37.139 
lightweight and more responsive stick so

00:00:37.139 --> 00:00:38.719 
lightweight and more responsive stick so
for<00:00:37.409> the<00:00:37.469> first<00:00:37.649> time<00:00:37.949> in<00:00:38.069> the<00:00:38.129> supreme<00:00:38.519> line

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
solid hold on it now as we move further

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.840 
solid hold on it now as we move further
down<00:01:00.869> they<00:01:01.619> use<00:01:01.799> their<00:01:02.069> mid<00:01:02.249> kick<00:01:02.459> technology

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
down they use their mid kick technology

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
more consistent puck feel Hilo toe on

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.380 
more consistent puck feel Hilo toe on
top<00:01:46.439> of<00:01:46.590> that<00:01:46.740> they<00:01:47.039> use<00:01:47.189> their<00:01:47.399> 3k<00:01:48.149> carbon

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
top of that they use their 3k carbon

top of that they use their 3k carbon
weave<00:01:48.780> which<00:01:49.140> is<00:01:49.289> the<00:01:49.439> texture<00:01:49.770> that<00:01:49.920> we<00:01:50.069> see

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
weave which is the texture that we see

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.090 
weave which is the texture that we see
here<00:01:50.579> this<00:01:51.090> adds<00:01:51.390> to<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:52.020> lightweight<00:01:52.469> feel

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
here this adds to the lightweight feel

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.459 
here this adds to the lightweight feel
of<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:53.579> blade<00:01:53.880> which<00:01:54.359> in<00:01:54.539> turn<00:01:54.749> helps<00:01:55.229> balance

00:01:55.459 --> 00:01:55.469 
of the blade which in turn helps balance

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:57.440 
of the blade which in turn helps balance
out<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:55.950> stick<00:01:56.219> as<00:01:56.429> well<00:01:56.609> as<00:01:56.939> making<00:01:57.149> it<00:01:57.389> a

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
out the stick as well as making it a

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.700 
out the stick as well as making it a
little<00:01:57.600> more<00:01:57.719> rigid<00:01:58.020> helping<00:01:58.560> the

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
little more rigid helping the

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.859 
little more rigid helping the
responsiveness<00:01:59.280> going<00:02:00.119> in<00:02:00.270> the<00:02:00.359> overall<00:02:00.689> look

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
responsiveness going in the overall look

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.749 
responsiveness going in the overall look
and<00:02:01.020> feel<00:02:01.079> this<00:02:01.499> stick<00:02:01.740> it's<00:02:02.340> definitely

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
and feel this stick it's definitely

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.160 
and feel this stick it's definitely
gonna<00:02:02.850> be<00:02:02.969> a<00:02:03.119> little<00:02:03.420> more<00:02:03.509> lightweight<00:02:03.780> a

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
gonna be a little more lightweight a

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.379 
gonna be a little more lightweight a
little<00:02:04.499> more<00:02:04.619> balanced<00:02:05.009> in<00:02:05.159> the<00:02:05.310> one<00:02:05.520> six<00:02:05.819> this

00:02:06.379 --> 00:02:06.389 
little more balanced in the one six this

00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:08.270 
little more balanced in the one six this
is<00:02:06.600> due<00:02:06.780> to<00:02:06.810> them<00:02:07.499> using<00:02:07.889> a<00:02:07.950> little<00:02:08.100> less

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
is due to them using a little less

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.160 
is due to them using a little less
fiberglass<00:02:08.789> in<00:02:09.030> the<00:02:09.090> shaft<00:02:09.390> which<00:02:09.780> makes<00:02:10.019> it<00:02:10.140> a

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
fiberglass in the shaft which makes it a

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.030 
fiberglass in the shaft which makes it a
little<00:02:10.259> more<00:02:10.470> responsive<00:02:11.039> than<00:02:11.159> the<00:02:11.340> ones

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
little more responsive than the ones

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.130 
little more responsive than the ones
so<00:02:12.520> overall<00:02:12.850> it's<00:02:13.090> a<00:02:13.180> nice<00:02:13.420> lightweight<00:02:13.750> feel

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
so overall it's a nice lightweight feel

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:15.810 
so overall it's a nice lightweight feel
to<00:02:14.350> it<00:02:14.500> it's<00:02:14.710> gonna<00:02:14.830> be<00:02:15.010> pretty<00:02:15.190> durable<00:02:15.490> and

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:15.820 
to it it's gonna be pretty durable and

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:18.450 
to it it's gonna be pretty durable and
solid<00:02:16.270> as<00:02:16.420> well<00:02:16.590> the<00:02:17.590> color<00:02:17.800> scheme<00:02:18.100> is<00:02:18.130> pretty

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:18.460 
solid as well the color scheme is pretty

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:19.110 
solid as well the color scheme is pretty
cool<00:02:18.670> too

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
cool too

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.390 
cool too
a<00:02:19.150> big<00:02:19.510> fan<00:02:19.750> of<00:02:19.780> red<00:02:20.050> so<00:02:20.350> this<00:02:20.740> all<00:02:20.920> really<00:02:21.190> ties

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
a big fan of red so this all really ties

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.610 
a big fan of red so this all really ties
together<00:02:21.610> really<00:02:22.060> well<00:02:22.360> and<00:02:22.600> then<00:02:23.140> on<00:02:23.260> top<00:02:23.440> of

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
together really well and then on top of

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.320 
together really well and then on top of
that<00:02:23.680> that<00:02:23.890> the<00:02:24.160> grip<00:02:24.490> tech<00:02:24.790> and<00:02:25.030> the<00:02:25.120> tech

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
that that the grip tech and the tech

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.330 
that that the grip tech and the tech
spiral<00:02:25.840> really<00:02:26.110> adds<00:02:26.290> a<00:02:26.410> nice<00:02:26.650> firm<00:02:27.040> solid

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
spiral really adds a nice firm solid

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:28.740 
spiral really adds a nice firm solid
grip<00:02:27.670> so<00:02:27.880> I<00:02:27.940> think<00:02:28.030> they<00:02:28.270> did<00:02:28.390> a<00:02:28.510> good<00:02:28.690> job

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
grip so I think they did a good job

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.440 
grip so I think they did a good job
coming<00:02:29.320> out<00:02:29.440> with<00:02:29.620> this<00:02:29.800> so<00:02:30.460> once<00:02:30.970> again<00:02:31.120> that
