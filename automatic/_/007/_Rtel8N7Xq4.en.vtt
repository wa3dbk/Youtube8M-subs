00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.630
 yes 

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:07.080
 no no no 

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:13.400
 in this section we will see the 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:16.430
 different operations that can be 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:20.540
 perform with the powers we are going to 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:24.120
 start with the product the product of 

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:26.520
 powers for example if we have 

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:29.430
 we just have to multiply two or more 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:36.060
 powers with the same base for example 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:37.830
 2 raised to 3 by 2 raised to 5 good 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:40.620
 as the result in this case of a 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:44.610
 product of powers with the same base 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:48.110
 fixes it stays the same base and it 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.110
 add the exponents 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:56.250
 that is, this will give us 2 raised to 8 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:01:00.530
 in the case of the quotient 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.530
 if we have in this case 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.080
 two powers with the same base 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:13.610
 the result is going to be another power that 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:15.860
 will have the same base and whose 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.930
 exponent will be the subtraction of the 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:22.630
 exponents 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.630
 in this case it would be 3 raised to 2 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:29.020
 good as you already know how to develop this 

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:31.179
 because it would be simply three by three or 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.399
 here in this first case it would be two times 

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:36.840
 two times two times two 

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:36.840
 so up to eight times 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:43.320
 5 6 7 8 right ok let's go now with 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:45.330
 the powers of exponent 1 that are 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.100
 particular cases of powers that you 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.700
 I should know them because they are very 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.700
 important 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:57.829
 for example 2 raised to 1 is going to be 2 is 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.049
 say any number raised to 1 base 

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:02.940
 it is always the same number 3 raised to 1 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:05.940
 it will be equal to 3 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:09.869
 4 raised to 1 equals 4 and so 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:13.890
 successively and those powers that 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:17.280
 are raised to 0 always will always be 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:19.340
 equal to the unit example 20 that is 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:23.000
 equal to 1 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:25.040
 2 raised to 12 raises to 0 to that is equal 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.310
 a 1 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:30.420
 is the same as the previous 3 to 0 this 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.740
 is equal to 1 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.700
 40 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.700
 so on 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:42.030
 we go to the next section where 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:46.770
 we indicate the value of a power of 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:49.970
 a power for example 2 raised to 3 and 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.970
 raised to 2 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.360
 this 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:59.300
 the result of this is another power 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:02.319
 with the same base that is 2 and as 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:06.819
 exponent the product of the exponents 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:06.819
 3 for 2 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:14.100
 are 2 raised to 6 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.660
 remember the power of a power is 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.280
 maintains the same base and multiply 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.680
 the exponents 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.110
 and finally let's move on to 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.680
 powers of a multiplication or 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:27.359
 division 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.359
 for example the expression 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.650
 contribution raised to a good one because the 

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:35.150
 result of this is has risen in by 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:37.270
 the high n 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:39.069
 ej 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:41.069
 two 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:44.010
 for 6 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:48.480
 ^ 3 Well, you can see that it's the same 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:51.100
 to 2 raised to 3 by 6 raised to 3 and what 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:53.230
 same happens with the division 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:57.310
 / / b 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:04:00.690
 ^ n is equal to ^ in this case divided 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:00.690
 by high n 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:04.209
 if we have 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:08.800
 6 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:10.970
 / 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:15.440
 between 2 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:19.030
 ^ 3 equals 6 raised to 3 divided 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:19.030
 between two elevated 3
