hi this is Nigel from nixle guitar com
amps<00:00:24.000> are<00:00:24.119> still<00:00:24.330> on<00:00:24.480> 11<00:00:24.869> and<00:00:24.990> there's<00:00:25.890> plenty

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
amps are still on 11 and there's plenty

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.820 
amps are still on 11 and there's plenty
of<00:00:26.250> sustained<00:00:26.700> in<00:00:26.910> here<00:00:27.119> so<00:00:27.990> what<00:00:28.650> we're<00:00:28.740> going

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
of sustained in here so what we're going

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.620 
of sustained in here so what we're going
to<00:00:28.920> do<00:00:29.070> now<00:00:29.250> is<00:00:29.279> a<00:00:29.490> fairly<00:00:29.939> straightforward

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
to do now is a fairly straightforward

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.330 
to do now is a fairly straightforward
blues<00:00:31.140> lick<00:00:31.700> again<00:00:32.700> based<00:00:32.970> in<00:00:33.180> a<00:00:33.420> pentatonic

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:34.340 
blues lick again based in a pentatonic

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.910 
blues lick again based in a pentatonic
although<00:00:35.340> my<00:00:35.460> guitar<00:00:35.699> is<00:00:35.879> tuned<00:00:36.120> to<00:00:36.180> E<00:00:36.270> flat<00:00:36.920> so

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
although my guitar is tuned to E flat so

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.549 
although my guitar is tuned to E flat so
i<00:00:37.949> guess<00:00:38.129> it's<00:00:38.280> e-flat<00:00:38.580> pentatonic<00:00:39.470> it's<00:00:40.470> a

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
i guess it's e-flat pentatonic it's a

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.470 
i guess it's e-flat pentatonic it's a
fairly<00:00:40.770> easy<00:00:40.860> connecting<00:00:41.489> lick<00:00:41.670> that<00:00:42.090> we<00:00:42.300> can

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
fairly easy connecting lick that we can

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.049 
fairly easy connecting lick that we can
connect<00:00:42.809> different<00:00:43.230> ideas<00:00:43.800> move<00:00:44.760> around<00:00:44.940> the

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
connect different ideas move around the

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.119 
connect different ideas move around the
fretboard<00:00:45.300> a<00:00:45.510> little<00:00:45.780> bit<00:00:46.010> and<00:00:47.010> it's

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
fretboard a little bit and it's

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.530 
fretboard a little bit and it's
something<00:00:47.280> that<00:00:47.489> you'll<00:00:48.090> hear<00:00:48.300> a<00:00:48.330> lot<00:00:48.480> of

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:48.540 
something that you'll hear a lot of

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.580 
something that you'll hear a lot of
blues<00:00:48.840> players<00:00:49.199> play<00:00:51.050> because<00:00:52.050> it's<00:00:52.200> it's<00:00:52.500> a

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
blues players play because it's it's a

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
can play with it spice it up a bit so

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.030 
can play with it spice it up a bit so
what<00:00:57.210> we'll<00:00:57.329> do<00:00:57.480> now<00:00:57.690> is<00:00:57.719> I'll<00:00:58.230> play<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:58.890> lip

00:00:59.030 --> 00:00:59.040 
what we'll do now is I'll play the lip

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.060 
what we'll do now is I'll play the lip
for<00:00:59.250> you<00:00:59.690> and<00:01:00.690> then<00:01:00.899> we'll<00:01:01.050> pull<00:01:01.379> it<00:01:01.500> apart<00:01:01.590> and

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
for you and then we'll pull it apart and

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:08.719 
for you and then we'll pull it apart and

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
you can take it home with you so that's

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.100 
you can take it home with you so that's
it<00:01:08.850> this<00:01:09.090> is<00:01:09.149> a<00:01:09.180> very<00:01:09.330> straightforward<00:01:09.660> lake

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
it this is a very straightforward lake

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.590 
it this is a very straightforward lake
as<00:01:10.259> i<00:01:10.289> say<00:01:10.560> i<00:01:11.190> guess--i<00:01:11.759> flat<00:01:12.000> pentatonic

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
as i say i guess--i flat pentatonic

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.960 
as i say i guess--i flat pentatonic
because<00:01:12.750> of<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:12.930> guitar<00:01:13.170> tune<00:01:13.820> and<00:01:14.820> what

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
because of the guitar tune and what

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.730 
because of the guitar tune and what
we'll<00:01:15.090> do<00:01:15.240> now<00:01:15.420> is<00:01:15.450> just<00:01:15.720> go<00:01:16.140> in<00:01:16.259> a<00:01:16.350> little<00:01:16.470> bit

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
we'll do now is just go in a little bit

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.920 
we'll do now is just go in a little bit
has<00:01:17.610> a<00:01:17.640> little<00:01:17.880> bit<00:01:17.970> of<00:01:18.000> a<00:01:18.119> few<00:01:18.390> bends<00:01:18.570> in<00:01:18.780> there

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
has a little bit of a few bends in there

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.570 
has a little bit of a few bends in there
you<00:01:19.080> can<00:01:19.200> add<00:01:19.350> a<00:01:19.380> few<00:01:19.649> more<00:01:19.710> bends<00:01:20.190> you<00:01:20.280> can<00:01:20.430> add

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
you can add a few more bends you can add

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.600 
you can add a few more bends you can add
vibrato<00:01:20.940> so<00:01:21.780> this<00:01:22.380> is<00:01:22.410> twelve<00:01:22.770> fret<00:01:23.040> i<00:01:23.189> guess

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
vibrato so this is twelve fret i guess

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.280 
vibrato so this is twelve fret i guess
this<00:01:23.820> guitar<00:01:24.210> doesn't<00:01:24.390> make<00:01:24.600> it<00:01:24.750> all<00:01:25.229> that

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
this guitar doesn't make it all that

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.750 
this guitar doesn't make it all that
straightforward<00:01:25.710> but<00:01:26.100> this<00:01:26.250> is<00:01:26.369> 12<00:01:26.610> right

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:26.760 
straightforward but this is 12 right

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.300 
straightforward but this is 12 right
