00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.569
 House Redder Myu 

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:13.280
 When knitting for the first time, it is a systematic plan at home 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.280
 Let's get used to how to use a knitting machine 

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:37.390
 Hiller mini switch 

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:43.710
 Turn the handle counterclockwise until it stops 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:43.710
 Make the 3 pink needles come in front 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.210
 2 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:53.140
 Switch the switch really 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:01:02.450
 I will apply the first two lines of pink tension 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:07.560
 Do not kate the second beam 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:13.390
 Kate the third beam again 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:20.170
 We will repeat the not over apply the Kate 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:23.800
 Pull the thread at the left and take care not to bend the thread 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:30.840
 The last needle does not kate 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:30.840
 If you put Kei3 on the body, you will have 2 types at the end. 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:41.820
 Turn the handle clockwise to weave 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:55.920
 When you find a jump in the middle of knitting 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:58.280
 Please remove it from the strain body and re- knit from the beginning 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.280
 Hmm 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.000
 me 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:16.090
 Stop the handle when you have knitted to the required number of steps 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:24.040
 I leave Kate about 5 cm from the well mouth and cut it 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:45.000
 If you break the system , turn the handle clockwise as you would when removing from the fabric and knitting 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:49.190
 Kate gets out of tension 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.190
 You can make a match 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:05.140
 Eyes one by one through the rest of the system 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:08.530
 And go through the ground 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:11.250
 18 people in total looking at the mesh 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.250
 Masu wide 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:42.090
 Pull at the end and squeeze
