us<00:01:12.259> to<00:01:12.500> have<00:01:12.799> a<00:01:13.189> mobile<00:01:13.490> computing<00:01:14.090> device

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.450 
us to have a mobile computing device

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.950 
us to have a mobile computing device
that<00:01:15.320> people<00:01:15.799> will<00:01:15.950> use<00:01:16.090> on<00:01:17.090> a<00:01:17.149> daily<00:01:17.570> basis

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
that people will use on a daily basis

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.170 
that people will use on a daily basis
and<00:01:18.140> they<00:01:18.200> can't<00:01:18.409> do<00:01:18.590> without<00:01:18.740> and<00:01:19.250> so<00:01:19.790> we<00:01:20.000> want

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.180 
and they can't do without and so we want

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.300 
and they can't do without and so we want
to<00:01:20.270> make<00:01:20.390> sure<00:01:20.420> all<00:01:21.079> applications<00:01:21.860> benefit

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
to make sure all applications benefit

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.819 
to make sure all applications benefit
from<00:01:22.490> it<00:01:22.670> and<00:01:22.909> so<00:01:23.570> therefore<00:01:23.750> having<00:01:24.110> 64-bit

00:01:24.819 --> 00:01:24.829 
from it and so therefore having 64-bit

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:27.190 
from it and so therefore having 64-bit
capability<00:01:25.369> across<00:01:25.610> the<00:01:25.759> platform<00:01:26.240> coupled

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
capability across the platform coupled

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.760 
capability across the platform coupled
with<00:01:27.290> a<00:01:28.000> robust<00:01:29.000> air<00:01:29.570> interface<00:01:30.020> such<00:01:30.259> as<00:01:30.380> LTE

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
with a robust air interface such as LTE

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.990 
with a robust air interface such as LTE
becomes<00:01:31.430> a<00:01:31.729> very<00:01:32.479> attractive<00:01:32.750> solution<00:01:33.320> for

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.000 
becomes a very attractive solution for

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.580 
becomes a very attractive solution for
not<00:01:35.000> only<00:01:35.090> for<00:01:35.210> our<00:01:35.509> customers<00:01:36.140> but<00:01:36.320> for<00:01:36.380> our

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
not only for our customers but for our

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.830 
not only for our customers but for our
customers<00:01:37.040> customers<00:01:37.490> you've<00:01:38.240> mentioned<00:01:38.509> a

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
customers customers you've mentioned a

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.539 
customers customers you've mentioned a
lot<00:01:38.990> about<00:01:39.020> again<00:01:39.920> across<00:01:40.250> the<00:01:40.399> different

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:40.549 
lot about again across the different

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:43.630 
lot about again across the different
tiers<00:01:40.939> yeah<00:01:41.600> I<00:01:41.869> think<00:01:42.079> of<00:01:42.409> the<00:01:42.590> if<00:01:42.860> we<00:01:43.340> look<00:01:43.490> at

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
tiers yeah I think of the if we look at

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.870 
tiers yeah I think of the if we look at
the<00:01:43.790> the<00:01:44.450> premier<00:01:45.289> the<00:01:45.710> premium<00:01:45.740> tier<00:01:46.520> they're

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
the the premier the premium tier they're

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.639 
the the premier the premium tier they're
a<00:01:46.909> smart<00:01:47.270> phone<00:01:47.509> some<00:01:48.110> people<00:01:48.380> are<00:01:48.469> saying

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:48.649 
a smart phone some people are saying

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:50.230 
a smart phone some people are saying
that<00:01:48.890> you<00:01:49.070> know<00:01:49.189> we've<00:01:49.369> sort<00:01:49.820> of<00:01:49.880> reached<00:01:50.090> a

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
that you know we've sort of reached a

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.880 
that you know we've sort of reached a
point<00:01:50.479> where<00:01:50.750> all<00:01:50.780> the<00:01:51.020> devices<00:01:51.320> are<00:01:51.560> looking

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
point where all the devices are looking

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:53.410 
point where all the devices are looking
the<00:01:52.009> same<00:01:52.039> what<00:01:52.729> are<00:01:52.789> your<00:01:52.969> thoughts<00:01:53.210> about

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
the same what are your thoughts about

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:54.999

navigate through those are all
differentiating<00:02:22.920> items<00:02:23.250> and<00:02:23.430> so<00:02:23.790> we<00:02:24.390> have<00:02:24.599> to

differentiating items and so we have to
be<00:02:25.230> cognizant<00:02:25.830> of<00:02:25.890> the<00:02:25.950> fact<00:02:26.040> that<00:02:26.489> people<00:02:27.239> are

there's<00:02:37.650> big<00:02:38.010> reason<00:02:38.370> to<00:02:38.459> believe<00:02:38.579> in<00:02:38.819> other

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
there's big reason to believe in other

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.850 
there's big reason to believe in other
parts<00:02:39.299> of<00:02:39.360> the<00:02:39.450> world<00:02:39.569> 4k<00:02:40.230> TVs<00:02:40.590> are<00:02:40.769> gonna

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
parts of the world 4k TVs are gonna

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.530 
parts of the world 4k TVs are gonna
start<00:02:41.159> to<00:02:41.280> become<00:02:41.430> more<00:02:41.700> prevalent<00:02:41.910> so

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
start to become more prevalent so

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.839 
start to become more prevalent so
therefore<00:02:42.870> I<00:02:42.900> think<00:02:42.959> that<00:02:43.709> compute<00:02:44.160> power<00:02:44.430> and

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:44.849 
therefore I think that compute power and

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:48.199 
therefore I think that compute power and
the<00:02:45.660> innovation<00:02:46.290> of<00:02:46.500> camera<00:02:47.430> and<00:02:47.670> video<00:02:48.000> and

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
the innovation of camera and video and

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.599 
the innovation of camera and video and
audio<00:02:48.420> and<00:02:48.930> concurrent<00:02:49.829> uses<00:02:50.310> of<00:02:50.489> those

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:50.609 
audio and concurrent uses of those

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:55.129 
audio and concurrent uses of those
applications<00:02:51.359> become<00:02:51.720> become<00:02:52.560> very<00:02:52.799> strong
