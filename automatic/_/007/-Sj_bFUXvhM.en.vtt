00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
countries if I was ever gonna do this so

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.319 
countries if I was ever gonna do this so
it<00:01:34.890> is<00:01:34.979> pretty<00:01:35.159> cool<00:01:35.369> i<00:01:35.579> like<00:01:35.759> these<00:01:36.000> trees<00:01:36.299> i

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
it is pretty cool i like these trees i

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.510 
it is pretty cool i like these trees i
think<00:01:36.689> they<00:01:36.810> suit<00:01:37.140> so<00:01:37.740> much<00:01:37.890> better<00:01:38.100> than<00:01:38.310> the

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
think they suit so much better than the

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.810 
think they suit so much better than the
the<00:01:39.329> ones<00:01:39.509> with<00:01:39.689> leaves<00:01:39.990> on<00:01:40.290> and<00:01:40.470> stuff<00:01:40.820> okay

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
thing next to the guide they're pretty

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.910 
thing next to the guide they're pretty
much

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
much

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.830 
much
is<00:02:13.980> chillin<00:02:14.310> together<00:02:14.430> we<00:02:15.240> have<00:02:15.330> a<00:02:15.360> merchant

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
is chillin together we have a merchant

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.059 
is chillin together we have a merchant
here<00:02:15.990> and<00:02:16.110> underneath<00:02:16.319> we<00:02:16.620> have<00:02:16.800> what<00:02:17.040> looks

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
here and underneath we have what looks

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:20.180 
here and underneath we have what looks
to<00:02:17.400> be<00:02:17.490> ice<00:02:17.819> stone<00:02:18.390> and<00:02:18.690> I'm<00:02:18.780> imagine<00:02:19.709> this<00:02:19.980> is

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
to be ice stone and I'm imagine this is

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.190 
to be ice stone and I'm imagine this is
what<00:02:20.400> the<00:02:20.760> building's<00:02:21.480> actually<00:02:21.810> built<00:02:21.989> out

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
what the building's actually built out

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.890 
what the building's actually built out

of all this ice stone as you can see we
have<00:02:24.930> a<00:02:25.050> separate<00:02:25.500> oven<00:02:25.860> there<00:02:26.130> so<00:02:26.760> that's

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
have a separate oven there so that's

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.870 
have a separate oven there so that's
pretty<00:02:27.209> cool<00:02:27.450> if<00:02:28.080> we<00:02:28.170> move<00:02:28.440> on<00:02:28.650> we<00:02:29.130> have<00:02:29.340> a<00:02:29.550> kind

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.660 
he's kind of followed him so maybe it is
naturally<00:03:12.780> generated<00:03:12.900> but<00:03:13.830> I'm<00:03:14.069> gonna<00:03:14.400> edge

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
naturally generated but I'm gonna edge

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.750 
naturally generated but I'm gonna edge
my<00:03:14.910> bets<00:03:15.150> on<00:03:15.330> that<00:03:15.569> being<00:03:15.840> a<00:03:16.019> pet<00:03:16.319> so<00:03:17.190> it's<00:03:17.610> a

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
my bets on that being a pet so it's a

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.630 
my bets on that being a pet so it's a
pretty<00:03:17.940> cool<00:03:18.209> pad<00:03:18.450> also<00:03:19.170> we<00:03:20.100> can<00:03:20.130> see<00:03:20.370> another

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
pretty cool pad also we can see another

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.520 
pretty cool pad also we can see another
ice<00:03:20.910> chest<00:03:21.269> naturally<00:03:21.690> generated<00:03:21.840> I<00:03:22.230> believe

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
ice chest naturally generated I believe

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.220 
ice chest naturally generated I believe
just<00:03:23.430> on<00:03:23.549> the<00:03:23.730> just<00:03:24.299> on<00:03:24.450> the<00:03:24.570> same<00:03:24.810> line<00:03:25.019> as<00:03:25.200> the

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
just on the just on the same line as the

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.590 
just on the just on the same line as the
Admiral<00:03:25.530> there<00:03:25.709> behind<00:03:26.519> him<00:03:26.760> we<00:03:26.970> have<00:03:27.180> an<00:03:27.299> ice

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
Admiral there behind him we have an ice

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.170 
Admiral there behind him we have an ice
slime<00:03:28.230> and<00:03:28.709> above<00:03:29.400> that<00:03:29.579> we<00:03:29.730> have<00:03:29.940> what<00:03:30.150> looks

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
slime and above that we have what looks

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.449 
slime and above that we have what looks
to<00:03:30.480> be<00:03:30.600> a<00:03:30.720> mangled<00:03:31.230> bat<00:03:31.500> and<00:03:31.769> also<00:03:32.070> a<00:03:32.100> crack<00:03:32.430> in

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
to be a mangled bat and also a crack in

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:34.490 
to be a mangled bat and also a crack in
the<00:03:32.670> wall<00:03:32.850> I'll<00:03:33.450> let<00:03:33.600> you<00:03:33.660> guys<00:03:33.959> decide<00:03:34.260> what

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
the wall I'll let you guys decide what

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.120 
the wall I'll let you guys decide what
goes<00:03:34.709> on<00:03:34.769> there<00:03:35.959> underneath<00:03:36.959> that<00:03:37.260> we<00:03:37.920> have<00:03:38.100> a

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
goes on there underneath that we have a

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.940 
goes on there underneath that we have a
little<00:03:38.430> cavern<00:03:39.329> and<00:03:39.630> inside<00:03:40.140> we<00:03:40.350> can<00:03:40.470> see<00:03:40.709> this

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
little cavern and inside we can see this

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.460 
little cavern and inside we can see this
frozen<00:03:41.310> pot<00:03:41.730> so<00:03:42.450> we<00:03:42.570> saw<00:03:42.720> new<00:03:42.900> types<00:03:43.109> of<00:03:43.260> pots

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
frozen pot so we saw new types of pots

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.259 
frozen pot so we saw new types of pots
in<00:03:43.620> the<00:03:43.650> jungle<00:03:44.040> screenshot<00:03:44.489> so<00:03:44.700> I<00:03:44.880> like<00:03:45.090> the

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
in the jungle screenshot so I like the

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:47.569 
in the jungle screenshot so I like the
little<00:03:45.359> variations<00:03:46.049> it's<00:03:46.230> running<00:03:46.560> okay<00:03:47.519> so

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:47.579 
little variations it's running okay so

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:49.220 
little variations it's running okay so
we're<00:03:48.390> going<00:03:48.480> to<00:03:48.570> talk<00:03:48.690> a<00:03:48.720> little<00:03:48.900> bit<00:03:49.109> about

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
we're going to talk a little bit about

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.229 
we're going to talk a little bit about
this<00:03:49.410> blue<00:03:49.620> touch<00:03:49.859> as<00:03:50.250> you<00:03:50.880> can<00:03:51.000> see<00:03:51.120> it's

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 
this blue touch as you can see it's

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:52.849 
this blue touch as you can see it's
hanging<00:03:51.420> off<00:03:51.600> the<00:03:51.720> wall<00:03:51.900> but<00:03:52.170> it's<00:03:52.290> also<00:03:52.470> being

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:52.859 
hanging off the wall but it's also being

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:55.430 
hanging off the wall but it's also being
run<00:03:53.160> over<00:03:53.280> by<00:03:53.459> war<00:03:53.880> form<00:03:54.209> this<00:03:54.810> means<00:03:55.109> two

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
run over by war form this means two

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.280 
run over by war form this means two
things<00:03:55.470> either<00:03:55.980> this<00:03:56.790> torch<00:03:57.150> is<00:03:57.450> invulnerable

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
things either this torch is invulnerable

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:01.759 
things either this torch is invulnerable
to<00:03:58.709> water<00:03:58.920> or<00:03:59.730> the<00:04:00.239> waterfalls<00:04:01.079> work<00:04:01.350> over

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:01.769 
to water or the waterfalls work over

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:03.979 
to water or the waterfalls work over
torches<00:04:02.280> I<00:04:02.489> don't<00:04:03.329> know<00:04:03.420> how<00:04:03.569> that<00:04:03.600> would<00:04:03.930> work

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:03.989 
torches I don't know how that would work

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:06.380 
torches I don't know how that would work
maybe<00:04:04.410> a<00:04:04.560> fitter<00:04:05.069> only<00:04:05.670> one<00:04:05.880> block<00:04:06.090> over<00:04:06.120> a

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390 
maybe a fitter only one block over a

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:07.880 
maybe a fitter only one block over a
torch<00:04:06.690> maybe<00:04:06.959> it's<00:04:07.109> fine<00:04:07.260> if<00:04:07.440> it's<00:04:07.560> two<00:04:07.739> blocks

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890 
torch maybe it's fine if it's two blocks

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:09.949 
torch maybe it's fine if it's two blocks
it's<00:04:08.190> not<00:04:08.370> I<00:04:08.609> don't<00:04:09.090> know<00:04:09.329> but<00:04:09.390> that's<00:04:09.690> pretty

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
it's not I don't know but that's pretty

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:11.840 
it's not I don't know but that's pretty
cool<00:04:10.170> so<00:04:10.980> that's<00:04:11.160> pretty<00:04:11.310> much<00:04:11.400> it<00:04:11.519> for<00:04:11.670> this
