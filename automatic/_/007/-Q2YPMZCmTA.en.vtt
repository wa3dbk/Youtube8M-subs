00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:11.439
 attention now begins the material must 

00:00:11.439 --> 00:00:14.439
 The high school ginga you're going to watch. 

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:18.470
 number 23 good studies 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:21.470
 a good deed, right? 

00:00:24.749 --> 00:00:27.749
 I have a month 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:29.739
 that 

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:33.370
 Have you noticed how the animals are grouped here? 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.340
 but today we will see how we group and classify not only the most 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:47.520
 all living things 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.900
 in this beautiful class you will see how biology classified living beings according to 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:58.120
 their characteristics will learn what are the systematic categories and how 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.710
 this system indicate the proximity to the biological distance between different 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.239
 beings 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.239
 yesterday afternoon in ct king pelÃ© 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.820
 in the city of Gaza the government is open 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.880
 yet to humberto win the world 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.170
 not yet 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:20.820
 I do not die but the purchase was also worth missing the word 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.770
 already 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.880
 posted on the fridge 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.420
 vegetables 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.420
 labor 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.640
 and the detainees are leopoldo alexandre 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.260
 Paulo 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.559
 ready 

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:10.559
 like none 

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:12.809
 titled without a fight to win 

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:15.529
 any parliamentarian 

00:02:15.529 --> 00:02:19.500
 with a 1-0 win for the lap 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:20.679
 for such 

00:02:20.679 --> 00:02:23.589
 liquid with vegetable corn the edict 

00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:25.609
 he posted possible 

00:02:25.609 --> 00:02:27.859
 that was the same criterion 

00:02:27.859 --> 00:02:31.149
 the criterion is a set of characteristics used for the 

00:02:31.149 --> 00:02:33.099
 classification of things 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:36.810
 the renato for example used to wait for the purchases with criteria of 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.659
 group products with different details features in a closet 

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:45.060
 the feminine products of the world and today 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.749
 Porto Alegre 

00:02:46.749 --> 00:02:47.799
 already clear 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:51.879
 is applying another criterion is placing the cleaning products 

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:53.559
 normality 

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:55.889
 those who need 

00:02:55.889 --> 00:02:57.159
 in the fridge 

00:02:57.159 --> 00:03:00.159
 and the vehicles in the closet 

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:03.889
 from the work the novelty or 

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:06.009
 tardelli 

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:08.199
 but from what i understand 

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:11.569
 what he did was tell things according to their characteristics that 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:13.959
 ran today 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:17.269
 all games do the same thing with living things 

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:22.829
 they study the characteristics of similarities and differences between 

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:26.479
 beings and creating preordered criteria and a group of 

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:31.329
 one of these criteria used by biological classification is the 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:36.009
 as living things get food there we can already separate two large 

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:40.499
 groups of living beings that produce their own food through 

00:03:40.499 --> 00:03:42.439
 photosynthesis 

00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:47.480
 vegetables and living things that feed on other living things. 

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:50.509
 animal fungi is hitting 

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:53.369
 ap within each of these two large groups 

00:03:53.369 --> 00:03:57.119
 plants, there are several smaller groups according to the 

00:03:57.119 --> 00:04:01.869
 characteristics observed if I feel sorry for them, we are as 

00:04:01.869 --> 00:04:04.759
 persist the size of the leaves is certain 

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:06.530
 let's take a look at some 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:09.530
 decisions of vegetables for example 

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:13.879
 within a large plant group there is a better group of worlds 

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:18.120
 the fall in supply caused by true nuclear weapons 

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:20.309
 the subgroup 

00:04:20.309 --> 00:04:24.419
 is the outside fern has been hacked skate on bribes at the bottom 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:28.720
 already characterized by sovereign debt 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.300
 in a similar way but not fruits 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:36.449
 while the sata announced sovereigns clouds form fruits in florence 

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:42.430
 will or will not 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:47.310
 before taking the scene next to america the lulinha technician 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:51.400
 for the work of the school by the private sector and in Europe 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:56.540
 the MP-m parliamentary leader intends to write they have looked like what 

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:58.070
 has different from one another 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:59.539
 scoring July 2 

00:04:59.539 --> 00:05:02.599
 very similar profile 

00:05:02.599 --> 00:05:04.889
 knows that despite the 

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:07.889
 in the collection of absence and excerpts, ie three years 

00:05:08.779 --> 00:05:10.029
 educators 

00:05:10.029 --> 00:05:12.469
 none of them have a whole skeleton 

00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:15.360
 what are the differences and neymar 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.139
 as far as I could observe 

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:19.889
 the differences are following dreaming 

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:22.889
 the new your body is not something that come together 

00:05:24.629 --> 00:05:29.239
 the snail then I count morale only that the charge for the point to protect 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:31.249
 worried 

00:05:31.249 --> 00:05:34.249
 and locusts and hinged feet 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.629
 the shirt 27 

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:43.689
 I do not want to be bigger this is from the majority of the animals group you took with a 

00:05:43.689 --> 00:05:46.300
 smaller group the house is small 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:49.300
 are the animals that did not pass nor does it always have a 

00:05:50.059 --> 00:05:51.770
 half of the 27 

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:54.449
 You have one to ignore. 

00:05:54.449 --> 00:05:57.260
 this sequence of groups and subgroups 

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:01.890
 represents a certain type of hierarchy in the biological classification of groups 

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:02.629
 minors 

00:06:02.629 --> 00:06:06.529
 define more and more specific characteristics of each living being 

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:08.520
 in each of these decisions 

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:12.360
 has a name looks to understand this better let's see for example a 

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.059
 orangutan 

00:06:14.059 --> 00:06:19.939
 he belongs to a large group called the king momo in the animal kingdom there we will be 

00:06:19.939 --> 00:06:25.599
 hostages and any animal the first subgroup said and soil orangutan has 

00:06:25.599 --> 00:06:26.740
 features 

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:28.630
 who do it belonged to the 

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:31.630
 the ones cut off that already exclude some animals 

00:06:32.749 --> 00:06:38.599
 the next subgroup is the strawberry house tango is of the class of mammals that 

00:06:38.599 --> 00:06:41.599
 have common characteristics there are fewer animals 

00:06:42.199 --> 00:06:47.749
 the next group is the order and the durango tango is that of the primates after with the 

00:06:47.749 --> 00:06:50.300
 kurt busch family iv 

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:57.400
 the genus that even a goal and the species that accompanied pygmies these groups that 

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:00.610
 you just see are the so-called systematic categories 

00:07:01.199 --> 00:07:02.550
 this classification 

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:06.699
 vahidi characteristics but viral up to the most private 

00:07:07.319 --> 00:07:10.069
 it completely identifies each direction 

00:07:10.069 --> 00:07:13.349
 almost as if it constitutes biological rest of each year 

00:07:13.349 --> 00:07:16.499
 is not very different from what we do to identify a person in the 

00:07:16.499 --> 00:07:18.669
 address kill 

00:07:18.669 --> 00:07:23.219
 the first thing to identify is the country to which it belongs disorganized 

00:07:23.219 --> 00:07:26.429
 of absolute majority here after the living being 

00:07:26.979 --> 00:07:28.839
 then the state 

00:07:28.839 --> 00:07:29.909
 would be equivalent to the end
