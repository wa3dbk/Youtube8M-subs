00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
sometimes really difficult when you see

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:00.420 
sometimes really difficult when you see
it<00:02:59.260> through<00:02:59.470> the<00:02:59.590> microscope<00:03:00.099> and<00:03:00.310> then

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
it through the microscope and then

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.319 
it through the microscope and then
missing<00:03:01.299> the<00:03:01.390> whole<00:03:01.510> big<00:03:01.720> picture<00:03:02.970> just<00:03:03.970> being
