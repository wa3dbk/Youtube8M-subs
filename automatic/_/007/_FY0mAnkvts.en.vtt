we're going to go over in this video is
the<00:00:16.880> horseshoe<00:00:17.240> load<00:00:17.529> this<00:00:18.529> is<00:00:18.770> part<00:00:18.980> of<00:00:19.009> the

00:00:19.089 --> 00:00:19.099 
the horseshoe load this is part of the

the horseshoe load this is part of the
new<00:00:19.250> high-rise<00:00:19.579> configuration<00:00:20.329> remember

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:20.869 
new high-rise configuration remember

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:22.870 
new high-rise configuration remember
it's<00:00:21.110> just<00:00:21.200> not<00:00:21.470> for<00:00:21.619> high-rise<00:00:21.890> fires<00:00:22.189> how<00:00:22.759> it

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:22.880 
it's just not for high-rise fires how it

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:24.909 
it's just not for high-rise fires how it
works<00:00:23.029> it<00:00:23.239> for<00:00:23.539> you<00:00:23.660> and<00:00:23.810> your<00:00:23.930> area<00:00:24.259> is<00:00:24.439> going

works it for you and your area is going
to<00:00:24.980> be<00:00:25.070> how<00:00:25.220> you<00:00:25.279> get<00:00:25.520> out<00:00:25.669> and<00:00:25.820> train<00:00:26.060> what

00:00:26.799 --> 00:00:26.809 
to be how you get out and train what

00:00:26.809 --> 00:00:27.999 
to be how you get out and train what
we're<00:00:26.930> going<00:00:27.050> to<00:00:27.079> show<00:00:27.259> you<00:00:27.290> is<00:00:27.739> we're<00:00:27.919> going

00:00:27.999 --> 00:00:28.009 
we're going to show you is we're going

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:32.470 
we're going to show you is we're going
to<00:00:28.070> show<00:00:28.160> you<00:00:28.279> how<00:00:28.369> to<00:00:28.430> wrap<00:00:28.700> it<00:00:31.360> start<00:00:32.360> with

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:32.480 
to show you how to wrap it start with

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.340 
to show you how to wrap it start with
two<00:00:32.660> couplings<00:00:33.110> male<00:00:33.860> and<00:00:34.010> a<00:00:34.040> female

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:35.350 
two couplings male and a female

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.060 
two couplings male and a female
preferably<00:00:36.350> a<00:00:36.379> sledgehammer<00:00:37.719> put<00:00:38.719> the<00:00:38.840> two

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:39.070 
preferably a sledgehammer put the two

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.340 
preferably a sledgehammer put the two
sections<00:00:40.070> of<00:00:40.340> hose<00:00:40.489> side-by-side<00:00:41.199> then<00:00:42.199> we're

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.350 
sections of hose side-by-side then we're

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:43.869 
sections of hose side-by-side then we're
gonna<00:00:42.440> start<00:00:42.710> wrapping<00:00:42.859> around<00:00:43.159> the<00:00:43.399> hose<00:00:43.579> or

00:00:43.869 --> 00:00:43.879 
gonna start wrapping around the hose or

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:51.369 
gonna start wrapping around the hose or
the<00:00:43.940> sledgehammer<00:00:49.659> remember<00:00:50.659> to<00:00:50.870> alternate

00:00:51.369 --> 00:00:51.379 
the sledgehammer remember to alternate

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:54.610 
the sledgehammer remember to alternate
ends<00:00:51.829> alternate<00:00:52.730> folds<00:00:53.269> so<00:00:54.140> your<00:00:54.409> hose

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:54.620 
ends alternate folds so your hose

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:17.210 
ends alternate folds so your hose
doesn't<00:00:55.069> stick<00:00:55.399> out<00:00:55.519> too<00:00:55.819> far

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.250 

now<00:01:18.220> we<00:01:18.280> left<00:01:18.550> these<00:01:18.640> couplings<00:01:19.090> undone<00:01:19.450> to

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:20.260 
now we left these couplings undone to

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:21.870 
now we left these couplings undone to
allow<00:01:20.440> the<00:01:20.500> air<00:01:20.770> to<00:01:20.800> escape<00:01:21.130> as<00:01:21.580> we<00:01:21.790> were

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:21.880 
allow the air to escape as we were

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.570 
allow the air to escape as we were
racking<00:01:22.150> this<00:01:22.510> after<00:01:23.500> we're<00:01:23.620> done<00:01:23.800> we<00:01:24.190> connect

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:24.580 
racking this after we're done we connect

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:26.540 
racking this after we're done we connect
them<00:01:24.730> and<00:01:25.690> then<00:01:25.810> we<00:01:25.930> remove<00:01:26.290> this

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:26.550 
them and then we remove this

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.700 
them and then we remove this
sledgehammer<00:01:27.550> out<00:01:27.670> of<00:01:27.790> the<00:01:27.970> middle<00:01:28.710> adjust

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:29.710 
sledgehammer out of the middle adjust

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.520 
sledgehammer out of the middle adjust
the<00:01:29.860> coupling<00:01:30.370> accordingly<00:01:31.230> we'll<00:01:32.230> take<00:01:32.410> our

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 
the coupling accordingly we'll take our

00:01:32.530 --> 00:02:31.670 
the coupling accordingly we'll take our
blue<00:01:32.710> straps

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.050 

once<00:02:32.310> we're<00:02:32.489> done<00:02:32.640> and<00:02:32.940> we<00:02:33.090> strap<00:02:33.390> it<00:02:34.730> it<00:02:35.730> bends

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
once we're done and we strap it it bends

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.780 
once we're done and we strap it it bends
in<00:02:36.180> the<00:02:36.239> middle<00:02:37.010> to<00:02:38.010> allow<00:02:38.190> you<00:02:38.250> to<00:02:38.459> carry<00:02:38.700> it

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
in the middle to allow you to carry it

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.420 
in the middle to allow you to carry it
over<00:02:39.030> your<00:02:39.150> shoulder<00:02:39.540> or<00:02:39.810> your<00:02:39.840> SCBA<00:02:40.500> to

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
over your shoulder or your SCBA to

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.490 
over your shoulder or your SCBA to
deploy<00:02:41.909> this<00:02:42.090> always<00:02:42.690> simply<00:02:42.959> do<00:02:43.110> is<00:02:43.230> remove

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
deploy this always simply do is remove

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:52.309 
deploy this always simply do is remove
the<00:02:43.680> straps<00:02:49.970> grab<00:02:50.970> the<00:02:51.150> coupling<00:02:51.540> and<00:02:51.629> start

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 
the straps grab the coupling and start

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:54.649 
the straps grab the coupling and start
walking<00:02:52.769> this<00:02:53.700> allows<00:02:54.030> the<00:02:54.239> hose<00:02:54.420> to<00:02:54.599> be

00:02:54.649 --> 00:02:54.659 
walking this allows the hose to be

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:56.899 
walking this allows the hose to be
flaked-out<00:02:54.959> and<00:02:55.530> there's<00:02:55.829> no<00:02:56.010> confusion<00:02:56.250> on

00:02:56.899 --> 00:02:56.909 
flaked-out and there's no confusion on

00:02:56.909 --> 00:02:58.759 
flaked-out and there's no confusion on
what<00:02:57.180> years<00:02:57.450> you<00:02:57.599> need<00:02:57.720> to<00:02:57.870> grab<00:02:58.110> and<00:02:58.409> carry<00:02:58.620> up

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
what years you need to grab and carry up

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:04.869 
what years you need to grab and carry up
the<00:02:58.890> steps<00:02:59.190> this<00:02:59.760> is<00:02:59.909> a<00:02:59.940> simple<00:03:00.299> deployment

00:03:04.869 --> 00:03:04.879 

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:06.650 

now<00:03:05.879> we're<00:03:05.970> going<00:03:06.060> to<00:03:06.150> demonstrate<00:03:06.269> how<00:03:06.629> to

now we're going to demonstrate how to

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.270 
now we're going to demonstrate how to
carry<00:03:06.959> the<00:03:07.079> hose<00:03:07.260> up<00:03:07.470> a<00:03:07.560> stairwell<00:03:07.890> first

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
carry the hose up a stairwell first

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.589 
carry the hose up a stairwell first

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:29.800 
once we get the line charged we then can

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:31.920 
once we get the line charged we then can
open<00:06:30.070> up<00:06:30.130> our<00:06:30.340> door<00:06:30.520> and<00:06:30.790> start<00:06:31.600> advancing
