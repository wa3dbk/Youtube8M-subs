00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.890 
doing 140 that's the sort of fun factor
when<00:02:14.400> it<00:02:14.430> goes<00:02:14.610> around<00:02:14.819> corners<00:02:15.209> the<00:02:15.569> feel<00:02:15.870> of

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
when it goes around corners the feel of

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.289 
when it goes around corners the feel of
it<00:02:16.170> is<00:02:16.349> very<00:02:16.620> nice<00:02:16.860> it's<00:02:17.400> weighted<00:02:17.970> really

00:02:18.289 --> 00:02:18.299 
it is very nice it's weighted really

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:20.300 
it is very nice it's weighted really
well<00:02:18.480> because<00:02:18.690> the<00:02:19.620> way<00:02:19.799> they've<00:02:20.040> done<00:02:20.099> the

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
well because the way they've done the

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.360 
well because the way they've done the
weight<00:02:20.459> distribution<00:02:20.670> in<00:02:21.269> the<00:02:21.360> car<00:02:21.599> it's<00:02:22.370> done

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
weight distribution in the car it's done

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.220 
weight distribution in the car it's done
so<00:02:23.610> that<00:02:23.790> it<00:02:23.910> handles<00:02:24.120> really<00:02:24.420> really<00:02:25.049> well

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
so that it handles really really well

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.440 
so that it handles really really well
and<00:02:25.650> it's<00:02:25.799> a<00:02:25.950> nice<00:02:26.160> cockpit<00:02:26.879> you<00:02:27.030> have<00:02:27.180> a<00:02:27.209> nice
