00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:50.880 
well what I mean is that we focus so

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.490 
well what I mean is that we focus so
much<00:00:50.910> of<00:00:51.150> our<00:00:51.240> attention<00:00:51.330> on<00:00:51.690> wrinkles<00:00:52.170> and

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
much of our attention on wrinkles and

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.070 
much of our attention on wrinkles and
what<00:00:53.190> really<00:00:53.430> ages<00:00:53.910> us<00:00:54.060> is<00:00:54.240> our<00:00:54.480> uneven<00:00:54.900> tone

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:55.080 
what really ages us is our uneven tone

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.200 
what really ages us is our uneven tone
and<00:00:55.410> so<00:00:55.860> recent<00:00:56.250> developments<00:00:56.730> have<00:00:56.910> shown

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
and so recent developments have shown

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.150 
and so recent developments have shown
that<00:00:57.450> uneven<00:00:57.810> tone<00:00:58.200> is<00:00:58.470> how<00:00:58.620> we<00:00:58.680> register

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160
