00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
that when we are editing the colors of

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.380 
that when we are editing the colors of
the<00:01:45.060> image<00:01:45.979> we're<00:01:46.979> only<00:01:47.130> working<00:01:47.399> with<00:01:48.090> the

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
the image we're only working with the

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.499 
the image we're only working with the
blade<00:01:48.659> so<00:01:49.439> go<00:01:49.920> to<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.189> blade<00:01:50.399> layer<00:01:50.729> here<00:01:51.240> for

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
blade so go to the blade layer here for

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.080 
blade so go to the blade layer here for
me<00:01:51.570> it's<00:01:51.720> layer<00:01:51.869> 0<00:01:51.899> up<00:01:52.439> to<00:01:53.040> adjustment<00:01:53.880> and

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
me it's layer 0 up to adjustment and

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.319 
me it's layer 0 up to adjustment and
then<00:01:55.079> hue<00:01:55.380> and<00:01:55.530> saturation<00:01:55.560> and<00:01:56.490> this<00:01:57.210> is

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
then hue and saturation and this is

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:58.550 
then hue and saturation and this is
where<00:01:57.450> you<00:01:57.509> can<00:01:57.630> mess<00:01:57.840> with<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.140> color<00:01:58.350> you

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
where you can mess with the color you

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.929 
where you can mess with the color you
can<00:01:58.740> make<00:01:58.950> it<00:01:59.159> brown<00:02:00.119> red<00:02:00.509> green<00:02:00.540> purple<00:02:01.350> blue

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:01.939 
can make it brown red green purple blue

spring break and they posed like they
were<00:02:23.849> holding<00:02:24.120> lightsabers<00:02:24.959> so<00:02:25.200> let's<00:02:26.040> add

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
were holding lightsabers so let's add

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.729 
were holding lightsabers so let's add
the<00:02:26.969> lightsaber<00:02:27.510> to<00:02:27.780> it<00:02:27.900> so<00:02:28.109> first<00:02:28.439> you<00:02:28.590> have

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
the lightsaber to it so first you have

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:32.619 
the lightsaber to it so first you have
to<00:02:28.950> merge<00:02:29.430> the<00:02:29.700> layers<00:02:30.500> copy<00:02:31.500> the<00:02:31.769> image<00:02:31.920> and

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:32.629 
to merge the layers copy the image and

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:39.410 
to merge the layers copy the image and
then<00:02:35.030> bring<00:02:36.030> it<00:02:36.180> into<00:02:37.040> your<00:02:38.040> other<00:02:38.670> image<00:02:39.150> here

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
then bring it into your other image here

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.500 
then bring it into your other image here
so<00:02:39.689> and<00:02:39.989> then<00:02:40.349> I<00:02:40.439> will<00:02:40.650> unmerge<00:02:41.250> the<00:02:41.609> layers<00:02:41.819> so

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
so and then I will unmerge the layers so

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.300 
so and then I will unmerge the layers so
that<00:02:42.540> I<00:02:42.689> can<00:02:42.840> change<00:02:43.200> the<00:02:43.349> color<00:02:43.560> for<00:02:43.889> another

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
that I can change the color for another

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.970 
that I can change the color for another
one<00:02:44.840> alright<00:02:45.840> so<00:02:46.200> let's<00:02:46.409> work<00:02:46.590> with<00:02:46.650> this

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
one alright so let's work with this

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.000 
one alright so let's work with this
we've<00:02:47.250> got<00:02:47.280> this<00:02:47.489> lightsaber<00:02:48.180> as<00:02:48.569> a<00:02:49.049> layer<00:02:49.739> on

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
we've got this lightsaber as a layer on

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.580 
we've got this lightsaber as a layer on
top<00:02:50.040> so<00:02:50.549> first<00:02:50.879> things<00:02:51.180> first<00:02:51.409> we<00:02:52.409> need<00:02:52.439> to

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
top so first things first we need to

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.800 
top so first things first we need to
change<00:02:52.859> it<00:02:53.129> and<00:02:53.250> get<00:02:53.730> it<00:02:53.760> on<00:02:54.060> the<00:02:54.180> right<00:02:54.359> angle

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
change it and get it on the right angle

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.069 
change it and get it on the right angle
to<00:02:55.019> go<00:02:55.139> in<00:02:55.290> my<00:02:55.470> son's<00:02:55.769> hand<00:02:56.099> you<00:02:56.939> use<00:02:57.269> that<00:02:57.299> by

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:58.079 
to go in my son's hand you use that by

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:01.699 
to go in my son's hand you use that by
selecting<00:02:58.349> the<00:02:58.769> layer<00:02:59.010> and<00:02:59.269> going<00:03:00.269> to<00:03:00.709> free

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
selecting the layer and going to free

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.789 
selecting the layer and going to free
transform<00:03:02.569> okay<00:03:03.569> and<00:03:03.810> then<00:03:04.530> you're<00:03:04.560> going<00:03:04.739> to

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:04.799 
transform okay and then you're going to

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:06.890 
transform okay and then you're going to
get<00:03:04.980> a<00:03:05.189> box<00:03:05.669> like<00:03:05.939> this<00:03:06.000> and<00:03:06.209> you<00:03:06.450> can<00:03:06.629> shrink

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
get a box like this and you can shrink

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.619 
get a box like this and you can shrink
the<00:03:07.200> size<00:03:07.439> of<00:03:07.769> your<00:03:07.829> lightsaber<00:03:08.579> just<00:03:09.480> by

00:03:09.619 --> 00:03:09.629 
the size of your lightsaber just by

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:11.899 
the size of your lightsaber just by
using<00:03:09.840> the<00:03:10.439> keys<00:03:10.709> and<00:03:11.010> then<00:03:11.219> if<00:03:11.400> you<00:03:11.639> move<00:03:11.790> it

00:03:11.899 --> 00:03:11.909 
using the keys and then if you move it

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:14.809 
using the keys and then if you move it
just<00:03:12.060> a<00:03:12.269> bit<00:03:12.299> to<00:03:12.599> the<00:03:12.719> side<00:03:12.900> you<00:03:13.650> can<00:03:13.950> rotate<00:03:14.639> it

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819 
just a bit to the side you can rotate it

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:18.740 
just a bit to the side you can rotate it
so<00:03:15.239> we<00:03:15.870> can<00:03:16.169> get<00:03:16.469> a<00:03:16.739> good<00:03:17.370> size<00:03:17.699> and<00:03:18.150> angle<00:03:18.359> of

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
so we can get a good size and angle of

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.920 
so we can get a good size and angle of
this<00:03:19.049> lightsaber<00:03:19.590> to<00:03:20.340> appropriately<00:03:21.120> fit<00:03:21.540> my

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
this lightsaber to appropriately fit my

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.800 
this lightsaber to appropriately fit my
son's<00:03:22.229> hand<00:03:22.729> so<00:03:23.729> that<00:03:24.000> looks<00:03:24.299> pretty<00:03:24.389> good<00:03:24.659> to

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
son's hand so that looks pretty good to

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:30.979 
son's hand so that looks pretty good to
me<00:03:27.379> pretty<00:03:28.379> decent<00:03:28.739> sized<00:03:29.129> lightsaber<00:03:29.699> and<00:03:29.989> we

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
me pretty decent sized lightsaber and we

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:34.129 
me pretty decent sized lightsaber and we
accept<00:03:31.439> the<00:03:31.919> changes<00:03:32.280> perfect<00:03:33.090> now<00:03:33.659> the<00:03:33.930> only

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:34.139 
accept the changes perfect now the only

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:39.229 
accept the changes perfect now the only
problem<00:03:34.260> is<00:03:34.859> it<00:03:35.129> is<00:03:35.459> behind<00:03:36.209> his<00:03:37.139> hand<00:03:38.239> his

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
problem is it is behind his hand his

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:40.670 
problem is it is behind his hand his
hands<00:03:39.479> are<00:03:39.599> behind<00:03:39.720> the<00:03:39.989> lightsaber<00:03:40.409> so<00:03:40.620> we

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
hands are behind the lightsaber so we

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.920 
hands are behind the lightsaber so we
need<00:03:40.829> to<00:03:40.949> bring<00:03:41.159> it<00:03:41.310> forward<00:03:41.669> so<00:03:42.419> to<00:03:42.479> do<00:03:42.900> that

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
need to bring it forward so to do that

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.530 
need to bring it forward so to do that
all<00:03:43.680> you<00:03:44.040> do<00:03:44.189> is<00:03:44.310> again<00:03:44.549> grab<00:03:44.849> your<00:03:45.060> loop<00:03:45.269> tool

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
all you do is again grab your loop tool

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.699 
all you do is again grab your loop tool
and<00:03:45.900> then<00:03:46.579> trace<00:03:47.579> around<00:03:48.299> the<00:03:48.870> parts<00:03:49.229> that<00:03:49.409> you

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
and then trace around the parts that you

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:54.679 
and then trace around the parts that you
want<00:03:50.069> to<00:03:50.250> bring<00:03:50.430> forward<00:03:51.349> and<00:03:53.209> then<00:03:54.209> you<00:03:54.359> copy

00:03:54.679 --> 00:03:54.689 
want to bring forward and then you copy

00:03:54.689 --> 00:03:58.640 
want to bring forward and then you copy
and<00:03:54.959> paste<00:03:55.199> it<00:03:56.959> you<00:03:57.959> have<00:03:58.049> to<00:03:58.199> drag<00:03:58.439> it<00:03:58.470> over

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
and paste it you have to drag it over

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.499 
and paste it you have to drag it over
top<00:03:58.949> so<00:03:59.159> here's<00:03:59.340> his<00:03:59.489> hands<00:03:59.849> will<00:04:00.060> drag<00:04:00.329> it

00:04:00.499 --> 00:04:00.509

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:03.559 
top so here's his hands will drag it
back<00:04:00.689> over<00:04:00.720> top<00:04:01.400> make<00:04:02.400> sure<00:04:02.430> layer<00:04:02.849> 2<00:04:03.150> is<00:04:03.299> above

00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:03.569 
back over top make sure layer 2 is above

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:07.960 
back over top make sure layer 2 is above
layer<00:04:03.810> 1<00:04:04.109> and<00:04:04.879> now<00:04:05.879> it<00:04:06.180> looks<00:04:06.209> like<00:04:06.870> my<00:04:07.349> son<00:04:07.650> is

00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:19.349 
again we work with the layer and we go

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:22.719 
again we work with the layer and we go
to<00:04:19.409> adjustment<00:04:20.159> Hugh<00:04:21.030> let's<00:04:21.870> make<00:04:22.049> him<00:04:22.289> uh

Maul ish right okay so that one is good
we<00:04:41.250> will<00:04:41.639> merge<00:04:42.180> the<00:04:42.449> layers<00:04:43.190> copy<00:04:44.190> the

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:44.690 
we will merge the layers copy the

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:51.560 
we will merge the layers copy the
lightsaber<00:04:46.789> over<00:04:48.500> simple<00:04:49.580> again<00:04:50.580> go<00:04:50.880> to<00:04:50.940> edit

lightsaber over simple again go to edit

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:54.710 
lightsaber over simple again go to edit
free<00:04:52.470> transform<00:04:52.770> and<00:04:53.460> now<00:04:54.090> we<00:04:54.150> need<00:04:54.389> to<00:04:54.419> rotate

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720 
free transform and now we need to rotate

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.260 
free transform and now we need to rotate
it<00:04:55.080> all<00:04:55.229> the<00:04:55.470> way<00:04:55.560> around<00:04:55.680> so<00:04:56.669> that<00:04:56.699> it<00:04:57.120> is

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:57.270 
it all the way around so that it is

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:59.840 
it all the way around so that it is
perfect<00:04:58.020> for<00:04:58.199> his<00:04:58.350> hand<00:04:58.650> and<00:04:58.860> shrink<00:04:59.729> it<00:04:59.789> down

00:04:59.840 --> 00:04:59.850 
perfect for his hand and shrink it down

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:05.629 
perfect for his hand and shrink it down
to<00:05:00.270> his<00:05:00.449> four-year-old<00:05:01.440> and<00:05:02.570> sizes<00:05:03.680> so<00:05:04.680> again

00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:05.639 
to his four-year-old and sizes so again

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:07.550 
to his four-year-old and sizes so again
you<00:05:05.880> just<00:05:05.910> kind<00:05:06.270> of<00:05:06.330> line<00:05:06.539> it<00:05:06.690> up<00:05:06.780> on<00:05:07.020> top<00:05:07.260> right

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.560 
you just kind of line it up on top right

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:11.450 
you just kind of line it up on top right
you<00:05:07.680> want<00:05:07.860> to<00:05:07.919> get<00:05:08.070> the<00:05:08.250> angle<00:05:08.960> perfect<00:05:10.460> this

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:11.460 
you want to get the angle perfect this

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:14.390 
you want to get the angle perfect this
free<00:05:11.789> transform<00:05:12.360> is<00:05:12.600> really<00:05:13.080> easy<00:05:13.320> to<00:05:14.250> get

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:14.400 
free transform is really easy to get

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.300 
free transform is really easy to get
things<00:05:14.699> in<00:05:14.970> and<00:05:15.440> then<00:05:16.440> you<00:05:16.530> can<00:05:16.710> decide<00:05:16.740> if<00:05:17.039> you

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:17.310 
things in and then you can decide if you

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:18.560 
things in and then you can decide if you
want<00:05:17.580> it<00:05:17.699> to<00:05:17.820> be<00:05:17.910> in<00:05:18.000> the<00:05:18.090> front<00:05:18.240> or<00:05:18.449> the<00:05:18.479> back

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:18.570 
want it to be in the front or the back

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:20.900 
want it to be in the front or the back
since<00:05:18.990> my<00:05:19.139> front<00:05:19.440> son's<00:05:20.190> foot<00:05:20.520> is<00:05:20.699> in<00:05:20.880> front

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:20.910 
since my front son's foot is in front

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:23.659 
since my front son's foot is in front
here<00:05:21.419> we'll<00:05:21.960> put<00:05:22.139> this<00:05:22.289> late<00:05:22.560> saber<00:05:22.949> in<00:05:23.220> behind

00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:23.669 
here we'll put this late saber in behind

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:27.050 
here we'll put this late saber in behind
so<00:05:24.419> that's<00:05:25.199> a<00:05:25.560> good<00:05:25.830> position<00:05:26.160> for<00:05:26.370> it<00:05:26.729> for<00:05:26.940> me

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.060 
so that's a good position for it for me

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:30.050 
so that's a good position for it for me
and<00:05:27.889> now<00:05:28.889> we'll<00:05:29.039> go<00:05:29.160> back<00:05:29.310> to<00:05:29.370> our<00:05:29.580> main<00:05:29.669> image

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:30.060 
and now we'll go back to our main image

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:35.240 
and now we'll go back to our main image
and<00:05:31.430> loop<00:05:32.430> out<00:05:32.669> my<00:05:33.030> youngest<00:05:33.479> son's<00:05:33.750> hands<00:05:34.349> the

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:35.250 
and loop out my youngest son's hands the

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:37.460 
and loop out my youngest son's hands the
parts<00:05:35.610> that<00:05:35.699> you<00:05:35.849> want<00:05:36.120> to<00:05:36.360> cut<00:05:36.630> and<00:05:36.810> paste<00:05:36.840> on

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:37.470 
parts that you want to cut and paste on

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:42.560 
parts that you want to cut and paste on
top<00:05:38.810> come<00:05:39.810> see<00:05:40.020> them<00:05:40.169> paste<00:05:40.979> them<00:05:41.250> and<00:05:41.570> then

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:42.570 
top come see them paste them and then

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:44.060 
top come see them paste them and then
we'll<00:05:42.690> bring<00:05:42.840> them<00:05:43.020> forward<00:05:43.320> as<00:05:43.560> a<00:05:43.590> new<00:05:43.800> layer

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:44.070 
we'll bring them forward as a new layer

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:48.700 
we'll bring them forward as a new layer
up<00:05:44.340> on<00:05:45.060> top<00:05:45.300> of<00:05:45.510> everything<00:05:46.039> right<00:05:47.039> there<00:05:47.940> and

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:48.710 
up on top of everything right there and

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:53.689 
up on top of everything right there and
bring<00:05:49.710> it<00:05:49.830> all<00:05:49.919> the<00:05:49.949> way<00:05:50.130> up<00:05:50.280> on<00:05:50.460> top<00:05:52.669> so<00:05:53.669> that

00:05:53.689 --> 00:05:53.699 
bring it all the way up on top so that

00:05:53.699 --> 00:05:56.629 
bring it all the way up on top so that
is<00:05:53.940> on<00:05:54.150> top<00:05:54.419> so<00:05:55.349> now<00:05:55.470> you<00:05:55.590> can<00:05:55.860> see<00:05:56.099> he<00:05:56.610> is

is on top so now you can see he is

00:05:56.639 --> 00:05:58.939 
is on top so now you can see he is
holding<00:05:57.389> the<00:05:57.900> lightsaber<00:05:58.349> actually<00:05:58.800> you<00:05:58.860> know

00:05:58.939 --> 00:05:58.949 
holding the lightsaber actually you know

00:05:58.949 --> 00:06:01.189 
holding the lightsaber actually you know
what<00:05:59.070> we're<00:05:59.580> going<00:05:59.729> to<00:06:00.050> we're<00:06:01.050> going<00:06:01.139> to

00:06:01.189 --> 00:06:01.199 
what we're going to we're going to

00:06:01.199 --> 00:06:03.290 
what we're going to we're going to
delete<00:06:01.710> just<00:06:02.010> a<00:06:02.099> little<00:06:02.370> bit<00:06:02.520> to<00:06:02.849> make<00:06:02.940> it<00:06:03.030> look

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:03.300 
delete just a little bit to make it look

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:08.210 
delete just a little bit to make it look
like<00:06:03.570> it<00:06:03.780> is<00:06:03.930> in<00:06:04.169> the<00:06:05.099> palm<00:06:05.340> of<00:06:05.370> his<00:06:05.699> hand<00:06:07.220> just

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:08.220

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:15.140 
like that so it looks like his hand is
coming<00:06:11.070> through<00:06:11.340> and<00:06:11.990> now<00:06:13.310> we'll<00:06:14.310> put<00:06:14.550> this
