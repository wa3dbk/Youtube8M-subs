00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:05.220
 hello today we prepare some asparagus 

00:00:02.729 --> 00:00:07.849
 green in tempura accompanied by a 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:11.210
 cheese sauce ingredients 

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:14.849
 green asparagus cheese gouda milk 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:17.210
 paprika and flour and ice water for 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.210
 tempura 

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:22.160
 we begin by melting a little 

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:26.349
 butter in a saucepan we add a 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.349
 teaspoon of flour and dissolve well 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:32.000
 then we add milk to make a 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.000
 very light bechamel 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:41.050
 then we cut the cheese in 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.050
 bits 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.820
 and we add them to the bechamel 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.829
 if needed we incorporate more milk 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.829
 to make it lighter 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:08.960
 and stir until the cheese is 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:11.740
 completely melted and then we add 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.740
 the paprika 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.830
 when everything is well mixed we remove 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.830
 of the fire and we reserve 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.509
 Now let's prepare the tempura 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.220
 adding ice water to the flour 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:28.320
 stir well until there is a dough 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.030
 neither very thick nor very liquid 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.000
 finally we place it on some 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.950
 ice to keep it very cold 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.960
 then we cut the ends of 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.320
 the asparagus and we review them in the 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.320
 tempura 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:46.180
 then fry them in a pan with 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.310
 very hot oil when they start to 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:51.720
 we practice the asparagus and the 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.720
 we drain on a grid 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:57.490
 it only remains to place them on the plate in 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:02:00.450
 this case we are going to put them in the form of 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.450
 stacked logs 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:12.570
 we accompany with the cheese sauce 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.570
 and that's it until soon
