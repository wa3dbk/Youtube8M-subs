ultimately<00:01:19.000> i<00:01:19.180> think<00:01:19.420> the<00:01:19.510> mobile<00:01:19.840> robots<00:01:20.290> are

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:20.440

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:13.359 
robot means making it bigger power is a

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:15.629 
robot means making it bigger power is a
problem<00:04:13.780> if<00:04:14.440> a<00:04:14.650> robot<00:04:14.799> is<00:04:15.190> in<00:04:15.370> a<00:04:15.489> remote

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:15.639 
problem if a robot is in a remote

00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:16.920 
problem if a robot is in a remote
environment<00:04:16.180> like<00:04:16.239> that<00:04:16.389> it<00:04:16.510> has<00:04:16.539> to<00:04:16.750> provide

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
environment like that it has to provide

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:18.599 
environment like that it has to provide
its<00:04:17.109> own<00:04:17.260> power<00:04:17.500> so<00:04:17.829> there's<00:04:18.010> you<00:04:18.220> need<00:04:18.370> space

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:18.609 
its own power so there's you need space

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:21.390 
its own power so there's you need space
for<00:04:18.789> batteries<00:04:19.919> transmitting<00:04:20.919> video<00:04:21.010> is<00:04:21.370> a

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 
for batteries transmitting video is a

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.339 
for batteries transmitting video is a
challenging<00:04:21.910> thing<00:04:21.970> and<00:04:22.330> Surgeons<00:04:23.020> demand

00:04:23.339 --> 00:04:23.349 
challenging thing and Surgeons demand

00:04:23.349 --> 00:04:26.310 
challenging thing and Surgeons demand
really<00:04:23.650> high<00:04:23.830> quality<00:04:24.099> video<00:04:25.080> that's<00:04:26.080> the

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.320 
really high quality video that's the

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.200 
really high quality video that's the
image<00:04:26.590> there<00:04:26.979> and<00:04:27.190> then<00:04:27.580> the<00:04:27.760> other<00:04:27.789> issue<00:04:28.090> is

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.210 
image there and then the other issue is

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:30.409 
image there and then the other issue is
getting<00:04:28.410> commands<00:04:29.410> into<00:04:29.740> the<00:04:29.830> robot<00:04:30.130> itself

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:30.419 
getting commands into the robot itself

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:32.459 
getting commands into the robot itself
again<00:04:31.419> you<00:04:31.539> want<00:04:31.690> to<00:04:31.780> have<00:04:31.870> a<00:04:31.930> low-power

00:04:32.459 --> 00:04:32.469 
again you want to have a low-power

00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:35.260 
again you want to have a low-power
receiver<00:04:32.979> which<00:04:33.789> is<00:04:33.909> a<00:04:33.940> challenge<00:04:34.360> as<00:04:34.479> well

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:35.270 
receiver which is a challenge as well

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.370 
receiver which is a challenge as well

this will be what we got going on is we

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:08.670 
we use for all our devices and it's you

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:11.120 
we use for all our devices and it's you

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:11.130 
can see it's it's very small we'd like

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:14.630 
can see it's it's very small we'd like

to have it half this size for now the

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:17.010 
goal is to make the robots work then

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:19.130 
goal is to make the robots work then
worry<00:05:17.310> about<00:05:17.430> the<00:05:17.640> size<00:05:17.970> of<00:05:18.150> them<00:05:18.300> it's<00:05:18.930> also

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:19.140 
worry about the size of them it's also

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:21.290 
worry about the size of them it's also
about<00:05:19.320> making<00:05:19.590> them<00:05:19.890> safe<00:05:20.190> for<00:05:20.790> potential
