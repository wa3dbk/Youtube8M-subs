first c7 didn't realize they made two so
that's<00:00:14.190> the<00:00:14.340> thing<00:00:15.080> but<00:00:16.080> anyways<00:00:16.470> I<00:00:17.369> figured

exactly what it was except now it's
molded<00:00:30.269> into<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:30.570> car<00:00:30.869> and<00:00:30.900> have<00:00:31.260> that<00:00:31.410> sort

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
molded into the car and have that sort

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.459 
molded into the car and have that sort
of<00:00:31.650> back<00:00:32.579> window<00:00:33.030> all<00:00:33.239> that<00:00:33.570> is<00:00:33.719> made<00:00:34.020> so

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
of back window all that is made so

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.500 
of back window all that is made so
whenever<00:00:34.710> they<00:00:34.890> do<00:00:34.950> make<00:00:35.790> a<00:00:35.820> racing<00:00:36.360> version

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
whenever they do make a racing version

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.049 
whenever they do make a racing version
of<00:00:36.840> this<00:00:37.020> car<00:00:37.370> they<00:00:38.370> won't<00:00:38.550> have<00:00:38.670> to<00:00:38.790> sort<00:00:38.969> of

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
of this car they won't have to sort of

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.270 
of this car they won't have to sort of
tear<00:00:40.050> into<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.379> body<00:00:40.559> and<00:00:40.739> all<00:00:40.860> that<00:00:41.100> cuz

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
tear into the body and all that cuz

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.520 
tear into the body and all that cuz
the<00:00:41.460> little<00:00:41.910> vent<00:00:42.870> that<00:00:42.989> they<00:00:43.140> have<00:00:43.320> in<00:00:43.440> the

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
the little vent that they have in the

the little vent that they have in the
back<00:00:43.649> of<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:43.860> car<00:00:44.040> every<00:00:45.000> time<00:00:45.149> we're<00:00:45.300> going

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
back of the car every time we're going

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.360 
back of the car every time we're going
to<00:00:45.480> work<00:00:45.690> on<00:00:45.930> it<00:00:46.110> they<00:00:46.590> have<00:00:46.739> to<00:00:46.829> take<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.160> vent

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
to work on it they have to take the vent

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.250 
to work on it they have to take the vent
out<00:00:47.520> do<00:00:47.820> all<00:00:47.969> this<00:00:48.149> stuff<00:00:48.210> and<00:00:48.539> then<00:00:48.719> remove<00:00:49.079> it

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
out do all this stuff and then remove it

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.119 
out do all this stuff and then remove it
so<00:00:49.850> no<00:00:50.850> to<00:00:50.910> help<00:00:51.440> alleviate<00:00:52.440> some<00:00:53.010> of<00:00:53.039> that

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
so no to help alleviate some of that

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.430 
so no to help alleviate some of that
it's<00:00:53.699> already<00:00:53.910> built<00:00:54.090> into<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.449> car<00:00:54.660> ready<00:00:55.260> to

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
it's already built into the car ready to

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.520 
it's already built into the car ready to
go<00:00:55.620> but<00:00:56.399> anyways<00:00:56.730> here's<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.600> current<00:00:58.109> know

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:12.790 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.860 

did<00:01:13.420> it<00:01:13.540> grow<00:01:13.690> on<00:01:13.900> you<00:01:14.340> it<00:01:15.340> did<00:01:15.790> felt<00:01:16.600> like<00:01:16.660> it

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:16.870 
did it grow on you it did felt like it

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:19.310 
did it grow on you it did felt like it
wanted<00:01:17.200> to<00:01:17.260> but<00:01:17.680> it<00:01:17.770> still<00:01:18.010> just<00:01:18.040> wasn't<00:01:18.640> there

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
wanted to but it still just wasn't there

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:25.350 
wanted to but it still just wasn't there
yeah<00:01:20.320> the<00:01:20.680> front<00:01:20.950> end<00:01:21.190> again<00:01:22.150> I<00:01:23.970> it<00:01:24.970> has<00:01:25.240> the

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:25.360 
yeah the front end again I it has the

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.090 
yeah the front end again I it has the
potential<00:01:25.690> to<00:01:25.810> look<00:01:26.050> like<00:01:26.200> a<00:01:26.230> badass<00:01:26.500> car<00:01:26.650> but

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.100 
potential to look like a badass car but

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.310 
potential to look like a badass car but
just<00:01:27.880> I<00:01:28.210> don't<00:01:28.330> know<00:01:28.480> something<00:01:28.780> about<00:01:28.930> it<00:01:29.230> I

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:29.320 
just I don't know something about it I

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.070 
just I don't know something about it I
just<00:01:29.350> it<00:01:30.190> doesn't<00:01:30.430> ring<00:01:30.760> with<00:01:30.970> me<00:01:31.120> so<00:01:31.660> it<00:01:31.960> might

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.080 
just it doesn't ring with me so it might

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.980 
just it doesn't ring with me so it might
just<00:01:32.260> be<00:01:32.470> I<00:01:32.800> have<00:01:33.070> bad<00:01:33.790> taste<00:01:34.240> and<00:01:34.540> what<00:01:34.720> cars

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:34.990 
just be I have bad taste and what cars

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.800 
just be I have bad taste and what cars
should<00:01:35.229> look<00:01:35.440> like<00:01:35.760> but<00:01:36.760> no<00:01:37.210> that's<00:01:37.420> just<00:01:37.600> me

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
should look like but no that's just me

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:39.900 
should look like but no that's just me
you<00:01:38.229> do<00:01:38.350> get<00:01:38.500> the<00:01:38.620> carbon<00:01:38.920> fiber<00:01:39.130> hood<00:01:39.460> you<00:01:39.760> get

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:39.910 
you do get the carbon fiber hood you get

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:42.630 
you do get the carbon fiber hood you get
the<00:01:40.000> carbon-fibre<00:01:40.630> bonnet<00:01:41.490> now<00:01:42.490> of<00:01:42.610> course

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 
the carbon-fibre bonnet now of course

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.040 
the carbon-fibre bonnet now of course
there's<00:01:43.030> everything<00:01:43.360> else<00:01:43.770> and<00:01:44.770> since<00:01:45.070> the

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:46.050 
there's everything else and since the

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:48.330 
there's everything else and since the
mechanics<00:01:47.050> of<00:01:47.140> the<00:01:47.229> game<00:01:47.259> or<00:01:47.830> the<00:01:47.979> mechanics

mechanics of the game or the mechanics

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:49.950 
mechanics of the game or the mechanics
of<00:01:48.400> the<00:01:48.520> car<00:01:48.700> are<00:01:48.910> unchanged<00:01:49.540> from<00:01:49.660> one

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:49.960 
of the car are unchanged from one

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.230 
of the car are unchanged from one
prototype<00:01:50.259> to<00:01:50.590> the<00:01:50.650> next<00:01:50.950> I<00:01:51.100> figured<00:01:51.790> I'd<00:01:51.940> do

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
prototype to the next I figured I'd do

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.540 
prototype to the next I figured I'd do
you<00:01:52.270> know<00:01:52.690> 10,000<00:01:53.470> meter<00:01:53.590> run<00:01:53.860> see<00:01:54.340> what<00:01:54.460> this

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:54.550 
you know 10,000 meter run see what this

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:57.600 
you know 10,000 meter run see what this
car<00:01:54.759> can<00:01:54.790> get<00:01:55.060> up<00:01:55.210> to<00:01:55.390> and<00:01:56.160> you<00:01:57.160> know<00:01:57.280> just<00:01:57.310> to

they<00:02:18.519> used<00:02:18.760> the<00:02:19.030> correct<00:02:19.630> ratios<00:02:20.260> because

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
they used the correct ratios because

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.320 
they used the correct ratios because

gear<00:02:22.690> and<00:02:23.590> then<00:02:23.709> half<00:02:23.920> seven<00:02:24.250> doesn't

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
gear and then half seven doesn't

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:27.570 
gear and then half seven doesn't
overdrive<00:02:25.030> but<00:02:25.950> to<00:02:26.950> me<00:02:27.100> it<00:02:27.250> sort<00:02:27.430> of<00:02:27.459> feels

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
overdrive but to me it sort of feels

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.090 
overdrive but to me it sort of feels
like<00:02:27.820> they<00:02:28.000> slopped<00:02:28.390> in<00:02:28.630> the<00:02:28.870> c6<00:02:29.620> shorten<00:02:30.010> it

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
like they slopped in the c6 shorten it

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:31.920 
like they slopped in the c6 shorten it
up<00:02:30.190> a<00:02:30.310> bit<00:02:30.340> and<00:02:30.610> added<00:02:30.820> a<00:02:31.030> seventh<00:02:31.390> here<00:02:31.540> just

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
up a bit and added a seventh here just

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.380 
up a bit and added a seventh here just
for<00:02:32.110> shits<00:02:32.260> and<00:02:32.440> giggles<00:02:32.730> so<00:02:33.730> that's<00:02:34.090> kind<00:02:34.330> of

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
for shits and giggles so that's kind of

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.090

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
like it's just at the exact same spots

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.820 
like it's just at the exact same spots
of<00:02:37.810> the<00:02:37.900> c6<00:02:38.410> maybe<00:02:39.190> just<00:02:39.489> like<00:02:39.640> a<00:02:39.790> hair<00:02:40.030> shorter

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
of the c6 maybe just like a hair shorter

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:45.240

courses<00:02:47.590> Japan's<00:02:47.920> meters<00:02:50.160> just<00:02:51.160> notice<00:02:51.430> that

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:51.549 
courses Japan's meters just notice that

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:54.870 
courses Japan's meters just notice that
the<00:02:51.640> top<00:02:51.790> speed<00:02:52.060> does<00:02:52.330> get<00:02:52.570> no<00:02:53.880> relatively

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
the top speed does get no relatively

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.860 
the top speed does get no relatively
high<00:02:55.090> especially<00:02:55.450> for<00:02:56.070> 400<00:02:57.070> 241<00:02:57.580> horsepower

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
high especially for 400 241 horsepower

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.660 
high especially for 400 241 horsepower
but<00:02:58.870> it<00:02:59.049> is<00:02:59.200> possible<00:02:59.500> I'm<00:03:00.100> the<00:03:00.310> ain't<00:03:00.519> gonna

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
but it is possible I'm the ain't gonna

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:01.770 
but it is possible I'm the ain't gonna
say<00:03:00.820> it's<00:03:00.940> not<00:03:01.030> especially<00:03:01.150> since<00:03:01.540> we're<00:03:01.690> you

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
say it's not especially since we're you

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.810 
say it's not especially since we're you
know<00:03:01.900> take<00:03:02.500> a<00:03:02.530> sling<00:03:02.920> downhill<00:03:03.489> and<00:03:03.670> you'll

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:03.820 
know take a sling downhill and you'll

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.210 
know take a sling downhill and you'll
see<00:03:04.000> me<00:03:04.150> sort<00:03:04.360> of<00:03:04.450> her<00:03:04.630> this<00:03:05.560> right<00:03:05.709> here<00:03:05.890> I<00:03:05.920> was

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
see me sort of her this right here I was

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.400 
see me sort of her this right here I was
wasn't<00:03:06.850> even<00:03:07.030> sure<00:03:07.060> if<00:03:07.360> they<00:03:07.480> had<00:03:07.690> 27<00:03:08.019> gears

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 
wasn't even sure if they had 27 gears

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:11.100 
wasn't even sure if they had 27 gears
and<00:03:09.130> I<00:03:09.280> was<00:03:09.459> like<00:03:09.610> oh<00:03:09.820> maybe<00:03:10.299> I<00:03:10.690> should

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 
and I was like oh maybe I should

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.380 
and I was like oh maybe I should
probably<00:03:11.350> check<00:03:12.070> this<00:03:12.370> out<00:03:12.670> no<00:03:12.940> just<00:03:13.150> to<00:03:13.209> see

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
probably check this out no just to see

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:15.720 
probably check this out no just to see
if<00:03:13.450> they<00:03:13.570> got<00:03:13.600> that<00:03:14.019> right<00:03:14.380> and<00:03:14.650> you<00:03:15.580> will<00:03:15.670> see

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
if they got that right and you will see

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.430 
if they got that right and you will see
they<00:03:16.000> actually<00:03:16.360> do<00:03:16.540> but<00:03:16.840> like<00:03:16.959> i<00:03:17.080> said<00:03:17.110> the

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
they actually do but like i said the

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.130 
they actually do but like i said the
ratios<00:03:17.890> are<00:03:18.100> kind<00:03:18.730> of<00:03:19.000> off<00:03:19.209> from<00:03:19.810> what<00:03:20.019> they

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
ratios are kind of off from what they

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:21.190 
ratios are kind of off from what they
probably<00:03:20.440> will<00:03:20.950> be

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
probably will be

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.010 
probably will be
your<00:03:21.440> life<00:03:22.060> being<00:03:23.060> gran<00:03:23.239> turismo<00:03:23.629> they<00:03:23.780> might

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:24.020 
your life being gran turismo they might

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:26.710 
your life being gran turismo they might
you<00:03:24.290> know<00:03:24.440> throw<00:03:25.160> in<00:03:25.310> a<00:03:25.400> patch<00:03:25.610> and<00:03:25.970> fix<00:03:26.269> it<00:03:26.450> but

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
you know throw in a patch and fix it but

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.390 
you know throw in a patch and fix it but
since<00:03:27.200> the<00:03:27.319> cars<00:03:27.500> are<00:03:27.709> here<00:03:27.860> I<00:03:28.010> really<00:03:28.250> don't

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
since the cars are here I really don't

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.300 
since the cars are here I really don't
think<00:03:28.430> they<00:03:28.670> probably<00:03:29.000> will<00:03:29.739> reward<00:03:30.739> soldiers

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
think they probably will reward soldiers

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:32.800 
think they probably will reward soldiers
right<00:03:31.489> and<00:03:31.730> fifth<00:03:31.910> gear<00:03:32.120> out<00:03:32.269> as<00:03:32.420> long<00:03:32.540> as<00:03:32.599> I

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
right and fifth gear out as long as I

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:35.979 
right and fifth gear out as long as I
could<00:03:32.870> just<00:03:34.060> see<00:03:35.060> where<00:03:35.300> I<00:03:35.330> could<00:03:35.569> go<00:03:35.690> and<00:03:35.900> I

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:35.989 
could just see where I could go and I

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:37.479 
could just see where I could go and I
think<00:03:36.230> you<00:03:36.349> around<00:03:36.530> here<00:03:36.769> so<00:03:36.860> yeah<00:03:37.040> I<00:03:37.310> was

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:37.489 
think you around here so yeah I was

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:39.339 
think you around here so yeah I was
testing<00:03:37.849> out<00:03:37.970> do<00:03:38.420> I<00:03:38.480> have<00:03:38.569> a<00:03:38.630> seventh<00:03:39.050> then<00:03:39.200> I

00:03:39.339 --> 00:03:39.349 
testing out do I have a seventh then I

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:42.970 
testing out do I have a seventh then I
do<00:03:39.489> so<00:03:40.930> there<00:03:41.930> you<00:03:41.959> go<00:03:42.050> for<00:03:42.620> those<00:03:42.739> of<00:03:42.860> you<00:03:42.890> who

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980 
do so there you go for those of you who

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.280 
do so there you go for those of you who
want<00:03:43.099> to<00:03:43.190> know<00:03:43.370> this<00:03:43.970> is<00:03:44.150> the<00:03:44.390> 7-speed<00:03:45.260> manual

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 
want to know this is the 7-speed manual

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:47.080 
want to know this is the 7-speed manual
not<00:03:45.830> the<00:03:45.920> six-speed<00:03:46.340> automatic<00:03:46.849> that<00:03:47.000> they

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
not the six-speed automatic that they

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:50.650 
not the six-speed automatic that they
gave<00:03:47.299> us<00:03:47.450> so<00:03:47.660> thank<00:03:48.560> you<00:03:48.739> for<00:03:48.769> that<00:03:49.510> other<00:03:50.510> than

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:50.660 
gave us so thank you for that other than

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:52.119 
gave us so thank you for that other than
that<00:03:50.840> this<00:03:50.930> video<00:03:51.319> relays<00:03:51.560> have<00:03:51.590> a<00:03:51.769> point<00:03:51.980> to

00:03:52.119 --> 00:03:52.129 
that this video relays have a point to

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:53.650 
that this video relays have a point to
showing<00:03:52.430> off<00:03:52.519> the<00:03:52.670> car<00:03:52.849> sort<00:03:53.209> of<00:03:53.269> showing<00:03:53.540> off

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:53.660 
showing off the car sort of showing off

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:55.960 
showing off the car sort of showing off
its<00:03:54.130> theoretical<00:03:55.130> top<00:03:55.340> speed<00:03:55.640> which<00:03:55.849> I

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:55.970 
its theoretical top speed which I

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:58.199 
its theoretical top speed which I
believe<00:03:56.180> they<00:03:56.360> list<00:03:57.080> at<00:03:57.170> the<00:03:57.260> top<00:03:57.290> speed<00:03:57.799> to<00:03:57.980> be

00:03:58.199 --> 00:03:58.209 
believe they list at the top speed to be

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:02.860 
believe they list at the top speed to be
somewhere<00:03:59.209> around<00:03:59.260> 180<00:04:00.260> s<00:04:00.880> so<00:04:01.880> like<00:04:02.690> I<00:04:02.810> said

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
somewhere around 180 s so like I said

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:07.240 
somewhere around 180 s so like I said
this<00:04:03.170> is<00:04:03.500> probably<00:04:04.459> just<00:04:06.920> it<00:04:07.040> thrown

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.250 
this is probably just it thrown

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:09.130 
this is probably just it thrown
together<00:04:07.400> with<00:04:07.880> no<00:04:08.150> their<00:04:08.360> physics<00:04:08.780> sort<00:04:09.049> of

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:09.140 
together with no their physics sort of

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:10.690 
together with no their physics sort of
trying<00:04:09.349> to<00:04:09.470> figure<00:04:10.099> out<00:04:10.160> what<00:04:10.370> the<00:04:10.459> car<00:04:10.670> can

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:10.700 
trying to figure out what the car can

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:14.770 
trying to figure out what the car can
actually<00:04:11.690> do<00:04:12.790> but<00:04:13.790> who<00:04:13.880> knows<00:04:14.090> you<00:04:14.690> know

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 
actually do but who knows you know

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:16.390 
actually do but who knows you know
that's<00:04:14.959> just<00:04:15.380> the<00:04:15.470> thing<00:04:15.500> guy<00:04:15.829> I<00:04:16.010> wasn't<00:04:16.190> using

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
that's just the thing guy I wasn't using

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:17.920 
that's just the thing guy I wasn't using
my<00:04:16.519> will<00:04:16.760> as<00:04:16.970> using<00:04:17.209> my<00:04:17.269> controller<00:04:17.630> for<00:04:17.810> this

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:17.930 
my will as using my controller for this

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:20.080 
my will as using my controller for this
one<00:04:18.079> someone's<00:04:18.350> gonna<00:04:18.470> make<00:04:18.650> it<00:04:18.739> back<00:04:18.829> up<00:04:19.090> so

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.090 
one someone's gonna make it back up so

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:21.879 
one someone's gonna make it back up so
that's<00:04:20.389> a<00:04:20.510> thing<00:04:20.660> and<00:04:20.810> then<00:04:20.900> I<00:04:21.019> try<00:04:21.560> to<00:04:21.590> see<00:04:21.829> if

00:04:21.879 --> 00:04:21.889 
that's a thing and then I try to see if

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:39.570 
that's a thing and then I try to see if
I<00:04:21.950> can<00:04:22.100> get<00:04:22.190> a<00:04:22.250> little<00:04:22.430> sound<00:04:22.700> clip<00:04:23.030> but<00:04:23.300> it's

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:39.580 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:43.490 

you

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:43.500 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.700 

so<00:04:44.280> yeah<00:04:44.790> gt5<00:04:45.510> doing<00:04:45.930> their<00:04:46.140> thing<00:04:46.470> with

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
so yeah gt5 doing their thing with

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:49.550 
so yeah gt5 doing their thing with
sounds<00:04:47.340> again<00:04:48.210> i<00:04:48.540> have<00:04:48.960> a<00:04:48.990> dolby<00:04:49.530> digital

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 
sounds again i have a dolby digital

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.320 
sounds again i have a dolby digital

single<00:04:56.460> way<00:04:56.630> but<00:04:57.630> I<00:04:57.660> just<00:04:58.080> assure<00:04:58.350> that<00:04:58.380> there

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:58.650 
single way but I just assure that there

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:00.290 
single way but I just assure that there
is<00:04:58.740> no<00:04:58.890> real<00:04:59.130> mechanical<00:04:59.640> difference<00:04:59.970> between

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:00.300 
is no real mechanical difference between

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:01.910 
is no real mechanical difference between
this<00:05:00.540> and<00:05:00.600> the<00:05:00.990> actual<00:05:01.410> you<00:05:01.560> know<00:05:01.620> first

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:01.920 
this and the actual you know first

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:03.950 
this and the actual you know first
prototype<00:05:02.370> that<00:05:02.400> I<00:05:02.640> did<00:05:02.880> go<00:05:03.510> ahead<00:05:03.570> and<00:05:03.660> I<00:05:03.780> show

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:03.960 
prototype that I did go ahead and I show

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:06.620 
prototype that I did go ahead and I show
you<00:05:03.990> the<00:05:04.080> stats<00:05:04.380> here<00:05:04.680> as<00:05:04.830> you<00:05:05.430> can<00:05:05.550> tell<00:05:05.630> 441

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:06.630 
you the stats here as you can tell 441

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:08.750 
you the stats here as you can tell 441
horsepower<00:05:07.200> or<00:05:07.530> 452<00:05:08.250> pound-feet<00:05:08.580> of<00:05:08.610> torque

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:08.760 
horsepower or 452 pound-feet of torque

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:10.790 
horsepower or 452 pound-feet of torque
you<00:05:09.240> know<00:05:09.330> 40<00:05:09.600> kilograms<00:05:10.020> performance

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 
you know 40 kilograms performance

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:15.710 
you know 40 kilograms performance
points5<00:05:11.160> 21<00:05:11.610> I<00:05:11.820> think<00:05:12.630> the<00:05:12.870> one<00:05:13.170> I<00:05:14.390> was<00:05:15.390> reading

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:15.720 
points5 21 I think the one I was reading

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:18.650 
points5 21 I think the one I was reading
the<00:05:16.400> test<00:05:17.400> prototype<00:05:17.880> I<00:05:18.030> have<00:05:18.150> in<00:05:18.270> my<00:05:18.360> screen

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:18.660 
the test prototype I have in my screen

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:20.690 
the test prototype I have in my screen
so<00:05:18.900> I<00:05:18.960> really<00:05:19.140> can't<00:05:19.320> see<00:05:19.500> but<00:05:19.740> I<00:05:19.919> think<00:05:20.490> the

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:20.700 
so I really can't see but I think the

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:22.790 
so I really can't see but I think the
other<00:05:20.850> one<00:05:21.030> has<00:05:21.240> like<00:05:21.510> one<00:05:21.720> more<00:05:22.169> horsepower

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:22.800 
other one has like one more horsepower

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.240 
other one has like one more horsepower
than<00:05:23.270> this<00:05:24.270> one<00:05:24.510> so<00:05:24.720> it's<00:05:25.169> really<00:05:25.560> not<00:05:25.830> too<00:05:25.890> big

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:26.250 
than this one so it's really not too big

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:27.920 
than this one so it's really not too big
of<00:05:26.370> a<00:05:26.430> difference<00:05:26.580> but<00:05:26.910> yeah<00:05:27.540> there<00:05:27.810> you<00:05:27.900> go

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:27.930 
of a difference but yeah there you go

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:29.600 
of a difference but yeah there you go
hope<00:05:28.230> you<00:05:28.380> enjoyed<00:05:28.680> this<00:05:28.890> catch-all<00:05:29.370> later

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:29.610 
hope you enjoyed this catch-all later

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:32.600 
hope you enjoyed this catch-all later
and<00:05:29.880> peace<00:05:30.330> out
