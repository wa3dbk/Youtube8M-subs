trust<00:00:54.660> and<00:00:54.930> respect<00:00:55.379> and<00:00:55.649> I<00:00:56.129> did<00:00:56.370> that<00:00:56.640> through

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
trust and respect and I did that through

five golden rules here's a little trick

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.860 
five golden rules here's a little trick
though<00:01:01.739> that<00:01:02.100> helped<00:01:02.340> me<00:01:02.460> establish<00:01:02.579> a<00:01:03.180> little

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
though that helped me establish a little

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.980 
though that helped me establish a little
bit<00:01:03.960> more<00:01:04.110> respect<00:01:04.530> on<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.830> walk<00:01:05.659> one<00:01:06.659> very

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
bit more respect on the walk one very

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.899 
bit more respect on the walk one very
simple<00:01:07.320> way<00:01:07.470> of<00:01:07.619> getting<00:01:07.799> her<00:01:08.340> to<00:01:08.369> change<00:01:08.790> a

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
simple way of getting her to change a

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.969 
simple way of getting her to change a
behavior<00:01:09.060> is<00:01:09.630> to<00:01:09.990> put<00:01:10.170> a<00:01:10.200> little<00:01:10.530> chain

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
behavior is to put a little chain

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.550 
behavior is to put a little chain
through<00:01:11.820> her<00:01:12.090> collar<00:01:12.390> and<00:01:12.689> so<00:01:13.260> that<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.530> first

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
through her collar and so that the first
