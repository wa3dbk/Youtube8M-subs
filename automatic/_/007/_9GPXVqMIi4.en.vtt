00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
to see for myself how much damage a

to see for myself how much damage a
pothole<00:00:43.530> could<00:00:43.770> do<00:00:43.950> because<00:00:44.370> getting<00:00:44.820> cars

like<00:00:48.030> mine<00:00:50.930> now<00:00:51.930> what<00:00:52.079> if<00:00:52.170> I<00:00:52.260> told<00:00:52.320> you<00:00:52.590> that

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
like mine now what if I told you that

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:53.990 
like mine now what if I told you that
might<00:00:52.829> just<00:00:53.010> be<00:00:53.070> a<00:00:53.160> solution<00:00:53.670> not<00:00:53.820> to

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
might just be a solution not to

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.029 
might just be a solution not to
repairing<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.539> potholes<00:00:54.960> themselves<00:00:55.559> but

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
repairing the potholes themselves but

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.889 
repairing the potholes themselves but
actually<00:00:56.399> to<00:00:56.520> repairing<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.000> damage<00:00:57.390> done<00:00:57.870> to

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
actually to repairing the damage done to

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.360 
actually to repairing the damage done to
your<00:00:58.020> vehicle<00:00:58.649> by<00:00:58.949> those<00:00:59.340> evil<00:00:59.670> potholes<00:01:01.309> hmm

much evidence as possible about the

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.969 
much evidence as possible about the
beastly<00:01:44.939> pothole<00:01:45.450> now<00:01:46.140> as<00:01:46.380> it<00:01:46.530> is<00:01:46.649> in<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.829> road

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
beastly pothole now as it is in the road

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.560 
beastly pothole now as it is in the road
make<00:01:47.130> sure<00:01:47.280> no<00:01:47.460> cars<00:01:47.729> coming<00:01:48.119> the<00:01:48.149> first<00:01:48.450> thing

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570
