00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.490
 to death but here year I also have a 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.680
 trip is not kidding I have already planned 56 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.150
 tricks more hidden in my sleeve the 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.900
 trick not so for the same months and 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:30.029
 we have tricks for going the trick today is 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.320
 duplicate objects was 1.8 on Friday 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.590
 past I brought a trick to duplicate 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.030
 objects some points is to say 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.710
 in the information of this video you have 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.780
 also the other way that there is to 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.370
 duplicate objects in 1.8 that came up 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.739
 now agree it is possible that more 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.540
 go ahead as there are more forms and I'll go 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:45.890
 putting all the information together 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.380
 of the video so that in some way 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.940
 you have shown possible ways and 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:53.449
 you choose the one you like the most 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:56.180
 worth modeling today's is a mushroom is 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:59.030
 very brutal is very heavy vale is very but 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:01.970
 very very very heavy so nothing we are going to 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.379
 we start to fall down here and we're going to 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:06.320
 first of all I encourage you to do 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:08.060
 a clock is worth a watch as a dispenser 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.780
 it is not obligatory to do this 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:14.659
 not much less but the truth that is going 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:17.090
 to help pretty remember 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:19.789
 How to make this watch is easy 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:22.490
 so in agreement so simple I'm going to do 

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:23.869
 this here and I put this here and it's 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.159
 it's that simple 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:28.789
 there's more you can both up to here from 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:30.380
 rest and you have the torch and do it 

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:33.500
 done you remove and put it is previously 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.119
 so that to create it and it is already then in 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.609
 As long as we put something here, the value is missing 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:39.859
 according While this this we will come 

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:42.469
 well this is an interesting point not 

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:44.149
 I say again it is not necessary to 

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:45.979
 do it but if you have and the resources 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:48.289
 needed to do this do 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:49.909
 ok because now very well 

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:52.170
 good that we are going to need we are going to 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:54.380
 paint tdt 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.930
 a lever 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.210
 a chest and the object that we want 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.189
 duplicate and multiply to become a 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:05.110
 diamond block because I think the 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:07.670
 mancheta we can 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:09.110
 the movement when the most important thing 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.750
 that you must know in agreement so that we 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.580
 work is the tube that I use there 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.670
 many different ways but is that the 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.659
 tnt has up to 8 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:21.110
 bursts of type many seconds and 

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:24.890
 it is full of grace one two three four 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:26.690
 five six seven and eighth 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.670
 seven below so I do not break the 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:31.580
 ground and everything go the shit 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:34.000
 so we put our lever and we 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.000
 try mind 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.959
 but sorry calm of zero that you 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:43.550
 wrong for you to see that the trick 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:45.140
 it works, you put us 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:48.140
 the block we have to put it inside 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:51.320
 It is worth that you are so that to take a 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:54.230
 block at the point in almost sneeze 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:56.569
 but not a block of the chest what 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:59.829
 we can drag it out 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:03.499
 in agreement we can touch the key like this 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:06.410
 click and take it or we can with the 

00:03:03.499 --> 00:03:08.370
 numerical 1 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:10.620
 two 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:13.110
 3 voucher 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.190
 I tried it with everyone with this one 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.780
 will give time for agreements and 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:19.440
 we drag you will not give you time and it's going to 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.909
 be chaos is done if it does not work either 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:25.330
 at least it does not work even once 

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:28.540
 but if you do 1 2 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:30.340
 is 4 and 5 in the numerical if it is left 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.400
 time I alone you are worth 1 and the one 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:35.800
 better I have agreed well not 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.540
 it works always good that is to say it costs 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.890
 that works in agreement so that 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.600
 work now we 'll see what it has 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:43.420
 to get out of the diamond is worth because 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:46.810
 they call you will appear some weird letters 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:49.330
 you will say what is that worth and now story is 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:51.580
 important also is that right now 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:52.840
 I'm going to do the video once 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:55.270
 It's possible that it might come out 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.770
 I got out but if I do not get out I'll continue 

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:58.960
 trying until I get out and I go 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:00.760
 to cut all the time that has 

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:03.370
 is worth it so you have everything from 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:07.900
 hit so good we would be the 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:11.850
 diamond can start is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.850
 there is no time 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:23.050
 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 12 

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:25.420
 guasch and things finally finally has me 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:26.920
 really come out and today you are not going to 

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:28.570
 believe at least I've been 30 times 

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:30.790
 trying the very silly guy saying 1 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:34.150
 2 3 but like a fool literally 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:35.800
 good now as you see has been 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:38.740
 a diamond from the ground and it has come to me 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:42.190
 me another one here that puts zero is worth that if 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:46.120
 I take this here and I right click me 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:47.500
 goes out 1200 throwing diamonds worth and 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.300
 Besaya handling in diamonds 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:53.170
 what are we going to do we are going to come to 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:54.730
 clock is worth and we put our minus 14 and 

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:57.160
 will start generating diamonds as a 

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:59.290
 crazy, but like crazy has been played 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:01.360
 the diamond is an insane -0 they were going to 

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:04.600
 launch - - - go here 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:06.190
 - - - and even expelling diamonds all 

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:08.110
 your life is worth now you are going to be able to 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:09.249
 pick up and they are really diamonds like 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:11.799
 you see 

00:05:09.249 --> 00:05:14.109
 You see any diamond is for 

00:05:11.799 --> 00:05:15.999
 bore without any problem and power 

00:05:14.109 --> 00:05:19.719
 create I will be able to do what the 

00:05:15.999 --> 00:05:21.669
 Real wins in accordance as you see does not happen 

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:23.859
 nothing this will continue here less so many 

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:26.180
 and will continue to be eternally worth growing 

00:05:23.859 --> 00:05:28.940
 wonders with this 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:32.380
 it's flowerpots and it's literally a stage 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:34.630
 you will lose fat is a super gt 

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:36.220
 that's why it's watch is mainly because 

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:37.780
 that so you do not have to be 

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:40.480
 by right clicking against mind 

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:41.890
 like a fool like what you are 

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:43.690
 doing and I love you hours of disgust the 

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:45.910
 door bored a lot you can a 

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:48.340
 watch and wings come jump to the diamond 

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:51.210
 successful diamonds more plus more I come 

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:55.380
 around here and I say today 

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:58.139
 come diamond and then the roads 

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:59.900
 work be the end thank you so you have not 

00:05:58.139 --> 00:06:02.479
 there was a doctor 

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:03.979
 and here more when I made this voucher is the 

00:06:02.479 --> 00:06:07.070
 diamond party by saying a way 

00:06:03.979 --> 00:06:09.080
 it's bután mine that I stay still and 

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:11.270
 is aware of receiving diamonds and more and 

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:13.130
 more and more and the party never goes for anything 

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:15.530
 it's worth it unless you're this diamond what 

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:17.240
 you release it you do it out there 

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:19.940
 agreement but if you do not throw it out it's going to 

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:21.229
 have infinite diamonds you can always 

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:23.030
 stop your watch so that no more 

00:06:21.229 --> 00:06:25.460
 diamonds and in some way you should 

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:27.020
 infinite diamonds this you can do 

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:28.759
 with any object not only with this one 

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:30.169
 agreement you can do it with which object 

00:06:28.759 --> 00:06:32.300
 I want you to do it with diamonds 

00:06:30.169 --> 00:06:33.650
 that after all, it's what I think 

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:35.539
 you wanted me not hard diamonds 

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:37.220
 swords tools 

00:06:35.539 --> 00:06:39.500
 I do all of them are very many and I think 

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:41.960
 that we also all but you can 

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:44.180
 do it with emeralds you would also have 

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:45.860
 endless emeralds with what the 

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:48.440
 you win you would not have different dispenser 

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:50.419
 hey well I need this to come and you 

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:53.570
 they would be giving it literally as you see 

00:06:50.419 --> 00:06:55.729
 I'm in our creative and it would be f3 

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:57.560
 As you can see I am in Minecraft 1.8 of 

00:06:55.729 --> 00:06:58.940
 agreement again to repeat costs a 

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:01.009
 lots of it but when I 

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:03.190
 you get in the end is a joke this 

00:07:01.009 --> 00:07:03.190
 OK 

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.240
 I have to remove them because saying no 

00:07:06.169 --> 00:07:09.889
 I enter things do not enter me no me 

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:13.310
 enter more 

00:07:09.889 --> 00:07:15.500
 it's brutal voucher is brutal and this continues 

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:16.910
 You see he goes for at least 300 so nothing 

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:18.680
