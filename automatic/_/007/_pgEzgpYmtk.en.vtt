hardest<00:00:36.059> starting<00:00:36.510> vehicle<00:00:36.870> I<00:00:36.989> have<00:00:37.910> but<00:00:38.910> I

00:00:39.459 --> 00:00:39.469 
hardest starting vehicle I have but I

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:42.200 
hardest starting vehicle I have but I
have<00:00:40.469> confidence<00:00:40.920> in<00:00:41.219> this<00:00:41.399> car<00:00:41.700> now<00:00:41.940> because

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
have confidence in this car now because

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.540 
have confidence in this car now because
we've<00:00:42.629> been<00:00:42.719> driving<00:00:42.989> it<00:00:43.290> all<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:44.040> time<00:00:44.280> and

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550 
we've been driving it all the time and

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:48.950 
we've been driving it all the time and
why<00:00:47.550> all<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:47.820> smokers<00:00:48.270> fleet<00:00:48.570> of<00:00:48.809> vehicles

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
why all the smokers fleet of vehicles

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.540 
why all the smokers fleet of vehicles
that<00:00:50.120> yep<00:00:51.120> I<00:00:51.300> guess<00:00:51.539> but<00:00:51.949> so<00:00:52.949> you<00:00:53.010> got<00:00:53.190> frost

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
that yep I guess but so you got frost

00:00:53.550 --> 00:01:01.870 
that yep I guess but so you got frost

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:04.800 
but I've been confident in this car a

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.000 
but I've been confident in this car a
little<00:01:05.100> bit<00:01:05.220> more<00:01:05.430> enough<00:01:06.210> to<00:01:06.360> drive<00:01:06.630> it<00:01:07.010> it's

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
little bit more enough to drive it it's

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:14.390 
little bit more enough to drive it it's
not<00:01:08.190> been<00:01:08.370> started<00:01:08.880> I'll<00:01:09.210> show<00:01:09.450> you<00:01:13.190> stop<00:01:14.190> then

what<00:01:50.790> it<00:01:50.880> did<00:01:51.060> to<00:01:52.009> help<00:01:53.009> this<00:01:53.220> thing<00:01:53.460> and<00:01:53.670> the

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
what it did to help this thing and the

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.050 
what it did to help this thing and the
coal<00:01:54.000> seems<00:01:54.840> to<00:01:54.990> work<00:01:55.580> suggested<00:01:56.580> the<00:01:56.670> vials

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
coal seems to work suggested the vials

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.560 
coal seems to work suggested the vials
on<00:01:57.240> it<00:01:57.390> adjusted<00:01:58.729> all<00:01:59.729> of<00:02:00.000> them<00:02:00.150> to<00:02:00.300> 12

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
on it adjusted all of them to 12

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.510 
on it adjusted all of them to 12
thousandths<00:02:01.170> as<00:02:01.410> of<00:02:01.800> the<00:02:01.860> spec<00:02:02.160> it<00:02:02.340> supposed

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
thousandths as of the spec it supposed

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.160 
thousandths as of the spec it supposed
to<00:02:02.580> be<00:02:02.640> ten<00:02:02.850> thousands<00:02:03.330> on<00:02:03.450> intaking<00:02:03.900> and

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
to be ten thousands on intaking and

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.930 
to be ten thousands on intaking and
twelve<00:02:04.410> thousand<00:02:04.830> one<00:02:04.920> exhausts<00:02:05.490> I<00:02:05.610> just<00:02:05.789> want

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:05.940 
twelve thousand one exhausts I just want

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.090 
twelve thousand one exhausts I just want
to<00:02:06.000> have<00:02:06.090> this<00:02:06.240> one<00:02:06.420> little<00:02:06.569> loose<00:02:06.890> on<00:02:07.890> the

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:08.100 
to have this one little loose on the

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.040 
to have this one little loose on the
intakes<00:02:08.490> because<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.179> intakes<00:02:09.509> were<00:02:09.690> already

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
intakes because the intakes were already

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.770 
intakes because the intakes were already
too<00:02:10.350> tight<00:02:10.649> and<00:02:11.640> if<00:02:11.970> the<00:02:12.090> valves<00:02:12.420> not<00:02:12.630> been

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
too tight and if the valves not been

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.200 
too tight and if the valves not been
closing<00:02:13.080> tightly<00:02:13.620> for<00:02:13.800> a<00:02:13.830> while<00:02:14.010> sometimes<00:02:14.880> it

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
closing tightly for a while sometimes it

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:17.450 
closing tightly for a while sometimes it
kind<00:02:15.390> of<00:02:15.450> works<00:02:15.690> some<00:02:16.410> guns<00:02:16.650> upon<00:02:17.069> the<00:02:17.190> seats

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
kind of works some guns upon the seats

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:20.870 
kind of works some guns upon the seats
so<00:02:17.960> that<00:02:18.960> way<00:02:19.140> they'll<00:02:19.670> stand<00:02:20.670> a<00:02:20.790> better

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
so that way they'll stand a better

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.550 
so that way they'll stand a better
chance<00:02:21.000> of<00:02:22.069> closing<00:02:23.810> seems<00:02:24.810> to<00:02:24.960> have<00:02:25.170> helped

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
chance of closing seems to have helped

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.500 
chance of closing seems to have helped
it<00:02:25.890> does<00:02:26.100> run<00:02:26.400> just<00:02:26.640> a<00:02:26.760> slight<00:02:27.030> bit<00:02:27.060> rough

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
it does run just a slight bit rough

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.199 
it does run just a slight bit rough
still<00:02:27.870> but<00:02:28.410> I<00:02:28.740> don't<00:02:29.520> know<00:02:29.610> what<00:02:29.760> that<00:02:29.940> is<00:02:30.090> that

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
still but I don't know what that is that

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:35.740 
still but I don't know what that is that
could<00:02:30.480> be<00:02:30.660> an<00:02:31.020> injector<00:02:31.380> that's<00:02:33.920> acting<00:02:34.920> up

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
could be an injector that's acting up

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.080 
could be an injector that's acting up
and<00:02:37.069> third<00:02:38.069> thing<00:02:38.280> I<00:02:38.400> did<00:02:38.550> I'm<00:02:38.730> gonna<00:02:38.819> cover

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
and third thing I did I'm gonna cover

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.640 
and third thing I did I'm gonna cover

but I changed the oil and started using

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.900 
but I changed the oil and started using
this

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:05.150 

synthetic<00:03:01.230> 5w<00:03:02.230> 40<00:03:02.650> diesel<00:03:03.190> oil<00:03:03.600> for<00:03:04.600> diesels

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
synthetic 5w 40 diesel oil for diesels

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.370 
synthetic 5w 40 diesel oil for diesels
specifically<00:03:06.160> extreme<00:03:06.670> temperature<00:03:07.209> and<00:03:08.200> it

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
specifically extreme temperature and it

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.490 
specifically extreme temperature and it
ain't<00:03:08.560> cheap<00:03:08.890> for<00:03:09.580> a<00:03:09.610> 1<00:03:10.600> gallon<00:03:10.780> jug<00:03:11.260> this

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
ain't cheap for a 1 gallon jug this

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.040 
ain't cheap for a 1 gallon jug this
thing's<00:03:11.740> about<00:03:11.920> $28<00:03:12.910> but<00:03:13.330> think<00:03:13.810> about<00:03:13.900> that

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:14.050 
thing's about $28 but think about that

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:16.740 
thing's about $28 but think about that
is<00:03:14.440> not<00:03:15.430> only<00:03:15.610> does<00:03:15.820> it<00:03:15.850> help<00:03:16.060> cleaning<00:03:16.390> rings

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
is not only does it help cleaning rings
