00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:46.829

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:50.080

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:55.870
 wonderful yes we went to vicenza e 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:57.760
 finally or for only single gifts 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:59.920
 been forced 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.589
 oh well and knows how but since I don't 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:05.440

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:08.530
 made to make the gift since he 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:10.690
 stockings of the Epiphany level taken then 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.940
 a vicenza as one had told me 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:14.500
 girl who precisely follows me not me 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:17.920
 I remember the name but I thank you 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:21.360
 we have so much caprice then 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:23.470
 there were four premises for those on the cross 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.250
 so the things you will see are 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:29.800
 very few words saleswoman told me 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:39.280
 that will soon supply the real stand 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:40.959

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:45.429

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:55.009
 I took 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:57.780
 but it did not make me 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:02:03.420
 Group shows of all are not 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:05.369
 many things but then first of all me 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.890
 they gave these perfume samples 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:11.640
 including my favorite perfume of the 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:15.799

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:19.410
