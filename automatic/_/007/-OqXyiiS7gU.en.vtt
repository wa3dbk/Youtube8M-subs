00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.600 

so<00:01:38.229> the<00:01:38.290> central<00:01:38.710> console<00:01:39.100> the<00:01:39.310> P<00:01:39.430> was

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.610 
so the central console the P was

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:41.070 
so the central console the P was
actually<00:01:39.880> pretty<00:01:40.030> well<00:01:40.299> laid<00:01:40.540> out<00:01:40.570> so<00:01:40.900> all<00:01:40.990> the

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:41.080 
actually pretty well laid out so all the

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:42.930 
actually pretty well laid out so all the
buttons<00:01:41.409> are<00:01:41.530> first<00:01:41.710> squared<00:01:42.310> and<00:01:42.549> profile

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:42.940 
buttons are first squared and profile

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:44.969 
buttons are first squared and profile
and<00:01:43.119> presented<00:01:43.570> on<00:01:43.690> to<00:01:43.900> you<00:01:44.020> on<00:01:44.170> a<00:01:44.200> platter<00:01:44.440> I

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:44.979 
and presented on to you on a platter I

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:46.950 
and presented on to you on a platter I
quite<00:01:45.640> like<00:01:45.790> the<00:01:45.909> fact<00:01:46.090> that<00:01:46.240> the<00:01:46.360> boot<00:01:46.570> opener

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
quite like the fact that the boot opener

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.480 
quite like the fact that the boot opener
is<00:01:47.080> placed<00:01:47.409> here<00:01:47.770> which<00:01:48.009> means<00:01:48.190> you<00:01:48.369> actually

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490 
is placed here which means you actually

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:50.100 
is placed here which means you actually
won't<00:01:48.850> have<00:01:49.060> to<00:01:49.240> open<00:01:49.630> the<00:01:49.720> light<00:01:49.930> and

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
won't have to open the light and

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:51.810 
won't have to open the light and
struggle<00:01:50.470> between<00:01:50.650> the<00:01:50.920> openers<00:01:51.369> here<00:01:51.610> when

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:51.820 
struggle between the openers here when

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:53.580 
struggle between the openers here when
you're<00:01:51.940> at<00:01:52.030> the<00:01:52.150> fuel<00:01:52.390> pump<00:01:52.420> or<00:01:52.930> the<00:01:53.350> mall

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
you're at the fuel pump or the mall

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.580 
you're at the fuel pump or the mall
parking<00:01:53.860> for<00:01:54.310> security

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
parking for security

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.230 
parking for security
1/4<00:01:56.590> has<00:01:56.800> done<00:01:57.100> some<00:01:57.340> really<00:01:57.550> funny<00:01:57.880> things

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 
1/4 has done some really funny things

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.570 
1/4 has done some really funny things
with<00:01:58.479> the<00:01:58.600> Figo<00:01:58.960> for<00:01:59.500> example<00:01:59.920> the<00:02:00.070> cup<00:02:00.250> holder

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:00.580 
with the Figo for example the cup holder

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.940 
with the Figo for example the cup holder
here<00:02:00.790> now<00:02:00.970> where<00:02:01.180> is<00:02:01.360> the<00:02:01.509> height<00:02:01.799> frak<00:02:02.799> about

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
here now where is the height frak about

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.010 
here now where is the height frak about
this<00:02:03.280> size<00:02:03.549> this<00:02:03.850> is<00:02:04.000> definitely<00:02:04.330> not<00:02:04.720> going

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
this size this is definitely not going

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:10.139 
this size this is definitely not going
in<00:02:05.200> here<00:02:06.030> also<00:02:08.039> the<00:02:09.039> 12<00:02:09.250> volt<00:02:09.519> input<00:02:09.759> here

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
in here also the 12 volt input here

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:11.900 
in here also the 12 volt input here
actually<00:02:10.420> interferes<00:02:11.050> with<00:02:11.290> the<00:02:11.350> gear<00:02:11.560> change

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
actually interferes with the gear change

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.370 
actually interferes with the gear change
but<00:02:12.910> a<00:02:12.940> steady<00:02:13.209> amount<00:02:13.480> of<00:02:13.600> control<00:02:13.989> we<00:02:14.260> are

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
but a steady amount of control we are
