00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
flavor I think when you get another

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:47.160 
flavor I think when you get another
flavor<00:02:44.290> it<00:02:44.680> won't<00:02:45.099> be<00:02:45.280> that<00:02:45.310> sweet<00:02:46.170> that's

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
flavor it won't be that sweet that's

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
i'm so full right now and I'm asking

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.150 
i'm so full right now and I'm asking
myself<00:03:36.160> why<00:03:36.970> they<00:03:37.540> I<00:03:37.570> put<00:03:37.989> both<00:03:38.380> of<00:03:38.410> them<00:03:38.860> in

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 
myself why they I put both of them in

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.330 
myself why they I put both of them in
the<00:03:39.370> microwave<00:03:39.840> because<00:03:40.840> I'm<00:03:41.230> so<00:03:41.560> full<00:03:41.920> and

the microwave because I'm so full and
that's<00:03:42.519> I<00:03:42.819> think<00:03:42.880> that's<00:03:43.360> the<00:03:43.480> only<00:03:44.250> thing

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250

that's I think that's the only thing
about<00:03:45.519> it<00:03:45.819> that<00:03:45.850> it's<00:03:46.150> so<00:03:46.890> filling<00:03:47.890> because

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
about it that it's so filling because

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.229 
about it that it's so filling because
it's<00:03:48.819> warm<00:03:49.569> and<00:03:49.780> it's<00:03:49.930> sweet<00:03:50.530> so<00:03:51.030> after<00:03:52.030> one

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:52.239 
it's warm and it's sweet so after one
