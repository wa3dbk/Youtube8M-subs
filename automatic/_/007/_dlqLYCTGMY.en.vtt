00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:18.600
 as you know better than me there is 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:22.439
 had a disaster on the mathilde bridge 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.900
 about 40 m to replace 40 meters of the 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.880
 bridge that are not recoverable that 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.860
 start with the studies first it takes 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.900
 to redo studies to be 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:32.910
 sure of what we're doing 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.260
 make and still comply with 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.239
 standards and requirements 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.410
 once we have passed this step we 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.989
 recommend the raw material 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.059
 once we have the sheets we start to 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.010
 reconstitute by assembly the 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.830
 different elements have there the decking 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.690
 we have the objects of reinforcements in 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:50.280
 reducing transverse stiffeners 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.930
 for the main beams in va 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.910
 consoles say all these elements 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.310
 must be made in workshops 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:58.510
 in separate halls ie 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:02.230
 it's mostly parallel systems 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:04.870
 to finally restore them he has 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:07.390
 turned into a big room of 40 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:09.370
 meters in length more than 25 meters from 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.369
 wide and still 4 meters of water then 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:14.440
 it's still a considerable piece 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.510
 who is going to be completely fetching 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.750
 here in our factories near the edge of 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:22.770
 water by which we could then 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:25.780
 easily shipped by sea 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.009
 we will drop the whole life 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.960
 115 m 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:30.520
 hockey since small crown and on this 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.530
 what are we going to do the work of 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.259
 repair today we are stalled on 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:37.720
 a drop at the end of February 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:40.869
 probably on February 20th unless 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:43.660
 exceptional conditions a md at 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:46.360
 weekend course of the span to small 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:49.390
 crown and so early march beginning 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:51.430
 work on the bay did not arrive from 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.950
 element 9 in the month of April a re 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.869
 laying of the span during the month of 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.460
 June could then finish the 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:59.649
 works 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:02.800
 the goal being of always and will be 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:05.590
 held a service delivery during 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:07.899
 the summer of the mathilde bridge probably at 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:10.080
 August the case at the latest by the month 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:10.080
 August 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:16.290
 we have another project also not very far 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:19.480
 finally a lot of projects but between 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.600
 others a project nearby 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.850
 barentin 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.440
 who also in the Rouen region 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:25.680
 accumulate with tim ans with the 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.689
 east pressure 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.099
 for the mathilde bridge that everyone 

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:29.670
 obviously waiting for reasons 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:31.829
 evident 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:35.909
 actually there is some 

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:37.500
 good pressure but we are used and 

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:39.540
 is very confident to be able to satisfy 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.459
 everyone not only way 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.700
 qualitative but also point of view 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:43.700
 deadlines
