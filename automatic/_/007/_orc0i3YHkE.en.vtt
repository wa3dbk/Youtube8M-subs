Robbie and Gerald was playing white here
and<00:00:40.399> made<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:41.730> right<00:00:41.910> decision<00:00:42.450> here<00:00:42.719> and

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
and made the right decision here and

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.590 
and made the right decision here and
that<00:00:43.649> is<00:00:44.510> taking<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:46.379> routine<00:00:46.680> of<00:00:46.739> six

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:47.600 
that is taking the routine of six

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.910 
that is taking the routine of six
because<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.960> question<00:00:49.289> that<00:00:49.320> you<00:00:49.469> could<00:00:49.710> ask

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
because the question that you could ask

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.299 
because the question that you could ask
you<00:00:50.190> here<00:00:50.460> if<00:00:50.700> you're<00:00:51.570> plain<00:00:51.809> white<00:00:52.020> is<00:00:52.320> must<00:00:53.190> I

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
you here if you're plain white is must I

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.880 
you here if you're plain white is must I
take<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.730> rook<00:00:53.910> and<00:00:54.289> simplify<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.350> position

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
take the rook and simplify the position

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.869 
take the rook and simplify the position
or<00:00:56.750> can<00:00:57.750> I<00:00:57.870> better<00:00:58.530> play<00:00:58.770> rook<00:00:59.730> to<00:00:59.910> e5

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:01.879 
or can I better play rook to e5

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:07.120 
or can I better play rook to e5
attacking<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:03.000> bishop<00:01:04.250> the<00:01:05.250> thing<00:01:05.460> is<00:01:05.489> that

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130 
attacking the bishop the thing is that

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:13.000 
attacking the bishop the thing is that
after<00:01:08.540> taking<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.810> work<00:01:10.610> we<00:01:11.610> get<00:01:11.760> an<00:01:11.909> ending

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:13.010 
after taking the work we get an ending

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:18.499 
after taking the work we get an ending
in<00:01:14.010> which<00:01:14.340> black<00:01:14.790> is<00:01:15.750> only<00:01:16.640> two<00:01:17.640> points<00:01:17.850> on<00:01:18.240> the

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
in which black is only two points on the

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.200 
in which black is only two points on the
H<00:01:18.750> file<00:01:19.049> these<00:01:19.890> are<00:01:20.130> what<00:01:20.640> we<00:01:20.759> call<00:01:20.790> 'roof

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
H file these are what we call 'roof

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:27.920 
H file these are what we call 'roof
bones<00:01:21.570> and<00:01:23.479> the<00:01:24.479> color<00:01:24.780> of<00:01:25.909> the<00:01:26.909> square<00:01:27.210> where

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
bones and the color of the square where

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:33.469 
bones and the color of the square where
this<00:01:28.170> bones<00:01:29.780> could<00:01:30.780> promote<00:01:31.020> is<00:01:31.850> a<00:01:32.850> different

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
this bones could promote is a different

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.179 
this bones could promote is a different
color<00:01:33.600> than<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:35.000> color<00:01:36.000> of<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.270> squares

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:37.189 
color than the color of the squares

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:42.530 
color than the color of the squares
where<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:38.430> bishop<00:01:39.890> is<00:01:40.890> situated<00:01:41.369> so<00:01:42.360> that

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
where the bishop is situated so that

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.929 
where the bishop is situated so that
means<00:01:42.780> that<00:01:43.770> this<00:01:43.950> bishop<00:01:44.399> this<00:01:44.490> black<00:01:44.729> Bishop

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
means that this bishop this black Bishop

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.960 
means that this bishop this black Bishop
will<00:01:45.240> never<00:01:45.540> be<00:01:45.780> able<00:01:45.930> to<00:01:46.649> control<00:01:47.299> h1<00:01:48.299> and

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 
will never be able to control h1 and

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:54.410 
will never be able to control h1 and
because<00:01:50.970> of<00:01:51.000> that<00:01:51.560> the<00:01:52.560> position<00:01:52.890> is<00:01:53.250> a<00:01:54.149> draw

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
because of that the position is a draw

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.569 
because of that the position is a draw
even<00:01:54.990> if<00:01:55.310> white<00:01:56.310> loses<00:01:57.060> these<00:01:57.689> two<00:01:57.960> points<00:01:58.579> so

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
even if white loses these two points so

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.499 
even if white loses these two points so
actually<00:01:59.790> by<00:02:00.409> exchanging<00:02:01.409> the<00:02:01.560> rooks<00:02:02.329> gyro<00:02:03.329> we

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
actually by exchanging the rooks gyro we

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:09.050 
actually by exchanging the rooks gyro we
playing<00:02:03.750> white<00:02:04.790> made<00:02:05.790> it<00:02:06.000> sure<00:02:07.310> to<00:02:08.310> not<00:02:08.550> lose

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
playing white made it sure to not lose

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.869 
playing white made it sure to not lose
this<00:02:09.360> game<00:02:09.739> that<00:02:10.739> was<00:02:10.860> a<00:02:10.920> very<00:02:11.250> good<00:02:11.459> decision

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
this game that was a very good decision

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.400 
this game that was a very good decision
i<00:02:11.970> will<00:02:12.090> show<00:02:12.300> you<00:02:12.360> how<00:02:12.510> the<00:02:12.660> game<00:02:12.900> continued

i will show you how the game continued

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.780 
i will show you how the game continued
this

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
this

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.979 
this
six<00:02:14.200> Bishop<00:02:15.200> to<00:02:15.319> e5<00:02:16.060> in<00:02:17.060> the<00:02:17.269> final<00:02:17.569> attack<00:02:17.840> the

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:17.989 
six Bishop to e5 in the final attack the

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:23.130 
six Bishop to e5 in the final attack the
Bishop<00:02:19.030> Bishop<00:02:20.030> goes<00:02:20.329> to<00:02:20.510> g3<00:02:20.930> then<00:02:21.709> kingi<00:02:21.980> for

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
Bishop Bishop goes to g3 then kingi for

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:31.179 
Bishop Bishop goes to g3 then kingi for
King<00:02:24.140> be<00:02:24.909> 7f<00:02:25.909> for<00:02:26.920> now<00:02:27.920> this<00:02:28.099> is<00:02:28.250> a<00:02:29.500> an<00:02:30.500> attempt

00:02:31.179 --> 00:02:31.189 
King be 7f for now this is a an attempt

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:35.199 
King be 7f for now this is a an attempt
to<00:02:31.340> block<00:02:31.700> this<00:02:32.000> is<00:02:32.870> Bishop<00:02:34.030> from<00:02:35.030> this

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
to block this is Bishop from this

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:37.270 
to block this is Bishop from this
diagonal<00:02:35.900> so<00:02:36.140> then<00:02:36.349> even<00:02:36.950> there<00:02:37.129> is<00:02:37.250> a

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
diagonal so then even there is a

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.449 
diagonal so then even there is a
possibility<00:02:37.670> of<00:02:37.970> advance<00:02:38.269> at<00:02:38.420> this<00:02:38.569> point<00:02:39.459> but

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
possibility of advance at this point but

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:45.339 
possibility of advance at this point but
after<00:02:41.120> Bishop<00:02:41.239> of<00:02:41.510> to<00:02:42.040> d7<00:02:43.040> and<00:02:43.340> Bishop<00:02:43.819> e7<00:02:44.349> the
