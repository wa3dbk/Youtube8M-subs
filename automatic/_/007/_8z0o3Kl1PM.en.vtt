where I have to point the dish to get a
good<00:00:43.200> signal<00:00:43.500> and<00:00:44.309> on<00:00:45.030> my<00:00:45.809> preliminary<00:00:45.989> setups

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
good signal and on my preliminary setups

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.880 
good signal and on my preliminary setups
I<00:00:47.160> mark<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:48.719> position<00:00:51.260> that<00:00:52.260> everything<00:00:52.680> was

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
I mark the position that everything was

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.150 
I mark the position that everything was
in<00:00:53.070> when<00:00:53.489> it<00:00:53.579> was<00:00:53.760> set<00:00:54.059> up<00:00:54.410> so<00:00:55.410> if<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.829> antenna

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
in when it was set up so if the antenna

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.590 
in when it was set up so if the antenna
moves<00:00:56.579> while<00:00:57.390> we're<00:00:59.000> transferring<00:01:00.000> it<00:01:00.420> or

moves while we're transferring it or
setting<00:01:01.050> it<00:01:01.199> up<00:01:01.410> I<00:01:01.649> know<00:01:02.129> where<00:01:02.520> my<00:01:02.550> base

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969

compass<00:02:33.170> out<00:02:33.320> align<00:02:33.920> my<00:02:34.220> compass<00:02:34.670> with<00:02:35.420> true

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
compass out align my compass with true

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.350 
compass out align my compass with true
north<00:02:36.019> and<00:02:36.410> then<00:02:37.310> one<00:02:37.519> of<00:02:37.580> the<00:02:37.640> compasses<00:02:38.150> on

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
north and then one of the compasses on

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:43.270 
north and then one of the compasses on
True<00:02:38.630> North<00:02:38.660> I<00:02:40.269> adjust<00:02:41.269> my<00:02:41.390> board<00:02:41.959> at<00:02:42.440> the<00:02:42.560> 240

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
True North I adjust my board at the 240

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.070 
True North I adjust my board at the 240
degree<00:02:43.550> increment<00:02:44.830> wouldn't<00:02:45.830> compass<00:02:46.930> and<00:02:47.930> I

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
degree increment wouldn't compass and I

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.780 
degree increment wouldn't compass and I
pick<00:02:48.320> them<00:02:48.470> numbers<00:02:48.890> because<00:02:49.100> the<00:02:49.220> easier<00:02:49.700> to

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
pick them numbers because the easier to

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.660 
pick them numbers because the easier to
see<00:02:50.440> and<00:02:51.440> you<00:02:51.560> see<00:02:51.739> I<00:02:51.769> had<00:02:51.980> my<00:02:52.010> board<00:02:52.519> a<00:02:52.580> little

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
see and you see I had my board a little

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:53.460 
see and you see I had my board a little
bit<00:02:52.820> to<00:02:53.030> the<00:02:53.150> right

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
bit to the right

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.080 
bit to the right
you<00:02:54.470> heard<00:02:54.680> my<00:02:54.860> signal<00:02:55.280> meter<00:02:55.459> start<00:02:55.820> beeping

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
you heard my signal meter start beeping

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.320 
you heard my signal meter start beeping
faster<00:02:57.010> faster<00:02:58.010> beeps<00:02:58.400> the<00:02:58.700> stronger<00:02:59.150> your

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 
faster faster beeps the stronger your

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.600 
faster faster beeps the stronger your
signal<00:02:59.750> is<00:02:59.920> and<00:03:00.920> we<00:03:01.040> got<00:03:01.190> a<00:03:01.220> pretty<00:03:01.430> good

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
signal is and we got a pretty good

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:03.580 
signal is and we got a pretty good
signal<00:03:01.850> there<00:03:02.180> we<00:03:02.330> could<00:03:02.480> probably<00:03:02.720> watch

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
signal there we could probably watch

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.250 
signal there we could probably watch
every<00:03:03.980> channel<00:03:04.310> on<00:03:04.580> the<00:03:04.760> dish<00:03:05.030> with<00:03:05.360> signal<00:03:05.780> at

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
every channel on the dish with signal at

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.800 
every channel on the dish with signal at
that<00:03:06.470> level<00:03:07.120> but<00:03:08.120> I'm<00:03:08.239> gonna<00:03:08.420> go<00:03:08.510> out<00:03:08.600> there

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
that level but I'm gonna go out there

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.080 
that level but I'm gonna go out there
and<00:03:08.870> Plan<00:03:09.200> C<00:03:09.230> I<00:03:09.470> get<00:03:09.739> a<00:03:09.769> little<00:03:09.980> bit<00:03:10.100> higher<00:03:10.370> it

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
and Plan C I get a little bit higher it

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.150 
and Plan C I get a little bit higher it
just<00:03:11.510> means<00:03:11.720> moving<00:03:12.110> the<00:03:12.320> board<00:03:12.620> a<00:03:12.769> little<00:03:13.040> bit

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160 
just means moving the board a little bit

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.050 
just means moving the board a little bit
or<00:03:13.760> moving<00:03:14.209> it<00:03:14.950> the<00:03:15.950> position<00:03:16.130> of<00:03:16.549> the<00:03:16.640> antenna

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
or moving it the position of the antenna

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.949 
or moving it the position of the antenna
here<00:03:17.660> is<00:03:17.870> headed<00:03:18.320> movie<00:03:19.310> attempt<00:03:19.670> back<00:03:20.000> so<00:03:20.360> it

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
here is headed movie attempt back so it

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:27.550 
here is headed movie attempt back so it
points<00:03:21.230> off<00:03:21.500> higher<00:03:21.769> I'm<00:03:22.489> at<00:03:23.060> about<00:03:23.299> 95%<00:03:26.560> and

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
points off higher I'm at about 95% and

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.220 
points off higher I'm at about 95% and
there<00:03:27.769> you<00:03:27.890> go<00:03:28.100> you're<00:03:28.519> all<00:03:28.580> set<00:03:28.940> up<00:03:29.230> you're

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:47.240 
when you go to from signal meters you go

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:50.320 
when you go to from signal meters you go
to<00:03:47.300> signal<00:03:47.870> strength<00:03:48.200> my<00:03:48.740> wife<00:03:49.070> tell<00:03:49.490> me<00:03:49.640> now

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:50.330 
to signal strength my wife tell me now

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:52.780 
to signal strength my wife tell me now
gonna<00:03:50.510> let<00:03:50.720> everyone<00:03:51.110> M<00:03:51.410> Countdown<00:03:51.620> and<00:03:52.280> I<00:03:52.730> do

there and let every one of them count

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.700 
there and let every one of them count
down<00:04:00.560> for<00:04:01.400> their<00:04:01.580> you'd<00:04:01.820> go<00:04:02.030> to<00:04:02.090> exit

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:02.710 
down for their you'd go to exit
