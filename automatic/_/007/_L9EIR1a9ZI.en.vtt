00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.959 
balance lacy balance there and now I
just<00:01:54.930> need<00:01:55.229> to<00:01:55.380> select<00:01:55.619> my<00:01:55.890> charge<00:01:56.369> rate<00:01:56.670> and

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
just need to select my charge rate and

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.359 
just need to select my charge rate and
my<00:01:57.540> and<00:01:57.899> my<00:01:57.930> voltage<00:01:58.560> for<00:01:58.829> it<00:01:58.890> as<00:01:58.979> well<00:01:59.130> again

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
my and my voltage for it as well again

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.539 
my and my voltage for it as well again
all<00:01:59.670> very<00:02:00.060> very<00:02:00.329> easy<00:02:00.649> with<00:02:01.649> a<00:02:01.680> touch<00:02:02.100> of<00:02:02.369> the

to<00:02:09.710> a<00:02:09.740> nice<00:02:10.370> safe<00:02:10.640> figure<00:02:11.000> for<00:02:11.180> this<00:02:11.240> one<00:02:11.480> let's

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
to a nice safe figure for this one let's

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.440 
to a nice safe figure for this one let's
just<00:02:12.170> charge<00:02:12.380> it<00:02:12.530> at<00:02:12.650> 1c<00:02:13.190> which<00:02:13.430> will<00:02:13.670> be<00:02:13.850> one

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
just charge it at 1c which will be one

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.140 
just charge it at 1c which will be one
point<00:02:14.690> three<00:02:14.870> amps<00:02:15.290> just<00:02:15.530> get<00:02:16.010> out<00:02:16.190> there<00:02:16.580> and

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
point three amps just get out there and

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.140 
point three amps just get out there and
then<00:02:17.870> of<00:02:17.990> course<00:02:18.020> it's<00:02:18.650> a<00:02:18.740> tourist<00:02:18.980> pack<00:02:19.310> so<00:02:20.120> I

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
then of course it's a tourist pack so I

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.030 
then of course it's a tourist pack so I
take<00:02:20.360> you<00:02:20.420> now<00:02:20.510> to<00:02:20.540> 2's<00:02:20.960> again<00:02:21.620> notice<00:02:22.010> that

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
take you now to 2's again notice that

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.100 
take you now to 2's again notice that
all<00:02:22.520> I'm<00:02:22.760> doing<00:02:23.120> is<00:02:23.180> just<00:02:23.240> basically<00:02:23.720> holding
