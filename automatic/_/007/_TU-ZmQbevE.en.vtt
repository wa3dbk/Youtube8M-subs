00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
the revenue that they bring in back to

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.650 
the revenue that they bring in back to
the<00:02:36.200> state<00:02:36.500> prison<00:02:36.770> system<00:02:37.330> and<00:02:38.330> the<00:02:38.480> average

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
the state prison system and the average

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.600 
the state prison system and the average
kick<00:02:39.200> back<00:02:39.380> across<00:02:39.740> the<00:02:39.950> nation<00:02:40.280> is<00:02:40.400> about

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
kick back across the nation is about

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
kick back across the nation is about
forty<00:02:41.090> percent<00:02:41.440> Wow<00:02:42.580> so<00:02:43.580> we<00:02:44.120> see<00:02:44.360> that<00:02:44.510> there

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
forty percent Wow so we see that there

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:46.630 
forty percent Wow so we see that there
is<00:02:44.690> an<00:02:44.960> incentive<00:02:45.530> there<00:02:45.740> to<00:02:45.980> be<00:02:46.100> charging<00:02:46.520> the

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
is an incentive there to be charging the

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.060 
is an incentive there to be charging the
higher<00:02:46.820> rate<00:02:47.180> so<00:02:47.630> it<00:02:48.380> looks<00:02:48.650> like<00:02:48.740> state

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070 
higher rate so it looks like state

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.040 
higher rate so it looks like state
prison<00:02:49.520> systems<00:02:49.910> have<00:02:50.150> no<00:02:50.390> incentive<00:02:50.810> to

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050 
prison systems have no incentive to

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:53.740 
prison systems have no incentive to
offer<00:02:51.320> the<00:02:51.650> lowest<00:02:51.800> rate<00:02:52.160> at<00:02:52.280> all<00:02:52.540> yeah<00:02:53.540> it's

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
offer the lowest rate at all yeah it's

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.390 
offer the lowest rate at all yeah it's
actually<00:02:54.080> the<00:02:54.200> exact<00:02:54.470> opposite<00:02:54.980> of<00:02:55.100> what<00:02:55.160> you

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
actually the exact opposite of what you

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.130 
actually the exact opposite of what you
would<00:02:55.490> expect<00:02:55.910> and<00:02:56.180> sort<00:02:56.570> of<00:02:56.630> an<00:02:56.750> ordinary

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
would expect and sort of an ordinary

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.770 
would expect and sort of an ordinary
well<00:02:57.560> functioning<00:02:57.830> market<00:02:58.280> where<00:02:58.790> you<00:02:59.690> know

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
well functioning market where you know

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.540 
well functioning market where you know
the<00:02:59.930> state<00:03:00.200> would<00:03:00.380> select<00:03:00.800> the<00:03:01.010> lowest<00:03:01.370> bidder

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:01.550 
the state would select the lowest bidder

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:03.610 
the state would select the lowest bidder
here<00:03:02.030> the<00:03:02.180> state<00:03:02.420> has<00:03:02.630> the<00:03:02.840> exact<00:03:03.140> opposite

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
here the state has the exact opposite

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.100 
here the state has the exact opposite
incentive<00:03:04.160> which<00:03:04.340> is<00:03:04.490> to<00:03:04.670> select<00:03:04.850> the<00:03:05.600> company

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
incentive which is to select the company

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:07.630 
incentive which is to select the company
that<00:03:06.350> promises<00:03:06.980> to<00:03:07.010> pay<00:03:07.310> the<00:03:07.460> highest

that promises to pay the highest
commission<00:03:08.270> which<00:03:08.690> they<00:03:09.170> then<00:03:09.440> pass<00:03:09.770> off<00:03:10.040> to

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
commission which they then pass off to

how<00:04:02.060> does<00:04:02.450> family<00:04:02.810> contact<00:04:03.739> help<00:04:04.489> prisoners

how does family contact help prisoners

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:08.699 
how does family contact help prisoners
and<00:04:05.360> in<00:04:05.570> terms<00:04:05.840> of<00:04:05.989> the<00:04:06.170> recidivism<00:04:06.860> rate<00:04:07.330> and

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:08.709 
and in terms of the recidivism rate and

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:10.960 
and in terms of the recidivism rate and
and<00:04:09.709> you<00:04:09.860> know<00:04:09.980> having<00:04:10.190> that<00:04:10.430> contact<00:04:10.850> with

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:10.970 
and you know having that contact with

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:12.850 
and you know having that contact with
family<00:04:11.330> members<00:04:11.480> of<00:04:11.870> course<00:04:12.320> I<00:04:12.530> think<00:04:12.590> it's

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:12.860 
family members of course I think it's

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:15.340 
family members of course I think it's
millions<00:04:13.550> of<00:04:13.670> children<00:04:14.120> do<00:04:14.600> have<00:04:14.959> at<00:04:15.230> least

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:17.989 
one parent that is in jail so what are

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:20.740 
one parent that is in jail so what are
the<00:04:18.080> greater<00:04:18.290> implications<00:04:18.950> of<00:04:19.070> this<00:04:19.480> yeah<00:04:20.480> as

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:20.750 
the greater implications of this yeah as

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:22.810 
the greater implications of this yeah as
you<00:04:20.900> point<00:04:21.140> out<00:04:21.260> there's<00:04:21.530> approximately<00:04:21.919> 2.7

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820 
you point out there's approximately 2.7
