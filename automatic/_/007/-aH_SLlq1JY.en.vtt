00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
really really good i I don't think the

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.699 
really really good i I don't think the
bottom<00:02:27.120> is<00:02:27.239> quite<00:02:27.420> good<00:02:27.569> enough<00:02:28.049> as<00:02:28.560> it<00:02:28.680> was

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709
