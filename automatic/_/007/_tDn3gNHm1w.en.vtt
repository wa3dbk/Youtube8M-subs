00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:08.190 
hi I want to show you my gear shifter

00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:11.629 
hi I want to show you my gear shifter
that<00:00:08.580> I<00:00:08.610> made<00:00:09.270> myself<00:00:09.900> for<00:00:10.559> driving<00:00:11.010> in<00:00:11.190> Euro

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639

Truck<00:00:11.910> Simulator<00:00:12.150> 2<00:00:12.509> I<00:00:13.759> wanted<00:00:14.759> a<00:00:14.849> gear

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
Truck Simulator 2 I wanted a gear

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.390 
Truck Simulator 2 I wanted a gear
shifter<00:00:15.360> for<00:00:15.540> some<00:00:15.780> time<00:00:16.080> and<00:00:16.410> one<00:00:17.160> day<00:00:17.369> I

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
shifter for some time and one day I

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.940 
shifter for some time and one day I
stumbled<00:00:17.790> upon<00:00:18.090> a<00:00:18.270> video<00:00:18.660> made<00:00:19.200> that<00:00:19.410> by<00:00:19.590> a<00:00:19.619> guy

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:19.950 
stumbled upon a video made that by a guy

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:22.850 
stumbled upon a video made that by a guy
who<00:00:20.009> built<00:00:20.700> a<00:00:20.880> gear<00:00:21.239> shift<00:00:21.270> for<00:00:21.750> himself<00:00:22.140> so<00:00:22.380> I

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:22.860 
who built a gear shift for himself so I

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:24.920 
who built a gear shift for himself so I
watched<00:00:23.130> a<00:00:23.279> video<00:00:23.399> thought<00:00:24.239> about<00:00:24.509> it<00:00:24.720> and

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
watched a video thought about it and

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.589 
watched a video thought about it and
decided<00:00:24.989> I<00:00:25.529> will<00:00:25.590> I'll<00:00:26.220> try<00:00:26.520> to<00:00:26.579> build<00:00:26.849> one<00:00:27.149> for

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
decided I will I'll try to build one for

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.299 
decided I will I'll try to build one for
myself<00:00:27.750> and<00:00:28.460> this<00:00:29.460> is<00:00:29.610> what<00:00:29.759> I<00:00:29.790> came<00:00:29.939> up<00:00:30.180> with

00:00:31.299 --> 00:00:31.309 
myself and this is what I came up with

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:36.130 
myself and this is what I came up with
here<00:00:32.309> I<00:00:32.340> move<00:00:32.730> the<00:00:33.149> lever<00:00:34.110> through<00:00:34.830> the<00:00:34.980> gears

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:36.140 
here I move the lever through the gears

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.590 
here I move the lever through the gears
it<00:00:37.140> has<00:00:37.530> eight<00:00:37.890> gears<00:00:38.220> while<00:00:38.850> actually<00:00:39.240> seven

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
it has eight gears while actually seven

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:50.030 
it has eight gears while actually seven
years<00:00:39.900> plus<00:00:40.380> a<00:00:40.710> reverse<00:00:41.190> gear<00:00:48.770> here<00:00:49.770> you<00:00:49.890> can

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:50.040 
years plus a reverse gear here you can

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.240 
years plus a reverse gear here you can
see<00:00:50.280> how<00:00:50.970> high<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.390> gear<00:00:52.140> shifter<00:00:52.440> is<00:00:52.530> it's

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
see how high the gear shifter is it's

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.390 
see how high the gear shifter is it's
little<00:00:53.670> above<00:00:54.300> my<00:00:54.360> knee<00:00:54.630> and<00:00:55.020> I'm<00:00:55.680> about<00:00:56.040> one

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:56.400 
little above my knee and I'm about one

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.229 
little above my knee and I'm about one
meter<00:00:56.579> 90<00:00:58.100> so<00:00:59.100> you<00:00:59.160> have<00:00:59.489> a<00:00:59.520> little<00:01:00.000> bit<00:01:00.180> of

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
meter 90 so you have a little bit of

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.950 
meter 90 so you have a little bit of
perspective

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:04.960 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.469 

here<00:01:05.530> I<00:01:05.560> move<00:01:05.890> the<00:01:06.190> lever<00:01:06.700> through<00:01:07.090> the<00:01:07.180> gears

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:07.479 
here I move the lever through the gears

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:09.420 
here I move the lever through the gears
from<00:01:07.570> another<00:01:08.080> perspective<00:01:08.409> so<00:01:09.070> you<00:01:09.100> have

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:09.430 
from another perspective so you have

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:14.580 
from another perspective so you have
another<00:01:09.790> shot<00:01:10.119> of<00:01:10.150> it<00:01:10.420> I<00:01:12.780> built<00:01:13.780> for<00:01:14.080> myself

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.590 
another shot of it I built for myself

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.740 
another shot of it I built for myself
and<00:01:14.890> my<00:01:15.010> wife<00:01:15.220> helped<00:01:15.700> me<00:01:15.880> with<00:01:16.119> the<00:01:16.390> leather

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:16.750 
and my wife helped me with the leather

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:19.380 
and my wife helped me with the leather
part<00:01:17.170> the<00:01:17.920> leather<00:01:18.250> cover<00:01:18.610> and<00:01:18.970> as<00:01:19.119> you<00:01:19.270> can

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.390 
part the leather cover and as you can

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:29.550 
part the leather cover and as you can
see<00:01:19.450> here

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.640 

and<00:01:30.180> probably<00:01:31.180> now<00:01:31.390> well<00:01:31.690> I<00:01:31.930> must<00:01:32.380> show<00:01:32.590> you

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:32.650 
and probably now well I must show you

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:37.670 
and probably now well I must show you
the<00:01:32.860> of<00:01:33.670> the<00:01:34.060> bottom<00:01:34.360> part<00:01:34.540> the<00:01:35.320> inside<00:01:35.710> of<00:01:35.860> it

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
the of the bottom part the inside of it

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.620 
the of the bottom part the inside of it
well<00:01:38.610> I<00:01:38.640> used<00:01:38.880> some<00:01:39.240> metal<00:01:39.960> fittings<00:01:40.380> and<00:01:41.630> wood

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
well I used some metal fittings and wood

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.320 
well I used some metal fittings and wood
blocks<00:01:42.990> to<00:01:43.530> build<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:43.890> core<00:01:44.820> of<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.120> gear

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:45.330 
blocks to build the core of the gear

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.030 
blocks to build the core of the gear
shifter<00:01:45.690> that<00:01:45.720> holds<00:01:46.230> the<00:01:46.350> lever<00:01:46.560> as<00:01:46.800> well

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
shifter that holds the lever as well

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.510 
shifter that holds the lever as well
there<00:01:47.640> are<00:01:47.760> some<00:01:47.970> Springs<00:01:48.420> for<00:01:48.750> resistance

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
there are some Springs for resistance

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.040 
there are some Springs for resistance
and<00:01:50.520> actually<00:01:50.940> I<00:01:50.970> have<00:01:51.180> added<00:01:51.600> there's<00:01:51.840> some

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:52.050 
and actually I have added there's some

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:54.380 
and actually I have added there's some
more<00:01:52.260> Springs<00:01:52.680> on<00:01:53.070> the<00:01:53.340> other<00:01:53.460> side<00:01:53.850> to

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
more Springs on the other side to

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.390 
more Springs on the other side to
increase<00:01:54.660> the<00:01:54.780> centering<00:01:55.170> force<00:01:55.200> I<00:01:55.680> used<00:01:56.070> some

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:56.400 
increase the centering force I used some

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.880 
increase the centering force I used some
micro<00:01:56.760> switches<00:01:57.090> to<00:01:57.630> initiate<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.320> gears<00:01:58.650> and

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
micro switches to initiate the gears and

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.750 
micro switches to initiate the gears and
in<00:01:59.820> the<00:02:00.030> back<00:02:00.260> there's<00:02:01.260> a<00:02:01.470> USB<00:02:02.160> interface

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:02.760 
in the back there's a USB interface

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.780 
in the back there's a USB interface
board<00:02:03.350> that<00:02:04.350> I<00:02:04.380> use<00:02:04.680> to<00:02:05.040> connect<00:02:05.370> it<00:02:05.490> all<00:02:05.610> to
