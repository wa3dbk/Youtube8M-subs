because<00:02:06.920> it<00:02:07.160> kind<00:02:07.340> of<00:02:07.399> gives<00:02:07.610> away<00:02:07.759> the

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
because it kind of gives away the

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.760 
because it kind of gives away the
punchline<00:02:08.300> if<00:02:08.629> you're<00:02:08.780> all<00:02:08.929> for<00:02:09.080> the<00:02:09.170> album<00:02:09.470> so

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:11.989 
sometimes we might slip in a little bit
