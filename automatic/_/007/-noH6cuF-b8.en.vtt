now<00:02:13.480> let's<00:02:14.480> get<00:02:14.660> onto<00:02:14.810> the<00:02:14.960> main<00:02:15.050> reason<00:02:15.620> the

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
now let's get onto the main reason the

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:21.040 
now let's get onto the main reason the
bottom<00:02:16.670> of<00:02:16.790> the<00:02:16.850> box<00:02:17.080> lets<00:02:18.080> Joe<00:02:19.660> the<00:02:20.660> goggle

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
bottom of the box lets Joe the goggle

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.880 
bottom of the box lets Joe the goggle
system<00:02:21.410> itself

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
system itself

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.040 
system itself
now<00:02:22.640> if<00:02:22.910> the<00:02:23.090> camera<00:02:23.420> is<00:02:23.450> picking<00:02:23.630> this<00:02:23.870> up

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
now if the camera is picking this up

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.199 
now if the camera is picking this up
right<00:02:24.290> you<00:02:24.770> should<00:02:25.040> not<00:02:25.250> be<00:02:25.400> able<00:02:25.580> to<00:02:25.700> see<00:02:25.970> my

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:26.209 
right you should not be able to see my

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:29.830 
right you should not be able to see my
hand<00:02:26.510> back<00:02:26.840> here<00:02:27.170> okay<00:02:27.800> so<00:02:27.830> it's<00:02:28.570> can't<00:02:29.570> see<00:02:29.750> it

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
hand back here okay so it's can't see it

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.750 
hand back here okay so it's can't see it
because<00:02:29.990> it's<00:02:30.410> reflecting<00:02:30.980> everything<00:02:31.160> off

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
because it's reflecting everything off

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.230 
because it's reflecting everything off
which<00:02:32.030> is<00:02:32.530> so<00:02:33.530> cool<00:02:33.890> in<00:02:34.160> my<00:02:34.370> opinion<00:02:34.790> it's

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:35.240 
which is so cool in my opinion it's

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:36.940 
which is so cool in my opinion it's
basically<00:02:35.720> intimidation<00:02:36.410> so<00:02:36.709> when<00:02:36.830> you're

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
basically intimidation so when you're

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.500 
basically intimidation so when you're
out<00:02:37.010> there<00:02:37.160> on<00:02:37.220> the<00:02:37.310> field<00:02:37.580> and<00:02:37.850> someone<00:02:38.270> sees

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
out there on the field and someone sees

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:39.820 
out there on the field and someone sees
you<00:02:38.600> pop<00:02:38.810> from<00:02:38.959> behind<00:02:39.230> a<00:02:39.350> bunker<00:02:39.500> and<00:02:39.650> all

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
you pop from behind a bunker and all

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.130 
you pop from behind a bunker and all
they<00:02:39.980> see<00:02:40.010> is<00:02:40.190> this<00:02:40.340> gold<00:02:40.970> flash<00:02:41.390> lens<00:02:41.870> they're

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
they see is this gold flash lens they're

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.300 
they see is this gold flash lens they're
going<00:02:42.260> to<00:02:42.320> be<00:02:42.410> like<00:02:42.700> why<00:02:43.700> me<00:02:44.920> so<00:02:45.920> as<00:02:46.070> you<00:02:46.190> can

see everything is in gold and black from

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.940 
see everything is in gold and black from
even<00:02:48.770> the<00:02:48.920> strap<00:02:49.280> itself<00:02:50.060> to<00:02:51.050> this<00:02:51.170> tiny<00:02:51.500> dye

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
even the strap itself to this tiny dye

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.690 
even the strap itself to this tiny dye
ball<00:02:52.550> right<00:02:52.790> here<00:02:53.950> so<00:02:54.950> here<00:02:55.130> and<00:02:55.340> this<00:02:55.430> is<00:02:55.610> the

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
ball right here so here and this is the

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:56.680 
ball right here so here and this is the
mount<00:02:55.910> this<00:02:56.060> is<00:02:56.239> where<00:02:56.390> you're<00:02:56.510> going<00:02:56.600> to

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
mount this is where you're going to

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:58.930 
mount this is where you're going to
breathe<00:02:56.870> out<00:02:56.989> of<00:02:57.170> it's<00:02:58.100> perfect<00:02:58.550> it's<00:02:58.700> a<00:02:58.790> lot

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
breathe out of it's perfect it's a lot

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.000 
breathe out of it's perfect it's a lot
easier<00:02:59.270> to<00:02:59.390> talk<00:02:59.540> out<00:02:59.750> of<00:02:59.840> than<00:02:59.959> the<00:02:59.989> i3s<00:03:00.680> in<00:03:00.860> my

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
easier to talk out of than the i3s in my

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:02.110 
easier to talk out of than the i3s in my
opinion<00:03:01.310> because<00:03:01.430> it<00:03:01.520> just<00:03:01.670> goes<00:03:01.880> right<00:03:02.060> out

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
opinion because it just goes right out

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.140 
opinion because it just goes right out
air<00:03:02.540> comes<00:03:02.780> right<00:03:03.050> in<00:03:03.640> breathing<00:03:04.640> here<00:03:05.000> as

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
air comes right in breathing here as

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.110 
air comes right in breathing here as
well<00:03:05.330> on<00:03:05.540> the<00:03:05.840> side<00:03:06.049> here<00:03:07.040> I'll<00:03:07.760> just<00:03:07.820> show<00:03:08.090> you

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
well on the side here I'll just show you

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.120 
well on the side here I'll just show you
what<00:03:08.299> it<00:03:08.390> looks<00:03:08.540> like<00:03:08.690> when<00:03:08.870> you<00:03:08.930> have<00:03:09.110> it<00:03:09.230> on

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.130 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:15.610 

so<00:03:13.130> this<00:03:13.280> is<00:03:13.459> what<00:03:13.610> it<00:03:13.700> looks<00:03:13.880> like<00:03:14.440> you<00:03:15.440> can

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
so this is what it looks like you can

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.130 
so this is what it looks like you can
see<00:03:15.799> you<00:03:15.890> can't<00:03:16.160> really<00:03:16.370> see<00:03:16.610> through<00:03:17.140> you

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
see you can't really see through you

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.860 
see you can't really see through you
know<00:03:18.230> my<00:03:18.410> chin<00:03:18.709> is<00:03:18.980> shown<00:03:19.910> a<00:03:19.940> little<00:03:20.299> bit<00:03:20.510> here

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
know my chin is shown a little bit here

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:22.390 
know my chin is shown a little bit here
but<00:03:21.170> you<00:03:21.260> can't<00:03:21.470> really<00:03:21.620> see<00:03:21.890> it<00:03:21.980> coming<00:03:22.280> out

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
but you can't really see it coming out

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.320 
but you can't really see it coming out
from<00:03:22.640> underneath<00:03:23.709> it's<00:03:24.709> here<00:03:25.060> so<00:03:26.060> that's<00:03:26.209> the

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:26.330 
from underneath it's here so that's the

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.990 
from underneath it's here so that's the
only<00:03:26.450> like<00:03:26.690> disadvantage<00:03:27.530> I<00:03:27.680> guess<00:03:27.860> and<00:03:28.850> the

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
only like disadvantage I guess and the

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.580 
only like disadvantage I guess and the
little<00:03:29.239> straps<00:03:29.510> right<00:03:29.720> here<00:03:29.810> from<00:03:30.350> the<00:03:30.440> back

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
little straps right here from the back

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:35.020 
little straps right here from the back
which<00:03:30.860> is<00:03:31.010> perfect<00:03:32.920> the<00:03:33.920> only<00:03:34.100> disadvantage<00:03:34.640> I

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
which is perfect the only disadvantage I

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:36.490 
which is perfect the only disadvantage I
guess<00:03:35.209> of<00:03:35.330> this<00:03:35.480> mask<00:03:35.750> is<00:03:35.989> it<00:03:36.140> doesn't<00:03:36.350> really

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
guess of this mask is it doesn't really

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.410 
guess of this mask is it doesn't really
fully<00:03:36.860> cover<00:03:37.190> your<00:03:37.430> face<00:03:37.640> so<00:03:37.880> if<00:03:37.970> you<00:03:38.060> get<00:03:38.239> like

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:38.420 
fully cover your face so if you get like

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.690 
fully cover your face so if you get like
kick<00:03:38.720> here<00:03:39.110> you<00:03:39.860> know<00:03:40.010> you<00:03:40.340> got<00:03:40.489> really

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
kick here you know you got really

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:42.070 
kick here you know you got really
nothing<00:03:41.030> to<00:03:41.090> protect<00:03:41.269> it<00:03:41.570> but<00:03:41.690> you<00:03:41.810> know<00:03:41.959> the

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:42.080 
nothing to protect it but you know the

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.570 
nothing to protect it but you know the
odds<00:03:42.110> of<00:03:42.470> somebody<00:03:42.650> doing<00:03:43.040> that<00:03:43.160> with<00:03:43.400> this

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:43.580 
odds of somebody doing that with this

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:44.740 
odds of somebody doing that with this
thing<00:03:43.820> covering<00:03:44.209> your<00:03:44.330> whole<00:03:44.480> head<00:03:44.720> and

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
thing covering your whole head and

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:48.039 
thing covering your whole head and
you're<00:03:45.500> behind<00:03:45.680> a<00:03:45.830> bunker<00:03:45.980> are<00:03:46.250> kind<00:03:46.489> of<00:03:47.049> lower

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:48.049 
you're behind a bunker are kind of lower

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:50.710 
you're behind a bunker are kind of lower
than<00:03:48.380> what<00:03:48.830> they<00:03:48.950> would<00:03:49.070> be<00:03:49.130> if<00:03:49.549> you<00:03:49.820> had<00:03:50.360> you

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
than what they would be if you had you

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.050 
than what they would be if you had you
know<00:03:50.870> they'd<00:03:51.350> just<00:03:51.380> be<00:03:51.680> lower<00:03:51.860> so<00:03:52.160> that's<00:03:52.820> the

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.060 
know they'd just be lower so that's the

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.350 
know they'd just be lower so that's the
mask<00:03:53.269> and<00:03:53.510> how<00:03:53.600> it<00:03:53.720> looks<00:03:53.930> I<00:03:55.090> can't<00:03:56.090> wait<00:03:56.239> to

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:56.360 
mask and how it looks I can't wait to

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:57.880 
mask and how it looks I can't wait to
take<00:03:56.540> this<00:03:56.720> thing<00:03:56.930> out<00:03:57.110> on<00:03:57.140> the<00:03:57.350> field<00:03:57.590> if<00:03:57.769> you

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:57.890 
take this thing out on the field if you

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:00.250 
take this thing out on the field if you
have<00:03:58.120> $134<00:03:59.120> to<00:03:59.239> spend<00:03:59.480> an<00:03:59.660> hour<00:03:59.750> looking<00:04:00.019> for<00:04:00.230> a

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:00.260 
have $134 to spend an hour looking for a

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.069
