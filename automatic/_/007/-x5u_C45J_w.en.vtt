00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:40.250 
heavy injuries it's a four cylinder with

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.689 
heavy injuries it's a four cylinder with
sixteen<00:00:40.699> hundred<00:00:41.059> cubic<00:00:41.589> centimeter<00:00:42.699> know

sixteen hundred cubic centimeter know

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:46.630 
sixteen hundred cubic centimeter know
how<00:00:43.850> do<00:00:43.909> you<00:00:44.030> say<00:00:44.239> cubic<00:00:45.159> square<00:00:46.159> centimeter

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:46.640 
how do you say cubic square centimeter

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:52.000 
how do you say cubic square centimeter
right<00:00:46.909> and<00:00:48.430> approximately<00:00:49.430> around<00:00:51.010> 170

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.010 
right and approximately around 170

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:57.719 
right and approximately around 170
horsepower<00:00:53.320> so<00:00:54.320> it<00:00:55.000> doesn't<00:00:56.000> sound<00:00:56.210> a<00:00:56.479> lot<00:00:56.720> but

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:57.729 
horsepower so it doesn't sound a lot but

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:59.979 
horsepower so it doesn't sound a lot but
compared<00:00:58.729> to<00:00:58.790> the<00:00:59.030> weight<00:00:59.210> of<00:00:59.239> the<00:00:59.600> car<00:00:59.839> and

00:00:59.979 --> 00:00:59.989 
compared to the weight of the car and

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:03.460 
compared to the weight of the car and
knowledge<00:01:00.320> gets<00:01:00.589> interesting<00:01:01.690> because<00:01:02.690> TZ

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:03.470 
knowledge gets interesting because TZ

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:07.750 
knowledge gets interesting because TZ

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 
means that the frame is made of various

means that the frame is made of various
in<00:01:10.040> tubes<00:01:10.760> so<00:01:11.630> she<00:01:11.689> cars<00:01:11.990> very<00:01:12.200> light<00:01:12.670> round

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 
in tubes so she cars very light round

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.860 
in tubes so she cars very light round
about<00:01:13.850> seven<00:01:14.420> hundred<00:01:14.450> fifty<00:01:14.870> kilos<00:01:15.410> and<00:01:16.870> that

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:17.870 
about seven hundred fifty kilos and that

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:20.520 
about seven hundred fifty kilos and that
works<00:01:18.140> pretty<00:01:18.410> fine<00:01:18.800> was<00:01:19.070> was<00:01:19.370> was<00:01:19.760> a<00:01:20.000> little

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:20.530 
works pretty fine was was was a little

works pretty fine was was was a little
four-cylinder<00:01:21.530> engine<00:01:22.930> hasn't<00:01:23.930> so<00:01:24.350> much<00:01:24.530> talk

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:25.300 
four-cylinder engine hasn't so much talk

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:31.240 
four-cylinder engine hasn't so much talk
but<00:01:26.890> if<00:01:27.890> you<00:01:28.130> have<00:01:28.250> enough<00:01:29.530> rotations<00:01:30.530> then<00:01:31.130> it

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
but if you have enough rotations then it

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.020 
but if you have enough rotations then it
goes<00:01:31.460> pretty<00:01:32.210> well<00:01:32.390> I<00:01:32.920> know<00:01:33.920> it's<00:01:34.220> a<00:01:34.370> winner<00:01:34.760> of

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
goes pretty well I know it's a winner of

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:40.810 
goes pretty well I know it's a winner of
the<00:01:35.210> targa<00:01:35.570> florio<00:01:36.700> I<00:01:38.110> think<00:01:39.110> it's<00:01:39.310> 78<00:01:40.310> but<00:01:40.670> i'm

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:40.820 
the targa florio I think it's 78 but i'm

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.310 
the targa florio I think it's 78 but i'm
not<00:01:40.970> sure<00:01:41.030> and<00:01:42.400> but<00:01:43.400> it<00:01:43.520> has<00:01:43.700> done<00:01:43.909> so<00:01:44.180> many

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320 
not sure and but it has done so many

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.120 
not sure and but it has done so many
races<00:01:45.320> and<00:01:46.060> through<00:01:47.060> different<00:01:47.480> owners<00:01:47.840> I

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
races and through different owners I

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.730 
races and through different owners I
don't<00:01:49.130> know<00:01:49.220> it's<00:01:49.370> the<00:01:49.490> autodata<00:01:49.909> car<00:01:50.560> this<00:01:51.560> is

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
don't know it's the autodata car this is

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.290 
don't know it's the autodata car this is
a<00:01:51.850> pretty<00:01:52.850> sure<00:01:53.150> and<00:01:54.340> that<00:01:55.340> shows<00:01:55.610> that<00:01:55.820> it's<00:01:56.090> a

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:56.300 
a pretty sure and that shows that it's a

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.500 
a pretty sure and that shows that it's a
race<00:01:56.930> car<00:01:57.200> pure<00:01:57.830> these<00:01:58.430> cars<00:01:58.729> have<00:01:58.880> been<00:01:59.240> built

00:01:59.500 --> 00:01:59.510 
race car pure these cars have been built

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:03.100 
race car pure these cars have been built
I<00:01:59.780> think<00:02:00.620> around<00:02:00.979> a<00:02:01.220> hundred<00:02:01.340> times<00:02:01.850> and<00:02:02.330> most

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 
I think around a hundred times and most

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.740 
I think around a hundred times and most
of<00:02:03.350> them<00:02:03.530> have<00:02:03.590> been<00:02:03.920> produced<00:02:04.820> and<00:02:05.300> sent<00:02:05.510> out

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
of them have been produced and sent out

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.680 
of them have been produced and sent out
as<00:02:06.350> a<00:02:06.409> race<00:02:06.680> car<00:02:07.209> just<00:02:08.209> a<00:02:08.360> few<00:02:08.569> of<00:02:08.599> them<00:02:08.899> were

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
as a race car just a few of them were

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.440 
as a race car just a few of them were
street<00:02:11.690> cars<00:02:12.250> most<00:02:13.250> of<00:02:13.430> them<00:02:13.610> definitely

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
street cars most of them definitely

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.140 
street cars most of them definitely
raise<00:02:14.989> cause<00:02:15.260> we're<00:02:15.980> best<00:02:16.400> experience

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 
driving up in the mountainous can be a

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.380 
driving up in the mountainous can be a
lot<00:02:20.000> of<00:02:20.030> fun<00:02:20.500> if<00:02:21.500> if<00:02:22.250> you<00:02:22.430> can<00:02:22.459> have<00:02:22.970> if<00:02:23.209> you<00:02:23.360> can

hold speed

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.920 
hold speed
he<00:02:25.190> it's<00:02:25.370> difficult<00:02:26.150> because<00:02:26.360> you<00:02:26.660> don't<00:02:26.840> have

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
he it's difficult because you don't have

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.140 
he it's difficult because you don't have
enough<00:02:27.230> talk<00:02:27.500> so<00:02:27.830> you<00:02:28.430> have<00:02:28.550> to<00:02:28.700> play<00:02:28.910> with

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
enough talk so you have to play with

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:35.680 
enough talk so you have to play with
that<00:02:32.470> race<00:02:33.470> tracks<00:02:33.890> are<00:02:34.190> very<00:02:34.220> funny<00:02:34.820> I<00:02:35.180> mean

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
that race tracks are very funny I mean

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.600 
that race tracks are very funny I mean
this<00:02:35.810> is<00:02:35.990> definitely<00:02:36.260> the<00:02:36.980> best<00:02:37.130> you<00:02:37.280> can<00:02:37.430> do

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
this is definitely the best you can do

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.500 
this is definitely the best you can do
with<00:02:37.880> this<00:02:38.030> car<00:02:38.710> because<00:02:39.710> you<00:02:40.580> can<00:02:40.820> be<00:02:41.209> very

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.070 
with this car because you can be very
fast<00:02:41.870> and<00:02:42.310> it's<00:02:43.310> a<00:02:43.370> very<00:02:43.400> handy<00:02:43.820> book<00:02:43.970> are<00:02:44.150> all

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
fast and it's a very handy book are all

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.290 
fast and it's a very handy book are all
the<00:02:45.380> time<00:02:45.620> you<00:02:45.860> have<00:02:45.980> to<00:02:46.010> figure<00:02:46.820> out<00:02:46.970> what<00:02:47.209> you

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
the time you have to figure out what you

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.680 
the time you have to figure out what you
can<00:02:47.480> do<00:02:47.600> better<00:02:48.160> the<00:02:49.160> last<00:02:49.370> thing<00:02:49.700> we<00:02:49.760> did<00:02:50.120> was

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
can do better the last thing we did was

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:53.370 
can do better the last thing we did was
a<00:02:50.750> gearbox<00:02:51.230> and<00:02:51.890> end<00:02:52.250> the<00:02:52.400> engine<00:02:52.700> itself

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
a gearbox and end the engine itself

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:56.470 
a gearbox and end the engine itself
which<00:02:54.380> is<00:02:54.500> very<00:02:54.709> difficult<00:02:54.950> and<00:02:55.340> the<00:02:56.240> best

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
which is very difficult and the best
