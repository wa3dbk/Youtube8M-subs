00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.629

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.660
 shots we hope you all go 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.899
 very very well I'm really great 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.070
 well 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.940
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.949
 new video and that's really 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.480
 great pleasure of the sun that finally arrives 

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:50.550
 and what does it feel good 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.540
 frankly especially in belgium since 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.820
 I announce you that I live in belgium 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.960
 in Brussels more or less and so the 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.399
 sun is not there often and so 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.290
 see the sun I have the potato I have the 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.920
 shape and that it's nice we do not 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:00.360
 not much 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.620
 we always say opposite but everything 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.970
 just a little I like this video 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.320
 you go down you put the little one 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:04.710
 green thumb it's really great 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.570
 pleasure 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.830
 it's free it's cheap and that's it 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.479
 I prefer as shepard would say 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.649
 today are going to end up for a 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.670
 announcement begins and where it fired 

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:13.259
 that you have to tell you but what the 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.640
 fuck tirano but what we 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:16.619
 tells call of duty with dinosaurs 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.780
 what is this mess then let us 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.369
 you introduce the trick and small 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.410
 last parenthesis simply 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.009
 as I dedicate one it's been six years not 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:24.960
 my return 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.340
 like Thursday on social networks that 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.229
 made a lease that I did more video 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.610
 I was rather active we start again 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.710
 directly be active right now 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.210
 one to two videos a week I tell you 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.520
 promise it's going to be really achievable 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.110
 and I will put myself to the bottom for this pure 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.950
 blood this project to make a video 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.060
 regularly 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.170
 I hope in any case that you do 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.520
 pay so you do not hesitate to put 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.630
 a james is gone we start 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.000
 directly with the subject of the video 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.860
 call of the dinosaurs what the fuck 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.820
 so just be aware that me 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.399
 personally you know with a 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.750
 pseudo like tirano ben here I love 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.100
 the dinosaurs and it's really some 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.009
 thing that fascinates me things will be 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.630
 totally delusional than before the race 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.219
 human before all they animals 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.250
 the apes end our ancestors etc 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.960
 no matter the breeds regardless of the 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:06.180
 the animal styles and ben there was 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.710
 dinosaurs it impresses me that 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.119
 tell me yes there was a guy finally a 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.709
 animal that was fifteen meters long 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.540
 who makes you all they had on 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.340
 them during his passage and that's what 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.780
 impresses me simply and it's for 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.220
 that I'm a little bit passionate 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.100
 by all that is dinosaurs for 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:22.799
 your information for example a for 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.630
 parenthesis in quotation marks and well 

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:26.310
 for example there will be jurassic park 4 which 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.410
 is called jurassic make you who 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.700
 will be released mid June this year and so I 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.870
 a title really and see it wood I 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.440
 am not the stretch is done by steven 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.180
 spielberg 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.310
 but now we broke the little info 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.720
 tirano of the day and so that's call of 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.710
 duty dinosaurs simply why 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.450
 m 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:41.130
 I learned a little bit and 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.200
 we were tic us gold is not 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.490
 expected then dare to say but you could 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.960
 you make us a video about that and we 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:48.120
 I just wanted to share a 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:49.740
 little bit something a little trick 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.540
 nice it's just I have a 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:54.690
 little bit sought all the fps so I 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.950
 first person shooting where it's 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.930
 war games so like 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.190
 battlefield like kolo getti those there 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.380
 are the best known and look for a 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:04.410
 little bit this kind of game but version 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:06.030
 dinosaurs so actually where would that be or 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:07.800
 well you control a dinosaur with a 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.510
 gun I do not know or you control 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.310
 or would have done in two shifts 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.990
 one ooh that very dinosaurs and the other that 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.490
 would actually be hunters and so I 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:15.690
 I really came across a game that 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:17.370
 is called primal carnage 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.050
 and that's where I said wow 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:20.850
 but it's splendid so you have to 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:22.530
 to know that bad carnage is a game that 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:26.400
 was out on steam this is a 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.690
 multiplayer dinosaurs vs hunters game 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.430
 and his ranks a juice that actually had 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.990
 fury a totally equestrian game 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:34.050
 imagine yourself controlling a pterodactyl 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:36.150
 contain a t-rex and you have to eat 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:38.460
 labourdins of scientists from 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.900
 hunters finally a little bit of all that 

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:40.710
 it's a game that was released on steam 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.110
 they will just make a 

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:46.800
 new game that will be exclusively 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:48.360
 develop on pc and playstation 4 which 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:50.490
 will be called primal carnage genesi 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.080
 shawville game we will put the moment all 

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:54.150
 simply men pieces of 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.650
 trailer that will put you the water at the 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.090
 mouth you to say but wow it's 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:59.730
 impressive and well yes it's 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:01.770
 completely shivering a game with 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.120
 completely watts graphics and to 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:05.700
 really they put to tell you ah 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.070
 they put one on this game they will do 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:09.480
 turn the game on a graphics engine 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:10.950
 such as this one from battlefield so has 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.720
 really a game that goes to support 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:13.860
 completely crazy graphics and 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.840
 it's a pleasure 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:17.580
 see at least people who do 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.620
 originality that take not the same 

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:21.449
 the principles 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.610
 others the concepts of others to 

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:25.770
 do something pretty different but 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:27.840
 they will change almost nothing here 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:29.520
 it's completely going away with something 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.680
 completely original and why i like 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.389
 in any case thanks to the developers who 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:36.600
 are I do not know anymore I do not do anymore 

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:38.550
 sorry no no I do not know anymore I did 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:40.229
 warm china no bah sorry to the brief 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:42.180
 so basically really unfair splendid 

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:43.440
 and that's why I wanted to 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:45.270
 just speak this game is going to be 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:46.710
 developed and I will keep abreast of 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:48.060
 social networks when it will come out 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:51.030
 here are two the date is simply 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:52.380
 not yet planned he even had the idea 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:54.030
 completely what the fuck 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:55.650
 it was bankruptcy - said in a 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:58.260
 interview this simply 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:00.990
 develop the game with the next 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:04.320
 virtual reality helmet so as 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:08.039
 the recluse thrift nose on this game actually 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:09.930
 you would be on an island and with your 

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:11.370
 age for example and would have dinosaurs 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:13.050
 that would happen by all and you are 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:15.570
 with uncle virtual reality helmet 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:16.979
 rather without really on the island and that's 

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:18.660
 totally impressive I do not know 

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:19.800
 really if the rendering will be at the rendezvous 

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:20.820
 but in any case it could really 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.830
 to give something crazy 

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:24.780
 the ideas they have is totally or 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:26.039
 sim girl anyway I hope it's 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:27.660
 a little you will have liked I hope in everything 

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:30.060
 case that primal carnage on has everything 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:31.500
 just a success because here I am 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:34.620
 I look forward to it, I hope so too 

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:35.849
 that just jurassic park 4 are 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:37.500
 also a success you know me 

00:05:35.849 --> 00:05:39.510
 this urano you really have to put a 

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:40.860
 little I like thanks to the good plan of the geek 

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:43.410

 very nice evening everything depends on the moment

 where you will see this video is that of the 

00:05:49.229 --> 00:05:52.970
 world and it was a lease everyone
