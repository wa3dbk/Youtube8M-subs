feet and 3 feet increments this means

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.399 
feet and 3 feet increments this means
that<00:01:20.340> it<00:01:20.490> is<00:01:20.610> basically<00:01:21.210> quite<00:01:21.780> a<00:01:21.900> big<00:01:22.140> crane

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
that it is basically quite a big crane

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.499 
that it is basically quite a big crane
but<00:01:23.100> what<00:01:23.310> if<00:01:23.490> you<00:01:23.700> need<00:01:23.850> a<00:01:23.909> shorter<00:01:24.299> creme

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
but what if you need a shorter creme

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.510 
but what if you need a shorter creme
than<00:01:24.689> that<00:01:24.840> you<00:01:25.500> simply<00:01:25.740> extend<00:01:26.310> less

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
than that you simply extend less

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.580 
than that you simply extend less
sections<00:01:26.970> what's<00:01:27.360> more<00:01:27.659> is<00:01:27.840> we<00:01:28.140> leave<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.439> an

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
sections what's more is we leave the an

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.710 
sections what's more is we leave the an
extended<00:01:29.100> sections<00:01:29.520> in<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:29.820> tail<00:01:30.030> which

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
extended sections in the tail which

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.149 
extended sections in the tail which
means<00:01:30.960> you<00:01:31.140> need<00:01:31.259> to<00:01:31.409> carry<00:01:31.619> around<00:01:31.740> less

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
means you need to carry around less

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.130 
means you need to carry around less
counterweight<00:01:32.759> for<00:01:33.000> ballast<00:01:33.360> with<00:01:33.960> less
