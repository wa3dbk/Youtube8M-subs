00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:07.799
 they were the first groups to commit 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:09.800
 breaking through the iron curtain not 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.100
 transfer to the USSR the long-awaited wind 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:14.090
 change wards grew not one 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:17.020
 generation but they themselves don't seem at all 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:19.450
 getting older however nothing lasts forever and failing 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:21.279
 results of your career impressions 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:23.490
 the most successful in the history of German rock 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.320
 the group went to the world farewell 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.519
 usa tour latin america europe and 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:30.840
 finally Russia nineteenth of May 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.160
 skorpion last performed at 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.160
 Novosibirsk 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.570
 rubles 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.890
 Valeriy Chaly in the police 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.990
 boats with our group existed very much 

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:06.180
 long over forty years old and all this time we 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.170
 enjoyed our life and creativity 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.340
 music and now we would like to give 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.320
 our fans a great show 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.010
 especially not remember us precisely such all 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:17.120
 coming to the end and we want to leave now 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.450
 when we are still on top of fame they 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.060
 waiting for her to decline but what 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.050
 we'll probably do it later then 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:26.580
 will show maybe sooner or later appear 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.369
 any new proposals 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:31.460
 projects see andrey klepach rn 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.490
 March 13 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.220
 at 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.540
 surely this music is integral 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.490
 part of our life of course we will 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:51.880
 continue and engage even 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.740
 despite not going out on 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:54.759
 big stage 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:57.759
 but maybe we will play not only at home 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:10.979
 process 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.999
 if there were no group possible to 

00:02:12.999 --> 00:02:13.989
 a photographer 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:15.609
 yes because music is my first 

00:02:15.609 --> 00:02:18.209
 big love and the second is pictures 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:19.900
 but when you are young and you something 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.310
 really like me 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:22.579
 liked the musician 

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:24.469
 immerse yourself in it great and you can't 

00:02:24.469 --> 00:02:26.049
 live without it therefore seems to me 

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:28.169
 the fact that this group appeared scorpions 

00:02:28.169 --> 00:02:29.939
 regularity because otherwise 

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:31.989
 just could not be I can not imagine 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:33.790
 that my life was different 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.810
 because I can not imagine it in him 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.599
 Zyke Czech all national 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:41.599
 minorities 

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:49.809
 Yes 

00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:51.229
 perhaps one of the most memorable 

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:53.230
 moments of our career 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:54.909
 performance on the 80th anniversary of Michael 

00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:57.670
 Gorbachev it was a great honor for us 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.720
 be invited to london to play together 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:00.670
 with London symphony 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.139
 orchestra 

00:03:02.139 --> 00:03:03.989
 it was a very special event in 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:07.019
 our life 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:10.019
 soon 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:26.029
 In Tunisia, perhaps each of us can 

00:03:26.029 --> 00:03:28.650
 with confidence to say yes what was your dream 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.979
 childhood reality has come true in some ways even 

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:32.389
 surpassed our dreams 

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:34.439
 however we are still dreaming 

00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:36.569
 because a man cannot live without a dream 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:38.059
 appeal 

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:39.089
 most 

00:03:39.089 --> 00:03:42.409
 Ilyich Ramirez Corr he is us belgium us 

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:43.969
 There is a farewell gift for our 

00:03:43.969 --> 00:03:46.019
 fans from this week ago we did 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:47.720
 our recording was in Germany 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.550
 and I think pretty soon most likely to 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:51.879
 the new year she will appear in stores 

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:53.879
 and you can watch videos and feel 

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:56.010
 yourself as if at a speed concert like 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:59.010
 as if we were still coming 

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:19.340
 radar assessment 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:25.289
 true 

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:27.680
 Now I would like to thank you for 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:30.319
 warm welcome i am always very happy to be back in 

00:04:30.319 --> 00:04:33.319
 Uzhgorod and glad to see you all 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:54.680
