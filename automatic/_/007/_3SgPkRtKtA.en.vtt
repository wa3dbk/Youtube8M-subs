00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:05.340
 Hi, I'm welcome to warm 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:13.099
 today we will talk about the paladins 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:15.110
 the paladins are the masters of 

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:17.840
 remote weapons as are the arcs 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:19.970
 crossbows or spears are those little people 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.439
 you see running while behind 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:23.480
 they bring a monster that is 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:26.270
 suffering great damage by their spears and 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.410
 arrows the paladins are based on a 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:29.449
 balance 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.880
 they have balanced their lives and their 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:34.070
 manna this makes them a kind 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.220
 warrior wizard although certainly 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.839
 they hit very hard with remote attacks 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:41.050
 they go up very, very fast 

00:00:38.839 --> 00:00:44.390
 distance fighting I say fast 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:46.399
 disgustingly fast in my opinion and 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.199
 according to experiences that I have had is the 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:50.899
 class with the fastest you get 

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:53.809
 skins in an afternoon you can climb skins 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:55.560
 days away to skin 55 away 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:59.160
 without much problem 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:00.960
 they also have a good garden that is worse 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.480
 that of the knights but very much 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.630
 better than the wizards this is obvious 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.150
 well remember that they are hybrids 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:11.370
 let's analyze the advantages of palau 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:13.020
 the first as I mentioned was 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:14.960
 that are very fast climbing your ski 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.550
 main or the distance wire and 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:20.610
 they are also pretty good at raising the 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:22.860
 skills of charlin and milk and something else very 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.390
 important is that the dancers are the 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.630
 only vocation that can conjure 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.820
 weapons using their magic also have 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.880
 much more capacity and more life than 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.430
 the magicians like the droid and the short being 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.869
 they also have more mana than knights 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:39.420
 they also regenerate life faster than 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.800
 the new and more mana faster than the 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.980
 mets 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.930
 also unlike the nights they 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.610
 they can make three types of runes and 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.920
 learn quite a few species that 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:53.070
 will help both utility and 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.590
 attack and also on top of that the 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.800
 Paladin use heavy equipment like that of the 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.690
 knights but as we already know not everything is 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:03.590
 fun the paladins have 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:06.289
 disadvantages and are the following 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.569
 your advantage becomes a disadvantage because 

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:10.310
 they can only do three types of runes and 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:13.459
 even though they learn good after 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:15.319
 most will be useful you can 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:17.599
 consider disadvantage the fact that 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:19.280
 can use heavy armor but not 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:21.560
 have the same capacity at the time of 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.110
 load items that a night so it could 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.599
 become an inconvenience too 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.310
 paladins have little manna and 

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:30.390
 what good should relate the 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.400
 intelligently 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.709
 their regeneration of life and they send 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.140
 increasing an average speed that 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:39.300
 although it is not good or bad if you take 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:42.709
 more than a night in raising your life or more 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.709
 that a magician in raising your mana 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.400
 also the magic level becomes difficult 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.400
 to climb after reaching the magic and 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.170
 level 8 and the last one is that when they are 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.480
 more than level 100 they start to have 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.099
 some problems in the wars due to 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.530
 that do not have the same resistance that 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:01.140
 a night or the same mana as a magician 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.640
 to be healing as we can see 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.530
 the paladins are a mixture of all 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.209
 vocations and it is also quite 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:09.510
 good to raise level in the first 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:11.010
 levels of fact is very fast in a 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.109
 you can get up from the 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:16.079
 level 9 up to level 20 without much 

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:19.159
 clear difficulty if there is good backup 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:19.159
 but that's another thing 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.830
 When you reach level 20 you can 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.530
 buy your promotion which brings you 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:28.540
 many advantages the first is that 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:30.430
 you stop being a normal paladin for 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.120
 transform you into a majestic royal 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:35.920
 paladin the second is that when dying 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:38.560
 reduce your loss by 30% 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.660
 experience was nothing your life and mana 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.540
 will increase faster and if it were 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:45.580
 little your soul will rise from 100 to 200 what 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.890
 which will allow you to invoke more ammunition 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:49.569
 I remind you that the promotion goes into 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:51.880
 Pause when you lose your premium time 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:54.010
 but whenever you turn it off again 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:56.980
 you will receive your promotion again intact 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:59.349
 just as you left her 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:01.450
 a normal paladin regenerates a point of 

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:03.700
 life every eight seconds and two points 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:05.890
 weeks every four seconds while 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:08.290
 that a royal paladin regenerates a point 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:10.870
 of life every six seconds and two points 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:12.580
 of mana every three seconds what comes 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:14.739
 being a reduction of two seconds in 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:17.199
 the regeneration of life and a second in 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:19.060
 mana regeneration so good is 

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:21.980
 It is advisable to buy your 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:23.900
 promotion whenever you are premium 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:25.580
 I also have to mention that the 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:27.680
 paladins can use most of the 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:30.710
 runes that are in the market including 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:32.200
 the famous ones of cds so be careful with 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:33.880
 they 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:35.350
 before finishing this video I want 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.770
 send a greeting to my friends of the 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:37.660

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:42.260
