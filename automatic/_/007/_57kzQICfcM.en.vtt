00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:34.569 
I just found it here and seemingly it

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:37.800 
I just found it here and seemingly it
has<00:03:34.930> no<00:03:35.200> purpose<00:03:35.700> because<00:03:36.700> there<00:03:37.060> is<00:03:37.239> no<00:03:37.480> sign

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
has no purpose because there is no sign

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:40.470 
has no purpose because there is no sign
near<00:03:38.170> it<00:03:38.349> there<00:03:39.099> is<00:03:39.280> no<00:03:39.430> grand-opening<00:03:39.849> nearby

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
near it there is no grand-opening nearby

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:46.380 
near it there is no grand-opening nearby
it's<00:03:41.110> just<00:03:41.349> in<00:03:41.470> here

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:46.390 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:48.150 

and<00:03:46.750> I'm<00:03:47.050> trying<00:03:47.410> to<00:03:47.440> think<00:03:47.530> of<00:03:47.800> how<00:03:47.920> I<00:03:47.950> can

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.160 
and I'm trying to think of how I can

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.130 
and I'm trying to think of how I can
abuse<00:03:48.580> this

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:51.140 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:53.290 

I<00:03:51.200> just<00:03:52.160> don't<00:03:52.310> know<00:03:52.400> what<00:03:52.520> to<00:03:52.610> do<00:03:52.760> I<00:03:52.940> thought

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:53.300 
I just don't know what to do I thought

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:54.730 
I just don't know what to do I thought
about<00:03:53.420> putting<00:03:53.569> my<00:03:53.900> helmet<00:03:54.290> in<00:03:54.380> front<00:03:54.590> of<00:03:54.680> the

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:54.740 
about putting my helmet in front of the

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:55.930 
about putting my helmet in front of the
light<00:03:54.950> and<00:03:55.160> seeing<00:03:55.430> if<00:03:55.580> it<00:03:55.700> makes<00:03:55.819> the

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940 
light and seeing if it makes the

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:59.530 
light and seeing if it makes the
