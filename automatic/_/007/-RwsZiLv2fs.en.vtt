to<00:01:22.860> Android<00:01:23.580> I<00:01:23.970> was<00:01:24.509> talking<00:01:24.720> with<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.140> guy

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
to Android I was talking with the guy

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.080 
to Android I was talking with the guy
there<00:01:25.710> i<00:01:25.740> mean<00:01:26.009> i<00:01:26.130> don't<00:01:26.369> i<00:01:26.520> haven't<00:01:26.939> used

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
there i mean i don't i haven't used

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.730 
there i mean i don't i haven't used
android<00:01:27.540> since<00:01:27.900> i<00:01:27.990> got<00:01:28.140> all<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.470> incredible

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
android since i got all the incredible

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.950 
android since i got all the incredible
but<00:01:29.250> it<00:01:29.369> really<00:01:29.610> looks<00:01:30.030> like<00:01:30.119> android<00:01:30.930> has

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
but it really looks like android has

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.399 
but it really looks like android has
matured<00:01:31.259> a<00:01:32.009> lot<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:33.479> big<00:01:33.630> question<00:01:33.780> is<00:01:34.170> is<00:01:34.380> it

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
matured a lot the big question is is it

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.170 
matured a lot the big question is is it
hasn't<00:01:34.740> matured<00:01:34.860> to<00:01:35.100> a<00:01:35.250> point<00:01:35.340> where<00:01:35.670> i<00:01:35.790> won't

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
hasn't matured to a point where i won't

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.620 
hasn't matured to a point where i won't
regret<00:01:36.479> using<00:01:37.259> it<00:01:37.790> because<00:01:38.790> I'm<00:01:39.180> pretty<00:01:39.450> used

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
regret using it because I'm pretty used

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.539 
regret using it because I'm pretty used
to<00:01:39.750> iOS<00:01:40.290> and<00:01:40.530> I<00:01:40.560> think<00:01:40.770> iOS<00:01:41.130> is<00:01:41.280> a<00:01:41.340> pretty

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
to iOS and I think iOS is a pretty

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.359 
to iOS and I think iOS is a pretty
stable<00:01:42.320> very<00:01:43.320> well<00:01:43.590> supported<00:01:43.799> operating

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
stable very well supported operating

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.210 
stable very well supported operating
system<00:01:44.939> there's<00:01:45.119> a<00:01:45.180> lot<00:01:45.509> of<00:01:45.540> great<00:01:45.930> apps<00:01:46.220> in

if you're using the iphone I'll be

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:58.930 
if you're using the iphone I'll be
really<00:02:57.739> curious<00:02:58.040> would<00:02:58.370> you<00:02:58.489> consider

going<00:03:02.690> with<00:03:02.870> a<00:03:02.930> samsung<00:03:03.560> I<00:03:03.830> I<00:03:04.400> personally

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
going with a samsung I I personally

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.630 
going with a samsung I I personally
think<00:03:05.420> the<00:03:05.510> hardware<00:03:06.049> is<00:03:06.290> a<00:03:06.769> lot<00:03:07.130> better<00:03:07.430> than

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640 
think the hardware is a lot better than

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.220 
think the hardware is a lot better than
the<00:03:07.730> iphone<00:03:07.760> just<00:03:08.390> by<00:03:08.540> looking<00:03:08.900> at<00:03:08.989> it<00:03:09.049> and

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
the iphone just by looking at it and

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.110 
the iphone just by looking at it and
messing<00:03:09.500> around<00:03:09.590> with<00:03:09.860> it<00:03:09.980> I<00:03:10.160> think<00:03:10.549> Samsung

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
messing around with it I think Samsung

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.270 
messing around with it I think Samsung
is<00:03:11.299> beat<00:03:11.569> Apple<00:03:12.080> in<00:03:12.170> this<00:03:12.290> regard<00:03:12.680> well<00:03:13.160> so

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
is beat Apple in this regard well so

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:14.680 
is beat Apple in this regard well so
what<00:03:13.430> really<00:03:13.640> comes<00:03:13.880> down<00:03:14.030> to<00:03:14.209> is<00:03:14.599> the

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
what really comes down to is the

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:16.660 
what really comes down to is the
operating<00:03:15.170> system<00:03:15.620> and<00:03:15.860> the<00:03:16.190> apps<00:03:16.340> that<00:03:16.489> are

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
operating system and the apps that are

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:20.500 
operating system and the apps that are
available<00:03:16.700> for<00:03:17.329> it<00:03:17.480> and<00:03:18.010> you<00:03:19.010> know<00:03:19.549> that<00:03:20.299> is

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
available for it and you know that is

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:22.240 
available for it and you know that is
where<00:03:20.840> the<00:03:21.260> jury<00:03:21.530> is<00:03:21.680> still<00:03:21.799> out<00:03:22.040> in<00:03:22.220> my

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
where the jury is still out in my

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.009 
where the jury is still out in my
opinion<00:03:22.640> right<00:03:22.910> now<00:03:22.940> I'm<00:03:23.239> pretty<00:03:23.450> tied<00:03:23.810> to

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:24.019 
opinion right now I'm pretty tied to

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:26.080 
opinion right now I'm pretty tied to
this<00:03:24.200> I<00:03:24.500> do<00:03:24.620> use<00:03:25.070> a<00:03:25.100> Mac<00:03:25.400> here<00:03:25.730> in<00:03:25.820> the<00:03:25.910> office

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
this I do use a Mac here in the office

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.289 
this I do use a Mac here in the office
so<00:03:26.600> this<00:03:26.810> works<00:03:27.109> out<00:03:27.260> really<00:03:27.560> well<00:03:27.680> for<00:03:27.859> me<00:03:28.299> but

00:03:29.289 --> 00:03:29.299 
so this works out really well for me but

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:32.020 
so this works out really well for me but
I<00:03:29.569> don't<00:03:29.900> know<00:03:30.019> that<00:03:30.230> Samsung<00:03:30.739> is<00:03:30.890> nice<00:03:31.100> and

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
I don't know that Samsung is nice and

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:33.729 
I don't know that Samsung is nice and
you<00:03:32.510> know<00:03:32.600> if<00:03:32.780> the<00:03:32.930> iphone<00:03:33.049> would<00:03:33.440> come<00:03:33.620> up

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:33.739 
you know if the iphone would come up

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:35.259 
you know if the iphone would come up
with<00:03:33.829> a<00:03:33.890> screen<00:03:34.220> that<00:03:34.250> size<00:03:34.700> that<00:03:35.030> would<00:03:35.120> be

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:35.269 
with a screen that size that would be

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:37.229 
with a screen that size that would be
great<00:03:35.660> but<00:03:35.690> I'm<00:03:36.049> not<00:03:36.230> sure<00:03:36.260> they're<00:03:36.590> going<00:03:36.920> to

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 
great but I'm not sure they're going to

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:39.880 
great but I'm not sure they're going to
