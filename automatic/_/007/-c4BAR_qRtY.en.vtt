00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
to see down there even though it's kind

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.120 
to see down there even though it's kind
of<00:00:09.870> dark<00:00:10.139> so<00:00:10.490> here's<00:00:11.490> how<00:00:11.700> the<00:00:11.759> pedals<00:00:12.150> work

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:13.130 
of dark so here's how the pedals work

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:16.400 
of dark so here's how the pedals work
this<00:00:14.130> is<00:00:14.400> your<00:00:14.549> clutch<00:00:14.849> so<00:00:15.330> the<00:00:15.450> clutch<00:00:15.719> when

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
this is your clutch so the clutch when

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.529 
this is your clutch so the clutch when
it's<00:00:16.560> left<00:00:17.310> alone<00:00:17.640> and<00:00:17.820> your<00:00:17.910> foot<00:00:18.060> isn't<00:00:18.210> on

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
it's left alone and your foot isn't on

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.150 
it's left alone and your foot isn't on
it<00:00:18.570> the<00:00:18.840> hinge<00:00:19.020> is<00:00:19.380> connected<00:00:19.920> to<00:00:19.949> the

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
it the hinge is connected to the

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.890 
it the hinge is connected to the
transmission<00:00:20.699> when<00:00:21.150> you<00:00:21.240> push<00:00:21.390> it<00:00:21.420> down<00:00:21.570> the

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
transmission when you push it down the

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.029 
transmission when you push it down the
engine<00:00:22.140> is<00:00:22.230> not<00:00:22.410> connected<00:00:22.859> to<00:00:22.890> the

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
engine is not connected to the

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.679 
engine is not connected to the
transmission<00:00:23.430> and<00:00:23.699> somewhere<00:00:24.269> in<00:00:24.480> between

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
transmission and somewhere in between

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.550 
transmission and somewhere in between
the<00:00:25.350> calf<00:00:25.529> way<00:00:25.800> is<00:00:26.070> when<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:27.869> engine<00:00:28.289> and<00:00:28.470> the

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
the calf way is when the engine and the

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.859 
the calf way is when the engine and the
transmission<00:00:28.640> the<00:00:29.640> clutch<00:00:29.910> plates<00:00:30.179> come

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
transmission the clutch plates come

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.889 
transmission the clutch plates come
together<00:00:31.170> via<00:00:31.769> spring<00:00:32.189> pressure<00:00:32.399> and<00:00:33.329> they're

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
together via spring pressure and they're

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.690 
together via spring pressure and they're
kind<00:00:34.110> of<00:00:34.170> rub<00:00:34.530> together<00:00:34.739> at<00:00:35.130> that<00:00:35.340> point<00:00:35.579> so

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
kind of rub together at that point so

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.430 
kind of rub together at that point so
you<00:00:35.760> don't<00:00:36.000> ever<00:00:36.210> want<00:00:36.450> to<00:00:36.570> keep<00:00:37.200> it<00:00:37.320> in

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
you don't ever want to keep it in

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.530 
you don't ever want to keep it in
between<00:00:37.890> for<00:00:38.160> too<00:00:38.309> long<00:00:38.520> you<00:00:39.059> want<00:00:39.239> to<00:00:39.300> get<00:00:39.420> the

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
between for too long you want to get the

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.049 
between for too long you want to get the
engine<00:00:39.809> revved<00:00:40.020> up<00:00:40.230> and<00:00:40.379> then<00:00:41.219> kind<00:00:41.730> of<00:00:41.879> feel

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
engine revved up and then kind of feel

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.240 
engine revved up and then kind of feel
it<00:00:42.180> catch<00:00:42.450> and<00:00:42.809> then<00:00:43.079> let<00:00:43.350> it<00:00:43.500> out<00:00:43.620> and<00:00:43.950> then

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
it catch and then let it out and then

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.520 
it catch and then let it out and then
rev<00:00:44.520> it<00:00:44.640> up<00:00:44.700> more<00:00:44.940> to<00:00:45.690> go<00:00:45.870> and<00:00:46.200> so<00:00:46.320> of<00:00:46.410> course

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
rev it up more to go and so of course

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.049 
rev it up more to go and so of course
the<00:00:46.739> middle<00:00:46.920> ones<00:00:47.070> your<00:00:47.190> brake<00:00:47.399> and<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:47.910> one

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
the middle ones your brake and the one

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.840 
the middle ones your brake and the one
on<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.270> right<00:00:48.539> is<00:00:48.809> your<00:00:49.140> accelerator<00:00:49.739> this<00:00:50.700> is

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
on the right is your accelerator this is

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.799 
on the right is your accelerator this is
your<00:00:50.969> stick<00:00:51.180> shift<00:00:51.770> 1<00:00:52.770> 2<00:00:53.010> 3<00:00:53.280> 4<00:00:53.610> 5<00:00:54.120> and<00:00:54.600> then

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
your stick shift 1 2 3 4 5 and then

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.650 
your stick shift 1 2 3 4 5 and then
reverse<00:00:55.430> down<00:00:56.430> low<00:00:56.820> so<00:00:57.149> now<00:00:57.300> let's<00:00:57.480> get<00:00:57.600> into

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
reverse down low so now let's get into

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.380 
reverse down low so now let's get into
the<00:00:58.520> exactly<00:00:59.520> what<00:00:59.670> I'm<00:00:59.789> doing<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.239> how<00:01:00.329> the

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
the exactly what I'm doing and how the

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.090 
the exactly what I'm doing and how the
engine<00:01:00.690> is<00:01:00.780> revving<00:01:00.989> alright<00:01:01.770> so<00:01:01.920> when<00:01:02.070> you

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
engine is revving alright so when you

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.529 
engine is revving alright so when you
start<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.430> car<00:01:02.520> you<00:01:02.969> always<00:01:03.210> want<00:01:03.359> to<00:01:03.390> push

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
start the car you always want to push

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.630 
start the car you always want to push
down<00:01:03.570> on<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:03.960> clutch<00:01:04.199> just<00:01:05.070> in<00:01:05.159> case<00:01:05.339> it's<00:01:05.519> in

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
down on the clutch just in case it's in

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.160 
down on the clutch just in case it's in
gear<00:01:05.939> some<00:01:06.180> cars<00:01:06.390> have<00:01:06.450> you<00:01:06.630> started<00:01:06.960> and<00:01:07.080> it's

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
gear some cars have you started and it's

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.420 
gear some cars have you started and it's
in<00:01:07.290> gear<00:01:07.439> it'll<00:01:07.590> just<00:01:07.770> start<00:01:07.890> rolling<00:01:08.040> on<00:01:08.250> you

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
in gear it'll just start rolling on you

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.039 
in gear it'll just start rolling on you
most<00:01:08.580> of<00:01:08.729> them<00:01:08.820> have<00:01:09.000> an<00:01:09.090> electronic<00:01:09.630> lock<00:01:09.780> out

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
most of them have an electronic lock out

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.899 
most of them have an electronic lock out
and<00:01:10.260> so<00:01:10.740> now<00:01:10.770> I've<00:01:10.979> shifted<00:01:11.369> into<00:01:11.490> can<00:01:11.729> you<00:01:11.790> see

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
and so now I've shifted into can you see

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.609 
and so now I've shifted into can you see
my<00:01:12.000> shifter<00:01:12.450> yeah<00:01:12.600> see<00:01:12.900> so<00:01:13.140> I<00:01:13.200> shifted<00:01:13.500> into

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
my shifter yeah see so I shifted into

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.580 
my shifter yeah see so I shifted into
first<00:01:13.890> gear<00:01:14.659> then<00:01:15.659> I<00:01:15.750> give<00:01:15.900> it<00:01:15.990> a<00:01:16.049> little<00:01:16.380> bit

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
first gear then I give it a little bit

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.580 
first gear then I give it a little bit
of<00:01:16.680> gas<00:01:16.890> not<00:01:17.189> a<00:01:17.220> lot<00:01:18.049> and<00:01:19.049> I<00:01:19.200> release<00:01:19.470> the

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
of gas not a lot and I release the

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.050 
of gas not a lot and I release the
parking<00:01:19.770> brake<00:01:19.950> which<00:01:20.250> is<00:01:20.369> right<00:01:20.520> here<00:01:20.729> so<00:01:20.880> the

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
parking brake which is right here so the

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.130 
parking brake which is right here so the
parking<00:01:21.360> brake<00:01:21.479> make<00:01:21.659> sure<00:01:21.780> you<00:01:21.869> don't<00:01:21.960> roll

on<00:01:22.200> your<00:01:22.409> part<00:01:22.850> and<00:01:23.850> then<00:01:24.600> just<00:01:24.869> let<00:01:25.110> it<00:01:25.259> out

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
on your part and then just let it out

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
gently and then we're rolling now to get

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.980 
gently and then we're rolling now to get
into<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:29.009> next<00:01:29.340> gear<00:01:29.579> I<00:01:29.820> push<00:01:30.689> in<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:30.960> clutch

into the next gear I push in the clutch

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.100 
into the next gear I push in the clutch
and<00:01:31.560> then<00:01:31.740> I<00:01:31.829> rev<00:01:32.130> up<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:33.090> engine<00:01:33.450> to<00:01:33.930> the

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
and then I rev up the engine to the

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.170 
and then I rev up the engine to the
right<00:01:34.290> amount<00:01:34.590> of<00:01:34.650> rpms<00:01:35.159> to<00:01:35.310> match<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.880> speed

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
right amount of rpms to match the speed

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.710 
right amount of rpms to match the speed
of<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:38.100> transmission<00:01:38.640> and<00:01:38.759> then<00:01:39.240> I<00:01:39.270> let<00:01:39.600> the

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
of the transmission and then I let the

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.440 
of the transmission and then I let the
clutch<00:01:39.930> out<00:01:40.170> so<00:01:40.799> that<00:01:41.250> takes<00:01:41.850> a<00:01:42.030> little<00:01:42.180> bit<00:01:42.360> of

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
clutch out so that takes a little bit of

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.389 
clutch out so that takes a little bit of
finesse<00:01:42.680> getting<00:01:43.680> it<00:01:43.770> and<00:01:43.950> then<00:01:44.040> if<00:01:44.130> I<00:01:44.189> want<00:01:44.369> a

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
finesse getting it and then if I want a

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.160 
finesse getting it and then if I want a
downshift<00:01:44.610> then<00:01:45.180> I<00:01:45.270> shift<00:01:45.479> down<00:01:45.689> again

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
downshift then I shift down again

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.740 
downshift then I shift down again
and<00:01:46.259> I<00:01:46.619> use<00:01:46.860> my<00:01:47.070> accelerator<00:01:47.820> foot<00:01:48.149> to<00:01:48.570> rev<00:01:48.720> up

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
and I use my accelerator foot to rev up

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.840 
and I use my accelerator foot to rev up
the<00:01:48.960> engine<00:01:49.290> to<00:01:49.649> match<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:50.070> RPMs<00:01:50.490> of<00:01:50.700> the

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
the engine to match the RPMs of the

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.630 
the engine to match the RPMs of the
transmission<00:01:51.450> so<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:52.380> idea<00:01:52.740> is<00:01:52.920> with<00:01:53.520> the

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
transmission so the idea is with the

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.959 
transmission so the idea is with the
clutch<00:01:53.880> plates<00:01:54.860> when<00:01:55.860> they're<00:01:56.189> a<00:01:56.219> part<00:01:56.670> you

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
clutch plates when they're a part you

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.520 
clutch plates when they're a part you
want<00:01:57.149> to<00:01:57.210> try<00:01:57.509> and<00:01:57.659> make<00:01:57.810> them<00:01:57.930> spin<00:01:58.229> at<00:01:58.439> the

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
want to try and make them spin at the

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.109 
want to try and make them spin at the
same<00:01:58.710> speed<00:01:59.009> rather<00:01:59.610> than<00:01:59.820> one<00:01:59.939> of<00:01:59.969> them

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
same speed rather than one of them

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.490 
same speed rather than one of them
spinning<00:02:00.329> fast<00:02:00.570> and<00:02:00.810> then<00:02:00.899> the<00:02:00.990> other<00:02:01.110> one<00:02:01.290> not

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
spinning fast and then the other one not

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.080 
spinning fast and then the other one not
like<00:02:01.920> if<00:02:02.040> you<00:02:02.130> rev<00:02:02.310> it<00:02:02.340> up<00:02:02.490> and<00:02:02.670> pop<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:02.939> clutch

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
like if you rev it up and pop the clutch

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.670 
like if you rev it up and pop the clutch
to<00:02:03.329> go<00:02:03.420> fast

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
to go fast

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.740 
to go fast
you<00:02:05.680> can<00:02:05.800> hear<00:02:05.920> the<00:02:06.040> wheels<00:02:06.220> screech<00:02:06.880> but

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
you can hear the wheels screech but

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:09.420 
you can hear the wheels screech but
that's<00:02:07.960> terrible<00:02:08.470> for<00:02:08.560> your<00:02:08.650> clutch<00:02:08.890> because

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:09.430 
that's terrible for your clutch because

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:11.490 
that's terrible for your clutch because
one<00:02:10.030> plate<00:02:10.330> is<00:02:10.479> standing<00:02:10.780> still<00:02:11.200> and<00:02:11.440> the

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
one plate is standing still and the

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.120 
one plate is standing still and the
other<00:02:11.530> ones<00:02:11.830> slamming<00:02:12.310> up<00:02:12.400> against<00:02:12.700> it<00:02:12.820> and

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
other ones slamming up against it and

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.080 
other ones slamming up against it and
your<00:02:15.130> clutch<00:02:15.340> is<00:02:15.460> gonna<00:02:15.610> wear<00:02:15.760> out<00:02:15.880> a<00:02:15.910> lot

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
your clutch is gonna wear out a lot

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.060 
your clutch is gonna wear out a lot
faster<00:02:16.510> than<00:02:16.630> if<00:02:16.750> you<00:02:16.870> go<00:02:16.990> gentle<00:02:17.380> so<00:02:17.800> gently

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.070 
faster than if you go gentle so gently

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:21.450 
faster than if you go gentle so gently
has<00:02:18.310> just<00:02:18.660> put<00:02:19.660> it<00:02:19.750> in<00:02:19.870> gear<00:02:20.170> give<00:02:21.160> it<00:02:21.250> a<00:02:21.310> little

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:21.460 
has just put it in gear give it a little

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:24.630 
has just put it in gear give it a little
gas<00:02:21.700> and<00:02:22.680> then<00:02:23.680> just<00:02:23.860> kind<00:02:24.010> of<00:02:24.040> roll<00:02:24.250> into<00:02:24.460> it

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
gas and then just kind of roll into it

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.910 
gas and then just kind of roll into it
and<00:02:24.910> then<00:02:25.120> shifting<00:02:25.510> gears<00:02:25.750> give<00:02:26.530> it<00:02:26.620> a<00:02:26.680> little

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
and then shifting gears give it a little

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.100 
and then shifting gears give it a little
bit<00:02:27.040> of<00:02:27.130> revs<00:02:27.340> to<00:02:28.150> match<00:02:28.360> the<00:02:28.570> transmission

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
bit of revs to match the transmission

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:30.750 
bit of revs to match the transmission
speed<00:02:29.320> and<00:02:29.560> you<00:02:29.860> can<00:02:29.890> feel<00:02:30.130> how<00:02:30.250> smooth<00:02:30.520> that

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
speed and you can feel how smooth that

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.050 
speed and you can feel how smooth that
was<00:02:30.940> if<00:02:31.870> you<00:02:31.990> have<00:02:32.110> a<00:02:32.140> tachometer<00:02:32.910> then<00:02:33.910> the

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
was if you have a tachometer then the

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.780 
was if you have a tachometer then the
tachometer<00:02:34.470> if<00:02:35.470> you<00:02:35.650> know<00:02:35.890> how<00:02:36.130> fast<00:02:36.370> the<00:02:36.610> road

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
tachometer if you know how fast the road

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.730 
tachometer if you know how fast the road
speed<00:02:37.120> is<00:02:37.150> in<00:02:37.630> a<00:02:37.750> particular<00:02:38.380> gear<00:02:38.590> from

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:38.740 
speed is in a particular gear from

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:41.880 
speed is in a particular gear from
watching<00:02:39.040> your<00:02:39.130> tachometer<00:02:39.670> then<00:02:40.710> you<00:02:41.710> can

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
watching your tachometer then you can

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:43.320 
watching your tachometer then you can
rev<00:02:42.160> it<00:02:42.310> up<00:02:42.400> and<00:02:42.580> watch<00:02:42.670> the<00:02:42.820> tachometer<00:02:43.090> and

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
rev it up and watch the tachometer and

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.720 
rev it up and watch the tachometer and
get<00:02:43.720> the<00:02:43.870> speed<00:02:44.140> to<00:02:44.650> be<00:02:44.770> about<00:02:45.130> the<00:02:45.460> same<00:02:45.670> as

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
get the speed to be about the same as

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.600 
get the speed to be about the same as
you<00:02:46.480> would<00:02:46.630> think<00:02:46.750> it<00:02:46.930> should<00:02:47.140> be<00:02:47.460> when<00:02:48.460> you're

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
you would think it should be when you're

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:50.220 
you would think it should be when you're
shifting<00:02:48.730> into<00:02:49.090> that<00:02:49.210> gear<00:02:49.390> cheap-ass<00:02:49.720> Ford

possible<00:04:36.280> so<00:04:36.699> these<00:04:37.509> are<00:04:37.690> the<00:04:37.750> clutch<00:04:37.960> plates

00:04:38.249 --> 00:04:38.259 
possible so these are the clutch plates

00:04:38.259 --> 00:04:39.870 
possible so these are the clutch plates
this<00:04:38.410> there's<00:04:38.650> a<00:04:38.710> steel<00:04:39.070> plate<00:04:39.310> and<00:04:39.580> then

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:39.880 
this there's a steel plate and then

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.129 
this there's a steel plate and then
there's<00:04:40.090> a<00:04:40.150> friction<00:04:40.570> plate<00:04:40.750> so<00:04:40.870> you<00:04:40.930> can<00:04:41.020> see

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:41.139 
there's a friction plate so you can see

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:42.570 
there's a friction plate so you can see
the<00:04:41.229> friction<00:04:41.560> plate<00:04:41.710> has<00:04:41.889> this<00:04:42.130> frictional

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:42.580 
the friction plate has this frictional

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.670 
the friction plate has this frictional
material<00:04:43.030> on<00:04:43.150> it<00:04:43.270> and<00:04:43.419> one<00:04:44.020> sides<00:04:44.289> connected

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:44.680 
material on it and one sides connected

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:45.870 
material on it and one sides connected
to<00:04:44.770> the<00:04:44.830> engine<00:04:45.099> the<00:04:45.220> other<00:04:45.340> side's<00:04:45.520> connected

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:45.880 
to the engine the other side's connected

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:47.670 
to the engine the other side's connected
to<00:04:45.970> the<00:04:46.090> transmission<00:04:46.479> and<00:04:46.750> there<00:04:47.560> are

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 
to the transmission and there are

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.830 
to the transmission and there are
Springs<00:04:48.070> that<00:04:48.550> make<00:04:48.729> them<00:04:48.849> go<00:04:49.000> together<00:04:49.150> when

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:49.840 
Springs that make them go together when

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.180 
Springs that make them go together when
you<00:04:49.930> step<00:04:50.110> on<00:04:50.229> the<00:04:50.349> clutch<00:04:50.470> you<00:04:50.590> can<00:04:50.889> press<00:04:51.039> the

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:51.190 
you step on the clutch you can press the

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:54.240 
you step on the clutch you can press the
springs<00:04:51.780> remove<00:04:52.780> the<00:04:52.990> two<00:04:53.169> from<00:04:53.919> touching

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:54.250 
springs remove the two from touching

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:55.890 
springs remove the two from touching
each<00:04:54.370> other<00:04:54.580> and<00:04:54.820> then<00:04:55.090> one<00:04:55.599> of<00:04:55.720> them<00:04:55.810> will

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:55.900 
each other and then one of them will

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:56.969 
each other and then one of them will
spend<00:04:56.139> the<00:04:56.229> engine<00:04:56.500> side<00:04:56.680> and<00:04:56.919> the

00:04:56.969 --> 00:04:56.979 
spend the engine side and the

00:04:56.979 --> 00:04:59.159 
spend the engine side and the
transmission<00:04:57.580> side<00:04:57.880> won't<00:04:58.570> be<00:04:58.720> able<00:04:58.840> to<00:04:58.930> touch

00:04:59.159 --> 00:04:59.169 
transmission side won't be able to touch

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:00.390 
transmission side won't be able to touch
this<00:04:59.410> and<00:04:59.680> then<00:04:59.770> when<00:04:59.889> you<00:04:59.949> let<00:05:00.070> off<00:05:00.220> on<00:05:00.250> the

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:00.400 
this and then when you let off on the

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.550 
this and then when you let off on the
clutch<00:05:00.639> they<00:05:01.120> slam<00:05:01.360> together<00:05:01.570> this<00:05:02.139> friction

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:02.560 
clutch they slam together this friction

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.589 
clutch they slam together this friction
material<00:05:02.919> sticks<00:05:03.220> to<00:05:03.370> the<00:05:03.460> metal<00:05:03.639> and<00:05:03.910> then

00:05:04.589 --> 00:05:04.599 
material sticks to the metal and then

00:05:04.599 --> 00:05:05.939 
material sticks to the metal and then
your<00:05:04.810> engine<00:05:05.080> is<00:05:05.199> connected<00:05:05.470> to<00:05:05.710> your

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:05.949 
your engine is connected to your

00:05:05.949 --> 00:05:08.129 
your engine is connected to your
transmission<00:05:06.490> so<00:05:06.910> when<00:05:07.750> you're<00:05:07.840> out<00:05:07.960> here

00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:08.139 
transmission so when you're out here

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:09.510 
transmission so when you're out here
you're<00:05:08.320> okay<00:05:08.650> and<00:05:08.979> when<00:05:09.070> you're<00:05:09.190> here<00:05:09.370> you're

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:09.520 
you're okay and when you're here you're

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.310 
you're okay and when you're here you're
okay<00:05:09.849> but<00:05:10.030> in<00:05:10.210> between<00:05:10.690> when<00:05:10.960> you're<00:05:11.050> shifting

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:11.320 
okay but in between when you're shifting

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:12.810 
okay but in between when you're shifting
gears<00:05:11.590> this<00:05:12.159> is<00:05:12.370> going<00:05:12.490> to<00:05:12.550> one<00:05:12.639> of<00:05:12.729> those

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:12.820 
gears this is going to one of those

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:14.189 
gears this is going to one of those
going<00:05:12.909> to<00:05:13.000> be<00:05:13.090> moving<00:05:13.510> faster<00:05:13.840> than<00:05:13.870> the<00:05:13.990> other

00:05:14.189 --> 00:05:14.199 
going to be moving faster than the other

00:05:14.199 --> 00:05:15.300 
going to be moving faster than the other
and<00:05:14.260> they're<00:05:14.409> going<00:05:14.530> to<00:05:14.590> rub<00:05:14.740> down<00:05:14.979> and<00:05:15.190> that's

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:15.310 
and they're going to rub down and that's

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:17.070 
and they're going to rub down and that's
what<00:05:15.460> wears<00:05:15.639> out<00:05:15.789> your<00:05:15.970> clutch<00:05:16.270> so<00:05:16.900> when

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:17.080 
what wears out your clutch so when

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:18.210 
what wears out your clutch so when
you're<00:05:17.289> when<00:05:17.560> you're<00:05:17.590> in<00:05:17.770> that's<00:05:17.889> called<00:05:18.130> the

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:18.220 
you're when you're in that's called the

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:19.680 
you're when you're in that's called the
friction<00:05:18.370> zone<00:05:18.580> so<00:05:18.880> we're<00:05:19.030> in<00:05:19.270> the<00:05:19.360> friction

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:19.690 
friction zone so we're in the friction

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:20.640 
friction zone so we're in the friction
zone<00:05:19.720> you<00:05:19.930> want<00:05:20.050> to<00:05:20.110> be<00:05:20.169> as<00:05:20.260> gentle<00:05:20.440> as

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:20.650 
zone you want to be as gentle as

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:22.409 
zone you want to be as gentle as
possible<00:05:20.710> and<00:05:21.340> do<00:05:21.669> as<00:05:21.760> little<00:05:21.880> damage<00:05:22.000> as

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:22.419 
possible and do as little damage as

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:24.930 
possible and do as little damage as
possible
