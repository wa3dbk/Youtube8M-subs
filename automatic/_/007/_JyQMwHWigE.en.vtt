00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.250
 ajaxfans older than 30 years boots stefan 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.230
 pettersson of course no introduction 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.120
 but for the youngsters among us the 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.139
 swede played in the late 80s and early eighties 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.060
 90 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.060
 among 97 matches for ajax 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.330
 last week the former soccer player was briefly 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.860
 back councilors from a visit to the 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.930
 future of which there are many 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:37.650
 former teammates are now employed 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:40.980
 it's nice still a lot of people 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:46.170
 against whom I played football together or 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:48.780
 cooperated another way here an atmosphere 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:53.040
 is always very nice 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:55.650
 so I peterson who have been around for quite some time 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:58.290
 live in sweden follows as tip for 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:00.420
 ajax and player's new supervisor 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:01.380
 method of youth training at the 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.900
 future 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:05.550
 it is sure to speak about that 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:09.619
 do not know of course not everything exactly 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:12.600
 how it works but it is only 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:13.649
 look at the to the results that are 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.630
 just very well 

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:19.100
 and also how they reach the youth 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.399
 get started with the individual 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:25.880
 training or divide that man that 

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:28.100
 that she looks overpriced in the first 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:31.220
 instance later they will of course be 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:34.369
 good football players if they can 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:37.039
 to give everything to one 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:41.329
 become a professional footballer and that willy likes 

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:42.100
 and I just think it's a very good way 

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:43.810
 is 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.340
 ajax bad in the training again 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:47.740
 some time emphasis on development 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.600
 of the individual and that begins 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.400
 gradually also abroad 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.930
 fall as pettersson sees in the 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:56.200
 football world 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:02:01.960
 it does live with some clips 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:04.420
 more and some less and but yes we 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:08.679
 are not as far as in the Netherlands 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:10.830
 or certainly not if but yes x 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:13.209
 For example, men is currently 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.680
 are doing very well 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:18.680
 not just because they are champions 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:21.019
 is performed shampoo sleeve plays well 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.689
 the youth the courses 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:26.569
 goes well there are a few more clips that 

00:02:23.689 --> 00:02:29.299
 the it does reasonable but about it 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:32.359
 generally we have to do much more in sweden 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:35.750
 give attention to the way in which the 

00:02:32.359 --> 00:02:37.819
 work is being done in the Netherlands and Ajax 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.040
 my opinion 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:41.930
 Ajax training club was among the fans 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.909
 very popular pettersson 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.269
 twice Dutch champion and won once 

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:48.980
 the NFL cup and of course the Uefa cup 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:50.989
 was not a pronounced smet and suggested 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.359
 also that the society he scored 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:56.139
 almost 200 extra matches a hundred times 

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:56.139
 for the Amsterdammers 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:02.780
 the room and the poles 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.780
 do you have to
