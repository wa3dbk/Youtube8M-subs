 the silvas reinforcements and or the winter 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.959
 I remember a pleasure to talk with you 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.510
 Brazilian chat and that's always going to 

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:17.070
 generate an expectation and we talk about it 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:20.220
 a few moments before starting 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.660
 formally with the talk sometimes as 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.220
 turns football not those two 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.699
 goals that you put to the team in 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.769
 tijuana and how are you leaving a mark and 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.410
 the managers never forget 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.700
 true who makes them and at the time 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.130
 Now step was accomplished in 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.730
 querÃ©taro and you come to tijuana what is the 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.250
 goal to goal 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:42.860
 the same as all the equipment that arrives 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:45.460
 already practicing with the directive and with 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:48.710
 coaching staff all want to qualify 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:51.320
 re-qualify then when 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:55.280
 it was working and step by step game to 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:57.410
 I play there to win and bring everyone here 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.910
 missing an important point again 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.519
 always and for any player is 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:03.589

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:05.089
 be outside we know about your conditions 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:06.740
 Yesterday you did not speak at the conference 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:09.470
 little bit that you like to be extra 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:12.530
 post attend of course finish as 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.280
 you are off the court as you live 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.740
 a normal day 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.360
 national ricard I am I am very 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:21.800
 family i am very calm always 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:25.610
 it was always like that from single and now 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:27.920
 who is already seven years old and with one 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.720
 girl I like very much I stay at home and 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.570
 play with my girl practice with my 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.460
 wife later likes to know where 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:37.190
 you live then 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.900
 He likes to travel and walk a lot 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:41.210
 then I am always accompanying 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:43.640
 she but I am very calm very 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:45.850
 family i like more of sally house a 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.909
 little talking about her 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:52.110
 situation that I knew from far away 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:54.729
 tijuana you have that same distance 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:58.570
 natural travel three hours that is a 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:02:00.880
 please somehow how do you perceive that 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:02.590
 in general the challenge of tijuana 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.780
 football for you what it is that 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.399
 you knew apart from those two goals 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.050
 social something that you feel that you 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:10.940
 arrive an ideal moment of your career 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:13.730
 yes I already feel like yes why 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:17.060
 tijuana since we played there against 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.890
 and since I was here with querÃ©taro I 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:22.430
 I saw that it is an institution a very 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:24.290
 great then and very serious then the 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:28.520
 team that all players always know 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:30.110
 play and I feel that the best came 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.300
 moment of my career here to be able 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:35.390
 help the team achieve great things 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.810
 a theme with Brazilian football always 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.750
 is 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:44.670
 who was that player to follow who was 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:47.400
 that Brazilian element to which we can 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:50.390
 say that you followed your face or why 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.390
 be forward always 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:57.680
 ronaldo of the other Christian ronaldo 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:09.030
 but this for me is definitely a 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:11.640
 little of what you think is fundamental 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.870
 for a team to have this success three 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.150
 of the last four tournaments this 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.920
 team has not qualified despite that 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.720
 very good start franchise where you had 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.220
 a title concachampions liberators 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.410
 but in three of the last four 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.330
 tournaments have failed to qualify that 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:28.010
 it is key to remember a team to be able 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:28.010
 have consistent results 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:34.600
 team union set so 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:37.900
 players has been helping within 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:41.740
 the court and outside having the support of 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:43.530
 the board of the coaching staff like me 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:46.120
 I've seen here that we have a lot then 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:49.000
 with this union that we have on the court 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:51.430
 and outside also this support from outside 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.770
 I think we have great chances of 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:57.100
 rate a topic that is important in 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:04:00.190
 he for any scorer is golf and 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:01.750
 but nobody really know more 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:04.200
 that we are close to the team and we charge 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:06.569
 for many years as a press 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:10.140
 then we can play place in the 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:14.069
 street but never what does it mean 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:16.290
 feel like scoring a goal for you or for me 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:19.109
 as I think that for all 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:22.049
 people of the world soccer is indeed 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:24.720
 of golf is what brings you joy what 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:28.139
 what brings you happiness is then for 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:31.340
 me the best moment of a game of a 

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:33.600
 training where the avid footballer 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:36.000
 football that when you score a goal 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:37.740
 finally more to reaffirm what is 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.560
 It is a little bit of your competition 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:43.320
 presentation when saying I like to play 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:45.120
 posts where you like said obviously 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.950
 technician because he will tell you he wants some 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:49.229
 private things and that you can add us 

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:52.590
 a little bit where do you think you can perform 

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:54.690
 more for solos to miami as I told him 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:57.650
 friend playing many post areas there 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:05:00.139
 but when I arrive in QuerÃ©taro 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:01.880
 I had to play a little differently for the 

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:04.430
 mobility shift also had to 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:06.949
 move a little more I could not stay 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:09.669
 and so much time stopped the sport 

00:05:06.949 --> 00:05:12.410
 then it came out a little more and here what 

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:15.470
 I can help as how he had 

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:17.479
 what he asks me for second sport 

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:20.180
 Front can help as you need 

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:22.430
 finally the subject of a number of goals 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:24.740
 is you setting yourself that goal or in this case 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:27.620
 it's not what you like to do better 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:28.669
 come alone or if you say you have 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:32.440
 a mentality 

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:32.440
 I have a particular goal 

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:37.290
 for me every year I have to do 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:39.870
 like 20 goals in the two tournaments by 

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:42.270
 say yes in the year in the year that has been 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:46.620
 sighted that is what I have to 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:48.450
 do but I like more this goal 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:50.130
 leave there behind and help the 

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:52.890
 colleagues how can I help 

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:54.540

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:56.550

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:03.710

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:03.710

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:09.570
