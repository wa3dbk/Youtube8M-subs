I<00:03:32.349> think<00:03:33.349> competition<00:03:33.650> is<00:03:34.120> the<00:03:35.120> best<00:03:35.540> aspects

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
I think competition is the best aspects

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:37.530 
I think competition is the best aspects
of<00:03:36.020> sports<00:03:36.349> brings<00:03:36.830> out<00:03:37.040> the<00:03:37.099> best<00:03:37.250> in<00:03:37.400> people

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
of sports brings out the best in people

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.260 
of sports brings out the best in people
sometimes<00:03:38.540> a<00:03:38.630> worse<00:03:38.780> as<00:03:38.989> well<00:03:39.200> but<00:03:39.410> I<00:03:40.239> try<00:03:41.239> to

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:41.270 
sometimes a worse as well but I try to

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:43.720 
sometimes a worse as well but I try to
focus<00:03:41.450> on<00:03:41.750> the<00:03:42.170> positives<00:03:42.650> of<00:03:42.739> it<00:03:42.890> I<00:03:43.190> think

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730 
focus on the positives of it I think

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:46.449 
focus on the positives of it I think
it's<00:03:43.940> a<00:03:44.120> competition<00:03:44.569> really<00:03:45.050> it<00:03:45.620> allows<00:03:46.280> you

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:46.459 
it's a competition really it allows you

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:48.760 
it's a competition really it allows you
to<00:03:46.550> be<00:03:46.670> who<00:03:46.790> you<00:03:46.819> are<00:03:47.620> something<00:03:48.620> like<00:03:48.739> that
