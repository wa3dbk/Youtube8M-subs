00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
and let's see that in landscape mode

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:14.979 
and let's see that in landscape mode
let's<00:04:12.769> get<00:04:12.920> moda<00:04:13.189> the<00:04:13.700> keys<00:04:13.939> are<00:04:14.150> way<00:04:14.450> bigger

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:14.989 
let's get moda the keys are way bigger

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:17.710 
let's get moda the keys are way bigger
than<00:04:15.170> in<00:04:15.590> portrait<00:04:16.190> mode<00:04:16.220> as<00:04:16.789> a<00:04:17.299> matter<00:04:17.600> of

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:17.720 
than in portrait mode as a matter of

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.110 
than in portrait mode as a matter of
fact<00:04:17.780> in<00:04:18.169> portrait<00:04:18.590> mode<00:04:18.620> is<00:04:19.009> quite<00:04:19.370> it's<00:04:19.910> a

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.120 
fact in portrait mode is quite it's a

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.939 
fact in portrait mode is quite it's a
little<00:04:20.329> bit<00:04:20.419> too<00:04:20.600> narrow<00:04:20.870> and<00:04:21.289> you<00:04:21.620> can't

00:04:21.939 --> 00:04:21.949 
little bit too narrow and you can't

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:24.249 
little bit too narrow and you can't
really<00:04:22.250> use<00:04:22.520> it<00:04:22.759> well<00:04:23.150> I<00:04:23.330> don't<00:04:23.479> know<00:04:23.780> maybe<00:04:24.020> in

00:04:24.249 --> 00:04:24.259 
really use it well I don't know maybe in

00:04:24.259 --> 00:04:25.930 
really use it well I don't know maybe in
the<00:04:24.380> future<00:04:24.560> and<00:04:24.949> in<00:04:25.130> landscape<00:04:25.550> mode<00:04:25.580> is

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:25.940 
the future and in landscape mode is

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:28.749 
the future and in landscape mode is
nearly<00:04:26.210> perfect<00:04:26.900> the<00:04:27.020> keys<00:04:27.229> are<00:04:27.410> big<00:04:27.710> you<00:04:28.520> can

00:04:28.749 --> 00:04:28.759 
nearly perfect the keys are big you can

00:04:28.759 --> 00:04:31.719 
nearly perfect the keys are big you can
use<00:04:29.090> it<00:04:29.120> really<00:04:29.960> nicely<00:04:30.410> but<00:04:31.070> there's<00:04:31.430> no<00:04:31.669> you
