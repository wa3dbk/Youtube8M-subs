scalloped potatoes and then probably

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.130

something like that

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:02.289 
something like that
well<00:01:59.939> we<00:02:00.090> got<00:02:00.270> the<00:02:00.420> rocket<00:02:00.990> stove<00:02:01.170> out<00:02:01.350> and<00:02:01.770> hot

we're<00:02:03.299> going<00:02:03.420> to<00:02:03.479> do<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:03.630> whole<00:02:03.780> thing

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
we're going to do the whole thing

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.300

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.270 
kitchen
and<00:02:05.850> it<00:02:06.030> looks<00:02:06.210> like<00:02:06.329> it<00:02:06.450> may<00:02:06.570> start<00:02:06.840> to<00:02:06.990> rain
