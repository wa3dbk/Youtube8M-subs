of<00:02:12.060> the<00:02:12.360> motif<00:02:12.750> just

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
of the motif just

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.820 
of the motif just
like<00:02:13.560> a<00:02:13.590> classical<00:02:14.190> composer<00:02:14.520> but<00:02:15.030> it<00:02:15.240> it<00:02:15.390> uh

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
like a classical composer but it it uh

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.640 
like a classical composer but it it uh
but<00:02:16.830> it<00:02:17.010> uh<00:02:17.420> you<00:02:18.420> know<00:02:18.540> what's<00:02:18.840> once<00:02:19.200> you<00:02:19.410> have

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
but it uh you know what's once you have

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.570 
but it uh you know what's once you have
your<00:02:19.980> your<00:02:20.940> motif<00:02:21.330> done<00:02:22.040> there's<00:02:23.040> a<00:02:23.130> very<00:02:23.430> real

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
your your motif done there's a very real

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.550 
your your motif done there's a very real
sense<00:02:23.880> in<00:02:24.150> which<00:02:24.330> the<00:02:24.630> symphony<00:02:25.140> is<00:02:25.170> finished

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
sense in which the symphony is finished

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.530 
sense in which the symphony is finished
you<00:02:26.550> know<00:02:26.670> it's<00:02:26.790> just<00:02:26.880> a<00:02:27.030> matter<00:02:27.240> of<00:02:27.360> you<00:02:27.510> know

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
you know it's just a matter of you know

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.680 
you know it's just a matter of you know
details<00:02:28.220> like<00:02:29.220> you<00:02:29.640> know<00:02:29.700> orchestration<00:02:30.390> and

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
details like you know orchestration and

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.080 
details like you know orchestration and
the<00:02:31.170> intersections<00:02:31.830> and<00:02:32.040> all<00:02:32.190> of<00:02:32.310> that<00:02:32.340> but

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
the intersections and all of that but

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.690 
the intersections and all of that but
but<00:02:33.870> a<00:02:33.930> classical<00:02:34.440> composer<00:02:34.740> has<00:02:35.160> this<00:02:35.430> whole

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
but a classical composer has this whole

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.070 
but a classical composer has this whole
sense<00:02:36.300> of<00:02:37.130> of<00:02:38.130> what<00:02:39.000> it<00:02:39.120> is<00:02:39.150> to<00:02:39.600> develop<00:02:39.990> a

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
sense of of what it is to develop a

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.590 
sense of of what it is to develop a
motif<00:02:40.440> techniques<00:02:41.280> for<00:02:41.520> motivic<00:02:42.000> development

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
motif techniques for motivic development

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.100 
motif techniques for motivic development
ah<00:02:42.780> here's<00:02:43.410> one<00:02:43.500> repetition<00:02:44.480> okay<00:02:45.510> butter<00:02:45.840> it

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
ah here's one repetition okay butter it

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.860 
ah here's one repetition okay butter it
uh<00:02:46.580> okay<00:02:47.580> now<00:02:47.760> we'll<00:02:47.970> repeat<00:02:48.300> it<00:02:48.360> but<00:02:48.660> we'll

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
uh okay now we'll repeat it but we'll

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.300 
uh okay now we'll repeat it but we'll
repeat<00:02:49.170> it<00:02:49.350> with<00:02:49.530> different<00:02:49.860> notes<00:02:49.950> same

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
repeat it with different notes same

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.170 
repeat it with different notes same
rhythm<00:02:50.640> bah<00:02:50.910> dah<00:02:50.970> dah<00:02:51.450> okay<00:02:51.780> so<00:02:52.200> there<00:02:52.530> we<00:02:52.560> are

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
rhythm bah dah dah okay so there we are

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.780 
rhythm bah dah dah okay so there we are
now<00:02:54.180> let's<00:02:54.480> see<00:02:54.660> repeat<00:02:55.500> but<00:02:55.800> repeat<00:02:56.190> faster

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
now let's see repeat but repeat faster

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.110 
now let's see repeat but repeat faster
butter<00:02:57.420> it<00:02:57.660> uh<00:02:57.739> butter<00:02:58.739> that<00:02:58.950> butter<00:02:59.400> it<00:02:59.970> up

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
butter it uh butter that butter it up

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.970 
butter it uh butter that butter it up
but<00:03:00.300> added<00:03:00.570> that<00:03:00.600> but<00:03:00.870> out<00:03:00.989> of<00:03:01.020> that<00:03:01.170> but<00:03:01.860> at<00:03:01.950> a

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
but added that but out of that but at a

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.100 
but added that but out of that but at a
definite<00:03:02.520> button<00:03:02.970> so<00:03:03.150> there<00:03:03.330> we<00:03:03.420> go<00:03:03.450> faster

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
definite button so there we go faster

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.260 
definite button so there we go faster
and<00:03:04.320> at<00:03:05.190> some<00:03:05.430> point<00:03:05.670> there's<00:03:05.850> going<00:03:05.910> to<00:03:06.120> be<00:03:06.180> a

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270 
and at some point there's going to be a

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.390 
and at some point there's going to be a
secondary<00:03:06.720> motif<00:03:07.170> coming<00:03:07.560> in<00:03:07.709> and<00:03:07.890> guess

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
secondary motif coming in and guess

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:09.530 
secondary motif coming in and guess
where<00:03:08.580> that's<00:03:08.790> going<00:03:09.030> to<00:03:09.090> be<00:03:09.209> that's<00:03:09.330> going<00:03:09.480> to

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
where that's going to be that's going to

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.120 
where that's going to be that's going to
be<00:03:09.600> the<00:03:09.690> primary<00:03:09.870> motif<00:03:10.440> of<00:03:10.560> the<00:03:10.620> second

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
be the primary motif of the second

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.770 
be the primary motif of the second
movement<00:03:11.880> etc<00:03:12.890> and<00:03:13.890> so<00:03:14.340> taking<00:03:15.300> that<00:03:15.570> whole

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
movement etc and so taking that whole

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.259 
movement etc and so taking that whole
concept<00:03:16.440> of<00:03:16.650> motivic<00:03:17.459> development<00:03:18.120> and

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
concept of motivic development and

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:21.620 
concept of motivic development and
applying<00:03:18.900> it<00:03:19.080> to<00:03:19.140> a<00:03:19.290> title<00:03:19.680> and<00:03:20.450> let's<00:03:21.450> say

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
applying it to a title and let's say

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:27.800 
applying it to a title and let's say
your<00:03:21.750> title<00:03:22.110> is<00:03:22.850> I<00:03:23.850> don't<00:03:24.330> know<00:03:26.600> losing<00:03:27.600> your

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
your title is I don't know losing your

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.680 
your title is I don't know losing your
love<00:03:28.170> again<00:03:28.380> oh<00:03:28.890> great<00:03:29.340> that's<00:03:29.549> again<00:03:30.090> go

uh but it a dot that duh that's the

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.160 
uh but it a dot that duh that's the

something<00:04:09.209> it<00:04:09.269> really<00:04:09.329> feels<00:04:09.750> right<00:04:09.989> and<00:04:10.290> once

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
something it really feels right and once

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.460 
something it really feels right and once
you<00:04:11.340> have<00:04:11.519> that<00:04:11.760> then<00:04:12.660> you<00:04:12.720> say<00:04:12.930> all<00:04:13.110> right<00:04:13.230> now
