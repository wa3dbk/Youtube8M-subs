Jovi with you give love a bad name I
hope<00:00:34.340> I'm<00:00:34.489> not<00:00:34.519> mistaken<00:00:35.000> on<00:00:35.180> this<00:00:35.329> tuning

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:35.660 
hope I'm not mistaken on this tuning

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:37.030 
hope I'm not mistaken on this tuning
here<00:00:35.780> I<00:00:35.840> think<00:00:36.140> they're<00:00:36.260> tuned<00:00:36.440> to<00:00:36.590> half<00:00:36.769> step

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:37.040 
here I think they're tuned to half step

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.229 
here I think they're tuned to half step
down<00:00:37.070> which<00:00:37.519> is<00:00:37.670> flat<00:00:38.769> like<00:00:39.769> 75%<00:00:40.370> sure<00:00:40.909> I

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:41.239 
down which is flat like 75% sure I

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:43.270 
down which is flat like 75% sure I
should<00:00:41.839> go<00:00:41.930> double<00:00:42.260> check<00:00:42.290> real<00:00:42.650> quick<00:00:42.680> but

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:43.280 
should go double check real quick but

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.369 
should go double check real quick but
I'm<00:00:43.370> gonna<00:00:43.460> roll<00:00:43.850> with<00:00:43.940> my<00:00:44.120> instincts<00:00:44.600> if<00:00:45.230> I

00:00:45.369 --> 00:00:45.379 
I'm gonna roll with my instincts if I

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:48.660 
I'm gonna roll with my instincts if I
mocked<00:00:45.650> you<00:00:45.800> we<00:00:45.920> just<00:00:46.070> move<00:00:46.280> this<00:00:46.460> a<00:00:46.809> half<00:00:47.809> step

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:48.670 
mocked you we just move this a half step

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:49.840 
mocked you we just move this a half step
okay

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
okay

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.950 
okay
so<00:00:50.659> tune<00:00:51.440> flat<00:00:51.739> half<00:00:51.980> step<00:00:52.010> down<00:00:52.360> and<00:00:53.360> I'm<00:00:53.869> not

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:53.960 
so tune flat half step down and I'm not

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.240
