 the nb30 effect it behaves two channels that shares all the settings 

00:00:25.309 --> 00:00:26.060
 is 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.899
 a good 

00:00:26.899 --> 00:00:30.149
 a three-band EQ a reserve 

00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:32.050
 a volume 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.500
 a section he does and as for a master in volume 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:38.570

 an input to plug a mp3 player a headphone output that also 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.560

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:54.730
 first two 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:57.750
 to select the mode in which works 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.160
 everyone read the first channel can work either in kline mode or in 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.880
 slice mode 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:09.250

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.250
 robin wright 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:14.370
 for the other two 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:18.660
 the first is a tap tempo which will serve for example to adjust the time of 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:19.640

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.250
 your settings on each 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:26.610
 channel 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.380
