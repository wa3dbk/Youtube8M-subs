00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
that at all about this product and

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.580 
that at all about this product and
putting<00:01:06.119> it<00:01:06.240> on<00:01:06.390> wasn't<00:01:06.930> exactly<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.470> easiest

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
putting it on wasn't exactly the easiest

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.700 
putting it on wasn't exactly the easiest
thing<00:01:07.979> to<00:01:08.250> do<00:01:08.400> either<00:01:08.900> it<00:01:09.900> you'd<00:01:10.380> think<00:01:10.530> it'd

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
thing to do either it you'd think it'd

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.649 
thing to do either it you'd think it'd
go<00:01:10.860> on<00:01:11.040> like<00:01:11.250> a<00:01:11.280> normal<00:01:11.670> lotion<00:01:12.000> which<00:01:12.479> would

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
go on like a normal lotion which would

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.450 
go on like a normal lotion which would
be<00:01:12.780> easy<00:01:12.990> but<00:01:13.170> this<00:01:13.530> does<00:01:13.830> take<00:01:14.130> a<00:01:14.159> while<00:01:14.280> to

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
be easy but this does take a while to

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.210 
be easy but this does take a while to
absorb<00:01:15.119> into<00:01:15.390> your<00:01:15.509> skin<00:01:15.659> so<00:01:16.140> I<00:01:16.560> was<00:01:16.830> standing

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
absorb into your skin so I was standing

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.859 
absorb into your skin so I was standing
there<00:01:17.250> rubbing<00:01:17.670> it<00:01:17.790> in<00:01:17.909> for<00:01:18.180> quite<00:01:18.600> a<00:01:18.689> few

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
there rubbing it in for quite a few

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.660 
there rubbing it in for quite a few
minutes<00:01:19.020> maybe<00:01:19.350> five<00:01:19.650> to<00:01:19.799> ten<00:01:20.009> it<00:01:20.159> was<00:01:20.310> white

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
minutes maybe five to ten it was white

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.020 
minutes maybe five to ten it was white
until<00:01:21.240> it<00:01:21.420> finally<00:01:21.630> dissolved<00:01:22.200> into<00:01:22.320> my<00:01:22.560> skin

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
until it finally dissolved into my skin

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.880 
until it finally dissolved into my skin
so<00:01:24.030> it<00:01:24.270> did<00:01:24.450> take<00:01:24.479> a<00:01:24.720> while<00:01:24.840> to<00:01:25.049> absorb<00:01:25.710> into

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
so it did take a while to absorb into

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.350 
so it did take a while to absorb into
your<00:01:26.009> skin<00:01:26.130> which<00:01:26.520> I<00:01:26.670> thought<00:01:26.820> was<00:01:27.030> a<00:01:27.060> little

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
your skin which I thought was a little

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.800 
your skin which I thought was a little
annoying<00:01:28.430> the<00:01:29.430> drying<00:01:29.729> time<00:01:29.970> was<00:01:30.180> an<00:01:30.299> average

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
annoying the drying time was an average

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.330 
annoying the drying time was an average
of<00:01:31.020> maybe<00:01:31.290> a<00:01:31.380> little<00:01:31.530> more<00:01:31.740> than<00:01:31.860> average<00:01:32.189> it

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
of maybe a little more than average it

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.280 
of maybe a little more than average it
did<00:01:32.460> take<00:01:32.670> about<00:01:32.790> 30<00:01:33.180> to<00:01:33.360> 40<00:01:33.659> minutes<00:01:33.689> total

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
did take about 30 to 40 minutes total

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.990 
did take about 30 to 40 minutes total
till<00:01:34.860> it<00:01:34.979> you<00:01:35.220> couldn't<00:01:35.400> feel<00:01:35.640> it<00:01:35.790> on<00:01:35.880> your

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
till it you couldn't feel it on your

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.870 
till it you couldn't feel it on your
skin<00:01:36.270> at<00:01:36.390> all<00:01:36.590> but<00:01:37.590> putting<00:01:37.799> it<00:01:37.979> on<00:01:38.159> isn't<00:01:38.700> very

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
skin at all but putting it on isn't very

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.760 
skin at all but putting it on isn't very
