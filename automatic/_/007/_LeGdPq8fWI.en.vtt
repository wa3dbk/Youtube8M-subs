00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
disheartening happened this card just

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.060 
disheartening happened this card just
stopped<00:00:30.630> working<00:00:30.779> all<00:00:31.230> of<00:00:31.349> a<00:00:31.439> sudden<00:00:32.360> it<00:00:33.360> uh

stopped working all of a sudden it uh

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.069 
stopped working all of a sudden it uh
like<00:00:35.070> i<00:00:35.250> I<00:00:35.550> swapped<00:00:36.059> cases<00:00:36.480> I<00:00:36.600> booted<00:00:36.870> the

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
like i I swapped cases I booted the

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.959 
like i I swapped cases I booted the
computer<00:00:37.500> up<00:00:37.649> and<00:00:38.899> there<00:00:39.899> was<00:00:40.020> a<00:00:40.640> nothing<00:00:41.640> in

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
computer up and there was a nothing in

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.700 
computer up and there was a nothing in
the<00:00:42.300> output<00:00:42.809> section<00:00:43.290> at<00:00:43.440> all

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
the output section at all

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.150 
the output section at all
nothing<00:00:44.270> so<00:00:45.270> I<00:00:45.809> went<00:00:46.620> to<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.829> device<00:00:47.129> manager

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
nothing so I went to the device manager

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.979 
nothing so I went to the device manager
to<00:00:47.730> see<00:00:47.910> what<00:00:48.090> had<00:00:48.180> happened<00:00:48.570> to<00:00:48.629> me<00:00:48.719> I<00:00:48.750> mean<00:00:48.930> I

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
to see what had happened to me I mean I

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.840 
to see what had happened to me I mean I
thought<00:00:49.469> maybe<00:00:49.710> a<00:00:49.829> driver<00:00:50.100> screwed<00:00:50.489> up<00:00:50.640> and

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
thought maybe a driver screwed up and

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.299 
thought maybe a driver screwed up and
sure<00:00:51.539> enough<00:00:51.570> there<00:00:52.050> was<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.199> it<00:00:52.590> sees<00:00:53.129> the

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
sure enough there was the it sees the

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.360 
sure enough there was the it sees the
SONA<00:00:53.520> zone<00:00:54.059> RDG<00:00:54.539> card<00:00:54.780> there<00:00:55.020> but<00:00:56.010> it<00:00:56.100> has<00:00:56.219> an

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
SONA zone RDG card there but it has an

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.979 
SONA zone RDG card there but it has an
exclamation<00:00:56.670> point<00:00:59.270> which<00:01:00.270> indicates<00:01:00.719> a

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
exclamation point which indicates a

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.660 
exclamation point which indicates a
problem<00:01:01.410> of<00:01:01.710> some<00:01:01.859> kind<00:01:01.890> so<00:01:02.219> I<00:01:02.280> thought<00:01:02.489> maybe

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
problem of some kind so I thought maybe

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.609 
problem of some kind so I thought maybe
the<00:01:02.850> driver<00:01:03.120> just<00:01:03.510> somehow<00:01:03.960> screwed<00:01:04.320> itself

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
the driver just somehow screwed itself

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.050 
the driver just somehow screwed itself
up<00:01:04.799> from<00:01:04.920> some<00:01:05.189> stupid<00:01:05.460> bug

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.719 

so<00:01:09.060> I<00:01:09.090> reinstalled<00:01:09.840> so<00:01:09.990> I<00:01:10.020> messed<00:01:10.290> around<00:01:10.409> with

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:10.729 
so I reinstalled so I messed around with

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:14.719 
so I reinstalled so I messed around with
drivers<00:01:11.729> new<00:01:11.970> and<00:01:12.150> old<00:01:12.330> and<00:01:12.630> it<00:01:13.080> didn't<00:01:13.619> fix<00:01:13.799> it

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
drivers new and old and it didn't fix it

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.910 
drivers new and old and it didn't fix it
I<00:01:14.810> received<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:15.930> card<00:01:16.140> a<00:01:16.290> couple<00:01:16.560> times<00:01:16.710> I

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
I received the card a couple times I

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.660 
I received the card a couple times I
didn't<00:01:17.159> work<00:01:17.390> I<00:01:18.979> pulled<00:01:19.979> out<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.250> HD<00:01:20.549> audio

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
didn't work I pulled out the HD audio

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.520 
didn't work I pulled out the HD audio
cable<00:01:21.180> from<00:01:21.330> there<00:01:21.570> and<00:01:21.780> that<00:01:21.810> didn't<00:01:22.290> really

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
cable from there and that didn't really

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.570 
cable from there and that didn't really
do<00:01:22.979> anything<00:01:24.470> so<00:01:25.470> I<00:01:25.500> figured<00:01:25.830> maybe<00:01:25.979> my<00:01:26.189> PCI

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
do anything so I figured maybe my PCI

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.200 
do anything so I figured maybe my PCI
slots<00:01:26.939> dead<00:01:27.210> and<00:01:28.189> it's<00:01:29.189> not<00:01:29.430> now<00:01:29.970> I<00:01:30.000> can

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
slots dead and it's not now I can

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.170 
slots dead and it's not now I can
confirm<00:01:30.509> that<00:01:30.570> that<00:01:30.750> PCI<00:01:31.140> slot<00:01:31.409> it's<00:01:31.500> fine

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180 
confirm that that PCI slot it's fine

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.969 
confirm that that PCI slot it's fine
it's<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.360> card<00:01:33.600> because<00:01:34.049> I<00:01:34.290> took<00:01:34.350> it<00:01:34.530> and<00:01:34.829> put

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
it's the card because I took it and put

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.380 
it's the card because I took it and put
it<00:01:35.070> in<00:01:35.159> my<00:01:35.280> land<00:01:35.490> party<00:01:35.790> machine<00:01:36.060> over<00:01:36.240> there

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
it in my land party machine over there

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.260 
it in my land party machine over there
to<00:01:36.479> test<00:01:36.689> it<00:01:36.900> and<00:01:37.430> I<00:01:38.430> tested<00:01:38.670> it<00:01:38.850> with<00:01:38.939> Linux

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
to test it and I tested it with Linux

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.200 
to test it and I tested it with Linux
which<00:01:39.780> has<00:01:39.990> seen<00:01:40.229> this<00:01:40.409> card<00:01:40.680> in<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:40.890> past<00:01:41.210> and

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
which has seen this card in the past and

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.469 
which has seen this card in the past and
Linux<00:01:42.930> saw<00:01:43.110> nothing<00:01:43.439> mmm<00:01:44.310> again<00:01:44.850> again<00:01:45.299> the

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
Linux saw nothing mmm again again the

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.179 
Linux saw nothing mmm again again the
same<00:01:45.689> symptoms<00:01:46.170> there's<00:01:46.380> just<00:01:46.799> nothing<00:01:47.100> in

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
same symptoms there's just nothing in

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.039 
same symptoms there's just nothing in
the<00:01:47.310> nothing<00:01:47.759> listed<00:01:47.970> in<00:01:48.210> the<00:01:48.299> outputs<00:01:48.689> for<00:01:48.899> it

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
the nothing listed in the outputs for it

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.880 
the nothing listed in the outputs for it
so<00:01:49.799> I<00:01:50.369> didn't<00:01:51.149> check<00:01:51.299> LS<00:01:51.570> PCI<00:01:51.930> but<00:01:52.320> I<00:01:52.350> assume<00:01:52.740> it

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
so I didn't check LS PCI but I assume it

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.380 
so I didn't check LS PCI but I assume it
probably<00:01:53.280> sees<00:01:53.549> it<00:01:53.729> but<00:01:53.880> just<00:01:54.000> can't<00:01:54.240> do

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
probably sees it but just can't do

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.789 
probably sees it but just can't do
anything<00:01:54.570> with<00:01:54.810> it<00:01:54.840> just<00:01:55.079> like<00:01:55.290> Windows<00:01:55.470> did

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
anything with it just like Windows did

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:00.679 
anything with it just like Windows did
on<00:01:55.890> the<00:01:55.979> other<00:01:56.130> machine<00:01:58.250> but<00:01:59.250> yeah<00:01:59.509> this<00:02:00.509> car

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
on the other machine but yeah this car

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.810 
on the other machine but yeah this car
just<00:02:00.750> went<00:02:01.110> toe<00:02:01.500> up<00:02:01.619> and<00:02:01.770> died<00:02:01.920> randomly<00:02:02.670> one

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
just went toe up and died randomly one

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.850 
just went toe up and died randomly one
day<00:02:03.030> this<00:02:03.810> isn't<00:02:04.049> the<00:02:04.140> first<00:02:04.259> time<00:02:04.530> I've<00:02:04.710> seen

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
day this isn't the first time I've seen
