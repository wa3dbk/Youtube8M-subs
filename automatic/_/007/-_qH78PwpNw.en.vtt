 and yes you allowed yourself to his death 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.939
 a lot of time that you 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.830
 say we're fed up with gameplay at w 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.840
 xy has too much on the chain etc has you 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.489
 listened for all information bo3 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.960
 you go from blackhawk two ps is 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.250
 in logic but not for everything 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.600
 the world since apparently you 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.820

 since soon will offer you 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.660
 of the modern warfare 3 of the black ops one of the 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.640
 ghost in reasonable quantity anyway 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.680
 and today for example modern 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.270
 warfare 2 comes back to seniority at 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.640
 back to the grassroots people for a 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.289
 nuclear double enough express one can 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.570
 to say it realized by rage life luc on 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.640
 import us to two modern warfare 2 a 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.180
 little I will be happy and a little 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.190
 comment 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.439
 2 congratulations to mister life him who 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.810
 makes his first run on rabies 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.150
 with this double nuclear on modern 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.340
 warfare 2 today we will talk about 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.810
 best asset of black ops will be in all 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.720
 case what seems to be the best 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.790
 asset of the game them in any case two the 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.250
 class iii it's sure of category 3 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.600
 assets is absolutely safe then 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.759
 what assets is it about it well he 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.830
 this is 6th cough without trial 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.600
 sixth sense of course as you the 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.670
 know all I think have dedicated 100 ch 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.619
 these animals normally constituted the 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.299
 shock for him gives back a sixth that is 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.610
 to always fall back on his paws and 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.560
 well in ghost it was a dog game 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.939
 blackhawks time 3 it will be a game of 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.490
 chat since we will have the possibility 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:43.649
 to embody a character with six years 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.790
 thanks to this asset then no it will not be 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.899
 not an asset that would allow us to 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.280
 find on our feet of course 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.899
 since we will not have a boss will not have 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.790
 what will not launch cats but we 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.860
 will have the sixth sense which will be to spot 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.970
 the nearby enemies I explain to you 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.619
 in fact it will be a little bit like the 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.380
 portable radars of modern warfare 3 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.909
 but directly integrate order your 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.740
 player is not a little pleasure 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.030
 to give you that, of course, heavy with 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.890
 enemy detection will not be 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.840
 extremely large extremely 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.580
 far to wear but now it's done 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.950
 always happy to have a little speed camera 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.480
 portable directly in oneself to make 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.790
 detect the enemies as I'm going to you 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.370
 to show on these small screens small 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.440
 video 2 team art in our clearly sees 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.660
 almost like the oracle of call of duty 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.310
 go this and then on the mini map too we 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.780
 drink also leave especially it's this 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.360
 that will have to look is the minimap 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.530
 especially to affect the enemies 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.180
 since the arrows for downright 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.000
 indicated the enemies as on the 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.620
 position here he killed him so that's it 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.870
 clearly comparing with others 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.820
 assets of this class iii with 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.430
 engineers that allows you to detect 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:44.010
 all the devices on the floor and that's 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:46.350
 dead silence a dead silence that 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.060
 sometimes useful it's true we were looking for 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:51.630
 instruction especially and it's at 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:54.060
 wellness it will be complications to be 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.739
 useful in film less than our 6th 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.540
 meaning to the tactical masked body 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:59.489
 frankly in the iii we did not see 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.080
 the youtuber used a lot of pomegranate 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:01.739
 Active croo not know if it will be 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.010
 really useful 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:07.680
 gao that will allow you to deploy 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:10.230
 your weapons your grenades etc while 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.150
 sprinting and sliding and so that's it 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.400
 the sixth sense I think in this 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.989
 category will do it anyway the best 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.820
 of the game and I think we will all be 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:19.590
 okay on it this video 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:21.030
 ends a little welcome message 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.440
 of congratulations to the city in the 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.579
 comments do not forget your objects 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.870
 but I wish you a good day 

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:26.430
 a good night a good appetite 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:30.110
 I will tell you very soon about the 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.110
 orange noodle to apply them
