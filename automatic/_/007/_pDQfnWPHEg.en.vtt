 greet you dear viewers on 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.609
 channel with the world in fact in this issue we 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.310
 talk about the most disgusting in appearance 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.199
 their creatures are actually very many 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.330
 especially in the deep sea 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:29.150
 but I chose 4 in my opinion very 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.150
 interesting specimens so go 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:36.989
 European angler fish which is outwardly 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.510
 very unattractive so its still 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.120
 called monkfish but it is edible 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.309
 white meat, boneless 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.010
 Monkfish is especially popular in 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:50.730
 france body length up to two meters 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:53.280
 often from a meter to a half maximum 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.160
 body weight about 50 8 kilograms 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:59.760
 the head of the monkfish is very big and 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:02.550
 It occupies two thirds of the entire body that's just 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.680
 huge with lots of teeth waiting 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.680
 prey of the monkfish lies on the bottom and 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.110
 becomes absolutely still he even 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.630
 hold your breath taking breaths through 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.820
 one or two minutes and only bait on 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.470
 the end of its process of the rod lightly 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.570
 trembling luring fish 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.270
 worth fish and some other 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.729
 animal approach bait like 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:27.299
 huge maw the devil is revealed and here 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.829
 also closes again absorbing the victim 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.270
 movements are made with such 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.700
 lightning fast 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.950
 that the replacement is simply impossible to keep track of 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.990
 Voracious predator large numbers 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.920
 absorbs bottom fish large 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.920
 invertebrate animals 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:49.870
 purple or purple frog 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:52.659
 the mole earrings amphibians virtually all 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:55.150
 time she spends the ranges and 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:59.710
 the habitat is very small of only 14 square 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:02:01.390
 kilometers of western huts it all 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.150
 led to the fact that the official opening 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:07.210
 and the description of the purple frog happened 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:08.229
 only in the thousand and third year the topic is not 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.840
 new frogs 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:13.209
 has a rounded shape for what it seems 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.920
 be on too thick head 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:17.320
 opposite it is unusually small 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:20.650
 pointed muzzle region tip 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:22.840
 tiny nose small round eyes 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.780
 with horizontal pupils practically 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.380
 blind but with charm she has everything in 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.600
 okay 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:31.030
 it is with his help she finds 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:33.850
 food pushing a narrow face into 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:36.850
 mink insects and pulling them out 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:38.980
 long fluted tongue tiny mouth 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:41.410
 prevents the underground frog by swallowing 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:44.519
 large creatures therefore it feeds 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:48.160
 termites are not from ants key words 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:50.680
 she lives very deep underground from 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:53.320
 one meter 30 centimeters to three 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:56.230
 meters 70 centimeters as he likes 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:59.019
 wet environment and out only in 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:01.200
 breeding time so its so hard 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:01.200
 meet 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:14.540
 fish toad is an unpleasant nickname 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:17.480
 she got for her disgusting look 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:19.310
 the fish have no scales but the whole body 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:22.180
 covered with growths and littered with many 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:24.350
 crush their thorns another similarity 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:27.260
 fish habit sells to amphibians 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:30.260
 buried with soft and sheets or sandy 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:32.420
 the bottom of the fish toad leaves 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:35.330
 only their eyes are set high on 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:36.230
 head because the fish lives on dirty 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:38.900
 and forest 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:41.030
 sandy bottom such camouflage is good 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:44.270
 masks fish toad posing as 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:46.850
 detect small fish covering 

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:50.510
 the fish is attacked by a lightning jump 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:53.600
 her shelter took her by surprise just 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:54.950
 poison fish toad to 40 centimeters and a large 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.930
 head part 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:59.810
 which has huge proportions by 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:02.720
 compared to the body and and the mouth opens 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:05.270
 very wide that allows you to swallow 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:08.480
 quite large fish fish very 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:10.430
 unpretentious and omnivorous in the absence of 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:12.590
 enough main 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:15.550
 food rations do not disdain and 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:15.550
 plant food 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:22.640
 I will tell you about osram nasty 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:24.890
 being from our list by sight she 

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:26.240
 very nasty but they say it tastes 

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:29.620
 very nothing 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.620
 so here it is 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:37.940
 This fish penis I think it is not difficult to guess 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:40.370
 why does he have such a name 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:42.080
 In fact, this is not a fish species. 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:44.620
 no sea worms 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:47.180
 common name other than Latin 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:50.090
 therefore, it is popularly called 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:52.760
 fish tennis they grow to 30 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:55.760
 centimeters long and 3 4 centimeters in 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:58.130
 the width of these worms is usually consumed in 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:00.770
 raw food in Japan with various 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:03.560
 seasoning china they are fried with vegetables 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:09.170
 or placed in powder used in 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:11.410
 quality seasoning on this all thanks
