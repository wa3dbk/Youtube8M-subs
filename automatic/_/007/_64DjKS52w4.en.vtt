00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
fair play tone but I'm when I think

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.569 
fair play tone but I'm when I think
about<00:02:36.900> I'd<00:02:37.230> probably<00:02:37.470> not<00:02:37.829> have<00:02:38.040> him<00:02:38.159> back<00:02:38.370> at

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:38.579 
about I'd probably not have him back at

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:41.420 
about I'd probably not have him back at
all<00:02:38.790> then<00:02:39.269> they'll<00:02:40.230> see<00:02:40.409> him<00:02:40.590> every<00:02:40.920> second

enjoying<00:03:01.769> the<00:03:02.069> few<00:03:02.340> between<00:03:02.730> them<00:03:02.909> two<00:03:03.090> guys

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
enjoying the few between them two guys

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:04.580 
enjoying the few between them two guys
at<00:03:03.510> the<00:03:03.540> moment<00:03:03.930> I<00:03:03.989> think<00:03:04.049> they<00:03:04.319> can<00:03:04.470> do

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
at the moment I think they can do

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.210 
at the moment I think they can do
extremely<00:03:05.159> thick<00:03:05.760> way<00:03:06.390> bear<00:03:06.659> and<00:03:06.959> then<00:03:07.920> the

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
extremely thick way bear and then the

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.099 
extremely thick way bear and then the
way<00:03:08.370> the<00:03:08.549> only<00:03:09.359> thing<00:03:09.510> is<00:03:09.540> they're<00:03:09.780> false

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:10.109 
way the only thing is they're false

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:12.589 
way the only thing is they're false
really<00:03:10.560> i<00:03:10.590> think<00:03:10.709> it's<00:03:10.950> w.e<00:03:11.640> creias<00:03:12.329> fault

00:03:12.589 --> 00:03:12.599 
really i think it's w.e creias fault

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:14.869 
really i think it's w.e creias fault
they<00:03:13.290> could<00:03:13.349> do<00:03:13.560> so<00:03:13.890> much<00:03:14.099> better<00:03:14.159> and<00:03:14.670> the<00:03:14.760> way

00:03:14.869 --> 00:03:14.879 
they could do so much better and the way

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:17.030 
they could do so much better and the way
they<00:03:15.060> actually<00:03:15.420> put<00:03:15.959> the<00:03:16.079> show<00:03:16.290> together<00:03:16.500> and

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
they actually put the show together and

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.640 
they actually put the show together and
try<00:03:17.849> to<00:03:17.910> build<00:03:18.209> this<00:03:18.419> field<00:03:18.750> off<00:03:18.959> so<00:03:19.349> they<00:03:19.500> can
