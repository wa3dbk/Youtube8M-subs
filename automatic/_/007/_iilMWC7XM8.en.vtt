breather<00:00:27.199> thing<00:00:28.199> on<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.470> top<00:00:28.650> of<00:00:28.710> it<00:00:28.890> I

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
breather thing on the top of it I

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.620 
breather thing on the top of it I
thought<00:00:29.250> oh<00:00:29.310> I<00:00:29.429> don't<00:00:29.699> care<00:00:29.820> much<00:00:29.970> for<00:00:30.029> that<00:00:30.330> so

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
thought oh I don't care much for that so

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.709 
thought oh I don't care much for that so
I<00:00:30.900> went<00:00:31.199> out<00:00:31.320> in<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.439> Jeep<00:00:31.650> I<00:00:31.830> found<00:00:32.009> this<00:00:32.189> old

00:00:32.709 --> 00:00:32.719 
I went out in the Jeep I found this old

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:36.950 
I went out in the Jeep I found this old
aluminum<00:00:33.800> ring<00:00:34.800> that<00:00:35.219> I<00:00:35.250> had<00:00:35.370> found<00:00:35.780> in<00:00:36.780> the

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
aluminum ring that I had found in the

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.360 
aluminum ring that I had found in the
scrap<00:00:37.230> pile<00:00:37.500> a<00:00:37.530> while<00:00:37.829> back<00:00:38.010> and<00:00:38.129> I<00:00:38.190> thought

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
scrap pile a while back and I thought

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.709 
scrap pile a while back and I thought
right<00:00:38.489> looks<00:00:38.670> a<00:00:38.760> little<00:00:38.910> better<00:00:39.120> and<00:00:39.540> then

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
right looks a little better and then

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.690 
right looks a little better and then
I've<00:00:39.840> tried<00:00:40.079> various<00:00:40.440> things<00:00:40.739> on<00:00:40.920> top<00:00:41.100> of<00:00:41.280> it<00:00:41.430> I

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
I've tried various things on top of it I

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.639 
I've tried various things on top of it I
looked<00:00:42.329> over<00:00:42.450> on<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.780> wall<00:00:42.960> over<00:00:42.989> there<00:00:43.320> and<00:00:43.590> I

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
looked over on the wall over there and I

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:44.990 
looked over on the wall over there and I
had<00:00:43.829> a<00:00:43.860> flywheel<00:00:44.340> that<00:00:44.610> came<00:00:44.789> off<00:00:44.820> that

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
had a flywheel that came off that

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.850 
had a flywheel that came off that
dynaflow<00:00:45.570> transmission<00:00:46.350> and<00:00:46.500> I<00:00:46.530> thought<00:00:46.710> that

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
dynaflow transmission and I thought that

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.190 
dynaflow transmission and I thought that
looks<00:00:47.160> that<00:00:47.430> looks<00:00:48.120> kind<00:00:48.510> of<00:00:48.629> cool<00:00:48.780> ish<00:00:48.989> i

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
looks that looks kind of cool ish i

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.740 
looks that looks kind of cool ish i
guess<00:00:49.489> so<00:00:50.489> i<00:00:50.550> put<00:00:50.730> it<00:00:50.820> on<00:00:50.940> there<00:00:51.210> now<00:00:51.360> i<00:00:51.570> took

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
guess so i put it on there now i took

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.069 
guess so i put it on there now i took
the<00:00:52.579> hubcap<00:00:53.579> i<00:00:53.820> mean<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.270> top<00:00:54.750> of<00:00:54.989> the

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
the hubcap i mean the the top of the

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.660 
the hubcap i mean the the top of the
breather<00:00:55.350> that<00:00:55.500> was<00:00:55.800> on<00:00:55.949> that<00:00:56.100> small<00:00:56.250> bridge

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
breather that was on that small bridge

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.369 
breather that was on that small bridge
and<00:00:56.850> i<00:00:56.910> just<00:00:57.090> set<00:00:57.300> it<00:00:57.329> on<00:00:57.480> there<00:00:57.719> this

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
and i just set it on there this

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.950 
and i just set it on there this
breathers<00:00:58.859> actually<00:00:59.219> bolted<00:00:59.460> down<00:00:59.930> before<00:01:00.930> it

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
breathers actually bolted down before it

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.959 
breathers actually bolted down before it
gets<00:01:01.260> to<00:01:01.469> this<00:01:01.649> and<00:01:01.980> this<00:01:02.039> is<00:01:02.250> just<00:01:02.399> actual

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
gets to this and this is just actual

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.780 
gets to this and this is just actual
weight<00:01:03.480> on<00:01:04.409> top<00:01:04.470> of<00:01:04.949> it<00:01:05.040> of<00:01:05.129> course<00:01:05.159> I<00:01:05.489> decided

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
weight on top of it of course I decided

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.490 
weight on top of it of course I decided
drag<00:01:06.090> race<00:01:06.299> I<00:01:06.450> can<00:01:06.570> always<00:01:06.659> take<00:01:06.900> it<00:01:06.960> off<00:01:07.170> lose

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.109 
drag race I can always take it off lose
a<00:01:07.530> little<00:01:07.740> weight<00:01:07.860> that's<00:01:08.610> kind<00:01:08.760> of<00:01:08.880> a<00:01:08.939> joke

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
a little weight that's kind of a joke

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.880 
a little weight that's kind of a joke
but<00:01:11.030> yeah<00:01:12.030> so<00:01:12.450> anyway<00:01:12.750> it's<00:01:12.930> on<00:01:13.049> there<00:01:13.260> I<00:01:13.409> think

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
but yeah so anyway it's on there I think

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.850 
but yeah so anyway it's on there I think
I<00:01:14.070> will<00:01:14.189> I<00:01:15.170> think<00:01:16.170> I'll<00:01:16.290> take<00:01:16.470> her<00:01:16.619> for<00:01:16.770> a<00:01:16.830> ride

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.980 
I will I think I'll take her for a ride
I<00:01:17.009> gas<00:01:17.640> while<00:01:17.850> ago<00:01:18.030> she's<00:01:18.240> a<00:01:18.270> little<00:01:18.479> low<00:01:18.689> so<00:01:18.720> I

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
think I'll take her out the gas station

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.670 
think I'll take her out the gas station
and<00:01:20.509> shoot<00:01:21.509> little<00:01:21.750> gassed<00:01:21.960> and<00:01:22.170> just<00:01:22.470> drive

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
and shoot little gassed and just drive

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.920 
and shoot little gassed and just drive
it<00:01:22.740> a<00:01:22.860> little<00:01:22.950> bit<00:01:23.130> with<00:01:23.310> money<00:01:23.930> flamethrower

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
it a little bit with money flamethrower

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.170 
it a little bit with money flamethrower
coil<00:01:25.320> in<00:01:25.710> place<00:01:26.040> and<00:01:26.430> would<00:01:26.729> you<00:01:26.880> see<00:01:27.030> how

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
coil in place and would you see how

00:01:27.180 --> 00:05:07.440 
coil in place and would you see how
everything<00:01:27.479> goes

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:07.450 

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:11.800 

well<00:05:08.450> the<00:05:08.540> car<00:05:08.720> ran<00:05:08.930> better<00:05:09.200> than<00:05:09.350> ever<00:05:09.650> i<00:05:10.810> know

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:11.810 
well the car ran better than ever i know

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:13.900 
well the car ran better than ever i know
i<00:05:12.260> think<00:05:12.380> the<00:05:12.710> breather<00:05:12.950> probably<00:05:13.640> didn't

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:13.910 
i think the breather probably didn't

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:16.750 
i think the breather probably didn't
hurt<00:05:14.030> none<00:05:14.300> but<00:05:14.510> i<00:05:14.570> think<00:05:14.780> the<00:05:15.490> like<00:05:16.490> a<00:05:16.520> lot<00:05:16.730> of

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:16.760 
hurt none but i think the like a lot of

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:18.670 
hurt none but i think the like a lot of

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:26.750 
that much better because i run it with

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:31.030 
that much better because i run it with
no<00:05:26.870> breather<00:05:27.110> at<00:05:27.320> all<00:05:28.810> but<00:05:29.810> you<00:05:30.440> know<00:05:30.590> the
