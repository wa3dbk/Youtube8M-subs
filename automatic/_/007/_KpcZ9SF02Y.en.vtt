00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.520 
the moon so I don't need to rename that
but<00:03:41.370> what's<00:03:41.550> this<00:03:41.670> first<00:03:41.970> layer<00:03:42.230> this<00:03:43.230> is<00:03:43.380> our

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
but what's this first layer this is our

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.620 
but what's this first layer this is our
composition<00:03:44.310> that<00:03:44.340> we<00:03:44.520> first<00:03:44.730> made<00:03:45.030> what<00:03:45.510> we

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
composition that we first made what we

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.720 
composition that we first made what we
no<00:03:45.750> longer<00:03:45.780> need<00:03:46.260> that<00:03:46.560> so<00:03:47.250> I'm<00:03:47.310> going<00:03:47.550> to<00:03:47.610> go

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
no longer need that so I'm going to go

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.420 
no longer need that so I'm going to go
ahead<00:03:47.760> and<00:03:48.239> delete<00:03:48.390> this<00:03:48.750> one<00:03:48.959> oops<00:03:49.830> got<00:03:50.310> to

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
ahead and delete this one oops got to

will make this box which is easier to
work<00:04:18.120> with<00:04:18.180> with<00:04:18.930> signatures<00:04:20.239> now<00:04:21.239> when<00:04:21.390> you

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419 
work with with signatures now when you

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:23.090 
work with with signatures now when you
make<00:04:21.750> an<00:04:21.870> animation<00:04:22.229> frame<00:04:22.650> and<00:04:22.800> have<00:04:22.979> it

make an animation frame and have it

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.250 
make an animation frame and have it
activated<00:04:23.280> down<00:04:23.880> here<00:04:24.150> in<00:04:24.240> the<00:04:24.390> animation

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:28.830 
this is going to be where the product

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:31.640 
this is going to be where the product
will<00:04:28.950> end<00:04:29.190> out<00:04:29.370> bad<00:04:29.930> now<00:04:30.930> since<00:04:31.200> we're<00:04:31.410> making

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650 
will end out bad now since we're making

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:33.290 
will end out bad now since we're making
this<00:04:31.740> an<00:04:31.860> animation<00:04:32.040> what<00:04:32.790> we're<00:04:32.940> going<00:04:33.060> to<00:04:33.180> do

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 
this an animation what we're going to do

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.210 
this an animation what we're going to do
is<00:04:33.450> move<00:04:33.600> everything<00:04:33.930> off<00:04:34.200> screen<00:04:34.650> and<00:04:34.890> have

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.220 
is move everything off screen and have

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.430 
is move everything off screen and have
it<00:04:35.310> move<00:04:35.490> onto<00:04:35.760> the<00:04:36.120> screen<00:04:36.330> so<00:04:37.080> first<00:04:37.290> I'll

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 
it move onto the screen so first I'll

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.560 
it move onto the screen so first I'll
start<00:04:37.530> with<00:04:37.740> the<00:04:37.860> text<00:04:38.310> will<00:04:39.090> select<00:04:39.390> that

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:39.570 
start with the text will select that

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:42.610 
start with the text will select that
layer<00:04:39.750> and<00:04:40.160> I'll<00:04:41.160> move<00:04:41.370> it<00:04:41.490> just<00:04:41.760> off-screen

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:42.620 
layer and I'll move it just off-screen

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:44.660 
layer and I'll move it just off-screen
then<00:04:43.620> I'll<00:04:43.710> come<00:04:43.830> down<00:04:43.890> and<00:04:44.280> select<00:04:44.430> the

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:44.670 
then I'll come down and select the

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:47.480 
then I'll come down and select the
background<00:04:44.880> layer<00:04:45.270> and<00:04:45.710> move<00:04:46.710> that<00:04:46.920> so<00:04:47.280> we<00:04:47.370> can

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.490 
background layer and move that so we can

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:50.720 
background layer and move that so we can
watch<00:04:47.670> the<00:04:47.700> moon<00:04:48.210> rise<00:04:48.950> that<00:04:49.950> looks<00:04:50.250> good<00:04:50.460> and

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:50.730 
watch the moon rise that looks good and

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:52.910 
watch the moon rise that looks good and
now<00:04:51.660> what<00:04:51.840> we're<00:04:51.990> going<00:04:52.140> to<00:04:52.290> do<00:04:52.440> is<00:04:52.710> we're

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:52.920 
now what we're going to do is we're

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:54.860 
now what we're going to do is we're
going<00:04:53.040> to<00:04:53.100> come<00:04:53.280> down<00:04:53.430> here<00:04:53.460> and<00:04:53.820> create<00:04:54.780> a<00:04:54.840> new

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:54.870 
going to come down here and create a new

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:58.520 
going to come down here and create a new
frame<00:04:55.650> layer<00:04:56.840> now<00:04:57.840> we're<00:04:58.020> only<00:04:58.170> going<00:04:58.350> to<00:04:58.440> have

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:58.530 
frame layer now we're only going to have

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:00.110 
frame layer now we're only going to have
to<00:04:58.650> work<00:04:58.770> with<00:04:58.920> these<00:04:59.070> two<00:04:59.400> because<00:04:59.970> of<00:05:00.000> a

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 
to work with these two because of a

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.330 
to work with these two because of a
special<00:05:00.330> feature<00:05:00.750> called<00:05:01.110> tweens<00:05:01.590> which<00:05:02.220> I

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:02.340 
special feature called tweens which I

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:04.550 
special feature called tweens which I
will<00:05:02.490> show<00:05:02.520> you<00:05:02.700> in<00:05:02.880> a<00:05:02.970> moment<00:05:03.140> so<00:05:04.140> let's<00:05:04.440> go

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.560 
will show you in a moment so let's go

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.400 
will show you in a moment so let's go
ahead<00:05:04.590> and<00:05:05.030> move<00:05:06.030> the<00:05:06.240> moon<00:05:06.420> up<00:05:06.600> to<00:05:06.840> where<00:05:07.110> we

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:07.410 
ahead and move the moon up to where we

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:12.080 
ahead and move the moon up to where we
want<00:05:07.620> its<00:05:07.740> final<00:05:07.800> place<00:05:08.400> to<00:05:08.670> be<00:05:10.880> that<00:05:11.880> looks

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.090 
want its final place to be that looks

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:14.420 
want its final place to be that looks
good<00:05:12.330> and<00:05:13.140> we'll<00:05:13.320> go<00:05:13.410> back<00:05:13.620> and<00:05:13.860> move<00:05:14.010> the<00:05:14.190> text

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:14.430 
good and we'll go back and move the text

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:16.280 
good and we'll go back and move the text
over<00:05:14.820> to<00:05:14.970> where<00:05:15.120> we<00:05:15.270> want<00:05:15.480> its<00:05:15.600> final<00:05:15.660> place<00:05:16.110> to

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:16.290 
over to where we want its final place to

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:20.510 
over to where we want its final place to
be<00:05:16.440> also<00:05:16.620> and<00:05:17.540> that<00:05:18.540> looks<00:05:18.690> great<00:05:18.960> there<00:05:19.520> now

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:20.520 
be also and that looks great there now

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.700 
be also and that looks great there now
what<00:05:20.700> we<00:05:20.820> can<00:05:20.970> do<00:05:21.150> is<00:05:21.720> hold<00:05:22.350> down<00:05:22.410> the<00:05:22.680> shift

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:22.710 
what we can do is hold down the shift

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:25.720 
what we can do is hold down the shift
key<00:05:23.070> and<00:05:23.460> select<00:05:24.150> both<00:05:24.330> of<00:05:24.540> these<00:05:24.630> animations

key and select both of these animations

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:28.730 
key and select both of these animations
we<00:05:26.730> go<00:05:26.850> down<00:05:27.030> and<00:05:27.210> hit<00:05:27.300> the<00:05:27.420> tweens<00:05:27.750> or<00:05:28.080> the

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:28.740 
we go down and hit the tweens or the

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:33.200 
we go down and hit the tweens or the

it's going to take or how long each
frame<00:05:57.480> will<00:05:57.690> be<00:05:57.870> up<00:05:58.370> 0<00:05:59.370> or<00:05:59.700> no<00:06:00.210> delay<00:06:00.570> is<00:06:00.840> great

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:01.200 
frame will be up 0 or no delay is great

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:03.170 
frame will be up 0 or no delay is great
because<00:06:01.680> it<00:06:01.860> makes<00:06:01.980> very<00:06:02.190> smooth<00:06:02.580> animation

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:20.100 
first keyframe and we're going to watch

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:22.630 
first keyframe and we're going to watch
this<00:06:20.400> now<00:06:21.360> make<00:06:21.570> sure<00:06:21.720> that<00:06:21.870> you<00:06:21.930> have<00:06:22.110> forever

12 pauses there and then starts again I
think<00:06:35.729> that<00:06:35.850> looks<00:06:36.060> pretty<00:06:36.240> good<00:06:36.479> so<00:06:36.750> now
