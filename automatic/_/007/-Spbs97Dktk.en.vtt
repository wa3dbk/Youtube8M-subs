just to ensure everything comes out okay
all<00:01:04.210> right<00:01:04.360> so<00:01:04.869> the<00:01:05.350> butter<00:01:05.619> is<00:01:05.829> very

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:05.950 
all right so the butter is very

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:07.380 
all right so the butter is very
important<00:01:06.670> the<00:01:06.790> butter<00:01:07.030> is<00:01:07.210> at<00:01:07.360> room

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:07.390 
important the butter is at room

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.270 
important the butter is at room
temperature<00:01:08.020> this<00:01:08.200> is<00:01:08.259> almost<00:01:08.680> melting

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.280 
temperature this is almost melting

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:10.590 
temperature this is almost melting
because<00:01:09.520> it<00:01:09.640> is<00:01:09.759> kind<00:01:09.970> of<00:01:10.000> hot<00:01:10.210> in<00:01:10.329> here<00:01:10.479> with

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:10.600 
because it is kind of hot in here with

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.330 
because it is kind of hot in here with
all<00:01:10.630> the<00:01:10.869> lights<00:01:11.049> it's<00:01:11.710> very<00:01:11.920> important

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.340 
all the lights it's very important

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.999 
all the lights it's very important
otherwise<00:01:12.549> it<00:01:12.729> won't<00:01:12.970> incorporate<00:01:13.750> well<00:01:14.020> with

00:01:14.999 --> 00:01:15.009 
otherwise it won't incorporate well with

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:18.209 
otherwise it won't incorporate well with
the<00:01:15.909> sugar<00:01:16.210> and<00:01:16.479> to<00:01:17.140> that<00:01:17.380> you're<00:01:18.039> going<00:01:18.159> to

00:01:18.209 --> 00:01:18.219 
the sugar and to that you're going to

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:20.760 
the sugar and to that you're going to
add<00:01:18.340> both<00:01:18.609> sugars<00:01:18.909> the<00:01:19.149> brown<00:01:19.359> sugar<00:01:19.689> and<00:01:19.990> the

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:20.770 
add both sugars the brown sugar and the

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:22.410 
add both sugars the brown sugar and the
granulated<00:01:21.249> sugar<00:01:21.280> I'm<00:01:21.909> actually<00:01:22.090> just<00:01:22.270> going

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
granulated sugar I'm actually just going

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.840 
granulated sugar I'm actually just going
to<00:01:22.479> switch<00:01:22.719> to<00:01:22.749> my<00:01:22.929> whisk<00:01:23.259> and<00:01:23.619> just<00:01:24.579> cream

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850 
to switch to my whisk and just cream

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.959 
to switch to my whisk and just cream
this<00:01:24.999> together<00:01:25.210> that<00:01:26.369> looks<00:01:27.369> perfect<00:01:27.579> now

00:01:27.959 --> 00:01:27.969 
this together that looks perfect now

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:30.209 
this together that looks perfect now
before<00:01:28.569> I<00:01:28.600> go<00:01:28.749> any<00:01:28.780> further<00:01:29.049> with<00:01:29.530> that<00:01:29.560> I'm

00:01:30.209 --> 00:01:30.219 
before I go any further with that I'm

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:32.069 
before I go any further with that I'm
going<00:01:30.670> to<00:01:30.729> take<00:01:30.880> my<00:01:31.060> chocolate<00:01:31.450> chips<00:01:31.659> and<00:01:31.929> I'm

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:32.079 
going to take my chocolate chips and I'm

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:33.919 
going to take my chocolate chips and I'm
just<00:01:32.350> going<00:01:32.499> to<00:01:32.590> take<00:01:32.799> some<00:01:33.069> of<00:01:33.490> the<00:01:33.579> flour

00:01:33.919 --> 00:01:33.929 
just going to take some of the flour

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:36.599 
just going to take some of the flour
about<00:01:34.929> two<00:01:35.229> tablespoons<00:01:35.799> or<00:01:35.950> so<00:01:36.159> and<00:01:36.369> I'm<00:01:36.460> just

00:01:36.599 --> 00:01:36.609 
about two tablespoons or so and I'm just

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:38.550 
about two tablespoons or so and I'm just
going<00:01:36.729> to<00:01:36.819> mix<00:01:36.969> them<00:01:37.119> in<00:01:37.270> this<00:01:37.869> is<00:01:38.109> so<00:01:38.319> that

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
going to mix them in this is so that

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.379 
going to mix them in this is so that
once<00:01:38.950> we<00:01:39.130> coat<00:01:39.369> all<00:01:39.639> the<00:01:39.670> chocolate<00:01:40.179> chips

00:01:40.379 --> 00:01:40.389 
once we coat all the chocolate chips

00:01:40.389 --> 00:01:42.359 
once we coat all the chocolate chips
with<00:01:40.569> the<00:01:40.600> flour<00:01:40.929> it<00:01:41.469> prevents<00:01:41.950> them<00:01:42.100> for

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:42.369 
with the flour it prevents them for

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:44.129 
with the flour it prevents them for
sinking<00:01:42.729> into<00:01:42.850> the<00:01:43.299> bottom<00:01:43.539> of<00:01:43.630> the<00:01:43.689> pan<00:01:43.899> and

00:01:44.129 --> 00:01:44.139 
sinking into the bottom of the pan and

00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:46.109 
sinking into the bottom of the pan and
it<00:01:44.590> just<00:01:44.829> makes<00:01:44.950> sure<00:01:45.069> that<00:01:45.340> they're<00:01:45.459> evenly

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:46.119 
it just makes sure that they're evenly

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:48.120 
it just makes sure that they're evenly
throughout<00:01:46.509> the<00:01:46.600> batter<00:01:47.109> which<00:01:47.799> is<00:01:47.920> what<00:01:48.039> we

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
throughout the batter which is what we

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.340 
throughout the batter which is what we
want<00:01:48.369> just<00:01:48.969> stir<00:01:49.119> this<00:01:49.270> those<00:01:49.780> up<00:01:49.990> and<00:01:50.200> set

want just stir this those up and set
those<00:01:50.499> aside<00:01:50.639> to<00:01:51.639> the<00:01:51.789> remaining<00:01:52.090> flour<00:01:52.420> I'm

00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:52.719
