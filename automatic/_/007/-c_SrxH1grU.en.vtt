00:00:04.533 --> 00:00:08.533
["Astorga puffs"]

00:00:10.033 --> 00:00:12.400
Do you know the famous Astorga puffs?

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.333
I bet you do. 

00:00:13.333 --> 00:00:16.033
They are delicious and very easy to make.

00:00:16.033 --> 00:00:18.033
We will only need:

00:00:18.033 --> 00:00:23.467
A sheet of puff pastry, 2 cups of water,
26 ounces of sugar,

00:00:23.467 --> 00:00:27.867
3 Tbsp. of honey and some lemon juice.

00:00:27.867 --> 00:00:30.800
Let's start by straightening out
the puff pastry sheet.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:36.400
I use fresh puff pastry, but if you prefer,
you can use frozen puff pastry.

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:45.867
With a knife, cut the pastry into
about 1 1/2 or 2 inches rectangles.

00:00:45.867 --> 00:00:50.567
With the appropriate tool --
I will use an apple corer --

00:00:50.567 --> 00:00:54.533
remove a small circle
from the center of each rectangle.

00:00:54.533 --> 00:00:59.300
This is necessary for later on,
allowing the syrup soak in.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:04.100
Place them on the baking tray,
and use baking paper.

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:10.000
It's not necessary to leave a lot of room
between them, since they expand upwards.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.400
Place them in an oven preheated
to 375 degrees with circulating heat,

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.800
until they become golden.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.033
Carefully remove them
from the oven so they do not break,

00:01:22.033 --> 00:01:26.633
and let them cool down on a rack.

00:01:26.633 --> 00:01:30.633
In a pot, heat the 2 cups of water, 

00:01:30.633 --> 00:01:36.833
26 ounces of sugar, 3 Tbsp. of honey,
and some lemon juice.

00:01:36.833 --> 00:01:39.200
Bring it to a boil.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.300
Once it boils, leave it boiling
for about five minutes.

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:49.767
Lower the heat to the minimum setting,
and let it cool down for one minute.

00:01:49.767 --> 00:01:50.967
Start putting in the pastries.

00:01:50.967 --> 00:01:54.233
Let then cook for about 20 seconds.
Then flip them,

00:01:54.233 --> 00:01:56.833
and let them cook
for additional 20 seconds.

00:01:56.833 --> 00:02:00.167
Place them on a tray and let them cool.

00:02:00.167 --> 00:02:06.833
You can eat them once they cool,
but they are even better the next day.

00:02:06.833 --> 00:02:10.167
And here we have our delicious Astorga puff.

00:02:10.167 --> 00:02:13.100
You see how easy it is to make them
and how delicious they are.

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.733
You'll have plenty of syrup for other foods.

00:02:14.733 --> 00:02:21.300
You can keep it in the refrigerator and
use it to sweeten yogurts or other things.

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:22.533
And here we don't throw anything away.

00:02:22.533 --> 00:02:26.200
I use the same process to cook the holes
that were removed from the puff pastry.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.033
And here you have little Astorga puff balls.

00:02:29.033 --> 00:02:32.267
I hope you liked it and
I'll see you on the next video.

00:02:32.267 --> 00:02:34.267
Bye!

00:02:34.267 --> 00:02:36.633
