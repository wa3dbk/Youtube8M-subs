00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:07.960
 hello everyone with you jackson and today 

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:10.540
 there will be a comparison of two direct cars under 

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:13.240
 name e25 to jesus up to 144 both cars 

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:15.219
 is on the seventh level both are about 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.830
 from the same price category but go 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:19.990
 sleep will be a little more expensive but the principle 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:21.640
 it is framed these tanks compare no 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.169
 meaning since their characteristics are not 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.640
 absolutely different just about them to you 

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:26.349
 I'll tell you a little about yourself 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:29.499
 choose what you like more 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:30.460
 let's start with 144 this is very cool 

00:00:29.499 --> 00:00:33.730
 honest tank 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:36.399
 Personally, Iâ€™m all ordinary 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:38.739
 the game must have at least one drawback 

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:41.129
 relation to their peers my dance 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:44.350
 this fat I do not see a single flaw 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:46.590
 let's say with respect to su-152 but 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:49.989
 only that it can not be put 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:52.840
 ml20 this trunk which gives 800 damage 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:55.090
 gold here is the only drawback a 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:58.899
 everyone else in my opinion is all she has 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:01:00.190
 much better even be that fri-sau 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:02.440
 which can be pumped 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.969
 and let's look at youtube echo 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.630
 the first thing we can notice from him 

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:08.950
 standard gun d-25t with poverty 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.200
 two millimeters and on many tanks 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:14.860
 Soviet so there is let's say on classes 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:16.930
 on a variety of scales here they are 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.920
 differ only in rate of fire and 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:21.850
 time may also vary 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.870
 armor penetration but it will be no longer 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:27.880
 d-25t turns out she has a rapid-fire 75 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:30.420
 seconds and if you can download it 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:33.250
 up to 6 9 medium vaccinations 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.350
 armor penetration 175 is pretty 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.990
 little at its level is enough that 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:40.360
 punching let's say 8 seventh levels but 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.920
 9 who unfortunately throws him there 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:45.310
 already this is not enough and you have to charge 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.690
 Gold who punch and 217 217 already on 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.390
 level nine is enough for everyone 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:51.340
 average damage 390 not bad units 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.770
 considering that only 7 recharge 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.710
 seconds and information time three seconds 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:58.510
 scatter 041 she let's peak kosovato well 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.250
 as you know recently was a patch well not 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:02.650
 straight recently a couple of patches back was a patch 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.210
 in which corrected accuracy that is on 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:07.060
 all tanks are now a bit more accurate 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:08.520
 accuracy and distance more often flies in 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.629
 Centre 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.390
 next, let's look at it 

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:15.609
 booking it is pretty big in 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.430
 building c25 as you see it is much 

00:02:15.609 --> 00:02:19.189
 higher probably 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:22.099
 even three times more in terms of euro for 2 

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:24.230
 above her good frontal armor that 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:25.969
 it is not something that is not bad it just 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.430
 very rebound on eat deliver under 

00:02:25.969 --> 00:02:30.500
 good angle tadam antiki often catches 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.819
 mask bounce does not break through at all but 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.010
 rarely does kim make her way only if 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:36.920
 somebody's gold is probably ninth 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:40.730
 levels are all 7 levels most under 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.840
 corner does not pierce her forehead and already 8 9 there 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.659
 she is already suffering and anyone 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:48.109
 punching the boards in it completely cardboard 

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:50.419
 they don't make sense to talk and 

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:52.220
 it is the dynamics of the average 40 to 50 

00:02:50.419 --> 00:02:53.000
 kilometers well when as she usual in 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:57.139
 average 10 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:02.109
 35 40 kilometers only maneuverable soul 

00:02:57.139 --> 00:03:05.439
 I think better than su 122 and 152 

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:08.209
 since she is but i see none 

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:10.609
 the lack of which she stupa gums that u 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:12.500
 his gun a little different would be possible 

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:14.629
 it would here put a valid instrument 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.090
 l20 would be great at all and let's 

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:18.439
 look at e25 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:20.930
 e25 as you can see a very small tank is not 

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:23.060
 very nice with stealth he but not 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:25.579
 I know his dynamics are very maneuverable 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:28.220
 somewhere around 65 kilometers 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:31.129
 surfaces can be overclocked further 78 out 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:33.650
 slope very fast tank on it can 

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:36.459
 no problem sleep review 360 allows but 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:38.419
 since the silhouette is low so because 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:40.489
 it turns out bumps will shine 

00:03:38.419 --> 00:03:42.500
 a little hard but even that is a plus 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:45.199
 because you get a chance and will 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:47.590
 much lower due to a nice disguise 

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:50.509
 you can also use it as all 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:52.449
 they are his trunk and only 75 

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:54.889
 centimeters but he is very fast-firing 

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:57.259
 here rate of fire shot per minute 

00:03:54.889 --> 00:03:59.030
 It turns out somewhere around two mini 2 

00:03:57.259 --> 00:04:01.689
 and 3 seconds but if I bleed 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:04.689
 let's say they are now somewhere 2 7 seconds 

00:04:01.689 --> 00:04:06.680
 rate of fire so average broke through 

00:04:04.689 --> 00:04:09.109
 armor penetration she has just that 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:11.329
 I am a dozen this is very little but for the seventh 

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:13.099
 levels that throws and 8 to 9 

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:16.099
 falls since the non-penetration rate 

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:17.959
 in general, almost never offend anyone for 

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:19.940
 should be enough to charge the board unit 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:22.610
 punches but if you would not 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:25.340
 snap that is excellent subcaliber 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:26.450
 cartridges that have an orbit of 194 but 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:28.370
 really not expensive 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:29.900
 already four thousand for each cartridge 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:32.990
 who wears whole pasta at home 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:34.790
 yes average damage 135 well usually crashes 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:37.669
 about a hundred one hundred fifty how to get 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:39.020
 scatter 03 is a very precise weapon very 

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:41.120
 often hits center 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:44.900
 you can shoot literally on the go time 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:46.400
 the trial is not 15 very good performance she 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:48.770
 since so small she 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.720
 at the same time and easy also not see 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:52.490
 motor 700 installed horsepower much 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:55.130
 she is very very fast very fast 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:56.960
 accelerates very quickly raises 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:59.660
 maximum speed is very high 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:02.120
 a big plus ethane to be honest very 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:05.330
 fan I really liked but of course 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:07.370
 not everyone, he fits many then plays 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:09.410
 just to the ceiling photo of the sauna of this tank 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:11.419
 it doesn't always work that way because 

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:13.010
 very fast very dynamic on it 

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:14.810
 possible and to engage in close combat 

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:15.310
 principle not bad give me some twist 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:17.539
 of enemies 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:20.539
 tanks completely different compare them 

00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:23.539
 there is no sense but I say I would like 

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:25.910
 say tanks are worth your attention 

00:05:23.539 --> 00:05:29.300
 and first of all from which must 

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:31.460
 get off he needs more 1 probably 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:33.770
 the category that equates the tanks is 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:36.860
 rather, all the crew want to rock 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:39.080
 let's say there court 44 I have 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:42.199
 head of the crew here from 8 I swing here 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:43.099
 the crew on it on E25 I am important to the seagull 

00:05:42.199 --> 00:05:45.199
 piece 3 

00:05:43.099 --> 00:05:47.330
 consider carefully since on e25 

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:50.930
 i will let u have panthers that i have 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:53.539
 there is in the hangar but for her it turns out 

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:55.280
 crew and will not fit because there on 

00:05:53.539 --> 00:05:56.840
 one member more and you be swing 

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:59.000
 uneven crew if you will 

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:03.320
 swing not 25 for this tank crew and 

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:05.449
 this is a small minus in 

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:07.430
 principle tanks are very cool further here 

00:06:05.449 --> 00:06:09.169
 the only thing you want is an account 

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:11.659
 do on these tanks is possible 

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:14.180
 do you want to stand in the bushes let's say on 

00:06:11.659 --> 00:06:16.580
 the court until 144 wanted melee fight bring everything 

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:18.889
 not bad but if small problems with 

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:20.960
 by declining the gun or on e25 you want 

00:06:18.889 --> 00:06:23.210
 be often melee change often 

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:25.310
 position on the pc on it as you can not stand 

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:26.870
 since the building distance in principle 

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:30.080
 this tool is not particularly vilified 

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:32.060
 it is better to drive closer and just nibble 

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:35.030
 enemies i don't know tanks are very cool him 

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:36.889
 I advise both to buy me on deck for 

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:38.870
 pumping the crew and both I have not 

00:06:36.889 --> 00:06:40.719
 disappointed everyone advise and in general 

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:44.860
 you yourself already sign and bid like 

00:06:40.719 --> 00:06:44.860
 This was a comparison in general, then
