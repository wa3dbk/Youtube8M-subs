 but a nice battery life of 14 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.820
 hours even without electricity very 

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:25.859
 beautiful that nature continues to feel 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.599

 Network adapter connection of course 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:01.610

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:03.530

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:05.030
