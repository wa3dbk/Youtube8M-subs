00:00:09.959 --> 00:00:11.899
 it is time again 

00:00:11.899 --> 00:00:14.289
 however, are also in return 

00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:16.400
 I like to do this with many leaks 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.140
 when can i not find 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.619
 Year 10 is going to be crisp we have the first double 30-sided 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:26.619
 and that's something I've got 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:31.099
 I have an hour then it goes up again 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:32.310
 Prof, I knew 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:33.470
 by itself 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:34.539
 I lost 

00:00:34.539 --> 00:00:37.920
 Can not find a certain argument 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.480
 Mister quote 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.380
 if it was 4 then I wrote the comments to that 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:44.140
 Ship back 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:45.870
 I have my heart 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.440
 no idea why 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.280
 by Stephan Ohlmeier 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:50.820
 then it turns out to bring 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.170
 and 4 works 40 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.330
 he works 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:56.490
 I can 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:59.210
 the 5000 like a shield included 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:00.270
 but watch out 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.210
 the following 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:03.680
 so chose 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.990
 therefore, I notice to people that fractal starts working Chancellor 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:10.230
 Blatter Nadine Mode has always been my dream 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:13.490
 Fine Frenzy Festival 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.810
 the 3d mode yes 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.190
 Lara Sophie adrenaline will snail 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.190
 at 81 percent 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.950
 I am quite optimistic that the two had been steady then again 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.950
 to forget 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:30.870
 had here 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:34.180
 the time Voigt will be sealed with the men 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:36.350
 the lots are being sold now 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.350
 but now 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.640
 Zer and now it's his shield 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.570
 and we have his tent and we have almost won already 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.450
 We should have almost won August 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.450
 Dollar supports 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.620
 who he does not leave it like himself 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:00.620
 can be locked 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.560
 Richie Fresh questionable data 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.440
 different very different disposition 

00:02:11.859 --> 00:02:13.519
 perfect Bartek print 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:16.519
 this is what I want 

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:23.159
 He did not deduct it from me 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:29.709
 and that's why it was set 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:33.110
 It's so easy if you know how it works and you have to know how it works 

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:35.259
 this problem goes away 

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:37.060
 and now I know where the Wild Boys are 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.189
 like a snow king 

00:02:39.189 --> 00:02:42.249
 and the next man drove off 

00:02:42.249 --> 00:02:44.649
 not anymore 

00:02:44.649 --> 00:02:46.049
 Dreieich 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:48.349
 Lohr once teacher finito 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:50.749
 Gwyneth Paltrow request 

00:02:50.749 --> 00:02:53.939
 Rest will be Herbert Fandel 

00:02:53.939 --> 00:02:57.009
 and the wars of the economy 

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:59.149
 percent 

00:02:59.149 --> 00:03:02.149
 and what used singles 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:04.519
 Yes 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:07.449
 Darkness needed a runway at that time 

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:10.449
 did it thank you i should have something 

00:03:12.789 --> 00:03:14.679
 do 

00:03:14.679 --> 00:03:16.999
 the stupidity or the 8th 

00:03:16.999 --> 00:03:19.179
 but what's the hotline manages to do it 

00:03:19.179 --> 00:03:22.179
 where one provided 

00:03:42.119 --> 00:03:43.119
 Euro 

00:03:43.119 --> 00:03:46.119
 we know that Stephen 

00:03:47.189 --> 00:03:52.290
 betrayed as for the other birds and caricature with content of Atlantis 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.209
 use hate 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:57.309
 you've been loud ff 

00:03:57.309 --> 00:04:00.309
 his own goal 

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:06.389
 on 

00:04:11.169 --> 00:04:14.169
 what do you have to be in his defense 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:20.599
 you know how he wants Hefner and his story 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.560
 We now see a story of why we have peace on the ground 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:31.389
 but we 

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:34.660
 Of course not dead Lohr of course does not break why should she too 

00:04:35.499 --> 00:04:38.499
 this committee CONI problems body 

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:42.409
 okay the Wars with Greece 

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:45.749
 required time six hours and 59 seconds 

00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:47.540
 and 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:53.410
 Bocholt and 6 and 9 50 minutes and 50 seconds I would say that is long 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:57.230
 I would need seven hours almost 14 seconds but the postal service 

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:59.340
 again 8 kilos 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:02.559
 Dirk is quite clear that is now the summary 

00:05:02.559 --> 00:05:08.069
 Pioneer dive 8 collected abstract 05 2 will be occupied and by Noel Greilich 

00:05:08.069 --> 00:05:11.050
 in now I have that in the game building apart 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:15.669
 So, especially doctors have who comes with Sparrow and Greece now 

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:19.979
 Still tilted and then somehow Natter Technologies knows that 

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:24.409
 I already slowed down to be unlocked Eugen sequences us 

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:28.380
 may play the game again thank you the Vils do not want to 

00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:33.129
 if we want to be so funny music and comments but the know-how 

00:05:33.129 --> 00:05:35.849
 the synchro dumb lay often likes 

00:05:35.849 --> 00:05:39.099
 Detlef Uhlemann to be able to type them yes, too 

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:43.199
 Logano Downtown Euro St 

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:44.430
 the pharmacist 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:47.430
 what's coming up now they want to audition the 8th 

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:52.420
 I think game 1 will be best suited for boss at Stern 

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:55.419
 Successful one also likes that 

00:05:56.539 --> 00:05:58.789
 and we will become 

00:05:58.789 --> 00:06:03.899
 because he already kicked 19 6 1 here and the level after that chaim but woke 

00:06:04.839 --> 00:06:06.979
 Bode 2 2 succeeded 

00:06:06.979 --> 00:06:10.680
 the level here now bad as now for the next day see you 

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:12.969
 back in here 

00:06:12.969 --> 00:06:14.969
 last at 2 MEUR 

00:06:14.969 --> 00:06:19.729
 Anniversary with these short Schaub first, mostly hope you have 

00:06:19.729 --> 00:06:20.639
