some of these variables can be switched

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.249 
some of these variables can be switched
around<00:02:02.189> but<00:02:02.579> a<00:02:02.610> lot<00:02:03.479> of<00:02:03.509> them<00:02:03.659> I<00:02:03.810> kind<00:02:04.049> of<00:02:04.110> like

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
around but a lot of them I kind of like

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.770 
around but a lot of them I kind of like
I<00:02:04.469> really<00:02:04.950> like<00:02:05.130> this<00:02:05.340> set<00:02:05.850> so<00:02:06.570> we're<00:02:06.689> gonna

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
I really like this set so we're gonna

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.290 
I really like this set so we're gonna
start<00:02:06.990> off<00:02:07.110> with<00:02:08.039> the<00:02:08.069> first<00:02:08.190> i'm<00:02:09.030> going<00:02:09.179> to

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
start off with the first i'm going to

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.360 
start off with the first i'm going to
say<00:02:09.390> in<00:02:09.479> center<00:02:09.750> a<00:02:09.780> grenade<00:02:10.200> or<00:02:10.379> trip<00:02:11.190> mine

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
say in center a grenade or trip mine

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.470 
say in center a grenade or trip mine
depending<00:02:11.760> on<00:02:11.819> what<00:02:11.970> you're<00:02:12.090> playing<00:02:12.300> if

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
depending on what you're playing if

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.760 
depending on what you're playing if
you're<00:02:12.599> playing<00:02:12.750> control<00:02:13.319> i<00:02:13.500> would<00:02:13.620> say

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
you're playing control i would say

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.650 
you're playing control i would say
trip<00:02:14.010> mine<00:02:14.190> put<00:02:14.490> a<00:02:14.520> trip<00:02:14.790> mine<00:02:14.970> somewhere

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
trip mine put a trip mine somewhere

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.180 
trip mine put a trip mine somewhere
around<00:02:15.900> one<00:02:16.260> of<00:02:16.290> your<00:02:16.380> flags<00:02:16.740> or<00:02:16.950> whatever

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
around one of your flags or whatever

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:18.890 
around one of your flags or whatever
tour<00:02:17.400> it's<00:02:17.520> not<00:02:17.670> easily<00:02:18.060> seen<00:02:18.360> and<00:02:18.600> it's<00:02:18.720> not

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
tour it's not easily seen and it's not

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.130 
tour it's not easily seen and it's not
noticed<00:02:19.230> until<00:02:19.410> it's<00:02:19.800> too<00:02:19.920> late<00:02:20.720> but<00:02:21.720> I<00:02:21.750> use

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
noticed until it's too late but I use

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.250 
noticed until it's too late but I use
and<00:02:22.920> city<00:02:23.130> area<00:02:23.400> grenades<00:02:23.700> because<00:02:24.150> the<00:02:24.930> blast

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
and city area grenades because the blast

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.350 
and city area grenades because the blast
radius<00:02:25.380> is<00:02:25.710> a<00:02:25.740> little<00:02:26.040> bigger<00:02:26.220> and<00:02:26.490> it<00:02:27.210> also

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
radius is a little bigger and it also

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.660 
radius is a little bigger and it also
does<00:02:27.660> damage<00:02:27.870> over<00:02:28.170> time<00:02:28.200> so<00:02:29.010> that's<00:02:29.400> really

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
does damage over time so that's really

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.730 
does damage over time so that's really
good<00:02:29.850> especially<00:02:30.090> if<00:02:30.690> you<00:02:30.900> end<00:02:31.050> up<00:02:31.170> throwing

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
good especially if you end up throwing

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.500 
good especially if you end up throwing
it<00:02:31.950> right<00:02:32.070> in<00:02:32.190> the<00:02:32.250> middle<00:02:32.400> of<00:02:32.460> a<00:02:32.580> crowd<00:02:32.850> get

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
it right in the middle of a crowd get

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.780 
it right in the middle of a crowd get
say<00:02:34.440> it<00:02:34.500> kills<00:02:34.800> one<00:02:35.070> but<00:02:35.220> the<00:02:35.280> other<00:02:35.340> one<00:02:35.550> was<00:02:35.760> a

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
say it kills one but the other one was a

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.250 
say it kills one but the other one was a
little<00:02:35.940> bit<00:02:36.210> too<00:02:36.360> far<00:02:36.660> you<00:02:36.780> know<00:02:36.810> that<00:02:37.050> fire

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
little bit too far you know that fire

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.050 
little bit too far you know that fire
damage<00:02:37.500> can<00:02:37.860> possibly<00:02:38.550> kill<00:02:38.760> him<00:02:38.880> I<00:02:38.910> actually

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
damage can possibly kill him I actually

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.110 
damage can possibly kill him I actually
got<00:02:39.330> a<00:02:39.380> kill<00:02:40.380> from<00:02:40.680> the<00:02:41.250> fire<00:02:41.490> yesterday<00:02:41.910> I

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
got a kill from the fire yesterday I

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.210 
got a kill from the fire yesterday I
mean<00:02:42.330> I<00:02:42.390> thought<00:02:42.570> it<00:02:42.660> was<00:02:42.780> pretty<00:02:42.870> funny<00:02:43.100> on<00:02:44.100> to

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
mean I thought it was pretty funny on to

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.040 
mean I thought it was pretty funny on to
the<00:02:44.250> next<00:02:44.400> one<00:02:44.550> will<00:02:44.730> do<00:02:44.820> double<00:02:45.210> jump<00:02:45.480> and

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
the next one will do double jump and

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:47.570 
the next one will do double jump and
we're<00:02:46.140> going<00:02:46.290> to<00:02:46.350> do<00:02:46.410> higher<00:02:46.770> jump<00:02:47.130> that's

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
we're going to do higher jump that's

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.250 
we're going to do higher jump that's
what<00:02:47.910> that<00:02:48.090> way<00:02:48.180> you<00:02:48.240> could<00:02:48.450> jump<00:02:49.170> over

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
what that way you could jump over

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.160 
what that way you could jump over
building<00:02:49.800> faster<00:02:50.400> and<00:02:50.790> a<00:02:50.970> lot<00:02:51.120> easier<00:02:51.360> and<00:02:51.720> I

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
building faster and a lot easier and I

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:53.570 
building faster and a lot easier and I
mean<00:02:52.320> triple<00:02:52.680> jump<00:02:52.860> people<00:02:53.040> like<00:02:53.130> oh<00:02:53.250> well<00:02:53.490> not

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
mean triple jump people like oh well not

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:54.650 
mean triple jump people like oh well not
tripping<00:02:53.910> over<00:02:54.030> because<00:02:54.240> it's<00:02:54.270> three<00:02:54.480> jobs

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
tripping over because it's three jobs

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.540 
tripping over because it's three jobs
instead<00:02:54.900> of<00:02:55.020> two<00:02:55.140> yeah<00:02:55.830> but<00:02:56.010> regardless

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
instead of two yeah but regardless

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.320 
instead of two yeah but regardless
triple<00:02:57.000> jump<00:02:57.210> still<00:02:57.540> has<00:02:57.660> the<00:02:57.870> same<00:02:58.080> height<00:02:58.740> as

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 
triple jump still has the same height as

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.810 
triple jump still has the same height as
double<00:03:00.330> jump<00:03:00.540> does<00:03:00.750> it's<00:03:01.620> just<00:03:02.010> you<00:03:02.340> you<00:03:02.580> can

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
double jump does it's just you you can

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.580 
double jump does it's just you you can
boost<00:03:03.480> it<00:03:03.690> three<00:03:03.930> times<00:03:04.110> so<00:03:04.350> you<00:03:04.410> have<00:03:04.530> a

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
boost it three times so you have a

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:05.960 
boost it three times so you have a
little<00:03:04.680> bit<00:03:04.890> more<00:03:05.160> control<00:03:05.400> three<00:03:05.700> jumps

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
little bit more control three jumps

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:07.670 
little bit more control three jumps
better<00:03:06.630> control<00:03:06.990> obviously<00:03:07.170> you<00:03:07.560> could

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
better control obviously you could

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.890 
better control obviously you could
direct<00:03:07.830> for<00:03:08.340> the<00:03:08.460> second<00:03:08.820> jump<00:03:09.030> but<00:03:09.660> again

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
direct for the second jump but again

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.870 
direct for the second jump but again
higher<00:03:10.260> jump<00:03:10.620> for<00:03:10.920> sure<00:03:11.100> because<00:03:11.340> you<00:03:11.700> can

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
higher jump for sure because you can

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.270 
higher jump for sure because you can
just<00:03:11.910> go<00:03:12.150> up<00:03:12.240> higher<00:03:12.480> and<00:03:12.980> sometimes<00:03:13.980> some

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
just go up higher and sometimes some

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.830 
just go up higher and sometimes some
people<00:03:14.310> they<00:03:14.670> can't<00:03:14.730> follow<00:03:15.210> it<00:03:15.330> when<00:03:15.570> you<00:03:15.660> go

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
people they can't follow it when you go

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.400 
people they can't follow it when you go
up<00:03:15.990> too<00:03:16.200> high<00:03:16.790> so<00:03:17.790> obviously<00:03:18.150> next<00:03:18.390> the<00:03:19.200> main

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
up too high so obviously next the main

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:22.220 
up too high so obviously next the main
main<00:03:20.280> center<00:03:20.730> around<00:03:20.970> everything<00:03:21.330> is<00:03:21.750> golden

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
main center around everything is golden

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.880 
main center around everything is golden
gun<00:03:22.520> now<00:03:23.870> people<00:03:24.870> all<00:03:25.110> I<00:03:25.230> go<00:03:25.410> one<00:03:25.680> of<00:03:25.800> the

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
gun now people all I go one of the

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:27.530 
gun now people all I go one of the
accuracy<00:03:26.370> well<00:03:26.580> a<00:03:26.610> lot<00:03:27.030> of<00:03:27.060> these<00:03:27.209> maps<00:03:27.480> are

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
accuracy well a lot of these maps are

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:28.940 
accuracy well a lot of these maps are
pretty<00:03:27.720> tight<00:03:27.900> corner<00:03:28.290> to<00:03:28.410> accept<00:03:28.680> I<00:03:28.770> think

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
pretty tight corner to accept I think

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.150 
pretty tight corner to accept I think
maybe<00:03:29.070> two<00:03:29.340> of<00:03:29.520> them<00:03:30.140> so<00:03:31.140> I<00:03:31.170> mean<00:03:31.620> regardless

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
maybe two of them so I mean regardless

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.199 
maybe two of them so I mean regardless
of<00:03:32.220> me<00:03:32.310> I<00:03:32.340> don't<00:03:32.400> know<00:03:32.580> about<00:03:32.670> you<00:03:32.760> guys<00:03:32.910> but<00:03:33.060> I

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
of me I don't know about you guys but I

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:34.970 
of me I don't know about you guys but I
mean<00:03:33.360> I<00:03:33.480> could<00:03:33.660> snipe<00:03:33.930> across<00:03:34.350> the<00:03:34.530> map<00:03:34.709> with

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
mean I could snipe across the map with

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.240 
mean I could snipe across the map with
hand<00:03:35.610> cannon<00:03:36.000> so<00:03:36.240> it's<00:03:37.050> really<00:03:37.410> not<00:03:37.740> that<00:03:37.800> hard

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
hand cannon so it's really not that hard

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.010 
hand cannon so it's really not that hard
so<00:03:38.580> you<00:03:38.670> don't<00:03:38.850> really<00:03:39.000> need<00:03:39.209> that<00:03:39.270> extra

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:40.020 
so you don't really need that extra

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:41.390 
so you don't really need that extra
accuracy<00:03:40.650> because<00:03:40.860> all<00:03:40.950> it<00:03:41.040> does<00:03:41.070> is<00:03:41.250> just

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
accuracy because all it does is just

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.510 
accuracy because all it does is just
reduce<00:03:41.700> the<00:03:41.730> sway<00:03:42.800> and<00:03:43.800> then<00:03:43.950> combustion

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:44.520 
reduce the sway and then combustion

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:47.060 
reduce the sway and then combustion
causes<00:03:44.940> them<00:03:45.060> to<00:03:45.090> explode<00:03:45.600> then<00:03:46.050> not<00:03:46.770> really

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:47.070 
causes them to explode then not really

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:48.380 
causes them to explode then not really
too<00:03:47.220> much<00:03:47.250> because<00:03:47.730> most<00:03:48.000> of<00:03:48.120> the<00:03:48.209> time

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
too much because most of the time

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.980 
too much because most of the time
because<00:03:48.630> it's<00:03:48.840> only<00:03:48.930> six<00:03:49.200> on<00:03:49.350> six<00:03:49.650> you<00:03:50.220> know

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:50.990 
because it's only six on six you know

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:53.570 
because it's only six on six you know
very<00:03:51.990> rarely<00:03:52.440> do<00:03:52.709> you<00:03:52.830> get<00:03:53.040> it<00:03:53.190> to<00:03:53.220> where<00:03:53.459> they

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:53.580 
very rarely do you get it to where they

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:55.040 
very rarely do you get it to where they
are<00:03:53.610> like<00:03:53.850> standing<00:03:54.209> right<00:03:54.540> next<00:03:54.750> to<00:03:54.900> each

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.050 
are like standing right next to each

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:56.810 
are like standing right next to each
other<00:03:55.170> without<00:03:55.380> moving<00:03:56.010> so<00:03:56.190> it's<00:03:56.340> no<00:03:56.459> point<00:03:56.730> to

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:56.820 
other without moving so it's no point to

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.880 
other without moving so it's no point to
have<00:03:56.940> that<00:03:57.090> explosive<00:03:57.570> damage<00:03:57.690> so<00:03:58.590> I<00:03:58.620> do

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
have that explosive damage so I do

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:00.470 
have that explosive damage so I do
gunfighter<00:03:59.580> because<00:03:59.880> that<00:04:00.000> reduces<00:04:00.420> your

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
gunfighter because that reduces your

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:01.880 
gunfighter because that reduces your
cooldown<00:04:00.810> of<00:04:00.840> Golden<00:04:01.230> Gun<00:04:01.350> allowing<00:04:01.680> you<00:04:01.770> to

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
cooldown of Golden Gun allowing you to

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.730 
cooldown of Golden Gun allowing you to
use<00:04:02.070> it<00:04:02.220> more<00:04:02.459> often<00:04:02.670> so<00:04:03.510> by<00:04:04.080> that<00:04:04.110> being<00:04:04.440> said

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:04.740 
use it more often so by that being said

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:07.400 
use it more often so by that being said
you<00:04:05.340> have<00:04:05.610> this<00:04:06.300> producing<00:04:06.959> your<00:04:07.020> cooldown

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
you have this producing your cooldown

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:08.840 
you have this producing your cooldown
and<00:04:07.440> you<00:04:07.740> have<00:04:07.920> pure<00:04:08.220> intellect<00:04:08.490> gear

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:08.850 
and you have pure intellect gear

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:10.100 
and you have pure intellect gear
reducing<00:04:09.240> your<00:04:09.300> cool<00:04:09.510> down<00:04:09.630> so<00:04:09.870> you're<00:04:10.020> going

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.110 
reducing your cool down so you're going

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:11.990 
reducing your cool down so you're going
to<00:04:10.200> be<00:04:10.260> probably<00:04:10.620> like<00:04:10.830> rocking<00:04:11.370> your<00:04:11.400> your

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
to be probably like rocking your your

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.449 
to be probably like rocking your your
gun<00:04:12.720> slinger<00:04:12.989> a<00:04:13.020> whole<00:04:13.350> lot<00:04:13.560> more<00:04:13.709> often<00:04:14.070> than

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459 
gun slinger a whole lot more often than

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:17.090 
gun slinger a whole lot more often than
usual<00:04:14.910> so<00:04:15.600> that's<00:04:15.810> pretty<00:04:15.959> awesome<00:04:16.049> and<00:04:16.530> then

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100 
usual so that's pretty awesome and then

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:18.830 
usual so that's pretty awesome and then
throwing<00:04:17.370> knife<00:04:17.609> okay<00:04:18.180> throwing<00:04:18.510> knife<00:04:18.660> I

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
throwing knife okay throwing knife I

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.690 
throwing knife okay throwing knife I
always<00:04:19.109> liked<00:04:19.290> using<00:04:19.470> and<00:04:20.100> said<00:04:20.310> dat<00:04:20.489> blade

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700 
always liked using and said dat blade

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:22.880 
always liked using and said dat blade
because<00:04:20.940> I<00:04:21.150> mean<00:04:21.480> you<00:04:21.870> hit<00:04:22.020> them<00:04:22.140> with<00:04:22.770> the

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:22.890 
because I mean you hit them with the

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:25.130 
because I mean you hit them with the
blade<00:04:23.100> say<00:04:23.700> that<00:04:24.270> takes<00:04:24.540> out<00:04:24.690> like<00:04:24.870> their

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:25.140 
blade say that takes out like their

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:26.659 
blade say that takes out like their
shield<00:04:25.380> on<00:04:25.590> that<00:04:25.710> and<00:04:25.890> a<00:04:25.979> little<00:04:26.190> bit<00:04:26.280> after

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:26.669 
shield on that and a little bit after

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:26.960 
shield on that and a little bit after
that

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
that

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:28.430 
that
and<00:04:27.060> then<00:04:27.540> they<00:04:27.660> also<00:04:27.810> get<00:04:28.020> the<00:04:28.110> fire<00:04:28.290> damage

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 
and then they also get the fire damage

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:29.960 
and then they also get the fire damage
so<00:04:28.800> I<00:04:28.830> like<00:04:29.190> that<00:04:29.340> because<00:04:29.460> that's<00:04:29.670> just<00:04:29.760> more

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:29.970 
so I like that because that's just more

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:32.990 
so I like that because that's just more
and<00:04:30.030> more<00:04:30.120> damage<00:04:31.160> precision<00:04:32.160> kills<00:04:32.520> I<00:04:32.820> mean

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
and more damage precision kills I mean

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.750 
and more damage precision kills I mean
that's<00:04:33.120> literally<00:04:33.510> if<00:04:33.810> you<00:04:33.990> get<00:04:34.200> a<00:04:34.230> kill<00:04:34.530> a<00:04:34.800> lot

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:35.760 
that's literally if you get a kill a lot

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:38.270 
that's literally if you get a kill a lot
of<00:04:35.910> the<00:04:36.000> times<00:04:36.270> here<00:04:36.780> if<00:04:37.380> your<00:04:37.770> kid<00:04:38.040> if<00:04:38.130> you're

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 
of the times here if your kid if you're

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:39.440 
of the times here if your kid if you're

to do gunslingers trance because I mean
if<00:05:34.050> you're<00:05:34.169> going<00:05:34.320> hard<00:05:34.590> with<00:05:34.680> an<00:05:34.830> auto<00:05:35.010> rifle

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:35.400 
if you're going hard with an auto rifle

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:39.300 
because I always aim for the head I mean

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:41.270 
because I always aim for the head I mean
that's<00:05:39.810> I<00:05:40.169> think<00:05:40.200> that's<00:05:40.560> like<00:05:40.710> a<00:05:40.740> rule<00:05:41.070> now

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:41.280 
that's I think that's like a rule now

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:42.800 
that's I think that's like a rule now
when<00:05:41.490> it<00:05:41.610> comes<00:05:41.640> to<00:05:42.000> bungie<00:05:42.330> games<00:05:42.510> is<00:05:42.660> that

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:42.810 
when it comes to bungie games is that

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:44.240 
when it comes to bungie games is that
you<00:05:42.870> always<00:05:43.080> always<00:05:43.380> always<00:05:43.620> always<00:05:43.919> aim<00:05:44.220> for

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:44.250 
you always always always always aim for

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:47.150 
you always always always always aim for
that<00:05:44.460> so<00:05:45.270> I<00:05:45.300> mean<00:05:45.630> and<00:05:45.900> it<00:05:46.620> increases<00:05:47.010> your

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:47.160 
that so I mean and it increases your

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:50.060 
that so I mean and it increases your
stability<00:05:47.490> up<00:05:47.850> to<00:05:48.000> three<00:05:48.210> times<00:05:48.290> so<00:05:49.290> I<00:05:49.320> mean

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:50.070 
stability up to three times so I mean

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:51.560 
stability up to three times so I mean
that's<00:05:50.100> really<00:05:50.550> good<00:05:50.820> to<00:05:50.850> have<00:05:51.030> especially<00:05:51.270> if

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:51.570

you're<00:06:45.110> in<00:06:45.200> a<00:06:45.260> tight<00:06:45.410> situation<00:06:45.590> that's

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:46.100 
you're in a tight situation that's

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:48.070 
you're in a tight situation that's
pretty<00:06:46.280> good<00:06:46.430> and<00:06:46.700> again<00:06:47.660> you<00:06:47.690> don't<00:06:47.960> really

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:48.080 
pretty good and again you don't really

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:49.990 
pretty good and again you don't really
need<00:06:48.260> to<00:06:48.530> increase<00:06:49.100> the<00:06:49.310> range<00:06:49.460> of<00:06:49.580> golden<00:06:49.880> gun

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:50.000 
need to increase the range of golden gun

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.150 
need to increase the range of golden gun
because<00:06:50.300> you<00:06:50.450> could<00:06:50.600> always<00:06:50.810> just<00:06:51.110> snipe<00:06:52.040> them

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:52.160 
because you could always just snipe them

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:53.560 
because you could always just snipe them
with<00:06:52.460> the<00:06:52.550> hand<00:06:52.700> cannon<00:06:53.060> does<00:06:53.330> it<00:06:53.450> really

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:53.570 
with the hand cannon does it really

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:55.300 
with the hand cannon does it really
matter<00:06:53.780> and<00:06:54.140> you<00:06:54.680> don't<00:06:54.800> really<00:06:54.950> need<00:06:55.160> an

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:55.310 
matter and you don't really need an

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:57.100 
matter and you don't really need an
additional<00:06:55.550> throwing<00:06:56.030> knife<00:06:56.180> because<00:06:56.390> I<00:06:56.870> I

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:57.110 
additional throwing knife because I I

00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:58.840 
additional throwing knife because I I
don't<00:06:57.410> know<00:06:57.470> I<00:06:57.500> mean<00:06:57.650> you<00:06:57.770> could<00:06:57.950> but<00:06:58.010> I'd

00:06:58.840 --> 00:06:58.850 
don't know I mean you could but I'd

00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:00.700 
don't know I mean you could but I'd
rather<00:06:58.970> have<00:06:59.210> that<00:06:59.330> reload<00:06:59.630> speed<00:06:59.840> but<00:07:00.590> um

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:00.710 
rather have that reload speed but um

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:03.310 
rather have that reload speed but um
yeah<00:07:01.250> we'll<00:07:01.610> go<00:07:01.730> ahead<00:07:01.850> and<00:07:02.300> we'll<00:07:02.390> switch<00:07:03.200> it
