 curved preliminaries and all this 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:16.280
 We hang out and the secret ingredient then 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:20.000

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:33.049
 article and recipe it is shorter to experiment 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:36.820
 perry mentira vologda experimented 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:36.820
 used here this is optimal 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:44.439
 want something missing 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.439
 call from to 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:54.670
 so now we are the edge and that's the most important thing 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:58.450
 then show then the consistency of something in 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:01.600
 we get out of this closely yes and here he is 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:05.680

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:23.170
 what consistency it should be here 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.819
 we kneaded the dough and so i must be 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.860
 consistency that is like thick 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:29.080
 sour cream in the principle of this log 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.780
 the consistency is not on pancakes analogues 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:35.739
 again as much as I love you can do 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:38.769

 I know how to call a burrowing ripened pancakes 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:56.890

00:02:54.040 --> 00:03:00.310
 optimal well how can cascara sang 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:03.220
