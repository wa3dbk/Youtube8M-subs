hunter<00:00:15.540> is<00:00:15.780> there<00:00:15.960> three<00:00:16.109> things<00:00:16.470> that<00:00:16.650> you

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
hunter is there three things that you

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.160 
hunter is there three things that you
could<00:00:16.920> tell<00:00:17.160> me<00:00:17.340> about<00:00:18.060> vapor<00:00:18.510> uno<00:00:18.900> that

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
could tell me about vapor uno that

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.710 
could tell me about vapor uno that
people<00:00:19.500> in<00:00:19.590> Australia<00:00:19.730> need<00:00:20.730> to<00:00:20.939> know<00:00:21.119> about

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
people in Australia need to know about

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.859 
people in Australia need to know about
how<00:00:22.140> to<00:00:22.170> control<00:00:22.650> tree<00:00:22.949> roots<00:00:23.189> in<00:00:23.460> their<00:00:23.609> sewer

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:23.869 
how to control tree roots in their sewer

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:28.310 
how to control tree roots in their sewer
firstly<00:00:25.310> why<00:00:26.310> do<00:00:26.369> we<00:00:26.580> use<00:00:26.609> by<00:00:27.000> Prudhoe<00:00:27.320> well

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
firstly why do we use by Prudhoe well

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.420 
firstly why do we use by Prudhoe well
I'd<00:00:28.439> say<00:00:28.650> the<00:00:28.800> number<00:00:29.070> one<00:00:29.310> reason<00:00:29.609> why<00:00:30.179> is<00:00:31.430> you

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
I'd say the number one reason why is you

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.340 
I'd say the number one reason why is you
know<00:00:32.520> you<00:00:32.579> can<00:00:32.790> keep<00:00:33.030> cutting<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.570> roots<00:00:33.840> but

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
know you can keep cutting the roots but

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.229 
know you can keep cutting the roots but
when<00:00:34.950> you<00:00:35.040> cut<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.460> roots<00:00:35.670> that<00:00:35.850> grow<00:00:36.000> back

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
when you cut the roots that grow back

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.380 
when you cut the roots that grow back
thicker<00:00:36.270> and<00:00:36.780> fast<00:00:37.110> yet<00:00:37.829> so<00:00:38.059> it's<00:00:39.059> like

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
thicker and fast yet so it's like

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.200 
thicker and fast yet so it's like
pruning<00:00:39.930> your<00:00:40.050> Rose<00:00:40.320> Bowl<00:00:40.670> exactly<00:00:41.670> bernini

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
pruning your Rose Bowl exactly bernini

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.430 
pruning your Rose Bowl exactly bernini
rosebush<00:00:42.750> cutting<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:43.739> lawn<00:00:44.239> they're<00:00:45.239> all

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:45.440 
rosebush cutting the lawn they're all

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.959 
rosebush cutting the lawn they're all
plants<00:00:46.440> grow<00:00:46.710> very<00:00:47.070> similar<00:00:47.520> to<00:00:47.550> each<00:00:47.789> other

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
plants grow very similar to each other

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.150 
plants grow very similar to each other
so<00:00:48.780> even<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.140> roots<00:00:49.320> grow<00:00:49.590> back<00:00:49.770> thicker<00:00:49.800> and

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
so even the roots grow back thicker and

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.290 
so even the roots grow back thicker and
stronger<00:00:50.430> and<00:00:50.579> therefore<00:00:50.969> they're<00:00:51.120> going<00:00:51.239> to

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
stronger and therefore they're going to

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.569 
stronger and therefore they're going to
do<00:00:51.390> more<00:00:51.629> damage<00:00:51.870> to<00:00:52.170> your<00:00:52.260> pipes<00:00:52.579> absolutely

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
do more damage to your pipes absolutely

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.700 
do more damage to your pipes absolutely
yeah<00:00:54.000> not<00:00:54.660> to<00:00:54.840> mention<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.289> damage<00:00:55.469> that

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
yeah not to mention the damage that

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.779 
yeah not to mention the damage that
cutters<00:00:56.250> can<00:00:56.460> cause<00:00:56.670> themselves<00:00:57.770> and<00:00:58.770> what<00:00:59.579> we

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
cutters can cause themselves and what we

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.930 
cutters can cause themselves and what we
wanted<00:01:00.090> to<00:01:00.149> create<00:01:00.449> was<00:01:00.840> a<00:01:01.399> formula<00:01:02.399> to<00:01:02.579> kill

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
wanted to create was a formula to kill

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.240 
wanted to create was a formula to kill
the<00:01:03.090> roots<00:01:03.329> and<00:01:03.539> to<00:01:03.960> get<00:01:04.140> predictable<00:01:04.559> results

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
the roots and to get predictable results

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.370 
the roots and to get predictable results
when<00:01:05.670> they're<00:01:05.790> capable<00:01:06.210> growing<00:01:06.869> back<00:01:07.080> for<00:01:07.350> a

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
when they're capable growing back for a

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.440 
when they're capable growing back for a
certain<00:01:07.680> amount<00:01:07.740> of<00:01:07.979> time<00:01:08.189> so<00:01:08.700> if<00:01:08.850> we<00:01:09.030> if<00:01:09.390> we

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
certain amount of time so if we if we

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.600 
certain amount of time so if we if we
can<00:01:09.630> retard<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.350> regrowth<00:01:10.770> tree<00:01:11.369> roots

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
can retard the regrowth tree roots

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.480 
can retard the regrowth tree roots
that's<00:01:12.180> going<00:01:12.450> to<00:01:12.720> maintain<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:14.010> life<00:01:14.340> of

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
that's going to maintain the life of

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.210 
that's going to maintain the life of
your<00:01:14.610> sewer<00:01:15.229> absolutely<00:01:16.229> like<00:01:16.890> I<00:01:16.920> said

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
your sewer absolutely like I said

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.550 
your sewer absolutely like I said
cutting<00:01:17.549> from<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.080> damage<00:01:19.080> from<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.259> cutter

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
cutting from the damage from the cutter

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.740 
cutting from the damage from the cutter
can<00:01:20.310> destroy<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.759> platform<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.240> group<00:01:21.420> roots

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
can destroy the platform the group roots

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:22.999 
can destroy the platform the group roots
grow<00:01:21.960> back<00:01:22.140> thicker<00:01:22.170> and<00:01:22.560> they<00:01:22.650> grow<00:01:22.770> back

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
grow back thicker and they grow back

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.760 
grow back thicker and they grow back
faster<00:01:23.580> it<00:01:24.299> busts<00:01:24.600> up<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.930> pipe<00:01:25.140> more<00:01:25.470> more

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
faster it busts up the pipe more more

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:26.270 
faster it busts up the pipe more more
than

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
than

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.850 
than
thicker<00:01:26.580> and<00:01:26.790> stronger<00:01:27.060> and<00:01:27.450> eventually<00:01:28.320> you

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
thicker and stronger and eventually you

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.469 
thicker and stronger and eventually you
would<00:01:28.979> have<00:01:29.100> to<00:01:29.220> dig<00:01:29.400> up<00:01:29.549> that<00:01:29.580> pipe<00:01:29.940> unless

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
would have to dig up that pipe unless

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.690 
would have to dig up that pipe unless
you<00:01:30.690> start<00:01:30.960> treating<00:01:31.409> it<00:01:31.500> chemically<00:01:31.830> you<00:01:32.490> can

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
you start treating it chemically you can

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.940 
you start treating it chemically you can
dramatically<00:01:33.330> long<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.260> life<00:01:34.409> of<00:01:34.590> that<00:01:34.619> pipe

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
dramatically long the life of that pipe

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.580 
dramatically long the life of that pipe
and<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:36.270> other<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.509> other<00:01:36.720> advantage<00:01:37.020> for

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
and the other the other advantage for

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.070 
and the other the other advantage for
vibrator<00:01:38.100> that<00:01:38.130> I<00:01:38.310> see<00:01:38.580> is<00:01:38.759> that<00:01:39.030> is<00:01:39.479> that<00:01:39.570> we

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:40.080 
vibrator that I see is that is that we

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.050 
vibrator that I see is that is that we
can<00:01:40.259> schedule<00:01:40.590> to<00:01:40.950> apply<00:01:41.250> your<00:01:41.460> vibrator

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
can schedule to apply your vibrator

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.190 
can schedule to apply your vibrator
annually<00:01:42.899> and<00:01:43.170> if<00:01:43.800> we<00:01:43.830> do<00:01:44.159> that<00:01:44.190> then<00:01:44.729> we

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
annually and if we do that then we

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.930 
annually and if we do that then we
provide<00:01:46.200> a<00:01:46.350> guarantee<00:01:46.890> with<00:01:47.130> vapor<00:01:47.340> enemies

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:47.940 
provide a guarantee with vapor enemies

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.450 
provide a guarantee with vapor enemies
so<00:01:48.270> that<00:01:48.630> if<00:01:48.869> after<00:01:49.200> we<00:01:49.290> apply<00:01:49.590> Bible<00:01:50.070> ruler<00:01:50.310> to

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
so that if after we apply Bible ruler to

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.490 
so that if after we apply Bible ruler to
your<00:01:50.610> sewer<00:01:50.850> and<00:01:51.659> you<00:01:51.990> have<00:01:52.170> a<00:01:52.200> blockage
