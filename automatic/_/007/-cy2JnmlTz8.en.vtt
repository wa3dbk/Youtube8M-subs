00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:06.660
 hello tankers with you 40 tons and how are you 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:09.719
 see the steppe map is normal random and we 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.040
 three with valera than and bread diesel 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.380
 one point old school clan 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.820
 There are wonderful pokatushki two art 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.310
 firefly sixth level 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.230
 everything was very fun but it happened 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.000
 a funny case which you are now 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.750
 see I think you will like it 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.180
 be sure to look here we have VC 120 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.510
 camera saved please here it is 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:33.829
 gets unfortunately head on just 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:36.660
 185 okay, this one comes closer 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:40.110
 so looking for goals choose what's next 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:43.190
 and now will go interesting 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:46.050
 will go interesting interesting interesting and 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:49.469
 here and must perform a shot on the tower 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:52.170
 and see what will now be the fact 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:55.500
 what look oval yes here's a big part 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.160
 it goes there the smaller part here if 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.969
 projectile 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.949
 deviate and fly somewhere well further 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.809
 let there be a flight if the projectile flies 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.619
 closer for example to the extreme near point 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:10.110
 then look oval falls here is the article 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:12.810
 The 50th to keep it off but you 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.150
 understand that at this point the projectile 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.670
 will fly not vertically on top but under 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.220
 some angle to the ground and yes and if he 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.380
 will come here then he is with big big 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.259
 I must somehow fly over the tower 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.780
 50 and perhaps not even fly all the same 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.390
 he will hit him in the turret but my shell 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.369
 flies on the green line on the green 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:36.420
 Reconsider how do you see 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:38.369
 where did the e50 go and so i shoot and he 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.250
 perfectly in the back of the head gets 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.960
 the projectile I did not understand at first that is 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.520
 I understand when I shoot attention 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.470
 here is concentrated 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.380
 that is, I look at this very closely 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.299
 area i don't see what's going on there and and 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.350
 he went like this while the projectile was flying I 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:57.540
 didnâ€™t understand then yeah saw everything and 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:02:01.090
 with such regret 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:03.430
 here it is hooked in one extra letter that 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.950
 200 meters but there is not 200 meters 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:08.920
 Naturally there how many meters 60 and here 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:11.620
 look I mean just a little bit 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.750
 too far from the numbers matter svozhu 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.090
 I think, but now I will correct my 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.990
 mistake and like that I aim and see what 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.570
 happens 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:22.870
 my gosh it's just it's just tin 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:27.490
 now i'm reeling really look like 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:28.930
 it was now kill ally yes and here 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:31.209
 just real time without any 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.820
 delays without any pause and from okay 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:38.709
 here I have a little fast charging the strip itself 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:41.950
 charging goes goes go goes go and here i am 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:44.100
 charged and here again attention here 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.930
 here focused focused yes 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.160
 look again 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:51.160
 tin the most interesting people me not 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:53.140
 banned because the autobahn system works 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:56.050
 here look I shoot and he goes 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:58.180
 oh well such a projectile also flew 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:00.670
 closer I understand the deficiency that is she 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:03.280
 somewhere here flew up the mountain but like this 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:05.430
 Well, that is, well, I was really afraid 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.810
 there you see i become like this 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:10.330
 the blue color is nasty which is not 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:13.120
 like men but I would like to finish 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:15.280
 this video is on an upbeat note who is not 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.959
 knows the story of my channel then began 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.390
 he is on the guides on arta 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:21.489
 everyone knows and here's a shot as they say 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:24.510
 method 40 tons according to the method of all there 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:28.209
 which guides do this way 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:30.280
 our sight has settled before me 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:32.620
 already had such a shot was a similar lesson 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.510
 here and now you will see how 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:37.260
 passes the trajectory happens she 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:43.349
 it passes like this 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:46.610
 like this and this way and that way we 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:50.010
 do this shot here 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:56.069
 a slow motion projectile arrives two 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:59.069
 times and torn pattern in t110 e4 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:04:01.590
 guys you lived such shots wish you 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:04.019
 understand spatial geometry and with 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:06.620
 you were 40 tons hope you enjoyed it 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:06.620
 good luck
