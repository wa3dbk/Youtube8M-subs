00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:27.399
 and it's on these buses that your son goes to school that woman goes to work 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:30.579
 if the mother or the beach or the hospital do sus 

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:32.510
 such issue 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:34.710

 and here in df almost 500 collectives like this is just to take a look at the panel to 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.500
 realize that the bus 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.120
 they should not leave 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.580
 nor the garage is not for nothing that many drivers call a cemetery 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.479
 parking of the garret mané 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:10.800
 where buses stay during the day 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.580
 How to clean the glass with this palette 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.790
 here is a hole in the base of the accelerator 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:22.560
 about 3,000 buses of the df's regular fleet only 14 percent have 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.290
 less than two years and to the seven collectives that circulate more than 25 years 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.270
 court of accounts of the union barred the bidding notice to select 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:38.080
 companies that would operate 900 buses to replace the old fleet beyond 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.000
 request data update ' 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.240
 requested that paulínia tenders be analyzed or the area 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.260
 not only because it is a secret, there are some variations that 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:49.720
 federal district 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.020
 and we will determine this type of service we want for each one 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.300
 of these areas is not the best 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.580
 in terms of efficiency, vehicle quality in terms of technology and 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.350
 information near the river 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.400
 in terms of network monitoring and tracking of planting forehead 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:11.910
 gps the study done by the transport department and ds3 should be ready 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.980
 only at the end of September a season but we know that the militiaman we do not 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.769
 we know how it ends 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:18.790
 they are not 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.709
 the user experience of deco if there were tractors 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:25.879
 that they lasted for 1 to 1 

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:27.579
 because 

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:31.870
 in the hubble with the Nepalese who were well done ended up exaggerating 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:37.590
 some conflicts that I hold in justice, right, and there, of course, we will not have 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.239
 conditions we all want to reduce the risk of conflict 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:45.629
 mainly veto a judicialization winning bidding 

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:50.400
 so that it can happen as soon as possible there is no 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.890
 forecast for new buses to circulate 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.289
 so the more time passes 

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:57.759
 Hope has some passing 

00:02:57.759 --> 00:03:00.759
 on Thursday night 8 

00:03:02.839 --> 00:03:05.450
 but we know that this story is not from today 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:09.899
 which further uproots the population - we show here but pepe brasilia 

00:03:09.899 --> 00:03:13.350
 in February 2009 a new announced fleet 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:15.219
 a little and circumstance 

00:03:15.219 --> 00:03:17.769
 let's remember 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:21.920
 the 230 new buses cost 69 million reais 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:27.940
 circulate in all df cities except for the 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.960
 it has to be renewed a thousand and 400 fleet vehicles mainly of the 

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:37.030
 viplan who needs to renovate more than half we are all renovating 

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:40.419
 We have already renewed their positions. 

00:03:40.419 --> 00:03:43.249
 we have more money if it was programmed 

00:03:43.249 --> 00:03:45.579
 and we will do renovation 

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:49.869
 but up to a free range the goddess one of the abandoned buildings are turning up 

00:03:49.869 --> 00:03:51.199
 today 2 million 

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:53.350
 where did these 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:56.210
 69 million you know 

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:59.829
 I'll show you we found several of those standing still 

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:02.579
 on departure that the carrier of the weaving group 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:03.889
 the garage sector 

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:06.249
 industry and supply sector 

00:04:06.249 --> 00:04:09.019
 the trucks are positioned here near the garage 

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:13.120
 what makes it difficult to see the fleet with new buses knew that shifting gives 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.750
 to see two rows 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:16.540
 each with at least 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:18.129
 twenty buses 

00:04:18.129 --> 00:04:20.739
 anywhere in the afternoon and the weak 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:24.510
 in the concierge the answer is that the buses still do not try to remedy 

00:04:26.009 --> 00:04:29.009
 military brigade of havana 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:34.189
 a new date 

00:04:34.189 --> 00:04:36.360
 But look there 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.699
 they are being deployed 

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:41.029
 paulo an employee knew what to say 

00:04:41.029 --> 00:04:43.710
 at that time February 2009 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:47.990
 the government gave 18 months for transport companies to change their 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.610
 fleets 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:53.550
 We will renew eyes or we will lose the lines if we did not do it. 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:58.229
 having in August 2011 more than two years have passed and look how is the 

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:03.430
 garage that we show full of brand new buses if they are the same as 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:08.030
 two years ago I do not know but it shows that the system works so I am 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:12.250
 making them respecting the deadlines if you have supervision if you have 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:16.939
 punishment is no longer known that the buses are not in your company. 

00:05:16.939 --> 00:05:21.310
 the state of those who serve the population but 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:25.990
 contact with land and we were told that we must know details in the eyes as 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:29.590
 serial number for example to check the situation if that 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:33.620
 eyes must be rotating select regularized on join system 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:37.650
 now is not our team that will go into the private garage 'and note 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:40.970
 nicole a square of their station is not our last message 

00:05:42.089 --> 00:05:45.999
 attack until I calm down and partial pizzi but we chose heavy with these 

00:05:45.999 --> 00:05:48.020
 things I do not think I do not think fair 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:50.759
 that the population paid for transportation went out into the street 

00:05:50.759 --> 00:05:54.600
 in that situation they get out of the spot I do not like buses stopped because 

00:05:54.599 --> 00:05:56.430
 The people do not need to rain, excuse me.
