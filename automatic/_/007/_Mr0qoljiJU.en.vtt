you<00:01:54.810> asked

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
you asked

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.709 
you asked
hexagons<00:01:55.950> like<00:01:56.490> in<00:01:56.640> a<00:01:56.729> honeycomb<00:01:57.180> are<00:01:57.600> the

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
hexagons like in a honeycomb are the

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.959 
hexagons like in a honeycomb are the
most<00:01:57.840> efficient<00:01:58.439> shapes<00:01:58.740> possible<00:01:59.460> to<00:01:59.820> get

most efficient shapes possible to get

the most map with the least effort the

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.600 
the most map with the least effort the
simplicity<00:02:02.850> is<00:02:03.149> just<00:02:03.390> like<00:02:03.570> what<00:02:04.610> nature

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
simplicity is just like what nature

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.029 
simplicity is just like what nature
created<00:02:06.119> the<00:02:06.240> most<00:02:06.420> efficient<00:02:07.110> way<00:02:07.290> to<00:02:07.350> map<00:02:07.829> a

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
created the most efficient way to map a

created the most efficient way to map a
space<00:02:08.369> using<00:02:09.090> evolution<00:02:09.840> they<00:02:10.080> did<00:02:10.229> the

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
space using evolution they did the

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:11.640

experiments<00:02:10.950> again

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
experiments again

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.080

again<00:02:12.010> because<00:02:12.250> there<00:02:12.400> like<00:02:12.519> this<00:02:12.700> simplicity

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
again because there like this simplicity

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.179
