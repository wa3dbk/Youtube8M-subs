supposed to be as twin but I had a

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.550 
supposed to be as twin but I had a
problem<00:04:04.000> this<00:04:04.300> is<00:04:04.360> twin<00:04:04.750> so<00:04:04.930> I<00:04:04.960> can<00:04:05.320> show<00:04:05.500> you

problem this is twin so I can show you
this<00:04:05.830> it<00:04:06.100> closing<00:04:06.610> mechanism<00:04:07.500> but<00:04:08.500> I<00:04:08.620> will

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:08.800 
this it closing mechanism but I will

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:15.000 
this it closing mechanism but I will
show<00:04:08.950> user<00:04:10.680> found<00:04:11.680> it<00:04:12.010> would<00:04:12.250> have<00:04:13.740> this<00:04:14.740> is

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010 
show user found it would have this is

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:18.240 
show user found it would have this is
mechanism<00:04:15.820> would<00:04:16.690> have<00:04:16.750> been<00:04:17.109> there<00:04:17.350> you<00:04:18.070> get

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250 
mechanism would have been there you get

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:22.050 
mechanism would have been there you get
for<00:04:19.000> $100<00:04:19.840> pits<00:04:20.140> on<00:04:20.739> the<00:04:20.799> top<00:04:21.220> there<00:04:21.520> which<00:04:21.700> is

Diaz<00:05:14.760> Arif<00:05:15.570> in<00:05:15.780> Z<00:05:16.010> let<00:05:17.010> me<00:05:17.220> show<00:05:17.640> you<00:05:17.700> was<00:05:17.910> a

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:22.310 

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:26.720 

cart<00:05:23.310> here<00:05:23.990> underneath<00:05:25.100> he<00:05:26.100> gets<00:05:26.310> those<00:05:26.490> two

cart here underneath he gets those two

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:30.170 
cart here underneath he gets those two
Pistons<00:05:27.480> the<00:05:27.630> average<00:05:27.870> would<00:05:28.560> fly<00:05:28.890> around<00:05:29.820> if

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:30.180 
Pistons the average would fly around if

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:34.370 
Pistons the average would fly around if
you<00:05:30.300> push<00:05:30.570> this<00:05:30.810> one<00:05:31.080> and<00:05:32.000> yes<00:05:33.140> printed<00:05:34.140> pass

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:34.380 
you push this one and yes printed pass

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:36.860 
you push this one and yes printed pass
here<00:05:34.650> as<00:05:34.830> I<00:05:35.310> told<00:05:35.520> you<00:05:35.670> no<00:05:36.150> stickers<00:05:36.600> in<00:05:36.750> the

here as I told you no stickers in the

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:44.540 
here as I told you no stickers in the
set<00:05:37.140> and<00:05:38.130> I<00:05:42.080> will<00:05:43.080> try<00:05:43.350> to<00:05:43.380> get<00:05:43.919> the<00:05:44.070> from<00:05:44.280> back

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:44.550 
set and I will try to get the from back

00:05:44.550 --> 00:06:00.550 
set and I will try to get the from back

here and yeah now I will show you the

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:09.740 
here and yeah now I will show you the
mechanism<00:06:01.610> how<00:06:05.750> would<00:06:06.750> have<00:06:06.960> got<00:06:07.580> and<00:06:08.580> it<00:06:09.510> was

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:09.750 
mechanism how would have got and it was

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:15.710 
mechanism how would have got and it was
made<00:06:10.520> boom<00:06:11.520> like<00:06:12.090> this<00:06:13.190> and<00:06:14.190> then<00:06:14.550> so<00:06:15.360> who

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:15.720 
made boom like this and then so who

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:21.560
