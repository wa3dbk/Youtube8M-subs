00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 gta 5 is incredible for many is a 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.299
 extremely overrated game for 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.429
 others is the best game of this 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.170
 generation and for many others the best 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.610
 story game that no doubt 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.080
 it really is the game that has cost the most 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.470
 do and for the moment the game that has most 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:19.080
 raised the gta 5 has cost 265 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:22.080
 millions of dollars in doing overcoming 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.930
 by almost triple the people to 4 7 to 5 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.490
 raised 800 million in the first 24 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.890
 hours beating all call games 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:32.130
 of duty included and after 3 days 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.559
 the record one billion dollars in 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.079
 sales that is they sold 16 million 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.450
 copies but really gta 5 is so good 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.309
 we started with his story started the gta 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.559
 1 as you see saw from above 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.289
 that's what his grand theft title consists of 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.840
 auto 'great car theft extremely 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.670
 simple step to gta 2 which had a 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.649
 improvements a bit of graphics between the pp 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.480
 the jump remains the same 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.149
 gta san ghettos andreas is maybe the 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.829
 best game and my favorite gta this 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.170
 grand thef auto changed everything totally 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.760
 It is one of my favorite classic games 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.199
 of many years ago is a game 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.880
 amazing and it's a game that you work 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.990
 well playing now that yes the 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.670
 graphics comparing it with 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.860
 new ones that you will see in a few minutes are 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.149
 very simple but in general this game 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.250
 it's fun and the hours that we have 

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:16.229
 done like this are innumerable happening 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.790
 to gta 4 the thing was modernized it was changed 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.619
 a little what is the graphics 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.720
 they greatly improve the graphic section after 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.030
 a totally different story 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:26.399
 new characters and a special plot and 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.179
 we are here with the new and incredible 

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:29.179
 GTA 5 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.250
 I do not know where to start where 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.409
 we started talking about gta 5 its huge 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.299
 world full of thousands and thousands of things 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.920
 that do things that break sites to 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.509
 to go things to do their new 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.920
 innovation of the new characters what 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.930
 which lets you select between three 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.850
 different characters gives where the option 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.890
 to see different perspectives of the 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.720
 same story thus fostering missions 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.210
 totally different and views of other 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.830
 ways gta 5 yes that is amazing the 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.330
 city ​​are called saints in the state 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.280
 of san andreas curiously the first 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.229
 city ​​of agency san andreas but this 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.570
 city is incredible is expanded with 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.100
 beaches forests people camping area 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.130
 where people who do not have at home are 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.050
 Sleeping area dealerships rich 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.810
 where it is found most expensive cars 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.310
 really huge and beautiful the world the 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.930
 graphics to be in play 3 what 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.300
 we are seeing right now it looks very 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.080
 well take advantage in my opinion to the maximum 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.550
 the console 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.920
 the graphics even if this generation 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:25.470
 a generation that has already been 10 years 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.600
 he sees incredible the persecutions have done 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.790
 more realistic have many animations 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.769
 new although still maintains a few typical 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.290
 animations of gta iv the functions 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:36.180
 basic that all gta must have the 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.010
 saints is four times bigger than the 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.200
 liberty city of gta 4 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.930
 and that 's just the city ​​you have fields 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.430
 beaches forests and if the functions of the 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.439
 gta san andreas the functions that a 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.150
 we have all liked it, they are still 

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:49.890
 we can have cars between clothes by 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.500
 the tattoo cut veil weapons what you 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.970
 you want in general in the last year and I 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.220
 I would say it is one of the favorite games 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.629
 from the moment in which this has dried up 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.250
 year in the last thing that came out for me 

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:01.290
 consoles according to experts say and in 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.090
 my opinion may be true this is 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.370
 the best last game for these 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.840
 consoles I would have liked and the last 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.430
 thing and the last the only thing wants 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.900
 criticize more or less of this is that it 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.670
 have wrong with the dates and I 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.470
 it seems very bad that they have taken 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.970
 only this generation and after 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.739
 want to take out for the next one and then 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.269
 announces in the pc I would have liked that 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:19.560
 they would have given the option of everything so that 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:21.269
 be the perfect game I would like it to be 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.310
 look better and better yet it seems that it is 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:25.409
 impossible because it looks excellent have you 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.349
 given the 97 in metacritic web page 

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:29.519
 that he used to see the criticisms of 

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:31.290
 video games movies whatever it is a 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:33.030
 very high score and it is quite right 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.069
 it's a great big game 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.690
 if you have that money left over and you do not 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:39.780
 bored with games like the one in the box or 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:41.909
 any other game whatever it is 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.010
 recommended one hundred percent is a great 

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:44.400
 game if you're a fan of the gta is 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.189
 Clear 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.780
 very few to the world to 5 years or so 

00:03:47.189 --> 00:03:50.250
 l 1 so it's really yes it deserves 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.110
 worth it and if only he is a player 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.579
 casual can watch many videos there you 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:54.780
 will inform a lot of everything but in 

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:56.549
 general the functions are these have 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.890
 innovated many things is fun is 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:04:00.569
 addictive the story is very very cool 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:02.129
 I can say that of graphics or for 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:03.989
 surprise especially because you're playing 

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:06.000
 in your law that in technology in 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:07.439
 the 10-year template line one of 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.879
 the best things of the game apart the 

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:11.159
 funny offers the innovation that 

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:13.140
 it really is abysmal is its price is not 

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:14.310
 the price or at least you can find it 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:15.959
 for much lower price then 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:17.880
 find them at least here in Spain 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:19.289
 for 60 euros instead of 70 what what 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.359
 is worth a price what is worth the price of 

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:22.979
 a normal game and therefore apart from 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:24.960
 that includes the online gta that is a 

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:26.970
 incredible function that I really am 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.800
 anxiously waiting for the function of the gta 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:30.240
 online is a separate game directly 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.460
 it's a game apart from extending life 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:34.500
 this game even more if it is already a sandbox 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:36.599
 if it is already a game that really 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:38.070
 it lasts a long long really never 

00:04:36.599 --> 00:04:39.300
 you get tired of him maybe after a few 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:40.860
 hours in a row and that you have is from him 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:43.470
 but I say you never get tired if you go back 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:45.389
 to resume it 12 days later on people 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:47.070
 online will extend much things 

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:48.870
 so I think if you have the money or 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:50.760
 spend and really served for 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:52.860
 make a game of it spends yes no 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:54.000
 you have and you can make an effort you can 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.830
 it's worth it but if you're not 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.600
 sure you have thousands and thousands of videos in 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:59.610
 youtube so do not worry about that 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:01.260
 and above with gta online in game 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:04.460
 multiply by 2 forming two 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.460
 great games
