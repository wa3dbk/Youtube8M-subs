video games now in terms of the actual

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:41.560 
video games now in terms of the actual
differences<00:04:40.340> there's<00:04:40.640> not<00:04:40.820> many<00:04:41.090> and<00:04:41.480> they

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:41.570 
differences there's not many and they

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:43.420 
differences there's not many and they
mostly<00:04:41.900> come<00:04:42.140> down<00:04:42.320> to<00:04:42.530> the<00:04:42.650> CPU<00:04:43.130> and<00:04:43.370> the

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:43.430 
mostly come down to the CPU and the

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:45.580 
mostly come down to the CPU and the
graphics<00:04:44.270> cards<00:04:44.630> but<00:04:44.990> it's<00:04:45.140> nice<00:04:45.260> to<00:04:45.410> have<00:04:45.560> a

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:45.590

gaming<00:04:45.890> central<00:04:46.400> board<00:04:46.670> before<00:04:47.420> we<00:04:47.750> go<00:04:47.900> let's

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:48.140 
gaming central board before we go let's

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:49.720 
gaming central board before we go let's
talk<00:04:48.260> about<00:04:48.380> that<00:04:48.620> streaming<00:04:49.040> engine<00:04:49.490> right

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:49.730 
talk about that streaming engine right

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:52.390 
talk about that streaming engine right
now<00:04:50.480> that<00:04:50.690> streaming<00:04:51.110> engine<00:04:51.530> is<00:04:51.740> all<00:04:52.010> about

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.400 
now that streaming engine is all about

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.270 
now that streaming engine is all about
