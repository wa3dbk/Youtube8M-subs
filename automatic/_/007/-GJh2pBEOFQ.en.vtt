okay so one of the more common questions
that<00:00:03.270> people<00:00:03.449> ask<00:00:03.990> me<00:00:04.049> about<00:00:04.140> my<00:00:04.470> Nissan<00:00:04.770> Leaf

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
that people ask me about my Nissan Leaf

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:07.130 
that people ask me about my Nissan Leaf
is<00:00:05.220> they<00:00:05.670> want<00:00:05.879> to<00:00:05.940> know<00:00:06.060> how<00:00:06.569> long<00:00:06.839> does<00:00:07.080> it

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
is they want to know how long does it

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.620 
is they want to know how long does it
take<00:00:07.410> to<00:00:07.560> charge<00:00:07.910> well<00:00:08.910> that's<00:00:09.240> a<00:00:09.360> difficult

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
take to charge well that's a difficult

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.259 
take to charge well that's a difficult
question<00:00:09.929> to<00:00:10.260> answer<00:00:10.349> and<00:00:10.920> so<00:00:11.550> I've<00:00:11.880> made<00:00:11.940> this

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
question to answer and so I've made this

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.419 
question to answer and so I've made this
video<00:00:12.540> in<00:00:13.019> order<00:00:13.200> to<00:00:13.500> attempt<00:00:13.799> to<00:00:13.889> properly

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
video in order to attempt to properly

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.939 
video in order to attempt to properly
explain<00:00:14.759> that<00:00:15.260> so<00:00:16.260> there<00:00:16.590> are<00:00:16.710> essentially

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
explain that so there are essentially

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.790 
explain that so there are essentially

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
3 charge port on my car now the level 3

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.700 
3 charge port on my car now the level 3
charger<00:02:00.540> would<00:02:00.719> typically<00:02:01.290> only<00:02:01.500> be

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
charger would typically only be

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.789 
charger would typically only be
available<00:02:02.009> in<00:02:02.490> a<00:02:02.579> commercial<00:02:03.090> environment

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:03.799 
available in a commercial environment

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:06.609 
available in a commercial environment
but<00:02:04.799> it<00:02:04.920> can<00:02:05.159> charge<00:02:05.460> the<00:02:05.579> Leaf<00:02:05.759> very<00:02:06.240> quickly

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:06.619 
but it can charge the Leaf very quickly

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:09.589 
but it can charge the Leaf very quickly
typically<00:02:07.619> you<00:02:08.369> get<00:02:08.580> nearly<00:02:08.970> a<00:02:09.000> full<00:02:09.390> battery

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
typically you get nearly a full battery

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:13.520 
typically you get nearly a full battery
charge<00:02:10.050> in<00:02:10.349> less<00:02:10.979> than<00:02:11.160> 30<00:02:11.400> minutes

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
charge in less than 30 minutes

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.890 
charge in less than 30 minutes
okay<00:02:13.860> so<00:02:14.130> I've<00:02:14.400> given<00:02:14.580> you<00:02:14.730> the<00:02:15.180> raw<00:02:15.390> numbers

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
okay so I've given you the raw numbers

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.960 
okay so I've given you the raw numbers
now<00:02:16.470> let<00:02:16.770> me<00:02:16.860> explain<00:02:16.920> why<00:02:17.340> those<00:02:17.460> numbers<00:02:17.820> are

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
now let me explain why those numbers are

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.110 
now let me explain why those numbers are
almost<00:02:18.450> meaningless<00:02:19.700> notice<00:02:20.700> that<00:02:20.820> in<00:02:21.000> each

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
almost meaningless notice that in each

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.030 
almost meaningless notice that in each
occasion<00:02:21.480> I<00:02:21.780> said<00:02:21.990> if<00:02:22.200> the<00:02:22.500> battery<00:02:22.830> were

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
occasion I said if the battery were

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.190 
occasion I said if the battery were
fully<00:02:23.370> drained<00:02:23.730> well<00:02:24.210> the<00:02:24.540> truth<00:02:24.750> about<00:02:24.900> it<00:02:25.080> is

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
fully drained well the truth about it is

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.620 
fully drained well the truth about it is
that<00:02:25.710> very<00:02:26.160> rarely<00:02:26.520> happens<00:02:26.850> most<00:02:27.480> of<00:02:27.570> the

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
that very rarely happens most of the

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.300 
that very rarely happens most of the
time<00:02:27.750> that<00:02:28.050> you<00:02:28.110> plug<00:02:28.350> your<00:02:28.380> leaf<00:02:28.650> in<00:02:28.890> you're

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
time that you plug your leaf in you're

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.400 
time that you plug your leaf in you're
still<00:02:29.580> going<00:02:29.760> to<00:02:29.820> have<00:02:30.000> some<00:02:30.810> power<00:02:31.050> in<00:02:31.320> the

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
still going to have some power in the

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:32.750 
still going to have some power in the
battery<00:02:31.530> let<00:02:31.920> me<00:02:32.010> give<00:02:32.160> you<00:02:32.220> some<00:02:32.430> real-life

on the car well not battery still about
half<00:02:58.290> full<00:02:58.500> so<00:02:58.860> it's<00:02:59.430> still<00:02:59.700> only<00:02:59.850> going<00:03:00.090> to

half full so it's still only going to

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:05.000 
half full so it's still only going to
take<00:03:00.470> 3-4<00:03:01.470> hours<00:03:01.500> maybe<00:03:02.190> 5<00:03:02.550> probably<00:03:03.300> for<00:03:04.010> to

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
take 3-4 hours maybe 5 probably for to

fully<00:03:05.280> recharge<00:03:05.520> the<00:03:05.940> car<00:03:06.830> so<00:03:07.830> those<00:03:08.220> numbers

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
fully recharge the car so those numbers

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.330 
fully recharge the car so those numbers
that<00:03:09.360> I<00:03:09.510> say<00:03:09.780> like<00:03:09.989> 8<00:03:10.200> hours<00:03:10.440> recharge<00:03:10.980> the<00:03:11.160> car

remains<00:05:22.640> pretty<00:05:22.910> much<00:05:23.000> the<00:05:23.270> same<00:05:23.450> as<00:05:23.780> I've

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:24.110 
remains pretty much the same as I've

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:26.200 
remains pretty much the same as I've
always<00:05:24.290> says<00:05:24.590> like<00:05:24.800> we<00:05:24.920> know<00:05:25.070> what<00:05:25.250> if<00:05:26.030> you

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:26.210 
always says like we know what if you

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:28.260 
always says like we know what if you
drive<00:05:26.420> those<00:05:26.630> kind<00:05:26.810> of<00:05:26.870> distances<00:05:27.290> to<00:05:27.410> work<00:05:27.560> I

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:28.270 
drive those kind of distances to work I

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:30.640 
drive those kind of distances to work I
guess<00:05:29.270> an<00:05:29.420> electric<00:05:29.720> car<00:05:29.900> is<00:05:30.020> just<00:05:30.200> not<00:05:30.440> for

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:30.650 
guess an electric car is just not for

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:33.520 
guess an electric car is just not for
you<00:05:30.770> so<00:05:31.270> drive<00:05:32.270> whatever<00:05:32.480> you<00:05:32.840> think<00:05:33.260> you<00:05:33.410> need

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:33.530 
you so drive whatever you think you need

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:37.240 
you so drive whatever you think you need
to<00:05:33.560> drive<00:05:33.830> well<00:05:34.690> that's<00:05:35.690> you<00:05:36.350> know<00:05:36.530> I<00:05:36.800> mean

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:39.110 
maybe if you use down the road when the

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:42.310 
maybe if you use down the road when the
ranges<00:05:39.710> improve<00:05:40.550> and<00:05:41.030> charge<00:05:41.540> times<00:05:41.840> improve

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:42.320 
ranges improve and charge times improve

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:45.000 
ranges improve and charge times improve
you<00:05:43.100> know<00:05:43.220> maybe<00:05:43.400> you<00:05:43.550> could<00:05:43.700> read<00:05:43.850> that<00:05:44.420> but
