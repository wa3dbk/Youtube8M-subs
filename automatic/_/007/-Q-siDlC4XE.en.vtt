00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
this is a really busy facility not just

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.540 
this is a really busy facility not just
for<00:01:40.020> training<00:01:40.230> but<00:01:40.770> also<00:01:40.950> used<00:01:41.340> by

hours<00:01:44.430> up<00:01:44.610> so<00:01:45.030> it<00:01:45.150> wasn't<00:01:45.450> long<00:01:45.630> before<00:01:45.660> we<00:01:46.020> had

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
hours up so it wasn't long before we had

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.050 
hours up so it wasn't long before we had
to<00:01:46.470> make<00:01:46.620> way<00:01:46.800> for<00:01:46.830> someone<00:01:47.310> else<00:01:47.670> to<00:01:47.850> have<00:01:47.880> a

go<00:01:48.770> what<00:01:49.770> a<00:01:49.800> combine<00:01:50.190> all<00:01:50.370> that<00:01:50.550> take<00:01:51.030> this

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:51.120 
go what a combine all that take this

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:55.700 
go what a combine all that take this
back<00:01:51.330> Atlantis<00:01:51.750> of<00:01:51.900> the<00:01:51.990> earth<00:01:54.500> well<00:01:55.500> that<00:01:55.620> was

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
back Atlantis of the earth well that was

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.370 
back Atlantis of the earth well that was
absolutely<00:01:55.860> amazing<00:01:56.700> so<00:01:57.420> realistic<00:01:58.110> to<00:01:58.200> be<00:01:58.290> in

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
absolutely amazing so realistic to be in

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.170 
absolutely amazing so realistic to be in
that<00:01:58.500> simulator<00:01:58.980> but<00:01:59.400> now<00:01:59.520> it's<00:01:59.670> time<00:01:59.850> to<00:01:59.910> go

I'm actually at the compares well I'm
doing<00:02:40.659> this<00:02:40.900> so

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.430 

I<00:02:46.760> thought<00:02:47.300> I'd<00:02:47.450> take<00:02:47.660> the<00:02:47.840> Merlin<00:02:48.200> for<00:02:48.410> a

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
I thought I'd take the Merlin for a

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.410 
I thought I'd take the Merlin for a
little<00:02:48.739> spin<00:02:49.010> up<00:02:49.160> the<00:02:49.190> coast<00:02:49.310> from<00:02:49.879> cold<00:02:50.150> roads

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
little spin up the coast from cold roads

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:56.070 
little spin up the coast from cold roads
to<00:02:50.660> have<00:02:50.840> a<00:02:50.870> look<00:02:51.050> at<00:02:51.170> st.<00:02:51.410> Michael's<00:02:51.650> Mount

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.530 

and<00:02:56.470> what<00:02:56.980> an<00:02:57.160> amazing<00:02:57.640> view<00:02:57.850> you<00:02:58.090> get<00:02:58.300> from

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
and what an amazing view you get from

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:59.100 
and what an amazing view you get from
the<00:02:58.690> air

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
the air

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.230 
the air
I<00:02:59.140> flew<00:02:59.650> round<00:02:59.860> it<00:03:00.040> three<00:03:00.310> times<00:03:00.580> and<00:03:00.880> then

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:01.240 
I flew round it three times and then

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.840 
I flew round it three times and then
somewhat<00:03:01.810> reluctantly<00:03:02.500> gave<00:03:03.070> control<00:03:03.520> back

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
somewhat reluctantly gave control back

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:11.100 
somewhat reluctantly gave control back
and<00:03:04.300> we<00:03:04.540> headed<00:03:04.780> back<00:03:05.080> to<00:03:05.290> base

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:12.990 

well<00:03:12.040> I<00:03:12.070> took<00:03:12.160> the<00:03:12.310> controls<00:03:12.490> of<00:03:12.910> the

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
well I took the controls of the

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.610 
well I took the controls of the
simulator<00:03:13.480> and<00:03:13.690> that<00:03:13.810> was<00:03:13.960> pretty<00:03:14.140> cool

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
simulator and that was pretty cool

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.800 
simulator and that was pretty cool
but<00:03:14.980> I<00:03:15.010> never<00:03:15.130> expected<00:03:15.550> to<00:03:15.970> be<00:03:16.090> allowed<00:03:16.420> to

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
but I never expected to be allowed to

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:18.540 
but I never expected to be allowed to
take<00:03:17.020> control<00:03:17.410> of<00:03:17.530> the<00:03:17.800> real<00:03:18.010> thing<00:03:18.430> an

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:18.550 
take control of the real thing an

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:21.480 
take control of the real thing an
absolutely<00:03:19.390> amazing<00:03:19.870> experience<00:03:20.710> we<00:03:21.250> flew<00:03:21.460> up

absolutely amazing experience we flew up

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:23.430 
absolutely amazing experience we flew up
the<00:03:21.670> coast<00:03:21.910> and<00:03:22.120> back<00:03:22.240> and<00:03:22.540> look<00:03:22.990> we're<00:03:23.290> back

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.040 
the coast and back and look we're back
on<00:03:23.620> the<00:03:23.710> ground<00:03:23.860> back<00:03:24.490> on<00:03:24.730> terra<00:03:25.000> firma<00:03:25.120> in<00:03:25.600> one
