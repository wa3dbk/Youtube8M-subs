place<00:00:25.180> the<00:00:25.390> crystal<00:00:25.810> in<00:00:25.930> the<00:00:26.050> central

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:26.410 
place the crystal in the central

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:28.290 
place the crystal in the central
apparatus<00:00:26.710> and<00:00:27.189> we<00:00:27.669> could<00:00:27.820> start<00:00:28.090> the<00:00:28.270> process

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:28.300 
apparatus and we could start the process

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:38.410 
apparatus and we could start the process
for<00:00:28.960> focusing<00:00:29.470> it

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:38.420

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
hmm now the crisp heating and you'll

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.610 
hmm now the crisp heating and you'll
need<00:00:41.820> to<00:00:41.880> you<00:00:42.120> there<00:00:42.600> should<00:00:42.780> be<00:00:42.900> a<00:00:42.930> few<00:00:43.200> basic

need to you there should be a few basic
tomes<00:00:43.890> around<00:00:44.310> here<00:00:44.520> somewhere<00:00:44.970> in<00:00:45.060> case<00:00:45.270> your

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
tomes around here somewhere in case your

00:00:45.480 --> 00:02:09.280 
tomes around here somewhere in case your
training<00:00:45.900> is<00:00:45.990> even<00:00:46.260> more<00:00:46.380> substandard<00:00:47.040> than<00:00:47.400> I

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:09.290 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:12.210 

finally<00:02:09.980> going<00:02:10.160> to<00:02:10.280> pay<00:02:10.370> off<00:02:10.780> what's<00:02:11.780> there

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
finally going to pay off what's there

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.910 
finally going to pay off what's there
these<00:02:13.220> results<00:02:14.110> they're<00:02:15.110> not<00:02:15.320> at<00:02:15.470> all<00:02:15.650> what

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
these results they're not at all what

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.790 
these results they're not at all what
they<00:02:16.040> should<00:02:16.340> be<00:02:16.750> this<00:02:17.750> projection<00:02:18.320> should<00:02:18.680> be

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
they should be this projection should be

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.700 
they should be this projection should be
lit<00:02:19.010> up<00:02:19.160> like<00:02:19.220> the<00:02:19.400> night<00:02:19.670> sky<00:02:20.320> something<00:02:21.320> is

lit up like the night sky something is

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:23.410 
lit up like the night sky something is
creating<00:02:22.310> an<00:02:22.430> incredible<00:02:23.000> amount<00:02:23.240> of
