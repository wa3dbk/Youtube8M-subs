amount of double jumps now the double

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.880 
amount of double jumps now the double
jumps<00:03:33.480> are<00:03:33.660> when<00:03:33.840> you<00:03:33.989> press<00:03:34.260> spacebar

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:36.890 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:40.699 

simultaneously<00:03:37.920> fast<00:03:38.489> like<00:03:39.120> a<00:03:39.150> boss<00:03:39.360> you<00:03:39.709> will

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
simultaneously fast like a boss you will

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:43.580 
simultaneously fast like a boss you will
jump<00:03:41.519> get<00:03:41.850> like<00:03:42.030> a<00:03:42.060> random<00:03:42.450> just<00:03:43.050> jump<00:03:43.320> boost

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
jump get like a random just jump boost

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.590 
jump get like a random just jump boost
and<00:03:43.950> that's<00:03:44.550> even<00:03:44.910> like<00:03:45.060> if<00:03:45.209> you're<00:03:45.360> already

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
and that's even like if you're already

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.560 
and that's even like if you're already
falling<00:03:45.989> so<00:03:46.680> you<00:03:46.739> can<00:03:47.070> actually<00:03:47.330> get<00:03:48.330> back

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:48.570 
falling so you can actually get back

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:51.440 
falling so you can actually get back
onto<00:03:48.810> the<00:03:49.019> map<00:03:49.260> if<00:03:49.560> you<00:03:49.620> fall<00:03:50.310> too<00:03:50.550> far<00:03:50.580> or<00:03:51.360> you

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
onto the map if you fall too far or you

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:54.650 
onto the map if you fall too far or you
know<00:03:51.570> fall<00:03:51.840> in<00:03:52.019> general<00:03:52.350> so<00:03:52.800> like<00:03:53.670> that<00:03:54.209> is<00:03:54.480> the

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
know fall in general so like that is the

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.120 
know fall in general so like that is the
end<00:03:54.780> of<00:03:54.870> the<00:03:54.930> things<00:03:55.230> and<00:03:55.500> now<00:03:55.800> that<00:03:56.010> we're<00:03:56.100> on

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
end of the things and now that we're on

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:57.440 
end of the things and now that we're on
the<00:03:56.280> bottom<00:03:56.489> floor<00:03:56.610> we<00:03:56.790> probably<00:03:57.030> will<00:03:57.209> end<00:03:57.360> up

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
the bottom floor we probably will end up

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:58.850 
the bottom floor we probably will end up
using<00:03:57.570> our<00:03:57.720> double<00:03:58.050> jump<00:03:58.230> if<00:03:58.380> we<00:03:58.560> begin<00:03:58.739> to

00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:58.860 
using our double jump if we begin to

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.500 
using our double jump if we begin to
fall<00:03:59.160> because<00:03:59.640> that's<00:03:59.910> what<00:04:00.030> it's<00:04:00.150> for

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
fall because that's what it's for

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:03.170 
fall because that's what it's for
so<00:04:00.900> yeah<00:04:01.739> and<00:04:02.400> then<00:04:02.580> you<00:04:02.640> have<00:04:02.790> the<00:04:02.910> amount<00:04:03.090> of

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
so yeah and then you have the amount of

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:04.759 
so yeah and then you have the amount of
players<00:04:03.570> to<00:04:03.720> your<00:04:03.930> right<00:04:04.080> as<00:04:04.200> well<00:04:04.380> like<00:04:04.590> there

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:04.769 
players to your right as well like there

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:08.690 
players to your right as well like there
are<00:04:04.890> 17<00:04:05.489> players<00:04:05.850> 14<00:04:06.780> now<00:04:07.019> and<00:04:07.440> when<00:04:07.980> I<00:04:08.310> don't

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
are 17 players 14 now and when I don't

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.040 
are 17 players 14 now and when I don't
like<00:04:08.850> to<00:04:09.000> glance<00:04:09.269> at<00:04:09.420> that<00:04:09.540> too<00:04:09.720> much<00:04:09.870> because

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:10.050 
like to glance at that too much because

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:11.900 
like to glance at that too much because
it<00:04:10.200> can<00:04:10.320> often<00:04:10.470> take<00:04:10.860> your<00:04:11.100> attention<00:04:11.190> away<00:04:11.550> a

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
it can often take your attention away a

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:13.759 
it can often take your attention away a
lot<00:04:12.390> of<00:04:12.480> times<00:04:12.660> I<00:04:12.810> just<00:04:12.989> checked<00:04:13.230> the<00:04:13.320> the

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:13.769 
lot of times I just checked the the

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:17.000 
lot of times I just checked the the
bottom<00:04:14.190> chat<00:04:14.670> window<00:04:15.090> just<00:04:15.269> to<00:04:15.390> see<00:04:15.780> the<00:04:16.769> the

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
bottom chat window just to see the the

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:18.770 
bottom chat window just to see the the
current<00:04:17.370> stuff<00:04:17.640> but<00:04:17.880> I<00:04:17.910> don't<00:04:18.239> check<00:04:18.419> that<00:04:18.630> too

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
current stuff but I don't check that too

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:20.210 
current stuff but I don't check that too
often<00:04:18.930> either<00:04:19.169> because<00:04:19.500> it<00:04:19.590> can<00:04:19.709> really<00:04:19.950> mess

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
often either because it can really mess

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.550 
often either because it can really mess
with<00:04:20.280> your<00:04:20.549> attention<00:04:21.060> see<00:04:21.600> that<00:04:21.900> was<00:04:22.200> almost

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
with your attention see that was almost

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.340 
with your attention see that was almost
bad<00:04:22.800> and<00:04:23.490> this<00:04:24.150> might<00:04:24.390> be<00:04:24.419> to<00:04:24.750> our

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:25.350 
bad and this might be to our

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:26.750 
bad and this might be to our
okay<00:04:25.530> so<00:04:25.860> we're<00:04:26.070> just<00:04:26.100> gonna<00:04:26.310> continue<00:04:26.460> to

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 
okay so we're just gonna continue to

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.690 
okay so we're just gonna continue to
walk<00:04:27.060> and<00:04:27.330> that<00:04:27.390> is<00:04:28.260> about<00:04:28.710> all<00:04:29.220> you<00:04:29.280> really

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:29.700 
walk and that is about all you really

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:31.820 
walk and that is about all you really
need<00:04:29.850> to<00:04:29.970> do<00:04:30.090> with<00:04:30.270> DNC<00:04:30.630> run<00:04:30.810> just<00:04:31.230> walk<00:04:31.560> as

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
need to do with DNC run just walk as

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.190 
need to do with DNC run just walk as
often<00:04:32.160> as<00:04:32.280> you<00:04:32.400> can<00:04:32.430> because<00:04:33.300> it<00:04:33.630> helps<00:04:34.050> you

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:34.200 
often as you can because it helps you

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.860 
often as you can because it helps you
keep<00:04:34.740> your<00:04:34.800> focus<00:04:35.190> and<00:04:35.580> you<00:04:36.450> can<00:04:36.660> actually

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
keep your focus and you can actually

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:39.200 
keep your focus and you can actually
make<00:04:37.440> a<00:04:37.470> lot<00:04:37.710> of<00:04:37.740> these<00:04:37.890> jumps<00:04:38.460> you<00:04:38.880> just<00:04:39.060> have

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.210 
make a lot of these jumps you just have

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:42.410 
make a lot of these jumps you just have
to<00:04:39.330> practice<00:04:40.260> a<00:04:40.620> bit<00:04:40.830> because<00:04:41.070> the<00:04:41.850> the<00:04:42.060> jumps

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:42.420 
to practice a bit because the the jumps

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:44.030 
to practice a bit because the the jumps
really<00:04:42.570> aren't<00:04:42.930> impossible<00:04:43.770> when<00:04:43.920> you're

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:44.040 
really aren't impossible when you're

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:45.710 
really aren't impossible when you're
walking<00:04:44.430> it's<00:04:44.580> just<00:04:44.790> it<00:04:44.940> seems<00:04:45.240> like<00:04:45.510> they<00:04:45.630> are

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:45.720 
walking it's just it seems like they are

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.860 
walking it's just it seems like they are
because<00:04:45.900> of<00:04:46.820> people<00:04:47.820> being<00:04:48.030> used<00:04:48.270> to<00:04:48.450> running

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:48.870 
because of people being used to running

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:51.860 
because of people being used to running
all<00:04:48.960> the<00:04:49.140> time<00:04:49.290> and<00:04:49.350> like<00:04:49.770> parkour<00:04:50.310> feels<00:04:51.240> you

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870 
all the time and like parkour feels you

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:55.190 
all the time and like parkour feels you
know<00:04:51.990> and<00:04:52.820> yes<00:04:53.820> so<00:04:54.090> if<00:04:54.300> you<00:04:54.510> feel<00:04:54.780> like<00:04:54.810> you<00:04:55.050> are

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:55.200 
know and yes so if you feel like you are

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:56.720 
know and yes so if you feel like you are
gonna<00:04:55.320> fall<00:04:55.560> it's<00:04:55.710> totally<00:04:56.100> fine<00:04:56.310> because<00:04:56.520> you

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:56.730 
gonna fall it's totally fine because you

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:58.100 
gonna fall it's totally fine because you
have<00:04:56.820> to<00:04:57.000> double<00:04:57.330> jumps<00:04:57.600> that<00:04:57.750> will<00:04:57.930> totally

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:58.110 
have to double jumps that will totally

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:00.020 
have to double jumps that will totally
save<00:04:58.590> you<00:04:58.740> in<00:04:58.890> a<00:04:58.980> situation<00:04:59.190> like<00:04:59.580> this<00:04:59.790> one

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:00.030

save you in a situation like this one
where<00:05:00.060> yeah<00:05:01.050> I<00:05:01.200> just<00:05:01.440> used<00:05:01.590> a<00:05:01.710> double<00:05:01.980> jump

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.160 
where yeah I just used a double jump
