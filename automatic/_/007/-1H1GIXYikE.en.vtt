the main directory in this case my dll
file<00:00:43.920> is<00:00:44.159> named<00:00:44.339> the<00:00:44.549> DLL<00:00:45.059> underscore<00:00:45.629> load

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:45.979 
file is named the DLL underscore load

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:48.710 
file is named the DLL underscore load
DLL<00:00:46.979> your<00:00:47.640> file<00:00:47.909> might<00:00:48.210> be<00:00:48.360> named<00:00:48.510> differently

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
case like I said mine was DLL underscore

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.120 
case like I said mine was DLL underscore
load<00:01:10.620> dot<00:01:11.130> DL<00:01:11.930> hit<00:01:12.930> enter<00:01:13.260> and<00:01:13.500> if<00:01:13.650> you<00:01:13.830> do<00:01:13.980> it

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130

load dot DL hit enter and if you do it
all<00:01:14.250> correctly<00:01:14.430> you<00:01:14.820> should<00:01:15.060> notice<00:01:15.420> it<00:01:15.540> says

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
all correctly you should notice it says

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.330 
all correctly you should notice it says
the<00:01:15.840> file<00:01:16.080> name<00:01:16.320> and<00:01:16.500> then<00:01:16.770> it<00:01:16.830> says<00:01:17.100> is

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
the file name and then it says is

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.340 
the file name and then it says is
default<00:01:17.850> unencrypted<00:01:18.630> come<00:01:18.870> for<00:01:19.080> onion

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
default unencrypted come for onion

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.250 
default unencrypted come for onion
uncompressed<00:01:20.360> when<00:01:21.360> it<00:01:21.540> says<00:01:21.690> unencrypted

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:22.260 
uncompressed when it says unencrypted

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.410 
uncompressed when it says unencrypted
that<00:01:22.410> means<00:01:22.620> uh<00:01:22.800> the<00:01:23.610> coding<00:01:24.000> is<00:01:24.120> basically

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
that means uh the coding is basically

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.120 
that means uh the coding is basically
unencrypted<00:01:24.840> you<00:01:25.170> know<00:01:25.290> whatever<00:01:25.530> it<00:01:25.800> kind<00:01:26.070> of

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
unencrypted you know whatever it kind of

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.170 
unencrypted you know whatever it kind of
speaks<00:01:26.310> for<00:01:26.610> itself

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
speaks for itself

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.810 
speaks for itself
so<00:01:27.600> once<00:01:27.900> you've<00:01:28.020> done<00:01:28.140> that<00:01:28.460> you<00:01:29.460> can<00:01:29.640> go

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
so once you've done that you can go

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.510 
so once you've done that you can go
ahead<00:01:29.880> and<00:01:30.120> open<00:01:30.330> up<00:01:30.360> this<00:01:30.510> hxd<00:01:31.320> for<00:01:32.190> our<00:01:32.280> file

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
ahead and open up this hxd for our file

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.480 
ahead and open up this hxd for our file
and<00:01:32.850> extract<00:01:33.120> the<00:01:33.420> hxd<00:01:33.930> to<00:01:34.080> desktop<00:01:34.500> you<00:01:35.280> want

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
and extract the hxd to desktop you want

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.700 
and extract the hxd to desktop you want
to<00:01:35.610> edit<00:01:35.880> it<00:01:35.970> in<00:01:36.090> hxd<00:01:36.780> I<00:01:36.810> do<00:01:37.050> not<00:01:37.350> recommend

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
to edit it in hxd I do not recommend

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.530 
to edit it in hxd I do not recommend
doing<00:01:37.890> it<00:01:38.159> as<00:01:38.280> it's<00:01:38.490> kind<00:01:38.700> of<00:01:38.730> really<00:01:38.940> hard<00:01:39.030> yep

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
doing it as it's kind of really hard yep

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.560 
doing it as it's kind of really hard yep
this<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:40.380> commands<00:01:40.950> are<00:01:41.130> all<00:01:41.300> overlapped<00:01:42.300> in

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
this the commands are all overlapped in

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.990 
this the commands are all overlapped in
lines<00:01:42.840> and<00:01:43.140> it's<00:01:43.620> really<00:01:43.950> confusing<00:01:44.100> I'd

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
lines and it's really confusing I'd

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.820 
lines and it's really confusing I'd
recommend<00:01:45.570> using<00:01:45.780> notepad<00:01:46.440> plus<00:01:46.800> plus

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:46.830 
recommend using notepad plus plus

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:48.469 
recommend using notepad plus plus
they'll<00:01:47.340> have<00:01:47.460> that<00:01:47.640> description<00:01:48.270> free

it started out with 2 3 3 4 2 7 2 and it
ends<00:04:38.410> in<00:04:38.500> stuff<00:04:38.710> 1<00:04:38.979> so<00:04:39.250> we<00:04:39.370> got<00:04:39.490> to<00:04:39.610> get<00:04:39.700> it<00:04:39.790> up<00:04:39.940> a

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 
ends in stuff 1 so we got to get it up a

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.810 
ends in stuff 1 so we got to get it up a
number<00:04:41.560> so<00:04:41.800> basically<00:04:42.100> all<00:04:42.220> you<00:04:42.400> got<00:04:42.520> to<00:04:42.610> do<00:04:42.669> is

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:42.820 
number so basically all you got to do is

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:45.180 
number so basically all you got to do is
add<00:04:43.030> one<00:04:43.300> more<00:04:43.540> character<00:04:44.020> in<00:04:44.560> this<00:04:44.740> case<00:04:44.979> I

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:45.190 
add one more character in this case I

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:48.900 
add one more character in this case I
will<00:04:45.400> put<00:04:45.700> my<00:04:46.389> guess<00:04:47.370> and<00:04:48.370> you<00:04:48.520> can<00:04:48.669> do<00:04:48.729> that

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:48.910 
will put my guess and you can do that

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:50.909 
will put my guess and you can do that
