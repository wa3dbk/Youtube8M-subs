00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.359
 and well place everyone is word art 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:09.090
 Finally, this design is because 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:13.019
 little I created a new channel so 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:15.990
 today we find ourselves for my all 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.570
 first video on call of duty and 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.270
 gameplay and no it will not be a video 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.900
 how you have of course that will be good 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.740
 obviously 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:28.070
 a 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:31.860
 a bug a list bug in zombie mode on 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:34.940
 the map closes on 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:37.650
 put his ticket back on the farm for 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.540
 To unlock 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:41.910
 finally to be able to have the box without 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.530
 open the bat door without opening 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.690
 the door but be able to access the box 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.990
 so it's not maybe it's a glitch 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.340
 very very very very well but at least 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:52.560
 it allows you to 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.850
 2 a poor to share from the beginning as soon 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.980
 the beginning of the round 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.390
 so we will know right went after 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.730
 not if I go solo if I go in 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.070
 line 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.370
 we're going to go solo 20 parts 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.370
 custom 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.510
 so that's it 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:14.420
 help survival or goblins 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.930
 we do not care we're going to be 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.930
 easy 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.630
 a good pool 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:24.180
 let's go for the beginning 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.530
 so what can I say about 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.200
 of my new channel then as you 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.210
 could see him young and finally to 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.590
 share this video there I will have no 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.390
 view I had no view I 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.760
 hardly any subscriber I have people 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.330
 to have four there for the moment for the 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.040
 moment four 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.930
 good i know it's not huge i'm doing a 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.050
 video but that number that's busy 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.690
 calmos amos 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:46.310
 I planned and an insult to say of which 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:48.440
 you may have noticed that I was not 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:51.110
 his partners and yes my friends I am 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.940
 youtube partner has zero purpose then the 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.980
 luck well no it's not the 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:57.760
 luck it's just that I have an audience 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:02:01.230
 finally a network for the inactive world 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:04.230
 and I manage it with your dah 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:06.850
 tada is a french publisher a good 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:08.560
 Narbonne was late so 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.649
 I invite you to go see know so 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.470
 that's it for the glitch 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.870
 it will go up there and do the 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:19.879
 box except that the running box 1950 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:23.700
 so we will kill zombies up to 950 

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:26.989
 courteous yes as we are all where 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.989
 she shoot yen horde of zombies 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.060
 yeah that's good 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:37.520
 rosalie people will find to make a 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:39.150
 creeping 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.510
 here soon and 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.510
 and we know well 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:48.310
 meal 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:50.920
 yes no no shit I want to do the 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.080
 creepy months good we do not care so I 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.250
 will show you 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.260
 just the thing to be careful 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.820
 it's good they just have the thing to do 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.940
 attention it's actually you're jumping you 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:04.390
 crouch you do square ok I 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:07.920
 so 100 football is not good 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.920
 and there we could see 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:15.970
 and I have the rpd was dead so that's it 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:19.540
 it's 1.5 just nice enough 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:21.330
 just have 952 tune of points I know 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:24.900
 not how industries 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:26.580
 I do not care you have to have 950 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.890
 least have the money to buy at 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:30.750
 to drink otherwise it does not work because well 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:32.880
 obviously the box cost 950 so 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:35.040
 so here I am going to look for 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.810
 the cough that is there and we have just 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.100
 there but I think it's going to be a 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.260
 little bit difficult to see her 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.550
 so this glyph charge you I you 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.470
 reassure it's not me who found it I 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:47.640
 him on a I saw a video but the 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:49.140
 video was of poor quality 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.990
 I say why not make a budget 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:53.020
 in hd pvr I have a microphone I have everything for 

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:58.540
 make 

00:03:53.020 --> 00:04:01.180
 I have what it takes for just what it 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:02.850
 to make a quality video 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:05.490
 finally not either 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:06.750
 that tea quality but but here 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:08.430
 here it was a little flash for 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.780
 how to have the box 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:13.230
 how to have the weapons of the box 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:15.209
 handle a 1 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.400
 this is closing so here it is 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:18.109
 glitch 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.959
 brand new not new but 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:23.120
