00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
but because it's now in total we can use

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.100 
but because it's now in total we can use
this<00:01:23.430> trick<00:01:23.670> to<00:01:23.850> our<00:01:23.939> advantage<00:01:24.270> and<00:01:24.630> just<00:01:24.659> in

have<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.030> bout<00:01:27.210> 27<00:01:27.960> and<00:01:28.140> I<00:01:28.200> want<00:01:28.439> diamond<00:01:28.890> so

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
have the bout 27 and I want diamond so

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.190 
have the bout 27 and I want diamond so
we<00:01:29.280> go<00:01:29.400> to<00:01:29.460> challenges<00:01:30.270> and<00:01:30.450> I<00:01:30.570> have<00:01:30.720> six<00:01:31.049> of

we go to challenges and I have six of

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.840 
we go to challenges and I have six of
seven<00:01:31.350> challenges<00:01:31.650> completed<00:01:32.340> so<00:01:32.549> I<00:01:32.579> only

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
seven challenges completed so I only

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
so if I got one of these it would

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.810 
so if I got one of these it would
instantly<00:01:48.930> award<00:01:49.439> me<00:01:49.590> with<00:01:49.770> that<00:01:49.920> camo<00:01:50.250> along

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
counter toward diamond camo so it will

royalty camo
it's<00:01:59.909> the<00:02:00.060> exact<00:02:00.450> same<00:02:00.689> method<00:02:01.110> using<00:02:01.409> it<00:02:01.530> for

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
it's the exact same method using it for

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.649 
it's the exact same method using it for
royalty<00:02:02.340> unless<00:02:02.790> of<00:02:02.969> course<00:02:03.030> you<00:02:03.329> wanted<00:02:03.540> to

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
royalty unless of course you wanted to

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.389 
royalty unless of course you wanted to
do<00:02:03.780> all<00:02:03.990> of<00:02:04.020> it<00:02:04.200> in<00:02:04.320> one<00:02:04.530> prestige<00:02:04.829> that's<00:02:05.280> a

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
do all of it in one prestige that's a

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:06.649 
do all of it in one prestige that's a
little<00:02:05.549> bit<00:02:05.700> different<00:02:06.030> I'm<00:02:06.149> not<00:02:06.210> gonna<00:02:06.450> get

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
little bit different I'm not gonna get

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:07.399 
little bit different I'm not gonna get
into<00:02:06.869> that<00:02:06.899> it's

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
into that it's

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.800 
into that it's
same<00:02:07.619> exact<00:02:07.950> concept<00:02:08.160> for<00:02:08.700> royalty<00:02:09.179> camo<00:02:09.599> and

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
same exact concept for royalty camo and

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.390 
same exact concept for royalty camo and
it<00:02:09.959> does<00:02:10.080> get<00:02:10.200> a<00:02:10.259> little<00:02:10.379> bit<00:02:10.590> confusing<00:02:10.979> and<00:02:11.340> a

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
it does get a little bit confusing and a

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.610 
it does get a little bit confusing and a
big<00:02:11.580> shot<00:02:11.790> going<00:02:12.120> to<00:02:12.269> operation<00:02:12.870> Craig<00:02:13.170> as<00:02:13.379> he
