some other picture contents so I'm going
to<00:04:09.180> use<00:04:09.769> the<00:04:10.769> the<00:04:11.160> mapping<00:04:11.669> in<00:04:11.849> this<00:04:12.209> first<00:04:12.569> box

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
to use the the mapping in this first box

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:15.740 
to use the the mapping in this first box
which<00:04:13.349> I<00:04:13.500> have<00:04:13.709> already<00:04:13.889> done<00:04:14.329> got<00:04:15.329> a<00:04:15.360> little
