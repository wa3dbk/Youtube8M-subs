clothes would cost you one ounce of gold
and<00:02:05.700> then<00:02:06.510> if<00:02:06.690> you<00:02:06.780> think<00:02:06.990> today<00:02:07.350> gold<00:02:07.980> is<00:02:08.160> at

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
and then if you think today gold is at

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.770 
and then if you think today gold is at
what<00:02:08.460> eleven<00:02:08.790> hundred<00:02:08.910> dollars<00:02:09.420> well<00:02:09.600> that's

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
what eleven hundred dollars well that's

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.900 
what eleven hundred dollars well that's
roughly<00:02:10.110> the<00:02:10.290> price<00:02:10.440> of<00:02:10.770> a<00:02:10.830> nice<00:02:11.040> Armani<00:02:11.490> suit

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
roughly the price of a nice Armani suit

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.720 
roughly the price of a nice Armani suit
so<00:02:12.750> over<00:02:13.260> all<00:02:13.290> those<00:02:13.620> thousands<00:02:14.190> of<00:02:14.340> years

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
so over all those thousands of years

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.270 
so over all those thousands of years
gold<00:02:15.390> has<00:02:15.570> never<00:02:16.050> lost<00:02:16.350> its<00:02:16.680> purchasing<00:02:17.250> power

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
gold has never lost its purchasing power

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.150 
gold has never lost its purchasing power
right<00:02:18.270> and<00:02:18.480> that<00:02:19.080> is<00:02:19.290> the<00:02:19.440> key<00:02:19.650> that<00:02:19.680> is<00:02:19.950> the

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
right and that is the key that is the

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.800 
right and that is the key that is the
key<00:02:20.370> quality<00:02:20.850> of<00:02:20.970> gold<00:02:21.270> and<00:02:21.480> that's<00:02:21.600> why

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
key quality of gold and that's why

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.870 
key quality of gold and that's why
people<00:02:22.170> buy<00:02:22.350> gold<00:02:22.680> is<00:02:23.100> because<00:02:23.370> it<00:02:23.490> doesn't

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
people buy gold is because it doesn't

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.630 
people buy gold is because it doesn't
lose<00:02:24.090> its<00:02:24.120> purchasing<00:02:25.020> power<00:02:25.050> it<00:02:25.920> retains<00:02:26.370> its

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
lose its purchasing power it retains its

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.570 
lose its purchasing power it retains its
value<00:02:27.090> but<00:02:27.780> just<00:02:28.020> as<00:02:28.140> it<00:02:28.290> retains<00:02:28.770> its<00:02:29.070> value

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
value but just as it retains its value

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.180 
value but just as it retains its value
it<00:02:29.790> doesn't<00:02:30.510> typically<00:02:30.930> over<00:02:31.320> time<00:02:31.560> increase

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
it doesn't typically over time increase

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.690 
it doesn't typically over time increase
its<00:02:32.640> purchase<00:02:33.180> purchasing<00:02:33.840> power<00:02:34.050> right<00:02:34.980> so

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
its purchase purchasing power right so

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.170 
its purchase purchasing power right so
rather<00:02:36.030> than<00:02:36.209> investing<00:02:36.600> in<00:02:37.260> gold<00:02:37.850> it<00:02:38.850> should

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
rather than investing in gold it should

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.690 
rather than investing in gold it should
really<00:02:39.420> be<00:02:39.540> about<00:02:39.959> using<00:02:40.920> gold<00:02:41.160> for<00:02:41.430> what<00:02:41.550> its

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
really be about using gold for what its

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.270 
really be about using gold for what its
typical<00:02:42.440> characteristic<00:02:43.440> is<00:02:43.620> and<00:02:43.860> that<00:02:44.130> has

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
typical characteristic is and that has

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.620 
typical characteristic is and that has
insurance<00:02:44.780> it's<00:02:45.780> insurance<00:02:46.350> against<00:02:47.120> a<00:02:48.120> lack

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
of confidence in government right it's

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.520 
of confidence in government right it's
insurance<00:02:52.860> against<00:02:53.250> financial<00:02:53.489> crisis<00:02:54.530> so

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
insurance against financial crisis so

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.470 
insurance against financial crisis so
over<00:02:55.920> the<00:02:56.010> long<00:02:56.160> term<00:02:56.190> is<00:02:56.580> insurance<00:02:57.060> against

aware<00:03:33.480> that<00:03:33.630> you're<00:03:33.750> speculating<00:03:34.049> and<00:03:35.750> that

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
aware that you're speculating and that

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.289 
aware that you're speculating and that
is<00:03:36.959> not<00:03:37.170> the<00:03:37.290> typical<00:03:37.440> quality<00:03:38.340> of<00:03:38.430> gold<00:03:38.700> right

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:39.299 
is not the typical quality of gold right

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:41.180 
is not the typical quality of gold right
and<00:03:39.510> because<00:03:40.320> you<00:03:40.470> see<00:03:40.769> it<00:03:40.890> as<00:03:40.980> insurance

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
and because you see it as insurance

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.610 
and because you see it as insurance
great<00:03:42.150> thing<00:03:42.390> is<00:03:42.480> a<00:03:42.510> cause<00:03:42.750> you<00:03:42.870> see<00:03:43.019> insurance

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
great thing is a cause you see insurance

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.380 
great thing is a cause you see insurance
then<00:03:44.010> you<00:03:44.130> can<00:03:44.250> be<00:03:44.340> pretty<00:03:44.549> relaxed<00:03:45.060> about<00:03:45.120> how

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
then you can be pretty relaxed about how

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:48.140 
then you can be pretty relaxed about how
the<00:03:45.450> price<00:03:45.750> fluctuates<00:03:46.350> right<00:03:46.950> because<00:03:47.760> you

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
the price fluctuates right because you

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:49.490 
the price fluctuates right because you
know<00:03:48.269> it<00:03:48.480> might<00:03:48.690> go<00:03:48.870> down<00:03:49.019> to<00:03:49.320> eight<00:03:49.470> hundred

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
know it might go down to eight hundred

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.190 
know it might go down to eight hundred
dollars<00:03:49.920> seven<00:03:50.549> hundred<00:03:50.850> dollars<00:03:50.880> may<00:03:51.870> go<00:03:52.019> up

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
dollars seven hundred dollars may go up

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.740 
dollars seven hundred dollars may go up
may<00:03:52.410> go<00:03:52.470> down<00:03:52.970> it<00:03:53.970> doesn't<00:03:54.239> matter<00:03:54.510> because

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
may go down it doesn't matter because

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.199 
may go down it doesn't matter because
it's<00:03:55.110> always<00:03:55.590> going<00:03:55.799> to<00:03:55.860> be<00:03:55.920> insurance<00:03:56.580> you
