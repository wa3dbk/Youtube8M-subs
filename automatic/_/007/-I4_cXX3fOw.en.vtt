00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:10.209
 the legend of the female snake was 

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:12.039
 in front of my eyes and I could not believe it 

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:14.620
 refused to accept the existence of 

00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:16.570
 so awful creature stirring my 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:18.880
 mind and abusing the vision sought the 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:21.519
 trick the fraud that gave rest to me 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.830
 intellect I have never believed in stories 

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:25.779
 of monsters of closets appeared or 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:28.599
 ghosts that at midnight flee their 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:30.400
 presence but the creature in front of me 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:32.920
 I was rubbing the dark side of the 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:35.199
 human existence the terrifying thing that 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.680
 can be some beings of this world or 

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:38.320
 of the other 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.660
 the huge snake unfolded had 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.879
 he remained quiet hiding his head 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:45.070
 between her rings but now her 

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:47.289
 long body showing his human head 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.969
 if something human could be in that 

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:51.190
 demonic beast looking at us 

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:53.440
 visibly disturbed 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.920
 we had interrupted his rest or his 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.149
 dinner as we realized shortly after 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.250
 dislodging his fierce mouth the animal 

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:02.500
 he regurgitated disgustingly what he owed 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.269
 be your prey possibly a small 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.490
 primate or other animal impossible to 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:08.740
 recognize was half digested and 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:11.020
 covered in colorful fluids 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:13.149
 the unimaginable aspect of that face 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.799
 humanized by factions similar to 

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:17.229
 those of a woman's face turned 

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:18.850
 against us threatening we had 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:21.189
 invaded your space and the creature 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:24.100
 she seemed willing to make us pay 

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:26.080
 expensive to have bothered you in your rest not 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.060
 It was show time and in plan 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.770
 mischief we introduced ourselves in the tent 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.689
 of the snake woman 'on the side 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.390
 back and was now facing 

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:36.070
 we horrible and real were right 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.840
 who came that the devil 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.729
 He tricked us into believing that 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.220
 there was who was in front of us 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:44.319
 it was a demon a true demon of 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:46.390
 evil was appreciated in the eyes and in 

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:49.270
 the disgusting and contemptuous gesture 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:51.520
 marked his face to the height of fear 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.950
 and the bewilderment told us that they want 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.479
 the whistling voice hurt in such a way 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.630
 our ears that ended by 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:00.250
 cowering the woman's face was 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.979
 so close to us that we could 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:05.439
 feel its pestiferous breath small 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:08.170
 eyelets without brows or eyelashes 

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:09.910
 two holes in the nose a long mouth 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.980
 that was dilated when I proposed it 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.560
 pronounced chin that gave the touch 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.490
 female of a devils the scales 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.560
 they went down 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:20.080
 so it should be the neck first 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.810
 tiny letters and then in the vivid body 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.700
 thicker and larger they want them to 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.100
 tell the tragic story of how I 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:30.820
 I returned the serpent woman 'to that have 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:33.040
 come is not true how they did not pay their 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:35.440
 entrance ticket interrupted my dinner 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:38.380
 and my rest will have to reward me 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.570
 effort because I am the snake woman ' 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:43.000
 because I became this terrible 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:44.680
 monster a monster that to eyes of 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.140
 who visit me is nothing more than a 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.660
 swindles trick ha ha ha ha ha ha ha 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.490
 ha ha people do not believe in hell or 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:54.400
 witches even if you are facing them to 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:57.070
 point of eating the breasts or the blood 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.110
 paralyzed we listened to the beast in 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:01.600
 truth my brain refused to believe it 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.430
 even now I'm not entirely certain if I 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.920
 happened it was nothing more than a hysteria 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:08.590
 collective a hallucination in a group of the 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.600
 that so much is talked about in psychology the 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.400
 female snake 'was shown in all its 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.890
 ferocity by horribly opening the 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.840
 mouthpiece was unreal when it happened 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.850
 we thought he would start to devour us 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.050
 when we saw her long body next to 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:22.690
 we 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:25.150
 the monster just always exclaimed 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:27.340
 start disobeying I started 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:30.310
 with small evils that later 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:32.230
 they were aberrant criminal acts now 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:34.420
 I have to feed me carrion and 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:36.670
 dead animals I do not deny that I was 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:39.730
 you want creatures like you smell 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:41.650
 delicious should know that by my acts 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:44.710
 I was condemned to the misery of this 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:46.240
 monstrous body I destroyed my family to 

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:48.340
 my mother devoured her for days 

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:50.890
 savoring their entrails their sweets 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:53.110
 entrails when I finished I saw myself in the 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:55.090
 way that you are now condemned to 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:57.130
 crawling on the ground and sentenced to 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:00.100
 Unfortunately grab my warning to 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:01.690
 the others the snake woman opened so 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:04.990
 big his snout that I had the impression 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:07.120
 that would engulf us in one bite we ran 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:09.340
 we run like soul that pursues the 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.470
 Devil we do not stop running until we're 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:14.110
 sure the terrible monster was 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:17.730
 too far in his tent going back to 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:17.730
 gobble the dinner we interrupted
