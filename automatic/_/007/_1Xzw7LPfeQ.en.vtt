water to change the brightness and this

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.039 
water to change the brightness and this
is<00:01:29.880> really<00:01:30.150> convenient<00:01:30.540> at<00:01:31.259> times<00:01:32.930> you<00:01:33.930> can

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
ossified from the right it will open up

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.940 
ossified from the right it will open up
the<00:01:48.119> toggles<00:01:48.720> so<00:01:48.960> that's<00:01:49.170> also<00:01:49.439> convenient<00:01:49.860> at

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
the toggles so that's also convenient at

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.319 
the toggles so that's also convenient at
times<00:01:49.979> in<00:01:50.310> case<00:01:50.460> you're<00:01:50.610> not<00:01:50.640> jump<00:01:50.939> to<00:01:51.090> toggle

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
times in case you're not jump to toggle

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:55.640 
times in case you're not jump to toggle
so<00:01:51.659> notifications

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:55.650 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:58.770 

so<00:01:56.650> we<00:01:56.800> do<00:01:56.950> get<00:01:57.130> 3<00:01:57.310> 50<00:01:57.640> megabyte<00:01:58.090> or<00:01:58.270> free<00:01:58.540> ram

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
so we do get 3 50 megabyte or free ram

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.480 
so we do get 3 50 megabyte or free ram
available<00:01:59.440> at<00:01:59.560> this<00:01:59.710> time<00:01:59.770> with<00:02:00.100> some<00:02:00.280> apps

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
available at this time with some apps

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.790 
available at this time with some apps
running<00:02:00.730> in<00:02:00.910> the<00:02:01.030> background<00:02:01.180> and<00:02:01.630> also<00:02:02.620> do

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:02.800 
running in the background and also do

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.140 
running in the background and also do
take<00:02:02.980> a<00:02:03.010> known<00:02:03.250> that<00:02:03.430> the<00:02:03.490> Settings<00:02:03.820> app<00:02:04.000> is

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:04.150 
take a known that the Settings app is

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.770 
take a known that the Settings app is
actually<00:02:04.510> taking<00:02:04.840> up<00:02:04.990> 41<00:02:05.440> megabytes<00:02:06.130> so<00:02:06.730> in<00:02:07.090> so

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
actually taking up 41 megabytes so in so

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.499 
actually taking up 41 megabytes so in so
in<00:02:08.020> all<00:02:08.440> in<00:02:08.590> all<00:02:08.710> you<00:02:08.860> get<00:02:09.070> around<00:02:09.430> about<00:02:09.880> 400m

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
in all in all you get around about 400m

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:12.060 
in all in all you get around about 400m
megabytes<00:02:10.990> with<00:02:11.230> some<00:02:11.410> apps<00:02:11.590> running<00:02:11.800> in<00:02:11.950> the

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.070 
megabytes with some apps running in the

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:13.770 
megabytes with some apps running in the
background<00:02:12.190> so<00:02:12.970> that's<00:02:13.150> really<00:02:13.300> great<00:02:13.570> for

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
background so that's really great for

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.440 
background so that's really great for
multitasking<00:02:14.080> so<00:02:14.530> you<00:02:14.620> won't<00:02:14.800> find

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
multitasking so you won't find

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.190 
multitasking so you won't find
applicants<00:02:16.450> you<00:02:16.870> won't<00:02:17.110> find<00:02:17.320> after<00:02:17.560> learning

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
applicants you won't find after learning

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.660 
applicants you won't find after learning
also<00:02:20.200> in<00:02:20.440> cm<00:02:20.710> tall<00:02:20.920> you<00:02:21.040> have<00:02:21.160> a<00:02:21.190> button<00:02:21.580> to

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
also in cm tall you have a button to

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.220 
also in cm tall you have a button to
close<00:02:21.910> all<00:02:22.120> the<00:02:22.240> running<00:02:22.510> application<00:02:22.660> which

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
close all the running application which

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:24.930 
close all the running application which
was<00:02:23.380> missing<00:02:23.710> in<00:02:23.830> the<00:02:23.980> stock<00:02:24.280> lollipop<00:02:24.730> update

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
was missing in the stock lollipop update

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.449 
was missing in the stock lollipop update
and<00:02:25.930> it's<00:02:26.110> really<00:02:26.380> convenient<00:02:26.709> you<00:02:27.250> don't

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
and it's really convenient you don't

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:30.090

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
application case you have a lot of

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.270 
application case you have a lot of
running<00:02:31.780> applications<00:02:32.380> and<00:02:32.590> you<00:02:32.980> just<00:02:33.100> want

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
running applications and you just want

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.000 
running applications and you just want
