00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:12.410 

in<00:00:10.290> a<00:00:10.440> previous<00:00:10.620> video<00:00:11.010> I<00:00:11.430> took<00:00:11.550> a<00:00:11.730> look<00:00:11.940> at<00:00:12.120> how

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
in a previous video I took a look at how

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.950 
in a previous video I took a look at how
to<00:00:12.480> configure<00:00:13.170> start8<00:00:14.070> to<00:00:15.000> add<00:00:15.210> a<00:00:15.240> start<00:00:15.780> menu

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
to configure start8 to add a start menu

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.760 
to configure start8 to add a start menu
to<00:00:16.590> Windows<00:00:16.950> 8<00:00:17.750> now<00:00:18.750> the<00:00:18.810> thing<00:00:18.900> about<00:00:19.230> start<00:00:19.590> 8

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
to Windows 8 now the thing about start 8

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.060 
to Windows 8 now the thing about start 8
is<00:00:19.980> compared<00:00:20.580> to<00:00:20.700> you<00:00:20.759> say<00:00:20.970> classic<00:00:21.599> shell

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:22.070 
is compared to you say classic shell

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:24.679 
is compared to you say classic shell
it's<00:00:23.070> obviously<00:00:23.790> much<00:00:24.060> more<00:00:24.119> expensive

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
it's obviously much more expensive

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.380 
it's obviously much more expensive
classic<00:00:25.439> shell<00:00:25.619> as<00:00:25.739> free<00:00:26.070> start<00:00:26.700> eight<00:00:26.910> is

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
classic shell as free start eight is

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.200 
classic shell as free start eight is
five<00:00:27.689> dollars<00:00:28.700> so<00:00:29.700> you<00:00:29.790> might<00:00:30.000> be<00:00:30.060> asking

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
five dollars so you might be asking

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.410 
five dollars so you might be asking
yourself<00:00:30.630> why<00:00:31.439> considering<00:00:32.340> it<00:00:32.460> has<00:00:32.640> actually

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
yourself why considering it has actually

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.930 
yourself why considering it has actually
much<00:00:34.079> less<00:00:34.530> in<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:34.800> way<00:00:34.890> of<00:00:35.130> configuration

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
much less in the way of configuration

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.620 
much less in the way of configuration
options<00:00:37.280> would<00:00:38.280> you<00:00:38.430> pay<00:00:38.610> five<00:00:38.910> dollars<00:00:38.940> for

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:39.630 
options would you pay five dollars for

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:41.450 
options would you pay five dollars for
something<00:00:39.930> you<00:00:40.020> can<00:00:40.230> more<00:00:40.590> or<00:00:40.649> less<00:00:40.890> get<00:00:41.220> for

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
something you can more or less get for

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.870 
something you can more or less get for
free<00:00:41.640> with<00:00:42.570> classic<00:00:43.050> show<00:00:43.260> and<00:00:43.880> actually

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:44.880 
free with classic show and actually

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.080 
free with classic show and actually
there<00:00:45.420> is<00:00:45.600> a<00:00:45.630> good<00:00:45.930> reason<00:00:45.990> to<00:00:46.440> do<00:00:46.590> it<00:00:46.910> just<00:00:47.910> not

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
there is a good reason to do it just not

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.990 
there is a good reason to do it just not
necessarily<00:00:48.930> for<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.230> traditional<00:00:50.000> Windows

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
necessarily for the traditional Windows

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.200 
necessarily for the traditional Windows
desktop<00:00:51.960> environment<00:00:55.280> the<00:00:56.280> obvious<00:00:56.700> argument

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
desktop environment the obvious argument

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.000 
desktop environment the obvious argument
for<00:00:57.420> getting<00:00:57.540> rid<00:00:57.870> of<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.050> Start<00:00:58.410> menu<00:00:58.470> is

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
for getting rid of the Start menu is

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.069 
for getting rid of the Start menu is
that<00:00:59.280> it's<00:00:59.430> not<00:00:59.610> particularly<00:01:00.150> compatible

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
that it's not particularly compatible

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.369 
that it's not particularly compatible
with<00:01:01.620> a<00:01:01.650> touchscreen<00:01:02.090> sure<00:01:03.090> you<00:01:03.329> can<00:01:03.570> touch

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
with a touchscreen sure you can touch

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.380 
with a touchscreen sure you can touch
the<00:01:04.650> start<00:01:04.920> button<00:01:05.159> but<00:01:05.880> then<00:01:06.030> you<00:01:06.180> have<00:01:06.360> to

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
the start button but then you have to

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.800 
the start button but then you have to
wade<00:01:07.020> through<00:01:07.049> menus<00:01:07.649> and<00:01:08.369> click<00:01:09.149> on<00:01:09.299> little

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
wade through menus and click on little

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.960 
wade through menus and click on little
things<00:01:09.840> with<00:01:10.350> your<00:01:10.530> finger<00:01:10.950> but<00:01:11.579> aren't

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
things with your finger but aren't

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.969 
things with your finger but aren't
necessarily<00:01:12.540> all<00:01:12.870> that<00:01:12.900> convenient<00:01:13.740> to<00:01:13.830> get

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
necessarily all that convenient to get

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.840 
necessarily all that convenient to get
to<00:01:14.900> but<00:01:15.900> what<00:01:16.110> if<00:01:16.140> instead<00:01:16.530> you<00:01:17.220> could<00:01:17.610> have

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
to but what if instead you could have

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.570 
to but what if instead you could have
something<00:01:18.390> of<00:01:18.510> a<00:01:18.600> hybrid<00:01:19.140> of<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:20.220> windows

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
something of a hybrid of the windows

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.149 
something of a hybrid of the windows
start<00:01:20.909> menu<00:01:21.030> and<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:22.470> new<00:01:22.620> Windows<00:01:22.950> 8<00:01:23.130> Start

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
start menu and the new Windows 8 Start

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.530 
start menu and the new Windows 8 Start
screen<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:24.120> in<00:01:25.020> fact<00:01:25.260> that's<00:01:26.040> what<00:01:26.540> start8

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
screen and in fact that's what start8

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.780 
screen and in fact that's what start8
allows<00:01:27.960> you<00:01:28.200> to<00:01:28.320> do<00:01:28.500> and<00:01:28.799> if<00:01:29.159> you're<00:01:29.460> going<00:01:29.640> to

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
allows you to do and if you're going to

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.660 
allows you to do and if you're going to
pay<00:01:29.970> for<00:01:30.000> it<00:01:30.450> aside<00:01:31.200> from<00:01:31.440> a<00:01:31.830> lot<00:01:32.520> of

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
pay for it aside from a lot of

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.450 
pay for it aside from a lot of
simplicity<00:01:33.210> in<00:01:33.690> configuration<00:01:34.530> that<00:01:34.950> would

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
simplicity in configuration that would

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.910 
simplicity in configuration that would
be<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:36.479> best<00:01:36.720> argument<00:01:37.320> I<00:01:37.380> could<00:01:37.590> come<00:01:37.770> up

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
be the best argument I could come up

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.490 
be the best argument I could come up
with<00:01:38.360> so<00:01:39.360> let's<00:01:39.540> take<00:01:39.750> a<00:01:39.780> look<00:01:39.990> real<00:01:40.229> quick<00:01:40.260> at

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
with so let's take a look real quick at

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.660 
with so let's take a look real quick at
the<00:01:40.650> configuration<00:01:41.520> options<00:01:43.369> for<00:01:44.369> start

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
the configuration options for start

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:53.070 
the configuration options for start
eight<00:01:46.400> and<00:01:48.799> see<00:01:49.799> what<00:01:49.950> I'm<00:01:50.040> talking<00:01:50.070> about

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.080 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.010 

so<00:01:53.740> on<00:01:53.890> these<00:01:54.070> style<00:01:54.850> settings<00:01:55.450> the<00:01:55.630> basic

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
so on these style settings the basic

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.250 
so on these style settings the basic
settings<00:01:57.000> instead<00:01:58.000> of<00:01:58.150> choosing<00:01:58.540> the<00:01:58.840> windows

00:01:59.250 --> 00:01:59.260 
settings instead of choosing the windows

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.640 
settings instead of choosing the windows
seven<00:01:59.650> style<00:02:00.690> let's<00:02:01.690> go<00:02:01.930> with<00:02:02.050> the<00:02:02.170> windows<00:02:02.470> 8

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:02.650 
seven style let's go with the windows 8

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:06.300 
seven style let's go with the windows 8
style<00:02:03.390> now<00:02:04.390> you'll<00:02:04.600> notice<00:02:04.690> that<00:02:05.020> the<00:02:05.860> options

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
style now you'll notice that the options

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.950 
style now you'll notice that the options
now<00:02:06.520> change<00:02:06.910> to<00:02:07.710> small<00:02:08.710> tall<00:02:09.220> wide<00:02:09.910> large<00:02:10.630> or

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:10.960 
now change to small tall wide large or

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:13.410 
now change to small tall wide large or
full<00:02:11.350> screen<00:02:11.740> and<00:02:12.240> default<00:02:13.240> to<00:02:13.390> the

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
full screen and default to the

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.910 
full screen and default to the
applications<00:02:14.170> view<00:02:15.210> once<00:02:16.210> again<00:02:16.450> we<00:02:16.600> have<00:02:16.780> the

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
applications view once again we have the

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.610 
applications view once again we have the
flag<00:02:17.920> or<00:02:18.280> start<00:02:18.730> eight<00:02:19.110> options<00:02:20.110> for<00:02:20.350> what<00:02:20.500> the

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
flag or start eight options for what the

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.170 
flag or start eight options for what the
start<00:02:20.860> button<00:02:21.100> is<00:02:21.220> going<00:02:21.490> to<00:02:21.610> look<00:02:21.760> like<00:02:21.790> and

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
start button is going to look like and

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.360 
start button is going to look like and
I'm<00:02:22.270> not<00:02:22.420> going<00:02:22.630> to<00:02:22.720> cover<00:02:22.900> those<00:02:23.140> here<00:02:23.560> but

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
I'm not going to cover those here but

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:25.740 
I'm not going to cover those here but
let's<00:02:24.580> take<00:02:24.790> a<00:02:24.820> look<00:02:25.030> at<00:02:25.150> the<00:02:25.270> start<00:02:25.540> menu

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
let's take a look at the start menu

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.690 
let's take a look at the start menu
itself<00:02:26.290> so<00:02:27.160> let's<00:02:27.340> start<00:02:27.610> with<00:02:27.790> small<00:02:28.300> and

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
itself so let's start with small and

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.220 
itself so let's start with small and
we're<00:02:30.700> going<00:02:30.940> to<00:02:31.060> leave<00:02:31.240> the<00:02:31.390> default<00:02:31.750> option

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
we're going to leave the default option

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:38.670 
we're going to leave the default option
of<00:02:32.380> the<00:02:33.000> applications<00:02:34.000> view<00:02:34.300> selected<00:02:37.470> so<00:02:38.470> now

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
of the applications view selected so now

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.830 
of the applications view selected so now
you'll<00:02:39.610> notice<00:02:39.820> that<00:02:40.030> essentially<00:02:40.660> what<00:02:40.810> i

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
you'll notice that essentially what i

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.550 
you'll notice that essentially what i
have<00:02:41.140> in<00:02:41.380> place<00:02:41.680> of<00:02:41.740> a<00:02:42.010> start<00:02:42.340> menu<00:02:42.520> is

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
have in place of a start menu is

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.560 
have in place of a start menu is
actually<00:02:44.560> the<00:02:44.709> start<00:02:44.950> screen<00:02:45.180> and<00:02:46.180> this<00:02:46.420> is

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570 
actually the start screen and this is

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:48.180 
actually the start screen and this is
the<00:02:46.690> expanded<00:02:47.320> view<00:02:47.500> of<00:02:47.620> the<00:02:47.740> start<00:02:48.010> screen

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
the expanded view of the start screen

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.760 
the expanded view of the start screen
that<00:02:48.520> shows<00:02:48.550> you<00:02:49.410> essentially<00:02:50.410> everything

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:50.770 
that shows you essentially everything

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:52.380 
that shows you essentially everything
that<00:02:51.100> would<00:02:51.220> be<00:02:51.370> in<00:02:51.640> your<00:02:51.700> start<00:02:52.330> menu

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
that would be in your start menu

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.020 
that would be in your start menu
although<00:02:53.200> not<00:02:53.650> quite<00:02:53.830> as<00:02:54.040> nicely<00:02:54.340> organized

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
although not quite as nicely organized

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.630 
although not quite as nicely organized
because<00:02:55.270> you<00:02:55.570> don't<00:02:55.750> have<00:02:55.810> folders<00:02:56.519> but<00:02:57.519> in

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
because you don't have folders but in

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.600 
because you don't have folders but in
this<00:02:57.760> case<00:02:58.030> the<00:02:58.360> point<00:02:58.660> is<00:02:58.980> you<00:02:59.980> don't<00:03:00.130> want

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
this case the point is you don't want

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.630 
this case the point is you don't want
folders<00:03:01.180> so<00:03:01.420> much<00:03:01.600> as<00:03:01.750> you<00:03:01.900> want<00:03:02.110> convenience

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
folders so much as you want convenience

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.729 
folders so much as you want convenience
for<00:03:03.640> a<00:03:03.700> touch<00:03:03.910> interface<00:03:04.290> so<00:03:05.290> if<00:03:05.410> you're<00:03:05.560> using

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 
for a touch interface so if you're using

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:07.500 
for a touch interface so if you're using
a<00:03:05.920> touchscreen<00:03:06.160> opening<00:03:06.850> folders<00:03:07.330> is

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
a touchscreen opening folders is

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.979 
a touchscreen opening folders is
probably<00:03:07.900> less<00:03:08.230> useful<00:03:08.590> than<00:03:09.720> just<00:03:10.720> seeing

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:10.989 
probably less useful than just seeing

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:15.509 
probably less useful than just seeing
this<00:03:11.170> list<00:03:11.500> of<00:03:12.989> tiles<00:03:13.989> representing<00:03:14.769> your

this list of tiles representing your

this list of tiles representing your

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
program shortcuts let's go ahead and go

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:22.020 
program shortcuts let's go ahead and go
back<00:03:19.450> here<00:03:19.810> and<00:03:20.400> we'll<00:03:21.400> uncheck<00:03:21.610> the

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
back here and we'll uncheck the

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:26.280 
back here and we'll uncheck the
applications<00:03:22.720> view<00:03:24.690> so<00:03:25.690> now<00:03:25.870> what<00:03:26.110> you<00:03:26.260> have

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
applications view so now what you have

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.030 
applications view so now what you have
is<00:03:27.239> the<00:03:28.239> basic<00:03:28.600> start<00:03:28.870> screen<00:03:29.200> so<00:03:29.560> if<00:03:29.739> all<00:03:29.890> you

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
is the basic start screen so if all you

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.759 
is the basic start screen so if all you
want<00:03:30.220> to<00:03:30.280> do<00:03:30.459> is<00:03:30.670> open<00:03:31.330> basic<00:03:32.019> programs<00:03:32.530> that

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:32.769 
want to do is open basic programs that

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:35.790 
want to do is open basic programs that
you're<00:03:32.890> going<00:03:33.100> to<00:03:33.190> see<00:03:33.370> all<00:03:33.519> the<00:03:33.670> time<00:03:34.800> that's

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:35.800 
you're going to see all the time that's

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.620 
you're going to see all the time that's
what<00:03:36.010> you're<00:03:36.190> going<00:03:36.340> to<00:03:36.459> want<00:03:36.550> to<00:03:36.640> use<00:03:36.700> if<00:03:37.180> you

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:37.630 
what you're going to want to use if you

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:40.380 
what you're going to want to use if you

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
applications that applications view is

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:47.970 
applications that applications view is
what<00:03:46.720> you're<00:03:46.870> going<00:03:47.019> to<00:03:47.170> want<00:03:47.290> to<00:03:47.380> use<00:03:47.590> in<00:03:47.860> my

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
what you're going to want to use in my

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:49.259 
what you're going to want to use in my
case<00:03:48.220> I'm<00:03:48.430> going<00:03:48.459> to<00:03:48.730> go<00:03:48.850> ahead<00:03:48.880> and<00:03:49.120> leave

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:49.269 
case I'm going to go ahead and leave

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:51.780 
case I'm going to go ahead and leave
that<00:03:49.299> off<00:03:49.739> but<00:03:50.739> let's<00:03:51.310> look<00:03:51.519> at<00:03:51.670> the<00:03:51.760> other

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
that off but let's look at the other

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:57.810 
that off but let's look at the other
options<00:03:54.360> for<00:03:55.360> how<00:03:55.480> you<00:03:55.510> can<00:03:55.810> make<00:03:55.959> that<00:03:56.820> Start

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:57.820 
options for how you can make that Start

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:04.770 
options for how you can make that Start
screen<00:03:58.090> menu<00:03:58.930> appear

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:04.780 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:10.540 

so<00:04:05.780> here<00:04:06.050> we<00:04:06.200> have<00:04:06.230> our<00:04:07.780> tall<00:04:08.780> view<00:04:09.260> a<00:04:09.550> little

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:10.550 
so here we have our tall view a little

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:13.089 
so here we have our tall view a little
bit<00:04:10.700> more<00:04:10.849> like<00:04:11.090> a<00:04:11.410> traditional<00:04:12.410> start<00:04:12.769> menu

00:04:13.089 --> 00:04:13.099 
bit more like a traditional start menu

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:14.589 
bit more like a traditional start menu
in<00:04:13.220> terms<00:04:13.459> of<00:04:13.610> how<00:04:13.790> much<00:04:13.970> stuff<00:04:14.300> shows<00:04:14.569> up

00:04:14.589 --> 00:04:14.599 
in terms of how much stuff shows up

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:16.509 
in terms of how much stuff shows up
there<00:04:15.050> without<00:04:15.230> actually<00:04:15.980> using<00:04:16.010> a<00:04:16.370> bunch

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:16.519 
there without actually using a bunch

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:19.990 
there without actually using a bunch
more<00:04:16.790> whip<00:04:17.090> and<00:04:17.799> just<00:04:18.799> to<00:04:18.950> show<00:04:19.310> how<00:04:19.639> this

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 
more whip and just to show how this

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.570 
more whip and just to show how this
might<00:04:20.180> be<00:04:20.389> a<00:04:20.660> little<00:04:21.320> bit<00:04:21.560> more<00:04:21.709> convenient<00:04:22.220> in

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
might be a little bit more convenient in

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:33.610 
might be a little bit more convenient in
terms<00:04:22.880> of<00:04:31.060> using<00:04:32.060> it<00:04:32.180> as<00:04:32.419> a<00:04:32.750> start<00:04:33.320> menu

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:33.620 
terms of using it as a start menu

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:35.620 
terms of using it as a start menu
replacement<00:04:34.520> so<00:04:34.700> for<00:04:34.880> example<00:04:34.940> maybe<00:04:35.419> you

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.630 
replacement so for example maybe you

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:38.740 
replacement so for example maybe you
have<00:04:35.870> a<00:04:36.520> tablet<00:04:37.520> but<00:04:37.880> you're<00:04:38.060> still<00:04:38.360> primarily

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:38.750 
have a tablet but you're still primarily

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:41.860 
have a tablet but you're still primarily
using<00:04:39.410> desktop<00:04:39.700> applications<00:04:40.700> if<00:04:40.940> you're

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:41.870 
using desktop applications if you're

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:46.240 
using desktop applications if you're

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:51.320 
with this new start menu maybe you

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:53.850 
with this new start menu maybe you
decide<00:04:51.680> that<00:04:51.710> you<00:04:52.040> want<00:04:52.250> to<00:04:52.310> drag<00:04:52.760> your

convenient<00:05:57.050> about<00:05:57.289> this<00:05:57.620> is<00:05:57.889> let's<00:05:58.580> say<00:05:58.789> you

00:05:58.930 --> 00:05:58.940 
convenient about this is let's say you

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:02.110 
convenient about this is let's say you
have<00:05:59.389> a<00:05:59.690> computer<00:06:00.500> that<00:06:00.650> you<00:06:00.950> use<00:06:01.220> primarily

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:02.120 
have a computer that you use primarily

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:05.650 
have a computer that you use primarily
as<00:06:02.450> a<00:06:02.479> tablet<00:06:02.979> but<00:06:03.979> maybe<00:06:04.250> you<00:06:04.550> want<00:06:05.030> to<00:06:05.150> have<00:06:05.330> a

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:05.660 
as a tablet but maybe you want to have a

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:08.920 
as a tablet but maybe you want to have a
few<00:06:06.410> desktop<00:06:06.889> applications<00:06:07.729> available<00:06:07.940> in

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:08.930 
few desktop applications available in

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:12.100 
few desktop applications available in
your<00:06:09.470> tablet<00:06:09.889> configuration<00:06:10.930> let's<00:06:11.930> say

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:12.110 
your tablet configuration let's say

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:14.050 
your tablet configuration let's say
maybe<00:06:12.349> it's<00:06:12.560> a<00:06:12.680> hybrid<00:06:13.130> so<00:06:13.340> you're<00:06:13.610> using<00:06:13.789> it

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:14.060 
maybe it's a hybrid so you're using it

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:17.050 
maybe it's a hybrid so you're using it
as<00:06:14.150> a<00:06:14.180> tablet<00:06:14.470> but<00:06:15.470> you<00:06:15.740> plug<00:06:16.310> it<00:06:16.430> into<00:06:16.580> a<00:06:16.700> key

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:17.060 
as a tablet but you plug it into a key

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:19.930 
as a tablet but you plug it into a key
or<00:06:17.150> doc<00:06:17.389> and<00:06:17.630> also<00:06:17.990> use<00:06:18.200> it<00:06:18.350> as<00:06:18.440> a<00:06:18.500> laptop<00:06:19.010> so

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:19.940 
or doc and also use it as a laptop so

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:23.740 
or doc and also use it as a laptop so
now<00:06:20.150> with<00:06:20.450> some<00:06:20.660> simple<00:06:20.900> configuration<00:06:22.750> you

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:23.750 
now with some simple configuration you

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:27.129 
now with some simple configuration you
can<00:06:23.960> use<00:06:24.169> your<00:06:24.590> Start<00:06:25.520> screen<00:06:25.720> style<00:06:26.720> start

00:06:27.129 --> 00:06:27.139 
can use your Start screen style start

00:06:27.139 --> 00:06:30.820 
can use your Start screen style start
menu<00:06:27.580> or<00:06:28.580> you<00:06:29.330> can<00:06:29.510> quickly<00:06:29.750> jump<00:06:29.960> back<00:06:30.440> to

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:30.830 
menu or you can quickly jump back to

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:33.909 
menu or you can quickly jump back to
your<00:06:30.950> windows<00:06:31.310> seven<00:06:31.669> style<00:06:31.970> start<00:06:32.360> menu<00:06:32.919> when

00:06:33.909 --> 00:06:33.919 
your windows seven style start menu when

00:06:33.919 --> 00:06:35.770 
your windows seven style start menu when
you<00:06:33.950> plug<00:06:34.280> it<00:06:34.400> into<00:06:34.520> your<00:06:34.610> dock<00:06:34.940> and<00:06:35.240> use<00:06:35.510> it<00:06:35.690> as

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:35.780 
you plug it into your dock and use it as

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:40.360 
you plug it into your dock and use it as
a<00:06:35.810> laptop<00:06:37.330> so<00:06:38.330> really<00:06:38.720> the<00:06:39.530> big<00:06:39.710> advantage<00:06:40.190> to

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:40.370 
a laptop so really the big advantage to

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:42.730 
a laptop so really the big advantage to
start<00:06:40.669> eight<00:06:40.880> and<00:06:41.150> if<00:06:41.990> I<00:06:42.110> were<00:06:42.230> paying<00:06:42.500> five

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:42.740 
start eight and if I were paying five

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:44.530 
start eight and if I were paying five
dollars<00:06:43.160> for<00:06:43.490> it<00:06:43.520> which<00:06:43.820> isn't<00:06:44.270> an

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:44.540 
dollars for it which isn't an

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:46.960 
dollars for it which isn't an
unreasonable<00:06:45.169> amount<00:06:45.260> of<00:06:45.590> money<00:06:45.860> except<00:06:46.790> that

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:46.970 
unreasonable amount of money except that

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:49.270 
unreasonable amount of money except that
the<00:06:47.270> comparison<00:06:47.930> really<00:06:48.290> is<00:06:48.410> to<00:06:48.620> free

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:49.280 
the comparison really is to free

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:51.850 
the comparison really is to free
programs<00:06:49.790> the<00:06:50.690> big<00:06:50.870> advantage<00:06:51.350> is<00:06:51.470> going<00:06:51.770> to

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:51.860 
programs the big advantage is going to

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:54.340 
programs the big advantage is going to
be<00:06:52.040> when<00:06:52.639> you<00:06:52.669> want<00:06:53.090> some<00:06:53.600> of<00:06:53.630> that<00:06:53.780> tablet

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:54.350 
be when you want some of that tablet

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:56.050 
be when you want some of that tablet
interface<00:06:54.530> to<00:06:54.919> be<00:06:55.070> there<00:06:55.310> but<00:06:55.880> not

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:56.060 
interface to be there but not

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:57.969 
interface to be there but not
necessarily<00:06:56.630> all<00:06:56.990> of<00:06:57.290> it<00:06:57.410> you<00:06:57.560> don't<00:06:57.740> want<00:06:57.800> to

00:06:57.969 --> 00:06:57.979 
necessarily all of it you don't want to

00:06:57.979 --> 00:06:59.950 
necessarily all of it you don't want to
be<00:06:58.070> confined<00:06:58.639> to<00:06:58.760> the<00:06:58.880> tablet<00:06:59.270> interface<00:06:59.450> and

00:06:59.950 --> 00:06:59.960 
be confined to the tablet interface and

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:03.180 
be confined to the tablet interface and
in<00:07:00.740> a<00:07:00.830> lot<00:07:00.979> of<00:07:01.010> ways<00:07:01.310> I<00:07:01.490> guess<00:07:01.700> I<00:07:01.940> look<00:07:02.510> at<00:07:02.720> it<00:07:02.870> as

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:03.190 
in a lot of ways I guess I look at it as

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:08.590 
in a lot of ways I guess I look at it as
the<00:07:04.190> start<00:07:05.000> screen<00:07:05.270> style<00:07:05.960> start<00:07:06.350> menu<00:07:07.600> being

the start screen style start menu being

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:10.750 
the start screen style start menu being
perhaps<00:07:08.900> the<00:07:09.410> the<00:07:09.710> interface<00:07:10.220> that<00:07:10.460> it<00:07:10.610> would

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:10.760 
perhaps the the interface that it would

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:13.030 
perhaps the the interface that it would
have<00:07:10.850> made<00:07:11.000> sense<00:07:11.660> for<00:07:11.780> Microsoft<00:07:12.500> to<00:07:12.650> go<00:07:12.800> with

have made sense for Microsoft to go with
