00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.190 
powder I didn't have as much control as
I<00:03:11.950> wanted<00:03:12.430> and<00:03:12.850> sometimes<00:03:13.330> my<00:03:13.600> brows<00:03:13.900> would

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
I wanted and sometimes my brows would

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.770 
I wanted and sometimes my brows would
just<00:03:14.350> go<00:03:14.470> that<00:03:15.370> literally<00:03:15.880> just<00:03:16.299> look<00:03:16.600> like

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
just go that literally just look like

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.380 
just go that literally just look like
really<00:03:17.230> fat<00:03:17.560> and<00:03:17.830> I'd<00:03:18.070> have<00:03:18.220> to<00:03:18.370> rub<00:03:19.000> it<00:03:19.030> off

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
really fat and I'd have to rub it off

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:21.660 
really fat and I'd have to rub it off
and<00:03:19.660> start<00:03:19.959> again<00:03:20.260> and<00:03:20.440> just<00:03:20.560> be<00:03:20.799> a<00:03:21.070> little<00:03:21.430> bit

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 
and start again and just be a little bit

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.850 
and start again and just be a little bit
more<00:03:21.880> careful<00:03:22.329> for<00:03:22.570> this<00:03:22.720> so<00:03:22.989> I'm<00:03:23.140> feeling

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:23.860 
more careful for this so I'm feeling

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:25.890 
more careful for this so I'm feeling
that<00:03:24.310> this<00:03:24.489> may<00:03:24.730> give<00:03:25.000> me<00:03:25.239> a<00:03:25.269> little<00:03:25.540> bit<00:03:25.720> more

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
that this may give me a little bit more

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.650 
that this may give me a little bit more
control<00:03:26.350> I<00:03:26.530> also<00:03:26.799> got<00:03:27.430> just<00:03:28.060> in<00:03:28.209> case<00:03:28.450> that

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
control I also got just in case that

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:31.920 
control I also got just in case that
that<00:03:28.870> was<00:03:29.470> i<00:03:29.680> Rimmel<00:03:30.370> eyebrow<00:03:31.360> pencil

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:32.280 
when you get other care and then I think

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:35.720 
when you get other care and then I think
about<00:06:32.580> a<00:06:32.940> couple<00:06:33.419> of<00:06:33.540> like<00:06:33.900> random<00:06:34.500> colors<00:06:34.950> and

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:35.730 
about a couple of like random colors and

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:38.510 
about a couple of like random colors and
my<00:06:36.120> mom<00:06:36.450> showed<00:06:37.200> me<00:06:37.350> her<00:06:37.560> toes<00:06:37.860> the<00:06:38.160> other<00:06:38.280> day

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:41.070 
and they were gel sparkly and I think it

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:43.070 
and they were gel sparkly and I think it
was<00:06:41.160> on<00:06:41.280> the<00:06:41.370> same<00:06:41.550> brand<00:06:41.910> and<00:06:42.300> they<00:06:42.870> looked
