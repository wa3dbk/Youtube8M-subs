 the channel as we confirm the name and 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.420

 this new installment of the saga the most 

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:32.119
 important what you're seeing in the 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:36.199

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:39.079
 October in one and playstation 4 and autumn 

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:41.060
 of 2015 I started that is not going out in the 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:44.630
 same date 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:47.920
 for consoles that for computer and it will be 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:50.210
 the first delivery is obvious 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:53.860
 totally the last generation of 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:56.180
 consoles again so pay attention because 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:58.910
 important things that we have been able to see 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:01.730
 Well, the game will set something 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:04.460
 quite important in england of 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:06.890
 the Victorian era and in it we will have the 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.750
 new tool with hook shape 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.540
 that will allow us to move with greater 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.220
 freedom for the city weapons too 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:16.490
 modified to make the fighting more 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:18.950
 brutal now we will make each of a signal 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.990
 much more varied of hidden weapons already 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.670
 that at this time logically no 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.830
 we can go down the street with a sword 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.440
 uncovered because it would be quite 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.120
 striking not the surroundings now will be much 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.610
 more interactive will give us more 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:33.650
 possibilities of action and we'll be able to 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.960
 driving wagons using them to do 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:38.330
 parkour or even hide in them 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.670
 to stealth or even attack 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.990
 our adversaries will have fights between 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.940
 different bands something pretty 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.520
 important within the game is a game 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:48.320
 much darker than the previous ones will be 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.150
 very important to control our 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.250
 followers to support us in the 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:55.040
