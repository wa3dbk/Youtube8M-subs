00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:21.740
 video tutorial I will be telling you how 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:25.430
 create partitions in windows 7 and windows 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:31.910
 8 that I have windows 8.1 and then I 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:34.489
 I'll tell you how to create the ones you want in 788,112 a 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:38.360
 go to the team and we right click and 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:39.949
 administered once done that will 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.680
 wait for it to open what is the 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:46.579
 window that we have clicked on 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:48.850
 manage to open the the 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:50.989
 administrator window computers 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.940
 good management teams is ok 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:55.670
 and what we would do to tell us 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:58.149
 disk management that is in 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:01.640
 this part here the storage that 

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:03.210
 let's give it a click and let's wait 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.700
 to load 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.890
 because we are already here we are going to have 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.369
 this position that from this I discovered 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:14.010
 I discover it is very small 74 gigs 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.170
 they are 80 but they are 74 of those that 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.110
 we'll use right click and 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.659
 reduce volume and let's wait for it 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.200
 the consultation of the space for 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:27.810
 reduction and finish processing and ready 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:30.780
 here here says space size how much 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.690
 we want to assign it in megas ok yo what 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:38.190
 joined then putting as a test a giga 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:42.330
 that are 1024 mb ok once that's done 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:45.420
 we click on reduce 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:47.610
 and we are going to wait for it to be reduced 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.700
 it would 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.909
 the partition 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:55.520
 the partition not that we're going to 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:58.039
 create as I believe a giga says 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.409
 a non-useful giga not assigned or is not 

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:03.740
 is using cause is explained 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:06.350
 law and new simple volume we will 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:09.349
 give a following click next you have to 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:12.590
 we assign a letter and I leave it next 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:15.319
 and volume label put and 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:18.130
 enter the name that I want 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:21.160
 I will put proof 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:24.280
 if we are going to put the test and then 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:29.300
 next and finalize ok let's wait 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:32.120
 a moment that is there is already finished 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:35.210
 good is finishing the correct 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:37.210
 primary partition partition and it is not going 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:40.040
 to open although the partition that we created 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:43.600
 well this partition can serve us 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.600
 how to install games 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:51.040
 install programs or store 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:53.230
 anything 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:56.760
 and if we want to eliminate it, we click 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:59.939
 right and it removes volume and 11 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:03.640
 ok and we right click on our 

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:06.130
 original partition that is the local disk 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:09.330
 and extend volume we give next 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:12.880
 next and finish ok it's that easy 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:16.030
 so that 's all 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.410
 I wish and liked it we'll see you 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.540
