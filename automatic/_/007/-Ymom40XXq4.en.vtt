00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:09.090
 welcome said barelli we go out 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.340
 cling on I am damiano fontana 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.490
 Sherwood researcher that he though 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.049
 keep beautiful dvd prints is mail 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.740
 on facebook the results of yours 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.740
 3d printer 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:25.520
 if we have a double printer 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:27.170
 extruder the first operation to do is 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.470
 that of parking the second one 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:34.280
 extruder on the side by unscrewing the screw 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:36.470
 there is above the fan by removing that the 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:40.580
 second extruder will come off the first one 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:42.650
 and a magnet will be parked to the side 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:46.580
 will help us keep second extruder 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:48.530
 outside the extruder printing area 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:50.360
 cold we eliminate the curls of 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:54.500
 plastic that can form after one 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:56.750
 print we clean the glass top ed 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:00.489
 any plastic residues helping us 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.489
 with a spatula and hot water 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.600
 we insert the plan to see in 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:08.320
 printer and fix it with the clips in 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.320
 equipment 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:16.190
 this is the correct positioning 

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:18.830
 Now let's start the procedure 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:21.560
 printer calibration let's go 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:25.940
 on the menu prepares calibration plan 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:28.850
 manual the printer after resetting 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:32.479
 of the axes will be positioned in the 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:34.160
 four corners of the print bed 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:36.380
 clicking on the panel wheel 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.869
 front will go to the adjustment 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:41.060
 of the next life 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:47.509
 now we will position ourselves on the third for 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:49.550
 have a better view we screw the 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:53.289
 lives until you have a few millimeters of 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:53.289
 space between the plane to see the bird 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.990
 with the help of a sheet of paper 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:01.970
 we will check the setting by unscrewing 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.950
 half a turn at a time 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:07.880
 let's stop when the sheet fails 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:09.860
 more to pass we will repeat this 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:13.880
 operation for all four screws 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:17.569
 of the plan we insert a new filament 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:21.160
 in the printer by going to the menu prepares 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:21.160
 right thread change 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:28.290
 the printer will send in temperature 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:31.110
 the extruder and pull out of the ct 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.500
 complaint if present will notify us with a 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.500
 acoustic sound 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:39.900
 we click on the front panel for 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:41.640
 load a new filament first 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:45.739
 loading operation though 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.739
 we're going to check the line 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.360
 we push the 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:58.470
 filament inside the hole above the 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:03:00.810
 more part we let the car 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:05.450
 and strudÃ  some filament so that 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.450
 the bird will be cleaned from the old thread 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:12.890
 then we go to remove the plastic 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:12.890
 extruded from the machine 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:18.209
 called it the printing plan to get 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.830
 better adhesion by remembering to 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:23.400
 do this out of the 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:26.519
 machine now we launch a print test 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:29.609
 going to the menu prepares calibration 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:33.239
 automatic floor could also 

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:36.060
 call itself the printing test the printer 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:39.660
 it will print rectangles 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:41.579
 concentric on the printing area 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:44.010
 this will help us to understand if the 

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:47.900
 our calibration was successful 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.900
 or there are corrections to make 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:53.760
 when the machine finishes printing 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:55.889
 a square stops and waits for a click 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.480
 from the front panel 

00:03:55.889 --> 00:03:59.430
 this allows us to do some 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.970
 corrections before printing another 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.970
 square 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:09.799
 now I'm going to raise the printing plan 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:12.920
 and lower it in the two corners for 

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:20.000
 check for errors that can be 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:21.320
 made during a calibration we leave 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.449
 let the car finish his 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:26.290
 calibration and let's remove the 

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:29.630
 plan to verify our caliber 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:31.610
 in this corner the extruder is too much 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:33.290
 away from the glass 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:35.419
 so the plastic comes off a lot 

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:38.510
 easily just passing by 

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:40.669
 above the finger we must avoid life e 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:42.650
 corresponding to this corner for 

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:44.120
 bring the print surface closer to the 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:46.520
 structures 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:47.840
 here as you see the second one 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:50.840
 white strip at some point 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:52.789
 it disappears because the extruder is too much 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:54.470
 near the glass top 

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:56.389
 we must therefore screw the screw 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:58.820
 corresponding to this corner for 

00:04:56.389 --> 00:05:01.729
 move the glass top away from the 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:03.500
 structures this is called continuous 

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:05.660
 to follow our video tutorials e 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:08.410
 share on facebook the experience of 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:08.410
 your 3d printer
