00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.029
 hi friends from youtube I'm search 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.250
 crowned this is an interview video 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.140
 to pendleton guard good let's start 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.329
 where the inspiration to create 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.829
 the retro style of adventure time does not 

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:30.630
 I think the style of the show is 

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:33.150
 exactly retro there are never many 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.070
 elements that are particularly 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:38.579
 music and sound effects are 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:41.100
 inspired by 8-bit video games is the 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.140
 way in which penn draws is one of 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.390
 the few animations that have many 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.699
 influences of the fleischer brothers and 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.010
 Felix the cat as well as burnley ships 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:52.109
 mickey mouse hour of adventure has a 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.120
 large number of followers of different 

00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:56.760
 generations through the internet to what 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.710
 you owe your success the kind of humor is what 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.590
 that probably attracts differences 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.149
 generations humor for adult cinema already 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.009
 that has many words and phrases 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:08.340
 absurd people of all ages 

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:10.380
 can make fun of these how they generate 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.910
 the ideas for the stories I'm 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.920
 doing a script of an episode in the 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:16.770
 that pretend they can not leave because there 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.240
 a storm of knives and swords like that 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.970
 that are inside the house and a 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.100
 invisible monster follows he needed 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.880
 that flowed from the monster so what 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.610
 I drew I ran 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.469
 the window is high I had forgotten about 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.180
 the storm of knives so I 

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:32.159
 I find the point where I have to 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.840
 re-enter point I write the dialogue 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.520
 in which check asks end and the 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.380
 storm of knives to what end 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.969
 answer or I forgot because I 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.189
 I forgot but the story is while the 

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:43.110
 I write so things can come up 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.390
 unexpectedly I am the voice of the 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.189
 characters so he reacted according to the 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.020
 impress and there is something that has 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.869
 inspired by hour of adventure the 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.729
 first seasons of the simpsons that 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.140
 I try to create that the characters are 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.689
 feel so real that they inspire 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.610
 emotions I really like to quote stories 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.860

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.899

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.270
