00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:18.660
 hey ho people need to be good on stupid 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.210
 on city and today with a new solo 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.920
 gameplay what means solo gameplay better 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.230
 said to one of my first solo 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.310
 Gameplays you could include red 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.500
 to paint on the calendar 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.420
 As you know I almost shows the team 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.080
 and that's why it's almost really one 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.079
 wonder 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.610
 I have said from the basic solo 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.559
 because somehow did not bother with 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.700
 to talk to somebody and that 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.770
 Gameplay I just have no sense 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.120
 multi team wanted I do not know 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.710
 why I maybe I have but only 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.010
 Groomed and the lobby looked very nice 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.020
 out 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.789
 I had a bit of luck with it 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.410
 the lobby because just my teammate also 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.789
 have made one or two hobbies 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.430
 I do not have the headset 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:56.100
 I have a bit of music running 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.719
 let and then this nice came 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.780
 gameplay out I prefer to go 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.190
 really annoying in front of mine from mine 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.260
 next round died from my 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.030
 own swarm and it was somehow 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.790
 not a single enemy in the whole circumference 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.110
 but of course, swarms instead 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.470
 time to go to the opponents of course 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.990
 only on me is charged properly but 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.740
 well in retrospect, I need me 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.689
 do not get upset about it 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.280
 still the 100 plus at 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.439
 come out in the end what even really 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.970
 but it was scarce but I have the one 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.189
 or other kilometer secondary or 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.570
 the c4 made but the monument no 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.880
 problem because it just like that 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.280
 Bit of it belongs to me 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.280
 new series apparently completely considering 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.409
 It's nice and that's half past nine facts 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.790
 in each case where I just so gentleman 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.869
 I just think everyone knows 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.670
 or quite a few of you know 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.490
 and I'll just start now 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.220
 So there's always a rough idea 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:49.350
 from the new series should get to 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.220
 example either from the school area 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.220
 stop or out of the area 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:57.040
 after or gaming or whatever 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.050
 simply must let's see how the 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.790
 So facts result so I have me 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:01.870
 now written down ten pieces 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:03.460
 and then I'll follow in the next one 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:05.290
 if the teachings arrive well to you 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:08.350
 should should go ahead with it 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:09.580
 fact numero one of the teachers says hardy 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:11.709
 class work again right 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.180
 badly failed blabla and he looks 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:16.120
 only to you 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:18.250
 I think all students or people 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.440
 these are average in school 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.750
 They know the feeling of the teachers looks 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.790
 only to you and then says yes there were times 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.209
 again a 6 and he just looks at you 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:30.130
 and you know directly I have the six 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:32.310
 apparently quite onerous but he 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:37.239
 I'll just continue 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:39.160
 numero two if the controller is but 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:41.110
 somehow still her still felt seven 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.090
 I can continue to gamble for years 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:44.560
 first time you will be the time 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.480
 controller something empty invite you 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.910
 on blabla and you can still about 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.590
 easy three hours then moved on 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.060
 he goes out for the first time you can him 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.440
 but directly turn it on again and you can 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.130
 then loose again an hour more 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.709
 gamble 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:58.660
 he was then sometime after completely whole 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:00.820
 long time always completely empty 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:03.910
 But thats hardly ever the case 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:05.769
 because he has almost infinite battery comes to me 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:09.040
 at least as before so now just 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:10.570
 Fact numero three if you go on sundays 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.329
 Just do it all day long 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:15.010
 I took care of that and noticed more 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:17.019
 write dawn work and man 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:20.380
 just thinks so i'm so sent 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:24.760
 I think that's a situation 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:26.260
 nobody likes to be inside or has the 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.320
 Almost every one of you once 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:31.750
 at least many of you are experiencing the 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:33.400
 very bad boys are already here quite often 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.049
 guys then I want to get back to you 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.989
 Otherwise, watch the next time 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:39.549
 home and then evening so think so 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:41.650
 I'm a pretty stressful thing 

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:44.430
 but of course I know that too 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.430
 experience and 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:49.810
 fakt include nummero about 45 I could 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.880
 never so good so i just do it 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:53.860
 let's get on with getting up in the morning 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:56.320
 or trying to get up the alarm clock 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:58.270
 rings and you just think so come 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:00.220
 I can go on for another ten minutes 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:01.660
 Sleep makes you the alarm clock 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:04.090
 and just beats ten minutes 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:05.140
 longer he rings again and you have 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.600
 still no desire to get up and 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:10.200
 make him out again monument yes 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:12.250
 Everyone knows about you 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.720
 I used to have to use the me in the past 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:15.130
 my whole room is running around my alarm clock 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.959
 switch off and then I was easy 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:18.970
 awake and who but meanwhile that lies 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:21.910
 just never mobile and I have mine yes 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:23.050
 stop with the phone and who asked 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:24.790
 then just not really 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:26.530
 awake only sleep three times 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:28.690
 half an hour longer and then stop 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:30.160
 always fighting or getting better 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:32.110
 I sweat badly that I still have my bus 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.000
 because yes that was actually 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:36.010
 pointless since this was ten minutes 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.990
 about how long you sleep longer 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:39.150
 not much to bring but you do 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:42.280
 it still stops over again 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:43.840
 and yes then with me such a thing the 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:47.230
 I do not think so with all of them 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:49.120
 case of your song or whatever the 

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:50.260
 exaggerated is a worm has to 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:52.690
 example with me is not even that way 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:54.820
 at fan singers from duisburg have there 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:56.410
 I just get the mega earworm I get 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:58.150
 just head off I just can not 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:00.190
 stop and all my environment are 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:01.870
 totally annoyed with me or from this 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:04.120
 song and I just can not do it 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:05.230
 run who hate it properly themselves but 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:09.130
 I just can not stop it 

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:12.070
 and there one or the other but knows 

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:13.900
 well does not have to be then one 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:15.640
 the worst facts i find myself 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:17.380
 just wrote down if you have 

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:22.560
 sneeze and just can not 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:23.980
 you do not do and why not why 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.630
 really bad 

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:27.010
 Normally in the summer one comes yes 

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:28.720
 nice in the sun and then works 

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:30.460
 but sometimes it's just right 

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:33.010
 charged if you just do not sneeze 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:34.840
 but and how to look at it guys 

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:36.760
 you all know you look really right 

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:39.820
 so do not care 

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:41.650
 At first , if you have pictures of yourself 

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:43.360
 myself sees such my mother is coming 

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:45.670
 Also if I have a picture of her 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:47.560
 I found where you are five years old 

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:49.240
 look at me and think so you see 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:52.540
 just shit or say earlier 

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:54.010
 shit off so you just think 

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:56.890
 increasingly early summer still crappy 

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:58.270
 from as you look now but I think 

00:05:56.890 --> 00:06:01.810
 quite a lot of you know 

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:04.540
 then if that is I think so 

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:07.479
 a fact that not many have 

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:09.310
 for example youtube case if 

00:06:07.479 --> 00:06:10.900
 one hears his own voice many from 

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:12.220
 that does not bother you or many follow 

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:13.300
 a lot youtuber the city not if 

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:14.110
 one's own or if yours 

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:16.000
 to hear your own voice 

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:17.410
 but for me it's really bad I 

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.610
 hate the mega, for example, I'm at 

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:20.740
 Colleagues and they want a video 

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:22.330
 look at me and I hate it 

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:23.979
 I can not overdo it 

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:25.510
 if then if I agree with my own 

00:06:23.979 --> 00:06:27.190
 I would not like him too 

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:28.510
 not exactly for which reason that 

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:30.070
 I have gameplay on the seven 

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:31.590
 minutes we have cut 20 minutes 

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:34.210
 just under a minute 

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:36.070
 and yes, that's why I would really over 

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:37.780
 Many reviews are happy again 

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:40.300
 I think we have one at 

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:42.100
 embark nuclear with 200 likes 

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:44.140
 managed without plaster of them in others 

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:46.210
 big youtuber and guys i would 

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:48.220
 really happy again when we get close 

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:50.200
 this number reaches as many as possible 

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:51.669
 get ratings and yes if you the 

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:53.950
 I also like one more series 

00:06:51.669 --> 00:06:55.450
 review and write me like that 

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:57.940
 series finds and if you are so 

00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:59.740
 fact and the idea richard emirate 

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:01.360
 spontaneously, then write me 

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:02.710
 Just in the comments really 

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:04.210
 sincerely look then I would go to 

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:05.950
 maybe in the next video 

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:10.090
 if the series stops when I arrive 

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:11.830
 or arrive well will use 

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:14.650
 I make it a fact again 

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:16.240
 completion if somehow in the evening 

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:18.550
 most of the time is really sunday 

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:21.070
 you just can not fall asleep 

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:22.539
 try everything you do one turns 

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:23.440
