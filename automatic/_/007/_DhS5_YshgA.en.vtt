fair<00:00:04.830> result<00:00:05.509> paresthesia<00:00:06.509> man<00:00:06.919> played<00:00:07.919> a

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
fair result paresthesia man played a

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:09.530 
fair result paresthesia man played a
very<00:00:08.160> strong<00:00:08.429> team<00:00:08.639> in<00:00:08.790> the<00:00:08.849> first<00:00:09.000> half<00:00:09.300> and

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
very strong team in the first half and

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.959 
very strong team in the first half and
what<00:00:10.469> we<00:00:10.559> had<00:00:10.710> more<00:00:10.950> morphed<00:00:11.550> ball<00:00:11.790> in<00:00:11.910> the

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
what we had more morphed ball in the

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:13.999 
what we had more morphed ball in the
first<00:00:12.090> stuff<00:00:12.450> and<00:00:12.690> I<00:00:12.750> think<00:00:12.960> the<00:00:13.559> second<00:00:13.920> half

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
first stuff and I think the second half

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:15.350 
first stuff and I think the second half
change<00:00:14.280> will<00:00:14.460> it<00:00:14.580> be<00:00:14.730> the<00:00:14.880> way<00:00:15.150> more

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
change will it be the way more

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.660 
change will it be the way more
possession<00:00:15.870> and<00:00:16.670> were<00:00:17.670> able<00:00:18.060> to<00:00:18.390> equalize<00:00:19.109> and

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:19.670 
possession and were able to equalize and

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:24.470 
possession and were able to equalize and
had<00:00:20.670> a<00:00:21.449> couple<00:00:22.050> of<00:00:22.140> challenges<00:00:22.380> to<00:00:22.970> to<00:00:23.970> ask<00:00:24.359> all

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
had a couple of challenges to to ask all

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.710 
had a couple of challenges to to ask all
the<00:00:24.570> winners<00:00:24.750> well<00:00:25.050> tinker<00:00:25.560> was<00:00:25.710> a<00:00:25.740> good<00:00:26.220> match

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:26.720 
the winners well tinker was a good match

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:34.280 
the winners well tinker was a good match
with<00:00:28.189> a<00:00:29.189> good<00:00:29.400> intensity<00:00:29.910> but<00:00:32.059> brought<00:00:33.290> half

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
with a good intensity but brought half

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.160 
with a good intensity but brought half
time<00:00:34.739> I<00:00:35.040> think<00:00:35.489> that<00:00:35.579> we<00:00:35.670> played<00:00:36.020> really<00:00:37.020> bad

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
time I think that we played really bad

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.290 
time I think that we played really bad
at<00:00:37.469> the<00:00:37.590> first<00:00:37.800> time<00:00:38.010> but<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:38.370> test<00:00:38.910> was<00:00:38.969> good

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
at the first time but the test was good

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.959 
at the first time but the test was good
for<00:00:39.480> us<00:00:39.660> because<00:00:39.870> we<00:00:40.200> played<00:00:40.440> there<00:00:40.590> as<00:00:40.710> the

00:00:40.959 --> 00:00:40.969 
for us because we played there as the

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:44.360 
for us because we played there as the
very<00:00:41.969> strong<00:00:42.239> thing<00:00:42.480> for<00:00:42.870> us<00:00:43.079> was<00:00:43.620> one<00:00:44.129> of<00:00:44.250> the

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
very strong thing for us was one of the

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.910 
very strong thing for us was one of the
first<00:00:44.610> experience<00:00:45.260> against<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.350> top<00:00:46.590> team<00:00:46.800> in

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
first experience against the top team in

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.520 
first experience against the top team in
Europe<00:00:47.309> and<00:00:47.460> I<00:00:47.579> think<00:00:47.910> that<00:00:48.200> we<00:00:49.200> have<00:00:49.289> to<00:00:49.350> be

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
Europe and I think that we have to be

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.760 
Europe and I think that we have to be
happy<00:00:49.920> because<00:00:50.129> I<00:00:51.059> warm<00:00:51.600> it<00:00:51.719> was<00:00:51.930> good<00:00:52.170> first

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
happy because I warm it was good first

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.619 
happy because I warm it was good first

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
on Wednesday so we use less place for

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.320 
on Wednesday so we use less place for
the<00:01:10.080> next<00:01:10.320> game<00:01:10.500> and<00:01:10.799> things<00:01:11.490> been<00:01:11.790> spinning

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
the next game and things been spinning

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.570 
the next game and things been spinning

none of us to play the first soccer game

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.670 
none of us to play the first soccer game
in<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:15.090> Yankee<00:01:15.420> Stadium<00:01:15.780> as<00:01:15.900> well<00:01:16.049> okay<00:01:16.470> you

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
in the Yankee Stadium as well okay you

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.200 
in the Yankee Stadium as well okay you
have<00:01:16.799> to<00:01:16.860> be<00:01:17.070> into<00:01:17.340> this<00:01:17.460> fight<00:01:17.700> because<00:01:17.820> this

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
have to be into this fight because this

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.570 
have to be into this fight because this
team<00:01:18.450> improve<00:01:19.380> really<00:01:20.130> quickly<00:01:20.520> I<00:01:20.729> think<00:01:21.630> that

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580 
team improve really quickly I think that

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.030 
team improve really quickly I think that
we<00:01:23.580> are<00:01:24.000> showing<00:01:24.060> our<00:01:24.659> identity<00:01:25.290> of<00:01:25.380> play<00:01:25.619> and

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
we are showing our identity of play and

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.910 
we are showing our identity of play and
when<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:27.479> new<00:01:27.630> player<00:01:27.869> arrived<00:01:28.290> I<00:01:28.320> think<00:01:28.770> that

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
when the new player arrived I think that

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.340 
when the new player arrived I think that
we<00:01:29.040> can<00:01:29.220> increase<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.610> quality<00:01:29.970> of<00:01:30.210> play<00:01:30.659> and

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
we can increase the quality of play and

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.010 
we can increase the quality of play and
I<00:01:31.680> think<00:01:31.740> that<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.310> problem<00:01:32.579> and<00:01:33.570> we<00:01:33.720> are<00:01:33.840> not

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
I think that the problem and we are not

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.980 
I think that the problem and we are not
so<00:01:34.200> so<00:01:35.130> far<00:01:35.369> to<00:01:35.579> our<00:01:35.670> best<00:01:36.030> I'm<00:01:36.540> sure<00:01:36.810> they're

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
so so far to our best I'm sure they're

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.280 
so so far to our best I'm sure they're
going<00:01:37.140> to<00:01:37.259> be<00:01:37.350> a<00:01:37.380> force<00:01:37.860> in<00:01:38.720> the<00:01:39.720> league<00:01:39.869> and<00:01:40.079> in

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
going to be a force in the league and in

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.440 
going to be a force in the league and in
Champions<00:01:40.770> League<00:01:40.920> and<00:01:41.220> you<00:01:42.119> could<00:01:42.299> see

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
Champions League and you could see

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.539 
Champions League and you could see
another<00:01:42.990> good<00:01:43.229> players<00:01:43.470> to<00:01:43.649> have<00:01:43.740> in<00:01:44.490> that

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
another good players to have in that

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.840 
another good players to have in that
team<00:01:44.909> so<00:01:45.750> I<00:01:46.320> think<00:01:46.649> it's<00:01:46.950> going<00:01:47.070> to<00:01:47.159> make<00:01:47.310> for

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
team so I think it's going to make for

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.330 
team so I think it's going to make for
us<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.720> championship<00:01:48.930> probably<00:01:49.649> more<00:01:50.009> more

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
us the championship probably more more

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.380 
us the championship probably more more
difficult<00:01:50.700> than<00:01:50.759> more<00:01:50.880> interesting<00:01:51.270> for

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
difficult than more interesting for

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.590 
difficult than more interesting for
everybody<00:01:51.470> jesse<00:01:52.470> was<00:01:52.500> one<00:01:52.979> of<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.189> best<00:01:53.369> in

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
everybody jesse was one of the best in

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.590 
everybody jesse was one of the best in
Europe<00:01:54.600> and<00:01:55.549> Paris<00:01:56.549> and<00:01:56.700> Germer<00:01:56.969> wants<00:01:57.299> to<00:01:57.420> be

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
Europe and Paris and Germer wants to be

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.170 
Europe and Paris and Germer wants to be
one<00:01:57.899> of<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:58.110> best<00:01:58.290> team<00:01:58.500> in<00:01:58.710> Europe<00:01:59.460> so<00:01:59.670> for

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
one of the best team in Europe so for

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.590 
one of the best team in Europe so for
this<00:02:00.360> reason<00:02:00.420> I<00:02:00.869> think<00:02:01.079> that<00:02:01.909> to<00:02:02.909> reach<00:02:03.119> the

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
this reason I think that to reach the

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.749 
this reason I think that to reach the
hike<00:02:03.810> level<00:02:04.200> in<00:02:04.320> football<00:02:04.740> in<00:02:04.950> Europe<00:02:05.340> to
