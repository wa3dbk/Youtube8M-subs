00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:08.099
 hi girls today is friday and i am 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.700
 went shopping at my truck 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:14.340
 I have a favorite pickup truck that 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:15.929
 let's just put it down I 'm Friday 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.210
 so I go and make an escort for 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:21.660
 I had a truck all week 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:24.539
 of fruits and vegetables and things are 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:28.109
 delighted and do not know occupy the 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:30.349
 strawberries then I bought my cabbage 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:34.530
 usually romanesco then involved 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:38.670
 I supplied a lot of things I bought 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:42.960
 lots of vegetables fruit banal oranges 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.489
 so many things and nothing could 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.899
 I do a lot recently with the 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.430
 vegetables then what everyone ate 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.950
 pleased 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.230
 obviously today I thought of one for you 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.079
 recipe with vegetables-based indeed 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.949
 vegetables are totally vegetables 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.750
 oven 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:01.289
 here I have prepared the pan before 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:04.860
 then bake it in my opinion this 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.869
 recipe is right that I propose to you 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.939
 today because over the weekend maybe you have 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.909
 a few trips out of town or you have 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.740
 host and are a great dish of 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.210
 side dish also single dish because the 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.040
 end, I will give you some precious 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.409
 cheese 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.259
 so I put the veiling on me 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:25.470
 like them in a particular way and choice 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:29.270
 that looks at me strangely and then I did 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:31.619
 I cut the potatoes and carrots a 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.930
 rather large pieces 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.659
 here you look, you see little pieces like this 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.970
 coarsely and large pieces 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:42.689
 precisely and I boiled them in water 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:45.869
 salt was already boiling put them 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:48.200
 in for 5 minutes and then stir 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:52.430
 I cut the zucchini 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:56.369
 ok always large pieces of eggplant 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:02:00.390
 always in large chunks then the onion 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:02.320
 or to a red onion me and then what 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.830
 I still dress 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:08.399
 no the real courgette said vabbÃ¨ here 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.630
 interests could also put the 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.430
 pepper, however, is a vegetable that 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:15.340
 unfortunately I do not digest easily 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.750
 not even the onions, however, the pepper 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.310
 in particular therefore seeing that me 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.820
 like your favorite baked vegetables 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.840
 don't put it ok then you all have it 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.910
 your vegetables on the baking sheet 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.290
 exactly as I did maybe 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.510
 even better if you want you can 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.220
 indulge yourself with the imagination put 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:33.010
 all the colors you don't know the carrots don't 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:35.290
 to pay for the vegetables sorry all 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.570
 zucchini make all the colors and maybe 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.010
 one is even more inviting for children 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:42.580
 time anyway because I have arranged the 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:45.700
 your vegetables on the baking sheet 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:49.630
 let's take some oil and put it in it 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:52.390
 over just a little bit has passed 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:54.850
 from fast oil then to a quick 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.920
 container exactly as I did 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:00.519
 put a bit of a bit of bread crumbs 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:02.140
 chopped parsley and if you want even a 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:04.060
 little parmesan cheese 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:07.090
 grated in general then I put the 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:09.790
 I had the grated Grana Padano cheese 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:18.690
 the sad then take yours 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:21.610
 prepared and so I spill just right 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:24.700
 well practically cover yours 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:30.190
 vegetables of this of this preparation 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:32.320
 ok it's not exactly as i did 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:36.910
 I don't know if you see wines under the weather 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:39.100
 so he says ok however still allows 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:40.299
 a little bit instead of big if 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.070
 you want you can also put some 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:44.500
 pecorino however, I am honored by a cheese 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:47.440
 what I particularly love though is actually 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:51.880
 very tasty so it would be good and 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:54.280
 then at this point indeed yours 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:59.260
 vegetables are ready to be informed 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:04:02.650
 and then oven at 180 degrees for 60 minutes 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:06.579
 ok so you put them in the oven and put them in the oven 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:09.040
 because we have the oven to say ok 

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:11.650
 halfway through cooking to prevent them 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:15.280
 vegetables dry too much 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:17.380
 a few ladles of broth a couple of 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.090
 ladles made perhaps a broth with a nut 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:20.739
 if you have it there or I use that of 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:22.840
 vegetables that already prepared that I use for 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:25.570
 victory to make the parts to victories e 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:29.320
 I put it in. 23 put there usually 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:31.600
 an hour no2 I could not hold up m 2 ladles e 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:34.750
 then at the end almost at the end of cooking they do 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:36.479
 just 10 minutes to go 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:40.780
 I put these little mozzarella balls on them 

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:43.449
 here they are so they have the time to 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:47.500
 melt but not too much and I am 

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:49.960
 really very good guys in the 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:51.220
 I recommend food what you do 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.490
 no because in the meantime she is 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:59.260
 becoming large and therefore firm and not 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:05:01.930
 your mom talks to you but seasoned talking 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:06.780
 in fact I show you them thematic 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:10.479
 look at us aunts look at us here we are 

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:11.919
 hello lizzi in the meantime behind it 

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:17.740
 they see my things 

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:20.830
 eric chu qua good and after that then 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:24.729
 here here girls more or less write 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:26.199
 everything is ok so at this point I have mine 

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:30.430
 assistant 

00:05:26.199 --> 00:05:32.380
 we wish him a good weekend and the 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:35.949
 recipe does not know how to do the opposite and 

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:38.020
 that is, that I put it in the info box meanwhile 

00:05:35.949 --> 00:05:41.110
 however a very simple thing cut 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:42.770
 the vegetables are baked at 180 degrees an hour 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:46.250
 sprinkle 

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:49.789
 then it was better to close girls 

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:51.110
 because I'm dwelling too much there 

00:05:49.789 --> 00:05:54.909
 see Monday 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:54.909
 a hug and a good weekend
