00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.360

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.520
 of his series so is each one through 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.290
 this series is going to be doing the one 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.700
 good that what you need to do good 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.110
 First of all, I need to check your 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.050
 map see where you're going to go 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:28.210
 you have to detect well first the 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:30.460
 first maps the first 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:31.930
 planets to which you are going to visit and 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:34.060
 once you're here, you're not going to 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.920
 I can visit mira osse I go through 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.750
 this and here there is a one is to put 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.550
 chicks like that put us chicks 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.650
 blacks that you see are are bad are 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.750
 very bad bad guys and if I come from 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.220
 this side to castellÃ³n is to put cows 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.800
 so he was going to be hiding low 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:51.100
 but I think they also hurt you and 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:53.320
 so on god every day better 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:56.830
 editors so on each of 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:59.170
 these as you can tell each of 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:01.540
 these worlds have something special 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.280
 You need to walk around here and check 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.650
 example on this chest and look up the 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.960
 nose that the enchanted nose the 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.670
 you will be able to get very fast or what 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:11.020
 that are the enchanted blocks that 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.700
 you need them to all the blocks 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:15.220
 they should be charmed and so on 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:17.890
 and good God gave me in the middle as with 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.750
 tremendous black although general god is 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:21.970

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:25.210
