00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:03.679 

hello<00:00:01.740> guys<00:00:02.010> as<00:00:02.310> we<00:00:02.610> know<00:00:02.850> the<00:00:03.120> wheels<00:00:03.360> will<00:00:03.659> be

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:03.689 
hello guys as we know the wheels will be

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:05.990 
hello guys as we know the wheels will be
tensioned<00:00:04.319> during<00:00:04.980> the<00:00:05.100> building<00:00:05.430> so<00:00:05.759> it

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
tensioned during the building so it

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.970 
tensioned during the building so it
requires<00:00:06.390> a<00:00:06.569> very<00:00:06.720> important<00:00:07.470> process

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
requires a very important process

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.120 
requires a very important process
it's<00:00:08.280> called<00:00:08.820> stress<00:00:09.150> reliving<00:00:09.660> and<00:00:10.130> this

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
it's called stress reliving and this

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.730 
it's called stress reliving and this
process<00:00:11.429> will<00:00:12.030> give<00:00:12.719> the<00:00:12.929> wheel<00:00:13.170> a<00:00:13.410> more

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
process will give the wheel a more

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.790 
process will give the wheel a more
stable<00:00:14.580> structure<00:00:14.940> and<00:00:15.450> will<00:00:15.750> stretch<00:00:16.410> the

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
stable structure and will stretch the

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.029 
stable structure and will stretch the
component<00:00:17.490> parts<00:00:17.850> and<00:00:18.439> here<00:00:19.439> you<00:00:19.590> can<00:00:19.800> see

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
component parts and here you can see

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.710 
component parts and here you can see
this<00:00:20.310> machine<00:00:20.550> it's<00:00:21.000> called<00:00:21.300> stress

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
this machine it's called stress

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:33.470 
this machine it's called stress
relieving<00:00:22.199> machine

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.140 

also<00:00:34.480> you<00:00:34.570> can<00:00:34.870> see<00:00:35.110> here<00:00:35.670> here<00:00:36.670> are<00:00:36.880> the

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:37.150 
also you can see here here are the

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.869 
also you can see here here are the
different<00:00:37.420> size<00:00:37.960> cylinders<00:00:38.739> to<00:00:39.370> face<00:00:39.640> in<00:00:39.820> a

00:00:39.869 --> 00:00:39.879 
different size cylinders to face in a

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:40.799 
different size cylinders to face in a
different<00:00:40.059> hub

00:00:40.799 --> 00:00:40.809 
different hub

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:44.690 
different hub
okay<00:00:41.530> and<00:00:41.910> now<00:00:42.910> let's<00:00:42.940> start<00:00:43.690> our<00:00:43.870> process

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
okay and now let's start our process

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.360 
okay and now let's start our process
first<00:00:45.700> I<00:00:45.940> will<00:00:46.210> put<00:00:46.510> the<00:00:46.570> ring<00:00:47.050> on<00:00:47.320> the<00:00:47.920> top<00:00:48.160> of

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:48.370 
first I will put the ring on the top of

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:54.990 
first I will put the ring on the top of
this<00:00:48.610> machine<00:00:52.140> okay<00:00:53.140> and<00:00:53.550> we<00:00:54.550> will<00:00:54.699> choose

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:55.000 
this machine okay and we will choose

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.590 
this machine okay and we will choose
this<00:00:55.269> one<00:00:55.330> to<00:00:55.750> pick<00:00:56.140> this<00:00:56.410> heart<00:00:56.769> and<00:00:57.640> the<00:00:58.480> we

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:58.600 
this one to pick this heart and the we

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.160 
this one to pick this heart and the we
will<00:00:58.750> color<00:00:59.019> the<00:00:59.410> half<00:00:59.650> here<00:01:00.330> okay<00:01:01.330> and<00:01:01.600> we

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:02.170 
will color the half here okay and we

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.369 
will color the half here okay and we
will<00:01:02.320> give<00:01:02.559> a<00:01:02.769> 70<00:01:03.370> kilograms<00:01:04.089> load<00:01:04.690> on<00:01:05.049> this

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:05.379 
will give a 70 kilograms load on this

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:09.690 
will give a 70 kilograms load on this
wheel<00:01:05.710> at<00:01:06.220> each<00:01:07.060> side<00:01:07.680> twice<00:01:08.680> okay

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:09.700 
wheel at each side twice okay

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:21.600 
wheel at each side twice okay
now<00:01:09.970> let's<00:01:10.210> begin<00:01:19.770> okay<00:01:20.770> now<00:01:20.950> turns<00:01:21.250> to<00:01:21.490> the

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:21.610 
now let's begin okay now turns to the

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:44.370 
now let's begin okay now turns to the
other<00:01:21.760> side

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.719 

okay

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:48.729 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:53.130 

so<00:01:49.729> after<00:01:50.600> this<00:01:50.899> process<00:01:51.289> we<00:01:51.860> will<00:01:51.890> truing<00:01:52.610> and

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
so after this process we will truing and

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.700 
so after this process we will truing and
adjusting<00:01:54.140> the<00:01:54.289> spokes<00:01:54.590> attention<00:01:55.280> again<00:01:55.490> so

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:56.710 
adjusting the spokes attention again so

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:59.679 
adjusting the spokes attention again so
with<00:01:57.710> this<00:01:57.979> process<00:01:58.340> you<00:01:58.610> can<00:01:59.179> have<00:01:59.450> the

00:01:59.679 --> 00:01:59.689 
with this process you can have the

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:02.440 
with this process you can have the
better<00:01:59.960> wheels<00:02:00.500> and<00:02:00.860> the<00:02:01.069> better<00:02:01.280> writing<00:02:01.640> so

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
better wheels and the better writing so

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.950 
better wheels and the better writing so
if<00:02:02.899> you<00:02:03.170> have<00:02:03.380> more<00:02:04.130> interesting<00:02:04.909> hour<00:02:05.149> when

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
if you have more interesting hour when

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.529 
if you have more interesting hour when
