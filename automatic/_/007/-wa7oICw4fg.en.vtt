00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:28.490 
spread across the chest and then we'll
exhale<00:04:26.520> place<00:04:27.090> that<00:04:27.390> top<00:04:27.630> hand<00:04:28.020> to<00:04:28.110> the<00:04:28.260> ground

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
exhale place that top hand to the ground

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.700 
exhale place that top hand to the ground
and<00:04:29.220> revolve<00:04:29.610> around<00:04:29.880> the<00:04:30.510> toes<00:04:30.840> are<00:04:31.169> pointing

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710 
and revolve around the toes are pointing

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:34.130 
and revolve around the toes are pointing
towards<00:04:31.919> the<00:04:32.160> floor<00:04:32.550> okay<00:04:33.540> so<00:04:33.600> this<00:04:33.930> is<00:04:34.110> a

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:34.140 
towards the floor okay so this is a

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:36.290 
towards the floor okay so this is a
little<00:04:34.560> tricky<00:04:34.980> it<00:04:35.130> works<00:04:35.310> balance<00:04:35.850> but<00:04:36.180> it's

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
little tricky it works balance but it's

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:40.100 
little tricky it works balance but it's
also<00:04:36.419> great<00:04:36.750> for<00:04:36.810> toning<00:04:37.770> the<00:04:38.220> butt<00:04:38.430> and<00:04:39.110> the

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.110 
also great for toning the butt and the

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:44.000 
also great for toning the butt and the
legs<00:04:40.410> so<00:04:41.280> stay<00:04:41.610> here<00:04:42.270> or<00:04:42.600> use<00:04:43.230> the<00:04:43.440> floor<00:04:43.770> to

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.010 
legs so stay here or use the floor to

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:46.760 
legs so stay here or use the floor to
come<00:04:44.220> up<00:04:44.400> and<00:04:44.550> twist<00:04:45.120> all<00:04:45.419> the<00:04:45.900> way<00:04:46.050> up<00:04:46.350> to

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:46.770 
come up and twist all the way up to

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:49.430 
come up and twist all the way up to
standing<00:04:47.540> point<00:04:48.540> the<00:04:48.660> foot<00:04:48.810> spread<00:04:49.110> the<00:04:49.230> toes

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440 
standing point the foot spread the toes

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:50.840 
standing point the foot spread the toes
it<00:04:49.620> helps<00:04:49.800> release<00:04:50.070> this<00:04:50.250> so<00:04:50.370> as<00:04:50.520> it's<00:04:50.760> a

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:50.850 
it helps release this so as it's a

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:53.240 
it helps release this so as it's a
little<00:04:50.880> easier<00:04:51.720> that<00:04:51.900> way<00:04:52.050> so<00:04:52.710> we'll<00:04:52.980> come

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:53.250 
little easier that way so we'll come

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:57.320 
little easier that way so we'll come
back<00:04:53.280> down<00:04:53.730> on<00:04:54.090> an<00:04:54.210> inhale<00:04:54.650> and<00:04:56.150> we<00:04:57.150> will

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.330 
back down on an inhale and we will

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.590 
back down on an inhale and we will
exhale<00:04:58.250> to<00:04:59.250> come<00:04:59.430> to<00:04:59.610> standing<00:04:59.970> you<00:05:00.360> want<00:05:00.510> to

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:00.600 
exhale to come to standing you want to

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:04.000 
exhale to come to standing you want to
spread<00:05:00.870> the<00:05:01.020> toes<00:05:01.370> this<00:05:02.370> works<00:05:02.669> focus

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:04.010 
spread the toes this works focus

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:07.730 
spread the toes this works focus
coordination<00:05:05.360> balance<00:05:06.360> and<00:05:06.900> after<00:05:07.590> this

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:07.740 
coordination balance and after this

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:09.380 
coordination balance and after this
things<00:05:08.010> like<00:05:08.070> handstands<00:05:08.700> become<00:05:09.090> even

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:09.390 
things like handstands become even

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:13.670 
things like handstands become even
easier<00:05:09.840> twist<00:05:11.000> good<00:05:12.000> and<00:05:12.380> then<00:05:13.380> we'll<00:05:13.470> release

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680 
easier twist good and then we'll release

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.310 
easier twist good and then we'll release

00:06:12.269 --> 00:06:14.989 
gone too far and then release that top
hand<00:06:12.539> to<00:06:12.689> the<00:06:12.809> floor<00:06:12.959> toes<00:06:13.889> go<00:06:14.159> down<00:06:14.519> to<00:06:14.909> the

00:06:14.989 --> 00:06:14.999 
hand to the floor toes go down to the

00:06:14.999 --> 00:06:18.859 
hand to the floor toes go down to the
ground<00:06:15.209> and<00:06:15.629> so<00:06:16.529> you're<00:06:17.389> lengthening<00:06:18.389> this

00:06:18.859 --> 00:06:18.869 
ground and so you're lengthening this

00:06:18.869 --> 00:06:20.719 
ground and so you're lengthening this
leg<00:06:19.109> back<00:06:19.409> up<00:06:19.469> a<00:06:19.679> hamstring<00:06:19.889> as<00:06:20.369> well<00:06:20.610> as

00:06:20.719 --> 00:06:20.729 
leg back up a hamstring as well as

00:06:20.729 --> 00:06:22.899 
leg back up a hamstring as well as
toning<00:06:21.179> the<00:06:21.329> but<00:06:21.749> that's<00:06:21.929> up<00:06:22.139> towards<00:06:22.439> the<00:06:22.529> sky

00:06:22.899 --> 00:06:22.909 
toning the but that's up towards the sky

00:06:22.909 --> 00:06:25.279 
toning the but that's up towards the sky
so<00:06:23.909> here<00:06:24.239> the<00:06:24.419> opposite<00:06:24.749> hand<00:06:24.959> will<00:06:25.079> come

00:06:25.279 --> 00:06:25.289 
so here the opposite hand will come

00:06:25.289 --> 00:06:27.259 
so here the opposite hand will come
towards<00:06:25.499> the<00:06:25.649> sky<00:06:25.919> and<00:06:26.219> then<00:06:26.610> you'll<00:06:26.759> use<00:06:26.999> your

00:06:27.259 --> 00:06:27.269 
towards the sky and then you'll use your

00:06:27.269 --> 00:06:30.109 
towards the sky and then you'll use your
core<00:06:27.779> to<00:06:28.709> come<00:06:28.860> all<00:06:29.129> the<00:06:29.429> way<00:06:29.459> up<00:06:29.549> to<00:06:29.669> standing

00:06:30.109 --> 00:06:30.119 
core to come all the way up to standing

00:06:30.119 --> 00:06:33.619 
core to come all the way up to standing
and<00:06:30.769> twist<00:06:31.769> point<00:06:32.729> the<00:06:32.819> foot<00:06:32.969> spread<00:06:33.299> the<00:06:33.419> toes

00:06:33.619 --> 00:06:33.629 
and twist point the foot spread the toes

00:06:33.629 --> 00:06:36.999 
and twist point the foot spread the toes
so<00:06:34.349> just<00:06:34.529> two<00:06:34.709> more<00:06:34.829> times<00:06:35.009> you<00:06:35.219> can<00:06:35.339> do<00:06:35.459> it

00:06:36.999 --> 00:06:37.009 
so just two more times you can do it
