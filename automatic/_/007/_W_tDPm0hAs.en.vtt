almost impossible on a previous gen
simply<00:00:26.519> because<00:00:26.849> of<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:27.240> freezing<00:00:27.660> that<00:00:27.869> has

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
simply because of the freezing that has

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.950 
simply because of the freezing that has
been<00:00:28.260> taking<00:00:28.500> place<00:00:28.740> on<00:00:29.160> at<00:00:29.640> fifa<00:00:29.970> 14<00:00:30.179> on<00:00:30.630> my

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
been taking place on at fifa 14 on my

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.959 
been taking place on at fifa 14 on my
console<00:00:31.470> but<00:00:31.740> ever<00:00:32.189> since<00:00:32.460> I've<00:00:32.669> been<00:00:32.790> on<00:00:32.820> the

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
console but ever since I've been on the

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.180 
console but ever since I've been on the
Xbox<00:00:33.270> one<00:00:33.510> I<00:00:33.660> have<00:00:34.200> not<00:00:34.350> received<00:00:34.770> a<00:00:35.010> single

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
Xbox one I have not received a single

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.000 
Xbox one I have not received a single
freeze<00:00:36.149> and<00:00:36.480> it<00:00:36.719> seems<00:00:37.020> that<00:00:37.170> freezing<00:00:37.860> is

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
freeze and it seems that freezing is

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.850 
freeze and it seems that freezing is
something<00:00:38.520> of<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:38.969> past<00:00:39.000> on<00:00:39.629> at<00:00:40.020> fifa<00:00:40.320> 14<00:00:40.500> but

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
something of the past on at fifa 14 but

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.319 
something of the past on at fifa 14 but
now<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.040> freezing<00:00:41.520> has<00:00:41.820> gone<00:00:42.059> and<00:00:42.270> that

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
now the freezing has gone and that

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:43.340 
now the freezing has gone and that
something<00:00:42.629> that<00:00:42.660> we<00:00:42.809> don't<00:00:42.930> need<00:00:43.170> to<00:00:43.260> be

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
something that we don't need to be

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.619 
something that we don't need to be
worrying<00:00:43.620> about<00:00:43.739> are<00:00:44.280> now<00:00:44.730> left<00:00:45.149> with<00:00:45.450> the

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
worrying about are now left with the

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.319 
worrying about are now left with the
situation<00:00:46.289> do<00:00:46.680> i<00:00:46.789> restart<00:00:47.789> let's<00:00:48.120> play

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
situation do i restart let's play

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.420 
situation do i restart let's play
ultimate<00:00:48.660> team<00:00:48.840> so<00:00:49.350> that<00:00:49.379> i<00:00:49.559> can<00:00:49.649> restart<00:00:50.190> my

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
ultimate team so that i can restart my

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.040 
ultimate team so that i can restart my
record<00:00:50.789> so<00:00:51.090> that<00:00:51.270> I<00:00:51.300> don't<00:00:51.420> get<00:00:51.690> any<00:00:51.809> losses

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
record so that I don't get any losses

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.290 
record so that I don't get any losses
and<00:00:52.440> that<00:00:52.920> because<00:00:53.160> of<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.460> freezing<00:00:54.210> that

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
and that because of the freezing that

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.959 
and that because of the freezing that
did<00:00:54.510> take<00:00:54.660> a<00:00:54.719> did<00:00:55.199> occur<00:00:55.649> as<00:00:56.430> you<00:00:56.610> will<00:00:56.730> know

did take a did occur as you will know

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.029 
did take a did occur as you will know
for<00:00:57.329> example<00:00:57.420> looking<00:00:58.109> at<00:00:58.260> my<00:00:58.379> record<00:00:58.739> right

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
for example looking at my record right

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:04.369 
for example looking at my record right

those five losses every single one of
them<00:01:07.350> has<00:01:07.799> been<00:01:08.189> a<00:01:08.220> loss<00:01:08.580> due<00:01:08.970> to

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
them has been a loss due to

lost a game in the 90 minutes simply

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.170 
lost a game in the 90 minutes simply

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
because my opponent has beaten me so out

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.499 
because my opponent has beaten me so out
of<00:01:18.210> those<00:01:18.840> games<00:01:19.369> 23<00:01:20.369> games<00:01:20.549> played<00:01:20.880> I<00:01:21.119> am

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
insane so I don't know whether I should

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.819 
insane so I don't know whether I should
be<00:01:26.670> continuing<00:01:27.390> as<00:01:27.630> like<00:01:28.020> straight<00:01:28.439> off<00:01:28.619> now

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
just continuing on with that record or I

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.010 
just continuing on with that record or I
should<00:01:31.770> delete<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.490> club<00:01:32.729> and<00:01:32.939> restart<00:01:33.689> so
