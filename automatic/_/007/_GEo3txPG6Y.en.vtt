00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
 so hello I wanted to give you a quick look 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:05.850
 show that even in current windows 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.470
 version a little bit ms-dos 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.420
 slumbers at least a few small 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:13.230
 rest of the following trick works 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:16.619
 under windows nt so windows nt to nt 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:20.039
 6.3 under which I also show the nt 6.3 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:22.730
 is microsoft windows 8.1 the preview 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.960
 he's officially come out recently 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:27.060
 I also want to show that to others 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.490
 to show that this feature is also in 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.150
 the latest version is not yet 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:32.850
 was taken out 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.170
 the whole thing is a little editor like you 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.850
 that just before you see and 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.710
 probably also knows the windows 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.469
 editor also with a graphic 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:45.480
 Surface just but in ms dos style 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:47.250
 the whole thing works only under 32 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.850
 bit windows version 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.620
 whether the 32bit or 64bit you can do in 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.710
 the system control under system 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.870
 should sing the 64 bit you can 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.250
 the following command unfortunately not 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.690
 I have to perform here now 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:06.830
 virtual machine with 32 bit windows 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:09.510
 8.1 and will ever show the command 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:12.030
 So the normal editor knows that 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:15.180
 he is already under windows 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:19.979
 Included is the hat in English there 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:24.170
 you can just type in the text 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:27.360
 then stop just save drugs 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:30.240
 just a normal longer one 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:33.570
 text editor this one is also available now 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:36.180
 as I said in the steel even here 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.460
 this is windows 8.1 I can too 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.850
 show it very briefly if the whole 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.229
 already method one is quite classic 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.049
 and it works that way too 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:48.360
 windows start menu well i must be told 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:52.020
 use this startup farmer because 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:54.360
 I under windows 8.1 by default no 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:59.159
 usual start menu again you have 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:03.390
 are run 1 and the wifi invites you 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:05.159
 can also write the de.com and then 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.920
 just okay then that should be under 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.830
 windows 7 under windows 8 that too 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.620
 still on another 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.180
 Steidtmann is here in this in 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.590
 this this metro this tile 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.020
 surface and gets here too 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.850
 even as a search result it.com 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:23.040
 this is the new editor 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:23.040
 this is edith point com 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:30.210
 I'm just doing this here 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:32.590
 okay that does not work now 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:35.380
 we have to jump briefly at the desktop and 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.480
 that they must confirm and that must be one 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:41.980
 another feature will be installed 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:44.320
 namely the n tv.de mnt for windows nt 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:48.490
 new technology that it was that too 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:53.530
 Windows is no longer based 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:56.050
 that's why vdm needs virtual dos 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:59.530
 machine therefore needs a virtual 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:02.020
 Machine to be started in the 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:05.020
 which program is executed 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:05.380
 namely for 16 bit which programmed 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:07.030
 has been 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.550
 if I stop this here now 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:14.320
 or in salt or spring 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:18.180
 or click on this clique I got 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:18.180
 a message is not good here now 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:27.130
 aja mass is a 16 bit application you 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.930
 is not to it they are not to 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.340
 entitles you to 16 bit applications 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.340
 Check yours 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:36.940
 authority with the system administrator 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.720
 that means we have to pack this 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:41.680
 to install 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:43.000
 as well as otherwise than that relatively so 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.930
 or not so easily 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.930
 can perform 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:04.400
 so the installation is done i 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:06.620
 have him a bit fast forward or a 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.150
 played a little faster because that 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:10.010
 has taken in a short moment and me 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:12.410
 you did not want to wait unnecessarily 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:14.120
 so the following feature became 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:17.449
 successfully installed now easy 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:22.690
 close and ours appears here 

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:26.000
 Idea does not look that wonderful 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:27.380
 So who is beautiful blue background there 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:34.639
 we can now also completely normal 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:38.570
 hype our text hello that is 

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:43.010
 completely without further notice in windows 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:45.949
 while if you stay you right now 

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:49.940
 windows nt duo old nineties only 

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:51.620
 no , you too, it's still windows 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:55.820
 if that nt I can do it here 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:57.590
 overcome who show - boy ok 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:02.630
 but not extra now 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:06.830
 version 6.3 so nt 6.3 so can our 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:11.210
 editor he became 1995 this version 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:14.240
 2.0 brought out and you can 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:15.860
 for example, adjust the colors as 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:17.720
 For example, if you do not even have this 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:19.340
 black you want something here 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:22.250
 No one wants those blue ones anymore 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:23.870
 Set here what you wish for 

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:26.000
 Can set where to get a printer 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:26.599
 connected good usb is not for 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:34.180
 selection 

00:05:26.599 --> 00:05:34.180
 can be subdivided in the window 2 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:42.220
 You can now change the size of each one 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:42.970
 single window change okay that can 

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:46.449
 not me now 

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:49.620
 You can ask for words or words 

00:05:46.449 --> 00:05:54.570
 looking good the editor is in english 

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:56.830
 So German windows English editor 

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:59.050
 cut copy and paste 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:02.040
 delete well the standard function and 

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:05.290
 of course also save and print 

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:18.460
 saves and then we say for example 

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:21.970
 times desktop and call it hello okay and 

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:24.190
 now we have us has the 

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:28.080
 needed comic style 

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:33.120
 Now our normal editor gets the 

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:38.889
 and can read it so even more 

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:40.330
 upwardly compatible in any case 

00:06:38.889 --> 00:06:41.580
 maybe a funny thing who 

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:45.070
 want to try 

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:48.210
 like that with the village back then 

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:48.210
 certainly to see
