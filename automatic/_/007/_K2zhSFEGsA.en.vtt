around<00:05:58.669> 25k<00:05:59.630> I<00:05:59.990> think<00:06:00.410> he<00:06:00.979> is<00:06:01.160> pretty<00:06:01.610> slow<00:06:02.000> and

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:02.030 
around 25k I think he is pretty slow and

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:04.300 
around 25k I think he is pretty slow and
pretty<00:06:02.510> sluggish<00:06:02.900> it<00:06:03.380> does<00:06:03.650> have<00:06:03.830> forced<00:06:04.220> her

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:04.310 
pretty sluggish it does have forced her

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:05.950 
pretty sluggish it does have forced her
skills<00:06:04.610> so<00:06:04.760> you<00:06:04.849> can<00:06:05.030> skill<00:06:05.300> with<00:06:05.419> him<00:06:05.570> and

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:05.960 
skills so you can skill with him and

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:07.689 
skills so you can skill with him and
he's<00:06:06.050> a<00:06:06.080> pretty<00:06:06.410> decent<00:06:06.530> striker<00:06:07.160> but<00:06:07.430> again

00:06:07.689 --> 00:06:07.699 
he's a pretty decent striker but again
