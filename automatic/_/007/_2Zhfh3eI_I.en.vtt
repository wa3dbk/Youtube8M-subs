00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:32.160
 hello girls how are breakfast league and 

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:33.540
 then let's start doing the 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.660
 washing process I will explain 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:39.180
 step by step how I wash my hair 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:42.180
 this everything I do this remember 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:45.750
 that my hair here we see all this 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.250
 So far it is pure growth already 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.440
 where you see the rays and the 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:53.329
 illuminations 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:55.640
 this is hair hair old hair 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:58.519
 this is all growth if they are given 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.589
 account has grown me quite then 

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:03.049
 nothing else so that we have good a 

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:06.110
 idea of â€‹â€‹how much I have grown to 40 that my 

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:08.149
 hair is well curly is well Chinese or 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.799
 it's very frizzy because you see that in 

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:12.770
 different places call them different 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:14.720
 to curly hair then I could 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.030
 do now is that I'm going to put a shampoo 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.670
 I'll record well remember how you do not 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:22.100
 let's shampoo we're going to massage and 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:24.289
 we are going to massage with our fingers 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:27.560
 with the climbs that remain and that with 

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:29.479
 the fingers and we go to all that foam 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.399
 we give ourselves masses here back that 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:34.700
 It messes a lot of hair around here 

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:37.459
 the ears then is what I am going to 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:41.060
 do at this time I'm going to wash the 

00:01:37.459 --> 00:01:43.890
 hair I'm going to put on conditioner and 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:46.380
 I'm going to place 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.540
 work only to repair the 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:52.360
 hair damage says that leaves the 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:54.580
 soft and manageable hair 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.820
 ok girls also says that eliminates the 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.820
 frizz 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.899
 and that conceals the appearance of 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.939
 damaged tips now that I'm going to use 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:05.250
 made in pure conditioner and in the 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:08.160
 deep cream and already returned to Milan the 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.539
 hair measured shampoos this wants 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.849
 say that the first shampoo as has the 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.650
 hair is dirty and knows oil and everything 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:15.480
 what I do not do is almost 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.069
 time to measure a second shampoo for 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.590
 that enough foam would grow and so a 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:22.349
 pretty series I language well and 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:26.010
 then I put the conditioner on me 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:28.410
 He left me a little while, I massage him right now, nothing 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:32.160
 less and that like a towel and I'm not going to 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:34.410
 put the deep treatment how it 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:38.050
 feel 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:41.050
 says to put on all the hair 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.050
 massage 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.209
 when we have to fall we have wound 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:51.319
 not combed with a comb comb 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:53.450
 delgadito but of wide combs 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:56.690
 very good because I already stayed but almost 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:58.790
 always and I start from the tips 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:00.650
 and then up 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.430
 so it started not from the tips and 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.430
 12 well 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:15.340
 this feels different because when 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:18.459
 I put the shampoo on this hair 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:20.170
 I remain as very clean you know that 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:22.170
 we have the hair done it feels 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:26.180
 as rough 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:29.819
 when I put on the conditioner 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:31.590
 feel better but the truth was I was 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:35.599
 scaring now let's feel better the 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:38.250
 hair and so thousand 909 very slowly 

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:40.350
 starting from the tips but now 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.600
 with deep cream and you feel better 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:44.430
 it is very dry I also put the root 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.440
 of people who have face and curly 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.060
 but they do not have fat then they do not 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.530
 like to put yourself in the roots would be 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.720
 optional 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.970
 but right now if it feels softer 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:58.280
 more manageable the hair I'm going to take it out 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:58.280
 to see if how it feels to dry 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:03.870
 good girls then girls and 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:05.610
 guys, I've run out of lack but 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.049
 watch my video as I dry my 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:09.409
 hair you are going to realize how I 

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:09.409
 I dry it 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:17.450
 well it feels good smooth and if 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:17.450
 was in mind it looks bright 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:32.169
 1 - it stays if we stretch Murcia 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.169
 I'm going to pass the iron but 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:38.960
 take care of us month 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:38.960
 but if it feels very soft 

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:55.060
 I'm going to do is score points 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:02.930
 with the clamp will tilt the spigot 

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:04.520
 already keeps the tips deformities in 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:07.120
 the tips of return to see the 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.120
 final score 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:12.960
 well this is how nothing else I am 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:15.849
 doing the Chinese with the one who throws 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:20.879
 I put the hair 

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:20.879
 I turn around I leave it a little while 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.500
 and then I let it go 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:34.590
 that's how I know all the Chinese 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:39.160
 Look how nice they can be like that 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:44.650
 with your hand so as not to damage them much 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:46.930
 because if we then give ourselves with 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:49.259
 We combed with vanilla then they are not going to 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:49.259
 stay like this 

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:57.280
 it's better with the same hand 

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:59.880
 we settled and now what I 'm 

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:59.880
 doing is 

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:17.330
 now is the first time I use 

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:20.750
 conditioner shampoo and this is 

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:24.830
 this conditioner cream to this 

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:26.990
 strong or this cream and good if I liked it 

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:28.700
 yes i liked it i will keep using you 

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:30.050
 they know that the first time you do not feel 

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:32.080
 much the priority difference is 

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:34.910
 fighting brave then says about 673 

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:37.870
 right now super soft changes if 

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:37.870

00:06:38.289 --> 00:06:42.999
 well the Chinese who as they were 

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:48.339
 pretty or the curls as you want 

00:06:42.999 --> 00:06:51.460

00:06:48.339 --> 00:06:54.159
