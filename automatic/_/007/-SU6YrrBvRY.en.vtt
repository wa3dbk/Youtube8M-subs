 luiz opens the closet doors and chooses 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.680
 a disk troller bird given to grandmother who 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.680
 produces one of the favorite songs 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.949
 the advancement of technology and the 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:01.920
 to download music all the time in the 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.409
 internet this is a difficult scene to see 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.290
 but it is part of daily life, leave the 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:10.170
 26 year old guy in love with 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.630
 music and guitarist since the age of 11 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.690
 the vinyl record came into his life 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:20.759
 thanks to a ds impor if we like dolce 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:24.450
 df and ok is there the advantage of lp goes a lot 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:29.490
 besides the quality of the audio I sit uncle 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:33.240
 the cover on the plate then I'll get the 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:36.570
 needle holder place hundred I get 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:39.179
 I neither read the cover or it is a whole ritual 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.429
 is for you to have access to that thing that 

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:43.860
 you create an identity you know to 

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:45.450
 album cover you know the musicians who 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.610
 were on that album also that everything 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:51.210
 a historical context in the 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:53.009
 The boy's room is already 800 disks and 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.429
 incredible as it seems he remembers 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:59.579
 exactly where I bought each one but 

00:01:56.429 --> 00:02:00.780
 not so many options and of course they used it 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.930
 the favorites 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:06.210
 I think there are two genes as well is who 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:09.780
 will work hard is that to this one 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:13.079
 that I had placed was engraved on 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:17.549
 new york live music and has one of the 

00:02:13.079 --> 00:02:19.640
 movies that are the killers and I know 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:21.940
 which has a curious fact in this one the 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:25.630
 original cover 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:31.170
 of truth in which they truly open 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:31.170
 for a lot of fans it would be the only job 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:39.590
 The novelty is that the vlt the luxury item 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.450
 for collectors 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:44.750
 now can be purchased by any 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.800
 person the difference is that in the 40's 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.750
 when it was created 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:50.600
 the technology does not yet exist and 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:53.090
 allow certain advances this time they 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:55.460
 were made more resistant and some 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:58.670
 even colorful as is the case here 

00:02:55.460 --> 00:03:01.340
 even in less number than the cd the return 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:03.920
 of wine not only brought successes 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:06.080
 of the past but also to release songs 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.970
 unpublished interesting following question 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.650
 already playing classic things like 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:11.930
 example to edp jorge ben that is difficult 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:14.060
 know if they are even in being the same 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:16.040
 in places where powerful and it is 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.810
 now advancing with better quality and 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.300
 with them, ours you take the case with a 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.200
 pit these two brothers who do not 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.420
 had nothing 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:26.030
 he has previously given the 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:30.740
 shelves close up was surprised 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:32.660
 but left a doubt in the air it hurts to see this 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:35.990
 new wave of turning the vinyl 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:38.270
 My concern is not vinyl but the 

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:40.130
 The problem of playing the vinyl I think 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:43.160
 market gives for lack of such problems 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:45.050
 to play the vinyl then 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.760
 It's very good for me, but I have to 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:49.340
 have a device of their own accord 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:51.920
 answer to the question is simple 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:54.260
 they are also marketed more 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:56.390
 as the factory in Brazil is not having 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.790
 imported because it increases the 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:00.560
 price apart there has always been exchange 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:03.080
 so we have infections in the store 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.640
 It's important some drugs and 30 people 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:07.160
 here in case you do not have 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:09.080
 there is the option cid some people and that 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:11.090
 nor because of a vision sometimes 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:14.150
 we only have nobody the question is 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:16.010
 well maintained if you make maps pope 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:18.620
 nor do we think manager explains that the 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:20.870
 vinyl records are not cheap either 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:23.300
 the reason once again that manufacturing 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:25.550
 not true because the demand is very 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.870
 little still manufacturing around as 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:28.730
 make this setting a factory in america 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:30.740
 latina in rio de janeiro 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:31.880
 if there were several factories 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:36.040
 people working in various people 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:36.040
 counting would certainly be better 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:02.250
 the software is a little different for a long time 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:04.350
 time there was no vinyl sound in Brazil 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:08.010
 vinyl record or long play began to 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:09.960
 losing space for the cd in 1992 is now 

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:13.080
 the cd that is losing space for 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:15.180
 other formats like mp3 for example but 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:17.490
 now with the vinyl back is fine 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:20.570
 likely that the cd still has a 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:20.570
 trickster is life
