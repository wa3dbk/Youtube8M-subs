00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:15.500
 b 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.500
 Thank you 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:23.810
 I do not know why it takes 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.609
 I did not like it 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.029
 this action is to say that of someone who 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:28.029
 he has just died 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.680
 of the diabolical 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.860
 that's not usually heard in too many 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.770
 burials you do not cry for her and hours for 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.650
 oliver 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:48.450
 Where is 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:51.670
 because he has not come I do not know if he is 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:54.360
 smart will have returned to his island to 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.360
 hide 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:59.020
 maybe attend your funerals 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:09.670
 we are poisoned so see roy me 

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:12.189
 remember barrel and that makes me think 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:14.020
 in the laboratories to be where they are looking 

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:17.380
 an antidote for the curo looks that we 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.670
 would do very well now yes especially 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.890
 now that Isabella Roser has been 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.600
 injected that substance like the suns 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.340
 because it's the only way to follow 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.180
 alive after receiving a shot with a 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.180
 hollow point bullet 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.610
 I've left hundreds of messages to 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:34.790
 oliver telling him to turn around or 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:39.660
 I have not responded because I was lucky 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:42.450
 much and all bad has not used its 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:45.180
 passport or their phones or their accounts 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.620
 currents or what's left of them and the 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.000
 recognition program has not 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:51.570
 located no airport or 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.400
 no station go and what about sara 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:57.310
 neither nothing 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:02:01.380
 nobody disappears like that except that they do not 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.380
 say happy and if so 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.409
 and if oliver is maybe the reason that 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.229
 can not find it is he is still alive 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.720
 happy 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:14.269
 if it were not so Isabella Roser and we 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.830
 would have said believe me is alive then 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:17.239
 I hope you find it because I already 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.180
 I do not know where to look for it or to whom 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:22.469
 ask 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.469

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:21.560
 exposed to the miraculous enough to 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:24.440
