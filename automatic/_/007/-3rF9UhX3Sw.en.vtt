00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:30.910
 to 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.920
 and such 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:47.800
 because he had to marry by force with the 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.960
 Prince that we can not decide 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:59.560
 we loved 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:59.560
 [Music] 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:05.150
 maybe we could go to where the king is 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:09.380
 to talk about the young man and he's very good 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:11.250
 listen and it's great 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:14.510
 roses 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.510
 because we leave it 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:33.700
 [Music] 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.700
 Y 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.940
 and I asked them 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:02:05.549
 Where is 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:02:08.549

 [Music] 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.770
 it has nothing 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:40.490
 [Music] 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.350
 touch of not using 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:46.400
 why 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:49.489
 [Music] 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:52.819
 has been a lot of boldness and pretension 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:56.800
 your believe that you could beat me to 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:03:02.280
 me the empress of evil 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:02.280
 there you have your precious princess 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:14.099
 [Music] 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:19.220
 dear, I will never forgive myself the harm that 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:19.220
 I've done it, we're all guilty
