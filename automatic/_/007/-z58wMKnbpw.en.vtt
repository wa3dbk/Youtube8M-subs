issues I had a dream of and I think we

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:40.380

were married and I gave birth to a
cartoon<00:01:40.810> cat<00:01:41.080> I<00:01:41.410> think<00:01:41.860> it's<00:01:41.950> kind<00:01:42.099> of<00:01:42.160> genius

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:42.369

I<00:01:42.640> think<00:01:42.819> it<00:01:42.879> shows<00:01:43.119> the<00:01:43.599> sense<00:01:43.810> of<00:01:43.899> humor<00:01:44.200> that

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:44.229 
I think it shows the sense of humor that

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:47.400 
I think it shows the sense of humor that
NBC<00:01:44.920> has<00:01:45.239> about<00:01:46.239> the<00:01:46.420> industry<00:01:46.810> itself<00:01:47.170> and<00:01:47.379> I

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:47.410 
NBC has about the industry itself and I

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:49.139 
NBC has about the industry itself and I
think<00:01:47.440> it<00:01:47.920> really<00:01:48.160> comes<00:01:48.340> down<00:01:48.459> to<00:01:48.610> Tina<00:01:48.910> Fey<00:01:49.119> I

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:49.149 
think it really comes down to Tina Fey I

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:51.419 
think it really comes down to Tina Fey I
think<00:01:49.420> they<00:01:49.539> really<00:01:49.869> trust<00:01:50.110> ena<00:01:50.470> Fey<00:01:50.679> and<00:01:50.950> her

00:01:51.419 --> 00:01:51.429 
think they really trust ena Fey and her

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:58.440 
think they really trust ena Fey and her
sense<00:01:51.640> of<00:01:51.819> comedy<00:01:52.269> and<00:01:52.509> then<00:01:52.810> I<00:01:52.840> dream<00:01:57.450> so
