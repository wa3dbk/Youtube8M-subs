00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:20.599
 hello to all and half and half 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.360
 found for a video tutorial kama 

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:24.860
 so it's a video that's who who 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.349
 do not last long it's a trick 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:30.310
 which was offered to me by a subscriber 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:32.029
 is yellow says thomas 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:33.850
 so we're going right now 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:37.060
 finally I'll show you right away 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.320
 at the principle is quite simple already 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:40.090
 so you can do it on all 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.350
 resources that usually by quickly 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:44.300
 because they are wanted 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.780
 so here we go for example we'll go 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.780
 to minors 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.960
 here we are going to buy 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:54.910
 this is it 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.460
 it's hard to change my connection to the 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:58.860
 trouble I take 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.780
 so for example already have to find a 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:04.350
 valuable resource buying by are 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:07.540
 so you see by dc 6,999 here 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.850
 1700 finally benefit of sankara gently 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:13.689
 but all that is kind 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:15.850
 kind for example that's it if you in 

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:17.979
 buy as his share the other way 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.509
 then say the water you do 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:23.310
 well 5000 kama you make 15000 

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:25.290
 camatte benefit for their box 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.210
 ok why not that it must be 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.649
 someone who does the trick of if 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.360
 someone makes more than 2 million 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:32.400
 the cfr 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.750
 nor ip because actually if the chair 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.690
 empty like me from time to time in 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.070
 pressing loop input bah that 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:39.580
 can you buy that so it's 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.050
 be careful 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.510
 so we'll do it on the deer by 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:45.640
 example here we are going to buy one 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:48.330
 the other way 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.420
 here we will then be able to resell it 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:52.189
 So there we take the time here 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.350
 we make a lot 10 and we will sell it 

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:57.490
 at 2400 for example 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.490
 so the 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.830
 there you go for four years 1000th 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:04.370
 camatte just profits on this 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.370
 resource there 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:10.590
 so if this is normally'm wrong 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.310
 no way the state is used in 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.870
 a lot of minerals 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.490
 in a lot of ouhlala ores 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.840
 a lot of 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:20.460
 important kraft you see there are some 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.920
 a whole loop 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:24.720
 but see them 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.070
 so usually it sells fast enough 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.460
 ah we can do it on what else 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:32.120
 can do it on 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:36.140
 gold bars not the mani 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:37.580
 the bonuses cno bac el elite mans 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.270
 can do it on thing or not the 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:43.120
 cobalt night see we can do 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:45.970
 twenty thousand camatte profits we can 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:48.150
 do on coal too you know 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.400
 make a hundred thousand profits 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.400
 you see it's a very, very trick 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.860
 simple 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.959
