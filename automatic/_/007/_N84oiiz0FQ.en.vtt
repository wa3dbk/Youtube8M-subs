00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
code so you can go around Duriez and

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.960 
code so you can go around Duriez and
purok<00:01:40.110> there's<00:01:40.350> a<00:01:40.409> lot<00:01:40.590> of<00:01:40.619> codes<00:01:41.340> interrupt

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
purok there's a lot of codes interrupt

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.910 
purok there's a lot of codes interrupt
that<00:01:42.630> alarm<00:01:43.130> tell<00:01:44.130> you<00:01:44.720> a<00:01:45.720> lot<00:01:46.200> of<00:01:46.350> stuff<00:01:46.619> I

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
supposed to count on here this looks

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:45.130 
supposed to count on here this looks
like<00:02:42.360> some<00:02:42.660> kind<00:02:42.690> of<00:02:42.900> ship<00:02:43.290> you<00:02:44.220> can<00:02:44.370> see<00:02:44.550> it

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.850 
like some kind of ship you can see it
but<00:02:46.140> it's<00:02:46.530> kind<00:02:47.040> of<00:02:47.069> weird<00:02:48.410> and<00:02:49.410> then<00:02:49.560> hold<00:02:49.739> on

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
but it's kind of weird and then hold on

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.380 
but it's kind of weird and then hold on
let<00:02:50.069> me<00:02:50.099> look<00:02:50.160> for<00:02:50.580> a<00:02:50.610> while<00:02:50.790> because<00:02:50.940> I<00:02:51.150> really

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
let me look for a while because I really

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:52.620 
let me look for a while because I really
see

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
see

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:57.400 
see
you<00:02:53.630> got<00:02:53.810> a<00:02:53.840> lot<00:02:54.050> of<00:02:54.080> equations<00:02:54.980> here<00:02:56.260> so<00:02:57.260> you

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
you got a lot of equations here so you

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.260 
you got a lot of equations here so you
can<00:02:57.560> see<00:02:57.590> probably<00:02:58.460> what<00:02:58.700> most<00:02:58.880> people<00:02:59.240> just

00:02:59.260 --> 00:02:59.270 
can see probably what most people just

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:03.100 
can see probably what most people just
see<00:02:59.630> just<00:03:00.500> the<00:03:00.620> equations<00:03:01.240> but<00:03:02.240> they<00:03:02.930> have<00:03:03.080> a

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110 
see just the equations but they have a

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:09.310 
see just the equations but they have a
focus<00:03:03.740> on<00:03:04.040> right<00:03:05.030> there<00:03:05.890> the<00:03:06.890> element<00:03:07.760> 114<00:03:08.450> and

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320 
focus on right there the element 114 and

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:13.300 
focus on right there the element 114 and
now<00:03:09.440> I'm<00:03:09.500> going<00:03:09.650> 115<00:03:09.980> and<00:03:12.160> everyone<00:03:13.160> probably

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
now I'm going 115 and everyone probably

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.850 
now I'm going 115 and everyone probably
knows<00:03:13.459> this<00:03:13.730> but<00:03:14.260> experiment<00:03:15.260> 935<00:03:15.680> was

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:15.860 
knows this but experiment 935 was

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.400 
knows this but experiment 935 was
successful<00:03:16.340> we've<00:03:17.180> probably<00:03:17.420> created<00:03:18.170> the

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 
successful we've probably created the

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:20.949 
successful we've probably created the
zombies<00:03:19.190> or<00:03:19.640> something<00:03:20.030> or<00:03:20.209> teleportation

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
zombies or something or teleportation

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:23.850 
zombies or something or teleportation
stuff<00:03:21.560> that's<00:03:22.310> why<00:03:22.400> 935<00:03:23.060> written<00:03:23.450> everywhere

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:23.860 
stuff that's why 935 written everywhere

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:26.170 
stuff that's why 935 written everywhere
and<00:03:24.860> there's<00:03:25.040> another<00:03:25.190> board<00:03:25.459> over<00:03:25.640> here<00:03:25.670> but

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
and there's another board over here but

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.420 
and there's another board over here but
that's<00:03:26.870> the<00:03:26.959> exact<00:03:27.260> same<00:03:27.410> the<00:03:27.590> other<00:03:27.620> one<00:03:27.860> and

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 
that's the exact same the other one and

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:30.370 
that's the exact same the other one and
look<00:03:28.550> at<00:03:28.640> that<00:03:28.760> says<00:03:28.970> help<00:03:29.150> huh<00:03:29.750> never<00:03:30.140> notice

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:30.380 
look at that says help huh never notice

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:35.800 
look at that says help huh never notice
that<00:03:30.640> but<00:03:32.290> the<00:03:33.290> help<00:03:33.440> on<00:03:33.590> the<00:03:33.650> other<00:03:33.739> one<00:03:34.810> yeah

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
that but the help on the other one yeah

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:40.000 
that but the help on the other one yeah
it<00:03:35.870> does<00:03:36.050> huh<00:03:36.410> but<00:03:37.250> right<00:03:38.209> here<00:03:38.360> it<00:03:38.660> says<00:03:39.010> that

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
it does huh but right here it says that

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:41.560 
it does huh but right here it says that
there's<00:03:40.310> radiation<00:03:40.670> we<00:03:41.239> should<00:03:41.420> wear<00:03:41.540> a

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:41.570 
there's radiation we should wear a

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:44.830 
there's radiation we should wear a
radiation<00:03:42.080> suit<00:03:43.300> there's<00:03:44.300> a<00:03:44.390> bunch<00:03:44.570> of<00:03:44.660> like

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
radiation suit there's a bunch of like

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.250 
radiation suit there's a bunch of like
skulls<00:03:45.790> it<00:03:46.790> kind<00:03:47.000> of<00:03:47.030> looks<00:03:47.090> like<00:03:47.270> bugs<00:03:47.720> maybe

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260 
skulls it kind of looks like bugs maybe

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.620 
skulls it kind of looks like bugs maybe
they're<00:03:48.410> trying<00:03:48.709> to<00:03:48.770> step<00:03:48.980> on<00:03:49.100> on<00:03:49.220> bugs<00:03:49.630> maybe

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:50.630 
they're trying to step on on bugs maybe

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:52.330 
they're trying to step on on bugs maybe
on<00:03:50.900> the<00:03:51.140> next<00:03:51.170> one<00:03:51.560> that<00:03:51.680> lets<00:03:51.860> swarms<00:03:52.280> and

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.340 
on the next one that lets swarms and

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:53.920 
on the next one that lets swarms and
zombie<00:03:52.730> bugs<00:03:52.970> it'll<00:03:53.270> be<00:03:53.330> kind<00:03:53.510> of<00:03:53.540> stupid

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
zombie bugs it'll be kind of stupid

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:57.810 
zombie bugs it'll be kind of stupid
though<00:03:54.050> and<00:03:54.610> then<00:03:55.610> here's<00:03:56.030> the<00:03:56.230> zombie<00:03:57.230> dog

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:57.820 
though and then here's the zombie dog

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:02.080 
though and then here's the zombie dog
head<00:03:58.820> so<00:03:59.830> if<00:04:00.830> you<00:04:00.920> find<00:04:01.100> any<00:04:01.340> more<00:04:01.549> stuff<00:04:01.850> on

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 
head so if you find any more stuff on

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:04.060 
head so if you find any more stuff on
the<00:04:02.209> Illuminati<00:04:02.690> code<00:04:03.019> and<00:04:03.350> like<00:04:03.470> you<00:04:03.590> dakotas

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:04.070 
the Illuminati code and like you dakotas

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:05.770 
the Illuminati code and like you dakotas
it<00:04:04.160> and<00:04:04.280> stuff<00:04:04.489> don't<00:04:05.299> keep<00:04:05.480> it<00:04:05.600> to<00:04:05.630> yourself

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:05.780 
it and stuff don't keep it to yourself

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:07.900 
it and stuff don't keep it to yourself
you<00:04:06.350> should<00:04:06.830> probably<00:04:07.010> share<00:04:07.610> that

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:07.910 
you should probably share that

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:10.270 
you should probably share that
information<00:04:08.900> especially<00:04:09.500> with<00:04:09.860> me<00:04:10.010> because

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280 
information especially with me because

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.650 
information especially with me because
I'm<00:04:10.400> dying<00:04:10.640> to<00:04:10.760> know<00:04:10.850> so<00:04:11.299> get<00:04:12.290> back<00:04:12.440> to<00:04:12.500> me
