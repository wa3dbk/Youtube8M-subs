strong so the top of the back you can

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.660 
strong so the top of the back you can
kind<00:01:07.049> of<00:01:07.110> see<00:01:07.320> zoom<00:01:07.979> in<00:01:08.159> so<00:01:08.280> you<00:01:08.369> can<00:01:08.549> get<00:01:08.640> a

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
kind of see zoom in so you can get a

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.719 
kind of see zoom in so you can get a
better<00:01:08.820> shot<00:01:08.909> of<00:01:09.240> that<00:01:10.159> you<00:01:11.159> can<00:01:11.310> see<00:01:11.490> where

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
better shot of that you can see where

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.050 
better shot of that you can see where
the<00:01:11.970> pin<00:01:12.869> engages<00:01:13.520> actually<00:01:14.520> locks<00:01:14.760> on<00:01:14.970> the

the pin engages actually locks on the
knife<00:01:15.210> gives<00:01:15.869> it<00:01:16.020> a<00:01:16.080> really<00:01:16.200> nice<00:01:16.380> strong

solid lock up really hard for that to
fail<00:01:20.520> I<00:01:20.850> don't<00:01:21.270> know<00:01:21.360> how<00:01:21.540> that<00:01:21.600> could<00:01:21.930> fail

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
fail I don't know how that could fail

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.120 
fail I don't know how that could fail
you<00:01:22.530> know<00:01:22.619> it's<00:01:22.770> not<00:01:22.860> like<00:01:22.950> you're<00:01:23.070> gonna

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
lot of the other locking systems where

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.170 
lot of the other locking systems where
you<00:01:28.290> can<00:01:28.439> accidentally<00:01:28.979> disengage<00:01:29.490> that<00:01:29.759> you

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.039 
know if you're disengaging that you're
doing<00:01:31.950> it<00:01:32.070> on<00:01:32.189> purpose<00:01:32.689> so<00:01:33.689> it's<00:01:33.780> a<00:01:33.840> really

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
doing it on purpose so it's a really

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.440 
doing it on purpose so it's a really
solid<00:01:34.229> lock<00:01:34.590> up<00:01:34.770> system<00:01:35.189> and<00:01:35.400> works<00:01:36.240> really

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
solid lock up system and works really

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.319 
solid lock up system and works really
really<00:01:36.570> well<00:01:37.790> alright<00:01:38.790> let's<00:01:38.820> take<00:01:39.000> a<00:01:39.060> closer

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
really well alright let's take a closer

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.450 
really well alright let's take a closer
look<00:01:39.420> at<00:01:39.630> this<00:01:39.720> and<00:01:39.930> talk<00:01:40.110> about<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.500> specs<00:01:40.799> so

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
look at this and talk about the specs so

rather<00:02:50.430> have<00:02:50.670> it<00:02:50.700> on<00:02:50.910> the<00:02:51.030> other<00:02:51.180> side<00:02:51.710> so<00:02:52.710> this

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
rather have it on the other side so this

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.030 
rather have it on the other side so this
is<00:02:53.070> gonna<00:02:53.250> be<00:02:53.750> tip<00:02:54.750> up<00:02:54.930> carry<00:02:55.260> you<00:02:55.740> can<00:02:55.890> see

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
is gonna be tip up carry you can see

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.640 
is gonna be tip up carry you can see
it's<00:02:56.190> not<00:02:56.430> drilled<00:02:57.300> there<00:02:57.960> on<00:02:58.080> the<00:02:58.200> other<00:02:58.350> side

it's not drilled there on the other side
I<00:02:58.680> suppose<00:02:58.950> you<00:02:59.190> could<00:02:59.340> drill<00:02:59.520> it<00:02:59.610> if<00:02:59.700> you

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
I suppose you could drill it if you

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.520 
I suppose you could drill it if you
really<00:03:00.000> want<00:03:00.180> to<00:03:00.360> I<00:03:00.540> don't<00:03:00.900> know<00:03:00.990> how<00:03:01.140> that<00:03:01.200> and

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
really want to I don't know how that and

really want to I don't know how that and
if<00:03:01.620> your<00:03:01.770> interfere<00:03:02.310> with<00:03:02.460> the<00:03:02.550> mechanism<00:03:03.030> of

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
if your interfere with the mechanism of

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.000 
if your interfere with the mechanism of
the<00:03:03.210> knife<00:03:03.360> but<00:03:03.960> you<00:03:04.260> can<00:03:04.380> see<00:03:04.530> it's<00:03:04.710> drilled

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
the knife but you can see it's drilled

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.200 
the knife but you can see it's drilled
for<00:03:05.640> tip<00:03:05.880> up<00:03:06.060> carry<00:03:06.390> I<00:03:07.640> turn<00:03:08.640> it<00:03:08.820> around<00:03:08.880> let

for tip up carry I turn it around let
you<00:03:09.330> see<00:03:09.480> the<00:03:09.570> different<00:03:09.870> parts<00:03:10.020> of<00:03:10.200> it<00:03:10.350> and

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
you see the different parts of it and

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.480 
you see the different parts of it and
everything<00:03:12.710> really<00:03:13.710> nice<00:03:13.860> little<00:03:14.070> knife<00:03:14.280> I
