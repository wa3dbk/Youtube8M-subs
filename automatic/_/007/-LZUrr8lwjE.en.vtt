00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.250
 good girls today we are going to do 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:06.089
 Mediterranean Pasta salad 

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:09.150
 then what we are going to occupy 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:12.509
 first obviously it's pasta and this one 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:15.120
 is the roti type ni and is integral is the 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.340
 generic brand of franz mayer and they see 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.760
 which is 100% integral 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:24.539
 let's use a cucumber an onion 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.830
 a green pepper cherry tomatoes if not 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.390
 you have closing themes is the same you can 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.099
 use normal tomato and chop it in 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.219
 cubes but I like the chefs 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.630
 for this type of installed because the 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.000
 normal tomato well as well as that 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.340
 Disbands dissolved juice and I like this 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.740
 more the presentation 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.240
 you can use black olives if you 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:44.490
 they like me I love you I'm going to 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:47.600
 use black olives 

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:51.059
 this is optional these are jackson art 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:53.770
 artichokes, I bought them at costco 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.960
 this generic brand of kirkland 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:59.080
 Italian dressing this one sells from all 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:01.060
 sides obviously salt and pepper and 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:03.660
 our protein because it's basically 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:05.620
 a vegetarian recipe is feta cheese 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.450
 so this is a recipe that you 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:10.210
 you can use when you just do not 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:12.670
 I understand that eating meat you do not want 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:15.250
 detoxify from the meat some day or the 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:17.560
 picture in the next lent as a 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.910
 recipe that you eat on Friday and well what 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.979
 first thing I'm going to do is boil water 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:23.710
 to put my pasta and while the water 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:26.530
 boil I go to your home and bite my 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:28.450
 recipe book and here is my little one if they see 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.850
 I left the shell because all the fiber 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.950
 is in the shell then we're going to 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.420
 try making a nutritious salad the 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.190
 which is in cubes and I said the 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.960
 seeds do not bother me but I know that 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:40.000
 many people do not like them if they do not 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:43.390
 you like you can withdraw them if you want to 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.759
 Remove the onion from a lot of onion 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.140
 but I like it very much if I 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:49.360
 I start to take a little of this in room 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.340
 to work I will make sure to bring 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.170
 chewing gum in the bag because I do not want 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.710
 have onion breath at work 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:02:00.220
 just now piquÃ© in ulna / 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:02.080
 true also everything in cubes 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.910
 as soon as I need some obvious I'm not going to 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.310
 use the whole can I'm just going to use 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:08.170
 I like them very much so 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.970
 I will try to use enough and 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.220
 I'm going to chop in four I do not like 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:15.460
 use them whole because if it is a very flavor 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:18.450
 strong then I 'm going I'll cut them 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:20.890
 in four holes in slices or in 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.900
 short, this is about a 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.030
 a little less than half a can I think 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.810
 that will be enough, the rest I will 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.810
 put in a tupperware 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.980
 the artichoke hearts come in 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:36.109
 halves in quarters take a few and 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.900
 I'm dicing are the 

00:02:36.109 --> 00:02:40.569
 artichokes I'm going to play my tomatoes and 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.790
 add them here so much 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:45.120
 I add my tomatoes and they fix it is a 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:49.470
 pasta is a salad 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:51.750
 with many colors my pasta is beautiful 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.580
 and I was boiling for 11 minutes I'm going 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.030
 to remove from the water and add it to the 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.250
 salad 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.690
 My pasta is super hot right now 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.330
 to be able to add the salad not the 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:04.040
 I want to add boiling so I'm going 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.880
 to leave running for cold water 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.820
 for two reasons 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:11.270
 then the patient has to be 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:11.270
 it's cold 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:18.510
 the cold water also stops cooking 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:21.030
 of the pasta then well it is not followed 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:23.189
 hot and you leave it hot it's going to 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.920
 continue cooking then the cold water 

00:03:23.189 --> 00:03:27.420
 stop that heat you have the cooking and 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.129
 leave it al dente 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:31.859
 I'm not going to let it drain all that 

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:34.170
 excess of water because I do not want so no 

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:36.239
 I want that water in my salad if you 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:38.879
 you want this may be your salad 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:40.890
 you can add the cheese on the right and 

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:44.010
 salt and pepper and there you have a 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:47.609
 perfect salad for when you do 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:49.739
 barbecue your roasts as a companion what 

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:51.299
 I'm going to do more as main course goes to 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:54.359
 be my lunch then I will add the 

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:56.040
 pasta this is going to give a lot of salad 

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:58.250
 this I think can feed as 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.200
 about 5 or 6 people 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:02.750
 and if you do not want me to be a vegetarian 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:05.810
 you can chop chicken breast you can 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:08.510
 Slicing chicken breast and add it to 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:11.300
 the salad and so you have a protein 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:13.070
 animal then now I'm going to shake very 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:17.440
 you 're Italian because you have all 

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:17.440
 these spices 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.170
 salt and pepper 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:29.890
 and our feta cheese the feta cheese is 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:32.260
 very acidic then it's perfect for 

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:34.270
 installed if you have that is offer 

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:36.330
 You can use whole cheese, fresh cheese 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:38.789
 Panela cheese 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:42.030
 of what you have but to make it 

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:45.199
 really mediterranean salad yo 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:45.199
 I use the peta 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:54.050
 and this is going to let it cool 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:56.330
 soon in an hour so that all 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:58.400
 the flavors mix that is the lapse 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:00.560
 true for the paste to absorb the 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.240
 dressing and grip good flavor 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:04.940
 then we will see it let cool 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:08.800
 and we will eat it later I hope that 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:08.800
 enjoy good you go me
