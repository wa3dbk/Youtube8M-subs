you<00:00:29.029> can<00:00:29.300> always<00:00:29.419> replace<00:00:29.630> the<00:00:30.050> runner

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:30.230 
you can always replace the runner

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:31.720 
you can always replace the runner
instead<00:00:30.439> of<00:00:30.589> having<00:00:30.769> to<00:00:31.220> replace<00:00:31.460> the<00:00:31.550> whole

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:31.730 
instead of having to replace the whole

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.420 
instead of having to replace the whole
skate<00:00:32.150> or<00:00:32.360> the<00:00:32.480> hole<00:00:32.630> holder<00:00:33.110> going<00:00:34.010> on<00:00:34.160> to<00:00:34.340> the

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:34.430 
skate or the hole holder going on to the

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:36.010 
skate or the hole holder going on to the
outsole<00:00:34.970> it's<00:00:35.150> gonna<00:00:35.270> be<00:00:35.360> a<00:00:35.390> still<00:00:35.570> a<00:00:35.600> plastic

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:36.020

outsole as they're calling injected

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:39.160 
outsole as they're calling injected

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:41.000 
lightweight feel so offering a little

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.430 
lightweight feel so offering a little
forgiveness<00:00:41.300> so<00:00:41.690> this<00:00:41.780> is<00:00:41.900> gonna<00:00:42.080> for<00:00:42.380> the

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:42.440 
forgiveness so this is gonna for the

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.020 
forgiveness so this is gonna for the
player<00:00:42.650> that<00:00:42.860> already<00:00:43.340> knows<00:00:43.490> how<00:00:43.640> to<00:00:43.700> skate

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.030 
player that already knows how to skate

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:45.460 
player that already knows how to skate
but<00:00:44.270> still<00:00:44.540> kind<00:00:44.720> of<00:00:44.750> fine-tuning<00:00:45.350> their

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:45.470 
but still kind of fine-tuning their

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:47.920 
but still kind of fine-tuning their
skill<00:00:45.710> a<00:00:45.740> little<00:00:45.890> bit<00:00:46.100> nice<00:00:46.820> jump<00:00:47.300> and<00:00:47.480> support

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:47.930 
skill a little bit nice jump and support

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:49.450 
skill a little bit nice jump and support
in<00:00:48.050> the<00:00:48.140> quarter<00:00:48.440> package<00:00:48.650> from<00:00:49.070> what<00:00:49.220> you<00:00:49.310> saw

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:49.460 
in the quarter package from what you saw

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.640 
in the quarter package from what you saw
in<00:00:49.550> the<00:00:49.640> EQ<00:00:49.970> 20<00:00:50.330> skate<00:00:50.600> they're<00:00:51.230> using

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:51.650 
in the EQ 20 skate they're using

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:52.870 
in the EQ 20 skate they're using
actually<00:00:51.950> what<00:00:52.040> they<00:00:52.130> call<00:00:52.340> here<00:00:52.550> a<00:00:52.580> hyper

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:52.880 
actually what they call here a hyper

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.210 
actually what they call here a hyper
light<00:00:53.300> so<00:00:53.900> it's<00:00:54.020> not<00:00:54.140> exactly<00:00:54.650> the<00:00:54.770> same<00:00:55.010> type

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:55.220 
light so it's not exactly the same type

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:56.740 
light so it's not exactly the same type
foams<00:00:55.550> that<00:00:55.730> you<00:00:55.820> see<00:00:55.970> on<00:00:56.090> the<00:00:56.210> Ford<00:00:56.480> year<00:00:56.630> the

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:56.750 
foams that you see on the Ford year the

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.450 
foams that you see on the Ford year the
50<00:00:57.140> but<00:00:57.560> it's<00:00:57.680> still<00:00:57.770> going<00:00:57.920> to<00:00:57.950> offer<00:00:58.100> some

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.460 
50 but it's still going to offer some

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.520 
50 but it's still going to offer some
great<00:00:58.580> moldable<00:00:59.210> properties<00:00:59.720> really<00:01:00.320> give

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
great moldable properties really give

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.380 
great moldable properties really give
you<00:01:00.590> a<00:01:00.650> nice<00:01:00.890> secure<00:01:01.370> custom<00:01:01.880> fit<00:01:02.120> out<00:01:02.270> of<00:01:02.300> the

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
you a nice secure custom fit out of the

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.499 
you a nice secure custom fit out of the
skate<00:01:02.720> moving<00:01:03.620> on<00:01:03.830> they're<00:01:04.580> not<00:01:04.729> using<00:01:05.030> any<00:01:05.390> of

00:01:05.499 --> 00:01:05.509 
skate moving on they're not using any of

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:08.110 
skate moving on they're not using any of
the<00:01:06.080> embedded<00:01:06.710> zones<00:01:06.950> with<00:01:07.520> as<00:01:07.700> far<00:01:07.850> as<00:01:07.970> like<00:01:08.090> a

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:08.120 
the embedded zones with as far as like a

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.120 
the embedded zones with as far as like a
composite<00:01:08.780> material<00:01:08.840> but<00:01:09.620> it's<00:01:09.740> actually<00:01:10.040> an

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
composite material but it's actually an

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:11.980 
composite material but it's actually an
injected<00:01:10.790> so<00:01:11.150> you're<00:01:11.300> getting<00:01:11.630> a<00:01:11.690> little<00:01:11.810> more

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 
injected so you're getting a little more

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:13.330 
injected so you're getting a little more
support<00:01:12.380> so<00:01:12.410> you<00:01:12.530> have<00:01:12.710> that<00:01:12.800> going<00:01:13.070> down<00:01:13.160> the

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
support so you have that going down the

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:14.770 
support so you have that going down the
tendon<00:01:13.700> guard<00:01:13.880> which<00:01:14.030> is<00:01:14.060> gonna<00:01:14.300> give<00:01:14.420> you<00:01:14.570> the

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
tendon guard which is gonna give you the

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.050 
tendon guard which is gonna give you the
staple<00:01:15.350> of<00:01:15.380> your<00:01:15.650> skate<00:01:15.920> and<00:01:16.070> then<00:01:16.610> you<00:01:16.850> have

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:18.650 
that same injecting material running

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:20.770 
that same injecting material running
along<00:01:18.860> the<00:01:18.890> ice<00:01:19.130> at<00:01:19.400> the<00:01:19.610> eyelets<00:01:20.090> which<00:01:20.630> is

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
along the ice at the eyelets which is

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:21.790 
along the ice at the eyelets which is
really<00:01:20.960> going<00:01:21.050> to<00:01:21.110> allow<00:01:21.200> you<00:01:21.290> get<00:01:21.470> over<00:01:21.680> the
