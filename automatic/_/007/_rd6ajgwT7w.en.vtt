00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.690
 in this video we will tell how to reduce 

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:07.850
 Hip-Hop Hip-Hop Bring down completely different 

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:11.809
 rather than chaos and other styles of e 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:13.730
 music there are no hard and fast rules but i 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:17.989
 show you the three most common 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:23.949
 Ways first this mix second card 3 

00:00:17.989 --> 00:00:27.560
 hide consider first pop-music 

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:31.279
 data is the closest way with 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:33.050
 method of mixing house music now we 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:35.930
 let's reduce the composition with the provider 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:40.010
 at the same time on the left languages â€‹â€‹use the laser 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:41.960
 and the crossfader that everything I rhythmically 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:50.840
 I will control the left deck track 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:55.240
 headphones, I do not forget about the right 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.240
 the time of the conclusion of the new track and square 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:11.260
 we can count china 1 2 3 4 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:11.260
 we choose you this you starve a number 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:22.930
 output track crossfader add base 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:32.130
 working am crossfader this 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:34.650
 the demonstration I kept the tracks traditional 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.900
 fucking way in the next demo 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.600
 I will make a quick transition between 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.760
 compositions 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:44.490
 Especially opening the fader I will not 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.900
 use equalizer for fast 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.720
 transition between tracks 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:51.090
 and i only use anus crossfader and 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.990
 the horse also I use hide about which 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.990
 I'll tell you now 

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:18.230
 site itself is published by ecstasy and 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:23.360
 it was simple like without equalizer i 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:25.460
 used only crossfader i 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.590
 used a little baby scratch for 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:31.100
 In order to make the mix more interesting I 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:33.500
 I think the whole model gratis let's 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:35.330
 talk about scratch an easy often for 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.000
 it is used crossfader 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:40.730
 and sometimes the faders in this video we will 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.070
 use only crossfader but before 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.930
 First, we do something sail into 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:48.260
 preferences orphan and open settings 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:51.260
 mixer switch the envelope crossfader 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:57.320
 with smooth to the fastest in general on that 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:59.239
 which is always the most right our goal 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:03.430
 achieve the loudest sound possible 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:03.430
 c with minimum crossfader movement 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:08.570
 if you go cross fader to the left and 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:11.450
 maximum volume is reached here 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:13.250
 and bring down to the thought of the track playing on the right 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:21.170
 shore if you take out a new track with 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:23.209
 left I will only slightly move the crossfader 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:27.890
 and the volume of the new track was already a hundred 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:29.959
 process now set up the envelope 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:32.000
 crossfader it is a controller and we will 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:35.570
 use it to scratch along with 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.280
 dog 1 street scratchy which i tell you 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:39.530
 show this baby scratch 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:42.140
 it's very simple and can do it 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:44.299
 each is why he is so called we 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:46.090
 no tick good to use in the very 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:49.250
 the beginning of the track or transition 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:54.079
 here is my barrel listen about 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:59.579
 collagen and lupine aida 

00:03:54.079 --> 00:04:01.939
 anti disk for use b disk speech 

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:04.590
 you need to turn the jock back and forth on 

00:04:01.939 --> 00:04:07.889
 getting a wake effect from aka who 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:10.439
 usually associated with hide and so 

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:15.989
 manipulates msi on some fans 

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:21.570
 somewhere 5 farin is now faster 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:24.289
 this baby scratch i'm doing evil on the barrel 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:26.610
 you can do it on a working drum 

00:04:24.289 --> 00:04:29.570
 or another loud sound 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.570
 try 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:39.229
 Savinykh is a retelling of this would have been without 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:44.349
 roofs next style transformer chance he 

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:46.939
 running with cross fader we load sam 

00:04:44.349 --> 00:04:47.990
 Transformers you cut out part of the sound 

00:04:46.939 --> 00:04:50.090
 crossfader 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:52.180
 here again it is important to set up 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:55.639
 fast fade cross fader 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:57.860
 And on my pass slapping sample 

00:04:55.639 --> 00:05:00.409
 now you need to play the sample and 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:02.479
 cut and share cross vader let's 

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:10.729
 try chanson 

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:12.020
 balance all his old and reproduce son 

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:13.939
 was using jogos 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:18.770
 let go of the jock and cut out the sound 

00:05:13.939 --> 00:05:20.539
 crossfader am she doesn't and further you can 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:22.490
 complicate it pour and 

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:33.249
 and manipulate simultaneously and 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:35.180
 a major crossfader try using 

00:05:33.249 --> 00:05:38.240
 Transformer can be made very 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:41.240
 interesting drawings the next kind of scratch 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:43.669
 hell we meet it was invented jazz 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:44.870
 jeff and so named because it looks like 

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:48.740
 bird chirping 

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:50.599
 this is a more difficult kind of scratch here 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:54.199
 you need to work crossfader and we 

00:05:50.599 --> 00:05:56.569
 friend must start at the same time with 

00:05:54.199 --> 00:05:59.110
 the very beginning sam planet itself 

00:05:56.569 --> 00:05:59.110
 pause to 

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:06.460
 start with the crossfader open 

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:08.380
 move the board you hear the deck which 

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:15.670
 plays and the crossfader is in 

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:17.770
 central position it simultaneously with 

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:20.440
 by the manipulation of the major you cut 

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:22.180
 crossfader sound in such a way that you have 

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:28.810
 very short sounds are obtained 

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:34.780
 cuts and touched meditation drive up 

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:37.120
 san and so are they to cyanide pheasant when you 

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:39.280
 twist the board in the opposite direction 

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:44.290
 the food opens the crossfader like this 

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:47.610
 way lead forward closes 

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:50.410
 crossfader and back open 

00:06:47.610 --> 00:07:03.340
 when you do it quickly it turns out 

00:06:50.410 --> 00:07:05.680
 let's not try cutting we 

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:10.120
 reviewed three species with screaming baby 

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:12.889
 thermo transformers let's see how 

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:38.240
 we can put them into practice 

00:07:12.889 --> 00:07:41.120
 and do not think 

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:42.680
 now you know how to mix hip hop it 

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:45.439
 can be done with a scratch 

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:50.449
 mixing or abrupt transition between 

00:07:45.439 --> 00:07:55.300
 tracks now it's time to practice 

00:07:50.449 --> 00:07:55.300
 stretched turned aven diabetes
