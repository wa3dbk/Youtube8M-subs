00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:15.019
 Good day, dear viewer 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:18.010
 today's hero of our review will be 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:20.660
 american heavy tank 8 level t32 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:22.580
 t32 is experimental heavy 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:25.310
 tank designed using 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:27.500
 units and units of the serial tank m26 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.570
 pershing experimental t29 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.940
 According to the results of the fighting in Europe in the headquarters 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.920
 The US Army concluded that 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:36.470
 armament of the serial tank m26 pershing 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.800
 quite enough but the armor did not give 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:40.880
 seriously protecting against barrel length 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.100
 88mm German tank and 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.480
 anti-aircraft guns 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.820
 therefore it was decided to create on the base already 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:49.010
 well mastered in the production of m26 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.200
 new tank with enhanced armor 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.360
 engine and transmission taken from another 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:55.550
 experimental tank t-29 on the chassis 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.500
 from Pershing extending it to one support 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.149
 rink 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:01.370
 however this tank did not have time 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:03.649
 the end of the war and therefore did not go to the series 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.899
 giving way to more thoughtful cars 

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:07.310
 nevertheless many of the used 

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:09.639
 after constructive decisions 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:12.619
 it was precisely t32 that were worked out 

00:01:09.639 --> 00:01:14.899
 back to the gaming realities heavy tank 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:16.490
 t32 is on the eighth level of the branch 

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:19.189
 development of heavy tanks connected 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.090
 states is investigated from a tank with t29 for a hundred 

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:22.939
 thousand experience 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.799
 bringing previous t32 tango such 

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:26.869
 status on stock tank you get 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:29.299
 masthead masthead top gun 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:31.399
 you only need to explore the radio 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:33.020
 only the chassis and the tower first thing 

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:34.969
 open the chassis and since without it 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.819
 can be installed top weapon 

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:40.279
 accumulate 14,500 free experiences and 

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:42.529
 open the chassis immediately setting together with 

00:01:40.279 --> 00:01:43.939
 her top gun was being examined 

00:01:42.529 --> 00:01:45.829
 the tower which in all respects 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:48.590
 superior to its predecessor and 

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:51.439
 finally buy 106 from 8500 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:54.349
 experience on the study m103 two modules 

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:58.639
 the next tank will cost you 200 4400 

00:01:54.349 --> 00:02:00.560
 experience tool t32 familiar to us another 129 all 

00:01:58.639 --> 00:02:02.110
 also 105 millimeters cannon which 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.820
 has 198 punch 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:08.380
 320 damage per shot scatter 0.41 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:11.170
 units of time information for tomorrow 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.730
 tenths of a second in general seems to be 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.250
 at an average comfort level 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.590
 getting into fights below lists and that and 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.640
 you will spend the gold subcaliber so 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.770
 how do you spend at a hundred and ninety eight 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.980
 millimeters at the eighth level already anyone 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:25.540
 not surprised scatter 0.41 will 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.370
 force you from time to time to measure 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:31.630
 miss nights with full 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:34.690
 Details dpm tank will be 1800 11.2 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:36.880
 damage points typical for American 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:39.520
 ttc heavy tank reservation 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.200
 2 we have the best armor tower among 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:44.230
 heavy tanks on your level 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:47.200
 but weak body booking la tower 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:49.030
 has a thicker tue 298 millimeters in its 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.760
 time tests have proven that even 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.980
 steel cumulative shells from 268 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.260
 an object with a penetration of 450 millimeters 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.989
 Americans did not always break through the mask 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.670
 mention classmates 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:01.840
 weak point in the tower to 32 is 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.110
 commander's cupola 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:07.360
 its thickness will be 152 millimeters 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:09.280
 body protected images and worse upper 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.450
 bronelist are located approximately under 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.860
 angle of 50 degrees 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.110
 having a thickness of one hundred and twenty seven 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:16.060
 millimeters has equivalent armor 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:18.549
 approximately 100,700,180 millimeters 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.950
 under the tower continuation of the top 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:23.049
 armor plate which is located under the wild 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.910
 angle can withstand very many 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:27.820
 enemy projectile hits will be 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:29.170
 just ricochet over the high angle t32 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:30.570
 can't boast high 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:32.530
 dynamic indicators 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:34.390
 800 horsepower engine installed 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:37.690
 forces on the tank mass fifty seven s 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:40.209
 half tons t32 possessing 13 wholes 9 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:42.670
 10 horsepower per ton weight not 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:45.340
 impressive isn't it maximally for us 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:47.920
 speed of 35 meters an hour ahead and 14 back 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:50.620
 25 degrees per second 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:53.350
 t32 is the very happy eyes 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:55.480
 so much the best reviews at their level 400 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:57.180
 meters such a review usually have 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.730
 tanks 9 tenths lesson 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.530
 the vertical corners of the guns minus 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:04.200
 10 plus 20 degrees down and up 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:06.890
 accordingly withstand t32 can 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:09.599
 maximum 1500 50 damage 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:11.849
 the tactics of the game on t32 depend on many 

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:14.549
 gaming environment where your tank and hit 

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:17.400
 This is what level of battle on which card 

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:19.079
 what tanks have the enemy agree 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.060
 such conditions dictate any tank 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:23.759
 idle style game on t32 in this 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:25.800
 case especially if you hit the map 

00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:28.410
 with differences in terrain if there is no battle 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:30.270
 enemy artillery then regardless 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:32.400
 from the level of the battle tank well its strong 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:34.470
 tower on the front as already 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:37.229
 discussed earlier the old cumulative from 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:38.310
 object 268 did not always pierce armor in 

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:41.150
 and the tower is American 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:43.259
 regular papers are sodibillary especially 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:46.830
 Of course that high-explosive tank 

00:04:43.259 --> 00:04:48.810
 shells of every kind e100 and fv215b 183 no 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:50.820
 sense because big bombs 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:53.610
 our calibers are guaranteed to apply 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:56.220
 damage getting to the top of the list on the card is not 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:58.740
 having terrain can play 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:00.810
 from the exchange of shots by itself with this 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:02.699
 better think with whom it is better to trade as 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:05.220
 can dilute the vargan falsely shot and 

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:07.320
 similar thoughts falling out 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:09.360
 list to map without terrain 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:11.610
 maximize work we have a team 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:13.080
 destroy tanks of their level to 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:14.760
 high on him and teammates not 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:16.979
 distracted in the tank below and 

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:20.159
 shot because they need to shoot 

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:21.530
 for thirst for damage, forget t32 tank not 

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:23.610
 I will sell the account at the bottom of the list 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:25.470
 comments on the tactics of the game on 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:27.090
 who is 32 at the bottom of the list does not seem to 

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:28.340
 terrain drops under this video 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:30.479
 welcome 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:31.160
 locations and the filling consists of six 

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:32.990
 tankman 

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:35.210
 commander mehvod gunner radio operators pair 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:37.010
 charging approach to choosing perks for 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:39.110
 crew consists of your personal 

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:41.420
 preferences, I will only announce the list of perks 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:42.710
 which in my opinion the most 

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:44.930
 suitable for t32 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:46.910
 first perk in the team develops in itself 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:49.160
 the sixth sense began to study the ability 

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:50.840
 fast repair to him tank second thing 

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:52.280
 consider perks which is the best 

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:54.710
 stabilization of the instrument when moving and 

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:56.690
 turning the tower commander up teaches repair in 

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:58.400
 the gunners move u against stabilization 

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:00.560
 Radioman radio intercept and examine 

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:03.770
 loading contactless ammo pack 

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:05.720
 and 2 perks to choose equipment 

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:07.490
 the choice of equipment depends on your 

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:09.800
 personal playing style but I urge you 

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:12.050
 I recommend using the following modules 

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:13.790
 enlightened optics rammer and 

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:16.010
 vertical alignment stabilizer 

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:17.810
 optics improve our best review on 

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:19.550
 level 440 meters 

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:21.440
 that will allow you to see very, very 

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:23.200
 far away and have a huge 

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:25.880
 first shot advantage 

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:27.680
 rammer improve sluggish dpm rate 

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:29.300
 and the stabilizer will reduce the initial 

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:32.990
 information and also reduce scatter 

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:36.200
 guns in motion this turn of the tower on 

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:38.120
 this review of the tank t32 came to an end i 

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:39.950
 I sincerely hope that this guide helped 

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:42.560
 you decide on the style of playing the tank 

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:44.450
 and also better understand his best 

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:46.160
 thank your hand put 

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:47.120
 Like and subscribe to the channel I will 

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:49.880
 very nice 

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:50.390
 and thank you for watching you 

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:53.530
 Michael 

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:53.530
 see you at random
