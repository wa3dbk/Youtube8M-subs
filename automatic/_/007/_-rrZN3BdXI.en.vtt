00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.030
 hello guys with you to the river today 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:10.900
 show you so weird mod 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:13.389
 which adds 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:15.790
 very unusual things i don't know what was 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:18.040
 in the head of the author of this mod but he 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:20.230
 still made such a mod first mod 

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:22.480
 adds several new types of inhabitants 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:24.790
 but this view you have already seen at the beginning of it 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:27.190
 a resident pig also has a resident 

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:28.900
 the cow also has a resident ender with 

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:30.760
 which unfortunately can not bargain 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:33.220
 he will just teleport away from you 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:35.200
 and will not let you come to him at all here 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:37.450
 there are a lot of strange things here and 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.610
 residents in the form of spiders and residents in the form 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:41.710
 chickens damn the author in my opinion that something is not 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:43.570
 so with the head but it's not all I'm 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.579
 only residents showed you in the game 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.380
 there are so many different things and 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:49.900
 even till chicken across apparently 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:51.940
 will carry emeralds but what he 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:54.940
 made with pigs it is in my very 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:58.300
 terrible here is this before you pig rabbit 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:00.460
 this is infinitely rotating pig why 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.380
 she even needs another miracle here 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:05.979
 natures added by this mod it 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:08.260
 some just awful i'm a pig i'm not 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:10.510
 I know how to describe it even here, we just 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:12.670
 flying pig she sometimes of course 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:14.920
 runs on the ground but nothing unusual 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:17.229
 think pigs always flew and this 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.720
 just a flower pig I don't know why 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:21.310
 resident pig and and we drink with pigs 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.350
 finished now let's go 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.540
 the chickens here have such here 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.490
 huge flying chicken in his 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:31.330
 for some reason the wings are very strange rotate 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:33.490
 it's a cow and a chicken at the same time i don't 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.799
 I know why she is needed here so it is with us 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.990
 just fat chicken nothing out of the ordinary 

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:40.330
 such if you fatten up a lot 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.500
 are we just chicken endermen too 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.750
 nothing unusual 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:46.390
 and here it is something very cool this 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:48.189
 creeper and and chicken at the same time but what 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.830
 this is nonsense and why is she here 

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:54.220
 generally need I do not understand and totally free 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:56.860
 waist some colored big-eyed cube i 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.780
 I do not know why it is necessary damn this mod 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.909
 so strange that I don't even know 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.850
 how to describe it here is just a lot 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:06.759
 strange objects and animals let's 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:09.639
 probably we will move from animal block 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:11.529
 and the first thing I found is a mega tent block 

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:12.650
 let's blow it up and have this 

00:02:11.529 --> 00:02:14.659
 here is a big square on 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.939
 boat with little diverging in 

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:20.900
 side lines let's ka blow yet 

00:02:16.939 --> 00:02:22.519
 one to about the same is me 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.769
 reminded mod that I already somehow 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:26.780
 surveyed if you remember what it was for 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:28.819
 review mods then write in the comments 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.069
 funny but with this mod it will be possible 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:34.040
 make yourself armor tools out of the ground 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:36.829
 so what's that chicken this chicken for 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:39.470
 my game of grosse mouth and why is she 

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:41.269
 here we need to actually aha if we 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.760
 right click on any 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:45.349
 block, the block is struck by lightning 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.200
 let's kill somebody like that 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:51.799
 way so here i already found a target for 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:54.590
 kills in right click and lamb 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:56.690
 burns away from lightning is great what I wanted 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.639
 let's try to destroy so 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:02.780
 in the way this here is a strange garbage she to me 

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:05.269
 very much not like that why she 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.590
 turned eggman that the authors of this 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:09.859
 fashion is wrong with the head 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:12.170
 have to kill their land sword damn 

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:13.519
 in fact it is very very strange 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.290
 mod there even have a few 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:18.169
 types of blocks this here for example 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:20.510
 chicken grass is the usual chicken ground 

00:03:18.169 --> 00:03:22.129
 have you ever seen this with us 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.620
 ore from which you can mine 

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:26.629
 cookies are generally nothing unusual and 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:29.239
 here is such a flickering block which 

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:31.760
 You can also mine this ore here. 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:33.590
 for some reason, there are rubies and a ruby ​​block but 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.389
 apparently for a variety of interiors 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:38.540
 from afar, I would also think that this 

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:40.430
 Not someone's liver is iron ore, but near 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:42.620
 it certainly looks different 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:46.940
 I'll try to pick a land pick myself 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:49.010
 cookie loop that's how much is great in 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:50.840
 Generally guys this mod is very unusual 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:53.299
 very weird so install 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.280
 it must be yourself surprised at everything 

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:57.379
 to what is here because I tell you 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.909
 showed only a small part of this mod 

00:03:57.379 --> 00:04:01.310
 be sure to write in the comments that 

00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:03.260
 yet you find strange in this fashion and of 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:05.180
 of course like this video and 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:09.400
 share it with friends thanks for all 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:09.400
