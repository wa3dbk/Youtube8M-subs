00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:14.950 
show you I updated the perimeter and a

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:17.880 
show you I updated the perimeter and a
block<00:00:15.130> for<00:00:15.340> Minecraft<00:00:15.700> 1.9<00:00:16.180> point<00:00:16.449> one<00:00:16.660> and<00:00:16.890> so

block for Minecraft 1.9 point one and so

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:19.679 
block for Minecraft 1.9 point one and so
here<00:00:18.339> is<00:00:18.429> the<00:00:18.579> command<00:00:18.909> you<00:00:19.089> will<00:00:19.210> find<00:00:19.449> it<00:00:19.570> in

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:19.689 
here is the command you will find it in

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:21.419 
here is the command you will find it in
the<00:00:19.749> description<00:00:20.079> is<00:00:20.380> it's<00:00:20.589> a<00:00:20.769> single<00:00:21.099> command

00:00:21.419 --> 00:00:21.429 
the description is it's a single command

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:23.009 
the description is it's a single command
you<00:00:21.669> can<00:00:21.820> execute<00:00:22.150> with<00:00:22.480> the<00:00:22.539> command<00:00:22.810> look

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:23.019 
you can execute with the command look

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:25.890 
you can execute with the command look
and<00:00:23.409> now<00:00:23.980> if<00:00:24.189> he<00:00:24.220> actually<00:00:24.699> yeah<00:00:25.449> place<00:00:25.779> the

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:25.900 
and now if he actually yeah place the

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.290 
and now if he actually yeah place the
command<00:00:26.169> block<00:00:26.489> magic<00:00:27.489> what<00:00:27.609> happen<00:00:27.880> it<00:00:28.089> says

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:28.300 
command block magic what happen it says

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.249 
command block magic what happen it says
warning<00:00:28.569> clearings

00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:29.259 
warning clearings

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:31.139 
warning clearings
the<00:00:29.529> big<00:00:29.769> perimeter<00:00:30.279> this<00:00:30.669> might<00:00:30.880> take

00:00:31.139 --> 00:00:31.149 
the big perimeter this might take

00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:32.519 
the big perimeter this might take
several<00:00:31.329> minutes<00:00:31.659> and<00:00:31.960> disconnect<00:00:32.439> you

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:32.529 
several minutes and disconnect you

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:36.299 
several minutes and disconnect you
temporarily<00:00:33.040> and<00:00:33.629> yep<00:00:34.629> so<00:00:35.140> it's<00:00:35.649> probably

00:00:36.299 --> 00:00:36.309 
temporarily and yep so it's probably

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:37.590 
temporarily and yep so it's probably
going<00:00:36.460> to<00:00:36.579> take<00:00:36.640> about<00:00:36.879> three<00:00:37.180> minutes<00:00:37.210> on

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:37.600 
going to take about three minutes on

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.389 
going to take about three minutes on
this<00:00:37.750> machine<00:00:37.930> here<00:00:38.079> if<00:00:38.469> depending<00:00:38.890> on<00:00:39.160> your

00:00:39.389 --> 00:00:39.399 
this machine here if depending on your

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:41.400 
this machine here if depending on your
PC<00:00:39.760> it's<00:00:39.910> gonna<00:00:40.239> be<00:00:40.390> longer<00:00:40.750> or<00:00:40.960> shorter<00:00:40.989> but

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:41.410 
PC it's gonna be longer or shorter but

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:43.200 
PC it's gonna be longer or shorter but
you<00:00:41.500> can<00:00:41.649> see<00:00:41.829> stuff<00:00:42.460> is<00:00:42.640> happening<00:00:43.000> in<00:00:43.120> the

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:43.210 
you can see stuff is happening in the

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:46.709 
you can see stuff is happening in the
console<00:00:43.570> and<00:00:44.699> once<00:00:45.699> this<00:00:45.910> is<00:00:46.090> done<00:00:46.239> I'm<00:00:46.510> gonna

console and once this is done I'm gonna

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:48.720 
console and once this is done I'm gonna
speed<00:00:46.989> it<00:00:47.019> up<00:00:47.199> you<00:00:47.589> can<00:00:47.859> see<00:00:48.190> how<00:00:48.399> it<00:00:48.519> looks

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:48.730 
speed it up you can see how it looks

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 
is working basically it's come on blocks

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:00.490 
is working basically it's come on blocks
are<00:01:57.679> filling<00:01:58.009> in<00:01:58.689> squares<00:01:59.689> and<00:01:59.989> it's<00:02:00.289> four

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
are filling in squares and it's four

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:01.839 
are filling in squares and it's four
different<00:02:00.619> ones<00:02:00.920> so<00:02:01.069> I<00:02:01.250> need<00:02:01.459> a<00:02:01.489> different

00:02:01.839 --> 00:02:01.849 
different ones so I need a different

00:02:01.849 --> 00:02:03.969 
different ones so I need a different
color<00:02:02.060> yeah<00:02:02.329> let's<00:02:02.599> thank<00:02:03.170> you<00:02:03.289> use<00:02:03.409> any<00:02:03.709> other

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
color yeah let's thank you use any other

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:06.309 
color yeah let's thank you use any other
blocks<00:02:04.310> so<00:02:04.969> I'm<00:02:05.239> just<00:02:05.450> marking<00:02:05.599> all<00:02:05.869> basically

00:02:06.309 --> 00:02:06.319 
blocks so I'm just marking all basically

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:10.140 
blocks so I'm just marking all basically
the<00:02:06.530> zones<00:02:06.770> they<00:02:07.069> are<00:02:07.219> filling<00:02:07.520> in<00:02:07.640> so<00:02:08.569> I<00:02:08.989> just

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:10.150 
the zones they are filling in so I just

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:12.430 
the zones they are filling in so I just
imagine<00:02:11.150> that<00:02:11.180> these<00:02:11.690> this<00:02:12.049> zone<00:02:12.319> is

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
imagine that these this zone is

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.710 
imagine that these this zone is
continued<00:02:12.859> over<00:02:13.160> here<00:02:13.430> then<00:02:14.030> this<00:02:14.299> one<00:02:14.510> is

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
continued over here then this one is

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.599 
continued over here then this one is
continued<00:02:15.530> over<00:02:15.769> here<00:02:15.950> to<00:02:16.069> the<00:02:16.160> very<00:02:16.250> edge<00:02:17.030> and

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:18.609 
continued over here to the very edge and

00:02:18.609 --> 00:02:26.400 
continued over here to the very edge and
then<00:02:19.609> there<00:02:19.879> is<00:02:20.079> another<00:02:21.079> one<00:02:21.290> right<00:02:21.530> here

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.460 

like<00:02:27.410> this<00:02:27.650> and<00:02:28.150> the<00:02:29.150> last<00:02:29.299> so<00:02:29.780> this<00:02:30.170> is<00:02:30.319> all

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
like this and the last so this is all

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:31.839 
like this and the last so this is all
squares<00:02:30.739> I'm<00:02:30.889> just<00:02:31.099> marking<00:02:31.280> out<00:02:31.549> very

00:02:31.839 --> 00:02:31.849 
squares I'm just marking out very

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:36.099 
squares I'm just marking out very
basically<00:02:32.560> extend<00:02:33.560> to<00:02:34.510> like<00:02:35.510> over<00:02:35.750> here<00:02:35.930> and

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:36.109 
basically extend to like over here and

00:02:36.109 --> 00:02:40.750 
basically extend to like over here and
this<00:02:36.230> is<00:02:37.090> even<00:02:38.090> yet<00:02:38.419> so<00:02:38.739> you<00:02:39.739> can<00:02:39.919> see<00:02:40.130> those

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
this is even yet so you can see those

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.449 
this is even yet so you can see those
four<00:02:41.120> squares<00:02:41.510> leave<00:02:41.870> out<00:02:42.079> this<00:02:42.380> tiny<00:02:43.099> square

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
four squares leave out this tiny square

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:46.240 
four squares leave out this tiny square
in<00:02:43.519> the<00:02:43.609> middle<00:02:43.639> which<00:02:44.299> I<00:02:44.480> am<00:02:44.690> manually<00:02:45.650> later

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
in the middle which I am manually later

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:47.740 
in the middle which I am manually later
on<00:02:46.519> removing<00:02:46.940> the<00:02:46.970> bottom<00:02:47.150> into<00:02:47.450> taught<00:02:47.630> me

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
on removing the bottom into taught me

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:48.789 
on removing the bottom into taught me
just<00:02:47.959> leaving<00:02:48.260> this<00:02:48.380> three<00:02:48.590> or<00:02:48.680> three

platform for you to start building which
is<00:02:50.720> nice<00:02:51.049> compared<00:02:51.829> to<00:02:51.919> the<00:02:52.010> previous<00:02:52.370> version
