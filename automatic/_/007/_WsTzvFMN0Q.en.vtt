00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:13.340
 U 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:13.340
 Can I really be honest before love? 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:23.820
 What is the most important thing to protect your beloved society ? 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:26.100
 Of caring cherish your opponent is also important to have fun and enjoy time together 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:30.780
 Ability is also important. 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:34.860
 But it's an excuse for people to think more important than anything else. 

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:39.239
 Often trust is the foundation of love. 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:43.379
 In order to trust each other, you first have to tell them 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:48.120
 To be honest is not hiding, not cheating. 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:52.470
 You can hide behind the scenes, meet others, 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:57.059
 It would be difficult to say love while lying . 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:01:00.870
 But lovers should be honest with each other if they really love them. 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:05.940
 It 's a lie without a baby to lead the mood. 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:10.680
 Everyone will do everything in a little bit . The problem is not such a small lie. 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:12.210
 Without knowing ourselves, maybe even lying to oneself, 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.880
 Live 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:19.829
 I used to have these ad texts. 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:22.289
 When men start to reveal themselves, not more than five minutes 

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:27.869
 Women will be disappointed 

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:32.250
 How could all the women be disappointed because of the man's inner heart ? 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:34.109
 In our society we have to work if we are men, 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:38.369
 There is stereotype. 

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:42.329
 For example, a man must be strong, 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:47.490
 You should not be fooling yourself and be responsible for your words. 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:51.719
 In varying degrees, but men prefer women who are this man 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:57.149
 Men also try to make themselves like this. 

00:01:51.719 --> 00:02:01.530
 Especially in front of your loved ones, I try to show you a more manly appearance. 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:03.090
 However , the fact that such a way 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:07.710
 It is not 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:12.150
 There are children who have not grown up inside many men. 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:17.880
 I have a little child who wants to be afraid, shaken, and dependent. 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:20.100
 But if you reveal this child, you will be disappointed, 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:25.500
 Write and meet the opponent 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:30.960
 It's the same for a woman. She's cute and lovable. She sticks to her thoughts. 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:32.790
 I have to write a mask that says I am a dependent- minded person. 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:38.010
 Men like it. 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:42.090
 Meet the original opponent, even if their role is at all and women 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:47.430
 I live in a mask to enhance the model 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:48.870
 Sometimes I feel frustrated, but I can not get off my lecture 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:52.920
 In fear of not knowing 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:57.660
 I think I am a self- made figure in a mask. 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:03:00.900
 Only after the relationship has been firmly established , 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:06.030
 But the result is not happy. 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:07.740
 A woman is a man and a man is disappointed in a woman who does not accept her 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:11.580
 It moves away 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:15.060
 So we deceive each other with love 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:20.190
 Not only deceive each other but also oneself. 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:24.000
 I am afraid to be afraid. I may have to go out to meet each other while wearing a mask. 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:29.460
 When the time comes, I will take off with love. 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:34.500
 Of course it is. It's a challenge. We need a relationship that can be more frank . 

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:39.660
 4 Who can love me even if I put out what I am 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:40.950
 Even if I can see the weakness of what I am, I am the one who can love. 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:44.820
 can 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:50.130
 And you can be very comfortable in a true relationship. 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:55.290
 Hard to write a good relationship with the hard mask does not require energy to remain 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:57.300
 Energy can be used to love each other deeper and deeper. 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:01.860
 I have it. 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:06.600
 How much of a sincere relationship do we have in our world anyway 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:12.030
 Do not be stressed to keep hypocrisy even if you least love it. 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:15.230
 You must be able to see the real me Only when it is love then salvation 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:15.230
 I will be able to say
