00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
and the ending song it's not like I'm

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.959 
and the ending song it's not like I'm
going<00:00:55.110> to<00:00:55.199> listen<00:00:55.440> to<00:00:55.649> this<00:00:55.890> song<00:00:56.190> like<00:00:56.460> when<00:00:56.940> I

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
going to listen to this song like when I

going to listen to this song like when I
want<00:00:57.300> to<00:00:57.390> but<00:00:57.840> then<00:00:58.289> again<00:00:58.440> it's<00:00:58.920> perfect<00:00:59.399> for

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
want to but then again it's perfect for

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.760 
want to but then again it's perfect for
the<00:00:59.640> series<00:01:00.059> I<00:01:00.239> just<00:01:00.480> think<00:01:00.719> it's<00:01:00.899> it's<00:01:01.260> really

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
the series I just think it's it's really

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:02.930 
the series I just think it's it's really
over<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.070> top<00:01:02.219> as<00:01:02.399> well<00:01:02.430> it's<00:01:02.730> very

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
over the top as well it's very

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.020 
over the top as well it's very
hyperactive<00:01:03.449> very<00:01:04.019> fast<00:01:04.409> and<00:01:04.979> I<00:01:05.460> do<00:01:05.519> like<00:01:06.000> that

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
hyperactive very fast and I do like that

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.870 
hyperactive very fast and I do like that
when<00:01:06.479> that<00:01:06.630> really<00:01:07.229> suits<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.740> series<00:01:08.159> like

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
when that really suits the series like

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.840 
when that really suits the series like
this<00:01:09.180> one<00:01:09.479> talking<00:01:09.990> about<00:01:10.200> over-the-top<00:01:11.040> I<00:01:11.340> do
