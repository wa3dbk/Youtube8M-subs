00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:06.420
Hello, Fran.

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:09.800
This is the last week I'll be away from you.

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.679
I had lunch with my dad.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.360
This is also the last time I'll see him during this trip.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.300
And this will be the last time I'll have lunch with the guys...

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:25.960
With Feña, Ale, Sue, Lore...

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.900
We had some afternoon tea, we laughed.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.520
It was fun.

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.720
I also had a lunch with Seba Milla.

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.360
We talked about how is he...

00:00:50.982 --> 00:00:52.982
How is the whole freelance thing going...

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.180
And how does one manages to keep floating in Santiago.

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.780
We had some great Thai food and I also met his dog!

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:05.120
Her name is Leica, like the camera.

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.480
She's great. She has short legs and plays non-stop.

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.060
And bites a green plush bone.

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.360
That week I stayed some nights at Felipe and Sebastian's place.

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.049
Matías came to see me, too.

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.020
We talked, had fun.

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.060
I also had one last meeting with my sister, and my mom came all the way from Chiloé, to see me.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.780
And for the next days I stayed at Lore's house.

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.500
She sent her regards, obviously.

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:47.380
And I had a last night with Felipe and with Martin, who moved to Santiago from Chiloé.

00:01:48.396 --> 00:01:50.396
And we had the last gig.

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.880
We sold the last shirts.

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:55.480
And the CDs...

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.500
And Flo came from Argentina to sold the last merch from the tour.

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:06.230
I was a great last show.

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.660
I'm gonna miss that.

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:15.780
We finished playing, I grabbed my stuff, got myself ready and rushed to the airport...

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.560
There's nothing more boring than waiting on airports.

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.880
I arrived very early in the morning, so everyone was sleeping.

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.340
To I grabbed my ticket, and moved on.

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.200
And so the travel began.

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.560
Get on the airplane. Get to Panama's airport.

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.740
Wait in Panamá, then travel to Amsterdam.

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:46.220
And from Amsterdam, the promise to go back to Berlin... but that's ok.

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.780
...we'll see each other. And that's a good thing.

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.660
The sunset followed me, and then I was sitting by the window.

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.980
And it was like... looking at the sea.

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:09.580
The feeling of beholding something so immense it doesn't fit inside you. You can only watch it.

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.020
And watch the airplane lifting off...

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:14.893
And landing...

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.440
And lifting off...

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:17.640
And landing...

00:03:18.584 --> 00:03:20.584
In the seat in front of me...

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:26.480
There was a couple that seemed chinese, and they had an iPad and were watching some pictures...

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.180
all the pictures from their trip.

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:37.140
And there were pictures of flowers, people smiling, grandmothers, people I don't know and I'll never meet...

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.220
And I couldn't help but thinking it was just like this video...

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:49.280
Memories that belong to one person, or a couple, or a very reduced group of people...

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:54.220
and these memories are so small, so very particular, that they become some kind of universal memory.

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.780
And back to the plane.

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.657
And back to crossing the clouds.

00:03:59.657 --> 00:04:01.608
And back to the air turbulence.

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:08.540
And 30 hours lifting off and lading, again.

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:13.580
Everything takes so long.

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:22.720
It's a long process to give closure to a travel to where you thought it was your home, but it's not, anymore.

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.600
Even if were you are is not your home, either.

00:04:28.146 --> 00:04:30.146
It's your home, for now.

00:04:30.153 --> 00:04:32.153
Because it's my home, for now, too.

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:34.910
It's our home.

00:04:48.178 --> 00:04:50.178
So... when are you going to upload the video?

00:04:51.187 --> 00:04:53.187
Soon. I mean, I have to...

00:04:54.079 --> 00:04:56.279
fix the audio and it's done. Why?

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.580
Because the people already know we are together.

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.240
Doesn't matter. No one will notice.
