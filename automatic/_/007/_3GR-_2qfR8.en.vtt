that<00:03:04.650> and<00:03:04.859> slanted<00:03:05.639> went<00:03:05.879> on<00:03:06.060> that<00:03:06.359> side<00:03:06.680> these

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
that and slanted went on that side these

do come off but I'm not going to take
them<00:03:09.840> off<00:03:09.989> obviously<00:03:10.680> because<00:03:10.859> it's<00:03:11.129> meant<00:03:11.370> to

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
them off obviously because it's meant to

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:15.050 
them off obviously because it's meant to
be<00:03:11.519> an<00:03:11.669> armored<00:03:12.470> helicopter<00:03:13.470> and<00:03:13.739> he<00:03:14.669> gets<00:03:14.909> out

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
be an armored helicopter and he gets out

be an armored helicopter and he gets out
the<00:03:15.180> front<00:03:15.889> so<00:03:16.889> um<00:03:18.650> same<00:03:19.650> on<00:03:19.950> this<00:03:20.400> side<00:03:20.459> it's

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
the front so um same on this side it's

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.369 
the front so um same on this side it's
identical<00:03:22.760> on<00:03:23.760> both<00:03:23.819> sides<00:03:24.269> and<00:03:24.569> then<00:03:25.109> on<00:03:25.290> the

00:03:25.369 --> 00:03:25.379 
identical on both sides and then on the

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:29.330 
identical on both sides and then on the
top<00:03:25.530> we<00:03:25.739> have<00:03:25.769> the<00:03:25.889> rotors<00:03:26.459> that<00:03:27.449> spin<00:03:28.340> really

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
top we have the rotors that spin really

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.879 
top we have the rotors that spin really
nicely<00:03:29.669> and<00:03:30.090> you<00:03:30.120> can<00:03:31.049> pick<00:03:31.260> it<00:03:31.409> up<00:03:31.500> and<00:03:31.739> it

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:31.889 
nicely and you can pick it up and it

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:35.000 
nicely and you can pick it up and it
won't<00:03:32.010> fall<00:03:32.310> off<00:03:33.139> can<00:03:34.139> shake<00:03:34.379> it<00:03:34.530> and<00:03:34.650> off<00:03:34.799> it

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
won't fall off can shake it and off it

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.849 
won't fall off can shake it and off it
won't<00:03:35.250> fall<00:03:35.519> off<00:03:35.549> it's<00:03:36.389> just<00:03:36.720> I<00:03:37.199> don't<00:03:37.739> know

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:37.859 
won't fall off it's just I don't know

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:42.879 
won't fall off it's just I don't know
how<00:03:38.150> it<00:03:39.150> it's<00:03:39.810> just<00:03:40.049> really<00:03:40.440> stuck<00:03:40.829> on<00:03:41.040> there

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:42.889 
how it it's just really stuck on there

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:48.909 
how it it's just really stuck on there
so<00:03:43.889> and<00:03:44.159> then<00:03:44.760> the<00:03:44.940> back<00:03:45.120> here<00:03:45.479> we<00:03:46.109> have<00:03:46.319> the

00:03:55.059 --> 00:03:55.069 
have these tubes that connect into the

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:59.689 
have these tubes that connect into the
minigun<00:03:56.269> so<00:03:57.269> yep<00:03:57.659> i<00:03:57.949> would<00:03:58.949> put<00:03:59.190> brickarms

00:03:59.689 --> 00:03:59.699

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.430 
design um so you can hook it onto the

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:54.280 
design um so you can hook it onto the
back<00:04:46.610> here<00:04:46.910> and<00:04:49.510> like<00:04:50.510> this<00:04:51.820> and<00:04:52.820> it<00:04:53.240> will<00:04:53.420> come

back here and like this and it will come

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:59.530 
back here and like this and it will come
up<00:04:54.500> and<00:04:54.940> then<00:04:55.940> I<00:04:55.970> can<00:04:56.240> carry<00:04:56.570> this<00:04:58.300> like<00:04:59.300> that

00:04:59.530 --> 00:04:59.540 
up and then I can carry this like that

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:02.950 
up and then I can carry this like that
and<00:04:59.750> then<00:05:00.080> drop<00:05:00.470> it<00:05:00.500> off<00:05:00.830> in<00:05:01.510> a<00:05:02.510> location

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:02.960 
and then drop it off in a location

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:08.200 
and then drop it off in a location
somewhere<00:05:05.770> like<00:05:06.770> that<00:05:06.800> and<00:05:07.280> then<00:05:07.640> pick<00:05:08.000> off
