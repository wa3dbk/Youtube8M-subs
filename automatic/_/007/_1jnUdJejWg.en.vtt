00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:16.650
 as such two mortals three mortals 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.670
 this little one that I liked the circus 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:26.320
 I wanted to be a circus tamer and tamer 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:28.619
 face the stones put me 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:31.680
 in front of them with my whip my chair 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:34.630
 and dominate the team xavi is my nephew 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:38.320
 when I was little I was a great boy 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:40.989
 Smart and handsome is good but only 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.640
 had a defect the circus say by 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:45.539
 say how to invest you had to 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:48.219
 take it every day so I had a 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.410
 these suit of tamer who put it 

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:53.410
 in the morning I would put it in the afternoon 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:56.949
 I even slept with him but look 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:01:00.390
 where has he become a tamer and to be 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:00.390
 owner of his own circus 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:12.130
 flea up 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.920
 he is putting on a mask and denies 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.970
 that they have connected the heat is very 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.970
 high and you could stay 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:25.450
 with her ying wang mask we put her 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:25.450
 inside the canyon 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.940
 the highest 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:38.220
 basically the risks of fleas is a 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:40.140
 circus show where the tamer 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.360
 filled with much patience 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.190
 tame these tiny artists to 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.950
 to juggle acrobatics 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:49.320
 many numbers are the same as they did 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.270
 in previous centuries many have innovated 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.160
 but what are still the 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.530
 authentic protagonists of the circus are 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.960
 fleas or solidity and that if the 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.940
 we take and there are more than 200 species 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.280
 different from this delictual type are 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:05.370
 able to drag 160 times its weight 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.590
 they could jump 100 times their height and 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:11.040
 could perform about 600 before in a 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:14.190
 good time to train fleas inside 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:16.200
 of the two thousand varieties that I have the 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.270
 what I recommend is the public if rita cns 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.650
 which is the flea of ​​man over all 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.170
 the females because they are a little more 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.880
 lists once we get to us the 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.890
 fleas what we do is immediately 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.960
 place them inside matchboxes 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.990
 this is because the natural tendency of 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:32.130
 the flea is moving in jumps to 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:34.290
 Avoid this 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.060
 we closed them one season in the 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.590
 boxes then as they go 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.560
 hitting the head for trying 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.450
 escape they learn to walk once they have 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.900
 learned from walking is when we can 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:48.090
 start training those in a thousand ways by 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.980
 example we can do little tricks 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.830
 around your body and can pull 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:55.440
 wagons like this one from small that 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:58.650
 can do more by asking trinas 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.450
 which it is having repellent effect to 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.790
 fleas we apply in small doses 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.410
 about balls then when we approach 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.050
 these journalists with this effect 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.910
 repellent over the fleas these the 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:11.720
 they try to expel and pretend that they are 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.720
 hitting a ball 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:17.360
 if you have a test of three players 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.330
 what escalante 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:22.330
 To anybody 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.330
 delicious 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:34.629
 as you can see the gloves to work 

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:40.890
 to get to see 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.510
 there it is for the first criminal of 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:50.610
 Attention 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:50.610
 because the ball shoots the same 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.500
 there is no historical document that 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:04:00.500
 tell us when the circuses begin 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:02.360
 fleas are supposed to be on the 16th on the 17th 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.310
 representations were already made of those of 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:07.400
 the courts by jesters 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:09.379
 but it was not until 1833 when bertolotto 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:12.170
 who supposed he was the father of the 

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:13.700
 modern flea circus writes a 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:16.010
 book called the history of a flea 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:17.470
 which is the first document file 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:20.419
 historic that we have 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:22.880
 then it begins to spread through the USA and 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:26.000
 england and two types of circuses are born 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:28.630
 ones that contain real fleas and 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.400
 others that the coach has 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:32.800
 Mechanical or magnetic mechanisms for 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.510
 simulate that there are fleas 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.470
 thank you very much for coming 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:38.060
 surely we will continue thinking that 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:40.490
 you are nuts but at least you can 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:43.300
 say that you have seen a magic circus 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:43.300
 of fleas 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.840
 Y
