00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:09.450
 hi welcome to when they are i am kim 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.389
 and today i'll show you how 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:15.269
 test on a scaffolding wooden board 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.789
 I have this this board or this plank wall 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.050
 for the sides well torn 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.789
 so you don't have fun on the ships 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.560
 around its edges 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.390
 the top layer that of those I do not have 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.230
 to be torn I had a bit of it 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:30.960
 that weird corner and I have the letters there 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.430
 always laid down so that I know 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.540
 how much space or need it 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.739
 everything will fit 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.739
 because I have to have a big plate 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.450
 I myself have the template of the 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:45.300
 letters you order online 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.730
 so i was late huh and i love it 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.890
 yourself a very pleasant work but you can 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.590
 walk choose to make a computer your text 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.260
 tapping with print and then 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.770
 cut out the letters and then you 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:59.940
 paper when you start using plants 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.800
 since most where goes once 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.699
 use 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.699
 so I'm going to do this 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:19.270
 I put the attention I put exactly in the 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:23.560
 angle so that the distance is the same everywhere 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:27.490
 that gives a nice start i have one 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:30.850
 special brush for with a flat 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:32.890
 top so no point top so 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.550
 it will soon be so busy part-time 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.570
 the paint 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:36.570
 That is also easier 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:56.920
 not too far that we have one this 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:00.640
 letter 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:03.700
 do as long as something is over it 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:08.160
 you will sit closer together 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.160
 but the top would also be the same 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.550
 as you can see I have the first line now 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.630
 to go with the second line 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.450
 to start 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:27.820
 I start now backwards I laid my own 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.350
 pay attention at the end 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:30.850
 I put so more here 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:32.530
 I do this so it from here 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:34.720
 is the same 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:03:10.510
 and there and that line can continue like this 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:03:11.860
 immediately if you want something 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.020
 move 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.940
 Think then that you are not pressed 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:18.670
 move then you have the chance to paint 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:21.160
 a shift and then it is actually 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:24.330
 a little failed of course 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.330
 want image expression 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.620
 I continue with a sugar 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:36.510
 hereby i drop again as to the 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:38.610
 arched the edges that line the same 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.849
 both on the side and on the 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:40.849
 bottom 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:33.169
 comes with the package I ordered 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.169
 does not ban regions 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:38.210
 so I use one you from another 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:38.210
 template 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:40.850
 the hole of 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:55.990
 i'm ready i'm happy i'm leaving it 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.660
 dry for a while 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:00.520
 when dry will maybe 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:02.800
 spray a layer over such a species 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:05.110
 close the paint layer over it 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:07.450
 so that you also take one and the 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:09.910
 letters A do not go away immediately 

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:11.380
 bell will immediately rinse my brush 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:14.350
 it won't let it dry 

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:17.620
 because then you can almost throw away I wash 

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:19.330
 about planning to make something like that already 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:21.310
 don't just think so that would be a super 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:24.340
 like it and you don't go too 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:27.210
 subscribe to our youtube channel 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:27.210
