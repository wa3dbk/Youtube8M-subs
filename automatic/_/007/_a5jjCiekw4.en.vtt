00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
we're going to do the other side the

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.439 
we're going to do the other side the
same<00:00:51.660> way<00:00:51.840> just<00:00:52.260> reverse<00:00:52.890> your<00:00:53.879> curling<00:00:54.239> iron

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
position everything's going away from

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.150 
position everything's going away from
the<00:00:57.059> base<00:00:57.270> I<00:00:57.629> think<00:00:58.289> it's<00:00:58.410> easier<00:00:58.710> holding<00:00:59.039> the

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
the base I think it's easier holding the

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.380 
the base I think it's easier holding the
curling<00:00:59.430> iron<00:00:59.520> straight<00:00:59.910> up<00:01:00.030> and<00:01:00.180> down<00:01:00.239> and

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
curling iron straight up and down and

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.990 
curling iron straight up and down and
trying<00:01:00.989> to<00:01:01.109> do<00:01:01.230> it<00:01:01.350> sideways<00:01:01.800> so<00:01:02.640> that's<00:01:02.850> what

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
trying to do it sideways so that's what

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.640 
trying to do it sideways so that's what
i'm<00:01:03.090> doing<00:01:03.359> here<00:01:03.719> but<00:01:03.930> to<00:01:04.049> get<00:01:04.170> a<00:01:04.229> different

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
i'm doing here but to get a different

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.060 
i'm doing here but to get a different
effect<00:01:04.890> you<00:01:05.549> could<00:01:05.909> hold<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.390> curling<00:01:06.780> iron

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
effect you could hold the curling iron

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.010 
effect you could hold the curling iron
horizontal<00:01:08.070> so<00:01:08.729> this<00:01:08.880> next<00:01:09.240> section<00:01:09.390> is<00:01:09.780> about
