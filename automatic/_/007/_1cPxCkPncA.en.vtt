filters<00:00:09.990> in<00:00:10.260> a<00:00:10.290> 4<00:00:10.710> by<00:00:10.860> 4<00:00:10.889> or<00:00:11.519> mat<00:00:12.000> to<00:00:12.330> use<00:00:12.599> it<00:00:12.750> in

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
filters in a 4 by 4 or mat to use it in

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.770 
filters in a 4 by 4 or mat to use it in
with<00:00:13.080> in<00:00:13.200> a<00:00:13.259> matte<00:00:13.410> box<00:00:13.559> and<00:00:14.389> now<00:00:15.389> I<00:00:15.420> had<00:00:15.750> a

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
with in a matte box and now I had a

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.740 
with in a matte box and now I had a
little<00:00:15.990> problem<00:00:16.379> with<00:00:16.529> my<00:00:17.039> setup<00:00:17.609> itself<00:00:18.180> the

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
little problem with my setup itself the

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.859 
little problem with my setup itself the
problem<00:00:19.080> is<00:00:19.199> that<00:00:19.730> the<00:00:20.730> matte<00:00:21.000> box<00:00:21.210> and<00:00:21.510> the

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
problem is that the matte box and the

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.230 
problem is that the matte box and the
camera<00:00:22.199> aren't<00:00:22.680> raised<00:00:23.100> very<00:00:23.369> high<00:00:23.730> so

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
camera aren't raised very high so

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.089 
camera aren't raised very high so
they're<00:00:24.570> pretty<00:00:24.869> low<00:00:25.080> the<00:00:25.350> problem<00:00:25.740> is<00:00:25.890> now

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
they're pretty low the problem is now

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.980 
they're pretty low the problem is now
when<00:00:26.400> I<00:00:26.430> want<00:00:26.730> to<00:00:26.849> slide<00:00:27.119> the<00:00:27.330> filter<00:00:28.260> down<00:00:28.619> and

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:29.990 
when I want to slide the filter down and

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:32.720 
when I want to slide the filter down and
the<00:00:30.990> rails<00:00:31.230> are<00:00:31.470> in<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.769> way<00:00:31.890> as<00:00:32.189> you<00:00:32.369> can<00:00:32.520> see

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
the rails are in the way as you can see

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.479 
the rails are in the way as you can see
so<00:00:33.120> this<00:00:33.870> is<00:00:33.899> bad<00:00:34.500> because<00:00:34.829> if<00:00:35.190> you<00:00:35.309> have<00:00:35.460> a

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
so this is bad because if you have a

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.200 
so this is bad because if you have a
filter<00:00:35.940> like<00:00:36.180> this<00:00:36.210> one<00:00:36.600> you<00:00:37.320> could<00:00:37.590> um<00:00:38.210> come

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
filter like this one you could um come

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.260 
filter like this one you could um come
into<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:39.629> problem<00:00:40.050> that<00:00:40.260> you<00:00:40.710> don't<00:00:41.270> have

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
into the problem that you don't have

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.750 
into the problem that you don't have
enough<00:00:42.899> of<00:00:43.200> fading<00:00:43.739> so<00:00:44.040> then<00:00:44.219> I<00:00:44.430> thought<00:00:44.700> about

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
enough of fading so then I thought about

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.420 
enough of fading so then I thought about
it<00:00:45.030> some<00:00:45.300> methods<00:00:45.660> to<00:00:45.930> get<00:00:46.230> rid<00:00:47.160> of<00:00:47.190> this

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
it some methods to get rid of this

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.459 
it some methods to get rid of this
problem<00:00:47.670> and<00:00:48.180> I<00:00:48.420> came<00:00:48.629> up<00:00:48.660> with<00:00:48.809> this<00:00:49.200> little

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
problem and I came up with this little

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.510 
problem and I came up with this little
design<00:00:49.890> which<00:00:50.700> is<00:00:50.969> basically<00:00:51.480> an<00:00:52.320> own<00:00:52.980> filter

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
design which is basically an own filter

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.930 
design which is basically an own filter
holder<00:00:54.059> i<00:00:54.239> just<00:00:54.899> measured<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:56.190> width<00:00:56.460> of<00:00:56.640> the

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
holder i just measured the width of the

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.099 
holder i just measured the width of the
original<00:00:57.329> footer<00:00:57.539> older<00:00:57.930> then<00:00:58.350> cut<00:00:58.680> out<00:00:59.059> two

00:01:00.099 --> 00:01:00.109 
original footer older then cut out two

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:04.219 
original footer older then cut out two
of<00:01:01.109> these<00:01:01.379> shapes<00:01:01.739> from<00:01:02.609> cheap<00:01:03.480> PVC<00:01:03.899> like<00:01:04.080> in

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
of these shapes from cheap PVC like in

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.640 
of these shapes from cheap PVC like in
the<00:01:04.320> last<00:01:04.439> tutorial<00:01:04.860> and<00:01:05.960> you<00:01:06.960> have<00:01:07.110> these

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
the last tutorial and you have these

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.420 
the last tutorial and you have these
little<00:01:08.430> edges<00:01:09.270> here<00:01:09.600> these<00:01:09.869> corners<00:01:10.470> on<00:01:10.799> one

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
little edges here these corners on one

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.840 
little edges here these corners on one
side<00:01:11.729> this<00:01:11.939> is<00:01:12.119> important<00:01:12.689> so<00:01:13.500> um<00:01:13.890> filter

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
side this is important so um filter

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:20.060 
side this is important so um filter
cannot<00:01:16.369> fall<00:01:17.369> through<00:01:18.360> them<00:01:18.600> and<00:01:19.070> then

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
cannot fall through them and then

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.730 
cannot fall through them and then
there's<00:01:20.479> some<00:01:21.479> rubber<00:01:21.659> band<00:01:21.960> and<00:01:23.990> yeah<00:01:24.990> that's

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
there's some rubber band and yeah that's

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.920 
there's some rubber band and yeah that's
all<00:01:26.009> over<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.250> place<00:01:26.460> it's<00:01:26.970> just<00:01:27.240> stapled

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
all over the place it's just stapled

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.969 
all over the place it's just stapled
with<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.409> stapler<00:01:28.770> on<00:01:29.009> to<00:01:29.850> it<00:01:30.000> and<00:01:30.770> very<00:01:31.770> easy

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
with the stapler on to it and very easy

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.300 
with the stapler on to it and very easy
very<00:01:32.400> quick<00:01:32.820> to<00:01:33.360> make<00:01:33.390> so<00:01:34.259> now<00:01:34.350> I<00:01:34.560> just<00:01:34.619> can<00:01:35.070> app

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
very quick to make so now I just can app

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.969 
very quick to make so now I just can app
this<00:01:35.700> filter<00:01:36.119> holder<00:01:36.570> my<00:01:36.900> own<00:01:37.079> one<00:01:37.350> to<00:01:37.829> my

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
this filter holder my own one to my

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.550 
this filter holder my own one to my
matte<00:01:38.159> box<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:39.060> it<00:01:39.150> doesn't<00:01:39.630> look<00:01:39.689> or<00:01:40.079> fit<00:01:40.380> as

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
matte box and it doesn't look or fit as

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.230 
matte box and it doesn't look or fit as
good<00:01:40.829> as<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.130> original<00:01:41.159> one<00:01:41.670> but<00:01:41.700> it<00:01:41.970> works

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
good as the original one but it works

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.980 
good as the original one but it works
and<00:01:42.860> now<00:01:43.860> I<00:01:43.890> can<00:01:44.399> set<00:01:44.790> it<00:01:44.909> really<00:01:45.479> low<00:01:45.720> it's

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
and now I can set it really low it's

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.069 
and now I can set it really low it's
much<00:01:46.200> lower<00:01:46.470> than<00:01:46.619> before<00:01:47.189> and<00:01:48.079> yeah

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
much lower than before and yeah

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.929 
much lower than before and yeah
therefore<00:01:49.920> I<00:01:49.950> think<00:01:50.340> it's<00:01:50.460> a<00:01:50.549> really<00:01:50.579> cool

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
therefore I think it's a really cool

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.789 
therefore I think it's a really cool
solution<00:01:51.210> it's<00:01:51.570> quick<00:01:51.840> it's<00:01:52.020> easy<00:01:52.079> it's<00:01:52.470> cheap

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
solution it's quick it's easy it's cheap

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.420 
solution it's quick it's easy it's cheap
and<00:01:53.240> this<00:01:54.240> is<00:01:54.390> only<00:01:54.630> interesting<00:01:55.500> for<00:01:55.740> graded

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
and this is only interesting for graded

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.149 
and this is only interesting for graded
filters<00:01:56.850> so<00:01:57.299> no<00:01:57.750> need<00:01:57.899> for<00:01:58.200> different<00:01:58.890> filters

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
filters so no need for different filters

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.470 
filters so no need for different filters
