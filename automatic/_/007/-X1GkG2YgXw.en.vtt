talking about here and you mind ending
up<00:02:04.890> it<00:02:05.399> just<00:02:05.520> face<00:02:05.819> me<00:02:05.850> and<00:02:06.569> we're<00:02:07.259> just<00:02:07.350> going

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
up it just face me and we're just going

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.370 
up it just face me and we're just going
to<00:02:07.649> start<00:02:07.950> a<00:02:08.130> squat<00:02:08.670> now<00:02:09.330> so<00:02:09.690> start<00:02:09.959> to<00:02:10.080> squat

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
to start a squat now so start to squat

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.620 
to start a squat now so start to squat
down<00:02:10.410> we<00:02:11.099> notice<00:02:11.370> we<00:02:11.489> have<00:02:11.640> zero<00:02:12.030> motion<00:02:12.540> in

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
down we notice we have zero motion in

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.660 
down we notice we have zero motion in
the<00:02:12.750> lumbar<00:02:13.110> spine<00:02:13.140> until<00:02:13.890> we<00:02:14.010> hit<00:02:14.099> that<00:02:14.340> spot

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
the lumbar spine until we hit that spot

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:15.350 
the lumbar spine until we hit that spot
right<00:02:14.970> there

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
right there

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.530 
right there
if<00:02:15.599> you<00:02:16.019> descend<00:02:16.470> any<00:02:16.709> deeper<00:02:17.340> the<00:02:17.819> hip<00:02:18.299> tucks

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
if you descend any deeper the hip tucks

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.620 
if you descend any deeper the hip tucks
underneath<00:02:19.170> and<00:02:19.530> you<00:02:19.950> lose<00:02:20.370> the<00:02:20.790> natural<00:02:21.000> or

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
underneath and you lose the natural or

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.289 
underneath and you lose the natural or
Donna<00:02:21.840> curve<00:02:22.230> of<00:02:22.470> the<00:02:22.590> spine<00:02:22.860> so<00:02:23.190> here's<00:02:24.060> what

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:24.299 
Donna curve of the spine so here's what

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:27.640 
Donna curve of the spine so here's what
happens<00:02:24.840> when<00:02:24.930> you<00:02:25.140> lose<00:02:25.380> that<00:02:25.410> natural<00:02:26.250> curve

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
happens when you lose that natural curve

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.640 
happens when you lose that natural curve
the<00:02:28.650> spine<00:02:28.860> starts<00:02:29.610> to<00:02:29.849> flex<00:02:30.269> like<00:02:30.959> this<00:02:31.290> and

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
the spine starts to flex like this and

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.610 
the spine starts to flex like this and
you'll<00:02:32.010> see<00:02:32.370> that<00:02:32.700> little<00:02:33.030> disc<00:02:33.630> bulge<00:02:33.989> in<00:02:34.560> the

you'll see that little disc bulge in the

you'll see that little disc bulge in the

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
back as we flex and squeeze you'll see

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.420 
back as we flex and squeeze you'll see

you can squeeze as hard as you like and
