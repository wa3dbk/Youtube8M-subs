reaching up to that top string on the
fifth<00:01:20.050> fret<00:01:21.990> okay<00:01:24.000> so<00:01:25.000> the<00:01:25.180> way<00:01:25.300> this<00:01:25.479> starts

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 
fifth fret okay so the way this starts

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.070 
fifth fret okay so the way this starts
is<00:01:26.170> with<00:01:26.410> an<00:01:26.770> E<00:01:26.860> chord<00:01:26.890> and<00:01:27.310> use<00:01:27.820> your<00:01:28.119> index

middle ring fingers to play the E chord

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.870 
middle ring fingers to play the E chord
and<00:01:31.600> leave<00:01:32.320> your<00:01:32.530> little<00:01:32.920> finger<00:01:33.340> free<00:01:33.640> to

00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:37.899 
walk down that B string so the way this

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:50.430 
walk down that B string so the way this
goes<00:01:38.140> is<00:01:38.200> like<00:01:38.500> this<00:01:48.690> so<00:01:49.690> the<00:01:49.780> way<00:01:49.899> we<00:01:50.020> do<00:01:50.170> it<00:01:50.289> is

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:50.440 
goes is like this so the way we do it is

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:39.840 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:44.159 

use<00:05:40.840> this<00:05:41.020> middle<00:05:41.740> finger<00:05:42.690> to<00:05:43.690> just<00:05:43.900> go<00:05:44.020> and

00:05:44.159 --> 00:05:44.169 
use this middle finger to just go and

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:47.159 
use this middle finger to just go and
add<00:05:44.290> that<00:05:44.470> note<00:05:44.770> there<00:05:45.010> that's<00:05:45.400> the<00:05:45.840> D<00:05:46.840> string

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:47.169

on<00:05:47.260> the<00:05:47.380> fourth<00:05:47.650> fret<00:06:03.720> and<00:06:04.720> then<00:06:04.840> we<00:06:04.960> walk<00:06:05.260> down

00:06:06.379 --> 00:06:06.389 
on the fourth fret and then we walk down

00:06:06.389 --> 00:06:18.650 
on the fourth fret and then we walk down
the<00:06:07.389> bottom<00:06:07.750> E<00:06:07.870> string<00:06:08.229> on<00:06:08.470> the<00:06:08.590> fourth<00:06:08.860> fret

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:18.660 

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:22.140 

and<00:06:19.660> when<00:06:19.840> we<00:06:19.900> play<00:06:20.110> that<00:06:20.289> too<00:06:20.500> we<00:06:20.770> form<00:06:21.150> an

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:22.150 
and when we play that too we form an

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:28.469 
and when we play that too we form an
f-sharp<00:06:26.039> and<00:06:27.039> move<00:06:27.400> those<00:06:27.910> three<00:06:28.270> fingers

00:06:28.469 --> 00:06:28.479 
f-sharp and move those three fingers

00:06:28.479 --> 00:06:36.460 
f-sharp and move those three fingers
across<00:06:29.430> to<00:06:30.430> form<00:06:30.669> a<00:06:30.760> B<00:06:30.940> minor

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:36.470 

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:45.200 

I'm<00:06:37.470> an<00:06:37.740> and<00:06:37.889> I<00:06:43.400> use<00:06:44.400> this<00:06:44.520> little<00:06:44.580> thing<00:06:44.849> to

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:45.210 
I'm an and I use this little thing to

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:53.950 
I'm an and I use this little thing to
lift<00:06:45.449> off<00:06:45.659> that<00:06:45.930> second<00:06:46.729> string

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:53.960 

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:57.640 

and<00:06:54.530> then<00:06:54.650> what<00:06:54.800> I<00:06:54.830> do<00:06:54.980> I<00:06:55.400> then<00:06:55.730> just<00:06:56.440> stick<00:06:57.440> my

00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:57.650 
and then what I do I then just stick my

00:06:57.650 --> 00:06:59.530 
and then what I do I then just stick my
little<00:06:57.919> finger<00:06:58.280> up<00:06:58.550> on<00:06:58.700> that<00:06:58.820> fifth<00:06:59.120> fret<00:06:59.450> of

00:06:59.530 --> 00:06:59.540 
little finger up on that fifth fret of

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:01.510 
little finger up on that fifth fret of
the<00:06:59.570> top<00:06:59.630> string

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:01.520 
the top string

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:28.320 
the top string
so<00:07:02.240> putting<00:07:02.539> it<00:07:02.599> all<00:07:02.690> together<00:07:02.810> we've<00:07:03.199> got

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:28.330 

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:30.730 

and<00:07:29.330> then<00:07:29.479> what<00:07:29.659> you<00:07:29.780> do<00:07:29.900> you<00:07:30.139> going<00:07:30.379> go<00:07:30.530> back

00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:30.740 
and then what you do you going go back

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:36.610 
and then what you do you going go back
to<00:07:30.949> what<00:07:31.099> we<00:07:31.219> learned<00:07:31.250> in<00:07:31.520> part<00:07:31.729> one<00:07:35.620> which

00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:36.620 
to what we learned in part one which

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:39.010 
to what we learned in part one which
I'll<00:07:36.770> play<00:07:37.219> for<00:07:37.280> you<00:07:37.629> when<00:07:38.629> you've<00:07:38.750> got<00:07:38.900> that

00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:39.020 
I'll play for you when you've got that

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:40.929 
I'll play for you when you've got that
far<00:07:39.289> it's<00:07:39.560> time<00:07:39.710> to<00:07:39.830> move<00:07:40.009> on<00:07:40.129> to<00:07:40.310> part<00:07:40.639> three

00:07:40.929 --> 00:07:40.939 
far it's time to move on to part three

00:07:40.939 --> 00:07:42.490 
far it's time to move on to part three
so<00:07:41.270> we'll<00:07:41.389> leave<00:07:41.509> it<00:07:41.719> for<00:07:41.750> now<00:07:41.990> and<00:07:42.259> then

00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:42.500 
so we'll leave it for now and then

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:45.699 
so we'll leave it for now and then
recall<00:07:42.830> part<00:07:43.069> three<00:07:43.310> shortly
