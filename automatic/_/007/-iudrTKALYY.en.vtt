got one car here I have another car here
and<00:00:17.029> I<00:00:18.029> have<00:00:18.570> my<00:00:18.720> kids<00:00:18.990> bike<00:00:19.289> hanging<00:00:19.830> over

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
and I have my kids bike hanging over

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.519 
and I have my kids bike hanging over
there<00:00:20.580> if<00:00:21.390> I<00:00:21.480> swing<00:00:21.779> over<00:00:22.170> I<00:00:22.439> have<00:00:23.070> my<00:00:23.449> tools

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:24.529 
there if I swing over I have my tools

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:28.550 
there if I swing over I have my tools
racks<00:00:25.529> so<00:00:26.039> it's<00:00:26.160> pretty<00:00:26.400> packed<00:00:27.230> so<00:00:28.230> I<00:00:28.260> was

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
racks so it's pretty packed so I was

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.590 
racks so it's pretty packed so I was
looking<00:00:28.680> around<00:00:28.920> for<00:00:29.460> different<00:00:30.650> style<00:00:31.650> of

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:32.600 
looking around for different style of

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.139 
looking around for different style of
racks<00:00:33.600> or<00:00:33.930> hangers<00:00:34.649> and<00:00:34.920> I<00:00:35.430> finally<00:00:35.760> decided

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
racks or hangers and I finally decided

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.229 
racks or hangers and I finally decided
to<00:00:36.770> use<00:00:37.770> this<00:00:38.040> style<00:00:38.340> because<00:00:38.550> it<00:00:38.850> really

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
to use this style because it really

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.270 
to use this style because it really
helps<00:00:39.660> as<00:00:39.870> far<00:00:39.899> as<00:00:40.290> getting<00:00:40.950> it<00:00:41.070> off<00:00:41.250> the

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
helps as far as getting it off the

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.389 
helps as far as getting it off the
ground<00:00:42.110> getting<00:00:43.110> as<00:00:43.350> close<00:00:43.680> to<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:43.950> wall<00:00:44.219> as

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
ground getting as close to the wall as

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.850 
ground getting as close to the wall as
possible<00:00:44.989> and<00:00:45.989> I<00:00:46.050> can<00:00:46.200> still<00:00:46.410> kind<00:00:46.590> of<00:00:46.649> walk

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
possible and I can still kind of walk

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.400 
possible and I can still kind of walk
around<00:00:47.180> the<00:00:48.180> vehicle<00:00:48.360> without<00:00:48.809> banging<00:00:49.289> my

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
around the vehicle without banging my

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.610 
around the vehicle without banging my
head<00:00:49.440> and<00:00:49.829> at<00:00:50.610> this<00:00:50.820> height<00:00:51.120> I<00:00:51.469> can<00:00:52.469> actually

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
head and at this height I can actually

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.250 
head and at this height I can actually
go<00:00:52.920> up<00:00:53.100> to<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.309> bike<00:00:53.520> use<00:00:54.090> both<00:00:54.360> hands<00:00:54.629> lift<00:00:55.140> it

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
go up to the bike use both hands lift it

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.319 
go up to the bike use both hands lift it
off<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.410> rack<00:00:55.800> and<00:00:56.039> just<00:00:56.789> take<00:00:56.940> it<00:00:57.030> off<00:00:57.149> I

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
picked up as you can tell this is a very

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.980 
picked up as you can tell this is a very
simple<00:01:08.659> rack<00:01:09.659> you<00:01:10.200> can<00:01:10.350> use<00:01:11.630> for<00:01:12.630> hanging<00:01:12.900> a

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
simple rack you can use for hanging a

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.580 
simple rack you can use for hanging a

bike I picked these up at Home Depot or

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.340 
bike I picked these up at Home Depot or
Lowe's<00:01:16.619> and<00:01:17.960> they<00:01:18.960> were<00:01:19.340> $6<00:01:20.340> 598<00:01:21.180> each<00:01:22.080> I

Lowe's and they were $6 598 each I

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.190 
Lowe's and they were $6 598 each I
believe<00:01:22.970> very<00:01:23.970> inexpensive<00:01:24.810> very<00:01:25.470> sturdy<00:01:25.950> and

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
believe very inexpensive very sturdy and

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.590 
believe very inexpensive very sturdy and
they<00:01:28.200> also<00:01:28.380> have<00:01:28.590> another<00:01:28.680> style<00:01:29.220> that<00:01:29.600> the

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
they also have another style that the

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.149 
they also have another style that the
two<00:01:30.840> prongs<00:01:31.170> you<00:01:31.439> see<00:01:31.650> sticking<00:01:31.890> out<00:01:32.479> actually

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:34.159 
two prongs you see sticking out actually

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:38.420 
two prongs you see sticking out actually
have<00:01:35.159> it<00:01:35.909> kind<00:01:36.299> of<00:01:36.420> like<00:01:36.540> a<00:01:36.570> Y<00:01:36.810> shape<00:01:37.200> and<00:01:37.500> that

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
have it kind of like a Y shape and that

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.950 
have it kind of like a Y shape and that
is<00:01:38.549> actually<00:01:38.820> meant<00:01:39.030> for<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:39.390> bike<00:01:39.600> itself

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
is actually meant for the bike itself

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.530 
is actually meant for the bike itself
but<00:01:40.290> I<00:01:40.470> didn't<00:01:41.369> like<00:01:41.729> that<00:01:41.759> style<00:01:42.119> too<00:01:42.329> much

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
but I didn't like that style too much

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.330 
but I didn't like that style too much
that's<00:01:42.840> just<00:01:42.930> me<00:01:43.200> but<00:01:43.439> you<00:01:43.590> can<00:01:43.740> use<00:01:43.950> that<00:01:44.130> also

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
that's just me but you can use that also

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.460 
that's just me but you can use that also
I<00:01:44.549> think<00:01:44.700> it's<00:01:44.939> made<00:01:45.030> by<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.210> same<00:01:45.390> company<00:01:45.470> so

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
I think it's made by the same company so

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.080 
I think it's made by the same company so
spreads<00:01:46.920> out<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.220> two-prong<00:01:47.610> you<00:01:47.759> see<00:01:47.939> right

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
spreads out the two-prong you see right

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.120 
spreads out the two-prong you see right
here<00:01:48.119> in<00:01:48.329> this<00:01:48.450> picture<00:01:48.659> it<00:01:49.350> spreads<00:01:49.740> out<00:01:49.829> more

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
here in this picture it spreads out more

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.580 
here in this picture it spreads out more
so<00:01:50.460> holds<00:01:50.759> a<00:01:50.790> bike<00:01:50.970> very<00:01:51.240> balanced<00:01:51.750> this<00:01:52.380> is

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
so holds a bike very balanced this is

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.580 
so holds a bike very balanced this is
the<00:01:52.799> one<00:01:52.950> I<00:01:52.979> ended<00:01:53.430> up<00:01:53.520> using<00:01:53.729> and<00:01:54.439> you<00:01:55.439> just

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
the one I ended up using and you just

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:02.020 
the one I ended up using and you just
have<00:01:55.740> to<00:01:55.829> screw<00:01:56.070> this<00:01:56.189> into<00:01:56.610> the<00:01:57.049> wall<00:01:58.049> stud<00:01:59.450> so

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
have to screw this into the wall stud so

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.280 
have to screw this into the wall stud so
it<00:02:03.030> works<00:02:03.240> very<00:02:03.390> well<00:02:03.509> I<00:02:03.780> don't<00:02:04.110> have<00:02:04.170> a

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
it works very well I don't have a

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.709 
it works very well I don't have a
problem<00:02:04.590> with<00:02:04.680> it<00:02:04.860> it<00:02:05.009> hasn't<00:02:05.240> dropped<00:02:06.240> on<00:02:06.479> my

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
problem with it it hasn't dropped on my

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.249 
problem with it it hasn't dropped on my
head<00:02:06.930> or<00:02:07.079> anything<00:02:07.200> like<00:02:07.380> that<00:02:07.439> it's<00:02:08.369> very

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
head or anything like that it's very

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:12.030 
head or anything like that it's very
