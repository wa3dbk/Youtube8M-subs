the<00:02:22.020> colors<00:02:22.379> inside<00:02:24.440> so<00:02:25.440> not<00:02:25.620> exact<00:02:25.980> we<00:02:26.160> can

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
the colors inside so not exact we can

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.880 
the colors inside so not exact we can
definitely<00:02:26.730> see<00:02:26.910> the<00:02:27.739> similarities<00:02:28.739> between

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
definitely see the similarities between

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:37.070 
definitely see the similarities between
the<00:02:29.160> two<00:02:29.220> of<00:02:29.400> them<00:02:34.610> he<00:02:35.610> can<00:02:35.849> also<00:02:36.269> I<00:02:36.300> drilled

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
the two of them he can also I drilled

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.470 
the two of them he can also I drilled
some<00:02:37.230> holes<00:02:37.260> in<00:02:37.680> his<00:02:37.800> hands<00:02:38.640> and<00:02:38.880> feet<00:02:39.120> so<00:02:39.360> he

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
some holes in his hands and feet so he

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.809 
some holes in his hands and feet so he

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819 
can also tag on to and ride the

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:55.250 
can also tag on to and ride the
surfboard<00:02:45.170> he<00:02:46.170> said<00:02:46.380> shoes<00:02:48.049> there<00:02:49.049> yeah<00:02:54.260> in

he can't hold this as they usually had a
cyber<00:02:59.459> key<00:02:59.730> I<00:02:59.760> could<00:02:59.910> just<00:03:00.239> put<00:03:00.390> a<00:03:00.420> little

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
cyber key I could just put a little

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:07.690 
cyber key I could just put a little
piece<00:03:00.690> of<00:03:00.720> plastic<00:03:01.260> there<00:03:01.440> to<00:03:03.200> simulate<00:03:04.200> the

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.100

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
cyber key and I just popped the blade

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.979 
cyber key and I just popped the blade
out<00:03:10.140> and<00:03:10.620> once<00:03:11.220> the<00:03:11.340> blades<00:03:11.549> popped<00:03:11.849> out<00:03:12.030> there

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
out and once the blades popped out there

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:14.930 
out and once the blades popped out there
is<00:03:13.079> a<00:03:13.110> missile<00:03:13.530> there<00:03:13.709> that<00:03:13.890> launches<00:03:14.310> by

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
is a missile there that launches by

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.470 
is a missile there that launches by
pushing<00:03:15.209> this<00:03:15.420> trigger<00:03:17.120> it<00:03:18.120> launches

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
pushing this trigger it launches

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.800 
pushing this trigger it launches
launches<00:03:18.900> that<00:03:18.930> missile<00:03:19.459> he<00:03:20.459> can<00:03:20.640> I<00:03:20.910> could<00:03:21.569> peg

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
launches that missile he can I could peg
