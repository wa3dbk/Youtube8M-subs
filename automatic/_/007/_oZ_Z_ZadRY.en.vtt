I<00:01:39.659> had<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:39.869> right<00:01:39.990> tool<00:01:40.170> for<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.380> job<00:01:40.470> was

I had the right tool for the job was

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.770 
I had the right tool for the job was
that<00:01:41.070> I<00:01:41.100> wouldn't<00:01:41.369> share<00:01:41.700> once<00:01:42.390> you<00:01:42.479> find<00:01:42.720> a

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
that I wouldn't share once you find a

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.690 
that I wouldn't share once you find a
couple<00:01:42.960> of<00:01:43.140> ratchets<00:01:43.530> that<00:01:43.680> work<00:01:43.860> on<00:01:43.979> 90%<00:01:44.460> of

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700

really she wouldn't when it came apart

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.710 
really she wouldn't when it came apart
was<00:02:43.860> the<00:02:43.980> exhaust<00:02:44.280> system<00:02:44.670> it<00:02:45.180> was<00:02:45.360> something

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
was the exhaust system it was something

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.320 
was the exhaust system it was something
that<00:02:45.750> actually<00:02:45.990> when<00:02:46.500> we<00:02:46.530> had<00:02:47.010> put<00:02:47.970> it<00:02:48.120> back

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
that actually when we had put it back

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:49.940 
that actually when we had put it back
together<00:02:48.570> and<00:02:49.020> got<00:02:49.140> it<00:02:49.320> all<00:02:49.410> welded<00:02:49.650> into

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
together and got it all welded into

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.949 
together and got it all welded into
place<00:02:50.040> it<00:02:50.550> was<00:02:50.670> a<00:02:50.700> little<00:02:51.060> tricky<00:02:51.390> getting<00:02:51.690> it

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
place it was a little tricky getting it

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:53.720

where<00:02:52.080> it<00:02:52.170> was<00:02:52.320> and<00:02:52.980> we<00:02:53.070> learned<00:02:53.250> it<00:02:53.430> was<00:02:53.520> a<00:02:53.550> lot

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
where it was and we learned it was a lot

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.030 
where it was and we learned it was a lot
easier<00:02:53.760> to<00:02:54.120> remove<00:02:54.750> it<00:02:54.990> and<00:02:55.140> install<00:02:55.800> it<00:02:55.830> of

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
the vehicle to get the engine out we got

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.580 
the vehicle to get the engine out we got
the<00:03:01.380> hoist<00:03:02.120> over<00:03:03.120> the<00:03:03.420> engine<00:03:03.630> and<00:03:04.110> we<00:03:04.230> bolted

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
the hoist over the engine and we bolted

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.310 
the hoist over the engine and we bolted
up<00:03:04.739> the<00:03:04.920> chains<00:03:05.400> to<00:03:05.640> it<00:03:05.820> since<00:03:06.660> the<00:03:06.900> cab<00:03:07.080> had

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
up the chains to it since the cab had

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.590 
up the chains to it since the cab had
been<00:03:07.530> previously<00:03:07.739> removed<00:03:08.250> it<00:03:09.060> was<00:03:09.300> a<00:03:09.330> lot

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
been previously removed it was a lot

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.810 
been previously removed it was a lot
easier<00:03:09.870> task<00:03:10.440> and<00:03:10.860> you<00:03:11.340> know<00:03:11.430> there<00:03:11.580> was<00:03:11.640> no

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820 
easier task and you know there was no

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:13.720 
easier task and you know there was no
front<00:03:12.120> clip<00:03:12.390> or<00:03:12.570> anything<00:03:12.959> to<00:03:13.200> get<00:03:13.290> in<00:03:13.410> our<00:03:13.500> way

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
front clip or anything to get in our way

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:15.800 
front clip or anything to get in our way
you<00:03:14.730> would<00:03:14.880> think<00:03:14.910> once<00:03:15.300> the<00:03:15.450> engine<00:03:15.600> and

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810
