00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:28.010
 David in the serve uses one in figure 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:31.810
 marked continental 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:31.810
 close to once you have to 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:37.060
 by placing the left foot about 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:40.460
 centimeters behind the bottom line 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:42.740
 manages to expand the base and with it 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:45.100
 accentuate the body's balance by improving 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:45.100
 your performance 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:51.879
 in the first serve raises the ball more 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.879
 go ahead to get more power 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.740
 in the second is that he lifts the ball 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:29.250
 slightly further back to achieve more 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.250
 effect 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:02.590
 the rest is one of the best shots of 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:07.350
 david we can see how he advances 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.350
 when will you hit on the first rest 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:45.520
 when it comes to a second service 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:48.430
 its rest makes it much closer to the 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:52.710
 bottom line almost roughly a 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.710
 meter with respect to the first serve 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:23.910
 possibly the footwork is the 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.800
 most important quality of david 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:29.120
 your control of the center of gravity in 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:32.640
 every moment of training to recover 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:37.310
 do not take extra steps, that is, do not lose 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:37.310
 never the balance in all the races 

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:59.420
