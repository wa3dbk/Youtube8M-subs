00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
so the woodwinds would go with the

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.670 
so the woodwinds would go with the
woodwinds<00:01:42.299> or<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.689> flutes<00:01:42.930> might<00:01:43.140> just<00:01:43.409> go<00:01:43.530> by

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
woodwinds or the flutes might just go by

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.889 
woodwinds or the flutes might just go by
themselves<00:01:44.189> and<00:01:44.520> then<00:01:45.090> it<00:01:45.210> they<00:01:45.390> see<00:01:45.450> how<00:01:45.750> it

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
themselves and then it they see how it

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.929 
themselves and then it they see how it
feels<00:01:46.170> with<00:01:46.740> just<00:01:47.040> the<00:01:47.159> wood<00:01:47.280> ones<00:01:47.490> there<00:01:47.759> and

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
feels with just the wood ones there and

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.670 
feels with just the wood ones there and
