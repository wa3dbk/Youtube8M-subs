what<00:00:01.230> we're<00:00:01.380> looking<00:00:01.469> at<00:00:01.770> here<00:00:01.829> is<00:00:02.250> the<00:00:02.909> top<00:00:03.449> of

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:03.480 
what we're looking at here is the top of

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.559 
what we're looking at here is the top of
a<00:00:03.840> stairway<00:00:04.350> and<00:00:04.650> basically<00:00:05.640> the<00:00:05.910> top<00:00:06.120> of<00:00:06.420> a

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
a stairway and basically the top of a

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:08.810 
a stairway and basically the top of a
deck<00:00:06.870> the<00:00:07.080> stairway<00:00:07.680> is<00:00:07.859> connecting<00:00:08.370> to<00:00:08.580> the

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
deck the stairway is connecting to the

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.919 
deck the stairway is connecting to the
deck<00:00:09.719> and<00:00:10.190> it<00:00:11.190> looks<00:00:11.429> like<00:00:11.519> they<00:00:12.120> didn't<00:00:12.780> run

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
deck and it looks like they didn't run

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.570 
deck and it looks like they didn't run
the<00:00:12.960> planks<00:00:13.650> far<00:00:14.519> enough<00:00:15.199> to<00:00:16.199> the<00:00:16.279> treads<00:00:17.279> and

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
the planks far enough to the treads and

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.340 
the planks far enough to the treads and
you<00:00:17.640> can<00:00:17.789> see<00:00:18.000> the<00:00:18.119> ones<00:00:18.330> on<00:00:18.510> the<00:00:18.539> right<00:00:18.869> side

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
you can see the ones on the right side

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.550 
you can see the ones on the right side
look<00:00:19.680> like<00:00:19.830> they're<00:00:20.039> okay<00:00:20.460> but<00:00:20.689> we<00:00:21.689> have<00:00:21.960> so

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
look like they're okay but we have so

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.099 
look like they're okay but we have so
let's<00:00:22.769> just<00:00:22.949> go<00:00:23.130> in<00:00:23.400> the<00:00:24.119> first<00:00:24.390> floor<00:00:24.720> on<00:00:25.050> the

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
let's just go in the first floor on the

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.269 
let's just go in the first floor on the
right<00:00:25.320> look<00:00:25.769> okay<00:00:26.250> and<00:00:26.580> the<00:00:27.539> next<00:00:27.949> three<00:00:28.949> and

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
right look okay and the next three and

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.110 
right look okay and the next three and
possibly<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.269> fourth<00:00:30.599> one<00:00:30.840> don't<00:00:31.199> and<00:00:32.160> this

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
possibly the fourth one don't and this

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.930 
possibly the fourth one don't and this
could<00:00:33.360> actually<00:00:33.540> be<00:00:33.809> a<00:00:34.020> trip<00:00:34.649> hazard<00:00:34.940> again

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
could actually be a trip hazard again

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.020 
could actually be a trip hazard again
someone<00:00:36.360> with<00:00:36.600> high<00:00:36.960> heels<00:00:37.309> definitely<00:00:38.309> we

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
someone with high heels definitely we

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.180 
someone with high heels definitely we
just<00:00:39.450> don't<00:00:39.780> want<00:00:40.170> to<00:00:40.230> leave<00:00:40.469> any<00:00:40.710> more<00:00:40.980> than<00:00:41.160> a

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
just don't want to leave any more than a

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.209 
just don't want to leave any more than a
quarter<00:00:41.579> of<00:00:41.610> an<00:00:41.790> inch<00:00:41.940> gap<00:00:42.629> in<00:00:43.079> between<00:00:43.980> oh

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
quarter of an inch gap in between oh

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.100 
quarter of an inch gap in between oh
don't<00:00:44.550> forget<00:00:44.670> this<00:00:44.969> stuff<00:00:45.210> isn't<00:00:45.420> shrinking

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
don't forget this stuff isn't shrinking

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.440 
don't forget this stuff isn't shrinking
regular<00:00:46.620> wood<00:00:46.920> you<00:00:47.789> could<00:00:47.940> end<00:00:48.120> up<00:00:48.210> with<00:00:48.420> a

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
regular wood you could end up with a

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.479 
regular wood you could end up with a
problem<00:00:48.930> where<00:00:49.140> it<00:00:49.440> could<00:00:49.649> actually<00:00:49.800> shrink

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
problem where it could actually shrink

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.930 
problem where it could actually shrink
and<00:00:50.820> your<00:00:51.660> gaps<00:00:51.899> could<00:00:52.199> be<00:00:52.350> wider<00:00:52.940> this

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
and your gaps could be wider this

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.689 
and your gaps could be wider this
man-made<00:00:54.510> decking<00:00:54.989> material<00:00:55.559> isn't<00:00:55.890> going<00:00:56.550> to

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
man-made decking material isn't going to

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.950 
man-made decking material isn't going to
shrink<00:00:57.059> and<00:00:57.840> now<00:00:58.739> that<00:00:59.039> you<00:00:59.309> know<00:00:59.340> that<00:00:59.969> and

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
shrink and now that you know that and

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.240 
shrink and now that you know that and
you're<00:01:01.170> going<00:01:01.260> to<00:01:01.320> build<00:01:01.590> something<00:01:01.859> it

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
you're going to build something it

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.520 
you're going to build something it
shouldn't<00:01:02.460> look<00:01:02.670> like<00:01:02.730> this<00:01:03.290> should<00:01:04.290> look

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
shouldn't look like this should look

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.940 
shouldn't look like this should look
something<00:01:04.860> like<00:01:05.070> this<00:01:06.170> now<00:01:07.170> if<00:01:07.320> you<00:01:07.439> do<00:01:07.560> end<00:01:07.830> up

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
something like this now if you do end up

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.649 
something like this now if you do end up
with<00:01:08.159> something<00:01:08.369> like<00:01:08.729> this<00:01:08.760> realistically

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
with something like this realistically

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.700 
with something like this realistically
it<00:01:10.049> won't<00:01:10.500> be<00:01:10.890> that<00:01:10.920> difficult<00:01:11.460> to<00:01:11.880> fix<00:01:12.710> simply

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
it won't be that difficult to fix simply

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.999 
it won't be that difficult to fix simply
draw<00:01:14.189> a<00:01:14.520> straight<00:01:15.330> line<00:01:15.360> go<00:01:16.020> back<00:01:16.229> to<00:01:16.530> the

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
between the tread and the decking and

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:31.580 
between the tread and the decking and
simply<00:01:26.700> draw<00:01:26.970> a<00:01:27.000> line<00:01:27.650> cut<00:01:28.650> it<00:01:28.799> and<00:01:28.979> put<00:01:30.590> a

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
simply draw a line cut it and put a

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.330 
simply draw a line cut it and put a
small<00:01:32.310> strip<00:01:32.700> in<00:01:32.970> between<00:01:33.570> and<00:01:33.960> you<00:01:34.530> are<00:01:34.860> done

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
small strip in between and you are done

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.580 
small strip in between and you are done
it<00:01:36.270> should<00:01:36.450> look<00:01:36.509> something<00:01:36.689> like<00:01:37.079> this<00:01:37.380> and

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
it should look something like this and

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.789 
it should look something like this and
again<00:01:37.680> these<00:01:38.009> you<00:01:38.549> can<00:01:38.759> do<00:01:39.170> you<00:01:40.170> can<00:01:40.200> take<00:01:40.560> this

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
again these you can do you can take this

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.030 
again these you can do you can take this
information<00:01:41.070> and<00:01:41.820> adapt<00:01:42.270> it<00:01:42.450> to<00:01:42.479> a<00:01:43.049> bunch<00:01:43.829> of

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
information and adapt it to a bunch of

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.120 
information and adapt it to a bunch of
different<00:01:44.460> things<00:01:45.259> you<00:01:46.259> know<00:01:46.350> do<00:01:46.560> it<00:01:46.649> do<00:01:46.920> it<00:01:46.950> a

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
different things you know do it do it a

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.590 
different things you know do it do it a
few<00:01:47.159> different<00:01:47.700> ways<00:01:47.820> and<00:01:48.060> again<00:01:48.270> if<00:01:48.390> you<00:01:48.450> only

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
few different ways and again if you only

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.289 
few different ways and again if you only
have<00:01:48.840> one<00:01:49.200> piece<00:01:49.680> you've<00:01:50.430> got<00:01:50.579> two<00:01:50.729> maybe<00:01:51.210> two

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
have one piece you've got two maybe two

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.480 
have one piece you've got two maybe two
boards<00:01:51.899> and<00:01:52.500> you<00:01:52.619> want<00:01:52.799> to<00:01:52.860> just<00:01:53.009> cut<00:01:53.220> the<00:01:53.250> two

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
boards and you want to just cut the two

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.280 
boards and you want to just cut the two
boards<00:01:53.820> cut<00:01:54.090> it<00:01:54.210> cut<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.600> two<00:01:54.750> boars<00:01:54.990> and<00:01:55.140> put

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
boards cut it cut the two boars and put

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.679 
boards cut it cut the two boars and put
a<00:01:55.320> strip<00:01:55.590> in<00:01:55.740> there<00:01:55.890> that's<00:01:56.100> fine<00:01:56.689> something

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
a strip in there that's fine something

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.389 
a strip in there that's fine something
like<00:01:57.869> this<00:01:58.049> obviously<00:01:58.290> looks<00:01:58.979> like<00:01:59.189> it

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
like this obviously looks like it

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.679 
like this obviously looks like it
belongs<00:01:59.960> you<00:02:00.960> know<00:02:01.079> you<00:02:01.170> could<00:02:01.500> always<00:02:01.530> take

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:02.689 
belongs you know you could always take

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:05.300 
belongs you know you could always take
one<00:02:03.689> of<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:04.020> treads<00:02:04.380> that<00:02:04.770> you<00:02:04.979> could<00:02:05.159> take

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
one of the treads that you could take

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.809 
one of the treads that you could take
the<00:02:05.460> back<00:02:05.700> tread<00:02:06.060> off<00:02:06.799> move<00:02:07.799> it<00:02:08.039> back<00:02:08.369> and<00:02:08.700> then

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
the back tread off move it back and then

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.029 
the back tread off move it back and then
put<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.209> strip<00:02:09.509> in<00:02:09.720> between<00:02:10.259> the<00:02:10.440> two<00:02:10.619> treads

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
put the strip in between the two treads

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.040 
put the strip in between the two treads
also
