00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.080
Sup I’m Stas Davidov!

00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:02.640
First vid was sent by nenovosti.

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:04.120
Do you like dried fish with your beer?

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:06.840
And now you’ll see a fish who’d have YOU with beer [you ;[ ].

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:07.440
Dried.

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.960
I havent’s seen this before. Wow. 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.280
Give them some more. A drop.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.480
Haha, they’re fighting, fighting.

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.800
You’ve just watched a miniature called “fish drank”  

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.040
Judging by those mugs, yesterday they’ve been having some vodka. 

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.560
I mean yesterday evening, drinking vodka during the day is showing bad manners. [Stas will teach you good ones] 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.680
Went a bit too much, started fighting, got a turtle naked, threw up in the pond [like on the 1st of September]

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.360
Wonder if fish can throw up.

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:38.640
Hello, my name is Cat Fish and I’m an alcoholic. 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.000
What, everyone loves czech beer.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.840
I wonder, how does a drunk fish swim?

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.200
But it’s nothing special really. Beer is liquid bread. 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.440
Fish eat bread, right? Right. That’s it, get a life. 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.120
Oh yeah, all-purpose political joke from Ruslachev:

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.600
Cutting of Russian budget for 2012.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.920
[they’re fighting]　[they’re fighting]

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.880
I wonder, if it was a non-alcoholic beer, would they fight for it like that?

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.640
Altho just look at those cat-piranhas!

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.880
The last one, hahaha... [Scary =(]

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.840
You can even throw logs in there, they’ll eat anything [like langoliers]

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:14.600
And this is horosho!

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:21.720
This vid has been there since March but recently in was uploaded to 9gag and views skyrocketed. 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.160
So, a Katy Parry live.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.880
She’s performing a cover of Jay-Z’s song and decides to show off her flute [flute] skills.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.640
[YO] [YO] [YO]

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.560
Question: can she sing? 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:02.640
Or like Kirkorov?

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.360
But she’s cute. Like a cat.

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.280
She could’ve even licked her balls, she’d still look cute.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.120
And I’m not saying she has balls

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.320
[There’s your balls!]

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.040
I’m sure she fakes it in bed as well! [100% info]

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.400
But i know a flute she *really* can play [holding a candle]

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.040
[youunderstand]

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.360
[U dumb] If you never got it, it’s Katy’s “thing” [ololo], she does that on every concert. Of the tour

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.840
[f*ck you]

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:24.640
Nice “thing” [crap tho].

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.040
Altho if i was there i’d feel scammed [i want my money back!!]

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.840
Prolly screwed up the first time and decided to do it every time as if it’s the “thing” [nailed it!]

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.240
And of course, comments are full of witty and capable young people [Schoolie™]

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.000
And while some young people are talking shit for coz of the fail,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.840
others [11 grade] are realizing that it’s Katy’s joke. And talking shit coz it sucks.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.400
Well, what can i say?

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.520
[lacking words]

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:44.040
And this is Horosho!

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.280
Third vid was sent by MrAspirinnum.

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.600
So, there’s been a meeting of president Medvedev and the internet folks [trolls, liars and virgins].

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.840
And there was this dude on this meating who drew a comic about Medvedev and Putin playing WoW. 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.600
And decided to show it to the president personally.

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.160
- Here’s you, the green one.

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.000
- And the blue one is Putin?

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.560
- Yes, correct. That’s Puting playing a troll.

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:06.880
That was the last time they saw the kid [sadnessness ;[ ]

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.160
So he came to the president and calling him an orc. In his face! [bitchslap much?]

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.720
And Putin’s a troll! So he said.

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.800
That kid has balls of Titanium!

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.440
I wonder if trolls eat kids. 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:16.920
Or just blow up buildings? [.rf]

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.480
Altho, if you think logically, Medvedev should play a Bumblebee. And Putin should be a Crab.

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.360
- Tell me, if playing orc worth it? I need to know!

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:29.880
- Tis alrite.

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.040
People tell you that you play WoW too much? 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.880
Tell them the Russian President approves! [Prezident apruvz

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.560
- My son is participating in all this very actively...

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.200
- What race is he playing? - Pfft, i dont remember.

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.040
You hear that guys? We should find out what server he plays on!

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.040
When will we have the next opportunity to kick the son of president’s ass? [mini-Medvedev]

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:51.760
- Maybe i’ll join it sometimes, if you make a russian version of it.

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.000
Ooh no, Dmitry Anatolyevich, [Russian MMO] running around in magical armour

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.040
raiding Baba-Yaga for farting grass [complete bullshit] - it’s not what you want.

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:00.520
And they can steal your Urk there.

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:03.760
And now we know that the most leveled up char will win the elections! [President lvl85]

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:04.440
And this is Horosho! 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.360
And the question was sent to us by PIZERok

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.080
What do you do during the weekend?

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:12.040
Pizerok asks, what do you do during the weekend? [what do you do during the weekend?]

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.760
Leave your interesting comments here on Youtube! 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.920
I already explained it, but you can watch the “how to send a video question” here.

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:20.680

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:24.840
All you fluters can suck it! Mine plays hoboe ;)

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.920
She’s gone - played too much )))

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:29.000

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.080

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.160

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.200
