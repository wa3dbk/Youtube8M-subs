00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.649
 very good people today we are here to 

00:00:02.949 --> 00:00:07.779
 show you a little something and it's for you to see 

00:00:05.649 --> 00:00:09.820
 how can I record the playstation 4 with 

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:12.610
 a see half in cantur eh that has 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:15.240
 outputs by components and tracy as 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:17.560
 you do then right now I'm going to teach 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:22.690
 Well, I'm going to show my 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:28.619
 desk television and here we have the 

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:28.619
 playstation 4 with here is the gadget 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:33.890
 hdmi converter what we do with this as 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:37.430
 Well right now I explain it as you see 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:40.640
 this is an hdmi converter to 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:43.339
 components for this reason is why 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.680
 I can record the playstation 4 function 

00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:48.260
 what this converter has is that through 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:51.190
 of the hdmi 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:54.160
 of the console takes you out 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:56.440
 the components then the components 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:59.050
 the captor sends us and of the 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.820
 capturing I send them to the television such and 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.940
 how could it be done with playstation 3 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:06.700
 so for that reason it's the reason why it's 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:11.470
 why can I record and also apart 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:14.440
 because this converter has the skips 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:17.740
 protection protection 1 control 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:21.850
 of the protection that calls playstation to 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:23.920
 the time to record is worth and good little thing 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:27.610
 more I have to tell you good if one thing 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:30.580
 ok I want to say that with this with this 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:33.970
 converter is worth to see them the 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:35.830
 tele contrast is very bad I do not 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:38.229
 I recommend if you have average laver without 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:41.080
 capture hd I would not recommend playing 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:43.270
 directly with the quality that brings you 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.830
 in components this converter is worth 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.510
 because we are going to play a new 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:50.120
 generation 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:51.620
 in the image quality that brings this out 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.480
 the truth that leaves much to be desired 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:56.570
 then what can you do as you see here 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:59.450
 underneath this is an HDMI splitter worth the 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:01.820
 function that has this is from a signal 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.920
 of the playstation by hdmi 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.770
 this for example can you get me eight 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.420
 identical signals then I a signal 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.180
 from this one he sent me directly to the 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:13.970
 tele to play and another signal me the 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:16.190
 sent the component converter to the 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.110
 tele then I have two signals from the 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.210
 playstation one per component that is the 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.040
 that you read regular is with which you recorded 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:23.960
 so when I put on TV in the 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.870
 I put the signal by component 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:29.750
 I get playstation 4 and the other the 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.640
 of the hdmi because I have two signals and with 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.990
 the one that plays with the hdmi when 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.970
 I have to do anything with the 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:36.260
 see media to see the menu I'm going to 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.260
 components and from there I can 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:42.140
 set up so that you know people 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:44.810
 that you have a see half in hdi capture 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:48.200
 and do not want to change it because you know that 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.820
 these handles wheels are worth 27 of 30 euros and 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.890
 you do not have to buy a capture device 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.930
 new that is worth a lot more 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.610
 I hope I have helped you with this video and 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.520
 that you know that compound avermedia in 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:00.050
 hd capture or record worth anything a 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.650
 big greeting and see you in the 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:02.650
 next video
