00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 hello today i will show you the system 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:05.910
 glaze 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.990
 which can be used for both 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:12.240
 proper for irrigation itself and how 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:16.100
 sprayer system is simple here three 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:19.050
 The main component is a water tank 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:21.710
 the capacity of this case is on us the barrel itself 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:26.580
 the pump that makes the pressure creates and 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:28.980
 reverse here's a hose with a tap using 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.489
 which can regulate pressure in 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.920
 the case when we need watering and need 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.960
 slight pressure that is in reverse 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.770
 hose goes mainstream 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.520
 either when we use as 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:43.739
 sprayer then we need more 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:48.059
 pressures here we look with you on 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:49.739
 hose which gives us mobility then 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:53.640
 there we are already not well so not 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:57.329
 highly dependent on the barrel with a pump then 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.940
 you can refill this barrel once 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.640
 whether with water or for spraying 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.519
 solution and calmly do not work 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.140
 distracted by the fact that you need to drag 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:10.710
 pull but actually the outlet to 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:13.229
 the pump worked need not yes in every place 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:16.259
 there is a power outlet in the garden yes 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:19.009
 use as a sprayer now 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:21.600
 which we show that pressure 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:23.700
 check valve closes and here 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:28.439
 here at the end of this hose is long lasting 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:31.700
 tube with a nozzle and open this clan 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.720
 croc wounds and use as 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:38.369
 sprayer but now we just 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:40.820
 Pour and then show already grown 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:44.159
 cabbage how is it going 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:46.710
 actually spraying itself in parallel 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:50.430
 I can tell that here we are not just 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:54.240
 already treat water the cabbage do 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.330
 disease prevention process 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.000
 solution 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:01.830
 Zelenka ordinary bought the most ordinary 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:06.460
 a pharmacy in concentration somewhere around 40 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:09.430
 50 cable on a bucket of water with this 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:12.430
 the solution we process that is 

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:16.860
 innovative can by no means method themselves 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:20.490
 came to him by reading the article forums that 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:24.430
 prevention here in the initial stage 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:26.320
 here the disease is not given rise well 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.360
 we from two angles looked first with 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:30.010
 one now on the other side 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.880
 there is not to reach far and you can 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:36.610
 it was calm and most importantly evenly 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:38.410
 process this solution from but passed 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.480
 Cal is now shown that from far away how 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:42.280
 would she be sprayed there as far as 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.010
 therefore it is impossible to assess qualitatively 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:47.470
 we go in two ways that us 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:50.880
 allows you to make a long hose that is 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:54.220
 mobility we save and process 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.260
 fully so that the pests on me were 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.090
 scary 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:00.550
 Thanks for watching if you liked 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.440
 put likes subscribe to the channel 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:05.320
 what is recommendations slime 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:08.760
 wishes I will be glad to listen to everyone 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.760
 thank you all bye
