sayCet is music which basically
sounds electronic, and which still is today...

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
in the end, I think that's what
makes this music rather accessible.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
We tried to kind of use a
three-person creative process.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
There's Zita Cochet, who takes
care of video and lights

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
There's Phoene, who sings, plays guitar
and also composes music with me.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:03.000
It's Pierre who is the real composer for sayCet.
I'm the one who writes songs, because I sing 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000
and so it was easier, even natural,
for it to happen that way.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
I write in English. In the beginning it was to hide
myself, so that people didn't understand the lyrics.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.000
I like the musicality of English, and I think
that the music we make can be exported,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.000
in any case we want it
to travel across borders 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
In the end, English is still the language
which is easiest to export.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
When we play live, we really want
to create a certain mood,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
with the music, the video...
everything circulates around.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:57.000
We try to create an overall atmosphere,
something that feels intimate.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Each piece has its own music score
and afterwards the editing takes place live. 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
This is what really makes
it a musical analogy. 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000
There is a musical score with notes and
each note corresponds to a certain shot.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:19.000
It's a multi-projection on 3 screens and
the images are spread out over the 3 screens.
