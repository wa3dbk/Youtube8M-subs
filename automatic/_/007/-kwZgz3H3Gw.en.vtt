00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:17.480
 to be benefited can be obtained 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:20.360
 of swarms caught in the nature of 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:23.420
 frames with damaged or old combs 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:25.759
 and dark spots and the sopes that are the 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:29.140
 small wax layer that closes the 

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:29.140
 alveoli of mellow honey 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:35.030
 The wax is placed directly on the 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:37.610
 melting machine waiting for the time 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:40.700
 necessary for it to merge and become 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:42.530
 be of nothing can be melted in 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:45.080
 presence of water if it is too 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:48.350
 unknown which causes the separation of the 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:51.560
 impurities or directly as is the case 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:54.590
 of the alveoli or of new combs 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:57.290
 the container receiving the wax to 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:59.480
 cooling should be conical with the mouth 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:01.970
 which is the basis for facilitating the 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:04.070
 removal of wax blocks 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:07.189
 In this example a bucket of 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:09.710
 Plastic any refiner to 

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:11.810
 Purification by melting in clean water has 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.149
 to be made in water other than this 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.940
 work or contains limestone 

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:20.240
 the quality of the product 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:23.590
 water may be added 2% acid 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.550
 oxalic acid or 1% sulfuric acid 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.220
 adding one of the products 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:30.830
 slowly and carefully and that goes 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.760
 result in a more intense separation of 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:34.370
 impurities 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:37.190
 here we can observe a process of 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:39.490
 melt being made without water to be 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:42.830
 to leave for training at the debtor's base 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:45.170
 falling into a bucket placed just below 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:49.190
 passing through a sieve in which the 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:51.320
 impurities are retained for the industry to 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:54.080
 wax can be sold in blocks with 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:56.270
 specified weights and this is not a 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:59.390
 very common form of commercialization 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:02.090
 between beekeepers the blocks can be 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:04.430
 packed with waxed paper the film of 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:07.939
 polyethylene to protect against 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:10.159
 dryness and insect attack should be 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:13.340
 be stored free from contact with 

00:02:10.159 --> 00:02:15.610
 insecticides derived from petroleum paints 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.799
 solvents and other chemicals 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:21.730
 the industrial market almost 

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:21.730
 today it does not exist anymore 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:26.260
 is the scene has been used outside the 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:29.950
 environment the film has been used 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:33.270
 more to the artisanal market is 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:37.350
 use of handmade lipsticks from 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:41.290
 soaps is in the use of products 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:42.940
 cosmetic type for women is in the 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:47.740
 hair removal 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:51.210
 so start narrowing to smaller ones. 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:51.210
 producers let's say like this
