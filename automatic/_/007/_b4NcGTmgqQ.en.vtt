got a baseball signed by Johnny Bench
probably<00:01:54.030> been<00:01:54.329> up<00:01:54.420> there<00:01:54.600> because<00:01:55.380> while

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
probably been up there because while

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.560 
probably been up there because while
there's<00:01:55.979> so<00:01:56.130> much<00:01:56.310> III<00:01:56.670> involved<00:01:57.180> in<00:01:57.299> the<00:01:57.390> wall

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
there's so much III involved in the wall

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.499 
there's so much III involved in the wall
their<00:01:57.930> balance<00:01:58.560> works<00:01:58.799> so<00:01:59.579> tell<00:01:59.790> us<00:01:59.820> about<00:02:00.000> the

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
their balance works so tell us about the

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.870 
their balance works so tell us about the
building<00:02:00.869> of<00:02:00.899> the<00:02:01.020> actual<00:02:01.560> wall<00:02:02.009> itself<00:02:02.460> the

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
building of the actual wall itself the

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.740 
building of the actual wall itself the
plan<00:02:03.240> is<00:02:03.420> based<00:02:03.659> on<00:02:03.899> a<00:02:04.430> sketched<00:02:05.430> out<00:02:05.640> idea<00:02:06.540> on

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
plan is based on a sketched out idea on

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.040 
plan is based on a sketched out idea on
graph<00:02:06.990> paper<00:02:07.020> I<00:02:07.530> knew<00:02:07.680> I<00:02:07.710> wanted<00:02:07.979> it<00:02:08.280> to<00:02:08.429> be

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
graph paper I knew I wanted it to be

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:10.430 
graph paper I knew I wanted it to be
balanced<00:02:10.050> but

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
balanced but

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.130 
balanced but
so<00:02:10.560> very<00:02:10.830> segmented<00:02:11.190> which<00:02:12.090> is<00:02:12.240> a<00:02:12.270> take<00:02:12.960> some

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
so very segmented which is a take some

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.930 
so very segmented which is a take some
time<00:02:13.320> but<00:02:13.860> lots<00:02:14.160> of<00:02:14.280> fussing<00:02:14.640> with<00:02:14.820> the

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
time but lots of fussing with the

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.330 
time but lots of fussing with the
original<00:02:15.240> design<00:02:15.540> so<00:02:15.920> you<00:02:16.920> just<00:02:17.160> need<00:02:17.310> a

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
original design so you just need a

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.550 
original design so you just need a
little<00:02:17.490> graph<00:02:17.760> paper<00:02:18.120> and<00:02:18.390> a<00:02:18.420> pencil<00:02:18.660> and<00:02:19.110> you

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
little graph paper and a pencil and you

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.890 
little graph paper and a pencil and you
too<00:02:19.770> and<00:02:20.100> you<00:02:20.760> have<00:02:20.790> one<00:02:21.090> of<00:02:21.120> these<00:02:21.270> would<00:02:21.810> it

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
too and you have one of these would it

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.810 
too and you have one of these would it
be<00:02:22.020> okay<00:02:22.320> if<00:02:22.350> I<00:02:22.950> added<00:02:23.160> something<00:02:23.400> to<00:02:23.550> the<00:02:23.700> wall

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
be okay if I added something to the wall

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.720 
be okay if I added something to the wall
I<00:02:24.000> wouldn't<00:02:24.330> love<00:02:24.480> free<00:02:24.900> dazzle<00:02:25.260> wall<00:02:25.590> this<00:02:26.520> is

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
I wouldn't love free dazzle wall this is

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.570 
I wouldn't love free dazzle wall this is

walking us through the wall of it and
for<00:02:43.110> building<00:02:43.290> along<00:02:43.590> in<00:02:43.680> the<00:02:43.770> first<00:02:43.890> place
