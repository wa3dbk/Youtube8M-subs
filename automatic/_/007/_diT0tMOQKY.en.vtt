00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.150
 hello to all and blanzat that we 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.490
 found today for a new 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.230
 video about a click 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:24.910
 again and not a gap veil 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:27.849
 to enter the apartment of 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:29.230
 trevor who use it in town good 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:32.950
 it's not exactly his apartment 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:35.500
 it is the one of debra the 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:37.990
 the girlfriend of the wade cousin if you 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.210
 remember in the career so 

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:42.360
 here is the apartment is here on the 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.360
 map 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:48.390
 just here 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:53.519
 so to enter the apartment a 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.980
 known technique that a lot of people 

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:59.550
 use now come here you you 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.620
 park there you go to the corner just to 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.379
 side of the door so in the corner here 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.759
 and you launch a mission 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:07.320
 good there in the frame where I have a mission 

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:07.740
 no problem I can throw it 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.930
 like that 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:14.490
 if you do not have everything 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:16.229
 simply directory anyone and 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.409
 you wait for them to offer you a 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.409
 activity 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:25.619
 So here I am asking for activity 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.600
 and so he will send an activity that I 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.490
 could launch I launch this activity 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.580
 always staying in the corner well the 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:35.600
 corner looking at the wall 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.600
 I start the activity 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.259
 I confirm the settings well thought out 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.570
 confirm the settings otherwise they will you 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.560
 will return directly on on the game to 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.720
 where you are 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.330
 without even reloading the map so there I 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:55.530
 confirm the settings I do round if 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:56.549
 I'm on ps3 will have and I'm leaving 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.960
 do you really want to leave this 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:06.000
 activity yes and there I will reappear 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:07.289
 in the apartment of debra where where he 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.599
 is going on the last killing 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:13.170
 when when trevor kills a little bit everything 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:15.690
 the world so here is this place that 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.160
 does not serve much globally 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.100
 can be nice to land with 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.810
 multiple players and then from there 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.380
 you do what you want you is 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.850
 untouchable 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.670
 people can not get into 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.319
 apartment 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:31.200
 and besides you can not go out 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:33.930
 no longer so here I hope this 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.849
 this glitch will have pleased you do not hesitate to 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.800
