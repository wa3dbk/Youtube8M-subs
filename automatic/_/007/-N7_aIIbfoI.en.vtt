00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 my tips so day number three with 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.839
 our advent calendar 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.210
 Let's see what's in there today, let's see 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.250
 what we improvise so much today 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.950
 can 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:18.330
 I have something very cool here, too 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:22.020
 Card number 15 gimmick puppet 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:25.320
 giant meat mincer thought monster 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.330
 the 219 needs and opposites 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.519
 the other two is relatively playable 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.070
 even there I believe even in anime 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:35.579
 yes, I do not remember exactly 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:38.550
 the gmk puppets has played believes 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:42.809
 that was the first fiesling of vectrix 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:45.000
 children's fortieth effect for the things 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.940
 is actually quite cool attika 15 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.530
 11 25 a business software in phase 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.719
 one you can an expertise card 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.640
 depend and then one of a specific one 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.980
 ghost little control is destructive 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.250
 and then if it is for the opponent in 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:04.290
 he considers his reason better than harm 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:06.689
 yes, pretty cool card is on the other hand 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.400
 often played around because you stop there 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.650
 grasp the majority or can use 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.840
 stop in another level 8 6 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:16.200
 there were also the various with kulows 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.670
 or galaxies with it can be relatively fast 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.020
 the opponent away with when two access 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.390
 points the field has so much 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.159
 many articles 25 are already there 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.290
 5000 because it can be effective though 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:28.439
 use and have with 2 5 tev actually 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.119
 very solid yes solid rudi for that 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.250
 content to stop something like that 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:36.329
 stronger monster as eg comes then dante 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:38.670
 or what's your name again virtual 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.439
 not because he is strong enough 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.259
 in the def and with darkness too 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.579
 very very good attribute and yes easy 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.079
 cool what you should say so much 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.960
 is actually a pretty good card 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.950
 He does not have many attacks relatively 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.960
 the defense distributes a card 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.460
 afterwards its effect is used or you have 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.850
 the neck mode and thus fast 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.170
 is turned 15 solid interesting 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.570
 that it's just an effect 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.549
 mainframes 1 is limited I believe 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.220
 That's our stuff to avoid that 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.020
 one somehow the opponent 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.790
 is doing a lot with it and mainz 2 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.740
 then hold all the opponents' lounge 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.390
 they seem to be pure but that keeps that 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.220
 opponents here anyway I on the 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.480
 yes the whole monster from the window rooms 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.070
 then attack directly 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.060
 actually pretty cool he has otherwise 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.410
 no disadvantage that he does not 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.390
 can attack or so was the move 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.670
 that uses something pretty cool too 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.620
 and yes, at the moment there is not 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.360
 so many level 8 covers just the 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.010
 regularly from long and tight sylvanas 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.430
 I could not do that 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:35.750
 who played the games and otherwise he stayed 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:37.070
 darkworks galaxy galaxies are so he the 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.110
 probably the lyrics the texts 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:40.640
 squeeze out but it will be on everyone 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.500
 case a noticeable card than 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.580
 the two colleagues behind and I hope 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.709
 also now my opinion everyone too 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:48.470
 We will meet you tomorrow 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:50.830
 with door number four is then exactly to 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.830
 morning
