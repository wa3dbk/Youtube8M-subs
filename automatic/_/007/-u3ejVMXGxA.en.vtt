 what will happen if you walk like that all the time 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.600
 by the way similar troubles pursue 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:59.610
 and stars of domestic show business 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.090
 many of which are also very dependent on 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.369
 your gadgets 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:07.030

 foreign doctors believe that the text is young 

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:26.950
 more dangerous for health than sitting by 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.329
 computer scares can even proud 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.129
 grow spine experiences 

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:30.849

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:35.049
 and many do not even notice the development 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.120
 may I ask you so often 

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:39.280

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:43.239
 navigate in the space of years I'm on 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:46.150
 autopilot these services themselves are so arranged 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:47.920
 so that a man deep in them goes to 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:51.099
 In this case, almost as in the matrix 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:55.329
 technology sucks because the thing is 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:58.599
 that although the form I write there really 

00:02:55.329 --> 00:03:01.000
 this is not a correspondence really this communication 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:02.620
 metro hongkong already warn about

 decided in the meantime on the street like 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.949
 Zombies are getting bigger 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.060

 people with headphones 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:30.099
