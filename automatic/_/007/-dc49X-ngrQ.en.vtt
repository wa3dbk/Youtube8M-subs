00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 hello and welcome to this 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.410
 video tutorial for white balance my 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.110
 name is konstantin from munich foto.de 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:12.090
 and today I show you how to do it 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:13.170
 color cast instructor removed here 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.560
 this image of the augsburg town hall 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:19.140
 you see steam right through the sodium 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.000
 lighting the street lamps have 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.910
 we want as a yellow color cast to 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.220
 we find out lightroom offers us 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.199
 There are three ways to do this 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.199
 three ways but really use 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.239
 we must compulsorily in raw format 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:35.850
 take pictures of our camera when we are in 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.469
 jpeg-format photography makes any 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.020
 correction the result only worse than 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.790
 So first step in the room 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.100
 take pictures so that's what I have here 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.170
 made and therefore there are now three 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.320
 possibilities as announced the first 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:54.719
 possibility quite simply here in the 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:57.420
 lightroom menu treatment finds here 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.460
 your point automatically next to right 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.320
 ba for white balance is called automatically 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.000
 lightroom tries to work independently 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.559
 to set the white balance and 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.060
 Catastrophe is all going to be a lot 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.240
 we are doing worse than before 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.740
 not replace back as recording so 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.030
 like the camera the white balance itself 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.250
 has stopped there are still a few 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.259
 other attitudes the presets 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.750
 We'll do the same for your camera here 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:21.950
 Also you do not need then not exist 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:25.200
 here this white balance selection 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:27.270
 just the button on your keyboard 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.119
 press and then comes this little one 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:33.030
 tool for selection is looking for you 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:34.770
 neutral goal is something of the he 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.860
 is that it usually if there is no 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.689
 color cast would have been white or gray would be without 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.540
 to have some color cast in 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:44.520
 In my case, this is this 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:47.670
 surface here at the facade clique 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:50.880
 says bohm and the whole picture 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:53.640
 obtained a completely different mood makes 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.380
 it should also be much cooler because of 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.479
 yellow color cast was removed looks 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.460
 already quite good but not quite 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:02.610
 we come perfectly to the third variant 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:06.360
 Here is this little slider 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:08.520
 I assume that color temperature tempo 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.879
 pull him back and forth and look like 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.500
 my result started changing 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:15.480
 we have as the pipette 2 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.550
 1000 showed that was the small one 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.560
 tick too cool I prefer it 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:22.530
 a little further to the right fist rule 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:25.260
 left cooler so blue right warmer 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:29.670
 So yellow 2200 is me again 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:32.790
 a bit too warm in this case scarce 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.320
 2100 looks right for me so 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.280
 again the three possibilities in the 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.790
 rapidly scrolling 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.320
 first, automatic white balance 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:43.010
 does not always work secondly 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:45.690
 Pipette does not always work either 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:48.120
 third, this unfortunately so long 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:50.970
 go back and forth until it really does 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.770
 like always works 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.750
 but not as terribly accurate as 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:57.030
 sometimes the results that pipetting 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:01.830
 tool with a really flawless 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:05.580
 but could achieve ride in this 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:07.350
 case, the manual adjustments were even 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.239
 more precisely, try these three 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:11.520
 possibilities look out for which 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:13.470
 you work best and 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.090
 maybe you also combine it 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.220
 comes with the pipette first in the 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.110
 rough direction where to go and 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.880
 then adjust manually a bit more 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:23.580
 after works mostly very well 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.230
 little note yet to the slider here 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:28.410
 below tint below 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.910
 even with it we can the light mood 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.920
 we change in the picture and we draw 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:34.459
 to the left we have a green tint 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:38.580
 we pull to the right we have one 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:40.380
 magenta purple tint on the slider 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:43.110
 I have not received so far because in 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:45.090
 the vast majority do not actually 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:46.829
 you should actually come to fruition 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.019
 times have a corresponding color cast 

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:50.360
 Of course you can do that here too 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:53.280
 correct 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:54.720
 thanks for watching i hope it has 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.070
 you like it and i have the whole in 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.579
 well over the short time 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:02.750
 may be up in berlin maybe 

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:02.750
