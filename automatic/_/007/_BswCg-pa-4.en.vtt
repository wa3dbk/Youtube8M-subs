00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:05.160
 hi guys and compass and welcome to 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:08.160
 another new video and how they saw it in the 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:11.010
 tsunami mod title in big cars 5 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.840
 online and seriously this is my way 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.849
 preferred since it is brutal and it is 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.830
 spectacular ok but first of all if 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.900
 we could reach the amount of 300 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.150
 likes would be perfect and I would appreciate it 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.760
 a lot because this is what one 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.250
 of the mods of my favorites without counting 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.130
 the superman or that is the super 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.560
 basically allowing character 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.149
 that you are using it fly I do not know if 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.430
 you can notice then what I have activated 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.079
 Besides, I did not put the skin on, but the 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.550
 truth is that it's a brutal way for the 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.590
 person who wants to download it for 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.570
 and they wonder what console are you on 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.129
 I find then on the computer that would be 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.870
 the computer and if they want it 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.270
 download then I'll leave them in the 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.370
 description ok this video I wanted to take it out 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.079
 live but something strange happened that the 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.670
 voice was cut and some more things happened 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.260
 but here I bring you a gameplay 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.719
 commented that the truth that to me 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.609
 he really liked this lot as they see it 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.980
 I have here mixed the superman mold 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.930
 and also this for which I can therefore 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.909
 basically go flying just above 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.229
 this but if they notice it right 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.810
 what the city of the 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.969
 saints is totally flooded 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.950
 ok this affects much of the map and 

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:16.289
 this comes quite well since if 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.479
 we realize then everything is 

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:20.369
 flooded something that gave me a lot of laughter 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.020
 is that people are driving but 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.000
 suddenly like the car falls off 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.979
 from the floor and starts to float and the truth 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.469
 which is very strange also something 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.959
 what happens in what this mod is doing 

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:32.520
 is that there are some tides more than anything like 

00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:35.280
 some types of water that you see 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.380
 extremely dark indeed the 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.329
 gameplay was pretty long they were like 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.610
 40 minutes but here as he did some 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.289
 cuts and I brought them as the best 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.270
 clips are the best parts not here 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:46.890
 as you see it is one of the parties in the 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.750
 which we can appreciate that as the 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.329
 tide or more than anything the water 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.219
 it converts quite well what is going 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:55.170
 making it quite dark we could not 

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:56.789
 say it somehow and when we go out 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.000
 as to the surface we see everything 

00:01:56.789 --> 00:02:02.310
 exaggeratedly as bright the mod is 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.109
 a little bit failed or is there some 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.849
 things that fail a little bit like I could 

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:07.709
 be like water goes through like the 

00:02:05.849 --> 00:02:09.720
 floor, but it's something that the creator of 

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:11.700
 mold is all repairing and is 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.690
 making it to the government too 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.280
 you may notice that there is something 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.440
 parts that you see some lines in the 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.240
 sky and these lines affect a bit to 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.650
 the gameplay since suddenly you 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.960
 you fly and suddenly when you go through 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.180
 those lines what happens is something strange 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:26.490
 here as we see it in part the division 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:29.250
 of what the beach and the sea do 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:31.140
 what the tsunami is doing not like 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.030
 come is one of the best modes I 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.860
 loved how it looks in fact this is already 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.840
 I knew a lot in console but I think 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.340
 that looks pretty good here we went to 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.010
 another clip in which we are 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.840
 right in the city of saints more or 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:46.110
 less for the center and we are 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:48.090
 with what the submarine is doing as 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.650
 they see it looks extremely brutal from 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.420
 done I put the submarine with me 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.010
 motorcycle menu and the truth that is one thing 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.810
 that I loved and I told you that for 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.940
 those who want to download it are the 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.890
 I will put in the description there is more or 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.900
 least read the instructions and that's how 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.640
 how they are installed or how they see it is 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.130
 perfect we are I think it is one of 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.350
 my favorite ones and another one that I also saw from 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:09.960
 mods in what is being the page is the 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:12.090
 mod to have the map completely dry 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:14.550
 ie those reverse this not 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.830
 because in this there is a hand what I know 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:19.110
 there is an exaggeration of water that is 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:20.880
 water in addition and in the other the map 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:23.940
 totally dry I also saw that 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:26.220
 there is one to one part more in this way 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:28.710
 in which to remove the pedophilia is that 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:30.120
 more than anything, pedestrians would not be 

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:31.830
 It looks pretty good but I like it 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.690
 much to see them for pedestrians as they are 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:35.370
 suddenly swimming the cars with that 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.770
 something strange happens and the truth that remains 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.390
 pretty well do not take several clips that to 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:41.040
 I loved them too I took a clip in 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:42.660
 which will see our character is 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.670
 a marine animal and the truth that remains 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:46.620
 perfect I think that the people who 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:48.930
 I really like the modifications this 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.940
 It is very worthwhile here as they see it 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.620
 grab I appear and now what I'm going to 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:54.420
 will be practically put 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.340
 some vehicle in fact something that 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.739
 It caught a lot of attention in this way is 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:00.360
 more than anything how are you swimming between 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:02.520
 the vehicles and you can climb the roof 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:04.470
 and on the roof is also absolutely 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:06.989
 all full of water and if you put a 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:09.360
 boat what's going to happen is that you're going to go 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:11.370
 above the buildings and little thing 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.200
 stranger the only bad thing that right now 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:15.090
 can have this mode is this that can 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.519
 be appearing on screen like that 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:20.040
 there are some lines and those lines is all 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:22.079
 a gigantic surface of water in the 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:24.360
 which is going through we will pass 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:26.100
 like a huge wave and see what is left 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.780
 pretty good here as they see it 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:30.180
 we found on top of a building and 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:32.130
 as the waves arrive our boat 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.020
 is progressing and I do not know how 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:36.030
 pretty as you see all this the truth 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:37.680
 which is like a natural disaster other 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:40.080
 amount and love what they did is the 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.910
 of an earthquake would not be epic enough 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:44.010
 there to see the city all destroyed and more 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:45.660
 that nothing to see how it would not be the truth 

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:47.670
 It would be pretty good since the mods 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:50.010
 are allowing so many things not 

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:51.960
 even more than anything, maybe it's not a 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:53.520
 earthquake more than anything that is like the 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:55.040
 destroyed city and the truth that I've 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.630
 seen in the mods that are coming out 

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:59.730
 right now, the truth is that 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:01.170
 perfect and I think this is one of 

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:03.480
 my favorite has not put that the 

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:05.310
 city ​​is enough as a natural disaster and 

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:07.410
 all the people are suffering below the 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:09.120
 I do not think that if you add the 

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:12.060
 things in this way would be brutal 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:13.680
 what do I know that they were made 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:15.510
 waves will not cross the ground because the 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:17.040
 truth is that it does look weird 

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:18.660
 but I have seen that little by little they have gone 

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:21.180
 improving this mode here as you see it 

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:22.710
 choco and I go to what I do 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:24.660
 below the water it will not make it 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:27.000
 pretty good and I think it's pretty 

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:29.070
 good also something to those who are going to 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.200
 put or something that I recommend with this 

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:32.969
 mod is that they put the weather in extra 

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:34.049
 sunny since seeing in the night 

00:05:32.969 --> 00:05:35.909
 It becomes a pretty task 

00:05:34.049 --> 00:05:37.559
 difficult not here as they see us 

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:39.809
 we direct to the bottom of the 

00:05:37.559 --> 00:05:41.429
 city ​​more than anything the flooded part and 

00:05:39.809 --> 00:05:42.689
 you can see that all of a sudden the cars are going 

00:05:41.429 --> 00:05:44.999
 ok but as we go 

00:05:42.689 --> 00:05:46.589
 approaching and are loading the textures what 

00:05:44.999 --> 00:05:48.389
 what's going to happen is like the cars 

00:05:46.589 --> 00:05:50.219
 they are going to take off the truth that is 

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:53.129
 pretty good the truth is that it's pretty 

00:05:50.219 --> 00:05:55.169
 realistic more than anything like simulating a no 

00:05:53.129 --> 00:05:56.969
 be a natural disaster that makes it 

00:05:55.169 --> 00:05:58.559
 quite fun can not also 

00:05:56.969 --> 00:06:00.360
 put the first person overly 

00:05:58.559 --> 00:06:01.529
 this brutal can fight there under the 

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:03.329
 water and the truth is that it is quite 

00:06:01.529 --> 00:06:05.099
 good as they see it suddenly we are going to 

00:06:03.329 --> 00:06:06.929
 come some waves which are going to 

00:06:05.099 --> 00:06:08.999
 knock down and they will allow us to do 

00:06:06.929 --> 00:06:10.709
 many more things here as I see it 

00:06:08.999 --> 00:06:13.439
 I was with maikel but I also know 

00:06:10.709 --> 00:06:15.539
 they have to put I do not know if I did the same thing 

00:06:13.439 --> 00:06:17.339
 that is pretty good is to put some 

00:06:15.539 --> 00:06:19.349
 marine animal or mostly get to 

00:06:17.339 --> 00:06:21.269
 the boat there are some parts of the map 

00:06:19.349 --> 00:06:24.239
 how could we highlight what's going 

00:06:21.269 --> 00:06:26.189
 doing is covering the desert and what 

00:06:24.239 --> 00:06:28.110
 I do not like much of that area is like 

00:06:26.189 --> 00:06:30.119
 that the tsunami is missing it would not be 

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:33.389
 a pretty epic beach and in fact 

00:06:30.119 --> 00:06:35.009
 I plan to bring you some more videos than 

00:06:33.389 --> 00:06:36.569
 that doing the tsunami but in another 

00:06:35.009 --> 00:06:38.279
 part of the saints since if they were 

00:06:36.569 --> 00:06:40.289
 I bring everything in one becomes quite 

00:06:38.279 --> 00:06:41.610
 long and I want to teach them something with 

00:06:40.289 --> 00:06:43.680
 and not here as they can be 

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:45.270
 appreciating I imposed a dolphin and I 

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:47.279
 quite like since the dolphin for 

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:49.229
 swimming is pretty fast but I think 

00:06:47.279 --> 00:06:51.119
 that something that the dolphin needs is 

00:06:49.229 --> 00:06:53.159
 give your giant jumps not like 

00:06:51.119 --> 00:06:54.629
 lean out what the part is doing 

00:06:53.159 --> 00:06:56.369
 from above help some goal hand the 

00:06:54.629 --> 00:06:58.529
 true that would be pretty good not 

00:06:56.369 --> 00:07:00.389
 since they added more elections 

00:06:58.529 --> 00:07:01.979
 here as they see us we were 

00:07:00.389 --> 00:07:03.210
 here I wanted to take a leap out of the 

00:07:01.979 --> 00:07:04.649
 water but the bad thing is that I do not know 

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:06.659
 allowed but the truth that equal 

00:07:04.649 --> 00:07:08.939
 way is pretty good so like what 

00:07:06.659 --> 00:07:10.830
 come I could tell you that this is the 

00:07:08.939 --> 00:07:12.839
 better way since from above you can see 

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:14.819
 pretty epic if you're driving with a 

00:07:12.839 --> 00:07:16.619
 helicopter but the only bad thing is that if 

00:07:14.819 --> 00:07:18.719
 you go through any of those lines that are 

00:07:16.619 --> 00:07:20.339
 like from oceana what is going to happen is like 

00:07:18.719 --> 00:07:22.649
 the helicopter is you'll pay 

00:07:20.339 --> 00:07:24.659
 no one as seen here we are in 

00:07:22.649 --> 00:07:26.430
 what is being the airport of the 

00:07:24.659 --> 00:07:28.559
 saints and as you can see you are 

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:30.869
 completely flooded something that is 

00:07:28.559 --> 00:07:33.270
 quite curious and quite funny is 

00:07:30.869 --> 00:07:34.770
 that suddenly the planes arrive and 

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:37.259
 they park and it is not seen is something extremely 

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:39.509
 strange and also at the same time it's something 

00:07:37.259 --> 00:07:41.069
 weird, but as they see it, it's a few clicks 

00:07:39.509 --> 00:07:42.869
 very good that I liked this 

00:07:41.069 --> 00:07:44.430
 gameplay so guys I hope there will be 

00:07:42.869 --> 00:07:46.830
 liked here as you see them I put a 

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:49.800
 clip that I throw from the top 

00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:51.780
 the saints until what the 

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:53.910
 bottom not evil is what 

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:55.890
 is doing the submarine is destroyed 

00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:57.960
 and you may notice that it burns me 

00:07:55.890 --> 00:07:59.190
 the fall does not but in the same way is a 

00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:00.870
 pretty good way so kids 

00:07:59.190 --> 00:08:02.430
 tell me your opinion in the comments the 

00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:04.170
 person who wants to download it 

00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:05.490
 I leave in the description I hope you have 

00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:08.150
 like this video do not forget to leave your 

00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:11.150
