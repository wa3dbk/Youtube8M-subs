00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.399 
the wrong class who was extremely
terrible<00:01:38.790> also<00:01:39.479> down<00:01:39.630> here<00:01:39.810> you<00:01:39.900> have<00:01:39.930> great

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409

stuff<00:01:40.680> a<00:01:42.020> telemetry<00:01:43.020> that<00:01:44.000> allows<00:01:45.000> you<00:01:45.240> to

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
stuff a telemetry that allows you to

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.289
