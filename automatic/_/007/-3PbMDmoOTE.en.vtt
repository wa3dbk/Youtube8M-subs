00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.270
Hello. I'm Masakazu Tachibana, a flutist in Japan.

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:12.400
I'm going to show you the tips to trill.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.800
For example, a trill starting with G goes like G-A-G-A-G-A...

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:23.200

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:30.230
Practice this in two different rhythms.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.060
In the first one the trill finger will leave the key

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:49.700
as quickly as possible.

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:06.260
In another one the trill finger touches the key

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.160
for as short time as possible.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.720
Combination of these two patterns ...

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.330
enables you to play a fast trill.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:36.530
Feel the spring of the key when your finger leaves it.

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:43.159
And use only the waight of the finger to press the key.

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:48.369
Just relax very well to start trill.

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:50.800
One important point.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:01.200
When you move to the next note after a trill, be sure to end with the original note of the trill.

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.200
Do as the same when there is an after note.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:41.800
You can move to the next note smoothly doing this.

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.590
We have many alternative fingering for trilling.

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.800
I'll talk about that in another lesson.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:53.800
See you in the next lesson!

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.800
