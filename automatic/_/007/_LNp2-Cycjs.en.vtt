00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.450
 well that of friends I hope you 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:12.129
 go well we end up for a 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:13.330
 new cammas trick on dofus so 

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:14.490
 today we are going to make boots 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:17.230
 royal mouthe 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.529
 the price is relatively interesting his 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:22.660
 name on my server so I take this opportunity 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:26.019
 so so I took 100 million as 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:29.890
 it's easier to calculate the 

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:33.570
 investment prices I could not get there 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:35.530
 so royal wool mouthe 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.560
 here we are going to look at the recipes 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:41.470
 associated to have it here my friend 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:45.220
 royal word so a royal q2 muttsee skin 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:48.280
 kabylie croco to 2 and of due me rent 5 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:53.190
 clavicle the beauf mouthe oil n 2 of 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:55.840
 royal smooth cobweb 38 horns 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:59.280
 standing war foot and 44 wool 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:05.310
 food road we will make ten caraman 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:05.310
 so wool 500 needs 80 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:26.110
 she still 20 there the price has not 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:33.200
 increased that we needed 440 to 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:38.000
 then we have to say that the 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:39.229
 asses so here say it's the same 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.860
 it costs nothing at all we will buy them 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:44.600
 to the unit it seems to me cheaper 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:49.909
 normally we will make a profit there 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:55.909
 above go again 3 or to the super 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:57.259
 so then and of me rents reacted 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:00.020
 directly type melloussa is no longer 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:03.530
 simple so that's a little expensive there I 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:06.619
 you admits average price 10000 they are at 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.119
 20 thousand case units I believe he's us 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:11.830
 needed 20 in total I still 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:13.880
 recheck yes that's it not before 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:23.750
 a bad luck we buy it 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:32.510
 Here munched Bulliat skin 60 that it costs 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:35.090
 really nothing at all then 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.100
 horns I think we needed 380 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:42.819
 play anyway re check one last 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:42.819
 times for the a380 and collarbone 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:51.639
 clavicle we started with that 50 is 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:54.430
 threw meaning okay leaving 2004 

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:57.590
 then horns 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:03:02.840
 so that 380 it costs nothing at all 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:06.100
 event we are going to finish buying 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.100
 in batches of 10 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.900
 So here we go and buy them 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.510
 20 guys the smokers we'll take the 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:20.730
 zap 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:20.730
 so I think it's less 13 - 28 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:31.050
 that's good it's learned to have 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:39.970
 calculated the price of the investment 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:46.000
 so smoked they are a little bit expensive 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:48.190
 but that's good then everything was 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.080
 invested we will be simple we will take 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:52.180
 the 100 million base I had at 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.620
 beginning of the video no age and that 10 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.660
 million 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.690
 there I have the 100 million we're going 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:03.100
 subtract what we have left so 98 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:05.800
 million eight hundred 400 years old and that we 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:07.180
 makes the 1 million we will rebound in 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:10.660
 big if rarely a million 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:14.320
 investment we will make them 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:15.940
 all so good so you have of course he 

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:20.380
 you need the job of shoemaker level 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:22.000
 without me I am but after you 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.130
 can always find artisans 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:29.820
 free if they are in your alliance 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:32.820
 or in your guild with or leather 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.820
 boots 

00:04:35.849 --> 00:04:40.830
 then after if you do 10 even if 

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:42.899
 you find a paid craftsman he can 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:44.219
 you make a sweaty price often on 

00:04:42.899 --> 00:04:47.189
 on boots when you're doing 

00:04:44.219 --> 00:04:51.209
 lots they make you prizes to me in 

00:04:47.189 --> 00:04:53.669
 anyway that's what I'm doing so here we go 

00:04:51.209 --> 00:04:56.159
 go we'll raptors and go to 

00:04:53.669 --> 00:05:01.110
 the resale just let's go to 

00:04:56.159 --> 00:05:03.529
 sell alone I had it 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:03.529
 shoemakers 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:18.479
 so we'll see them prices have no 

00:05:12.959 --> 00:05:20.849
 doubt then the prize win becomes I 

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:22.050
 you do not hide it just now when I 

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:25.619
 looked at the prices we saw one to three 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:27.779
 a hundred thousand to do well the parties so 

00:05:25.619 --> 00:05:30.689
 how am I going to make a game put the 

00:05:27.779 --> 00:05:34.619
 best I think about 450 miles and the 

00:05:30.689 --> 00:05:37.019
 others I put them the a380 19000 I 

00:05:34.619 --> 00:05:40.589
 think we'll do like that 

00:05:37.019 --> 00:05:44.509
 will do like that so it seems to me 

00:05:40.589 --> 00:05:44.509
 a good g and we will put it to 450000 

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:58.550
 this one means this one it is 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:58.550
 along this one good g 

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:06.840
 we'll put this one too and the 

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:15.010
 others we will put them 400 miles 

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:22.020
 here we go, calculation is fast 

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:25.960
 did so we put four to 450 miles 

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:30.040
 what makes us 01/01/2008 so yes 

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:35.050
 that's it and we put six to 

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:36.580
 four hundred thousand have higher this is 

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:40.560
 that's also 400 million what 

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:40.560
 makes us 2nd 4 if I'm wrong 

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:48.100
 so that's what makes us 420 

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:51.370
 miles on the resale for a million 

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:53.590
 investment so I think 

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:55.900
 that today the boots are going to leave 

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:58.330
 well not everything of course but I 

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:59.260
 think that by tomorrow after tomorrow I 

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:00.970
 think I would lower the prices because 

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:02.770
 that there will be other people who 

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:04.750
 will have dropped the prices at least I the 

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:05.890
 think one often it's like that 

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:08.050
 I often do this trick 

00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:10.780
 kama when prices go back jean fine 

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:12.130
 ten is often two days one or 

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:15.310
 two days after that I'm going down 

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:17.200
 price but hey we'll be like big 

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:19.210
 kisses big profits by 96th 

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:20.830
 even if I lower the prices tomorrow or 

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:22.390
 after tomorrow 

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:25.000
 so that's in any case 4 million 2.2 to 

00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:27.880
 resale for a million two that we 

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.870
 makes 3 million profits on debate 

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:31.090
 so it's really huge 

00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:32.470
 in any case I hope this video 

00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:35.800
 you will be pleased do not hesitate to put a 

00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:39.780
 little I like to video is pretty no I 

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:39.780
 tell you to the next hi to all
