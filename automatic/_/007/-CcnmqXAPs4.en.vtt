00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:14.300
 now let's all here ripped a 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.160
 new video and we're in the next 

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:19.100
 plan against the clan and we are X against 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:22.930
 raul as you see me essential with 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.930
 traffic set and creative 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:31.869
 ad 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.270
 in the 1400 laps 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:56.050
 and this we have to make a wall 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:58.800
 modern warfare 410 and that you talk about that 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:58.800
 it went to the sense 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:10.310
 and that is that we carry the connection 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:10.310
 be blatter that's why 

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:21.259
 no, not for anything better, we go to 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.479
 next spot that is in thousand 440 of 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:26.530
 carry and until now we are following 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:26.530
 per thousand 449 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.440
 the kid if he owed it the first try 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.260
 the first attempt the video lasts two 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.690
 minutes 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:41.690
 but even if we win 2 0 to 0 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.830
 so 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:51.240
 me that the school 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:53.659
 soon 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.659
 3 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:05.040
 I'm marking myself makes it sad is that I do not 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.040
 I do lately it's never 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.640
 I order infinities to not 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:19.960
 to a maximum of 1 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:28.750
 and me 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:34.629
 one 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.629
 arrives 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:44.480
 In return 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:46.720
 that changes from which dish changes the 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.720
 lifetime 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.910
 and that bullet 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.670
 to turn 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:08.750
 to my mother 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.670
 and now I 'm not doing infiniti 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:20.910
 the infinity of rpg in the air habit 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.910
 easy 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:31.470
 but is that now you look at the clicks is 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.000
 that lately they are not going to be left over 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.990
 nothing 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.990
 or 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.680
 Well then we won but 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.689
 well let's do windows 7 while 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:49.150
 so that to see a little more the video and 

00:03:46.689 --> 00:03:51.010
 So far we are going to next 2080 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:54.599
 e-mail down was impression has gotten us 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:54.599
 and does not want to play 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:58.530
 for the big ones 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.060
 people 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:09.530
 7 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:18.250
 if we stick here the word 

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:18.250
 do it in something blue 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.860
 infiniti and I do not do it because 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.480
 then you complain that it 's time to 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:34.160
 Finalize 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:34.160
 the truth I 

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:42.540
 it's like when inside the custom 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:46.590
 of the envelope 

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:50.270
 90 min no but that was at the beginning it was 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:50.270
 that and doubles 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:53.900
 calls 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:03.410
 that is, if it is eternal what is going 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:06.490
 I knew I thought it would be cool 

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:06.490
 I thought that was good 

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:20.980
 and well you know more than him I have a 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:20.980
 1080p 1080i tutorial 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:26.960
 taught to do that duty so much 

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:30.650
 -presidency works 

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:41.710
 but I hope you liked it to see if 

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:44.550
 we got 300 likes as I always say and 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:44.550
 dismiss all 

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:52.110
 bullying
