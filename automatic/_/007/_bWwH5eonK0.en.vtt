 Red enchiladas are all easy to 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:26.859
 In addition, it is one of the most 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:27.699
 popular in Mexico and in the states 

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:29.529
 United 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:31.179
 the preparation is approximately 20 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:33.490
 minutes and the cooking time is 

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:34.360
 also approximately between 15 to 20 

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:35.980
 minutes 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.150
 I hope this recipe is extra grade 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:41.860
 let us begin 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:45.130
 The ingredients for this recipe are 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:48.190
 10 wide chiles 5 or 6 chiles guajillo 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:50.050
 If you live in the USA you will find these 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.850
 chiles in walmart or in any other 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:54.130
 supermarket where they have a hall 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.680
 for international products too 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:59.860
 we need 2 tomatoes a quarter of a 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:02.960
 small onion one clove of garlic 2 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:05.479
 chicken breasts corn tortillas 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.390
 and to decorate I'm using fresh cheese 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:10.180
 and liquid cream 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.740
 half onion cut into slices and 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.620
 as a seasoning I'm just 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:17.080
 using a pinch of ground cinnamon and 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:19.409
 salt to taste we also need three 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:22.409
 cups of boiling water and vegetable oil 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.409
 let us begin 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.580
 Let's boil the chicken until it's 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.250
 well cooked seasoning the water to boil it 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:33.290
 with enough salt a clove of garlic and a 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.660
 trickle of oil since the chicken is 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:38.120
 cooked they let it cool a bit and what 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:41.330
 crumble and save it until they're 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:43.790
 ready to use it now in a pan 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:46.580
 large or on a comal let's toast the 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:49.010
 dried chiles for 5 seconds on each side 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:51.140
 Be careful not to burn them because if 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:53.360
 they burn the sauce will have a very 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:57.300
 bitter so we 're just going to scare them 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:02:00.030
 for a couple of seconds on each side 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.130
 in the same pan or comal add a 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:05.340
 little bit of oil and now we're going to toast 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.320
 the tomatoes the onion and the garlic lower the 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.300
 fire a little to prevent burning 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.630
 the garlic because if the garlic is burned too 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.280
 it will give a very bitter taste to the sauce 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.410
 let's toast these ingredients for 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.360
 about 2 minutes or until the tomatoes and 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.180
 the onion have put a little more 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.800
 soft while they are cooking now 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.530
 let's remove the tails and the 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.240
 seeds to chilies can be split 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.520
 in half and it will be easier 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:31.500
 remove the seeds from them 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.620
 ready they 're going to put them in a bowl 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.620
 big 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.010
 since the tomato the onion and the garlic 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.810
 they are golden now we are going to empty them 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.930
 to the same bowl with the dried chiles 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:46.000
 about these ingredients now empty in 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.190
 approximately 3 cups of water 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.260
 boiling and let the peppers 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:53.769
 soak in the hot water for about 10 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:55.480
 or 15 minutes after 15 minutes now 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:57.879
 let's grind the ingredients for the 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.920
 sauce empty the ingredients in a 

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:02.920
 blender season with a pinch of cinnamon 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:05.410
 ground and salt to taste and grind 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.360
 high speed for 5 minutes or until 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.519
 everything is well incorporated and well ground 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:12.220
 you can add a little more water if you 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:14.680
 they think they need to smell the sauce and 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.989
 let it boil add a little more 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.480
 water if you believe it is necessary and also 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:21.819
 add a splash of vegetable oil 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:24.160
 stir well taste the seasoning and add 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:25.629
 more salt if what is necessary the sauce 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.250
 for enchiladas should not be left 

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:29.410
 very watery because if it's too much 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.150
 liquid the tortillas will not absorb it 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:33.819
 so be careful not to add 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.790
 too much water let the sauce boil 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:37.620
 at medium low heat 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.480
 while the sauce boils we go to 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.189
 heat the tortillas I like 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.890
 heat the tortillas in a bit of 

00:03:41.189 --> 00:03:46.200
 Oil the oil to brown a little and 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:48.359
 will give them a little more texture so that 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.489
 do not fall apart or break at the time 

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:52.319
 to soak them in the sauce but if 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:55.480
 you prefer they can heat 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:57.400
 in a comal or in the microwave 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.560
 since all the ingredients are 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:02.290
 ready now if you can start doing 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.480
 your enchiladas take an omelet 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:05.980
 Soak in red sauce and then 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.530
 add a little chicken on the 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:11.170
 tortilla wrap it like it was a 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.610
 taquito and that's all keep repeating 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:15.340
 these steps until all the 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:16.810
 Enchiladas are ready because all the 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:18.729
 enchiladas are ready 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:21.579
 now they can be placed in a mold or 

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:23.770
 dish bathe them with a bit of the sauce 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:26.139
 red decorate them with slices of 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:28.210
 onion and now you can put them on a 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:31.300
 180 degree preheated oven 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:33.190
 centigrade for about 8 or 10 minutes or 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:34.930
 until they are very hot or if 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:37.720
 prefer they can heat up in the 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:40.389
 microwave for about two or three minutes or 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:42.039
 until they are hot but to me 

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:44.199
 like to make enchiladas like in the 

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:46.389
 old times like my grandmother did 

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:48.610
 since they have the enchiladas ready 

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:51.190
 now we are going to brown them in a little 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:52.900
 oil the oil just so it does not 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:55.660
 stick to the pan so you do not have to 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:58.360
 add too much oil to the pan this 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:00.340
 step is optional, you can omit it if 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:02.350
 they like but this step will give them a taste 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:04.030
 more intense to the enchiladas 

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:06.310
 as soon as the enchiladas touch in 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:08.170
 the hot pan will be able to enjoy the 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:10.420
 rich smell of red sauce 

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:12.820
 this step is for the tortillas 

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:14.800
 really absorb and find all the 

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:16.750
 flavor of chili so you have a 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:19.009
 A little bit longer I recommend that you 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:21.020
 follow this step 

00:05:19.009 --> 00:05:23.599
 since they have browned all the enchiladas 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:26.479
 a little bit now if you put them on the tray 

00:05:23.599 --> 00:05:28.879
 or dish to bake the whales with the 

00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:31.399
 red sauce decorate with slices of 

00:05:28.879 --> 00:05:34.729
 onion and bake for 8 or 10 minutes 

00:05:31.399 --> 00:05:37.159
 in a preheated oven at 180 degrees 

00:05:34.729 --> 00:05:38.869
 centigrade or if you prefer they warm up 

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:41.029
 microwave them for two or three 

00:05:38.869 --> 00:05:43.789
 minutes or until they are hot 

00:05:41.029 --> 00:05:46.160
 As they come out of the oven decorate them with 

00:05:43.789 --> 00:05:48.800
 some fresh cheese 

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:52.010
 and when serving them add a little more 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:54.170
 cheese and liquid cream and that's all good 

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:56.690
