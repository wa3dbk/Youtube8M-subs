I<00:00:41.670> definitely<00:00:42.120> want<00:00:42.239> her<00:00:42.300> to<00:00:42.390> eat<00:00:42.570> she<00:00:42.930> likes

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.770 
I definitely want her to eat she likes
bread<00:00:43.469> and<00:00:43.739> cheese<00:00:44.399> so<00:00:44.910> those<00:00:45.300> are<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.600> two

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
bread and cheese so those are the two

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.389 
bread and cheese so those are the two
things<00:00:46.110> that<00:00:46.320> I<00:00:46.379> know<00:00:46.410> she'll<00:00:46.800> definitely<00:00:46.980> eat

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
things that I know she'll definitely eat

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.729 
things that I know she'll definitely eat
but<00:00:48.239> I<00:00:48.600> can't<00:00:48.989> always<00:00:49.170> feed<00:00:49.440> my<00:00:49.559> daughter

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
but I can't always feed my daughter

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.880 
but I can't always feed my daughter
bread<00:00:50.309> and<00:00:50.520> cheese<00:00:50.670> so<00:00:51.170> basically<00:00:52.170> I<00:00:52.199> just

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
bread and cheese so basically I just

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.590 
bread and cheese so basically I just
feed<00:00:53.250> her<00:00:53.430> whatever<00:00:53.670> we're<00:00:54.000> eating<00:00:54.390> for

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
feed her whatever we're eating for

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.830 
feed her whatever we're eating for
dinner<00:00:54.840> and<00:00:55.489> if<00:00:56.489> she<00:00:56.730> eats<00:00:56.910> it<00:00:57.120> she<00:00:57.270> eats<00:00:57.449> it<00:00:57.660> if

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
dinner and if she eats it she eats it if

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.200 
dinner and if she eats it she eats it if
she<00:00:57.960> doesn't<00:00:58.350> she<00:00:58.469> doesn't<00:00:58.500> and<00:00:59.210> basically

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
she doesn't she doesn't and basically

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.849 
she doesn't she doesn't and basically
what<00:01:00.600> we<00:01:00.690> have<00:01:00.840> for<00:01:01.050> dinner<00:01:01.199> is<00:01:01.440> usually<00:01:01.829> a

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
what we have for dinner is usually a

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
meat a starch and a veggie and some days

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.880

she<00:01:06.360> likes<00:01:06.570> certain<00:01:06.810> veggies<00:01:07.320> other<00:01:07.619> days<00:01:07.860> she

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
she likes certain veggies other days she

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.859 
she likes certain veggies other days she
doesn't<00:01:08.520> and<00:01:08.760> I'll<00:01:08.939> cook<00:01:09.150> it<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.390> same<00:01:09.540> exact

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.929 
doesn't and I'll cook it the same exact
way<00:01:10.020> and<00:01:10.409> then<00:01:10.590> she<00:01:10.799> likes<00:01:10.979> it<00:01:11.159> again<00:01:11.369> so<00:01:11.700> I

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
way and then she likes it again so I

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.090 
way and then she likes it again so I
just<00:01:12.270> go<00:01:12.659> ahead<00:01:12.750> and<00:01:13.110> continue<00:01:13.590> to<00:01:13.710> feed<00:01:13.890> her

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
just go ahead and continue to feed her

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.950 
just go ahead and continue to feed her
things<00:01:14.369> even<00:01:14.820> if<00:01:14.909> I<00:01:15.030> know<00:01:15.090> that<00:01:15.420> she<00:01:15.600> might<00:01:15.780> not

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
things even if I know that she might not

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.289 
things even if I know that she might not
like<00:01:16.229> it<00:01:16.470> because<00:01:17.220> she<00:01:17.700> might<00:01:17.850> like<00:01:18.030> it<00:01:18.150> that

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
like it because she might like it that

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.539 
like it because she might like it that
day<00:01:18.479> also<00:01:19.100> you're<00:01:20.100> gonna<00:01:20.189> notice<00:01:20.520> that

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
day also you're gonna notice that

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.510 
day also you're gonna notice that
there's<00:01:20.820> not<00:01:21.000> many<00:01:21.360> meals<00:01:21.780> in<00:01:22.140> this<00:01:22.380> video<00:01:22.799> but

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
there's not many meals in this video but

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.460 
there's not many meals in this video but
it's<00:01:23.939> because<00:01:24.299> we<00:01:24.540> tend<00:01:24.869> to<00:01:24.960> eat<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.290> same

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
it's because we tend to eat the same

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.499 
it's because we tend to eat the same
things<00:01:25.740> besides<00:01:26.220> dinner<00:01:26.549> we<00:01:26.850> just<00:01:27.090> feed<00:01:27.270> Jane

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509

things besides dinner we just feed Jane
whatever<00:01:27.810> we're<00:01:27.960> eating<00:01:28.229> but<00:01:28.439> for<00:01:28.650> breakfast

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
whatever we're eating but for breakfast

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.890 
whatever we're eating but for breakfast
we<00:01:29.430> only<00:01:29.610> really<00:01:29.880> have<00:01:30.180> like<00:01:30.509> three<00:01:30.780> or<00:01:30.869> four

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
four staples that we always eat and we

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.969 
four staples that we always eat and we
try<00:01:36.299> to<00:01:36.360> stay<00:01:36.600> healthy<00:01:36.650> obviously<00:01:37.650> because

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
try to stay healthy obviously because

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.429 
try to stay healthy obviously because
when<00:01:38.280> we<00:01:38.430> go<00:01:38.610> out<00:01:38.880> and<00:01:39.119> we<00:01:39.210> eat<00:01:39.450> out<00:01:39.659> usually

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
when we go out and we eat out usually

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.710 
when we go out and we eat out usually
kids<00:01:41.250> meals<00:01:41.490> tend<00:01:41.939> to<00:01:42.119> be<00:01:42.240> a<00:01:42.270> little<00:01:42.540> bit

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
kids meals tend to be a little bit

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.539 
kids meals tend to be a little bit
unhealthy<00:01:43.079> so<00:01:43.530> we<00:01:43.710> try<00:01:43.920> to<00:01:43.979> feed<00:01:44.220> her<00:01:44.340> as

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
unhealthy so we try to feed her as

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.039 
unhealthy so we try to feed her as
healthy<00:01:44.850> as<00:01:44.939> we<00:01:45.060> can<00:01:45.240> while<00:01:45.420> we're<00:01:45.600> here<00:01:45.840> at

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.800 
healthy as we can while we're here at
home<00:01:46.290> so<00:01:46.320> I<00:01:46.920> hope<00:01:47.520> you<00:01:47.640> guys<00:01:47.790> get<00:01:48.090> some<00:01:48.329> ideas
