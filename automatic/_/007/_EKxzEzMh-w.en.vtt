00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 good first what we are going to 

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:06.710
 need is a rule and scissors shirt and 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:11.150
 what I'm going to do first is 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:11.150
 cut the neck part 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:19.190
 and I had already done this project 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:21.619
 it's only been a long time since I did it 

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:24.140
 at night and it did not look very good but what 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:27.619
 what I did to re - record to be seen 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:31.369
 rather and what will be second mind 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:34.760
 is to put my shirt in this way and 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:37.969
 I will put a ruler on top 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:42.170
 and the rule will guide us in the form of 

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:44.809
 the shirt to cut the pieces and what 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.860
 what he's going to do is cut each piece 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:49.830
 can be 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:53.180
 any size that you want everything 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:53.180
 be of the same year 

00:00:53.740 --> 00:01:01.140
 and then in the end what I'm going to do is 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:04.990
 Take my shirt and I'll give it back 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:09.310
 well so that you see the way that what 

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:12.370
 we did like in triangle and this step is 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:16.420
 just stretch the pieces to give you more 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:18.580
 way and these steps of how to knit by hand 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:21.370
 I 'm going to show you in this video 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:25.660
 but I'm going to repeat the first thing that 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:28.470
 I did is to welcome the first piece and the 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:32.110
 second and put the second under the 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:35.619
 first and then I put the third one under 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:37.630
 of the second and successively you see a lot 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:39.150
 man in the video I think that I 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.170
 I explained 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.200
 and then 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:47.619
 continue weaving down and at the end 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:52.180
 what I did is cut the piece of 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:54.930
 last iu and then tie it to the pieces 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.930
 exterior 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:05.270
 and now what he's going to do is weave the 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:08.360
 same way what I'm going to do one 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:12.300
 again and you can do it once 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:14.370
 or twice or how many people want 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.820
 and I 'm going to do it twice in this 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.820
 shirt 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.280
 now for this other design what are we going 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:28.200
 to need is ' the one shirt and scissors 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.379
 not a rule 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:34.530
 and what I'm going to do is equal to doing 

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:36.950
 same as in the beginning is to cut the 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.950
 part of the neck 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:43.550
 and then what I'm going to do is give it 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:47.349
 back in the back and what I'm going 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:51.440
 to do is cut in that way so in 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:54.040
 diagonal shape and what you are going to do is 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.040
 cut 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:03:00.610
 from one side to the other as they look 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.610
 in the video 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:12.180
 I've seen a poodle video that is a 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:16.090
 video that a guy makes him in a shirt 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:18.940
 a head like that on a girl but it does 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:21.130
 in herself and she was super 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:24.550
 awesome that video when homes 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:27.430
 I took a little bit of the idea of â€‹â€‹doing 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:29.860
 this only that I do not know has a 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:33.010
 I'm doing it 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:35.310
 well only and in the end what I am 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:39.700
 doing is cutting the plastic part 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:43.220
 and then I'm going to do 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:46.310
 I'm going to knit by hand again and what I 'm going 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:50.920
 to do this time is the same technique that 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:54.799
 is to take this part of the second 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:58.190
 and then put it for the first and 

00:03:54.799 --> 00:04:02.750
 then take the third piece and 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:06.920
 put it below the second piece and 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:09.079
 so on it 's a bit difficult 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:11.650
 to explain it but when they see it is 

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:11.650
 very easy 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:19.280
 I have practiced many forms like this 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:22.789
 It is extremely easy to do it already when 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:25.930
 you know what you do super fast and what I'm going 

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:30.729
 to do is and in the end is to cut it and 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:30.729
 tie it to the exterior as you see 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:35.630
 and now with this shirt what is going to 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:38.360
 to do is a little different and what I'm going 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:41.180
 to do is on the sides as you see in this 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:45.440
 side and this side what I'm going to do is to 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:48.220
 do the same design that is 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:50.600
 what is knitting comma not on both sides 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:52.270
 then it's going to be three times that I'm going to 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:56.140
 to knit 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:58.830
 and a design that is being done is the same 

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:58.830
 on both sides 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:04.529
 this is going to give a very nice effect to 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:06.989
 the shirt 

00:05:04.529 --> 00:05:08.849
 I really loved it when I saw that 

00:05:06.989 --> 00:05:12.029
 video on youtube that a guy did 

00:05:08.849 --> 00:05:13.949
 well it was not exactly but something 

00:05:12.029 --> 00:05:17.339
 well he did he did to the girl in her 

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:19.699
 shirt and it was super super nice 

00:05:17.339 --> 00:05:19.699
 charm 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:30.530
 and so the shirt was left at the end is 

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:33.320
 show photos of how they look and now 

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:35.080
 what he's going to do is I'm doing another 

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:39.110
 shirt that is 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:41.480
 the same design that I did previously 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:43.640
 only this time I'll do I'll 

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:48.320
 weave four times instead of three as 

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:52.120
 I did it and as you can see, I made another shirt 

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:56.919
 it's also in the right hand as it looks 

00:05:52.120 --> 00:06:00.260
 I did that shirt a long time ago and it was 

00:05:56.919 --> 00:06:05.150
 the first attempt I made 

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:06.920
 and so the last one was the last shirt and 

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:09.160
 that was all girls and I hope that they 

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:09.160
 I liked it
