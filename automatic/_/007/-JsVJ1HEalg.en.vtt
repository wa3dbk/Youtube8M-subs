00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:48.339 
knew it doing a lot of spot dodges and
down<00:03:43.340> smash<00:03:46.120> back<00:03:47.120> to<00:03:47.209> center<00:03:47.420> stage<00:03:47.630> do

00:03:48.339 --> 00:03:48.349 
down smash back to center stage do

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:53.259 
down smash back to center stage do
better<00:03:49.160> down<00:03:49.340> smash<00:03:51.489> yeah<00:03:52.489> at<00:03:52.610> this<00:03:52.760> percent<00:03:53.120> I

00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:53.269 
better down smash yeah at this percent I

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:54.580 
better down smash yeah at this percent I
think<00:03:53.450> you'd<00:03:53.569> have<00:03:53.630> to<00:03:53.780> go<00:03:53.900> for<00:03:54.079> a<00:03:54.110> positional

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:54.590 
think you'd have to go for a positional

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:56.140 
think you'd have to go for a positional
advantage<00:03:54.680> throw<00:03:55.220> instead<00:03:55.670> of<00:03:55.700> down<00:03:55.940> throw

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 
advantage throw instead of down throw

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:57.520 
advantage throw instead of down throw
because<00:03:56.510> he's<00:03:56.630> not<00:03:56.750> gonna<00:03:56.870> get<00:03:57.049> any<00:03:57.200> follow-up

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
because he's not gonna get any follow-up

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:59.530 
because he's not gonna get any follow-up
to<00:03:57.590> anymore<00:03:57.769> yeah<00:03:58.579> it's<00:03:58.760> slightly<00:03:59.120> too<00:03:59.360> high

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
to anymore yeah it's slightly too high

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.020 
to anymore yeah it's slightly too high
for<00:03:59.780> Sage<00:03:59.959> up<00:04:00.470> throw<00:04:00.739> maybe<00:04:00.980> but<00:04:01.370> it's<00:04:01.790> like<00:04:01.910> an

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.030 
for Sage up throw maybe but it's like an

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:07.600 
for Sage up throw maybe but it's like an
o<00:04:02.170> takes<00:04:03.170> its<00:04:03.440> back
