hats<00:00:04.620> I'm<00:00:05.220> going<00:00:05.370> to<00:00:05.460> do<00:00:05.549> one<00:00:05.759> layer<00:00:06.000> with<00:00:06.330> you

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
hats I'm going to do one layer with you

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.259 
hats I'm going to do one layer with you
very<00:00:07.170> quickly<00:00:07.730> there<00:00:08.730> have<00:00:08.820> been<00:00:08.880> a<00:00:08.940> couple

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
very quickly there have been a couple

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:10.850 
very quickly there have been a couple
questions<00:00:09.389> about<00:00:09.660> this<00:00:09.960> but<00:00:10.170> I<00:00:10.349> think<00:00:10.679> it's

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
questions about this but I think it's

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.320 
questions about this but I think it's
one<00:00:11.040> of<00:00:11.130> those<00:00:11.219> techniques<00:00:11.670> when<00:00:11.849> you<00:00:11.940> see<00:00:12.210> it

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
one of those techniques when you see it

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.150 
one of those techniques when you see it
being<00:00:12.599> done<00:00:12.690> it's<00:00:13.200> it<00:00:13.559> makes<00:00:13.740> it<00:00:13.920> crystal

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
being done it's it makes it crystal

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.000 
being done it's it makes it crystal
clear<00:00:14.309> it's<00:00:14.610> like<00:00:14.700> an<00:00:14.969> aha<00:00:15.360> moment<00:00:15.410> so<00:00:16.410> the

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
clear it's like an aha moment so the

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.310 
clear it's like an aha moment so the
directions<00:00:17.609> I'm<00:00:17.820> using<00:00:18.060> are<00:00:18.449> on<00:00:18.539> page<00:00:18.690> 90<00:00:19.109> and

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
directions I'm using are on page 90 and

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.800 
directions I'm using are on page 90 and
91<00:00:19.619> if<00:00:19.890> you<00:00:19.980> want<00:00:20.160> to<00:00:20.220> check<00:00:20.369> it<00:00:20.490> out<00:00:20.779> okay

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
91 if you want to check it out okay

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.750 
91 if you want to check it out okay
here's<00:00:22.470> what<00:00:22.680> it<00:00:22.769> looks<00:00:22.920> like<00:00:23.189> this<00:00:23.460> is<00:00:23.609> the

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
here's what it looks like this is the

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.700 
here's what it looks like this is the
felted<00:00:24.359> flower<00:00:24.630> I<00:00:24.750> did<00:00:24.990> for<00:00:25.170> my<00:00:25.289> daughter's

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
book bag and a couple other just samples

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.669 
book bag and a couple other just samples
so<00:00:29.460> this<00:00:29.640> is<00:00:29.820> a<00:00:29.849> this<00:00:30.630> is<00:00:30.840> one<00:00:31.019> I<00:00:31.050> did<00:00:31.199> the<00:00:31.500> same

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
so this is a this is one I did the same

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.470 
so this is a this is one I did the same
technique<00:00:32.070> out<00:00:32.250> of<00:00:32.430> summer<00:00:32.880> tweet<00:00:33.180> which<00:00:33.329> I

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
technique out of summer tweet which I

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.020 
technique out of summer tweet which I
didn't<00:00:33.840> then<00:00:33.989> felt<00:00:34.350> but<00:00:34.820> just<00:00:35.820> so<00:00:35.910> you<00:00:35.969> see

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
didn't then felt but just so you see

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.490 
didn't then felt but just so you see
what<00:00:36.239> we're<00:00:36.360> doing<00:00:36.450> I'm<00:00:36.780> going<00:00:37.200> to<00:00:37.290> be<00:00:37.350> doing

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
what we're doing I'm going to be doing

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.619 
what we're doing I'm going to be doing
the<00:00:37.680> four<00:00:38.010> petal<00:00:39.050> layer<00:00:40.050> with<00:00:41.040> you<00:00:41.450> alright<00:00:42.450> so

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
the four petal layer with you alright so

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.660 
the four petal layer with you alright so
let's<00:00:42.840> get<00:00:42.960> started<00:00:43.379> after<00:00:44.219> that<00:00:44.460> long<00:00:44.640> intro

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670 
let's get started after that long intro

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.090 
let's get started after that long intro
so<00:00:47.670> I've<00:00:48.059> cast<00:00:48.329> on<00:00:48.480> 46<00:00:49.110> stitches<00:00:49.590> just<00:00:49.620> like<00:00:49.980> it

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
so I've cast on 46 stitches just like it

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.069 
so I've cast on 46 stitches just like it
says<00:00:50.280> in<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.460> book<00:00:50.730> I<00:00:50.969> knit<00:00:51.270> one<00:00:51.449> row<00:00:51.480> now<00:00:51.989> I'm

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
says in the book I knit one row now I'm

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.930 
says in the book I knit one row now I'm
going<00:00:52.379> for<00:00:52.649> row<00:00:52.800> two<00:00:53.129> and<00:00:53.160> this<00:00:53.460> is<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.789> row

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
going for row two and this is the row

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.689 
going for row two and this is the row
only<00:00:54.570> role<00:00:55.079> that's<00:00:55.260> complicated<00:00:56.190> in<00:00:56.309> any<00:00:56.460> way

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
only role that's complicated in any way

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.090 
only role that's complicated in any way
for<00:00:57.629> this<00:00:57.870> technique<00:00:58.469> so<00:00:58.739> what<00:00:58.890> you're<00:00:59.010> gonna

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
for this technique so what you're gonna

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.860 
for this technique so what you're gonna
do<00:00:59.309> it<00:00:59.609> says<00:00:59.789> in<00:00:59.910> the<00:01:00.000> book<00:01:00.180> you<00:01:00.359> knit<00:01:00.629> one

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
do it says in the book you knit one

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.310 
do it says in the book you knit one
stitch<00:01:01.079> then<00:01:01.739> you<00:01:02.399> knit<00:01:02.670> one<00:01:03.270> stitch<00:01:03.510> this<00:01:04.260> is

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
stitch then you knit one stitch this is

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.250 
stitch then you knit one stitch this is
the<00:01:04.470> repeat<00:01:04.949> now<00:01:05.129> pass<00:01:05.790> it<00:01:05.820> back<00:01:06.330> so<00:01:06.960> I<00:01:06.990> knitted

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
the repeat now pass it back so I knitted

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.050 
the repeat now pass it back so I knitted
it<00:01:07.470> I<00:01:07.619> put<00:01:07.830> it<00:01:07.860> back<00:01:08.070> on<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.340> Left<00:01:08.549> needle<00:01:08.640> and

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
it I put it back on the Left needle and

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.840 
it I put it back on the Left needle and
I'm<00:01:09.119> going<00:01:09.330> to<00:01:09.390> take<00:01:09.540> ten<00:01:09.869> stitches<00:01:10.290> off<00:01:10.850> over

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
I'm going to take ten stitches off over

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.880 
I'm going to take ten stitches off over
and<00:01:12.090> off<00:01:12.299> on<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.720> left<00:01:12.900> side<00:01:13.200> so<00:01:13.470> there's<00:01:13.650> one

are tons to just now you can see that's

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.649 
are tons to just now you can see that's
going<00:01:39.630> to<00:01:39.780> be<00:01:39.899> my<00:01:40.049> pedal<00:01:40.500> now<00:01:41.250> I<00:01:41.580> cast<00:01:42.119> on<00:01:42.390> three

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
going to be my pedal now I cast on three

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.690 
going to be my pedal now I cast on three
stitches<00:01:42.750> using<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.710> black<00:01:43.920> backward<00:01:44.429> loop

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
stitches using the black backward loop

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:50.960 
stitches using the black backward loop
method<00:01:45.000> one<00:01:46.130> two<00:01:47.960> three<00:01:48.960> and<00:01:49.289> then<00:01:50.130> I<00:01:50.159> knit<00:01:50.549> the

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
method one two three and then I knit the

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.870 
method one two three and then I knit the
same<00:01:51.330> stitch<00:01:51.780> again<00:01:52.280> which<00:01:53.280> is<00:01:53.429> that<00:01:53.580> first

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
same stitch again which is that first
