00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 everyone we meet for the 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.370
 fourth video about the mhp done 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.200
 in pvp we will be interested today 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.080
 a macro so and this one is called 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.670
 to salter times it's a macro that has 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.710
 for the purpose of allowing you to launch 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.849
 five piero on a target freezes so this 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.220
 what to do if using it 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.789
 only when your vis-Ã -vis 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.020
 more defensive trinket 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:24.960
 finally can not just not 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.720
 go out of leave in fact then for those 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.369
 here you have to have a pure stack 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.529
 so as I showed them on the video 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.180
 have this status with the 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:38.790
 Infernal blasts practice to all 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:41.820
 the shots a stack pirro one freezes the 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.010
 target we launch the first stone at 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:49.020
 second pierrot third quiero 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:52.199
 fourth worst at fifth piot then 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:55.260
 how does it work little parenthesis 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.579
 so you will have this mackerel in 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.780
 copy paste in the video emptied 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.449
 copy by hand if there is a time 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.160
 crazy and instead will have to replace 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.049
 English names by French non otherwise 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.659
 your spell book is not going 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.850
 recognize the spells how she 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:12.659
 works macro sign that you 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.040
 snap your gladiator's jewel 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.229
 and your spiritual presence 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.670
 before you alter the time 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.020
 so that when you go out 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.090
 to alter the time you will still have 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:25.799
 your spiritual presence your jewel 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.400
 is also the first proc office you 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.509
 have stack 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.880
 So as I told you before 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:34.799
 launch the macro what will you do two 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:36.299
 pierrots and your jewel then the macro 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.290
 she launches altering the time she throws 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.970
 the first stone or that you have 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.680
 stack the second period the presence 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.439
 spiritual the two keys a target 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.360
 he is 100% of critics third pawn 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:48.720
 then you come out of altering the time 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:51.930
 so you get lapiro the proc of 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.430
 departure and lapiro of the presence 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.110
 spiritual what we needed five 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.790
 certainly less than a mackerel 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.990
 stop almost after altering the 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.159
 time because when I go out to alter 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.530
 the time I finish the worst at hand 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.240
 in fact so 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.369
 I do not serve the macro anymore you can 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.150
 have it continue if you have to if 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:06.229
 you also play with a version 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.959
 English you will have enough character 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:10.069
 to add the other pierrot if in 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:11.540
 the first phase you use the 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:12.980
 burning kinds you can 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.680
 normally by far so fast and in 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.900
 pushing the output to alter the weather 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.640
 thrown in all six feet or even 7 if you 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.640
 are lucky after the release to tamper 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.690
 time however the big advantage of 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.069
 combustion is that if you are in 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.830
 focus for example on this target is 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:29.690
 closed hiller so control burning he 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.850
 is stone you pick up the dps there and 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:35.150
 after it's on the leader you have to 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:36.530
 instant control and dps still on 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.600
 the target so it's more interesting to 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:43.310
 keep burning to control the 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:49.970
 healer we go back the macro we go this 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:53.060
 stadium so a magical pony misses 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:57.860
 from me we have the stack 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:03:01.100
 we'll leave a frozen target laura 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.330
 legarda break the figure so I 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.650
 ransacked sheers rejected a 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:04.670
 hellish blast to show you 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.310
 the proc 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:09.019
 so here I was six proc because 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:10.160
 seeing that the guard had broken my new 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:12.829
 true life that I had launched the first 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.450
 pirro here at least that shows you a little 

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:18.560
 the focus switches in the worst of 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:19.610
 case you see that I could with the 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.620
 hellish blast that was 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:23.180
 reloaded by buying me a half stack 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.829
 which made me redo proclaimed 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.269
 pirro thing that I could not do 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:28.370
 since I already had a pierrot two 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:31.640
 games before that added my stack 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.060
 then the critics a little a critic 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.160
 clock 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.090
 we will say in the sense that the target 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.459
 was no longer frozen which made me 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:39.260
 still buy a sparrow and see 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:41.060
 teachers range from 5 to 7 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.280
 knowing that above 5 under used 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:46.310
 no spells outside the macro that's 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:48.290
 pure luck the mhp fire has the advantage 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:49.400
 to be able to make very fast switches 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:54.380
 as you see there for example I 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:55.760
 quickly recovered another focus and the 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:57.380
 same way can make the switch very 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.420
 fast with a dealer on 1 over a year 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:01.400
 their forgiveness is even you in the process of 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:02.630
 let go of your burst debut for example 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.640
 before coming out to alter the weather 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:07.459
 on a dps for impaired health time 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:09.260
 you will quickly start frosting 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:11.850
 mouth on the oil and you finish everything 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:14.610
 worth about 3/4 piero on the miller 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:17.940
 but huge damage alas the seat of 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:20.640
 your email will kill you we will see in the 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:25.410
 next video just another macro 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:27.930
 no longer access a v1 or burst start on 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:29.030
 a target that does not really have time 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:31.140
 to prepare 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:34.550
 do not hesitate if you have any 

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:34.550
 questions the muse and to the guys
