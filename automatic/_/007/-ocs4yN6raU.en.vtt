sure when you're sawing that you have
the<00:01:05.760> flat<00:01:06.030> side<00:01:06.420> on<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:06.810> top<00:01:06.840> because<00:01:07.500> you

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
the flat side on the top because you

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.649 
the flat side on the top because you
want<00:01:07.890> as<00:01:08.040> much<00:01:08.340> of<00:01:08.520> your<00:01:08.670> metal<00:01:08.880> supported<00:01:09.540> as

possible when you're sawing the angled
side<00:01:13.049> is<00:01:13.409> more<00:01:13.979> for<00:01:14.340> filing<00:01:14.850> because<00:01:15.390> you're

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
side is more for filing because you're

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.630

and we'll cover that later on so flip

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:21.980 
and we'll cover that later on so flip
your<00:01:20.850> bench<00:01:21.030> pin<00:01:21.330> around<00:01:21.450> and<00:01:21.810> make<00:01:21.960> sure

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
your bench pin around and make sure

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.380 
your bench pin around and make sure
you've<00:01:22.259> got<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.530> flat<00:01:22.770> top<00:01:23.070> up<00:01:26.150> you<00:01:27.150> want<00:01:27.299> to

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
you've got the flat top up you want to

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.870 
you've got the flat top up you want to
make<00:01:27.540> sure<00:01:27.570> that<00:01:28.140> there's<00:01:28.380> no<00:01:28.710> kinks<00:01:29.250> or<00:01:29.579> bends

make sure that there's no kinks or bends

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.190 
make sure that there's no kinks or bends
or<00:01:30.710> bad<00:01:31.710> creases<00:01:32.430> in<00:01:32.670> your<00:01:32.700> metal<00:01:33.240> I<00:01:33.479> can<00:01:33.630> see

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
or bad creases in your metal I can see

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.660 
or bad creases in your metal I can see
that<00:01:34.350> this<00:01:34.560> one's<00:01:34.770> got<00:01:34.979> a<00:01:35.009> little<00:01:35.220> bit<00:01:35.460> of<00:01:35.579> a

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
that this one's got a little bit of a

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.550 
that this one's got a little bit of a
curve<00:01:35.939> in<00:01:36.150> it<00:01:36.270> so<00:01:36.600> I'm<00:01:36.720> just<00:01:36.930> gonna<00:01:37.079> put<00:01:37.470> it

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
curve in it so I'm just gonna put it

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.600 
curve in it so I'm just gonna put it
between<00:01:37.920> these<00:01:38.430> two<00:01:38.490> steel<00:01:39.090> bench<00:01:39.450> blocks<00:01:39.810> and

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:40.610 
between these two steel bench blocks and

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.270 
between these two steel bench blocks and
flatten<00:01:42.200> with<00:01:43.200> a<00:01:43.259> mallet<00:01:43.740> to<00:01:43.770> take<00:01:44.130> the

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
flatten with a mallet to take the

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:50.450 
flatten with a mallet to take the
curvature<00:01:44.820> out<00:01:44.970> of<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.240> metal<00:01:48.920> and<00:01:49.920> I'm<00:01:50.310> gonna

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
curvature out of the metal and I'm gonna

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.039 
curvature out of the metal and I'm gonna
start<00:01:50.820> with<00:01:50.909> a<00:01:51.030> straight<00:01:51.360> line<00:01:51.689> I'm

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
start with a straight line I'm

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.270 
start with a straight line I'm
right-handed

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
right-handed

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.969 
right-handed
so<00:01:53.850> I<00:01:53.880> want<00:01:54.240> my<00:01:54.270> waste<00:01:54.570> metal<00:01:54.869> on<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.740> left

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
so I want my waste metal on the left

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.219 
so I want my waste metal on the left
side<00:01:56.219> so<00:01:56.640> my<00:01:56.850> left<00:01:57.030> hand<00:01:57.299> can<00:01:57.479> hold<00:01:57.689> it<00:01:57.930> if<00:01:58.079> I

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
side so my left hand can hold it if I

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.350 
side so my left hand can hold it if I
were<00:01:58.409> left-handed<00:01:58.770> I<00:01:59.310> would<00:01:59.969> turn<00:02:00.210> this

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
were left-handed I would turn this

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.899 
were left-handed I would turn this
pattern<00:02:00.810> around<00:02:00.930> and<00:02:01.500> hold<00:02:02.219> the<00:02:02.369> waste<00:02:02.549> metal

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
pattern around and hold the waste metal

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.819 
pattern around and hold the waste metal
with<00:02:03.030> my<00:02:03.240> right<00:02:03.420> hand<00:02:03.450> so<00:02:03.990> I<00:02:04.170> could<00:02:04.320> saw<00:02:04.619> this

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
with my right hand so I could saw this

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.490 
with my right hand so I could saw this
way

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
way

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.410 
way
a<00:02:06.560> good<00:02:07.370> thing<00:02:07.550> to<00:02:07.730> remember<00:02:07.970> when<00:02:08.270> you're

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
a good thing to remember when you're

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.200 
a good thing to remember when you're
sawing<00:02:08.869> is<00:02:09.050> always<00:02:09.619> look<00:02:09.890> just<00:02:10.460> ahead<00:02:10.940> of<00:02:10.970> the

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:11.210 
sawing is always look just ahead of the

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:13.630 
sawing is always look just ahead of the
blade<00:02:11.480> and<00:02:11.810> then<00:02:12.050> you<00:02:12.170> will<00:02:12.320> saw<00:02:12.680> to<00:02:13.280> the<00:02:13.430> line

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
blade and then you will saw to the line

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.940 
blade and then you will saw to the line
rather<00:02:14.180> than<00:02:14.360> getting<00:02:15.050> hypnotized<00:02:15.590> by<00:02:15.890> the

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
rather than getting hypnotized by the

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:21.970 
rather than getting hypnotized by the
moving<00:02:16.400> blade<00:02:17.860> when<00:02:18.860> I<00:02:18.890> start<00:02:19.370> a<00:02:19.490> cut<00:02:19.730> is<00:02:20.980> the

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
moving blade when I start a cut is the

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:23.740 
moving blade when I start a cut is the
only<00:02:22.310> time<00:02:22.550> I'm<00:02:22.700> going<00:02:22.820> to<00:02:22.910> angle<00:02:23.090> my<00:02:23.390> blade

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
only time I'm going to angle my blade

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.860 
only time I'm going to angle my blade
like<00:02:23.990> this<00:02:24.050> I<00:02:24.790> put<00:02:25.790> my<00:02:25.850> thumb<00:02:26.209> over<00:02:26.420> the<00:02:26.660> back

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
like this I put my thumb over the back

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:28.780 
like this I put my thumb over the back
of<00:02:26.900> the<00:02:27.080> blade<00:02:27.320> there's<00:02:27.709> no<00:02:27.890> teeth<00:02:28.130> back<00:02:28.430> here

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
of the blade there's no teeth back here

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.840 
of the blade there's no teeth back here
so<00:02:29.630> I<00:02:29.660> put<00:02:29.959> my<00:02:30.110> thumb<00:02:30.350> against<00:02:31.250> the<00:02:31.370> line<00:02:31.580> where

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:31.850 
so I put my thumb against the line where

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:34.300 
so I put my thumb against the line where
I<00:02:31.880> want<00:02:32.120> to<00:02:32.180> start<00:02:32.480> put<00:02:33.320> my<00:02:33.470> thumb<00:02:33.740> and<00:02:33.920> push

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
I want to start put my thumb and push

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.699 
I want to start put my thumb and push
away<00:02:34.760> from<00:02:35.030> myself<00:02:35.209> to<00:02:35.780> make<00:02:35.959> a<00:02:35.990> little<00:02:36.410> nick

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
away from myself to make a little nick

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:40.120 
away from myself to make a little nick
in<00:02:36.920> the<00:02:37.130> edge<00:02:37.250> of<00:02:37.430> the<00:02:37.490> metal<00:02:38.410> then<00:02:39.410> at<00:02:39.800> all

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
in the edge of the metal then at all

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:42.520 
in the edge of the metal then at all
times<00:02:40.489> when<00:02:41.000> you<00:02:41.090> are<00:02:41.120> sawing<00:02:41.540> think<00:02:42.350> of<00:02:42.470> a

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
times when you are sawing think of a

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.370 
times when you are sawing think of a
sewing<00:02:42.800> machine<00:02:43.239> this<00:02:44.239> blade<00:02:44.600> is<00:02:44.840> moving<00:02:45.200> up

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
sewing machine this blade is moving up

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.890 
sewing machine this blade is moving up
and<00:02:45.530> down<00:02:45.650> straight<00:02:46.610> up<00:02:46.790> and<00:02:46.970> down<00:02:47.030> like<00:02:47.450> a

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
and down straight up and down like a

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.690 
and down straight up and down like a
sewing<00:02:48.260> machine<00:02:48.380> needle<00:02:49.010> you<00:02:49.250> don't<00:02:49.489> ever

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
sewing machine needle you don't ever

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:50.410 
sewing machine needle you don't ever
push<00:02:50.030> it

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
push it

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.360 
push it
you<00:02:50.690> don't<00:02:50.900> ever<00:02:51.050> twist<00:02:51.470> it<00:02:51.680> you<00:02:51.890> don't<00:02:52.160> ever

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
you don't ever twist it you don't ever

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.240 
you don't ever twist it you don't ever
turn<00:02:52.670> it<00:02:52.880> you<00:02:53.090> don't<00:02:53.300> ever<00:02:53.450> angle<00:02:53.870> it<00:02:53.989> back

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
turn it you don't ever angle it back

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.860 
turn it you don't ever angle it back
think<00:02:55.250> of<00:02:55.370> this<00:02:55.489> as<00:02:55.730> a<00:02:55.760> sewing<00:02:56.090> machine<00:02:56.209> needle

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
think of this as a sewing machine needle

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.410 
think of this as a sewing machine needle
just<00:02:57.140> up<00:02:57.380> and<00:02:57.530> down<00:02:57.739> up<00:02:58.070> and<00:02:58.190> down<00:02:58.310> you<00:02:59.239> want

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
just up and down up and down you want

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.720 
just up and down up and down you want
your<00:02:59.630> wrist<00:02:59.870> to<00:03:00.110> be<00:03:00.260> relaxed<00:03:00.950> you<00:03:01.400> don't<00:03:01.580> need

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
your wrist to be relaxed you don't need

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:04.000 
your wrist to be relaxed you don't need
a<00:03:01.760> death<00:03:02.090> grip<00:03:02.120> on<00:03:02.450> the<00:03:02.870> handle<00:03:03.290> because<00:03:03.709> you

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
a death grip on the handle because you

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.180 
a death grip on the handle because you
will<00:03:04.160> twist<00:03:04.310> the<00:03:04.610> blade<00:03:04.850> and<00:03:05.030> break<00:03:05.270> it<00:03:06.190> so

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 
will twist the blade and break it so

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:11.080 
will twist the blade and break it so
once<00:03:07.430> you've<00:03:07.610> got<00:03:07.790> that<00:03:07.970> little<00:03:08.300> nick<00:03:10.090> you're

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
once you've got that little nick you're

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.570 
once you've got that little nick you're
gonna<00:03:11.180> start<00:03:11.630> and<00:03:12.019> I'm<00:03:12.920> gonna<00:03:13.070> solve<00:03:13.459> this

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:13.580 
gonna start and I'm gonna solve this

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:15.940 
gonna start and I'm gonna solve this
this<00:03:14.090> is<00:03:14.269> a<00:03:14.299> great<00:03:14.630> practice<00:03:15.230> pattern<00:03:15.620> because

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
this is a great practice pattern because

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:18.070 
this is a great practice pattern because
you'll<00:03:16.160> have<00:03:16.310> a<00:03:16.580> straight<00:03:17.180> line<00:03:17.510> then<00:03:18.049> a

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:18.080 
you'll have a straight line then a

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.110 
you'll have a straight line then a
gently<00:03:18.620> curved<00:03:18.920> line<00:03:19.220> then<00:03:19.549> you<00:03:19.640> get<00:03:19.790> to<00:03:19.940> turn

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
gently curved line then you get to turn

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.120 
gently curved line then you get to turn
corners<00:03:20.720> then<00:03:20.989> you<00:03:21.080> get<00:03:21.230> to<00:03:21.350> do<00:03:21.470> switchbacks

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
corners then you get to do switchbacks

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:24.580 
corners then you get to do switchbacks
so<00:03:22.549> this<00:03:23.180> is<00:03:23.330> a<00:03:23.360> terrific<00:03:23.690> pattern<00:03:24.320> if<00:03:24.470> you're

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
so this is a terrific pattern if you're

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.560 
so this is a terrific pattern if you're
just<00:03:24.799> learning<00:03:25.010> and<00:03:25.400> I'd<00:03:25.519> suggest<00:03:25.760> starting

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:26.570 
just learning and I'd suggest starting

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:29.350 
just learning and I'd suggest starting
on<00:03:26.750> about<00:03:27.049> 20<00:03:28.010> gauge<00:03:28.190> aluminum<00:03:28.580> because<00:03:29.209> it's

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:29.360 
on about 20 gauge aluminum because it's

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.750 
on about 20 gauge aluminum because it's
easy<00:03:29.750> to<00:03:29.989> cut<00:03:30.230> and<00:03:30.380> it's<00:03:30.739> inexpensive<00:03:31.100> you<00:03:31.730> can

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
easy to cut and it's inexpensive you can

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.860 
easy to cut and it's inexpensive you can
saw<00:03:32.150> for<00:03:32.420> three<00:03:32.780> weeks<00:03:33.019> for<00:03:33.410> three<00:03:33.650> bucks

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
saw for three weeks for three bucks

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:42.009 
saw for three weeks for three bucks
aluminum<00:03:35.870> is<00:03:35.930> a<00:03:36.019> great<00:03:36.260> practice<00:03:36.739> metal<00:03:41.019> the

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:42.019 
aluminum is a great practice metal the

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:43.990 
aluminum is a great practice metal the
positioning<00:03:42.650> of<00:03:42.769> your<00:03:42.920> hands<00:03:43.280> is<00:03:43.519> important

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
positioning of your hands is important

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.520 
positioning of your hands is important
when<00:03:44.120> you're<00:03:44.269> sawing<00:03:44.510> too<00:03:44.810> because<00:03:45.170> you<00:03:45.290> want

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
when you're sawing too because you want

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:48.340 
when you're sawing too because you want
to<00:03:45.620> steer<00:03:45.980> the<00:03:46.190> metal<00:03:46.579> not<00:03:47.120> the<00:03:47.390> blade<00:03:47.660> so<00:03:48.290> I

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:48.350 
to steer the metal not the blade so I

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:52.590 
to steer the metal not the blade so I
always<00:03:48.680> use<00:03:48.860> a<00:03:48.890> V<00:03:49.340> grip<00:03:49.640> around<00:03:50.329> my<00:03:50.959> blade<00:03:51.290> and

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:52.600 
always use a V grip around my blade and

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.500 
always use a V grip around my blade and
the<00:03:53.600> point<00:03:53.989> of<00:03:54.260> this<00:03:54.650> V<00:03:55.040> the<00:03:55.880> further<00:03:56.209> you<00:03:56.480> are

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
the point of this V the further you are

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:59.199 
the point of this V the further you are
in<00:03:56.989> the<00:03:57.650> more<00:03:57.860> your<00:03:58.040> metal<00:03:58.340> is<00:03:58.430> supported

00:03:59.199 --> 00:03:59.209 
in the more your metal is supported

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:01.600 
in the more your metal is supported
so<00:03:59.660> I<00:03:59.720> scooch<00:04:00.350> it<00:04:00.500> back<00:04:00.650> to<00:04:00.829> about<00:04:00.950> there<00:04:01.400> and

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:01.610 
so I scooch it back to about there and

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:04.000 
so I scooch it back to about there and
then<00:04:02.420> I'm<00:04:02.600> just<00:04:02.630> going<00:04:02.989> to<00:04:03.019> look<00:04:03.230> ahead<00:04:03.560> of<00:04:03.890> the

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 
then I'm just going to look ahead of the

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:12.920 
then I'm just going to look ahead of the
blade<00:04:04.250> and<00:04:04.519> go

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:15.270 

and<00:04:13.930> you'll<00:04:14.140> see<00:04:14.380> that<00:04:14.410> I<00:04:14.650> have<00:04:14.740> a<00:04:14.950> nice

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:15.280 
and you'll see that I have a nice

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:18.870 
and you'll see that I have a nice
relaxed<00:04:15.910> grip<00:04:16.090> I'm<00:04:16.450> sawing<00:04:16.959> as<00:04:17.400> the<00:04:18.400> entire

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
relaxed grip I'm sawing as the entire

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.390 
relaxed grip I'm sawing as the entire
length<00:04:19.209> of<00:04:19.390> the<00:04:19.450> blade<00:04:19.720> you<00:04:19.930> don't<00:04:20.110> want<00:04:20.290> to<00:04:20.400> do

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 
length of the blade you don't want to do

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.700 
length of the blade you don't want to do
that<00:04:21.580> because<00:04:21.790> you'll<00:04:22.030> wear<00:04:23.020> out<00:04:23.200> those<00:04:23.440> teeth

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:23.710 
that because you'll wear out those teeth

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:25.740 
that because you'll wear out those teeth
in<00:04:23.890> that<00:04:24.070> one<00:04:24.220> section<00:04:24.730> you<00:04:24.940> want<00:04:25.210> to<00:04:25.300> try<00:04:25.540> and

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 
in that one section you want to try and

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:28.800 
in that one section you want to try and
use<00:04:25.900> the<00:04:26.110> entire<00:04:26.500> blade<00:04:27.060> just<00:04:28.060> put<00:04:28.450> your<00:04:28.630> feet

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
use the entire blade just put your feet

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.950 
use the entire blade just put your feet
flat<00:04:28.840> on<00:04:29.800> the<00:04:29.860> floor<00:04:29.920> breathe<00:04:30.700> and<00:04:31.210> relax<00:04:31.570> and

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:31.960 
flat on the floor breathe and relax and

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:55.770 
flat on the floor breathe and relax and
saw<00:04:53.310> now<00:04:54.310> when<00:04:54.550> you<00:04:54.640> get<00:04:54.760> to<00:04:54.940> the<00:04:55.060> very<00:04:55.360> end<00:04:55.450> of

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:55.780 
saw now when you get to the very end of

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:58.170 
saw now when you get to the very end of
your<00:04:55.870> line<00:04:56.110> you<00:04:57.070> want<00:04:57.220> to<00:04:57.280> go<00:04:57.400> a<00:04:57.430> little<00:04:57.670> slower

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:58.180 
your line you want to go a little slower

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:03.960 
your line you want to go a little slower
and<00:04:58.870> a<00:04:59.770> little<00:05:00.070> gentler<00:05:02.430> and<00:05:03.430> you<00:05:03.580> just<00:05:03.790> go

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:03.970 
and a little gentler and you just go

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:06.330 
and a little gentler and you just go
right<00:05:04.150> through<00:05:04.210> like<00:05:04.480> that<00:05:05.190> and<00:05:06.190> that's

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:06.340 
right through like that and that's

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:09.570 
right through like that and that's
sawing<00:05:06.880> a<00:05:07.000> straight<00:05:07.330> line
