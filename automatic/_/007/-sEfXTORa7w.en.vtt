 outpatient clinic we are in the area of 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:06.160
 reserve of the floor minus one we will find one 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:09.229
 modern nuclear magnetic resonance 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:11.630
 comma five tests but while at the first 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:13.340
 slowly we have the heart part the part 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.810
 more important, that is to say the complex 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.310
 operative the therapy department 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:22.490
 intensive care in the ward 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:24.500
 we welcome the nell'ambulatorio 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.660
 archaeological center on the left

 you can see a local reception e 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:30.470
 on the right 4 consult outpatients 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:32.750
 inside the clinic in the center 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:35.869
 biological services are provided 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.790
 coca both fetal and pediatric biography 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:40.509
 and also a service in the clinic 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.509
 to decompensation 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:52.729
 now we are on the site of 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:53.990
 nuclear magnetic resonance of the center 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:56.689
 pediatric cardiology of the Mediterranean 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.609
 they are currently performing a la 

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:00.350
 MRI is obviously one 

00:01:58.609 --> 00:02:02.420
 little invasive method because not 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:05.829
 use ionizing additions here 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.829
 we have the operations room 

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:32.159
 here we are in the heart of the center 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.799
 cardiological that is surgical complex 

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:36.209
 which has been recently renovated 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:37.950
 we totally have an operating room 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:39.150
 that I have surgery where I currently don't 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.040
 I can attend because they are 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.719
 performing an intervention in circulation 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.129
 he's bodily while on our right 

00:02:42.719 --> 00:02:46.200
 we have the flagship of the 

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:47.310
 cardiology center the vipan angiograph 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.560
 areas that is placed inside 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.840
 of hybrid hemodynamics because it is called 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.670
 hybrid hemodynamics because it is a room 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.290
 innovative where in addition to the intervention of 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.400
 catheterization can be contextually 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.400
 underwent surgery 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:10.370
 this corridor separates the therapy 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:13.579
 intensive from the operating area one 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:15.409
 very appropriate logistics solution in 

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:17.390
 how much the spaces are very close together 

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:20.030
 and allows strict compliance with the 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:21.890
 intensive care pathways presents 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:24.680
 six highly complex beds 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:28.090
 assistance to which they follow 6 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.090
 beds of sub-intensive therapy 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.989
 the provision of intensive care 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:37.879
 of the operating department of the department of 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:39.530
 stay on the same floor are a guarantee 

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:41.000
 yes for both the security of the 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:42.110
 patient than for the efficiency of the 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.910
 system 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:45.769
 a doctor this way can easily 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:47.750
 access all parts of the center 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:50.260
 thus ensuring more performance 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.260
 correct 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.400
 here we are inside the hall 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:03.349
 meet what place the doctors are 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.599
 bring together confront each other take 

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:06.950
 decisions against their patients is 

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:09.469
 also the place where they are made 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:12.260
 periodic update ditches e 

00:04:09.469 --> 00:04:14.450
 moreover, it is the place where the 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.699
 regional surgical surgical conference 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:18.979
 the so-called cmcr which is the instrument 

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:21.049
 of the clinical governance of the government of 

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:29.840
 pediatric cardiology network is the 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:31.280
 sicily region with the corridor we have 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.320
 hospital wards as hardly seen 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:36.680
 renovated 12 beds distributed 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:38.509
 in six double rooms where the imperative 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.620
 categorical and the humanization of the 

00:04:38.509 --> 00:04:41.240
 course of care 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:43.190
 our doctors to our nurses yes 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:46.419
 take charge of the patient and also in the 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:46.419
 his lived of the whole family
