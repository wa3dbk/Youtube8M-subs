 just to my liking and I am also for this volunteer in the series 

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.810
 little brother read aloud 

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:08.340
 pill in this episode 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.389
 which books are suitable and which are my favorite 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.060
 we are so many different ones 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:22.590
 but actually for young the child the shorter the story must be and 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.140
 the shorter the sentences must be I go for those families where it 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:31.060
 girl anita five years is custovic book week not fit heart attack and 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.230
 those are nice to read before I go to read and I always go first 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.430
 to no longer eat 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.300
 and what I always do against this is that the books just browse through so that 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.020
 I see 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.700
 and offered the images and that the text is not too difficult 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:46.240
 these are books 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.570
 which I took myself to a kidney to a girl of 5 years 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.140
 little girls in the house 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.960
 the circus ship 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.620

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.340

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.880
 they are actually all animal books with the pictures added 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.119
 and with one the text is long and he took a little shorter at the time 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.190
 about others

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.680
 readers in side that can also try out a little what kids I think to be 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.610
 read what is going to be the first race 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.610
