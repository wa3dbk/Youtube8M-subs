within<00:02:20.200> 20<00:02:20.530> feet<00:02:20.560> not<00:02:20.980> close<00:02:21.220> enough<00:02:21.520> and<00:02:22.060> we

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
within 20 feet not close enough and we

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.210 
within 20 feet not close enough and we
went<00:02:23.020> a<00:02:23.050> little<00:02:23.200> bit<00:02:23.440> farther<00:02:23.709> out<00:02:23.980> and

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
went a little bit farther out and

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.400 
went a little bit farther out and
decided<00:02:24.700> to<00:02:24.730> check<00:02:25.090> one<00:02:25.330> more<00:02:25.360> cave<00:02:25.750> and<00:02:26.050> we're

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
decided to check one more cave and we're

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.150 
decided to check one more cave and we're
looking<00:02:26.740> down<00:02:26.860> we<00:02:26.980> saw<00:02:27.130> this<00:02:27.220> big<00:02:27.430> fish<00:02:27.900> and<00:02:29.160> I

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
looking down we saw this big fish and I

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.490 
looking down we saw this big fish and I
guess<00:02:30.610> it<00:02:30.760> was<00:02:30.880> a<00:02:30.910> hop<00:02:31.300> aboard<00:02:31.450> giant<00:02:32.050> sea<00:02:32.260> bass

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
guess it was a hop aboard giant sea bass
