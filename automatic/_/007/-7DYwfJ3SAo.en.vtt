00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.769
 Friday finally arrived and all 

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:11.019
 we want to free ourselves and go out dancing 

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:13.150
 our friends so in this tutorial 

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:15.579
 we are going to show you how to get a 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:17.999
 perfect golden look for a night of 

00:00:15.579 --> 00:00:17.999
 party 

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:31.130
 start by applying the twist eyeliner 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:34.190
 in brown function in the inner corner 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:37.250
 of the eye and we're going to do it very very 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:39.050
 concentrate then let's blur with 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:42.140
 the finger a little bit the lines so you do not 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:44.780
 there are divisions and we are going to 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:47.150
 apply the same color in the part 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:50.920
 external eye to give it depth 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.920
 in these two hours 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:05.940
 do the same but now in the part of 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.940
 under the lower lashes 

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:26.270
 Make up your water line with the same 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.270
 colour 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:37.440
 for now it looks a bit crazy but it's going to 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.320
 to be very nice I promise I will 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:43.410
 take the palette of shadows and eyes in 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.900
 order six this golden color is lovely 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:48.390
 and with videos I'm going to apply it from the center 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.460
 towards the sides of what happens 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.010
 here is that as on the sides of 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.950
 our eyes have a more base 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:59.370
 the shadow is going to turn into those 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.380
 costs a little darker so it goes to 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:04.170
 give the impression that we have two 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.090
 applied shades the golden one that is in 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.970
 the center and the sides that 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:12.660
 it looks golden but a little darker 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:15.600
 the change is very very subtle between a 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:19.140
 color and another but you see the difference and 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:21.960
 It's super nice to apply it like that with your 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:24.900
 fingers and without fear that you can then 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:27.930
 remove the waste in apply up and 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:31.220
 down that it looks like pretty smoky 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.220
 eye is super good 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:49.970
 with life forever eyeliner on white 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:52.220
 to see we are going to make a line in 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.750
 quite particular, let's start 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.720
 here I will show you clearly 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:59.150
 making a line towards the 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.650
 end of the eyebrows and then another that 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:03.260
 find with our lashes 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:06.019
 higher but we will get there only 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.640
 until the middle of the logo we are not going to 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:11.299
 take the line to the beginning of 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:13.610
 eye and we are going to fill in so that they remain 

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:17.209
 super cute this line that helps us 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:18.980
 create a super seductive look now 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:21.110
 I'm going to apply the matt cover base in 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:24.650
 secret life all over my face to 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:26.930
 remove imperfections and cover granites 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:30.260
 spots all those things that we do not 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:32.120
 like and remember girls to emphasize 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.569
 in the application in the area of 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.569
 eye bags 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:41.590
 the base is always found with some powders 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:45.430
 and I'm using checkmate in mid 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:47.920
 confidential so this is to give you 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:50.380
 the perfect final touch to our face 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:53.320
 here I am shaping my face with the 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:55.330
 powders I had title in these two facts 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:57.190
 They are normal powders but to me 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:04:00.010
 they are a little darker and I use it 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:02.100
 to outline the face and with the blush 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:05.790
 Chic girl in blogs and I'm going to give her 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:05.790

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:15.300

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:18.290

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:18.290

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:35.070
 and with the mask stretched in stretch 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:38.370

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:44.400
