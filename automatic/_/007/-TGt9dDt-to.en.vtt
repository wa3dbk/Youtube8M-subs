grain<00:01:04.710> a<00:01:04.739> bit<00:01:04.979> here<00:01:05.189> Nathalie<00:01:05.820> but<00:01:05.970> I'd<00:01:06.210> go<00:01:06.390> for

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
grain a bit here Nathalie but I'd go for

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.420 
grain a bit here Nathalie but I'd go for
West<00:01:06.750> Brom<00:01:06.990> only<00:01:07.200> out<00:01:07.320> right<00:01:07.530> here<00:01:07.770> and<00:01:08.159> that

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
West Brom only out right here and that

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.429 
West Brom only out right here and that
sounds<00:01:08.640> crazy<00:01:08.880> because<00:01:09.180> West<00:01:09.479> West<00:01:10.290> probably

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
sounds crazy because West West probably

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:11.929 
sounds crazy because West West probably
been<00:01:10.710> struggling<00:01:11.040> offseason<00:01:11.610> sometimes

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939

would<00:01:12.060> have<00:01:12.150> been<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.330> team<00:01:12.510> flying<00:01:12.810> high<00:01:12.960> but

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
would have been the team flying high but

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.990 
would have been the team flying high but
I<00:01:13.380> wouldn't<00:01:14.070> be<00:01:14.130> surprised<00:01:14.520> if<00:01:14.670> they<00:01:14.790> don't

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
I wouldn't be surprised if they don't

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.210 
I wouldn't be surprised if they don't
finish<00:01:15.270> that<00:01:15.810> far<00:01:16.200> away<00:01:16.470> from<00:01:16.530> each<00:01:16.890> other<00:01:17.070> in

finish that far away from each other in

finish that far away from each other in
the<00:01:17.369> table<00:01:17.850> I'm<00:01:18.030> not<00:01:18.150> saying<00:01:18.390> that<00:01:18.420> we'll<00:01:18.570> be

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
some people would argue that the value

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.440 
some people would argue that the value
has<00:02:05.460> gone<00:02:05.490> on<00:02:05.850> that<00:02:06.030> bet

games the creating the chances so you

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:37.960 
games the creating the chances so you
could<00:02:36.590> argue<00:02:36.740> that<00:02:36.980> we'll<00:02:37.310> what<00:02:37.730> if<00:02:37.820> they

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
could argue that we'll what if they

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:39.400 
could argue that we'll what if they

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
start to fire those in what if they do

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:40.930 
start to fire those in what if they do
start<00:02:39.530> to<00:02:39.740> find<00:02:39.920> the<00:02:39.980> back<00:02:40.130> of<00:02:40.250> the<00:02:40.310> net<00:02:40.520> which

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
start to find the back of the net which

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:42.550 
start to find the back of the net which
is<00:02:40.970> a<00:02:41.120> fair<00:02:41.300> point<00:02:41.510> I<00:02:41.810> don't<00:02:42.080> think<00:02:42.260> they<00:02:42.440> will

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
is a fair point I don't think they will

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.380 
is a fair point I don't think they will
though<00:02:42.710> because<00:02:42.890> you<00:02:43.160> know<00:02:43.190> Tony<00:02:43.790> Poulos<00:02:44.180> is

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
though because you know Tony Poulos is

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.540 
though because you know Tony Poulos is
imagine<00:02:45.380> who<00:02:45.500> sets<00:02:45.770> these<00:02:45.920> teams<00:02:46.160> look<00:02:46.340> very

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
imagine who sets these teams look very

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:49.570 
imagine who sets these teams look very
organized<00:02:47.150> by<00:02:47.810> disciplined<00:02:48.440> doesn't<00:02:49.370> want<00:02:49.490> to

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
organized by disciplined doesn't want to

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.370 
organized by disciplined doesn't want to
give<00:02:49.700> too<00:02:49.910> much<00:02:49.940> away<00:02:50.090> so<00:02:50.660> I<00:02:50.690> think<00:02:50.810> it<00:02:51.140> will<00:02:51.230> be

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380 
give too much away so I think it will be

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.920 
give too much away so I think it will be
low-scoring<00:02:51.830> you<00:02:52.820> know<00:02:52.970> I<00:02:53.240> don't<00:02:53.750> really<00:02:53.840> like

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
low-scoring you know I don't really like

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:55.150 
low-scoring you know I don't really like
chasing<00:02:54.260> the<00:02:54.410> value<00:02:54.710> I<00:02:54.740> mean<00:02:54.770> you<00:02:54.920> could<00:02:55.040> go

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
chasing the value I mean you could go

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.030 
chasing the value I mean you could go
under<00:02:55.370> 1.5<00:02:56.170> you<00:02:57.170> know<00:02:57.290> but<00:02:57.440> if<00:02:57.650> you're<00:02:57.950> not

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
under 1.5 you know but if you're not

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.330 
under 1.5 you know but if you're not
killing<00:02:58.280> the<00:02:58.700> 2.5<00:02:59.300> price<00:02:59.660> then<00:02:59.930> yeah<00:03:00.410> yeah<00:03:01.160> why

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
killing the 2.5 price then yeah yeah why

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.280 
killing the 2.5 price then yeah yeah why
would<00:03:01.550> you<00:03:01.640> go<00:03:01.760> for<00:03:01.940> that<00:03:02.090> I<00:03:02.240> really<00:03:02.780> like<00:03:02.960> it

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
would you go for that I really like it

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.350 
would you go for that I really like it
just<00:03:03.740> because<00:03:04.040> then<00:03:04.220> the<00:03:04.310> 2.5<00:03:04.880> is<00:03:05.090> short

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
just because then the 2.5 is short

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.300 
just because then the 2.5 is short
doesn't<00:03:06.140> mean<00:03:06.290> you<00:03:06.410> can't<00:03:06.680> play<00:03:06.950> it<00:03:07.130> it's

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
doesn't mean you can't play it it's

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.070 
doesn't mean you can't play it it's
short<00:03:07.580> for<00:03:07.670> a<00:03:07.850> reason<00:03:08.270> sometimes<00:03:08.630> you<00:03:08.900> want<00:03:09.020> to

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:09.080 
short for a reason sometimes you want to

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:10.630

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.030 
very tight defensively at home and

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:30.400 
very tight defensively at home and
you've<00:04:29.270> got<00:04:29.390> this<00:04:29.480> brilliant<00:04:29.690> Southampton

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:30.410 
you've got this brilliant Southampton

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:32.380 
you've got this brilliant Southampton
defense<00:04:30.770> all<00:04:31.280> they<00:04:31.670> know<00:04:31.880> his<00:04:32.030> defense

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:32.390 
defense all they know his defense

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:34.300 
defense all they know his defense
Southampton<00:04:33.020> without<00:04:33.230> the<00:04:33.320> goal<00:04:33.500> so<00:04:33.860> I<00:04:34.040> think
