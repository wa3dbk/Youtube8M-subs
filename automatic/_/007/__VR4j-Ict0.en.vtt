00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.610
 hello everybody if you ever saw that 

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:33.100
 where you show how to use the 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:35.350
 graphite tells you off to activate the 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.300
 screen when your device is in the 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.910
 vertical position and disable the 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:43.000
 when it is upright or 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:44.710
 in another position but place in the 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.970
 position you have selected so that the 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.960
 screen off 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:54.150
 maybe you'll like it here at O 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:54.150
 function to activate the shaking screen 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:01:04.750
 this is a function in which we are going to 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:09.190
 use the test we're going to need 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:12.070
 also that sets and we will need 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:14.170
 your appliance has rice without guti you do not 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.900
 Will you be able to do this, ok? 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:19.030
 after you installed the test and followed them 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:21.310
 and 7 but you will come here in 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:24.729
 settings of your device you will 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:27.580
 coming in accessibility will activate the 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:30.759
 test service are you will come in 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:33.790
 device administrators security 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:34.920
 and will mark the tse want the sekhil and 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:37.000
 seven months 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.430
 remembering that these settings can 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.039
 depending on the device 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:43.180
 that you are using and the version of 

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:44.979
 operational system 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:49.110
 in this case here I am with the galaxy note 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:52.119
 4 running android love pop 5.0.1 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.689
 after installing that the 7,000 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:57.549
 tests that you become child than the 7 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.710
 insist more and you will click here 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:01.570
 on this button here it probably goes 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.880
 to be in this way if 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.950
 first time you install it it will 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.520
 being this way you will click on 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.520
 lebu 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:15.610
 when you use these functions 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:18.460
 first time it is also likely to be 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:21.520
 requested super authorization 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:23.260
 the user with silk when he went to 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.360
 function that we are going to use this 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.100
 I'll turn it off so we can 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.410
 start everything from scratch 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:31.300
 first you'll come here oh these three 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:35.860
 dots we will enter here in 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:37.900
 monitor preferences and we will look for 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.360
 the accelerometer 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.980
 this one would theoretically work 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.370
 just clicking on irs 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.900
 but your device does not 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.910
 responsive to the stimuli he will enter 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.550
 in the way we call deep sleep 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:54.490
 where the floor function and makes the 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:57.520
 your device to mass pain and in this way 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:59.320
 it will only have your processor turned on 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.660
 again with some function was 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:03.430
 prompted when you activate the 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.620
 in this case here we will not let you 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:09.070
 sleep will consume a little bit more 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:12.190
 battery but little or nothing beyond the 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:13.750
 graffiti screen on off was already done 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.660
 so let's leave it here 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:18.730
 and Mr the blog team the way we return 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:21.220
 and now let's create the functions not 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:23.620
 explain here in the first thing 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.960
 stay we want this to happen with 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:32.680
 the screen is off then we go in 

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:35.820
 display display state of let's go back and 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:38.980
 will ask for a test we click the plus 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:41.170
 I do not usually just name the face in the 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.690
 a check icon 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:48.130
 we will stay at it again and here we 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:50.530
 let's plugin in followed and sets 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:52.810
 let's click here on the pencil icon 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:56.470
 let's go guys 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:04:00.220
 Let's go down and see here, eike de 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:02.740
 several rivals we will only modify 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:05.880
 this part here of a second I O 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:12.360
 I'd rather leave 5 and we'll click 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:15.580
 save ok let's go back again 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:16.690
 here he just colón and just put 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:20.150
 there 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:22.069
 a condition of plays take off 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:25.069
 I'll click and hold 

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:29.750
 Get on top of it and go on over again. 

00:04:25.069 --> 00:04:36.680
 now I go on events then I 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:38.599
 I will incensed sheik and will mark the 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:41.810
 string flowers 

00:04:38.599 --> 00:04:44.270
 then this function, which is 4 hours 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:46.789
 will work when the appliance does this 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:48.379
 move here and it will work out too 

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:52.370
 for those of you who like me 

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:53.599
 then shake the device, so it goes 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:54.860
 it will work 

00:04:53.599 --> 00:04:57.289
 If you are one of those who was once 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:58.580
 laterally the penalty if not 

00:04:57.289 --> 00:04:59.630
 make this move forward to 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:03.409
 back 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:05.210
 select left haiti ok i prefer 

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:10.310
 Quartz Hate 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:14.500
 let it insitir sensitivity and Emídio 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:17.419
 duration here and we will also come back 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:20.030
 and let's test the function to get out of here 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:22.069
 it takes a few seconds to 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:23.750
 this function works 

00:05:22.069 --> 00:05:27.460
 Let's see, it may be that first and not 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:30.620
 work worked 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:32.659
 It's going to work out what the 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:37.449
 problem here if you have to 

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:42.550
 head will happen too, right? 

00:05:37.449 --> 00:05:48.460
 if you are like this not if you 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:52.159
 swing it this way too inactive 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:55.580
 but I tested it on my shirt pocket like 

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:57.800
 shirt fabric is thinner when 

00:05:55.580 --> 00:06:00.680
 device shakes inside my pocket does 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:02.509
 The noise here usually puts 

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:05.900
 position because the sound box is here 

00:06:02.509 --> 00:06:08.210
 then there was and in this case in the tests 

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:10.490
 I did not happen to activate it until 

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:12.529
 there alone to disable that she likes 

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:15.740
 to leave the device in 

00:06:12.529 --> 00:06:18.169
 Nassiriya hangs up alone I do not need 

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:19.160
 pressing the right no button is a 

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:20.930
 tutorial yes 

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:22.460
 rapidly making your battery will be 

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:25.130
 consumed a little bit more but a lot 

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:27.800
 little is not worth it do not have to stay 

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:29.450
 pressing the None button to activate the 

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:31.250
 you do not need to use the 

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:34.040
 proximity sensor that sometimes activates 

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:36.350
 unit to the right fool you liked 

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:38.030

 some other tricks that answer 

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:49.610
 in the tse brazil community on google
