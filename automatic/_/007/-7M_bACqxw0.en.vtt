00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 the people my name is julian zietlow 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.970
 and the personal training and today goes 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.189
 it is the controversial topic 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:11.780
 the youtube gurus and fitness models and 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.780
 the natural bodybuilders all doped 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:17.190
 So he is not all that 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.109
 I just do not want to be too 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.750
 leaning out of the window and I want to 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.269
 do not attack anyone and mine 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:28.320
 criticism should not apply to a single person 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:32.790
 but rather the whole system so it 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:35.100
 So that's what I said 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.230
 in the usa to a dexter jackson one 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.489
 you really go to the former olympia 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:44.280
 and took pictures with several others 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:46.170
 youtube stars so fitness models in the 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.000
 the usa stands the people to part 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.350
 one and a half to two hours around with the 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.690
 to be able to chat an autograph too 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.489
 get and take a picture so 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.570
 this is really an extreme heike 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.600
 been kicked off 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:01.289
 there is on instagram facebook and such 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.629
 a billiard fitness models the one 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.240
 look hotter than the other on the 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:10.950
 tip of course, craft aid a really 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.180
 magnificent man and that's exactly how it works 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.390
 just in Germany going on that the 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:18.330
 natural scene just celebrated what I am 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:21.360
 first very positive think that easy 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:24.150
 It's great that nobody wants to stop 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.810
 What a gigantic gigantic club looks like 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.990
 which is not a criticism it is a 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.060
 completely 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.189
 I realize that is completely different 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.439
 simply crass what do the 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.720
 Preparation for bodybuilding and living 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.100
 I'm away myself so I buy 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.240
 also the flex and look at me 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.979
 Of course , I do not allow her 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.630
 things for my customers or something like me 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:46.140
 look at that was a mister olympia 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:48.750
 I think it's awesome but what I am 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.490
 What I have noticed is these people 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.320
 on the stage of the Olympics and so on 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.670
 At least give them to shoot 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.600
 yes that is not more of the 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:59.070
 hand in many others 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.360
 Sports is not so take it 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.799
 We cyclists take the exact 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.890
 the same as the whole bodybuilder 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.360
 growth of men 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.710
 and so on but not see 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.659
 accordingly passes of course 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.220
 your bike just 10 1000 calories 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:09.729
 Burn when you have your tour 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.860
 do 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.360
 they just can not do it 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.560
 you can not immediately tell you you take 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.040
 take not or whatever the 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:20.590
 bodybuilder was ok has van nice 60s 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.760
 biceps but somewhere has that too 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.830
 it does not come from it 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.650
 that you go to a breakfast in the park 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.630
 So it's back to the day again 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.760
 return to the theme of fitness models 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.810
 youtube gurus and the natural 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.530
 bodybuilding scene 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:37.450
 I spoke to someone yesterday 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.190
 a preparer, if I always 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:42.180
 quite like it is so to speak the 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:44.620
 someone who is a natural athlete 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.269
 on top of that or generally one 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.040
 also in the professional field on the athlete 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:49.959
 be prepared stage yes there will always be 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:54.489
 great training systems touted yes 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:56.110
 this is my new jtb program or 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:58.269
 otherwise something is the program 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.100
 relatively no matter how train since 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:01.600
 20 years which are already know what 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:05.260
 do the profi bodybuilders 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:07.600
 it's just what kind of what 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.709
 which substance end effect I have 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.079
 no quotes and awakens with it 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:13.239
 which material you perceive that is 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:14.890
 the experienced books got that 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:15.880
 professionals then they look great on the 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.500
 stand out as they do 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.540
 growth hormones which drainage 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.220
 when to sell something and so on 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.630
 that's what these preparers are for 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.459
 i have a preparer for this 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:26.200
 Spoke said so the natural 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:29.320
 scenes in germany are already there 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.700
 34 candidates so I think it's great 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:32.140
 I also have training videos 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:35.049
 of which saw so blatantly horny 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.819
 motivation power they look great 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:37.790
 can I 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:40.560
 In 100 years not keep up with madness 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:42.900
 and then I went from them yes 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.129
 they are all on top of it and that has 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.389
 I was a bit shocked when 

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:48.719
 I have seen the pictures before 

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:51.090
 I thought, okay, either 

00:03:48.719 --> 00:03:52.519
 no idea as thor or half 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.840
 to be born or there is something 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:57.689
 Substance 'took action in the end became 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:59.310
 is now confirmed that he says that 

00:03:57.689 --> 00:04:01.829
 first in most natural 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:04.939
 Competitors have no coal at all 

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:07.530
 for example, to test growth hormones 

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:09.090
 and of course you also the whole 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.669
 Substances at a certain time 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:13.560
 can settle 

00:04:10.669 --> 00:04:15.480
 before a match and then negative 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.609
 is tested so that for example the one 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:20.840
 not on it but that is really many 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:23.699
 many many natural bodybuilders and 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:27.050
 youtube stars and so on on fabric 

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:29.789
 But it is before the competitions 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:32.280
 is discontinued and not thereby 

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:35.699
 could not be prosecuted already hard 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:37.530
 so i am absolutely in favor of that 

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:40.500
 it's all in this direction to apples 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:42.750
 and he is not quite so extreme but rather 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:44.970
 he beautiful muscles defined muscles 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:47.370
 super six pack and not his 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:48.960
 growth hormone bellies that's all 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:52.320
 cool but the problem is that simple 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:54.090
 even there in the elite circle 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.650
 until it is no longer doped and 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:58.770
 is not easy in my opinion 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:00.210
 cool remains natural my girlfriend is 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:02.400
 I think right there that has rung 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:03.510
 i stay net school otherwise i can 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.100
 the girlfriend cut me off 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:08.400
