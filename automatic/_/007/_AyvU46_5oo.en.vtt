heal<00:04:21.790> I<00:04:22.090> prefer<00:04:22.990> I<00:04:23.169> like<00:04:23.350> the<00:04:23.470> heal<00:04:23.590> think<00:04:23.830> it's

heal I prefer I like the heal think it's

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:25.200 
heal I prefer I like the heal think it's
an<00:04:24.010> interesting<00:04:24.160> strategy<00:04:24.610> it's<00:04:24.970> a<00:04:25.000> little

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
an interesting strategy it's a little

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:28.200 
an interesting strategy it's a little
different<00:04:25.919> the<00:04:26.919> definitely<00:04:27.520> the<00:04:27.730> bombs<00:04:27.940> are

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.210 
different the definitely the bombs are

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:29.730 
different the definitely the bombs are
easier<00:04:28.450> to<00:04:28.480> use<00:04:28.690> the<00:04:28.900> throwing<00:04:29.230> ones<00:04:29.410> the

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:29.740 
easier to use the throwing ones the

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.159 
easier to use the throwing ones the
sticky<00:04:30.040> grenades<00:04:30.419> far<00:04:31.419> easier<00:04:31.570> to<00:04:31.810> use<00:04:32.020> them

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:32.169 
sticky grenades far easier to use them

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:33.480 
sticky grenades far easier to use them
that<00:04:32.260> healing<00:04:32.620> balm<00:04:32.770> but<00:04:33.040> the<00:04:33.100> healing<00:04:33.370> balm

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:33.490 
that healing balm but the healing balm

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:34.980 
that healing balm but the healing balm
allows<00:04:33.790> for<00:04:33.970> some<00:04:34.090> really<00:04:34.360> great<00:04:34.540> out<00:04:34.750> plays

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:34.990 
allows for some really great out plays

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:36.900 
allows for some really great out plays
in<00:04:35.169> my<00:04:35.260> opinion<00:04:35.620> if<00:04:35.680> you<00:04:35.740> can<00:04:35.860> throw<00:04:36.100> it<00:04:36.310> get<00:04:36.850> a

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:36.910 
in my opinion if you can throw it get a

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:44.550 
in my opinion if you can throw it get a
good<00:04:37.030> fight<00:04:37.210> off<00:04:38.820> you<00:04:39.820> can<00:04:39.970> really<00:04:40.210> win<00:04:43.560> throw

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 
good fight off you can really win throw

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:45.750 
good fight off you can really win throw
that<00:04:44.710> down<00:04:44.800> give<00:04:45.040> him<00:04:45.130> some<00:04:45.280> health<00:04:45.460> when<00:04:45.730> it

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:45.760 
that down give him some health when it

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:47.490 
that down give him some health when it
right<00:04:45.970> when<00:04:46.060> he<00:04:46.090> gets<00:04:46.270> up<00:04:46.450> and<00:04:46.660> a<00:04:46.990> nice<00:04:47.200> victory

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:47.500 
right when he gets up and a nice victory

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:50.040 
right when he gets up and a nice victory
for<00:04:47.860> our<00:04:47.950> team<00:04:48.220> I<00:04:48.669> don't<00:04:49.240> think<00:04:49.510> I<00:04:49.630> was<00:04:49.810> the<00:04:49.930> one

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.050

out<00:05:08.650> playing<00:05:08.950> but<00:05:09.460> I<00:05:09.490> was<00:05:09.700> with<00:05:09.910> him<00:05:10.060> couple

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:10.360 
out playing but I was with him couple

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:11.820 
out playing but I was with him couple
times<00:05:10.630> and<00:05:10.960> you<00:05:11.110> know<00:05:11.229> two<00:05:11.290> or<00:05:11.500> three<00:05:11.710> of<00:05:11.770> those

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:11.830 
times and you know two or three of those

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:13.500 
times and you know two or three of those
kills<00:05:12.100> could<00:05:12.250> have<00:05:12.340> gotten<00:05:12.490> to<00:05:12.610> me<00:05:12.640> as<00:05:13.180> opposed

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:16.620 
to him so honestly was a lot closer than
it<00:05:15.280> looks<00:05:15.430> like<00:05:15.610> I<00:05:15.760> was<00:05:15.910> fourth<00:05:16.210> from<00:05:16.330> the<00:05:16.390> team
