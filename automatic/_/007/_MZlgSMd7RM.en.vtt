00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:26.100
 hello there is no time again with you 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.320
 today's small release we 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.820
 analyze the chronology of events in detail 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.340
 upcoming additions 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.070
 the video is mostly about who 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.440
 still catching up why the trawl was not 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.880
 in that recently released video 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.890
 warlords of draenor 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:47.160
 so you can read this issue 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:49.530
 a bonus to the past and so we have 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.500
 a certain chronology of our events 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.920
 time since the first warcraft 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.690
 and before the events of the leaders of the draenor before 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.239
 the plot of the first warcraft 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:03.300
 the arches drink the blood of the demon beast and 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.850
 invade azerot further between 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.520
 the events of pandaria ivar of the lords garrosh 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.220
 escapes from detention and goes sky 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.500
 once back to the past at a time when 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:17.190
 the orcs have not yet drunk the aromatic drink 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:20.159
 mannoroth persuading thunder from the past not 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:21.600
 drink blood harrosh changes the course of events and 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.970
 thereby creating 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.910
 alternative timeline which 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.760
 absolutely will not affect our world 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:32.700
 that means no altered 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:36.570
 Arthas and the Danes will not they all 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:39.420
 same dead the last stage becomes 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.790
 creating a portal that connects this 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.650
 alternate reality with our and 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.010
 whereupon it begins 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:49.290
 confrontation of two worlds 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:52.550
 thank you garrosh for the new addition 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.550
 could so 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.360
 Well, pseudo oldies who played 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:01.270
 only in the third warcraft and never in 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:03.549
 my eyes did not see you here is my advice 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.500
 before you throw meaningless 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:08.170
 insults towards blizzard 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.959
 try to google at least first as 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:15.310
 The plot is currently developing. 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:17.470
 universe of warcraft to blizzard sometimes 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:20.080
 rewrite minor events in 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:22.390
 lore but completely cross out the plot 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.599
 the third warcraft as such 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:27.400
 you might think 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:28.150
 trawl and should not have been this 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.330
 video clip 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:34.600
 their battle with the mono company was long over and ours 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:37.360
 bromine is still dead it's different 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:41.220
 timeline plot does not correspond 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.220
 and continues to evolve 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.740
 I hope that I could at least somebody 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:49.960
 reason throw this video to everyone who 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:53.230
 still thinks that the Blizzards rewrote 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:56.880
 the plot of warcraft real orcs always 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:03:02.550
 heed the words of the sage do you not garrosh 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:03.700
 the words of a fool you wanted to say yes go you 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:06.070
