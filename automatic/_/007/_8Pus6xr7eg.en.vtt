when<00:01:34.100> I<00:01:34.159> was<00:01:34.430> drinking<00:01:34.760> my<00:01:35.090> tea<00:01:35.150> and<00:01:35.540> sitting

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
when I was drinking my tea and sitting

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.450 
when I was drinking my tea and sitting
here<00:01:36.050> and<00:01:36.200> I<00:01:36.260> found<00:01:36.530> something<00:01:36.770> poking<00:01:37.340> out

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
here and I found something poking out

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.590 
here and I found something poking out
from<00:01:37.490> here<00:01:38.080> it<00:01:39.080> is<00:01:39.200> another<00:01:39.470> spike<00:01:39.800> so<00:01:40.600> it's

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
from here it is another spike so it's

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.080 
from here it is another spike so it's
very<00:01:41.840> thrilling<00:01:42.229> and<00:01:42.740> as<00:01:43.310> you<00:01:43.700> can<00:01:43.880> see<00:01:44.060> I

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
very thrilling and as you can see I

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.930 
very thrilling and as you can see I
think<00:01:44.240> this<00:01:44.630> is<00:01:44.810> a<00:01:44.840> root<00:01:45.340> that's<00:01:46.340> growing<00:01:46.700> out

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:46.940 
think this is a root that's growing out

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.300 
think this is a root that's growing out
from<00:01:47.540> there

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
from there

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.499 
from there
so<00:01:49.310> the<00:01:49.490> spikes<00:01:50.440> spike<00:01:51.440> spike

00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:52.509 
so the spikes spike spike

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:58.180 
so the spikes spike spike
yes<00:01:53.950> phul<00:01:55.570> so<00:01:56.570> I<00:01:56.990> think<00:01:57.530> there's<00:01:57.890> something

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:58.190 
yes phul so I think there's something

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:05.770 
yes phul so I think there's something
here<00:01:58.220> -<00:01:58.640> yes<00:01:59.740> here<00:02:00.740> also<00:02:02.950> let's<00:02:03.950> see<00:02:04.780> yes

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
here - yes here also let's see yes

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.660 
here - yes here also let's see yes
coming<00:02:06.320> out<00:02:06.410> from<00:02:06.619> between<00:02:06.800> those<00:02:07.250> two<00:02:07.520> is

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
coming out from between those two is

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:13.600 
coming out from between those two is
another<00:02:07.970> spike<00:02:08.690> peeking<00:02:09.170> out<00:02:09.880> so<00:02:10.880> one<00:02:12.610> two

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
another spike peeking out so one two

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:21.160 
another spike peeking out so one two
three<00:02:14.440> and<00:02:16.720> four<00:02:18.040> definitely<00:02:19.390> now<00:02:20.390> the<00:02:20.959> white

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
three and four definitely now the white

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.280 
three and four definitely now the white
orchid<00:02:21.739> had<00:02:22.190> completely<00:02:22.760> lost<00:02:22.940> its<00:02:23.420> flowers

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
orchid had completely lost its flowers

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.000 
orchid had completely lost its flowers
the<00:02:24.680> leaves<00:02:24.890> are<00:02:25.100> huge<00:02:25.489> and<00:02:26.269> I<00:02:27.230> cut<00:02:27.830> off<00:02:27.980> the

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
the leaves are huge and I cut off the

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.449 
the leaves are huge and I cut off the
top<00:02:28.370> there<00:02:28.700> and<00:02:29.090> you<00:02:29.600> see<00:02:29.840> there's<00:02:30.080> nothing<00:02:30.459> no

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
top there and you see there's nothing no

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:34.150 
top there and you see there's nothing no
spikes<00:02:31.820> on<00:02:32.060> that<00:02:32.239> one<00:02:32.540> and<00:02:33.260> we<00:02:33.530> wait<00:02:33.829> and<00:02:34.010> see

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
spikes on that one and we wait and see

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.960 
spikes on that one and we wait and see
what<00:02:34.340> happens

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
what happens

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.240 
what happens
apparently<00:02:35.750> if<00:02:35.810> you<00:02:35.930> cut<00:02:36.110> it<00:02:36.260> off<00:02:36.410> there<00:02:36.769> they

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
apparently if you cut it off there they

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.180 
apparently if you cut it off there they
should<00:02:37.430> further<00:02:37.760> have<00:02:38.060> spikes<00:02:38.829> he<00:02:39.829> has<00:02:39.920> then

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
should further have spikes he has then

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.990 
should further have spikes he has then
drove<00:02:40.400> viens<00:02:40.730> it's<00:02:41.480> lost<00:02:41.750> one<00:02:41.989> of<00:02:42.019> its<00:02:42.230> spikes
