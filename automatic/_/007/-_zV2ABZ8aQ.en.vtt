 one is little two is good 7,200 is too much 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.490
 welcome to the comic book coppio I am 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.260
 glauber and today let's talk about the troop 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.289
 two green lanterns 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.279
 I'm here to welcome you 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:27.869
 at the beginning of the universe 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.269
 some natives of the planet malthus 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.949
 have become immortal and consequently 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.960
 They moved to the planet or and 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.520
 declared the guardians of the universe and 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.809
 no, they are not there 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.120
 with this they created a legion 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.770
 robotics called cosmic hunters to 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.329
 patrol the universe the androids 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.610
 turned out to be an ancient war 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.350
 which culminated in the planet or even 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.820
 guardians were able to stop them 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.410
 bandits of the universe for at least one 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.050
 time believing now that it would be 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.399
 necessary a troop of living creatures 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.440
 with free will and sense 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.160
 the guardians forged the battery 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.500
 central 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.420
 the rings of power will firm a few 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.940
 beings thus creating the 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:06.030
 green lanterns be chosen for their 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.130
 is the noblest of honors and is the 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.780
 greater responsibility 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.070
 however when an incursion into the 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.840
 planet Corinthians became 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.760
 Inevitably the need arose for the 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.820
 army and the guardians then divided 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.590
 the universe in 3,600 sectors recruiting 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.180
 in each of them the green lantern 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.110
 different and thus increasing its 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.729
 quota 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.590
 the green lanterns then patrolled 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.930
 universe of time and for more than three 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.520
 billion years and after a battle 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.439
 intense against parallax 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.390
 the exchange was rebuilt only this 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.070
 each sector began to have two 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.689
 Green Lanterns except for a few 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.079
 more populous sectors such as land 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:42.600
 has 41 total approximate 7,200 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:45.240
 green lanterns 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.060
 time imagine the sky of your planet in the 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.890
 most starry night industry is a thousand times 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.930
 bigger 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.610
 the green lantern name chosen by the 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.470
 own defendant must be a 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.450
 enough with great willpower and 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.310
 sense of justice and the ability to 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.350
 overcome fear and that is why we have 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.200
 the most diverse lantern races as 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.670
 planet soon and visit every recruit today 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.110
 is bound to go to the planet oe 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.940
 have to undergo strenuous training that 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.770
 usually not all survive and only 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.080
 then gain permission to patrol 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.180
 its sector and bear the troop symbol 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.830
 not even a while the mythology of the 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.300
 green lanterns has become so big and 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.980
 their stories so good that they 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.500
 have become the main engine of 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.569
 megas thank you like ring war a 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.670
 dense night and the clearest day to 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:28.080
 talk about the troop's powers first 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.640
 you need to understand a little about the 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.410
 emotional aspect a field 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.780
 electromagnetic divided into seven colors 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.730
 each trailer fed by the 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.709
 specific feelings of all 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.900
 sentient beings of the universe and each 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:41.819
 of these aspects has a creature that 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.280
 represents that it was exactly the 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:46.500
 created what the guardians did was 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.180
 use the green spectrum and then be 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.579
 symbiotic relationship of willpower and 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.440
 channels in their central battery 

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:54.720
 nourishes all of the individual 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.380
 each flashlight and that in turn in the trio 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.910
 their rings 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.489
 this explains why the others in the greens 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:01.350
 at one time were yellow fraction by 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:02.850
 inside the central battery had been 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:05.010
 imprisoned parallax 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:06.510
 the symbiont of the yellow spectrum of fear 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.010
 fitted with a power ring the flashlight 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.780
 green can then practically do 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.400
 anything having only its own 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.959
 willpower limit 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.910
 with this we can say that the ring 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:16.579
 is capable of generating energy shots 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:19.049
 force fields constructs 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:20.910
 hole invisibility worm serve 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:22.680
 as an encyclopedia galactic translator 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:25.019
 to generate a risk report and 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.790
 literally a myriad of things 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:28.320
 the only weakness that still persists for 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.810
 the lanterns beyond instability 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:33.150
 mental is the finite charge of their rings 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.829
 why they charge the battery 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.510
 individual and although it is not 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:38.250
 Most flashlights required 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:41.510
 green when carrying your ring utters the
