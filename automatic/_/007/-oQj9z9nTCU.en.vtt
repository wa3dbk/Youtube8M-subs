00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:03.210
 a pole fired a lot of roads after the first day 

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:04.810
 a 

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:09.400
 Nelleke Strings and the lady who bought days in in Lakers Bought That 

00:00:10.199 --> 00:00:14.569
 is has imported those lights should I say from America 

00:00:14.569 --> 00:00:18.849
 and before they knew it all the seized goods were beautiful here and this 

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:20.749
 prosecuted himself 

00:00:20.749 --> 00:00:25.489
 8 the judge said following the weather is that 

00:00:25.489 --> 00:00:29.949
 an article that happened and that is suitable for 80 he went 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:35.000
 I would buy against the rights and as with the blocker many times cheaper and many 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.430
 grind 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:40.830
 more threatening in my eyes than such a cute oil lamp 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:42.510
 next time I step 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.620
 completely armed with an all I can buy anywhere 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:48.570
 weapons 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.660
 enter the courtroom and i will show that it works is ridiculous 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.830
 that she favored me for this cute oil lamp 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:58.609
 I happen to come to the store very often 

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:02.410
 and she didnt find it a problem at all and now he had bought in 

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:06.780
 it was beaten up immediately and I said she is appealing 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:07.730
 appeal 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:11.340
 then see some pictures of what else is being sold and this while 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.520
 the rest of this month can start itself all in Amsterdam 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.330
 and in the shop window there is a good being sold 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.600
 If she brought things like this and gave her existence for it 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.450
 I understand 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:27.220
 in itself all its glory which is of church again what then under that lampshade 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.650
 because there is a significant difference 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:32.500
 If you have a Christmas musical this is the one 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.240
 let me say it is a gilt grenade 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.560
 but at the moment you invariably make sure that everything can be taken away again 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.880
 difference with those lamps 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.520
 yes if you enter the courtroom with those lamps then you know that via e-mail 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.530
 You always know your own country has dropped after a series of cartoons but yes it is 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.640
 probably but I am not saying that makes sense but I think that judge 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.999
 has judged how you will spend months in the store 

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:58.649
 yes if you were that country you would think back you think yes the dam funny one 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:01:59.750
 gun under mac 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.250
 but fortunately the circumstances regulators have taken into account 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.740
 not to give a paper shell, he will still get a cross after her name 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.710
 has been unable to go to america the netherlands was further behind that 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:12.049
 cross of that she 

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:16.180
 Anyway that's a headline so many words that before they go for this 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.809
 condition for the judge in rio on the rhine at lobith a bit naive if you 

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:24.260
 this kind of thing to do that I do not even understand all of them yet 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:25.850
 much worse is the fact that itself 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.920
 publisher activision felt stronger yet it is not a matter of both 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.360
 blocks this is just this is a tough week present on the couch 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.749
 and then the Netherlands would really be there 

00:02:35.749 --> 00:02:40.099
 It can be connected to an address in England I have heard more often 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:43.179
 that does not matter anything from the Netherlands, but you shouldn't be there anymore 

00:02:43.179 --> 00:02:47.609
 kind of stuff played guys like a criminal srits lukic i am me 

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:50.989
 don't understand the company you want shouldn't be the only one out there on the island 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:54.279
 they want you this fish that earlier in the years again 

00:02:54.279 --> 00:02:58.389
 Savings attracted more often operations look I understand her 

00:02:58.389 --> 00:02:59.719
 point of view 

00:02:59.719 --> 00:03:02.699
 totally certain for someone who is not at home and rightly so 

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:05.509
 but I also understand that there should be a bit of that 

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:09.179
 pay attention because it is suitable and that will be in the sentence language for threat yes
