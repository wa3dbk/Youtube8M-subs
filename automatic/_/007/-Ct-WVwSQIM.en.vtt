as<00:00:48.600> far<00:00:48.780> as<00:00:48.899> I<00:00:48.960> can<00:00:49.020> see<00:00:49.309> and<00:00:50.309> of<00:00:50.910> course<00:00:51.090> you

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
as far as I can see and of course you

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.360 
as far as I can see and of course you
control<00:00:51.510> with<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.750> computer<00:00:52.199> here<00:00:52.410> let's<00:00:53.250> go

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
control with the computer here let's go

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.049 
control with the computer here let's go
ahead<00:00:53.399> and<00:00:53.550> get<00:00:53.670> into<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:53.940> code<00:00:54.210> real<00:00:54.390> quick

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:56.059 
ahead and get into the code real quick

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:58.369 
ahead and get into the code real quick
first<00:00:57.059> thing<00:00:57.270> we<00:00:57.360> do<00:00:57.480> is<00:00:57.510> just<00:00:57.809> wrap<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.199> proof

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
first thing we do is just wrap the proof

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.520 
first thing we do is just wrap the proof
you'll<00:00:58.559> know<00:00:58.710> right<00:00:59.210> and<00:01:00.210> then<00:01:00.480> as<00:01:00.840> a<00:01:00.870> debulk<00:01:01.410> i

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
you'll know right and then as a debulk i

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.860 
you'll know right and then as a debulk i
just<00:01:01.710> say<00:01:01.829> started<00:01:02.309> and<00:01:03.210> when<00:01:03.359> you<00:01:03.449> do<00:01:03.660> that

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
just say started and when you do that

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.320 
just say started and when you do that
the<00:01:04.199> block<00:01:05.010> itself<00:01:05.189> as<00:01:05.790> you<00:01:05.939> can<00:01:06.060> see<00:01:06.210> up<00:01:06.299> here

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
the block itself as you can see up here

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.340 
the block itself as you can see up here
will<00:01:06.689> actually<00:01:07.549> broadcast<00:01:08.549> a<00:01:09.030> message<00:01:09.350> on

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
will actually broadcast a message on

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.840 
will actually broadcast a message on
your<00:01:10.530> server<00:01:10.740> so<00:01:10.979> it'll<00:01:11.159> say<00:01:11.280> started<00:01:11.640> or

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
your server so it'll say started or

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.660 
your server so it'll say started or
whatever<00:01:12.600> you<00:01:12.720> put<00:01:12.869> in<00:01:12.990> between<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.670> double

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
whatever you put in between the double

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.490 
whatever you put in between the double
quotes<00:01:14.760> on<00:01:14.970> this<00:01:15.200> string<00:01:16.200> here<00:01:18.259> then<00:01:19.259> we<00:01:19.380> go

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
quotes on this string here then we go

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.620 
quotes on this string here then we go
into<00:01:19.650> this<00:01:19.830> loop<00:01:20.189> and<00:01:20.460> we're<00:01:21.060> waiting<00:01:21.390> for<00:01:21.420> an

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
into this loop and we're waiting for an

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.950 
into this loop and we're waiting for an
OS<00:01:21.810> poll<00:01:22.020> event<00:01:22.290> of<00:01:22.439> chat<00:01:22.740> and<00:01:22.950> that<00:01:23.310> is<00:01:23.460> the

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
OS poll event of chat and that is the

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.810 
OS poll event of chat and that is the
event<00:01:24.960> that<00:01:25.259> the<00:01:25.560> chat<00:01:25.860> box<00:01:26.070> will<00:01:26.340> broadcast

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
event that the chat box will broadcast

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.010 
event that the chat box will broadcast
when<00:01:27.060> someone<00:01:27.360> says<00:01:27.540> something<00:01:27.570> on<00:01:27.960> the

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
when someone says something on the

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.469 
when someone says something on the
server<00:01:28.229> it<00:01:28.860> has<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.070> parameters<00:01:29.579> of<00:01:29.700> a<00:01:30.060> player

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
server it has the parameters of a player

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.749 
server it has the parameters of a player
name<00:01:30.750> and<00:01:30.930> a<00:01:31.320> message<00:01:31.680> and<00:01:31.920> you<00:01:32.490> can<00:01:32.610> see<00:01:32.729> that

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
name and a message and you can see that

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.840 
name and a message and you can see that
I've<00:01:32.970> printed<00:01:33.180> that<00:01:33.390> on<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.600> screen<00:01:33.900> here<00:01:33.930> and

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
I've printed that on the screen here and

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.609 
I've printed that on the screen here and
because<00:01:35.850> it<00:01:36.030> knows<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.390> player<00:01:36.869> named<00:01:37.200> you

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
because it knows the player named you

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.249 
because it knows the player named you
can<00:01:37.799> make<00:01:37.950> this<00:01:38.159> setup<00:01:38.640> player<00:01:39.060> specific<00:01:39.659> so

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
can make this setup player specific so

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.280 
can make this setup player specific so
it<00:01:40.500> will<00:01:40.650> only<00:01:40.860> work<00:01:41.400> if<00:01:41.670> I<00:01:42.509> were<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:42.990> one<00:01:43.110> that

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
it will only work if I were the one that

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.200 
it will only work if I were the one that
says<00:01:43.470> on<00:01:43.740> it<00:01:44.040> does<00:01:44.250> not<00:01:44.369> work<00:01:44.549> if<00:01:44.700> anyone<00:01:45.090> else

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
says on it does not work if anyone else

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.990 
says on it does not work if anyone else
on<00:01:45.420> my<00:01:45.540> server<00:01:45.780> were<00:01:46.140> to<00:01:46.320> say<00:01:46.470> on<00:01:46.880> and<00:01:47.880> that's

into the MF SS force field as you want
it<00:02:39.569> to<00:02:39.600> be<00:02:39.690> so<00:02:40.020> that<00:02:40.140> no<00:02:40.230> one<00:02:40.260> can<00:02:40.470> get<00:02:40.650> at<00:02:40.769> it

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
it to be so that no one can get at it

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.860

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
and access it as you can see my I'm

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.140 
and access it as you can see my I'm
breaking<00:02:43.170> this<00:02:43.290> here<00:02:43.590> I<00:02:43.800> cannot<00:02:44.640> still<00:02:45.000> go

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
breaking this here I cannot still go

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.070 
breaking this here I cannot still go
through<00:02:45.390> these<00:02:45.480> even<00:02:45.870> though<00:02:45.959> they're

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
through these even though they're

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.240 
through these even though they're
disappearing<00:02:46.410> for<00:02:46.680> a<00:02:46.709> second<00:02:46.980> the<00:02:47.100> force

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
disappearing for a second the force

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.440 
disappearing for a second the force
field<00:02:47.489> is<00:02:47.640> still<00:02:47.820> active<00:02:49.220> so<00:02:50.220> yeah<00:02:50.880> this<00:02:51.269> is

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
field is still active so yeah this is

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.170 
field is still active so yeah this is
just<00:02:51.630> a<00:02:51.769> nice<00:02:52.769> convenient<00:02:53.250> way<00:02:53.519> of<00:02:53.550> being<00:02:54.030> able

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
just a nice convenient way of being able

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.390 
just a nice convenient way of being able
to<00:02:54.300> use<00:02:54.420> the<00:02:54.540> chat<00:02:54.720> box<00:02:54.959> for<00:02:55.590> remote<00:02:56.220> access

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
to use the chat box for remote access

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.009 
to use the chat box for remote access
