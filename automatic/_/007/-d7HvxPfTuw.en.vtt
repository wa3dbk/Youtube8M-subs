for<00:00:35.309> my<00:00:35.430> students<00:00:35.910> but<00:00:36.540> really<00:00:36.930> a<00:00:37.079> thesis<00:00:37.620> is

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010

for my students but really a thesis is
not<00:00:38.340> as<00:00:38.520> scary<00:00:38.850> as<00:00:39.000> it<00:00:39.149> sounds<00:00:39.390> if<00:00:39.870> you

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
not as scary as it sounds if you

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.510
