00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:02.370 
all right so let's get looking at how we

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:03.860 
all right so let's get looking at how we
can<00:00:02.610> break<00:00:02.790> up<00:00:03.000> some<00:00:03.179> of<00:00:03.210> these<00:00:03.330> face<00:00:03.600> shapes

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:03.870 
can break up some of these face shapes

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.190 
can break up some of these face shapes
now<00:00:04.160> I'm<00:00:05.160> going<00:00:05.400> to<00:00:05.490> do<00:00:05.609> this<00:00:05.779> just<00:00:06.779> really

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
now I'm going to do this just really

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.430 
now I'm going to do this just really
quickly<00:00:07.410> to<00:00:08.370> to<00:00:08.910> show<00:00:09.090> you<00:00:09.150> the<00:00:09.360> the<00:00:09.690> idea<00:00:10.050> now

quickly to to show you the the idea now

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.110 
quickly to to show you the the idea now
the<00:00:10.500> animation<00:00:11.070> process<00:00:11.610> would<00:00:11.759> be<00:00:11.880> exactly

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
the animation process would be exactly

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.330 
the animation process would be exactly
the<00:00:12.269> same<00:00:12.450> as<00:00:12.540> what<00:00:12.719> we've<00:00:12.870> just<00:00:12.900> done<00:00:13.799> so<00:00:14.130> I'm

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
the same as what we've just done so I'm

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.310 
the same as what we've just done so I'm
going<00:00:14.519> to<00:00:14.610> edit<00:00:14.730> select<00:00:15.450> this<00:00:15.780> note<00:00:16.020> and<00:00:16.230> I'm

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
going to edit select this note and I'm

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.480 
going to edit select this note and I'm
just<00:00:16.470> going<00:00:16.590> to<00:00:16.650> delete<00:00:16.890> the<00:00:17.070> blend<00:00:17.279> shape

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
just going to delete the blend shape

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.040 
just going to delete the blend shape
nodes<00:00:17.730> so<00:00:17.940> that<00:00:18.090> we've<00:00:18.210> got<00:00:18.240> no<00:00:18.570> blend<00:00:18.840> shape

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
nodes so that we've got no blend shape

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.640 
nodes so that we've got no blend shape
on<00:00:19.320> this<00:00:19.859> any<00:00:20.250> longer<00:00:20.460> we've<00:00:20.760> still<00:00:21.000> got<00:00:21.180> our

on this any longer we've still got our
mouth<00:00:22.650> shape<00:00:23.010> in<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:24.000> skin<00:00:24.240> cluster<00:00:24.660> but

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
mouth shape in the skin cluster but

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.050 
mouth shape in the skin cluster but
that's<00:00:25.050> okay<00:00:25.380> now<00:00:26.099> all<00:00:26.460> I<00:00:26.519> really<00:00:26.849> want<00:00:27.000> to

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
show is how to break a symmetrical blend

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.049 
show is how to break a symmetrical blend
shape<00:00:30.570> and<00:00:30.779> all<00:00:30.990> these<00:00:31.199> are<00:00:31.410> symmetrical<00:00:32.059> into

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
shape and all these are symmetrical into

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.639 
shape and all these are symmetrical into
the<00:00:33.420> two<00:00:33.600> halves<00:00:33.840> into<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.260> left<00:00:34.469> and<00:00:34.530> the

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
the two halves into the left and the

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.130 
the two halves into the left and the

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
source space and then select the blend

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.439 
source space and then select the blend
shape<00:01:02.160> you<00:01:02.309> created<00:01:02.730> and<00:01:02.879> then<00:01:03.120> run<00:01:03.329> the

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
shape you created and then run the

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.570 
shape you created and then run the
script<00:01:03.719> so<00:01:04.320> all<00:01:04.559> we<00:01:04.680> have<00:01:04.830> to<00:01:04.949> do<00:01:05.070> is<00:01:05.369> select

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
script so all we have to do is select

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.190 
script so all we have to do is select
the<00:01:05.729> source<00:01:06.060> and<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.360> source<00:01:06.540> is<00:01:06.780> just<00:01:06.960> our

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
the source and the source is just our

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.230 
the source and the source is just our
original<00:01:07.619> then<00:01:08.220> we<00:01:08.400> select<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.729> blend<00:01:09.000> shape

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
original then we select the blend shape

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.760 
original then we select the blend shape
that<00:01:09.420> we<00:01:09.510> created<00:01:09.840> in<00:01:09.990> this<00:01:10.140> case<00:01:10.380> we<00:01:10.590> can<00:01:10.740> make

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
that we created in this case we can make

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.469 
that we created in this case we can make
the<00:01:11.040> smile<00:01:11.340> shape<00:01:11.610> so<00:01:11.820> it's<00:01:11.970> like<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.270> sauce

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
the smile shape so it's like the sauce

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.410 
the smile shape so it's like the sauce
first<00:01:12.750> shifts<00:01:13.380> like<00:01:13.500> a<00:01:13.890> smile<00:01:14.369> and<00:01:14.610> then<00:01:15.240> run

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
first shifts like a smile and then run

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.810 
first shifts like a smile and then run
the<00:01:15.540> script<00:01:16.100> so<00:01:17.100> I've<00:01:17.310> just<00:01:17.460> made<00:01:17.610> this<00:01:17.759> a

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
the script so I've just made this a

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.410 
the script so I've just made this a
shelf<00:01:18.119> button<00:01:18.450> and<00:01:18.780> I've<00:01:19.110> called<00:01:19.350> it<00:01:19.880> blend<00:01:20.880> em

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
shelf button and I've called it blend em

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.490 
shelf button and I've called it blend em
mirror<00:01:22.020> blend<00:01:22.259> and<00:01:22.560> we<00:01:23.220> just<00:01:23.369> hit<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.610> button

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
mirror blend and we just hit the button

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.380 
mirror blend and we just hit the button
okay<00:01:25.500> so<00:01:25.590> what<00:01:26.310> that's<00:01:26.460> done<00:01:26.759> is<00:01:27.030> it's<00:01:27.060> come

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
okay so what that's done is it's come

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.940 
okay so what that's done is it's come
down<00:01:27.420> here<00:01:27.869> and<00:01:28.140> it's<00:01:28.290> created<00:01:28.619> these<00:01:28.710> two

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
down here and it's created these two

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.130 
down here and it's created these two
shapes<00:01:29.280> so<00:01:29.640> if<00:01:30.180> I<00:01:30.329> bring<00:01:30.540> them<00:01:30.630> out<00:01:30.810> it's<00:01:31.020> done

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
shapes so if I bring them out it's done

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.319 
shapes so if I bring them out it's done
in<00:01:31.259> either<00:01:31.380> side<00:01:31.710> of<00:01:31.740> that<00:01:31.860> so<00:01:32.250> if<00:01:32.759> I<00:01:32.970> was<00:01:33.119> to<00:01:33.210> do

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
in either side of that so if I was to do

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.240 
in either side of that so if I was to do
that<00:01:33.360> again<00:01:33.810> just<00:01:34.049> to<00:01:34.650> make<00:01:34.680> that<00:01:34.920> a<00:01:34.979> little

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
that again just to make that a little

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.800 
that again just to make that a little
bit<00:01:35.400> easier<00:01:35.579> we<00:01:35.970> can<00:01:36.090> put<00:01:36.240> this<00:01:36.329> down<00:01:36.570> here

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
bit easier we can put this down here

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.990 
bit easier we can put this down here
it's<00:01:37.229> like<00:01:37.380> that<00:01:37.590> guy<00:01:37.770> and<00:01:38.070> then<00:01:38.280> that<00:01:38.490> guy<00:01:38.670> and

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
it's like that guy and then that guy and

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.749 
it's like that guy and then that guy and
then<00:01:39.180> hit<00:01:39.360> blend<00:01:40.009> you<00:01:41.009> can<00:01:41.159> see<00:01:41.369> what<00:01:41.610> it's

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
then hit blend you can see what it's

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.210 
then hit blend you can see what it's
actually<00:01:41.909> done<00:01:42.240> it's<00:01:42.509> actually<00:01:43.159> sort<00:01:44.159> of

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
actually done it's actually sort of

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.789 
actually done it's actually sort of
changed<00:01:44.670> these<00:01:44.850> these<00:01:45.720> shapes<00:01:46.020> from<00:01:46.259> right<00:01:46.770> to

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
changed these these shapes from right to

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.800 
changed these these shapes from right to
left<00:01:46.979> now<00:01:47.820> I'm<00:01:48.119> just<00:01:48.299> going<00:01:48.450> to<00:01:48.540> undo<00:01:48.780> that

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
left now I'm just going to undo that

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.170 
left now I'm just going to undo that
because<00:01:49.290> notice<00:01:50.100> that<00:01:50.340> I've<00:01:50.579> done<00:01:50.820> something

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
because notice that I've done something

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.020 
because notice that I've done something
wrong<00:01:51.570> here<00:01:51.869> and<00:01:52.049> that<00:01:52.590> is<00:01:52.740> that<00:01:52.979> by<00:01:53.399> default

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
wrong here and that is that by default

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.600 
wrong here and that is that by default
our<00:01:54.450> mouth<00:01:54.810> is<00:01:55.020> not<00:01:55.200> set<00:01:55.439> to<00:01:55.470> zero<00:01:55.799> so<00:01:56.100> we've

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
our mouth is not set to zero so we've

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.039 
our mouth is not set to zero so we've
got<00:01:56.759> to<00:01:56.850> come<00:01:56.969> in<00:01:57.119> here<00:01:57.299> with<00:01:57.420> that<00:01:57.540> joint<00:01:57.810> and

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
got to come in here with that joint and

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.200 
got to come in here with that joint and
just<00:01:58.140> make<00:01:58.469> sure<00:01:58.500> that<00:01:59.009> it's<00:01:59.610> there<00:01:59.820> in<00:01:59.969> fact

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
just make sure that it's there in fact

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.179 
just make sure that it's there in fact
just<00:02:00.450> to<00:02:00.540> be<00:02:00.659> safe<00:02:00.840> let's<00:02:01.049> unbind<00:02:01.710> this<00:02:01.920> mesh

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
just to be safe let's unbind this mesh

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.330 
just to be safe let's unbind this mesh
so<00:02:02.399> I'm<00:02:02.460> going<00:02:02.610> to<00:02:02.640> go<00:02:02.759> skin<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.600> touch<00:02:03.780> skin

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
so I'm going to go skin the touch skin

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.429 
so I'm going to go skin the touch skin
to<00:02:05.340> just<00:02:05.549> make<00:02:05.790> sure<00:02:05.820> that<00:02:06.299> that<00:02:06.689> meshes<00:02:07.079> back

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
to just make sure that that meshes back

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.520 
to just make sure that that meshes back
to<00:02:07.560> its<00:02:07.710> original<00:02:07.829> state<00:02:08.250> so<00:02:09.149> I<00:02:09.899> select<00:02:10.410> this

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
to its original state so I select this

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:11.500 
to its original state so I select this
one<00:02:10.590> and<00:02:10.950> then<00:02:11.280> the

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
one and then the

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.570 
one and then the
one<00:02:11.659> and<00:02:11.930> then<00:02:12.140> hit<00:02:12.409> our<00:02:12.650> blend<00:02:13.069> mirror<00:02:13.280> button

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
one and then hit our blend mirror button

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.660 
one and then hit our blend mirror button
and<00:02:13.849> that<00:02:14.720> will<00:02:14.870> make<00:02:15.019> nicely<00:02:15.560> now<00:02:15.709> our<00:02:16.400> left

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
and that will make nicely now our left

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.949 
and that will make nicely now our left
and<00:02:16.879> our<00:02:17.000> right<00:02:17.470> faces<00:02:18.470> and<00:02:18.650> this<00:02:18.709> is<00:02:18.860> nicely

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
and our right faces and this is nicely

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:24.429 
and our right faces and this is nicely
underscore<00:02:20.959> LF<00:02:21.290> T<00:02:21.470> has<00:02:21.799> caught<00:02:22.129> our<00:02:22.489> GT<00:02:23.439> nicely

00:02:24.429 --> 00:02:24.439 
underscore LF T has caught our GT nicely

00:02:24.439 --> 00:02:26.440 
underscore LF T has caught our GT nicely
for<00:02:24.650> us<00:02:24.769> so<00:02:25.340> we<00:02:25.519> could<00:02:25.670> then<00:02:25.819> just<00:02:26.030> plug<00:02:26.269> those

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
for us so we could then just plug those

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.449 
for us so we could then just plug those
straight<00:02:26.900> back<00:02:27.079> into<00:02:27.349> the<00:02:27.470> face<00:02:27.709> and<00:02:28.069> now<00:02:28.400> we

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:28.459 
straight back into the face and now we

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:30.670 
straight back into the face and now we
have<00:02:28.700> left<00:02:29.030> and<00:02:29.180> right<00:02:29.329> faces<00:02:29.780> that's<00:02:30.349> really

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
have left and right faces that's really

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.600 
have left and right faces that's really
about<00:02:30.799> as<00:02:31.010> easy<00:02:31.159> it<00:02:31.370> is<00:02:31.519> as<00:02:31.730> it<00:02:32.060> is<00:02:32.090> now<00:02:32.900> just<00:02:33.610> to

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
about as easy it is as it is now just to

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.250 
about as easy it is as it is now just to
give<00:02:35.000> you<00:02:35.090> a<00:02:35.180> little<00:02:35.450> bit<00:02:35.629> more<00:02:35.840> of<00:02:35.900> a<00:02:35.959> demo<00:02:36.170> on

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
give you a little bit more of a demo on

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:37.599 
give you a little bit more of a demo on
this<00:02:36.440> one<00:02:36.620> and<00:02:36.739> bring<00:02:36.890> these<00:02:37.069> down<00:02:37.250> a<00:02:37.310> little

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:37.609 
this one and bring these down a little

00:02:37.609 --> 00:02:40.599 
this one and bring these down a little
bit<00:02:38.200> one<00:02:39.200> more<00:02:39.379> thing<00:02:39.590> to<00:02:39.709> know<00:02:39.859> about<00:02:39.890> is<00:02:40.370> to

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:40.609 
bit one more thing to know about is to

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:42.280 
bit one more thing to know about is to
select<00:02:40.819> the<00:02:41.150> saw<00:02:41.599> shape<00:02:41.810> first<00:02:42.019> and<00:02:42.230> this

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
select the saw shape first and this

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.979 
select the saw shape first and this
one's<00:02:42.500> second<00:02:42.920> and<00:02:43.159> this<00:02:43.790> time<00:02:44.030> when<00:02:44.420> we<00:02:44.450> open

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:44.989 
one's second and this time when we open

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:47.020 
one's second and this time when we open
up<00:02:45.049> the<00:02:45.200> script<00:02:45.590> we're<00:02:45.980> going<00:02:46.129> to<00:02:46.190> right<00:02:46.819> click

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
up the script we're going to right click

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:48.970 
up the script we're going to right click
on<00:02:47.150> that<00:02:47.209> just<00:02:47.359> so<00:02:47.599> I<00:02:47.690> can<00:02:47.900> see<00:02:48.079> it<00:02:48.200> and<00:02:48.739> we<00:02:48.829> can

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
on that just so I can see it and we can

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.860 
on that just so I can see it and we can
change<00:02:49.159> this<00:02:49.370> percentage<00:02:49.940> range<00:02:50.209> so<00:02:50.659> let's

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
change this percentage range so let's

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.119 
change this percentage range so let's
turn<00:02:51.139> the<00:02:51.290> shots<00:02:51.500> of<00:02:51.620> something<00:02:51.829> like<00:02:51.950> point

00:02:52.119 --> 00:02:52.129 
turn the shots of something like point

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:54.910 
turn the shots of something like point
six<00:02:52.720> just<00:02:53.720> to<00:02:53.870> sort<00:02:54.019> of<00:02:54.109> see<00:02:54.440> if<00:02:54.530> we<00:02:54.620> can<00:02:54.769> find

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
six just to sort of see if we can find

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.449 
six just to sort of see if we can find
something<00:02:55.340> that's<00:02:55.489> a<00:02:55.579> little<00:02:55.760> bit<00:02:56.030> more

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
something that's a little bit more

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:00.250 
something that's a little bit more
extreme<00:02:58.459> and<00:02:58.819> I'm<00:02:59.359> going<00:02:59.629> to<00:02:59.690> run<00:02:59.870> this<00:02:59.959> script

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
extreme and I'm going to run this script

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.879 
extreme and I'm going to run this script
again<00:03:01.060> and<00:03:02.060> now<00:03:02.569> what<00:03:02.750> you'll<00:03:02.900> see<00:03:03.109> is<00:03:03.409> that<00:03:03.470> it

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:03.889 
again and now what you'll see is that it

00:03:03.889 --> 00:03:07.210 
again and now what you'll see is that it
actually<00:03:04.099> has<00:03:05.060> tried<00:03:05.659> to<00:03:05.810> blend<00:03:06.109> each<00:03:06.799> side

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
actually has tried to blend each side

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:08.979 
actually has tried to blend each side
off<00:03:07.430> a<00:03:07.639> little<00:03:07.790> bit<00:03:07.940> more<00:03:08.150> on<00:03:08.239> out<00:03:08.389> point<00:03:08.750> six

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989 
off a little bit more on out point six

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:10.210 
off a little bit more on out point six
is<00:03:09.079> a<00:03:09.109> bit<00:03:09.290> extreme<00:03:09.470> you<00:03:09.769> can<00:03:09.920> see<00:03:10.069> it's

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
is a bit extreme you can see it's

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.309 
is a bit extreme you can see it's
actually<00:03:10.400> even<00:03:10.909> eating<00:03:11.239> in<00:03:11.359> a<00:03:11.569> little<00:03:12.200> bit

00:03:12.309 --> 00:03:12.319 
actually even eating in a little bit

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:14.680 
actually even eating in a little bit
more<00:03:12.500> to<00:03:12.709> this<00:03:12.859> side<00:03:13.159> and<00:03:13.489> this<00:03:14.209> side<00:03:14.269> you<00:03:14.480> can

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
more to this side and this side you can

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:15.939 
more to this side and this side you can
sort<00:03:14.870> of<00:03:14.900> see<00:03:15.019> it<00:03:15.109> starting<00:03:15.440> to<00:03:15.470> come<00:03:15.530> up<00:03:15.769> but

00:03:15.939 --> 00:03:15.949 
sort of see it starting to come up but

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:17.530 
sort of see it starting to come up but
can<00:03:16.489> you<00:03:16.549> see<00:03:16.699> the<00:03:16.819> difference<00:03:17.180> here<00:03:17.389> between

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
can you see the difference here between

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.650 
can you see the difference here between
two<00:03:18.019> faces<00:03:18.530> is<00:03:18.829> that<00:03:19.280> its<00:03:19.819> blend<00:03:20.209> there's<00:03:20.569> a

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
two faces is that its blend there's a

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:23.229 
two faces is that its blend there's a
blend<00:03:20.959> threshold<00:03:21.590> distance<00:03:21.829> and<00:03:22.370> that's<00:03:22.970> what

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 
blend threshold distance and that's what

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:25.869 
blend threshold distance and that's what
that<00:03:23.870> point<00:03:24.230> that<00:03:24.799> decimal<00:03:25.190> place<00:03:25.430> is<00:03:25.609> up<00:03:25.730> here

00:03:25.869 --> 00:03:25.879 
that point that decimal place is up here

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:27.819 
that point that decimal place is up here
so<00:03:26.090> just<00:03:26.120> change<00:03:26.540> that<00:03:26.720> to<00:03:27.139> tweak<00:03:27.680> your

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:27.829 
so just change that to tweak your

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:30.819 
so just change that to tweak your
settings<00:03:28.239> 0.3<00:03:29.239> is<00:03:29.720> pretty<00:03:30.079> good<00:03:30.290> I'd<00:03:30.560> probably

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:30.829 
settings 0.3 is pretty good I'd probably

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:33.490 
settings 0.3 is pretty good I'd probably
say<00:03:31.099> 0.3<00:03:32.090> we'd<00:03:32.480> go<00:03:32.720> between<00:03:32.870> point<00:03:33.290> one<00:03:33.470> and

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500 
say 0.3 we'd go between point one and

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.710 
say 0.3 we'd go between point one and
point<00:03:33.650> three<00:03:34.099> as<00:03:34.310> sort<00:03:34.879> of<00:03:34.910> a<00:03:35.030> maximum<00:03:35.480> I'm

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:35.720 
point three as sort of a maximum I'm

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.170 
point three as sort of a maximum I'm
gonna<00:03:36.169> leave<00:03:36.319> it<00:03:36.410> at<00:03:36.500> point<00:03:36.709> one<00:03:36.859> for<00:03:37.040> now<00:03:37.220> it's

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
gonna leave it at point one for now it's

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.330 
gonna leave it at point one for now it's
a<00:03:38.269> pretty<00:03:38.480> good<00:03:38.629> one<00:03:38.780> so<00:03:39.019> I<00:03:39.260> pleat<00:03:40.129> those

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 
a pretty good one so I pleat those

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:41.860 
a pretty good one so I pleat those
because<00:03:40.609> that<00:03:40.639> was<00:03:40.819> the<00:03:40.970> point<00:03:41.150> six<00:03:41.419> version

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
because that was the point six version

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.520 
because that was the point six version
sorry<00:03:42.829> that<00:03:43.040> one<00:03:43.160> and<00:03:43.280> that<00:03:43.310> one<00:03:44.379> bring<00:03:45.379> these

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
sorry that one and that one bring these

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:47.830 
sorry that one and that one bring these
guys<00:03:45.709> back<00:03:45.919> up<00:03:45.980> and<00:03:46.910> now<00:03:47.090> we<00:03:47.150> can<00:03:47.359> select<00:03:47.569> on

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
guys back up and now we can select on

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.720 
guys back up and now we can select on
that<00:03:48.139> size<00:03:48.410> face<00:03:48.680> that<00:03:48.980> side<00:03:49.190> face<00:03:49.459> I'm<00:03:49.669> just

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:49.730 
that size face that side face I'm just

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:51.430 
that size face that side face I'm just
gonna<00:03:49.940> make<00:03:50.120> one<00:03:50.180> a<00:03:50.480> brand<00:03:50.810> new<00:03:50.959> blend<00:03:51.199> shape

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 
gonna make one a brand new blend shape

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.289 
gonna make one a brand new blend shape
create<00:03:52.129> the<00:03:52.220> former's<00:03:52.579> blend<00:03:52.819> shape<00:03:53.000> with<00:03:53.150> the

00:03:53.289 --> 00:03:53.299 
create the former's blend shape with the

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:56.229 
create the former's blend shape with the
default<00:03:53.780> settings<00:03:54.139> and<00:03:54.549> now<00:03:55.549> as<00:03:55.760> we<00:03:55.879> can<00:03:56.030> come

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:56.239 
default settings and now as we can come

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:59.979 
default settings and now as we can come
in<00:03:56.359> here<00:03:56.510> select<00:03:56.810> that<00:03:57.109> edit<00:03:57.680> select<00:03:58.310> load<00:03:58.989> and

00:03:59.979 --> 00:03:59.989 
in here select that edit select load and

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:01.569 
in here select that edit select load and
we<00:04:00.169> can<00:04:00.290> see<00:04:00.500> that<00:04:00.650> we've<00:04:00.739> got<00:04:00.949> our<00:04:01.069> right<00:04:01.340> and

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:01.579 
we can see that we've got our right and

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:04.599 
we can see that we've got our right and
left<00:04:01.639> shape<00:04:02.150> and<00:04:02.500> that<00:04:03.500> should<00:04:03.799> be<00:04:03.980> identical

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:04.609 
left shape and that should be identical

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:06.899 
left shape and that should be identical
to<00:04:05.060> this<00:04:05.180> guy<00:04:05.389> here<00:04:05.629> so<00:04:05.840> if<00:04:05.930> ice<00:04:06.079> to<00:04:06.260> reset<00:04:06.620> that

00:04:06.899 --> 00:04:06.909 
to this guy here so if ice to reset that

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:09.009 
to this guy here so if ice to reset that
you<00:04:07.909> can<00:04:08.060> see<00:04:08.209> that<00:04:08.359> those<00:04:08.510> measures<00:04:08.750> are

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:09.019 
you can see that those measures are

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:12.129 
you can see that those measures are
identical<00:04:10.479> it's<00:04:11.479> done<00:04:11.629> a<00:04:11.659> really<00:04:11.870> nice<00:04:12.079> job

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:12.139 
identical it's done a really nice job

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:14.500 
identical it's done a really nice job
for<00:04:12.590> us<00:04:12.620> and<00:04:12.709> this<00:04:13.400> is<00:04:13.549> a<00:04:13.579> massive<00:04:14.000> lifesaver

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:14.510 
for us and this is a massive lifesaver

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:17.170 
for us and this is a massive lifesaver
so<00:04:14.780> I<00:04:14.810> prefer<00:04:15.530> to<00:04:15.919> model<00:04:16.220> blend<00:04:16.970> shapes

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:17.180 
so I prefer to model blend shapes

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:19.810 
so I prefer to model blend shapes
symmetrical<00:04:17.780> symmetrically<00:04:18.650> either<00:04:18.979> in<00:04:19.280> Maya

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:19.820 
symmetrical symmetrically either in Maya

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:22.180 
symmetrical symmetrically either in Maya
or<00:04:20.150> in<00:04:20.269> Mudbox<00:04:20.479> it<00:04:20.810> just<00:04:21.019> shows<00:04:21.799> you<00:04:21.979> what<00:04:22.070> the

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.190 
or in Mudbox it just shows you what the

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:24.460 
or in Mudbox it just shows you what the
shape<00:04:22.400> will<00:04:22.580> look<00:04:22.610> like<00:04:22.940> nicely<00:04:23.510> and

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:24.470 
shape will look like nicely and

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:25.930 
shape will look like nicely and
we<00:04:24.560> can<00:04:24.740> use<00:04:24.860> this<00:04:25.070> mirror<00:04:25.370> left<00:04:25.610> and<00:04:25.790> right

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:25.940 
we can use this mirror left and right

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:28.750 
we can use this mirror left and right
script<00:04:26.240> just<00:04:26.900> to<00:04:27.080> export<00:04:27.530> them<00:04:27.680> back<00:04:28.010> onto<00:04:28.460> our

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:28.760 
script just to export them back onto our

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.000 
script just to export them back onto our
shapes<00:04:29.180> and<00:04:29.450> now<00:04:29.690> we<00:04:29.750> have<00:04:30.020> a<00:04:30.290> symmetrical

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.010 
shapes and now we have a symmetrical

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:32.980 
shapes and now we have a symmetrical
control<00:04:31.490> so<00:04:31.760> we<00:04:32.270> will<00:04:32.390> have<00:04:32.540> a<00:04:32.600> slightly

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:32.990 
control so we will have a slightly

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:35.470 
control so we will have a slightly
asymmetrical<00:04:33.770> face<00:04:34.010> we<00:04:34.640> can<00:04:34.820> kind<00:04:35.060> of<00:04:35.120> come<00:04:35.300> in

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:35.480 
asymmetrical face we can kind of come in

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:37.420 
asymmetrical face we can kind of come in
and<00:04:35.660> do<00:04:35.750> that<00:04:35.780> and<00:04:36.110> have<00:04:36.290> a<00:04:36.320> slight<00:04:36.920> off

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:37.430 
and do that and have a slight off

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:39.910 
and do that and have a slight off
symmetry<00:04:38.030> and<00:04:38.240> animate<00:04:38.960> that<00:04:39.170> individually

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:39.920 
symmetry and animate that individually

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:41.560 
symmetry and animate that individually
so<00:04:40.250> there<00:04:40.610> you<00:04:40.670> go<00:04:40.730> there's<00:04:40.970> mirroring<00:04:41.330> blend

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:41.570 
so there you go there's mirroring blend

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:43.780 
so there you go there's mirroring blend
shapes
