was in this pile this goes inside the

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:31.890 
was in this pile this goes inside the
middle

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
middle

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.500 
middle
okay

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
okay

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.710 
okay
all<00:02:33.930> right<00:02:34.349> last<00:02:34.980> time<00:02:35.250> it<00:02:36.150> is<00:02:36.269> that<00:02:36.390> three

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
all right last time it is that three

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.259 
all right last time it is that three
times<00:02:37.430> now<00:02:38.430> of<00:02:38.549> course<00:02:38.730> is<00:02:38.940> you<00:02:39.000> might<00:02:39.150> be

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
times now of course is you might be

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:41.059 
times now of course is you might be
thinking<00:02:39.569> load<00:02:39.690> becomes<00:02:40.049> very<00:02:40.290> to<00:02:40.890> long

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.069 
thinking load becomes very to long

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:44.119 
thinking load becomes very to long
process<00:02:41.519> it<00:02:41.730> is<00:02:41.930> but<00:02:42.930> you<00:02:43.500> can<00:02:43.680> talk<00:02:43.890> we<00:02:44.099> can

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:44.129 
process it is but you can talk we can

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:46.100 
process it is but you can talk we can
make<00:02:44.340> the<00:02:44.430> story<00:02:44.700> of<00:02:44.879> it<00:02:45.030> you<00:02:45.720> can<00:02:45.840> make<00:02:45.870> it

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
make the story of it you can make it

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.550 
make the story of it you can make it
entertaining<00:02:46.400> it's<00:02:47.400> in<00:02:47.549> this<00:02:47.610> part<00:02:47.879> here<00:02:48.090> so

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
entertaining it's in this part here so

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.090 
entertaining it's in this part here so
gather<00:02:49.560> these<00:02:49.830> up

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
gather these up

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.550 
gather these up
this<00:02:51.670> goes<00:02:51.880> in<00:02:52.030> the<00:02:52.090> middle<00:02:52.210> again

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
this goes in the middle again

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.980 
this goes in the middle again
now<00:02:54.130> the<00:02:54.520> way<00:02:54.700> this<00:02:54.850> trick<00:02:55.120> works<00:02:55.360> is<00:02:55.780> the

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:55.990 
now the way this trick works is the

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:57.690 
now the way this trick works is the
really<00:02:56.200> key<00:02:56.380> way<00:02:56.560> is<00:02:56.860> that<00:02:57.069> it's<00:02:57.430> just<00:02:57.640> the

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
really key way is that it's just the

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.490 
really key way is that it's just the
Olympic<00:02:58.090> car<00:02:58.330> down<00:02:58.569> in<00:02:58.690> the<00:02:58.750> deck<00:02:58.900> if<00:02:59.380> you

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
Olympic car down in the deck if you

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.000 
Olympic car down in the deck if you
don't<00:02:59.740> deal<00:02:59.920> that<00:03:00.130> 11<00:03:00.490> cards<00:03:01.590> that's<00:03:02.590> the<00:03:02.770> card

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
don't deal that 11 cards that's the card

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.430 
don't deal that 11 cards that's the card
so<00:03:03.790> there<00:03:04.090> are<00:03:04.150> a<00:03:04.180> couple<00:03:04.209> ways<00:03:04.540> to<00:03:04.600> produce

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
so there are a couple ways to produce

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.500 
so there are a couple ways to produce
this<00:03:05.830> or<00:03:06.069> make<00:03:06.220> this<00:03:06.340> work<00:03:06.580> in<00:03:06.910> depth<00:03:07.150> till

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
this or make this work in depth till

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.080 
this or make this work in depth till
down<00:03:07.660> abracadabra<00:03:08.110> abracadabra<00:03:08.830> is<00:03:09.130> 11<00:03:09.459> okay

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
down abracadabra abracadabra is 11 okay

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.990 
down abracadabra abracadabra is 11 okay
