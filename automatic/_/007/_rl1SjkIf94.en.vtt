back then I appreciate that I did

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.859 
back then I appreciate that I did
factions<00:01:50.729> a<00:01:50.850> while<00:01:51.030> back<00:01:51.240> with<00:01:51.450> a<00:01:51.479> few<00:01:51.750> other

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
factions a while back with a few other

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.810 
factions a while back with a few other
youtubers<00:01:52.470> as<00:01:52.619> well<00:01:52.799> and<00:01:53.310> that<00:01:53.460> went<00:01:53.640> down

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
youtubers as well and that went down

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.969 
youtubers as well and that went down
pretty<00:01:54.090> well<00:01:54.420> I'm<00:01:54.780> but<00:01:55.079> it<00:01:55.200> kind<00:01:55.470> of<00:01:55.560> got<00:01:55.680> a<00:01:55.740> bit

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
pretty well I'm but it kind of got a bit

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.410 
pretty well I'm but it kind of got a bit
chaotic<00:01:56.250> at<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:56.820> end<00:01:56.969> I<00:01:57.149> guess<00:01:57.390> people

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
chaotic at the end I guess people

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.170 
chaotic at the end I guess people
started<00:01:58.079> like<00:01:58.290> saying<00:01:59.040> that<00:01:59.070> it<00:01:59.729> was<00:01:59.939> unfair

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
started like saying that it was unfair

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.330 
started like saying that it was unfair
because<00:02:00.719> people's<00:02:01.350> factions<00:02:01.890> were<00:02:02.040> attacking

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
because people's factions were attacking

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.069 
because people's factions were attacking
other<00:02:02.640> factions<00:02:03.210> and<00:02:03.479> all<00:02:03.570> that<00:02:03.719> sort<00:02:03.930> of

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
other factions and all that sort of

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.499 
other factions and all that sort of
stuff<00:02:04.140> so<00:02:04.649> uh<00:02:04.680> I'm<00:02:05.490> not<00:02:05.729> really<00:02:05.790> too<00:02:06.119> sure<00:02:06.149> what

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
stuff so uh I'm not really too sure what

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.180 
stuff so uh I'm not really too sure what
to<00:02:06.630> do<00:02:06.780> sava<00:02:07.140> wise<00:02:07.439> so<00:02:07.799> if<00:02:07.890> you<00:02:08.009> have<00:02:08.160> a

suggestion like I said let me know in

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.809 
suggestion like I said let me know in
the<00:02:09.989> comments<00:02:10.379> section<00:02:10.580> hopefully<00:02:11.580> we<00:02:11.670> can

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
the comments section hopefully we can

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.410 
the comments section hopefully we can
get<00:02:11.940> some<00:02:12.000> stuff<00:02:12.360> done<00:02:12.390> if

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
get some stuff done if

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.000 
get some stuff done if
you<00:02:13.780> know<00:02:13.870> maybe<00:02:14.020> factions<00:02:14.590> or<00:02:14.709> something

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
you know maybe factions or something

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:16.500 
you know maybe factions or something
that<00:02:15.099> people<00:02:15.400> want<00:02:15.640> them<00:02:15.849> we<00:02:15.970> can<00:02:16.120> bring<00:02:16.330> that

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
that people want them we can bring that

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.240 
that people want them we can bring that
back<00:02:16.750> are<00:02:17.050> but<00:02:17.290> there<00:02:17.440> will<00:02:17.470> literally<00:02:18.010> be

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
back are but there will literally be

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.490 
back are but there will literally be
like<00:02:18.280> no<00:02:18.670> rules<00:02:19.000> it's<00:02:19.270> literally<00:02:19.989> anything

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
like no rules it's literally anything

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.740 
like no rules it's literally anything
goes<00:02:20.950> but<00:02:21.880> I<00:02:21.910> guess<00:02:22.180> people<00:02:22.209> will<00:02:22.599> probably

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
goes but I guess people will probably

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.260 
goes but I guess people will probably
stop<00:02:23.230> playing<00:02:23.530> once<00:02:23.890> uh<00:02:24.190> you<00:02:24.819> know<00:02:24.940> they<00:02:25.090> lose

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
stop playing once uh you know they lose

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.300 
stop playing once uh you know they lose
some<00:02:25.540> things<00:02:25.870> so<00:02:26.140> maybe<00:02:26.319> pixelmon<00:02:26.920> might<00:02:27.130> be<00:02:27.280> a

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
some things so maybe pixelmon might be a

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:28.800 
some things so maybe pixelmon might be a
good<00:02:27.489> idea<00:02:27.550> you<00:02:28.150> think<00:02:28.360> that's<00:02:28.510> a<00:02:28.569> good<00:02:28.660> idea

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
good idea you think that's a good idea

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.690 
good idea you think that's a good idea
let<00:02:29.200> me<00:02:29.290> know<00:02:29.440> in<00:02:29.590> the<00:02:29.620> comment<00:02:30.010> section<00:02:30.459> and

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
let me know in the comment section and

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.760 
let me know in the comment section and
we<00:02:31.209> can<00:02:31.360> potentially<00:02:31.510> get<00:02:32.020> that<00:02:32.080> done<00:02:32.410> as<00:02:32.590> well

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:32.770 
we can potentially get that done as well

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:34.650 
we can potentially get that done as well
pick<00:02:33.040> someone<00:02:33.340> seems<00:02:33.580> like<00:02:33.819> one<00:02:34.390> of<00:02:34.420> the

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
pick someone seems like one of the

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.330 
pick someone seems like one of the
probably<00:02:34.900> the<00:02:35.140> better<00:02:35.410> options<00:02:35.920> i<00:02:36.069> did<00:02:36.250> it

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
probably the better options i did it

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.220 
probably the better options i did it
with<00:02:36.459> a<00:02:36.489> few<00:02:36.730> other<00:02:36.880> youtubers<00:02:37.480> before<00:02:37.900> our

with a few other youtubers before our

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:39.720 
with a few other youtubers before our
while<00:02:38.650> back<00:02:38.920> I<00:02:39.069> don't<00:02:39.130> know<00:02:39.370> if<00:02:39.459> we<00:02:39.550> made

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
while back I don't know if we made

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.640 
while back I don't know if we made
videos<00:02:40.090> on<00:02:40.239> I<00:02:40.269> think<00:02:40.450> we<00:02:40.690> did<00:02:40.810> make<00:02:41.050> videos<00:02:41.380> on

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
videos on I think we did make videos on

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.729 
videos on I think we did make videos on
it<00:02:41.680> was<00:02:41.980> like<00:02:42.100> meas<00:02:42.310> way<00:02:42.640> itani<00:02:43.120> Jessie<00:02:43.780> net<00:02:44.440> um

it was like meas way itani Jessie net um

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:46.740 
it was like meas way itani Jessie net um
and<00:02:45.400> that<00:02:45.580> was<00:02:45.700> pretty<00:02:45.880> fun<00:02:46.150> as<00:02:46.300> white<00:02:46.420> went<00:02:46.630> on

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
and that was pretty fun as white went on

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.210 
and that was pretty fun as white went on
for<00:02:46.959> a<00:02:46.989> long<00:02:47.140> time<00:02:47.380> I'm<00:02:47.620> gonna<00:02:47.800> be<00:02:47.950> doing<00:02:48.040> these

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
for a long time I'm gonna be doing these

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.250

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
videos on my own most likely because I

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:51.509 
videos on my own most likely because I
don't<00:02:50.410> really<00:02:50.530> know<00:02:50.709> anyone<00:02:50.920> that<00:02:51.220> no<00:02:51.370> clue
