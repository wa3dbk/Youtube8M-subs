00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
just one-handed spins so things like

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.549 
just one-handed spins so things like
these<00:00:26.540> they<00:00:27.540> can<00:00:27.840> be<00:00:28.050> a<00:00:28.079> little<00:00:28.349> difficult

00:00:28.549 --> 00:00:28.559 
these they can be a little difficult

00:00:28.559 --> 00:00:30.530 
these they can be a little difficult
with<00:00:28.980> like<00:00:29.189> a<00:00:29.219> larger<00:00:29.700> hoop<00:00:29.910> that's

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:30.540 
with like a larger hoop that's

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:32.930 
with like a larger hoop that's
definitely<00:00:31.410> like<00:00:31.829> bigger<00:00:32.099> gauge<00:00:32.430> than<00:00:32.759> that

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
definitely like bigger gauge than that

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.240 
definitely like bigger gauge than that
it's<00:00:33.149> a<00:00:33.300> little<00:00:33.540> heavier<00:00:33.809> those<00:00:34.800> can<00:00:35.070> get<00:00:35.190> a

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
it's a little heavier those can get a

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.880 
it's a little heavier those can get a
little<00:00:35.399> wearing<00:00:35.820> on<00:00:35.969> the<00:00:36.059> rest<00:00:36.300> so<00:00:36.809> if<00:00:37.230> you

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
can go a little bit further but it's

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.170 
can go a little bit further but it's
definitely<00:01:07.049> one<00:01:07.469> of<00:01:07.500> those<00:01:07.710> you<00:01:08.700> know<00:01:08.729> you<00:01:08.909> can

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.090 
definitely one of those you know you can
play<00:01:09.360> with<00:01:09.540> it<00:01:09.750> any<00:01:10.049> which<00:01:10.290> way<00:01:10.320> so<00:01:10.560> if<00:01:10.979> you're

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
play with it any which way so if you're

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.770 
play with it any which way so if you're
transitioning<00:01:12.890> or<00:01:14.000> even<00:01:15.000> just<00:01:15.270> like<00:01:15.390> in<00:01:15.510> front

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
transitioning or even just like in front

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.469 
transitioning or even just like in front
of<00:01:15.870> you<00:01:16.020> see<00:01:16.710> how<00:01:16.770> my<00:01:16.920> palm<00:01:17.580> is<00:01:17.610> facing<00:01:18.060> the

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
of you see how my palm is facing the

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.590 
of you see how my palm is facing the
front<00:01:19.250> and<00:01:20.250> my<00:01:20.430> hand<00:01:20.760> is<00:01:20.909> on<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.150> inside<00:01:21.570> of

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
front and my hand is on the inside of

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.080 
front and my hand is on the inside of
the<00:01:21.780> hoop<00:01:22.040> so<00:01:23.040> my<00:01:23.159> elbow<00:01:23.340> is<00:01:23.520> straight<00:01:23.670> up<00:01:23.850> and

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
the hoop so my elbow is straight up and

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.350 
the hoop so my elbow is straight up and
down<00:01:24.350> and<00:01:25.350> if<00:01:26.280> it's<00:01:26.460> far<00:01:26.640> enough<00:01:26.850> away<00:01:27.000> from<00:01:27.270> my

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
down and if it's far enough away from my

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.490 
down and if it's far enough away from my
body<00:01:27.479> it's<00:01:27.750> not<00:01:27.810> going<00:01:28.020> to<00:01:28.080> hit<00:01:28.200> it

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
body it's not going to hit it

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.530 
body it's not going to hit it
it's<00:01:29.220> definitely<00:01:29.400> extend<00:01:30.030> it<00:01:30.150> out<00:01:30.240> a<00:01:30.299> little

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
it's definitely extend it out a little

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.200 
it's definitely extend it out a little
bit<00:01:30.720> this<00:01:30.900> is<00:01:30.960> a<00:01:31.049> really<00:01:31.440> awkward<00:01:31.729> position

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
bit this is a really awkward position

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.660 
bit this is a really awkward position
um<00:01:35.540> how<00:01:36.540> flexible<00:01:37.020> you<00:01:37.260> are<00:01:37.439> but<00:01:37.770> you<00:01:38.340> know<00:01:38.430> do

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
um how flexible you are but you know do

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.210 
um how flexible you are but you know do
this<00:01:38.790> at<00:01:38.939> your<00:01:39.060> own<00:01:39.119> risk<00:01:39.270> and<00:01:39.600> in<00:01:40.500> front<00:01:40.979> I

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
this at your own risk and in front I

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.960 
this at your own risk and in front I
like<00:01:41.549> to<00:01:41.760> just<00:01:41.909> use<00:01:42.119> my<00:01:42.299> thumb<00:01:42.570> as<00:01:42.810> like<00:01:43.700> pusher

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.270 

like<00:01:47.970> that<00:01:48.560> it<00:01:49.560> can<00:01:49.740> go<00:01:49.830> all<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:49.979> way<00:01:50.100> around

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
like that it can go all the way around

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.429 
like that it can go all the way around
so<00:01:50.760> that<00:01:50.790> your<00:01:50.970> palm<00:01:51.210> is<00:01:51.360> again<00:01:51.659> facing<00:01:52.320> the

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
so that your palm is again facing the

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.539 
so that your palm is again facing the
front<00:01:52.560> but<00:01:52.830> now<00:01:52.950> your<00:01:53.100> hand<00:01:53.280> is<00:01:53.369> straight<00:01:53.640> down

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:55.549 
front but now your hand is straight down

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:59.870 
front but now your hand is straight down
another<00:01:56.549> good<00:01:56.790> way<00:01:56.909> to<00:01:56.970> do<00:01:57.210> this<00:01:57.240> is<00:01:57.860> open<00:01:58.880> palm

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
another good way to do this is open palm

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.359 
another good way to do this is open palm
and<00:02:00.270> that<00:02:00.360> can<00:02:00.689> be<00:02:00.840> a<00:02:00.869> little<00:02:01.020> different<00:02:01.530> so<00:02:02.189> if

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
and that can be a little different so if

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.920 
and that can be a little different so if
you<00:02:02.490> have<00:02:02.759> this<00:02:03.060> down<00:02:03.439> you<00:02:04.439> can<00:02:04.710> try<00:02:05.329> the<00:02:06.329> hand

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
you have this down you can try the hand

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.639 
you have this down you can try the hand
spin<00:02:07.259> where<00:02:07.530> it<00:02:08.119> essentially<00:02:09.319> goes<00:02:10.319> over<00:02:10.530> the

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
spin where it essentially goes over the

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.660 
spin where it essentially goes over the
back<00:02:10.769> your<00:02:10.979> hand<00:02:12.739> you<00:02:13.739> definitely<00:02:14.220> want<00:02:14.430> some

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
back your hand you definitely want some

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.360 
back your hand you definitely want some
extra<00:02:14.819> momentum<00:02:15.269> here<00:02:15.900> it<00:02:16.349> helps<00:02:16.950> to<00:02:17.220> be

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
extra momentum here it helps to be

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:18.250 
extra momentum here it helps to be
turning

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
turning

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:19.839 
turning
in<00:02:18.530> the<00:02:18.680> direction<00:02:18.830> you're<00:02:19.280> turning<00:02:19.610> you<00:02:19.670> guys

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:19.849 
in the direction you're turning you guys

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:24.729 
in the direction you're turning you guys
so<00:02:20.510> let's<00:02:21.019> say<00:02:21.909> time<00:02:22.909> facing<00:02:23.540> those<00:02:24.230> palm<00:02:24.560> is

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:24.739 
so let's say time facing those palm is

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:27.610 
so let's say time facing those palm is
facing<00:02:24.890> down<00:02:25.659> and<00:02:26.659> again<00:02:26.930> I'm<00:02:27.170> sorry<00:02:27.409> if<00:02:27.530> you

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
facing down and again I'm sorry if you

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
over the top to the right or the dock to

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.670 
over the top to the right or the dock to
the<00:02:42.110> right<00:02:42.549> now<00:02:43.549> if<00:02:44.269> I'm<00:02:45.019> turning<00:02:45.379> in<00:02:45.590> this

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
the right now if I'm turning in this

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.190 
the right now if I'm turning in this
direction<00:02:45.920> so<00:02:46.730> my<00:02:47.329> mom<00:02:47.540> is<00:02:47.780> gonna<00:02:47.900> push

direction so my mom is gonna push

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.259 
direction so my mom is gonna push
against<00:02:48.470> my<00:02:48.680> hand<00:02:48.709> and<00:02:49.610> it's<00:02:49.760> gonna<00:02:49.879> allow<00:02:50.000> me

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:50.269 
against my hand and it's gonna allow me

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:56.309 
against my hand and it's gonna allow me
to<00:02:50.299> go<00:02:50.540> all<00:02:50.660> the<00:02:50.750> way<00:02:50.840> around<00:02:54.069> not<00:02:55.069> like<00:02:55.310> that

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:56.319 
to go all the way around not like that

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:00.640 
to go all the way around not like that
um<00:02:57.609> but<00:02:58.609> that<00:02:59.150> helps<00:02:59.540> so<00:03:00.109> if<00:03:00.410> you're<00:03:00.620> just

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
um but that helps so if you're just

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.650 
um but that helps so if you're just
beginning<00:03:01.069> you<00:03:01.730> can<00:03:01.910> just<00:03:02.120> try<00:03:02.329> the<00:03:02.390> wrist

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
beginning you can just try the wrist

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.569 
beginning you can just try the wrist
moment<00:03:03.170> movement<00:03:03.799> and<00:03:03.980> let<00:03:04.190> go<00:03:04.400> whenever

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:04.579 
moment movement and let go whenever

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:07.569 
moment movement and let go whenever
you're<00:03:04.790> ready<00:03:05.109> but<00:03:06.109> keep<00:03:06.440> that<00:03:06.650> hand<00:03:06.920> wide

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:07.579 
you're ready but keep that hand wide

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:11.369 
you're ready but keep that hand wide
open<00:03:07.940> it's<00:03:08.599> not<00:03:08.720> that<00:03:08.900> pinkie<00:03:09.290> catches<00:03:10.269> so

00:03:11.369 --> 00:03:11.379 
open it's not that pinkie catches so

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:15.430 
open it's not that pinkie catches so
like<00:03:12.379> that<00:03:12.560> I<00:03:13.299> always<00:03:14.299> give<00:03:14.569> it<00:03:14.690> an<00:03:14.840> extra<00:03:15.049> spin

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
like that I always give it an extra spin

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:16.690 
like that I always give it an extra spin
to<00:03:15.560> the<00:03:15.680> other<00:03:15.829> way<00:03:16.069> so<00:03:16.129> it's<00:03:16.430> kind<00:03:16.670> of

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
to the other way so it's kind of

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.180 
to the other way so it's kind of
cheating<00:03:16.879> but<00:03:17.690> um<00:03:17.900> it<00:03:18.590> looks<00:03:18.799> like<00:03:18.980> three

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
cheating but um it looks like three

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.140 
cheating but um it looks like three
spins<00:03:19.489> and<00:03:19.819> I<00:03:20.810> go<00:03:21.379> like<00:03:21.859> one<00:03:22.190> back<00:03:22.730> so<00:03:23.030> that

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
spins and I go like one back so that

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.550 
spins and I go like one back so that
awkward<00:03:23.510> palm<00:03:24.440> facing<00:03:25.099> up<00:03:25.220> type<00:03:25.730> thing<00:03:26.000> and

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
awkward palm facing up type thing and

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.370 
awkward palm facing up type thing and
then<00:03:27.819> an<00:03:28.819> extra<00:03:29.209> little<00:03:29.419> push<00:03:29.690> to<00:03:30.260> the<00:03:30.290> right

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:30.380 
then an extra little push to the right

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:33.190 
then an extra little push to the right
and<00:03:30.769> that<00:03:30.859> just<00:03:31.130> X<00:03:31.370> gives<00:03:32.359> you<00:03:32.450> an<00:03:32.569> extra<00:03:32.870> like

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
and that just X gives you an extra like

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.349 
and that just X gives you an extra like
momentum<00:03:33.519> so<00:03:34.519> that<00:03:34.609> I<00:03:34.639> can<00:03:34.849> get<00:03:35.030> over<00:03:35.090> that

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:35.359 
momentum so that I can get over that

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:38.490 
momentum so that I can get over that
hand<00:03:35.720> over<00:03:35.930> to<00:03:36.019> that<00:03:36.109> pinkie<00:03:36.530> back<00:03:37.250> in<00:03:37.430> as<00:03:37.609> long

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
hand over to that pinkie back in as long

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.819 
hand over to that pinkie back in as long
