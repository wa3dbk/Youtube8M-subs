different different reward track

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.429 
different different reward track
particularly<00:01:13.170> go2<00:01:13.950> a<00:01:14.159> very<00:01:14.340> valuable<00:01:14.869> so<00:01:15.869> you

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
particularly go2 a very valuable so you

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.530 
particularly go2 a very valuable so you
can<00:01:16.619> actually<00:01:16.650> gain<00:01:17.159> a<00:01:17.430> lot<00:01:17.790> from<00:01:17.850> some<00:01:18.450> of

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
can actually gain a lot from some of

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.270 
can actually gain a lot from some of
these<00:01:18.630> reward<00:01:19.049> tracks<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:19.650> some<00:01:19.979> of<00:01:20.070> them<00:01:20.159> are

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
these reward tracks and some of them are

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.340 
these reward tracks and some of them are
reacted<00:01:20.729> you<00:01:20.820> know<00:01:20.850> you<00:01:20.970> could<00:01:21.180> you<00:01:22.170> can

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
reacted you know you could you can

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.859 
reacted you know you could you can
reactivate<00:01:22.740> or<00:01:23.100> is<00:01:23.490> some<00:01:23.790> newer<00:01:24.150> just<00:01:24.689> one

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
reactivate or is some newer just one

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.800 
reactivate or is some newer just one
time<00:01:25.080> only<00:01:26.150> so<00:01:27.150> when<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.390> heart<00:01:27.570> of<00:01:27.659> thorns

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
time only so when the heart of thorns

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.399 
time only so when the heart of thorns
expansion<00:01:28.439> comes<00:01:28.710> out<00:01:29.450> there<00:01:30.450> surely<00:01:31.020> going

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
expansion comes out there surely going

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.010 
expansion comes out there surely going
to<00:01:31.500> introduce<00:01:31.770> a<00:01:32.130> load<00:01:32.460> of<00:01:32.700> new<00:01:32.939> reward<00:01:33.600> tracks

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
to introduce a load of new reward tracks

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.289 
to introduce a load of new reward tracks
so<00:01:34.920> it's<00:01:35.100> going<00:01:35.220> to<00:01:35.280> be<00:01:35.430> very<00:01:35.460> important<00:01:36.210> to

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
so it's going to be very important to

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.330 
so it's going to be very important to
actually<00:01:36.960> do<00:01:37.350> some<00:01:37.590> of<00:01:37.650> these<00:01:37.710> reward<00:01:38.040> tracks

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
actually do some of these reward tracks

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.569 
actually do some of these reward tracks
how<00:01:38.909> to<00:01:38.970> get<00:01:39.240> ahead<00:01:39.680> well<00:01:40.680> as<00:01:41.009> you<00:01:41.430> can<00:01:41.520> see

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
how to get ahead well as you can see

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.760 
how to get ahead well as you can see
here<00:01:41.939> this<00:01:42.420> is<00:01:42.479> one<00:01:42.899> of<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.049> reasons<00:01:43.350> why<00:01:43.590> we

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
here this is one of the reasons why we

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.050 
here this is one of the reasons why we
do<00:01:43.890> these<00:01:44.040> reward<00:01:44.340> tracks<00:01:44.549> to<00:01:44.700> get<00:01:44.820> some<00:01:44.970> of

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
do these reward tracks to get some of

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.630 
do these reward tracks to get some of
the<00:01:45.119> rewards<00:01:45.600> like<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:45.899> armor<00:01:46.290> and<00:01:46.320> the

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 
the rewards like the armor and the

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.999 
the rewards like the armor and the
weapons<00:01:47.640> so<00:01:48.240> imagine<00:01:48.659> all<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.110> new<00:01:49.320> different

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
weapons so imagine all the new different

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.730 
weapons so imagine all the new different
rewards<00:01:50.579> that<00:01:50.970> we<00:01:51.090> are<00:01:51.240> likely<00:01:51.509> to<00:01:51.720> get<00:01:52.079> with

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
rewards that we are likely to get with

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.940 
rewards that we are likely to get with
some<00:01:52.950> of<00:01:53.070> the<00:01:53.189> new<00:01:53.520> reward<00:01:54.090> tracks<00:01:54.950> expected

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
some of the new reward tracks expected

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.190 
some of the new reward tracks expected
with<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.369> heart<00:01:56.579> of<00:01:56.700> thorns<00:01:56.880> expansion<00:01:57.659> you

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
with the heart of thorns expansion you

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.109 
with the heart of thorns expansion you
know<00:01:58.350> if<00:01:58.649> you<00:01:58.770> look<00:01:58.920> here<00:01:59.130> you<00:01:59.399> can<00:01:59.430> pick<00:01:59.850> any

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
know if you look here you can pick any

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:04.309 
the or it's you know a reward track and
I<00:04:01.409> think<00:04:02.010> that<00:04:02.220> you<00:04:02.430> know<00:04:02.549> the<00:04:03.389> reward<00:04:04.079> tracks

00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:04.319 
I think that you know the reward tracks

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:05.809 
I think that you know the reward tracks
that<00:04:04.409> are<00:04:04.500> going<00:04:04.620> to<00:04:04.680> come<00:04:04.769> in<00:04:05.069> are<00:04:05.579> going<00:04:05.639> to

00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:05.819 
that are going to come in are going to

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:08.539 
that are going to come in are going to
be<00:04:05.909> very<00:04:06.150> very<00:04:06.419> significant<00:04:07.109> indeed<00:04:07.620> they

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:08.549 
be very very significant indeed they

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:10.369 
be very very significant indeed they
haven't<00:04:08.819> explicitly<00:04:09.389> said<00:04:09.930> that<00:04:10.109> they<00:04:10.229> had

00:04:10.369 --> 00:04:10.379 
haven't explicitly said that they had

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:12.050 
haven't explicitly said that they had
not<00:04:10.409> gonna<00:04:10.769> bring<00:04:10.919> them<00:04:11.069> in<00:04:11.220> but<00:04:11.549> you<00:04:11.729> think

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
not gonna bring them in but you think

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.020 
not gonna bring them in but you think
that<00:04:12.349> they<00:04:13.349> obviously<00:04:13.859> they<00:04:14.310> bring<00:04:14.639> new

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
that they obviously they bring new

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:16.219 
that they obviously they bring new
reward<00:04:15.329> tracks<00:04:15.629> in<00:04:15.780> because<00:04:16.049> they're<00:04:16.139> gonna

00:04:16.219 --> 00:04:16.229 
reward tracks in because they're gonna

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:19.849 
reward tracks in because they're gonna
have<00:04:16.380> new<00:04:16.560> maps<00:04:16.829> so<00:04:17.609> my<00:04:18.449> advice<00:04:18.570> is<00:04:19.109> save<00:04:19.650> those

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
have new maps so my advice is save those

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:22.580 
have new maps so my advice is save those
potions<00:04:20.190> of<00:04:20.609> pvp<00:04:21.150> rewards<00:04:21.690> because<00:04:22.109> when

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
potions of pvp rewards because when

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:24.170

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
those new reward tracks are going to

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.110 
those new reward tracks are going to
very<00:04:26.819> very<00:04:27.120> valuable<00:04:27.690> indeed<00:04:28.490> so<00:04:29.490> I'm<00:04:29.759> hoping
