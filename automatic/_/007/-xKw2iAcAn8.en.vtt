00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 as it was said these days ago 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:07.020
 we alert you to the 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:07.980
 electric bicycles for scooters 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.230
 did not solve anything 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.849
 but now the military police have decided 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.370
 make the seizures 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.470
 here by my side uti petrelli commander 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.340
 of the company lieutenant the police make the 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.080
 seizures 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.720
 exactly where we go through a period 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.130
 guidance in order to guide the 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.930
 staff not to use the 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.420
 vehicle on public roads with a view to 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.429
 prohibition of irregularity with 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.349
 rules applied in the 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.000
 Brazil and we spent our own 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.770
 some people really do 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.399
 withdrawn from circulation this type of 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.890
 vehicle 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.200
 but some insist even smaller is 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.840
 as was the case today was seized in 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.940
 power of a minor civic procedure 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.860
 now you have that bike foot or you have 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.660
 some rule so that it can withdraw 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.000
 investment is the vehicle is seized 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.430
 and collected here for the patio in what is 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.410
 located in the company but is a vehicle 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.270
 documentation forwarded to the 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.640
 vehicle is under the custody of the detran 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.320
 depends on the detran regularization together 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.120
 to the detran can be made the release 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.710
 here company 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.090
 they came to the company that did not 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.530
 solve nothing, just do not let 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.600
 exactly the people guide the staff 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.670
 to look for the detran and look for 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.409
 remedy irregularities in the case of 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.970
 vehicle even slightly more complicated than 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.340
 the vehicle that does not yet have 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.080
 do not have like the score and regularize it 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.250
 in accordance with the transit rule and 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.880
 series of equipment he has to 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.200
 have also 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.670
 so we guide the person to 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.560
 look for the detran to clarify 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.090
 any doubt in that sense the question 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.670
 who made our report already 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.110
 enough in relation to the stores it sells 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.360
 these vehicles have some procedure 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.740
 against the shops or not from the 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.229
 Military Police fits just 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.909
 inspection reminds us, just me 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.259
 I direct the staff to supervise the 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.450
 public highway 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.159
 this transaction of transit 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.170
 vehicle because that is the 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.210
 competence of the military police to question 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.159
 of the sale in the stores we do not have there 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.850
 does not have the power to restrict this 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.649
 trade 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.450
 up to then if a vehicle to be 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.670
 involving in an accident is complicated 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.740
 it is our concern is exactly this 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.170
 You certainly do not have to leave. 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.659
 making the seizure or retention of the 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.759
 traffic on our public road 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.170
 worry is exactly what safety is 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.459
 because it is often the vehicles are 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.020
 advanced details ne 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.910
 As you do not have a board, you do not have any. 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.960
 personal equipment ends up imagining 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.130
 which is like a bicycle and is not 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:17.080
 it is considered by the code of 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:20.500
 transit equivalent to a motorcycle 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:23.140
 requires no license plate and helmet 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.730
 Signaling lighting on a moped 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.290
 it is also prohibited if the person is 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.270
 can walk if he did not have 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.770
 authorization is made the seizure is the case 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:31.750
 of old tickets that had a 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:33.370
 plate in some had plate then there 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.480
 would be irregular but in this case here 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.480
 and what's happening
