okay the next series of questions here

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:17.269 
okay the next series of questions here
on<00:00:15.210> our<00:00:15.750> frequently<00:00:16.230> asked<00:00:16.470> questions<00:00:16.950> for

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
on our frequently asked questions for

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.359 
on our frequently asked questions for
the<00:00:17.369> spark<00:00:17.820> plug<00:00:18.000> thread<00:00:18.300> repair<00:00:18.660> kits<00:00:19.020> is

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:19.369 
the spark plug thread repair kits is

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:22.630 
the spark plug thread repair kits is
going<00:00:20.369> to<00:00:20.430> be<00:00:20.520> on<00:00:20.730> different<00:00:21.349> applications

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:22.640 
going to be on different applications

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.490 
going to be on different applications
we've<00:00:23.640> talked<00:00:23.880> a<00:00:24.000> lot<00:00:24.150> about<00:00:24.560> the<00:00:25.789> common<00:00:26.789> Ford

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:27.500 
we've talked a lot about the common Ford

4.6 5.4 6.8 liter engines that typically

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:35.299 
4.6 5.4 6.8 liter engines that typically
have<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.150> problem<00:00:33.989> of<00:00:34.170> spark<00:00:34.590> plugs<00:00:34.830> blowing

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
have the problem of spark plugs blowing

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.530 
have the problem of spark plugs blowing
out<00:00:35.489> but<00:00:36.890> since<00:00:37.890> spark<00:00:38.730> plugs<00:00:38.969> have<00:00:39.180> threads

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
out but since spark plugs have threads

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.069 
out but since spark plugs have threads
threads<00:00:40.020> can<00:00:40.290> always<00:00:40.559> be<00:00:40.739> damaged<00:00:41.190> any

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
Caliban 389 hundred kit but the reason

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.429 
Caliban 389 hundred kit but the reason
why<00:01:34.200> is<00:01:34.619> because<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.479> lineup<00:01:36.720> adapter

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
why is because the the lineup adapter

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.940 
why is because the the lineup adapter
that<00:01:38.100> guides<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.090> drill<00:01:39.829> whenever<00:01:40.829> you're

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
that guides the drill whenever you're

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.910 
that guides the drill whenever you're
drilling<00:01:41.280> the<00:01:41.759> hole<00:01:42.600> out<00:01:42.840> so<00:01:43.110> you<00:01:43.200> can<00:01:43.350> tap<00:01:43.619> is

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
drilling the hole out so you can tap is

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.609 
drilling the hole out so you can tap is
only<00:01:44.670> designed<00:01:44.970> for<00:01:45.390> those<00:01:45.780> engines<00:01:46.259> that<00:01:46.590> I

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
only designed for those engines that I

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:52.130 
only designed for those engines that I
just<00:01:46.979> just<00:01:47.880> named<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:48.710> 5.0<00:01:49.850> has<00:01:50.850> a<00:01:50.960> spark<00:01:51.960> plug

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
just just named the 5.0 has a spark plug

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.499 
just just named the 5.0 has a spark plug
hole<00:01:52.320> that's<00:01:52.590> near<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:53.040> surface<00:01:53.280> it's<00:01:54.240> not

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
hole that's near the surface it's not

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.200 
hole that's near the surface it's not
down<00:01:54.780> in<00:01:54.960> a<00:01:54.990> well<00:01:55.310> so<00:01:56.310> it's<00:01:56.759> a<00:01:56.880> totally

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
down in a well so it's a totally

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.600 
down in a well so it's a totally
different<00:01:57.540> design<00:01:57.899> and<00:01:58.229> the<00:01:58.290> lineup<00:01:59.040> adapter

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
different design and the lineup adapter

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.630 
different design and the lineup adapter
from<00:02:00.149> the<00:02:00.240> 38<00:02:00.659> 900<00:02:01.259> kit<00:02:01.530> for<00:02:01.829> that<00:02:01.950> reason<00:02:02.189> will

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
from the 38 900 kit for that reason will

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.679 
from the 38 900 kit for that reason will
not<00:02:02.850> work<00:02:03.950> now<00:02:04.950> we<00:02:05.100> do<00:02:05.219> have<00:02:05.460> other<00:02:06.060> kits<00:02:06.450> that

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
not work now we do have other kits that

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:11.509 
not work now we do have other kits that
can<00:02:06.960> work<00:02:07.170> for<00:02:07.229> it<00:02:07.680> the<00:02:08.250> time<00:02:09.090> sert<00:02:09.329> 5553<00:02:10.519> uses

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:11.519 
can work for it the time sert 5553 uses

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:13.430 
can work for it the time sert 5553 uses
a<00:02:11.549> different<00:02:11.850> type<00:02:12.269> of<00:02:12.299> tooling<00:02:12.959> they<00:02:13.230> don't

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
a different type of tooling they don't

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.949 
a different type of tooling they don't
use<00:02:13.680> an<00:02:13.890> adapter<00:02:14.489> like<00:02:14.910> a<00:02:14.940> separate<00:02:15.420> adapter

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:19.250 
use an adapter like a separate adapter
piece<00:02:16.200> to<00:02:16.530> line<00:02:16.709> up<00:02:16.950> the<00:02:17.099> tooling<00:02:17.780> the<00:02:18.780> tooling

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
piece to line up the tooling the tooling

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.059 
piece to line up the tooling the tooling
is<00:02:19.530> like

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
is like

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:23.149 
is like
stepped<00:02:20.519> design<00:02:21.090> which<00:02:21.810> kind<00:02:22.230> of<00:02:22.290> like<00:02:22.499> pilots

00:02:23.149 --> 00:02:23.159 
stepped design which kind of like pilots

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:25.819 
stepped design which kind of like pilots
the<00:02:23.370> tooling<00:02:24.209> in<00:02:24.389> so<00:02:24.749> it<00:02:24.989> goes<00:02:25.200> in<00:02:25.469> straight

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:25.829 
the tooling in so it goes in straight

the tooling in so it goes in straight
and<00:02:26.129> it<00:02:26.639> doesn't<00:02:26.969> go<00:02:27.090> crooked<00:02:27.599> so<00:02:28.170> you<00:02:28.739> can<00:02:29.010> use

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
and it doesn't go crooked so you can use

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.940

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:38.819 
well now the 38 900 kid just like I

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:42.849 
well now the 38 900 kid just like I
spoke<00:03:39.509> about<00:03:39.720> in<00:03:39.870> the<00:03:39.959> previous<00:03:40.169> question

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:42.859 

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:45.499 

cannot<00:03:43.859> be<00:03:43.919> used<00:03:44.159> for<00:03:44.489> that<00:03:44.669> and<00:03:44.970> the<00:03:45.269> reason

00:03:45.499 --> 00:03:45.509 
cannot be used for that and the reason

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:48.140 
cannot be used for that and the reason
is<00:03:45.840> the<00:03:46.139> lineup<00:03:46.409> adapter<00:03:47.099> even<00:03:47.849> though<00:03:47.970> it's

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
is the lineup adapter even though it's

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:55.550 
is the lineup adapter even though it's
another<00:03:49.759> m14<00:03:50.759> x<00:03:50.939> 1.25<00:03:51.540> millimeter<00:03:53.359> insert<00:03:54.560> or

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
another m14 x 1.25 millimeter insert or

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.599 
another m14 x 1.25 millimeter insert or
spark<00:03:56.549> plug<00:03:56.729> rather<00:03:57.229> same<00:03:58.229> size<00:03:58.530> it<00:03:59.099> can't<00:03:59.459> be

00:03:59.599 --> 00:03:59.609 
spark plug rather same size it can't be

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:03.349 
spark plug rather same size it can't be
used<00:03:59.790> because<00:04:00.000> the<00:04:00.389> lineup<00:04:01.819> adapter<00:04:02.819> it's<00:04:03.090> not

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:03.359 
used because the lineup adapter it's not

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:05.059 
used because the lineup adapter it's not
going<00:04:03.599> to<00:04:03.780> allow<00:04:04.049> you<00:04:04.109> to<00:04:04.259> drill<00:04:04.680> straight

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:05.069 
going to allow you to drill straight

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:06.469 
going to allow you to drill straight
it's<00:04:05.370> not<00:04:05.519> going<00:04:05.699> to<00:04:05.759> guy<00:04:05.879> getting<00:04:06.209> straight

00:04:06.469 --> 00:04:06.479 
it's not going to guy getting straight

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:08.089 
it's not going to guy getting straight
if<00:04:06.959> you<00:04:07.049> get<00:04:07.229> it<00:04:07.319> crooked<00:04:07.530> you're<00:04:07.889> going<00:04:08.040> to

00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:08.099 
if you get it crooked you're going to

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:11.149 
if you get it crooked you're going to
roll<00:04:08.310> in<00:04:08.400> the<00:04:08.519> head<00:04:08.959> so<00:04:09.959> for<00:04:10.439> that<00:04:10.530> reason<00:04:10.590> the

00:04:11.149 --> 00:04:11.159 
roll in the head so for that reason the
