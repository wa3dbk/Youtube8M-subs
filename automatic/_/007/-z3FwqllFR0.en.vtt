00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:28.610 
screen 10 10 2010 at 1212 weird I'll try

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:30.789 
screen 10 10 2010 at 1212 weird I'll try
to<00:01:28.640> put<00:01:29.479> this<00:01:29.630> in<00:01:29.840> motion<00:01:29.990> but<00:01:30.350> looks<00:01:30.650> like

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:30.799 
to put this in motion but looks like

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:33.100 
to put this in motion but looks like
there's<00:01:31.010> stuff<00:01:31.220> coming<00:01:31.250> out<00:01:31.729> of<00:01:32.030> this<00:01:32.510> I<00:01:32.900> don't

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110 
there's stuff coming out of this I don't

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.500 
there's stuff coming out of this I don't
know<00:01:33.170> if<00:01:33.260> this<00:01:33.409> is<00:01:33.760> who<00:01:34.760> knows<00:01:34.940> what<00:01:35.150> this<00:01:35.270> is

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:35.510

could<00:01:35.750> be<00:01:35.900> a<00:01:37.299> gremlin<00:01:38.299> in<00:01:38.600> the<00:01:38.750> software<00:01:39.470> or

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:39.680 
could be a gremlin in the software or

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.660 
could be a gremlin in the software or
whatever<00:01:41.229> but<00:01:42.229> i'll<00:01:42.380> try<00:01:42.799> to<00:01:42.860> slow<00:01:43.159> this<00:01:43.369> way

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
whatever but i'll try to slow this way

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:54.060 
whatever but i'll try to slow this way
down<00:01:44.260> and<00:01:45.430> go<00:01:46.430> back<00:01:46.700> to<00:01:46.909> that<00:01:48.850> right<00:01:49.850> before<00:01:50.090> it

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070

try<00:01:55.070> to<00:01:55.100> get<00:01:55.280> the<00:01:55.430> frame<00:01:55.670> go<00:01:55.880> in<00:01:56.030> here<00:01:56.299> and

00:01:57.539 --> 00:01:57.549 
try to get the frame go in here and

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:02.679 
try to get the frame go in here and
we'll<00:01:58.549> go<00:01:58.700> back<00:01:58.880> to<00:01:59.119> that<00:01:59.299> and<00:02:01.180> we'll<00:02:02.180> start<00:02:02.540> it

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:02.689 
we'll go back to that and we'll start it

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:05.499 
we'll go back to that and we'll start it
here<00:02:02.900> and<00:02:03.110> see<00:02:03.320> if<00:02:03.439> we<00:02:03.619> can<00:02:03.799> see<00:02:04.040> it<00:02:04.329> yeah<00:02:05.329> it's

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:05.509 
here and see if we can see it yeah it's

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:07.420 
here and see if we can see it yeah it's
just<00:02:05.750> one<00:02:05.930> frame<00:02:06.229> that<00:02:06.439> it's<00:02:06.560> in<00:02:06.770> so<00:02:07.100> can't

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:07.430 
just one frame that it's in so can't

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:09.609 
just one frame that it's in so can't
tell<00:02:07.610> if<00:02:07.700> it's<00:02:07.790> moving<00:02:08.030> this<00:02:08.899> direction<00:02:08.959> or

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619

glare here but this just shows up on one

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.680 
glare here but this just shows up on one
frame<00:02:35.600> as<00:02:35.750> well<00:02:35.780> I'm<00:02:36.200> not<00:02:36.350> sure<00:02:37.270> if<00:02:38.270> it's<00:02:38.330> just

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
frame as well I'm not sure if it's just

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.690 
frame as well I'm not sure if it's just
a<00:02:38.810> glitch<00:02:39.050> in<00:02:39.080> the<00:02:39.320> whole<00:02:39.440> software<00:02:40.100> or<00:02:40.459> what

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
a glitch in the whole software or what

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.310 
a glitch in the whole software or what
but<00:02:40.940> it's<00:02:41.090> there<00:02:41.450> you<00:02:41.570> can<00:02:41.750> see<00:02:41.780> some<00:02:42.110> weird

but it's there you can see some weird
things<00:02:42.380> obviously<00:02:43.040> this<00:02:43.190> is<00:02:43.340> the<00:02:43.490> disk<00:02:43.760> that's

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
things obviously this is the disk that's

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.770 
things obviously this is the disk that's
covering<00:02:45.200> the<00:02:45.350> Sun<00:02:45.620> that<00:02:46.360> allows<00:02:47.360> you<00:02:47.540> to<00:02:47.570> look

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
covering the Sun that allows you to look

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.510 
covering the Sun that allows you to look
at<00:02:47.990> it<00:02:48.140> but<00:02:48.230> all<00:02:48.380> this<00:02:48.590> stuff<00:02:48.860> who<00:02:49.070> knows<00:02:49.280> that
