 so much wind struggling for it 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:55.890
 the failures Melt 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.040
 why it nevertheless 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.890
 the procedure 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.760

 Percent off 

00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:41.299
 and again 

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:43.429
 it is such a thing 

00:03:43.429 --> 00:03:45.549
 9 

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:47.649

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:56.449
 whole breaks and whole group 

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:59.449
