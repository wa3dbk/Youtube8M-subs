00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.650
 can afford 

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:22.640
 they do not look like fish eggs 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:22.640
 Oh, what could I eat them in a bucketful?

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.629
 Career dress tells much too cold crew 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:59.080
 for lack of good does not break my 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:59.080
 come 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:33.440
 but you forgot your caviar 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:36.130
 but that's not a caviar that is 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.130
 can set 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:47.460
 the first snow this winter 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:54.840

00:01:47.460 --> 00:02:01.740

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.860
 Go fishing with a ladder you have 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:38.550
 probably never a flying fish 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:40.050
 What the fire is made of can be caught 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.540
