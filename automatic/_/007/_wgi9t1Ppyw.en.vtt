and the plus two in the range the range
is<00:00:59.999> really<00:01:00.479> why<00:01:00.659> I<00:01:00.690> decided<00:01:00.929> to<00:01:01.199> go<00:01:01.319> ahead<00:01:01.379> and

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:01.589 
is really why I decided to go ahead and

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:03.199 
is really why I decided to go ahead and
throw<00:01:01.709> this<00:01:01.769> one<00:01:02.039> over<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.549> Thunder<00:01:02.819> tusk<00:01:03.059> it

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:03.209 
throw this one over the Thunder tusk it

00:01:03.209 --> 00:01:04.910 
throw this one over the Thunder tusk it
does<00:01:03.359> have<00:01:03.569> that<00:01:03.719> minus<00:01:04.110> 2<00:01:04.290> in<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.470> accuracy

does have that minus 2 in the accuracy

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.280 
does have that minus 2 in the accuracy
and<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.339> fire<00:01:05.580> rate<00:01:05.820> but<00:01:06.540> I<00:01:06.780> think<00:01:07.049> that<00:01:07.170> this

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
and the fire rate but I think that this

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.740 
and the fire rate but I think that this
thing<00:01:07.530> and<00:01:07.740> long<00:01:08.190> distance<00:01:08.490> is<00:01:08.820> one<00:01:09.570> of<00:01:09.660> the

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
thing and long distance is one of the

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.780 
thing and long distance is one of the
best<00:01:10.020> guns<00:01:10.440> to<00:01:10.650> use<00:01:10.890> at<00:01:11.130> those<00:01:11.520> longer

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
best guns to use at those longer

best guns to use at those longer

distance it is kind of a week in the

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.190 
distance it is kind of a week in the
close-quarter<00:01:14.160> engagements<00:01:15.000> but<00:01:15.210> really

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
close-quarter engagements but really

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.870

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
its kind of misleading it really only

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.330

exact<00:01:44.670> same<00:01:44.760> damage<00:01:45.480> stats<00:01:46.110> as<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.950> Eric's

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
exact same damage stats as the Eric's

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.580 
exact same damage stats as the Eric's
hole<00:01:47.730> puncher<00:01:48.090> and<00:01:48.300> it<00:01:48.510> only<00:01:48.540> has<00:01:48.810> plus<00:01:49.350> 2

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.110 
hole puncher and it only has plus 2
damage<00:01:49.830> so<00:01:50.100> the<00:01:50.580> only<00:01:50.670> thing<00:01:50.760> that<00:01:51.030> I<00:01:51.060> can

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:51.120 
damage so the only thing that I can

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:52.880 
damage so the only thing that I can
really<00:01:51.390> think<00:01:51.630> of<00:01:51.840> with<00:01:52.230> it<00:01:52.440> giving<00:01:52.740> that

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
really think of with it giving that

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.790 
really think of with it giving that
additional<00:01:53.460> +1<00:01:54.270> on<00:01:54.300> the<00:01:54.630> damage<00:01:54.840> is<00:01:55.140> maybe

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:55.800 
additional +1 on the damage is maybe

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.399 
additional +1 on the damage is maybe
some<00:01:56.580> type<00:01:56.730> of<00:01:56.760> bullet<00:01:57.180> penetration<00:01:57.720> or<00:01:58.110> some

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
some type of bullet penetration or some

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.380

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
just feel like it's not really my type

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.710 
just feel like it's not really my type
of<00:03:10.830> gun<00:03:11.070> for<00:03:11.340> my<00:03:11.430> play<00:03:11.730> style<00:03:12.000> I<00:03:12.209> like<00:03:12.390> to<00:03:12.570> run

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
of gun for my play style I like to run

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.690 
of gun for my play style I like to run
around<00:03:12.840> as<00:03:13.110> fast<00:03:13.320> as<00:03:13.530> i<00:03:13.620> can<00:03:13.680> and<00:03:14.070> i<00:03:14.400> think<00:03:14.610> the

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
around as fast as i can and i think the

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.370 
around as fast as i can and i think the
obsidian<00:03:15.120> seed<00:03:15.300> is<00:03:15.450> more<00:03:15.660> for<00:03:15.870> those<00:03:15.900> medium

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
obsidian seed is more for those medium

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.590 
obsidian seed is more for those medium
and<00:03:16.560> long<00:03:16.770> range<00:03:17.040> engagements<00:03:17.600> definitely

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
and long range engagements definitely

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.540 
and long range engagements definitely
seeing<00:03:18.780> that<00:03:18.900> it<00:03:19.050> did<00:03:19.230> get<00:03:19.440> a<00:03:19.650> nerve<00:03:20.220> at<00:03:20.430> the

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:20.550 
seeing that it did get a nerve at the

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:22.340 
seeing that it did get a nerve at the
very<00:03:20.700> beginning<00:03:20.850> of<00:03:21.180> advanced<00:03:21.480> warfare<00:03:21.870> 3

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
very beginning of advanced warfare 3

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:25.039 
very beginning of advanced warfare 3
shot<00:03:22.530> kill<00:03:22.769> range<00:03:22.980> is<00:03:23.280> very<00:03:23.370> low<00:03:23.970> so<00:03:24.480> you<00:03:24.870> do

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
shot kill range is very low so you do

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:26.750 
shot kill range is very low so you do
have<00:03:25.230> to<00:03:25.440> get<00:03:25.560> those<00:03:25.799> four<00:03:26.130> to<00:03:26.280> five<00:03:26.459> shot

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
have to get those four to five shot

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.210 
have to get those four to five shot
kills<00:03:27.090> at<00:03:27.360> the<00:03:27.690> closer<00:03:27.930> ranges<00:03:28.440> so<00:03:28.680> I<00:03:28.860> feel

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
kills at the closer ranges so I feel

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:30.830 
kills at the closer ranges so I feel
like<00:03:29.310> it's<00:03:29.489> just<00:03:29.670> more<00:03:29.940> of<00:03:29.970> a<00:03:30.209> medium<00:03:30.630> and

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
like it's just more of a medium and

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.350 
like it's just more of a medium and
long-range<00:03:31.260> engagement<00:03:32.250> weapon<00:03:32.549> so<00:03:32.730> it's<00:03:33.000> not

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
long-range engagement weapon so it's not

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.180 
long-range engagement weapon so it's not
really<00:03:33.420> my<00:03:33.959> cup<00:03:33.989> of<00:03:34.230> tea<00:03:34.380> and<00:03:34.530> maybe<00:03:34.890> your

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
really my cup of tea and maybe your

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.220 
really my cup of tea and maybe your
favorite<00:03:35.519> weapon<00:03:35.820> and<00:03:36.030> it<00:03:36.299> probably<00:03:36.330> is<00:03:36.959> the

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
favorite weapon and it probably is the

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:38.509 
favorite weapon and it probably is the
number<00:03:37.470> one<00:03:37.650> weapon<00:03:37.890> with<00:03:38.160> an<00:03:38.250> advanced

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 
number one weapon with an advanced

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:40.190 
number one weapon with an advanced
warfare<00:03:38.940> but<00:03:39.090> it's<00:03:39.209> just<00:03:39.360> not<00:03:39.420> my<00:03:39.810> thing<00:03:39.840> I

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
warfare but it's just not my thing I

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.720 
warfare but it's just not my thing I
just<00:03:40.470> there's<00:03:41.040> other<00:03:41.220> weapons<00:03:41.580> out<00:03:41.700> there

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
just there's other weapons out there

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.340 
just there's other weapons out there
that<00:03:41.970> I<00:03:42.000> do<00:03:42.060> better<00:03:42.390> with<00:03:42.630> because<00:03:43.049> I<00:03:43.230> just

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
that I do better with because I just

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:45.110 
that I do better with because I just
feel<00:03:43.860> like<00:03:43.890> they're<00:03:44.190> more<00:03:44.370> consistent<00:03:44.940> in<00:03:45.030> the

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
feel like they're more consistent in the

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.180 
feel like they're more consistent in the
close<00:03:45.299> range<00:03:45.570> engagements<00:03:45.750> and<00:03:46.260> speaking<00:03:46.950> of

close range engagements and speaking of
