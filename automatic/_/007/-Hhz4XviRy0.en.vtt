00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
dripping water and it's important not to

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.979

because it can damage the sponge and

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
once all the dripping water is out of it

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.960 
once all the dripping water is out of it
I<00:02:51.900> can<00:02:52.170> start<00:02:52.440> using<00:02:52.620> it<00:02:52.860> and<00:02:53.100> what<00:02:53.730> I'm<00:02:53.850> going
