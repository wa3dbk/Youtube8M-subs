00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
this line doesn't come back and tangle

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.229 
this line doesn't come back and tangle
you<00:02:42.320> what<00:02:43.070> happens<00:02:43.370> when<00:02:43.520> you're<00:02:43.640> using<00:02:43.790> super

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:44.239 
you what happens when you're using super

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:46.390 
you what happens when you're using super
line<00:02:44.450> this<00:02:45.230> hook<00:02:45.470> will<00:02:45.500> come<00:02:45.770> back<00:02:45.980> sometimes

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
line this hook will come back sometimes

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.100

after<00:02:46.670> you<00:02:46.730> set<00:02:46.910> the<00:02:47.030> hook<00:02:47.150> and<00:02:47.330> miss<00:02:47.510> and

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
after you set the hook and miss and

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.130 
after you set the hook and miss and
it'll<00:02:48.440> get<00:02:48.560> tangled<00:02:49.040> on<00:02:49.190> your<00:02:49.340> line<00:02:49.959> okay<00:02:50.959> so
