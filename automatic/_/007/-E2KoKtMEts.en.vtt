 at 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:33.640
 2 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:38.400
 at 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.400
 and 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.060
 the 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:30.780
 mans is because cha cha how 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:33.320
 new rows behind the 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.320
 montini 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:14.320
 we would like to call 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:31.370
 moore who is the master alexis materials 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:38.820
 Quebec will have to see his new offer 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:41.030
 initial bkc hopes many children of 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.030
 Haiti 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.130
 I am very happy 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.510
 it is true that 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.819
 that it is sometimes difficult to be 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.920
 happy after 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:54.079
 lost game and especially for the players 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.610
 even because I believe they would have 

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:57.590
 deserved more is 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:59.520
 certainly not deserved to lose this 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:01.350
 match but 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:03.240
 I think they all did a very 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.810
 good match and with a selection that there 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:06.420
 had 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.190
 change a lot because there was 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:11.610
 a lot of absences in the team of 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:13.620
 base is today we had to play with 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:16.200
 a team that has hardly played 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:18.180
 together a lot of players who do not get 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.330
 did not already know but they have very 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:23.590
 well done for the first time 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:23.590
 it was happy
