now

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.880 

then<00:01:50.490> you<00:01:50.610> can<00:01:50.760> unmask<00:01:51.240> all<00:01:51.660> of<00:01:51.840> it<00:01:51.990> after<00:01:52.740> its

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
then you can unmask all of it after its

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.690 
then you can unmask all of it after its
dried<00:01:53.900> probably<00:01:54.900> another<00:01:55.020> hour

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.940
