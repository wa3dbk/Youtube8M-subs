the perforating wheel whenever you want

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:10.980 
the perforating wheel whenever you want
to<00:06:09.910> go<00:06:10.000> back<00:06:10.150> to<00:06:10.270> folding<00:06:10.600> you<00:06:10.690> can<00:06:10.810> just

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:10.990 
to go back to folding you can just

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:13.710 
to go back to folding you can just
simply<00:06:11.140> loosen<00:06:11.650> this<00:06:12.150> move<00:06:13.150> this<00:06:13.300> out<00:06:13.540> of<00:06:13.570> the

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:13.720 
simply loosen this move this out of the

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:18.750 
simply loosen this move this out of the
way<00:06:14.490> tighten<00:06:15.490> it<00:06:15.580> back<00:06:15.700> up<00:06:17.280> and<00:06:18.280> the<00:06:18.460> machine

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:18.760 
way tighten it back up and the machine

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:21.750 
way tighten it back up and the machine
is<00:06:18.940> now<00:06:19.510> set<00:06:19.840> for<00:06:20.050> fully<00:06:20.500> so<00:06:21.460> let's<00:06:21.610> say<00:06:21.730> that

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:21.760 
is now set for fully so let's say that

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:23.610 
is now set for fully so let's say that
we're<00:06:22.030> ready<00:06:22.360> to<00:06:22.450> go<00:06:22.540> back<00:06:22.810> to<00:06:23.020> just<00:06:23.200> folding

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:23.620 
we're ready to go back to just folding

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:25.380 
we're ready to go back to just folding
only<00:06:23.920> but<00:06:24.460> we<00:06:24.610> first<00:06:24.820> got<00:06:24.940> to<00:06:25.060> put<00:06:25.210> everything

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:25.390 
only but we first got to put everything

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:27.980 
only but we first got to put everything
back<00:06:25.570> together<00:06:25.780> so<00:06:26.590> we<00:06:26.620> need<00:06:27.130> to<00:06:27.220> put<00:06:27.400> the

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:27.990 
back together so we need to put the

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:30.630 
back together so we need to put the
conveyor<00:06:28.990> he<00:06:29.440> has<00:06:29.560> a<00:06:29.590> conveyor<00:06:29.980> back<00:06:30.310> in<00:06:30.490> to

wheel<00:06:42.240> as<00:06:43.240> you<00:06:43.270> want<00:06:43.690> is<00:06:44.560> axel<00:06:45.220> to<00:06:45.550> be<00:06:45.840> just

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:46.840 
wheel as you want is axel to be just

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:49.650 
wheel as you want is axel to be just
about<00:06:47.050> centered<00:06:47.530> over<00:06:47.710> where<00:06:48.340> the<00:06:48.580> final<00:06:49.000> or

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:49.660 
about centered over where the final or

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:51.180 
about centered over where the final or
where<00:06:49.960> the<00:06:50.080> end<00:06:50.290> of<00:06:50.410> the<00:06:50.530> folded<00:06:51.040> piece<00:06:51.160> of

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:51.190 
where the end of the folded piece of

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:56.340 
where the end of the folded piece of
paper<00:06:51.340> is<00:06:54.180> so<00:06:55.180> for<00:06:55.420> instance<00:06:55.750> we<00:06:55.930> just<00:06:56.140> take

00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:56.350 
paper is so for instance we just take

00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:58.980 
paper is so for instance we just take
our<00:06:56.620> folded<00:06:57.040> piece<00:06:57.190> of<00:06:57.220> paper<00:06:57.370> and<00:06:58.060> stick<00:06:58.810> it

00:06:58.980 --> 00:06:58.990 
our folded piece of paper and stick it

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:02.750 
our folded piece of paper and stick it
place<00:06:59.200> it<00:06:59.520> so<00:07:00.520> that<00:07:00.700> it's<00:07:00.850> just<00:07:01.510> at<00:07:01.660> the<00:07:01.900> edge

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:02.760 
place it so that it's just at the edge

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:06.900 
place it so that it's just at the edge
of<00:07:03.760> where<00:07:04.060> the<00:07:04.380> zigzag<00:07:05.380> can<00:07:05.530> bear<00:07:05.710> begins<00:07:06.070> and

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:06.910 
of where the zigzag can bear begins and

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:09.720 
of where the zigzag can bear begins and
then<00:07:07.030> we<00:07:07.120> just<00:07:07.300> basically<00:07:07.690> slide<00:07:08.460> the<00:07:09.460> wheels

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:09.730 
then we just basically slide the wheels

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:11.460 
then we just basically slide the wheels
so<00:07:10.300> that<00:07:10.480> they're<00:07:10.660> just<00:07:10.900> over<00:07:11.230> where<00:07:11.380> the

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:11.470 
so that they're just over where the

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:15.240 
so that they're just over where the
folded<00:07:12.150> crease<00:07:13.150> occurs<00:07:13.600> which<00:07:14.560> is<00:07:14.770> where<00:07:15.100> the

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:15.250 
folded crease occurs which is where the

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:21.000 
folded crease occurs which is where the
paper<00:07:15.460> starts<00:07:18.840> once<00:07:19.840> you've<00:07:20.050> inserted<00:07:20.410> the

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:21.010 
paper starts once you've inserted the

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:24.330
