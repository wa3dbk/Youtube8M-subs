perfection<00:01:03.600> what<00:01:03.989> we're<00:01:04.140> doing<00:01:04.350> here<00:01:04.470> is

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
perfection what we're doing here is

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.170 
perfection what we're doing here is
saying<00:01:04.799> let's<00:01:05.159> just<00:01:05.460> make<00:01:05.610> a<00:01:05.670> slightly<00:01:05.970> better

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
saying let's just make a slightly better

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.760 
saying let's just make a slightly better
decision<00:01:06.659> over<00:01:06.930> and<00:01:07.049> over<00:01:07.110> and<00:01:07.229> over<00:01:07.290> and<00:01:07.470> what

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
decision over and over and over and what

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.170 
decision over and over and over and what
you<00:01:07.890> get<00:01:08.010> is<00:01:08.070> an<00:01:08.280> emergent<00:01:08.700> behavior<00:01:08.790> that

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
you get is an emergent behavior that

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.230 
you get is an emergent behavior that
creates<00:01:09.659> optimal<00:01:10.560> human<00:01:10.650> performance<00:01:11.240> so

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
creates optimal human performance so

increase memory i/o and increase

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.619 
increase memory i/o and increase
creativity<00:02:46.910> so<00:02:47.910> we're<00:02:48.300> going<00:02:48.420> to<00:02:48.540> be

00:02:48.619 --> 00:02:48.629 
creativity so we're going to be

doing<00:03:15.239> there<00:03:15.330> is<00:03:15.390> I'm<00:03:15.599> training<00:03:15.870> my<00:03:16.050> brain<00:03:16.319> to

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
doing there is I'm training my brain to

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.130 
doing there is I'm training my brain to
have<00:03:16.860> more<00:03:17.489> blood<00:03:18.420> in<00:03:18.690> the<00:03:18.780> front<00:03:18.959> of<00:03:19.050> the

part that controls them a million and
the<00:03:25.560> reptilian<00:03:26.010> brain<00:03:26.190> if<00:03:26.400> it's<00:03:26.730> trained<00:03:27.150> to

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:27.299 
the reptilian brain if it's trained to

control them otherwise they're in
control<00:03:29.069> and<00:03:29.280> you<00:03:29.340> end<00:03:29.489> up<00:03:29.549> acting<00:03:29.700> like<00:03:29.849> a

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
control and you end up acting like a

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.339 
control and you end up acting like a
Labrador<00:03:30.299> eating<00:03:30.629> everything<00:03:30.840> and<00:03:31.140> you<00:03:31.319> know

00:03:31.339 --> 00:03:31.349 
Labrador eating everything and you know

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:34.729 
Labrador eating everything and you know
humping<00:03:31.680> people's<00:03:31.950> legs<00:03:32.069> it's<00:03:32.549> messy<00:03:32.959> so<00:03:33.959> what

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
humping people's legs it's messy so what

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:36.140 
humping people's legs it's messy so what
what<00:03:35.099> you're<00:03:35.220> trying<00:03:35.430> to<00:03:35.519> do<00:03:35.610> here<00:03:35.819> is<00:03:35.970> this

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
what you're trying to do here is this

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:37.729 
what you're trying to do here is this
figure<00:03:36.360> out<00:03:36.420> how<00:03:36.720> do<00:03:36.780> we<00:03:36.959> optimally<00:03:37.470> turn<00:03:37.650> that

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
figure out how do we optimally turn that

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:39.559 
figure out how do we optimally turn that
on<00:03:37.799> well<00:03:38.159> one<00:03:38.340> way<00:03:38.489> is<00:03:38.519> you<00:03:38.849> train<00:03:39.060> yourself<00:03:39.150> to

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:39.569 
on well one way is you train yourself to

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:41.149 
on well one way is you train yourself to
know<00:03:39.900> how<00:03:40.110> to<00:03:40.170> bring<00:03:40.409> blood<00:03:40.739> to<00:03:40.860> the<00:03:40.890> front<00:03:41.099> of

brain<00:04:18.810> waves<00:04:18.840> it's<00:04:19.199> using<00:04:19.440> blood<00:04:19.650> when<00:04:20.310> you

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
brain waves it's using blood when you

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:21.949 
brain waves it's using blood when you
combine<00:04:20.759> that<00:04:20.790> with<00:04:21.030> neurofeedback<00:04:21.630> it's

math<00:04:49.199> Institute<00:04:49.319> device<00:04:49.860> yes<00:04:50.099> my<00:04:50.279> kids<00:04:50.520> play

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:50.669 
math Institute device yes my kids play

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:51.860 
math Institute device yes my kids play
with<00:04:50.759> an<00:04:50.969> M<00:04:51.060> wave<00:04:51.210> and<00:04:51.360> they<00:04:51.419> think<00:04:51.479> it's<00:04:51.659> great

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870 
with an M wave and they think it's great

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:53.089 
with an M wave and they think it's great
fun<00:04:52.080> they<00:04:52.289> don't<00:04:52.469> know<00:04:52.590> that<00:04:52.770> when<00:04:52.860> they<00:04:52.949> make

brain<00:05:00.659> is<00:05:00.810> learning<00:05:01.080> how<00:05:01.169> to<00:05:01.229> function<00:05:01.439> yes

00:05:02.029 --> 00:05:02.039 
brain is learning how to function yes

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:03.890 
brain is learning how to function yes
they<00:05:02.219> do<00:05:02.279> this<00:05:02.879> is<00:05:03.029> far<00:05:03.270> more<00:05:03.419> powerful<00:05:03.629> than

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:03.900 
they do this is far more powerful than

forcing<00:05:04.349> them<00:05:04.529> to<00:05:04.560> do<00:05:04.740> math<00:05:04.889> or<00:05:05.099> something

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:05.340 
forcing them to do math or something

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:08.180

although<00:05:05.490> they're<00:05:05.789> good<00:05:05.939> at<00:05:06.029> math<00:05:06.150> too
