mine a person could use various types of
feeders<00:01:22.820> that<00:01:23.119> make<00:01:23.270> it<00:01:23.390> a<00:01:23.450> little<00:01:23.630> more

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
feeders that make it a little more

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:25.990 
feeders that make it a little more
efficient<00:01:24.380> but<00:01:24.619> the<00:01:25.009> excavator<00:01:25.700> is<00:01:25.970> a

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:28.009 
all-around machine that you can buy off

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:30.010 
all-around machine that you can buy off
the<00:01:28.220> shelf<00:01:28.490> and<00:01:28.729> will<00:01:28.940> give<00:01:29.180> you<00:01:29.300> a<00:01:29.330> relatively

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:37.580 
consistent peek inside the trommel you

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:42.100 
consistent peek inside the trommel you
can<00:01:37.759> see<00:01:38.000> the<00:01:38.360> material<00:01:38.690> getting<00:01:39.229> washed<00:01:41.110> see

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 
can see the material getting washed see

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.830 
can see the material getting washed see
a<00:01:42.140> fairly<00:01:42.500> fair<00:01:43.399> sized<00:01:43.670> little<00:01:44.149> rock<00:01:44.420> coming

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
there's quite a bit larger rocks that

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:58.330 
there's quite a bit larger rocks that
are<00:01:50.810> available<00:01:51.440> to<00:01:51.649> be<00:01:52.460> fed<00:01:52.729> through<00:01:52.940> it<00:01:57.340> down

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340
