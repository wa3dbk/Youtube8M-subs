00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
is because like I said the multiplayer

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.299 
is because like I said the multiplayer
servers<00:00:33.480> were<00:00:33.600> down<00:00:33.630> and<00:00:34.020> they're<00:00:34.980> not<00:00:35.100> down

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
ends up being a death machine I do

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.410 
ends up being a death machine I do
believe<00:03:13.530> yeah<00:03:13.709> and<00:03:13.950> I<00:03:14.880> thought<00:03:15.239> it'd<00:03:15.360> be

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
believe yeah and I thought it'd be

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:16.820 
believe yeah and I thought it'd be
pretty<00:03:15.480> cool<00:03:15.750> I<00:03:15.930> was<00:03:16.200> reckoning<00:03:16.590> with<00:03:16.709> the

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
pretty cool I was reckoning with the

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.039 
pretty cool I was reckoning with the
m8a1<00:03:17.370> wonder<00:03:18.209> what<00:03:18.329> the<00:03:18.420> death<00:03:18.540> machine<00:03:18.840> could

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:19.049 
m8a1 wonder what the death machine could

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:21.830 
m8a1 wonder what the death machine could
do<00:03:19.200> and<00:03:19.440> I<00:03:20.310> mean<00:03:20.910> for<00:03:21.120> the<00:03:21.239> most<00:03:21.360> part<00:03:21.570> it's

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
do and I mean for the most part it's

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.140 
do and I mean for the most part it's
it's<00:03:22.410> a<00:03:22.500> really<00:03:22.709> good<00:03:22.829> kill<00:03:23.040> streak<00:03:23.280> but<00:03:23.519> it

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
it's a really good kill streak but it

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:25.789 
it's a really good kill streak but it
just<00:03:24.299> overall<00:03:24.690> slows<00:03:24.959> you<00:03:25.110> down<00:03:25.170> and<00:03:25.620> I<00:03:25.680> don't

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:25.799 
just overall slows you down and I don't

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:29.240 
just overall slows you down and I don't
really<00:03:25.980> like<00:03:26.190> that<00:03:26.370> so<00:03:27.000> yeah<00:03:27.930> that<00:03:28.200> was<00:03:28.380> a<00:03:28.739> 30
