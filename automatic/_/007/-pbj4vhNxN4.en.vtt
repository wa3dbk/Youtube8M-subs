00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.900
 Then it is feature of the day 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:09.380
 Here is a football stadium that is being considered for construction in Hiroshima City 

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.380
 About 

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:23.190
 Minister Sanfrecce Hiroshima won his first league title 

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:23.190
 The demand for a new stadium has risen sharply 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.520
 Ha 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:33.640
 tan 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:39.730
 In the background, Mr. Fredge is based. 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:41.970
 EDION Stadium of Hiroshima Asaminami-ku, Hiroshima, and the like to be far from the city center Tei 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:41.970
 I will 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:55.550
 In addition , there is a track for land between the stand and the pitch for an athletics stadium, and the game feels realistic 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.550
 It is pointed out that it is hard to be born 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:08.410
 Furthermore , it is desirable to have a large roof with almost no roof and all the audience seats 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:08.410
 Failure to meet Japan Football Association standards has also been an issue 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:20.040
 In response to these voices, the Hiroshima Chamber of Commerce and Industry Hiroshima City last June 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:24.810
 And the prefecture football association is suitable for what kind of facilities when constructing a football stadium 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:28.799
 We established meeting to examine the 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:34.170
 Because I think such a thing is absolutely necessary 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:38.720
 I want to make one, and the design must be decided soon 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:43.550
 I want you not to stick to the whole army land 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:47.530
 Last month's meeting narrowed the construction site to 4 locations 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.530
 We started a concrete discussion 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:56.750
 Or 4 places to be and construction proposed site of the stadium is what places such the 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:02:00.200
 We will advance together with Takada basics who are in charge of coverage We will explain these four places some other time 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:04.700
 Please Yes er and is in the Council was I this day 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.360
 A place where there is a Hiroshima area park Edion stadium that Emma Freud uses 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.009
 is not it 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:11.220
 This collection is also a child of choice 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:14.760
 It is this Chuo Park on it 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:18.150
 Then old Hiroshima citizen baseball stadium Hiroshima Minato Park 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:23.220
 I have these as a coach 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:28.799
 Where is the reason for choosing these 3 locations other than the current home location? Yes 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:29.640
 Assuming that the council chose these, the new stadium is jr 4 j 1 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:35.280
 Match of 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:38.140
 And facilities that can accommodate 30,000 spectators who can hold international competitions 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:42.790
 It is considered appropriate to build such a facility 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:46.330
 So there is a space where a facility of this scale can be built. 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:51.520
 Route bus Astram Line in the further area 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:54.640
 It is a place where transportation facilities such as trams can be used , I say these three places 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:57.780
 Then what kind of place is three places after each 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.780
 I have actually interviewed 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:06.489
 One place is here in Naka Ward, Hiroshima City , where the route bus and Astram Line pass. 

00:03:03.439 --> 00:03:06.489
 It is Chuo Park 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:15.650
 Chuo Park located in the center of Hiroshima City is characterized by easy transportation. 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:31.910
 The task is the width of the north-south In the Japan Football Association, when the pitch is placed in the east-west direction 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:37.560
 We are asked to be placed in the north-south direction because it is backlit and may affect play 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:43.550
 However , the distance between the north and south of the park is the narrowest in Kochi 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:43.550
 In order to provide seating for 30,000 people, design efforts are required 

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:54.180
 The second candidate site is in the most busy place in the city. 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:54.180
 It is an old Hiroshima citizen stadium site 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:04:01.700
 Long known as the base of the carp 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:06.190
 There is also Ass tram line and tram Center stuck to it 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:06.190
 It is characterized by being located in the city center 

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:20.470
 However, the site is the narrowest of the 6 hectares and coaches 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:20.470
 There are facilities that are still used such as a sewer pump station and a martial arts site on the site 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:29.960
 It is necessary to consider the scenery because the atomic bomb dome is nearby 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.960
 There are also restrictions on height 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:44.409
 The third place is here in Minami Ward, Hiroshima City 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:44.409
 The area is 10 hectares 

00:04:45.529 --> 00:04:55.839
 Hiroshima Minato Park has the largest area among the three coaches 

00:04:50.599 --> 00:04:55.839
 There are trams and local buses around 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:06.270
 However , it is pointed out that access from the center of Hiroshima City is the least accessible among the candidate sites . 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:15.030
 We have also seen features and challenges 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:20.610
 What kind of competition will be held at the meeting 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:26.340
 Well , what kind of stadium can be built at the proposed site for each kind of favor at the council ? 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:27.289
 Rough construction and economic ripple effect on showing the image 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:30.619
 a 

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:36.529
 We are going to consider about the economic ripple effect etc. 

00:05:30.619 --> 00:05:44.220
 And by this fall, I will narrow down from here and my son 

00:05:36.529 --> 00:05:48.380
 It is decided to put together a proposal It is certain that the meeting started up last June last year 

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:55.580
 I am really been narrowed down to four spans one year 

00:05:48.380 --> 00:06:00.860
 I heard the president of Miura chairman of TamotsuOsamukai attached to that point just I guess would be all right 

00:05:55.580 --> 00:06:02.120
 I want to say and I'm here to say that as where the answer because it has been the fact that any good 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:08.990
 I think 

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:15.569
 However, things that can be corrected will be different depending on each place . Cost will also be different. 

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:21.240
 Becomes will be different also ripple effect is possibly in a comparison of it and off 

00:06:15.569 --> 00:06:25.080
 Innumerable public relations may remain, but there is not much time left 

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:30.080
 After all it takes a long time we give ideas 

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:35.539
 I want to think together and work out the concept well 

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:40.580
 In any case, it is to raise candidate site in the fall as a meeting 

00:06:35.539 --> 00:06:47.840
 After However, when will the actual construction to but is ahead now 

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:50.900
 Materials for construction are now soaring due to the post- disaster reconstruction and the Tokyo Olympics etc. 

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:56.630
 Collect costs like construction costs 

00:06:50.900 --> 00:07:02.240
 Yes interviewed officials of regarding the construction costs and stadium construction 

00:06:56.630 --> 00:07:06.080
 There is also a view that it may not cost more than 10 billion yen, but how to secure this construction 

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:07.830
 The prospect is still but I was status quo that is not set outlook and whether to 

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:14.670
 With members from today outside 

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:17.190
 There are also voices for raising funds and securing construction costs, but some of these are from now on 

00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:20.529
 How to secure huge polices 

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:24.669
 I think it will be a big issue in the meeting 

00:07:20.529 --> 00:07:29.319
 Jega 3 by all means it from consecutive Hiroshima is having a club that aims to 

00:07:24.669 --> 00:07:33.299
 I thought that I want you to go ahead one step at a time as soon as possible to boost 

00:07:29.319 --> 00:07:33.299
 I told the enemy who was about the football stadium
