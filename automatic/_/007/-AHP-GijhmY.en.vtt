00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.250
 nice boy I don't know who was not there 

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:17.200
 this second channel blog though 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:19.300
 promised a new blog and then sail 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.980
 I bring it then 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.529
 let's start immediately to say I apologize for the 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.849
 hair just sucks at the sea now 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:26.619
 as you could see also 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:29.619
 from the beginning as I show you too 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:32.739
 now in short and so there is a lot of wind 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:34.510
 wind the new hair so oh well you have 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:37.420
 understood in short then in the moment that 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:40.239
 I'm saying this blog is there 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:43.839
 wait for control with you are the 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:45.610
 13 53 because to know that I already have 

00:00:43.839 --> 00:00:48.129
 recorded this globe this morning 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:50.969
 only to love that he bought it eliminated me 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:55.000
 registration just so I don't know 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:57.309
 because as the Romanian coop born the files 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.469
 registration so now the fate 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:01.660
 quoting this blog all over again 

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:02.710
 then we leave immediately because I want to 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.059
 make this blog 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:09.090
 how did you react article accounts to 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:11.679
 talk to you about a question you are 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.390
 speaking a lot in the community of 

00:01:11.679 --> 00:01:15.820
 youtube especially to the community 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:20.229
 then type the question of grays 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:24.429
 then many are saying that they are not 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:26.229
 they can no longer glitch in my opinion 

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:27.940
 all fucked up but now I'll explain 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:29.860
 because the rock star 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:31.509
 according to a question that he asked not 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:35.770
 have placed users like them 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:38.200
 they react when youtuber nights indeed 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.450
 he also for not known publish win 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.300
 we type a rock star said yes 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.750
 is moving on this thing 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:49.230
 but this moment on this thing or 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:51.930
 just delete all the videos the ICI 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:54.210
 that will be loaded and send it 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.820
 stress and send strikes in the channels 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.680
 which load containing precisely that 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.030
 they can ruin the game and now you 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:05.600
 I explain why I think it's bullshit 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:09.510
 then miracles a day turn around 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:12.450
 too much too then 

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:16.680
 delete all videos in my opinion 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:18.180
 it would really be a great effort and there 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.740
 it would take a long time all this time 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.100
 for the rockstar has according to me has not from 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:26.820
 lose therefore for this in my opinion it is 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:28.560
 bullshit then also because the fact 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:30.930
 of the strike extra view a thing not to 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.060
 underestimate because after three strikes 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.370
 then youtube closes the channel 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.480
 kids strike 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.410
 we must be very careful we must 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.070
 play on this thing 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.930
 then I personally will change me a 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:44.580
 pony glitches also because they see a little 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.700
 the trend also of the other youtubers 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.660
 Americans because they really load 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.959
 lots of glitch videos and then i 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:57.170
 guys anyway all of us a channel 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:59.580
 American youtube that followed the piece of 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.260
 all still have an American channel 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.330
 for clichy follow so you see 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.830
 how many videos they upload per day then 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.690
 now I see a little progress on 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:09.480
 youtube in the community in general 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:11.190
 American and Italian youtube and a 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.870
 little the general trend and let's see some 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:15.480
 how to proceed with the smooth 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:18.750
 then videos are quiet not 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.880
 stop to him will try to proceed 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.860
 with maybe with that series 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.810
 that I'm starting point without doing the 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:26.760
 they are new series where you will be also 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.320
 you participate then explain the new video 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.550
 as you can see, you are going to 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:32.520
 start of the new series 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:33.900
 so guys not video 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:35.820
 will not end on my channel but 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.690
 will continue regarding the 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:39.630
 gray as I told you 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:41.550
 I'll try to make one every now and then right 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:44.820
 to see with the and then the rest if 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:47.130
 the trend on youtube on the community 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:48.690
 of youtube in general if I see that there 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:51.780
 they are still people who upload 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:53.280
 multiply and it just doesn't happen 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:56.520
 nothing then I believe I will continue also 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:58.890
 me because in the end guys do it 

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:00.570
 close a channel for the clique and it is 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:03.420
 useless now I explain why not 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:06.810
 serves neither me nor you because I load 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:08.400
 interesting content for you and me 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:11.460
 all the labors ask for the channel 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:13.350
 have been thrown to the wind and in any case 

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:15.060
 you no longer have videos then at the end 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:17.459
 it's something you don't even need 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:20.850
 so it is worthwhile to wait 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:22.800
 and see how things are going too 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:24.930
 because anyway make sure you don't get it 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.520
 close a channel so as not to wait 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:28.500
 a little see how things are is 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.480
 really astonished because all the 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:32.610
 labors I did should go like there 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:34.740
 you have thrown yourself to the wind here are not 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:36.180
 numbers that turned out to be mine though 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:40.050
 anyway they are not numbers to throw away 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:42.870
 because to get to my 2300 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:44.610
 subscribers currently there really is 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:46.710
 a great effort then not boys 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:48.840
 imagine the expenses that are there anyway 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:51.990
 to deal with a channel above all 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:54.720
 with my buy 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:56.880
 as you see materials to bring you 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:58.230
 however quality video however anyway 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.090
 as you see this video you like them 

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:02.110
 these just like if it is so we can 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:04.090
 know with a comment below 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:05.830
 well even other evenings that puts a 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:08.470
 moment then that we see you that video 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:10.630
 so I will try to bring it well too 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:11.110

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:15.490

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:18.490
 and those guys who say i hope that 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:21.100
 understand my decision anyway 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:22.720
 keep doing climate very slowly 

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:24.460
 the clichÃ©s then tried to carry on 

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:25.450
 anyway I hope you have some series 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:28.840
 this my decision 

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:30.130
 guys but it's a necessary thing to do 

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:31.750
 ends shoot this you enjoyed it is 

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:33.520
