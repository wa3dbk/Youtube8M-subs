you can see even though along the camera

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.510 
you can see even though along the camera
here<00:02:35.910> it's<00:02:36.910> just<00:02:37.570> enough<00:02:38.290> bulk<00:02:38.920> to<00:02:39.160> kind<00:02:39.430> of

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.520 
here it's just enough bulk to kind of

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.220 
here it's just enough bulk to kind of
keep<00:02:39.790> that<00:02:40.090> camera<00:02:40.360> from<00:02:40.510> getting<00:02:40.960> scratched

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
keep that camera from getting scratched

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.860 
keep that camera from getting scratched
if<00:02:41.560> you<00:02:41.680> lay<00:02:41.860> it<00:02:41.890> down<00:02:42.130> it<00:02:42.430> is<00:02:43.120> extremely

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
if you lay it down it is extremely

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.290 
if you lay it down it is extremely
extremely<00:02:44.550> pretty<00:02:45.550> much<00:02:45.670> like<00:02:45.820> the<00:02:45.940> minimum

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.300 
extremely pretty much like the minimum

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:47.640 
extremely pretty much like the minimum
that<00:02:46.390> you<00:02:46.450> can<00:02:46.660> go<00:02:46.780> if<00:02:46.960> you<00:02:46.990> want<00:02:47.110> to<00:02:47.410> keep<00:02:47.620> that

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
that you can go if you want to keep that

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.800 
that you can go if you want to keep that
protected<00:02:48.520> as<00:02:48.640> well<00:02:48.910> so<00:02:50.910> yeah<00:02:51.910> other<00:02:52.780> than

for<00:03:23.230> you<00:03:23.440> if<00:03:23.590> you<00:03:23.710> hold<00:03:23.890> your<00:03:23.950> phone<00:03:24.460> probably

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 
for you if you hold your phone probably

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.030 
for you if you hold your phone probably
like<00:03:24.880> a<00:03:24.970> normal<00:03:25.270> person<00:03:25.350> but<00:03:26.350> for<00:03:26.650> me<00:03:26.770> it's

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
like a normal person but for me it's

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.670 
like a normal person but for me it's
just<00:03:27.340> it's<00:03:27.610> bothersome<00:03:28.150> in<00:03:28.330> and<00:03:28.680> we'll

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
just it's bothersome in and we'll

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.080 
just it's bothersome in and we'll
probably<00:03:29.950> have<00:03:30.160> to<00:03:30.190> take<00:03:30.400> a<00:03:30.430> nail<00:03:30.670> file<00:03:30.910> to

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.150 
probably have to take a nail file to
that<00:03:31.240> a<00:03:31.270> little<00:03:31.420> bit<00:03:31.690> later<00:03:31.930> other<00:03:32.920> than<00:03:33.010> that

I<00:03:33.190> think<00:03:33.310> the<00:03:33.490> case<00:03:33.640> is<00:03:33.670> pretty<00:03:34.300> darn<00:03:34.720> awesome

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:35.020 
I think the case is pretty darn awesome

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:37.950 
I think the case is pretty darn awesome
it's<00:03:35.500> only<00:03:35.680> ten<00:03:35.920> dollars<00:03:36.370> so<00:03:36.670> a<00:03:36.910> whole<00:03:37.720> lot

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:37.960 
it's only ten dollars so a whole lot
