00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
has these taper bearings you have to

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.580 
has these taper bearings you have to
punch<00:01:41.940> them<00:01:42.119> out<00:01:42.240> from<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.750> inside<00:01:42.900> out<00:01:43.140> and

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
punch them out from the inside out and

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.530 
punch them out from the inside out and
what<00:01:44.220> happens<00:01:44.610> is<00:01:44.790> that<00:01:45.030> you<00:01:45.299> create<00:01:45.869> as<00:01:47.540> you

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
what happens is that you create as you

what happens is that you create as you
punch<00:01:48.750> it<00:01:48.899> out<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.710> punch<00:01:50.280> hits<00:01:50.580> the<00:01:50.790> side<00:01:51.200> and

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
punch it out the punch hits the side and

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.139 
punch it out the punch hits the side and
that<00:01:52.290> causes<00:01:52.560> a<00:01:52.710> rough<00:01:52.979> spot<00:01:53.250> so<00:01:53.759> you<00:01:53.850> have<00:01:54.030> to

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
that causes a rough spot so you have to

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.630 
that causes a rough spot so you have to
make<00:01:54.270> sure<00:01:54.710> to<00:01:55.710> clean<00:01:55.950> that<00:01:56.130> rough<00:01:56.340> spot

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
make sure to clean that rough spot
