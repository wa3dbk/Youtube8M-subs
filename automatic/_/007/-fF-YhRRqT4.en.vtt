the<00:00:52.580> front<00:00:52.910> brake<00:00:53.120> to<00:00:53.600> get<00:00:53.780> the<00:00:53.930> thing<00:00:54.170> back

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:54.200 
the front brake to get the thing back

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.780

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:55.790 
down in the corner

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:00.010 
down in the corner
the<00:00:56.090> reason<00:00:56.660> is<00:00:57.050> he<00:00:57.820> wasn't<00:00:58.820> leaned<00:00:59.090> over<00:00:59.300> far

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:00.020 
the reason is he wasn't leaned over far

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.980 
the reason is he wasn't leaned over far
enough<00:01:00.410> for<00:01:01.160> the<00:01:01.250> speed<00:01:01.520> he<00:01:01.790> was<00:01:01.940> carrying<00:01:02.390> so

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:02.990 
enough for the speed he was carrying so

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:05.830 
enough for the speed he was carrying so
he<00:01:03.080> had<00:01:03.260> to<00:01:03.380> check<00:01:03.650> up<00:01:03.790> right<00:01:04.790> here<00:01:05.090> go<00:01:05.660> out<00:01:05.810> a

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:05.840 
he had to check up right here go out a

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.490 
he had to check up right here go out a
little<00:01:06.050> too<00:01:06.320> fast<00:01:06.650> for<00:01:07.010> the<00:01:07.730> speed<00:01:08.380> for<00:01:09.380> the

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 
little too fast for the speed for the

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.800 
little too fast for the speed for the
lien<00:01:09.740> that<00:01:09.770> he<00:01:10.100> had<00:01:10.310> in<00:01:10.490> the<00:01:10.610> bike<00:01:10.820> so<00:01:11.480> he<00:01:11.600> had

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:11.810 
lien that he had in the bike so he had

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:13.840 
lien that he had in the bike so he had
he<00:01:12.440> was<00:01:12.590> going<00:01:12.740> to<00:01:12.800> go<00:01:12.920> over<00:01:12.950> the<00:01:13.280> berm<00:01:13.490> if<00:01:13.760> he

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
he was going to go over the berm if he

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:15.940 
he was going to go over the berm if he
didn't<00:01:14.150> slow<00:01:14.330> it<00:01:14.450> down<00:01:14.480> so<00:01:15.260> he<00:01:15.410> slows<00:01:15.740> it<00:01:15.920> down

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
didn't slow it down so he slows it down

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.820 
didn't slow it down so he slows it down
with<00:01:16.940> the<00:01:17.030> front<00:01:17.330> brake<00:01:17.480> notice<00:01:18.080> he<00:01:18.440> wasn't

the<00:01:22.460> corner<00:01:22.670> very<00:01:23.150> important<00:01:23.750> so<00:01:24.410> he<00:01:24.530> had<00:01:24.680> to

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:24.800 
the corner very important so he had to

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.890 
the corner very important so he had to
check<00:01:25.010> up<00:01:25.250> slow<00:01:25.700> it<00:01:25.730> down<00:01:25.880> a<00:01:26.060> little<00:01:26.360> bit<00:01:26.630> get

check up slow it down a little bit get
his<00:01:27.050> balance<00:01:27.290> back<00:01:27.740> and<00:01:28.160> by<00:01:28.909> now<00:01:29.150> he's<00:01:29.510> got<00:01:29.720> his

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:29.870 
his balance back and by now he's got his

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:32.260 
his balance back and by now he's got his
balance<00:01:30.080> back<00:01:30.530> he's<00:01:31.190> laying<00:01:31.610> it<00:01:31.820> over<00:01:32.120> into

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
balance back he's laying it over into

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.780 
balance back he's laying it over into
the<00:01:32.390> corner<00:01:32.840> far<00:01:33.080> enough<00:01:33.409> and<00:01:33.710> he<00:01:34.610> can

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:34.790 
the corner far enough and he can

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:36.640 
the corner far enough and he can
accelerate<00:01:35.150> out<00:01:35.540> of<00:01:35.630> the<00:01:35.720> corner<00:01:36.050> so<00:01:36.230> my<00:01:36.350> point

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:36.650 
accelerate out of the corner so my point

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:38.530 
accelerate out of the corner so my point
is<00:01:36.950> not<00:01:37.550> only<00:01:37.820> do<00:01:37.880> you<00:01:37.970> have<00:01:38.000> to<00:01:38.180> be<00:01:38.300> able<00:01:38.420> to
