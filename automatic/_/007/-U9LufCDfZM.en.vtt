00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:28.199
 I saw something in the action and after the cup 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.199
 the first time I sound system 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:39.130
 the mystery 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:42.130
 you select channel from the left invading 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:44.580
 You have to take a single direction. 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.580
 this is not known 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.730
 problem I had was before 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 For this year I have like the following exits 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.920
 but the problem is that on my computer there is no pilot output of 4 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:26.800

 He wanted my career. 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:30.320
 computer does not have this 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.320
 the garbage entrance 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.590
 To try to solve this problem I did the following

 I picked up a heavy rope reported 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:52.200
 to resolve this 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.480
 The first thing I put in was 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:57.480
 three entrances 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.610

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:04.270

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.800

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:12.439

 red white and yellow 

00:02:27.469 --> 00:02:29.179

00:02:29.179 --> 00:02:30.709

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:36.289
