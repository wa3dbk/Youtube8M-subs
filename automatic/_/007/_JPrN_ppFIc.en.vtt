new<00:01:27.100> to<00:01:27.130> steels<00:01:27.520> that's<00:01:27.820> really<00:01:28.180> low<00:01:28.420> budget

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
new to steels that's really low budget

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.649 
new to steels that's really low budget
quality<00:01:30.130> steels<00:01:30.490> that<00:01:30.789> you<00:01:30.939> don't<00:01:31.270> want<00:01:31.539> to

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:31.659 
quality steels that you don't want to

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:32.940 
quality steels that you don't want to
use<00:01:31.840> because<00:01:32.140> they're<00:01:32.259> gonna<00:01:32.350> dull<00:01:32.619> very

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
use because they're gonna dull very

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.100 
use because they're gonna dull very
quickly<00:01:33.250> and<00:01:34.180> they<00:01:34.270> don't<00:01:34.539> hold<00:01:34.689> an<00:01:34.869> edge<00:01:35.020> very

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 
quickly and they don't hold an edge very

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:35.999 
quickly and they don't hold an edge very
well<00:01:35.439> at<00:01:35.530> all

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:36.009 
well at all

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:37.560 
well at all
and<00:01:36.280> it's<00:01:36.640> kind<00:01:36.820> of<00:01:36.850> difficult<00:01:37.030> to<00:01:37.299> get<00:01:37.479> an

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:37.570 
and it's kind of difficult to get an

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.260 
and it's kind of difficult to get an
edge<00:01:37.689> back<00:01:37.990> on<00:01:38.289> them<00:01:38.619> so<00:01:39.520> that's<00:01:39.820> what<00:01:40.119> this

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
edge back on them so that's what this

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:41.550 
edge back on them so that's what this
steel<00:01:40.539> is<00:01:40.570> made<00:01:40.840> out<00:01:41.020> of<00:01:41.170> it's<00:01:41.289> basically

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
steel is made out of it's basically

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.260 
steel is made out of it's basically
garbage<00:01:42.009> the<00:01:42.159> only<00:01:42.399> thing<00:01:42.579> going<00:01:42.789> for<00:01:43.119> it

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
garbage the only thing going for it

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.510 
garbage the only thing going for it
is<00:01:43.359> that<00:01:43.869> it's<00:01:44.020> pretty<00:01:44.170> rust<00:01:44.560> resistant<00:01:45.340> so

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 
is that it's pretty rust resistant so

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.459 
is that it's pretty rust resistant so
that's<00:01:45.700> good<00:01:46.060> you<00:01:46.659> know<00:01:46.689> particularly<00:01:47.079> and

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:47.469 
that's good you know particularly and

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:49.349 
that's good you know particularly and
how<00:01:47.740> they<00:01:47.890> kind<00:01:48.039> of<00:01:48.130> pitch<00:01:48.250> it<00:01:48.369> to<00:01:48.399> you<00:01:48.670> at

00:01:49.349 --> 00:01:49.359 
how they kind of pitch it to you at

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:50.520 
how they kind of pitch it to you at
