00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
just had a spare parts I had laying

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.140 
just had a spare parts I had laying
around<00:00:12.360> I<00:00:12.990> saw<00:00:13.380> a<00:00:13.860> hammer<00:00:14.219> nails<00:00:14.610> and<00:00:15.089> a

around I saw a hammer nails and a

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:15.799 
around I saw a hammer nails and a
stapler

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
stapler

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:22.099 
stapler
so<00:00:17.930> this<00:00:18.930> basically<00:00:19.590> the<00:00:20.460> V<00:00:20.699> just<00:00:21.539> a<00:00:21.689> woodblock

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
so this basically the V just a woodblock

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.000 
so this basically the V just a woodblock
of<00:00:22.410> the<00:00:23.000> staple<00:00:24.000> felt<00:00:24.269> to<00:00:24.480> it<00:00:24.630> this<00:00:25.320> is<00:00:25.380> the<00:00:25.650> NPC

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
of the staple felt to it this is the NPC

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.089 
of the staple felt to it this is the NPC
stabilized<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:27.029> rod<00:00:27.210> when<00:00:27.510> it's<00:00:27.660> up<00:00:28.099> for

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
stabilized the rod when it's up for

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:35.870 
stabilized the rod when it's up for
longer<00:00:29.490> rods<00:00:29.929> when<00:00:30.929> I'm<00:00:31.050> wrapping<00:00:31.489> and<00:00:34.880> this

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
longer rods when I'm wrapping and this

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.240 
longer rods when I'm wrapping and this
is<00:00:36.239> my<00:00:36.840> thread<00:00:37.829> tension<00:00:39.620> very<00:00:40.620> very<00:00:40.980> similar

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
is my thread tension very very similar

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.770 
is my thread tension very very similar
to<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:41.610> drag<00:00:41.879> on<00:00:42.059> a<00:00:42.090> reel<00:00:43.190> basically<00:00:44.190> you<00:00:44.280> got

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:44.780 
to the drag on a reel basically you got

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.160 
to the drag on a reel basically you got
bearing<00:00:45.780> or<00:00:46.140> nut<00:00:46.530> bearings<00:00:47.719> washers<00:00:48.719> spool

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
bearing or nut bearings washers spool

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.240 
bearing or nut bearings washers spool
washer<00:00:49.890> spring<00:00:50.430> washers<00:00:51.090> and<00:00:51.559> a<00:00:52.559> wing<00:00:53.070> nut

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
washer spring washers and a wing nut

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.389 
washer spring washers and a wing nut
right<00:00:53.820> here<00:00:54.620> and<00:00:55.620> when<00:00:55.770> I<00:00:55.829> put<00:00:56.010> this<00:00:56.100> on<00:00:56.219> macro

00:00:58.389 --> 00:00:58.399 
right here and when I put this on macro

00:00:58.399 --> 00:00:59.900 
right here and when I put this on macro
there<00:00:59.399> we<00:00:59.550> go

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
there we go

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.279 
there we go
you<00:01:00.030> just<00:01:00.149> tighten<00:01:00.329> it<00:01:00.510> down<00:01:00.539> for<00:01:00.840> more<00:01:00.960> spool

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
you just tighten it down for more spool

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.860 
you just tighten it down for more spool
pressure<00:01:01.699> and<00:01:02.699> loosen<00:01:03.239> it<00:01:03.270> for<00:01:03.480> Less<00:01:03.629> spool

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
pressure and loosen it for Less spool

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.350 
pressure and loosen it for Less spool
pressure<00:01:04.140> and<00:01:05.010> right<00:01:05.159> now<00:01:05.400> it's<00:01:05.670> temporarily

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
pressure and right now it's temporarily

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.270 
pressure and right now it's temporarily
held<00:01:06.869> on<00:01:07.110> by<00:01:07.560> a<00:01:07.920> screw<00:01:08.520> hook<00:01:09.140> but<00:01:10.140> soon<00:01:10.619> I<00:01:10.979> will

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
held on by a screw hook but soon I will

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.590 
held on by a screw hook but soon I will
drill<00:01:11.760> a<00:01:11.790> hole<00:01:12.270> right<00:01:12.659> about<00:01:12.930> there<00:01:14.600> let's

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
drill a hole right about there let's

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.050 
drill a hole right about there let's
take<00:01:15.960> it<00:01:16.049> off<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.259> macro<00:01:17.869> we<00:01:18.869> go<00:01:19.880> now<00:01:20.880> these

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
take it off the macro we go now these

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.880 
take it off the macro we go now these
little<00:01:21.560> screwin<00:01:22.560> hooks

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
little screwin hooks

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.970 
little screwin hooks
let<00:01:23.189> me<00:01:23.280> get<00:01:23.460> you<00:01:23.610> guys<00:01:23.670> a<00:01:23.850> close-up

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:27.980 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.940 

right<00:01:28.980> there<00:01:29.190> just<00:01:29.820> got<00:01:29.940> little<00:01:30.180> threads

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
right there just got little threads

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.020 
right there just got little threads
there's<00:01:31.950> a<00:01:32.070> little<00:01:32.280> screw<00:01:32.520> in<00:01:32.610> hook<00:01:33.260> and

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
there's a little screw in hook and

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.240 
there's a little screw in hook and
basically<00:01:36.030> I<00:01:36.420> just<00:01:37.260> put<00:01:37.500> these<00:01:37.650> throughout

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
basically I just put these throughout

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.880 
basically I just put these throughout
the<00:01:38.400> thing<00:01:38.640> so<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.960> thread<00:01:40.350> goes<00:01:40.590> through

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
the thing so the thread goes through

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.780 
the thing so the thread goes through
this<00:01:41.040> first<00:01:41.370> one<00:01:41.840> onto<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:42.900> second<00:01:43.410> one<00:01:43.440> or<00:01:44.340> an

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
this first one onto the second one or an

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.610 
this first one onto the second one or an
end<00:01:45.000> in<00:01:45.180> any<00:01:45.450> of<00:01:45.600> these<00:01:45.690> three<00:01:46.050> depending<00:01:46.530> on

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:46.620 
end in any of these three depending on

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:48.080 
end in any of these three depending on
where<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:46.890> guide<00:01:47.070> is<00:01:47.310> that<00:01:47.340> I<00:01:47.520> have<00:01:47.700> to<00:01:47.850> wrap

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
where the guide is that I have to wrap

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.290 
where the guide is that I have to wrap
and<00:01:48.630> if<00:01:49.020> that's<00:01:49.230> too<00:01:49.470> tight<00:01:49.800> I<00:01:50.190> mean<00:01:50.970> just<00:01:51.150> go

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:53.370 
from this first one to the other ones

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:55.370 
from this first one to the other ones
that<00:01:53.490> I<00:01:53.550> have<00:01:53.640> which<00:01:54.630> I<00:01:54.780> had<00:01:54.930> to<00:01:55.050> do<00:01:55.200> because
