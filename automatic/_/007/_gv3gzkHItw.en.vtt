and<00:01:36.600> we'd<00:01:37.140> have<00:01:37.170> won<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.560> game<00:01:37.590> it<00:01:37.979> would<00:01:38.100> have

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
and we'd have won the game it would have

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.640

unless<00:01:42.270> they<00:01:42.659> decided<00:01:43.170> I<00:01:43.350> guess<00:01:43.799> to<00:01:43.920> do<00:01:44.040> like<00:01:44.189> a

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
unless they decided I guess to do like a

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.280 
unless they decided I guess to do like a
Hail<00:01:44.549> Mary<00:01:44.579> throw<00:01:45.360> down<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.750> field<00:01:45.960> and<00:01:46.140> get<00:01:46.259> a

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
Hail Mary throw down the field and get a

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.950 
Hail Mary throw down the field and get a
touchdown<00:01:46.530> somehow<00:01:47.070> it<00:01:47.549> other<00:01:48.149> than<00:01:48.450> that<00:01:48.509> we

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
touchdown somehow it other than that we

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.289 
touchdown somehow it other than that we
had<00:01:49.140> this<00:01:49.320> game<00:01:49.530> one<00:01:49.829> and<00:01:50.040> we<00:01:50.520> screwed<00:01:50.909> up<00:01:51.060> and
