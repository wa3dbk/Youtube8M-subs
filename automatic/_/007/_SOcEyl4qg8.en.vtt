 your supporter as you already know the 

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:12.280
 Today March 19 , Apple launched the 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:13.929

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:17.140

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:24.520
 generation and fifth generation also 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:26.530
 for ipad second third and ipad fourth 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:28.540
 generation and for good for those who 

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:31.780
 they are just beginning in this world of 

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:33.670
 'break' can be told not to update 

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:35.680
 since if you update they are going to 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:39.430
 lose be they are going to lose their jailbreak 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:41.410
 to unattached his trouble of even 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:44.410
 one of the members of the eba team 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:47.680
 there's him is masons has said via 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:50.620
 twitter that are far from this year 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:53.950
 it is since the investment tool 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:56.800
 serves us in this ios and for the moment 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:59.320
 there is no way to make a downgrade 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:02.820
 to these devices except for the 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:06.760
 iphone 4 and ipad touch fourth generation 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:09.310
 that is, you update by mistake 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:12.100
 or buy a device this new with 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:15.400
 ios 6.1 point 3 at the moment there is no 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:17.680
 break maybe in the future it's going to 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:20.380
 update the investment tool 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.480
 but this they would have to find 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.220
 new vulnerabilities since those that 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:26.950
 they served earlier in the tool 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:30.160
 fun now no longer serve as a 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:32.320
 paul the arrangement covered them and good to this 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:35.080
 year of 6.1 point 3 which is what we 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:38.380
 brings to bring improvements in the maps to 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:40.600
 the country of japan and also brings improvements 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:43.090
 already fixes the fault they had to 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:46.270
 have the pass by having the password if 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:48.160
 you did not know the password with a few 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.620
 steps that you had to make 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:53.410
 they could access contacts and 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:56.020
 photographs and good in this last 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:58.570

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:01.510

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:07.000
