00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.800 

here's<00:00:18.580> the<00:00:18.789> generator<00:00:19.240> all<00:00:19.450> back<00:00:19.660> together

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:19.810 
here's the generator all back together

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:22.530 
here's the generator all back together
it's<00:00:20.369> running<00:00:21.369> on<00:00:21.460> gas<00:00:21.759> I'm<00:00:22.090> gonna<00:00:22.240> break<00:00:22.419> the

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:22.540 
it's running on gas I'm gonna break the

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:25.200 
it's running on gas I'm gonna break the
piston<00:00:22.930> in<00:00:23.020> a<00:00:23.050> little<00:00:23.349> bit<00:00:23.470> more<00:00:24.090> and<00:00:25.090> it

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:25.210 
piston in a little bit more and it

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.750 
piston in a little bit more and it
doesn't<00:00:25.599> seem<00:00:25.840> to<00:00:26.050> have<00:00:26.800> broken<00:00:27.160> in<00:00:27.400> quite

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:27.760 
doesn't seem to have broken in quite

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.370 
doesn't seem to have broken in quite
properly

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:30.380 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.190 

so

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:33.200 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.170 

and<00:00:33.380> let<00:00:33.680> her<00:00:33.800> run<00:00:33.980> for<00:00:34.340> a<00:00:34.370> long

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:35.180 
and let her run for a long

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.360 
and let her run for a long
long<00:00:35.360> old<00:00:35.660> time<00:00:35.780> just<00:00:36.530> like<00:00:36.650> this<00:00:36.830> probably<00:00:37.220> go

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:37.370 
long old time just like this probably go

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.210 
long old time just like this probably go
through<00:00:37.580> a<00:00:37.610> tank<00:00:37.940> or<00:00:38.090> two<00:00:38.560> I've<00:00:39.560> got<00:00:39.680> a<00:00:39.710> 200

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:40.220 
through a tank or two I've got a 200

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:43.420 
through a tank or two I've got a 200
watt<00:00:40.340> load<00:00:40.610> on<00:00:40.880> it<00:00:41.830> just<00:00:42.830> to<00:00:42.950> give<00:00:43.100> it<00:00:43.190> some

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:43.430 
watt load on it just to give it some

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.310 
watt load on it just to give it some
resistance<00:00:43.970> but<00:00:44.150> not<00:00:44.330> much

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
resistance but not much

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.819 
resistance but not much
also<00:00:47.039> one<00:00:47.519> thing<00:00:47.699> to<00:00:47.760> note<00:00:48.230> there's<00:00:49.230> a<00:00:49.350> screw

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
also one thing to note there's a screw

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.950 
also one thing to note there's a screw
right<00:00:50.660> there

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
right there

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.799 
right there
it's<00:00:52.500> a<00:00:52.559> Philips<00:00:53.010> head<00:00:53.359> I'm<00:00:54.359> gonna<00:00:54.539> get<00:00:54.719> it

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
it's a Philips head I'm gonna get it

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:55.310 
it's a Philips head I'm gonna get it
down<00:00:54.960> there

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
down there

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.569 
down there
right

00:00:57.569 --> 00:00:57.579 
right

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:00.030 
right
they're<00:00:58.149> that<00:00:58.480> phillips-head<00:00:59.110> that's<00:00:59.800> what

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:00.040 
they're that phillips-head that's what

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:05.550 
they're that phillips-head that's what
it<00:01:00.160> just<00:01:00.550> your<00:01:02.160> rpm<00:01:03.449> at<00:01:04.449> full<00:01:04.690> throttle<00:01:04.989> I'll

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:05.560 
it just your rpm at full throttle I'll

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.290 
it just your rpm at full throttle I'll
give<00:01:05.770> you<00:01:05.860> a<00:01:05.890> demonstration<00:01:06.070> rope<00:01:06.820> we're<00:01:07.060> at

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:07.300 
give you a demonstration rope we're at

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.149 
give you a demonstration rope we're at
well<00:01:07.840> it's<00:01:08.050> in<00:01:08.200> generator<00:01:08.619> mode<00:01:08.920> without

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:09.159 
well it's in generator mode without

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:11.550 
well it's in generator mode without
messing<00:01:09.520> with<00:01:09.640> a<00:01:09.760> carburetor<00:01:10.150> like<00:01:10.390> I<00:01:10.540> do<00:01:10.720> we

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560 
messing with a carburetor like I do we

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.530 
messing with a carburetor like I do we
give<00:01:11.710> you<00:01:11.800> a<00:01:11.830> demonstration

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:13.540 
give you a demonstration

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.150 
give you a demonstration
this<00:01:13.810> is<00:01:13.990> also<00:01:14.200> how<00:01:14.530> you<00:01:14.560> would<00:01:14.890> set<00:01:15.100> your

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:15.160 
this is also how you would set your

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:25.310 
this is also how you would set your
voltage

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:36.850 

I<00:01:25.350> uh

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:36.860 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:47.450 

rpm<00:01:37.730> dropping<00:01:38.330> slightly

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.880 

but<00:01:47.790> basically<00:01:48.090> your<00:01:48.450> rpm<00:01:48.900> and<00:01:49.049> hence<00:01:49.260> voltage

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
but basically your rpm and hence voltage

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:56.290 
but basically your rpm and hence voltage
adjustment

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:56.300 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:57.730 

you<00:01:56.450> here<00:01:56.630> to<00:01:56.750> pick<00:01:56.810> up<00:01:57.110> quite<00:01:57.350> a<00:01:57.380> bit<00:01:57.560> right

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
you here to pick up quite a bit right

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:13.369 
you here to pick up quite a bit right
there

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:13.379 

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:15.600 

it's<00:02:13.739> not<00:02:13.890> a<00:02:13.920> real

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
it's not a real

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.750 
it's not a real
it's<00:02:16.000> not<00:02:16.180> a<00:02:16.210> real<00:02:16.480> real<00:02:16.840> good<00:02:17.580> it's<00:02:18.580> not<00:02:18.730> a

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
it's not a real real good it's not a

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.580 
it's not a real real good it's not a
direct<00:02:19.210> connection<00:02:19.660> it<00:02:19.930> still<00:02:20.200> goes<00:02:20.380> through

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
direct connection it still goes through

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.010 
direct connection it still goes through
the<00:02:20.680> governor

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
the governor

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:27.020 
the governor
but<00:02:22.620> it<00:02:22.740> does<00:02:23.900> give<00:02:24.900> some<00:02:25.260> level<00:02:25.680> of<00:02:26.030> control

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
but it does give some level of control

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.500 
but it does give some level of control
over<00:02:27.180> the<00:02:27.600> output<00:02:27.780> voltage<00:02:28.500> output<00:02:28.920> rpm<00:02:29.510> so

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
over the output voltage output rpm so

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:36.000 
over the output voltage output rpm so
SSC<00:02:31.230> turtle<00:02:32.810> just<00:02:33.810> a<00:02:33.870> little<00:02:34.080> FYI

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
SSC turtle just a little FYI

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.790 
SSC turtle just a little FYI
take<00:02:36.580> it<00:02:36.730> easy
