00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 on October 30 , 2012 the 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.390
 Cenapred produced a report in which 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.370
 contributed more photographic evidence 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.160
 about the volcano incident 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.679
 popocatepetl happened on the 25th of 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.529
 October the conclusion of the report is that 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:20.160
 the light spotted was a bolide at 20 and 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:22.619
 44 h from October 25 the camera of the 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.900
 sena pre located in the station also 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.480
 money for continuous visual monitoring 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.279
 of the popocatépetl volcano recorded the 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.769
 appearance and transit of a signal 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.660
 luminous with intense brightness in the 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.850
 upper left quadrant of the 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.820
 image which moves to great 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.850
 speed increasing its brilliance and that 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.800
 seems to enter the crater of the volcano 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.930
 the presence of this signal in the image 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.750
 It lasts approximately 3 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.180
 seconds the cenapred camera high 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.610
 money is located 11 kilometers from 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.350
 popocatepetl volcano crater and few 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.719
 meters from the place where the company 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.609
 televisa has another camera installed with 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.489
 which were recorded similar images 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.830
 which were retransmitted in the 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.110
 news program with joaquin lópez 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.930
 dóriga Friday night 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.630
 5 It should be noted that the differences in 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.580
 shape length shadows and brilliance 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.160
 between the images taken by the camera 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.890
 of the cenapred and by the television camera 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:22.440
 are related to technical aspects 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.350
 own of each team mainly its 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:27.510
 resolution on the other hand the framing in 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.910
 The case of cenapred images is 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:31.670
 much more open while the camera 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:34.350
 of television is more sensitive to light 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.570
 little detailed observation of the 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.970
 images allows to affirm that the object 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.950
 does not fall inside the crater but 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.680
 that moves in a much more plane 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.900
 distant its appearance in the high portion 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.090
 of the atmosphere its trajectory and its 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.619
 increase in bright seem to indicate 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.750
 that it is a meteor 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.509
 particularly bright too 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.399
 called bolide at this time of year 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.729
 they find active two rains of 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:01.500
 first stars the orionids 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:03.840
 active from October 2 to 7 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.330
 November and they reach their maximum 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.790
 up to 25 meteors per hour the night of 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.979
 October 20 and in the second term the 

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:13.540
 active bullfighting of the first of October 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:16.420
 to November 25 and they reach 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:19.000
 maximum of up to 5 meteors per hour 5 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:21.040
 November they receive those names then 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.170
 the meteors follow trajectories that 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.200
 appear to originate in regions of the 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.400
 constellations of orion and taurus 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.590
 respectively while the 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.090
 Orionids are usually meteors that enter 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.730
 in the terrestrial atmosphere to great 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:36.129
 speed and are small- sized grains 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.079
 of sand producing long traces and 

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:40.720
 little bright ones that last less than a 

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:43.599
 second the bullfights are constituted 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.760
 by somewhat larger fragments it records and 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:47.620
 travel more slowly so 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.409
 they frequently generate fireballs 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:52.810
 that is, very bright meteors can 

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:55.090
 beat Venus in bright that 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:57.879
 move for a few seconds before 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.829
 if the 

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:02.019
 path of the object visible in the 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:04.540
 also money cameras matches the 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:06.459
 that could follow a taurine taking in 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:10.409
 mind that the high money cameras 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:10.409
 point to the 18th s
