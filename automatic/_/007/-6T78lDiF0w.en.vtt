to ask it because his body slam now goes

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.600 
to ask it because his body slam now goes
to<00:00:45.989> full<00:00:46.320> distance<00:00:46.770> in<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.100> direction<00:00:47.340> of

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
to full distance in the direction of

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.779 
to full distance in the direction of
casts<00:00:48.059> until<00:00:48.629> it<00:00:48.840> hits<00:00:49.079> a<00:00:49.200> target<00:00:49.410> so<00:00:50.309> instead

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
casts until it hits a target so instead

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.250 
casts until it hits a target so instead
of<00:00:50.850> going<00:00:51.120> half<00:00:51.570> of<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:51.809> distant<00:00:52.110> when<00:00:52.170> you

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
of going half of the distant when you

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.080 
of going half of the distant when you
click<00:00:52.440> on<00:00:52.530> half<00:00:52.800> of<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.100> arrow<00:00:53.309> it<00:00:53.699> will<00:00:53.820> now

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
click on half of the arrow it will now

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.970 
click on half of the arrow it will now
travel<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:54.750> full<00:00:55.020> distance<00:00:55.289> so<00:00:55.620> this<00:00:55.800> will

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
travel the full distance so this will

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.340 
travel the full distance so this will
make<00:00:56.129> wall<00:00:56.460> jumping<00:00:56.850> easier<00:00:57.210> and<00:00:57.449> thus<00:00:57.719> I<00:00:57.989> will

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
make wall jumping easier and thus I will

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.250 
make wall jumping easier and thus I will
quietly<00:00:58.770> buff<00:00:59.510> the<00:01:00.510> next<00:01:00.780> champion<00:01:01.109> in

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
quietly buff the next champion in

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.349 
quietly buff the next champion in
dispatch<00:01:01.590> is<00:01:01.770> going<00:01:01.949> to<00:01:02.039> be<00:01:02.129> Kassadin<00:01:02.730> he<00:01:03.180> got

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
dispatch is going to be Kassadin he got

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.600 
dispatch is going to be Kassadin he got
nerve<00:01:03.600> because<00:01:03.809> his<00:01:04.049> rip<00:01:04.290> walk<00:01:04.559> now<00:01:04.799> takes<00:01:05.100> 20

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
nerve because his rip walk now takes 20

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.240 
nerve because his rip walk now takes 20
seconds<00:01:05.970> to<00:01:06.119> reset<00:01:06.299> instead<00:01:07.260> of<00:01:07.380> 12<00:01:07.710> seconds

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
seconds to reset instead of 12 seconds

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.969 
seconds to reset instead of 12 seconds
now<00:01:08.700> this<00:01:08.880> reset<00:01:09.330> means<00:01:09.570> that<00:01:09.840> if<00:01:10.290> it<00:01:10.560> resets

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
now this reset means that if it resets

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.950 
now this reset means that if it resets
it<00:01:11.159> takes<00:01:11.400> a<00:01:11.520> normal<00:01:11.909> amount<00:01:12.090> of<00:01:12.270> mana<00:01:12.479> but<00:01:12.780> if

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
it takes a normal amount of mana but if

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.750 
it takes a normal amount of mana but if
it<00:01:13.110> doesn't<00:01:13.350> reset<00:01:13.830> so<00:01:13.979> within<00:01:14.189> this<00:01:14.310> 20

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
it doesn't reset so within this 20

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.270 
it doesn't reset so within this 20
seconds<00:01:15.210> and<00:01:15.390> use<00:01:15.840> it<00:01:15.990> again<00:01:16.350> it's<00:01:16.920> got<00:01:17.100> to<00:01:17.189> be

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
seconds and use it again it's got to be

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.010 
seconds and use it again it's got to be
causing<00:01:17.549> double<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.270> amount<00:01:18.330> of<00:01:18.509> her<00:01:18.630> casting

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
causing double the amount of her casting

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.719 
causing double the amount of her casting
but<00:01:19.380> is<00:01:19.530> also<00:01:19.740> going<00:01:19.979> to<00:01:20.040> be<00:01:20.159> dealing<00:01:20.280> double

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
but is also going to be dealing double

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.539 
but is also going to be dealing double
the<00:01:20.820> damage<00:01:21.000> now<00:01:21.990> this<00:01:22.439> didn't<00:01:22.860> get<00:01:22.950> used<00:01:23.189> to

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
the damage now this didn't get used to

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.700 
the damage now this didn't get used to
quite<00:01:23.970> often<00:01:24.240> but<00:01:24.930> in<00:01:25.049> teamfights<00:01:25.229> it

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
quite often but in teamfights it

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.320 
quite often but in teamfights it
definitely<00:01:26.189> did<00:01:26.369> but<00:01:26.520> if<00:01:26.640> you<00:01:26.759> want<00:01:26.909> to<00:01:26.970> escape

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
definitely did but if you want to escape

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.539 
definitely did but if you want to escape
for<00:01:27.570> instance<00:01:27.990> then<00:01:28.740> it's<00:01:28.950> going<00:01:29.130> to<00:01:29.189> be<00:01:29.340> D

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
for instance then it's going to be D

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.880 
for instance then it's going to be D
costing<00:01:30.420> a<00:01:30.479> lot<00:01:30.509> of<00:01:30.869> mana<00:01:31.049> and<00:01:31.170> maybe<00:01:31.560> you<00:01:31.770> will

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
costing a lot of mana and maybe you will

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.830 
costing a lot of mana and maybe you will
get<00:01:32.009> out<00:01:32.220> of<00:01:32.369> mana<00:01:32.520> this<00:01:32.820> time<00:01:33.060> so<00:01:33.299> I<00:01:33.329> will<00:01:33.570> call

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
get out of mana this time so I will call

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.429 
get out of mana this time so I will call
this<00:01:34.020> a<00:01:34.200> nerve<00:01:34.560> it's<00:01:35.369> Kassadin<00:01:35.880> still<00:01:36.210> viable

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:36.439 
this a nerve it's Kassadin still viable

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:40.730 
this a nerve it's Kassadin still viable
yes<00:01:37.439> probably<00:01:38.250> he<00:01:38.729> is<00:01:39.290> but<00:01:40.290> he<00:01:40.470> will<00:01:40.619> get

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
yes probably he is but he will get

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.830 
yes probably he is but he will get
nerves<00:01:40.979> a<00:01:41.130> little<00:01:41.250> bit<00:01:41.430> so<00:01:41.729> you<00:01:42.270> won't<00:01:42.509> see<00:01:42.659> him

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
nerves a little bit so you won't see him

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.420 
nerves a little bit so you won't see him
that<00:01:43.020> this<00:01:43.320> often<00:01:43.740> anymore<00:01:43.920> it's<00:01:44.159> not<00:01:44.310> going

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
that this often anymore it's not going

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:45.859 
that this often anymore it's not going
to<00:01:44.520> be<00:01:44.610> that<00:01:44.640> easy<00:01:44.850> anymore<00:01:45.210> because<00:01:45.540> he<00:01:45.750> has

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
to be that easy anymore because he has

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.990 
to be that easy anymore because he has
to<00:01:45.899> choose<00:01:46.320> whether<00:01:46.950> he<00:01:47.159> wants<00:01:47.430> to<00:01:47.460> engage<00:01:47.610> or

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
to choose whether he wants to engage or

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.240 
to choose whether he wants to engage or
not<00:01:48.180> because<00:01:48.420> if<00:01:49.200> he<00:01:49.380> wants<00:01:49.619> escape<00:01:50.070> it's

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
not because if he wants escape it's

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.380 
not because if he wants escape it's
gonna<00:01:50.399> cost<00:01:50.909> a<00:01:51.090> lot<00:01:51.329> of<00:01:51.390> mana<00:01:52.759> next<00:01:53.759> up<00:01:53.909> is<00:01:54.060> kill

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
gonna cost a lot of mana next up is kill

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.660 
gonna cost a lot of mana next up is kill
she<00:01:55.140> is<00:01:55.290> already<00:01:55.560> very<00:01:55.860> strong<00:01:56.280> with<00:01:56.460> now<00:01:56.610> she

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
she is already very strong with now she

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.209 
she is already very strong with now she
got<00:01:57.030> a<00:01:57.299> another<00:01:57.990> buff<00:01:58.320> for<00:01:58.530> some<00:01:58.710> reason<00:01:59.070> and

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
got a another buff for some reason and

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.069 
got a another buff for some reason and
we<00:01:59.340> don't<00:01:59.490> know<00:01:59.700> why<00:01:59.909> because<00:02:00.329> it<00:02:00.479> is<00:02:00.600> a<00:02:00.630> bug

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
we don't know why because it is a bug

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.950 
we don't know why because it is a bug
apparently<00:02:01.860> but<00:02:02.490> it<00:02:03.030> means<00:02:03.270> that<00:02:03.570> she<00:02:03.810> will

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
apparently but it means that she will

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.069 
apparently but it means that she will
get<00:02:04.079> 2.5<00:02:04.619> at<00:02:05.009> XP<00:02:05.399> per<00:02:05.549> level<00:02:05.729> instead<00:02:06.149> of<00:02:06.299> 2.2

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
get 2.5 at XP per level instead of 2.2

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.020 
get 2.5 at XP per level instead of 2.2
attack<00:02:07.469> speed<00:02:07.710> per<00:02:07.860> level<00:02:08.009> which<00:02:08.610> is<00:02:08.759> nice<00:02:09.000> so

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
attack speed per level which is nice so

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.910 
attack speed per level which is nice so
I<00:02:09.239> will<00:02:09.450> definitely<00:02:09.660> call<00:02:10.080> you<00:02:10.110> guys<00:02:10.319> to<00:02:10.590> play

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
I will definitely call you guys to play

I will definitely call you guys to play
kill<00:02:11.250> right<00:02:11.489> now<00:02:11.550> because<00:02:12.060> this<00:02:12.360> is<00:02:12.420> a<00:02:12.569> bug<00:02:12.870> and

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
kill right now because this is a bug and

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.630 
kill right now because this is a bug and
it<00:02:13.110> will<00:02:13.230> get

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
it will get

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.700 
it will get
so<00:02:14.300> if<00:02:14.450> you<00:02:14.600> make<00:02:14.750> use<00:02:14.930> right<00:02:15.290> now<00:02:15.319> you're

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:15.710 
so if you make use right now you're

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:18.520 
so if you make use right now you're
probably<00:02:15.980> going<00:02:16.310> to<00:02:16.400> be<00:02:16.490> Opie<00:02:16.850> a<00:02:17.450> she<00:02:17.810> viable

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
probably going to be Opie a she viable

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.720 
probably going to be Opie a she viable
yes<00:02:18.860> user<00:02:19.370> now<00:02:20.740> then<00:02:21.740> the<00:02:21.890> next<00:02:22.069> one<00:02:22.310> which<00:02:22.550> we

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
yes user now then the next one which we

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.540 
yes user now then the next one which we
all<00:02:22.910> expected<00:02:23.630> was<00:02:24.350> mall<00:02:24.650> now<00:02:25.190> he<00:02:25.250> got

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
all expected was mall now he got

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.760 
all expected was mall now he got
nerfed<00:02:25.819> because<00:02:26.420> he<00:02:26.569> was<00:02:26.720> simply<00:02:27.020> to<00:02:27.230> OB<00:02:27.590> in

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:27.770 
nerfed because he was simply to OB in

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:30.280 
nerfed because he was simply to OB in
soloq<00:02:28.310> he<00:02:28.580> dominated<00:02:29.209> the<00:02:29.390> ladder<00:02:29.630> you<00:02:30.080> got<00:02:30.260> a

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
soloq he dominated the ladder you got a

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.350 
soloq he dominated the ladder you got a
significant<00:02:31.070> higher<00:02:31.310> win<00:02:31.760> rate<00:02:31.970> than<00:02:32.150> he<00:02:32.209> had

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
significant higher win rate than he had

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.270 
significant higher win rate than he had
before<00:02:32.510> and<00:02:32.780> they<00:02:33.110> had<00:02:33.380> to<00:02:33.560> nerve<00:02:33.740> it<00:02:33.920> and<00:02:34.100> they

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
before and they had to nerve it and they

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.910 
before and they had to nerve it and they
did<00:02:34.490> so<00:02:35.030> what<00:02:35.660> did<00:02:35.810> it<00:02:35.959> was<00:02:36.170> they<00:02:36.470> nerfed<00:02:36.800> is

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
did so what did it was they nerfed is

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.729 
did so what did it was they nerfed is
based<00:02:37.280> movement<00:02:37.640> speeds<00:02:38.030> now<00:02:38.320> 325<00:02:39.320> instead<00:02:39.650> of

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:39.739 
based movement speeds now 325 instead of

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:41.830 
based movement speeds now 325 instead of
330<00:02:40.190> which<00:02:41.090> was<00:02:41.239> definitely<00:02:41.690> necessary

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
330 which was definitely necessary

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.600 
330 which was definitely necessary
because<00:02:42.260> he<00:02:42.440> get<00:02:42.620> way<00:02:43.010> too<00:02:43.069> much<00:02:43.340> mobility

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
because he get way too much mobility

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.540 
because he get way too much mobility
with<00:02:43.970> Triforce<00:02:44.480> and<00:02:44.780> bladed<00:02:45.680> ruined<00:02:46.010> king<00:02:46.190> so

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
with Triforce and bladed ruined king so

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:48.610 
with Triforce and bladed ruined king so
that's<00:02:47.180> a<00:02:47.420> nice<00:02:47.690> nerve<00:02:48.020> i<00:02:48.200> would<00:02:48.350> say<00:02:48.500> i'm<00:02:48.590> not

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
that's a nice nerve i would say i'm not

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.410 
that's a nice nerve i would say i'm not
sure<00:02:48.920> if<00:02:49.070> five<00:02:49.370> movement<00:02:49.850> speeds<00:02:50.060> gonna<00:02:50.209> do

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
sure if five movement speeds gonna do

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.300 
sure if five movement speeds gonna do
the<00:02:50.540> job<00:02:50.750> i<00:02:50.959> think<00:02:51.410> that<00:02:51.620> will<00:02:51.800> not<00:02:51.980> really

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
the job i think that will not really

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.060 
the job i think that will not really
nerve<00:02:52.550> him<00:02:52.730> too<00:02:52.880> much<00:02:53.060> but<00:02:53.720> it's<00:02:54.350> something<00:02:54.500> so

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070 
nerve him too much but it's something so

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:56.890 
nerve him too much but it's something so
i'm<00:02:55.160> happy<00:02:55.340> with<00:02:55.580> that<00:02:55.730> then<00:02:56.239> we<00:02:56.360> have<00:02:56.570> is<00:02:56.690> is

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
i'm happy with that then we have is is

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.370 
i'm happy with that then we have is is
void<00:02:57.410> ooze<00:02:57.590> which<00:02:58.489> got<00:02:58.880> visual<00:02:59.630> updates<00:03:00.080> also

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380 
void ooze which got visual updates also

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.530 
void ooze which got visual updates also
really<00:03:01.130> nice<00:03:01.310> has<00:03:01.670> new<00:03:01.820> particles<00:03:02.300> Luke's

living<00:03:07.220> artillery<00:03:07.670> got<00:03:08.090> nerfed<00:03:08.390> a<00:03:08.570> little<00:03:08.780> bit

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
living artillery got nerfed a little bit

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.130 
living artillery got nerfed a little bit
it's<00:03:09.019> gonna<00:03:09.200> do<00:03:09.410> a<00:03:09.440> little<00:03:09.830> bit<00:03:10.010> less<00:03:10.340> damage

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
it's gonna do a little bit less damage

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:12.850 
it's gonna do a little bit less damage
previously<00:03:12.140> you<00:03:12.290> did<00:03:12.440> one<00:03:12.650> hundred

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 
previously you did one hundred

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:14.890 
previously you did one hundred
twenty-five<00:03:13.519> percent<00:03:13.760> of<00:03:14.090> your<00:03:14.180> base<00:03:14.420> attack

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
twenty-five percent of your base attack

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.630 
twenty-five percent of your base attack
damage<00:03:15.110> now<00:03:15.800> it's<00:03:15.950> going<00:03:16.070> to<00:03:16.130> be<00:03:16.250> one<00:03:16.519> hundred

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 
damage now it's going to be one hundred

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.750 
damage now it's going to be one hundred
percent<00:03:16.820> of<00:03:17.090> your<00:03:17.180> base<00:03:17.330> attack<00:03:17.630> damage<00:03:17.780> so

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
percent of your base attack damage so

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.830 
percent of your base attack damage so
that's<00:03:19.760> a<00:03:19.910> bonus<00:03:20.030> i<00:03:20.360> think<00:03:20.570> that<00:03:20.720> was

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
that's a bonus i think that was

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.630 
that's a bonus i think that was
necessary<00:03:20.989> because<00:03:21.410> that<00:03:21.739> pope<00:03:21.980> was<00:03:22.130> just<00:03:22.430> too

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:22.640 
necessary because that pope was just too

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:25.479 
necessary because that pope was just too
much<00:03:22.670> sometimes<00:03:23.440> I'm<00:03:24.440> really<00:03:25.040> okay<00:03:25.220> with<00:03:25.250> his

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:25.489 
much sometimes I'm really okay with his

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:27.699 
much sometimes I'm really okay with his
these<00:03:26.000> change<00:03:26.269> I<00:03:26.360> think<00:03:26.780> is<00:03:26.900> still<00:03:27.140> viable<00:03:27.350> but

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:27.709 
these change I think is still viable but

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:29.110 
these change I think is still viable but
he's<00:03:27.860> not<00:03:27.980> going<00:03:28.040> to<00:03:28.190> be<00:03:28.280> that<00:03:28.370> Opie<00:03:28.790> anymore

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
he's not going to be that Opie anymore

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.500 
he's not going to be that Opie anymore
so<00:03:29.329> yeah<00:03:30.340> there's<00:03:31.340> also<00:03:31.579> another<00:03:31.760> Champion<00:03:32.390> it

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
so yeah there's also another Champion it

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:34.150 
so yeah there's also another Champion it
had<00:03:32.660> to<00:03:32.780> be<00:03:32.810> nerved<00:03:33.079> and<00:03:33.350> that<00:03:33.560> is<00:03:33.680> my<00:03:33.860> okay

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:34.160 
had to be nerved and that is my okay

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.310 
had to be nerved and that is my okay
he's<00:03:34.700> shown<00:03:35.090> to<00:03:35.269> be<00:03:35.390> really<00:03:35.870> strong<00:03:36.079> in<00:03:36.230> the

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:36.320 
he's shown to be really strong in the

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:39.069 
he's shown to be really strong in the
top<00:03:36.500> lane<00:03:36.709> and<00:03:36.950> he<00:03:37.850> has<00:03:38.060> to<00:03:38.269> be<00:03:38.360> taken<00:03:38.750> down<00:03:38.870> and

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:39.079 
top lane and he has to be taken down and

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:40.900 
top lane and he has to be taken down and
right<00:03:39.290> I<00:03:39.320> decided<00:03:39.739> all<00:03:40.040> right<00:03:40.190> let's<00:03:40.670> nerve

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
right I decided all right let's nerve

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:44.289 
right I decided all right let's nerve
this<00:03:41.200> it's<00:03:42.200> simply<00:03:42.500> do<00:03:42.739> strong<00:03:43.070> so<00:03:43.579> his<00:03:43.730> W<00:03:44.120> got

00:03:44.289 --> 00:03:44.299 
this it's simply do strong so his W got

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:47.380 
this it's simply do strong so his W got
nerve<00:03:44.450> twisted<00:03:45.079> advance<00:03:45.230> it<00:03:46.190> previously<00:03:46.820> did

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:47.390 
nerve twisted advance it previously did

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:50.740 
nerve twisted advance it previously did
fifteen<00:03:48.170> percent<00:03:48.500> max<00:03:48.890> health<00:03:49.370> damage<00:03:49.850> when

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750 
fifteen percent max health damage when

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:52.509 
fifteen percent max health damage when
you<00:03:50.870> use<00:03:51.049> it<00:03:51.079> down<00:03:51.320> the<00:03:51.410> next<00:03:51.680> level<00:03:51.980> now<00:03:52.340> it's

00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:52.519 
you use it down the next level now it's

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:55.120 
you use it down the next level now it's
doing<00:03:52.730> thirteen<00:03:53.329> percent<00:03:53.660> max<00:03:53.989> damage<00:03:54.260> so

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:55.130 
doing thirteen percent max damage so

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:56.830 
doing thirteen percent max damage so
that's<00:03:55.489> really<00:03:55.700> nice<00:03:55.940> two<00:03:56.150> percent<00:03:56.450> less<00:03:56.600> can

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
that's really nice two percent less can

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.479 
that's really nice two percent less can
actually<00:03:57.200> mean<00:03:57.350> a<00:03:57.380> lot<00:03:57.739> against<00:03:58.040> of<00:03:58.190> tanki

00:03:58.479 --> 00:03:58.489 
actually mean a lot against of tanki

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:00.819 
actually mean a lot against of tanki
champions<00:03:58.970> then<00:03:59.630> we<00:03:59.780> have<00:03:59.930> the<00:04:00.140> ability<00:04:00.650> route

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:00.829 
champions then we have the ability route

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:02.920 
champions then we have the ability route
power<00:04:01.160> ratio<00:04:01.489> which<00:04:01.910> is<00:04:02.060> also<00:04:02.329> nerved<00:04:02.780> a

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
power ratio which is also nerved a

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:04.270 
power ratio which is also nerved a
little<00:04:03.170> bit<00:04:03.290> one<00:04:03.500> percent<00:04:03.799> less<00:04:03.920> than<00:04:04.100> it<00:04:04.190> was

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 
little bit one percent less than it was

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.060 
little bit one percent less than it was
before<00:04:05.049> great<00:04:06.049> job<00:04:06.260> right<00:04:06.530> he<00:04:06.799> definitely

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:07.070 
before great job right he definitely

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:08.860 
before great job right he definitely
deserved<00:04:07.549> it<00:04:07.670> because<00:04:07.760> maokai<00:04:08.239> was<00:04:08.390> simply

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.870 
deserved it because maokai was simply

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:11.349 
deserved it because maokai was simply
too<00:04:09.140> strong<00:04:09.200> then<00:04:10.130> his<00:04:10.280> ultimate<00:04:10.790> now<00:04:11.000> has<00:04:11.329> a

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:11.359 
too strong then his ultimate now has a

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:13.420 
too strong then his ultimate now has a
duration<00:04:11.959> which<00:04:12.470> it<00:04:12.620> didn't<00:04:12.950> have<00:04:13.070> before<00:04:13.190> now

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 
duration which it didn't have before now

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:15.880 
duration which it didn't have before now
you<00:04:13.670> can<00:04:13.880> only<00:04:14.060> execute<00:04:14.540> it<00:04:14.840> for<00:04:15.019> 10<00:04:15.320> seconds

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:15.890 
you can only execute it for 10 seconds

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:18.550 
you can only execute it for 10 seconds
and<00:04:16.070> then<00:04:16.579> it<00:04:16.640> will<00:04:16.880> run<00:04:17.090> out<00:04:17.120> i<00:04:17.600> think<00:04:18.260> they

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:18.560 
and then it will run out i think they

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.289 
and then it will run out i think they
changed<00:04:18.769> your<00:04:19.039> grade<00:04:19.070> i<00:04:19.280> think<00:04:19.700> he<00:04:19.880> will<00:04:20.060> still

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:20.299 
changed your grade i think he will still

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:22.690 
changed your grade i think he will still
be<00:04:20.450> viable<00:04:20.600> because<00:04:20.989> maokai<00:04:21.709> is<00:04:21.919> really<00:04:22.340> tanky

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:22.700 
be viable because maokai is really tanky

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:24.550 
be viable because maokai is really tanky
and<00:04:22.880> he<00:04:22.940> does<00:04:23.090> a<00:04:23.120> lot<00:04:23.300> of<00:04:23.360> damage<00:04:23.630> so<00:04:24.320> he's

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:24.560 
and he does a lot of damage so he's

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.409 
and he does a lot of damage so he's
still<00:04:24.890> one<00:04:25.070> of<00:04:25.130> the<00:04:25.280> champion<00:04:25.729> to<00:04:25.849> one<00:04:26.030> having

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:26.419 
still one of the champion to one having

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:27.430 
still one of the champion to one having
your<00:04:26.539> team

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 
your team

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.620 
your team
also<00:04:27.620> has<00:04:27.740> a<00:04:27.770> lot<00:04:27.980> of<00:04:28.010> CC<00:04:28.430> so<00:04:28.760> yeah<00:04:28.910> he<00:04:29.510> is

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:29.630 
also has a lot of CC so yeah he is

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:31.810 
also has a lot of CC so yeah he is
definitely<00:04:29.840> still<00:04:30.200> viable<00:04:30.440> but<00:04:31.280> he<00:04:31.460> got<00:04:31.790> a

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:31.820 
definitely still viable but he got a

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:34.410 
definitely still viable but he got a
little<00:04:32.030> bit<00:04:32.210> less<00:04:32.360> strong<00:04:32.690> which<00:04:33.140> is<00:04:33.260> nice

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:34.420 
little bit less strong which is nice

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:37.000 
little bit less strong which is nice
Morgana's<00:04:35.420> next<00:04:35.930> one<00:04:36.110> in<00:04:36.290> this<00:04:36.410> patch<00:04:36.680> and

Morgana's next one in this patch and

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:39.490 
Morgana's next one in this patch and
that's<00:04:37.610> nice<00:04:37.970> one<00:04:38.240> because<00:04:38.480> she<00:04:38.690> had<00:04:38.990> to<00:04:39.350> be

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:39.500 
that's nice one because she had to be

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.280 
that's nice one because she had to be
nerves<00:04:39.860> her<00:04:40.370> black<00:04:40.610> shield<00:04:40.880> now<00:04:41.360> blocks<00:04:41.960> less

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:42.290 
nerves her black shield now blocks less

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:43.990 
nerves her black shield now blocks less
damage<00:04:42.560> on<00:04:42.680> the<00:04:42.740> lower<00:04:42.890> levels<00:04:43.310> and<00:04:43.520> it's

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:44.000 
damage on the lower levels and it's

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.550 
damage on the lower levels and it's
about<00:04:44.210> the<00:04:44.360> same<00:04:44.540> on<00:04:44.780> the<00:04:44.870> higher<00:04:45.050> levels<00:04:45.440> and

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:45.560 
about the same on the higher levels and

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.340 
about the same on the higher levels and
her<00:04:45.950> ultimate<00:04:46.490> is<00:04:46.670> dealing<00:04:47.240> a<00:04:47.390> whole<00:04:47.690> lot<00:04:48.170> of

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:48.350 
her ultimate is dealing a whole lot of

less damage she did too much damage
support<00:04:51.440> we<00:04:51.530> all<00:04:51.710> know<00:04:51.920> that<00:04:51.950> because<00:04:52.340> if<00:04:52.580> you

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:52.670 
support we all know that because if you

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:54.790 
support we all know that because if you
look<00:04:52.820> at<00:04:52.970> that<00:04:53.060> damage<00:04:53.480> dealt<00:04:53.720> stats<00:04:54.110> at<00:04:54.410> the

look at that damage dealt stats at the

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.050 
look at that damage dealt stats at the
end<00:04:54.950> of<00:04:55.070> your<00:04:55.160> game<00:04:55.400> you<00:04:55.550> always<00:04:55.820> see<00:04:55.970> the

end of your game you always see the

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:58.270 
end of your game you always see the
Morgana<00:04:56.390> being<00:04:56.720> on<00:04:57.020> the<00:04:57.350> top<00:04:57.590> for<00:04:57.800> some<00:04:57.950> reason

00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:58.280 
Morgana being on the top for some reason

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:00.040 
Morgana being on the top for some reason
while<00:04:58.490> she<00:04:58.700> is<00:04:58.760> the<00:04:58.850> support<00:04:59.270> that<00:04:59.720> doesn't

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.050 
while she is the support that doesn't

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:02.410 
while she is the support that doesn't
even<00:05:00.140> make<00:05:00.320> any<00:05:00.380> sense<00:05:00.620> so<00:05:01.340> here<00:05:01.760> you<00:05:01.910> go<00:05:01.940> get

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:02.420 
even make any sense so here you go get

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:05.200 
even make any sense so here you go get
this<00:05:02.600> nerve<00:05:02.870> and<00:05:03.430> be<00:05:04.430> done<00:05:04.610> with<00:05:04.760> it<00:05:04.790> I<00:05:04.970> think

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:05.210 
this nerve and be done with it I think

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:07.570 
this nerve and be done with it I think
she's<00:05:05.420> still<00:05:05.690> viable<00:05:05.990> but<00:05:06.860> she's<00:05:07.010> gonna<00:05:07.160> be<00:05:07.250> a

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:07.580 
she's still viable but she's gonna be a

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:10.750 
she's still viable but she's gonna be a
little<00:05:07.880> bit<00:05:08.000> less<00:05:08.120> trunk<00:05:08.450> that's<00:05:08.780> it<00:05:09.760> orianna

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:10.760 
little bit less trunk that's it orianna

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:12.490 
little bit less trunk that's it orianna
also<00:05:11.180> got<00:05:11.360> nerve<00:05:11.540> dispatch<00:05:11.990> which<00:05:12.320> I

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:12.500 
also got nerve dispatch which I

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:14.740 
also got nerve dispatch which I
absolutely<00:05:12.890> did<00:05:13.670> not<00:05:13.700> expect<00:05:13.970> because<00:05:14.540> I

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:14.750 
absolutely did not expect because I

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:16.210 
absolutely did not expect because I
thought<00:05:14.960> she<00:05:15.140> was<00:05:15.260> really<00:05:15.560> bad<00:05:15.710> and<00:05:15.860> say<00:05:16.040> she

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:16.220 
thought she was really bad and say she

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:17.950 
thought she was really bad and say she
was<00:05:16.250> just<00:05:16.610> a<00:05:16.790> good<00:05:17.030> champion<00:05:17.480> to<00:05:17.570> play<00:05:17.750> with<00:05:17.930> a

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:17.960 
was just a good champion to play with a

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:20.650 
was just a good champion to play with a
lame<00:05:18.260> but<00:05:19.070> they<00:05:19.250> saw<00:05:19.490> that<00:05:19.520> her<00:05:19.940> autotext<00:05:20.540> were

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:20.660 
lame but they saw that her autotext were

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:21.910 
lame but they saw that her autotext were
a<00:05:20.690> little<00:05:20.900> bit<00:05:21.080> too<00:05:21.170> strong<00:05:21.470> in<00:05:21.590> the<00:05:21.650> early

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:21.920 
a little bit too strong in the early

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:24.190 
a little bit too strong in the early
game<00:05:22.100> which<00:05:22.790> is<00:05:22.820> probably<00:05:23.210> right<00:05:23.630> because<00:05:24.020> if

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:24.200 
game which is probably right because if

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:25.540 
game which is probably right because if
you<00:05:24.290> oughta<00:05:24.470> take<00:05:24.710> a<00:05:24.770> lot<00:05:25.040> then<00:05:25.370> you're

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:25.550 
you oughta take a lot then you're

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:27.730 
you oughta take a lot then you're
probably<00:05:25.940> just<00:05:26.240> gonna<00:05:26.420> win<00:05:26.690> the<00:05:26.810> lane<00:05:27.020> so<00:05:27.560> what

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:27.740 
probably just gonna win the lane so what

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:30.130 
probably just gonna win the lane so what
they<00:05:27.890> did<00:05:27.950> was<00:05:28.070> the<00:05:28.460> nerve<00:05:29.150> to<00:05:29.360> based<00:05:29.600> attack

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:30.140 
they did was the nerve to based attack

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:33.640 
they did was the nerve to based attack
damage<00:05:30.320> from<00:05:30.770> Ariana<00:05:31.130> from<00:05:31.520> 47<00:05:32.390> to<00:05:32.419> 41<00:05:33.140> which

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:33.650 
damage from Ariana from 47 to 41 which

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:35.590 
damage from Ariana from 47 to 41 which
is<00:05:33.800> six<00:05:34.190> less<00:05:34.490> which<00:05:34.820> is<00:05:34.940> actually<00:05:35.210> a

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:35.600 
is six less which is actually a

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.470 
is six less which is actually a
significant<00:05:36.440> number<00:05:36.470> which<00:05:36.860> i<00:05:36.980> didn't<00:05:37.220> expect

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:37.480 
significant number which i didn't expect

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:40.240 
significant number which i didn't expect
but<00:05:38.480> it's<00:05:38.600> a<00:05:38.720> lot<00:05:38.900> I<00:05:39.380> think<00:05:39.830> she's<00:05:40.040> still

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:40.250 
but it's a lot I think she's still

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:41.890 
but it's a lot I think she's still
viable<00:05:40.520> she's<00:05:40.880> just<00:05:41.090> going<00:05:41.330> to<00:05:41.419> be<00:05:41.510> dealing<00:05:41.690> a

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:41.900 
viable she's just going to be dealing a

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:45.070 
viable she's just going to be dealing a
little<00:05:42.200> bit<00:05:42.290> less<00:05:42.530> damage<00:05:42.860> with<00:05:43.130> ad<00:05:43.930> so<00:05:44.930> you're

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:45.080 
little bit less damage with ad so you're

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:47.020 
little bit less damage with ad so you're
going<00:05:45.169> to<00:05:45.260> be<00:05:45.350> needing<00:05:45.380> a<00:05:45.710> lot<00:05:45.980> more<00:05:46.190> ap<00:05:46.790> to

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:47.030 
going to be needing a lot more ap to

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:48.550 
going to be needing a lot more ap to
deal<00:05:47.240> the<00:05:47.419> damage<00:05:47.570> with<00:05:47.870> your<00:05:47.990> other<00:05:48.140> text

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:48.560 
deal the damage with your other text

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:51.250 
deal the damage with your other text
which<00:05:48.740> is<00:05:48.860> fine<00:05:49.210> she's<00:05:50.210> still<00:05:50.300> viable<00:05:50.630> but

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:51.260 
which is fine she's still viable but

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.890 
which is fine she's still viable but
you're<00:05:52.100> gonna<00:05:52.580> be<00:05:52.760> having<00:05:53.150> a<00:05:53.240> weaker<00:05:53.600> early

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:53.900 
you're gonna be having a weaker early

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:56.470 
you're gonna be having a weaker early
game<00:05:54.370> rengar<00:05:55.370> is<00:05:55.430> a<00:05:55.550> next<00:05:55.940> one<00:05:56.060> to<00:05:56.210> get<00:05:56.330> the

game rengar is a next one to get the
nerve<00:05:56.660> hammer<00:05:56.930> because<00:05:57.380> his<00:05:57.620> ultimate<00:05:58.100> now

00:05:58.210 --> 00:05:58.220 
nerve hammer because his ultimate now

00:05:58.220 --> 00:05:59.980 
nerve hammer because his ultimate now
has<00:05:58.490> longer<00:05:58.940> cool<00:05:59.120> downs<00:05:59.330> on<00:05:59.540> this<00:05:59.570> early

00:05:59.980 --> 00:05:59.990 
has longer cool downs on this early

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:01.900 
has longer cool downs on this early
levels<00:06:00.350> this<00:06:00.980> means<00:06:01.250> that<00:06:01.340> he<00:06:01.520> will<00:06:01.550> not<00:06:01.850> be

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:01.910 
levels this means that he will not be

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:03.610 
levels this means that he will not be
able<00:06:02.090> to<00:06:02.330> send<00:06:02.600> next<00:06:02.870> to<00:06:02.930> you<00:06:03.020> every<00:06:03.230> time<00:06:03.560> you

able to send next to you every time you

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:05.680 
able to send next to you every time you

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:05.690 
get to lane which is a deserved nerve

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:07.960 
get to lane which is a deserved nerve
along<00:06:06.590> with<00:06:06.620> that<00:06:06.800> they<00:06:07.190> also<00:06:07.370> added<00:06:07.730> more

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:07.970 
along with that they also added more

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:10.180 
along with that they also added more
range<00:06:08.240> to<00:06:08.419> the<00:06:08.450> warning<00:06:08.900> indicator<00:06:09.350> you<00:06:10.010> won't

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:10.190 
range to the warning indicator you won't

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:13.060 
range to the warning indicator you won't
know<00:06:10.400> when<00:06:10.760> he<00:06:10.940> is<00:06:11.060> around<00:06:11.180> sooner<00:06:11.900> now<00:06:12.050> is<00:06:12.440> he

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:13.070 
know when he is around sooner now is he

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:15.190 
know when he is around sooner now is he
still<00:06:13.250> viable<00:06:13.520> I<00:06:13.880> honestly<00:06:14.450> don't<00:06:14.660> think<00:06:14.810> so

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:15.200 
still viable I honestly don't think so

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:17.260 
still viable I honestly don't think so
the<00:06:15.530> main<00:06:15.740> reason<00:06:15.919> he<00:06:16.340> was<00:06:16.520> so<00:06:16.760> strong<00:06:17.060> was

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:17.270 
the main reason he was so strong was

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:19.270 
the main reason he was so strong was
because<00:06:17.630> of<00:06:17.660> his<00:06:17.750> ultimate<00:06:18.320> and<00:06:18.500> that<00:06:19.040> got

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:19.280 
because of his ultimate and that got

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:21.909 
because of his ultimate and that got
nerfed<00:06:19.460> hard<00:06:19.820> dispatch<00:06:20.240> so<00:06:20.810> we<00:06:21.169> will<00:06:21.410> see<00:06:21.740> in

00:06:21.909 --> 00:06:21.919 
nerfed hard dispatch so we will see in

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:25.300 
nerfed hard dispatch so we will see in
game<00:06:22.720> sidra<00:06:23.720> got<00:06:23.900> a<00:06:23.930> bug<00:06:24.169> fix<00:06:24.470> which<00:06:24.950> he<00:06:25.190> will

game sidra got a bug fix which he will
not<00:06:25.640> be<00:06:25.850> happy<00:06:26.210> her<00:06:26.690> ultimate<00:06:26.840> can<00:06:27.230> now<00:06:27.350> be

not be happy her ultimate can now be

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:28.810 
not be happy her ultimate can now be
touched<00:06:27.710> by<00:06:27.860> skills<00:06:28.160> that<00:06:28.280> make<00:06:28.610> their

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:33.080 
definitely a nerve to Sandra but if you
