00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
my legs and I chose an angle you know

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.200 
my legs and I chose an angle you know
after<00:00:34.050> I<00:00:34.110> cut<00:00:34.320> my<00:00:34.469> four<00:00:35.010> legs<00:00:35.489> to<00:00:35.760> it<00:00:35.910> the<00:00:36.000> same

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
after I cut my four legs to it the same

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.950 
after I cut my four legs to it the same
length<00:00:36.570> I<00:00:37.100> then<00:00:38.100> temporarily<00:00:38.820> clamp<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:39.690> legs

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
length I then temporarily clamp the legs

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.760 
length I then temporarily clamp the legs
to<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:40.770> i-beam<00:00:41.160> there<00:00:42.110> and<00:00:43.110> see<00:00:43.379> with<00:00:43.680> the

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
to the i-beam there and see with the

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.150 
to the i-beam there and see with the
angle<00:00:44.190> of<00:00:45.050> the<00:00:46.050> the<00:00:46.320> bottom<00:00:46.680> feet<00:00:46.860> are<00:00:47.039> going

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
angle of the the bottom feet are going

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.970 
angle of the the bottom feet are going
to<00:00:47.219> sit<00:00:47.399> to<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.550> floor<00:00:47.879> and<00:00:48.270> of<00:00:48.360> course<00:00:48.980> the

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
to sit to the floor and of course the

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.040 
to sit to the floor and of course the
feet<00:00:50.219> won't<00:00:50.430> be<00:00:50.579> making<00:00:51.270> contact<00:00:51.870> with<00:00:51.960> the

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
feet won't be making contact with the

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.110 
feet won't be making contact with the
floor<00:00:52.289> unless<00:00:52.559> you<00:00:52.710> go<00:00:52.829> back<00:00:53.039> and<00:00:53.250> cut<00:00:53.460> that

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
floor unless you go back and cut that

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.479 
floor unless you go back and cut that
compound<00:00:54.719> angle<00:00:55.110> at<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.649> feet<00:00:55.890> so<00:00:56.160> you<00:00:56.250> just

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
compound angle at the feet so you just

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.389 
compound angle at the feet so you just
use<00:00:56.760> a<00:00:56.840> straight<00:00:57.840> rule<00:00:58.140> go<00:00:58.469> across<00:00:58.710> there<00:00:59.129> you

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
use a straight rule go across there you

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.400 
use a straight rule go across there you
don't<00:00:59.550> even<00:00:59.670> have<00:01:00.030> to<00:01:00.210> know<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.510> angle<00:01:00.840> in

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
don't even have to know the angle in

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.969 
don't even have to know the angle in
order<00:01:01.649> to<00:01:01.980> get<00:01:02.510> your<00:01:03.510> feet<00:01:03.780> to<00:01:03.989> sit<00:01:04.260> on<00:01:04.680> the

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
order to get your feet to sit on the

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:11.240 
order to get your feet to sit on the
floor<00:01:05.570> flat<00:01:09.260> so<00:01:10.260> that<00:01:10.439> just<00:01:10.680> makes<00:01:10.860> your<00:01:11.010> bench

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
floor flat so that just makes your bench

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.550 
floor flat so that just makes your bench
and<00:01:11.490> that's<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.060> first<00:01:12.299> place<00:01:12.720> to<00:01:12.840> start<00:01:13.020> is

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
and that's the first place to start is

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.410 
and that's the first place to start is
the<00:01:14.010> height<00:01:14.369> that<00:01:14.610> you're<00:01:14.760> comfortable<00:01:15.060> of

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
the height that you're comfortable of

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.380 
the height that you're comfortable of
sitting<00:01:15.780> and<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.650> length<00:01:16.950> is<00:01:17.390> important

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
sitting and the length is important

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.859 
sitting and the length is important
because<00:01:18.930> that<00:01:19.110> determines<00:01:19.820> how<00:01:20.820> close<00:01:21.150> that

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
because that determines how close that

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.570 
because that determines how close that
you'll<00:01:22.140> be<00:01:22.290> to<00:01:22.470> your<00:01:22.590> workpiece<00:01:23.040> and<00:01:23.369> plus

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
you'll be to your workpiece and plus

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.550 
you'll be to your workpiece and plus
your<00:01:23.759> storage<00:01:24.210> how<00:01:24.450> long<00:01:24.689> if<00:01:25.049> you<00:01:25.110> have<00:01:25.259> it<00:01:25.409> too

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
your storage how long if you have it too

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:32.120 
your storage how long if you have it too
long<00:01:29.479> the<00:01:30.479> second<00:01:30.869> step<00:01:31.049> that<00:01:31.110> I<00:01:31.470> chose<00:01:31.890> to

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
long the second step that I chose to

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.969 
long the second step that I chose to
build<00:01:32.280> this<00:01:32.520> with<00:01:32.759> is<00:01:33.030> to<00:01:33.180> make<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.979> workpiece

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
build this with is to make the workpiece

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.179 
build this with is to make the workpiece
table<00:01:35.729> there<00:01:36.290> the<00:01:37.290> overall<00:01:37.590> height<00:01:37.829> on<00:01:38.040> this

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
table there the overall height on this

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.840 
table there the overall height on this
one<00:01:38.430> is<00:01:38.520> about<00:01:38.729> 8<00:01:38.939> inches<00:01:39.180> just<00:01:39.990> pick<00:01:40.200> whatever

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
one is about 8 inches just pick whatever

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.190 
one is about 8 inches just pick whatever
when<00:01:41.850> you're<00:01:41.970> sitting<00:01:42.299> down<00:01:42.509> and<00:01:42.840> you<00:01:43.020> have

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
when you're sitting down and you have

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.240 
when you're sitting down and you have
the<00:01:44.030> drawing<00:01:45.030> knife<00:01:45.299> in<00:01:45.450> your<00:01:45.570> hands<00:01:46.500> what's

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
the drawing knife in your hands what's

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.950 
the drawing knife in your hands what's
comfortable<00:01:47.520> to<00:01:47.909> you<00:01:48.829> so<00:01:49.829> you<00:01:50.310> build<00:01:50.549> that<00:01:50.960> now

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
comfortable to you so you build that now

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.219 
comfortable to you so you build that now
I<00:01:51.990> left<00:01:52.320> all<00:01:52.560> this<00:01:52.740> to<00:01:53.220> where<00:01:53.399> it<00:01:53.490> doesn't

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
I left all this to where it doesn't

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:56.959 
I left all this to where it doesn't
isn't<00:01:55.229> permanent<00:01:55.649> so<00:01:56.280> that<00:01:56.310> I<00:01:56.729> can

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
isn't permanent so that I can

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.149 
isn't permanent so that I can
disassemble<00:01:57.869> this<00:01:58.170> and<00:01:58.469> have<00:01:58.619> a<00:01:58.649> nice<00:01:58.890> sturdy

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
disassemble this and have a nice sturdy

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.959 
disassemble this and have a nice sturdy
bench<00:01:59.520> to<00:01:59.790> using<00:02:00.119> other<00:02:00.270> applications<00:02:01.969> so

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
bench to using other applications so

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.480 
bench to using other applications so
that<00:02:03.149> was<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.420> second<00:02:03.780> step<00:02:04.070> then<00:02:05.070> the<00:02:05.130> third

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
that was the second step then the third

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.180 
that was the second step then the third
step<00:02:05.820> is<00:02:06.090> to<00:02:06.360> build<00:02:06.750> your<00:02:06.899> your<00:02:07.680> head<00:02:07.890> clamp

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
step is to build your your head clamp

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.360 
step is to build your your head clamp
here<00:02:09.379> now<00:02:10.379> normally<00:02:10.800> that<00:02:10.830> would<00:02:11.039> be<00:02:11.160> made<00:02:11.340> out

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
here now normally that would be made out

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.570 
here now normally that would be made out
of<00:02:11.520> hardwood

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
of hardwood

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.490 
of hardwood
but<00:02:13.120> I<00:02:13.150> wouldn't<00:02:13.510> wanna<00:02:13.660> ruin<00:02:13.720> my<00:02:14.050> hardwood

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
but I wouldn't wanna ruin my hardwood

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.160 
but I wouldn't wanna ruin my hardwood
learning<00:02:14.980> here<00:02:15.280> and<00:02:15.700> building<00:02:16.030> a<00:02:16.120> pattern<00:02:16.510> so

learning here and building a pattern so

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.950 
learning here and building a pattern so
it's<00:02:17.350> made<00:02:17.500> out<00:02:17.650> of<00:02:17.740> yellow<00:02:17.830> pine<00:02:18.690> so<00:02:19.690> all<00:02:19.930> I

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:19.960 
it's made out of yellow pine so all I

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:24.000 
it's made out of yellow pine so all I
did<00:02:20.290> was<00:02:20.590> as<00:02:21.220> a<00:02:21.280> drill<00:02:21.760> this<00:02:22.660> hole<00:02:23.080> all<00:02:23.890> the<00:02:23.920> way

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
did was as a drill this hole all the way

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.920 
did was as a drill this hole all the way
through<00:02:24.070> with<00:02:24.820> just<00:02:25.000> a<00:02:25.090> threaded<00:02:25.450> rod<00:02:25.660> with

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
through with just a threaded rod with

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.390 
through with just a threaded rod with
the<00:02:25.960> minute<00:02:26.320> nut<00:02:26.500> on<00:02:26.710> there<00:02:26.920> that's<00:02:27.190> just

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
the minute nut on there that's just

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.290 
the minute nut on there that's just
finger<00:02:27.700> tight

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
finger tight

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.640 
finger tight
I<00:02:28.860> hadn't<00:02:30.000> relieved<00:02:31.000> for<00:02:31.390> the<00:02:31.480> bar<00:02:31.660> clamp<00:02:31.990> area

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
I hadn't relieved for the bar clamp area

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.640 
I hadn't relieved for the bar clamp area
there<00:02:32.910> the<00:02:33.910> bar<00:02:34.120> there<00:02:34.420> and<00:02:34.630> I<00:02:35.320> hadn't

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
there the bar there and I hadn't

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.390 
there the bar there and I hadn't
relieved<00:02:36.040> the<00:02:36.580> clearance<00:02:37.060> for<00:02:37.420> it<00:02:37.480> to<00:02:37.600> sit

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
relieved the clearance for it to sit

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.100 
relieved the clearance for it to sit
inside<00:02:39.400> the<00:02:39.790> sawhorse<00:02:40.240> yeah

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
inside the sawhorse yeah

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:44.490 
inside the sawhorse yeah
so<00:02:41.740> I'm<00:02:41.830> just<00:02:41.950> working<00:02:42.220> with<00:02:42.550> a<00:02:42.660> oversize<00:02:43.690> two

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
so I'm just working with a oversize two

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.260 
so I'm just working with a oversize two
six<00:02:44.950> maybe<00:02:45.310> it<00:02:45.430> was<00:02:45.550> a<00:02:45.610> tube<00:02:45.790> of<00:02:45.910> ten<00:02:46.090> I<00:02:46.120> don't

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:46.270 
six maybe it was a tube of ten I don't

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:48.480 
six maybe it was a tube of ten I don't
want<00:02:46.510> to<00:02:46.570> remember<00:02:47.010> I'll<00:02:48.010> start<00:02:48.310> with<00:02:48.430> that

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:48.490 
want to remember I'll start with that

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:52.470 
want to remember I'll start with that
drill<00:02:49.180> a<00:02:49.210> hole<00:02:49.480> into<00:02:50.140> the<00:02:50.380> board<00:02:50.970> make<00:02:51.970> cut<00:02:52.360> the

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
drill a hole into the board make cut the

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:53.880 
drill a hole into the board make cut the
board<00:02:52.690> where<00:02:52.959> you<00:02:53.050> have<00:02:53.200> clearance<00:02:53.500> so<00:02:53.740> that

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
board where you have clearance so that

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:55.590 
board where you have clearance so that
when<00:02:54.010> you<00:02:54.100> swing<00:02:54.430> it<00:02:54.459> in<00:02:54.670> the<00:02:54.760> bottom<00:02:55.420> of<00:02:55.510> the

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.600 
when you swing it in the bottom of the

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.930 
when you swing it in the bottom of the
radius<00:02:55.959> it<00:02:56.050> doesn't<00:02:56.350> hit<00:02:56.530> the<00:02:56.560> floor<00:02:56.890> I<00:02:57.220> hadn't

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
radius it doesn't hit the floor I hadn't

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.900 
radius it doesn't hit the floor I hadn't
added<00:02:58.209> on<00:02:58.360> the<00:02:58.510> the<00:02:59.280> triangulated<00:03:00.280> foot<00:03:00.610> there

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
added on the the triangulated foot there

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.060 
added on the the triangulated foot there
that<00:03:01.120> you<00:03:01.240> can<00:03:01.360> reach<00:03:01.540> from<00:03:01.750> with<00:03:02.590> both<00:03:02.830> feet

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.070 
that you can reach from with both feet

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:05.699 
that you can reach from with both feet
or<00:03:03.340> one<00:03:03.880> foot<00:03:04.150> from<00:03:04.270> either<00:03:04.570> side<00:03:04.810> I<00:03:05.200> find<00:03:05.590> that

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
or one foot from either side I find that

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:11.610 
or one foot from either side I find that
to<00:03:05.830> be<00:03:05.890> real<00:03:06.160> handy<00:03:08.640> and<00:03:09.640> then<00:03:09.850> I<00:03:10.000> just<00:03:10.620> the

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
to be real handy and then I just the

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.070 
to be real handy and then I just the
next<00:03:11.890> step<00:03:12.100> come<00:03:12.640> up<00:03:12.820> here<00:03:13.150> figure<00:03:13.660> about<00:03:13.840> my

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:14.080 
next step come up here figure about my

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.110 
next step come up here figure about my
angle<00:03:14.290> with<00:03:14.410> a<00:03:14.470> pencil<00:03:14.920> I<00:03:15.250> wanted<00:03:15.760> to<00:03:15.850> cut<00:03:16.030> it

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
angle with a pencil I wanted to cut it

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.040 
angle with a pencil I wanted to cut it
out<00:03:16.300> on<00:03:16.480> the<00:03:16.600> board<00:03:16.780> just<00:03:17.620> hand<00:03:17.950> drew<00:03:18.160> me<00:03:18.340> on<00:03:18.430> a

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:19.050 
out on the board just hand drew me on a

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:22.500 
out on the board just hand drew me on a
radius<00:03:20.050> there<00:03:20.400> so<00:03:21.400> it's<00:03:21.550> all<00:03:21.670> one<00:03:21.970> board<00:03:22.239> right

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
radius there so it's all one board right

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.160 
radius there so it's all one board right
now<00:03:22.780> not<00:03:23.410> much<00:03:23.650> to<00:03:24.100> lose<00:03:24.280> there<00:03:24.750> and<00:03:25.750> have<00:03:26.019> it

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
now not much to lose there and have it

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:28.170 
now not much to lose there and have it
to<00:03:26.290> where<00:03:26.440> when<00:03:26.620> I<00:03:26.650> push<00:03:26.920> down<00:03:26.950> with<00:03:27.580> my<00:03:27.790> foot

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
to where when I push down with my foot

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.650 
to where when I push down with my foot
that<00:03:29.110> I<00:03:29.260> knew<00:03:29.440> it<00:03:29.530> was<00:03:29.650> going<00:03:29.830> to<00:03:29.920> strike<00:03:30.220> my

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
that I knew it was going to strike my

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:35.580 
that I knew it was going to strike my
table<00:03:32.070> the<00:03:33.070> head<00:03:33.280> would<00:03:33.930> then<00:03:34.930> I<00:03:35.019> just<00:03:35.230> cut<00:03:35.470> me

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
table the head would then I just cut me

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.130 
table the head would then I just cut me
some<00:03:35.769> angle<00:03:36.160> same<00:03:37.150> pieces<00:03:37.420> of<00:03:37.630> wood<00:03:37.750> the<00:03:37.930> same

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:38.140 
some angle same pieces of wood the same

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:39.720 
some angle same pieces of wood the same
angle<00:03:38.560> and<00:03:38.739> laminate<00:03:39.130> it<00:03:39.280> and<00:03:39.340> screwed<00:03:39.640> them

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
angle and laminate it and screwed them

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:44.370 
angle and laminate it and screwed them
together<00:03:39.850> to<00:03:40.269> give<00:03:40.390> us<00:03:40.420> overall<00:03:40.959> thickness<00:03:43.380> to

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.380 
together to give us overall thickness to

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:45.570 
together to give us overall thickness to
be<00:03:44.470> able<00:03:44.620> to<00:03:44.680> reach<00:03:44.800> all<00:03:44.980> the<00:03:45.070> way<00:03:45.130> across<00:03:45.310> the

for other applications one of the

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:17.729 
for other applications one of the
drawbacks<00:04:15.370> is<00:04:15.910> if<00:04:16.450> you<00:04:16.660> don't<00:04:16.900> screw<00:04:17.380> this

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 
drawbacks is if you don't screw this

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:22.260 
drawbacks is if you don't screw this
board<00:04:18.370> down<00:04:18.660> or<00:04:19.660> use<00:04:20.109> a<00:04:20.140> hinge<00:04:20.700> like<00:04:21.700> others<00:04:22.000> do

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
board down or use a hinge like others do

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.510 
board down or use a hinge like others do
and<00:04:23.080> you<00:04:23.260> can<00:04:23.380> get<00:04:23.500> some<00:04:23.650> movement<00:04:23.800> out<00:04:24.130> of<00:04:24.190> it

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 
and you can get some movement out of it

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.220 
and you can get some movement out of it
and<00:04:24.729> sometimes<00:04:25.000> I<00:04:25.300> can<00:04:25.450> get<00:04:25.539> aggravating

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:26.230 
and sometimes I can get aggravating

I'll have it there but I might build
different<00:05:19.090> I'd<00:05:19.420> probably<00:05:19.720> put<00:05:20.020> a<00:05:20.050> wing<00:05:20.470> nut

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:20.710

different I'd probably put a wing nut
there<00:05:21.040> and<00:05:21.340> I<00:05:21.670> would<00:05:21.820> consider<00:05:22.150> putting<00:05:22.420> a

wing nut on the wood screw there and
then<00:05:25.900> on<00:05:26.050> the<00:05:26.170> on<00:05:26.470> one<00:05:26.980> side<00:05:27.280> there<00:05:27.670> I<00:05:28.050> would

then on the on one side there I would

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:30.720 
then on the on one side there I would
radius<00:05:29.500> my<00:05:29.680> bar<00:05:29.920> there<00:05:30.190> and<00:05:30.220> have<00:05:30.460> enough
