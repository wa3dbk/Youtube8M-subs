00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.569
 the market and the church - the video galley 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:09.750
 here again from fifa 16 exactly 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.460
 today left the trailer there of the game with 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.530
 various news with various information 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.230
 that I'll bring you here in 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.279
 video as fast as possible guys only 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.510
 I'm waiting because you still have 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.570
 The novelty to leave has several 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.550
 information you are releasing then 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.439
 to sign up for the channel not to lose 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.539
 this video that has a lot of cool stuff 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.550
 and a lot of moisture with explaining right 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.380
 You're 20 and today's fast, people. 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.290
 Why are we going to talk about the rumor? 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.070
 of the game is a camera at first 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.500
 person 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.600
 so come on hold and come with me 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.790
 some years ago on youtube that 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.000
 works there and he did this 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.649
 excerpt from the game by taking the fifa 2012 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.140
 How does he work in there? He had 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.270
 access to various functions within the game 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.640
 so he managed to do a thousand that this 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.739
 mode is a camera style that has 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.960
 there reformulate and play first 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.120
 person to do around this stretch of 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.070
 very cool gameplay that stayed in the video 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.809
 I'll leave it underneath here. 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.530
 link in case you want to see the video is fine 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.229
 old 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.180
 but it is very good it is very well worked and 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.580
 the guy simply messes a lot 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.619
 anyway guys with this stretch 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.630
 we can see more or less with 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.180
 what would be the first person game right? 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.950
 I found every scheme of sensational 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.500
 you get the ball and look down 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.380
 there at the time it is simply unbelievable 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.390
 and the dream of one day be able to play well 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.509
 Of course you would not play online from this 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:33.270
 I do not think so, I think basically 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.890
 specific function for the career mode 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.100
 as a player 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.750
 exactly the one you create your player 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.829
 to put on the boot and your 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.930
 face and etc 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.119
 for this would be a sensational addition 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.759
 for this game that needs something new 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:50.549
 because they do not see anything the last games in the 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.979
 so this would be awesome beyond 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.450
 of the fact that it is also not a time clip 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.460
 events you do not click the button to 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.630
 do the dribble which alia press the 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.850
 to dribble 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.890
 no it's not so this is only one 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.460
 concept created there just to make the 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.560
 video so do not worry 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.690
 is not real guys really che 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.209
 first person will be playing there 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:12.580
 normal doing the drift in normal logic 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:14.950
 but because I'm saying this because 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.050
 I'm playing this matter because in 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.450
 trailer of today we had a 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:22.870
 information a rumor is emerging 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.910
 on social media on fifa 16 ter 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.370
 first person game it all started 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:29.250
 when the pelé speaks exactly like 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:33.000
 put here for you now on the screen 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:35.860
 patriots building in new experience 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.260
 in the passage in question the foot is speaking 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:41.140
 more than the beauty of football if you 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:43.500
 can not experience there in the sequence 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:46.390
 camera zooms in on your eye and 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:49.480
 appears there with her if you are in first 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:51.519
 person behind the aguero several of 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.650
 October and several people started to 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:56.170
 comment on this but I do not know was 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.330
 it can only be a move and a camera is not 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.580
 I know but there are signs of this, right? 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:02.530
 the pelé was exactly that what is the 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:05.350
 football if you can not experience it 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.780
 and zoom in on his eye and there already 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:09.519
 in the next scene appears as if it were 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.190
 a first person camera I do not know 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:14.140
 it is very suspicious it is very suspicious not 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.060
 I know with the little game, but not yet. 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.670
 it's not over, it's not because here 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:21.160
 gilliard lopes brazilian who works 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:23.260
 inside the creation of the game in Canada 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:26.019
 tweeted some things that still leave 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.579
 I suspect this rumor he says that the 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:30.070
 changes in career mode is the thing 

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:32.650
 his favorite is a very 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:34.750
 more dynamic than this mode 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:37.510
 still saying he can not 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:39.040
 Talk about nothing so this is it folks 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.230
 What do you think you're going to have 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.190

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.350
 16 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:46.120
 or is it just a rumor or just the 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:48.700
 people are seeing something where they do not 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.859

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:17.300
 changing as the game goes on 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:20.150
 for example it began there cloudy with 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:22.160
 chance to rain him just at 45 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:24.110
 minutes ahead it starts to rain and 

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:25.820

 game player gameplay 

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:29.229
