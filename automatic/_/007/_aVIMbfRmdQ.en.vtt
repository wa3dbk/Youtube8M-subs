00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:21.340
First infrared camera able to detect
one of the chief causes of acid rain.

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:26.270
What problem does this new device
seek to overcome?

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.250
To detect SO2 and control
leaks and emissions of this gas.

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:37.210
This is an important task, as SO2
is the principal cause of acid rain.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.610
Currently, there is no
commercially available instrument

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.840
that can automatically
detect SO2 leakages.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.120
The company Asturiana de Zinc
brought us this challenge

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.770
and we relayed it
to the researchers

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.010
at the Carlos III
University in Madrid,

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.010
specifically to the
Infrared Laboratory.

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.520
So we set out

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.800
to develop the first camera
for industrial use

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:11.110
that would detect SO2
in the target industries,

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.830
for instance the metal industry,
paper production and the food industry,

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:17.770
which are the largest
emitters of SO2.

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.200
What has been
the principal area of research?

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.180
Our main focus is on
developing infrared cameras

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.810
to detect substances
that are usually

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.810
invisible to the human eye,

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.940
such as certain toxic,
contaminating gases.

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:37.000
The cameras also
generate a picture

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.420
which provides the
end user with information

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.760
they can easily understand.

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.690
What are the system's potential applications?

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:46.460
SO2 has been an extremely
difficult gas to detect

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.960
on account of its
infrared characteristics.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.620
That is why there is no
device currently available

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:54.200
on the market that
can detect this gas.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.310
We have therefore had to
develop hardware specifically

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.310
to address this problem,

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.150
which has proved quite
innovative in this field of research

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:04.700
and has led us to
apply for a patent

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.930
which covers both the
hardware we designed

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.000
and also a comprehensive
detection method.

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:12.660
What is the current status of the project?

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:17.300
When this challenge was taken
to the Infrared Laboratory,

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:21.250
as part of their research work

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:26.570
they applied for a general patent
for remote gas detection.

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:30.790
Sensia have acquired
the patent rights

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.130
and this has enabled us
to develop

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:39.960
the first industrial prototype
that can remotely detect SO2 leakages.

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.730
The prototype has been subjected
to both laboratory and field testing

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.250
under real conditions in industries
that need that patent.

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.350
Specifically, the last test
was performed

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.700
at a metallurgical plant
belonging to Asturiana de Zinc.

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:00.360
The prototype detected leaks
at a distance of more than 10 metres

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.920
at minimal concentrations,

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.540
far lower than the detection limit
expected for a system of this kind.

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.100
What advantages does being in the Science Park 
of the Carlos III University bring?

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.400
Simply by being in the
business incubator of

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.820
the Carlos III University
Science Park

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:22.570
we are able to have day-to-day
contact with the researchers there,

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:27.440
which gives us an edge over
other companies in so far as

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.450
it enables us to tackle
highly complex challenges

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.220
in terms of the technology involved

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.530
that we wouldn't be able to
take on elsewhere.

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:38.860
The Science Park has helped us
manage the patent,

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.070
which covers the detection
and quantification

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:44.720
of a large variety of gases in terms
of both concentration and temperature.

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.940
It is currently available
to any company

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.940
that may be interested in using it.

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:54.040
The Carlos III University
Science Park

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.290
aims to support the companies
in the business incubator,

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.630
including spinoffs and startups.

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:02.910
This process revolves
around the university

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.060
research groups and the
results they produce.

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:09.170
We protect those results to
render them more competitive

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:11.880
and then transfer
them to the businesses

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.220
to help them become
stronger and more innovative.

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.600
But we also operate
another process

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.840
whereby we have ongoing, day-to-day
contact with the businesses

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.790
to identify how they
can become more innovative

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:24.380
and improve their market edge.

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.470
On this basis we supply them
with research results, which they

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:30.420
decide whether to incorporate
into their solutions portfolio.

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:44.230
