type of impressions that I've wanted no
that's<00:06:13.640> probably<00:06:14.000> i'm<00:06:14.150> going<00:06:14.180> to<00:06:14.360> save<00:06:14.510> that

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:14.540 
that's probably i'm going to save that

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:16.270 
that's probably i'm going to save that
for<00:06:14.900> another<00:06:14.930> video<00:06:15.290> i<00:06:15.740> think<00:06:15.980> i'm<00:06:16.100> going<00:06:16.220> to

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:16.280 
for another video i think i'm going to

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:17.560 
for another video i think i'm going to
make<00:06:16.400> a<00:06:16.430> video<00:06:16.580> before<00:06:16.820> all<00:06:17.090> this<00:06:17.240> is<00:06:17.420> done

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:17.570 
make a video before all this is done

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:18.970 
make a video before all this is done
i'll<00:06:17.960> probably<00:06:18.170> gonna<00:06:18.350> make<00:06:18.500> a<00:06:18.530> video<00:06:18.800> to

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:18.980 
i'll probably gonna make a video to

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:21.760 
i'll probably gonna make a video to
catalogue<00:06:19.490> my<00:06:19.670> failures<00:06:20.320> it<00:06:21.320> sounds<00:06:21.710> like

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:21.770 
catalogue my failures it sounds like

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:23.680 
catalogue my failures it sounds like
sounds<00:06:22.220> like<00:06:22.340> a<00:06:22.460> fun<00:06:22.670> one<00:06:22.880> to<00:06:22.910> make<00:06:23.150> doesn't<00:06:23.600> it

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:23.690 
sounds like a fun one to make doesn't it

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:25.330 
sounds like a fun one to make doesn't it
but<00:06:24.020> i<00:06:24.050> probably<00:06:24.290> think<00:06:24.560> i<00:06:24.620> will<00:06:24.800> do<00:06:24.950> that<00:06:25.100> now

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:25.340 
but i probably think i will do that now

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:28.060 
but i probably think i will do that now
if<00:06:26.030> anything<00:06:26.360> just<00:06:26.510> for<00:06:26.870> the<00:06:27.080> sake<00:06:27.290> of<00:06:27.470> getting

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:28.070 
if anything just for the sake of getting

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:31.180 
if anything just for the sake of getting
it<00:06:28.340> out<00:06:28.490> there<00:06:28.730> because<00:06:29.020> japan<00:06:30.020> has<00:06:30.260> largely

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:31.190 
it out there because japan has largely

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:34.990 
it out there because japan has largely
been<00:06:31.340> a<00:06:31.670> failure<00:06:32.120> for<00:06:32.510> me<00:06:32.660> in<00:06:33.230> both<00:06:33.740> life<00:06:34.280> by

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:35.000 
been a failure for me in both life by

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.270 
been a failure for me in both life by
for<00:06:35.210> my<00:06:35.330> first<00:06:35.600> two<00:06:35.840> years<00:06:35.870> in<00:06:36.200> japan<00:06:36.620> you<00:06:37.130> know

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:37.280 
for my first two years in japan you know

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:39.880 
for my first two years in japan you know
20<00:06:37.940> odd<00:06:38.120> years<00:06:38.150> ago<00:06:38.630> and<00:06:38.780> then<00:06:38.900> my<00:06:39.050> current<00:06:39.680> 10

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:39.890 
20 odd years ago and then my current 10

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:41.860 
20 odd years ago and then my current 10
years<00:06:40.100> in<00:06:40.280> japan<00:06:40.580> and<00:06:41.120> i'm<00:06:41.450> not<00:06:41.570> saying<00:06:41.630> that

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:41.870 
years in japan and i'm not saying that

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:44.200 
years in japan and i'm not saying that
to<00:06:41.990> be<00:06:42.080> a<00:06:42.230> you<00:06:42.500> know<00:06:42.650> to<00:06:42.980> be<00:06:43.010> a<00:06:43.220> downer<00:06:43.490> and<00:06:43.940> like

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:44.210 
to be a you know to be a downer and like

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:45.790 
to be a you know to be a downer and like
that<00:06:44.390> is<00:06:44.450> just<00:06:44.510> it<00:06:44.900> just<00:06:45.020> as<00:06:45.230> they<00:06:45.320> say<00:06:45.560> a

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:45.800 
that is just it just as they say a

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:47.920 
that is just it just as they say a
recognition<00:06:46.460> of<00:06:46.760> effect<00:06:47.420> and<00:06:47.630> i<00:06:47.660> think<00:06:47.840> it

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:47.930 
recognition of effect and i think it

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:50.140 
recognition of effect and i think it
would<00:06:48.110> be<00:06:48.230> beneficial<00:06:48.740> to<00:06:49.190> catalog<00:06:49.670> that<00:06:49.910> and

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:50.150 
would be beneficial to catalog that and

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:52.390 
would be beneficial to catalog that and
to<00:06:50.630> get<00:06:51.230> that<00:06:51.350> out<00:06:51.590> as<00:06:51.800> well<00:06:51.950> but<00:06:52.130> i'll<00:06:52.250> save

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:52.400 
to get that out as well but i'll save

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:53.560 
to get that out as well but i'll save
that<00:06:52.460> for<00:06:52.700> another<00:06:52.730> video<00:06:53.030> i'm<00:06:53.210> going<00:06:53.330> to<00:06:53.390> stop

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:53.570 
that for another video i'm going to stop

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:54.970 
that for another video i'm going to stop
for<00:06:53.600> now<00:06:53.900> we'll<00:06:54.080> have<00:06:54.110> a<00:06:54.260> failure<00:06:54.650> video

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:54.980 
for now we'll have a failure video

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:57.370 
for now we'll have a failure video
