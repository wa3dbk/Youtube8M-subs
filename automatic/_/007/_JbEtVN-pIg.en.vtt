00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.580
 simone from the outside that looked like it 

00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:14.700
 has a great impression 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:17.100
 I don't know if you then think of relationships and 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.350
 of the value words produced or 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:24.060
 observations from superheroes 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:28.099
 here is not a taboo for me a beauty 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:30.660
 show also companies then excuse me if 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:34.559
 I don't have but I'm in the state of that 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:44.010
 that may be your ideas or 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:44.550
 in question is different than his 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.809
 right 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:50.190
 thank you will like today if you said that 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.559
 the game was starting the summer 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:57.120
 arrives today we faced a big one 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:01:01.260
 what team can scold the kids 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:04.730
 today today little I think we are 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.730
 demoted today mathematically 

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:10.570
 are another case we have thrown 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:14.420
 Bestsellers 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:18.460
 our brought that we already had in 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.460
 pocket so strong 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:28.250
 so said at the end when it 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.250
 locker room thing 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.820
 they succeed in words sincerely 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:44.590
 so there is a very sad day 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:49.689
 sad above all here is everything for everyone 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:51.219
 the former is spent on the dead fans for 

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:55.409
 I'm sorry I'm sorry 

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:58.990
 tremendously because the parity of 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:02.759
 being able to save this team but us 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.759
 we are the figures so we like it 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.310
 I really like football 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.259
 explained why the scene we have 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.060
 assisted off the final whistle with 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.870
 the whole team that went under 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.270
 curve 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.100
 imagine what can be there in the 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:20.570
 curve football is really cruel 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:23.670
 because in other sports rugby volleyball 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:26.580
 and basketball diati sport show near 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.980
 in Italy there are no astrons like that 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.800
 that's when you whether 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.210
 precisely that the team anyway 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.100
 unpublished page condemnation of fans but 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:37.230
 when you attend these scenes like that 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.180
 where almost it seems that the fan wants 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.980
 discharge all the anger of his life 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.630
 personal then the problems he wants in 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.700
 family at work all the 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.470
 his post that maybe comes to me 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.810
 we are other troubles in personal life 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.000
 then he almost wants to pour the 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:54.630
 footballer who has not transformed 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.170
 according to his way of seeing his anger 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:03:00.600
 in the line performance in the field here 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:02.130
 can give a know that is something that 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:05.480
 maybe out of the present moment 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:07.980
 but an evaluation of this type of 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.700
 scene that unfortunately often occurs 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.700
 in the world of football 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:19.470
 I have not interpreted how they are not 500 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:23.160
 400 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:26.040
 in short, over 100 animals came to 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.390
 download the social problems we have 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.360
 they didn't set me up 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:33.150
 we are relegated today to a country that is 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:36.480
 that nobody can make leaps of 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:40.380
 joy as we are sorry as they are 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.760
 sorry i am also more of them 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:49.790
 we 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:49.790
 probable for which they manifested 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:57.530
 but he wants it for relegation 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:04:02.620
 in this we can be a paradise 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:02.620
 the driver and sportingly speaking 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.819
 you have had a husband with whom you 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:12.040
 rekindles hopes some point and then 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:13.930
 defeats have arrived in series you have 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.079
 made an idea of ​​why the team but 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:19.120
 certain point it collapsed maybe 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:26.790
 physically and mentally that happened 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:26.790
 like you this team has shown 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:34.599
 several times to have even the neighbor 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:37.560
 in fact we managed to make the 

00:04:34.599 --> 00:04:37.560
 wire editors ever 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:47.030
 which we managed to do 4 5 6 games 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:50.680
 the useless results but now we are 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:50.680
 in short, the two victories in a row 

00:04:51.399 --> 00:04:56.119
 and this is the continuity that exists 

00:04:54.319 --> 00:05:02.479
 failure that brought us down where I live 

00:04:56.119 --> 00:05:04.529
 here then this is a person 

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:08.519
 rather humble 

00:05:04.529 --> 00:05:12.749
 and think from the mistakes from the bathrooms from 

00:05:08.519 --> 00:05:17.219
 blows can and must be grown 

00:05:12.749 --> 00:05:26.369
 one on my part there will be a reflection 

00:05:17.219 --> 00:05:27.809
 at 360 degrees and look for these limits 

00:05:26.369 --> 00:05:29.549
 of those you talk you expected that 

00:05:27.809 --> 00:05:33.209
 they were so big when accepted 

00:05:29.549 --> 00:05:35.639
 to come to padua and then it was precisely 

00:05:33.209 --> 00:05:39.059
 talk about reflections what does yes mean 

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:42.379
 means that you might want to 

00:05:39.059 --> 00:05:46.379
 report the case of my personal 

00:05:42.379 --> 00:05:49.289
 that each of us simply does it yes 

00:05:46.379 --> 00:05:52.259
 stop for a moment and in the groove that 

00:05:49.289 --> 00:05:55.879
 that is the responsibility 

00:05:52.259 --> 00:05:55.879
 I do not shirk my responsibilities 

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:06.670
 naturally personal before that 

00:06:05.059 --> 00:06:08.680
 we become 

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:15.190
 in this respect this team here for 

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:17.550
 which I counted and I was hoping to resolve 

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:17.550
 it's good 

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:39.790
 what was your time in a 

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:44.950
 turn negative but I care I have it 

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:46.720
 also called a time 23 games does that 

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:50.890
 it was probably the home game 

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:54.100
 with bari where in case of victory there 

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:56.350
 we will be very close to the two 

00:06:54.100 --> 00:07:02.860
 in front of us we went to 1 and 2 

00:06:56.350 --> 00:07:06.840
 points from dal to the caravan varesine for 

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:06.840
 which I had lost instead 

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:14.290
 that one the topical game then there are 

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:17.050
 there have been many other games where we have 

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:18.730
 thrown to the wind of points while the 

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:23.320
 home caesena 

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:24.340
 at 90 the 92nd we were easy topics 

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:29.580
 force we took goals on one 

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:32.970
 restart that goal unfortunately us 

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:35.840
 marked marked castle at sea in the middle 

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:38.759
 centimeter of the way of the door for which 

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:43.370
 but I think that then on the atomic it can 

00:07:38.759 --> 00:07:43.370
 to have been at home with the bari 

00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:53.940
 all right thanks thanks
