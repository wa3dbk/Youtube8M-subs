00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:04.020
 do you want fifa coins quickly and reliably 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:07.140
 buy a positive point point nl 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.610
 used code fcf for 5% discount 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.469
 and you have the coins within a minute 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.840
 your account to you welcome guests 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.059
 on episode 10 of millions of the 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.130
 reports once had from 10 episodes 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.779
 and that a milestone of 10 episodes 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.060
 I have had something special to do 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.380
 I'm going to put everything in the suitcase today 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.060
 find all amounts double 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.590
 so-called euro that is not the intention 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.539
 from the series but yes I didn't either 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.880
 expect a team that I meet 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.679
 start of fifa for a new course can 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.450
 Now buy 10 million worth king 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.160
 because really where every players like 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.899
 mountain buddy was first 500k that now almost 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.760
 one million same applies to lexence 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.350
 I could only buy them all first 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.820
 now all of those looks have become expensive 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.570
 I couldn't have had that inflation 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.010
 to predict 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.570
 maybe it should have been one 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.070
 economic education but good that 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.960
 market that makes no sense at all 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.860
 are going to open three envelopes that you there 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.410
 still chose 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.370
 namely expiration 15 expiration 12 and vlog 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.590
 number 18 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.750
 envelope number 15 contains an amount of 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.270
 gave dct1000 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.149
 are really being doubled 2000 grab you 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:06.659
 hand flop number 18 is in one 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:08.820
 amount of 50,000 coins that will be 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.619
 100,000 and then number 12 believes that would 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.250
 Of course fucking a thousand near you again 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.020
 to be 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.430
 hey yeah how could it be otherwise we 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.689
 double all the amounts once 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.070
 we get and then get the two 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.619
 seems to amount to 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.430
 well i'm going to mark 104000 coins 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.560
 to turn on 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.290
 we still had around 80,000 left 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.540
 bringing the menu to 184,000 coins 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.670
 as you see now have 180,000 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.460
 coins te is what diet text j tax 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.430
 but I really have none 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.689
 idea how to improve it 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.799
 and I'm going to ask you the 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.390
 next episode of course I have 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.650
 still have access to these coins 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.750
 we will make no light covers 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.970
 but we can buy players 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.250
 how would you share my team in you can the 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.780
 players who are there are listed here 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.149
 Team app I have in my bank 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.829
 sit that further still have in the previous 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.530
 episodes when I have purchased them 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:57.570
 if you could sell it i think we would 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.509
 then around 300,000 coins 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.200
 what kind of a team would I do then 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.939
 to make 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.840
 leave a comment send a team 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:08.459
 on twitter you name it and say something 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.959
 of team i have to build then that builds the 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.060
 next episode the one that is best 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.650
 is chosen but for now I have work 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.450
 I cannot inspire this team 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.450
 we must also sit in that now 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.400
 Vision 6 for the first time are still 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.000
 unbeaten we have had a slow one 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:28.379
 when it was undeserved but good for that 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:31.920
 1080 reason 9610 spirit bundesliga like 

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:36.810
 seria team well am curious 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:39.090
 ar no snow this all good 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.410
 snow that is so pussy to play on 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.690
 snow is really hard to estimate 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.700
 namely how that ball will roll plus me 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.750
 see that bubbly yes you know for real 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.160
 get an orange ball 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.660
 why wouldn't you do it there 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.470
 active if they want it to be so realistic 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.470
 enable 

00:02:55.099 --> 00:03:00.150
 how do i give a board how do i give a 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:03.000
 penalty away I do not control that player 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.680
 seriously looking back but i go to him 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.200
 stops again, maybe he is 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.209
 pitch the pray and he is the panenka 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.489
 it to him if your chest was right I 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:13.140
 him still had no stress um i think 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:14.250
 the job is because that penalty is just 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.519
 made no sense 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:19.860
 free span or bed heavy pads but now then 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:21.659
 under the keeper by nrc 301 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.950
 it's so hard to see that photo 

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:25.709
 can imagine that you also m 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.989
 you look after this course but 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:30.269
 luckily part 1 were in the 20th minute 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:32.420
 who other than our own k those people 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:32.420
 but 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:38.540
 lucas 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:40.220
 on german where dad's we wish only 0 2 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.849
 make wishes as ridiculously good 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.459
 headlines 

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:44.930
 0 2 34th minute would be best if the 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:46.040
 opponent of course already put so that 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:48.110
 we can go quickly at the gate 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.180
 but I don't think that chance 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:51.200
 today is what makes you feel good again 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:54.080
 double 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:56.980
 We wish BB cream and we just got it 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:56.980
 not his head against it 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:00.799
 apparently it is because it is none 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:02.060
 corner and the referee whistles 

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:03.709
 this is the so here we probably 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:05.269
 not seen many clips on those goals 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:06.769
 after comes because that ball is just ridiculous 

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:09.920
 hard to see 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:11.930
 he has had 0 scrap farmer or 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:13.280
 apparently a blue dot 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:14.569
 has to see four shots two 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:17.000
 goals 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:19.700
 this will just be an easy win 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.979
 her lucas lucas with the unnecessary skills 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:23.360
 0 3 is getting close 

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:25.010
 that's why i say about those clothes as 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.470
 I score coro 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:30.530
 does not oh you poor young is gone no 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:34.900
 arms and my opponent scores it and 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:34.900
 bodha bodha has the series 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:39.470
 book I still sit there, by 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:40.130
 cupboard and then "" said but also meaning 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:42.169
 in 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:43.430
 glenn swimming is also in the mood 

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:46.400
 gamelin trempe 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:48.020
 we go a 2-pack yes then you go trempe 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.030
 matuidi has the series 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:52.130
 because who has the also only two series 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:54.320
 who do participate and matuidi 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:57.020
 is table going and fluid goes well 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:59.240
 sitting there did have to sit flourishes 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:02.300
 so you also sit there karim karim 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:09.229
 didi weeks seen 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:12.220
 oh that keeper saves him looking over again 

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:12.220
 get the corner by one 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:17.990
 now that not exactly but keeley that 

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:19.150
 agree s yes it is already that far 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:21.500
 competition had not yet won 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:22.970
 Martini certainly makes sure 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:24.409
 worked at home care not before 

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:25.580
 we already won it, he said 

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:27.979
 ensures that we have five goals 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:29.629
 difference won a seth 

00:05:27.979 --> 00:05:31.340
 goal second on the van den sima goal 

00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:32.810
 van lucas scores the pupa goal of 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:33.650
 matuidi and the last goal funky 

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:36.080
 line 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:37.729
 easy points i had that vision 6 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:41.030
 frankly harder I expect 

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:42.860
 mean he had two major roles at 13 

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:45.530
 great we have difficult opponents 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:47.569
 had in that vision 8 and division 9 but 

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:49.550
 I think it's beautiful 

00:05:47.569 --> 00:05:51.530
 quickly to the second game and then 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:53.599
 naturally you also choose to choose 

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:55.729
 second jar well as you see it takes 

00:05:53.599 --> 00:05:57.949
 delivery now about 5 minutes it 

00:05:55.729 --> 00:06:00.139
 second jar is so epic jar 

00:05:57.949 --> 00:06:04.280
 that I did not do that within a time frame 

00:06:00.139 --> 00:06:06.469
 so can edit from 5 to 6 minutes 

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:08.330
 that means if i bells that too 

00:06:06.469 --> 00:06:10.490
 make this video about 12 minutes 

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:12.500
 they become and that is too long for the 

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:14.270
 video very many people watch five 

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:15.469
 minutes away plus I think the video 

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:16.849
 not good on ending up I have one 

00:06:15.469 --> 00:06:19.130
 very many people like twitter and 

00:06:16.849 --> 00:06:21.080
 subscribers of okay what they do a video 

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:23.389
 12 minutes or two for five minutes 

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:25.099
 who just then might want to expose that 

00:06:23.389 --> 00:06:26.719
 two hidden then delight he is the 

00:06:25.099 --> 00:06:29.180
 leader of ok you just know 

00:06:26.719 --> 00:06:31.909
 two parts what that is still more convenient 

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:33.830
 hence this outro cruel who not too 

00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:35.960
 Liking as follows liked was free again 

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:38.680
 coincidence you ask and i tankian the later 

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:38.680
 would have had
