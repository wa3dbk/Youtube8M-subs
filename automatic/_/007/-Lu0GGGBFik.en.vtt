I'm<00:02:18.650> going<00:02:19.040> here<00:02:19.280> tied<00:02:19.610> everything<00:02:19.849> up<00:02:21.130> and

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
I'm going here tied everything up and

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.920 
I'm going here tied everything up and
run<00:02:22.400> through<00:02:22.519> their<00:02:22.670> patterns<00:02:25.599> and<00:02:26.599> give<00:02:26.840> you

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
run through their patterns and give you

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.259 
run through their patterns and give you
an<00:02:27.019> idea<00:02:27.110> of<00:02:27.410> the<00:02:27.620> rear<00:02:28.610> tail<00:02:28.880> lights<00:02:29.120> will

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:29.269 
an idea of the rear tail lights will

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:30.970 
an idea of the rear tail lights will
turn<00:02:29.299> those<00:02:29.630> on<00:02:29.750> with<00:02:29.989> a<00:02:30.019> stroke<00:02:30.380> and<00:02:30.709> you<00:02:30.890> can

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
turn those on with a stroke and you can

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.550 
turn those on with a stroke and you can
still<00:02:31.190> see<00:02:31.400> the<00:02:31.989> strobe<00:02:32.989> lights<00:02:33.260> through

still see the strobe lights through

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.180 
still see the strobe lights through
those<00:02:35.200> turned<00:02:36.200> out<00:02:36.319> pretty<00:02:36.410> good<00:02:36.620> I<00:02:36.680> think<00:02:36.829> I

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
those turned out pretty good I think I
