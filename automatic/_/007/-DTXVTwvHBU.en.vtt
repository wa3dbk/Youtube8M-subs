00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.969 
first match I don't know if those would
be<00:01:21.450> necessarily<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.259> match<00:01:22.409> to<00:01:22.590> kick<00:01:22.770> things

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
be necessarily the match to kick things

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.289 
be necessarily the match to kick things
off<00:01:23.189> but<00:01:23.430> it<00:01:23.520> probably<00:01:23.729> would<00:01:24.000> be<00:01:24.030> a<00:01:24.150> good

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
off but it probably would be a good

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.020 
off but it probably would be a good

Championship and I think this match

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.569 
Championship and I think this match
would<00:01:45.090> be<00:01:45.299> a<00:01:45.329> hell<00:01:45.780> of<00:01:45.810> a<00:01:46.020> way<00:01:46.170> to<00:01:46.380> get<00:01:46.920> this<00:01:47.130> get

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
would be a hell of a way to get this get

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.760 
would be a hell of a way to get this get
the<00:01:47.700> crowd<00:01:47.939> roaring<00:01:48.390> get<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:49.020> crowd<00:01:49.320> on<00:01:49.350> their

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
the crowd roaring get the crowd on their

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.469 
the crowd roaring get the crowd on their
feet<00:01:49.829> and<00:01:50.250> anticipate<00:01:50.759> anything<00:01:50.970> and<00:01:51.240> I<00:01:51.299> think

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
feet and anticipate anything and I think

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.020 
feet and anticipate anything and I think
in<00:01:51.570> this<00:01:51.659> match<00:01:51.930> we<00:01:52.500> should<00:01:52.710> have<00:01:52.890> a

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
in this match we should have a

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.209 
in this match we should have a
championship<00:01:54.030> on<00:01:54.570> defense<00:01:55.530> where<00:01:55.799> we<00:01:55.979> see<00:01:56.189> a

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
know cuz things were getting a little

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:02.900 
know cuz things were getting a little
bit<00:03:01.710> interesting<00:03:02.220> but<00:03:02.340> everything<00:03:02.670> every

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
bit interesting but everything every

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.400 
bit interesting but everything every
time<00:03:03.120> it<00:03:03.240> seemed<00:03:03.390> like<00:03:03.540> the<00:03:03.660> ww<00:03:04.140> is<00:03:04.200> going<00:03:04.320> to

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
time it seemed like the ww is going to

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.620 
time it seemed like the ww is going to
go<00:03:04.470> with<00:03:04.620> Rousseff<00:03:05.100> vs<00:03:05.700> ride<00:03:05.940> back<00:03:06.180> they<00:03:06.480> would

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
go with Rousseff vs ride back they would

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.230 
go with Rousseff vs ride back they would
just<00:03:06.660> knock<00:03:07.560> it<00:03:07.740> off<00:03:07.830> the<00:03:07.980> radar<00:03:08.340> act<00:03:08.730> like<00:03:09.120> it

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:09.240 
just knock it off the radar act like it
