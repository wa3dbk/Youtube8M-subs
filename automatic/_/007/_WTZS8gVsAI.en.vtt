on your glove it can grab the pavement
pull<00:03:29.069> the<00:03:29.250> glove<00:03:29.459> apart<00:03:29.849> and<00:03:30.060> that's<00:03:30.239> no<00:03:30.479> fun

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
pull the glove apart and that's no fun

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.499 
pull the glove apart and that's no fun
it<00:03:31.620> can<00:03:31.859> transmit<00:03:32.489> a<00:03:32.639> bunch<00:03:32.849> of<00:03:32.970> energy<00:03:33.359> when

it grabbed into your wrist your elbow
your<00:03:36.000> shoulder<00:03:36.479> create<00:03:36.810> an<00:03:36.900> injury<00:03:37.139> also<00:03:37.919> not

00:03:38.119 --> 00:03:38.129 
your shoulder create an injury also not

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:40.759 
your shoulder create an injury also not
good<00:03:38.400> or<00:03:38.699> it<00:03:39.569> can<00:03:39.840> initiate<00:03:40.079> a<00:03:40.290> tumble

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
good or it can initiate a tumble

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:42.949 
good or it can initiate a tumble
tumbling<00:03:41.340> hurts<00:03:41.609> sliding<00:03:42.090> not<00:03:42.239> so<00:03:42.449> much<00:03:42.629> you

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
tumbling hurts sliding not so much you

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:44.869 
tumbling hurts sliding not so much you
have<00:03:43.109> the<00:03:43.229> plastic<00:03:43.439> there<00:03:43.859> to<00:03:44.340> put<00:03:44.549> your<00:03:44.699> hands

00:03:44.869 --> 00:03:44.879 
have the plastic there to put your hands

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:48.020 
have the plastic there to put your hands
out<00:03:45.090> it<00:03:45.299> slides<00:03:45.750> a<00:03:46.049> lot<00:03:46.379> easier<00:03:46.919> it<00:03:47.430> reduces

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
out it slides a lot easier it reduces

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:49.999 
out it slides a lot easier it reduces
the<00:03:48.180> chances<00:03:48.689> of<00:03:48.750> it<00:03:48.989> grabbing<00:03:49.500> and<00:03:49.650> it

00:03:49.999 --> 00:03:50.009 
the chances of it grabbing and it

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:51.860 
the chances of it grabbing and it
reduces<00:03:50.549> the<00:03:50.609> chance<00:03:51.000> of<00:03:51.209> all<00:03:51.389> the<00:03:51.540> other<00:03:51.659> bad

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
reduces the chance of all the other bad

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.749 
reduces the chance of all the other bad
stuff<00:03:51.900> I<00:03:52.290> just<00:03:52.500> talked<00:03:52.769> about<00:03:53.069> from<00:03:53.310> happening

00:03:53.749 --> 00:03:53.759 
stuff I just talked about from happening
