look<00:00:56.460> at<00:00:56.610> all<00:00:56.760> this<00:00:56.910> around<00:00:57.180> here<00:00:57.480> look<00:00:58.260> at<00:00:58.410> all

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
look at all this around here look at all

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.849 
look at all this around here look at all
those<00:00:59.010> different<00:00:59.250> VRMs<00:00:59.789> this<00:01:00.120> is<00:01:00.329> a<00:01:00.859> basically

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
those different VRMs this is a basically

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.210 
those different VRMs this is a basically
it's<00:01:02.219> a<00:01:02.489> 32<00:01:03.390> plus<00:01:03.960> three<00:01:04.439> phase<00:01:04.680> power<00:01:04.769> so<00:01:05.100> it's

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
it's a 32 plus three phase power so it's

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.219 
it's a 32 plus three phase power so it's
32<00:01:05.549> phases<00:01:05.939> for<00:01:06.090> V<00:01:06.270> Corps<00:01:06.540> and<00:01:06.720> then<00:01:07.049> these

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
32 phases for V Corps and then these

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.170 
32 phases for V Corps and then these
three<00:01:07.470> over<00:01:07.710> here<00:01:07.950> for<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.220> memory<00:01:08.610> so<00:01:08.880> very

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
these are all basically programs or let

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.880 
these are all basically programs or let

performance but they're basically give

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.130 
performance but they're basically give
you<00:01:44.610> an<00:01:44.790> increase<00:01:45.450> in<00:01:45.479> performance<00:01:45.720> of<00:01:46.020> your

you an increase in performance of your

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.039 
you an increase in performance of your

megahert<00:01:56.280> with<00:01:56.399> overclocking<00:01:56.939> so<00:01:57.869> that's

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
megahert with overclocking so that's

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.959 
megahert with overclocking so that's
also<00:01:58.380> really<00:01:58.500> cool<00:01:58.799> now<00:01:59.009> take<00:01:59.369> a<00:01:59.399> look<00:01:59.520> down

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
also really cool now take a look down

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.899 
also really cool now take a look down
here<00:02:00.000> I<00:02:00.270> want<00:02:00.420> to<00:02:00.450> show<00:02:00.509> you<00:02:00.740> the<00:02:01.909> interfaces

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
here I want to show you the interfaces

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.490 
here I want to show you the interfaces
for<00:02:02.939> the<00:02:03.210> graphics<00:02:03.659> now<00:02:03.810> here's<00:02:04.229> how<00:02:04.320> it<00:02:04.409> works

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
for the graphics now here's how it works

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.639 
for the graphics now here's how it works
you<00:02:04.680> have<00:02:04.799> two<00:02:05.460> pci<00:02:05.820> express<00:02:06.000> x16<00:02:06.390> 2.0<00:02:06.840> slots

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
you have two pci express x16 2.0 slots

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.710 
you have two pci express x16 2.0 slots
so<00:02:08.459> here's<00:02:08.729> one<00:02:08.910> here's<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.300> other<00:02:09.420> one<00:02:09.539> if

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
so here's one here's the other one if

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.050 
so here's one here's the other one if
you<00:02:09.810> do<00:02:10.020> one<00:02:10.289> its<00:02:10.440> x16<00:02:11.009> if<00:02:11.640> you<00:02:11.760> do<00:02:11.849> too<00:02:12.030> it

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
you do one its x16 if you do too it

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.420 
you do one its x16 if you do too it
bifurcates<00:02:12.300> down<00:02:12.810> to<00:02:12.930> x

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
bifurcates down to x

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.699 
bifurcates down to x
x8<00:02:13.939> which<00:02:14.390> means<00:02:14.599> you<00:02:14.689> can<00:02:14.840> do<00:02:14.989> crossfire<00:02:15.439> and

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
x8 which means you can do crossfire and

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:18.759 
x8 which means you can do crossfire and
or<00:02:16.040> sli<00:02:16.609> no<00:02:16.879> problem<00:02:17.269> on<00:02:17.390> this<00:02:17.540> card<00:02:17.810> it<00:02:18.379> is<00:02:18.560> two

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:18.769 
or sli no problem on this card it is two

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:19.990 
or sli no problem on this card it is two
point<00:02:19.010> oh<00:02:19.159> so<00:02:19.340> you're<00:02:19.459> not<00:02:19.489> going<00:02:19.670> to<00:02:19.760> lose<00:02:19.849> any

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
point oh so you're not going to lose any

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.209 
point oh so you're not going to lose any
bandwidth<00:02:20.480> by<00:02:20.739> putting<00:02:21.739> both<00:02:21.920> of<00:02:22.040> them<00:02:22.159> and

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:22.219 
bandwidth by putting both of them and

00:02:22.219 --> 00:02:23.589 
bandwidth by putting both of them and
running<00:02:22.459> them<00:02:22.579> in<00:02:22.670> x8<00:02:23.150> you're<00:02:23.299> still<00:02:23.480> getting

00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:23.599 
running them in x8 you're still getting

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:25.300 
running them in x8 you're still getting
basically<00:02:24.109> the<00:02:24.230> full<00:02:24.469> amount<00:02:24.680> of<00:02:24.799> performance

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
basically the full amount of performance

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.130 
basically the full amount of performance
even<00:02:25.730> though<00:02:25.969> the<00:02:26.150> bandwidth<00:02:26.629> has<00:02:26.750> dropped<00:02:27.049> a

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
even though the bandwidth has dropped a

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.770 
even though the bandwidth has dropped a
little<00:02:27.319> bit<00:02:28.090> also<00:02:29.090> you<00:02:29.209> have<00:02:29.329> two<00:02:29.450> standard

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
little bit also you have two standard

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.220 
little bit also you have two standard
PCI<00:02:30.049> slots<00:02:30.469> and<00:02:30.650> then<00:02:30.769> you<00:02:30.859> have<00:02:31.120> three<00:02:32.120> pc<00:02:33.109> I'm

are good for sound cards or TV tuners or

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:41.289 
are good for sound cards or TV tuners or
what<00:02:39.829> not<00:02:39.980> same<00:02:40.639> thing<00:02:40.790> with<00:02:40.879> these<00:02:41.030> you<00:02:41.180> can

00:02:41.289 --> 00:02:41.299 
what not same thing with these you can

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:42.849 
what not same thing with these you can
add<00:02:41.420> just<00:02:41.599> a<00:02:41.689> bunch<00:02:42.200> of<00:02:42.319> good<00:02:42.500> stuff<00:02:42.530> with

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:42.859 
add just a bunch of good stuff with

00:02:42.859 --> 00:02:44.559 
add just a bunch of good stuff with
these<00:02:42.950> expansion<00:02:43.370> cards<00:02:43.579> but<00:02:43.730> the<00:02:44.359> graphics

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:44.569 
these expansion cards but the graphics

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:46.059 
these expansion cards but the graphics
is<00:02:44.900> the<00:02:44.989> most<00:02:45.170> important<00:02:45.680> part<00:02:45.709> and<00:02:46.010> you're

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:46.069 
is the most important part and you're

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:47.860 
is the most important part and you're
probably<00:02:46.220> news<00:02:46.549> one<00:02:46.760> maybe<00:02:47.299> two<00:02:47.389> graphics

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
probably news one maybe two graphics

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.129 
probably news one maybe two graphics
cards<00:02:48.109> on<00:02:48.230> here<00:02:48.500> so<00:02:49.159> very<00:02:49.400> very<00:02:49.519> nice<00:02:49.639> also

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:50.139 
cards on here so very very nice also

00:02:50.139 --> 00:02:51.970 
cards on here so very very nice also
important<00:02:51.139> to<00:02:51.200> know<00:02:51.290> if<00:02:51.379> you<00:02:51.439> look<00:02:51.530> over<00:02:51.680> here

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
important to know if you look over here

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.280 
important to know if you look over here
these<00:02:52.700> are<00:02:52.760> your<00:02:53.000> SATA<00:02:53.239> ports<00:02:53.629> now<00:02:53.870> there's

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
these are your SATA ports now there's

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.679 
these are your SATA ports now there's
four<00:02:54.859> here<00:02:55.280> there's<00:02:55.669> two<00:02:55.939> down<00:02:56.120> here<00:02:56.419> and<00:02:56.599> then

00:02:56.679 --> 00:02:56.689 
four here there's two down here and then

00:02:56.689 --> 00:02:59.020 
four here there's two down here and then
there's<00:02:56.840> these<00:02:57.109> two<00:02:57.169> so<00:02:57.590> the<00:02:57.739> blue<00:02:57.950> ones<00:02:58.159> go<00:02:58.969> to

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
there's these two so the blue ones go to

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:00.699 
there's these two so the blue ones go to
the<00:02:59.209> p55<00:02:59.569> chipset<00:02:59.689> which<00:03:00.200> is<00:03:00.260> underneath<00:03:00.469> this

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
the p55 chipset which is underneath this

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:04.509 
the p55 chipset which is underneath this
cover<00:03:00.980> and<00:03:01.669> those<00:03:01.909> are<00:03:02.239> the<00:03:02.709> sata<00:03:03.709> 3<00:03:04.010> gigabit

00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:04.519 
cover and those are the sata 3 gigabit

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:06.640 
cover and those are the sata 3 gigabit
per<00:03:04.609> second<00:03:04.969> raid<00:03:05.239> 0<00:03:05.480> red<00:03:05.719> one<00:03:05.930> raid<00:03:06.139> 5<00:03:06.349> and<00:03:06.560> r<00:03:06.590> 8

per second raid 0 red one raid 5 and r 8

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.520 
per second raid 0 red one raid 5 and r 8
10<00:03:06.980> this<00:03:07.819> right<00:03:08.060> here<00:03:08.269> is<00:03:08.299> the<00:03:08.419> raid<00:03:08.810> 6<00:03:09.169> gigabit

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:11.830 
10 this right here is the raid 6 gigabit
per<00:03:09.650> second<00:03:10.010> so<00:03:10.099> this<00:03:10.250> is<00:03:10.370> the<00:03:10.459> faster<00:03:10.969> version

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
per second so this is the faster version

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.170 
per second so this is the faster version
these<00:03:12.650> are<00:03:12.829> twice<00:03:13.280> as<00:03:13.310> fast<00:03:13.609> aside<00:03:13.969> through

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
these are twice as fast aside through

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:15.339 
these are twice as fast aside through
your<00:03:14.359> per<00:03:14.510> second<00:03:14.870> there's<00:03:15.019> two<00:03:15.169> of<00:03:15.290> those

00:03:15.339 --> 00:03:15.349 
your per second there's two of those

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:18.430 
your per second there's two of those
they<00:03:15.530> can<00:03:15.680> do<00:03:15.769> raid<00:03:15.950> 0<00:03:16.189> plus<00:03:17.180> raid<00:03:17.569> 1<00:03:17.900> very<00:03:18.260> very

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
they can do raid 0 plus raid 1 very very

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:15.169 
very cool basically you can just set up

00:04:15.169 --> 00:04:17.439 
very cool basically you can just set up
profiles<00:04:15.409> and<00:04:16.039> overclock<00:04:16.579> on<00:04:16.759> the<00:04:16.940> fly<00:04:17.150> while

00:04:17.439 --> 00:04:17.449 
profiles and overclock on the fly while

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:18.520 
profiles and overclock on the fly while
the<00:04:17.599> computer<00:04:17.750> is<00:04:17.959> running<00:04:18.079> you<00:04:18.289> could<00:04:18.380> even

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:18.530 
the computer is running you could even

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:21.279 
the computer is running you could even
be<00:04:18.650> playing<00:04:18.979> a<00:04:19.159> game<00:04:19.459> or<00:04:20.269> loading<00:04:20.659> a<00:04:20.750> benchmark

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:21.289 
be playing a game or loading a benchmark

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:23.260

and basically just turn the system on
you<00:04:23.419> can<00:04:23.539> activate<00:04:23.960> EP<00:04:24.349> you<00:04:24.529> or<00:04:25.279> you<00:04:25.400> can<00:04:25.490> turn

00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:25.639 
you can activate EP you or you can turn

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:26.620 
you can activate EP you or you can turn
it<00:04:25.789> off<00:04:25.880> and<00:04:26.029> put<00:04:26.120> it<00:04:26.150> in<00:04:26.270> manual

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
it off and put it in manual

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:27.940 
it off and put it in manual
mode<00:04:26.750> and<00:04:26.990> then<00:04:27.050> basically<00:04:27.260> just<00:04:27.590> increased

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:27.950 
mode and then basically just increased

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:30.700 
mode and then basically just increased
bus<00:04:28.220> speed<00:04:28.990> automatically<00:04:29.990> from<00:04:30.110> outside<00:04:30.590> the
