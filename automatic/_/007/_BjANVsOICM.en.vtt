00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
are just kind of derpy looking in my

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:51.630 
are just kind of derpy looking in my
opinion<00:02:51.010> I<00:02:51.130> don't<00:02:51.190> think<00:02:51.340> they<00:02:51.610> actually

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
opinion I don't think they actually

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.180 
opinion I don't think they actually
perform<00:02:52.420> like<00:02:52.600> real<00:02:52.810> squids<00:02:53.170> I<00:02:53.380> think<00:02:54.130> these

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
perform like real squids I think these

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.490 
perform like real squids I think these
guys<00:02:54.400> are<00:02:54.610> a<00:02:54.640> little<00:02:54.790> bit<00:02:54.970> more<00:02:55.020> squid<00:02:56.020> like<00:02:56.290> I

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
guys are a little bit more squid like I

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.800

stuff<00:03:54.910> is<00:03:55.060> but<00:03:55.390> you<00:03:56.170> guys<00:03:56.290> do<00:03:56.500> get<00:03:56.650> 15<00:03:56.950> seconds

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
stuff is but you guys do get 15 seconds

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:00.210 
stuff is but you guys do get 15 seconds
of<00:03:57.340> blindness<00:03:57.730> when<00:03:57.910> they<00:03:58.030> hit<00:03:58.239> you<00:03:58.450> and<00:03:59.220> let's

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220 
of blindness when they hit you and let's

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:01.350 
of blindness when they hit you and let's
see<00:04:00.310> if<00:04:00.340> we<00:04:00.430> can<00:04:00.580> find<00:04:00.790> them<00:04:00.880> here<00:04:00.910> all<00:04:01.209> right

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:01.360 
see if we can find them here all right

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.120 
see if we can find them here all right
so<00:04:01.420> it<00:04:01.660> kind<00:04:01.870> of<00:04:01.900> looks<00:04:02.080> like<00:04:02.290> water<00:04:02.560> particles

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:03.130 
so it kind of looks like water particles

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:05.039 
so it kind of looks like water particles
but<00:04:03.730> I<00:04:03.940> don't<00:04:04.120> think<00:04:04.299> that's<00:04:04.450> what<00:04:04.630> it<00:04:04.720> is

00:04:05.039 --> 00:04:05.049 
but I don't think that's what it is

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:06.750 
but I don't think that's what it is
