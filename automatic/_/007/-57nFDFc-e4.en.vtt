00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
gradually add in our flour which I have

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.840 
gradually add in our flour which I have
already<00:01:25.049> mixed<00:01:25.680> and<00:01:25.830> sifted<00:01:26.220> together<00:01:26.369> with

powder<00:03:57.070> and<00:03:57.250> sugar<00:03:57.400> mixture<00:03:57.910> and<00:03:58.420> I'm<00:03:58.780> gonna

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
powder and sugar mixture and I'm gonna

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:01.640 
powder and sugar mixture and I'm gonna
start<00:03:59.260> by<00:03:59.380> adding<00:03:59.920> in<00:04:00.070> just<00:04:00.760> about<00:04:01.060> a<00:04:01.120> half<00:04:01.600> cup

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
start by adding in just about a half cup

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.840 
start by adding in just about a half cup
make<00:04:02.650> sure<00:04:02.830> after<00:04:03.100> you<00:04:03.160> add<00:04:03.370> it<00:04:03.550> in<00:04:03.670> that<00:04:03.790> you

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:03.850 
make sure after you add it in that you

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:05.940 
make sure after you add it in that you
mix<00:04:04.270> it<00:04:04.420> up<00:04:04.540> a<00:04:04.660> little<00:04:04.690> bit<00:04:05.080> before<00:04:05.470> beating<00:04:05.709> it

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:05.950 
mix it up a little bit before beating it

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:07.320 
mix it up a little bit before beating it
with<00:04:06.040> the<00:04:06.190> blender<00:04:06.550> because<00:04:06.670> you<00:04:06.970> don't<00:04:07.150> want

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:07.330 
with the blender because you don't want

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.180 
with the blender because you don't want
the<00:04:07.420> giant<00:04:07.600> puff<00:04:07.930> just<00:04:08.170> like<00:04:08.440> when<00:04:09.070> you're

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.190 
the giant puff just like when you're

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:14.670 
the giant puff just like when you're
mixing<00:04:09.549> flour<00:04:12.720> so<00:04:13.720> I<00:04:13.750> just<00:04:13.959> added<00:04:14.140> another<00:04:14.380> 1/2

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
mixing flour so I just added another 1/2

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.680 
mixing flour so I just added another 1/2
cup<00:04:14.980> so<00:04:15.190> this<00:04:15.310> makes<00:04:15.519> about<00:04:15.760> a<00:04:15.790> cup<00:04:16.090> total<00:04:16.480> so

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
cup so this makes about a cup total so

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:19.259 
cup so this makes about a cup total so
far<00:04:16.989> and<00:04:17.230> you<00:04:17.709> need<00:04:17.920> enough<00:04:18.280> of<00:04:18.519> this<00:04:18.730> icing

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:19.269 
far and you need enough of this icing

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:21.210 
far and you need enough of this icing
mixture<00:04:19.600> to<00:04:19.900> cover<00:04:20.170> the<00:04:20.380> whole<00:04:20.590> top<00:04:20.620> of<00:04:21.010> your

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:21.220 
mixture to cover the whole top of your

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:26.280 
mixture to cover the whole top of your
bar<00:04:21.430> so<00:04:22.030> just<00:04:22.300> keep<00:04:22.480> that<00:04:22.510> in<00:04:22.720> mind<00:04:25.290> it's

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:26.290 
bar so just keep that in mind it's

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:27.930 
bar so just keep that in mind it's
starting<00:04:26.530> to<00:04:26.620> get<00:04:26.740> nice<00:04:26.950> and<00:04:26.980> thick<00:04:27.220> now<00:04:27.730> we're

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:27.940 
starting to get nice and thick now we're

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:30.150 
starting to get nice and thick now we're
just<00:04:28.060> kind<00:04:28.240> of<00:04:28.360> going<00:04:28.510> for<00:04:28.810> the<00:04:29.130> quantity<00:04:30.130> of

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:30.160 
just kind of going for the quantity of

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.510 
just kind of going for the quantity of
it<00:04:30.840> so<00:04:31.840> I'm<00:04:32.110> gonna<00:04:32.230> add<00:04:32.410> another<00:04:32.560> about<00:04:33.190> 1/2

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 
it so I'm gonna add another about 1/2

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:39.210 
it so I'm gonna add another about 1/2
cup<00:04:33.550> of<00:04:33.880> sugar<00:04:37.050> so<00:04:38.050> I<00:04:38.080> finished<00:04:38.710> mixing

you'd take it out of your pan first and

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:39.750 
you'd take it out of your pan first and
put<00:05:37.120> it<00:05:37.210> on<00:05:37.330> just<00:05:37.360> a<00:05:37.720> piece<00:05:37.930> of<00:05:38.430> tinfoil<00:05:39.430> or

just gonna kind of graciously spread it

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:52.740 
just gonna kind of graciously spread it
out<00:05:50.530> over<00:05:50.860> the<00:05:50.950> whole<00:05:51.250> cookie<00:05:51.850> so<00:05:52.450> I've

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:52.750 
out over the whole cookie so I've

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:54.719 
out over the whole cookie so I've
covered<00:05:53.020> my<00:05:53.260> entire<00:05:53.290> cookie<00:05:53.950> sometimes<00:05:54.430> it

00:05:54.719 --> 00:05:54.729 
covered my entire cookie sometimes it

00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:56.339 
covered my entire cookie sometimes it
easier<00:05:55.089> just<00:05:55.330> to<00:05:55.419> use<00:05:55.569> your<00:05:55.749> hands<00:05:55.990> just<00:05:56.199> make

00:05:56.339 --> 00:05:56.349 
easier just to use your hands just make

00:05:56.349 --> 00:05:57.269 
easier just to use your hands just make
sure<00:05:56.499> you<00:05:56.589> wash<00:05:56.770> your<00:05:56.949> hands<00:05:57.099> before

00:05:57.269 --> 00:05:57.279 
sure you wash your hands before

00:05:57.279 --> 00:05:59.399 
sure you wash your hands before
obviously<00:05:58.029> and<00:05:58.270> to<00:05:58.300> spread<00:05:58.990> it<00:05:59.139> out<00:05:59.229> because

00:05:59.399 --> 00:05:59.409 
obviously and to spread it out because

00:05:59.409 --> 00:06:00.959 
obviously and to spread it out because
sometimes<00:05:59.620> the<00:05:59.919> body<00:06:00.159> heat<00:06:00.400> from<00:06:00.550> your<00:06:00.729> hands

00:06:00.959 --> 00:06:00.969 
sometimes the body heat from your hands

00:06:00.969 --> 00:06:03.239 
sometimes the body heat from your hands
just<00:06:01.210> works<00:06:01.389> a<00:06:01.539> lot<00:06:01.749> better<00:06:02.050> at<00:06:02.439> getting<00:06:03.069> it<00:06:03.159> on

00:06:03.239 --> 00:06:03.249 
just works a lot better at getting it on

00:06:03.249 --> 00:06:05.010 
just works a lot better at getting it on
than<00:06:03.460> trying<00:06:03.639> to<00:06:03.729> maneuver<00:06:04.089> a<00:06:04.270> spatula<00:06:04.599> around

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:05.020 
than trying to maneuver a spatula around

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:07.469 
than trying to maneuver a spatula around
so<00:06:06.009> once<00:06:06.249> this<00:06:06.430> is<00:06:06.490> completely<00:06:07.089> covered

00:06:07.469 --> 00:06:07.479 
so once this is completely covered

00:06:07.479 --> 00:06:09.119 
so once this is completely covered
you're<00:06:07.930> gonna<00:06:08.020> go<00:06:08.259> on<00:06:08.469> and<00:06:08.620> you're<00:06:08.740> gonna<00:06:08.830> cut
