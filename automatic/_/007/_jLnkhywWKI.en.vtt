spam sometimes there will be spawners

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.510 
spam sometimes there will be spawners
over<00:00:45.660> there<00:00:48.230> now<00:00:49.230> after<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:49.620> turrets<00:00:50.039> guys

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
over there now after the turrets guys

there<00:00:56.300> sometimes<00:00:57.300> that's<00:00:57.510> pretty<00:00:57.809> hard

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
there sometimes that's pretty hard

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.299 
there sometimes that's pretty hard
because<00:00:58.170> it<00:00:58.410> hurts<00:00:58.620> to<00:00:58.739> move<00:00:58.890> out<00:00:59.070> of<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.280> way

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
because it hurts to move out of the way

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.759 
because it hurts to move out of the way
and<00:01:00.180> you'll<00:01:00.690> completely<00:01:01.079> miss<00:01:01.550> but<00:01:03.170> Mundi<00:01:04.170> you

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
and you'll completely miss but Mundi you

and you'll completely miss but Mundi you
go<00:01:05.189> behind<00:01:05.400> generator<00:01:06.150> right<00:01:06.900> there<00:01:08.150> nothing

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
go behind generator right there nothing

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.960 
go behind generator right there nothing
has<00:01:09.330> really<00:01:09.360> messed<00:01:10.260> up<00:01:10.439> hit<00:01:10.650> boxes<00:01:11.220> so<00:01:11.640> it

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
has really messed up hit boxes so it

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.530 
has really messed up hit boxes so it
sometimes<00:01:12.720> really<00:01:12.930> hard<00:01:13.020> to<00:01:13.260> hit<00:01:13.939> but<00:01:14.939> now

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
sometimes really hard to hit but now

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.810 
sometimes really hard to hit but now

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
your cap in the CP I got lucky on this

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.390 
your cap in the CP I got lucky on this
when<00:01:18.299> nobody<00:01:18.689> spawned<00:01:19.080> on<00:01:19.290> me<00:01:19.500> all<00:01:20.070> I<00:01:20.130> had<00:01:20.369> to

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.039 

pretty<00:01:27.729> easy<00:01:27.909> compared<00:01:28.600> to<00:01:28.659> some<00:01:28.899> of<00:01:28.929> the

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:29.049 
pretty easy compared to some of the

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:35.540 
pretty easy compared to some of the
times<00:01:29.319> i<00:01:29.499> attempted<00:01:29.890> this

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:35.550 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:38.840 

I<00:01:35.670> gotta<00:01:36.510> get<00:01:36.600> a<00:01:36.690> jump<00:01:36.930> there<00:01:37.170> only<00:01:38.070> one<00:01:38.550> jump

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
I gotta get a jump there only one jump

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.730 
I gotta get a jump there only one jump
that<00:01:39.120> we<00:01:39.210> have<00:01:39.330> enough<00:01:39.510> stamina<00:01:39.810> to<00:01:40.380> sprint

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
that we have enough stamina to sprint

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.580 
that we have enough stamina to sprint
over<00:01:40.950> to<00:01:41.070> here<00:01:41.570> two<00:01:42.570> jumps<00:01:42.960> and<00:01:43.140> then<00:01:43.260> you<00:01:43.410> have

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
over to here two jumps and then you have

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.410 
over to here two jumps and then you have
to<00:01:43.620> hit<00:01:43.830> with<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.190> second<00:01:44.640> and<00:01:44.760> third<00:01:44.790> parts

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
to hit with the second and third parts

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.120 
to hit with the second and third parts
of<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:45.600> combo<00:01:46.160> that'll<00:01:47.160> kill<00:01:47.340> it<00:01:48.140> and<00:01:49.140> just

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
of the combo that'll kill it and just

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.180 
of the combo that'll kill it and just
sprint<00:01:50.940> the<00:01:51.030> flag<00:01:51.270> all<00:01:51.510> the<00:01:51.660> way<00:01:51.750> back<00:01:52.190> use

sprint the flag all the way back use

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:58.550 
sprint the flag all the way back use
ramps<00:01:54.770> it's<00:01:55.770> all<00:01:55.830> pretty<00:01:56.070> simple<00:01:57.530> walk<00:01:58.530> a

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
ramps it's all pretty simple walk a

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:06.520 
ramps it's all pretty simple walk a
little<00:01:58.800> bit<00:01:58.950> to<00:01:59.430> regain<00:02:00.090> some<00:02:00.300> stamina

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:13.210
