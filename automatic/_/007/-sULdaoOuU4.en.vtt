another<00:00:08.400> stitch<00:00:08.760> that<00:00:09.000> I<00:00:09.059> would<00:00:09.480> like<00:00:09.630> to<00:00:09.660> show

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
another stitch that I would like to show

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.280 
another stitch that I would like to show
you<00:00:09.990> close<00:00:10.740> up<00:00:10.769> is<00:00:11.340> the<00:00:12.150> X<00:00:12.389> and<00:00:12.719> bar<00:00:12.929> stitch

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
you close up is the X and bar stitch

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.700 
you close up is the X and bar stitch
that<00:00:14.190> I<00:00:14.219> use<00:00:14.580> whenever<00:00:15.030> I<00:00:15.269> want<00:00:15.630> to<00:00:15.870> but<00:00:16.260> two

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
that I use whenever I want to but two

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.080 
that I use whenever I want to but two
seams<00:00:17.550> together

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
seams together

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.779 
seams together
I<00:00:18.240> don't<00:00:18.720> want<00:00:18.869> but<00:00:19.590> means<00:00:19.980> that<00:00:20.250> I<00:00:20.279> don't<00:00:20.400> want

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
I don't want but means that I don't want

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.330 
I don't want but means that I don't want
anything<00:00:21.029> to<00:00:21.570> overlap<00:00:22.199> instead<00:00:23.160> they're<00:00:23.310> just

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
anything to overlap instead they're just

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.300 
anything to overlap instead they're just
exactly<00:00:24.150> right<00:00:24.650> butted<00:00:25.650> up<00:00:25.740> against<00:00:26.189> each

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
exactly right butted up against each

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:32.060 
exactly right butted up against each
other<00:00:27.560> so<00:00:28.560> to<00:00:29.189> do<00:00:29.340> this<00:00:29.550> I<00:00:29.820> would<00:00:30.890> going<00:00:31.890> to<00:00:31.980> do

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
other so to do this I would going to do

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.250 
other so to do this I would going to do
this<00:00:32.219> at<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.460> back<00:00:32.610> of<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:32.880> heel<00:00:33.180> I<00:00:33.420> don't

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
this at the back of the heel I don't

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.590 
this at the back of the heel I don't
want<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:34.590> seam<00:00:34.829> all<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.070> way<00:00:35.160> to<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.460> top<00:00:35.730> so

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
want the seam all the way to the top so

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.819 
want the seam all the way to the top so
um<00:00:36.870> so<00:00:37.800> I<00:00:38.160> don't<00:00:39.059> want<00:00:39.390> this<00:00:39.570> seam<00:00:40.290> stitched

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
um so I don't want this seam stitched

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.030 
um so I don't want this seam stitched
closed<00:00:41.309> all<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.790> way<00:00:41.910> to<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.149> top<00:00:42.800> so<00:00:43.800> the

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
closed all the way to the top so the

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:50.389 
closed all the way to the top so the
foot<00:00:44.399> can<00:00:44.640> move<00:00:44.910> a<00:00:45.270> little<00:00:45.480> easier<00:00:45.870> so<00:00:49.399> I've

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
foot can move a little easier so I've

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.000 
foot can move a little easier so I've
put<00:00:51.120> a<00:00:51.149> piece<00:00:51.480> of<00:00:51.510> double-sided<00:00:52.110> tape<00:00:52.710> and

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
put a piece of double-sided tape and

00:00:53.010 --> 00:01:01.279 
put a piece of double-sided tape and
push<00:00:53.850> it<00:00:54.000> down<00:00:55.489> firmly<00:00:56.489> then<00:00:58.579> tear<00:00:59.579> off<00:01:00.289> the

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
push it down firmly then tear off the

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.910 
push it down firmly then tear off the
paper<00:01:01.320> part<00:01:02.120> so<00:01:03.120> it's<00:01:03.390> really<00:01:04.229> important<00:01:04.739> that

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
paper part so it's really important that

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.380 
paper part so it's really important that
if<00:01:05.129> you're<00:01:05.250> going<00:01:05.400> to<00:01:05.460> punch<00:01:05.700> holes<00:01:05.909> in<00:01:06.150> both

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
if you're going to punch holes in both

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.600 
if you're going to punch holes in both
at<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.720> same<00:01:06.930> time<00:01:07.290> that<00:01:07.979> you<00:01:08.189> have<00:01:08.369> them

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
at the same time that you have them

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.030 
at the same time that you have them
exactly<00:01:09.090> lined<00:01:09.840> up<00:01:10.049> with<00:01:10.200> each<00:01:10.229> other<00:01:10.619> that's

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
exactly lined up with each other that's

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.340 
exactly lined up with each other that's
why<00:01:11.369> using<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:13.549> just<00:01:14.549> temporary<00:01:15.180> but<00:01:15.509> using

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
why using the just temporary but using

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.530 
why using the just temporary but using
the<00:01:16.470> double-sided<00:01:16.920> tape<00:01:17.100> isn't<00:01:17.580> really<00:01:18.090> a<00:01:18.270> big

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
the double-sided tape isn't really a big

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.969 
the double-sided tape isn't really a big
help<00:01:18.650> then<00:01:19.650> I<00:01:19.680> make<00:01:20.009> a<00:01:20.040> line<00:01:20.400> for<00:01:20.820> my<00:01:21.000> stitching

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:21.979 
help then I make a line for my stitching

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:25.820 
help then I make a line for my stitching
slits<00:01:22.979> to<00:01:23.100> be<00:01:23.369> punched<00:01:24.299> and<00:01:24.600> I<00:01:25.409> don't<00:01:25.590> want

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
slits to be punched and I don't want

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.929 
slits to be punched and I don't want
these<00:01:26.009> to<00:01:26.549> too<00:01:26.820> far<00:01:27.119> from<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:27.869> edge<00:01:28.350> and

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:28.939 
these to too far from the edge and

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:35.090 
these to too far from the edge and
I'm<00:01:29.939> using<00:01:30.180> a<00:01:33.049> compass<00:01:34.049> with<00:01:34.200> a<00:01:34.229> pen<00:01:34.530> in<00:01:34.560> it<00:01:34.740> so

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
I'm using a compass with a pen in it so

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.249 
I'm using a compass with a pen in it so
that<00:01:35.250> you<00:01:35.340> can<00:01:35.579> can<00:01:36.210> see<00:01:36.420> what<00:01:36.570> I'm<00:01:36.689> doing<00:01:36.720> but

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
that you can can see what I'm doing but

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.550 
that you can can see what I'm doing but
I<00:01:38.159> would<00:01:38.430> usually<00:01:38.700> if<00:01:39.119> this<00:01:39.600> if<00:01:40.170> I<00:01:40.350> were<00:01:40.470> going

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
I would usually if this if I were going

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.800 
I would usually if this if I were going
to<00:01:40.619> cover<00:01:40.829> it<00:01:41.040> with<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.310> heel<00:01:41.579> support<00:01:42.119> piece

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
to cover it with the heel support piece

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.420 
to cover it with the heel support piece
then<00:01:43.140> of<00:01:43.350> course<00:01:43.560> it<00:01:43.680> doesn't<00:01:43.860> matter<00:01:44.100> if<00:01:44.340> I

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
then of course it doesn't matter if I

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.670 
then of course it doesn't matter if I
have<00:01:44.670> pen<00:01:45.270> lines<00:01:45.540> but<00:01:45.899> if<00:01:46.020> I'm<00:01:46.110> if<00:01:46.290> it's<00:01:46.439> going

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
have pen lines but if I'm if it's going

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.990 
have pen lines but if I'm if it's going
to<00:01:46.740> be<00:01:46.920> exposed<00:01:47.450> then<00:01:48.450> I<00:01:49.430> would<00:01:50.430> use<00:01:50.579> a<00:01:50.610> silver

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
to be exposed then I would use a silver

00:01:51.000 --> 00:02:05.469 
to be exposed then I would use a silver
pen<00:01:51.259> so<00:01:52.259> I'm<00:01:52.710> punching<00:01:53.460> holes

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:12.580 

okay<00:02:06.479> but<00:02:06.750> I'll<00:02:07.020> do<00:02:07.289> one<00:02:07.469> more<00:02:07.500> set<00:02:10.910> all<00:02:11.910> right

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
okay but I'll do one more set all right

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.070 
okay but I'll do one more set all right
so<00:02:13.590> now<00:02:13.800> I<00:02:13.830> probably<00:02:14.519> want<00:02:14.910> to<00:02:15.000> get<00:02:15.870> rid<00:02:16.050> of

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
so now I probably want to get rid of

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.640 
so now I probably want to get rid of
that<00:02:16.970> tape<00:02:17.970> there<00:02:18.299> it's<00:02:19.230> kind<00:02:19.440> of<00:02:19.500> sticky

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
that tape there it's kind of sticky

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.690 
that tape there it's kind of sticky
again<00:02:22.650> the<00:02:24.560> natural<00:02:25.560> crepe<00:02:26.010> we'll<00:02:26.340> take<00:02:26.549> it

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
again the natural crepe we'll take it

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:34.960 
again the natural crepe we'll take it
off<00:02:27.620> so<00:02:28.620> now<00:02:28.799> I<00:02:28.830> want<00:02:29.160> to<00:02:29.220> stitch<00:02:33.019> these<00:02:34.019> two

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
off so now I want to stitch these two

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.300 
off so now I want to stitch these two
pieces<00:02:35.970> together<00:02:36.150> at<00:02:36.599> the<00:02:36.720> heel<00:02:36.930> seam<00:02:37.230> so<00:02:38.010> I've

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
pieces together at the heel seam so I've

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:43.850 
pieces together at the heel seam so I've
got<00:02:38.519> my<00:02:41.360> black<00:02:42.360> thread<00:02:42.660> with<00:02:43.049> harness<00:02:43.650> needles

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
got my black thread with harness needles

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.270 
got my black thread with harness needles
at<00:02:44.130> each<00:02:44.250> end<00:02:44.549> and<00:02:44.849> so<00:02:45.569> I'm<00:02:45.690> just<00:02:45.870> going<00:02:46.110> to

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
at each end and so I'm just going to

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:52.509 
at each end and so I'm just going to
make<00:02:47.280> a<00:02:47.310> loop<00:02:47.579> around<00:02:47.790> these<00:02:48.120> top<00:02:48.769> slits<00:02:50.239> so

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:52.519 
make a loop around these top slits so

00:02:52.519 --> 00:03:00.650 
make a loop around these top slits so
I'll<00:02:53.519> do<00:02:53.730> that<00:02:53.879> again<00:02:57.560> and<00:02:59.239> you'll<00:03:00.239> see<00:03:00.329> that

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
I'll do that again and you'll see that

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.119 
I'll do that again and you'll see that
doesn't<00:03:00.870> matter<00:03:01.200> a<00:03:01.319> lot<00:03:01.530> that<00:03:01.709> you<00:03:01.860> get<00:03:02.010> the

00:03:02.119 --> 00:03:02.129 
doesn't matter a lot that you get the

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:04.250 
doesn't matter a lot that you get the
threads<00:03:02.400> exactly<00:03:03.030> the<00:03:03.180> same<00:03:03.390> length<00:03:03.690> you'll

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
threads exactly the same length you'll

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:10.370 
threads exactly the same length you'll
see<00:03:04.470> why<00:03:06.319> okay<00:03:08.180> so<00:03:09.180> I've<00:03:09.269> got<00:03:09.329> that<00:03:09.660> secured<00:03:10.170> I

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
see why okay so I've got that secured I

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.470 
see why okay so I've got that secured I
might<00:03:10.620> you<00:03:11.459> might<00:03:11.609> even<00:03:11.760> take<00:03:12.120> it<00:03:12.269> around

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
might you might even take it around

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.059 
might you might even take it around
another<00:03:12.660> time<00:03:13.019> but<00:03:13.260> I<00:03:13.440> don't<00:03:13.620> know<00:03:13.709> what<00:03:13.889> you'd

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:14.069 
another time but I don't know what you'd

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:16.160 
another time but I don't know what you'd
really<00:03:14.190> gain<00:03:14.489> okay<00:03:15.359> so<00:03:15.569> we're<00:03:15.870> now<00:03:15.959> going<00:03:16.109> to

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
really gain okay so we're now going to

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.349 
really gain okay so we're now going to
now<00:03:16.650> we're<00:03:16.859> going<00:03:17.069> to<00:03:17.160> make<00:03:17.340> a<00:03:17.639> cross<00:03:18.030> stitch

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:18.359 
now we're going to make a cross stitch

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:22.190 
now we're going to make a cross stitch
which<00:03:18.989> I<00:03:19.380> don't<00:03:19.889> know<00:03:20.190> if<00:03:20.280> the<00:03:20.930> days<00:03:21.930> are<00:03:22.170> over

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
which I don't know if the days are over

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.180 
which I don't know if the days are over
for<00:03:23.569> young<00:03:24.569> girls<00:03:24.930> to<00:03:25.290> make<00:03:25.560> cross<00:03:25.889> stitch

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
for young girls to make cross stitch

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.370 
for young girls to make cross stitch
samplers<00:03:26.849> they<00:03:27.030> probably<00:03:27.299> figured<00:03:28.049> out<00:03:28.139> some

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
samplers they probably figured out some

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:32.300 
samplers they probably figured out some
way<00:03:28.410> to<00:03:28.590> do<00:03:28.799> that<00:03:29.000> digitally<00:03:30.859> so<00:03:31.859> I'm<00:03:32.040> going<00:03:32.250> to

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
way to do that digitally so I'm going to

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.729 
way to do that digitally so I'm going to
take<00:03:32.730> this<00:03:33.000> thread<00:03:33.450> that's<00:03:33.660> on<00:03:33.840> the<00:03:34.200> left<00:03:34.440> side

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
take this thread that's on the left side

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:38.930 
take this thread that's on the left side
of<00:03:34.980> the<00:03:35.750> seam<00:03:36.750> and<00:03:37.049> take<00:03:37.680> it<00:03:37.859> to<00:03:38.069> the<00:03:38.190> next<00:03:38.400> slit

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
of the seam and take it to the next slit

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.659 
of the seam and take it to the next slit
down<00:03:39.209> on<00:03:39.510> the<00:03:39.630> right<00:03:39.840> side<00:03:40.169> and<00:03:40.530> the<00:03:41.250> key<00:03:41.489> to

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:41.669 
down on the right side and the key to

00:03:41.669 --> 00:03:45.349 
down on the right side and the key to
getting<00:03:42.269> this<00:03:42.510> right<00:03:43.019> is<00:03:43.319> to<00:03:43.380> each<00:03:44.010> time<00:03:44.430> bring

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:45.359 
getting this right is to each time bring

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:47.170 
getting this right is to each time bring
your<00:03:45.510> thread<00:03:45.750> right<00:03:46.079> back<00:03:46.380> up<00:03:46.650> to<00:03:46.829> the<00:03:46.950> top

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
directly across from where it went in

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:53.120 
directly across from where it went in
and<00:03:49.680> then<00:03:50.280> you<00:03:50.430> can<00:03:50.579> let<00:03:50.760> go<00:03:50.940> of<00:03:50.970> it<00:03:51.950> now<00:03:52.950> I'm

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
and then you can let go of it now I'm

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:56.360 
and then you can let go of it now I'm
going<00:03:53.370> to<00:03:53.489> take<00:03:53.669> my<00:03:53.849> other<00:03:54.000> thread<00:03:54.980> go<00:03:55.980> in<00:03:56.160> the

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
going to take my other thread go in the

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:02.479 
going to take my other thread go in the
same<00:03:58.730> slit<00:04:00.440> that<00:04:01.440> I<00:04:01.500> just<00:04:01.980> pull<00:04:02.250> the<00:04:02.400> other

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489 
same slit that I just pull the other

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:06.309 
same slit that I just pull the other
thread<00:04:02.940> up<00:04:03.209> through<00:04:03.690> and<00:04:04.220> that<00:04:05.220> completes<00:04:05.700> my

00:04:06.309 --> 00:04:06.319 
thread up through and that completes my

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:09.339 
thread up through and that completes my
X

00:04:09.339 --> 00:04:09.349 

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:14.630 

then<00:04:10.349> I've<00:04:10.469> got<00:04:10.739> an<00:04:11.280> X<00:04:11.609> there<00:04:12.379> and<00:04:13.379> as<00:04:14.280> I<00:04:14.579> said

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 
then I've got an X there and as I said

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.150 
then I've got an X there and as I said
before<00:04:14.819> immediately<00:04:15.569> take<00:04:16.289> it<00:04:16.320> back<00:04:16.650> up<00:04:16.889> in

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
before immediately take it back up in

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.300 
before immediately take it back up in
the<00:04:17.759> hole<00:04:17.940> right<00:04:18.539> across<00:04:18.780> from<00:04:19.079> it<00:04:19.259> and<00:04:19.500> a<00:04:20.130> good

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
the hole right across from it and a good

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:21.680 
the hole right across from it and a good
way<00:04:20.459> to<00:04:20.519> make<00:04:20.910> sure<00:04:20.940> you're<00:04:21.329> doing<00:04:21.449> the<00:04:21.660> right

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
way to make sure you're doing the right

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:26.029 
way to make sure you're doing the right
thing<00:04:21.840> is<00:04:22.410> to<00:04:23.690> check<00:04:24.690> the<00:04:25.080> back<00:04:25.289> side<00:04:25.650> you

00:04:26.029 --> 00:04:26.039 
thing is to check the back side you

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:29.210 
thing is to check the back side you
should<00:04:26.220> see<00:04:26.400> bars<00:04:26.940> like<00:04:27.360> this<00:04:27.600> and<00:04:28.220> some

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 
should see bars like this and some

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.360 
should see bars like this and some
people<00:04:29.550> I<00:04:29.820> like<00:04:30.810> the<00:04:31.139> bars<00:04:31.350> too<00:04:31.800> I<00:04:31.830> like<00:04:32.160> them

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370 
people I like the bars too I like them

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:35.659 
people I like the bars too I like them
to<00:04:32.580> be<00:04:33.000> showin<00:04:33.449> some<00:04:33.479> time<00:04:33.960> in<00:04:34.229> a<00:04:34.770> interesting

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:35.669 
to be showin some time in a interesting

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:40.189 
to be showin some time in a interesting
color<00:04:35.940> and<00:04:36.710> if<00:04:37.710> you<00:04:38.009> put<00:04:38.370> a<00:04:38.630> thin<00:04:39.630> strip<00:04:40.080> to

00:04:40.189 --> 00:04:40.199 
color and if you put a thin strip to

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:43.070 
color and if you put a thin strip to
something<00:04:40.650> leather<00:04:40.919> or<00:04:41.280> felt<00:04:41.610> or<00:04:41.849> wool<00:04:42.270> then

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080 
something leather or felt or wool then

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:44.839 
something leather or felt or wool then
it's<00:04:43.349> called<00:04:43.620> couching<00:04:44.160> and<00:04:44.340> you<00:04:44.460> can<00:04:44.639> add

00:04:44.839 --> 00:04:44.849 
it's called couching and you can add

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:47.689 
it's called couching and you can add
some<00:04:45.419> decoration<00:04:46.020> that<00:04:46.050> way<00:04:46.400> now<00:04:47.400> I've<00:04:47.550> done

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:47.699 
some decoration that way now I've done

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:50.629 
some decoration that way now I've done
the<00:04:47.880> X<00:04:48.289> but<00:04:49.289> this<00:04:49.440> stitch<00:04:49.680> is<00:04:49.710> called<00:04:50.099> X<00:04:50.370> and

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:50.639 
the X but this stitch is called X and

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:54.499 
the X but this stitch is called X and
bar<00:04:50.849> so<00:04:51.810> I've<00:04:51.930> learned<00:04:52.199> that<00:04:53.180> putting<00:04:54.180> a<00:04:54.270> bar

00:04:54.499 --> 00:04:54.509 
bar so I've learned that putting a bar

00:04:54.509 --> 00:04:56.990 
bar so I've learned that putting a bar
at<00:04:54.690> the<00:04:54.840> bottom<00:04:55.020> of<00:04:55.320> the<00:04:55.410> X<00:04:55.590> makes<00:04:56.280> it<00:04:56.520> a<00:04:56.669> lot

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.000 
at the bottom of the X makes it a lot

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.270 
at the bottom of the X makes it a lot
more<00:04:57.380> stable<00:04:58.380> a<00:04:58.740> lot<00:04:59.340> tighter<00:05:00.110> stitch<00:05:01.110> so<00:05:01.470> so

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:02.280 
more stable a lot tighter stitch so so

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.600 
more stable a lot tighter stitch so so
that<00:05:02.610> you<00:05:02.940> can<00:05:03.090> take<00:05:03.240> either<00:05:03.479> thread<00:05:03.960> and<00:05:04.259> just

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:04.610 
that you can take either thread and just

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:08.870 
that you can take either thread and just
go<00:05:05.610> in<00:05:06.320> to<00:05:07.320> the<00:05:07.440> slit<00:05:07.710> opposite<00:05:08.250> it<00:05:08.400> and<00:05:08.610> right

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:08.880 
go in to the slit opposite it and right

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.930 
go in to the slit opposite it and right
back<00:05:09.060> up<00:05:09.349> now<00:05:10.349> you've<00:05:10.530> done<00:05:10.710> the<00:05:10.770> X<00:05:11.070> and<00:05:11.490> bar

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:11.940 
back up now you've done the X and bar

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:16.250 
back up now you've done the X and bar
and<00:05:12.560> each<00:05:13.560> time<00:05:13.919> I<00:05:13.949> would<00:05:14.220> give<00:05:14.370> a<00:05:14.400> good<00:05:14.669> tug<00:05:15.260> so

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:16.260 
and each time I would give a good tug so

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:22.909 
and each time I would give a good tug so
it's<00:05:16.440> seated<00:05:16.860> nicely<00:05:21.020> not<00:05:22.020> overlapping<00:05:22.530> but

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:22.919 
it's seated nicely not overlapping but

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:26.120 
it's seated nicely not overlapping but
right<00:05:23.159> up<00:05:23.340> tight<00:05:23.639> against<00:05:24.060> each<00:05:24.180> other<00:05:25.130> okay

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:26.130 
right up tight against each other okay

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:28.279 
right up tight against each other okay
so<00:05:26.909> you<00:05:26.970> can<00:05:27.120> see<00:05:27.270> why<00:05:27.449> I<00:05:27.479> said<00:05:27.750> it's<00:05:27.900> not<00:05:28.050> that

00:05:28.279 --> 00:05:28.289 
so you can see why I said it's not that

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:30.500 
so you can see why I said it's not that
not<00:05:28.949> important<00:05:29.610> that<00:05:29.639> you<00:05:29.849> have<00:05:30.030> your<00:05:30.060> threads

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:30.510 
not important that you have your threads

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:33.050 
not important that you have your threads
exactly<00:05:31.050> the<00:05:31.199> same<00:05:31.409> length<00:05:31.710> because<00:05:32.060> one

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:33.060 
exactly the same length because one

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:34.580 
exactly the same length because one
thread<00:05:33.360> is<00:05:33.539> going<00:05:33.690> to<00:05:33.810> be<00:05:33.990> making<00:05:34.409> that

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:34.590 
thread is going to be making that

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:37.460 
thread is going to be making that
additional<00:05:35.250> loop<00:05:36.150> and<00:05:36.419> you<00:05:36.539> can<00:05:36.570> always<00:05:37.229> use

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:37.470 
additional loop and you can always use

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:40.550 
additional loop and you can always use
the<00:05:38.300> thread<00:05:39.300> that's<00:05:39.509> the<00:05:39.659> longest<00:05:40.169> to<00:05:40.380> make

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:40.560 
the thread that's the longest to make

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:42.080 
the thread that's the longest to make
the<00:05:40.740> loop<00:05:40.889> it<00:05:41.099> doesn't<00:05:41.430> matter<00:05:41.610> which<00:05:41.880> one

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:42.090 
the loop it doesn't matter which one

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:44.990 
the loop it doesn't matter which one
does<00:05:42.330> it<00:05:42.539> so<00:05:43.139> another<00:05:43.949> will<00:05:44.669> do<00:05:44.789> one<00:05:44.970> more

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:45.000 
does it so another will do one more

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.469 
does it so another will do one more
stitch<00:05:45.360> so<00:05:46.400> from<00:05:47.400> the<00:05:47.580> right<00:05:47.789> side<00:05:48.120> to<00:05:48.449> the

00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:48.479 
stitch so from the right side to the

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:49.040 
stitch so from the right side to the
next

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:49.050 
next

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:52.730 
next
slit<00:05:49.680> down<00:05:49.919> on<00:05:50.130> the<00:05:50.250> left<00:05:50.490> and<00:05:51.139> what<00:05:52.139> did<00:05:52.349> I<00:05:52.470> say

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:52.740 
slit down on the left and what did I say

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:55.640 
slit down on the left and what did I say
I<00:05:53.070> said<00:05:53.729> bring<00:05:53.909> it<00:05:54.060> right<00:05:54.270> back<00:05:54.330> up<00:05:54.720> and

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:55.650 
I said bring it right back up and

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:58.189 
I said bring it right back up and
directly<00:05:56.099> across<00:05:56.250> from<00:05:56.820> it<00:05:57.330> then<00:05:57.840> you<00:05:58.020> can

00:05:58.189 --> 00:05:58.199 
directly across from it then you can

00:05:58.199 --> 00:06:01.339 
directly across from it then you can
drop<00:05:58.409> it<00:05:58.699> take<00:05:59.699> the<00:05:59.849> other<00:06:00.000> thread<00:06:00.360> and<00:06:00.750> make

00:06:01.339 --> 00:06:01.349 
drop it take the other thread and make

00:06:01.349 --> 00:06:04.249 
drop it take the other thread and make
the<00:06:01.500> other<00:06:01.680> leg<00:06:02.190> of<00:06:02.430> the<00:06:02.699> X<00:06:02.909> so<00:06:03.750> I'm<00:06:03.870> going<00:06:03.900> in

00:06:04.249 --> 00:06:04.259 
the other leg of the X so I'm going in

00:06:04.259 --> 00:06:06.680 
the other leg of the X so I'm going in
that<00:06:04.440> slit<00:06:05.099> where<00:06:05.610> the<00:06:05.820> thread<00:06:06.060> just<00:06:06.240> came<00:06:06.509> out

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:06.690 
that slit where the thread just came out

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:12.409 
that slit where the thread just came out
of<00:06:08.300> and<00:06:10.220> again<00:06:11.220> I'm<00:06:11.490> going<00:06:11.699> to<00:06:11.789> follow<00:06:12.060> the

00:06:12.409 --> 00:06:12.419 
of and again I'm going to follow the

00:06:12.419 --> 00:06:15.230 
of and again I'm going to follow the
directions<00:06:12.979> go<00:06:13.979> right<00:06:14.220> back<00:06:14.430> up<00:06:14.460> across<00:06:14.970> from

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:15.240 
directions go right back up across from

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:17.300 
directions go right back up across from
it<00:06:15.360> and<00:06:15.599> I<00:06:16.199> can<00:06:16.380> take<00:06:16.560> the<00:06:16.710> one<00:06:16.830> that's<00:06:17.039> in<00:06:17.159> my

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:17.310 
it and I can take the one that's in my

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:22.159 
it and I can take the one that's in my
hand<00:06:17.669> and<00:06:19.610> make<00:06:20.610> a<00:06:20.639> loop<00:06:20.969> around

00:06:22.159 --> 00:06:22.169 
hand and make a loop around

00:06:22.169 --> 00:06:27.700 
hand and make a loop around
down<00:06:22.319> across<00:06:22.740> from<00:06:23.219> it<00:06:24.029> and<00:06:24.439> then<00:06:26.539> back<00:06:27.539> up

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:27.710 
down across from it and then back up

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:31.879 
down across from it and then back up
through<00:06:28.710> the<00:06:28.800> hole<00:06:28.949> I<00:06:28.979> just<00:06:29.370> left<00:06:30.560> so<00:06:31.560> in

00:06:31.879 --> 00:06:31.889 
through the hole I just left so in

00:06:31.889 --> 00:06:42.170 
through the hole I just left so in
another<00:06:32.069> bar<00:06:33.469> and<00:06:34.469> pull<00:06:34.680> it<00:06:34.800> tight<00:06:35.039> and<00:06:41.150> so<00:06:42.150> I

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:42.180 
another bar and pull it tight and so I

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:44.559 
another bar and pull it tight and so I
have<00:06:42.389> a<00:06:42.419> stitch<00:06:42.719> to<00:06:42.749> use<00:06:42.930> anytime<00:06:43.409> that<00:06:43.830> I<00:06:43.860> want

00:06:44.559 --> 00:06:44.569 
have a stitch to use anytime that I want

00:06:44.569 --> 00:06:48.920 
have a stitch to use anytime that I want
two<00:06:45.569> pieces<00:06:45.960> to<00:06:46.110> be<00:06:46.580> buttered<00:06:47.580> up<00:06:47.930> against

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:48.930 
two pieces to be buttered up against

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:51.229 
two pieces to be buttered up against
each<00:06:49.050> other
