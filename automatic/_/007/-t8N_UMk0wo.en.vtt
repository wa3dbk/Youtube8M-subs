angle is enabled it is enabled
ok<00:05:22.979> that's<00:05:23.669> all<00:05:24.270> for<00:05:24.840> this<00:05:25.320> tutorial<00:05:25.470> and<00:05:26.010> the

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:26.430 
ok that's all for this tutorial and the

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:28.219 
ok that's all for this tutorial and the
next<00:05:26.669> tutorial<00:05:27.120> we<00:05:27.270> are<00:05:27.300> going<00:05:27.449> to<00:05:27.870> create<00:05:28.139> a

00:05:28.219 --> 00:05:28.229 
next tutorial we are going to create a

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:32.930 
next tutorial we are going to create a
script<00:05:28.590> to<00:05:29.159> control<00:05:29.840> the<00:05:30.840> our<00:05:31.169> player<00:05:31.919> if<00:05:32.520> we

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:32.940 
script to control the our player if we

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:59.590 
script to control the our player if we
hit<00:05:33.240> the<00:05:33.539> play<00:05:33.659> button

00:05:59.590 --> 00:05:59.600 

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:31.379 

mobsters

00:06:31.379 --> 00:06:31.389 

00:06:31.389 --> 00:06:35.320 

so<00:06:32.389> when<00:06:33.229> we<00:06:33.349> test<00:06:33.620> our<00:06:33.860> game<00:06:34.190> we<00:06:34.849> see<00:06:35.090> our

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:35.330 
so when we test our game we see our

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:37.960 
so when we test our game we see our
player<00:06:35.720> falling<00:06:36.319> because<00:06:36.889> we<00:06:37.310> have<00:06:37.490> applied

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:37.970 
player falling because we have applied

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:42.460 
player falling because we have applied
our<00:06:38.389> to<00:06:39.380> the<00:06:40.000> rigidbody<00:06:41.000> thank<00:06:41.930> you<00:06:42.080> so<00:06:42.259> much

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:42.470 
our to the rigidbody thank you so much

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:44.469 
our to the rigidbody thank you so much
in<00:06:42.680> the<00:06:42.860> next<00:06:43.220> tutorial<00:06:43.669> we<00:06:43.699> are<00:06:43.849> going<00:06:44.030> to

00:06:44.469 --> 00:06:44.479 
in the next tutorial we are going to

00:06:44.479 --> 00:06:47.950 
in the next tutorial we are going to
create<00:06:44.720> a<00:06:44.810> script<00:06:45.229> to<00:06:45.860> control<00:06:46.130> our<00:06:46.639> jet<00:06:47.389> pack

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:47.960 
create a script to control our jet pack

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:50.770 
create a script to control our jet pack
thank<00:06:48.560> you
