far as the constant force benches go

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.270 
far as the constant force benches go
they<00:01:48.460> pretty<00:01:48.910> much<00:01:49.030> just<00:01:49.650> don't<00:01:50.650> lock<00:01:51.010> on<00:01:51.190> the

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 
they pretty much just don't lock on the

they pretty much just don't lock on the
roller<00:01:51.460> there<00:01:51.700> and<00:01:51.910> this<00:01:52.450> cable<00:01:52.990> pulls<00:01:53.770> it

super<00:03:40.459> flat<00:03:40.760> frames<00:03:41.170> high<00:03:42.170> tension<00:03:42.680> and<00:03:42.890> it

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
super flat frames high tension and it

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.340 
super flat frames high tension and it
just<00:03:43.430> it's<00:03:43.820> literally<00:03:44.450> the<00:03:44.630> flip<00:03:45.019> of<00:03:45.049> two
