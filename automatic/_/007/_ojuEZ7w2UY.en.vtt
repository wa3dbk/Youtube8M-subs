around the basket I think you want us
could<00:01:14.729> be<00:01:14.850> very<00:01:15.030> similar<00:01:15.380> would<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.500> idea

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
could be very similar would the idea

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.710 
could be very similar would the idea
that<00:01:16.890> again<00:01:17.580> I<00:01:17.610> think<00:01:17.729> he's<00:01:17.970> a<00:01:18.000> smarter<00:01:18.509> player

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720

that again I think he's a smarter player
already<00:01:19.220> but<00:01:20.220> that's<00:01:20.580> a<00:01:20.700> player<00:01:20.909> that<00:01:21.150> I<00:01:21.180> kind

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
already but that's a player that I kind

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.210 
already but that's a player that I kind
of<00:01:21.630> when<00:01:21.960> I<00:01:21.990> think<00:01:22.080> of<00:01:22.409> different<00:01:22.860> players<00:01:23.040> to

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
very difficult for you honest to play

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.560 
very difficult for you honest to play
against<00:02:04.550> then<00:02:05.550> other<00:02:05.729> times<00:02:05.789> yet<00:02:06.210> place<00:02:06.420> a

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
against then other times yet place a

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.060 
against then other times yet place a
play<00:02:06.780> against<00:02:07.050> Tim<00:02:07.229> Duncan<00:02:07.259> he<00:02:07.860> played

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:08.070 
play against Tim Duncan he played

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:10.400 
play against Tim Duncan he played
extremely<00:02:08.489> well<00:02:08.640> so<00:02:09.360> he's<00:02:09.810> making<00:02:10.050> his

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
extremely well so he's making his

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.979 
extremely well so he's making his
adjustments<00:02:11.239> some<00:02:12.239> are<00:02:12.390> tougher<00:02:12.690> than<00:02:12.720> others

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
adjustments some are tougher than others

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:15.050 
adjustments some are tougher than others
but<00:02:13.800> you<00:02:14.010> know<00:02:14.100> he's<00:02:14.310> going<00:02:14.580> to<00:02:14.670> get<00:02:14.790> stronger

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
but you know he's going to get stronger

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.520 
but you know he's going to get stronger
and<00:02:15.420> he's<00:02:15.570> going<00:02:15.750> to<00:02:15.840> get<00:02:15.959> better<00:02:16.110> I<00:02:16.260> think

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
and he's going to get better I think

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:17.810 
and he's going to get better I think
that's<00:02:16.830> one<00:02:16.980> of<00:02:17.010> the<00:02:17.070> first<00:02:17.250> thing<00:02:17.459> you<00:02:17.550> honest

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
realized i need to get stronger i need

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.850 
realized i need to get stronger i need
to<00:02:20.280> lift<00:02:20.430> weights<00:02:20.640> so<00:02:21.540> talking<00:02:22.320> about<00:02:22.500> stats

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
to lift weights so talking about stats

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.120 
to lift weights so talking about stats

and these types what he has now is a

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.900 
and these types what he has now is a
good<00:02:26.790> average<00:02:27.500> know<00:02:28.500> his<00:02:28.650> numbers<00:02:29.040> his<00:02:29.580> stats

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910

does have a player like linis you have

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.400 
does have a player like linis you have
other<00:03:02.040> European<00:03:02.610> players<00:03:02.880> like<00:03:03.120> Jose<00:03:03.410> players

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
other European players like Jose players

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:05.840

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.850 
five for him normal is okay like yeah I
mean<00:03:29.880> it's<00:03:30.060> difficult<00:03:30.660> it's<00:03:31.170> difficult<00:03:31.320> to

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 
mean it's difficult it's difficult to

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:34.550 
mean it's difficult it's difficult to
start<00:03:32.190> out<00:03:32.340> that<00:03:32.550> way<00:03:32.690> especially<00:03:33.690> more<00:03:34.320> for

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
start out that way especially more for

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:35.780 
start out that way especially more for
the<00:03:34.650> national<00:03:35.100> player<00:03:35.280> because<00:03:35.490> there's<00:03:35.640> so

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
the national player because there's so

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.750 
the national player because there's so
much<00:03:35.940> more<00:03:36.150> to<00:03:36.210> learn<00:03:36.540> but<00:03:36.870> it's<00:03:37.560> also<00:03:37.760> you

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
much more to learn but it's also you

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.190 
much more to learn but it's also you
know<00:03:38.790> the<00:03:39.030> expression<00:03:39.330> you<00:03:39.630> get<00:03:39.780> thrown<00:03:40.020> into

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
know the expression you get thrown into

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.650 
know the expression you get thrown into
the<00:03:40.410> fire<00:03:40.440> well<00:03:41.100> that's<00:03:42.090> the<00:03:42.240> best<00:03:42.420> way<00:03:42.600> to

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
the fire well that's the best way to

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.510 
the fire well that's the best way to
learn<00:03:42.870> and<00:03:43.200> especially<00:03:43.950> when<00:03:44.220> you<00:03:44.310> have<00:03:44.400> an

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:44.520 
learn and especially when you have an

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.370 
learn and especially when you have an
attitude<00:03:44.670> like<00:03:45.180> you<00:03:45.480> honest<00:03:45.660> because<00:03:45.990> like<00:03:46.290> I

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
attitude like you honest because like I

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.280 
attitude like you honest because like I
said<00:03:46.440> he's<00:03:46.680> always<00:03:47.070> ready<00:03:47.820> so<00:03:48.810> you<00:03:49.140> know<00:03:49.230> I

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
said he's always ready so you know I

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:50.870 
said he's always ready so you know I
think<00:03:49.800> it's<00:03:49.890> a<00:03:49.980> great<00:03:50.100> environment<00:03:50.400> for<00:03:50.700> him

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880 
think it's a great environment for him

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.020 
think it's a great environment for him
he<00:03:51.480> had<00:03:51.840> like<00:03:52.050> 20<00:03:52.890> points<00:03:53.190> 10<00:03:53.340> rebounds<00:03:53.520> I

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
he had like 20 points 10 rebounds I

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:55.520 
he had like 20 points 10 rebounds I
think<00:03:54.450> potentially<00:03:54.750> he's<00:03:55.170> the<00:03:55.320> type<00:03:55.500> of

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
think potentially he's the type of

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.080 
think potentially he's the type of
player<00:03:55.770> that<00:03:55.890> can<00:03:56.220> give<00:03:56.430> you<00:03:56.550> those<00:03:56.730> kind<00:03:57.000> of

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
player that can give you those kind of

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.660 
player that can give you those kind of
numbers<00:03:57.350> again<00:03:58.350> it<00:03:58.470> all<00:03:58.590> depends<00:03:58.950> on<00:03:59.160> how<00:03:59.610> he

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
numbers again it all depends on how he

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:01.790 
numbers again it all depends on how he
adapts<00:04:00.360> how<00:04:00.480> he<00:04:00.540> learns<00:04:00.930> and<00:04:01.230> how<00:04:01.290> strong<00:04:01.620> he

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:01.800 
adapts how he learns and how strong he

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.490 
adapts how he learns and how strong he
gets<00:04:02.070> and<00:04:02.370> but<00:04:03.270> I<00:04:03.300> heat<00:04:03.630> to<00:04:03.780> me<00:04:03.900> seems<00:04:04.230> like<00:04:04.320> the

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
gets and but I heat to me seems like the

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.290 
gets and but I heat to me seems like the
type<00:04:04.650> of<00:04:04.710> player<00:04:04.980> that<00:04:05.070> can<00:04:05.370> has<00:04:05.910> the<00:04:06.120> right

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:06.300 
type of player that can has the right

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:07.820 
type of player that can has the right
attitude<00:04:06.450> to<00:04:06.750> become<00:04:07.140> a<00:04:07.170> player<00:04:07.470> like<00:04:07.500> that

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:07.830 
attitude to become a player like that

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:09.980 
attitude to become a player like that
