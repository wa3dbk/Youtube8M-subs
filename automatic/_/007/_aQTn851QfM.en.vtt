00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
hair once a week every week probably

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.160 
hair once a week every week probably
should<00:00:15.660> do<00:00:15.750> it<00:00:15.870> more<00:00:16.039> but<00:00:17.039> because<00:00:17.850> my<00:00:18.170> scalp

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
should do it more but because my scalp

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.519 
should do it more but because my scalp
produces<00:00:19.710> a<00:00:20.100> lot<00:00:20.400> of<00:00:20.430> sebum<00:00:21.230> but<00:00:22.230> I<00:00:22.260> just<00:00:22.439> don't

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:33.380 
um for the most part i was using

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.590 
um for the most part i was using
shampoos<00:00:34.380> and<00:00:34.950> then<00:00:35.430> I'd<00:00:35.579> condition<00:00:36.210> and<00:00:36.510> then

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
shampoos and then I'd condition and then

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.100 
shampoos and then I'd condition and then
I'm<00:00:36.719> deep<00:00:37.050> condition<00:00:37.500> um<00:00:37.760> as<00:00:38.809> far<00:00:39.809> as<00:00:39.930> deep

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
I'm deep condition um as far as deep

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.990 
I'm deep condition um as far as deep
conditioning<00:00:40.620> it's<00:00:40.829> one<00:00:41.070> major<00:00:41.370> change<00:00:41.489> that

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
conditioning it's one major change that

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.319 
conditioning it's one major change that
I've<00:00:42.090> made<00:00:42.270> sense<00:00:42.719> um<00:00:43.760> when<00:00:44.760> I<00:00:44.789> was<00:00:45.030> doing<00:00:45.180> my

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
I've made sense um when I was doing my

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.069 
I've made sense um when I was doing my
hair<00:00:45.719> prior<00:00:46.440> to<00:00:46.829> January<00:00:47.610> I've<00:00:48.180> really<00:00:48.870> picked

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
hair prior to January I've really picked

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.779

up<00:00:49.200> on<00:00:49.320> my<00:00:49.440> deep<00:00:49.649> conditions<00:00:50.129> and<00:00:50.460> I<00:00:50.520> think

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
up on my deep conditions and I think

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.810 
up on my deep conditions and I think
it's<00:00:50.969> had<00:00:51.899> a<00:00:51.930> huge<00:00:52.440> effect<00:00:52.559> either<00:00:53.190> deep

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
it's had a huge effect either deep

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.760 
it's had a huge effect either deep
conditioning<00:00:54.270> my<00:00:54.360> hair<00:00:54.449> dry<00:00:54.960> before<00:00:55.230> I<00:00:55.440> wash

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
most heat I've used on my hair for a

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:57.009 
most heat I've used on my hair for a
while<00:03:52.549> but<00:03:53.360> it<00:03:53.930> was<00:03:54.079> cute<00:03:54.380> and<00:03:54.650> I<00:03:55.690> liked<00:03:56.690> it<00:03:56.870> and

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:03.860 
the heat level 2 um so I did like that

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:05.890 
the heat level 2 um so I did like that
style<00:04:04.100> and<00:04:04.430> now<00:04:04.549> I'm<00:04:04.670> back<00:04:04.700> and<00:04:05.090> twist<00:04:05.329> all<00:04:05.870> I

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:05.900 
style and now I'm back and twist all I

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:09.190 
style and now I'm back and twist all I
did<00:04:06.380> was<00:04:06.410> kiss<00:04:06.769> my<00:04:06.980> hair<00:04:07.220> up<00:04:07.370> from<00:04:07.790> wet<00:04:08.780> and

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.200 
did was kiss my hair up from wet and

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.680 
did was kiss my hair up from wet and
then<00:04:09.500> I<00:04:09.560> took<00:04:09.739> each<00:04:10.130> section<00:04:10.790> and<00:04:11.060> then<00:04:11.570> I

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:11.690 
then I took each section and then I

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:13.600 
then I took each section and then I
banded<00:04:12.170> it<00:04:12.320> and<00:04:12.530> that's<00:04:12.680> why<00:04:12.920> my<00:04:13.070> toys<00:04:13.310> kind<00:04:13.549> of

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:13.610 
banded it and that's why my toys kind of

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:15.310 
banded it and that's why my toys kind of
have<00:04:13.730> that<00:04:13.760> little<00:04:14.030> curly<00:04:14.540> wave<00:04:14.720> look<00:04:14.989> to<00:04:15.140> him

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:15.320 
have that little curly wave look to him

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:18.550 
have that little curly wave look to him
but<00:04:16.160> yeah<00:04:16.310> shrinkage<00:04:16.959> but<00:04:17.959> i<00:04:18.019> like<00:04:18.169> it<00:04:18.229> it's

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:18.560 
but yeah shrinkage but i like it it's

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:23.140 
but yeah shrinkage but i like it it's
it's<00:04:19.130> a<00:04:19.280> nice<00:04:19.459> changeup<00:04:19.910> to<00:04:20.060> go<00:04:20.209> from<00:04:21.039> all<00:04:22.039> that

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.150 
it's a nice changeup to go from all that

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.749 
it's a nice changeup to go from all that
big<00:04:23.270> hair<00:04:23.810> to<00:04:24.169> like<00:04:24.410> a<00:04:24.620> nice<00:04:24.830> little<00:04:25.040> short

00:04:25.749 --> 00:04:25.759 
big hair to like a nice little short

00:04:25.759 --> 00:04:29.340
