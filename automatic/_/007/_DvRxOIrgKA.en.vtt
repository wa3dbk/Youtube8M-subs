 We start cutting on such here and 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:30.060
 such here we get pieces further 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:32.570

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.570
 need to 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:40.140
 let's say we cut 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.659
 despite having chicken and so 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:46.470
 soft and gentle and gentle after all 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:50.700
 stabbing it still beating every bit 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:54.689
 and lay on the sheet and the meat is obtained 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:02:00.450
 just very soft do further on 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:02:04.229
 we salt our breasts can still them 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:06.630
 pepper so all the way by the way he 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:10.229
 forgot to tell us what we need 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:12.620
 we will need grated hard cheese 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:16.420
 he should have to pour in Taku 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:19.879
 I ask 200 grams for about 150 200 grams 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:23.360
 let me take about 2 onions can be 3 

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:27.250
 already to your taste and accordingly 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:31.040
 potatoes for example per kilogram and a half 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:38.659
 well and of course mayonnaise take all our 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:40.819
 potatoes it turns out he still 

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:42.950
 roundels of course this is not roundels about 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:47.060
 half rings just potatoes like that 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:48.890
 got all the mode further when by the way 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.599
 not the wrong one first we need 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.450
 cut accounting because we 

00:02:50.599 --> 00:03:00.310
 on top of our meat we will first put 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:03:03.040
 they sound contrary chop uchebke more 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:05.900
 half 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.079
 semicircles also turns we become 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.079
 . 

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:19.819
 here so all things separately and further 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:24.859
 we take onions, I usually do it and sleep 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:28.970
 for meat, too, the area meat eventually looks like 

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:34.700
 like this every and every piece of meat 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:38.769
 so we all almost cut her potatoes 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:43.579
 now we fold so neatly 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:49.609
 krugleshochki our further as we add up its 

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:58.430
 salt and add spices now take 

00:03:49.609 --> 00:04:03.769
 salt salt they will certainly look new 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:10.180
 I put my eyes on the eye, there is much better 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:13.780
 Well no need to not overdo well, basically all 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:17.590
 salt enough take seasonings 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.590
 universal find with dill 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:38.360
 sprinkle further further with us goes we take 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:38.360
 mayonnaise 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:45.450
 let's say only the lid I didn't open 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:47.490
 rare when the total open i usually 

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:48.290
 did i do here with scissors here 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:51.630
 notch 

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:55.110
 to have a thin trickle with us 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:56.700
 mayonnaise because when we start with 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:59.220
 Vito spoon do nothing with us 

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:59.910
 it will turn out therefore we take thin 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:02.670
 trickle 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:07.110
 and in this way we beat our 

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:09.120
 the first potato turns out beautifully 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:13.160
 In the second, nothing can be smeared with a spoon 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:15.500
 just a spoon at all uncomfortable so well all 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:18.330
 the final stage we take cheese and 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:22.380
 sprinkle it all did business with them with 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:30.210
 lightly sludgey cheese why tell you 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:34.230
 one secretary one secret that's cheese 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:36.540
 i'm somewhere half sprinkled with baby 

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:39.530
 end of cooking about 5-10 minutes before 

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:42.330
 cooking i sprinkle with the rest of the cheese 

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:46.380
 accordingly, we get 1 part 

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:48.870
 this cheese turns out to be crispy because 

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:52.470
 what's here and not so much here we are 

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:54.720
 sypem the second part of the cheese is obtained as 

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:56.780
 as if she was fresh just sprinkled 

00:05:54.720 --> 00:06:02.070
 it turns melted 

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:06.440
 the dish turns out so peculiar on 

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:11.070
 view accordingly and the taste will be different 

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:15.560
 there we are, in principle, not sprinkled now 

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:21.900
 we bake in the oven at about 

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:25.140
 180-200 degrees throughout 

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:28.889
 somewhere 40 45 minutes but I think 40 minutes 

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:33.060
 45 minutes is enough 

00:06:28.889 --> 00:06:35.930
 maybe 35 no no open ilyuha 

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:38.639
 rig pierce potatoes with a fork and 

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:39.349
 knife if the potatoes gently it means 

00:06:38.639 --> 00:06:42.210
 all is ready 

00:06:39.349 --> 00:06:44.879
 if the potatoes are firmly cooked further 

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:48.050
 at all we put our oven and already 

00:06:44.879 --> 00:06:53.060
 warmed up so well everything is almost done for me 

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:53.060
 now I sprinkle the remaining cheese 

00:06:53.479 --> 00:07:02.340
 minute and throws another 5 minutes and 

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:04.639
 you can already eat on it all 

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:04.639
 until
