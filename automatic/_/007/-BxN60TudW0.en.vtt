00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.750
 motorbike episode luthi the motorcycle channel of 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:10.050
 youtube that always in motion for you today 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:12.120
 dynamic review of the andes window 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.030
 the many adventure touring jacket 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.279
 season created by windows 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:19.590
 today you see it in this black shade 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.560
 gray the sportiest shade exists 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.869
 two other black colors the high one 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.630
 visibility and the gray 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.490
 let's start from the outside of the jacket 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.800
 jacket is a multi-layered jacket for two 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.329
 layers with membranes andar l'hasta 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.719
 waterproof then a jacket 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.670
 completely waterproof and breathable 

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:39.870
 shoulder and elbow protectors and possibilities 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.070
 to be breaking your back 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.690
 we have already intentionally entered 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.180
 inside the jacket to make you 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.980
 see how the outer pockets fit 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.960
 even if this is a free jacket 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.850
 levi's are completely waterproof 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.190
 so ads have a zipper 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.989
 perfectly arrested holding 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.120
 dry the things we put in our pockets 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.789
 here we have two quick pockets for 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.030
 put things faster and then the 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:05.159
 upper closure which we will discuss later 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:07.049
 two beautiful, very large vents here 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.510
 on the front to channel more 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.159
 quickly the air regulation of the 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.950
 sleeve both in the lower part and in the 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:17.159
 volume here intermediate regulation of the 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.850
 wide reflective sides all this 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:25.500
 central band that here on the sleeve 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:27.360
 now we have a profile jacket here 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.549
 there is a bellows there is a massacre panel 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.619
 which improves the fit of the elbow and 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.329
 here a ceramic treatment that 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.640
 increase the abrasion resistance in 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:38.579
 these points of impact 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.710
 other part then laminated with 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.150
 a penthouse laminated reflector 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.130
 rear pocket 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.780
 what is the purpose of the quilt ends? 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.520
 we have inside we can eliminate it 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.180
 and put it in here in case of change 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.979
 of climate two beautiful rear exhausts 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:55.920
 the air enters from the front but exits from here 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:59.420
 behind in the summer season what 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:02.250
 we can do then it is set 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.600
 first a high collar then for the 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.189
 cooler season but in season 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.310
 summer we have an automatic button that 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:10.110
 allows us to lower the neck 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.590
 close it in this way then have 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.120
 a lower neck in the 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.920
 back can also be comfortable 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.810
 that wearability of certain models of 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.030
 helmet going down 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.610
 and so do not interfere with the neck and 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:25.150
 with the bordeaux collar we see the jacket 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:27.250
 behind here you see how it looks, therefore it is 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.920
 a touring adventure jacket but with a 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:32.319
 quite sporty cut we ingest 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:35.170
 still here and we see this concept 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:37.060
 that what we are to block the neck 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.400
 in the open position because we in the summer 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.950
 we can open the collective up to here 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.989
 that lock in this position then 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:48.340
 we close an automatic engine that there 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:50.980
 allows you to lock our board 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.930
 neck here we open events I love them 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.660
 jacket at most then 20 we give the 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.220
 jacket without having this flutter here 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.590
 one side was built 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:02.970
 napoleona pocket so we can put 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.930
 to the wallet and here it will remain dry 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.599
 another important thing 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:10.060
 homologated shoulders and elbows protections 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:11.140
 removable so wanting if we have to 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:14.410
 lavender jacket 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:16.030
 we eliminate the protections the jacket is 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.920
 guaranteed two years too 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.709
 the waterproofness of the jacket guaranteed 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.660
 for two years 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:26.500
 let's hope I show you the 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:29.139
 speech of the other end point 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.910
 another thermal tip completely 

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:32.829
 removable but we can linear without 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:34.450
 problems 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:37.260
 another clever thing about this jacket 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:40.750
 around here so i'll show you average 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:42.849
 and this is already when we close it in 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.900
 lower part and we raise the zipper in 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:45.609
 traditional way 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.319
 in the lower part, however, there is a second 

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:49.690
 slider that allows us to adjust 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:51.370
 also the fit on some motorcycle types 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:53.380
 it may be useful to be able to open this 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:55.540
 part for not having a jacket that 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:58.840
 face too much in the hips 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:03.579
 what we ask that we can 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:05.799
 hermetically very important to close 

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:06.190
 what a band a jacket under 200 

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:08.019
 EUR 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:10.389
 with all these second features 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:11.290
 me on the market there is above all a 

00:04:10.389 --> 00:04:13.269
