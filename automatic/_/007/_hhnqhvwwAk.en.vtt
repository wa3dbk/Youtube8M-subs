00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:08.970
 even the smallest of all small car 

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:11.990
 dreams of big and only we are ready 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:15.750
 make her dreams of a better life come true 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:21.990
 we pump this baby in an instant 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:25.080
 at liskovo 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:29.240
 blacksmith mechanic lefty to show his 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:32.070
 skill shod mechanical flea 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:34.500
 surprised so surprised but the only 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.350
 the problem all this was useless 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.379
 Galileo decided so to show skill 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:45.379
 before using a flea you need not 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:49.440
 undermining and flea need to tune but 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:51.899
 who can do flea tuning few 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:55.410
 so for tuning we took the most 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:59.180
 real car but by the standards of others 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.329
 machines it is comparable to bad and so 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.510
 tuning 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.850
 fix a tiny car see 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.420
 more carefully and determine which of them there 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.420
 left handed 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:18.909
 if your car is old broken in 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:22.729
 trash compact car it is very sad and 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:26.000
 if you are already 40 years old and from friends 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:28.369
 there is only a familiar auto mechanic 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.509
 so not far away before the crisis average 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:35.030
 age to escape from him mikhail 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:37.609
 decided to remake his wreck in 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:41.299
 exclusive convertible own 

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:43.399
 hands of course it would be better to build 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:46.250
 house to raise a son 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:48.979
 well, or at least plant a tree but 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:52.610
 let's see what comes out of this attempt 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:56.689
 michael will he have a car 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:59.629
 which can be proud of and will help 

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:04.189
 does this desperate man prevent 

00:01:59.629 --> 00:02:06.860
 the onset of troubled times Michael with 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:10.429
 another mechanic removed from the old 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:13.160
 cars absolutely all the details are from 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:17.569
 they men intend to collect the future 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:20.060
 roadster thats all but broken 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:24.040
 bodywork turned out to be the hardest 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:27.069
 away from the old woman her heart engine 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:30.939
 in the mountain mechanics can not 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:34.239
 figure out how he unscrews here 

00:02:30.939 --> 00:02:37.420
 it turns out that this model 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:41.500
 car motor is mounted directly to the rear 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:43.900
 suspension master lucky not have to 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:48.730
 pull over and carry his hands 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:52.180
 and what kind of construction is this skeleton 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:55.799
 future gig iron frame Michael 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:59.109
 with a friend made according to own drawings 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:03:02.139
 on her men install the engine 

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:06.569
 wheels and all other parts that 

00:03:02.139 --> 00:03:06.569
 they removed from the broken subcompact 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:12.380
 with the electrician will have to tinker 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:16.070
 car up to an exclusive scheme 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:18.650
 no wiring for him seems that 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:21.650
 the mechanic is now in the head to relatives 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:24.400
 from mental strain but how 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:27.710
 says eyes are afraid hands do 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.720
 only does it look like trendy 

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:31.700
 cabriolet 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:34.780
 if you put on a stylish case 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:38.060
 from fiberglass it is quite 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:40.700
 This body is made on the sketch Michael 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:43.460
 true he flew him a pretty penny 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:45.430
 but what you will not go to win 

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:48.680
 middle age crisis 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:51.530
 Only here and not plastic color 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:55.700
 happily so the corpus is sent 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:58.970
 paint lab here with it 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:02.870
 literally dust particles blow off all 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:05.420
 went smoothly to start blocker 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:09.230
 will put a primer layer on the body 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:12.230
 so the paint will hold better except 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:16.100
 bright color is better on white base 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:16.940
 manifest itself in order to create this 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:20.270
 shade 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:22.420
 master mixed orange red and yellow 

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:23.990
 colors well and added a bit 

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:28.780
 metal powder 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:31.280
 came out absolutely positive mix for now 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:34.750
 antidepressant body will dry 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:36.590
 perry machine is not suitable 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:39.260
 exclusive convertible car 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:42.260
 drive on wheels from the old wreck 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.800
 so instead of the standard little ones 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.680
 highway 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:47.660
 Michael with a friend put new wide 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:49.400
 alloy wheels 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:52.700
 they are made of alloys based on 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:55.670
 aluminum this will make it easier 

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:57.370
 total car weight and reduce consumption 

00:04:55.670 --> 00:05:00.560
 fuel 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:02.240
 such a measure is simply necessary because 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:05.390
 cabriolet engine 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:08.980
 from small car gravity to him 

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:08.980
 carry contraindicated 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:16.160
 and here it is the long-awaited moment after 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:19.100
 whose ridiculous design should 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:24.080
 find an ultra fashion sport 

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:26.360
 roadster body installation way by the way what 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:29.630
 it is made of fiberglass too 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:31.910
 greatly facilitates the car is true 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:34.699
 this case is not as strong as 

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:37.210
 iron but the strength of this car 

00:05:34.699 --> 00:05:40.940
 attached solid steel frame 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:43.699
 so even in the case of a car crash in 

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:48.500
 accordion does not work out well, you can 

00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:51.770
 start the engine Michael is very proud 

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:55.810
 itself and this is the most important in the fight against 

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:55.810
 the onset of midlife crisis 

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:05.640
 but the story is not finished yet to 

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:08.730
 the creation of Michael could ride through the streets 

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:11.440
 need to conduct a technical examination 

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:14.770
 only after checking the nodes and mechanisms 

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:17.040
 the absence of marriage this gig 

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:22.990
 officially nazyut proud or not 

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:27.570
 car all okay, congratulations 

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:30.670
 and new cars and its creator 

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:33.760
 the ugly caterpillar first turns 

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:35.790
 into a chrysalis and then a butterfly well, 

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:39.270
 old pimped Michael 

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:43.090
 transformed into a luxurious roadster 

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:46.060
 but the most important thing is that a man made him 

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:49.060
 with his own hands the master can be 

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:52.990
 pleased with myself now the crisis of the middle 

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:54.870
 age he is not threatened with an article that it 

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:57.880
 in general is 

00:06:54.870 --> 00:07:01.800
 midlife crisis psychologists 

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:04.530
 called depression in a person summer 30-40 

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:06.370
 it seems that life has passed by 

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:09.490
 opportunities missed 

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:12.340
 and in general the whole world is not nice and it is not 

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:14.950
 cold which will pass in a week 

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:15.780
 such a state may not last one 

00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:18.700
 month 

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:20.800
 however, our hero could do it himself 

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:24.460
 make a unique car 

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:27.430
 so than what is a breakdown here and not 

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:28.270
 it smells yes and the envious glances of others 

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:32.140
 drivers 

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:35.170
 also not bad raise self-esteem Michael 

00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:38.590
 proved to himself and others that from the crisis 

00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:42.000
 middle age is easiest to leave for 

00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:42.000
 homemade car
