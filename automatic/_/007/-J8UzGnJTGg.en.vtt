00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.320
 hello i'm eric of society 

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:06.210
 anywhere any where distributors of 

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:08.839
 computers you are going to you you 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:12.889
 present today the w8 140 and sue 

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:14.070
 double 840 issue is a computer 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:16.650
 ultrabook 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:20.250
 this is a slimline stage range she a 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:23.089
 extremely fine range the thickness and of 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.050
 22m him mm as you can see 

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:27.539
 extremely people too had 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.220
 produces the least chico and that he 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.700
 uses the latest generation of 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.950
 intel processors at sub and q series so 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:39.020
 this series had him for ultra low 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:42.300
 voltage consumes only 15 watts which 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:44.670
 allows the machine to aberdeen omitted from 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.050
 515 revenues of the builders of that 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.130
 represents 9 hours 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:52.020
 it was its use are counted sale 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:54.720
 less is still excellent 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.040
 autonomy and then a machine too that 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.420
 is extremely silent in large 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:03.170
 bath hardly ever 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:08.310
 fans especially because processor 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:11.040
 series such as the scepter 4500 us 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:16.409
 clear the arr trad of temperature 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:19.170
 thanks to his 15 bat as you want 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.450
 see it's a machine of excellent 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.880
 bill play from Thursday in simili relay 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:30.150
 brushed but there is also a plaque in 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:30.870
 brushed aluminum on the lid I 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.010
 will introduce you to 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:33.930
 specificities of the machine 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:36.450
 as you can see on the side 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:41.520
 you have usb ports two usb ports 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:43.430
 3.0 a 1.4 hdmi port that goes out well 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.960
 obviously the same sound reproached 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:49.530
 on a television definition by 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.960
 example a network port and a reader of 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:56.330
 6 in 1 cards that takes the cards sd 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.330
 mini sd xd 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:07.770
 the ventilation is on the other side one 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:11.290
 go there started here is the machine 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:13.150
 starts in a few seconds so you 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:15.610
 have a technology called August 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:21.010
 is crystal clear star technology that allows 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:23.500
 to these is a machine that also has 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:26.410
 the advantage of using an old one which 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.989
 is not your thing that allows you to 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:31.110
 to be able to install another bone than the one 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:35.050
 in which it will be delivered of origin 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:38.200
 we propose with windows 7 a 18 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:42.130
 points now and linux to choose from at 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:45.160
 bout all 13 10 currently or 14 04 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:49.110
 in the near future but I like who 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.110
 bear these three bones are in trouble 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:55.540
 so here as you can see it's 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:58.330
 a mart screen so an anti-glare screen 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:02.470
 otherwise even digital so see me 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:06.280
 this machine exists in hd 1366 by 768 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:07.660
 in HD over 1600 by 900 and in full HD 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:11.019
 1920 1080 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.380
 it is also available in multi option 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:13.720
 touch 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:17.380
 ie the touch screen man who 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:19.860
 can work up to saint laws you 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:23.320
 therefore have as choice of processors 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:29.730
 10.7 maybe 1500 us always 15 what 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:32.019
 is 1 4100 him and y 3 4 10 themes of 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.660
 specificities you are used to me 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:37.840
 I am 16 gigabytes of memory ddr3 llc 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:39.730
 to help at very low consumption 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.140
 the graphics card is the one that is 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:44.780
 integrated in the gpu ie 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:48.190
 4000 they are such a map 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:51.290
 able to display up to three images 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:52.760
 simultaneous ie two other 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:56.480
 screens in addition to the original one 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:58.700
 you have different connectors that I 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:01.840
 have you spoken to before this is to 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:07.100
 say two usb ports 3 1 hdmi that also 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:09.620
 you have an obviously high 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:12.950
 built-in speaker a webcam a microphone 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:18.820
 integrated but also on the side a socket 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:23.300
 for an external microphone and headphones 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:26.419
 you have the opportunity to put in 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:28.430
 different choices 4u girl we we 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:31.100
 propose with the last cards 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:32.960
 wifi from intel to 72.60 who can 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:37.700
 also but up to 800 bédénik or 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:38.990
 just a card 1 135 458 and that's 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:41.270
 a machine that comes with a 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:46.340
 Battery I was saying just now to 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:54.020
 540 minutes of a 44 water and adapter 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:55.430
 sector of 65 watts so we will 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:58.040
 keep a small that the bowels of the 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:59.750
 beast like all machines clevo this 

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:05.180
 are extremely easy machines 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:07.300
 keep some screws to disassemble I do not 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:07.300
 true 

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:16.350
 so after removing the few 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:20.600
 vices or of course withdraws the 

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:22.710
 battery is accessed to the machine 

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:25.440
 so as we can see on this 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:27.480
 model source you have here a 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:28.950
 location or wifi that allows you to 

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:32.100
 put the card of your choice two 

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:35.790
 memory slots ddr3 l2 cold 

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:39.330
 gigas km cjga memory a location here 

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:40.950
 they are 3g be liked it not so 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:43.440
 loved sata and one ssd hard drives 

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:45.350
 ultra fast that now have it will be 

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:48.900
 maybe bigger than a wifi card 

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:51.150
 here you see the cooler of the 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:53.670
 mortar processor by the side the 

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:56.430
 processor is accessed by three screws 

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:59.900
 with club prunes and you have under 

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:59.900
 this hatches the conventional hard drive 

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:04.410
 to push him of your choice 

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:06.810
 it is a machine also for its duration 

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:09.720
 who says it is interesting you have 

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:11.310
 here access to the internal battery stack 

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:13.230
 who keeps the date and time it's 

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:15.720
 islands that must be changed every 

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:17.580
 five years on machines and she's 

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:18.750
 very easily accessible and on 

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:22.430
 some machines it's pretty much 

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:22.430
 inaccessible it is a very good point 

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:34.430
 so to sum up the clevo w800 40 is 

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:38.090
 it's a versatile ultraportable 

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:41.400
 light every Sunday 2 kg 

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:45.830
 excellent autonomy brigil it's 

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:45.830
 really reproduces many 

00:06:51.719 --> 00:06:57.029
 you will find that its model 

00:06:54.099 --> 00:06:57.029
 website
