00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:06.569
 hello girls here is a new video 

00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:08.400
 in this video I want to show you one 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.710
 numbers and white conference art with 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.420
 Micropaint and ring-shaped animal decorations 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.880
 as a white color the requirements e 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.410
 the frost white enamel a gel duties no 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.930
 of passion and a di or a color 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:22.250
 champagne or a gold any color 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.250
 you want is a black acrylic color 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.840
 this is my idea if you like follow it 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:30.300
 the tutorial then first thing me 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.980
 here I have already arrived at the cover ho 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.110
 avoided recording all the passes 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.850
 what do i take the polaris of 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.460
 passion ong that I showed you a little while ago 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.690
 and begins to outline my france up 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.579
 all nails 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.480
 I apologize if I am not very precise though 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:48.890
 I was not in the most comfortable positions I have 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:52.379
 had a bit of trouble this time at 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:54.930
 position my camera I was 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.309
 saying then I outline my French you 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.260
 do not see here that I am not so much 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.960
 precise I have not registered anyway before 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.609
 to catalyze it outlined better with 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.860
 a clean flat brush 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.780
 what I do then outlined mine 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.930
 france on all the nails with the usual ones 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:13.080
 tricks I learned in these 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:16.200
 years play more than side goods 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.840
 would cover in the tip when we look 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.180
 sorry the French above must not 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.650
 being the break between the white is the 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.930
 color of our nail because 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.790
 very ugly to see anyway I was 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.710
 saying once finished to outline 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.320
 my france on all my nails except 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:38.250
 but that for the ring finger is loyal 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:40.200
 lamp for two minutes after 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.600
 catalyzed the francium made of 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.130
 my structure in this way monster monster 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.970
 I didn't register it for questions of 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.130
 time 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.659
 I said I made my bulge 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.100
 therefore also included the ring finger 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.759
 on the ring finger and there is already the structure 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.159
 completed 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:55.950
 what I do I take the white I used 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:58.710
 first for france is they are 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.899
 single color I make a first pass on the 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.040
 my annulare and I repeat also on the other 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.689
 annular 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.159
 once I've covered well sideways 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:07.229
 point as usual leased law 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.209
 lamp two minutes and then make a 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.430
 second always passed with the usual ones 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.880
 tricks that I am going to catalyze 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.990
 one more minute 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.640
 because white being a lot 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:17.590
 pigmented it is better to keep it a little more 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.300
 especially the second pass then the 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.850
 I keep three minutes 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.350
 done this step the buffer over the whole 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:25.180
 nail surface begins with the 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:28.720
 nail art with color to me with the 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:31.270
 a little diluted black color and a brush 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.280
 of the thin tip he created small ones 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:35.260
 macula tour and are on a corner only on 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.670
 just a corner of the French face it 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.430
 on all the arrows except for 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:42.910
 the ring finger, then I show you what 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:44.740
 I'm going to do anyway for the macula tour 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.830
 and as you can see there is no need to 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:50.140
 be very precise indeed less precise 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:54.640
 we are more irregular 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:56.890
 the stains we say is more real 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:01.720
 what to do while on the ring finger I change 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:04.690
 brush I take one of the tip alice in 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:07.060
 cicciotta belly in thin point and created 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:09.880
 these lines that give an effect of 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.440
 lock leave space at the center like 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.240
 you are seeing the brush again 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:16.480
 small that is used for macula tourÃ© 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:18.820
 and I also do them here then I take the don 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.220
 perignon of passion nails that if not 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:23.320
 you still have a classic too good 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:26.590
 today at the wall with the champagne wall 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:31.780
 how do you prefer is I cover my mothers 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:33.850
 specks I made once 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:36.810
 cover all the specks I have 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:39.610
 done on france i also do those 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:42.910
 on the ring finger then I repeat the same accusation 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:44.830
 also on the other hand I also try to 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:46.780
 be the least accurate girls possible 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:50.950
 very little product really is enough 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:53.260
 otherwise it creates a bit of a mess 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:55.600
 so just a pinch is enough 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:58.120
 of this color and locatelli ge lamp 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.950
 for two minutes ended the limit only 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.320
 to seal here on sambo lisi gloss 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:07.030
 always of nail passions I buy well the 

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:09.340
 tip and side is once satisfied 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.900
 catalyzes lamp appearance three minutes 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.390
 minute before degreasing that yes 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:15.100
 cool down and this is my lame idea 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:17.830
 in the high completed 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:19.450
 I hope you like it anyway it's rare 

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:21.070
 I do about melfi White launch 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:24.720
 because I do n't know how to do a lot of things 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:27.550
 extruded white france names never last 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:29.199
 consequently to avoid real risks 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:31.180
 tired of always tend to do 

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:33.039
 special care is this is what it is 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:34.479
 this time he succeeded outside 

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:37.560
 I hope you enjoyed and sent you 

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:37.560
 at the next tutorial hello
