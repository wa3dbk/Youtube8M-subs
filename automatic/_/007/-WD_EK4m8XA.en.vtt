go away and more tanks will be added

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.100 
go away and more tanks will be added
back<00:00:38.700> here<00:00:38.969> we're<00:00:39.090> thinking<00:00:39.329> maybe<00:00:39.450> for<00:00:39.870> more

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
back here we're thinking maybe for more

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.500 
back here we're thinking maybe for more
of<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.379> six<00:00:40.710> rounds<00:00:41.250> I've<00:00:41.969> got<00:00:42.210> some<00:00:42.360> other

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
of the six rounds I've got some other

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.720 
of the six rounds I've got some other
ideas<00:00:42.629> as<00:00:43.110> well<00:00:43.290> and<00:00:44.250> there's<00:00:44.430> our<00:00:44.520> rain

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
ideas as well and there's our rain

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.220 
ideas as well and there's our rain
catchment<00:00:45.000> tank<00:00:45.270> still<00:00:45.660> waiting<00:00:45.930> on<00:00:46.020> us<00:00:46.079> to

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.160 
get a gutter up on the UH neva but again
that<00:00:50.489> tank<00:00:50.820> has<00:00:51.030> absolutely<00:00:51.539> nothing<00:00:51.750> to<00:00:51.960> do

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
that tank has absolutely nothing to do

that tank has absolutely nothing to do
with<00:00:52.379> this<00:00:52.829> system<00:00:53.100> a<00:00:53.489> lot<00:00:54.090> of<00:00:54.180> people<00:00:54.360> seem

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
with this system a lot of people seem

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.080 
with this system a lot of people seem
confused<00:00:54.870> by<00:00:54.960> out<00:00:55.110> in<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.260> first<00:00:55.469> video<00:00:55.910> it<00:00:56.910> is

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
confused by out in the first video it is

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.510 
confused by out in the first video it is
only<00:00:57.300> to<00:00:57.570> provide<00:00:57.750> us<00:00:58.050> water<00:00:58.410> for<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.190> system

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
only to provide us water for the system

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.340 
only to provide us water for the system
it<00:00:59.640> doesn't<00:00:59.940> actually<00:01:00.030> go<00:01:00.359> in<00:01:00.600> it<00:01:01.050> doesn't

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
it doesn't actually go in it doesn't

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.490 
it doesn't actually go in it doesn't
integrate<00:01:01.500> to<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:01.890> system<00:01:02.250> anyway<00:01:03.000> so<00:01:03.500> you

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
integrate to the system anyway so you

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.050 
integrate to the system anyway so you
see<00:01:04.680> we're<00:01:04.799> getting<00:01:04.860> some<00:01:05.070> algae<00:01:05.430> rose<00:01:05.670> it's<00:01:06.000> a

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
see we're getting some algae rose it's a

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.149 
see we're getting some algae rose it's a
big<00:01:06.180> green<00:01:06.420> water<00:01:07.380> is<00:01:07.500> actually<00:01:07.619> crystal

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
big green water is actually crystal

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.649 
big green water is actually crystal
clear<00:01:08.310> if<00:01:08.400> you<00:01:08.460> put<00:01:08.610> in<00:01:08.700> a<00:01:08.760> glass<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.240> algae<00:01:09.600> is

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
clear if you put in a glass the algae is

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.719 
clear if you put in a glass the algae is
growing<00:01:09.960> on<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.170> surfaces<00:01:10.710> that's<00:01:11.549> actually

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
growing on the surfaces that's actually

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.390 
growing on the surfaces that's actually
a<00:01:11.970> sweet<00:01:12.960> potato<00:01:13.290> cutting<00:01:13.650> out<00:01:13.799> of<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:13.979> garden

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
a sweet potato cutting out of the garden

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.249 
a sweet potato cutting out of the garden
that<00:01:14.760> big<00:01:15.000> grassy<00:01:15.450> thing<00:01:15.659> over<00:01:15.930> there<00:01:16.049> it's

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
that big grassy thing over there it's

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.620 
that big grassy thing over there it's
two-foot<00:01:16.500> I<00:01:16.979> pulled<00:01:17.850> some<00:01:18.000> to<00:01:18.360> out<00:01:18.600> of

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
two-foot I pulled some to out of

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.190 
two-foot I pulled some to out of
the<00:01:18.780> garden<00:01:19.200> and<00:01:19.350> these<00:01:20.340> these<00:01:20.549> black

the garden and these these black
containers<00:01:22.200> all<00:01:22.380> we're<00:01:22.560> planning<00:01:22.920> with<00:01:23.009> you

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
containers all we're planning with you

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.289 
containers all we're planning with you
if<00:01:23.189> we're<00:01:23.369> going<00:01:23.460> to<00:01:23.549> see<00:01:23.670> how<00:01:23.729> that<00:01:23.880> does<00:01:23.909> I've

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
if we're going to see how that does I've

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:25.789 
if we're going to see how that does I've
read<00:01:24.509> that<00:01:24.689> it'll<00:01:24.869> grow<00:01:25.080> as<00:01:25.229> an<00:01:25.380> emerging

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
read that it'll grow as an emerging

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.249 
read that it'll grow as an emerging
aquatic<00:01:26.220> plant<00:01:26.490> so<00:01:27.479> we're<00:01:27.689> just<00:01:27.720> kind<00:01:27.990> of<00:01:28.020> play

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
aquatic plant so we're just kind of play

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:29.270 
aquatic plant so we're just kind of play
with<00:01:28.439> that<00:01:28.560> this<00:01:28.770> year<00:01:28.920> now<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.070> good<00:01:29.220> thing

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
with that this year now the good thing

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.620 
with that this year now the good thing
is<00:01:30.170> chupa<00:01:31.400> becomes<00:01:32.400> invasive<00:01:32.759> in<00:01:33.119> some<00:01:33.329> areas

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
is chupa becomes invasive in some areas

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.149 
is chupa becomes invasive in some areas
especially<00:01:33.780> in<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.200> south<00:01:34.409> and<00:01:34.650> tufa<00:01:34.979> gets

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
especially in the south and tufa gets

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.219 
especially in the south and tufa gets
really<00:01:35.460> really<00:01:35.610> dirty<00:01:35.970> and<00:01:36.299> there's<00:01:36.960> little

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
really really dirty and there's little

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.719 
really really dirty and there's little
tubers<00:01:37.650> that<00:01:37.829> you<00:01:37.920> got<00:01:38.100> to<00:01:38.220> get<00:01:38.310> out<00:01:38.340> of<00:01:38.490> it

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
tubers that you got to get out of it

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.880 
tubers that you got to get out of it
well<00:01:39.360> if<00:01:39.509> it's<00:01:39.630> all<00:01:39.780> growing<00:01:40.049> and<00:01:40.259> gravel<00:01:40.680> and

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
well if it's all growing and gravel and

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.569 
well if it's all growing and gravel and
we'll<00:01:41.070> see<00:01:41.250> if<00:01:41.369> that'll<00:01:41.549> work<00:01:43.159> you<00:01:44.159> know<00:01:44.280> when

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
we'll see if that'll work you know when

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:45.920 
we'll see if that'll work you know when
you're<00:01:44.700> ready<00:01:44.820> to<00:01:45.030> harvest<00:01:45.149> your<00:01:45.390> 24<00:01:45.810> you'll

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
you're ready to harvest your 24 you'll

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.450 
you're ready to harvest your 24 you'll
just<00:01:46.079> pull<00:01:46.259> it<00:01:46.380> out<00:01:46.560> don't<00:01:46.590> get<00:01:47.009> water<00:01:47.250> it'll

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
just pull it out don't get water it'll

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.730 
just pull it out don't get water it'll
be<00:01:47.610> clean<00:01:47.850> so<00:01:48.149> we'll<00:01:49.110> see<00:01:49.290> if<00:01:49.320> that<00:01:49.409> works

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
be clean so we'll see if that works

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.109 
be clean so we'll see if that works
we're<00:01:50.189> trying<00:01:50.369> to<00:01:50.490> be<00:01:50.579> a<00:01:50.610> little<00:01:50.759> bit<00:01:50.880> creative

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
we're trying to be a little bit creative

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.510 
we're trying to be a little bit creative
with<00:01:51.329> it<00:01:51.360> so<00:01:51.600> just<00:01:51.840> see<00:01:52.590> how<00:01:52.770> this<00:01:53.009> works<00:01:53.280> right

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
with it so just see how this works right

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:54.889 
with it so just see how this works right
now<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:53.850> trenches<00:01:54.240> are<00:01:54.360> open<00:01:54.600> we're<00:01:54.689> going<00:01:54.810> to

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
now the trenches are open we're going to

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.380 
now the trenches are open we're going to
be<00:01:54.960> putting<00:01:55.140> into<00:01:55.350> them<00:01:55.939> running<00:01:56.939> some<00:01:57.180> power

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
be putting into them running some power

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:58.819 
be putting into them running some power
today<00:01:57.719> it's<00:01:58.110> going<00:01:58.229> to<00:01:58.320> go<00:01:58.439> all<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:58.710> way<00:01:58.740> down

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
today it's going to go all the way down

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.100 
today it's going to go all the way down
there<00:01:59.369> so<00:02:00.240> we've<00:02:00.360> got<00:02:00.450> to<00:02:00.540> cut<00:02:00.689> a<00:02:00.719> little<00:02:00.899> ditch

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
there so we've got to cut a little ditch

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.899 
there so we've got to cut a little ditch
over<00:02:01.350> where<00:02:01.560> those<00:02:01.710> bags<00:02:02.009> of<00:02:02.159> pea<00:02:02.310> gravel<00:02:02.520> are

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
over where those bags of pea gravel are

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.969 
over where those bags of pea gravel are
so<00:02:03.509> you<00:02:03.630> run<00:02:03.780> our<00:02:03.869> electrical<00:02:04.320> conduit<00:02:04.710> will

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
so you run our electrical conduit will

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.789 
so you run our electrical conduit will
have<00:02:05.100> a<00:02:05.630> outdoor<00:02:06.630> rated<00:02:07.110> box<00:02:07.320> mounted<00:02:07.680> there

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
have a outdoor rated box mounted there

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.430 
have a outdoor rated box mounted there
on<00:02:07.890> that<00:02:08.039> wall<00:02:08.069> with<00:02:08.910> a<00:02:09.030> switch<00:02:09.300> that<00:02:09.629> can<00:02:10.229> turn

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
on that wall with a switch that can turn

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.010 
on that wall with a switch that can turn
on<00:02:10.649> and<00:02:10.800> off

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
on and off

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.180 
on and off
power<00:02:13.020> that<00:02:13.290> will<00:02:13.410> be<00:02:13.500> run<00:02:13.710> down<00:02:13.890> there<00:02:14.130> and

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
power that will be run down there and

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.560 
power that will be run down there and
analysis<00:02:14.910> down<00:02:15.090> there<00:02:15.300> as<00:02:15.420> well<00:02:17.480> but<00:02:18.480> right

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
analysis down there as well but right

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.060 
analysis down there as well but right
now<00:02:18.720> the<00:02:18.780> ditch<00:02:19.020> is<00:02:19.050> open<00:02:19.530> so<00:02:19.650> it's<00:02:19.770> good<00:02:19.920> so

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
now the ditch is open so it's good so

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.040 
now the ditch is open so it's good so
you<00:02:20.160> can<00:02:20.280> see<00:02:20.460> everything<00:02:20.880> that's<00:02:21.050> what's

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
you can see everything that's what's

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.620 
you can see everything that's what's
going<00:02:22.260> on<00:02:23.000> so<00:02:24.000> you<00:02:24.090> can<00:02:24.210> see<00:02:24.300> this<00:02:24.420> is

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
going on so you can see this is

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.510 
going on so you can see this is
basically<00:02:25.050> a<00:02:25.170> hose<00:02:25.380> bib<00:02:25.740> it's<00:02:25.950> plumbed<00:02:26.250> with

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
basically a hose bib it's plumbed with

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.660 
basically a hose bib it's plumbed with
three<00:02:26.940> quarter<00:02:27.240> pipe<00:02:27.950> that<00:02:28.950> pipe<00:02:29.190> goes<00:02:29.430> all

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
three quarter pipe that pipe goes all

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.070 
three quarter pipe that pipe goes all
the<00:02:29.900> way<00:02:30.900> down<00:02:31.260> to<00:02:31.710> that<00:02:32.340> first<00:02:32.550> tank<00:02:33.080> it

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
the way down to that first tank it

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.940 
the way down to that first tank it
brings<00:02:34.320> water<00:02:34.590> up<00:02:34.860> here<00:02:34.890> from<00:02:35.190> the<00:02:35.280> pump<00:02:35.520> a

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
brings water up here from the pump a

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.020 
brings water up here from the pump a
piece<00:02:37.950> of<00:02:37.980> three<00:02:38.280> quarter<00:02:38.610> down<00:02:38.760> there

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
piece of three quarter down there

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.250 
piece of three quarter down there
screwed<00:02:39.390> into<00:02:39.510> the<00:02:39.660> bottom<00:02:39.870> of<00:02:39.900> that<00:02:40.020> stock

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
screwed into the bottom of that stock

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.500 
screwed into the bottom of that stock
tank<00:02:40.530> comes<00:02:40.740> up<00:02:40.920> and<00:02:41.130> over<00:02:41.460> and<00:02:41.670> the<00:02:42.300> height<00:02:42.480> of

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
tank comes up and over and the height of

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.080 
tank comes up and over and the height of
this<00:02:42.750> pipe<00:02:43.050> right<00:02:43.260> here<00:02:43.460> sets<00:02:44.460> the<00:02:44.670> level<00:02:45.000> of

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
this pipe right here sets the level of

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.610 
this pipe right here sets the level of
this<00:02:45.240> tank<00:02:45.510> right<00:02:45.780> back<00:02:45.990> here<00:02:46.290> if<00:02:46.380> we<00:02:46.470> want

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
this tank right back here if we want

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.980 
this tank right back here if we want
that<00:02:46.850> higher<00:02:47.850> we<00:02:48.090> could<00:02:48.240> put<00:02:48.360> a<00:02:48.390> long<00:02:48.600> little

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:48.990 
that higher we could put a long little

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:50.870 
that higher we could put a long little
piece<00:02:49.110> of<00:02:49.260> extension<00:02:49.710> their<00:02:49.860> finest<00:02:50.610> I<00:02:50.700> don't

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
piece of extension their finest I don't

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.100 
piece of extension their finest I don't
want<00:02:51.000> to<00:02:51.060> hold<00:02:51.120> a<00:02:51.270> little<00:02:51.450> less<00:02:51.570> water<00:02:51.870> back

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
want to hold a little less water back

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.970 
want to hold a little less water back
there<00:02:54.140> right<00:02:55.140> there<00:02:55.350> I'll<00:02:55.470> hold<00:02:55.620> about<00:02:55.830> an

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
there right there I'll hold about an

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.000 
there right there I'll hold about an
inch<00:02:56.100> less<00:02:56.310> water<00:02:56.610> I<00:02:56.990> am<00:02:57.990> in<00:02:58.170> the<00:02:58.410> rear<00:02:58.560> tank<00:02:58.800> so

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
inch less water I am in the rear tank so

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.050 
inch less water I am in the rear tank so
it's<00:02:59.160> that<00:02:59.340> simple<00:02:59.640> I<00:03:00.030> have<00:03:00.840> too<00:03:00.990> much<00:03:01.020> flow<00:03:01.410> I

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
it's that simple I have too much flow I

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.600 
it's that simple I have too much flow I
can<00:03:03.060> either<00:03:03.180> increase<00:03:03.420> or<00:03:03.830> decrease<00:03:04.830> my<00:03:05.340> flow

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
can either increase or decrease my flow

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.610 
can either increase or decrease my flow
rate<00:03:05.910> real<00:03:06.420> simple<00:03:06.660> with<00:03:06.840> a<00:03:06.960> husband<00:03:07.380> it

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
rate real simple with a husband it

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.740 
rate real simple with a husband it
couldn't<00:03:07.920> be<00:03:07.950> really<00:03:08.280> more<00:03:08.490> simple<00:03:09.260> over<00:03:10.260> here

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
couldn't be really more simple over here

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.530 
couldn't be really more simple over here
this<00:03:12.750> pipe<00:03:12.990> sits<00:03:13.050> the<00:03:13.500> level<00:03:13.800> of<00:03:13.860> this<00:03:14.070> tank

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
this pipe sits the level of this tank

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.060 
this pipe sits the level of this tank
it's<00:03:15.540> just<00:03:15.720> a<00:03:15.840> little<00:03:16.020> piece<00:03:16.170> of<00:03:16.320> PVC<00:03:16.500> with<00:03:17.010> a

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
it's just a little piece of PVC with a

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:19.790 
it's just a little piece of PVC with a
bunch<00:03:17.250> of<00:03:17.400> holes<00:03:17.610> drilled<00:03:18.030> in<00:03:18.150> it<00:03:18.300> I<00:03:19.140> have<00:03:19.770> a

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:19.800 
bunch of holes drilled in it I have a

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.470 
bunch of holes drilled in it I have a
concern<00:03:20.070> that<00:03:20.460> leaves<00:03:20.640> could<00:03:20.940> clog<00:03:21.150> it<00:03:21.330> so<00:03:21.450> I

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
concern that leaves could clog it so I

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.690 
concern that leaves could clog it so I
have<00:03:21.660> a<00:03:21.690> plan<00:03:22.050> to<00:03:22.380> build<00:03:22.710> basically<00:03:23.160> a<00:03:23.340> small

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
have a plan to build basically a small

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.380 
have a plan to build basically a small
box<00:03:24.260> using<00:03:25.260> 90<00:03:25.680> degrees<00:03:26.040> that<00:03:26.880> way<00:03:27.060> the<00:03:27.210> holes

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
box using 90 degrees that way the holes

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.270 
box using 90 degrees that way the holes
on<00:03:27.600> the<00:03:27.720> inside<00:03:28.170> will<00:03:28.410> never<00:03:28.620> clog<00:03:28.890> up<00:03:29.100> from

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
on the inside will never clog up from

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.010 
on the inside will never clog up from
leaves<00:03:29.490> connecting<00:03:30.150> from<00:03:30.240> the<00:03:30.390> outside<00:03:30.810> one

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:31.020 
leaves connecting from the outside one

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:33.380 
leaves connecting from the outside one
plenty<00:03:31.200> of<00:03:31.290> drainage<00:03:31.710> there<00:03:31.920> that<00:03:32.820> comes<00:03:33.150> out

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
plenty of drainage there that comes out

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:39.920 
plenty of drainage there that comes out
there<00:03:35.240> runs<00:03:36.240> all<00:03:36.510> the<00:03:36.540> way<00:03:36.690> down<00:03:37.050> and<00:03:38.930> that

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
there runs all the way down and that

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.450 
there runs all the way down and that
pipe<00:03:40.170> it<00:03:40.320> comes<00:03:40.470> out<00:03:40.560> of<00:03:40.620> the<00:03:40.710> bottom<00:03:41.040> of<00:03:41.130> that

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:41.460 
pipe it comes out of the bottom of that

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:47.450 
pipe it comes out of the bottom of that
tank<00:03:41.700> up<00:03:41.850> there<00:03:42.060> actually<00:03:42.510> goes<00:03:42.720> into<00:03:46.460> the

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:47.460 
tank up there actually goes into the

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:48.920 
tank up there actually goes into the
bottom<00:03:47.610> of<00:03:47.850> that<00:03:48.000> tank<00:03:48.240> down<00:03:48.450> there<00:03:48.660> it's<00:03:48.810> the

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
bottom of that tank down there it's the

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.340 
bottom of that tank down there it's the
lower<00:03:49.140> pipe<00:03:49.560> so<00:03:50.450> because<00:03:51.450> this<00:03:51.690> pond<00:03:51.960> is<00:03:51.990> lower

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
lower pipe so because this pond is lower

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:57.530 
lower pipe so because this pond is lower
than<00:03:52.620> that<00:03:52.830> pond<00:03:55.760> the<00:03:56.760> water<00:03:57.000> just<00:03:57.240> flows

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
than that pond the water just flows

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.660 
than that pond the water just flows
downhill<00:03:57.870> I<00:03:58.410> mean<00:03:58.860> if<00:03:59.010> that's<00:03:59.250> all<00:03:59.460> there<00:03:59.640> is

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
downhill I mean if that's all there is

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.960 
downhill I mean if that's all there is
to<00:03:59.790> it<00:04:00.000> and<00:04:00.500> then<00:04:01.500> the<00:04:01.620> pump<00:04:01.890> recirculates<00:04:02.850> it

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
to it and then the pump recirculates it

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:04.460 
to it and then the pump recirculates it
back<00:04:03.150> up<00:04:03.360> and<00:04:03.540> that<00:04:03.660> hose<00:04:03.840> bib<00:04:04.080> right<00:04:04.260> there

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
back up and that hose bib right there

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:08.000 
back up and that hose bib right there
this<00:04:04.650> is<00:04:04.740> just<00:04:05.160> to<00:04:06.030> provide<00:04:06.330> some<00:04:06.600> oxygen<00:04:07.020> and

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
this is just to provide some oxygen and

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:09.500 
this is just to provide some oxygen and
you<00:04:08.130> can<00:04:08.250> see<00:04:08.400> we<00:04:08.520> threw<00:04:08.700> a<00:04:08.730> couple<00:04:08.940> ornamental

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
you can see we threw a couple ornamental

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:12.470 
you can see we threw a couple ornamental
sweet<00:04:09.720> potatoes<00:04:10.170> down<00:04:10.650> here<00:04:11.190> some<00:04:12.120> more<00:04:12.270> pots

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
sweet potatoes down here some more pots

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.630 
sweet potatoes down here some more pots
and<00:04:12.780> cheaper<00:04:13.080> there<00:04:13.230> some<00:04:13.490> submerged<00:04:14.490> aquatic

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 
and cheaper there some submerged aquatic

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:19.010 
and cheaper there some submerged aquatic
plants<00:04:15.270> there<00:04:16.070> there's<00:04:17.070> a<00:04:17.510> gold<00:04:18.510> fish<00:04:18.750> in<00:04:18.930> the

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:19.020 
plants there there's a gold fish in the

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:20.300 
plants there there's a gold fish in the
tank<00:04:19.049> but<00:04:19.440> there<00:04:19.560> probably<00:04:19.770> there's<00:04:20.040> a<00:04:20.100> couple

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
tank but there probably there's a couple

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:22.909 
tank but there probably there's a couple
you<00:04:20.520> can<00:04:20.669> see<00:04:20.850> right<00:04:20.880> back<00:04:21.330> there<00:04:21.600> and<00:04:22.590> up<00:04:22.770> in

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 
you can see right back there and up in

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:25.629 
you can see right back there and up in
this<00:04:23.040> tank<00:04:23.310> here<00:04:23.610> we<00:04:23.760> have<00:04:23.910> some<00:04:24.090> pond<00:04:24.330> meadows

00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:25.639 
this tank here we have some pond meadows

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:28.459 
this tank here we have some pond meadows
those<00:04:26.639> I<00:04:26.819> can<00:04:26.969> probably<00:04:27.180> show<00:04:27.689> you<00:04:27.749> I<00:04:28.139> don't

00:04:28.459 --> 00:04:28.469 
those I can probably show you I don't

00:04:28.469 --> 00:04:29.839 
those I can probably show you I don't
know<00:04:28.530> if<00:04:28.620> they'll<00:04:28.740> show<00:04:28.919> up<00:04:29.099> on<00:04:29.310> the<00:04:29.430> camera

00:04:29.839 --> 00:04:29.849 
know if they'll show up on the camera

00:04:29.849 --> 00:04:32.179 
know if they'll show up on the camera
though<00:04:30.030> but<00:04:30.210> there's<00:04:30.419> a<00:04:30.710> quite<00:04:31.710> a<00:04:31.740> few<00:04:31.979> of<00:04:32.009> them

00:04:32.179 --> 00:04:32.189 
though but there's a quite a few of them

00:04:32.189 --> 00:04:34.850 
though but there's a quite a few of them
right<00:04:32.310> in<00:04:32.490> there<00:04:32.699> and<00:04:33.020> they<00:04:34.020> they<00:04:34.439> like<00:04:34.469> cruise

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
right in there and they they like cruise

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.909 
right in there and they they like cruise
in<00:04:35.009> and<00:04:35.129> out<00:04:35.249> of<00:04:35.279> the<00:04:35.550> pot<00:04:35.969> so<00:04:36.560> that's<00:04:37.560> it<00:04:37.740> so

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:37.919 
in and out of the pot so that's it so

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:39.409 
in and out of the pot so that's it so
far<00:04:37.949> again<00:04:38.490> will<00:04:38.639> extend<00:04:38.849> the<00:04:38.969> system<00:04:39.330> back

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:39.419 
far again will extend the system back

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:42.050 
far again will extend the system back
that<00:04:39.719> way<00:04:40.009> the<00:04:41.009> next<00:04:41.249> row<00:04:41.370> of<00:04:41.490> Tanks<00:04:41.819> will<00:04:41.939> have

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
that way the next row of Tanks will have

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:43.790 
that way the next row of Tanks will have
to<00:04:42.210> be<00:04:42.330> at<00:04:42.419> least<00:04:42.569> as<00:04:42.749> high<00:04:42.900> as<00:04:43.080> this<00:04:43.289> tank<00:04:43.590> and

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:43.800 
to be at least as high as this tank and

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:44.839 
to be at least as high as this tank and
we're<00:04:43.889> probably<00:04:44.069> going<00:04:44.249> to<00:04:44.340> do<00:04:44.460> a<00:04:44.490> little<00:04:44.699> bit

00:04:44.839 --> 00:04:44.849 
we're probably going to do a little bit

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:47.149 
we're probably going to do a little bit
higher<00:04:45.060> and<00:04:45.330> let<00:04:45.479> them<00:04:45.629> drain<00:04:46.529> down<00:04:46.800> so<00:04:47.069> we'll

00:04:47.149 --> 00:04:47.159 
higher and let them drain down so we'll

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:49.309 
higher and let them drain down so we'll
create<00:04:47.340> another<00:04:47.610> another<00:04:48.319> service

00:04:49.309 --> 00:04:49.319 
create another another service

00:04:49.319 --> 00:04:51.320 
create another another service
disturbance<00:04:49.889> and<00:04:50.069> now<00:04:50.909> we're<00:04:51.060> thinking<00:04:51.270> about

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.330 
disturbance and now we're thinking about

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:52.550 
disturbance and now we're thinking about
doing<00:04:51.479> that<00:04:51.719> rather<00:04:51.930> than<00:04:52.020> conventional

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:52.560 
doing that rather than conventional

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.010 
doing that rather than conventional
flushing<00:04:52.830> train<00:04:52.979> aquaponics<00:04:53.639> because<00:04:53.939> if<00:04:54.870> you

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.020 
flushing train aquaponics because if you

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:56.269 
flushing train aquaponics because if you
take<00:04:55.050> tanks<00:04:55.529> all<00:04:55.650> the<00:04:55.740> way<00:04:55.830> back<00:04:55.979> to<00:04:56.039> that

00:04:56.269 --> 00:04:56.279 
take tanks all the way back to that

00:04:56.279 --> 00:04:57.649 
take tanks all the way back to that
motor<00:04:56.520> screw<00:04:56.759> back<00:04:56.909> there<00:04:57.090> I<00:04:57.120> can<00:04:57.330> put<00:04:57.449> it<00:04:57.539> in

00:04:57.649 --> 00:04:57.659 
motor screw back there I can put it in

00:04:57.659 --> 00:05:01.100 
motor screw back there I can put it in
another<00:04:58.250> instead<00:04:59.250> of<00:04:59.400> a<00:04:59.460> two-by-six<00:05:00.110> circle

another instead of a two-by-six circle
tank<00:05:01.289> I<00:05:01.349> can<00:05:01.500> do<00:05:01.590> a<00:05:01.620> 2<00:05:01.800> by<00:05:01.949> 8<00:05:02.129> back<00:05:02.340> there<00:05:02.610> and<00:05:03.270> we

tank I can do a 2 by 8 back there and we

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:05.179 
tank I can do a 2 by 8 back there and we
push<00:05:03.599> that<00:05:03.750> whole<00:05:04.020> system<00:05:04.469> then<00:05:04.650> up<00:05:04.830> to<00:05:04.979> about

00:05:05.179 --> 00:05:05.189 
push that whole system then up to about

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:09.800 
this is the more stable it becomes and
