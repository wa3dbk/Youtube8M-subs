and you can tell me if one seems
different<00:00:20.100> than<00:00:20.369> the<00:00:20.460> other<00:00:20.580> when<00:00:21.240> it's

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
different than the other when it's

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.890 
different than the other when it's
applied<00:00:21.990> in<00:00:22.260> application<00:00:23.330> first<00:00:24.330> up<00:00:24.510> then<00:00:24.689> is

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
applied in application first up then is

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.839 
applied in application first up then is
drawing<00:00:25.380> with<00:00:25.680> a<00:00:25.949> tablet<00:00:26.220> so<00:00:26.460> I'm<00:00:26.550> going<00:00:26.670> to<00:00:26.699> do

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
drawing with a tablet so I'm going to do

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.640 
drawing with a tablet so I'm going to do
something<00:00:27.119> quick<00:00:27.330> and<00:00:27.449> simple<00:00:27.599> like<00:00:28.439> an

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
something quick and simple like an

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:36.050 
something quick and simple like an
eyeball<00:00:29.179> so<00:00:30.179> going<00:00:30.510> to<00:00:30.570> get<00:00:30.660> started<00:00:31.019> here

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:36.060 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:42.330 

right<00:00:36.450> so<00:00:36.750> there's<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:37.080> first<00:00:37.200> part

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:42.340 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:44.670 

and<00:00:42.460> right<00:00:43.060> now<00:00:43.150> i'm<00:00:43.270> using<00:00:43.300> a<00:00:43.630> cintiq<00:00:44.110> so<00:00:44.560> i'm

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:44.680 
and right now i'm using a cintiq so i'm

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.680 
and right now i'm using a cintiq so i'm
actually<00:00:44.860> drawing<00:00:45.310> right<00:00:45.970> on<00:00:46.180> the<00:00:46.480> screen

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:46.690 
actually drawing right on the screen

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.229 
actually drawing right on the screen
rather<00:00:47.020> than<00:00:47.670> separately<00:00:48.670> but<00:00:48.910> you<00:00:49.000> can<00:00:49.120> also

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:49.239 
rather than separately but you can also

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:51.300 
rather than separately but you can also
do<00:00:49.420> within<00:00:49.630> 2<00:00:49.810> o's<00:00:49.989> a<00:00:50.260> little<00:00:51.010> bit<00:00:51.100> harder

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:51.310 
do within 2 o's a little bit harder

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:53.130 
do within 2 o's a little bit harder
within<00:00:51.520> to<00:00:51.670> us<00:00:51.790> because<00:00:52.000> you're<00:00:52.809> drawing<00:00:52.989> on

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:53.140 
within to us because you're drawing on

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.560 
within to us because you're drawing on
the<00:00:53.170> tablet<00:00:53.650> but<00:00:53.770> then<00:00:53.920> you<00:00:54.010> have<00:00:54.190> to<00:00:54.220> look<00:00:54.640> at

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:55.570 
the tablet but then you have to look at

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:02.250 
the tablet but then you have to look at
the<00:00:56.020> screen

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:02.260 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:03.869 

because<00:01:02.769> the<00:01:02.829> tap<00:01:03.039> it's<00:01:03.219> not<00:01:03.339> attached<00:01:03.579> to<00:01:03.789> the

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:03.879 
because the tap it's not attached to the

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:05.280 
because the tap it's not attached to the
screen<00:01:04.089> with<00:01:04.180> into<00:01:04.449> it<00:01:04.570> so<00:01:04.720> it's<00:01:04.839> actually<00:01:05.080> I

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:05.290 
screen with into it so it's actually I

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:07.620 
screen with into it so it's actually I
think<00:01:05.350> it's<00:01:05.590> a<00:01:05.650> bit<00:01:05.799> harder<00:01:06.250> with<00:01:07.210> an<00:01:07.390> end<00:01:07.509> to

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:07.630 
think it's a bit harder with an end to

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.170 
think it's a bit harder with an end to
us<00:01:07.659> to<00:01:07.930> be<00:01:08.020> honest<00:01:08.759> cintiq<00:01:09.759> feels<00:01:10.000> more

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:10.180 
us to be honest cintiq feels more

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:11.580 
us to be honest cintiq feels more
natural<00:01:10.240> like<00:01:10.689> your<00:01:10.810> drawing<00:01:10.960> right<00:01:11.259> on<00:01:11.439> the

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.590 
natural like your drawing right on the

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:36.560 
natural like your drawing right on the
screen<00:01:11.770> itself

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.120 

I'm<00:01:37.110> doing<00:01:37.350> this<00:01:37.409> as<00:01:37.590> fast<00:01:37.800> as<00:01:38.040> possible

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
I'm doing this as fast as possible

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.469 
I'm doing this as fast as possible
because<00:01:38.610> i<00:01:38.729> don't<00:01:38.850> want<00:01:38.880> to<00:01:39.060> spend<00:01:39.300> too<00:01:39.330> much

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
because i don't want to spend too much

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.090 
because i don't want to spend too much
time<00:01:39.540> on<00:01:39.780> each<00:01:39.990> one<00:01:40.260> but<00:01:40.530> just<00:01:40.650> want<00:01:40.860> to<00:01:40.920> show

right so both we're done very very
quickly<00:02:58.560> it's<00:02:59.560> not<00:02:59.650> the<00:02:59.799> best<00:02:59.920> artwork<00:03:00.190> i<00:03:00.430> just

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
quickly it's not the best artwork i just

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.059 
quickly it's not the best artwork i just
wanted<00:03:00.849> to<00:03:00.879> demonstrate<00:03:01.440> you<00:03:02.440> know<00:03:02.560> drawling

00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:03.069 
wanted to demonstrate you know drawling

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:05.910 
wanted to demonstrate you know drawling
quickly<00:03:03.879> on<00:03:04.000> both<00:03:04.720> mediums<00:03:05.500> hope<00:03:05.620> you<00:03:05.709> can<00:03:05.799> see

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
quickly on both mediums hope you can see

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.789 
quickly on both mediums hope you can see
both<00:03:06.040> of<00:03:06.099> those<00:03:06.310> so<00:03:06.610> I<00:03:06.819> think<00:03:07.629> that<00:03:08.080> actually

00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:08.799 
both of those so I think that actually

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:10.710 
both of those so I think that actually
sometimes<00:03:09.519> the<00:03:09.700> cintiq<00:03:10.030> is<00:03:10.120> harder<00:03:10.510> cuz<00:03:10.629> it

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
sometimes the cintiq is harder cuz it

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.240 
sometimes the cintiq is harder cuz it
just<00:03:10.840> doesn't<00:03:11.110> feel<00:03:11.260> as<00:03:11.440> natural<00:03:11.590> as<00:03:12.040> the

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
just doesn't feel as natural as the

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.880 
just doesn't feel as natural as the
pencil<00:03:12.700> but<00:03:13.450> you<00:03:13.840> know<00:03:13.930> pencil<00:03:14.319> drawing<00:03:14.620> still

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
pencil but you know pencil drawing still

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.009 
pencil but you know pencil drawing still
feels<00:03:15.159> really<00:03:15.940> good<00:03:16.120> you<00:03:16.510> know<00:03:16.629> so<00:03:16.810> I<00:03:16.840> like

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:17.019 
feels really good you know so I like

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:19.170 
feels really good you know so I like
doing<00:03:17.200> both<00:03:17.470> it<00:03:17.620> just<00:03:17.799> depends<00:03:18.190> on<00:03:18.310> you<00:03:19.060> know

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
doing both it just depends on you know

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.660 
doing both it just depends on you know
what<00:03:19.390> kind<00:03:19.720> of<00:03:19.920> all<00:03:20.920> right<00:03:21.010> so<00:03:21.190> now<00:03:21.310> it's<00:03:21.459> time

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 
what kind of all right so now it's time

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:24.059 
what kind of all right so now it's time
to<00:03:21.819> you<00:03:21.909> time<00:03:22.390> for<00:03:22.569> you<00:03:22.629> to<00:03:22.659> vote<00:03:22.900> we<00:03:23.860> know<00:03:23.920> what

00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:24.069 
to you time for you to vote we know what

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:26.190 
to you time for you to vote we know what
is<00:03:24.220> considered<00:03:24.610> artwork<00:03:25.209> it<00:03:25.480> is<00:03:25.629> working<00:03:25.900> with

is considered artwork it is working with

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.069 
is considered artwork it is working with
a<00:03:26.409> tablet<00:03:26.950> artwork<00:03:27.400> and<00:03:27.610> consider<00:03:28.299> you<00:03:29.049> know

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:29.079 
a tablet artwork and consider you know

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:33.000 
a tablet artwork and consider you know
if<00:03:29.230> I<00:03:29.349> have<00:03:29.590> to<00:03:29.799> draw<00:03:30.099> the<00:03:31.410> mechanics<00:03:32.410> that<00:03:32.620> I'm

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
if I have to draw the mechanics that I'm

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.009 
if I have to draw the mechanics that I'm
doing<00:03:33.250> to<00:03:33.340> do<00:03:33.430> that<00:03:33.670> to<00:03:34.180> make<00:03:34.299> those<00:03:34.510> lines<00:03:34.810> the

doing to do that to make those lines the

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:37.680 
doing to do that to make those lines the
way<00:03:35.109> they<00:03:35.260> look<00:03:35.970> I'm<00:03:36.970> turning<00:03:37.390> at<00:03:37.450> a<00:03:37.480> psycho

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:37.690 
way they look I'm turning at a psycho

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:40.020 
way they look I'm turning at a psycho

was<00:03:40.239> working<00:03:40.989> traditionally<00:03:41.650> here<00:03:43.019> it's<00:03:44.019> the

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:44.140 
was working traditionally here it's the

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:45.930 
was working traditionally here it's the
same<00:03:44.409> mechanics<00:03:45.129> I'm<00:03:45.340> not<00:03:45.489> doing<00:03:45.760> anything

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:45.940 
same mechanics I'm not doing anything

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.089 
same mechanics I'm not doing anything
different<00:03:46.510> you<00:03:47.109> know<00:03:47.200> I'm<00:03:47.260> having<00:03:47.560> to<00:03:47.680> do<00:03:47.950> the

00:03:48.089 --> 00:03:48.099 
different you know I'm having to do the

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:50.880 
different you know I'm having to do the
same<00:03:48.340> exact<00:03:48.760> strokes<00:03:49.319> in<00:03:50.319> order<00:03:50.620> to<00:03:50.799> achieve

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:50.890 
same exact strokes in order to achieve

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:53.430 
same exact strokes in order to achieve
in<00:03:51.400> result<00:03:51.849> and<00:03:52.180> I<00:03:52.750> would<00:03:52.900> actually<00:03:52.959> say<00:03:53.200> a

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.440 
in result and I would actually say a

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.430 
in result and I would actually say a
pencil<00:03:53.920> is<00:03:53.980> easier<00:03:54.280> to<00:03:54.340> get<00:03:54.670> the<00:03:55.359> light<00:03:55.959> stroke

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440 
pencil is easier to get the light stroke

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.610 
pencil is easier to get the light stroke
thin<00:03:56.819> darker<00:03:57.819> stroke<00:03:58.120> thick<00:03:58.420> that's<00:03:59.260> easier

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
thin darker stroke thick that's easier

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.800 
thin darker stroke thick that's easier
traditionally<00:04:00.190> and<00:04:01.000> also<00:04:01.329> the<00:04:01.419> shade<00:04:01.660> is

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
traditionally and also the shade is

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.020 
traditionally and also the shade is
easier<00:04:02.200> if<00:04:02.560> you<00:04:02.650> want<00:04:02.829> to<00:04:02.889> get<00:04:03.040> that<00:04:03.069> certain

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
easier if you want to get that certain

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:05.430 
easier if you want to get that certain
type<00:04:04.180> of<00:04:04.209> pencil<00:04:04.630> shading<00:04:04.780> let's<00:04:05.109> say<00:04:05.260> I<00:04:05.290> want

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440 
type of pencil shading let's say I want

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.770 
type of pencil shading let's say I want
to<00:04:05.470> start<00:04:05.650> really<00:04:05.889> light<00:04:06.359> I'm<00:04:07.359> gonna<00:04:07.540> start

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
to start really light I'm gonna start

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.020 
to start really light I'm gonna start
getting<00:04:07.989> darker<00:04:08.290> now<00:04:08.440> and<00:04:08.760> darker<00:04:09.760> and<00:04:09.940> darker

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
getting darker now and darker and darker

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:12.300 
getting darker now and darker and darker
and<00:04:10.419> darker<00:04:10.540> and<00:04:10.870> darker<00:04:11.019> and<00:04:11.349> darker<00:04:11.470> that's

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
and darker and darker and darker that's

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:15.089 
and darker and darker and darker that's
much<00:04:12.549> easier<00:04:12.579> to<00:04:12.970> do<00:04:13.180> with<00:04:13.900> a<00:04:13.930> pencil<00:04:14.680> than<00:04:15.010> it

00:04:15.089 --> 00:04:15.099 
much easier to do with a pencil than it

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:17.129 
much easier to do with a pencil than it
is<00:04:15.250> this<00:04:15.879> but<00:04:16.060> the<00:04:16.150> mechanics<00:04:16.630> keep<00:04:16.810> in<00:04:16.930> mind

00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:17.139 
is this but the mechanics keep in mind

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:19.440 
is this but the mechanics keep in mind
before<00:04:17.410> you<00:04:17.560> vote<00:04:18.030> mechanics<00:04:19.030> are<00:04:19.150> the<00:04:19.239> same

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:19.450 
before you vote mechanics are the same

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:22.529 
before you vote mechanics are the same
so<00:04:19.750> I<00:04:19.930> wanted<00:04:20.500> to<00:04:20.620> go<00:04:20.769> light<00:04:21.459> light<00:04:21.820> light<00:04:21.849> you

00:04:22.529 --> 00:04:22.539 
so I wanted to go light light light you

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:24.480 
so I wanted to go light light light you
know<00:04:22.660> and<00:04:22.960> gradually<00:04:23.800> get<00:04:23.950> darker<00:04:24.310> and<00:04:24.430> darker

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:24.490 
know and gradually get darker and darker

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:26.750 
know and gradually get darker and darker
and<00:04:24.910> darker<00:04:25.030> and<00:04:25.330> darker

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 
and darker and darker

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.570 
and darker and darker
the<00:04:27.300> mechanics<00:04:27.840> are<00:04:28.020> the<00:04:28.530> same<00:04:28.770> what<00:04:29.490> I'm

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
the mechanics are the same what I'm

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.340 
the mechanics are the same what I'm
doing<00:04:29.910> with<00:04:30.030> my<00:04:30.090> hand<00:04:30.840> everything<00:04:31.080> is<00:04:31.230> so

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:31.350 
doing with my hand everything is so

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:32.720 
doing with my hand everything is so
different<00:04:31.380> and<00:04:31.770> if<00:04:31.860> i<00:04:31.950> was<00:04:32.130> using<00:04:32.280> into<00:04:32.610> it

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:32.730 
different and if i was using into it

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:34.550 
different and if i was using into it
it's<00:04:32.880> no<00:04:32.970> different<00:04:33.210> only<00:04:33.540> difference<00:04:34.230> in<00:04:34.320> to

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
it's no different only difference in to

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:35.870 
it's no different only difference in to
us<00:04:34.680> and<00:04:34.860> this<00:04:34.950> is<00:04:35.190> that<00:04:35.370> instead<00:04:35.640> of<00:04:35.760> drawing

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:35.880 
us and this is that instead of drawing

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:37.820 
us and this is that instead of drawing
directly<00:04:36.090> on<00:04:36.390> the<00:04:36.450> screen<00:04:36.600> I'm<00:04:37.260> Jonah<00:04:37.680> a

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
directly on the screen I'm Jonah a

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:40.100 
directly on the screen I'm Jonah a
tablet<00:04:38.550> that<00:04:38.610> has<00:04:38.670> nothing<00:04:39.000> on<00:04:39.120> it<00:04:39.180> and<00:04:39.450> I<00:04:39.840> see

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.110 
tablet that has nothing on it and I see

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:41.900 
tablet that has nothing on it and I see
on<00:04:40.260> the<00:04:40.380> screen<00:04:40.470> what<00:04:40.890> I'm<00:04:40.980> doing<00:04:41.280> that<00:04:41.700> takes

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:41.910 
on the screen what I'm doing that takes

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:43.490 
on the screen what I'm doing that takes
some<00:04:41.970> getting<00:04:42.270> used<00:04:42.300> to<00:04:42.630> it's<00:04:43.260> kind<00:04:43.410> of

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:43.500 
some getting used to it's kind of

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.340 
some getting used to it's kind of
disoriented<00:04:43.860> and<00:04:44.370> disorienting<00:04:45.240> at<00:04:45.750> first<00:04:45.780> so

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:46.350 
disoriented and disorienting at first so

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:49.130 
disoriented and disorienting at first so
yeah<00:04:47.010> i<00:04:47.040> would<00:04:47.340> i<00:04:47.580> would<00:04:47.610> say<00:04:47.970> in<00:04:48.660> my<00:04:48.810> opinion

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:49.140 
yeah i would i would say in my opinion

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:51.050 
yeah i would i would say in my opinion
they're<00:04:49.830> they're<00:04:50.130> both<00:04:50.250> artwork<00:04:50.640> from<00:04:50.760> being

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
they're they're both artwork from being

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:52.340 
they're they're both artwork from being
a<00:04:51.120> professional<00:04:51.420> artist<00:04:51.660> getting<00:04:51.990> paid<00:04:52.200> for

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:52.350 
a professional artist getting paid for

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:56.480 
a professional artist getting paid for
my<00:04:52.440> art<00:04:52.730> to<00:04:53.730> draw<00:04:54.450> this<00:04:54.780> way<00:04:55.310> sometimes<00:04:56.310> it's

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:56.490 
my art to draw this way sometimes it's

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:58.100 
my art to draw this way sometimes it's
even<00:04:56.670> harder<00:04:57.060> and<00:04:57.270> some<00:04:57.420> in<00:04:57.600> some<00:04:57.780> ways<00:04:57.840> it's

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:58.110 
even harder and some in some ways it's

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:59.930 
even harder and some in some ways it's
easier<00:04:58.230> especially<00:04:59.160> with<00:04:59.490> painting<00:04:59.820> there's

00:04:59.930 --> 00:04:59.940 
easier especially with painting there's

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:00.920 
easier especially with painting there's
nothing<00:05:00.150> to<00:05:00.210> clean<00:05:00.330> up<00:05:00.510> and<00:05:00.660> stuff<00:05:00.720> when

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:00.930 
nothing to clean up and stuff when

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.350 
nothing to clean up and stuff when
you're<00:05:01.020> doing<00:05:01.140> colors<00:05:01.470> but<00:05:02.190> you<00:05:02.790> know<00:05:02.910> the

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:03.360 
you're doing colors but you know the

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.290 
you're doing colors but you know the
mechanics<00:05:04.080> are<00:05:04.500> the<00:05:04.890> same<00:05:05.100> and<00:05:05.400> that's<00:05:06.030> what's

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:06.300 
mechanics are the same and that's what's

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:07.250 
mechanics are the same and that's what's
important<00:05:06.600> especially<00:05:06.690> when<00:05:06.990> it<00:05:07.080> comes<00:05:07.140> to

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:07.260 
important especially when it comes to

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:08.990 
important especially when it comes to
this<00:05:07.410> kind<00:05:07.590> like<00:05:07.770> your<00:05:07.980> your<00:05:08.400> actual<00:05:08.730> sketch

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:09.000 
this kind like your your actual sketch

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.760 
this kind like your your actual sketch
drawing<00:05:09.480> and<00:05:09.630> then<00:05:09.720> your<00:05:09.840> ink<00:05:09.990> drawing<00:05:10.410> if<00:05:10.710> i

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:10.770 
drawing and then your ink drawing if i

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:13.640 
drawing and then your ink drawing if i
switch<00:05:11.040> to<00:05:11.070> an<00:05:11.310> ink<00:05:11.490> brush<00:05:11.700> for<00:05:11.880> example<00:05:12.650> okay

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:13.650 
switch to an ink brush for example okay

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:16.340 
switch to an ink brush for example okay
i<00:05:14.370> have<00:05:14.820> this<00:05:15.090> backwards<00:05:15.570> i<00:05:15.750> need<00:05:15.900> to<00:05:15.990> change

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:16.350 
i have this backwards i need to change

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:19.010 
i have this backwards i need to change
that<00:05:16.650> so<00:05:17.460> let's<00:05:17.850> say<00:05:18.000> I<00:05:18.030> have<00:05:18.150> my<00:05:18.630> ink<00:05:18.810> brush

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:19.020 
that so let's say I have my ink brush

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:21.519 
that so let's say I have my ink brush
here<00:05:19.230> right<00:05:19.410> so

00:05:21.519 --> 00:05:21.529 
here right so

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:23.379 
here right so
the<00:05:22.069> mechanics<00:05:22.549> you<00:05:22.699> are<00:05:22.789> really<00:05:22.969> the<00:05:23.179> same<00:05:23.209> as

00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:23.389 
the mechanics you are really the same as

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:25.449 
the mechanics you are really the same as
if<00:05:23.809> i<00:05:23.899> was<00:05:24.019> working<00:05:24.139> with<00:05:24.319> like<00:05:24.439> a<00:05:24.559> paintbrush

00:05:25.449 --> 00:05:25.459 
if i was working with like a paintbrush

00:05:25.459 --> 00:05:28.929 
if i was working with like a paintbrush
with<00:05:25.879> ink<00:05:26.809> you<00:05:27.019> know<00:05:27.169> or<00:05:27.549> you<00:05:28.549> know<00:05:28.669> i<00:05:28.699> can<00:05:28.819> go

00:05:28.929 --> 00:05:28.939 
with ink you know or you know i can go

00:05:28.939 --> 00:05:30.969 
with ink you know or you know i can go
thin<00:05:29.209> and<00:05:29.839> i<00:05:29.929> get<00:05:30.109> thicker<00:05:30.349> and<00:05:30.529> thicker<00:05:30.739> then

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:30.979 
thin and i get thicker and thicker then

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:33.369 
thin and i get thicker and thicker then
go<00:05:31.129> back<00:05:31.249> and<00:05:31.309> taper<00:05:31.639> to<00:05:31.819> thin<00:05:31.999> again<00:05:32.199> this<00:05:33.199> is

00:05:33.369 --> 00:05:33.379 
go back and taper to thin again this is

00:05:33.379 --> 00:05:35.349 
go back and taper to thin again this is
about<00:05:33.559> the<00:05:33.829> same<00:05:34.009> mechanics<00:05:34.579> as<00:05:34.849> if<00:05:35.089> i<00:05:35.209> was

00:05:35.349 --> 00:05:35.359 
about the same mechanics as if i was

00:05:35.359 --> 00:05:37.659 
about the same mechanics as if i was
using<00:05:35.539> a<00:05:35.689> paintbrush<00:05:35.959> or<00:05:36.279> let's<00:05:37.279> see<00:05:37.459> here

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:37.669 
using a paintbrush or let's see here

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:40.179 
using a paintbrush or let's see here
type<00:05:37.969> of<00:05:38.239> pen<00:05:39.049> that<00:05:39.289> allows<00:05:39.559> you<00:05:39.919> know<00:05:40.009> that

00:05:40.179 --> 00:05:40.189 
type of pen that allows you know that

00:05:40.189 --> 00:05:41.469 
type of pen that allows you know that
has<00:05:40.279> a<00:05:40.309> really<00:05:40.519> soft<00:05:40.759> tip<00:05:40.999> that<00:05:41.149> allows<00:05:41.269> you<00:05:41.449> to

00:05:41.469 --> 00:05:41.479 
has a really soft tip that allows you to

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:43.059 
has a really soft tip that allows you to
have<00:05:41.689> all<00:05:41.719> these<00:05:41.959> different<00:05:42.199> weights<00:05:42.859> and

00:05:43.059 --> 00:05:43.069 
have all these different weights and

00:05:43.069 --> 00:05:44.979 
have all these different weights and
stroke<00:05:43.339> right<00:05:43.969> so<00:05:44.209> go<00:05:44.299> ahead<00:05:44.359> and<00:05:44.449> vote<00:05:44.659> let<00:05:44.899> me

00:05:44.979 --> 00:05:44.989 
stroke right so go ahead and vote let me

00:05:44.989 --> 00:05:46.449 
stroke right so go ahead and vote let me
know<00:05:45.079> what<00:05:45.139> you<00:05:45.229> think<00:05:45.379> which<00:05:46.129> one<00:05:46.339> is

00:05:46.449 --> 00:05:46.459 
know what you think which one is

00:05:46.459 --> 00:05:49.319 
know what you think which one is
considered<00:05:46.909> art<00:05:47.029> work<00:05:47.209> and<00:05:47.509> which<00:05:47.839> ones<00:05:47.869> not

00:05:49.319 --> 00:05:49.329 
considered art work and which ones not

00:05:49.329 --> 00:05:53.229 
considered art work and which ones not
or<00:05:50.329> are<00:05:50.359> they<00:05:50.689> both<00:05:50.809> artwork
