in<00:02:30.000> a<00:02:30.060> while<00:02:30.239> I<00:02:30.269> would<00:02:30.540> get<00:02:30.690> a<00:02:30.720> registered<00:02:31.260> kill

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
in a while I would get a registered kill

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.290 
in a while I would get a registered kill
but<00:02:31.830> more<00:02:31.980> often<00:02:32.160> than<00:02:32.400> not<00:02:32.459> it<00:02:32.790> failed<00:02:33.150> to

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
but more often than not it failed to

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.570 
but more often than not it failed to
work<00:02:33.680> unfortunately<00:02:34.680> this<00:02:34.920> is<00:02:35.100> a<00:02:35.130> challenge

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
work unfortunately this is a challenge

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.340 
work unfortunately this is a challenge
you<00:02:35.670> can't<00:02:35.940> test<00:02:36.269> in<00:02:36.480> a<00:02:36.570> private<00:02:36.900> match<00:02:37.080> as

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
you can't test in a private match as

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.650 
you can't test in a private match as
there<00:02:37.530> is<00:02:37.620> no<00:02:37.890> notification<00:02:38.670> whatsoever<00:02:39.450> if

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:41.549 
you actually get this to work there are

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:43.910 
you actually get this to work there are
ways<00:02:41.790> to<00:02:41.820> get<00:02:42.090> around<00:02:42.180> this<00:02:42.480> of<00:02:42.720> course<00:02:42.769> so<00:02:43.769> in

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
ways to get around this of course so in

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.140 
ways to get around this of course so in
order<00:02:44.040> to<00:02:44.160> test<00:02:44.430> to<00:02:44.670> find<00:02:44.820> out<00:02:45.000> what

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
order to test to find out what

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.310 
order to test to find out what
definitely<00:02:45.780> works

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
definitely works

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:47.900 
definitely works
I<00:02:46.350> would<00:02:46.739> limit<00:02:47.040> my<00:02:47.160> use<00:02:47.370> of<00:02:47.400> the<00:02:47.640> smoke

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
I would limit my use of the smoke

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.120 
I would limit my use of the smoke
grenade<00:02:48.209> per<00:02:48.480> match<00:02:48.690> for<00:02:49.530> example<00:02:49.980> I<00:02:50.070> would

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
grenade per match for example I would

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.039 
grenade per match for example I would
shoot<00:02:50.430> one<00:02:50.760> single<00:02:51.269> smoke<00:02:51.540> grenade<00:02:51.810> in<00:02:51.959> the

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
shoot one single smoke grenade in the

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:54.080 
shoot one single smoke grenade in the
method<00:02:52.350> that<00:02:52.470> I<00:02:52.500> wanted<00:02:52.890> get<00:02:53.430> the<00:02:53.580> kill<00:02:53.820> and

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
method that I wanted get the kill and

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.460 
method that I wanted get the kill and
then<00:02:54.239> leave<00:02:54.450> the<00:02:54.600> game<00:02:54.780> and<00:02:54.989> check<00:02:55.110> to<00:02:55.290> see<00:02:55.320> if

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
then leave the game and check to see if

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.770 
then leave the game and check to see if
it<00:02:55.650> registered<00:02:56.160> by<00:02:56.730> doing<00:02:57.060> this<00:02:57.239> I<00:02:57.480> was<00:02:57.630> able

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
it registered by doing this I was able

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.720 
it registered by doing this I was able
to<00:02:57.930> successfully<00:02:58.440> identify<00:02:58.739> the<00:02:59.280> correct

let's take another look at the kill but

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.070 
let's take another look at the kill but
this<00:03:26.130> time<00:03:26.310> in<00:03:26.460> slow<00:03:26.670> motion<00:03:27.000> so<00:03:27.390> I<00:03:27.600> fired<00:03:27.930> my

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
this time in slow motion so I fired my

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.930 
this time in slow motion so I fired my
smoke<00:03:28.350> grenade<00:03:28.620> in<00:03:28.770> front<00:03:28.980> of<00:03:29.070> him<00:03:29.220> but<00:03:29.760> by<00:03:29.880> the

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
smoke grenade in front of him but by the

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.790 
smoke grenade in front of him but by the
time<00:03:30.210> I<00:03:30.270> detonate<00:03:30.720> it<00:03:30.870> he<00:03:31.050> jumps<00:03:31.350> in<00:03:31.470> front<00:03:31.650> of

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:31.800 
time I detonate it he jumps in front of

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.040 
time I detonate it he jumps in front of
the<00:03:31.890> blast<00:03:32.160> and<00:03:32.490> then<00:03:33.000> I<00:03:33.090> kill<00:03:33.360> him<00:03:33.510> when<00:03:33.960> he

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.050 
the blast and then I kill him when he

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:36.050 
the blast and then I kill him when he
dies<00:03:34.260> he's<00:03:34.680> on<00:03:34.800> the<00:03:34.890> outskirts<00:03:35.490> of<00:03:35.640> the<00:03:35.730> smoke

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
dies he's on the outskirts of the smoke

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.090 
dies he's on the outskirts of the smoke
but<00:03:36.510> I<00:03:36.570> wouldn't<00:03:36.870> call<00:03:37.050> it<00:03:37.080> in<00:03:37.350> the<00:03:37.620> smoke<00:03:37.860> by

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
but I wouldn't call it in the smoke by

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.370 
but I wouldn't call it in the smoke by
any<00:03:38.280> means<00:03:38.550> he's<00:03:39.120> clearly<00:03:39.480> not<00:03:39.600> engulfed<00:03:40.170> much

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
any means he's clearly not engulfed much

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.710 
any means he's clearly not engulfed much
at<00:03:40.530> all<00:03:40.680> so<00:03:41.400> after<00:03:41.700> seeing<00:03:41.880> this<00:03:42.150> and<00:03:42.420> knowing

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
at all so after seeing this and knowing

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.260 
at all so after seeing this and knowing
that<00:03:42.750> it<00:03:42.960> worked<00:03:43.200> I<00:03:43.440> investigated<00:03:44.160> further<00:03:44.310> my

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:45.270 
that it worked I investigated further my

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:47.420 
that it worked I investigated further my
conclusion<00:03:45.930> and<00:03:46.170> in<00:03:46.320> fact<00:03:46.620> the<00:03:47.010> actual

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
conclusion and in fact the actual

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.520 
conclusion and in fact the actual
strategy<00:03:48.060> you<00:03:48.240> need<00:03:48.390> to<00:03:48.510> use<00:03:48.720> is<00:03:49.020> that<00:03:49.350> this

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
strategy you need to use is that this

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.380 
strategy you need to use is that this
challenge<00:03:50.040> works<00:03:50.310> only<00:03:50.850> if<00:03:50.970> the<00:03:51.120> smoke

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
challenge works only if the smoke

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:53.330 
challenge works only if the smoke
disperses<00:03:52.110> in<00:03:52.260> front<00:03:52.560> of<00:03:52.620> the<00:03:52.710> enemy<00:03:52.860> and<00:03:53.220> you

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
disperses in front of the enemy and you

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.460 
disperses in front of the enemy and you
kill<00:03:53.610> him<00:03:53.730> immediately<00:03:53.880> after<00:03:54.570> within<00:03:55.080> one<00:03:55.320> to

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
kill him immediately after within one to

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.800 
kill him immediately after within one to
two<00:03:55.620> seconds<00:03:56.160> anything<00:03:57.030> after<00:03:57.390> that<00:03:57.420> time

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
two seconds anything after that time

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.650 
two seconds anything after that time
period<00:03:58.230> will<00:03:58.500> not<00:03:58.530> count<00:03:59.400> so<00:04:00.090> let<00:04:00.270> me<00:04:00.360> repeat

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
period will not count so let me repeat

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.320 
period will not count so let me repeat
that<00:04:00.720> find<00:04:01.620> a<00:04:01.740> victim<00:04:01.940> preferably<00:04:02.940> in<00:04:03.060> close

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:03.330 
that find a victim preferably in close

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.450 
that find a victim preferably in close

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
the detonate button immediately once you

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:10.640 
the detonate button immediately once you
hear<00:04:09.300> that<00:04:09.330> puff<00:04:09.720> sound<00:04:10.080> from<00:04:10.290> the<00:04:10.380> grenade

meaning<00:04:11.370> as<00:04:11.520> soon<00:04:11.760> as<00:04:11.880> it<00:04:12.030> starts<00:04:12.330> dispersing

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
meaning as soon as it starts dispersing

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.840 
meaning as soon as it starts dispersing
the<00:04:12.990> smoke<00:04:13.290> kill<00:04:13.680> the<00:04:13.800> enemy<00:04:14.070> if<00:04:14.310> you<00:04:14.490> wait

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:14.850 
the smoke kill the enemy if you wait

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:16.699 
the smoke kill the enemy if you wait
until<00:04:15.000> the<00:04:15.210> smoke<00:04:15.420> forms<00:04:15.900> you'll<00:04:16.200> never<00:04:16.500> get

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709 
until the smoke forms you'll never get

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:18.860 
until the smoke forms you'll never get
the<00:04:16.859> kills<00:04:17.100> so<00:04:17.790> these<00:04:17.940> next<00:04:18.150> few<00:04:18.390> clips<00:04:18.690> are

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
the kills so these next few clips are

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:20.599 
the kills so these next few clips are
all<00:04:18.900> going<00:04:19.320> to<00:04:19.410> be<00:04:19.560> from<00:04:19.769> the<00:04:19.859> same<00:04:20.070> game<00:04:20.280> I

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
all going to be from the same game I

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:22.850 
all going to be from the same game I
started<00:04:21.299> this<00:04:21.359> game<00:04:21.570> with<00:04:21.780> 16<00:04:22.230> smoke<00:04:22.560> grenade

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
started this game with 16 smoke grenade

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.860 
started this game with 16 smoke grenade
kills<00:04:23.130> and<00:04:23.430> I<00:04:23.490> ended<00:04:23.760> it<00:04:23.850> with<00:04:23.970> 22<00:04:24.570> after

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
kills and I ended it with 22 after

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:27.350 
kills and I ended it with 22 after
reviewing<00:04:25.770> the<00:04:25.920> footage<00:04:26.100> I<00:04:26.400> only<00:04:26.670> killed<00:04:27.060> 6

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
reviewing the footage I only killed 6

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.480 
reviewing the footage I only killed 6
people<00:04:27.450> after<00:04:27.930> deploying<00:04:28.320> the<00:04:28.500> smoke<00:04:28.800> so<00:04:29.340> that

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
people after deploying the smoke so that

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.400 
people after deploying the smoke so that
means<00:04:29.700> that<00:04:29.940> all<00:04:30.120> 6<00:04:30.480> of<00:04:30.600> these<00:04:30.720> examples<00:04:31.110> are

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.410 
means that all 6 of these examples are

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:34.220 
means that all 6 of these examples are
ones<00:04:31.590> that<00:04:31.680> 100%<00:04:32.460> were<00:04:32.910> confirmed<00:04:33.360> to<00:04:33.480> work<00:04:33.750> so

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:34.230 
ones that 100% were confirmed to work so

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:36.409 
ones that 100% were confirmed to work so
pay<00:04:34.410> close<00:04:34.770> attention<00:04:34.980> and<00:04:35.460> study<00:04:35.760> my<00:04:35.940> tactics

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:36.419 
pay close attention and study my tactics

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:38.300 
pay close attention and study my tactics
so<00:04:36.570> you<00:04:36.660> can<00:04:36.810> master<00:04:37.169> it<00:04:37.230> yourself<00:04:37.590> it's

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.310 
so you can master it yourself it's

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:39.830 
so you can master it yourself it's
really<00:04:38.669> not<00:04:38.790> too<00:04:39.030> difficult<00:04:39.240> once<00:04:39.630> you<00:04:39.720> get

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
really not too difficult once you get

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.810 
really not too difficult once you get
the<00:04:39.930> hang<00:04:40.110> of<00:04:40.230> it<00:04:40.320> my<00:04:40.890> biggest<00:04:41.130> problem<00:04:41.669> was

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:41.820 
the hang of it my biggest problem was

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:43.820 
the hang of it my biggest problem was
detonating<00:04:42.360> them<00:04:42.510> fast<00:04:42.780> enough<00:04:42.930> as<00:04:43.320> soon<00:04:43.710> as

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
detonating them fast enough as soon as

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:44.990 
detonating them fast enough as soon as
the<00:04:43.950> smoke<00:04:44.190> grenade<00:04:44.430> hits<00:04:44.669> the<00:04:44.820> ground

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.000 
the smoke grenade hits the ground

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.820 
the smoke grenade hits the ground
DoubleTap<00:04:45.780> the<00:04:45.810> detonation<00:04:46.320> button<00:04:46.740> to

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:46.830 
DoubleTap the detonation button to

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:49.130 
DoubleTap the detonation button to
deploy<00:04:47.130> them<00:04:47.310> as<00:04:47.430> fast<00:04:47.700> as<00:04:47.970> possible<00:04:48.060> but<00:04:48.990> be

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:49.140 
deploy them as fast as possible but be

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:50.659 
deploy them as fast as possible but be
warned<00:04:49.410> they<00:04:49.650> have<00:04:49.800> a<00:04:49.830> tendency<00:04:50.370> to<00:04:50.490> take<00:04:50.610> a

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:50.669 
warned they have a tendency to take a

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:53.090 
warned they have a tendency to take a
huge<00:04:51.120> bounce<00:04:51.480> which<00:04:52.110> makes<00:04:52.350> them<00:04:52.500> shoot<00:04:52.710> sky

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:53.100 
huge bounce which makes them shoot sky

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:54.680 
huge bounce which makes them shoot sky
high<00:04:53.370> in<00:04:53.400> the<00:04:53.669> air<00:04:53.790> before<00:04:54.120> you<00:04:54.210> can<00:04:54.330> detonate

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:54.690 
high in the air before you can detonate

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:57.770 
high in the air before you can detonate
them<00:04:54.900> so<00:04:55.320> be<00:04:55.500> careful<00:04:55.950> for<00:04:56.550> a<00:04:56.610> class<00:04:56.910> setup<00:04:57.360> you

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780 
them so be careful for a class setup you

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:59.720 
them so be careful for a class setup you
obviously<00:04:58.320> need<00:04:58.500> to<00:04:58.530> run<00:04:58.710> two<00:04:59.010> smoke<00:04:59.430> grenades
