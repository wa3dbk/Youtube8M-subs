00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:21.720 

we<00:00:20.530> really<00:00:20.860> want<00:00:21.040> to<00:00:21.100> make<00:00:21.190> sure<00:00:21.250> that<00:00:21.580> there's

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:21.730 
we really want to make sure that there's

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:23.790 
we really want to make sure that there's
that<00:00:21.790> contrast<00:00:22.420> between<00:00:22.600> the<00:00:23.170> negative<00:00:23.650> space

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:23.800 
that contrast between the negative space

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.750 
that contrast between the negative space
and<00:00:24.779> then<00:00:25.779> the<00:00:26.020> high-tension<00:00:26.529> Speights<00:00:27.010> you

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:27.760 
and then the high-tension Speights you

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:29.700 
and then the high-tension Speights you
need<00:00:28.060> the<00:00:28.330> exploration<00:00:29.050> you<00:00:29.290> need<00:00:29.529> the

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:29.710 
need the exploration you need the

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:32.400 
need the exploration you need the
scavenging<00:00:30.340> you<00:00:30.520> need<00:00:30.730> something<00:00:31.300> to<00:00:31.540> to<00:00:32.200> say

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:32.410 
scavenging you need something to to say

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:35.250 
scavenging you need something to to say
like<00:00:32.620> okay<00:00:32.920> I'm<00:00:33.430> setting<00:00:33.879> a<00:00:33.940> certain<00:00:34.210> tone<00:00:34.420> and

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:35.260 
like okay I'm setting a certain tone and

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.350 
like okay I'm setting a certain tone and
a<00:00:35.320> patina<00:00:35.650> here<00:00:36.370> so<00:00:36.820> that<00:00:37.000> then<00:00:37.180> we<00:00:37.330> can

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:37.360 
a patina here so that then we can

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.420 
a patina here so that then we can
contrast<00:00:38.050> that<00:00:38.260> with<00:00:38.320> some<00:00:38.559> stark<00:00:38.920> like

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:39.430 
contrast that with some stark like

that door or you could craft a melee

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.200 
that door or you could craft a melee
upgrade<00:02:32.200> so<00:02:32.470> you<00:02:32.560> might<00:02:32.890> have<00:02:33.160> some<00:02:33.970> nails

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:34.210

scissors or something you're going to be

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.910 
scissors or something you're going to be
able<00:02:36.850> to<00:02:36.970> use<00:02:37.630> advantages<00:02:38.470> and<00:02:38.650> use<00:02:38.740> these

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
able to use advantages and use these

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.970 
able to use advantages and use these
things<00:02:38.950> to<00:02:39.160> attach<00:02:39.520> them<00:02:39.850> to<00:02:40.300> the<00:02:40.980> two-by-four

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
things to attach them to the two-by-four

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.980 
things to attach them to the two-by-four
so<00:02:42.610> now<00:02:42.760> you've<00:02:42.880> got<00:02:43.030> a<00:02:43.060> more<00:02:43.270> powerful<00:02:43.450> melee

able to run and take down in a low
alternatively<00:02:48.070> but<00:02:48.460> you<00:02:48.520> can<00:02:48.670> use<00:02:48.820> those<00:02:49.030> same

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:49.270 
alternatively but you can use those same

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:52.650 
alternatively but you can use those same
types<00:02:49.570> of<00:02:49.750> nails<00:02:50.020> to<00:02:50.560> make<00:02:51.220> a<00:02:51.640> bomb<00:02:52.120> is

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
types of nails to make a bomb is

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.500 
types of nails to make a bomb is
something<00:02:52.959> you<00:02:53.020> can<00:02:53.170> place<00:02:53.350> in<00:02:53.530> the<00:02:53.620> world

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
something you can place in the world

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.360 
something you can place in the world
and<00:02:54.689> they<00:02:55.080> could<00:02:55.230> go<00:02:55.319> to<00:02:55.349> trigger

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.920 

since<00:03:00.370> resources<00:03:00.790> are<00:03:00.910> limited<00:03:01.060> you<00:03:01.750> still

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
since resources are limited you still

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.750 
since resources are limited you still
pass<00:03:02.140> an<00:03:02.320> encounter<00:03:02.560> you're<00:03:03.340> not<00:03:03.460> getting<00:03:03.670> the

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
pass an encounter you're not getting the

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:04.890 
pass an encounter you're not getting the
stuff<00:03:03.910> that<00:03:04.060> was<00:03:04.120> encountered<00:03:04.510> not<00:03:04.630> just<00:03:04.840> the

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
stuff that was encountered not just the

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.210 
stuff that was encountered not just the
stuff<00:03:05.050> off<00:03:05.230> the<00:03:05.260> guys<00:03:05.560> that<00:03:05.860> you<00:03:05.980> would<00:03:06.010> have

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
stuff off the guys that you would have

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.850 
stuff off the guys that you would have
taken<00:03:06.460> down<00:03:06.760> but<00:03:07.420> also<00:03:07.600> in<00:03:08.170> terms<00:03:08.530> of<00:03:08.680> what's

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
taken down but also in terms of what's

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.110 
taken down but also in terms of what's
in<00:03:08.980> the<00:03:09.040> environment<00:03:09.280> for<00:03:09.580> you<00:03:09.640> to<00:03:09.670> scavenge

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
in the environment for you to scavenge

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.450 
in the environment for you to scavenge
so<00:03:10.600> it's<00:03:10.810> a<00:03:10.960> you<00:03:11.620> have<00:03:11.740> to<00:03:11.890> balance<00:03:12.040> at<00:03:12.280> risk

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:12.460 
so it's a you have to balance at risk

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:14.520 
so it's a you have to balance at risk
versus<00:03:12.760> reward<00:03:12.880> but<00:03:13.180> it's<00:03:13.300> definitely<00:03:13.510> all<00:03:14.470> a

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
versus reward but it's definitely all a

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.440 
versus reward but it's definitely all a
part<00:03:14.920> of<00:03:14.980> the<00:03:15.070> choice<00:03:15.250> and<00:03:15.610> sometimes<00:03:16.270> the

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
part of the choice and sometimes the

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:17.460 
part of the choice and sometimes the
world<00:03:16.600> doesn't<00:03:16.840> give<00:03:17.080> you<00:03:17.200> a<00:03:17.230> choice

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
world doesn't give you a choice

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.830 
world doesn't give you a choice
sometimes<00:03:17.950> the<00:03:18.550> battle<00:03:19.120> breaks<00:03:19.330> out<00:03:19.570> in<00:03:19.660> a<00:03:19.720> way

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
sometimes the battle breaks out in a way

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.080 
sometimes the battle breaks out in a way
you<00:03:19.900> didn't<00:03:20.350> expect<00:03:20.800> and<00:03:21.040> you<00:03:21.070> have<00:03:21.850> to<00:03:21.970> make

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
you didn't expect and you have to make

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.570 
you didn't expect and you have to make
decisions<00:03:22.210> like<00:03:22.810> in<00:03:23.170> the<00:03:23.380> moment<00:03:23.770> so<00:03:24.220> that's

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:24.580 
decisions like in the moment so that's

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:26.010 
decisions like in the moment so that's
another<00:03:24.820> reason<00:03:25.090> why<00:03:25.300> we<00:03:25.660> did<00:03:25.870> the<00:03:25.990> whole

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:26.020 
another reason why we did the whole

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:28.860 
another reason why we did the whole
crafting<00:03:26.740> system<00:03:26.950> live<00:03:27.460> we<00:03:28.180> didn't<00:03:28.480> want<00:03:28.510> the
