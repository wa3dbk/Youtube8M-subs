00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:01.709 
me and see you is that they can do the

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:04.039 
me and see you is that they can do the
damage<00:00:02.159> to<00:00:02.460> your<00:00:02.490> body<00:00:02.760> by<00:00:03.030> binding<00:00:03.600> or

00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049 
damage to your body by binding or

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:06.140 
damage to your body by binding or

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150 
attaching to different parts of the body

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.230 
attaching to different parts of the body
the<00:00:06.839> intestines<00:00:07.470> where<00:00:08.130> the<00:00:08.400> absorption<00:00:08.849> of

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
the intestines where the absorption of

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.540 
the intestines where the absorption of
nutrients<00:00:09.750> take<00:00:10.050> place<00:00:10.440> okay<00:00:11.070> and<00:00:11.309> if<00:00:11.400> we're

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
nutrients take place okay and if we're

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.100 
nutrients take place okay and if we're
talking<00:00:11.849> about<00:00:11.910> the<00:00:12.059> intestines<00:00:12.570> the

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
talking about the intestines the

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.680 
talking about the intestines the
nutrients<00:00:13.799> that<00:00:14.130> we're<00:00:14.759> absorbing<00:00:15.480> in<00:00:15.599> our

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
nutrients that we're absorbing in our

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.750 
nutrients that we're absorbing in our
body<00:00:15.900> from<00:00:16.080> the<00:00:16.199> foods<00:00:16.379> we<00:00:16.560> take<00:00:17.220> place<00:00:17.520> at<00:00:17.730> a

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
body from the foods we take place at a

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.609 
body from the foods we take place at a
location<00:00:18.210> called<00:00:18.570> the<00:00:18.690> brush<00:00:18.930> border<00:00:19.230> and

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
location called the brush border and

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.260 
location called the brush border and
when<00:00:20.340> they<00:00:20.460> do<00:00:20.520> this

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
when they do this

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.689 
when they do this
these<00:00:21.539> lectin<00:00:22.080> binding<00:00:22.470> proteins<00:00:22.920> attach<00:00:23.460> to

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
these lectin binding proteins attach to

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.880 
these lectin binding proteins attach to
that<00:00:23.789> brush<00:00:24.060> border<00:00:24.330> they<00:00:24.990> create<00:00:25.380> systemic

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
that brush border they create systemic

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.560 
that brush border they create systemic
inflammation<00:00:26.369> or<00:00:26.820> whole<00:00:27.060> body<00:00:27.269> inflammation

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
inflammation or whole body inflammation

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.419 
inflammation or whole body inflammation
and<00:00:27.990> then<00:00:28.380> at<00:00:28.529> that<00:00:28.619> point<00:00:28.830> time<00:00:29.070> they<00:00:29.220> really

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
and then at that point time they really

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.730 
and then at that point time they really
block<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:30.029> nutrient<00:00:30.510> absorption<00:00:30.599> of<00:00:31.170> these

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
block the nutrient absorption of these

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.560 
block the nutrient absorption of these
vitamins<00:00:32.070> and<00:00:32.340> if<00:00:32.610> you've<00:00:32.910> been<00:00:33.180> tested

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
vitamins and if you've been tested

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.080 
vitamins and if you've been tested
recently<00:00:33.930> for<00:00:34.079> vitamin<00:00:34.440> D<00:00:34.610> chances<00:00:35.610> are<00:00:35.790> you

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
recently for vitamin D chances are you

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.720 
recently for vitamin D chances are you
had<00:00:36.210> low<00:00:36.420> vitamin<00:00:36.899> D<00:00:37.050> and<00:00:37.290> this<00:00:37.800> could<00:00:38.129> be<00:00:38.309> part

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
had low vitamin D and this could be part

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.690 
had low vitamin D and this could be part
of<00:00:38.940> why<00:00:39.270> you<00:00:39.329> have<00:00:39.510> low<00:00:39.840> levels<00:00:40.200> of<00:00:40.290> vitamin<00:00:40.620> D

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:40.700 
of why you have low levels of vitamin D

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.970 
of why you have low levels of vitamin D
so<00:00:41.700> it's<00:00:42.239> this<00:00:42.420> mechanism<00:00:42.870> of<00:00:43.260> either<00:00:43.410> binding

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
so it's this mechanism of either binding

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.340 
so it's this mechanism of either binding
to<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.190> brush<00:00:44.430> border<00:00:44.820> that<00:00:45.420> causes<00:00:45.960> many<00:00:46.200> of

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
to the brush border that causes many of

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.020 
to the brush border that causes many of
the<00:00:46.469> gastrointestinal<00:00:47.039> systems<00:00:47.640> to<00:00:47.879> actually

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
the gastrointestinal systems to actually

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.520 
the gastrointestinal systems to actually
show<00:00:48.390> up<00:00:48.570> so<00:00:48.780> again<00:00:49.050> if<00:00:49.170> you're<00:00:49.289> suffering

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
show up so again if you're suffering

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.459 
show up so again if you're suffering
with<00:00:49.770> things<00:00:49.920> like<00:00:50.010> diarrhea<00:00:50.430> vomiting

00:00:51.459 --> 00:00:51.469

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
background information on lectins that I

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.689 
background information on lectins that I
want<00:01:01.710> you<00:01:01.800> to<00:01:01.859> know<00:01:02.039> if<00:01:02.129> you<00:01:02.219> if<00:01:02.370> you<00:01:02.489> don't

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
want you to know if you if you don't

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.579 
want you to know if you if you don't
already<00:01:02.850> know<00:01:03.059> this<00:01:03.329> and<00:01:03.660> I<00:01:04.140> find<00:01:04.500> this

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
already know this and I find this

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.109 
already know this and I find this
amazing<00:01:05.100> because<00:01:05.220> from<00:01:05.790> an<00:01:05.909> evolutionary

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
amazing because from an evolutionary

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.469 
amazing because from an evolutionary
standpoint<00:01:06.979> lectins<00:01:07.979> have<00:01:08.250> evolved<00:01:09.090> to

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
standpoint lectins have evolved to

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.420 
standpoint lectins have evolved to
withstand<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:10.350> digestion<00:01:10.830> or<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.159> breakdown

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
withstand the digestion or the breakdown

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.270 
withstand the digestion or the breakdown
of<00:01:11.909> its<00:01:12.210> structure<00:01:12.659> through<00:01:13.140> a<00:01:13.170> wide<00:01:13.470> range<00:01:14.010> of

of its structure through a wide range of
PHS<00:01:14.850> and<00:01:14.970> temperatures<00:01:15.659> it's<00:01:16.229> almost<00:01:16.500> like

it's a built-in survival tactic so the

has<00:01:47.880> neurological<00:01:48.810> consequences<00:01:49.140> so<00:01:50.009> several

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
has neurological consequences so several

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:51.710 
has neurological consequences so several
recent<00:01:50.610> studies<00:01:51.060> have<00:01:51.210> shown<00:01:51.450> that<00:01:51.570> these

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
recent studies have shown that these

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.649 
recent studies have shown that these
lectins<00:01:52.460> can<00:01:53.460> actually<00:01:53.939> cross<00:01:54.630> the

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
lectins can actually cross the

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.690 
lectins can actually cross the
protective<00:01:55.649> barrier<00:01:55.799> of<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.100> brain<00:01:56.340> called

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
protective barrier of the brain called

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.389 
protective barrier of the brain called
the<00:01:56.790> blood-brain<00:01:57.240> barrier<00:01:57.719> and<00:01:58.409> now<00:01:58.920> once<00:01:59.250> it

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
the blood-brain barrier and now once it

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.249 
the blood-brain barrier and now once it
gets<00:01:59.610> past<00:01:59.909> this<00:02:00.180> blood-brain<00:02:00.719> barrier<00:02:00.750> they

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
gets past this blood-brain barrier they

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:02.929 
gets past this blood-brain barrier they
can<00:02:01.409> attach<00:02:01.710> to<00:02:02.009> the<00:02:02.130> protective<00:02:02.700> coating

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
can attach to the protective coating

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.050 
can attach to the protective coating
called<00:02:03.899> the<00:02:04.110> myelin<00:02:04.439> sheath<00:02:04.619> and<00:02:05.430> at<00:02:05.880> that

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
called the myelin sheath and at that

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.490 
called the myelin sheath and at that
point<00:02:06.329> time<00:02:06.689> it<00:02:06.960> can<00:02:07.110> trigger<00:02:07.290> an

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
point time it can trigger an

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.109 
point time it can trigger an
inflammatory<00:02:07.979> response<00:02:08.280> by<00:02:08.789> which<00:02:08.940> the

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
inflammatory response by which the

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.150 
inflammatory response by which the
immune<00:02:09.300> system<00:02:09.690> begins<00:02:09.810> to<00:02:10.080> attack<00:02:10.349> certain

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
immune system begins to attack certain

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.890 
immune system begins to attack certain
proteins<00:02:11.670> that<00:02:11.910> are<00:02:11.970> the<00:02:12.150> structural

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
proteins that are the structural

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.430 
proteins that are the structural
component

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
component

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.680 
component
of<00:02:13.620> the<00:02:14.100> nerve<00:02:14.250> system<00:02:14.490> and<00:02:14.940> one<00:02:15.480> of<00:02:15.570> these

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
of the nerve system and one of these

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.090 
of the nerve system and one of these
structural<00:02:16.110> proteins<00:02:16.530> is<00:02:16.680> something<00:02:16.950> called

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
structural proteins is something called

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.320 
structural proteins is something called
myelin<00:02:17.340> basic<00:02:17.520> protein

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
myelin basic protein

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.900 
myelin basic protein
okay<00:02:18.630> so<00:02:18.690> again<00:02:19.320> remember<00:02:19.830> this<00:02:19.920> lectins<00:02:20.790> are

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
okay so again remember this lectins are

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.120 
okay so again remember this lectins are
sticky<00:02:21.270> structures<00:02:21.840> they<00:02:22.260> attach<00:02:22.620> to<00:02:22.650> parts

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
sticky structures they attach to parts

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.250 
sticky structures they attach to parts
of<00:02:23.220> the<00:02:23.250> body<00:02:23.490> the<00:02:24.060> immune<00:02:24.210> system<00:02:24.690> sees<00:02:24.930> them

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
of the body the immune system sees them

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:26.870 
of the body the immune system sees them
the<00:02:25.620> immune<00:02:25.800> system<00:02:26.070> wants<00:02:26.280> to<00:02:26.340> attack<00:02:26.640> them

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
the immune system wants to attack them

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.850 
the immune system wants to attack them
it<00:02:27.000> wants<00:02:27.270> to<00:02:27.360> kill<00:02:27.600> them<00:02:27.810> the<00:02:28.380> only<00:02:28.560> problem

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
it wants to kill them the only problem

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.800 
it wants to kill them the only problem
is<00:02:28.950> is<00:02:29.130> that<00:02:29.160> in<00:02:29.730> the<00:02:29.850> process<00:02:30.360> of<00:02:30.480> the<00:02:30.570> immune

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
is is that in the process of the immune

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.200 
is is that in the process of the immune
system<00:02:31.170> attacking<00:02:31.470> the<00:02:32.280> lectin<00:02:32.760> it's<00:02:32.970> also

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:33.210 
system attacking the lectin it's also

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:35.720 
system attacking the lectin it's also
attacking<00:02:33.900> the<00:02:34.200> tissue<00:02:34.440> that<00:02:34.770> the<00:02:35.220> lectin<00:02:35.580> is

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
attacking the tissue that the lectin is

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.300 
attacking the tissue that the lectin is
connected<00:02:36.360> to<00:02:36.450> or<00:02:36.570> bound<00:02:36.750> to<00:02:36.960> okay<00:02:37.440> and<00:02:38.040> this

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
connected to or bound to okay and this

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.220 
connected to or bound to okay and this
is<00:02:38.580> the<00:02:38.760> basis<00:02:39.150> for<00:02:39.180> autoimmunity<00:02:39.870> and<00:02:40.050> this

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
is the basis for autoimmunity and this

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:41.600 
is the basis for autoimmunity and this
has<00:02:40.320> also<00:02:40.470> been<00:02:40.710> documented<00:02:41.040> in<00:02:41.370> those

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
has also been documented in those

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.250 
has also been documented in those
patients<00:02:41.970> who<00:02:42.210> actually<00:02:42.630> suffer<00:02:43.080> with

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
patients who actually suffer with

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.920 
patients who actually suffer with
rheumatoid<00:02:43.890> arthritis<00:02:44.030> okay<00:02:45.030> so<00:02:45.630> here<00:02:45.810> again

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
rheumatoid arthritis okay so here again

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.380 
rheumatoid arthritis okay so here again
study<00:02:46.440> after<00:02:46.710> study<00:02:46.770> shows<00:02:47.040> that<00:02:47.730> there<00:02:48.270> is<00:02:48.300> a

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
study after study shows that there is a

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.690 
study after study shows that there is a
dietary<00:02:49.200> component<00:02:49.830> to<00:02:49.890> autoimmunity<00:02:50.400> and

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
dietary component to autoimmunity and

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.910 
dietary component to autoimmunity and
myelin<00:02:51.540> sheath<00:02:51.750> breakdown<00:02:52.200> that<00:02:52.500> is<00:02:52.650> caused

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
myelin sheath breakdown that is caused

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.480 
myelin sheath breakdown that is caused
by<00:02:53.160> lectins<00:02:53.640> and<00:02:53.880> gluten<00:02:54.360> proteins<00:02:54.830> now<00:02:55.830> there

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:56.490 
by lectins and gluten proteins now there

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:57.980 
by lectins and gluten proteins now there
is<00:02:56.610> a<00:02:56.640> test<00:02:56.940> that<00:02:57.000> we<00:02:57.150> use<00:02:57.270> our<00:02:57.420> office<00:02:57.870> that

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:57.990 
is a test that we use our office that

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:00.260 
is a test that we use our office that
helps<00:02:58.290> to<00:02:58.440> identify<00:02:58.500> this<00:02:59.040> so<00:02:59.430> the<00:02:59.880> point<00:03:00.120> I

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270 
helps to identify this so the point I

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:02.150 
helps to identify this so the point I
want<00:03:00.510> to<00:03:00.540> remember<00:03:00.930> about<00:03:01.170> today's<00:03:01.560> video<00:03:01.950> is

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
want to remember about today's video is

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.880 
want to remember about today's video is
that<00:03:02.640> what<00:03:03.030> we<00:03:03.210> eat<00:03:03.450> just<00:03:04.110> has<00:03:04.230> a<00:03:04.260> massive

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
that what we eat just has a massive

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:06.950 
that what we eat just has a massive
impact<00:03:05.070> on<00:03:05.640> either<00:03:05.940> creating<00:03:06.600> health<00:03:06.780> in<00:03:06.930> our
