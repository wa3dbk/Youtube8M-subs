00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:02.300 

in<00:00:00.690> technical<00:00:01.170> drawings--<00:00:01.650> there's<00:00:02.010> a<00:00:02.100> lot<00:00:02.280> of

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:02.310 
in technical drawings-- there's a lot of

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:04.460 
in technical drawings-- there's a lot of
information<00:00:02.939> we<00:00:03.060> need<00:00:03.210> to<00:00:03.240> show<00:00:03.570> and<00:00:03.840> trying

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:04.470 
information we need to show and trying

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:05.630 
information we need to show and trying
to<00:00:04.620> show<00:00:04.770> all<00:00:04.950> of<00:00:04.980> it<00:00:05.190> can<00:00:05.339> be<00:00:05.400> quite<00:00:05.609> a

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
to show all of it can be quite a

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.519 
to show all of it can be quite a
challenge<00:00:05.730> especially<00:00:06.660> when<00:00:07.020> all<00:00:07.140> we<00:00:07.230> have<00:00:07.379> to

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
challenge especially when all we have to

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.089 
challenge especially when all we have to
work<00:00:07.680> with<00:00:07.859> is<00:00:08.010> one<00:00:08.189> single<00:00:08.400> pencil<00:00:10.040> so<00:00:11.040> to

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
work with is one single pencil so to

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:11.959 
work with is one single pencil so to
solve<00:00:11.370> this<00:00:11.490> problem

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
solve this problem

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:13.640 
solve this problem
the<00:00:12.150> clever<00:00:12.389> drafter<00:00:12.809> came<00:00:13.019> up<00:00:13.139> with<00:00:13.290> the<00:00:13.380> idea

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
the clever drafter came up with the idea

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.379 
the clever drafter came up with the idea
of<00:00:13.710> using<00:00:13.889> different<00:00:14.340> types<00:00:14.580> of<00:00:14.759> lines<00:00:14.940> to

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
of using different types of lines to

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:16.580 
of using different types of lines to
represent<00:00:15.809> different<00:00:15.990> things<00:00:16.230> on<00:00:16.560> a

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
represent different things on a

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.740 
represent different things on a
technical<00:00:17.010> drawing<00:00:17.390> when<00:00:18.390> we<00:00:18.480> look<00:00:18.630> at<00:00:18.720> a

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
technical drawing when we look at a

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.900 
technical drawing when we look at a

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
drawing like this all the different line

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.029 
drawing like this all the different line
types<00:00:20.939> can<00:00:21.449> be<00:00:21.510> confusing<00:00:22.020> how<00:00:22.710> do<00:00:22.769> we<00:00:22.890> know

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
types can be confusing how do we know

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:23.960 
types can be confusing how do we know
what<00:00:23.189> each<00:00:23.310> one<00:00:23.519> means

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
what each one means

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.029 
what each one means

and<00:02:29.150> creating<00:02:29.570> drawings<00:02:29.780> you'll<00:02:30.440> be<00:02:30.590> able<00:02:30.680> to

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
and creating drawings you'll be able to

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.410 
and creating drawings you'll be able to
read<00:02:31.010> different<00:02:31.160> types<00:02:31.580> of<00:02:31.760> lines<00:02:31.940> just<00:02:32.239> as

read different types of lines just as

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.440 
read different types of lines just as
easily<00:02:32.600> as<00:02:32.900> you<00:02:32.930> can<00:02:33.170> read<00:02:33.320> a<00:02:33.350> book
