00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.490
 very good to all I am natural and good 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.930
 this is the first video that I'm going to upload 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:12.389
 to the youtube channel and well then according to 

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:15.719
 as the thing goes, I guess it may be 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:18.930
 go uploading the odd video of 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:22.590
 soft gameplay or some boss explaining the 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.750
 functioning or like today's video in 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:28.950
 the one that I 'm going to teach you how to do the 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:31.110
 first post of den of the black alone 

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:34.020
 I think I'm having a problem with 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:37.410
 the program to record and the cursor does not 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:40.540
 they come out in this on the screen but 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.370
 good that already of air fixing what 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:45.220
 the first voice of la negra's lair 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:48.100
 breeze so in the ugly this to be able 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:50.170
 do it alone and for those who do not know 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:53.890
 how it works or what is there 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:56.830
 do you have to take the east orb from 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:59.620
 a lightning bolt control the boss that the 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:02.320
 boss is aggressive while not controlled 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.100
 and destroy the eggs with a skill 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.729
 of the bots 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:10.509
 I'm doing it destroyed so 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:13.580
 I'm going to kill myself I'm going to kill the adss 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:16.910
 valeria only I take the agro 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:20.420
 click on it in the orb and we start 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:23.800
 clean this is walking 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:26.020
 against the stone well 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:29.950
 the functioning of the forest is already very 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:32.890
 simple and has no other 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:35.170
 problem that is what I recommend because 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.210
 soon they will begin to come out 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:40.930
 some schatz that they're going to hit the 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:43.270
 boss is worth then if the boss dies is 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:45.850
 uip in your character automatically 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.590
 I will die for this what I have 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.200
 fact has been to put a focus on the box 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:53.380
 to have a little control of the 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.310
 life that you have left or how you start 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:58.850
 to lower the shots 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.610
 and nothing will see that it is a very mechanical 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.160
 simple 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:08.850
 What I will recommend is 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:10.620
 clean the eggs of the direct 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.500
 of the platform on which the 

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:15.690
 boss instead of taking him around the room 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.270
 maintain an order that this in the end we 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:22.530
 it's going to help, you see, many of 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:24.390
 the arts I only have one here many 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.720
 of the cats go directly to the orb and 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:30.180
 they are hitting my character to noise 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:32.040
 this is quite helpful the boss now 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.570
 and starts to suffer some damage then 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:37.590
 what we are going to do is to withdraw the 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:40.069
 boss and get back to the platform 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:44.030
 with this we will have managed to reduce 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:46.220
 ok I do not like my words 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.500
 with this what sometimes happens is 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:51.900
 that we reduce the agro in the box and 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:56.599
 we got to have some schatz 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.599
 that go to our character then 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:03.430
 basically what happens is that they take the 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:05.879
 slabs and tirana for now for our 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.879
 next ace 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:13.980
 If this does not work, we get off the 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:15.690
 platform and we have some saved but 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.340
 Well I'm going to do it like that I'm going to 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:20.190
 catch like this 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:23.190
 If you look nothing has fallen about me 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:24.550
 40 life cases and the average cleaning 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.760
 room 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:30.290
 if not leaving h 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:33.290
 and well I think the damage can 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:33.290
 keep 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.840
 neither, either 

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:48.800
 I forgot what I was going to say that 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.710
 I was looking at the mobile, you're not 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:55.340
 wait if the first try does not come out or 

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:57.770
 if you die or something this is to take the trick 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.640
 and nothing and me too me 

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:02.700
 cost 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:05.100
 another thing that I was going to tell you my 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:08.940
 character is a tank and it's there 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:10.650
 holding on like a boss but if you have 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:13.709
 a character that is a magician a 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:16.230
 priest or a sorcerer or some cloth or 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:18.060
 a character who does not hold much 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:20.940
 damage that elites can cause 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:22.410
 these that are level 60 or even if 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.300
 You come with a character who is not 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:26.610
 level 90 as may be the case because 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:28.290
 I have come with my paladin to the 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:31.090
 misses 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:34.940
 from farias 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:38.540
 maybe you can not hold the damage 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:40.250
 is going to be easier for you by deactivating 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:42.230
 every now and then and cleaning all 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:43.630
 the platform of h with this what you are going 

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:45.980
 to get is going to be reduce the damage 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:48.560
 well you see that when you destroy all the 

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:50.180
 new data are going outraged and they 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:53.330
 they pull this room and the 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:55.840
 bag and nothing is a combat has 573 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.840
 life cash 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:04.160
 what can have a way of walking and 

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:06.930
 not now 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:10.320
 and nothing 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:10.680
 the boss is going to release you with luck 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.960
 pet 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:15.930
 I do not know if they have really put you shall give the 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:18.900
 pests but I'm climbing the butts 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:22.289
 with him with this from the pnd area let's see 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:24.300
 the light because there seems to be no Yes 

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:25.800
 look look look at how the words other 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:29.039
 time 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:31.710
 and nothing this is all friends I hope that you 

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:36.319
 I liked it and you'll tell me if you want 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:36.319
 some other tutorial or something hooked
