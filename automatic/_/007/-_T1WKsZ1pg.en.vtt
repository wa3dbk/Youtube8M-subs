question<00:00:57.469> now<00:00:58.469> let's<00:00:58.680> look<00:00:58.800> at<00:00:58.890> a<00:00:58.949> simulation

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
question now let's look at a simulation

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.060 
question now let's look at a simulation
which<00:01:00.030> is<00:01:00.149> a<00:01:00.180> simulation<00:01:00.719> of<00:01:00.960> using<00:01:01.410> Autodesk

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
which is a simulation of using Autodesk

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.090 
which is a simulation of using Autodesk
Inventor<00:01:02.520> in<00:01:03.229> this<00:01:04.229> example<00:01:04.619> we're<00:01:04.890> going<00:01:05.010> to

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
Inventor in this example we're going to

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.480 
Inventor in this example we're going to
be<00:01:05.159> looking<00:01:05.400> at<00:01:05.489> creating<00:01:05.909> a<00:01:06.000> sketch<00:01:07.490> again

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
be looking at creating a sketch again

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.789 
be looking at creating a sketch again
the<00:01:09.180> environment<00:01:10.140> looks<00:01:10.320> very<00:01:10.530> much<00:01:10.770> like

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
the environment looks very much like

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.130 
the environment looks very much like
Autodesk<00:01:11.580> Inventor<00:01:11.760> but<00:01:12.330> it's<00:01:12.450> a<00:01:12.540> simulated

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
Autodesk Inventor but it's a simulated

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.850 
Autodesk Inventor but it's a simulated
environment<00:01:15.200> let's<00:01:16.200> go<00:01:16.320> out<00:01:16.439> to<00:01:16.590> Autodesk

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
environment let's go out to Autodesk

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.620 
environment let's go out to Autodesk
Inventor<00:01:17.189> and<00:01:17.700> see<00:01:17.850> some<00:01:18.000> rules<00:01:18.270> that<00:01:18.420> we<00:01:18.600> need

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
Inventor and see some rules that we need

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.469 
Inventor and see some rules that we need
to<00:01:18.869> follow<00:01:19.520> we're<00:01:20.520> going<00:01:20.670> to<00:01:20.729> be<00:01:20.820> using<00:01:21.060> the

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
to follow we're going to be using the

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.020
