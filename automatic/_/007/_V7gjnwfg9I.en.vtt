00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:10.730
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.469
 new video of bags pcs point de 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:16.200
 Today I present you one 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:21.210
 small app from the nokia beta labs 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:24.420
 namely the nokia xpress browsers 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:27.410
 recognize reasonably and we are yes 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:30.720
 even at coffee indicates that we 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:32.610
 886 less data have consumed what 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.570
 that means exactly show you the same 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.960
 with the use 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.550
 how to see are bitter and have now 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.910
 the browser already started the 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:44.239
 express means nokia has come to terms with 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.680
 browser set the goal 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:51.570
 to advance data compression 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:53.940
 this of course less us as customers 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.610
 download data via smartphone too 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.140
 let what is called ultimately 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.230
 needs less data at his 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.059
 datenflat that of course very well and 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.299
 according to nokia be that up to 90 percent 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:11.460
 bring we are shown here 86 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:15.420
 Incidentally, videos do not count 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:17.130
 browser itself works so the dsl 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.440
 connection is first an nokia 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.270
 server redirected 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:23.100
 this can then compress this 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:27.060
 data and continue to the mobile phone 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.710
 I can show two to 90 percent 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.210
 now a few functions and 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:34.500
 that we never get one at the beginning 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:36.930
 left this quick left in the last 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.820
 website did not call that and 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.430
 of course the bag is now 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:46.340
 facebook twitter nokia just the 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:48.900
 different things 2004 magazine 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.040
 magazine means one can still website as 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.320
 download magazine 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.939
 that means you do not necessarily have to be 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.070
 favorite blog or his favorite 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.930
 magazine every time new about that 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:01.829
 calling webinterface has one 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:03.150
 applied on it and presses the journal 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.070
 then maybe you can already see the Sun 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:08.009
 last article in the new atheism 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:10.799
 now also load here by wlan there 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:15.510
 there is nothing very lucky and fast 

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:18.360
 you can also read who is in it now 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:21.090
 browser sends then decayed origin story 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.760
 and i'm im important in the nokia browser 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:27.990
 it's going to be opened completely, that is, now 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:31.880
 not somehow on the internet explorer is 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:34.710
 actually made very nice is back 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:37.740
 I myself pages that there may 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:39.240
 to sites offline Download the 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:41.010
 If you say the title 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:42.960
 Sounds great, but I have it now 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.340
 no time is up for it 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:46.080
 then maybe I'll load up 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:49.050
 quickly the article or the 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.900
 web site down and can then too 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:55.080
 read offline without internet connection 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:57.000
 then this again at quick left 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.860
 few things came to show for example 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.450
 the songs quick left is as well 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:05.180
 few functions of the quick left on 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.180
 standard reset the data you said 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:13.520
 settings here I hope you can 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:15.840
 still look quite good 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:18.350
 I have next to the possibility of the 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:21.180
 Picture quality set here above 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:22.950
 By default, how many times have I got myself 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.260
 put on medium and pictures yet 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:28.650
 actually quite important to me 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:31.230
 say that it is worth the data 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:35.239
 to set the men's magazines or her 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.239
 delete different cages 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:43.950
 Today you still have Beck and built here 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:45.180
 that is not so important nice 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.450
 I think this is actually done here 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:51.030
 The possibility of tabs being closed 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:55.470
 I find internet explorer, however 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:57.690
 almost a bit better here 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.970
 I'll show you I'll give it to me now 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:04.260
 No address deployment development and 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:05.610
 open pocket-pcs tabs and others 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.040
 Unfortunately, functions are not available 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:09.420
 the website loads once there 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:13.019
 one that the app unfortunately still in the beta 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:14.250
 stadium is, however, one has now 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:16.709
 a full screen mode 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:17.669
 that does not mean one of the top fuel unfortunately 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:19.650
 that will not do 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:21.570
 1 2 not the bar down here is 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:23.550
 but can disappear so high 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:25.440
 and you have the right here now 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:28.650
 not just about tabs on the internet 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.580
 explorer has yet eternally long as high and 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:31.750
 pull down 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:43.689
 open other website badly 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:45.729
 maybe we can too 

00:04:43.689 --> 00:04:47.050
 We make it easier again 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:51.240
 better full screen mode 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:51.240
 the college has the option here 

00:04:53.819 --> 00:05:03.250
 march not the action came directly 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:06.759
 then save the page offline 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:08.500
 Share that you can link and 

00:05:06.759 --> 00:05:11.889
 Let zelda translate 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:14.110
 to the start pin or even to the 

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:15.610
 Add a magazine as a magazine in 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:18.219
 keel press there would be one now 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:21.250
 created new magazine but support the 

00:05:18.219 --> 00:05:24.550
 fact how to use apps with tabs here 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:26.800
 The browser is not quite switched off yet 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:29.289
 Sometimes you can tell from the beta stadium 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:32.409
 since he is but one now and then 

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:34.180
 commemoration second needed and not 

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:36.129
 always displays websites correctly 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:39.250
 Nevertheless, I think everything is all in all 

00:05:36.129 --> 00:05:41.020
 that's the express browser of ok here 

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:43.210
 is really cool 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:46.080
 it shows again that nokia itself 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:49.180
 really hard gives his windows phone 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:49.690
 users a better experience too 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:51.460
 Offer 

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:53.469
 a similar feature like that one could 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:55.569
 yes already from the opera mobile on it 

00:05:53.469 --> 00:05:58.930
 windows mobile or many 

00:05:55.569 --> 00:06:00.849
 become users of windows phone 8 

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:02.520
 getting to know the future when the internet 

00:06:00.849 --> 00:06:03.669
 Explorer 10 should use a similar method 

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:05.680
 contain 

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:08.259
 if this, however, on windows phone 7 

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:10.419
 points 8 so the update for the nokia 

00:06:08.259 --> 00:06:12.099
 lumia 800 does not come white yet 

00:06:10.419 --> 00:06:14.050
 compelling nice to know that nokia 

00:06:12.099 --> 00:06:16.360
 here already with epson knowledge supplied 

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:17.949
 they also need the right internet 

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:19.960
 could displace explorer up here 

00:06:17.949 --> 00:06:21.909
 I had no problem with it in principle 

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:23.860
 Unfortunately, it is still in beta stadium feels 

00:06:21.909 --> 00:06:25.060
 me a bit too often, and 

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:26.409
 then a bit too many mistakes 

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:27.969
 However, if it is over then then 

00:06:26.409 --> 00:06:30.879
 i can imagine the internet 

00:06:27.969 --> 00:06:33.940
 By the way, to abolish explorer it too 

00:06:30.879 --> 00:06:37.060
 is still quite noticeable is the thing 

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:38.440
 that people were opinion or until 

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:42.009
 the possession not the intellectual 

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:43.940
 engine there is no html5 test what 

00:06:42.009 --> 00:06:48.360
 otherwise indicated 

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:52.170
 now on it the website then show 

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:54.620
 first time a few words I looked 

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:57.540
 to let that explain now 

00:06:54.620 --> 00:07:01.850
 Colleagues who a bit something with web 

00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:05.610
 development has to do here is available here 

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:06.840
 meanwhile stands by using windows nokia 

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:09.860
 express or windows phone 

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:12.750
 Yesterday it was still that one 

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:15.500
 gecko based browser on a linux 

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:18.360
 system uses it has to do with that 

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:21.030
 this server is running on linux 

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:23.760
 and the browser on the server then 

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:24.360
 before that compresses the gecko engine 

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:27.570
 used 

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:29.520
 that is these points are here 

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:31.230
 Of course I'm right movie browser 

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:34.800
 This browser ultimately sits the 

00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:36.180
 normal html5 normal internet control 

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:38.520
 that's how I got it explained to me 

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:41.250
 However, that just that 

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:44.610
 webserver significantly more protection by the 

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:46.140
 gecko engine owns comes here 

00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:49.680
 Here are more points out than if they were 

00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:51.450
 I have my windows phone browser 

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:53.490
 declare I give no guarantee 

00:07:51.450 --> 00:07:57.420
 that sounds pretty good to me though 

00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:59.790
 plausible and that's why I believe that 

00:07:57.420 --> 00:08:02.610
 now simply and I hope has 

00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:04.770
 small video pleased to nokia xpress 

00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:06.180
 browser is also single beta he does 

00:08:04.770 --> 00:08:08.520
 In any case, really nice fun 

00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:10.440
 I hope I have the video like it 

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:12.720
 gives thumbs thumbs up looking at the 

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:16.850
 block over gives feedback and writes 

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:16.850
 comments that's it
