00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:08.610
 the battery at a vip alone eight 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.980
 I have already changed the whole thing 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.420
 apply prepared small winter 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:17.510
 It's easy to explain something 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:20.039
 alone at the beginning one starts with it 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:20.850
 unscrew the housing cover needs to 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.029
 you have a small spot head 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.920
 screwdriver tackling width 15 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.619
 millimeter with which you can get the four 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.710
 Loosen overhead screws and then 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:34.050
 looking down the bottom of the housing looks down 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.690
 a good idea to watch it directly into the 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.000
 the clockwork always has something in the finger 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.680
 housing to fix in particular if 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.600
 you go out and do not worry about that 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.820
 now blurs a small sticker 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.890
 to in the first from here are 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.469
 small rubber block still take the 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.989
 last year on some tours we go 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.219
 a bit difficult since quite a good one 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.140
 finger here for example also the 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.250
 to put the vibration motor and the clock 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.329
 to fix something 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:04.080
 so now we have our battery here 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:07.979
 hold on the clip we push on 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.840
 one side to the other 8 it 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.320
 is not one only in one direction 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.350
 other 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:16.140
 it's blocked here so it's only possible 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:18.470
 could have pushed in this direction 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:22.190
 we raise and on this page 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:24.470
 take out accordingly 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.210
 We only have to do that now 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.970
 battery also take out this, remember 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:31.520
 think the clock bit, the motion 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:37.220
 Fix a bit in the housing and the 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:40.310
 watch and battery remove his cr 2032 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:44.090
 Battery and take an old 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:48.860
 Just have a look at it 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:52.610
 something tight you see liquidated too 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:56.780
 with the short life of the migrations 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:02:00.770
 motors let's see you there a little 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:03.820
 can raised small increases so that 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.050
 the battery clip hangs flat 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.490
 and 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:11.270
 against the battery 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:14.530
 old bracket here again the side something 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.530
 insert at an angle 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.950
 rhein lies 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:23.349
 and for example the screwdriver 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.349
 press this side in 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:32.750
 overwritten so also a small 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.040
 a little bit 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.680
 that is already done now we take 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:42.460
 us again the little rubber klotz or 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:48.120
 because against this in here 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:48.120
 the stickers put stickers on it 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:55.810
 that was short to test before 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:59.950
 press all four buttons at the clock 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.950
 this turns off the clock 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:06.120
 switched off 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:10.610
 wait as a customer 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.610
 times press vibration motor 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.170
 that also means that all four buttons 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:18.780
 no work is stuck 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.490
 Now we can do the the housing cover 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.580
 take again and hang up again 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:25.410
 Make sure that he the font 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:28.800
 From the same direction you on the 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:32.550
 front side that is if up here up to 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:35.600
 the bottom is the same on the 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:37.870
 be back like that and not here 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:41.200
 the writing on the head 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:45.640
 know mistakes often made that be 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:48.040
 no matter is set again so the 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:51.970
 in turn 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:53.900
 and put the lid on 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:55.610
 so 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:58.900
 now only the four have to screw 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:58.900
 be used again 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.480
 and the battery change is done 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.870
 to see her
