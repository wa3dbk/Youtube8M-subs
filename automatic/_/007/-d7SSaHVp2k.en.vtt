00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:15.770
 hello pokémon fronts one on the map 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.690
 francisco also known as nerd in 

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:20.300
 and welcome to my first video 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:23.779
 top 5 where opinions mingle with the 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:26.420
 fox and 36- year-old pathways that were 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:28.100
 first game pokémon the pokémon go 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:31.340
 although he has played for several years 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:33.050
 and to be a senior fao ceo 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.300
 number of pokémon addicts that I am 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.190
 today there were certain things of the pokémon 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.350
 wide angle and simultaneously in 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.360
 I hoped that I never realized that anyone 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:44.180
 In my school, you know the answer. 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:46.250
 today almost 13 years says that if the 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.710
 game already has some answers to 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:52.960
 some of these issues, so the 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.960
 damage five questions about pokémon 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.730
 during the almost 13 years that the pokémon 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.410
 but that some changes in physiognomy 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.690
 of some pokémon 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.489
 the changes are more remarkable as the 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:07.100
 change color of the tim if black rice 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.930
 for reasons we all know and another 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.000
 space perceived as the change of the 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.560
 number of cars they serve today have 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.960
 for generations 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.330
 but the change that more attention a time 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.640
 day before the pokémon involved is also 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:22.340
 is that you always know how to speak 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.740
 obviously application and super defense 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:27.229
 this change to have more attention in the anime 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.280
 but also happened in the game pokémon 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:30.229
 goiania go 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.210
 the mincemeat was significantly more 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:35.060
 such as the first episodes of the 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:37.640
 anime and even loads at porto manuela 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.770
 pikachu appears to already be leaner in 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.869
 previous games and is losing weight and 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.680
 gradually until the games of the third 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:44.540
 generation 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.299
 but ultimately because one of the complicated 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:49.070
 according to the animé designers the reasons 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:51.590
 to change due to iptu 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.630
 end facility being thinner by 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.450
 be more beautiful and to be more 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:59.479
 easy to design your emissions with this 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.770
 I mean how app was fat it was 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:06.170
 harder to show your income 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:09.430
 and so had to slim down phase 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.430
 also just destroyed 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.790
 Since I started playing Pokemon 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.260
 fantasy has become one of the only 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.630
 more life companions 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.450
 at least when it comes to games because 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:23.460
 the anime less and less betrays me because 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.590
 because of the air 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:27.390
 the fact of staying a child ten years 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.180
 who has not showered for almost two decades 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.400
 Does with kone and pokémon has this 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.990
 feeling team every month 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.670
 but because it gives two does not change 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:37.470
 ask you guys good 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.410
 the most plausible answer is co-director 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:42.420
 of the southern maximum anime and give here will keep the 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.190
 protagonist of the program but only with 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.230
 the same age as me to see or 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.810
 children around the age of 10 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.250
 although it makes sense so be it for 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.210
 ensure that the new generations have 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.220
 Pokémon 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:55.800
 do not let that eventually be 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.870
 trend changes a few months I was pro the air 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.100
 special pokémon corinthians in which the 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.110
 story revolves around the plot 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:02.880
 now enveloped in which the 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.830
 themselves were the protagonists and 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.230
 honestly it was one of the best things 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:08.790
 that pokémon company bp was until the 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.190
 genre is being made more 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.470
 that the animals may be the 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:15.989
 protagonists of games such as manga 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.340
 what would be quite interesting such 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:19.860
 as was evident at the time 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.330
 black white 26 thousand who threw leash 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:24.170
 with the game characters to print 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:24.170
 food 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:29.820
 when I started playing my Pokemon 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.530
 first because monitors pokemon string 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:33.300
 that still has time to choose today 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.489
 as the others 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:37.680
 unlike me a lot of 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:39.450
 my friends you think it's best to include 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.300
 the fire program that was on the cover of 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:44.040
 old pokémon to use but knew that 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:45.870
 despite being a starter in use 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.870
 Any place inside can not learn 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:50.700
 the fly feel this possibility that I am 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.720
 one of the many critics who find themselves 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.880
 in these games 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.800
 The only remaining question is whether it was 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.420
 forgetting and four in franc 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:59.820
 You're one of the bookstores so to speak. 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:01.950
 with everyone else this error was 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:03.660
 corrected pokémon yellow and theorize 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:06.120
 use fai since then 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:08.220
 it's still quite fun fact 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.080
 we have strong city ​​in town a little 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.880
 higher because as pj which has 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.920
 literally the classification than in the 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:15.810
 past Pokémon and we can not play in the 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:19.850
 dragon that is not cool that has as 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:19.850
 brand image fly 

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:25.110
 we are nearing the end of this list and 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.340
 from here the questions are more 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.050
 what answers 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.970
 this question we will only have a mother since 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:31.949
 small and has no idea how it is that 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:34.770
 this works how the pokémon of the 

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:36.240
 President both original games do not 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:38.490
 there is any reference to how 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:40.500
 pokémon of the first of this year and unique 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:41.970
 sure that we have is co diemanno 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:43.830
 means machine 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:46.199
 I think that has something to do as 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:47.940
 free pokémon fred life 

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:50.009
 we know that this year is the end 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:52.020
 cds which will honestly only make it worse 

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:54.180
 situation because if we can think 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.810
 which was a logical way of learning and 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.400
 taxi 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:59.250
 how much more do you spend on your 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:02.099
 tummy finally there goes the logic 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:03.960
 My whole theory is to get it working. 

00:05:02.099 --> 00:05:05.240
 like a book and from the moment when 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:09.800
 get in touch with pokémon 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:16.319
 information straws chopsticks and things 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:18.180
 situations and here we come to the moment 

00:05:16.319 --> 00:05:20.460
 in which it reveals more doubt that there is 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:22.050
 about the kimono such a big doubt 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:24.240
 according to a study done by the 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:25.860
 that eight out of ten people pee 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:29.130
 in the pants thinking about her 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:31.469
 I'm talking about digrad let's be 

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:33.120
 sincere press 

00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:34.590
 I've never had problems with my feet in the 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:36.990
 ground because mondo as much as they say 

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:38.190
 It's as if I keep my face. 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:40.289
 like who pooped 

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:42.690
 another window that anything with this 

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:45.389
 but the club is on another level 

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:47.250
 it is nothing but a sausage under the 

00:05:45.389 --> 00:05:49.620
 earth but what really makes me 

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:52.560
 confusion and sabotage code writing 

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:54.150
 Because you do not know means to win and if you 

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:57.090
 I remember again that you have any 

00:05:54.150 --> 00:06:00.060
 thing for bad things of the hand thing 

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:02.099
 Who says plan is worse when I say 

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:04.349
 active and multiplies by three and 

00:06:02.099 --> 00:06:07.740
 curiously the three together know the 

00:06:04.349 --> 00:06:10.590
 classics as a hotel is chosen 

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:12.539
 but earth is not not as the point 

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:15.180
 to prove an episode of the anime is that the 

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:21.569
 block in the trio and it was really just that the 

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:23.069
 which was a can of sausages to the project 

00:06:21.569 --> 00:06:24.270
 I hope you have enjoyed this video one 

00:06:23.069 --> 00:06:26.729
 little in front of this virus usually 

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:28.830
 make inverted stream share 

00:06:26.729 --> 00:06:30.539
 with you this list because you probably 

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:31.410
 many of you also have the same 

00:06:30.539 --> 00:06:33.819
 doubts 

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:35.530
 Before finishing, I would like to thank you. 

00:06:33.819 --> 00:06:38.259
 the doc by hunter was also in the new 

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:40.060
 channel have not heard from a view of 

00:06:38.259 --> 00:06:42.449
 eyes and also see the tank channel 

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:44.470
 when he posted a video make bad 

00:06:42.449 --> 00:06:45.430
 liked the video they want to know how much 

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:47.770
 to the next 

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:50.560
 subscribed and destined in social networks 

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:54.569

 Thank you for watching and until the next
