00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:06.000
 when I go to London the first stop is 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.189
 rigorously camden town I love to lose myself 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.679
 between the rights of stalls go to 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.420
 drink a few feints in the packed pubs of 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.210
 Saturday afternoon fans and of course 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.039
 tear garmin streetfood the winter 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.420
 last I was looking for a hot meal and 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.730
 I was persuaded by a 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.840
 very kind Chinese cook who wanted me 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.510
 let them taste what they were 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.240
 cooking result i sat it has it 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.859
 did it all and I have done well a 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:31.699
 noodles with marinated beef and vegetables 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.699
 this is my version 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.690
 let's start with marinating meat 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.510
 this is a marinade he uses 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.680
 often both in the pan and on the grill 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.470
 let's cut the meat a 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.470
 cutlets first cut in half 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.850
 thin shot 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.500
 inside 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.250
 meat in oven-proof sesame oil 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:25.150
 after the fat part we add 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:25.150
 sability soy sauce a peppery 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.679
 crush a clove of garlic 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.560
 and a generous grated ginger 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:37.560
 fresh 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.440
 we are going to recover a fault 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.710
 now we use the tools that 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:49.130
 you need more hands cooking e 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.130
 mix 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:56.230
 it's always nice to get dirty every now and then 

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:57.880
 hands in the kitchen ready 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:59.950
 we cover with film we leave it 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.590
 rest a half hour maximum one hour 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:05.850
 so the flavors inside the pan 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.850
 they will know each other 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:12.090
 in my well-stocked fridge or already 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.090
 marinated beef 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:24.530
 the work is already on fire so beef will have 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.530
 that crust I like so much 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:34.859
 this is the noise that must be heard 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:38.209
 the work is incandescent it will cook the beef 

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:38.209
 the maximum minute 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:45.250
 comes a shot of ginger garlic 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.380
 that you can't understand 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:52.080
 all the meat must have this 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:52.080
 crust here don't take it off first 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:01.180
 look there is no trace of 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.510
 liquid in the pan we can remove it 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.680
 tac 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:08.680
 we turn off the heat and put the beef a 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.680
 rest 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:12.930
 hey presto 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:17.489
 blocked with pro so film remains 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:20.390
 nice tender our beef is ready 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:20.390
 let's turn to vegetables 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:36.660
 cut the red pepper into thin layers 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:46.440
 free veal or even green chilli 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:49.560
 sweet now what a trick to remove the seeds 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:55.040
 we bet we cut our heads off 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:55.040
 zac we are going to lose all the seeds 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:00.280
 had to cut diagonally that becomes 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:00.280
 an oriental touch 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.060
 and away with each other 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:17.219
 carrot first half then striped and then a 

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:17.219
 chopsticks 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:23.300

 go with a little soy sauce 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:52.910
 I don't want to cook three shots three minutes 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:55.990
 I want to keep them crunchy now 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:55.990
 I just have to throw the pasta 

00:05:03.319 --> 00:05:08.310

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:10.440
 minutes to cook at four I remove them in 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:12.650
 meanwhile rekindle the fire of the 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.650

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:21.080

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:43.700

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:48.710
