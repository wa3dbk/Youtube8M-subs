00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:10.410
 Mom today I suggest you count 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:13.230
 how many times replacements would be praised and hugged 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.599
 your child if you scold more often than 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.680
 brag need urgently change strategy 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.470
 education 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:22.540
 education without punishment is quite possible 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.460
 just show the child an example 

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:27.130
 correct behavior and do not require 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:29.230
 do not create it yourself 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.600
 for a child such an environment in which not 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:33.610
 will be places punishment example to 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.680
 baby did not break your dear things immediately 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.840
 hide them away so as not to 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.120
 naughty in line or transport 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.850
 prepare a new game in advance or 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:45.220
 toy and the method still works well 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:46.720
 family rules need to say that 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:49.449
 now our family will be like this 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:52.360
 rule ask each member's consent 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:53.710
 families do they agree to do this 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.960
 rule because rules must 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:59.470
 run run by all members 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.989
 families when we do something 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:05.570
 beloved by some occupation 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:09.290
 it doesn't matter if you are an application or this 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:12.310
 sewing mom or something else you need 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:15.200
 put all objects in place 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.280
 to raise a child without punishment 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.340
 first you need to learn 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.320
 control your anger and emotions here 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.750
 some tips from a psychologist 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:26.210
 if you want to slap the child urgently 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:29.300
 take something in hand first 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:31.430
 you need to take your eyes off the child because 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.530
 that when you look at the child and in 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:35.330
 these negative ones are boiling over here 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.729
 emotions immediately want to do something 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:39.380
 that is, let off steam but at this moment and 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:42.580
 should just give yourself 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:45.259
 it is possible to calm down not to punish immediately 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:47.330
 By the way there are punishments that are still 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:50.060
 can be used in raising children 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.810
 This is a temporary deprivation of sweet viewing 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.090
 tv 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.340
 cancellation of scheduled entertainment 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.860
 then the baby understands that he did not get something 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.060
 what I wanted precisely because I did not do that 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.850
 that he was asked 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:04.369
 this is called the implications method and yet 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.179
 praise more often just passing 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:08.269
 abandoned 

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:09.289
 Well done here is not enough for me today 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:12.880
 I'm proud of you 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:16.010
 what could you remove right away 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:18.260
 you are great because you are right away 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.060
 for a cleaned we constantly emphasize 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:23.329
 at the time of promotion 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:26.000
 moment of praise we emphasize action 

00:02:23.329 --> 00:02:32.480
 and introduce praise immediately after 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:34.370
 executed action the punishment is 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.980
 pedagogical technique which is not at all 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:39.049
 renders educational action if 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.459
 you punish the baby again and again he 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:42.829
 becomes either too 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:45.650
 compliant either through chur and prem 

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:47.870
 sometimes even a stylish baby whose 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:50.570
 often punishes can't control 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.629
 their behavior and waiting for control with 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:55.629
 adult sides
