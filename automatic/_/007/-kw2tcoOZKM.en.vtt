00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:01.180
 curves 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:03.310
 for the people who have other stones 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.020
 Seated who do not know what you are what you are 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:06.330

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:08.860

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:16.630
 yes fashion shop was only for women 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:20.170
 no men and I have that store 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:25.210
 36 years now and I have never had the 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:27.580
 ambition to have 36 years of clothes to be real 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:30.430
 to propose something in fashion 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:33.700
 but I'm completely fed up with the blue out of the blue 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:36.280
 started and yes that was from the beginning 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:39.100
 successful and then you are in a mill and 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.320
 yes that mill turns and then turns 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:44.320
 we ever agree yes then what do you expect from it 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:47.259
 you like your staff and expertise there 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:50.680
 so a woman in her mid- fifty if necessary 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:52.510
 a very open very tight dress 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.799
 I wanted to of mine 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:56.110
 Staff members 

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:58.640
 that they say that what is not a good course 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:01.310
 or as a madam of 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:04.009
 55 if necessary 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:07.939
 very skinny pants you want to wear and that 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:10.310

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:14.000
 employees that they say really 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:15.980
 not allowed and that had something more for it 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.660
 if you are very young or if you go to the 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.620
 fashion jewelry or so but not to it 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.120
 look nice 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.860
 maybe now superfluous ask me are you 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:26.120
 from the boat to call the velvet 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:29.269

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:35.569

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:50.989
 if you wish everyone if you have one 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:52.790
 garment was allowed to divide into each 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:54.409
 case something that didn't fit small too 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:59.170
 is tight and too short 

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:59.170
 yes really that one associates 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:04.790
 shortage of clothes often with yo 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:07.310
 it is thought that makes young and that is 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.659
 the biggest mistake 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:10.669

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:12.859

 a little more focus there i am kia optima 

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:19.099
 hope for years that the 

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:20.930
 too small too tight to expose and too short 

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:22.549
 that's the biggest mistake that people make 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:24.049

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:25.400
