00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.599
 twin oil scorpion 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.170

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:41.409
 character 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:45.939
 my character basically tells 

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:49.120
 of any girl who goes into 

00:02:45.939 --> 00:02:50.739
 this school headmaster tour that 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.090
 listen, you don't have to look at cameras 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:55.209
 directly she is one of the protagonists 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:58.180
 the first seems right in this 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:03:00.489
 movies there are so many good actors but there 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.200
 they are also dogs that do not act 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:04.230
 make things wrong with my actors for 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.010
 please then we have even 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:09.269
 an exclusive because I just met 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.269
 an international actor 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.280
 I know he sees them from far away 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:25.750
 even to shoot this film there 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.600
 tell a little about your character 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:35.410
 then from far away I am from the film 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:39.490
 my name is kevin he is a very young boy 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:43.180
 similar to me nice solar and if there 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:45.070
 will see a bit with a steffy girl who 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.320
 you will know after my character yes 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:49.420
 called steffy and is a little girl 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:50.800
 In love with her friend, it is not clear 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:53.290
 because he does everything for him 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:56.490
 or I'll take that orecchiette tele 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:56.490
 put in place of the knees 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:06.670
 already from the first scenes we shot 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:09.550
 I was bursting out to laugh it was almost 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:12.370
 impossible not to laugh on the set anyway 

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:15.819
 tells about this girl who goes with 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:18.370
 other students on this school trip 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:21.760
 here is how the actors prepare before 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:23.620
 to shoot the scenes of the film but among all 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.840
 these young filmmakers 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:27.160
 look a bit i found good morning 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.430
 then two character keywords 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:32.050
 I'm in the movie I'm a boy 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:35.290
 pretty nice the best friend of 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:37.120
 kevin is I enjoy myself when I turn and the 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:39.490
 think this is the important thing 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:42.100
 I'm glad I attended this 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:43.720
 yet another umpteenth driving effort 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:46.120
 milani got me involved in this 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:48.850
 beautiful movie in 53 a movie 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:50.890
 where we especially enjoy hopefully 

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:53.260
 to entertain the only thing that is 

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:55.930
 was very difficult was to 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:58.330
 of ugliness because it is the character 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:00.520
 this professor must be not handsome 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:02.139
 which I interpret and make-up artists 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:04.210
 you really are damned for 

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:06.340
 become ugly at the neck 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:08.590
 I assure you that there will be short of 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:10.510
 funny hilarious situations with i 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:12.250
 protagonists with the professors they are 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:14.050
 everything except serious teachers 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:15.430
 obviously and there will be laughter me 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:17.020
 I recommend watching the movie there will be 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:19.720
 so much snow is so much 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:21.520
 lots of fun and above all one 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:24.789
 deficient but I am convinced that you will understand 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:26.919
 Who then I have only one teacher 

00:05:24.789 --> 00:05:30.310
 furthermore we could not give up this 

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:33.569
 film because in short I drive has covered us 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:33.569
 golden and gave us a lot of money 

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:47.889

 because it makes us feel good about us 

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:25.620

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:27.060
 spectacular way enjoyed to do
