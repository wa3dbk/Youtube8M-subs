00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:05.650
 this is ideal paint 

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:10.530
 welcome to paint ideas today 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.990
 let's learn how to make these beautiful 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.780
 flowers made with bottles of 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.600
 pet plastic take note of the 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.230
 materials that we are going to use bottles 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.580
 of plastic pet that you want to reuse 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:28.020
 stained glass plates of your color 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:30.930
 preference a dropper or a brush and 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:32.669
 solvent for the capital if not 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:36.230
 you find lacquer for stained glass 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:38.690
 you can use permanent markers 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:43.730
 alcohol and the button 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:48.960
 an instant wire glue candle 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:50.720
 Galvanized 14 calipers and pliers 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.120
 scissors 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.620
 a template of flowers that you can 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.020
 find on our facebook page 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:00.020
 or also through our mail 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:03.130
 electronic if you're ready with your 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:05.260
 materials then hands to the work 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:07.630
 and we're going to start shaping this 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:11.440
 flower that is composed of two parts 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:14.500
 an external part that is transparent and 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.480
 the inner part that will take color and 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.060
 as a stem we use a wire 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:20.549
 galvanized 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.470
 The first thing we are going to do is prepare 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.500
 the material to be able to shape 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.360
 our flower we are going to reuse this 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.240
 soda bottle that is plastic 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.850
 pt and let's remove the ends of the 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.679
 bottle and others these lines to 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.130
 identify where we are going to do the 

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:37.130
 cut 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.899
 we remove the ends because these 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.729
 pieces we are not going to use them and we are going to 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:50.090
 work with this piece because it's the 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:51.829
 smoothest part of the bottle and by the 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.439
 part where the glue of the 

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:57.710
 label let's make a cut shape 

00:01:54.439 --> 00:02:00.400
 vertical in this way we have more 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:03.220
 space to work 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.560
 since the piece is cut make sure 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:07.870
 to wash it before you start using it 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.240
 with our plastic ready we are going to 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:12.190
 start working with the template the 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:15.310
 biggest flower will serve to give 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:17.110
 shape to the outside of the flower and 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.390
 for the part inside that is the one 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:22.210
 Wear the color we will use the flower more 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:25.330
 small we put the piece of plastic 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:28.030
 about our template and with the help of 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:30.510
 a down we're going to transfer the design to 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.510
 plastic 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.510
 when it's over, we're just going to 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.510
 cut them out 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:41.540
 since our pieces are cut 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:44.510
 let's clean the down that was left 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:46.609
 marking of the outline of the figure for 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:50.200
 wake him up we're just going to use a 

00:02:46.609 --> 00:02:50.200
 little alcohol and a cotton 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:01.379
 our pieces are now clean and now 

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:03.360
 let's color the small flower the 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:06.090
 first action is to do it using the 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:08.190
 pet plastic that already has color the 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.319
 Next option is to use lacquer to 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:12.450
 vitar that you can find it in 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:14.819
 craft stores or where they sell 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.590
 art material and there is a great 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:18.660
 variety of colors that I will use 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.480
 the Red color 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.910
 to apply it you can use a dropper 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.890
 or a brush 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:29.340
 I prefer to use the dropper because it 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:31.920
 waste less material we take a 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:35.740
 small amount and we are applying 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:37.960
 small drops through the entire flower 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:40.450
 you have to try to cover the entire area 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:43.660
 but being careful not to get to 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:45.700
 the shore to prevent it from dripping is 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:48.220
 important that when you work with the 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:50.880
 capital do it in a space very well 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.880
 ventilated 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:57.209
 when you finish applying it, let it dry 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:00.239
 about 15 minutes and you can apply the 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:02.400
 next layer applies the layers that are 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:05.310
 necessary until you get the color 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:07.019
 desired when you finish working not 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.390
 forget to clean your utensils 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:12.360
 using solvent for the cut hipo 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:15.660
 stained glass without finding the lacquer you can 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:18.209
 use permanent markers 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:20.220
 I'm going to use the red color so 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:23.520
 we can compare it with what we did 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:25.500
 with the capital this option is very simple 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:28.020
 you just have to be careful not to stay 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:31.320
 unpainted spaces 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:33.480
 we have finished painting our flower 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:36.360
 when we compared with the part to be 

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:38.730
 painted with stained glass lacquer we can see 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:41.250
 that the lacquer gives it a bright appearance 

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:43.830
 since it tries to mimic the appearance of 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:47.100
 glass and the one that is painted with down 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:49.260
 The following appears more opaque 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:52.020
 step is going to be to shape the petals 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:55.050
 of our flower for that we're going to 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:58.530
 learn our candle we take our 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:05:01.110
 flower we approach the flame trying to 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:04.320
 leave about 4 centimeters away 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:06.390
 between the flame and the plastic if 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:08.760
 you get too close to the flame you run the 

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:10.710
 risk that the plastic burns this 

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:12.450
 it would make it acquire a dark color what 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:15.420
 that would make it useless for our 

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:17.490
 project to start to shape it happens 

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:20.570
 slightly the petal over the fire 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:22.890
 the plastic will start to deform 

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:25.320
 use your fingers to mold it 

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:27.650
 while it's hot just have a lot 

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:29.750
 Be careful not to burn yourself 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:32.270
 make all the petals bend 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:34.520
 nations or the address and you do not 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:37.250
 worry because each petal is the same 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:40.780
 or is perfect because we look for 

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:40.780
 all have an irregular appearance 

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:52.160
 and to shape the smallest flower 

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:54.770
 we're just going to pass each petal 

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:56.780
 lightly on the fire trying that 

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:59.840
 all bend to one direction 

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:02.390
 and that are together or as closed 

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:05.360
 possible so that in the end they have the 

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:07.820
 appearance in a small cocoon once 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:10.660
 that is ready we can place it inside 

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:10.660
 of the largest piece 

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:20.330
 and finally we are going to place your stem 

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:22.970
 cut a piece of galvanized wire 

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:24.860
 I cut it by 50 centimeters because the 

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:28.070
 vase where I will place them is a 

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:30.350
 little high you choose the measure that is most 

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:34.120
 match your needs 

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:34.120
 together the center of both flowers 

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:41.800
 heat one end of the wire 

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:44.140
 and it goes through both pieces keeps 

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:46.540
 Stable the wire and wait until 

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:49.300
 cool the plastic 

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:52.660
 reinforces the joints with a little tail 

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:54.940
 crazy or instant glue when there 

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:57.430
 completely dried the glue will be 

00:06:54.940 --> 00:07:00.700
 ready our flowers make them 

00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:02.680
 different sizes and colors and cheer up 

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:05.490
 do many so you can brother a 

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:05.490
 cute floral arrangement
