 Hello people today I want to show who you have your PlayStation 3 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:15.650
 what it takes is removable disk so USB or PSP 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:18.650
 I'll do Twitter now 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.999
 and most of the time especially the three points 5 

00:00:24.999 --> 00:00:28.220
 and that covers the patch 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.220
 in the underlying video b divorce 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:34.950
 and probably also Jemal 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.950
 here system as read 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.440
 Cacau registered shares settlement 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.130
 Data Source 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:45.150
 Daun knows it 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:47.340
 Place found here 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.340
 the finds does 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.940
 now more could be needed now also stay okay empty 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:59.950
 he is 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:02.640
 install so cover or package 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.030
 but I do not do it because it has not yet found the meaning of the thing 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:11.350
 Jesus can be done later, there are no Jesus 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.770
 and trouble from the game is not Muscat moments 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:21.990
 he sees fourth Pecker before well so before we have to clarify it knows 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.450
 I do not give yet 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.690
 because of group Sony PlayStation 3 with Cacau 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.050
 therefore 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:30.590
 I leave the matter 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.780
 first so 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.240
 yes with questions instead of when 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.050
 if anything is unclear 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:42.120

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.040

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:53.770
