00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:07.810
 my name is generic einstein and I am 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:07.810
 be 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:37.090
 with the tests we perform we reduce 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:39.470
 at 20% the probability of serious damage 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:42.710
 as can be the impact of leg 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:44.660
 hip impact and head impact a 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:48.290
 vehicle is a great compromise between a 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:50.089
 very nice design and security from 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:51.620
 the technical center we made many 

00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:54.379
 tests for safety 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:56.420
 we make shocks at low speed and 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:58.449
 high speed that can reach 64 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:01.280
 kilometers per hour we also do 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:03.559
 belt starts movements of 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:06.000
 text and movements of doors between 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:08.310
 many other tests 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.530
 after this test we analyze the 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.770
 results and we look at what impact has 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.330
 the car to the parts of the human body 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.640
 on the basis of that we value if they are needed 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.050
 of modifications in the car and from time to time 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.760
 in when we got to have 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:22.760
 modifications of a few millimeters 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:27.290
 maybe people do not know but behind 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.660
 a bumper behind a bonnet there is 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:31.070
 many security elements an example 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:33.560
 is the foam for the protection of 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.780
 pedestrians but there are many more elements 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.270
 that absorb the energy in case of a 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.219
 impact 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.229
 What I like the most about my work is the 

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:42.969
 deal with the large number of people 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:45.909
 involved in the development of a micro 

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:48.990
 here we are almost a thousand people and that makes 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:50.850
 that my day to day is very big 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.100
 I think the future car in terms of 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.229
 safety will be a car capable of 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.090
 completely avoid accidents 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.490
 that means that it will be equipped with 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.380
 accident detection systems and 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.600
 with systems that change the 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.350
 speed or the trajectory of the car 's 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.350
 autonomous form
