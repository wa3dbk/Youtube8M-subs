 part when using the trunk on 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:57.640
 the roof should be placed in it whenever possible

 movement is not enough just to stick 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:14.200
 traffic rules within 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:16.390
 determine the rules for yourself

 speed limit that will be for you 

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:21.519
 comfortable after all long habits 

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:23.440
 movement on completely legal 100 120 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:26.110
 kilometers per hour can cause 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:28.390
 premature fatigue but also severely 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:31.240
 break out of traffic 

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:33.610
 moving too slowly is not worth you 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.860
 will often overtake that does not contribute 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.780
 security 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:39.840
 move mostly by day or night 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:42.360
 every driver decides for himself on the road 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:44.580
 more loaded but easier to notice those 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.240
 or other obstacles in the dark 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:47.909
 days 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:50.340
 fewer cars but more likely 

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:53.069
 miss a dangerous pit or the right one 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:55.439
 turn from y and trite doze off 

00:04:53.069 --> 00:04:57.360
 driving a big city drives you 

00:04:55.439 --> 00:04:59.729
 you will need to decide you are passing 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:02.219
 through it or go around the spring 

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:05.099
 if you donâ€™t rush too much 

00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:06.659
 recommend visiting some museums either 

00:05:05.099 --> 00:05:09.360
 same sights well firstly 

00:05:06.659 --> 00:05:11.819
 this is a rest for the driver and secondly you 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:13.979
 it's unlikely to just be like that and call in 

00:05:11.819 --> 00:05:15.750
 certain cities for safe 

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:18.900
 driving driver of medium qualification 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:20.279
 every 2-3 hours you need to stop 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:22.620
 for a short break 

00:05:20.279 --> 00:05:24.719
 By the way, many modern cars 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:27.539
 know how to determine the degree of fatigue 

00:05:24.719 --> 00:05:29.250
 driver and gives the appropriate signal 

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:32.219
 on the dashboard 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:34.889
 a cup of coffee juice cookies it can be 

00:05:32.219 --> 00:05:37.740
 a good reason to change a quarter of an hour 

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:39.900
 before your eyes and picture of the situation 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:42.150
 Katia Ukrainian roads this time not 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:44.339
 the best so if you decide 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:46.919
 give up car ride this 

00:05:44.339 --> 00:05:49.409
 would be appropriate in any case if 

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:51.869
 do you want to travel with a car 

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:54.539
 resort to trailer services price 

00:05:51.869 --> 00:05:57.149
 the place is commensurate with the fuel consumption and 

00:05:54.539 --> 00:06:00.139
 Of course, take care of yourself and your loved ones 

00:05:57.149 --> 00:06:00.139
 to new meetings
