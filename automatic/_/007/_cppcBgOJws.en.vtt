00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:08.689
 here we present a positive 

00:00:08.689 --> 00:00:14.429
 realize that to heat is necessary the protein air passed to the surface of 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.429
 membrane or cabin in the engine 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:22.630
 we know that type-A blood does not receive type b blood because of 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:24.610
 presence of anti-rh antibodies 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:27.610
 or also called taguatinga 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:29.919
 the boot 

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:35.280
 then we have to the positive it is positive because because that rh has to 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.090
 positive 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.539
 due to the protein 

00:00:37.539 --> 00:00:39.260
 present in its membrane 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:44.910
 david the fh positive protein present on the surface give is marcia 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:50.130
 the negative air you should send to the presence of air continues today in the air or 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:55.290
 protein in your membrane R presence well and routine that is an antibody came out 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.310
 really 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:03.450
 we have the following no protein for the positive rh so that it is 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.430
 negative is to water negative 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.380
 but for those who have negative rh 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.380
 the presence of antibodies against 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.070
 only for the negative phenotype, remembering that these antibodies 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:23.860
 either grasping will only be produced after a first contact with the blood 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:25.350
 positive 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.850
 the positive 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.220
 have no agglutinating or genius no multimarking in the air nor agglutinating 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.470
 miguel positive because on its mother membrane surface it had 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.050
 protein into the air and give positive 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:41.810
 there is no there then 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:47.829
 the flywheel is to pick up as antibodies once it had fante rh 

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:50.999
 could the routine his own blood 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:57.049
 biden life absence of u given to guti now in the air another protein and 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:02.170
 protein allows the production of antibodies to cotinine combing is the 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:03.730
 routine 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:04.770
 for blood 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.220
 the positive 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:07.550
 or negative 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:13.400
 is known as a donor of seeing salt by the fact of its membrane darci of that is from there 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.070
 marcia 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:16.450
 sixth with 24 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:17.480
 without any 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.640
 protein without the protein air without protein b and without the factor protein 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:28.319
 fh why the a negative is known as universal donor ' 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:33.060
 then not the protein for the positive rh not the protein for air and 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.219
 nor is it a protein for blood b 

00:02:35.219 --> 00:02:39.229
 but he still persists gutiina santiago 

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:42.259
 the routine anticipates 

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:45.389
 produces the antibodies ltr h 

00:02:45.889 --> 00:02:47.459
 that this should only be 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:53.170
 to the negative phenotypes then the negative or zeroing is the blood the blood 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.919
 0 due to it had nothing to its membrane surface 

00:02:57.919 --> 00:02:59.749
 we were born are many
