00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:04.650
 so first, why would you need 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.480
 follow the arena considering what you 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.340
 will constantly control it 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.559
 the amount of your concentration before 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.040
 burst to you sounds of course very simple but 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.900
 this is an important basic thing 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:18.180
 the second most important thing is the presence of buff 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.580
 steady concentration is certainly not in 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.920
 all matches you can get it if 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.930
 you will make it a huge plus and so 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.580
 we start our course with a chimera shot 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.500
 very important to maintain 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.480
 snake bite but it all depends on 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.309
 situations because your opponent can 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.620
 be in any of the controls 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.989
 if you are lucky enough and you have 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.149
 drove the hunting excitement do not hesitate 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.460
 lust him completely on arcane 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.410
 shot and it is due to this proc from 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.450
 the fact that you will be with the memory of the sorcerer 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.309
 shots and will take shape the main 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.440
 hunter damage many people 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.789
 prefer to use a lion cast as 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.809
 only they run out of time 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.850
 recovery 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.620
 but in my opinion they should be used in 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.199
 those moments when you have no power 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.030
 hunting excitement in this moment you 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.430
 can see i have run out of lessons 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.769
 hunting excitement I use the cast 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.140
 the lion and then again gets 3 pro to 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.210
 the hunting excitement of these prophets i got 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.580
 still at that moment when the glyphs did not inflict 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.350
 damage that is spent 1 charge but how 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.610
 only the glaves have hurt me again 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.650
 got three charges 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.810
 Actually that's why I recommend 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.729
 use throw Gleb exactly in those 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.240
 moments when you are not available quickly 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.240
 chimeras 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.830
 or you do not have proc hunting 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.990
 differences in bursts with and without cools 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.210
 will differ in the availability of ability 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.640
 fast shooting because we are using it 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.979
 We get a bluff quickly concentration under 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.780
 whose action we restore 12 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.780
 concentration units every 3 seconds 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.180
 strong now I want to stop at 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.570
 talent hunting excitement and what he is 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.460
 is good 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.070
 in most cases you should take 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.210
 it is this talent and it is immediately 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.640
 a few reasons 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.649
 hunting excitement is very good for killing 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.869
 shaman totems because we are rude 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.910
 we get free arcane shots 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:11.160
 by which it is much easier to kill 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.260
 totems rather than using autoattacks 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.569
 or using more valuable ability 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.030
 such as a chimera shot 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:20.040
 it is worth saving a chimera shot for more 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.420
 important use rather than 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.400
 to kill mtt 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.319
 a few magicians mr love 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.030
 will help you to extend the totem even 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:28.650
 if the shaman use 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.510
 special character to increase 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.760
 the number of their lives uravleniya more 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.800
 high recovery time i take it 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.510
 only in those cases when I know that to me 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.730
 will have a lot to dispel 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.610
 for example against such setup as LSD 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.530
 or any other setups where will 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:47.330
 attend druid rest situations 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.330
 I use hunting excitement 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.549
 but 

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:59.859
 look at the theory in action in this 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:02.170
 moment the opponent began to play for me i 

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:04.150
 I will explain what I took to survive 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.920
 their burst and that and undertaken to 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.409
 organize your own to put pressure 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.840
 on their team as you see with me 

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:12.879
 not much health left know that 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.010
 soon i will have ace true as well 

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:16.780
 have a catarrh and trap using up 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.670
 Terence understand that now I'm in full 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.560
 safety and my hiller can me 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.810
 raise now i start looking 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.209
 right moment to miss them 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:27.219
 team by the way wyvern bite in this match 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:28.989
 i use only because my 

00:03:27.219 --> 00:03:31.060
 look very risky to rely only 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:33.489
 on the ice trap against teams in 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:35.349
 which there is a shaman and so the shaman is 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:37.209
 in control and we know that he doesn't have 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:39.370
 tremor so this is the perfect moment for 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:41.169
 our team to skip me 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:43.750
 tried the initial shot boosts 

00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:46.150
 chimeras and got proc hunting hunting 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.709
 I saw that in this moment is still worth 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.599
 concentrate on control 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:51.669
 so I decided to wait for the next one 

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:54.159
 chimera shots to get rock again 

00:03:51.669 --> 00:03:56.109
 hunting excitement but here beltran house 

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:58.480
 I still framed me a little 

00:03:56.109 --> 00:04:00.669
 there was enough concentration but when i 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.650
 used exhibitions and measures hunting 

00:04:00.669 --> 00:04:05.079
 excitement is no good for therefore as discussed 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:07.329
 I used to throw a lion earlier 

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:10.109
 from hunting excitement and started with a memory 

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:10.109
 arcane shot
