because I think for those of us who do
struggle<00:01:46.530> a<00:01:46.710> little<00:01:46.829> bit<00:01:46.979> with<00:01:47.220> meditation

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
struggle a little bit with meditation

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.520 
struggle a little bit with meditation
and<00:01:47.820> just<00:01:48.060> getting<00:01:48.299> into<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.600> swing<00:01:48.840> of<00:01:48.960> it<00:01:49.079> it

and just getting into the swing of it it

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.080 
and just getting into the swing of it it
was<00:01:49.649> definitely<00:01:49.829> a<00:01:50.130> refreshing<00:01:50.700> thing<00:01:50.880> to

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
was definitely a refreshing thing to

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.060 
was definitely a refreshing thing to
read<00:01:51.329> to<00:01:51.689> see<00:01:51.899> where<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.439> alternatives<00:01:52.950> are

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
read to see where the alternatives are

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.590
