object in this in a little bit above the
ground<00:00:39.230> kind<00:00:40.230> of<00:00:40.290> strange<00:00:42.320> see<00:00:43.320> if<00:00:43.410> we<00:00:43.530> get<00:00:43.770> a

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
ground kind of strange see if we get a

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.930 
ground kind of strange see if we get a
better<00:00:44.010> view<00:00:44.309> of<00:00:44.489> them<00:00:46.489> okay<00:00:47.489> this<00:00:47.730> is<00:00:47.910> a

statue<00:01:31.829> before

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:35.720 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.190 

okay<00:01:36.720> very<00:01:37.710> much<00:01:38.010> closer<00:01:38.370> now<00:01:38.750> this<00:01:39.750> is<00:01:39.930> about

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
okay very much closer now this is about

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.370 
okay very much closer now this is about
the<00:01:40.410> maximum<00:01:40.800> i<00:01:41.040> could<00:01:41.190> possibly<00:01:41.370> get<00:01:42.380> let's

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
the maximum i could possibly get let's

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:49.220 
the maximum i could possibly get let's
look<00:01:43.740> down<00:01:43.980> at<00:01:44.190> them<00:01:44.340> building<00:01:44.820> too<00:01:45.060> I<00:01:48.230> think

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:49.230 
look down at them building too I think

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:57.270 
look down at them building too I think
there's<00:01:49.470> a<00:01:49.560> structure

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:03.719 

and<00:01:57.610> here's<00:01:58.390> this<00:01:59.070> UFO<00:02:00.150> object<00:02:01.680> as<00:02:02.729> hovering

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:03.729 
and here's this UFO object as hovering

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:07.620 
and here's this UFO object as hovering
above<00:02:04.119> the<00:02:04.299> surface<00:02:06.090> nearby<00:02:07.090> there<00:02:07.330> is<00:02:07.479> also

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
above the surface nearby there is also

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.580 
above the surface nearby there is also
something<00:02:08.170> weak<00:02:08.830> them<00:02:09.069> down<00:02:09.280> a<00:02:09.310> little<00:02:09.520> bit

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
something weak them down a little bit

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:17.309 
something weak them down a little bit
looks<00:02:11.590> like<00:02:11.770> a<00:02:11.800> structure<00:02:12.400> I<00:02:12.430> here<00:02:14.220> as<00:02:16.290> you<00:02:17.290> see

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319 
looks like a structure I here as you see

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:19.820 
looks like a structure I here as you see
from<00:02:17.709> the<00:02:17.920> size<00:02:18.130> of<00:02:18.280> my<00:02:18.400> cursor<00:02:18.850> I<00:02:19.030> have

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
from the size of my cursor I have

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.120 
from the size of my cursor I have
enlarged<00:02:20.830> this<00:02:21.520> baby<00:02:21.850> a<00:02:22.180> lot<00:02:22.560> actually<00:02:23.560> I<00:02:23.920> made
