 let's start now with the 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.550
 skills first we have the 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.110
 passive pyromania that after four 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.110
 releases of the next spell that 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.750
 attack nik stun briefly to the 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.910
 goal we go with the disintegration q 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.250
 an and throws a ball of fire imbued with 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.230
 Mana that damages the target and returns 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.289
 spent sister exists it is destroyed 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.480

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.800
 and launches a fire cone door raft that 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.109
 Damages all enemies that are 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.910
 near the shield area cast 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.769
 increases the strength of the armor of 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.309
 annie hurting the enemies that 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.600
 the attack 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.150
 finally the ultimate 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.590
 boccardi bears any christmas its use ti 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.780
 bears that damages all the units of the 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.790
 zone and you see you can attack and burn the 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.860
 adjacent enemies the order of 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.930
 skills to climb will not be cube 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.240
 double e and as long as we can 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.560
 produce let's see the runes the 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.390
 you have in the description as always 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.119
 the masters also and successes of 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.190
 invoker we have the flash and the ignite 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.310
 let's move on now to the section on 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:33.090
 wild according to my criteria and that's very 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.500
 subjective 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.899
 I always in cleaning for truth of 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.119
 the ages and sorcerer's boots that this 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:42.390
 gives him an extra tank or I continue with the 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.819
 recorder then I do the zones out 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.340
 in law in with empty cane and a 

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:49.920
 guardian angel and of situational items to 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.319
 sometimes I do the pincer the riley the 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.179
 visual center and andrew or veil of the of 

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:57.030
 death that depending on the type of 

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:59.250
 game that is the enemies and how 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.110
 we saw us in particular so 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.509
 good has a very varied build this 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.340
 champion and very versatile according to the enemy 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:08.039
 that we are facing we are going to 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.530
 pass now the counter picks to ni is 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.990
 strong against adif and cali and is weak 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.940
 against brand oriana 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:17.040
 and morgan why that because they are 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.770
 champions who have a lot of rank and how 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:22.410
 Annie has no rank in the skills 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:23.970
 he does not have a bad time online and that 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.920
 it causes him not to be a champion 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.990
 competitive so we do not see it in the lc 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.480
 that etcetera etcetera but for playing 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:32.130
 in only that it is very good and it is still marked 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.860
 sting face is comfortable with your last 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.690
 so if you know how to use this champion 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.430
 you will win many games so 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.560
 I can assure and well I hope that you 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.630
 have liked the video you have here a 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.250
 live game watching me playing ni 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.900
 a little bit with its mechanics and I hope 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.280
 that you liked the video you know 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.280
