00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.680 
horror effect I mean it would be weird
for<00:02:39.190> him<00:02:39.550> to<00:02:39.700> just<00:02:39.940> you<00:02:40.090> know<00:02:40.210> create<00:02:40.480> this

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
for him to just you know create this

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.210

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
character just for that maybe there's a

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.510 
character just for that maybe there's a
way<00:02:42.340> to<00:02:42.400> make<00:02:42.790> them<00:02:43.000> do<00:02:43.540> some<00:02:43.780> action<00:02:44.320> but<00:02:45.130> I

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.520
