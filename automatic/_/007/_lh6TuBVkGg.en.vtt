00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:23.130
 hello how are members of our website 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.760
 or video right now I have my sacred 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.320
 clown 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:30.600
 and if we start this video I wanted to do it 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.880
 a little different is not reviewed either 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:35.250
 portal wanted to do it in gratitude 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.590
 for all your love for all your support for 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.270
 everything everything they have done for me and if 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.460
 to not make the video longer 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.899
 we know 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.899
 son of his mother 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:52.219
 it was the neighbor and this time she took off her head 

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:53.570
 of the window 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:55.579
 I know you have been sending me 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:58.339
 message and everyone like that I want to do it 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:59.809
 October but I do not know how they see I just have 

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:02.659
 There is the problem and I want them 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:05.210
 share what I did or what things 

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:07.070
 continue to unite our community I know 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.439
 I'm not the best person to walk 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.450
 saying this I know that I am not the person 

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:14.810
 more prepared or the one that has more 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:16.939
 experience but I do not know about I feel that 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.679
 I want to share jealousy because really 

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:21.770
 I am infinitely grateful with 

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:25.009
 you and then and let's start I took a 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:28.220
 year in deciding whether to create my channel or not 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:29.720
 because I felt that people were going to say is 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.509
 a girl does not have the sufficient criterion 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.580
 to give an opinion and reconsider and I saw 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:36.860
 that the most important thing is that I was going to 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.600
 share what he loved most that I was going to 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.360
 share my opinion I was going to be 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.679
 sharing that with you and this is 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.509
 what matters most is what most 

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:47.030
 ok I think the part more more 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:49.220
 determining was the round table when 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.200
 people that I really admire with everything 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.170
 my heart 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.450
 they gave me three tips three tips 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.600
 that prompted me to create my channel and 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:00.049
 upload videos 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.640
 Alberto roots Javier I do not have 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:03.229
 words to thank them in addition to 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.570
 meet these incredible people 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:08.600
 they knew people that I admire with all my 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:11.690
 heart other factors that are jerry and 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:13.959
 toni miguel I met them in the same fil and 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.959
 It was 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:18.650
 now let's go to the video point first 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.290
 first of all you have to be determined 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.030
 and committed to doing it you must 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.970
 grab a space of your time and 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:28.100
 dedicate it to your videos to the beavers to 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.900
 answer comments to interact with 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.580
 those people who see you and obviously 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.610
 you have to be very clear that you are 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:37.510
 exposed to criticism and joke 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:40.610
 this is to take those criticisms as 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:43.400
 feedback you can improve such 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:45.320
 thing you can change such thing I mean 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:49.640
 you're not going to change your person 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:51.740
 way of being for those comments 22 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.970
 you do not have to have the best camera 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:55.610
 include I think that's the least 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.230
 that is, as regards the technical, the only 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:59.120
 What can I say is that there is a good 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.310
 lighting and good video audio 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.870
 but that having the best camera 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.370
 buy a professional camera for 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:08.170
 do videos not 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:10.690
 if you have a camera on your cell phone 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:13.120
 the one on your laptop the any camera that 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.920
 the camera does not limit you or be that to that 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.739
 point I want to get in the camera not 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:20.290
 do not limit yourself to making your videos 3 the 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:24.269
 number of books does not matter I think that 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:27.640
 the important thing is that in your reviews of 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:29.049
 clearly your opinion is really a 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.540
 review is not like I have a 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:34.659
 structure or is it really like you 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:37.060
 account is pretty much the story for 

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:38.709
 create interest and for people to want 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.930
 read the book I think the important thing 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:43.150
 of a video is the opinion of the person 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.440
 say because he liked it because he did not like it 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.650
 that is important 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:49.599
 so you give your top because a 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:53.500
 review anyone can give the 

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:54.640
 opinion only you the most important thing is to be you 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.430
 same 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:04:00.310
 always be true to yourself do not change 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:02.980
 your personality to please the 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:05.470
 ávila good people because others do not 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.990
 I think the important thing is that I have 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:11.709
 security that you do not change your personality 

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:14.050
 that you be your simple humble fluid 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:16.720
 with the big heart I hope that some 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:19.150
 or otherwise helped them 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.230
 and if you create your channel, leave it here 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:23.230

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:26.520
