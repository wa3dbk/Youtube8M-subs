00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:21.939 
to make cheese L are chia seeds and
water<00:00:18.769> so<00:00:19.509> really<00:00:20.509> quick<00:00:20.720> on<00:00:20.869> chia<00:00:21.199> seeds<00:00:21.499> they

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:21.949 
water so really quick on chia seeds they

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:24.249 
water so really quick on chia seeds they
are<00:00:22.220> tiny<00:00:22.640> little<00:00:22.909> seeds<00:00:23.269> that<00:00:23.869> are<00:00:23.929> high<00:00:24.230> in

00:00:24.249 --> 00:00:24.259 
are tiny little seeds that are high in

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:28.419 
are tiny little seeds that are high in
omega-3<00:00:25.099> they're<00:00:25.849> smaller<00:00:26.659> than<00:00:27.230> a<00:00:27.649> sesame

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:28.429 
omega-3 they're smaller than a sesame

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:33.069 
omega-3 they're smaller than a sesame
seed<00:00:28.569> but<00:00:29.569> they<00:00:30.380> absorb<00:00:31.130> nine<00:00:31.669> times<00:00:32.300> their

00:00:33.069 --> 00:00:33.079 
seed but they absorb nine times their

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:38.349 
seed but they absorb nine times their
weight<00:00:35.680> when<00:00:36.680> they<00:00:37.070> are<00:00:37.190> exposed<00:00:37.280> to<00:00:38.030> other

00:00:38.349 --> 00:00:38.359 
weight when they are exposed to other

00:00:38.359 --> 00:00:42.160 
weight when they are exposed to other
liquids<00:00:38.929> are<00:00:39.620> two<00:00:39.859> liquids<00:00:40.250> so<00:00:40.960> one<00:00:41.960> of<00:00:41.989> the

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.170 
liquids are two liquids so one of the

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.560 
liquids are two liquids so one of the
reasons<00:00:42.590> why<00:00:43.010> you<00:00:43.070> might<00:00:43.550> want<00:00:43.609> to<00:00:44.149> make<00:00:44.300> chia

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:44.570 
reasons why you might want to make chia

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.810 
reasons why you might want to make chia
gel<00:00:44.870> is<00:00:45.199> if<00:00:45.410> you're<00:00:45.589> making<00:00:45.890> a<00:00:46.010> smoothie<00:00:46.579> and

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:46.820 
gel is if you're making a smoothie and

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.680 
gel is if you're making a smoothie and
you<00:00:47.629> want<00:00:47.870> to<00:00:47.989> make<00:00:48.109> it<00:00:48.320> a<00:00:48.440> little<00:00:48.589> bit<00:00:48.800> thicker

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:49.690 
you want to make it a little bit thicker

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:52.959 
you want to make it a little bit thicker
then<00:00:50.690> the<00:00:51.050> chisel<00:00:51.559> will<00:00:51.800> help<00:00:52.010> make<00:00:52.789> that

00:00:52.959 --> 00:00:52.969 
then the chisel will help make that

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:55.599 
then the chisel will help make that
happen<00:00:53.030> and<00:00:53.660> it's<00:00:54.199> obviously<00:00:54.710> a<00:00:54.800> vegan<00:00:55.309> and<00:00:55.519> a

00:00:55.599 --> 00:00:55.609 
happen and it's obviously a vegan and a

be done with a fork with a whisk but if
you<00:01:49.580> do<00:01:49.760> it<00:01:49.850> with<00:01:50.000> a<00:01:50.030> fork<00:01:50.330> just<00:01:50.450> do<00:01:50.750> a<00:01:50.780> whisking

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
you do it with a fork just do a whisking

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.090 
you do it with a fork just do a whisking
type<00:01:51.620> motion<00:01:51.950> to<00:01:52.960> keep<00:01:53.960> them<00:01:54.200> from<00:01:54.560> sticking

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100

type motion to keep them from sticking
to<00:01:55.520> one<00:01:55.670> another<00:01:55.970> and<00:01:56.270> that<00:01:56.810> will<00:01:57.110> help<00:01:57.230> them

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
to one another and that will help them

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.480 
to one another and that will help them
absorb<00:01:57.910> water<00:01:58.910> more<00:01:59.300> quickly<00:01:59.540> and<00:02:00.220> they<00:02:01.220> need

absorb water more quickly and they need

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:06.670 
absorb water more quickly and they need
about<00:02:01.760> 15<00:02:02.360> to<00:02:02.690> 30<00:02:03.020> minutes<00:02:03.290> to<00:02:05.680> start

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680 
about 15 to 30 minutes to start

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.950 
about 15 to 30 minutes to start
