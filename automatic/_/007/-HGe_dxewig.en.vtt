00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
selection choosing a greenhouse site the

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.770 
selection choosing a greenhouse site the
the<00:00:40.920> location<00:00:41.640> is<00:00:41.910> not<00:00:42.300> critical<00:00:43.020> but<00:00:43.700> we<00:00:44.780> do

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
the location is not critical but we do

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.510 
the location is not critical but we do
have<00:00:45.960> some<00:00:46.170> preferences<00:00:46.680> and<00:00:46.890> that<00:00:47.010> being<00:00:47.250> a

good southerly southerly exposure during
the<00:00:51.600> winter<00:00:51.870> months<00:00:51.900> so<00:00:52.890> let's<00:00:53.280> say<00:00:53.960> October

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
the winter months so let's say October

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.920 
the winter months so let's say October
November<00:00:55.410> December<00:00:55.710> January<00:00:56.250> and<00:00:56.930> into

November December January and into
February<00:00:58.410> if<00:00:58.739> you<00:00:58.920> can<00:00:59.100> get<00:00:59.280> winter<00:00:59.640> sun<00:00:59.970> then

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
February if you can get winter sun then

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.569 
February if you can get winter sun then
that<00:01:00.899> greenhouse<00:01:01.230> is<00:01:01.470> going<00:01:01.649> to<00:01:01.710> heat<00:01:02.070> up<00:01:02.100> and

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
that greenhouse is going to heat up and

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.870 
that greenhouse is going to heat up and
provide<00:01:03.049> probably<00:01:04.049> 70<00:01:04.949> degrees<00:01:05.309> or<00:01:05.489> warmer

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
provide probably 70 degrees or warmer

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.810 
provide probably 70 degrees or warmer
during<00:01:06.510> those<00:01:06.750> months<00:01:07.080> without<00:01:07.820> additional

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
during those months without additional

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.120 
during those months without additional
heat<00:01:09.030> now<00:01:09.840> that's<00:01:10.020> when<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.380> Sun<00:01:10.560> shines

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
heat now that's when the Sun shines

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.280 
heat now that's when the Sun shines
now<00:01:11.640> when<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.120> we<00:01:12.540> get<00:01:12.630> these<00:01:12.810> long<00:01:12.990> cloudy

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
now when the we get these long cloudy

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.340 
now when the we get these long cloudy
days<00:01:13.970> you<00:01:14.970> will<00:01:15.240> have<00:01:15.270> to<00:01:15.600> have<00:01:15.690> supplemental

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
days you will have to have supplemental

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.560 
days you will have to have supplemental
heat<00:01:16.500> but<00:01:17.310> that<00:01:17.520> makes<00:01:17.760> a<00:01:17.909> big<00:01:18.060> difference

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
heat but that makes a big difference

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.380 
heat but that makes a big difference
whether<00:01:18.780> you<00:01:18.960> get<00:01:19.140> that<00:01:19.380> that<00:01:20.190> Southern<00:01:21.060> Sun

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
whether you get that that Southern Sun

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.140 
whether you get that that Southern Sun
and<00:01:21.920> the<00:01:22.920> second<00:01:23.400> preference<00:01:23.670> would<00:01:24.090> be

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
and the second preference would be

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.440 
and the second preference would be
eastern<00:01:25.220> location<00:01:26.220> so<00:01:26.400> if<00:01:26.580> you<00:01:26.700> can<00:01:26.880> catch<00:01:27.120> the

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
eastern location so if you can catch the

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.930 
eastern location so if you can catch the
Sun<00:01:27.720> in<00:01:28.020> your<00:01:28.170> greenhouse<00:01:28.549> when<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.670> sun's

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:29.940 
Sun in your greenhouse when the sun's

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
really appreciate that gets them off to

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
morning Sun you can use artificial light

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.430 
morning Sun you can use artificial light
and<00:01:40.530> we'll<00:01:41.250> talk<00:01:41.430> about<00:01:41.580> that<00:01:41.880> later<00:01:42.440> but

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:43.440

anyway

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.109 
anyway
southern<00:01:44.670> exposure<00:01:44.790> is<00:01:45.240> great<00:01:45.510> in<00:01:46.350> eastern

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:47.119 
southern exposure is great in eastern

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:50.359 
southern exposure is great in eastern
western<00:01:48.119> exposure<00:01:48.540> can<00:01:49.350> be<00:01:49.380> good<00:01:49.710> it<00:01:49.920> can<00:01:50.189> be<00:01:50.340> a

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
western exposure can be good it can be a

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.510 
western exposure can be good it can be a
problem<00:01:50.700> here<00:01:51.540> in<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:51.810> northwest<00:01:52.520> that

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
problem here in the northwest that

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.950 
problem here in the northwest that
Western<00:01:54.060> Sun<00:01:54.390> in<00:01:54.750> August<00:01:56.060> really<00:01:57.060> cooks<00:01:57.420> the

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
Western Sun in August really cooks the

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.210 
Western Sun in August really cooks the
greenhouse<00:01:58.380> so<00:01:59.310> need<00:02:00.240> to<00:02:00.360> deal<00:02:00.509> with<00:02:00.570> that

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:01.220 
greenhouse so need to deal with that

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:04.039 
greenhouse so need to deal with that
using<00:02:02.220> shade<00:02:02.790> fabric<00:02:03.210> on<00:02:03.360> the<00:02:03.450> western<00:02:03.810> wall

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
using shade fabric on the western wall

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.830 
using shade fabric on the western wall
as<00:02:04.320> well<00:02:05.009> as<00:02:05.070> your<00:02:05.369> roof<00:02:05.549> so<00:02:05.790> you<00:02:06.689> have<00:02:06.780> a

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
as well as your roof so you have a

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.889 
as well as your roof so you have a
Western<00:02:07.229> exposure<00:02:07.580> that's<00:02:08.580> okay<00:02:08.970> but<00:02:09.599> just

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
Western exposure that's okay but just

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.440 
Western exposure that's okay but just
realize<00:02:10.709> there's<00:02:11.039> a<00:02:11.099> little<00:02:11.340> extra<00:02:11.669> that<00:02:12.329> you

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
realize there's a little extra that you

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.909 
realize there's a little extra that you
have<00:02:12.569> to<00:02:12.749> do<00:02:12.870> to<00:02:13.019> keep<00:02:13.139> the<00:02:13.319> greenhouse<00:02:13.650> from

00:02:13.909 --> 00:02:13.919 
have to do to keep the greenhouse from

00:02:13.919 --> 00:02:15.320 
have to do to keep the greenhouse from
overheating

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
overheating

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.780 
overheating
Northern<00:02:16.260> Exposure<00:02:16.440> is<00:02:17.100> great<00:02:17.340> if<00:02:17.520> you're<00:02:17.700> an

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
Northern Exposure is great if you're an

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.910 
Northern Exposure is great if you're an
artist<00:02:18.090> and<00:02:18.390> you<00:02:18.900> like<00:02:19.080> to<00:02:19.230> have<00:02:19.380> that

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
artist and you like to have that

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.030 
artist and you like to have that
diffused<00:02:20.580> light<00:02:21.050> but<00:02:22.050> it's<00:02:22.200> not<00:02:22.350> the<00:02:22.500> best<00:02:22.650> for

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
diffused light but it's not the best for

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:33.280 
diffused light but it's not the best for
growing<00:02:24.000> plants
