00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:04.690
 the personal computer is the best 

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:05.950
 console of the world to which you have more 

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:07.750
 exclusive video game with a lot 

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:09.670
 difference to the one that has the controls 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:12.400
 more precise and is the one that performs the most 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:14.679
 graphically that's clear if you have a 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.779
 good machine however it is difficult 

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:18.730
 play level something on the couch at the end of the 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:20.109
 I play many friends and of course 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.720
 played with more people in it 

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:24.699
 computer so they can have the 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.439
 Advantage of the computer and the console 

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:28.660
 together following a few simple steps 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:32.829
 follow lasarte in half a million euros 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:34.510
 let's start we're going to need a 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:38.620
 television or any other type of 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:45.909
 monitor your laptop or tower a vga cable 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:48.190
 and hdmi a usb command for pc in my case 

00:00:45.909 --> 00:00:51.429
 I'm going to use a vga cable since my 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:53.649
 laptop does not understand input hdmi the 

00:00:51.429 --> 00:00:55.449
 hdmi offers more quality and includes the 

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:57.510
 sound but check that your computer 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:59.709
 have the entrance if it is not going to work 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.469
 This cable can be purchased by 

00:00:59.709 --> 00:01:05.740

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:07.030
 vga if you do not have it you can buy it in 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.820
 Any shop 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:12.549
 only or computer the vga cable no 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.380
 usually count more than 31, notice that the 

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:16.740
 sections are equal both with the 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.869
 pinchitos so to speak inside 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:23.530
 connect it to the entrance of your computer 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:28.860
 and then to the television on startup 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:28.860
 look for projectors and click on duplicate 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.950
 turn on the television and look at the 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:37.899

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.470
 that shows the computer will appear in the 

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:46.149
 television normally television is 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.250
 Set up alone and show the best 

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:50.020
 resolution but if the screen is not 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.630
 full or it looks too blurry 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:55.119
 go to the control panel adjust 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.069

 hdmi you have already finished to start 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:29.319
 play if you use vga I recommend you use 

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:31.420
 1 speaker connected to the PC for 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:35.650
