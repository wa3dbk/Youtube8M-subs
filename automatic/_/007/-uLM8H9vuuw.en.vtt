00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:05.279
 for the last eight months samantha 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.950
 mine was losing weight at a rate 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:10.080
 extremely dangerous to eat more than 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:13.260
 three bites caused him to vomit and 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.480
 no doctor could tell him why but 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:17.300
 Now Doctor Siddad Haddad has just 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.669
 discover something during a study 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:22.619
 gastrointestinal in contrast no 

00:00:20.669 --> 00:00:24.050
 passed beyond a third of 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.609
 duodenum 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.679
 the duodenum is the first part of 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.259
 small intestine where the 

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:33.210
 most of the digestion after 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:35.190
 finish the exam and have read your 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.890
 clinical history the diagnosis was 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.090
 pretty clear he was sure that 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.140
 it was the artery syndrome 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.079
 mesenteric superior 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.579
 mesenteric artery syndrome 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:48.379
 superior is a strange condition that 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:51.350
 It involves the digestive system and 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:53.059
 arteries in a healthy individual the duodenum 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.610
 located at the top of the 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:59.290
 Small intestine passes between two branches 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:01.810
 of the superior mesenteric artery or ms 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:03.550
 but in patients like samantha the 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:05.620
 duodenum is crushed between the two 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:08.060
 blood vessels making it 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:10.880
 impossible to digest food 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:13.640
 in a healthy individual as the 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.259
 duodenum goes below the ms the 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.530
 angle widens to allow passage 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:21.799
 of the food so that angle becomes smaller 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:24.080
 begins to compress the duodenum 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:27.710
 they underlie the angle as in a bird 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:29.539
 short inverted and we will win here like this 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:33.350
 as the angle deepens 

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:35.960
 crushes the duodenum more and more could not 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.789
 believe it there was an artery that was 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.259
 crushing my small intestine and not 

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:40.940
 it allowed me to eat 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:43.220
 I wanted to go out the window and scream 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:44.990
 we discover that it happens to me I do not have a 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.689
 food disorder I am not anorexic 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.640
 however the doctor Haddad suspected 

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:51.140
 that the small texture of samantha 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.509
 may have been the beginning of 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.459
 clutter I'm not sure what was the 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:57.530
 critical moment for samantha but have 

00:01:55.459 --> 00:02:00.740
 lowered weight aggravated what was already a 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:02.479
 narrow angle for your ms once you 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.700
 that angle was reduced until determined 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:06.590
 point began the obstruction and it was a 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.479
 Downhill road 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.399
 even the digestive tract is like a 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.799
 pipe system when there is a 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:14.270
 clogging the object recedes 

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:16.190
 Vomiting was a mechanism 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.740
 defense to decompress the structure 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.780
 she vomited and did not receive nutrition 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:22.550
 that I needed for that reason I kept going down 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.590
 weight and samantha would never have been 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.750
 diagnosed I would never have received a 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.650
 treatment and would have continued to lose weight 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.650
 I could have died 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.950
 after having received the diagnosis 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:37.950
 I felt very relieved I was happy and 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:40.080
 my mother also everything fit I wanted 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.940
 know what the treatment should be 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.370
 It consists of a surgical procedure 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.320
 in which basically they are reconfigured 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.880
 the large intestine and the thin one for 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:50.550
 divert the flow around the 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:53.220
 obstruction that way the food does not 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:55.160
 will spend more below the ms but 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:58.010
 around her 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.690
 but the surgery is risky samantha 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.850
 It is so thin that there is a possibility 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:04.310
 that he has a heart failure 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:06.380
 my worst fear when samantha to invent 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.840
 in surgery was the fact that I was 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:13.670
 so thin and that it could be too 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:17.380
 for her that I was afraid that I could 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:17.380
 not survive the operation 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:23.790
 but there are other possible complications 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:25.440
 that Sanya and Samantha must face the 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.790
 surgeon explained to me that there was a 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.400
 possibility that the artery 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:32.250
 superior mesenteric would break and that 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:34.140
 caused hemorrhage then it is 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.780
 of a main artery that comes from 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:39.300
 the aorta direct from the heart and 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:42.180
 hear that if that artery suffered a 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:43.890
 scratch I could bleed to death was 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.410
 scary 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:49.290
 I remember that I cried and said no 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:51.690
 there is another way you can not do anything else 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.520
 besides the surgery the doctor told me 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:56.130
 I 'm sorry but not if you do not submit to 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:58.080
 this surgery will die I decided that to 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:01.790
 despite all the risks involved 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:04.340
 the surgery had to submit to it 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:09.049
 our surgery was scheduled for 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:11.540
 3 30 pm on January 31, 2008 and I 

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:14.239
 I felt I had to do it and I was 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:17.180
 ready to recover my life finally 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:19.789
 samantha take this to the operating room itself 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:23.060
 it was a long wait at last I went through 

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:26.000
 many things in life but that was the 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:30.160
 worst experience I lived 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:32.750
 after eight hours they complete the surgery 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:35.660
 I remember waking up from anesthesia in 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:38.780
 the recovery room and see the 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:41.090
 surgeon who told me everything came out of 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:43.250
 according to plan everything is 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:45.170
 well I was relieved 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:47.360
 they told me I should rest at least 

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:49.970
 one semester and it takes a year 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:52.040
 to recover from the ms syndrome 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:53.630
 they told me to do physiotherapy 

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:56.110
 because he had lost a lot of muscle mass 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:58.940
 in weight loss and malnutrition 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:03.919
 Cecilia had to start with a diet 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:07.430
 liquid and soft and then little by little it 

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:09.890
 began to incorporate the solids on 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:13.370
 how to re-feed a baby as 

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:18.820
 like every day there was an improvement 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:18.820
 samantha guzmÃ¡n and that was exciting 

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:22.460
 I remember standing in front of the 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:24.620
 balance on a date after the 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:27.110
 surgery and having read that weighed 38 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:29.630
 kilograms as it was a beautiful number in 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:31.430
 this moment I was very happy and my 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:33.320
 mother too 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:35.030
 as that blanket starts to 

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:37.610
 recover can not help but wonder 

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:41.120
 why no doctor recognized his 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:43.730
 problem the ms syndrome is a 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:45.590
 strange disease the diagnosis is of 

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:47.390
 difficult clinical deduction because 

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:50.570
 Symptoms are usually associated with other 

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:52.310
 diseases are not specific was 

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:55.160
 very happy to be on the way to a 

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:56.900
 recovery o and samantha feels better 

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:59.680
 he never graduated from college 

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:03.080
 with honors and has a bright future 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:05.240
 asia I feel that I recovered my life and I do 

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:08.360
 all I want to attend events 

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:12.569
 I have more energy, we are lovers 

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:15.559
 I recover 13 kilos since the operation 

00:06:12.569 --> 00:06:16.770
 it's a blessing he 's happy and happy 

00:06:15.559 --> 00:06:19.289
 happiness 

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:21.689
 sometimes I can say that samantha is a 

00:06:19.289 --> 00:06:23.399
 best person was always an excellent 

00:06:21.689 --> 00:06:26.039
 person but I think so much suffering 

00:06:23.399 --> 00:06:27.979
 helped him to realize what is 

00:06:26.039 --> 00:06:30.330
 truly important in life 

00:06:27.979 --> 00:06:32.369
 soon I will start studying in the 

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:34.110
 virginia university of laws 

00:06:32.369 --> 00:06:36.209
 I'm specifically interested in the 

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:37.949
 defense of patients sometimes in the 

00:06:36.209 --> 00:06:39.749
 health system one has to be your 

00:06:37.949 --> 00:06:42.330
 own defender never let anyone 

00:06:39.749 --> 00:06:44.490
 put them aside or tell them not to 

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:46.740
 can help them there is always something that 

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:48.270
 can do I am the living proof of 

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:51.229
 that there are hopes for people who 

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:51.229
 suffers the same as me
