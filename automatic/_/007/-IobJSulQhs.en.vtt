and<00:02:21.360> then<00:02:21.710> using<00:02:22.940> charisma<00:02:23.940> I'm<00:02:24.300> going<00:02:24.810> to<00:02:24.930> put

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
and then using charisma I'm going to put

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.550 
and then using charisma I'm going to put
some<00:02:25.500> of<00:02:25.530> it<00:02:25.800> out<00:02:26.480> so<00:02:27.480> I<00:02:27.510> can<00:02:27.750> use<00:02:27.930> the<00:02:28.260> dotting

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
some of it out so I can use the dotting

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.530 
some of it out so I can use the dotting
tool<00:02:28.740> on<00:02:28.890> it<00:02:29.780> and<00:02:31.310> the<00:02:32.310> design<00:02:32.700> will<00:02:32.850> be<00:02:32.910> random

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
tool on it and the design will be random

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.260 
tool on it and the design will be random
so<00:02:33.780> it's<00:02:33.930> different<00:02:34.200> for<00:02:34.680> each<00:02:34.800> nail

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270
