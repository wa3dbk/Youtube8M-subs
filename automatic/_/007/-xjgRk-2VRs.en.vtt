00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:07.550
 hello together I'll show you who today 

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:10.099
 makes the navi calculator in k4 at bmw z4 

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:11.629
 made from bread or expanded 

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:14.299
 because I have the ex-premier already 

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:15.980
 expanded and that's pretty much 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:18.500
 complicated with this stupid 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.760
 Disguises here and I have mine 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:24.140
 your effort a little less 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:25.970
 holding means what you do 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.210
 because both are completely forward 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.210
 pushed 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:35.030
 sitting so is now very forward 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:39.710
 pushed as you can see in the next one 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:42.680
 The rest kicked the back seat backs 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.030
 and then you have one here as well 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.829
 on the other side one each 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:50.390
 small talks screw you remove 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:52.850
 must and to solve this part here 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.160
 in the next step that is then 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:01:01.880
 Of course, if available 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:03.350
 Take out the wind deflector in this area 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:07.000
 need to raise up here 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:11.270
 and he really breaks the z4 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.380
 you will be with me that is unfortunately 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.540
 very broke down 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:17.180
 that was partly my debt but 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:19.850
 as well as the blame of bmw the 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.619
 have done bad and that is 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:25.729
 rather because of that plastic with me 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:29.150
 more are so so I still have 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:31.640
 the apron from the z4 and accordingly 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:34.700
 here is that you can now from here 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.880
 I hope I can see quite well there it is 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.470
 this wise here in front 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:45.820
 This is a special cord 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:51.200
 I'll call it unlock up here 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:54.380
 and so you have to be careful that the 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:57.020
 that she does not go out and you can 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.259
 not now that last time 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.259
 made 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:10.789
 this bracket so a bit 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:13.250
 bit fricke he put then it works 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:15.980
 Even the rag is not a self-reliant 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.670
 as no buck it also obscures 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.170
 still open 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.670
 So you get a pretty good one here 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:24.349
 gap can see in her 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:37.519
 and accordingly can now from 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:40.489
 my side out the navi we have mine 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:43.610
 navi computer was at the repair is 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:46.180
 now new laser in there and I'm going to 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.180
 Insert now time 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:59.640
 I'm the other side too 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.599
 I think so the roof now 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.349
 open because it is easy to end and 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:16.180
 can see me now 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:18.850
 he is already so ready what is possible 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:21.030
 fast mancity 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.030
 so 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:27.200
 in any case more space at the top 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:28.879
 and we can see now I have now 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.670
 that's just a little bit 

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:33.110
 sandwiched the next thing he did now 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:35.319
 of course you have to make a cable 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:35.319
 to join 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:59.900
 so i do not have a cameraman do you take 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:02.150
 not bad to me 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:05.510
 that's why it's not spartan 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:09.319
 now be in the next step 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:10.880
 take navi calculator say so beautiful 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:11.959
 the heart push in and you can hear that 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:14.780
 sometimes in the box 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:18.470
 that he is really in it then and 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:19.100
 Assembly is still here 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:21.380
 lying around 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:23.210
 ok now the switch has gone 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:25.639
 I now this is the 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:28.150
 switch for this the light in the compartment 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:30.380
 and it's going to be used down here 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.729
 I have to look the same again or 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:33.229
 I have to return to the camera unfortunately 

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:34.330
 do not work on sand otherwise 

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:36.229
 exactly 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.040
 I hope I could someone you one 

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:38.570
 help a little 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.860
 So you do not really have to do everything 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:42.290
 completely disassemble like you 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:46.990
 have seen it go with a bit 

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:46.990
 fresh work on less expensive
