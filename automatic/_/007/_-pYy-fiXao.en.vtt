00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:10.660 
we were able to reconstruct with a high

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:13.260 
we were able to reconstruct with a high
degree<00:00:10.900> of<00:00:11.410> accuracy<00:00:12.010> the<00:00:12.280> appearance<00:00:13.150> of

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:17.320 
archaeological information uncovered by

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.200 
archaeological information uncovered by
the<00:00:17.380> National<00:00:17.830> Park<00:00:18.039> Service<00:00:18.400> so<00:00:18.939> we're<00:00:19.090> able

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:19.210 
the National Park Service so we're able

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:24.080 
the National Park Service so we're able
to<00:00:19.420> duplicate<00:00:19.960> the<00:00:20.470> species<00:00:20.949> of<00:00:22.169> oak<00:00:23.169> the

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
to duplicate the species of oak the

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.700 
to duplicate the species of oak the
arrangement<00:00:25.090> of<00:00:25.270> the<00:00:25.539> stockade<00:00:25.989> posts<00:00:26.560> and

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:26.710 
arrangement of the stockade posts and

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:28.470 
arrangement of the stockade posts and
the<00:00:26.770> fact<00:00:26.980> that<00:00:27.130> they're<00:00:27.340> they're<00:00:27.789> split<00:00:28.180> and

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:28.480 
the fact that they're they're split and

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.870 
the fact that they're they're split and
have<00:00:28.720> flat<00:00:29.020> faces<00:00:29.289> facing<00:00:30.279> out<00:00:30.430> so<00:00:30.460> we<00:00:30.699> feel

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:30.880 
have flat faces facing out so we feel

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.330 
have flat faces facing out so we feel
very<00:00:30.910> confident<00:00:31.540> that<00:00:31.689> this<00:00:31.930> is<00:00:32.110> a<00:00:32.739> very

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:33.340 
very confident that this is a very

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.060 
very confident that this is a very
accurate<00:00:33.790> recreation<00:00:34.450> of<00:00:34.989> the<00:00:35.350> amount<00:00:35.920> of

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:36.070 
accurate recreation of the amount of

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:37.500 
accurate recreation of the amount of
cover<00:00:36.280> that<00:00:36.520> porta<00:00:36.790> necessity<00:00:37.270> would<00:00:37.390> have

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:37.510 
cover that porta necessity would have

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:48.639 
cover that porta necessity would have
provided<00:00:38.050> for<00:00:38.890> the<00:00:39.010> soldiers<00:00:39.399> inside

00:00:48.639 --> 00:00:48.649 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:52.970 

as<00:00:50.960> the<00:00:51.960> weapons<00:00:52.289> are<00:00:52.500> fired

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
as the weapons are fired

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.950 
as the weapons are fired
we<00:00:53.579> recording<00:00:54.739> the<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:56.100> caliber<00:00:56.850> and<00:00:57.269> how

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
we recording the the caliber and how

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.770 
we recording the the caliber and how
many<00:00:58.109> grains<00:00:58.350> of<00:00:58.530> powder<00:00:58.710> or<00:00:58.890> behind<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.370> shot

00:00:59.770 --> 00:00:59.780 
many grains of powder or behind the shot

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.439 
many grains of powder or behind the shot
so<00:01:00.780> kind<00:01:01.379> of<00:01:01.469> see<00:01:01.769> differences<00:01:02.579> in<00:01:02.640> volume<00:01:03.089> to

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
so kind of see differences in volume to

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.930 
so kind of see differences in volume to
the<00:01:03.540> port<00:01:03.809> and<00:01:04.259> maybe<00:01:05.070> penetration<00:01:05.759> to<00:01:05.909> the

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:05.940 
the port and maybe penetration to the

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:19.760 
the port and maybe penetration to the
port<00:01:16.460> you<00:01:17.460> see<00:01:17.670> how<00:01:17.819> how<00:01:18.390> raw<00:01:18.630> that<00:01:18.659> is<00:01:19.080> yeah<00:01:19.500> it

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
port you see how how raw that is yeah it

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.480 
port you see how how raw that is yeah it
came<00:01:20.039> just<00:01:20.280> below<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.179> loop<00:01:21.860> bounced<00:01:22.860> up<00:01:23.009> sent

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
came just below the loop bounced up sent

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.669 
came just below the loop bounced up sent
that<00:01:23.670> splinter<00:01:24.000> into<00:01:24.420> his<00:01:24.810> shoulder<00:01:25.020> here<00:01:25.470> and

00:01:25.669 --> 00:01:25.679 
that splinter into his shoulder here and

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:26.809 
that splinter into his shoulder here and
another<00:01:25.920> one<00:01:26.009> through<00:01:26.310> his<00:01:26.429> heart<00:01:26.700> and

00:01:26.809 --> 00:01:26.819 
another one through his heart and

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:28.399 
another one through his heart and
there's<00:01:26.970> even<00:01:27.240> small<00:01:27.600> splinters<00:01:28.050> if<00:01:28.170> you<00:01:28.259> look

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
there's even small splinters if you look

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.590 
there's even small splinters if you look
real<00:01:28.590> close<00:01:28.800> you<00:01:28.830> know<00:01:29.280> there's<00:01:29.520> a<00:01:29.610> lot<00:01:29.789> here's

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
real close you know there's a lot here's

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.290 
real close you know there's a lot here's
some<00:01:30.750> wood<00:01:30.960> right<00:01:31.140> here<00:01:33.619> it's<00:01:34.619> driven<00:01:34.920> in

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:35.300 
some wood right here it's driven in

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.880 
some wood right here it's driven in
would<00:01:36.300> be<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.569> impact<00:01:36.929> on<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.229> men<00:01:37.409> or<00:01:37.710> mine

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
would be the impact on the men or mine

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.309 
would be the impact on the men or mine
went<00:01:38.159> certainly<00:01:38.909> we've<00:01:39.270> got<00:01:39.450> splinters<00:01:39.810> all

00:01:40.309 --> 00:01:40.319 
went certainly we've got splinters all

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:45.199 
went certainly we've got splinters all
over<00:01:40.590> this<00:01:40.710> guy's<00:01:41.100> head<00:01:43.610> just<00:01:44.610> tearing<00:01:45.030> into

00:01:45.199 --> 00:01:45.209 
over this guy's head just tearing into

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:47.029 
over this guy's head just tearing into
your<00:01:45.450> flesh<00:01:45.750> is<00:01:46.170> certainly<00:01:46.770> going<00:01:46.979> to

00:01:47.029 --> 00:01:47.039 
your flesh is certainly going to

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:49.730 
your flesh is certainly going to
distract<00:01:47.490> them<00:01:47.750> it's<00:01:48.750> really<00:01:48.929> remarkable<00:01:49.319> the

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
distract them it's really remarkable the

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.209 
distract them it's really remarkable the
amount<00:01:49.950> of<00:01:50.039> damage<00:01:50.430> I<00:01:51.950> wouldn't<00:01:52.950> want<00:01:53.070> to<00:01:53.100> be

00:01:53.209 --> 00:01:53.219 
amount of damage I wouldn't want to be

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:54.679 
amount of damage I wouldn't want to be
behind<00:01:53.490> this<00:01:53.700> and<00:01:53.969> it<00:01:54.210> doesn't<00:01:54.539> really

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
behind this and it doesn't really

00:01:54.689 --> 00:02:07.880 
behind this and it doesn't really
provide<00:01:55.020> much<00:01:55.170> cover<00:01:55.649> does<00:01:55.890> it

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.170 

well<00:02:08.890> this<00:02:09.009> is<00:02:09.190> one<00:02:09.580> of<00:02:09.610> the<00:02:09.759> records<00:02:10.119> of

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:10.180 
well this is one of the records of

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:13.620 
well this is one of the records of
ricochet<00:02:10.570> rounds<00:02:10.960> we<00:02:11.080> saw<00:02:11.290> actually<00:02:12.390> we<00:02:13.390> saw

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
ricochet rounds we saw actually we saw

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.070 
ricochet rounds we saw actually we saw
it<00:02:13.750> at<00:02:13.930> the<00:02:15.090> stockade<00:02:16.090> and<00:02:16.120> then<00:02:16.420> bouncing<00:02:16.960> the

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
it at the stockade and then bouncing the

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:22.020 
it at the stockade and then bouncing the
ground<00:02:17.290> in<00:02:17.530> front<00:02:17.650> of<00:02:17.770> the<00:02:17.860> stockade<00:02:18.280> and<00:02:21.030> you

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
ground in front of the stockade and you

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.360 
ground in front of the stockade and you
can<00:02:22.180> see<00:02:23.190> yeah

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
can see yeah

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.570 
can see yeah
fragments<00:02:24.880> of<00:02:24.940> wood<00:02:25.120> so<00:02:25.840> the<00:02:25.960> impact<00:02:26.490> you<00:02:27.490> know

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
fragments of wood so the impact you know

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.660 
fragments of wood so the impact you know
flattened<00:02:28.000> up<00:02:28.090> against<00:02:28.420> the<00:02:28.510> wood<00:02:28.660> and<00:02:28.900> then

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
flattened up against the wood and then

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.710 
flattened up against the wood and then
actually<00:02:30.670> you<00:02:30.730> can<00:02:30.850> imagine<00:02:31.060> the<00:02:31.360> damage<00:02:31.690> that

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
actually you can imagine the damage that

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.300 
actually you can imagine the damage that
this<00:02:31.990> would<00:02:32.140> do<00:02:32.290> you<00:02:32.620> know<00:02:32.709> if<00:02:32.770> it<00:02:32.860> hit<00:02:32.980> flesh

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
this would do you know if it hit flesh

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:40.460 
this would do you know if it hit flesh
flesh<00:02:34.300> and<00:02:34.540> bone

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.790 

maybe<00:02:41.470> Washington<00:02:42.130> who<00:02:42.280> commented<00:02:42.820> that<00:02:43.800> the

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
maybe Washington who commented that the

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.440 
maybe Washington who commented that the
French<00:02:45.220> because<00:02:45.610> they<00:02:45.760> were<00:02:45.820> under<00:02:46.030> the<00:02:46.240> cover

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
French because they were under the cover

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.750 
French because they were under the cover
of<00:02:46.600> the<00:02:46.690> forest<00:02:46.840> were<00:02:47.140> having<00:02:47.470> a<00:02:48.040> lot<00:02:48.550> better

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
of the forest were having a lot better

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.380 
of the forest were having a lot better
luck<00:02:50.340> keeping<00:02:51.340> their<00:02:51.459> weapons<00:02:51.820> in<00:02:51.970> order<00:02:52.120> and

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
luck keeping their weapons in order and

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.840 
luck keeping their weapons in order and
firing<00:02:52.870> whereas<00:02:53.350> the<00:02:53.950> Virginians<00:02:54.430> are<00:02:54.550> out<00:02:54.670> in
