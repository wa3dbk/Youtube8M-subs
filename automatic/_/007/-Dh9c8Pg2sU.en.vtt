00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.410
 man to watch video 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:21.260
 a little jack sparrow and you are 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.640
 although I am told 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.940
 around here the pirates the creation 

00:00:41.339 --> 00:00:47.290
 let's start 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:49.839
 I am going to build today scale more 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:52.710
 for more in your base I do not know I do not know who 

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:52.710
 I want something something 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:01:02.380
 it is not a bad idea up 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:15.070
 and I see it 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.299
 we have to put a plan of 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.509
 style restrictions can only be 

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:24.899
 use things made of wood or metal 

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:28.020
 because if he did not finish taking the metal 

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:28.020
 but yes 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:49.880
 16 closed for I do not know why sack 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:51.050
 and he does not know anything perfect to do 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.630
 really in the time that they put us in 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:56.430
 plan being seconds is impossible not to 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:59.590
 it can be wrong 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:02.740
 is that I would leave it 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:05.320
 this look to make a buttons the 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:08.590
 death to good I see it as such an error 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:10.900
 it is so well in yielded if this is 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.310
 my mother, you, you, this seems to them 

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:14.470
 lose star awards if you notice a 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:17.440
 little bit that looks like the star parade 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.210
 wars if of the first movie of some 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.710
 new hope in which they go mark fish 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:22.710
 that we were stinging of these houses 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:37.140
 yeah well I think that say nothing but what 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.140
 mine to feet in dusty 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.959
 think of dusty 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.970
 that is to put feet in dusty in plan 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:49.480
 you mean to know 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:51.960
 I'm going to put an eye on that this is going 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.960
 evolving 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:03:00.140
 we put ourselves here to this they are afraid 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:05.170
 not the truth is that it is not right 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:05.170
 built here that he accepted 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.390
 or not 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:19.030
 Then you left me a little 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:19.030
 has completed 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.060
 one 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:44.330
 and I have a very organic seat with 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:47.160
 a lamp so you can light tea 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:50.390
 and read while doing that race 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:54.690
 It is read that gave half of a race 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:55.860
 I'm good that you're ready already 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:58.470
 I'm going to check that there's no 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:03.250
 unexpected solutions 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:07.050
 age is the first the first video 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:07.050
 take it easy 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:13.659
 I am I am more touched because 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.609
 because you have approached for sure that a 

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:17.560
 bit 

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:20.889
 yes sure yes although it is personal and 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:23.489
 that is very badly done uncle since it is very 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:23.489
 low 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.280
 nothing 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:34.520
 good 14 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:37.479
 I think you're leaving because you've put 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.479
 as heavier 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:56.720
 this game is said 

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:56.720
 and he has counted here and is very attentive 

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:10.620
 20 meters plus 18 plus your uncle to the video 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:13.080
 no but it's coming back a little bit 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:15.000
 Mena man who has not caught you much 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:24.030
 race at the beginning but why but 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:27.690
 is that trap sure uncle no more and it 's 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:31.560
 having my family here because I'm 

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:33.590
 lost the video that I have stopped 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:36.400
 here 

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:39.360
 but how do I go home 

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:42.860
 do not destroy you have soul people have 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:45.880
 where was the study secret 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:50.760
 let me let me 

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:50.760
 but it attracted 

00:05:56.349 --> 00:06:00.940
 the study 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:10.069
 there's something here that goes off shot uncle is 

00:06:07.759 --> 00:06:17.919
 the ball is safe and you can see your 

00:06:10.069 --> 00:06:17.919
 family you have that they are also super the 

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:23.680
 Most of the time here 

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:29.720
 you liked it then I'll sell it to you tremendous 

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:32.630
 for a cheap price for how much 

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:35.990
 how much would you be willing so much 

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:38.470
 a lot because then working for a 

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:38.470
 little bit more
