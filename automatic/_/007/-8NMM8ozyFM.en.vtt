the<00:00:02.310> next<00:00:02.520> step<00:00:02.670> to<00:00:02.820> learning<00:00:02.969> how<00:00:03.090> to<00:00:03.150> juggle

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:03.360 
the next step to learning how to juggle

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.259 
the next step to learning how to juggle
three<00:00:03.509> bottles<00:00:03.929> looks<00:00:04.170> just<00:00:04.380> like<00:00:04.529> this<00:00:05.269> let's

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:06.269 
three bottles looks just like this let's

00:00:06.269 --> 00:00:11.680 
three bottles looks just like this let's
do<00:00:06.389> it<00:00:06.450> one<00:00:06.540> more<00:00:06.569> time<00:00:06.779> in<00:00:06.990> slow<00:00:07.080> motion

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:11.690 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:13.900 

all<00:00:12.679> right<00:00:13.099> so<00:00:13.370> that's<00:00:13.549> what<00:00:13.669> we're<00:00:13.759> going<00:00:13.879> to

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:13.910 
all right so that's what we're going to

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:16.179 
all right so that's what we're going to
be<00:00:14.000> working<00:00:14.150> up<00:00:14.389> to<00:00:14.570> we<00:00:15.080> shouldn't<00:00:15.469> by<00:00:15.709> now<00:00:15.920> be

00:00:16.179 --> 00:00:16.189 
be working up to we shouldn't by now be

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:18.279 
be working up to we shouldn't by now be
definitely<00:00:16.759> comfortable<00:00:17.240> with<00:00:17.720> the<00:00:17.869> single

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:18.289 
definitely comfortable with the single

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:19.810 
definitely comfortable with the single
excuse<00:00:18.830> me<00:00:18.949> the<00:00:19.039> one<00:00:19.189> bottle<00:00:19.490> but<00:00:19.640> we're<00:00:19.759> doing

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:19.820 
excuse me the one bottle but we're doing

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:21.850 
excuse me the one bottle but we're doing
a<00:00:19.970> double<00:00:20.300> of<00:00:20.419> course<00:00:20.630> throw<00:00:21.200> across<00:00:21.500> the<00:00:21.650> body

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:21.860 
a double of course throw across the body

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:23.769 
a double of course throw across the body
we're<00:00:22.669> going<00:00:22.759> to<00:00:22.849> pick<00:00:23.000> up<00:00:23.090> that<00:00:23.419> second

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:23.779 
we're going to pick up that second

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:26.260 
we're going to pick up that second
bottle<00:00:24.020> same<00:00:24.380> grip<00:00:24.650> same<00:00:25.160> throw<00:00:25.520> we<00:00:25.970> just<00:00:26.150> have

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:26.270 
bottle same grip same throw we just have

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:27.970 
bottle same grip same throw we just have
to<00:00:26.390> now<00:00:26.509> work<00:00:26.689> on<00:00:26.810> our<00:00:26.960> timing<00:00:27.199> so<00:00:27.739> I'm<00:00:27.829> going

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:27.980 
to now work on our timing so I'm going

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:29.319 
to now work on our timing so I'm going
to<00:00:28.040> hopefully<00:00:28.219> do<00:00:28.460> this<00:00:28.610> in<00:00:28.759> slow<00:00:28.939> motion<00:00:29.119> you

00:00:29.319 --> 00:00:29.329 
to hopefully do this in slow motion you

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:34.569 
to hopefully do this in slow motion you
can<00:00:29.419> see<00:00:29.450> the<00:00:29.630> timing<00:00:30.050> of<00:00:30.140> it

00:00:34.569 --> 00:00:34.579 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:36.069 

all<00:00:34.999> right<00:00:35.269> so<00:00:35.510> it's<00:00:35.629> going<00:00:35.749> to<00:00:35.809> be<00:00:35.899> a<00:00:35.929> matter

00:00:36.069 --> 00:00:36.079 
all right so it's going to be a matter

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:38.829 
all right so it's going to be a matter
of<00:00:36.199> as<00:00:36.379> this<00:00:36.559> one<00:00:36.769> comes<00:00:37.100> up<00:00:37.309> just<00:00:37.539> as<00:00:38.539> it<00:00:38.659> hits

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:38.839 
of as this one comes up just as it hits

00:00:38.839 --> 00:00:40.840 
of as this one comes up just as it hits
its<00:00:39.050> apex<00:00:39.199> or<00:00:39.679> the<00:00:39.769> top<00:00:40.010> of<00:00:40.219> its<00:00:40.339> pattern<00:00:40.730> this

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:40.850 
its apex or the top of its pattern this

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:42.520 
its apex or the top of its pattern this
comes<00:00:41.120> up<00:00:41.300> here<00:00:41.629> and<00:00:41.750> just<00:00:41.929> as<00:00:42.109> it<00:00:42.199> starts<00:00:42.440> to

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:42.530 
comes up here and just as it starts to

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.289 
comes up here and just as it starts to
come<00:00:42.620> down<00:00:42.679> that's<00:00:43.489> when<00:00:43.820> you<00:00:43.879> want<00:00:44.059> to<00:00:44.089> focus

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:44.299 
come down that's when you want to focus

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:46.270 
come down that's when you want to focus
on<00:00:44.629> this<00:00:44.899> throw<00:00:45.170> so<00:00:45.649> as<00:00:45.769> it's<00:00:45.949> starting<00:00:46.070> to

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:46.280 
on this throw so as it's starting to

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.560 
on this throw so as it's starting to
come<00:00:46.370> down<00:00:46.549> this<00:00:46.699> one<00:00:46.879> kind<00:00:47.089> of<00:00:47.120> comes<00:00:47.359> in

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:47.570 
come down this one kind of comes in

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.500 
come down this one kind of comes in
underneath<00:00:48.140> it<00:00:48.440> release<00:00:49.100> that<00:00:49.370> one<00:00:49.640> to<00:00:50.359> then

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
underneath it release that one to then

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.060 
underneath it release that one to then
catch<00:00:50.839> this<00:00:51.079> one<00:00:51.289> and<00:00:51.530> then<00:00:51.619> this<00:00:51.769> one<00:00:51.829> will

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:52.070 
catch this one and then this one will

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:52.990 
catch this one and then this one will
come<00:00:52.219> back<00:00:52.309> down<00:00:52.369> and<00:00:52.640> we're<00:00:52.729> just<00:00:52.850> going<00:00:52.969> to

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.000 
come back down and we're just going to

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.729 
come back down and we're just going to
work<00:00:53.180> on<00:00:53.359> that<00:00:53.479> catch<00:00:53.750> alright<00:00:54.500> so<00:00:54.649> we're

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:54.739 
work on that catch alright so we're

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:57.189 
work on that catch alright so we're
going<00:00:54.829> to<00:00:54.890> do<00:00:55.129> this<00:00:55.820> pointers<00:00:56.600> that<00:00:56.629> I<00:00:56.780> have<00:00:57.019> to

00:00:57.189 --> 00:00:57.199 
going to do this pointers that I have to

00:00:57.199 --> 00:00:59.200 
going to do this pointers that I have to
this<00:00:57.320> are<00:00:57.530> the<00:00:57.640> timing<00:00:58.640> it's<00:00:58.760> a<00:00:58.820> little<00:00:59.089> bit

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 
this are the timing it's a little bit

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.929 
this are the timing it's a little bit
gentler<00:01:00.019> a<00:01:00.049> little<00:01:00.350> slightly<00:01:01.339> slower<00:01:01.699> than<00:01:01.789> a

00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:01.939 
gentler a little slightly slower than a

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:02.919 
gentler a little slightly slower than a
lot<00:01:02.030> of<00:01:02.059> people<00:01:02.269> think<00:01:02.449> a<00:01:02.539> lot<00:01:02.600> of<00:01:02.750> people

00:01:02.919 --> 00:01:02.929 
lot of people think a lot of people

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:04.359 
lot of people think a lot of people
think<00:01:03.140> juggling<00:01:03.500> is<00:01:03.619> really<00:01:03.890> fast<00:01:04.129> and

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:04.369 
think juggling is really fast and

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:06.520 
think juggling is really fast and
throwing<00:01:04.699> them<00:01:04.820> up<00:01:04.970> it's<00:01:05.420> really<00:01:05.600> not<00:01:05.899> kind<00:01:06.470> of

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
throwing them up it's really not kind of

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:08.559 
throwing them up it's really not kind of

though<00:01:16.009> you're<00:01:16.310> going<00:01:16.429> to<00:01:16.520> naturally<00:01:17.209> start

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:17.259 
though you're going to naturally start

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:19.960 
though you're going to naturally start
favoring<00:01:18.259> your<00:01:18.350> right<00:01:18.530> hand<00:01:18.799> don't<00:01:19.039> forget<00:01:19.429> to

favoring your right hand don't forget to

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:21.899 
favoring your right hand don't forget to
put<00:01:20.270> a<00:01:20.299> hat<00:01:20.569> don't<00:01:20.869> forget<00:01:21.140> to<00:01:21.259> practice

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:24.510 
put a hat don't forget to practice
left-handed<00:01:22.909> so<00:01:23.270> start<00:01:23.690> with<00:01:23.810> your<00:01:23.869> right<00:01:24.170> and

left-handed so start with your right and

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.490 
left-handed so start with your right and
then<00:01:25.520> start<00:01:25.850> with<00:01:25.940> your<00:01:26.000> left<00:01:26.299> these<00:01:27.080> leave

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
then start with your left these leave

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.609 
then start with your left these leave
itself<00:01:28.009> and<00:01:28.280> kind<00:01:28.429> of<00:01:28.549> a<00:01:28.670> nice<00:01:29.049> drill<00:01:30.049> to<00:01:30.530> go

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 
itself and kind of a nice drill to go

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:32.529 
itself and kind of a nice drill to go
back<00:01:30.860> and<00:01:31.039> forth<00:01:31.340> that's<00:01:32.149> what<00:01:32.330> we're<00:01:32.420> going

00:01:32.529 --> 00:01:32.539 
back and forth that's what we're going

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:34.179 
back and forth that's what we're going
to<00:01:32.569> ultimately<00:01:32.899> work<00:01:33.110> up<00:01:33.319> towards<00:01:33.500> the<00:01:34.009> other

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:34.189 
to ultimately work up towards the other

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:35.620 
to ultimately work up towards the other
couple<00:01:34.490> common<00:01:34.789> mistakes<00:01:35.090> that<00:01:35.179> people<00:01:35.299> have

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
couple common mistakes that people have

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.580 
couple common mistakes that people have
is<00:01:35.899> is<00:01:36.080> going<00:01:36.799> too<00:01:36.890> fast<00:01:37.899> it's<00:01:38.899> as<00:01:39.200> you<00:01:39.349> throw

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
is is going too fast it's as you throw

that<00:03:07.460> when<00:03:07.730> I<00:03:07.960> catch<00:03:08.960> catch<00:03:09.770> we're<00:03:10.100> going<00:03:10.220> to

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
that when I catch catch we're going to

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.040 
that when I catch catch we're going to
go<00:03:10.340> right<00:03:10.520> left<00:03:10.550> left<00:03:11.030> right<00:03:11.180> we<00:03:11.690> want<00:03:11.870> to<00:03:11.930> kind

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:12.050 
go right left left right we want to kind

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:13.630 
go right left left right we want to kind
of<00:03:12.140> now<00:03:12.260> speed<00:03:12.710> into<00:03:13.040> each<00:03:13.160> other<00:03:13.370> so<00:03:13.550> they

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 
of now speed into each other so they

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.370 
of now speed into each other so they
actually<00:03:13.790> get<00:03:14.030> the<00:03:14.180> real<00:03:14.390> timing<00:03:14.930> of<00:03:15.110> three

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
actually get the real timing of three

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.560 
actually get the real timing of three
bottles<00:03:15.710> going<00:03:15.920> which<00:03:16.550> is<00:03:16.580> going<00:03:16.850> to<00:03:16.940> be<00:03:17.120> my

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.570 
bottles going which is going to be my

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:20.350 
bottles going which is going to be my
hand<00:03:17.810> gives<00:03:18.020> a<00:03:18.170> little<00:03:18.760> so<00:03:19.760> if<00:03:19.820> I<00:03:19.910> can<00:03:20.060> do<00:03:20.180> this

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:20.360 
hand gives a little so if I can do this

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.380 
hand gives a little so if I can do this
I<00:03:20.510> want<00:03:20.660> to<00:03:20.690> start<00:03:20.900> speeding<00:03:21.230> it<00:03:21.470> up<00:03:22.390> speeding

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.390 
I want to start speeding it up speeding

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:25.270 
I want to start speeding it up speeding
it<00:03:23.510> up<00:03:23.660> but<00:03:24.110> when<00:03:24.200> I<00:03:24.230> talked<00:03:24.530> about<00:03:24.740> speeding

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
it up but when I talked about speeding

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.130 
it up but when I talked about speeding
them<00:03:25.460> up<00:03:25.490> so<00:03:26.180> that<00:03:26.210> they<00:03:26.420> chase<00:03:26.690> after<00:03:26.930> each

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.140 
them up so that they chase after each

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:28.210 
them up so that they chase after each
other<00:03:27.290> I'm<00:03:27.470> not<00:03:27.530> actually<00:03:27.890> talking<00:03:28.040> about

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
other I'm not actually talking about

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.010 
other I'm not actually talking about
speeding<00:03:28.850> up<00:03:28.940> the<00:03:29.090> throws<00:03:29.300> faster<00:03:29.750> I'm<00:03:29.840> just

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:30.020 
speeding up the throws faster I'm just

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:32.530 
speeding up the throws faster I'm just
talking<00:03:30.380> about<00:03:30.620> not<00:03:31.190> stopping<00:03:32.000> and<00:03:32.150> pausing

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
talking about not stopping and pausing

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.140 
talking about not stopping and pausing
here<00:03:33.170> but<00:03:33.650> instead<00:03:33.950> as<00:03:34.160> soon<00:03:34.370> as<00:03:34.520> you<00:03:34.670> catch<00:03:34.910> it

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
here but instead as soon as you catch it

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.120 
here but instead as soon as you catch it
then<00:03:35.510> throwing<00:03:35.870> it<00:03:36.110> we<00:03:36.560> want<00:03:36.740> to<00:03:36.770> work<00:03:36.950> up<00:03:37.100> to

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.130 
then throwing it we want to work up to

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:38.380 
then throwing it we want to work up to
that<00:03:37.370> so<00:03:37.520> what's<00:03:37.700> called<00:03:37.970> they<00:03:38.090> chase<00:03:38.360> each

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:38.390 
that so what's called they chase each

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:40.240 
that so what's called they chase each
other<00:03:38.750> so<00:03:39.260> that<00:03:39.290> we<00:03:39.380> can<00:03:39.560> then<00:03:39.680> put<00:03:39.740> that<00:03:40.040> third

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
other so that we can then put that third

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.640 
other so that we can then put that third
bottle<00:03:40.670> in<00:03:40.790> there<00:03:40.970> so<00:03:41.630> if<00:03:41.810> I<00:03:41.930> can<00:03:42.080> get<00:03:42.290> to<00:03:42.500> this

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
bottle in there so if I can get to this

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:45.730 
bottle in there so if I can get to this
point<00:03:43.010> with<00:03:43.790> a<00:03:43.820> couple<00:03:44.180> weeks<00:03:44.330> practice<00:03:44.840> or<00:03:45.620> at

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:45.740 
point with a couple weeks practice or at

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:47.860 
point with a couple weeks practice or at
least<00:03:45.890> a<00:03:45.980> lot<00:03:46.160> of<00:03:46.280> hours<00:03:46.610> of<00:03:46.790> practice<00:03:47.270> you'll

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870 
least a lot of hours of practice you'll

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:51.850 
least a lot of hours of practice you'll
see<00:03:48.080> that<00:03:48.260> third<00:03:48.560> bottle<00:03:49.420> goes<00:03:50.420> right<00:03:50.860> there

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:51.860 
see that third bottle goes right there

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:53.170 
see that third bottle goes right there
all<00:03:52.700> right

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.180 
all right

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:55.960 
all right
practice<00:03:53.840> those<00:03:54.020> two<00:03:54.290> bottles<00:03:54.470> a<00:03:54.830> lot<00:03:55.400> and<00:03:55.730> get

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:55.970 
practice those two bottles a lot and get

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:57.280 
practice those two bottles a lot and get
ready<00:03:56.150> for<00:03:56.300> the<00:03:56.420> next<00:03:56.510> lesson<00:03:56.780> which<00:03:57.110> will<00:03:57.230> be

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
ready for the next lesson which will be

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:00.790 
ready for the next lesson which will be
juggling<00:03:57.500> three<00:03:58.460> bottles
