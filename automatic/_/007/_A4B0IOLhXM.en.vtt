I<00:00:23.279> guess<00:00:24.180> this<00:00:24.330> knife<00:00:24.539> has<00:00:24.750> been<00:00:24.900> around<00:00:25.080> since

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
I guess this knife has been around since

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.759

about<00:00:25.680> the<00:00:25.740> 60s<00:00:26.480> but<00:00:27.480> this<00:00:27.660> is<00:00:27.840> a<00:00:27.869> new<00:00:28.140> redesign

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
that just happened in the past year or

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.620 
that just happened in the past year or

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:08.520 
like I said this is just kind of a neat

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:10.939

little knife with all kinds of little
things<00:07:11.039> and<00:07:11.400> men<00:07:11.729> I'm<00:07:11.970> telling<00:07:12.270> you<00:07:12.330> one<00:07:12.599> thing

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:12.780 
things and men I'm telling you one thing

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:15.379 
things and men I'm telling you one thing
I'm<00:07:12.930> really<00:07:12.960> digging<00:07:13.800> about<00:07:14.010> this<00:07:14.220> is<00:07:14.400> that

00:07:15.379 --> 00:07:15.389 
I'm really digging about this is that

00:07:15.389 --> 00:07:21.620 
I'm really digging about this is that
left-handed<00:07:17.389> liner<00:07:18.389> lock<00:07:19.370> that<00:07:20.370> is<00:07:20.630> so

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:21.630 
left-handed liner lock that is so

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:23.899 
left-handed liner lock that is so
unusual<00:07:22.229> for<00:07:22.260> a<00:07:22.500> knife<00:07:22.680> I<00:07:22.949> think<00:07:23.729> that's

00:07:23.899 --> 00:07:23.909 
unusual for a knife I think that's

00:07:23.909 --> 00:07:26.060 
unusual for a knife I think that's
really<00:07:24.120> neat<00:07:24.479> really<00:07:24.810> enjoying<00:07:25.680> this<00:07:25.889> thing

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:26.070 
really neat really enjoying this thing

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:27.770 
really neat really enjoying this thing
so<00:07:26.250> far<00:07:26.460> and<00:07:27.000> one<00:07:27.120> of<00:07:27.270> the<00:07:27.330> put<00:07:27.479> out<00:07:27.630> there

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:27.780 
so far and one of the put out there

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:29.950 
so far and one of the put out there
because<00:07:27.840> like<00:07:27.960> I<00:07:28.169> said<00:07:28.229> this<00:07:28.470> isn't<00:07:28.830> my<00:07:28.919> normal

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:29.960 
because like I said this isn't my normal

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:32.300 
because like I said this isn't my normal
knife<00:07:30.960> purchase<00:07:31.470> this<00:07:31.590> isn't<00:07:31.919> something<00:07:32.130> I

00:07:34.939 --> 00:07:34.949 
would normally purchase it's kind of

00:07:34.949 --> 00:07:36.980 
would normally purchase it's kind of
unusual<00:07:35.099> for<00:07:35.460> me<00:07:35.760> cuz<00:07:35.970> I<00:07:36.000> do<00:07:36.060> tend<00:07:36.449> to<00:07:36.510> go<00:07:36.690> with

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:36.990 
unusual for me cuz I do tend to go with
