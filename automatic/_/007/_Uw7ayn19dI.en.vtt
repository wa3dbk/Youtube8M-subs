00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.210 
straight piece and while the super glue
dries<00:02:26.420> put<00:02:27.080> something<00:02:27.380> heavy<00:02:27.530> on<00:02:27.680> it<00:02:27.950> like<00:02:28.190> a

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
dries put something heavy on it like a

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.380 
dries put something heavy on it like a
weight<00:02:29.440> okay<00:02:30.440> once<00:02:30.680> that's<00:02:30.830> done<00:02:31.040> drying<00:02:31.400> take

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
weight okay once that's done drying take

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.630 
weight okay once that's done drying take
it<00:02:32.570> and<00:02:32.720> put<00:02:32.840> some<00:02:32.870> more<00:02:33.020> superglue<00:02:33.739> in<00:02:34.010> the

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
it and put some more superglue in the

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.500 
it and put some more superglue in the
seams<00:02:36.130> it'll<00:02:37.130> just<00:02:37.340> wick<00:02:37.610> up<00:02:37.820> in<00:02:38.030> there<00:02:38.239> and

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
seams it'll just wick up in there and

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.390 
seams it'll just wick up in there and
I'll<00:02:38.630> just<00:02:38.870> make<00:02:39.050> sure<00:02:39.530> that<00:02:39.800> it's<00:02:39.950> gonna<00:02:40.160> be

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
I'll just make sure that it's gonna be

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.800 
I'll just make sure that it's gonna be
really<00:02:40.430> strong<00:02:40.970> and<00:02:41.180> it's<00:02:41.330> not<00:02:41.480> going<00:02:41.630> to<00:02:41.690> go

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
really strong and it's not going to go

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:47.920 
really strong and it's not going to go
anywhere

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.429 

and<00:02:48.799> now<00:02:49.010> you've<00:02:49.159> got<00:02:49.310> a<00:02:49.370> nice<00:02:49.610> little<00:02:50.030> hinge

00:02:50.429 --> 00:02:50.439 
and now you've got a nice little hinge

00:02:50.439 --> 00:02:53.830 
and now you've got a nice little hinge
but<00:02:51.439> what<00:02:52.069> I<00:02:52.099> like<00:02:52.400> to<00:02:52.549> do<00:02:52.700> is<00:02:52.909> I<00:02:53.000> like<00:02:53.180> to<00:02:53.239> sand

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
but what I like to do is I like to sand

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.000 
but what I like to do is I like to sand
it<00:02:53.959> a<00:02:54.079> little<00:02:54.260> bit<00:02:54.409> and<00:02:54.560> make<00:02:54.680> it<00:02:54.709> a<00:02:54.860> little

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
it a little bit and make it a little

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.670 
it a little bit and make it a little
more<00:02:55.510> aerodynamic<00:02:56.510> because<00:02:57.470> you<00:02:57.560> know

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
more aerodynamic because you know

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.289 
more aerodynamic because you know
aerodynamics<00:02:58.340> are<00:02:58.459> really<00:02:58.670> important<00:02:59.120> in

00:02:59.289 --> 00:02:59.299 
aerodynamics are really important in

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:01.149 
aerodynamics are really important in
cardboard<00:02:59.629> airplanes<00:03:00.140> so<00:03:00.739> now<00:03:00.860> you've<00:03:01.010> got<00:03:01.129> a

00:03:01.149 --> 00:03:01.159 
cardboard airplanes so now you've got a

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:02.619 
cardboard airplanes so now you've got a
good<00:03:01.340> hand<00:03:01.579> but<00:03:01.849> if<00:03:02.000> you<00:03:02.090> want<00:03:02.269> to<00:03:02.360> make<00:03:02.480> it

00:03:02.619 --> 00:03:02.629 
good hand but if you want to make it

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:04.660 
good hand but if you want to make it
into<00:03:02.810> a<00:03:02.840> control<00:03:03.349> horn<00:03:03.650> you<00:03:04.189> take<00:03:04.400> another

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
into a control horn you take another

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:07.809 
into a control horn you take another
popsicle<00:03:05.329> stick<00:03:05.569> cut<00:03:06.049> off<00:03:06.200> about<00:03:06.500> a<00:03:06.790> 3/4<00:03:07.790> inch

00:03:07.809 --> 00:03:07.819 
popsicle stick cut off about a 3/4 inch

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:11.349 
popsicle stick cut off about a 3/4 inch
section<00:03:08.480> drill<00:03:09.140> a<00:03:09.170> hole<00:03:09.470> in<00:03:09.709> it<00:03:09.829> and<00:03:09.980> then<00:03:10.760> sand

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:11.359 
section drill a hole in it and then sand

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:16.000 
section drill a hole in it and then sand
it<00:03:11.480> down<00:03:11.750> to<00:03:12.140> a<00:03:12.470> 45-degree<00:03:13.459> angle<00:03:14.890> then<00:03:15.890> you

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
it down to a 45-degree angle then you

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.280 
it down to a 45-degree angle then you
take<00:03:16.189> your<00:03:16.220> super<00:03:16.700> glue<00:03:16.909> and<00:03:17.209> you<00:03:17.750> glue<00:03:18.019> that

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
take your super glue and you glue that

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:23.140 
take your super glue and you glue that
to<00:03:19.099> your<00:03:20.030> hinge<00:03:21.220> make<00:03:22.220> it<00:03:22.370> so<00:03:22.579> the<00:03:22.879> hole<00:03:23.120> is

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
to your hinge make it so the hole is

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:27.069 
to your hinge make it so the hole is
about<00:03:23.810> over<00:03:24.200> the<00:03:24.319> hinge<00:03:24.560> line<00:03:25.450> and<00:03:26.450> once<00:03:26.780> that

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:27.079 
about over the hinge line and once that

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:29.379 
about over the hinge line and once that
initial<00:03:27.379> glue<00:03:27.889> dries<00:03:28.190> put<00:03:28.730> on<00:03:28.819> a<00:03:28.849> little<00:03:29.090> more

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:29.389 
initial glue dries put on a little more

00:03:29.389 --> 00:03:32.800 
initial glue dries put on a little more
glue<00:03:29.690> and<00:03:30.079> then<00:03:31.010> once<00:03:31.250> that<00:03:31.400> glue<00:03:31.970> dries<00:03:32.329> I

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
glue and then once that glue dries I

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:35.020 
glue and then once that glue dries I
like<00:03:33.590> to<00:03:33.739> reinforce<00:03:34.069> it<00:03:34.519> with<00:03:34.549> some<00:03:34.790> hot<00:03:35.000> glue

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
like to reinforce it with some hot glue

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:37.050 
like to reinforce it with some hot glue
because<00:03:35.840> the<00:03:35.930> last<00:03:36.109> thing<00:03:36.230> you<00:03:36.349> want<00:03:36.590> is<00:03:36.680> a

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
because the last thing you want is a

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.629 
because the last thing you want is a
hinge<00:03:38.060> or<00:03:38.450> control<00:03:39.019> form<00:03:39.349> popping<00:03:40.310> off<00:03:40.459> your

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:40.639 
hinge or control form popping off your

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:45.839 
hinge or control form popping off your
airplane<00:03:43.359> and<00:03:44.359> once<00:03:44.599> the<00:03:44.780> hot<00:03:44.959> glue<00:03:45.230> dries

00:03:45.839 --> 00:03:45.849 
airplane and once the hot glue dries

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:49.569 
airplane and once the hot glue dries
you're<00:03:46.849> done<00:03:47.269> you<00:03:47.689> can<00:03:47.840> just<00:03:47.870> put<00:03:48.260> a<00:03:48.579> control

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:49.579 
you're done you can just put a control

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:52.059 
you're done you can just put a control
rod<00:03:49.819> through<00:03:50.209> it<00:03:50.329> and<00:03:50.620> you<00:03:51.620> got<00:03:51.799> a<00:03:51.829> great

00:03:52.059 --> 00:03:52.069 
rod through it and you got a great

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:54.849 
rod through it and you got a great
little<00:03:52.489> hinge<00:03:52.930> so<00:03:53.930> that's<00:03:54.169> about<00:03:54.410> it<00:03:54.680> and

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:54.859 
little hinge so that's about it and

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:57.730 
little hinge so that's about it and
thanks<00:03:55.549> for<00:03:55.669> watching
