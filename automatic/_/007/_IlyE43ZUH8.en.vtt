00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
you would not think about cleaning the

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.520 
you would not think about cleaning the
sink<00:00:09.120> and<00:00:09.269> then<00:00:09.360> putting<00:00:09.690> dirty<00:00:09.929> dishes<00:00:10.200> right

sink and then putting dirty dishes right
back<00:00:10.740> into<00:00:11.010> it<00:00:11.340> it's<00:00:11.490> the<00:00:11.580> same<00:00:11.759> concept<00:00:12.090> with

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
back into it it's the same concept with

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.049 
back into it it's the same concept with
windows<00:00:12.960> when<00:00:13.559> the<00:00:13.650> windows<00:00:13.950> get<00:00:14.130> cleaned<00:00:14.519> the

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
windows when the windows get cleaned the

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:16.790 
windows when the windows get cleaned the
screens<00:00:15.480> really<00:00:15.900> need<00:00:16.170> to<00:00:16.260> be<00:00:16.379> clean<00:00:16.650> when

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
screens really need to be clean when

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.620 
screens really need to be clean when
they<00:00:16.920> get<00:00:17.039> put<00:00:17.279> back<00:00:17.460> on<00:00:17.699> otherwise<00:00:18.150> there's<00:00:18.570> a

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
they get put back on otherwise there's a

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.220 
they get put back on otherwise there's a
good<00:00:18.900> chance<00:00:19.170> that<00:00:19.529> the<00:00:20.600> dust<00:00:21.600> and<00:00:21.840> dirt<00:00:22.020> and

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
good chance that the dust and dirt and

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.439 
good chance that the dust and dirt and
pollen<00:00:22.529> and<00:00:22.949> all<00:00:23.039> that<00:00:23.250> gross<00:00:23.760> particulate

pollen and all that gross particulate
that's<00:00:24.689> on<00:00:24.960> there<00:00:25.260> is<00:00:25.470> going<00:00:25.980> to<00:00:26.039> get<00:00:26.250> right

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
that's on there is going to get right

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.480 
that's on there is going to get right
back<00:00:26.789> onto<00:00:27.029> the<00:00:27.240> clean<00:00:27.480> window<00:00:27.840> so<00:00:28.500> a<00:00:28.890> peck<00:00:29.460> and

actually get soaked

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.030 
actually get soaked
rinse<00:00:36.090> and<00:00:36.329> hand<00:00:36.840> dried<00:00:37.170> and<00:00:37.590> then<00:00:37.800> they<00:00:37.920> get

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
rinse and hand dried and then they get

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.850 
rinse and hand dried and then they get
reinstalled<00:00:38.790> after<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:40.020> windows<00:00:40.350> are<00:00:40.530> clean

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
reinstalled after the windows are clean

so you always have a really clean

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.979 
so you always have a really clean
product<00:00:43.829> and<00:00:44.420> clean<00:00:45.420> windows<00:00:45.719> that<00:00:45.840> are<00:00:45.899> going

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
product and clean windows that are going

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.340 
product and clean windows that are going
to<00:00:46.050> last<00:00:46.289> a<00:00:46.530> lot<00:00:46.680> longer<00:00:46.739> so<00:00:48.140> I'll<00:00:49.140> go<00:00:49.320> through

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
to last a lot longer so I'll go through

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.619 
to last a lot longer so I'll go through
the<00:00:49.559> process<00:00:49.980> real<00:00:50.309> quick

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:53.629 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:01:02.560 

but<00:00:54.629> first<00:00:54.840> of<00:00:54.960> all<00:00:54.989> of<00:00:55.140> them<00:00:55.260> are<00:00:55.379> soaked

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:02.570 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.780 

all<00:01:03.440> right<00:01:03.530> so<00:01:03.830> now<00:01:03.950> all<00:01:04.100> the<00:01:04.280> screens<00:01:04.640> have

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 
all right so now all the screens have

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.560 
all right so now all the screens have
been<00:01:05.230> sprayed<00:01:06.520> with<00:01:07.520> the<00:01:07.550> cleaning<00:01:08.000> solution

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
been sprayed with the cleaning solution

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.570 
been sprayed with the cleaning solution
and<00:01:08.660> they're<00:01:09.050> soaking<00:01:09.440> so<00:01:10.190> what<00:01:10.310> this<00:01:10.460> is

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:10.580 
and they're soaking so what this is

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:12.490 
and they're soaking so what this is
going<00:01:10.700> to<00:01:10.760> do<00:01:10.910> is<00:01:11.030> going<00:01:11.150> to<00:01:11.240> suspend<00:01:11.750> a<00:01:12.020> lot<00:01:12.320> of

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
going to do is going to suspend a lot of

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.590 
going to do is going to suspend a lot of
the<00:01:12.620> dirt<00:01:12.920> and<00:01:13.490> the<00:01:13.580> pollen<00:01:14.090> and<00:01:14.360> all<00:01:14.480> the

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 
the dirt and the pollen and all the

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.070 
the dirt and the pollen and all the
particulate<00:01:15.140> the<00:01:15.440> 3030<00:01:16.100> and<00:01:16.540> it'll<00:01:17.540> get<00:01:17.750> it<00:01:17.870> so

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.080 
particulate the 3030 and it'll get it so

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.140 
particulate the 3030 and it'll get it so
it's<00:01:18.320> it's<00:01:18.680> soft<00:01:19.040> and<00:01:19.280> it<00:01:19.430> can<00:01:19.550> easily<00:01:19.820> be

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:20.150 
it's it's soft and it can easily be

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.270 
it's it's soft and it can easily be
rinsed<00:01:20.480> off<00:01:20.600> so<00:01:20.990> the<00:01:21.110> next<00:01:21.290> step<00:01:21.590> is<00:01:21.890> actually

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
rinsed off so the next step is actually

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.370 
rinsed off so the next step is actually
doing<00:01:22.550> that<00:01:22.700> we're<00:01:22.970> gonna<00:01:23.060> rinse<00:01:23.660> the<00:01:23.990> screens

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
northwest stuff that that just happens

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.330 
northwest stuff that that just happens

shine<00:02:21.330> to<00:02:21.360> them<00:02:21.660> which<00:02:21.840> is<00:02:21.870> kind<00:02:22.170> of<00:02:22.290> nice<00:02:22.730> so

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
shine to them which is kind of nice so

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.120 
shine to them which is kind of nice so
what<00:02:23.880> happens<00:02:24.330> now<00:02:24.870> is<00:02:25.170> that<00:02:25.200> these<00:02:25.800> will<00:02:26.010> go

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
what happens now is that these will go

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.250 
what happens now is that these will go
back<00:02:26.370> and<00:02:26.730> they'll<00:02:26.910> be<00:02:27.030> staged<00:02:27.360> outside<00:02:27.660> so

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
back and they'll be staged outside so

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.050 
back and they'll be staged outside so
once<00:02:28.410> the<00:02:28.590> outside<00:02:28.740> windows<00:02:29.370> are<00:02:29.520> clean

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
once the outside windows are clean

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.020 
once the outside windows are clean
they'll<00:02:30.510> just<00:02:30.750> be<00:02:30.960> a<00:02:30.990> place<00:02:31.590> back<00:02:31.920> in<00:02:32.220> if<00:02:32.670> these

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
they'll just be a place back in if these

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.360 
they'll just be a place back in if these
were<00:02:33.210> screens<00:02:33.600> that<00:02:33.840> are<00:02:33.900> on<00:02:34.170> the<00:02:34.260> inside<00:02:34.440> like

would be stacked up and staged at an
entry<00:02:48.120> point<00:02:48.150> in<00:02:48.510> the<00:02:48.570> house<00:02:48.750> preferably<00:02:49.350> kind

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
entry point in the house preferably kind

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.860 
entry point in the house preferably kind
of<00:02:50.010> in<00:02:50.100> the<00:02:50.220> Sun<00:02:50.430> cuz<00:02:50.700> sometimes<00:02:51.330> water<00:02:51.750> gets

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
of in the Sun cuz sometimes water gets

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.950 
of in the Sun cuz sometimes water gets
in<00:02:52.200> this<00:02:52.350> channel<00:02:52.710> and<00:02:53.480> it<00:02:54.480> takes<00:02:54.690> a<00:02:54.810> little

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:54.960 
in this channel and it takes a little

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.540 
in this channel and it takes a little
bit<00:02:55.110> for<00:02:55.170> that<00:02:55.470> to<00:02:55.620> dry<00:02:55.830> we<00:02:56.100> don't<00:02:56.250> want<00:02:56.400> to

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
bit for that to dry we don't want to

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.210 
bit for that to dry we don't want to
walk<00:02:57.180> through<00:02:57.450> the<00:02:57.540> house<00:02:57.750> dripping<00:02:58.410> screens

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
walk through the house dripping screens

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.060 
walk through the house dripping screens
so<00:02:59.400> we<00:02:59.520> let<00:02:59.700> those<00:02:59.880> dry<00:03:00.210> and<00:03:00.690> so<00:03:01.260> they<00:03:01.800> would<00:03:01.950> be

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
so we let those dry and so they would be

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.370 
so we let those dry and so they would be
put<00:03:02.310> in<00:03:02.430> at<00:03:02.640> the<00:03:02.760> very<00:03:02.940> end<00:03:03.300> of<00:03:03.510> the<00:03:03.870> job<00:03:04.050> which

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
put in at the very end of the job which

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:09.170 
put in at the very end of the job which
is<00:03:05.810> allows<00:03:06.810> them<00:03:07.110> the<00:03:07.410> time<00:03:07.650> to<00:03:08.040> to<00:03:08.489> dry<00:03:08.760> so
