00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:03.600 
now as a general rule of thumb anything

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.240 
now as a general rule of thumb anything
that<00:00:03.750> looks<00:00:03.959> good<00:00:04.200> under<00:00:04.589> high<00:00:04.830> quality

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
that looks good under high quality

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.720 
that looks good under high quality
rendering<00:00:05.870> looks<00:00:06.870> good<00:00:07.140> in<00:00:07.319> game<00:00:07.560> okay<00:00:08.519> i

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
rendering looks good in game okay i

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.950 
rendering looks good in game okay i
think<00:00:08.849> i<00:00:09.120> mentioned<00:00:09.330> that<00:00:09.570> before<00:00:11.269> in<00:00:12.269> game<00:00:12.330> we

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
think i mentioned that before in game we

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.120 
think i mentioned that before in game we
do<00:00:13.110> not<00:00:13.259> have<00:00:13.500> fancy<00:00:14.070> things<00:00:14.340> that<00:00:14.670> make<00:00:14.940> allow

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:16.130 
do not have fancy things that make allow

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:19.310 
do not have fancy things that make allow
render<00:00:17.130> you<00:00:17.760> know<00:00:17.880> so<00:00:18.180> if<00:00:18.390> i<00:00:18.510> if<00:00:18.750> i<00:00:18.869> rendered

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
render you know so if i if i rendered

render you know so if i if i rendered
out<00:00:19.439> something<00:00:20.300> this<00:00:21.300> is<00:00:21.449> just<00:00:21.750> mental<00:00:22.170> ray<00:00:22.380> we

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
out something this is just mental ray we

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.029 
out something this is just mental ray we
don't<00:00:22.859> have<00:00:23.039> mental<00:00:23.310> rain<00:00:23.640> games<00:00:24.890> that<00:00:25.890> would

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
don't have mental rain games that would

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.609 
don't have mental rain games that would
be<00:00:26.160> nice<00:00:26.340> to<00:00:27.300> be<00:00:27.390> able<00:00:27.480> to<00:00:27.630> render<00:00:27.869> real-time

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
be nice to be able to render real-time

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.260 
be nice to be able to render real-time
mental<00:00:28.980> ray<00:00:29.480> but<00:00:30.590> not<00:00:31.590> possible<00:00:32.070> yet<00:00:32.340> then<00:00:32.969> I

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
mental ray but not possible yet then I

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.030 
mental ray but not possible yet then I
don't<00:00:33.930> think<00:00:34.110> it<00:00:34.230> ever<00:00:34.260> will<00:00:34.500> be<00:00:34.770> because

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
don't think it ever will be because

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.540 
don't think it ever will be because
mental<00:00:35.370> raise<00:00:35.550> a<00:00:35.579> product<00:00:36.200> that<00:00:37.309> means<00:00:38.309> all

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
mental raise a product that means all

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.069 
mental raise a product that means all
game<00:00:38.790> engines<00:00:39.149> would<00:00:39.329> have<00:00:39.510> to<00:00:39.629> buy<00:00:39.840> into

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
game engines would have to buy into

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:47.720 
game engines would have to buy into
mental<00:00:40.500> ray<00:00:40.680> just<00:00:41.010> to<00:00:41.160> get<00:00:41.309> it<00:00:46.430> but<00:00:47.430> i<00:00:47.489> want<00:00:47.700> to

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
mental ray just to get it but i want to

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.930 
mental ray just to get it but i want to
show<00:00:47.910> you<00:00:47.940> this<00:00:48.239> and<00:00:49.460> what<00:00:50.460> I'm<00:00:50.489> going<00:00:50.610> to<00:00:50.730> do

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
show you this and what I'm going to do

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:57.430 
show you this and what I'm going to do
here<00:00:50.969> is<00:00:51.420> just<00:00:51.710> take<00:00:52.710> this<00:00:53.010> and<00:00:54.379> store<00:00:55.379> a<00:00:55.410> frame

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 
here is just take this and store a frame

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:03.360 
here is just take this and store a frame
okay<00:00:58.640> so<00:00:59.640> I'm<00:00:59.699> going<00:00:59.850> to<00:00:59.879> keep<00:01:00.180> this

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:03.370 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.730 

and<00:01:03.600> then<00:01:04.600> I'm<00:01:04.720> going<00:01:04.839> to<00:01:04.869> go<00:01:05.019> in<00:01:05.199> and<00:01:05.320> break

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:05.740 
and then I'm going to go in and break

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:19.210 
and then I'm going to go in and break
diffuse<00:01:10.500> render<00:01:11.500> it<00:01:11.590> out<00:01:11.680> again

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:26.950 

keep<00:01:19.940> it

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.840 

then<00:01:27.560> go<00:01:27.710> back<00:01:27.920> in<00:01:28.159> here<00:01:28.430> and<00:01:29.740> break<00:01:30.850> spectral

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850 
then go back in here and break spectral

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:41.550 
then go back in here and break spectral
color<00:01:35.080> render<00:01:36.080> it

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.680 

keep<00:01:42.189> it

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:45.690 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:02:01.060 

what<00:01:46.260> else<00:01:46.410> I<00:01:46.560> got<00:01:46.590> here<00:01:47.070> bump

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.840 

okay<00:02:01.700> so<00:02:02.390> what's<00:02:03.140> really<00:02:03.440> nice<00:02:03.590> now<00:02:03.890> is<00:02:04.159> you

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
okay so what's really nice now is you

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:06.280 
okay so what's really nice now is you
know<00:02:04.970> I<00:02:05.000> can<00:02:05.270> see<00:02:05.420> the<00:02:05.570> progression<00:02:05.750> of<00:02:06.229> things

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290 
know I can see the progression of things

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.940 
know I can see the progression of things
so<00:02:06.800> here<00:02:07.400> I<00:02:07.430> got<00:02:07.840> my<00:02:08.840> final<00:02:09.410> one<00:02:09.649> with

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
so here I got my final one with

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:15.400 
so here I got my final one with
everything<00:02:10.220> on<00:02:10.820> it<00:02:11.290> this<00:02:12.290> is<00:02:12.590> minus<00:02:14.410> the

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
everything on it this is minus the

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.980 
everything on it this is minus the
diffuse<00:02:15.970> so<00:02:16.970> you<00:02:17.060> can<00:02:17.180> see<00:02:17.300> that<00:02:17.330> not<00:02:17.810> much

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:17.990 
diffuse so you can see that not much

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:22.120 
diffuse so you can see that not much
difference<00:02:19.209> if<00:02:20.209> you<00:02:20.360> look<00:02:20.750> at<00:02:20.900> the<00:02:21.350> individual

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
difference if you look at the individual

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.250 
difference if you look at the individual
cracks<00:02:22.520> here<00:02:22.790> in<00:02:22.970> the<00:02:23.090> teeth<00:02:23.330> you<00:02:23.840> might<00:02:24.110> be

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
cracks here in the teeth you might be

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:25.390 
cracks here in the teeth you might be
able<00:02:24.320> to<00:02:24.470> see<00:02:24.620> a<00:02:24.650> difference<00:02:25.070> where<00:02:25.280> the

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
able to see a difference where the

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:31.140 
able to see a difference where the
shadow<00:02:25.700> turns<00:02:27.100> gray<00:02:28.100> okay<00:02:29.020> instead<00:02:30.020> of<00:02:30.050> black

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
shadow turns gray okay instead of black

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.610 
shadow turns gray okay instead of black
so<00:02:32.150> that's<00:02:32.330> a<00:02:32.480> that's<00:02:32.690> what<00:02:32.870> it<00:02:33.020> really<00:02:33.380> does

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
so that's a that's what it really does

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.610 
so that's a that's what it really does
it<00:02:33.860> makes<00:02:34.400> the<00:02:35.090> surface<00:02:35.720> the<00:02:35.989> flat<00:02:36.200> surface

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
it makes the surface the flat surface

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.580 
it makes the surface the flat surface
turn<00:02:36.800> white<00:02:37.040> and<00:02:37.220> it<00:02:37.820> strengthens<00:02:38.090> the<00:02:38.720> shadow

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
turn white and it strengthens the shadow

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.210 
turn white and it strengthens the shadow
by<00:02:40.010> making<00:02:40.489> it<00:02:40.640> not<00:02:40.790> such<00:02:41.450> a<00:02:41.480> bad<00:02:41.870> shadow<00:02:42.290> more

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
by making it not such a bad shadow more

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.910 
by making it not such a bad shadow more
of<00:02:43.370> a<00:02:43.520> grayish<00:02:44.330> shadow<00:02:44.780> than<00:02:45.140> black<00:02:45.700> okay<00:02:46.700> next

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
of a grayish shadow than black okay next

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.949 
of a grayish shadow than black okay next
you<00:02:48.920> can<00:02:49.100> look<00:02:49.250> at<00:02:49.459> the<00:02:49.640> specular<00:02:50.239> on<00:02:50.390> and<00:02:50.660> off

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:56.350 

and<00:02:54.100> then<00:02:55.100> we<00:02:55.220> can<00:02:55.400> look<00:02:55.519> at<00:02:55.640> the<00:02:55.760> bump<00:02:55.970> on<00:02:56.150> and

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
and then we can look at the bump on and

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.040 
and then we can look at the bump on and
off<00:02:57.489> big<00:02:58.489> huge<00:02:58.910> difference<00:02:59.360> between<00:02:59.720> the<00:02:59.840> bump

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.050 
off big huge difference between the bump

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:02.290 
off big huge difference between the bump
that's<00:03:00.560> a<00:03:00.739> good<00:03:00.980> thing<00:03:01.250> that<00:03:01.940> means<00:03:02.180> you<00:03:02.269> have

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:02.300 
that's a good thing that means you have

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.360 
that's a good thing that means you have
a<00:03:02.420> really<00:03:02.780> good<00:03:02.930> normal<00:03:03.350> map<00:03:03.530> and<00:03:03.769> that's

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
a really good normal map and that's

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.600 
a really good normal map and that's
that's<00:03:04.910> saying<00:03:05.299> a<00:03:05.450> lot<00:03:06.130> zbrush<00:03:07.130> 4<00:03:07.220> does

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
that's saying a lot zbrush 4 does

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:09.850 
that's saying a lot zbrush 4 does
produce<00:03:07.910> a<00:03:08.120> very<00:03:08.330> good<00:03:08.510> normal<00:03:08.900> map<00:03:09.080> it<00:03:09.470> never

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:09.860 
produce a very good normal map it never

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:12.370 
produce a very good normal map it never
it<00:03:10.370> sometimes<00:03:11.180> did<00:03:11.480> sometimes<00:03:11.930> didn't<00:03:12.170> it<00:03:12.260> was

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:12.380 
it sometimes did sometimes didn't it was
