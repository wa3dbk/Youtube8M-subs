00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 
great product so one of the first things

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:51.060 
great product so one of the first things
I'll<00:01:44.770> do

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.070 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.170 

is<00:01:51.790> I'll<00:01:52.570> actually<00:01:53.820> turn<00:01:54.820> the<00:01:55.000> lock

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:55.180 
is I'll actually turn the lock

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.270 
is I'll actually turn the lock
counterclockwise<00:01:55.720> because<00:01:56.500> I<00:01:56.830> need<00:01:57.010> to<00:01:57.040> turn

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
counterclockwise because I need to turn

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.670 
counterclockwise because I need to turn
it<00:01:57.490> clockwise<00:01:57.610> in<00:01:58.180> order<00:01:58.270> to<00:01:58.479> groom<00:01:58.720> it<00:01:58.840> and<00:01:59.050> I

00:01:59.670 --> 00:01:59.680 
it clockwise in order to groom it and I

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.050 
it clockwise in order to groom it and I
hold<00:02:00.040> it<00:02:00.190> close<00:02:00.520> to<00:02:01.530> the<00:02:02.530> edge<00:02:02.560> of<00:02:02.890> the<00:02:03.010> tool<00:02:03.250> so

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
hold it close to the edge of the tool so

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.650 
hold it close to the edge of the tool so
I<00:02:04.090> have<00:02:04.300> control<00:02:04.869> over<00:02:06.119> the<00:02:07.119> turning<00:02:07.570> I'm

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:07.660 
I have control over the turning I'm

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:10.080 
I have control over the turning I'm
making<00:02:08.020> sure<00:02:08.229> that<00:02:08.440> it's<00:02:08.649> turning<00:02:09.070> as<00:02:09.190> it's

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
making sure that it's turning as it's

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.780 
making sure that it's turning as it's
being<00:02:10.240> packed<00:02:10.630> and<00:02:10.869> smooth<00:02:11.170> and<00:02:11.500> if<00:02:12.250> I<00:02:12.400> hold<00:02:12.610> it

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
being packed and smooth and if I hold it

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.590 
being packed and smooth and if I hold it
down<00:02:13.000> here<00:02:13.570> and<00:02:13.890> I<00:02:14.890> try<00:02:15.190> to<00:02:15.220> turn<00:02:16.090> it<00:02:16.330> then<00:02:16.510> I

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
down here and I try to turn it then I

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.150 
down here and I try to turn it then I
don't<00:02:16.810> have<00:02:16.990> control<00:02:17.350> over<00:02:17.470> it<00:02:17.709> and<00:02:17.860> this<00:02:17.980> up

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
don't have control over it and this up

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.670 
don't have control over it and this up
here<00:02:18.340> is<00:02:18.370> turning<00:02:18.790> it's<00:02:19.150> very<00:02:19.450> important<00:02:20.020> that

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
here is turning it's very important that

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.440 
here is turning it's very important that
we<00:02:21.570> turn<00:02:22.570> the<00:02:23.560> lock<00:02:23.800> as<00:02:24.100> we<00:02:24.730> move<00:02:24.970> the<00:02:25.209> tool

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
we turn the lock as we move the tool

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.470 
we turn the lock as we move the tool
down<00:02:25.840> the<00:02:26.080> shaft<00:02:26.380> because<00:02:27.370> if<00:02:27.730> you<00:02:27.970> just<00:02:28.150> slide

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
down the shaft because if you just slide

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.400 
down the shaft because if you just slide
the<00:02:28.720> tool<00:02:28.930> straight<00:02:29.290> down<00:02:29.560> the<00:02:30.220> outer<00:02:30.430> hairs

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
the tool straight down the outer hairs

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.320 
the tool straight down the outer hairs
will<00:02:32.410> just<00:02:32.650> go<00:02:32.860> straight<00:02:32.890> and<00:02:33.459> it<00:02:34.000> will<00:02:34.120> make

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
will just go straight and it will make

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.890 
will just go straight and it will make
the<00:02:35.170> lock<00:02:35.380> look<00:02:36.150> unnatural<00:02:37.150> and<00:02:37.239> artificial

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
the lock look unnatural and artificial

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:45.170 
the lock look unnatural and artificial
so<00:02:38.590> we<00:02:39.340> want<00:02:39.550> to<00:02:40.530> turn<00:02:41.530> it<00:02:41.770> and<00:02:42.239> and<00:02:43.239> I'm<00:02:43.600> also

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
so we want to turn it and and I'm also

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.880 
so we want to turn it and and I'm also
lightening<00:02:46.180> the<00:02:46.360> pressure<00:02:48.330> of<00:02:49.330> the<00:02:50.019> McGriff

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
lightening the pressure of the McGriff

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.410 
lightening the pressure of the McGriff
original<00:02:51.340> La<00:02:51.459> Coruna<00:02:51.940> as<00:02:52.620> I<00:02:53.620> slide<00:02:54.269> so<00:02:55.269> I'm

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
original La Coruna as I slide so I'm

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.789 
original La Coruna as I slide so I'm
giving<00:02:55.870> the<00:02:55.989> lock<00:02:56.200> room<00:02:57.510> to<00:02:58.510> move<00:02:58.750> through<00:02:59.230> the

00:02:59.789 --> 00:02:59.799 
giving the lock room to move through the
