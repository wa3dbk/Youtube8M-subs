00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
workers have told us in those kind of

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.050 
workers have told us in those kind of
countries<00:02:40.290> that<00:02:41.040> they<00:02:41.310> feel<00:02:41.580> less<00:02:41.820> safe

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
countries that they feel less safe

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.790 
countries that they feel less safe
because<00:02:42.450> they're<00:02:42.630> forced<00:02:42.960> to<00:02:43.200> go<00:02:43.500> underground

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
because they're forced to go underground

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.890 
because they're forced to go underground
they're<00:02:44.220> forced<00:02:44.550> to<00:02:44.700> meet<00:02:44.940> people<00:02:45.600> in<00:02:45.750> their

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
they're forced to meet people in their

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.900 
they're forced to meet people in their
homes<00:02:46.170> for<00:02:46.590> example<00:02:47.100> and<00:02:47.280> so<00:02:47.640> ultimately

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
homes for example and so ultimately

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.200 
homes for example and so ultimately
again<00:02:48.480> it<00:02:48.600> has<00:02:48.750> the<00:02:48.870> same<00:02:49.110> impact<00:02:49.350> as

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:50.210 
again it has the same impact as

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:52.880 
again it has the same impact as
criminalizing<00:02:51.210> of<00:02:51.390> sex<00:02:51.900> workers<00:02:52.110> themselves

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
criminalizing of sex workers themselves

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.370 
criminalizing of sex workers themselves
the<00:02:53.220> same<00:02:53.460> goes<00:02:53.730> for<00:02:53.760> third<00:02:54.720> parties<00:02:55.170> for

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
the same goes for third parties for

the same goes for third parties for

Brussels for exploiters of course we're
against<00:02:58.050> exploitation<00:02:58.490> but<00:02:59.490> we<00:02:59.640> don't

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
against exploitation but we don't

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.840 
against exploitation but we don't
believe<00:03:00.150> that<00:03:00.230> criminalizing<00:03:01.230> broadly<00:03:02.190> sex

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
believe that criminalizing broadly sex

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:05.810 
believe that criminalizing broadly sex
work<00:03:03.090> protects<00:03:03.870> those<00:03:04.020> women<00:03:04.380> some<00:03:04.890> sex

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820
