potatoes potatoes great more potatoes so
it's<00:01:46.259> greater<00:01:46.590> than<00:01:46.740> theta<00:01:47.040> on<00:01:47.520> this<00:01:48.000> side

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
it's greater than theta on this side

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.460 
it's greater than theta on this side
here<00:01:48.750> is<00:01:49.009> a<00:01:50.090> teasel<00:01:51.090> which<00:01:51.869> is<00:01:52.049> a<00:01:52.079> medicinal

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.160 
burdock will come out potatoes will come
out<00:02:28.480> and<00:02:29.140> then<00:02:29.440> this<00:02:29.650> will<00:02:30.060> now<00:02:31.060> be<00:02:31.299> triggering

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
out and then this will now be triggering

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.140 
out and then this will now be triggering
new<00:02:32.410> ways<00:02:32.650> of<00:02:32.920> what<00:02:33.069> to<00:02:33.190> put<00:02:33.400> in<00:02:33.549> here<00:02:33.790> so<00:02:34.000> it

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
new ways of what to put in here so it

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.009 
new ways of what to put in here so it
next<00:02:34.480> year<00:02:34.720> the<00:02:35.349> our<00:02:35.799> main<00:02:36.690> perennials<00:02:37.690> will

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:38.019 
next year the our main perennials will

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:42.059 
next year the our main perennials will
get<00:02:38.200> bigger<00:02:38.530> and<00:02:38.799> eventually<00:02:39.640> will<00:02:41.069> there'll

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:42.069 
get bigger and eventually will there'll

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:44.580 
get bigger and eventually will there'll
be<00:02:42.099> a<00:02:42.220> new<00:02:42.549> assemblage<00:02:43.150> of<00:02:43.299> plants<00:02:43.900> so<00:02:44.110> changes

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
be a new assemblage of plants so changes

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.800 
be a new assemblage of plants so changes
over<00:02:44.829> time<00:02:45.099> but<00:02:45.790> we<00:02:45.940> close<00:02:46.450> canopies<00:02:47.110> the<00:02:47.319> goal

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
over time but we close canopies the goal

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.470 
over time but we close canopies the goal
no<00:02:49.810> Here<00:02:50.500> I<00:02:50.530> am<00:02:50.650> stoking<00:02:51.430> the<00:02:51.549> lovely<00:02:52.120> chase

in the Middle Ages vitex Agnes Costas

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:01.069 
in the Middle Ages vitex Agnes Costas
but<00:02:59.260> they<00:02:59.410> find<00:02:59.709> it's<00:02:59.890> great<00:03:00.459> for<00:03:00.730> menopause

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:01.079 
but they find it's great for menopause

but they find it's great for menopause
women<00:03:02.079> and<00:03:02.410> you<00:03:02.920> know<00:03:03.040> what<00:03:03.160> there's<00:03:03.340> a<00:03:03.400> lot

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:03.579 
women and you know what there's a lot

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:05.610 
women and you know what there's a lot
more<00:03:03.730> menopausal<00:03:04.239> woman<00:03:04.540> than<00:03:04.840> monks<00:03:05.200> anymore

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
more menopausal woman than monks anymore

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.920 
more menopausal woman than monks anymore
so<00:03:05.890> mainly<00:03:06.459> that's<00:03:06.760> where<00:03:06.940> my<00:03:07.090> market<00:03:07.540> is<00:03:07.690> now

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
so mainly that's where my market is now

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.740 
so mainly that's where my market is now
but<00:03:08.620> it<00:03:08.739> makes<00:03:08.920> these<00:03:09.069> berries<00:03:09.670> bright<00:03:10.450> purple

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
but it makes these berries bright purple

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.839 
but it makes these berries bright purple
berries<00:03:11.260> but<00:03:11.859> any<00:03:12.010> rate<00:03:12.220> the<00:03:12.370> reason<00:03:12.700> we're

00:03:12.839 --> 00:03:12.849 
berries but any rate the reason we're

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:15.210 
berries but any rate the reason we're
here<00:03:13.030> is<00:03:13.090> this<00:03:13.329> is<00:03:13.510> closed-canopy<00:03:14.319> number

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
here is this is closed-canopy number

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.390 
here is this is closed-canopy number
three<00:03:16.200> so<00:03:17.200> we're<00:03:17.349> looking<00:03:17.650> at<00:03:17.769> crossing<00:03:18.250> a

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
three so we're looking at crossing a

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.610 
three so we're looking at crossing a
little<00:03:18.639> chunk<00:03:18.910> of<00:03:19.000> the<00:03:19.120> garden<00:03:19.540> here<00:03:19.810> and<00:03:20.109> this

little chunk of the garden here and this

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.650 
little chunk of the garden here and this
is<00:03:20.769> going<00:03:20.889> to<00:03:20.950> be<00:03:21.099> an<00:03:21.250> agroforestry<00:03:21.730> system

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
is going to be an agroforestry system

the Great Plains super-tough this is a

the Great Plains super-tough this is a
when<00:05:56.000> I<00:05:56.030> bought<00:05:56.300> it<00:05:56.330> with<00:05:56.599> supposedly<00:05:57.199> a

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:57.280 
when I bought it with supposedly a

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:00.129 
when I bought it with supposedly a
thornless<00:05:58.280> honeylocust<00:05:58.780> but<00:05:59.780> this<00:05:59.990> is<00:06:00.110> a

00:06:00.129 --> 00:06:00.139 
thornless honeylocust but this is a

00:06:00.139 --> 00:06:03.689 
thornless honeylocust but this is a
thorny<00:06:00.680> one<00:06:00.800> so<00:06:01.039> they<00:06:01.159> don't<00:06:01.280> grade<00:06:01.580> very<00:06:01.909> well

00:06:03.689 --> 00:06:03.699 
thorny one so they don't grade very well

00:06:03.699 --> 00:06:06.339 
thorny one so they don't grade very well
but<00:06:04.699> I'm<00:06:05.090> letting<00:06:05.330> it<00:06:05.509> grow<00:06:05.659> anyway<00:06:06.050> because<00:06:06.199> I

00:06:06.339 --> 00:06:06.349 
but I'm letting it grow anyway because I

00:06:06.349 --> 00:06:08.140 
but I'm letting it grow anyway because I
wanted<00:06:06.590> to<00:06:06.650> honey<00:06:06.949> locust<00:06:07.400> here<00:06:07.700> so<00:06:08.029> I'll<00:06:08.120> be

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:08.150 
wanted to honey locust here so I'll be

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:08.970 
wanted to honey locust here so I'll be
pruning<00:06:08.539> it<00:06:08.719> up

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:08.980 
pruning it up

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:11.880 
pruning it up
to<00:06:09.490> a<00:06:09.520> central<00:06:10.150> leader<00:06:10.360> and<00:06:11.050> have<00:06:11.230> the<00:06:11.440> thorny

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:11.890 
to a central leader and have the thorny

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:14.910 
to a central leader and have the thorny
branches<00:06:12.130> way<00:06:12.640> up<00:06:12.820> there<00:06:13.120> and<00:06:13.710> so<00:06:14.710> you<00:06:14.800> can

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:14.920 
branches way up there and so you can

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:18.930 
branches way up there and so you can
walk<00:06:15.130> around<00:06:15.310> under<00:06:15.790> it<00:06:15.880> so<00:06:17.490> of<00:06:18.490> course<00:06:18.670> this

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:18.940 
walk around under it so of course this

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:21.330 
walk around under it so of course this
little<00:06:19.020> companion<00:06:20.020> shrub<00:06:20.320> here<00:06:20.620> growing<00:06:21.130> next

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:21.340 
little companion shrub here growing next

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:22.370 
little companion shrub here growing next
to<00:06:21.520> it

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:22.380 
to it

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:25.020 
to it
thorny<00:06:23.380> enough<00:06:23.560> as<00:06:23.770> it<00:06:23.950> is<00:06:24.040> so<00:06:24.160> actually<00:06:24.820> this

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:25.030 
thorny enough as it is so actually this

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:28.110 
thorny enough as it is so actually this
is<00:06:25.270> just<00:06:25.300> a<00:06:25.720> thorny<00:06:26.230> spot<00:06:26.530> and<00:06:27.120> interestingly

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:28.120 
is just a thorny spot and interestingly

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:30.600 
is just a thorny spot and interestingly
enough<00:06:28.510> here's<00:06:28.930> the<00:06:29.140> gooseberry<00:06:29.740> also<00:06:30.370> very

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:30.610 
enough here's the gooseberry also very

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:33.060 
enough here's the gooseberry also very
thorny<00:06:30.970> so<00:06:31.660> this<00:06:31.870> is<00:06:32.020> the<00:06:32.170> thorny<00:06:32.620> part<00:06:32.890> of<00:06:32.980> the

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:33.070 
thorny so this is the thorny part of the

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:36.570 
thorny so this is the thorny part of the
garden<00:06:33.870> it's<00:06:34.870> a<00:06:34.960> bit<00:06:35.110> of<00:06:35.260> you<00:06:36.040> can<00:06:36.190> see<00:06:36.430> what

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:36.580
