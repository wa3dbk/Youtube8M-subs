00:00:58.959 --> 00:00:58.969 
we have a poor reverser here which

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:01.910 
we have a poor reverser here which
activates<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.239> motor<00:01:00.500> when<00:01:01.500> properly

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
activates the motor when properly

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.130 
activates the motor when properly
engaged<00:01:02.420> as<00:01:03.420> you<00:01:03.629> can<00:01:03.780> see<00:01:04.250> we<00:01:05.250> have<00:01:05.519> a

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.140 
engaged as you can see we have a

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.899 
engaged as you can see we have a
changeover<00:01:07.140> catch<00:01:07.500> piece<00:01:07.799> which<00:01:08.310> switched

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
changeover catch piece which switched

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.010 
changeover catch piece which switched
which<00:01:09.510> changes<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.080> driving<00:01:10.409> rings<00:01:12.020> so

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
which changes the driving rings so

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.160 
which changes the driving rings so
pretty<00:01:13.710> cool<00:01:14.060> stay<00:01:15.060> tuned<00:01:15.270> out<00:01:15.450> front<00:01:15.780> more

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
pretty cool stay tuned out front more

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.440 
pretty cool stay tuned out front more
speed<00:01:16.560> gearbox<00:01:16.890> reviews<00:01:17.549> I<00:01:17.790> love<00:01:18.180> making

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
speed gearbox reviews I love making

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.810 
speed gearbox reviews I love making
gearboxes<00:01:19.290> seeing<00:01:19.560> how<00:01:19.680> they<00:01:19.799> work<00:01:20.009> so<00:01:20.280> this

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
gearboxes seeing how they work so this

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.010 
gearboxes seeing how they work so this
one<00:01:21.000> by<00:01:21.150> far<00:01:21.420> is<00:01:21.450> probably<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.900> most

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
one by far is probably the most

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.810 
one by far is probably the most
complicated<00:01:22.470> gearbox<00:01:23.070> I've<00:01:23.310> made<00:01:23.490> in<00:01:23.640> terms

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
complicated gearbox I've made in terms

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.830 
complicated gearbox I've made in terms
of<00:01:24.030> driving<00:01:24.299> rings<00:01:24.630> so<00:01:25.590> let's<00:01:25.860> just<00:01:26.040> see<00:01:26.450> it<00:01:27.450> in

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
of driving rings so let's just see it in

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.090 
of driving rings so let's just see it in
action<00:01:29.390> now<00:01:30.390> right<00:01:30.630> now<00:01:30.780> it's<00:01:30.990> in<00:01:31.110> neutral<00:01:31.350> so

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
action now right now it's in neutral so

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.910 
action now right now it's in neutral so
nothing<00:01:32.729> really<00:01:32.880> exciting<00:01:33.210> going<00:01:33.600> on<00:01:33.720> until

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
nothing really exciting going on until

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:41.440 
nothing really exciting going on until
we<00:01:34.920> go<00:01:35.070> on<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.250> first<00:01:35.509> gear

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450

switching the second shall we keep an
