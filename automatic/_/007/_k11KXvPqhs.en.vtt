00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:08.670
 the elite artplay production we represent 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.710
 continue to consider false facts 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:14.519
 this is part 2 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:16.350
 I read reviews from the past issue and 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:20.430
 noticed that people liked 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:23.220
 liked the idea but there were even individuals 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:26.670
 who wrote a type I came up with 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:30.060
 these facts honestly so laughed from 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.399
 souls thank you you made my day exactly 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.920
 so now the beginning of any fact i'm 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.780
 I will post the original message 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.670
 you read it yourself 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.280
 and understand that I did not invent anything 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:46.200
 I remind you that the essence of this issue 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:48.600
 show you show you what public 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:52.500
 at the moment they spread a lot 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:56.250
 false facts i'm just going to 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.559
 any public take the latest posts and 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:02.219
 find customs facts showing you 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:04.589
 it's very simple yes maybe these facts 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:07.260
 once worked is not the point 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:10.939
 the point is that they are laid out to this 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:13.950
 day and now people read and believe it 

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:18.630
 well let's get closer to 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:21.930
 deed a first false fact balm melancholy 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:26.130
 can speed up a snowball well let's 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:28.860
 check with us now we have a speed of 355 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.799
 doing a snowball speed is the same 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:35.540
 stays good 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:39.030
 use cutters 411th snowball faces 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:42.240
 fall off that is if we use a 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:46.649
 cutters then do dream bombs visas 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:49.110
 falls and does not have any speed up and be 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.090
 can we do during the ball again 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:55.979
 wave let's snowball 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:02:01.049
 and the phases are not pressed ie the nile phases 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:04.740
 the accelerating snowball does go ahead of 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:06.119
 of all heroes of dota 2 only lancer can 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.879
 kicks foot 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:12.300
 this is generally bullshit the most delusional 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:14.910
 fact in dota history for a lifetime which 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:17.160
 only could hear immediately for one 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.710
 second microsecond I remembered 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.420
 the bed of the bistmaster who could always beat 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:23.190
 by foot 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.720
 maybe also magnus can beat 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.720
 foot in 1 dota killed 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:30.860
 in the second I honestly do not remember, let's 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:34.110
 let's see phantom lancer 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:37.170
 Here is immediately the first blow was with legs 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:42.450
 ok, now let's see if 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:45.360
 beatmaster beat his foot much 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:48.830
 less often this punch but he can kick and 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.830
 we will see it now with you 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:07.690
 now everything will be here 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:11.459
 there was a kick from his feet but he yes he is much less likely 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:16.060
 than at Lancer well go further 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:20.709
 the gene works even if it's in a career 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:21.400
 also about anything let's say we have bounty 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:25.660
 hunter 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:26.200
 he goes to inviz we don't see him if 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.599
 task 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:31.959
 takes a gene we see bounty hunter 

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:35.579
 lay out the gel does not see the courier takes 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:35.579
 gene is not visible 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:44.160
 This fact does not work but the same 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:47.890
 courier can use a hatchet 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:50.099
 let's say there is a longing takes a hatchet he 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:53.200
 can use a hatchet correctly 

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:58.349
 lays out the hatchet the courier picks up 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:58.349
 hatchet he can't subject for a tug he 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:06.579
 Maybe because the courier does not go up and 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:10.299
 well let's try it upnut well 

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:13.780
 apnuli courier try again bounty 

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:16.739
 hunter goes to raise a game no 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:20.590
 we don't see the bounty hunter and no way 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:24.729
 raising the hatchet does not work either 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:28.210
 there were two false facts and the last 

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:33.039
 the last false fact is so for 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:34.750
 the destruction of the throne of gold is given 50 

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:37.500
 any kind of legend well let's 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:37.500
 check 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:56.259
 so getting ready here we see 31 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:56.259
 coin carefully watch 31 coins 

00:05:10.249 --> 00:05:15.559
 32 that is, we were not given anything for 

00:05:13.849 --> 00:05:18.889
 destruction of the throne 

00:05:15.559 --> 00:05:21.969
 This, too, is just another invention. 

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:21.969
 false facts
