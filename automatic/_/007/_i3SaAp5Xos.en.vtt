thing for shift light it had was a
little<00:00:22.960> LED<00:00:23.200> the<00:00:23.560> same<00:00:23.770> as<00:00:23.919> this<00:00:24.039> one<00:00:24.099> has

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:24.400 
little LED the same as this one has

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.359 
little LED the same as this one has
inside<00:00:24.939> attack<00:00:25.300> all<00:00:25.630> right<00:00:25.779> well<00:00:26.680> I<00:00:26.710> found<00:00:27.130> out

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:27.369 
inside attack all right well I found out

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:29.519 
inside attack all right well I found out
that<00:00:27.699> bouncing<00:00:28.570> through<00:00:28.720> the<00:00:28.840> mud<00:00:29.050> and<00:00:29.079> it's

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:29.529 
that bouncing through the mud and it's

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:32.339 
that bouncing through the mud and it's
only<00:00:29.680> 200<00:00:30.099> foot<00:00:30.369> so<00:00:31.059> a<00:00:31.090> lot<00:00:31.329> goes<00:00:31.570> on<00:00:31.779> that<00:00:31.930> 200

00:00:32.339 --> 00:00:32.349 
only 200 foot so a lot goes on that 200

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:35.880 
only 200 foot so a lot goes on that 200
foot<00:00:32.559> I<00:00:32.800> needed<00:00:33.730> to<00:00:34.440> kind<00:00:35.440> of<00:00:35.559> have<00:00:35.680> a<00:00:35.710> little

guidance<00:00:36.430> of<00:00:36.730> word<00:00:37.149> of<00:00:37.300> shift<00:00:38.579> you<00:00:39.579> know<00:00:39.670> I<00:00:39.730> can

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:39.910 
guidance of word of shift you know I can

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:41.369 
guidance of word of shift you know I can
hear<00:00:40.059> the<00:00:40.210> motor<00:00:40.450> and<00:00:40.660> everything<00:00:40.780> but<00:00:41.170> it's

00:00:41.369 --> 00:00:41.379

kind<00:00:41.590> of<00:00:41.649> nice<00:00:41.800> to<00:00:41.860> have<00:00:42.039> that<00:00:42.160> reminder<00:00:43.230> to

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:44.230 
kind of nice to have that reminder to

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:47.610 
kind of nice to have that reminder to
shift<00:00:44.789> so<00:00:45.789> at<00:00:45.909> this<00:00:46.059> tack<00:00:46.390> you<00:00:46.659> got<00:00:46.839> the<00:00:47.079> front

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:47.620 
shift so at this tack you got the front

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:49.430 
shift so at this tack you got the front
controls<00:00:48.129> here<00:00:48.429> they'll<00:00:48.940> allow<00:00:49.120> you<00:00:49.179> to

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
controls here they'll allow you to

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.279 
controls here they'll allow you to
change<00:00:50.440> your<00:00:50.649> redline<00:00:51.899> change<00:00:52.899> your<00:00:53.109> shift

00:00:53.279 --> 00:00:53.289 
change your redline change your shift

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:54.989 
change your redline change your shift
points<00:00:53.800> and<00:00:53.949> stuff<00:00:54.069> like<00:00:54.249> that<00:00:54.519> so<00:00:54.760> you<00:00:54.850> can

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:54.999 
points and stuff like that so you can

00:00:54.999 --> 00:00:56.759 
points and stuff like that so you can
make<00:00:55.030> the<00:00:55.300> lights<00:00:55.510> illuminate<00:00:56.050> and<00:00:56.350> you<00:00:56.589> don't

00:00:56.759 --> 00:00:56.769 
make the lights illuminate and you don't

00:00:56.769 --> 00:00:58.319 
make the lights illuminate and you don't
really<00:00:56.949> have<00:00:57.190> to<00:00:57.339> be<00:00:57.429> looking<00:00:57.609> at<00:00:57.940> the<00:00:58.089> task

00:00:58.319 --> 00:00:58.329 
really have to be looking at the task

00:00:58.329 --> 00:00:59.479 
really have to be looking at the task
okay

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
okay

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.029 
okay
now<00:01:00.489> this<00:01:01.089> one<00:01:01.300> has<00:01:01.479> a<00:01:01.539> bigger<00:01:01.960> shift<00:01:02.739> light

00:01:03.029 --> 00:01:03.039 
now this one has a bigger shift light

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:06.450 
now this one has a bigger shift light
which<00:01:03.940> with<00:01:04.720> this<00:01:04.870> shift<00:01:05.170> light<00:01:05.440> you<00:01:05.710> can<00:01:05.920> move

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:06.460 
which with this shift light you can move

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.399 
which with this shift light you can move
this<00:01:06.729> ship<00:01:07.090> light<00:01:07.360> anywhere<00:01:07.720> around<00:01:07.870> the<00:01:08.170> tack

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:08.409 
this ship light anywhere around the tack

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:11.789 
this ship light anywhere around the tack
so<00:01:09.120> anywhere<00:01:10.120> you<00:01:10.180> mount<00:01:10.540> this<00:01:10.780> you<00:01:11.380> have<00:01:11.590> the

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:11.799 
so anywhere you mount this you have the

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:13.530 
so anywhere you mount this you have the
option<00:01:12.250> of<00:01:12.370> sliding<00:01:12.670> that<00:01:12.880> around<00:01:13.120> so<00:01:13.330> you<00:01:13.420> get

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:13.540 
option of sliding that around so you get

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.230 
option of sliding that around so you get
a<00:01:13.570> better<00:01:13.750> view<00:01:13.900> at<00:01:14.350> it<00:01:14.530> the<00:01:15.430> other<00:01:15.580> option<00:01:16.090> is

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
a better view at it the other option is

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.420 
a better view at it the other option is
you<00:01:16.299> can<00:01:16.630> take<00:01:16.840> this<00:01:17.050> shift<00:01:17.350> light<00:01:17.590> off<00:01:17.830> the

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:18.430 
you can take this shift light off the

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:20.130 
you can take this shift light off the
tack<00:01:18.820> and<00:01:19.120> you<00:01:19.300> can<00:01:19.480> mount<00:01:19.690> it<00:01:19.780> remotely

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.140 
tack and you can mount it remotely

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.550 
tack and you can mount it remotely
anywhere<00:01:20.770> in<00:01:21.040> the<00:01:21.280> truck<00:01:21.520> that<00:01:21.580> you<00:01:21.760> want<00:01:22.030> okay

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
anywhere in the truck that you want okay

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.100 
anywhere in the truck that you want okay
now<00:01:23.560> they<00:01:23.920> have<00:01:24.070> these<00:01:24.250> two<00:01:24.490> wires<00:01:24.730> here<00:01:25.110> which

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.110 
now they have these two wires here which

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:28.590 
now they have these two wires here which
it<00:01:26.290> allows<00:01:26.500> you<00:01:26.770> to<00:01:26.860> do<00:01:27.010> that<00:01:27.190> now<00:01:27.490> behind<00:01:28.390> this

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600 
it allows you to do that now behind this

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.880 
it allows you to do that now behind this
rubber<00:01:28.930> piece<00:01:29.230> here<00:01:31.080> there's<00:01:32.080> two<00:01:32.350> terminals

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
rubber piece here there's two terminals

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.630 
rubber piece here there's two terminals
you<00:01:33.760> simply<00:01:34.180> hook<00:01:34.300> the<00:01:34.450> two<00:01:34.630> wires<00:01:35.370> to<00:01:36.370> the<00:01:36.490> two

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 
you simply hook the two wires to the two

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.810 
you simply hook the two wires to the two
terminals<00:01:36.940> and<00:01:37.420> then<00:01:38.110> I<00:01:38.410> say<00:01:38.770> you<00:01:38.800> can<00:01:39.160> either

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:39.820 
terminals and then I say you can either

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.610 
terminals and then I say you can either
keep<00:01:40.030> this<00:01:40.270> chip<00:01:40.570> fly<00:01:40.810> don't<00:01:41.050> attack<00:01:41.350> or

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:41.620 
keep this chip fly don't attack or

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:43.260 
keep this chip fly don't attack or
remove<00:01:41.890> it<00:01:42.040> remotely<00:01:42.430> to<00:01:42.640> another<00:01:42.910> location

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
remove it remotely to another location

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.980 
remove it remotely to another location
you<00:01:43.660> can<00:01:44.260> also<00:01:44.910> buy<00:01:45.910> different<00:01:46.270> kind<00:01:46.630> of<00:01:46.720> shift

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990 
you can also buy different kind of shift

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.880 
you can also buy different kind of shift
light<00:01:47.230> if<00:01:47.500> you<00:01:47.620> prefer<00:01:48.070> amount<00:01:49.030> to<00:01:49.180> this<00:01:49.300> tag

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
light if you prefer amount to this tag

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:02.410 
that says you can go to a two cylinder

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:05.520 
that says you can go to a two cylinder
