three different methods that you can use
the<00:00:19.170> first<00:00:19.439> of<00:00:19.650> which<00:00:19.800> is<00:00:20.039> the<00:00:20.430> hit<00:00:20.640> method<00:00:21.060> you

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
the first of which is the hit method you

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.040 
the first of which is the hit method you
start<00:00:22.289> by<00:00:22.439> wrapping<00:00:22.619> the<00:00:22.949> bottom<00:00:23.220> in<00:00:23.310> a<00:00:23.400> towel
