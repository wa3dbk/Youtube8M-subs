00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:17.059
 the 

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:25.019
 she 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.560
 the 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:39.020
 it is a dream 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:40.790
 only Olympic medalist 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:42.400
 when you are 18 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.400
 we only use my first scene is crazy 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.570
 of world champion 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:49.679
 so for that I have a 

00:00:49.679 --> 00:00:51.519
 Olympic champion on the spot 

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:53.379
 shauna bring to light again 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:56.220
 ap 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.610
 she will face lille we are touching her teenage dream 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:05.460
 first game first gold medal and from this moment the first challenge 

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:08.969
 we already guess the gaze turned to the case to follow so 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.340
 another court of appeal without measuring how much all the different 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.240
 poor regions in the history of French sport they are no longer speed 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.730
 not having managed to retain their Olympic title 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:23.049
 in 2004 I was still 

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:26.040
 still there just 24 years old 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.520
 not a great international experience no experience 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:30.770
 Olympic 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.340
 so this year 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.270
 after four years of sony move 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:36.560
 I learned a lot 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.680
 and especially the experts of the dune who he claimed 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.420
 everything is different and for those who approach the days 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.420
 in the same way that a competition like 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:51.370
 a world cup or world championship the one you say is a 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:52.940
 competition like another 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.760
 I do not experience it like that it's really the players I felt 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.100
 different moment pressure 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.869
 for the first time it was to conquer something new 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:02.790
 for me 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.300
 for the second time it was more to defend something and yet I 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.829
 knew that the best strategy was not to 

00:02:08.829 --> 00:02:12.079
 to want too much to keep it was still to recover 

00:02:12.079 --> 00:02:14.849
 a little bit like someone who wanted him to pick up something 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:16.039
 thing 

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:17.869
 unexpected end of life 

00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:20.579
 unpublished in the sense that in my sport 

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:23.729
 a young man has no French had managed to keep an Olympic title 

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:27.559
 see you soon 28 euros he became the ambassador of the cross-country the 

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:30.039
 produces more than 4 million people in France 

00:02:30.039 --> 00:02:33.469
 this status that changes totally close to those of 2008 

00:02:33.469 --> 00:02:35.089
 he will go favorite 

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:36.120
 his fate 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.359
 technical supervision 

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:39.200
 close family to say that 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.459
 he knows he is expected of all 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:45.899
 no I do not think it's going to be 

00:02:45.899 --> 00:02:48.409
 - 5 

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:50.069
 one of the worst 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:52.329
 highest point its estimate for melt 

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:55.429
 - competition and yet win it 

00:02:55.429 --> 00:02:58.429
 created in 2003 by a sharp rebound of the courses 

00:02:59.429 --> 00:03:04.489
 thanks again since his first graphic novel we must not be a pariah 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:07.780
 headlines since returning to the Sochaux group 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.360
 this day of September 2007 it brings back a fourth consecutive title 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:13.769
 of world champion 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:17.769
 the record is eloquent man 8 estelle we always knew 

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:21.290
 a united France eccentricities in his personal life 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.550
 but an extreme requirement in the near of his sport 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:27.680
 with a gun on the other we can no longer assume our role 

00:03:29.619 --> 00:03:32.820
 I'm still there that words economy on that feeling 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:36.850
 at risk perhaps coming to its media aura the state is selling 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:40.099
 a personality we can 

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:42.189
 I am what I am 

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:44.999
 8% 

00:03:44.999 --> 00:03:48.859
 editing does not do it once I did not have a false image 

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:53.429
 focus on each entry per action 

00:03:53.429 --> 00:03:56.299
 and do the maximum and then it's time to come back with m 

00:03:56.299 --> 00:03:57.769
 the possible results 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:03:59.879
 and then available fully 

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:01.049
 for the media 

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:03.349
 rather than becoming now 

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:05.729
 on this circuit by permanent circuit 

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:09.779
 but even nick do not crash the game and then after we got scared because I 

00:04:09.779 --> 00:04:11.949
 am aware that 

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:14.949
 that I am interesting but now the docks 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:19.259
 in the evening the young people if they do not even have a medal 

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:20.949
 it's rather interesting for no one
