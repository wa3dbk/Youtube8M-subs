00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:26.510
 There was no happy and I remember 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:28.380

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.520
 city ​​me an idea and this will be something something 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.909

 obviously very proud because 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.010
 we know mario from the root of the program and 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.230
 I think you can move in him a young 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.450
 entrepreneur as much what they work 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.680
 in combat 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.750
 the truth is not quite proud system 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.700
 throughout this process of change and 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.400
 improvement for for mariví this is the 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.610
 reflex I think of the constant chamba and 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.610
 hard 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:42.459
 I feel very happy and proud of 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.819
 be seeing how ideas are made 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:46.819
 reality 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:49.370
 a business project of my son with 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:49.790
 your partner ricardo sanchez friend of all 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.870
 the life 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:57.230
 I hope that state institutions 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:59.840
 executive municipalities businesses 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.639
 private can support us in this 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.609
 project in fact we already have enough 

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:05.870
 advanced conversations and there's a lot 

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:09.049
 optimism for what can be done 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:12.959
 we want a country where driving is 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:15.510
 nice where to walk is nice 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:18.189
 in the idea arises when mario ricardo 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:22.170
 they are going to find us hooks and from a 

00:03:18.189 --> 00:03:24.760
 first moment we decided to support the idea 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.469
 because the concepts that they handled 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.569
 they were very much in line with ahmsa 

00:03:26.469 --> 00:03:30.909
 We are sure that with the effort and 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:33.099
 push that I put to things is going to 

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:35.019
 get ahead we think it's a great 

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:37.900
 challenge but we think that if all 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:41.560
 we participate we can achieve it we want 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:44.680
 be a year in a year and have 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:47.139
 results and generate that awareness in 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:50.379
 road publicity on the subject of ours let's say 

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:53.230
 we would enter a bit on the subject of 

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:57.340
 management for limited physical persons and 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:04:01.299
