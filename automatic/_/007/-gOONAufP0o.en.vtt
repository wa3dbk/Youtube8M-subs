00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.590
 especially great after that do 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.899
 do it yourself 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:40.739
 plus it will still be edible and useful 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:44.460
 what you need you need 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:46.199
 fruits that you have in the fridge 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.649
 whether you can purchase at any 

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:50.640
 supermarket and from this fruit we are with you 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.179
 we will make 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:57.629
 Christmas tree to make 

00:00:54.179 --> 00:01:00.749
 herringbone we need some kind of foundation where 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:03.449
 will fix our fruit in this 

00:01:00.749 --> 00:01:04.760
 I have already prepared a carrot from 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:09.870
 cut carrots 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:13.170
 a star give the trees traditionally always 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:15.930
 a star is on horseback to 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:20.730
 carrot confidently stood on a handful I 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:22.310
 cut a hole in an apple 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:25.590
 carrot and that's actually 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:28.500
 grounds for our new year fruit 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.100
 Christmas trees are ready you can make 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.810
 differently 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.750
 pay attention to me here 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.140
 pear pear can also put on his 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.960
 form 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.810
 pleasant enough tasty and edible 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.060
 ground for another fruit tree and 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.240
 so we will make ours today two 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:49.380
 options for Christmas trees one such assorted 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:52.710
 and another more restrained let's get down to 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:55.500
 to attach to our Christmas tree 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.280
 fruits that are also already harvested to us 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.730
 will need 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:02.430
 or toothpicks or if you have such 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:03.810
 here are the chopsticks for sandwich sticks 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.560
 I really like this case because 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:09.160
 as they are difficult to additional 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:12.360
 women for our Christmas tree begin 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:21.420
 shape a herringbone and 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:21.420
 attach some functions 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:38.120
 the foundation first we need you 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:41.390
 make beautiful grounds herringbone 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:45.510
 obviously must be bright juicy 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:46.200
 so I add more kiwi cues 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:51.170
 perfectly 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:56.430
 we will close the grounds and now we are with you 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:03:04.140
 we can proceed as follows 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:10.070
 poking some amount of toothpicks we 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:13.590

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:19.620

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:51.110
 adorn wine with enemies and 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:06.170

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:13.599
