00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:15.600
 very good, gentlemen, because 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:18.060
 dais to the saga call of duty I want to know 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:20.369
 those since the channel has already its good 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.170
 number of subscribers and such I think that already 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.689
 you can do a little research 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.460
 a little analysis of what the 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.669
 reasons why he hates the call of 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:32.250
 I want to know whether it's more reason 

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:35.070
 game itself or everything that surrounds the 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.750
 videogame not for example that hates and here 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.240
 what's more 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.970
 when you are playing and today a child comes out 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:46.650
 rat scream and the truth is that fuck 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:48.780
 pretty or that is riddled with trolls or 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:51.330
 be that the figure of the troll in 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.820
 videogames have been made great thanks 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:57.809
 to the call of duty or whatever it is 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.430
 the online community the online in 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.269
 because the online ers and 2 carlos 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:05.670
 nuclear or so perfect but good is 

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:08.250
 very well done but what is the 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.830
 community the thing already has to fall pretty 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.690
 not in addition to because I guess the 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.149
 soldiers in wars soldiers 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:21.200
 The young people were not very young 

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:24.210
 I know if 18 19 20 years but video games 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:27.420
 the soldiers who have the ones of a 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:30.750
 average age of 10 years or 11 with what 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.310
 what that would be really tragic was not 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.460
 boy they have not yet gone to 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.430
 instituto pega is pulled but good 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.370
 what's happening lately 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:42.010
 open syllable and that is 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:44.140
 what moved me and what if the 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:47.440
 online community if what I loved there 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:49.930
 his playing style is the style of play 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:53.050
 be so extremely fast that you 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:55.540
 focused on the online also but that 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:57.580
 that the game style very fast the 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:00.580
 action develops very quickly 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:03.040
 every time they kill you if it was not a 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:06.130
 too good player for every little bit 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.090
 time and again to go back to sticker or 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.220
 hit again 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.770
 maybe that mechanics to you not what 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:14.080
 you find too much sense who knows 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:16.240
 maybe not together simply because 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:19.960
 I am by team 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:24.010
 I do not know or do not tip because we're going to another one 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:27.180
 that hides in a good story offline 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:30.160
 not deliver it to play a player 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.950
 you are too attracted to 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.560
 history of the call of duty 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.629
 for us they are too short for 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.190
 example for example I wanted what you 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:40.620
 we went to another one in the head what 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.300
 round your heads to the best 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.819
 we just like games of 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.260
 war or the magic that we simply 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:49.709
 they like the first person shooter 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:52.800
 whatever your motive for that for 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:56.099
 to stop that is not just that you do not like the 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:58.280
 call of duty because the element already the 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:00.360
 last element to be hated 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.430
 directly then you can also 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.890
 hate him because I'm fed up with 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:07.319
 so much to hear it not so much in the media as 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:09.290
 in the kids that speak for the 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:11.420
 Street 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:14.989
 There are enough of that much 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:17.959
 information in your head that already 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:20.030
 is crying so much and you can be 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:22.459
 all that's why the mind of success so 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:24.950
 extremely large that he has had and that 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:26.239
 is launched in so many continent carlos 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:28.430
 they are thrown so very old 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:30.829
 You can also skip the call of duty 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:34.340
 because it brings that I've missed activision 

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:36.590
 a lot of cards and they throw a game every 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:39.049
 little time and there is hardly difference with 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:43.159
 the previous one or even the most bad one 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:45.829
 in the end all are all yours 

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:48.139
 reasons that is if you have more to do with 

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:51.560
 the video game itself or how is the 

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:53.120
 video game or that if they are already things 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:56.720
 and 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:59.599
 what are they about the 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:02.840
 context then is what is thrown the 

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:04.580
 videogame in short signs that nothing that 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.709
 have a great time with video games 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:09.140
 also connected tutillo to recognize 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:11.329
 that the saga call of duty I like 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:13.129
 I like the game mechanics and such 

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:14.629
 there are some elements of what has 

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:15.959
 taught that they do not cool me like 

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:19.030
 example 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:21.759
 activision to enjoy so much success 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:24.600
 by tracing the sacred and fallen with 

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:27.370
 its in terms of quality still online 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:30.340
 it's cool not to play him and such but now 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:32.110
 both the graphs begin no longer 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:34.509
 they surprise as much as those of the modern 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:37.030
 warfare mode of modern warfare 2 that 

00:04:34.509 --> 00:04:38.830
 the sound was very cool but the 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:41.560
 always sound the sound and in between 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:44.949
 very very well always in all the call 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:46.440
 of duty but there are already some call of duty 

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:49.150
 which is that they should not exist 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:51.370
 directly because the foregoing is already 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:53.620
 everything that is the call of duty has given 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:54.880
 gnomes for example in modern warfare 3 or 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:58.780
 the call of duty ghost 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:05:02.139
 Finally, gentlemen, what do you think? 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:05.710
 that you hate the call of duty saga that 

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:08.620
 you pass very well with video games and 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:10.780
 See what your reasons are 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:12.639
 given all you want but about 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:15.190
 they all left with one that has made them 

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:17.830
 the analysis I want to look at either 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:20.590
 house be in the future already another video 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:23.770
 based on your answers what 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:27.190
 happen to have the conclusions not 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:29.940
 be quite research we do 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:29.940
 micro game
