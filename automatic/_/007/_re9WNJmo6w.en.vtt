 of 400,000 euros 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.480
 just stay over football 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.950

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.480
 weather has improved again tonight too 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.219
 my ajax soccer yesterday cars already one 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.799
 bit on all competition of course 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.719

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.730

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.400

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.760
 looking forward to serious because ajax 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.170
 coming 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.789
 yes one of the farmer thief then day of 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.830
 this is funny here beforehand 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.109
 the worked before were still in nou camp 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.599
 You know at barcelona containing a 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.309
 you know your hairdresser and where you are camping 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.090
 people almost come into your dressing room 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.300
 That 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.950
 so back was also bald contractors 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.710
 dense so close is all on too 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.620
 the field and the funny thing was in urk 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.239
 my apparently quite ajax minded and 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.920
 radio plays from earth say yes citizens 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.450
 almost anyone from ajax would be your parents me 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.930
 I must tell you if we later corn operation 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.309
 is for both our memory 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:55.559
 no but it went what you did it 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.670
 really unwise good the first set you tot 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.719
 up to ajax 's first goal 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.460
 actually 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.690
 and yes they are just one more 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.920
 can take the lead a few times too 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.719
 yet 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.450
 and maybe also have to come yes so 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:09.090
 I'm so in final fires yesterday 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.470
 the channel that there are further pondered 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:15.150
 nine minutes the morning show expected 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:16.890
 for the phone for life just like that 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.930
 quickly just a line hello yes hello 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.939
 all yes good morning 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.830
 yes nice that i use your own logo 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.119
 just about ajax that you did 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.850
 he starts to print 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:29.970
 oh yes hear the week yes it is natural 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.829
 become magnificent victory if so 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.689
 certainly because it is actually between 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.890
 separates understanding yes well she wants that 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.909
 roll up with double digits but that is 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.950
 not all of them succeeded in the end of the rain 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.540
 tools but I would like this principle 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.960
 that to scale the slide and the 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.700
 forests score at dirk ingrid house 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.580
 adjusted from class to less moose me 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.500
 know when you're slippery playing football 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.000
 that remains especially with that 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.250
 Turks of course 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.830
 I already have your biggest opposition there 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:57.920
 he wanted Richter apple where did you get 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:02:00.530
 boys do what her big side wanted 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.840
 you must of course be very realistic 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.369
 amateur seems logical where do you have 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.450
 about turks you public what magma 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:06.890

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.560
 yes which turkish club where it actually 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.660

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.150

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:25.430

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.519
 combinate top layer save it is not 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.110
 nice to listen to what separates the 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:33.080
 thread and if you confuse you listen 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:35.480
 I said it I definitely good fun 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:37.160
 johan i told you he has this wisdom 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.120
 the big numbers must be out of your goal 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.069

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.540

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:51.540

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:55.390

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:04.530
