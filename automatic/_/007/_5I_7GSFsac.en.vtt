it would be tested for but it's

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.149 
it would be tested for but it's
definitely<00:02:58.689> hold<00:02:59.079> enough<00:02:59.290> for<00:02:59.530> us<00:02:59.560> very<00:03:00.010> proud

in<00:03:35.189> trying<00:03:35.459> to<00:03:35.670> do<00:03:35.819> what<00:03:35.969> we<00:03:36.090> did<00:03:36.299> to<00:03:36.450> it

00:03:36.589 --> 00:03:36.599 
in trying to do what we did to it

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:39.559 
in trying to do what we did to it
certainly<00:03:37.230> adding<00:03:37.980> an<00:03:38.099> excavator<00:03:38.790> to<00:03:39.150> remove

the rocks from the mix was probably an

the rocks from the mix was probably an
act<00:03:42.450> of<00:03:42.599> lunacy<00:03:43.170> yet<00:03:43.650> the<00:03:43.889> bed<00:03:44.129> survived<00:03:44.790> that
