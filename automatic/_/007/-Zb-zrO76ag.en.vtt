00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.390
 hello everyone welcome to the channel i am 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.520
 homeland and I bring you a new challenge to 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:22.150
 build on this occasion I'm going to challenge you 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:24.099
 that you decorate a cottage at 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:27.189
 first of all is that there is limit of 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:30.309
 you have a maximum of 150000 ximo 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:32.439
 Lions is not a very big house that 

00:00:30.309 --> 00:00:34.149
 have to furnish a lot or that you go to 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:35.890
 ask for very expensive things so I think 

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:39.370
 which is a limit that is pretty good 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:42.520
 and the little things I ask you to have is a 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:44.470
 large or small garden as you like 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.820
 thinking that then in the sims that live 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:49.240
 in this house they like the 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:52.360
 gardening or dedicate to cultivate not 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:54.520
 he also wants a careful exterior with 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:58.030
 a lot of pretty green you can put 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:01:00.010
 ponds berries or pools instead of 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.540
 pond as you want not but you have 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.309
 an exterior that attracts attention later 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.619
 what is inside the house is only 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:07.720
 necessary a room that is double 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:09.909
 for for example a marriage or a without 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.799
 only but good that is double and in the 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:14.890
 part of the top the house also has a 

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:16.720
 bathroom and on the bottom you see is 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.770
 very tiny does not have many 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.509
 bedrooms 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.329
 so, well, you can distribute as 

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:24.579
 you want a kitchen a dining room or 

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:27.280
 as you want, so you can not 

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:29.409
 modify the walls the stairs 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.509
 the roof with modify I mean 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:34.329
 move them a little square more here or beyond 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:36.009
 that can not be done neither walls nor 

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:39.219
 stairs and roof but if you can 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:41.740
 change the colors the tones of the 

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:43.869
 roofs or stairs also the 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.270
 You can change for others but you have to 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:47.530
 be where they are worth and good in 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.989
 this occasion can not be used 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.549
 personalized content because let's say 

00:01:49.989 --> 00:01:52.989
 that this house is going to focus more on what 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:55.720
 which is the exterior and then in the 

00:01:52.989 --> 00:01:57.880
 interior so that it is a house as well as 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:01.030
 cozy not the typical cottage 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:03.220
 that is how quality is then 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.380
 although you can not use content 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:07.479
 customized can you use then to 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.239
 work the pack day spa the pack 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:14.260
 of camping divine cuisine and party 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:16.810
 glamorous is to say everything except the pack 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.670
 accessories not dream yard 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.250
 and because I still do not have it and I'm 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.690
 doubting I'm going to buy it no but 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.579
 for example the camping pack is 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:27.310
 orders then surely you can use 

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:29.650
