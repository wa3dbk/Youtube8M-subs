00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.540
 special guest 

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:32.669
 Viola the camera comes alone 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:35.699
 Hello 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:39.329
 l my little nephew was going to come out in this video 

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:42.269
 and that's why I'm afraid that they'll charge me 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:46.170
 if something happens to him as he eats nephew and 

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:49.559
 well, this child is very lazy, you do not notice 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:52.229
 well know of what I speak because while 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.329
 He looks at the camera I will do a 

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:57.149
 cochinero 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.369
 and we started the pillow a book that you 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.820
 I made you sleep every time you tried 

00:00:59.369 --> 00:01:05.250

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.009
 book is hopscotch July cut the 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.110
 ever done I've finished reading the 

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:13.170
 I really do not like it 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.270
 nothing the book seems interesting to me but 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.940
 I do not like it besides that it makes me a 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.850
 macho book 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:22.370
 and it does not make me sleepy I can not read it 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:25.790
 in no way the mattress a book 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:28.160
 that has comforted you to read it 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:30.410
 I'm very prepared for this but that 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:34.640
 will be normal person of benito taibo 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:38.600
 It's a book that I really liked and what 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:40.370
 I read and I felt very relaxed and I do not know is 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.340
 that this book transmits you so many 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:45.620
 things and then it's a very very father book 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:49.140
 Hey you're messing up my books 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:52.190
 go look at the camera say hello 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.190
 tell them your name 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:57.000
 He said 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:00.080
 well nothing else 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.080
 tell them something 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:09.700
 number 3 the sweet dreams a book 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:12.640
 tender or romantic of those that seems 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:14.530
 that vomit rainbow and the truth is that 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:18.360
 I have not heard many romantic things 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.360
 but I think that would be 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:26.860
 I just broke 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.710
 a little thing in a book to see three the 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.050
 sweet Dreams 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:33.780
 a romantic tender book of those that 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.430
 it seems that vomit rainbow looks like the 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.340
 son under the same star of john 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:41.250
 green is I think that the brand is what 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:47.420
 most romantic I've read let me talk 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:47.420
 to see what is the book that comedians 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.330
 but if you do not protect them, you are 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:57.600

 choose let me in because there is a 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:07.080
 part of the book that although it is not very 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:09.000
 terrifying to me caused me a lot 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.410
 fear and I came to have nightmares with 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.430
 that part and I felt like I was going 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:16.189

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.990

 of shoes in the ashes of angels 

00:05:55.530 --> 00:06:00.570
 there was a part where the shoes 

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:02.760
 they are very important in that book although 

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:04.920
 it's not a specific shoe it's something 

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:08.640
 very funny and sad that has to do 

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:10.740

 cataloged as juvenile literature or

 children's literature but it is very dark and 

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:46.909
