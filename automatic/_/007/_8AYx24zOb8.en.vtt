00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:08.420
 and 

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:17.099
 we do not know what to do when we go to 

00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:19.420
 remember our eyebrows is to locate if 

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:22.180
 it's okay 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:25.980
 well marked our eyebrow normally 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:28.150
 to measure what you're going to use from your nose 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.689
 you're always going to measure your nose there 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.689
 starts 

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:36.250
 where your eye ends is supposed to 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:37.960
 you have to determine your eyebrows where 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.370
 is your pupil that's where it should be 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.560
 the arc 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:44.230
 those are the three points that you must 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:47.560
 keep in mind I always recommend them 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:49.120
 better that they use or that they go to the form 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:51.370
 of your eyebrows do not worry if you are not 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.680
 perfect at the end of accounts is your 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.420
 eyebrows 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.570
 Now what we should do is 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.540
 see if it is a little longer one 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:03.800
 of normal 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:06.770
 What I do is raise it and I can see 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:09.710
 the little piquitos extras and with that I can 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.630
 I recommend you use some 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.380
 scissors with round tip so you do not 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.380
 they are going to hurt 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.909
 and always leave 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:39.330
 I always left the brush 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.119
 they raise their little hair and there they leave it 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:45.180
 will always protect you from not passing or 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.310
 do not cut others your eyebrow is nothing more with 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.750
 lift them 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:51.680
 you can realize what it is 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.680
 you need to cut 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:54.689
 i 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:02.670
 and the little piquito in the end I like 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:06.520
 leave it a little long so as not to cut 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:09.120
 to give us are the tours that 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.120
 we need 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.190
 principal 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.080
 let's go to the other 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:26.290
 the same lifts 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:28.959
 but do not move this brush 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:31.599
 really if you realize everything 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:35.640
 this is marking my teacher 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:35.640
 you say old I'm never going to pass 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.940
 it does not have to be perfect the only thing 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:48.140
 that we want to remove 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.140
 the very long 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.720
 and now not many should recommend 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:58.970
 this but I always do it goes to 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.010
 use the profiler I will profile 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:03.640
 all the extra little hairs that I have in the 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.640
 top part 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:09.200
 the best I think the best way to 

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:13.080
 eyebrow plucking or trimming 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:16.770
 would be with thread when the battery 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:19.140
 this pulls the skin and eventually it 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:22.020
 is going to hang up then I think it's a very 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:24.270
 good option to shave with thread or with 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:26.490
 profiler I have read many articles 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:29.190
 that they say is a myth that is going to 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:31.020
 grow thicker and I think who is 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.820
 prone to much facial crime 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.750
 surely if it's going to be a little more 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:38.670
 gross 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.670
 and we send all the excess 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:49.880
 If you do not feel comfortable with the 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:53.090
 profiler do not use it 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:54.590
 from chance to locate well not 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:56.300
 anyone can do it if they are 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:04:00.370
 can go over and then that yes can 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:00.370
 be very counterproductive 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:07.620
 already with that our eyebrow has 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:09.390
 we remove all the excess of crimes and the 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.910
 we cut now what follows is 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:14.250
 paint it to paint it I will use 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:16.290
 anastasia in the color tag round is a 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:19.859
 little dark for me I 'm just going to 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:22.200
 use the clarito tone and the brush 208 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:24.930
 of brand the first thing I'm going to do is 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:27.010
 identify where I have the me 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:29.680
 I say pelonas 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:31.860
 where those little holes of 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.810
 eyebrow we have 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:36.800
 then once you identify them 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:36.800
 start there 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:51.640
 never go to paint your eyebrow with a 

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:53.890
 color and 24 shaggy or darker that's going to 

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:56.650
 cause it to look very fake like 

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:58.660
 tattooed and personally I think that 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:01.240
 the best you can do is make up 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:02.550
 paint your eyebrows the most natural 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:06.860
 possible 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:06.860
 and the tattoo does not look natural 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:30.889
 in the places where you have more 

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:34.580
 nice but you have some light 

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:37.729
 little holes as soon as you pass the 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:41.889
 brush and paint a little bit is not 

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:41.889
 you need to apply a lot of product 

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:56.870
 they can sell me the difference of a 

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:56.870
 closed inside 

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:21.229
 one 

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:32.540
 and finally I will spend the browser 

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:32.540
 anastasia 

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:38.850
 so that it stays in its place 

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:41.930
 and I pass now let's see if they appear 

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:41.930
 new holes 

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:51.850
 for this here I will use the color 

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:53.970
 dark of the same shadow had already 

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:53.970
 taught 

00:06:57.129 --> 00:07:02.669
 immediately fill in super easy 

00:07:02.729 --> 00:07:05.749
 and good here 

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:23.349
 this is the way in which I 

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:25.180
 I keep my eyebrows trimmed it outlined and 

00:07:23.349 --> 00:07:27.190
 he painted it a little bit, I hope it serves you 

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:28.569
 a lot of sun for many do not forget 

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:30.099
