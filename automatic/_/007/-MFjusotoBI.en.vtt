 9 heroes 9 basic blocks 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.190

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.920
 played bits you can open to 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.840

 and the struggle for supremacy will 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.140
 certainly not happen without 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.789
 interference magical fluctuations a 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.070
 respectively, every class I mean 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.930
 the hero has a unique one can say that 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.700
 and magic skill as well as unique 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.460

 in general bullets available to every hero and 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.460
 25 unique class k 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.500
 so in order of decks in the game 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.990
 hearthstone every player creates himself 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.150
 deck consists of 30 cards of all decks 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.829
 maybe 9 one for each class 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.600
 but thereâ€™s nothing wrong with that 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.090
 the opposite was done for your 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.040
 the common good because the maps are components 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.659
 deck can be changed before each fight and 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.009
 also so that dear captain and not 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.840
 forgot what deck they were yesterday 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.610
 piled on almost everyone in the arena and get 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.110
 new cards as a reward for their actions could 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.820
 supplement everything with something new and 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.369
 interesting on the chest typical and rare 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.740
 how besides getting a set of 5 cards 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.149
 reward for fighting in the arena a fee for which 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.590
 makes 150 gold 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.329
 you can just buy a pair of top three 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.970
 sets of completely ordinary store 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:58.160
 at the price of 100 g l d 1 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:00.650
 hand each set contains 5 cards one 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:03.140
 of which is always rare or even 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.340
 epic list of all existing on 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.260
 Greeks can be seen in his 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.270
 collection album and if you need it urgently 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.890
 wanted to become the owner of one of 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:12.110
 there is a possibility in the game 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.340
 create maps by using with 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.800
 skype magician or 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.390
 magic dust turn can 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.800
 get either in the arena or spraying 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.300
 an unnecessary set of look cards from already 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.550
 available in your album 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.500
 at the conclusion of thinking about decks 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.240
 I note that there is no such class 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.520
 or about the deck in the game is present 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.260
 incredible balance just shoot in the left 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.060
 number of tactics despite the fact that 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.950
 so like to say socialists play 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.080
 type 1 gig on guitar what sorts of who 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.790
 principle only for attacking 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.770
 rush and protective 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.630
 directed to live say for not 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:43.790
 professional players it is absolutely 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.459
 nothing matters and nothing 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.750
 notice and not have time being taken prisoner 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:49.790
 fascinating with their magic hail and 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.290

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.520
 land and by the way if anyone wants to draw 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.650
 or already painted your favorite 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.540
 character skill crutches 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.300
 the world was short hurry to send 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.920

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.570
 maybe your cool and live on gold 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.850
 Deck cards and your name will be 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:09.590
 immortalized in the description of the card itself 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:11.989
 now what are the creatures 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.000
 creatures offer are presented in the form of cards 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:15.890
 with three indicators like that amount 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.750
 mana required to call indicator 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:21.170
 attacks and health indicators as well 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:22.730
 inscription creature almost every one of the cards 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:24.380
 representing the individual 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:26.959
 population of the Blizzard universe 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:29.560
 Here and in other words, just being 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:31.850
 has some special property 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.730
 provocation jerk and pain Cyrillic 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:35.750
 death rales wind fury 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:38.390
 frenzy a huge number of different

 hitting debuff effects on each other 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:41.840
 since the game starts to stator she 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:43.850
 where information on the properties of creatures 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.860
 quite adequately stated I will not be superfluous 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:47.870
 repeat a few words about 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:50.269

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:52.160
 not small in the world of warcraft spell 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:54.260
 or the spell is in the form of a ritual 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.790

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:02.090
 prompting pleas pleading warning 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:03.799
 prohibition and sometimes even threats can 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:05.390
 to be an independent verbal ritual 

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:07.280
 sentence in ritual or 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:08.840
 practical action also caused by 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.720

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:15.349
 mana cost of the unit and of the last 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:17.239
 card type is a secret spell which 

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:19.340
