seems<00:01:47.189> to<00:01:47.310> take<00:01:47.430> a<00:01:47.490> little<00:01:47.610> bit<00:01:47.729> more

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
seems to take a little bit more

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.880 
seems to take a little bit more
bandwidth<00:01:48.270> that<00:01:48.420> time<00:01:48.659> so<00:01:48.990> I<00:01:49.229> might<00:01:49.649> need<00:01:49.799> to

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
bandwidth that time so I might need to

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.410 
bandwidth that time so I might need to
limit<00:01:50.009> it<00:01:50.189> a<00:01:50.250> bit<00:01:50.369> more<00:01:50.640> if<00:01:50.850> I<00:01:50.939> want<00:01:51.090> to<00:01:51.149> do<00:01:51.270> that

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
limit it a bit more if I want to do that

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.380 
limit it a bit more if I want to do that
but<00:01:52.079> you<00:01:52.560> get<00:01:52.680> the<00:01:52.740> idea<00:01:52.890> I<00:01:53.399> limited<00:01:54.119> so<00:01:54.270> that

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
but you get the idea I limited so that

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.639 
but you get the idea I limited so that
the<00:01:54.509> line<00:01:54.659> can<00:01:54.899> be<00:01:54.990> usable<00:01:55.439> but<00:01:55.530> that

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
the line can be usable but that

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.350 
the line can be usable but that
obviously<00:01:55.829> means<00:01:56.399> that<00:01:56.610> the<00:01:56.790> upload<00:01:57.090> takes

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
obviously means that the upload takes

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.700 
obviously means that the upload takes
double<00:01:58.140> as<00:01:58.259> long<00:01:58.560> seem<00:01:59.520> that<00:01:59.640> it's<00:01:59.790> half<00:02:00.360> the

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 
double as long seem that it's half the

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.609 
double as long seem that it's half the

in that time and

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.699 
in that time and
that's<00:02:14.220> risky<00:02:14.430> business<00:02:14.940> I<00:02:15.120> don't<00:02:15.690> do<00:02:15.780> that<00:02:15.959> so

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
that's risky business I don't do that so

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:18.290 
that's risky business I don't do that so
what<00:02:16.830> I<00:02:16.890> have<00:02:17.040> to<00:02:17.190> do<00:02:17.310> is<00:02:17.489> I<00:02:17.670> have<00:02:18.000> to<00:02:18.120> limit

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
what I have to do is I have to limit

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.490 
what I have to do is I have to limit
google<00:02:18.690> chrome<00:02:18.959> a<00:02:19.290> lot<00:02:20.280> so<00:02:20.760> down<00:02:20.970> to<00:02:21.150> like<00:02:21.500> 1015

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
then I just limit the specific IP that

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.170 
then I just limit the specific IP that
it's<00:02:34.590> uploading<00:02:35.069> to<00:02:35.099> and<00:02:35.430> then<00:02:35.760> I<00:02:35.849> start<00:02:36.090> the

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
it's uploading to and then I start the

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.940 
it's uploading to and then I start the
tales<00:02:36.360> alumina<00:02:36.690> upload<00:02:36.930> their<00:02:37.200> I<00:02:37.410> let<00:02:37.830> that

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
tales alumina upload their I let that

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.820 
tales alumina upload their I let that
run<00:02:38.220> at<00:02:38.430> max<00:02:38.879> speed<00:02:39.060> till<00:02:39.810> it<00:02:39.900> finishes<00:02:40.230> then<00:02:40.739> I

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
run at max speed till it finishes then I

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.280 
run at max speed till it finishes then I
limit<00:02:41.190> the<00:02:41.280> first<00:02:41.519> upload<00:02:41.910> again<00:02:42.209> and<00:02:42.480> then

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
limit the first upload again and then

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.309 
limit the first upload again and then
that<00:02:43.410> goes<00:02:43.590> on<00:02:44.060> it's<00:02:45.060> pretty<00:02:45.390> complicated<00:02:45.690> it

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 
that goes on it's pretty complicated it

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:49.490 
that goes on it's pretty complicated it
really<00:02:46.950> is<00:02:47.220> but<00:02:47.880> I<00:02:48.239> thought<00:02:48.870> I<00:02:48.900> just<00:02:49.170> explained

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
really is but I thought I just explained

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.380 
really is but I thought I just explained
the<00:02:49.620> quick<00:02:49.799> be4<00:02:49.920> those<00:02:50.250> that<00:02:50.489> perhaps<00:02:51.120> don't

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
the quick be4 those that perhaps don't

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.210 
the quick be4 those that perhaps don't
know<00:02:51.569> how<00:02:51.720> it<00:02:51.810> works<00:02:51.959> here<00:02:52.349> and<00:02:52.560> for<00:02:53.130> those

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
know how it works here and for those

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.280 
know how it works here and for those
that<00:02:53.510> don't<00:02:54.510> have<00:02:54.750> anything<00:02:54.930> like<00:02:55.049> that<00:02:55.170> in

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
that don't have anything like that in

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.839 
that don't have anything like that in
their<00:02:55.500> lives<00:02:56.000> it's<00:02:57.000> my<00:02:57.150> daily<00:02:57.480> struggle<00:02:57.840> I

00:02:58.839 --> 00:02:58.849 
their lives it's my daily struggle I

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:01.400 
their lives it's my daily struggle I
don't<00:02:59.849> like<00:02:59.879> it<00:03:00.239> I<00:03:00.420> would<00:03:00.900> much<00:03:00.930> rather<00:03:01.110> just

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
don't like it I would much rather just

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.850 
don't like it I would much rather just
have<00:03:01.709> lightning<00:03:02.099> fast<00:03:02.280> internet<00:03:02.790> and<00:03:03.860> not

have lightning fast internet and not

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.770 
have lightning fast internet and not
have<00:03:05.010> to<00:03:05.160> worry<00:03:05.190> about<00:03:05.489> any<00:03:05.760> of<00:03:05.910> it<00:03:05.970> but<00:03:06.599> what

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
have to worry about any of it but what

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.750 
have to worry about any of it but what
the<00:03:06.810> heck<00:03:07.019> ever<00:03:07.290> it's<00:03:07.950> the<00:03:08.040> best<00:03:08.280> we<00:03:08.459> can<00:03:08.579> get

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
the heck ever it's the best we can get

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.559 
the heck ever it's the best we can get
here<00:03:09.060> it<00:03:09.810> is<00:03:10.230> actually<00:03:10.700> the<00:03:11.700> best<00:03:11.940> connection

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:12.569 
here it is actually the best connection

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:15.289 
here it is actually the best connection
we<00:03:12.989> can<00:03:13.170> gets<00:03:13.379> for<00:03:13.709> Meg<00:03:13.920> there's<00:03:14.579> no<00:03:14.819> faster

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:15.299 
we can gets for Meg there's no faster

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:17.809 
we can gets for Meg there's no faster
available<00:03:15.780> that's<00:03:16.769> it<00:03:16.950> now<00:03:17.489> we<00:03:17.579> can<00:03:17.700> talk

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:17.819 
available that's it now we can talk

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:20.420 
available that's it now we can talk
about<00:03:17.880> newsmen<00:03:18.359> because<00:03:19.230> I<00:03:19.590> want<00:03:20.130> to<00:03:20.190> change

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
about newsmen because I want to change

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.720 
about newsmen because I want to change
the<00:03:20.790> way<00:03:20.910> I'm<00:03:21.060> doing<00:03:21.180> newsmen<00:03:22.519> maybe<00:03:23.519> within

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
the way I'm doing newsmen maybe within

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.520 
the way I'm doing newsmen maybe within
the<00:03:23.880> next<00:03:24.000> week<00:03:24.150> or<00:03:24.359> so<00:03:24.420> and<00:03:24.840> I<00:03:25.230> think<00:03:25.410> it's

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
the next week or so and I think it's

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.080 
the next week or so and I think it's
going<00:03:25.620> to<00:03:25.680> be<00:03:25.799> for<00:03:26.010> the<00:03:26.040> better<00:03:26.250> so<00:03:26.549> my<00:03:26.760> plan<00:03:27.060> is

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
going to be for the better so my plan is
