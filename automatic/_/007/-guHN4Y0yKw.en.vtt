00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.350
 but everyone knows we Royan line 

00:00:01.739 --> 00:00:07.280
 found for a new episode for 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.390
 introduce you to a system that I did 

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:11.820
 so 1 probably has similarities 

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:16.109
 I do not know I have not watched 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:19.620
 basically it's a test a station of 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:21.630
 storage for the same hopper cards 

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:24.120
 so basically you just have to have 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.320
 a system and you put that or in a 

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:27.150
 a piece of 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:34.410
 for example everything from a loop of my 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:37.220
 map here I just put the systems 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.220
 of time 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.380
 up here chicks and you 're going in 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:47.010
 big it stops 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:51.739
 it drops all and as soon as it is finished 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:56.730
 all empty and he goes away and so on 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:59.190
 until until that they 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.650
 take it so here we go we can 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.390
 serving such key Amable towers 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:05.309
 all the tricks to recover wolves 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.930
 anything in fact 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.000
 the application you want so that 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.280
 that's what you need minimum 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.899
 needs of 1,1 are afraid that's it I have 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.810
 put two minutes normally you have 

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:18.180
 you put that a minimum threshold of 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.970
 repeater a comparator said red stone 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.890
 a torch and they inevitably you a raid 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:28.170
 and hector than a power &amp; dre with 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:29.130
 normal derailleur between the two so 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.280
 I will go directly to 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.040
 construction so first you start 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.540
 by 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:41.150
 perfect your man way carter 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:44.080
 before building it here you are 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.080
 butcher tip 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:51.090
 for it to be hours here is the trick 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.580
 to say that that extends there 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.920
 so we put our rails detector a 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:58.590
 normal rail between the two for not 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.990
 that they leave in bulk and then in 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:05.030
 below the rail detector you put 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.030
 blocks like that 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:12.750
 we finished the rails no we will take the 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:18.300
 rest so you take your stone 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:20.550
 if first started by asking our 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:24.710
 chest 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.710
 it's okay here 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:33.870
 and therefore sends it directly from 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:36.320
 hopper to the chest the army the news 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:39.680
 work that will return the 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.680
 same card 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.470
 I'm sorry it's just that 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:50.750
 boring of having to smic and at the same time 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:58.849
 stolen so there too in the morning a block here 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:03:03.040
 a block there and so you'll put your 

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:03.040
 interest in this place 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:10.000
 here at 1 tick 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:13.500
 and a limiter not in pitas 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.500
 tic paritarism 

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:25.400
 early our work detector to the system 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.400
 with 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:36.620
 with a repeater for easter the current 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:38.329
 continued rest of 6.6 actually I had 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.879
 put a son here would always be on 

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:44.480
 since the system there with the 

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:48.049
 wrongly comparator is blocked so here 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:49.689
 you just have to put 2 lara stone and 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:55.549
 so you have your system 

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:59.569
 is more than enough to hurt cards 

00:03:55.549 --> 00:04:01.840
 which you take your trouble because i and 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:05.390
 blocks 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:08.390
 and so you put your leads 4 to this 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:13.159
 place you fill block turn a 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:19.609
 lever for various essonne and so the 

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:22.039
 note mike hart stop no ideas and 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:25.430
 so when he will have fast and all he 

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:27.280
 inside low it will start again so we 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:31.970
 will help him avoid 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:33.830
 here and so who will be emptied 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:36.770
 by you here are tanks wholesale ago 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:38.030
 just a wait time here his chips 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:42.560
 left text that is something 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:45.289
 dark so I hope this 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:47.750
 presentation of this theme to the arts more 

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:51.080
 top put a gem if you have good 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:51.530
 liked to comment to say what you in 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.600
 think 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:54.800
 in this other thing for example do 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:57.949
 other systems that could you 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:59.360
 to be useful you or other people tell me that 

00:04:57.949 --> 00:05:01.160
 in the comments and come at 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:02.570
 did not 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.160
 all possible applications of 

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:07.669
 system for example turn to death for 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:12.440
 avoid putting that opr you put 

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:14.840
 your do you a made a way with 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:17.000
 cards and stack with rails and 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:21.440
 you only have one opera and worse 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:25.849
 good for example the spider farms or 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:27.889
 other like that where all the girls of 

00:05:25.849 --> 00:05:28.870
 spider falls to the ground you put that that 

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:35.810
 will get it back 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:36.740
 or otherwise just for why by 

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:38.780
 example you are in mines 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:41.599
 you have a manikin system for 

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:45.169
 make lifts said m you put 

00:05:41.599 --> 00:05:46.760
 your items that you have recovered in 

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:49.350
 your match because he will drop them in 

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:53.010
 a chest that will be on their way home 

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:56.720
 so we'll stop if for this episode and 

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:56.720
 we'll see you next time
