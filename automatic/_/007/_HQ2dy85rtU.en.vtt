this<00:00:54.629> blaster<00:00:55.199> is<00:00:55.530> very<00:00:56.010> similar<00:00:56.399> to<00:00:56.789> a<00:00:57.239> Raider

00:00:58.119 --> 00:00:58.129

the<00:00:59.300> main<00:01:00.300> difference<00:01:00.329> excuse<00:01:01.230> me<00:01:01.410> biggest

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
the main difference excuse me biggest

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.889 
the main difference excuse me biggest
difference<00:01:02.250> is<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.940> size<00:01:02.969> of<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.629> drum

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
difference is the size of the drum

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.340 
difference is the size of the drum
magazine<00:01:04.439> on<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:05.519> rampage<00:01:06.000> it's<00:01:06.360> a<00:01:06.479> 25<00:01:06.990> shot

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
magazine on the rampage it's a 25 shot

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.940 
magazine on the rampage it's a 25 shot
drum<00:01:07.740> instead<00:01:08.310> of<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:08.670> 35<00:01:09.210> shot<00:01:09.689> that<00:01:10.470> is<00:01:10.770> on

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
drum instead of the 35 shot that is on

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.030 
drum instead of the 35 shot that is on
the<00:01:11.100> Raider<00:01:11.310> and<00:01:11.580> also<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.810> rampage<00:01:13.350> as<00:01:13.680> it

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
the Raider and also the rampage as it

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.859 
the Raider and also the rampage as it
comes<00:01:14.540> does<00:01:15.540> not<00:01:15.750> come<00:01:16.110> with<00:01:16.560> a<00:01:16.770> buttstock

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869 
comes does not come with a buttstock

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:20.570 
comes does not come with a buttstock
whereas<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:19.110> Raider<00:01:19.290> obviously<00:01:20.100> comes<00:01:20.369> with

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
whereas the Raider obviously comes with

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.899 
whereas the Raider obviously comes with
the<00:01:20.670> telescoping<00:01:21.450> buttstock<00:01:22.430> so<00:01:23.430> this<00:01:23.880> is

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
the telescoping buttstock so this is

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.499 
the telescoping buttstock so this is
more<00:01:24.450> of<00:01:24.560> you<00:01:25.560> know<00:01:25.650> shorter<00:01:26.310> like<00:01:26.970> carbine

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
more of you know shorter like carbine

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.810 
more of you know shorter like carbine
version<00:01:27.990> with<00:01:28.110> a<00:01:28.170> smaller<00:01:28.560> drum<00:01:29.009> it's<00:01:29.729> a

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
version with a smaller drum it's a

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.060 
version with a smaller drum it's a
little<00:01:30.060> lighter<00:01:30.299> a<00:01:30.630> little<00:01:30.689> more

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
little lighter a little more

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.030 
little lighter a little more
maneuverable<00:01:32.070> um<00:01:32.689> right<00:01:33.689> off<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:33.869> bat<00:01:34.229> I'll

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
maneuverable um right off the bat I'll

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.039 
maneuverable um right off the bat I'll
say<00:01:35.250> that<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.820> thing<00:01:36.030> Prime's<00:01:36.450> really

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
say that the thing Prime's really

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.490 
say that the thing Prime's really
smoothly<00:01:37.500> I<00:01:38.299> haven't<00:01:39.299> already<00:01:39.570> loaded<00:01:40.140> up<00:01:40.259> um

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
smoothly I haven't already loaded up um

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.120 
smoothly I haven't already loaded up um
so<00:01:41.250> I'll<00:01:42.060> go<00:01:42.270> ahead<00:01:42.299> and<00:01:42.570> just<00:01:43.560> fire<00:01:43.770> off<00:01:43.799> a<00:01:43.979> few

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
so I'll go ahead and just fire off a few

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.130 
so I'll go ahead and just fire off a few
shots<00:01:44.399> even<00:01:44.939> though<00:01:45.149> I'm<00:01:45.299> inside<00:01:45.659> right<00:01:46.110> now

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
shots even though I'm inside right now

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.620 
shots even though I'm inside right now
obviously<00:01:46.860> because<00:01:47.130> it's<00:01:47.340> at<00:01:47.490> night<00:01:47.729> I<00:01:48.030> will

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
obviously because it's at night I will

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.109 
obviously because it's at night I will
do<00:01:48.869> measured<00:01:49.290> ranges<00:01:49.909> hopefully<00:01:50.909> this

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
do measured ranges hopefully this

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.270 
do measured ranges hopefully this
weekend<00:01:51.600> they're<00:01:52.290> going<00:01:52.380> to<00:01:52.439> be<00:01:52.680> extremely

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
weekend they're going to be extremely

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.789 
weekend they're going to be extremely
similar<00:01:53.970> to<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.780> range<00:01:55.020> test<00:01:55.380> that<00:01:55.590> I<00:01:55.619> get

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
similar to the range test that I get

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:00.200 
similar to the range test that I get
outside<00:01:56.280> for<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:56.880> retaliate<00:01:58.369> so<00:01:59.369> I'm<00:01:59.700> pretty

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
outside for the retaliate so I'm pretty

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.240 
outside for the retaliate so I'm pretty
sure<00:02:00.390> they'll<00:02:00.600> be<00:02:00.630> almost<00:02:00.869> identical<00:02:01.250> but

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
sure they'll be almost identical but

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.280 
sure they'll be almost identical but
like<00:02:02.700> I<00:02:02.850> said<00:02:02.909> functionally<00:02:03.780> this<00:02:04.740> blaster

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290 
like I said functionally this blaster

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:11.029 
like I said functionally this blaster
primes<00:02:07.290> and<00:02:07.740> fires<00:02:08.340> just<00:02:09.270> like<00:02:09.629> a<00:02:09.660> raider<00:02:10.050> of

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
primes and fires just like a raider of

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.680 
primes and fires just like a raider of
course<00:02:11.370> with<00:02:11.640> newer

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
course with newer

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.070 
course with newer
more<00:02:12.840> powerful<00:02:13.230> internals<00:02:14.780> the<00:02:15.780> slam

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
more powerful internals the slam

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.220 
more powerful internals the slam
firefish<00:02:16.740> feature<00:02:17.340> is<00:02:17.790> intact<00:02:18.720> on<00:02:19.020> this

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
firefish feature is intact on this

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.260 
firefish feature is intact on this
blaster<00:02:19.680> so<00:02:19.860> it's<00:02:19.980> lamb<00:02:20.250> fires<00:02:20.580> just<00:02:21.060> like<00:02:21.240> a

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
blaster so it's lamb fires just like a

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.560 
blaster so it's lamb fires just like a
Raider<00:02:21.600> the<00:02:22.530> biggest<00:02:22.980> difference<00:02:23.570> obviously

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
Raider the biggest difference obviously

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.280 
Raider the biggest difference obviously
is<00:02:25.050> performance<00:02:25.800> um<00:02:26.070> this<00:02:26.670> thing<00:02:26.940> hits

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
is performance um this thing hits

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.430 
is performance um this thing hits
noticeably<00:02:28.290> harder<00:02:28.740> than<00:02:29.190> a<00:02:29.220> Raider<00:02:30.440> fired
