00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.660
 not included in the biography of Iran and 

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:09.900
 worrying about having this project connect 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:12.630
 is I put wood that was you extra 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:16.910
 Everyone knows, but it's enough. 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:20.490
 Curious about him, I would like him to 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:23.939
 he is a guy here it rained a lot 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.800
 thing about vegetable garden selecting the mustache 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.560
 Hitler here 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:35.040
 He is a piece of navy hair. 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:37.559
 anna lucia from the plot is also 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.140
 moisturize dinho congratulations then she will have 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:46.230
 a good taste I think the garnier fructis 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:47.129
 It's not a smelly spell that she 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.920
 had in the area 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.789
 I thought it was Tina liked this 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.710
 scenario 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:57.510
 I will take a complete tour of certainty 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.430
 that you will see all the details of it 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.430
 We are having the meeting room of the 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:07.100
 door we built three carpets 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:10.350
 here the first one we did 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:15.710
 instant are three bookshelves this 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:22.080
 trick that I quite like my books 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:25.619
 today of the vagner hitler admired much 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:28.610
 wagner beethoven because b also German 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:32.790
 So I decided to put it here too. 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:35.700
 Nazi party flag that will have to 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:39.930
 to be destroyed after Austrian chairs 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.740
 this genuine 18th century Aztec chair if 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.240
 I'm not mistaken 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.369
 I think the most expensive thing I've ever 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.340
 put on the stage beyond it I think the 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:50.280
 people did but it's a facility for 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:53.220
 You can actually learn this second 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:58.530
 chair that we made in order to 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:02:00.479
 My logic is, I took a picture of 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:04.009
 now I've sent an artist to paint a 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.009
 picture of him as hitler 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:12.030
 on the wall because hitler would be the kind of 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:14.340
 face that would have a portrait of himself in the 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:17.310
 wall and this third of the patron 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:20.910
 window that opens to the door if the 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:24.450
 people wanted to use primary curtains 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:27.480
 of velvet and a mirror of water in several 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:31.080
 areas in the entire district and later 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:34.410
 Joan of Arc, because the nickname is not 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:37.769
 not he did the one she uses with 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:44.130
 bat that antÃ´nia is the mistress of kindle 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:48.060

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:20.519
 talk about it and not 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:23.610
 receiving merit was nathan 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:41.690
 only then will the search was great disk 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:44.750
 to make short films 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:47.690
 but the short film shot on film 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:50.240
 said to do to me, I did not do anything 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:51.350
 It 's better for me than the smell of 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:53.630
 movie 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:54.650
 so this is what is my fetish and 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:56.480
 mosque 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:59.060
 I make movies because of the smell of 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:02.690
 film he could eat ask with 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:05.480

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:07.400

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:10.160

 to aap 

00:04:35.489 --> 00:04:42.189

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:45.159
 cook good liked it is well written 

00:04:42.189 --> 00:04:47.079
 fluent reading nice nice what good 

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:48.879
 Did you really like it then? 

00:04:47.079 --> 00:04:52.269
 the page has a little something else or another 

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:55.989
 that I had was that this thing of the Jew 

00:04:52.269 --> 00:04:57.369

00:04:55.989 --> 00:05:00.039
 I was reading and everything is suddenly 

00:04:57.369 --> 00:05:03.609
 It seems that I am the person ps May I 

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:06.959

00:05:03.609 --> 00:05:10.889
 outstanding in his government

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:16.689
 Turns-Where the book gets better
