00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:10.480 

going<00:00:06.690> for<00:00:06.990> the<00:00:07.080> 720<00:00:07.620> is<00:00:08.160> something<00:00:09.059> that<00:00:09.389> I

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:10.490 
going for the 720 is something that I

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:13.280 
going for the 720 is something that I
kind<00:00:11.490> of<00:00:11.550> thrive<00:00:11.790> on<00:00:12.059> having<00:00:12.750> the<00:00:12.840> conditions

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
kind of thrive on having the conditions

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.340 
kind of thrive on having the conditions
match<00:00:13.530> up<00:00:13.830> and<00:00:14.150> being<00:00:15.150> in<00:00:15.240> the<00:00:15.330> moment<00:00:15.509> and<00:00:15.839> and

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
match up and being in the moment and and

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.340 
match up and being in the moment and and
making<00:00:17.010> it<00:00:17.130> is<00:00:17.279> is<00:00:18.119> another<00:00:18.390> thing<00:00:18.720> I<00:00:18.990> feel

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
making it is is another thing I feel

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.230 
making it is is another thing I feel
like<00:00:19.560> here<00:00:19.890> if<00:00:20.430> the<00:00:20.640> conditions<00:00:21.060> come

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
like here if the conditions come

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.150 
like here if the conditions come
together<00:00:21.390> I<00:00:21.810> think<00:00:22.080> it's<00:00:22.650> more<00:00:23.010> than

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
together I think it's more than

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:44.340 
together I think it's more than
achievable

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:44.350 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.799 

you<00:00:45.280> kind<00:00:45.789> of<00:00:45.879> don't<00:00:46.030> want<00:00:46.149> too<00:00:46.359> much<00:00:46.510> wind

00:00:46.799 --> 00:00:46.809 
you kind of don't want too much wind

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:48.000 
you kind of don't want too much wind
once<00:00:47.050> you<00:00:47.140> get<00:00:47.289> in<00:00:47.379> the<00:00:47.440> air<00:00:47.590> and<00:00:47.710> you<00:00:47.769> start

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.010 
once you get in the air and you start

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.029 
once you get in the air and you start
rotating<00:00:48.579> because<00:00:49.260> things<00:00:50.260> get<00:00:50.500> kind<00:00:50.890> of<00:00:50.949> out

00:00:51.029 --> 00:00:51.039 
rotating because things get kind of out

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:52.889 
rotating because things get kind of out
of<00:00:51.100> control<00:00:51.190> so<00:00:52.089> like<00:00:52.360> you<00:00:52.480> can<00:00:52.629> get<00:00:52.750> that

00:00:52.889 --> 00:00:52.899 
of control so like you can get that

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:55.680 
of control so like you can get that
first<00:00:53.170> rotation<00:00:53.680> like<00:00:54.070> no<00:00:55.030> worries<00:00:55.390> you<00:00:55.420> just

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:55.690 
first rotation like no worries you just

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:57.389 
first rotation like no worries you just
kind<00:00:55.870> of<00:00:55.899> ride<00:00:56.140> the<00:00:56.170> wind<00:00:56.500> around<00:00:56.859> but<00:00:57.190> if<00:00:57.309> you

00:00:57.389 --> 00:00:57.399 
kind of ride the wind around but if you

00:00:57.399 --> 00:00:59.639 
kind of ride the wind around but if you
try<00:00:57.640> and<00:00:57.760> force<00:00:58.000> around<00:00:58.359> anything<00:00:59.199> more<00:00:59.500> than

00:00:59.639 --> 00:00:59.649 
try and force around anything more than

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:02.100 
try and force around anything more than
that<00:00:59.800> the<00:01:00.250> kind<00:01:01.239> of<00:01:01.329> gets<00:01:01.449> out<00:01:01.570> of<00:01:01.629> control<00:01:01.750> and

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:02.110 
that the kind of gets out of control and

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:03.479 
that the kind of gets out of control and
the<00:01:02.229> wind<00:01:02.469> will<00:01:02.620> just<00:01:02.799> grab<00:01:02.949> your<00:01:03.159> board<00:01:03.309> and

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:03.489 
the wind will just grab your board and

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:05.039 
the wind will just grab your board and
it's<00:01:03.579> gone<00:01:03.789> I<00:01:04.059> think<00:01:04.570> if<00:01:04.690> we<00:01:04.780> get<00:01:04.930> the

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:05.049 
it's gone I think if we get the

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:07.200 
it's gone I think if we get the
conditions<00:01:05.440> clean<00:01:05.770> be<00:01:06.250> able<00:01:06.399> to<00:01:06.460> come<00:01:06.640> so<00:01:06.670> fast

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.210 
conditions clean be able to come so fast

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:09.420 
conditions clean be able to come so fast
into<00:01:07.630> that<00:01:07.810> into<00:01:08.320> that<00:01:08.350> second<00:01:08.950> of<00:01:09.100> that<00:01:09.159> Boley

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:09.430 
into that into that second of that Boley

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.359 
into that into that second of that Boley
part<00:01:09.759> of<00:01:09.850> the<00:01:09.909> wave<00:01:10.060> and<00:01:10.330> then<00:01:10.950> really<00:01:11.950> go<00:01:12.100> for

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:12.369 
part of the wave and then really go for

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:59.859 
part of the wave and then really go for
it

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:02.050 

it's<00:02:00.350> the<00:02:00.500> same<00:02:00.740> as<00:02:00.920> competing<00:02:01.310> its<00:02:01.640> having

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
it's the same as competing its having

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:03.310 
it's the same as competing its having
that<00:02:02.240> mountain<00:02:02.659> you've<00:02:02.869> got<00:02:02.990> to<00:02:03.079> kind<00:02:03.200> of

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
that mountain you've got to kind of

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.249 
that mountain you've got to kind of
climb<00:02:03.560> it<00:02:03.799> and<00:02:03.950> and<00:02:04.310> conquer<00:02:05.299> it<00:02:05.420> I<00:02:05.600> know<00:02:05.960> I<00:02:05.990> can

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:06.259 
climb it and and conquer it I know I can

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:08.800 
climb it and and conquer it I know I can
do<00:02:06.439> it<00:02:06.470> but<00:02:06.860> executing<00:02:07.790> it<00:02:07.909> I<00:02:08.149> feel<00:02:08.479> like<00:02:08.630> it'll

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
do it but executing it I feel like it'll

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:10.089 
do it but executing it I feel like it'll
be<00:02:08.899> that<00:02:09.020> same<00:02:09.259> feeling<00:02:09.530> you<00:02:09.709> get<00:02:09.890> from

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:10.099 
be that same feeling you get from

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:12.520 
be that same feeling you get from
competing<00:02:10.489> when<00:02:10.759> you<00:02:10.880> really<00:02:11.150> kind<00:02:12.140> of<00:02:12.200> smash

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
competing when you really kind of smash

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.260 
competing when you really kind of smash
someone<00:02:12.800> you<00:02:12.980> want<00:02:13.130> to<00:02:13.190> smash<00:02:13.430> it<00:02:13.459> I<00:02:13.730> hate<00:02:13.940> it's

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270 
someone you want to smash it I hate it's

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:17.559 
someone you want to smash it I hate it's
uh<00:02:15.220> it's<00:02:16.220> just<00:02:16.430> yeah<00:02:16.730> there's<00:02:17.030> there's<00:02:17.420> a
