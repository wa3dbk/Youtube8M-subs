00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.559
 one of the debts of road tourism 

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:11.680
 current is to generate more possibilities of 

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:14.230
 surpassed some outstanding technicians of 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:16.960
 the category they think about what they would do 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:19.660
 so that this is possible in the future 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:23.310
 so that the cars his person is not a 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:26.050
 single thing of some sum 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.440
 even over time they have gone it 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.440
 they have been changing 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.650
 and they play against the show 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:38.219
 For example, I can list the 

00:00:34.859 --> 00:00:40.949
 tire is one of them would have to 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.870
 have a tire that is fast in 

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:45.300
 classification and to wear long 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:49.100
 of the career then who administers 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.100
 better the tire 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:55.050
 will change the performance of the 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:58.570
 career and this would have overrun 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.219
 aerodynamically the cars have to 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.949
 be so dependent on dynamic but 

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:06.130
 it also has to be survive before 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:08.560
 so that when the car goes back 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:12.370
 of another in the curves is neutralized and 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.840
 later 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:16.780
 the power curve of the engines 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.760
 They should have much more outstanding 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.040
 then when some pilot commits a 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:22.560
 error 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.630
 it leaves the engine power loses 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.880
 a lot of power and the one behind also 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.829
 has the possibility of overcoming it 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:33.680
 use tubes with greater resistance 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.680
 to advance so that more option is generated 

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:42.320
 are a series of things that throughout 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.320
 of time in search of parity 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.740
 evolve with the category playing very 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:49.120
 against in the show I think that 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.010
 the fastest thing would be to make a tire 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:53.440
 to degrade the tires that are 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:56.230
 degrade automatically is engineering 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.400
 much better skills besides we 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:59.440
 they forget and so we do not see it 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.660
 permanently on the optional terrain 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:04.990
 a system for the engine to have a 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:06.880
 plus and the pilot may have five or 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.369
 six possibilities during the race and 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:12.580
 national power 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.959
 and to be able to pass when he decides 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.700
 it seems interesting everything that is 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:19.239
 doing in the world the fact of 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:22.120
 deliver a certain power time 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:23.620
 to those interesting partners the same as 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.269
 be on the side of power by the 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.879
 all of the dynamics it seems to me that those 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:29.409
 are alternative alternatives for me in 

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:31.720
 general and at the level of what the 

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:34.239
 I find the world interesting, which does not 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.519
 it's easy to do it and fast here maybe 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:37.959
 is there any possibility with the option of 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:40.150
 these new engines can reach the 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:43.060
 future have any chance I 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.980
 it seems that resort to the grid system 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.500
 inverted and not apply to pilots the 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.299
 three three per cold one well 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.549
 more so than the pilot who is 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:52.840
 competitive you can even if it has grid 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:54.909
 inverted that has a vehicle that is 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.980
 always at the best technical level good what 

00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:58.659
 load of weight or anything then that 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:03.130
 it seems immediately interesting 

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:06.980
 I do not see an easy solution to that 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:09.380
 I can not think what he lived 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:12.950
 a little time in a career that 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:15.610
 they invited to play Brazilian she has 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:15.610
 a method that 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:21.500
 that is called your peace that is a button that 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:23.709
 enables an extra power for about 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.709
 seconds 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:31.580
 and it allows the one who goes back to power 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:35.060
 to overcome him obviously obviously always 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:36.950
 in front does not press it in any 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:39.830
 moment the only race that was done 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:42.049
 with less load they exceeded a 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:46.020
 little bit more this when we take out the 

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:48.030
 spoiler but it was also 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:50.790
 It was uneven because some people found 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:52.230
 the road faster than others and out there 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.630
 if we let several races pass 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.830
 come back 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:59.840
 to put all the same seriously in order to 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:03.980
 have a maximum engine speed for 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:05.960
 use it for 10 times or 5 times something 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:08.420
 different to grant a 

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:10.130
 by hand we have it at hand 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:12.950
 because the engines give to turn more 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:14.980
 regime of the electronics controls it 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:18.900
 category 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:18.900
 It would be an easy thing to try
