00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:35.969
 There 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:38.790
 I think that the possibility of being politely done is probably quite high, but somehow I try 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:44.570
 I do it by saying that I want to 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.570

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.330

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:38.479
 Let me get next 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:41.710
 After that we already will continue across the plain 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:41.710
 About 10 minutes have passed 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:50.360
 Yes, the second generation even if the story is Taiyaku 3-to-3 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:52.650
 This guy is quite strong though 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:57.390
 I'm doing it again 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:02:00.300
 Repeated recovery and attacks 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:03.830
 It's a clan and it's pretty strong 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.830
 So recover again 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:10.729
 Well it is steady, really 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:10.729

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:20.430
 Let what this fellow also Iei 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.430
 A little more 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:30.670
 That the shy position 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:34.660
 It's the 4th floor 3rd floor clear 4th time so far I thought I was honest enough 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:38.660
 The problem is the cat's next time 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:43.210
 Somehow go unless we work hard more when we hit the next time 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:43.210
 Yes Well the time being I would like to a guy of 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.100

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:57.090
 I had forgot to take say a black guy now, but we are fighting with the dragon 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:03:00.930
 Honestly, this is the way of protection 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:03.060
 This time I used to use the skills of all the guys. 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:07.630
 That's why 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:12.600
 It may be swiftly defeated by the next attack 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:16.200
 But If I was like I can withstand the attack 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:21.020
 That I still can compete 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:21.020
 From this turn longevity , this turn i 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.470

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:49.610

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:49.610
 This is the first time 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:55.800
 It is most important that you can not pay 5000 yen 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:58.370
 Died 

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:05.620

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:19.280
 That the Yes 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:23.079
 I'd went carried out at the fact that attempts to challenge the Heraisu today 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:23.079
 I did not go to the mountain 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:30.720
 It is useless as unless we strengthen the still steadily year a little more level-up 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:34.940
 Also the fact that yes 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:38.590

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:43.660
