00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.370
 Hey, guys, it's good, we're going today. 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:08.099
 demonstrate how we use the 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.860
 motion tablets to read 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:13.320
 qr code 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.190
 besides the tablets of the tutorial girl also 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:20.820
 It's for you to use, it's just pinging 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:23.670
 To read the code qr, too. 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.609
 so it's very simple 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:29.789
 the solution here I have a software 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:33.960
 called cmac software exists to 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:36.239
 android smartphones and there mr 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:41.129
 but they also developed a version 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:44.340
 for windows pc then on mocha tablet 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.930
 I 'm running windows 7 aquino 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:50.160
 900 series 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:53.370
 It is very simple the solution here is the 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:56.789
 The program interface is down here. 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:01:00.750
 has some last buttons on the right of 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:03.390
 where you select which 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.589
 camera in case I have here the front and 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.320
 at the rear 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.590
 you can also select it from the 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:13.200
 enter when reading the code 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.430
 Automatically, it 's really neat and simple. 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.200
 to use 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:20.509
 I will demonstrate that reading then 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.509
 starting with this first code here 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:24.750
 the noise means reading with 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.799
 success 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:30.960
 the contained url that is the site of unitec e 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.439
 looks nice and functional others 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:37.979
 slightly smaller sizes 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:40.520
 also read quiet and a little child 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.520
 still 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:53.740
 there you can read a speed 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:55.990
 quite fast or so 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.400
 equivalent to the use of a 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.920
 cell phone 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.990
 I hope you have enjoyed it 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.970
 useful for your application. 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:07.000
 need to read the qr code 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:08.920
 now the link to the 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.950
 download is in our post 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:14.440
 if there is resolution compatibility 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:17.860
 on the screen that I explained is also 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:20.290
 write click to modify the 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:23.950
 resolution as is also explained 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:25.630
 that the software will work normal well 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.870
 Cool it is good 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:31.600
 visit our website the tech brasil.com.br 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:35.670
 and keep watching our videos 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.670
