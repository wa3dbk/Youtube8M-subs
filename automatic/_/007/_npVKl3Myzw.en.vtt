00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
I haven't stuck it down quite so much so

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.840 
I haven't stuck it down quite so much so
it's<00:00:35.790> slipping<00:00:36.450> around<00:00:36.540> which<00:00:37.140> is<00:00:37.670> one<00:00:38.670> of<00:00:38.700> the

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
it's slipping around which is one of the

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.000 
it's slipping around which is one of the
major<00:00:39.030> problems<00:00:39.510> with<00:00:39.750> these<00:00:40.140> pads<00:00:40.440> and<00:00:40.710> have

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
major problems with these pads and have

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.619 
major problems with these pads and have
just<00:00:41.160> died<00:00:41.280> there<00:00:42.530> what<00:00:43.530> does<00:00:44.270> no<00:00:45.270> I<00:00:45.300> don't

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
just died there what does no I don't

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.979 
just died there what does no I don't
want<00:00:45.780> to<00:00:45.840> do<00:00:45.899> that<00:00:46.940> so<00:00:47.940> they<00:00:48.390> feel<00:00:48.570> quite<00:00:48.719> good

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
want to do that so they feel quite good

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.889 
want to do that so they feel quite good
they<00:00:49.710> work<00:00:50.129> you<00:00:50.700> know<00:00:50.789> at<00:00:51.239> least<00:00:51.449> on<00:00:51.570> this<00:00:51.660> game

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
they work you know at least on this game

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.750 
they work you know at least on this game
but<00:00:52.469> then<00:00:52.710> it's<00:00:52.890> probably<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.190> best<00:00:53.430> game

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
but then it's probably the best game

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.240 
but then it's probably the best game
that<00:00:54.090> I've<00:00:54.840> got<00:00:55.020> to<00:00:55.110> work<00:00:55.260> with<00:00:55.440> them<00:00:55.620> we'll

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
that I've got to work with them we'll

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.099 
that I've got to work with them we'll
look<00:00:56.370> at<00:00:56.520> pew<00:00:56.910> pew<00:00:57.149> which<00:00:57.719> I<00:00:57.840> thought<00:00:58.020> was

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
look at pew pew which I thought was

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.410 
look at pew pew which I thought was
going<00:00:58.199> to<00:00:58.260> be<00:00:58.320> excellent<00:00:58.890> with<00:00:59.010> these<00:00:59.190> my<00:01:00.149> ship

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
going to be excellent with these my ship

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.250 
going to be excellent with these my ship
does<00:01:00.780> not<00:01:00.809> want<00:01:01.199> to<00:01:01.379> move<00:01:01.530> fast<00:01:01.949> enough

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
does not want to move fast enough

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.020 
does not want to move fast enough
because<00:01:04.260> there's<00:01:04.530> not<00:01:04.860> enough<00:01:05.309> play<00:01:05.729> in<00:01:05.880> them

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
because there's not enough play in them

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.910 
because there's not enough play in them
or<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.390> sticks<00:01:06.630> aren't<00:01:06.930> too<00:01:07.110> small<00:01:07.500> for<00:01:07.799> the

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
or the sticks aren't too small for the

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.340 
or the sticks aren't too small for the
be<00:01:08.070> enough<00:01:08.250> player<00:01:08.549> so<00:01:09.299> it's<00:01:10.080> pretty<00:01:10.229> much

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
be enough player so it's pretty much

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.080 
be enough player so it's pretty much
useless<00:01:10.650> with<00:01:10.920> this<00:01:10.950> I<00:01:11.310> think<00:01:11.670> I<00:01:11.880> may<00:01:12.060> be

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
useless with this I think I may be

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.370 
useless with this I think I may be
writing<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.540> developer<00:01:12.960> see<00:01:13.110> if<00:01:13.170> you<00:01:13.260> can

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
writing the developer see if you can

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.960 
writing the developer see if you can
make<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.590> sticks<00:01:13.770> a<00:01:13.830> bit<00:01:13.950> smaller<00:01:14.280> so<00:01:14.549> I<00:01:14.820> can

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
make the sticks a bit smaller so I can

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.810 
make the sticks a bit smaller so I can
play<00:01:15.150> with<00:01:15.180> these<00:01:15.619> but<00:01:16.619> still<00:01:16.860> not<00:01:17.460> sure<00:01:17.670> if<00:01:17.729> it

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
play with these but still not sure if it

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.870 
play with these but still not sure if it
would<00:01:17.880> be<00:01:18.000> any<00:01:18.119> good<00:01:19.340> another<00:01:20.340> game<00:01:20.610> that<00:01:20.640> it

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
would be any good another game that it

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.310 
would be any good another game that it

with age of zombies there it's not going
to<00:01:46.710> work<00:01:46.860> so<00:01:48.320> some<00:01:49.320> shadow<00:01:49.770> gun<00:01:50.040> only<00:01:50.729> requires

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
to work so some shadow gun only requires

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
our found are going to work very well

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.520 
our found are going to work very well
shadow<00:02:03.630> gun<00:02:03.780> I<00:02:03.840> thought<00:02:03.990> would<00:02:04.079> be<00:02:04.140> alright

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
shadow gun I thought would be alright

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.910 
shadow gun I thought would be alright
with<00:02:04.710> them<00:02:04.860> but<00:02:05.159> for<00:02:06.030> some<00:02:06.090> reason<00:02:06.860> it<00:02:07.860> just

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
with them but for some reason it just

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.390 
with them but for some reason it just
does<00:02:08.399> not<00:02:08.580> want<00:02:08.849> to<00:02:09.410> keep<00:02:10.410> track<00:02:10.739> of<00:02:10.800> my<00:02:11.069> finger

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
does not want to keep track of my finger

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.300 
does not want to keep track of my finger
on<00:02:11.520> that<00:02:11.610> it<00:02:12.060> keeps<00:02:12.470> losing<00:02:13.470> track<00:02:13.860> and

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
on that it keeps losing track and

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.059 
on that it keeps losing track and
even<00:02:14.730> when<00:02:14.819> I<00:02:14.849> do<00:02:14.940> get<00:02:15.090> it<00:02:15.209> to<00:02:15.300> work<00:02:15.480> again<00:02:16.170> the

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
even when I do get it to work again the

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:18.589 
even when I do get it to work again the
actual<00:02:17.400> stick<00:02:17.670> doesn't<00:02:18.060> have<00:02:18.360> enough

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:18.599 
actual stick doesn't have enough

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:21.260 
actual stick doesn't have enough
movement<00:02:18.840> in<00:02:19.080> it<00:02:19.340> for<00:02:20.340> me<00:02:20.459> to<00:02:20.580> move<00:02:20.760> fast

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
movement in it for me to move fast

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.860 
movement in it for me to move fast
enough

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
enough

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:27.680 
enough
so<00:02:22.800> all<00:02:23.550> in<00:02:23.819> all<00:02:24.620> they<00:02:25.620> work<00:02:26.069> as<00:02:26.280> intended<00:02:26.849> the

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
so all in all they work as intended the

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.089 
so all in all they work as intended the
problem<00:02:28.110> with<00:02:28.260> it<00:02:28.290> is<00:02:28.440> that<00:02:28.500> there's<00:02:28.950> not

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:29.099 
problem with it is that there's not

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:30.890 
problem with it is that there's not
really<00:02:29.280> a<00:02:29.400> software<00:02:29.880> there<00:02:30.060> to<00:02:30.180> support<00:02:30.569> it

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
really a software there to support it

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.080 
really a software there to support it
so<00:02:31.440> I<00:02:31.500> couldn't<00:02:31.920> really<00:02:32.069> recommend<00:02:32.670> buying

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
so I couldn't really recommend buying

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.449 
so I couldn't really recommend buying
two<00:02:33.569> of<00:02:33.720> them<00:02:33.870> and<00:02:34.500> they<00:02:34.620> cost<00:02:34.800> me<00:02:34.950> I<00:02:35.010> think<00:02:35.069> I

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
two of them and they cost me I think I

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:40.010 
two of them and they cost me I think I
run<00:02:35.670> about<00:02:35.760> 16<00:02:36.360> pounds<00:02:36.660> to<00:02:37.530> buy<00:02:37.650> the<00:02:37.709> two
