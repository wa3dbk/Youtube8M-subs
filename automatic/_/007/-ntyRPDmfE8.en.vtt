00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:20.109 
them as well my thought on that was that

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:22.440 
them as well my thought on that was that
maybe<00:03:20.290> the<00:03:21.130> birth<00:03:21.310> mom<00:03:21.489> would<00:03:21.640> have<00:03:21.760> more<00:03:22.209> kids

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
maybe the birth mom would have more kids

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.729 
maybe the birth mom would have more kids
down<00:03:22.630> the<00:03:22.780> road<00:03:23.400> and<00:03:24.400> so<00:03:25.060> we<00:03:25.959> got<00:03:26.079> a<00:03:26.140> call<00:03:26.470> about
