basically a joke and it shook them up I

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:19.039 
basically a joke and it shook them up I
think<00:02:17.849> that<00:02:17.940> we<00:02:18.000> need<00:02:18.120> to<00:02:18.180> be<00:02:18.390> looking<00:02:18.750> at<00:02:18.900> the

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:19.049 
think that we need to be looking at the

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:21.229 
think that we need to be looking at the
world<00:02:19.230> as<00:02:19.500> was<00:02:20.010> very<00:02:20.250> worried<00:02:20.519> for<00:02:20.700> your<00:02:20.849> New

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
world as was very worried for your New

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:22.580 
world as was very worried for your New
World<00:02:21.420> Order<00:02:21.660> thing<00:02:21.810> I<00:02:21.930> think<00:02:22.140> we<00:02:22.200> need<00:02:22.440> to

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
World Order thing I think we need to

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.350 
World Order thing I think we need to
look<00:02:22.709> at<00:02:22.799> the<00:02:22.860> world<00:02:23.040> as<00:02:23.220> one<00:02:23.730> inclusive

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
look at the world as one inclusive

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.759 
look at the world as one inclusive
entity<00:02:24.720> what<00:02:25.019> is<00:02:25.110> it<00:02:25.230> look<00:02:25.349> at<00:02:25.410> what<00:02:25.560> how<00:02:25.709> many

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:25.769 
entity what is it look at what how many

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:26.809 
entity what is it look at what how many
people<00:02:26.129> there<00:02:26.220> are<00:02:26.250> on<00:02:26.310> the<00:02:26.430> planet<00:02:26.580> we<00:02:26.760> need

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
people there are on the planet we need

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:27.860 
people there are on the planet we need
to<00:02:26.940> look<00:02:27.030> at<00:02:27.150> the<00:02:27.239> resources<00:02:27.569> that<00:02:27.780> are

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
to look at the resources that are

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.000 
to look at the resources that are
available<00:02:27.930> and<00:02:28.379> what's<00:02:28.500> the<00:02:28.560> most<00:02:28.680> sensible

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
available and what's the most sensible

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.320 
available and what's the most sensible
thing<00:02:29.340> to<00:02:29.370> do<00:02:29.640> with<00:02:29.849> that<00:02:29.970> I<00:02:30.000> think<00:02:30.150> that's

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
thing to do with that I think that's

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:31.610 
thing to do with that I think that's
gonna<00:02:30.420> be<00:02:30.480> a<00:02:30.569> massive<00:02:30.989> change<00:02:31.230> for<00:02:31.379> the<00:02:31.440> power

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
gonna be a massive change for the power

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:32.780 
gonna be a massive change for the power
structures<00:02:32.069> as<00:02:32.190> they<00:02:32.310> currently<00:02:32.519> exist

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
structures as they currently exist

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.130 
structures as they currently exist
that's<00:02:33.180> what<00:02:33.360> I<00:02:33.390> think<00:02:33.660> we<00:02:33.720> need<00:02:33.840> to<00:02:33.900> look<00:02:34.019> at

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
that's what I think we need to look at

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.300 
that's what I think we need to look at
the<00:02:34.200> resources<00:02:34.560> that<00:02:34.709> are<00:02:34.829> available<00:02:34.890> and

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
the resources that are available and

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:36.620 
the resources that are available and
what's<00:02:35.459> the<00:02:35.519> most<00:02:35.640> sensible<00:02:35.970> thing<00:02:36.299> to<00:02:36.329> do

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
what's the most sensible thing to do

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:37.520 
what's the most sensible thing to do
with<00:02:36.810> that<00:02:36.959> I<00:02:36.989> think<00:02:37.110> that's<00:02:37.230> gonna<00:02:37.380> be<00:02:37.440> a

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
with that I think that's gonna be a

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.020 
with that I think that's gonna be a
massive<00:02:37.950> change<00:02:38.190> for<00:02:38.370> the<00:02:38.430> power<00:02:38.579> structures

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
massive change for the power structures

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:47.059 
massive change for the power structures
as<00:02:39.150> they

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:03:03.690

I really wanted to get the essence of

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
where you think things are going I think

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:08.400
