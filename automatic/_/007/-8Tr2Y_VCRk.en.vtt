00:00:00.729 --> 00:00:04.439
 hello friends here are myopic and biomass this time the biennial cry of 

00:00:04.439 --> 00:00:06.370
 the nintendo console 

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:09.379
 the first nintendo console to see the light 

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:12.989
 was launched on the market in 1983 to Japan 

00:00:12.989 --> 00:00:15.989
 in the year 1985 united states 

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:20.059
 that is why I believe that the encino machine requires presentation since all the 

00:00:20.059 --> 00:00:22.470
 played fingers I played from the old school 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:23.720
 even the moderns 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.060
 by listening to whatever once talked about this console 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.199
 a 10 for sale you can not play consoles the truth is very good 

00:00:30.819 --> 00:00:32.880
 in with titles like those that have 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.470
 by 100 later the misgivings of some 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:38.710
 in it alone it deserves a compulsory purchase in those times 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.480
 even today there is a small demand for the console is still selling 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.900
 something is not much 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:44.950
 but 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:47.510
 believe even after 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.110
 25 years still reading something 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:52.660
 something surprising 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.700
 this console belongs the third generation 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.910
 together with system weapons and the graphic trick and 6 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.460
 sold around 61 million units 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.909
 61 million not even master system with their 12 million and tortures with their 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:12.220
 10 million sold 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.920
 combined can reach half of this beast 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.430
 a total best seller 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.800
 and it is not for less with titles like Super Mario 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:21.950
 as a cell 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:22.950
 tetris 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.240
 the mega man 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.660
 The cons 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:28.660
 percent and infinity of metal games and ace 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.900
 and even emeterio is a taboo because metal they think that most of the 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:35.900
 people think 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.580
 that was a pioneer in playstation but they are wrong 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.850
 was a pioneer in nintendo pulled out of metal cuttlefish 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.530
 in the nintendo console are like they are very classic games in Munich 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:46.630
 We will find 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.420
 but if there are 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.760
 the senator has consolidated 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.660
 I like it in opinion 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.000
 it's as common as a box 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.270
 which mixes the cream colors red and black 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.390
 this digital network are like queens kind of the atp to that of tahrir 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:07.010
 they are simply for the console to breathe when it is very hot 

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:12.399
 tick control 

00:02:12.399 --> 00:02:14.729
 percent control 

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:16.959
 for me it is perfect 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:19.909
 not only because then much 

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:21.819
 in those times atari 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:24.979
 He removed all his controls with levers 

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:28.789
 I was very angry or sometimes in putting the lever and uncomfortable to play 

00:02:28.789 --> 00:02:30.609
 Nintendo comes what changed everything 

00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:32.949
 fabulous coast cruises 

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:34.789
 that there was not so much videogames 

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:38.239
 that even nowadays the crosshead is seen all with shades even the 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:40.619
 most modern controls you can see as a batch 

00:02:40.619 --> 00:02:42.699
 this is 3 3% 

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:45.469
 2 out of 3 62 good 

00:02:45.469 --> 00:02:48.780
 nintendo was the one that the power forward of the people corporán a cross 

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:51.419
 but those of control 

00:02:51.419 --> 00:02:52.919
 the concerted 

00:02:52.919 --> 00:02:55.319
 it is very uncomfortable very hard 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:56.960
 sometimes it hurts you 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:59.149
 when playing for a long time 

00:02:59.149 --> 00:03:02.539
 internal what hurts you are the edges of the lack of control 

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:05.759
 since as you can see it is simply a picture 

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:08.989
 the tips are very sterile 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:10.029
 sharp 

00:03:10.029 --> 00:03:12.279
 once in me and in my childhood 

00:03:12.279 --> 00:03:13.519
 percent 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:16.069
 as a town so in 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:17.089
 and I lost 

00:03:17.089 --> 00:03:18.939
 and 3l both the control 

00:03:18.939 --> 00:03:22.689
 that I even hurt my left hand and missy a little hole 

00:03:22.689 --> 00:03:23.770
 on that list in him 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:27.039
 We exaggerate seriously PC 

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:30.139
 this take the the select button 

00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:34.769
 mundi is for that since as mentioned above with more than 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:35.569
 system 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:38.869
 placed the cones of these buttons on the console 

00:03:38.869 --> 00:03:42.079
 I really do not know what they were thinking 

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:43.280
 percent 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:44.839
 the one with the button 

00:03:44.839 --> 00:03:46.079
 the vote more 

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:48.879
 the buttons and are very comfortable 

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:50.449
 and easy people 

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:53.659
 they put them to the first 

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:54.980
 the senator control 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:58.849
 percent is a picture but colors a subject a lot of attention even today in 

00:03:58.849 --> 00:03:59.619
 day 

00:03:59.619 --> 00:04:02.149
 mix perfectly the color black and red 

00:04:02.149 --> 00:04:04.979
 and the cream 

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:08.179
 percent said it's a matter of taste that he likes that control more 

00:04:08.179 --> 00:04:09.619
 can more than attend 

00:04:09.619 --> 00:04:11.129
 old school control 

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:14.509
 I bow for this one I really like more 

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:17.389
 the wire 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:18.900
 it is another strong point 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:21.379
 that looks at us like two meters 

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:22.999
 more or less 

00:04:22.999 --> 00:04:25.999
 and this the 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.889
 you can sit on the sofa adén 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:33.380
 n in the armchair this on a chair and 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:36.450
 perfectly play with the console in a building 

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:38.270
 pound 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:40.020
 they know by the floor 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.879
 and not like táriq the plus cables were so short that you have to place cloth 

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:45.090
 consonant his feet 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:48.090
 I read your legs or a the ground because it was about half a meter 

00:04:49.999 --> 00:04:51.779
 with sections of the console 

00:04:51.779 --> 00:04:54.430
 age that has the pause button 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:56.580
 for on and off 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:58.090
 the table vote 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:00.839
 for the Etruscans how it worked 

00:05:00.839 --> 00:05:03.400
 per hundred checkpoint number one 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.849
 checkpoint number 2 

00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:07.050
 this little door 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:08.240
 is for games 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:11.240
 was criticized but in my opinion I like it 

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:13.569
 the athens that open 

00:05:13.569 --> 00:05:16.449
 laws that is inside be the games 

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:19.610
 the cartridges are something big 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.580
 but this afternoon with them 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:24.650
 percent the truth 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:25.680
 I like them 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:29.169
 although as I said that very big but it is the truth 

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:30.980
 he looks good to me the modern 

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:33.120
 I do not know what you think 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:36.339
 percent was criticized these because 

00:05:36.339 --> 00:05:39.650
 I do not know if this was lived the time of the apogee of the calculations 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:41.520
 I do 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:43.020
 to exhibit and horse 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:45.860
 that abc cartridges for example this 

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:48.669
 you have to enter the 

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:50.779
 read pressure to those below 

00:05:50.779 --> 00:05:52.610
 and sometimes not Navarre 

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:55.610
 and he was very angry or having to press again more 

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:59.150
 take out what sometimes love battles sacal cartridges 

00:06:00.279 --> 00:06:01.600
 and that's why he was criticized 

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:05.550
 since I was referring to the member of the catrachos because sometimes she did not grab us 

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:09.210
 i have to be an old school trick tip that was blowing in the 

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:11.069
 cartridge on the plate 

00:06:11.069 --> 00:06:14.069
 and they will come back externally it will cost you work maybe not 

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:18.729
 interest will be payments or this because you have to put it back pressure 

00:06:18.729 --> 00:06:22.940
 to those below and if it did not work to press again to carlo and not like the 

00:06:22.939 --> 00:06:24.699
 master system or the atari 

00:06:24.699 --> 00:06:28.759
 that we simply knock it down we voted it out the blown love centers and 

00:06:28.759 --> 00:06:30.039
 quickly 

00:06:30.039 --> 00:06:33.919
 this topic is that it speaks for you rate carbon blowing not putting pressure on it 

00:06:34.639 --> 00:06:38.580
 But it's a matter of taste, I like it a lot because so much in special 

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:41.580
 because the dust protects the machines that the cases 

00:06:42.879 --> 00:06:45.800
 definitely a great console 

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.800
 for a hundred for me the most classic thing of the old school 

00:06:49.399 --> 00:06:52.610
 I repeat repeating a 10 to 20 to the world it can be more 

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:54.619
 for that great cause console 

00:06:54.619 --> 00:06:55.789
 and for the repairs that he left
