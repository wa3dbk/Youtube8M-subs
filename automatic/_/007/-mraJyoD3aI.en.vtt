00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:21.990
 famous classic cocktail coined 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.630
 a long time ago though in the classic bar 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.650
 Minsk classification includes only 87 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.220
 wrong year 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.900
 most popular versions are considered there 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.510
 in which you cocktail coined forty 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.460
 fourth year his authorship is credited 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:39.260
 yourself bartender trader wick 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:42.059
 which was a network of whole bars in 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:44.429
 pacific style and he's constantly 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.309
 invented and cocktails that were 

00:00:44.429 --> 00:00:49.829
 tied to fresh juices here 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.079
 all sorts of such things and when he's in 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.179
 once again I conjured one of 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.929
 cocktails and to him according to legend 

00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:59.639
 guests have come back recently 

00:00:56.929 --> 00:01:02.039
 stand and when he gave them a try from 

00:00:59.639 --> 00:01:02.600
 cocktails they exclaimed something like mai 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.579
 tai 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:08.460
 Aaron as something like this 

00:01:05.579 --> 00:01:09.750
 I simply forgot the language and that already in 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.570
 translation means 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.820
 like a good or divine somehow a lot 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.429
 there any variations well, in general, that's how 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.539
 here so in the original recipe 

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:21.049
 this cocktail 

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:22.979
 there were several types of rum and 

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:26.250
 corasau liqueur 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:28.109
 this orange liqueur looks like this 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.299
 here are blue so many have seen 

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:32.850
 many in which cocktails are added but 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.859
 now when cooking classic 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.229
 mai tai and also used orange 

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:39.179
 colorless liquor is triple sec 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:42.539
 or quantum rock that we all love we 

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:44.790
 We also know a special highlight. 

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:47.460
 add 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.740
 cocktails almond liqueur or almond 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.360
 the syrup that you find in your home bar 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.120
 why i say what you find because 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.340
 what a great many discrepancies this 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:59.400
 cocktails exist I've seen more than once 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.830
 bar cards in which there were two 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:04.530
 three or more may taif i mean you can 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:06.479
 directly select from the list today we will 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.280
 cook a classic version of a cocktail 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:11.310
 this cocktail is actually 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.590
 strong enough when i worked in 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.690
 pains to visit asked me to cook 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.910
 him something strong alcoholic on 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.890
 so that the alcohol does not feel look 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.260
 fun trend fits drunk 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.570
 man when I can drink that thread 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.310
 to sober up or can I have that 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.750
 the thread is very strong alcoholic but to 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.940
 alcohol was not felt because I 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.680
 I want a girl there to drink all they want 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.600
 so that you can have a sondo face but with 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.580
 this so that the stage is elk like coca cola in 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.770
 such cases actually have a way out 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.500
 including this mai tai in it is so not 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:42.360
 I feel alcohol that I usually 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.730
 cooking this cocktail showed 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.860
 guest pouring alcohol how much 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.790
 contains alcohol and then added 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.610
 a little juice 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.110
 I do not try and said so if it is not 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.090
 video don't say so and here it is 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.110
 alcohol in general is such a lot 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.230
 unique cocktail 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:00.000
 served in hi were predominantly 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:02.370
 let's cool him a little house to us 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.750
 need a shaker naturally we too 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:09.269
 naturally fill it with ice start 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:14.209
 immediately natural with alcohol is three 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:17.209
 types of rum white gold and black 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:17.209
 gold 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.140
 black White 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:31.400
 orange colorless liquor Cointreau 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.440
 slightly less than the Roma Roma 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.220
 roughly equal and almond liqueur 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:38.209
 amaretto 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:40.459
 quite tasty liqueur itself 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:42.520
 him a lot of cocktails get but 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:45.230
 such an unusual refined taste 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:46.520
 because of alcohol it's all up and add 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:50.840
 some syrup 

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:53.090
 I recommend you caramel here 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:04:01.250
 notice how small everything is 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:04:04.100
 the rest except alcohol, that's all 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:06.650
 as I said, only alcohol 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:08.750
 now we add a little juice there 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:10.540
 all sorts of options such juices 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:13.100
 added but most often taken 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.750
 orange pineapple and naturally 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:16.669
 recommended freshly squeezed us 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:18.730
 trace doing freshly therefore 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:21.620
 add just orange and pineapple 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:27.350
 I will take the actual cocktail 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:29.840
 we try with your permission it is beautiful 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:31.580
 as always not really like that 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.710
 feeling that there is no alcohol in it 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:36.650
 either very little of it 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:38.540
 so how is this classic 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:42.110
 tropical cocktail we naturally 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:45.110
 make it look like tropical 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:47.690
 stumble in there all sorts of umbrellas well and 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:49.419
 rules of good tone of course so that 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:52.570
 he succumbed decorated with fruit 

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:55.010
 pineapples oranges umbrellas 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:57.950
 toothpicks could still be worn 

00:04:55.010 --> 00:05:00.790
 I tried to make in melon somehow very much 

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:04.510
 taste a good eugraf 

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:07.819
 we are beautiful mai tai and exclaim 

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:10.889
 what do you say 

00:05:07.819 --> 00:05:12.509
 Awesome feel a large number 

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:14.789
 alcohol is never felt 

00:05:12.509 --> 00:05:17.330
 one feels so everyone watched the guests so 

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:22.589
 always say something world days 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:23.209
 take it so here are the usual mode 

00:05:22.589 --> 00:05:27.809
 language 

00:05:23.209 --> 00:05:28.879
 I asked for stronger normally not yet so 

00:05:27.809 --> 00:05:31.080
 expensive 

00:05:28.879 --> 00:05:33.360
 one of the most expensive cocktails in 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:36.149
 America says about 7 dollars worth 

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:39.449
 because well, like all sorts of diets and three 

00:05:36.149 --> 00:05:42.569
 types of rum and Cointreau and at the same time 

00:05:39.449 --> 00:05:42.899
 light enough fruit lovely 

00:05:42.569 --> 00:05:46.319
 taste 

00:05:42.899 --> 00:05:49.159
 if you suddenly save at home 

00:05:46.319 --> 00:05:52.169
 the amount of alcohol you are well done 

00:05:49.159 --> 00:05:54.689
 try to be sure mai tai is 

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:56.669
 other varieties of final black 

00:05:54.689 --> 00:05:58.679
 rum is still desirable to add from 

00:05:56.669 --> 00:06:00.689
 some and cheeks under a white or from 

00:05:58.679 --> 00:06:02.669
 golden purely theoretically possible 

00:06:00.689 --> 00:06:03.869
 refuse should not give up 

00:06:02.669 --> 00:06:06.389
 Amaretto can be replaced 

00:06:03.869 --> 00:06:08.610
 liqueur on there syrup let's say almond 

00:06:06.389 --> 00:06:11.339
 yes it can be done but in general 

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:13.499
 delve into their huge recipes 

00:06:11.339 --> 00:06:15.779
 number on the Internet in the open spaces 

00:06:13.499 --> 00:06:17.909
 networks but see only us 

00:06:15.779 --> 00:06:19.289
 subscribe to the VKontakte group 

00:06:17.909 --> 00:06:22.079
 youtube on facebook 

00:06:19.289 --> 00:06:26.689
 leave comments and continue 

00:06:22.079 --> 00:06:26.689
 drink only with the mind of gentlemen all the best 

00:06:34.449 --> 00:06:41.689
 what else can you say about 

00:06:37.039 --> 00:06:43.999
 give it one more version give the report 

00:06:41.689 --> 00:06:45.919
 stupidity where I say and who is just 

00:06:43.999 --> 00:06:49.340
 I forgot to say interesting right there 

00:06:45.919 --> 00:06:51.349
 wanted forgot this can be given to him 

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:55.069
 due because his recipe was so 

00:06:51.349 --> 00:06:57.560
 more complete there were no screams mai tai 

00:06:55.069 --> 00:07:01.129
 and so on that someone he was there 

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:03.830
 coined by someone who said something 

00:07:01.129 --> 00:07:07.360
 that I'm confused in words already at all 

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:07.360
 says repeat
