00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 Hello everyone, let's consider how 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.960
 this equation is solved here 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.790
 prime numbers and so what is this with you 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.179
 There is a management in which there are two 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:15.269
 change variable n and variable cube and 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:17.940
 you need to find a solution to this equation in 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.770
 prime numbers first let's find how 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.289
 generally solve such an equation and then 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.930
 deal with prime numbers in this 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:28.050
 equation there is a cube a square y in the first 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.510
 degrees and just numbers mean rather 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.489
 just need to take advantage of what you 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.730
 know about quadratic equations and 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:38.660
 write it like this in 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:44.010
 squared minus confused 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:46.230
 plus b in cuba minus 80 i moved everything to 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.989
 the left side equated it to zero 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.600
 that's what i see i have a square 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.480
 equation in which here it is here and here 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.210
 This is here b But this term is not that 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.550
 otherwise as a square equation 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.780
 as you all know is solved through 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.860
 discriminant 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:11.640
 let's find it the discriminant d1 will be 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:16.290
 equal to 2500 minus b cubed minus 80 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.189
 or what is the same 2500 80 minus b 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.530
 cube 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:22.710
 if you have such a discriminant then 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:27.509
 value for root q you can find by 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:32.009
 formula 50 plus minus the root of such 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:35.909
 numbers 2 580 minus b in a cube 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:38.640
 so now what is simple 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.950
 numbers prime numbers are natural 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.310
 positive numbers which is divisible by 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:50.899
 unit and on himself ie this here 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:50.899
 these are the numbers 2357 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:56.909
 1113 and so on how to use them for 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.729
 solutions of this example are very simple 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:03.320
 you need to substitute all these simple 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:05.780
 numbers instead of pm get some 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:10.009
 lines that should be simple too 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:11.630
 number so plum you have is a cube in 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:13.790
 As a result, you should get a pair 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.280
 prime numbers q and p 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.290
 it should be noted that there are a lot of prime numbers 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:21.170
 and if you all represent something 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.709
 the lesson will end earlier but there is a good one 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.350
 news 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:27.170
 besides here these numbers that i'm here 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.040
 recorded no other prime numbers to you 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.930
 unsuitable 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.490
 because in this case you have 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.040
 a radical expression will be 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:36.380
 negative but if you substitute all 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.840
 these numbers instead of p tau know that 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:41.709
 one integer you do not get a 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:45.170
 This means that the answer to this example. 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:47.930
 there will be an empty solution set of simple 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:50.090
 numbers this equation has no about 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.950
 how other examples are solved you will learn 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.050
 from new videos if you have 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.760
 incomprehensible task send to
