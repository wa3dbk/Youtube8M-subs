00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:05.090
 ah ah 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.830
 paulo was the beauty of his channel 

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:19.680
 Reverse today I'll tell you, it's not 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.680
 about updating the motorola camera 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.220
 that the motorola camera application 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:29.130
 that she offers there in prehistory 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:31.919
 was to use that version 3.3 point 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.440
 20 points point 8 sorry 

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:37.400
 according to the teacher she came there 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:40.680
 to bring some patches and improvements 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:42.840
 is one of the functions that was put there is 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.890
 that you can now use a smartphone 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.100
 or to you 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.530
 the smart clocks that spin is the 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.810
 android is to shoot a 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:56.520
 photo for example is there with one will be one 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:01:00.750
 example of 60 you leave the cell phone 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:05.880
 discreet of you press on the clock it 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:08.700
 Go there and do the shot, it 's the camera. 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.700
 the request also corrects some 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.130
 errors and improved performance be it the 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.240
 shot is much faster now it's a 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.749
 app 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:21.570
 So I'm going to open it for you, it's for 

00:01:18.749 --> 00:01:25.109
 example if the pec O animation also changed 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:27.450
 and also faster is the shot too 

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:30.060
 had some changes in the interface of the 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.140
 but these are a bit more 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:36.170
 discreet 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:38.369
 It's the icon for you to the front camera. 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:41.399
 It's to assert 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:46.710
 they are well in the style the hydrogen is 

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:50.670
 with matter design is so slightly more 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:54.719
 so much more minimalist and there are 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:57.659
 an icon here from the south does not have any more now 

00:01:54.719 --> 00:02:03.179
 It's just one of the camera you squeeze you can 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:05.490
 either netapp 1080p or slow motion then 

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:13.550
 he was hidden here before and had the 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:18.000
 own icon dr 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:20.660
 when you press nÃ© until the letters 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:28.130
 stay a little more discreet 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:30.260
 very interesting is that it is aa manual 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:33.020
 quality of hdr photos in my 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:35.480
 You think she's much better now and 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:37.760
 also faster is almost like 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.690
 when you take a photo mode 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.850
 automatic 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:44.150
 I'm going to show you a lack, right? 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:48.620
 video made after this update is 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:49.550
 for you to see even if the best is the 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.270
 quality 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:52.270
 everything else is 

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:04.280
 This is it people 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:09.110
 in my opinion it's not about the 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:12.440
 update to version 3.6 point 20.8 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:14.780
 of the motorola camera is like underneath you 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:18.140
 it is also found some improvement 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:22.460
 If you think it's good, it got bad. 

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:26.150
 That 's it, it's for a short video of ours. 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:29.480
 facebook page is I do not know there 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:33.200
 review also of my still 400 nortec if 

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:35.500
