years<00:01:49.890> in<00:01:49.950> high<00:01:50.070> school<00:01:50.210> what<00:01:51.210> advice<00:01:51.509> do<00:01:51.720> you

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
years in high school what advice do you

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:52.969 
years in high school what advice do you
have<00:01:51.840> or<00:01:52.170> what<00:01:52.290> encouragement<00:01:52.799> might<00:01:52.890> you

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
have or what encouragement might you

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.490 
have or what encouragement might you
have<00:01:53.009> for<00:01:53.189> them<00:01:53.460> to<00:01:53.610> stick<00:01:53.850> to<00:01:54.000> it<00:01:54.149> right<00:01:54.500> it's

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
have for them to stick to it right it's

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.289 
have for them to stick to it right it's
a<00:01:55.649> great<00:01:55.860> question<00:01:56.070> you<00:01:56.460> know<00:01:56.579> I<00:01:56.610> was<00:01:56.850> a<00:01:56.880> person

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
a great question you know I was a person

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:58.429 
a great question you know I was a person
for<00:01:57.509> whom<00:01:57.689> and<00:01:57.899> that's<00:01:58.049> what<00:01:58.170> I'm<00:01:58.229> gonna<00:01:58.320> be

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
for whom and that's what I'm gonna be

00:01:58.439 --> 00:01:59.920 
for whom and that's what I'm gonna be
talking<00:01:58.469> about<00:01:58.920> at<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.189> festival<00:01:59.640> today

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 
talking about at the festival today

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.030 
talking about at the festival today
science<00:02:00.930> didn't<00:02:01.200> come<00:02:01.350> easily<00:02:01.560> to<00:02:01.799> me

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
science didn't come easily to me

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.209 
science didn't come easily to me
what<00:02:02.670> did<00:02:02.880> come<00:02:03.119> easy<00:02:03.360> to<00:02:03.479> me<00:02:03.600> was<00:02:04.110> trying<00:02:04.890> to

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
what did come easy to me was trying to

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:06.920 
what did come easy to me was trying to
be<00:02:05.340> organized<00:02:05.820> so<00:02:06.240> that<00:02:06.360> it<00:02:06.479> didn't<00:02:06.780> feel<00:02:06.899> out

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
be organized so that it didn't feel out

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.169 
be organized so that it didn't feel out
of<00:02:07.229> control<00:02:07.649> and<00:02:07.920> I<00:02:08.369> think<00:02:08.640> a<00:02:08.759> lot<00:02:08.910> of<00:02:08.940> parents

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
of control and I think a lot of parents

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.340 
of control and I think a lot of parents
don't<00:02:09.569> understand<00:02:10.050> that<00:02:10.470> to<00:02:10.770> a<00:02:10.800> teenage<00:02:11.310> mind

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
don't understand that to a teenage mind

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:13.720 
don't understand that to a teenage mind
it<00:02:12.410> really<00:02:12.680> feels<00:02:12.980> like<00:02:13.100> it's<00:02:13.280> a<00:02:13.520> full-time

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
it really feels like it's a full-time

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.420 
it really feels like it's a full-time
job<00:02:13.970> and<00:02:14.630> it's<00:02:15.140> often<00:02:15.890> really<00:02:16.190> really

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
job and it's often really really

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:17.800 
job and it's often really really
overwhelming<00:02:16.730> and<00:02:17.180> I<00:02:17.270> think<00:02:17.480> that's<00:02:17.630> where<00:02:17.780> a

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
overwhelming and I think that's where a

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.530 
overwhelming and I think that's where a
lot<00:02:18.050> of<00:02:18.260> young<00:02:18.890> people<00:02:19.100> say<00:02:19.550> like<00:02:19.850> I<00:02:20.060> can't<00:02:20.330> do

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
lot of young people say like I can't do

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.740 
lot of young people say like I can't do
this<00:02:20.750> and<00:02:21.170> so<00:02:21.680> I<00:02:21.710> think<00:02:21.920> for<00:02:22.220> me<00:02:22.280> it<00:02:23.270> was<00:02:23.330> so

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
this and so I think for me it was so

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.510 
this and so I think for me it was so
worth<00:02:23.990> it<00:02:24.230> to<00:02:24.500> try<00:02:24.650> and<00:02:24.710> find<00:02:24.890> a<00:02:25.190> way<00:02:25.220> that

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520 
worth it to try and find a way that

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.340 
worth it to try and find a way that
worked<00:02:25.700> for<00:02:25.970> me<00:02:26.090> even<00:02:26.510> if<00:02:26.630> I<00:02:26.720> wasn't<00:02:26.900> top<00:02:27.200> of

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
worked for me even if I wasn't top of

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:29.890 
worked for me even if I wasn't top of
the<00:02:27.440> class<00:02:27.680> to<00:02:28.670> be<00:02:28.700> organized<00:02:29.270> and<00:02:29.600> to<00:02:29.750> know

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
the class to be organized and to know

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.510 
the class to be organized and to know
what<00:02:30.110> had<00:02:30.260> to<00:02:30.410> be<00:02:30.440> done<00:02:30.770> for<00:02:31.100> each<00:02:31.130> of<00:02:31.400> my

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520 
what had to be done for each of my

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.760 
what had to be done for each of my
classes<00:02:32.030> that<00:02:32.540> really<00:02:32.900> took<00:02:33.110> away<00:02:33.260> a<00:02:33.380> lot<00:02:33.650> of

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770 
classes that really took away a lot of

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:35.560 
classes that really took away a lot of
that<00:02:33.890> stress<00:02:34.190> so<00:02:34.550> that<00:02:34.700> I<00:02:34.730> could<00:02:34.970> focus<00:02:35.150> and<00:02:35.480> do

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:35.570 
that stress so that I could focus and do

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:37.150 
that stress so that I could focus and do
the<00:02:35.690> best<00:02:35.840> that<00:02:35.990> I<00:02:36.110> could<00:02:36.200> and<00:02:36.410> that's<00:02:36.980> pretty

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
the best that I could and that's pretty

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.950 
the best that I could and that's pretty
much<00:02:37.370> what<00:02:37.580> I<00:02:37.610> did<00:02:37.730> through<00:02:38.270> college<00:02:38.660> as<00:02:38.810> well

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:38.960 
much what I did through college as well

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:41.110 
much what I did through college as well
I<00:02:38.990> was<00:02:39.320> never<00:02:39.500> top<00:02:39.830> of<00:02:39.980> my<00:02:40.070> class<00:02:40.340> I<00:02:40.670> wasn't<00:02:41.030> a

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
I was never top of my class I wasn't a

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.390 
I was never top of my class I wasn't a
straight-a<00:02:41.390> student<00:02:42.040> but<00:02:43.040> it<00:02:43.130> was<00:02:43.250> really

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
straight-a student but it was really

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.250 
straight-a student but it was really
kind<00:02:43.670> of<00:02:43.700> being<00:02:43.880> organized<00:02:44.390> and<00:02:44.750> and<00:02:44.960> framing

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
kind of being organized and and framing

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.470 
kind of being organized and and framing
things<00:02:45.620> reasonably<00:02:46.340> that<00:02:46.820> really<00:02:47.120> helped<00:02:47.390> me

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
things reasonably that really helped me

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.660 
things reasonably that really helped me
keep<00:02:47.660> going<00:02:47.990> and<00:02:48.200> it's<00:02:48.560> worth<00:02:48.920> it<00:02:49.160> it's<00:02:49.400> worth

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
keep going and it's worth it it's worth

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.260 
keep going and it's worth it it's worth
it<00:02:49.820> because<00:02:50.000> the<00:02:50.750> entire<00:02:51.320> rest<00:02:51.710> of<00:02:51.890> your<00:02:52.010> life

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:52.270 
it because the entire rest of your life

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:55.000 
it because the entire rest of your life
absolutely<00:02:53.270> depends<00:02:53.870> on<00:02:54.020> what<00:02:54.350> you<00:02:54.470> do<00:02:54.680> in

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
absolutely depends on what you do in

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.340 
absolutely depends on what you do in
school<00:02:55.310> like<00:02:56.030> it<00:02:56.180> or<00:02:56.270> not<00:02:56.420> that's<00:02:56.780> the<00:02:56.900> way<00:02:57.110> our

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350 
school like it or not that's the way our

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:59.740 
school like it or not that's the way our
system<00:02:57.380> works<00:02:57.950> and<00:02:58.160> it<00:02:58.610> absolutely<00:02:59.000> is<00:02:59.510> worth

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
system works and it absolutely is worth

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.080 
system works and it absolutely is worth
it<00:02:59.990> so<00:03:00.230> much<00:03:00.410> more<00:03:00.650> is<00:03:00.830> open<00:03:01.220> to<00:03:01.370> you<00:03:01.520> and<00:03:01.700> in

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
it so much more is open to you and in

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:03.730 
it so much more is open to you and in
particular<00:03:02.600> if<00:03:02.750> you<00:03:02.870> embrace<00:03:03.110> you<00:03:03.500> know<00:03:03.620> the

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:03.740 
particular if you embrace you know the

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:05.590 
particular if you embrace you know the
STEM<00:03:03.950> subjects<00:03:04.490> science<00:03:04.880> and<00:03:05.060> technology<00:03:05.510> and

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:05.600 
STEM subjects science and technology and

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.230 
STEM subjects science and technology and
engineering<00:03:05.690> and<00:03:06.110> math<00:03:06.200> so<00:03:07.160> much<00:03:07.370> more<00:03:07.670> can<00:03:08.060> be

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:08.240 
engineering and math so much more can be

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.120 
engineering and math so much more can be
open<00:03:08.570> to<00:03:08.750> you<00:03:08.840> for<00:03:09.110> choices<00:03:09.560> when<00:03:09.800> you<00:03:09.950> grow<00:03:10.100> up

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.130 
open to you for choices when you grow up

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:13.300 
open to you for choices when you grow up
so<00:03:10.850> somewhere<00:03:11.240> watching<00:03:11.630> this<00:03:11.870> video<00:03:12.140> is<00:03:12.410> a<00:03:12.710> 13

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
so somewhere watching this video is a 13

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:16.720 
so somewhere watching this video is a 13
year<00:03:13.490> old<00:03:13.610> a<00:03:13.700> 14<00:03:14.090> year<00:03:14.240> old<00:03:15.040> that<00:03:16.040> is<00:03:16.190> thinking

year old a 14 year old that is thinking

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:18.010 
year old a 14 year old that is thinking
about<00:03:16.940> science<00:03:17.300> and<00:03:17.480> education<00:03:17.840> probably

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:18.020 
about science and education probably

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:19.930 
about science and education probably
sees<00:03:18.260> that<00:03:18.410> daunting<00:03:18.740> task<00:03:19.010> the<00:03:19.580> the

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
sees that daunting task the the

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:21.640 
sees that daunting task the the
overcoming<00:03:20.720> understanding<00:03:21.350> all<00:03:21.470> these

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
overcoming understanding all these

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.740 
overcoming understanding all these
things<00:03:21.920> that<00:03:22.040> seem<00:03:22.190> hard<00:03:22.450> do<00:03:23.450> you<00:03:23.510> have<00:03:23.600> any

many resources your school has but I

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.470 
many resources your school has but I
think<00:03:42.320> ultimately<00:03:42.520> you<00:03:43.520> know<00:03:43.640> we<00:03:44.030> live<00:03:44.270> in<00:03:44.390> an

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 
think ultimately you know we live in an

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.600 
think ultimately you know we live in an
amazing<00:03:44.720> country<00:03:45.380> where<00:03:45.830> there's<00:03:46.550> a

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:46.610 
amazing country where there's a

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:48.610 
amazing country where there's a
tremendous<00:03:47.180> amount<00:03:47.390> of<00:03:47.510> possibility<00:03:48.200> no

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620 
tremendous amount of possibility no

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.620 
tremendous amount of possibility no
matter<00:03:48.860> your<00:03:49.430> your<00:03:49.730> level<00:03:50.030> of<00:03:50.150> challenge<00:03:50.540> or

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:50.630 
matter your your level of challenge or

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:53.710 
matter your your level of challenge or
difficulty<00:03:51.200> and<00:03:52.100> and<00:03:52.400> I<00:03:52.490> think<00:03:52.820> if<00:03:53.030> this<00:03:53.540> is

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 
difficulty and and I think if this is

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.780 
difficulty and and I think if this is
something<00:03:54.080> you<00:03:54.200> love<00:03:54.440> there<00:03:54.950> there<00:03:55.280> has<00:03:55.520> to<00:03:55.550> be

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
something you love there there has to be

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:58.900 
something you love there there has to be
a<00:03:55.940> way<00:03:56.470> for<00:03:57.470> your<00:03:57.560> community<00:03:58.130> to<00:03:58.340> support<00:03:58.520> it

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:58.910 
a way for your community to support it

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:01.900 
a way for your community to support it
and<00:03:59.090> it<00:03:59.570> may<00:03:59.750> take<00:04:00.050> more<00:04:00.950> work<00:04:01.160> than<00:04:01.490> it<00:04:01.520> should

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:01.910 
and it may take more work than it should

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:04.810 
and it may take more work than it should
but<00:04:02.630> you<00:04:03.020> know<00:04:03.320> it's<00:04:03.530> it's<00:04:03.860> young<00:04:04.280> people<00:04:04.640> like

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:06.380 
that who then make those possibilities

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:08.590 
that who then make those possibilities
