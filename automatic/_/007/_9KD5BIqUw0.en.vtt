that<00:01:54.320> the<00:01:54.500> last<00:01:54.770> map<00:01:55.039> pack<00:01:55.310> for<00:01:55.520> black<00:01:55.700> ops<00:01:55.880> who

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
that the last map pack for black ops who

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.850 
that the last map pack for black ops who
it<00:01:57.210> was<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.540> beginning<00:01:57.990> of<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.409> whole<00:01:58.530> zombie

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
it was the beginning of the whole zombie

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.289 
it was the beginning of the whole zombie
storyline<00:01:59.130> which<00:01:59.400> was<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.670> first<00:01:59.790> outbreak

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
storyline which was the first outbreak

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.020 
storyline which was the first outbreak
at<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:00.930> excavation<00:02:01.470> point<00:02:02.070> that<00:02:02.460> we<00:02:02.700> all<00:02:02.850> know

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
at the excavation point that we all know

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.490 
at the excavation point that we all know
already<00:02:03.600> by<00:02:03.869> now<00:02:03.990> if<00:02:04.049> you<00:02:04.170> don't<00:02:04.320> know<00:02:04.380> what

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
already by now if you don't know what

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:05.120 
already by now if you don't know what
I'm<00:02:04.590> talking<00:02:04.740> about

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
I'm talking about

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.219 
I'm talking about
watch<00:02:05.549> part<00:02:05.970> 10<00:02:06.270> of<00:02:06.450> my<00:02:06.570> zombie<00:02:06.900> storyline

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
it's it's how it all started that was

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.540 
it's it's how it all started that was
the<00:02:09.149> original<00:02:09.360> outbreak<00:02:09.840> and<00:02:10.319> then<00:02:10.890> Nakamura

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
all happens after derice but we never

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.240 
all happens after derice but we never
really<00:02:15.989> talked<00:02:16.170> about<00:02:16.200> the<00:02:16.500> Marines<00:02:16.830> and<00:02:17.160> it

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
kind of faded into the past and even

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.580 
kind of faded into the past and even
even<00:02:21.150> if<00:02:21.480> you<00:02:21.600> look<00:02:21.810> them<00:02:21.959> up<00:02:22.110> like<00:02:22.380> if<00:02:22.500> you

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
even if you look them up like if you

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.140 
even if you look them up like if you
look<00:02:22.739> them<00:02:22.860> up<00:02:22.950> on<00:02:23.100> Google<00:02:23.459> and<00:02:23.640> stuff<00:02:23.850> it'll

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
look them up on Google and stuff it'll

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.940 
look them up on Google and stuff it'll
just<00:02:24.390> say<00:02:24.540> unidentified<00:02:24.840> Marines<00:02:25.709> but

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
just say unidentified Marines but

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.100 
just say unidentified Marines but
there's<00:02:26.670> a<00:02:26.730> few<00:02:26.910> details<00:02:27.090> about<00:02:27.510> them<00:02:27.870> that<00:02:28.050> a

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
there's a few details about them that a

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:29.990 
there's a few details about them that a
lot<00:02:28.200> of<00:02:28.350> people<00:02:28.650> missed<00:02:28.890> and<00:02:29.190> we're<00:02:29.910> just

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
lot of people missed and we're just

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.550 
lot of people missed and we're just
gonna<00:02:30.180> kind<00:02:30.390> of<00:02:30.540> go<00:02:30.690> over<00:02:30.900> that<00:02:31.140> go<00:02:31.320> through

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
gonna kind of go over that go through

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.920 
gonna kind of go over that go through
the<00:02:31.680> story<00:02:31.950> so<00:02:32.250> the<00:02:32.940> outbreak<00:02:33.390> starts<00:02:33.780> from

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
the story so the outbreak starts from

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.840 
the story so the outbreak starts from
the<00:02:34.080> cutscene<00:02:34.530> that<00:02:34.560> we<00:02:34.830> see<00:02:35.070> and<00:02:35.640> in<00:02:35.760> the

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
the cutscene that we see and in the

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:39.020 
the cutscene that we see and in the
cutscene<00:02:36.360> we<00:02:37.230> see<00:02:37.500> a<00:02:37.709> plane<00:02:38.100> that's<00:02:38.700> crashed

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
cutscene we see a plane that's crashed

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.960 
cutscene we see a plane that's crashed
we<00:02:39.660> see<00:02:39.870> someone<00:02:40.170> who's<00:02:40.500> kind<00:02:40.769> of<00:02:40.970> just

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
we see someone who's kind of just

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.490 
we see someone who's kind of just
getting<00:02:42.180> up<00:02:42.390> from<00:02:42.630> possibly<00:02:43.260> being

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
getting up from possibly being

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.229 
getting up from possibly being
unconscious<00:02:44.250> and<00:02:44.459> they<00:02:44.610> get<00:02:44.760> up<00:02:44.880> at<00:02:45.000> the<00:02:45.030> right

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
unconscious and they get up at the right

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:46.820 
unconscious and they get up at the right
time<00:02:45.300> because<00:02:45.810> zombies<00:02:46.050> start<00:02:46.410> running<00:02:46.709> at

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
time because zombies start running at

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.190 
time because zombies start running at
them<00:02:46.980> and<00:02:47.190> they<00:02:47.910> eventually<00:02:48.150> start<00:02:48.750> off<00:02:48.930> in

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
them and they eventually start off in

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.600 
them and they eventually start off in
the<00:02:49.319> map<00:02:49.530> which<00:02:49.830> is<00:02:49.860> where<00:02:50.160> they're<00:02:50.310> holding

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
the map which is where they're holding

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.150 
the map which is where they're holding
down<00:02:50.760> the<00:02:51.000> bunker<00:02:51.450> trying<00:02:52.380> to<00:02:52.470> survive<00:02:52.769> the

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
down the bunker trying to survive the

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.910 
down the bunker trying to survive the
night<00:02:53.519> of<00:02:53.670> the<00:02:53.819> Dead<00:02:54.030> as<00:02:54.300> it<00:02:55.170> is<00:02:55.319> called<00:02:55.680> you

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
night of the Dead as it is called you

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.290 
night of the Dead as it is called you
know<00:02:55.950> it's<00:02:56.160> basically<00:02:56.580> whatnot<00:02:57.060> they're<00:02:57.209> in

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
know it's basically whatnot they're in

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.520 
know it's basically whatnot they're in
total<00:02:57.450> means<00:02:58.519> so<00:02:59.900> it<00:03:00.900> looks<00:03:01.140> like<00:03:01.320> they<00:03:01.470> were

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
total means so it looks like they were

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.350 
total means so it looks like they were
Marines<00:03:01.799> they<00:03:02.250> were<00:03:02.310> on<00:03:02.519> a<00:03:02.549> plane<00:03:02.880> of<00:03:03.120> some

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
Marines they were on a plane of some

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.050 
Marines they were on a plane of some
sort<00:03:03.720> it<00:03:04.320> comes<00:03:04.799> down<00:03:05.010> at<00:03:05.160> crashes<00:03:05.730> and<00:03:05.970> they

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
sort it comes down at crashes and they

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.920 
sort it comes down at crashes and they
find<00:03:06.390> themselves<00:03:06.600> in<00:03:07.290> enemy<00:03:07.680> territory<00:03:08.930> which

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
find themselves in enemy territory which

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.350 
find themselves in enemy territory which
is<00:03:10.230> overrun<00:03:10.739> by<00:03:10.799> zombies<00:03:10.980> so<00:03:11.670> this<00:03:11.940> basically

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
is overrun by zombies so this basically

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.000 
is overrun by zombies so this basically
means<00:03:12.720> that<00:03:12.900> there<00:03:13.140> was<00:03:13.260> some<00:03:13.709> sort<00:03:13.890> of

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
means that there was some sort of

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.150 
means that there was some sort of
outbreak<00:03:14.750> in<00:03:15.750> the<00:03:15.810> middle<00:03:16.200> of<00:03:16.320> the<00:03:16.410> war<00:03:16.620> world

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
outbreak in the middle of the war world

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:18.860 
outbreak in the middle of the war world
war<00:03:17.310> two<00:03:17.700> there<00:03:18.030> was<00:03:18.150> some<00:03:18.329> sort<00:03:18.510> of<00:03:18.630> outbreak

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
war two there was some sort of outbreak

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.199
