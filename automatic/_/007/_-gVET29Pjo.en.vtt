call some chocolate rain so I i also got
a<00:00:30.960> wall<00:00:31.769> design<00:00:32.189> which<00:00:32.640> just<00:00:33.030> moves<00:00:33.359> the

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
a wall design which just moves the

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.479 
a wall design which just moves the
entire<00:00:33.600> wall<00:00:34.199> and<00:00:34.469> pops<00:00:34.710> off<00:00:34.890> all<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.160> cocoa

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
entire wall and pops off all the cocoa

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:41.450 
entire wall and pops off all the cocoa
beans<00:00:37.039> so<00:00:38.510> yeah<00:00:39.510> let's<00:00:39.960> just<00:00:40.190> show<00:00:41.190> you<00:00:41.250> how<00:00:41.399> to

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
beans so yeah let's just show you how to

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.729 
beans so yeah let's just show you how to
build<00:00:41.699> these<00:00:41.879> all<00:00:42.510> right<00:00:42.989> so<00:00:43.199> let's<00:00:43.320> just<00:00:43.469> say

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
build these all right so let's just say

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.380 
build these all right so let's just say
this<00:00:43.920> is<00:00:44.100> gonna<00:00:44.219> be<00:00:44.370> a<00:00:44.399> floor<00:00:44.760> level<00:00:45.089> you<00:00:45.179> place

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
this is gonna be a floor level you place

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.090 
this is gonna be a floor level you place
your<00:00:45.539> pressure<00:00:45.839> plate<00:00:46.199> here<00:00:46.649> your<00:00:46.859> some

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
your pressure plate here your some

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.989 
your pressure plate here your some
jungle<00:00:47.370> with<00:00:47.670> right<00:00:47.910> there<00:00:48.440> go<00:00:49.440> down<00:00:50.070> one<00:00:50.579> so

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:50.999 
jungle with right there go down one so

00:00:50.999 --> 00:00:52.790 
jungle with right there go down one so
this<00:00:51.239> is<00:00:51.480> going<00:00:51.780> to<00:00:51.839> be<00:00:51.929> showing<00:00:52.109> when<00:00:52.409> it<00:00:52.559> pops

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
this is going to be showing when it pops

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.630 
this is going to be showing when it pops
up<00:00:53.010> then<00:00:53.640> a<00:00:53.670> redstone<00:00:54.120> block<00:00:54.480> normal<00:00:55.640> this

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
up then a redstone block normal this

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.750 
up then a redstone block normal this
move<00:00:56.909> will<00:00:57.089> block<00:00:57.359> and<00:00:57.659> then<00:00:58.559> a<00:00:58.800> normal<00:00:59.370> piston

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
move will block and then a normal piston

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.639 
move will block and then a normal piston
that<00:00:59.909> will<00:01:00.059> push<00:01:00.269> up<00:01:00.510> don't<00:01:00.749> worry<00:01:00.929> about<00:01:01.109> that

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
that will push up don't worry about that

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.880 
that will push up don't worry about that
so<00:01:02.609> now<00:01:02.819> you<00:01:02.879> have<00:01:02.969> one<00:01:03.269> two<00:01:03.480> three<00:01:04.290> four<00:01:04.589> five

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
so now you have one two three four five

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.980 
so now you have one two three four five
six<00:01:05.220> seven<00:01:05.399> jungle<00:01:06.149> wood<00:01:06.299> that's<00:01:06.630> your<00:01:06.810> block

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
six seven jungle wood that's your block

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.280 
six seven jungle wood that's your block
on<00:01:07.110> top<00:01:07.250> box<00:01:08.250> like<00:01:08.549> this<00:01:08.850> to<00:01:09.570> redstone<00:01:09.930> dust

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
on top box like this to redstone dust

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.520 
on top box like this to redstone dust
right<00:01:10.560> there<00:01:10.920> a<00:01:11.130> vet's<00:01:11.520> and<00:01:11.790> repeater<00:01:12.500> into<00:01:13.500> a

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
right there a vet's and repeater into a

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.039 
right there a vet's and repeater into a
block<00:01:13.979> that<00:01:14.009> dust<00:01:14.549> on<00:01:14.759> top<00:01:14.790> and<00:01:15.360> that<00:01:15.780> goes

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
block that dust on top and that goes

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.950 
block that dust on top and that goes
into<00:01:16.259> a<00:01:16.380> block<00:01:16.740> again<00:01:17.399> with<00:01:17.610> a<00:01:17.820> normal<00:01:18.390> piston

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
into a block again with a normal piston

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.370 
into a block again with a normal piston
right<00:01:19.170> there<00:01:20.899> actually<00:01:21.899> you<00:01:21.990> want<00:01:22.170> to<00:01:22.200> peel

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
right there actually you want to peel

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.139 
right there actually you want to peel
this<00:01:22.560> down<00:01:22.860> one<00:01:23.130> because<00:01:23.369> it<00:01:23.490> already<00:01:23.640> pushed

00:01:24.139 --> 00:01:24.149 
this down one because it already pushed

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:28.940 
this down one because it already pushed
up<00:01:24.590> so<00:01:25.590> let's<00:01:26.009> just<00:01:26.219> do<00:01:26.369> that<00:01:26.399> real<00:01:26.759> quick<00:01:27.950> like

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
up so let's just do that real quick like

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.830 
up so let's just do that real quick like
that's<00:01:29.250> a<00:01:29.430> redstone<00:01:29.789> dust<00:01:30.390> is<00:01:30.570> gonna<00:01:30.750> be

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
that's a redstone dust is gonna be

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.740 
that's a redstone dust is gonna be
powered<00:01:31.200> by<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.500> red<00:01:31.829> so<00:01:32.070> block<00:01:32.430> and<00:01:32.969> then<00:01:33.570> you

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
powered by the red so block and then you

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.590 
powered by the red so block and then you
have<00:01:33.899> your<00:01:33.930> repeater<00:01:34.680> like

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
have your repeater like

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.190 
have your repeater like
that's<00:01:36.189> the<00:01:37.189> reason<00:01:37.520> why<00:01:37.549> we<00:01:38.060> had<00:01:38.360> seven

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
that's the reason why we had seven

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.219 
that's the reason why we had seven
blocks<00:01:39.590> is<00:01:39.950> because<00:01:40.310> that<00:01:41.000> is<00:01:41.210> your<00:01:41.420> maximum

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:42.229 
blocks is because that is your maximum

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:47.170 
blocks is because that is your maximum
reach<00:01:42.770> right<00:01:43.189> in<00:01:43.610> survival<00:01:46.180> let's

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180 
reach right in survival let's

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.039 
reach right in survival let's
demonstrate<00:01:47.630> that<00:01:48.110> as<00:01:48.350> well<00:01:49.630> zero<00:01:50.630> there<00:01:50.960> we

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:51.049 
demonstrate that as well zero there we

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:53.260 
demonstrate that as well zero there we
go<00:01:51.259> so<00:01:51.950> you<00:01:52.040> can<00:01:52.159> reach<00:01:52.310> up<00:01:52.520> to<00:01:52.549> there<00:01:52.880> that

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
go so you can reach up to there that

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:54.340 
go so you can reach up to there that
there<00:01:53.540> is<00:01:53.750> going<00:01:53.780> to<00:01:53.960> be<00:01:53.990> more<00:01:54.290> difficult

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
there is going to be more difficult

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.850 
there is going to be more difficult
you're<00:01:55.250> going<00:01:55.729> to<00:01:55.789> have<00:01:55.909> to<00:01:56.030> be<00:01:56.119> jumping<00:01:56.860> like

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
you're going to have to be jumping like

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.520 
you're going to have to be jumping like
that<00:01:58.130> and<00:01:58.539> you<00:01:59.539> obviously<00:01:59.690> don't<00:02:00.289> want<00:02:00.409> that

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
that and you obviously don't want that

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.749 
that and you obviously don't want that
so<00:02:01.450> this<00:02:02.450> should<00:02:02.990> not<00:02:03.470> work<00:02:03.799> yet<00:02:04.190> because<00:02:04.610> we

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:04.759 
so this should not work yet because we

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:06.930 
so this should not work yet because we
didn't<00:02:05.000> put<00:02:05.180> in<00:02:05.299> our<00:02:05.570> activation<00:02:06.530> mechanism

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:06.940 
didn't put in our activation mechanism

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.609 
didn't put in our activation mechanism
and<00:02:07.940> all<00:02:08.090> we<00:02:08.239> do<00:02:08.420> that<00:02:08.630> is<00:02:08.840> just<00:02:08.869> take<00:02:09.350> our

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
and all we do that is just take our

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:11.740 
and all we do that is just take our
redstone<00:02:10.399> signal<00:02:10.729> from<00:02:11.090> the<00:02:11.239> pressure<00:02:11.540> plate

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
redstone signal from the pressure plate

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:17.949 
redstone signal from the pressure plate
from<00:02:12.080> down<00:02:12.290> here<00:02:12.610> that<00:02:13.610> goes<00:02:13.910> into<00:02:14.239> a<00:02:16.959> upside

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 
from down here that goes into a upside

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:19.690 
from down here that goes into a upside
down<00:02:18.110> half<00:02:18.290> slab<00:02:18.620> right<00:02:18.800> there<00:02:19.040> with<00:02:19.250> red<00:02:19.459> sand

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
down half slab right there with red sand

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.199 
down half slab right there with red sand
dust<00:02:19.850> on<00:02:20.030> top<00:02:20.060> I<00:02:21.250> want<00:02:22.250> to<00:02:22.280> note<00:02:22.430> that<00:02:22.459> this<00:02:22.970> is

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
dust on top I want to note that this is

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:26.020 
dust on top I want to note that this is
not<00:02:23.269> going<00:02:23.959> to<00:02:24.080> power<00:02:24.560> the<00:02:25.010> piston<00:02:25.489> the

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
not going to power the piston the

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:27.670 
not going to power the piston the
redstone<00:02:26.390> block<00:02:26.630> is<00:02:26.780> actually<00:02:27.140> powering<00:02:27.530> the

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
redstone block is actually powering the

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.250 
redstone block is actually powering the
piston<00:02:28.130> this<00:02:28.400> is<00:02:28.610> more<00:02:28.850> merely<00:02:29.450> updating<00:02:30.110> it

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
piston this is more merely updating it

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:35.320 
piston this is more merely updating it
so<00:02:31.569> yeah<00:02:32.569> to<00:02:33.340> prevent<00:02:34.340> any<00:02:34.549> confusion<00:02:35.180> in<00:02:35.299> the

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
so yeah to prevent any confusion in the

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.830 
so yeah to prevent any confusion in the
comments<00:02:35.840> down<00:02:35.959> below<00:02:36.880> it's<00:02:37.880> just<00:02:38.299> updating

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
comments down below it's just updating

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.210 
comments down below it's just updating
it

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
it

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.210 
it
so<00:02:40.880> that<00:02:41.240> works<00:02:41.480> let's<00:02:41.990> get<00:02:42.200> on<00:02:42.380> with<00:02:42.440> the<00:02:42.830> wall

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
so that works let's get on with the wall

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.430 
so that works let's get on with the wall
design<00:02:43.550> all<00:02:43.850> right<00:02:44.180> so<00:02:44.420> once<00:02:44.690> more<00:02:45.020> this<00:02:45.260> is

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
design all right so once more this is

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.410 
design all right so once more this is
going<00:02:45.590> to<00:02:45.650> be<00:02:45.740> your<00:02:46.160> floor<00:02:46.640> level<00:02:47.030> with<00:02:47.210> your

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
going to be your floor level with your

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.270 
going to be your floor level with your
pressure<00:02:47.720> plate<00:02:48.080> under<00:02:48.410> the<00:02:48.650> pressure<00:02:48.950> plate

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
pressure plate under the pressure plate

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.840 
pressure plate under the pressure plate
take<00:02:49.820> the<00:02:50.000> redstone<00:02:50.510> signal<00:02:51.200> out<00:02:51.530> like<00:02:52.280> that

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:52.850 
take the redstone signal out like that

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:54.880 
take the redstone signal out like that
then<00:02:53.210> place<00:02:53.420> two<00:02:53.660> upside<00:02:54.200> down<00:02:54.350> off<00:02:54.560> slabs

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
then place two upside down off slabs

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:56.650 
then place two upside down off slabs
right<00:02:55.100> there<00:02:55.370> redirect<00:02:55.910> the<00:02:56.060> redstone<00:02:56.450> like

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
right there redirect the redstone like

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.500 
right there redirect the redstone like
that<00:02:56.960> put<00:02:57.860> any<00:02:58.160> amount<00:02:58.430> of<00:02:58.520> Pistons<00:02:58.970> you<00:02:59.180> want

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
that put any amount of Pistons you want

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.510 
that put any amount of Pistons you want
facing<00:02:59.930> upwards<00:03:00.500> as<00:03:00.740> long<00:03:00.920> as<00:03:01.070> the<00:03:01.160> signal

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:01.520 
facing upwards as long as the signal

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:05.500 
facing upwards as long as the signal
still<00:03:01.730> reaches<00:03:02.300> like<00:03:03.260> that<00:03:03.800> then<00:03:04.460> place<00:03:04.790> again

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
still reaches like that then place again

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.320 
still reaches like that then place again
your<00:03:05.900> pistol<00:03:06.380> moveable<00:03:06.710> blocks<00:03:07.330> redstone

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.330 
your pistol moveable blocks redstone

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:10.840 
your pistol moveable blocks redstone
blocks<00:03:08.750> and<00:03:09.170> then<00:03:09.680> set<00:03:10.100> them<00:03:10.190> jungle<00:03:10.520> woods<00:03:10.700> so

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:10.850 
blocks and then set them jungle woods so

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:16.570 
blocks and then set them jungle woods so
one<00:03:11.090> two<00:03:11.390> three<00:03:11.630> four<00:03:11.900> or<00:03:12.440> five<00:03:12.950> six<00:03:13.280> seven

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:16.580 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:19.210 

redstone<00:03:17.510> blocks<00:03:17.840> on<00:03:18.140> the<00:03:18.380> top<00:03:18.590> actually

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
redstone blocks on the top actually

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:20.800 
redstone blocks on the top actually
remove<00:03:19.520> two<00:03:19.760> of<00:03:19.850> those<00:03:19.970> and<00:03:20.180> replace<00:03:20.510> them<00:03:20.660> by

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
remove two of those and replace them by

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.290 
remove two of those and replace them by
pissing<00:03:21.230> four<00:03:21.470> blocks<00:03:21.740> this<00:03:22.670> is<00:03:22.910> going<00:03:23.090> to<00:03:23.210> be

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:23.300 
pissing four blocks this is going to be

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.840 
pissing four blocks this is going to be
your<00:03:23.420> ceiling<00:03:23.930> or<00:03:24.110> at<00:03:24.320> least<00:03:24.560> a<00:03:24.770> rim<00:03:25.190> light

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:25.850 
your ceiling or at least a rim light

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:31.120 
your ceiling or at least a rim light
there<00:03:27.820> then<00:03:28.820> you<00:03:29.090> take<00:03:29.390> out<00:03:29.630> the<00:03:29.960> signal<00:03:30.500> with

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.130 
there then you take out the signal with

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:36.880 
there then you take out the signal with
a<00:03:31.930> repeater<00:03:32.930> on<00:03:33.020> three<00:03:33.320> tix<00:03:35.080> then<00:03:36.080> build<00:03:36.470> three

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:36.890 
a repeater on three tix then build three

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:38.980 
a repeater on three tix then build three
blocks<00:03:37.160> up<00:03:37.400> through<00:03:37.970> the<00:03:38.240> bottom<00:03:38.390> two<00:03:38.780> and

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:38.990 
blocks up through the bottom two and

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:43.450 
blocks up through the bottom two and
play<00:03:39.530> some<00:03:39.590> Pistons<00:03:40.250> right<00:03:40.520> there<00:03:41.800> like<00:03:42.800> back

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:43.460 
play some Pistons right there like back

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:45.610 
play some Pistons right there like back
and<00:03:43.820> then<00:03:44.090> run<00:03:44.390> your<00:03:44.420> redstone<00:03:44.930> signal<00:03:45.230> either

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 
and then run your redstone signal either

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:52.420 
and then run your redstone signal either
like<00:03:46.160> that<00:03:46.430> or<00:03:46.840> like<00:03:48.040> this<00:03:50.170> it<00:03:51.170> really<00:03:51.920> doesn't

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
like that or like this it really doesn't

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:56.800 
like that or like this it really doesn't
matter<00:03:52.550> how<00:03:52.820> you<00:03:52.850> do<00:03:53.360> it<00:03:54.880> as<00:03:55.880> long<00:03:56.060> as<00:03:56.390> those

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
matter how you do it as long as those

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:59.530 
matter how you do it as long as those
Pistons<00:03:57.500> get<00:03:57.650> activated<00:03:58.100> also<00:03:58.520> two<00:03:58.700> tix<00:03:58.970> you

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
Pistons get activated also two tix you

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.120 
Pistons get activated also two tix you
can<00:03:59.690> have<00:03:59.810> it<00:03:59.900> at<00:04:00.020> one<00:04:00.200> tick<00:04:00.440> but<00:04:00.680> I<00:04:00.709> just<00:04:00.950> like

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:01.130 
can have it at one tick but I just like

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:04.330 
can have it at one tick but I just like
to<00:04:01.340> keep<00:04:01.490> it<00:04:01.580> up<00:04:01.700> in<00:04:01.880> tikz<00:04:02.180> because<00:04:02.630> I<00:04:03.340> don't

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:04.340 
to keep it up in tikz because I don't

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:08.670 
to keep it up in tikz because I don't
know<00:04:04.430> it<00:04:04.550> looks<00:04:04.760> nicer<00:04:06.490> so<00:04:07.490> there's<00:04:07.730> one<00:04:07.910> pic<00:04:08.180> I

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
know it looks nicer so there's one pic I

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.710 
know it looks nicer so there's one pic I
don't<00:04:09.680> know<00:04:09.740> I<00:04:09.920> like<00:04:10.250> the<00:04:10.340> two<00:04:10.490> things<00:04:10.730> more<00:04:10.970> so

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:11.720 
don't know I like the two things more so

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:14.140 
don't know I like the two things more so
