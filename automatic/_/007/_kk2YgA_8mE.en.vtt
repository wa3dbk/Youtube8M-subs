tripod I think just because I looked at
the<00:02:38.310> picture<00:02:38.640> and<00:02:38.700> with<00:02:38.819> that<00:02:39.859> because<00:02:42.379> it

00:02:43.369 --> 00:02:43.379 
the picture and with that because it

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:46.059 
the picture and with that because it
looks<00:02:43.560> like<00:02:43.739> it<00:02:44.010> could<00:02:44.220> be<00:02:44.250> a<00:02:44.370> tripod<00:02:44.939> right

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:46.069
