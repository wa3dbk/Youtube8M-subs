00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:05.480
 one of the things that you like the 

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:06.859
 houses the Mexican food if it seems 

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:10.070
 lie but Mexican food has 

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:12.139
 an awesome quality today tacos with 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:14.629
 vegetables with chicken and tortillas 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:17.630
 I really know that there are many that 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:19.490
 they use rapid rap and we are going to make them 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:20.660
 with all the vegetables a new way 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:23.390
 also for the kids to eat 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:25.099
 vegetables all the vegetables that we treat 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:28.099
 that the boys eat, we are going to put them 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:29.780
 here in this Mexican party for the 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:31.610
 guys are bought 

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:33.560
 also the mature ones of their cuts 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:35.780
 will lie down and point to twin 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:37.700
 We have carrots, we have aubergines 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.160
 then put a little the vegetables that 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:42.470
 they stay but it's fun and apart from 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:45.170
 July you have in this case is when the 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:48.020
 guys with the fun of taking the 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:50.510
 I taco like the vegetables that you can not 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:52.210
 never achieve as I love 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.860
 zucchini salad packaging is left 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:57.010
 delicious you can also put the 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:02.150
 leaves if they want 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:05.290
 and obviously alternating meat 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:07.600
 chicken pork 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:11.470
 says several variants and we have 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:14.200
 pea and we have a bit of error 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.430
 also that we are going to put the reality is 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.260
 that we are complaining that 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:20.080
 the boys eat vegetables with vegetables 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:22.360
 but you also have to admit that even 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.550
 I was not here to buy the wash 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.750
 clean them take out the leaves and also the 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:28.300
 I'm with big as vegetables because 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.010
 we make ourselves so it's part of 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.590
 the two parts of putting the batteries 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:36.070
 So with hard soap 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:38.799
 well now we have little ears and we have 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:42.969
 the chick with this we're fine let's go 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:44.890
 here we have our egg ready 

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:47.319
 to use a touch of olive oil 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:51.280
 remember that olive can not be heated 

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:52.840
 a lot because it does not start raising 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.579
 temperatures and it's not good for the 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.100
 olive oil as you lose a 

00:01:54.579 --> 00:02:00.549
 lots of flavor properties and now 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:02.229
 I put the onion on it, I start with a 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:05.560
 little leek with the onions are 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:07.950
 cousins â€‹â€‹and placed the chicken and now I'm going 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:11.349
 to incorporate everything else the peas 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:14.500
 It's like I put everything together and I 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:17.650
 I let the aubergines cook 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:21.090
 carrot all the vegetables you pass 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.090
 I fought with everyone 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:28.150
 from josean here we put a little bit of 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.410
 salt and wine a lot of cooking yes good at 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.240
 what I'm going to do is the following to not 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.610
 get me down more than I do not want them so 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:36.769
 I'll pay them off and I'll let 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:38.770
 continue cooking with the steam 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:40.860
 all right 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:40.860
 i 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:48.560
 this is going to make tortillas flour 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:53.180
 common and copper after 40 purity we are going to 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:55.750
 despite we have 300 of shore I feel like 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.750
 country flour 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.030
 late 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
 Four. Five 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:11.690
 789 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:17.790
 it is corn flour common flour oil 

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:19.709
 salt and water enough flour 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:23.609
 of corn is blamed for kneading is going 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:25.079
 taking with the hand up we're going to 

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:27.150
 As we are taking, let's go adding 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:29.819
 more water that has to be lukewarm 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:32.489
 graph of the mass you do not have a mass 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:35.370
 very chic lenny very hard a mass that 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:37.680
 can knead but remain whole if 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:40.469
 you do not go to the hand that is detached 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.360
 so like this guy so this garment 

00:03:40.469 --> 00:03:45.360
 the knocking 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.360
 Y 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:54.770
 I love 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:01.800
 although the dough I like the dough is very 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:04.160
 easy is the idea that we do so more or 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:06.510
 less than this real size 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:08.950
 the little balls 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:11.430
 Y 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:11.430
 from the size 

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:16.030
 I put vegetable spray 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:22.920
 from both sides crushes the mass one of the 

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:25.240
 another and I try to cover all the 

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:29.370
 tortilla 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.370
 and now what I do in the mountains 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:33.930
 the horn 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:50.340
 and more 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.569
 there is a very important secret that is the 

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:56.430
 just where I have to take the 

00:04:54.569 --> 00:04:59.759
 helmet says that always as long as 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:01.439
 simple but I want to leave a lot of eye is 

00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:04.020
 that he still did not catch it too much if 

00:05:01.439 --> 00:05:06.530
 It leaves a lot of crispy and leaves you 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:11.300
 little I was half soft has to be 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:11.300
 realizing what wave 

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:24.480
 the idea is that if I put all the 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:24.480
 route 

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:32.440
 yes 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:40.450
 Y 

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:40.450
 two 

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:47.990
 the extreme the hot option 

00:05:51.389 --> 00:05:56.289
 here we have all the options and also 

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:59.080
 with what you usually eat is with a little 

00:05:56.289 --> 00:06:01.520
 of cheese that you cheer 

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:03.650
 the options we put a little bit more 

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:06.620
 a little bit of tartara chili sauce 

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:09.620
 hot spicy stuffing 

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:11.840
 cold stuffing with whatever you want this 

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:13.280
 it is barbarian he only commented 8 without 

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:15.560
 solution in the cole I know what more of the 

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:17.570
 Cole apart he is for everything 

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:19.680
 They can put you at ease and piacere of 

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:21.830
 each 

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:21.830
 i 

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:25.250
