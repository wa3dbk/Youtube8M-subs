been<00:04:06.750> inspired<00:04:07.230> by<00:04:07.349> his<00:04:07.560> success<00:04:08.010> which<00:04:08.819> is

00:04:08.839 --> 00:04:08.849 
been inspired by his success which is

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:10.970 
been inspired by his success which is
great<00:04:09.150> news<00:04:09.180> for<00:04:09.390> Colin<00:04:09.989> and<00:04:10.140> not<00:04:10.709> just

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
great news for Colin and not just

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.910 
great news for Colin and not just
because<00:04:11.190> it<00:04:11.310> means<00:04:11.430> more<00:04:11.700> potential<00:04:12.030> clients

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:12.920 
because it means more potential clients

because it means more potential clients
Colin<00:04:13.920> thinks<00:04:14.160> that<00:04:14.310> bringing<00:04:14.549> farming<00:04:14.910> to<00:04:15.030> a

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
Colin thinks that bringing farming to a

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.689 
Colin thinks that bringing farming to a
super<00:04:15.599> local<00:04:15.780> level<00:04:16.320> plays<00:04:16.829> a<00:04:16.859> small<00:04:17.250> but

00:04:17.689 --> 00:04:17.699 
super local level plays a small but

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:19.819 
super local level plays a small but
important<00:04:18.209> role<00:04:18.269> in<00:04:18.690> making<00:04:19.139> agriculture

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:19.829 
important role in making agriculture

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:22.189 
important role in making agriculture
more<00:04:20.039> sustainable<00:04:20.669> I<00:04:20.970> hope<00:04:21.359> what<00:04:21.630> we're<00:04:21.810> doing

00:04:22.189 --> 00:04:22.199 
more sustainable I hope what we're doing

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:25.640 
more sustainable I hope what we're doing
is<00:04:22.350> part<00:04:22.979> of<00:04:23.130> that<00:04:23.310> process<00:04:23.960> making<00:04:24.960> it<00:04:25.139> easier

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
is part of that process making it easier

for<00:04:25.770> people<00:04:25.830> to<00:04:25.949> conceptualize<00:04:26.580> what<00:04:26.610> it<00:04:27.000> is

to be a farmer and why we need to have

to be a farmer and why we need to have
them<00:04:29.160> on<00:04:29.610> why<00:04:29.789> they<00:04:29.940> should<00:04:30.090> be<00:04:30.180> part<00:04:30.810> of<00:04:31.110> the

you know maybe they're more likely to
