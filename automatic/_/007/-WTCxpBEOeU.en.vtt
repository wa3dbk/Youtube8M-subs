 to eat in Cannes and we will 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.650
 start right away by taking care of 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.689
 all our vegetables we will no longer be 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.340
 expensive take your eggplants cut the 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.989
 peduncle cut a small slice 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.480
 then can you use a base 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.250
 for better stability and makes 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.370
 thick slices of 20 cm in the 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:44.100
 length and then drop them in a 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.530
 dish with coarse salt to make them 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.989
 disgorge to have a quarter of an hour I 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.850
 come and ask for seeds of tomatoes and 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.770
 we just stay now and the 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.210
 rough crush the occupants 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.890
 garlic cloves that I have the 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.550
 germs and buying them with a small 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.440
 paring knife 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.670
 we will then take care of the parsley I 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.530
 will show you a little technique 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.510
 to leaf out 1 bunch of parsley you 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.369
 Take doubled like that and we sense a 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.409
 knife blade simply for the 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.140
 leaves and very few stems living 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.909
 will then suffice your groups while under the 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.799
 hand with orange knife blade in 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.100
 your fingers buy you or the most 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:19.860
 finely possible 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:21.750
 and that's it and finally the name chiseled 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.460
 attention big technique you cut 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.790
 in half you lay on the cut part 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:29.729
 made incisions during the game 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:33.240
 below that side then 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:36.689
 horizontally and orange are your 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:39.180
 fingers you cut gently burr 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:41.220
 complicated 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.810
 I just wiped one every 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.790
 eggplant slices simply from 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.010
 absorbent paper and we'll go the 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.570
 to brown in a pan with 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.220
 olive oil for one to two 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.660
 minutes and that's an aubergine d'auray 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.580
 not cooked because they will cook 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:55.500
 in the soul or his card it's time to 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.810
 take care of the meat on the plane of 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.460
 cooking I take you with me in a 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.200
 casserole with 2 tablespoons of oil 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.420
 of hot olive make color 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.580
 the lamb h and with some salt during 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.440
 five minutes without adding too much 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.750
 the chopped onion and let it come back 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.009
 for three four minutes 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.250
 deglaze with the white wine and leave 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.250
 reduce 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.750
 add the garlic the tomatoes and the parsley 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.790
 dirty close the lid and leave 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.840
 simmer 30 to 35 minutes, however, 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.720
 plagiant simmering 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.130
 we will prepare bechamel melt 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.050
 butter in a saucepan 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.850
 it could include flour and 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.040
 mix well, cook over low heat 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.810
 for a minute before pouring the 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.400
 milk while lending for me I use 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.780
 whole milk to make my bechamel 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.730
 but you can use half milk 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.620
 skim see see you writing it but I find 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.330
 it definitely gets more and more cornered whole 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.930
 and here we see that the cream is 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:49.769
 a train to thicken a little salt a 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:52.950
 little pepper and we only have 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:54.390
 to train your moussaka here we are 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.130
 back on the betrayed plane I'm in 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.660
 train to finish generously oiling 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:00.900
 the gratin dish that I chose for 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:02.100
 this fabulous us that because I 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.190
 also preheat the oven to 180 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:07.650
 degrees it goes for the assembly you 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.540
 line the bottom of the dish with a layer 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.390
 de vergy is taking its course and the 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.260
 eggplant a third of the meat 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:15.000
 so it's not cake at all 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.519
 I love it that even a little crack in 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.900
 play a week of a small bed since 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:22.500
 long time 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:25.560
 rebelote gives a layer of eggplant to 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:28.140
 again she pulls meat on 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.750
 ends with the last aubergines and 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:35.890
 the last two years and you 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:38.530
 come and do everything with bechamel 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:40.810
 always so optional about pop 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:43.300
 a little bit of gables bread that got me a 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:46.360
 little croquembouche ours and nantes a 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:48.730

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:50.580
 recipe I indicated 80 g after if you 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:54.130

 do not hesitate and hop in the oven for 30 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:57.880
 minutes

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:01.660
 moussa because I propose you to draw up the 

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:02.920
 covered while I prepare a 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:05.950
 little salad dressing for this beautiful 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:09.180
 salad and we will feast on soon
