00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.830
 very good and welcome to a new 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:17.360
 video of the online bonsai school is 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:18.770
 a short video we make many videos 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:21.020
 but we are still recomposing a 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:23.450
 little of what has been accumulated for me 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.509
 abandon my responsibilities and go to 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:29.080
 madrid of parranda our turn 

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:31.839
 then today I will explain the 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:35.059
 punctured that is normally understood 

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:36.230
 wrongly it is understood that the pricked 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:37.970
 it is something that has to be done to the tree 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.489
 in general but this time we are going to 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:43.309
 do something much more selective let's 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:45.589
 choose the areas that we want to click 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:47.119
 to detract from this will be in all 

00:00:45.589 --> 00:00:48.680
 in nature it will be everywhere 

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:50.089
 normally tree growths 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.409
 they are apical they have all the vigor 

00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:53.119
 the strength at the apex to get more 

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:56.000
 up and get the maximum information 

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:58.549
 possible and in the case of hedges like 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.470
 we have spoken many times of the villages 

00:00:58.549 --> 00:01:02.930
 for example the growth is lateral 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:05.720
 because it tends to expand towards 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:08.450
 sides then this is a Chinese elm 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.950
 defaul is super and growth 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.680
 obviously it has bitten and if we look 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:15.230
 in this tree 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.240
 it has a lot of rotation for the most part 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:20.500
 high and for the lowest part is a 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:23.750
 little more stopped if I do not intervene 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:26.270
 being a miniaturization of a tree 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.800
 if I do not intervene the tree would grow 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.630
 just up and this part is 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.310
 would weaken then this is where the 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.550
 bonsai is they have to intervene and 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:37.140
 put hand or scissors in this case 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.520
 trimming and weakening weakening 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.590
 always in a good way because what 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.500
 we do is divide the vigor weakening 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:46.380
 the strongest part to invigorate the 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.650
 weaker part then what I'm going to 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.420
 do 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:50.790
 apart is that this tree I want to do it 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:54.560
 a little bit wider because it 's though 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:57.040
 it's perfect height is a very good 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.470
 It's very good 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.510
 It is very trimmed by the sides and 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.520
 I want to make it a little bit wider 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:05.830
 little more fallen and a little wider 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.050
 more naturalistic within the perception 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.810
 of the traditional Japanese school 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.820
 so I'm going to do it, it's like 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.770
 height that you have is the correct what 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:16.380
 I'm going to excuse me, I have to see 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:19.700
 I 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:23.120
 is the stepped 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:25.730
 on the high side 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:29.090
 forget about those mathematical rules of 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:32.030
 you have to leave two pairs of leaves or a 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:35.200
 couple of leaves or I do not know how many there are 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.800
 to cut what we have left and points 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.630
 everything else 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.090
 is also who stops in this the most 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.430
 on the fly 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.050
 there we are cutting little by cutting a 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.640
 bit 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:47.970
 you see here these long protected 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.680
 that come out 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.610
 let's try not to cut any 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:55.260
 popcorn to do it with care of 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:57.960
 cut between leaves and leaves although this 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:01.400
 variety of elm has the training very 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:03.620
 cortitos and 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.920
 and it makes it difficult but good 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:09.079
 It also helps us to compact the foliage 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:12.379
 very much, look, I'm getting to the 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:14.960
 part a little lower I do not want to leave 

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:17.580
 a lot of me when I 'm losing scissors 

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:20.420
 I have a vocation as a hairdresser 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:20.420
 in sight is 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:25.510
 we'll see 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:27.580
 we are going to 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.019
 what we are doing there is for 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:32.079
 give it some growth in the area 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:33.670
 high and now all that energy that has 

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:35.920
 the tree that is something is very vigorous 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:40.170
 is going to redistribute to the most parties 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:42.130
 low in the general norm then in the 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:44.720
 rule 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:46.910
 what we do is reinvigorate 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.610
 that lower part and in my case in 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:50.230
 concrete 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:51.920
 what I want to achieve is to lengthen a 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.380
 little these glasses 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:56.690
 this part of here if you notice 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:59.810
 visit a few leaves but less 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:02.020
 much less than above you see for the part 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:05.120
 higher we remove more this is very 

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:07.060
 evident above all in the pines the 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:10.459
 pines have a very strong growth 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:12.140
 apical and then in the low areas they go 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:13.489
 pulling branches directly, that is, it is not 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:15.380
 that weakens is that they are going 

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:18.139
 killing to keep growing towards 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:21.290
 up they are sacrificing the branches more 

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:24.520
 low to go up and getting 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:28.250
 the greatest amount of sun rays 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:31.910
 possible because that's how they do best 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:33.710
 photosynthesis and that's the life of the tree 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:37.610
 notice that many times the forests 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:40.669
 tropical competition for 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:44.030
 the sun's rays is brutal is a 

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:45.860
 battle in which our 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:47.509
 dear ficus are the champions of the 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:51.600
 champions are the smartest of all 

00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:54.300
 because instead of growing from the ground 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:57.000
 what they do is when a little bird 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:59.310
 deposit a seed in it in the cup 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.380
 a very tall very large tree 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:02.760
 the CICU germinates up and will throw 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:04.290
 perform to the ground when it reaches the 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:06.890
 soil strangled admission length what 

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:10.080
 bad milk strangles the host tree 

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:11.730
 making the vanian famous vain by 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:14.510
 that in many Latin American countries will 

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:14.510
 they call mata sticks 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:20.099
 well let's remove some little boats 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:24.240
 long we have to have around here be 

00:05:20.099 --> 00:05:26.310
 painted is not at all a painted 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:30.790
 It is not a traditional painted 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:34.050
 training space formation 

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:34.050
 this is a painted 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:39.130
 selective 

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:42.240
 and redistribute the strength of our 

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:42.240
 piece of bonsai 

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.700
 and this must be done 

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:53.389
 good, well, it's already 

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:56.180
 it is already there is already look then this 

00:05:53.389 --> 00:05:57.620
 is going to be the result of moment of 

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:59.540
 our bonsai you see that up here 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:00.889
 he is pricked, many rays come in 

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:02.090
 sun as I drop the good tree 

00:06:00.889 --> 00:06:05.950
 because it's author pots 

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:05.950
 meredith or erin potter and for this something 

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:10.500
 you see this part here is very good very 

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:12.750
 thought this part is a little more 

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:14.520
 disheveled more messy but is that 

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:16.830
 Now what we are going to do is stop the 

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:18.090
 apical growth and further develop the 

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:19.740
 tree by the sides that I want 

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:21.840
 make it a little wider 

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:23.460
 you know that I have a problem with the 

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:25.800
 theme of heights I like those 

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:27.389
 very compact and very open trees 

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:28.810
 powerful is just what makes me a ficus 

00:06:27.389 --> 00:06:31.120
 Water 

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:32.620
 sometimes but then it is already 

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:35.680
 perfect let's take this half of 

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:37.690
 here was guitar from here like that for 

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:39.550
 that between the sun very well here 

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:42.730
 inside it is very important that between the 

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:44.889
 sun ladies gentlemen more on everything more 

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:47.050
 when we have a problem like in cádiz 

00:06:44.889 --> 00:06:49.450
 with the heat that does right now that is 

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:51.520
 unbearable and a very humid heat 

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:53.080
 we need the air to run well 

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:55.810
 within the branch of the network avoid the 

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:57.340
 appearance of mushrooms, well, it's already 

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:59.200
 it's already my god that I like this tree 

00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:01.280
 that I like the face that I like this 

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:03.800
 tree 

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:07.970
 you are already in a while we will return 

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:09.380
 to resume this work and we will 

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:11.690
 this part of here surely 

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:13.520
 being called that I come from an autumn that 

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:16.280
 pull here that you have from here and I'm going to 

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:20.090
 redesign what to leave it equally high 

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:22.310
 but a lot wider and a little bit 

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:24.560
 fall if you liked this video by 

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:26.060
 course and I did not like it I loved it 

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:27.320
 Well then, and he's delighted, sorry 

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:29.090
 thanks because regions 

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:31.460

 after bonsai a hug and until the 

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.780
 next video
