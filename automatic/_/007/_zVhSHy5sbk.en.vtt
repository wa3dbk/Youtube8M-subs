00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.990
 if you are planning a drawing tablet 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.060
 to purchase then it is good to van 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.919
 to know in advance which model is best 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.179
 meets your needs 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.010
 someone who is professional for example 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.380
 graphic work has done extensive 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.900
 specifications than someone who 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.270
 occasionally edited a photo and 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.250
 photo shop in this video I will be the 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.900
 different usage situations 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:25.170
 treat on the basis of three wacom 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:28.980
 draw tablet models namely the intuos 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.570
 the intuos pro and also the cintiq 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.369
 to consider it might fire 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.200
 or not to purchase a drawing tablet 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.600
 and would you like to know the benefits 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.730
 find it after the biggest advantage 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.040
 I myself, for example, take photos a lot 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.879
 can edit more accurately with a character 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.469
 tablet 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.660
 relative to a mouse and a pelvis 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.820
 all about reducing one 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.289
 portrait or selecting an object 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.149
 in your photo 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.890
 if you draw or paint a lot then it is 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.480
 the use of a drawing tablet is also one 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.120
 much more realistic 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.520
 totally because the pen is also pressure sensitive 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.660
 and that means that brush stroke 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.250
 also gets fatter 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.379
 for example, if you exert more pressure 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.180
 your pen to note how well good 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.220
 much more accurate you with a sign 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.150
 tablet proceeded towards 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.830
 a mouse 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.780
 I always say but first try you 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.259
 write name in photoshop with a 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.030
 mouse and then with the pen of your character 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.259
 tablet there is really a big one 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.210
 Difference in 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.500
 well i will show it first with the 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.869
 mouse 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.909
 well i will start with the first 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.310
 letters of my name 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.799
 I still apologize for that 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.150
 elementary school handwriting that I never have 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.280
 unlearned 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.540
 well you do n't really see the looks 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.490
 thundering out is all a bit 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.170
 jerky not really nice flowing 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.840
 then I'll show it now with a 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.310
 drawing tablet 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.250
 First of all, that really goes a long way 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.810
 easier and it is also a lot 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.000
 smoother 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.490
 so there really is a big one there 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.130
 difference in that also has so that one 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.719
 sign tablet rsi is enlightening and that 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.780
 means that you will not be bothered by it 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:02.399
 stiff fingers or a mouse arm in front 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.649
 those who want a hobby pictures 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:07.950
 edit or draw sketchily then 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:09.330
 the wacom intro is certainly ideal 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.619
 he just works perfectly with 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.000
 for example, programs such as adobe 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:15.040
 photoshop or sketchbook pro 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.560
 has a pressure sensitive pen so that you too 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.380
 can work very accurately 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.700
 Some models also feature 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:24.220
 multi-touch that means you have the 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.140
 drawing tablet can operate with your fingers 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:29.680
 for example, you can easily 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:33.040
 zoom in or scroll through your photo 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:35.680
 And it is true that this drawing tablet 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:38.950
 has 4 shortcuts these are 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.870
 at the top and these also promote 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.140
 certainly your workflow 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:46.209
 for example if you have a photo attached to it 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:48.880
 retouch to this drawing tablet 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:51.430
 is also really ideal for people who have RSI 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:54.400
 have complaints then yes this is just one 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:56.560
 great solution is a small variant 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.800
 so this is therefore also a medium 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:02.230
 version and it has an a5 format to 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:04.510
 someone who grows fast in editing 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.320
 of photos and real professional side 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.480
 goes on 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:09.340
 yes then this drawing tablet might be after 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.940
 not really interesting for one or two years 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.620
 more 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.209
 and advises you to look for the 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.760
 intuos pro 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:17.830
 the more advanced into is pro is real 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.220
 a drawing tablet ideal for the 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:21.340
 graphic professionals or yes 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.350
 designer 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.480
 He has all the functions of the intro 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:27.730
 but he really goes one step further 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:30.700
 so get the grip ' pen for example 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:33.040
 and this pen is not just busy but 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:35.049
 also tilt sensitive and that means 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.820
 that the shape of your scholarship changes 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:38.980
 depending on how you tilt the pen and that 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:40.870
 gives a really different effect can also 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.010
 just show me I have a photo here 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.709
 photoshop opened 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.840
 I now hold the pen on my drawing tablet 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:48.519
 also sees my brush and like here 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.860
 you can now start drawing and i go 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:53.799
 tilt my pen then you will see 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:57.370
 that the brush also tilts and so on 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:59.829
 So get a different effect in your strip 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:02.049
 He can also add other pens to this sign 

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:03.400
 For example, tablet pairing the wacom 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:06.370
 pro pen 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.959
 this is slightly more balanced acids 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:09.790
 fits nicely in the hand and therefore 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:12.400
 maybe nicer to work with 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:13.989
 by professionals that means tablet 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.700
 is therefore multi-touch so you can 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:17.919
 easily with your fingers in or 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.760
 You can also zoom through your photo 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:20.799
 scroll 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:22.810
 you can set all of this to your liking 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:24.460
 what you can set to your liking are 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:26.410
 all expresskeys here on the 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:29.020
 sides well there you can for example 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:31.630
 put it all under shortcuts 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:33.730
 so you can work much faster 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:35.380
 Go better tech your workflow if you get here 

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:37.660
 can work well with it 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:40.000
 he also has a multifunctional touch 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:42.250
 Then ring with they can start ring you whole 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.990
 easy to zoom in or out like you 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:46.900
 and for example too 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:47.920
 increase your brush size or yes 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.990
 shrink 

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:52.270
 so when you put your finger over it 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:54.640
 moves and you can go all the way to this 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:56.530
 set yourself to the drawing tablet 

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:58.540

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:04.960
 long session and it is available in 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:07.120
 a small medium and large version 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:09.070
 this is the medium version by the way 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:10.420
 light version has about an a4 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:12.340
 format 

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:14.860

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:18.880
 his special drawing tablet 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:20.590
 because the screen is in the tablet itself 

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:24.070
 processed and so combine the 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:26.170
 Advantages of an HD LCD display with it 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:28.480

 actually a bit like being on paper 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:48.190
