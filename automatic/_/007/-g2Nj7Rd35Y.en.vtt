00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:12.390
 Today we drive the fifth generation 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.950
 of the subaru outback 

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:16.980
 the car is driven by one 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.780
 two-liter boxer diesel engine with 150 hp 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.460
 the power transmission takes place via a 

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.840
 so-called lineartronic gearbox that 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.820
 means we talk about a stepless 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.380
 automatic thanks to the permanent 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.000
 four-wheel drive feels the vehicle 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.650
 course on gravel roads or ice 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.160
 wet street and here too 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.160
 home 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.079
 the four-wheel drive crossover combined with 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.690
 walking his ground is the leading animal 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.880
 the subaru meute greater ground clearance 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.070
 high trailer loads ago 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.870
 alone the offroader or towing vehicle 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.860
 clichÃ© wants subaru with the outback 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.190
 do not operate 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.500
 the manufacturer attaches importance to comfort and 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.840
 driving safety around as many buyers 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.489
 to address 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:56.280
 the special thing about our test vehicle 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:59.100
 the outback 2 liter diesel comfort navi 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:02.280
 cvt is undoubtedly a stepless one 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.289
 automatic transmission lineartronic it is 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.810
 worldwide the first time that a boxer 

00:01:04.289 --> 00:01:09.719
 diesel with a cvt gear crosses 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.639
 the engine was running while accelerating 

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:13.259
 always in the highest performance the 

00:01:11.639 --> 00:01:15.499
 speed controls the lineartronic 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:17.549
 through the appropriate translation 

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:20.340
 in total, the self-igniter is involved 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.079
 its maximum 350 newton meters on us 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.499
 a very solid though right 

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:27.929
 pithy impression its 150 ps the the 

00:01:25.499 --> 00:01:29.450
 combo in 9 7 seconds on pace 100 

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:30.599
 bring every driving situation 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.569
 grown 

00:01:30.599 --> 00:01:36.179
 the top speed is 195 

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:38.939
 km h and with the combined consumption 

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:41.279
 Of 6.3 liters, one can quite live 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.659
 a subaru is not a vehicle for 

00:01:41.279 --> 00:01:44.999
 everyone is doing the current 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.439
 outback no difference the chassis eg 

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:48.090
 is very tight tuned what 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.709
 fast cornering very pleasant 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.939
 and certainly of advantage if 

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:52.950
 you through a gondola driving car 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.149
 does not hit bad though 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.289
 They stretch long on the highway 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.450
 are on the way because they are clear 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:58.829
 to miss comfort 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.909
 pleasantly direct presents itself against it 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:02.310
 the steering 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.020
 she always provides feedback on the 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.090
 Ride under the wheels 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.799
 so that the allradler can also 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.750
 swift and very precise about 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:12.390
 lead gravel roads or forest roads 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:15.959
 here is the unmistakable in his 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.879
 metier is the interior of the outback 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:20.280
 very clean processed though he 

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:23.040
 Overall rather functional than living room 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.660
 similar to some switches like the 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.090
 electronic parking brake were 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.890
 ergonomic positioned the 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.840
 seating position including the 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.090
 Side seating is very good 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.989
 Driver and passenger have plenty 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:38.640
 This also applies to the fund 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:40.860
 practically the position of the lever is too 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.579
 fold down the back seat on the outside 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:47.549
 the seats without contortions will be out 

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:51.030
 526 liter ratz fatz 1726 liter 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:53.190
 load volumes were at most too loud 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:56.069
 almost 500 kilos and one unchecked 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.900
 trailer load of 750 kilos is recommended 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:00.540
 the subaru is more impressive 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.310
 Master of the current subaru outback 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.470
 offers everything a diehard subaru 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.420
 Drivers expect the vehicle is extreme 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.310
 robust very off-road and has 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.720
 about permanent all-wheel drive the 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.180
 however, outback has its price 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.859
 the basic version is 37,000 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.419
 euro the test vehicle driven by us 

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:19.790
 with automatic transmission and boxer engine 

00:03:15.419 --> 00:03:19.790
 is over 46,000
