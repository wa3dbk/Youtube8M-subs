00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:08.540
 very good week very well 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:25.350
 abarrote beer we caught the class 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.180
 middle- high the middle class was not the 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.990
 beer and the popular sectors 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:35.120
 It cost 7 to the brewers one tail 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.120
 huge there was a giant tail 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:53.010
 there were all the chalets of the 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:56.930
 revolution the revolution does too 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.930
 party to the opposition people 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:03.890
 buy a beer in 2001 and 700 more 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.060
 cheap 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.590
 would we say that not for the 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.460
 control that follow that kind of momentum 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:13.800
 events to young creators and all 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.080
 others in quality much better than the 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.360
 that scratched beer that she's going to 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.750
 place some culturally if that 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:24.540
 I know several brands that are 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:26.729
 doing interesting things at a non- level 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.010
 nothing more beer but also 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.540
 food and all this but it's more the 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:32.490
 lack of truth there is or some criticism 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:36.070
 constructive that I do is this fair of 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:38.860
 the beer was directed to a sector 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:42.490
 of the society that we respect 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:45.140
 which is the middle class but it's already a 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:47.960
 reflection on this 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.250
 let's set aside the case of the fair the 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.780
 beer 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.659
 look if someone who has left 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.149
 strengthened 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:58.569
 in this revolution Ricardo is the class 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:02:00.060
 average with credits with assignment of 

00:01:58.569 --> 00:02:05.220
 vehicles 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:07.740
 with allocation of housing with 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:10.470
 different opportunities with credits in 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.660
 banks both public banking and 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.000
 private banking 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.320
 I know more than one that banking 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.490
 private and public banking has given 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:21.810
 opposition credits I know more than 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:24.030
 He went to Ireland asking for dollars 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.460
 because already cool and are opponents likewise 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:30.580
 apart from those who found he heard him 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:33.520
 I took out study but look at this 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:36.560
 I am not against and I am discriminating 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:39.560
 to nobody why 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.660
 suddenly the government will help them or anything 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.630
 of this on the contrary is a government 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:46.790
 of welcome inclusion but something very 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:49.790
 important that I say by way of 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.660
 reflection and to generate debate with 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.040
 the bases with these 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:56.620
 the middle class 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:03:00.930
 a large sector of the middle class 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.930
 Gentlemen never vote for this revolution 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:07.420
 nor does he want to rule out that they sell them 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.069
 we do not believe in a middle class that 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.590
 we are building with our 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:13.780
 universities from the unefa from the 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:16.269
 Bolivarian with those kids that come 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:19.390
 so getting up were intellectuals who 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:20.980
 that's why group of chamo are the 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.319
 kids that are precisely going to give 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:26.530
 continuity to this revolution because 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:29.349
 this middle class we have not to mention 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.050
 everything is well deviated and they have a 

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:32.880
 mental mound 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:35.250
 what do those who use the middle class say 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:39.120
 europe be chavistas and my social circle 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:41.070
 will not let me say the Chavista 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.560
 the catholic university andres bello or 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:45.240
 the initial santamarÃ­a the chamos him 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.730
 snore and I know more we fight that is 

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:50.760
 chavista in me was sent as I do if my 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:52.920
 social circle that comes from a stratum 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.990
 social above the middle I'm here 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.600
 for a scholarship they are giving me all 

00:03:54.990 --> 00:04:01.200
 the irons I but then we see by 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:02.970
 a side that the government gives credits to 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:06.030
 a business sector is given the 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:08.430
 business amulet and then it will be that 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:10.410
 we will continue to feed this 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:13.440
 type of situations 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:15.840
 it is a constructive criticism for the 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:18.810
 debate the truth in europe from the base 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:22.019
 the militant base lover of all that 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:24.170
 that is good merely in it is not 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:27.890
 waiting for the coconut fair 

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:27.890
 the fair the coconut 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:33.140
 well the dyer's fair today the base 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:36.410
 common waiting for the fair the star 

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:36.410
 crashed too 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:45.390
 the moringa what happens is that we continue 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:48.060
 driving precisely the fair of 

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:53.160
 tafil the signal for the people of the class 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:55.940
 average that is now believed say I cycles 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:58.010
 and half the care has died 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:59.720
 they got the petit bourgeois but 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:01.640
 three tables 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:03.890
 but something important things are happening 

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:07.790
 here and there we go with the first 

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:10.550
 video of the night said the mature the dawn 

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:12.890
 must be the army of peace of the 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:14.420
 love life of the revolution and the 

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:17.090
 embrace of all this revolution is 

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:18.800
 inclusion was not bothered by the units 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:21.190
 constructive for those who made the 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:21.190
 event
