hay and stuff so I'm gonna show you how
to<00:00:37.860> do<00:00:37.980> that<00:00:38.100> and<00:00:38.340> there's<00:00:38.520> three<00:00:39.090> ways<00:00:39.829> just

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
to do that and there's three ways just

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.350 
to do that and there's three ways just
like<00:00:40.920> being<00:00:41.280> your<00:00:41.430> guinea<00:00:41.520> pig's<00:00:41.790> cage<00:00:41.910> which

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
like being your guinea pig's cage which

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.990 
like being your guinea pig's cage which
the<00:00:43.200> three<00:00:43.379> ways<00:00:43.559> are<00:00:43.890> actually<00:00:44.550> taking<00:00:44.910> the

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
the three ways are actually taking the

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.330 
the three ways are actually taking the
police<00:00:45.300> and<00:00:46.140> bundling<00:00:46.649> it<00:00:46.739> up<00:00:46.829> and<00:00:47.070> then<00:00:47.160> going

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
police and bundling it up and then going

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.760 
police and bundling it up and then going
outside<00:00:48.000> and<00:00:48.390> shaking<00:00:48.719> it<00:00:48.809> out<00:00:48.899> or<00:00:49.170> going<00:00:49.530> into

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
outside and shaking it out or going into

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.029 
outside and shaking it out or going into
like<00:00:49.890> a<00:00:49.920> huge<00:00:50.190> dumpster<00:00:50.989> but<00:00:51.989> I<00:00:52.350> tend<00:00:52.800> to<00:00:52.920> not

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
like a huge dumpster but I tend to not

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.010 
like a huge dumpster but I tend to not
do<00:00:53.460> that<00:00:53.670> because<00:00:53.940> it's<00:00:54.360> just<00:00:54.420> sort<00:00:54.719> of<00:00:54.750> a

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
do that because it's just sort of a

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.900 
do that because it's just sort of a
castle<00:00:55.430> so<00:00:57.320> the<00:00:58.320> way<00:00:58.649> that<00:00:58.680> I<00:00:58.980> usually<00:00:59.399> do<00:00:59.760> it

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
castle so the way that I usually do it

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.439 
castle so the way that I usually do it
is<00:01:00.120> taking<00:01:00.989> this<00:01:01.109> brush<00:01:01.800> and<00:01:02.129> an<00:01:03.120> ultimate

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
is taking this brush and an ultimate

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.340 
is taking this brush and an ultimate
brush<00:01:03.809> but<00:01:04.049> get<00:01:04.710> worse<00:01:04.860> so<00:01:05.280> I<00:01:05.939> take<00:01:06.840> this<00:01:06.960> giant

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
brush but get worse so I take this giant

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.630 
brush but get worse so I take this giant
paint<00:01:07.530> brush<00:01:07.710> in<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:07.979> neck<00:01:08.100> and<00:01:08.250> dustpan<00:01:08.610> and

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
paint brush in the neck and dustpan and

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.010 
paint brush in the neck and dustpan and
then<00:01:08.880> I<00:01:08.909> just<00:01:09.090> kind<00:01:09.299> of<00:01:09.330> look<00:01:09.510> brush<00:01:09.780> it<00:01:09.900> in

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
then I just kind of look brush it in

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.649 
then I just kind of look brush it in
like<00:01:10.229> how<00:01:10.380> you'd<00:01:10.560> normally<00:01:11.520> clean<00:01:12.270> up<00:01:12.390> stuff

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
like how you'd normally clean up stuff

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.560 
like how you'd normally clean up stuff
with<00:01:12.689> a<00:01:12.900> brush<00:01:13.170> a<00:01:13.200> dustpan<00:01:13.560> and<00:01:14.390> there's<00:01:15.390> also

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
with a brush a dustpan and there's also

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.080 
with a brush a dustpan and there's also
my<00:01:16.320> old<00:01:16.500> way<00:01:16.680> that<00:01:16.860> I<00:01:16.890> did<00:01:17.130> it<00:01:17.250> but<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.850> reason

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
my old way that I did it but the reason

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.820 
my old way that I did it but the reason
why<00:01:18.180> I<00:01:18.240> stopped<00:01:18.600> doing<00:01:18.990> it<00:01:19.200> was<00:01:19.320> because<00:01:19.560> this

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
why I stopped doing it was because this

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.630 
why I stopped doing it was because this
shovel<00:01:20.430> start<00:01:20.790> it<00:01:20.880> broke<00:01:21.060> a<00:01:21.090> little<00:01:21.390> bit<00:01:21.540> here

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 
shovel start it broke a little bit here

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.280 
shovel start it broke a little bit here
it's<00:01:23.640> good<00:01:23.909> for<00:01:24.090> like<00:01:24.119> small<00:01:24.630> spot<00:01:24.990> cleans

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
it's good for like small spot cleans

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.109 
it's good for like small spot cleans
there's<00:01:25.560> just<00:01:25.740> sort<00:01:26.070> of<00:01:26.220> small<00:01:26.630> thing<00:01:27.770> so

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:29.119 
there's just sort of small thing so

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:31.730 
there's just sort of small thing so
that's<00:01:30.119> why<00:01:30.360> I<00:01:30.390> just<00:01:30.540> got<00:01:30.630> started<00:01:31.290> doing<00:01:31.530> this

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
that's why I just got started doing this

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:32.450 
that's why I just got started doing this
instead

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
instead

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.370 
instead
but<00:01:33.030> this<00:01:33.780> is<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.530> same<00:01:34.740> thing<00:01:34.950> you<00:01:35.130> just<00:01:36.380> put

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
but this is the same thing you just put

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.840 
but this is the same thing you just put
it<00:01:37.470> in<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.650> bucket<00:01:39.409> there's<00:01:40.409> a<00:01:40.470> I<00:01:40.850> guess

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
it in the bucket there's a I guess

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.179 
it in the bucket there's a I guess
there's<00:01:42.060> some<00:01:42.180> another<00:01:42.360> might<00:01:42.600> too<00:01:42.840> but<00:01:43.259> it's

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
there's some another might too but it's

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:45.260 
there's some another might too but it's
pretty<00:01:44.369> much<00:01:44.490> just<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:44.909> same<00:01:45.090> thing

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
pretty much just the same thing

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.539 
pretty much just the same thing
something<00:01:45.659> else<00:01:45.780> I've<00:01:45.990> seen<00:01:46.020> like<00:01:46.920> people<00:01:47.310> use

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
something else I've seen like people use

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.350 
something else I've seen like people use
actual<00:01:48.540> like<00:01:48.689> litter<00:01:49.880> scooper<00:01:50.880> things<00:01:51.119> but

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
actual like litter scooper things but

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.460 
actual like litter scooper things but
the<00:01:51.479> holes<00:01:51.780> that<00:01:51.869> have<00:01:52.020> to<00:01:52.110> be<00:01:52.200> really<00:01:52.439> really

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
the holes that have to be really really

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.249 
the holes that have to be really really
small<00:01:52.890> or<00:01:53.280> else<00:01:53.759> like<00:01:53.970> the<00:01:54.119> little<00:01:54.360> poos<00:01:54.930> will

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
it's not that big a deal this is like a

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.039 
it's not that big a deal this is like a
way<00:03:05.130> that<00:03:05.340> I<00:03:05.370> really<00:03:05.790> like<00:03:05.970> to<00:03:06.000> store<00:03:06.480> my<00:03:06.630> hay

way that I really like to store my hay
it<00:03:07.260> just<00:03:07.799> works<00:03:08.130> really<00:03:08.340> well<00:03:08.519> we<00:03:09.510> just<00:03:09.720> had

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
it just works really well we just had

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.289 
it just works really well we just had
this<00:03:10.049> like<00:03:10.290> in<00:03:10.410> our<00:03:10.500> basement<00:03:10.920> and<00:03:11.220> I<00:03:11.549> decided

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:12.299 
this like in our basement and I decided

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:14.150 
this like in our basement and I decided
that<00:03:12.450> it<00:03:12.660> would<00:03:12.780> be<00:03:12.810> a<00:03:13.200> good<00:03:13.410> hammer<00:03:13.680> because

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
that it would be a good hammer because

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.190 
that it would be a good hammer because
she<00:03:14.790> can<00:03:14.910> fit<00:03:15.090> her<00:03:15.239> head<00:03:15.450> right<00:03:15.690> in<00:03:15.870> there<00:03:16.080> and

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
she can fit her head right in there and

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.229 
she can fit her head right in there and
then<00:03:16.350> get<00:03:16.709> all<00:03:16.830> the<00:03:16.950> food<00:03:17.100> and<00:03:17.310> stuff<00:03:17.549> for<00:03:18.180> the

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
then get all the food and stuff for the

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:21.229 
then get all the food and stuff for the
hay<00:03:18.480> I<00:03:18.799> just<00:03:19.799> think<00:03:19.950> it's<00:03:20.100> less<00:03:20.400> messy<00:03:20.850> than<00:03:20.880> a

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
hay I just think it's less messy than a

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:24.110 
hay I just think it's less messy than a
racks<00:03:21.660> because<00:03:22.620> my<00:03:23.070> old<00:03:23.250> hay<00:03:23.430> rack<00:03:23.640> you<00:03:23.850> stab

as<00:04:41.270> you<00:04:41.419> can<00:04:41.569> see<00:04:41.749> the<00:04:42.050> top<00:04:42.229> level<00:04:42.620> is<00:04:42.979> very<00:04:43.009> hey

00:04:49.779 --> 00:04:49.789 
kind of brush the hay towards the middle

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:52.480 
kind of brush the hay towards the middle
because<00:04:50.210> it<00:04:50.449> tends<00:04:50.839> to<00:04:50.960> collect<00:04:51.919> them<00:04:52.219> outer

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:52.490
