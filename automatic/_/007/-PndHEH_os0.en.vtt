hi<00:00:09.570> I'm<00:00:09.780> Ava<00:00:10.170> Cowan<00:00:10.559> and<00:00:10.679> today<00:00:11.490> I'm<00:00:11.730> going<00:00:12.000> to

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:12.200 
hi I'm Ava Cowan and today I'm going to

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.450 
hi I'm Ava Cowan and today I'm going to
walk<00:00:13.200> you<00:00:13.380> through<00:00:13.410> a<00:00:13.650> series<00:00:13.920> of<00:00:14.099> exercises

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
walk you through a series of exercises

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.630 
walk you through a series of exercises
which<00:00:15.210> today<00:00:15.630> is<00:00:15.690> back<00:00:16.020> the<00:00:17.010> first<00:00:17.250> one<00:00:17.520> is

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
which today is back the first one is

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.170 
which today is back the first one is
going<00:00:17.850> to<00:00:17.940> be<00:00:18.119> a<00:00:18.359> lat<00:00:19.199> pulldown<00:00:19.880> I'm<00:00:20.880> going<00:00:21.119> to

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
going to be a lat pulldown I'm going to

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.720 
going to be a lat pulldown I'm going to
do<00:00:21.449> this<00:00:21.600> one<00:00:21.810> because<00:00:21.930> it's<00:00:22.350> a<00:00:22.439> has<00:00:23.250> a<00:00:23.279> neutral

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
do this one because it's a has a neutral

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.820 
do this one because it's a has a neutral
grip<00:00:23.939> and<00:00:24.240> right<00:00:24.630> now<00:00:24.810> my<00:00:24.990> focus<00:00:25.199> is<00:00:25.529> on<00:00:25.560> my

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
grip and right now my focus is on my

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.339 
grip and right now my focus is on my
v-taper<00:00:26.220> so<00:00:26.820> this<00:00:26.970> really<00:00:27.359> engages<00:00:27.750> that<00:00:27.930> part

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
v-taper so this really engages that part

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.370 
v-taper so this really engages that part
of<00:00:28.439> the<00:00:28.500> muscle<00:00:28.890> the<00:00:29.460> lower<00:00:29.670> lats<00:00:29.970> and<00:00:30.359> so<00:00:30.900> I'm

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
of the muscle the lower lats and so I'm

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:52.820 
of the muscle the lower lats and so I'm
going<00:00:31.560> to<00:00:31.619> show

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:52.830 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:55.440 

my<00:00:53.830> next<00:00:54.280> exercise<00:00:54.760> is<00:00:55.000> going<00:00:55.180> to<00:00:55.270> be<00:00:55.360> a

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:55.450 
my next exercise is going to be a

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.890 
my next exercise is going to be a
straight<00:00:55.900> arm<00:00:56.050> pull<00:00:56.320> down<00:00:56.910> again<00:00:57.910> this<00:00:58.210> focal

00:00:58.890 --> 00:00:58.900 
straight arm pull down again this focal

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:02.549 
straight arm pull down again this focal
point<00:00:59.170> is<00:00:59.500> to<00:01:00.040> really<00:01:00.309> focus<00:01:00.820> on<00:01:01.210> just<00:01:01.630> the<00:01:01.780> lat

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:02.559 
point is to really focus on just the lat

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:05.160 
point is to really focus on just the lat
muscle<00:01:03.010> for<00:01:03.460> me<00:01:03.580> I<00:01:03.610> just<00:01:03.790> want<00:01:04.239> to<00:01:04.360> increase

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.170 
muscle for me I just want to increase

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.740 
muscle for me I just want to increase
the<00:01:05.379> nice<00:01:05.530> v-taper<00:01:06.010> and<00:01:06.880> not<00:01:07.030> necessarily

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:07.750 
the nice v-taper and not necessarily

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:09.750 
the nice v-taper and not necessarily
looking<00:01:08.200> for<00:01:08.260> depth<00:01:08.740> in<00:01:08.979> the<00:01:09.160> muscle<00:01:09.550> but

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:09.760 
looking for depth in the muscle but

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.660 
looking for depth in the muscle but
width<00:01:10.119> so<00:01:10.600> this<00:01:10.900> is<00:01:11.020> a<00:01:11.050> great<00:01:11.380> exercise<00:01:11.710> if<00:01:12.250> you

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:12.670 
width so this is a great exercise if you

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:14.820 
width so this is a great exercise if you
get<00:01:12.820> a<00:01:12.850> full<00:01:13.210> stretch<00:01:13.570> you'll<00:01:14.410> get<00:01:14.590> a<00:01:14.619> more

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:14.830 
get a full stretch you'll get a more

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:16.230 
get a full stretch you'll get a more
forceful<00:01:15.130> contraction

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
forceful contraction

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.240 
forceful contraction
therefore<00:01:16.780> using<00:01:17.140> a<00:01:17.229> muscle<00:01:17.410> the<00:01:17.650> most<00:01:17.890> so

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.250 
therefore using a muscle the most so

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:42.930 
therefore using a muscle the most so
this<00:01:18.280> is<00:01:18.460> a<00:01:18.490> great<00:01:18.850> exercise<00:01:41.610> stillman<00:01:42.610> expert

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:42.940 
this is a great exercise stillman expert

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:45.540 
this is a great exercise stillman expert
review<00:01:43.210> range<00:01:43.420> which<00:01:43.660> is<00:01:43.690> twelve<00:01:44.110> reps<00:01:44.350> and<00:01:45.130> I

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:45.550 
review range which is twelve reps and I

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:46.740 
review range which is twelve reps and I
really<00:01:45.850> don't<00:01:45.940> need<00:01:46.090> to<00:01:46.180> grow<00:01:46.360> in<00:01:46.570> that

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 
really don't need to grow in that

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.109 
really don't need to grow in that
particular<00:01:47.170> area<00:01:47.440> so<00:01:48.160> I'm<00:01:48.670> actually<00:01:48.789> going<00:01:49.060> to

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:49.119 
particular area so I'm actually going to

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:50.609 
particular area so I'm actually going to
lighten<00:01:49.420> it<00:01:49.450> up<00:01:49.539> a<00:01:49.690> little<00:01:49.810> bit<00:01:50.050> and<00:01:50.229> go<00:01:50.380> into

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:50.619 
lighten it up a little bit and go into

00:01:50.619 --> 00:02:16.880 
lighten it up a little bit and go into
like<00:01:50.830> fifteen<00:01:51.250> reps

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.650 

my<00:02:17.890> next<00:02:18.280> exercise<00:02:18.790> is<00:02:18.970> going<00:02:19.120> to<00:02:19.210> be<00:02:19.300> a<00:02:19.330> high

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
my next exercise is going to be a high

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.290 
my next exercise is going to be a high
cable<00:02:20.410> fully<00:02:20.890> row<00:02:21.160> it's<00:02:22.000> going<00:02:22.030> to<00:02:22.210> be

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
cable fully row it's going to be

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.750 
cable fully row it's going to be
lightweight<00:02:22.750> high<00:02:23.320> reps<00:02:23.620> I<00:02:24.010> still<00:02:24.550> want<00:02:24.730> to

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
lightweight high reps I still want to

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.880 
lightweight high reps I still want to
hit<00:02:24.910> that<00:02:25.090> middle<00:02:25.360> muscle<00:02:25.960> just<00:02:26.500> don't<00:02:26.740> want

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
hit that middle muscle just don't want

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:28.530 
hit that middle muscle just don't want
to<00:02:26.980> add<00:02:27.100> any<00:02:27.310> size<00:02:27.580> to<00:02:27.880> it<00:02:28.000> but<00:02:28.150> I<00:02:28.180> do<00:02:28.270> want<00:02:28.510> to

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
to add any size to it but I do want to

00:02:28.540 --> 00:03:10.710 
to add any size to it but I do want to
keep<00:02:28.690> it<00:02:28.840> tone<00:02:29.050> so<00:02:29.440> that's<00:02:29.620> the<00:02:29.800> next<00:02:30.010> exercise

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.449 

so<00:03:11.720> I<00:03:11.750> might<00:03:12.020> get<00:03:12.170> a<00:03:12.260> pose<00:03:12.470> like<00:03:12.860> one<00:03:13.010> more<00:03:13.220> time

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459 
so I might get a pose like one more time

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:16.090 
so I might get a pose like one more time
so<00:03:13.880> it's<00:03:14.000> at<00:03:14.330> 2<00:03:14.630> by<00:03:15.320> next<00:03:15.650> week<00:03:15.800> I'll<00:03:15.920> either

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:16.100 
so it's at 2 by next week I'll either

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.510 
so it's at 2 by next week I'll either
add<00:03:16.370> in<00:03:16.520> some<00:03:16.700> more<00:03:16.819> time<00:03:17.030> or<00:03:17.510> do<00:03:18.020> three<00:03:18.350> and<00:03:18.650> so

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:19.520 
add in some more time or do three and so

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:21.880 
add in some more time or do three and so
on<00:03:19.550> and<00:03:19.790> so<00:03:19.940> forth<00:03:20.180> you<00:03:20.209> have<00:03:20.270> to<00:03:20.420> always<00:03:20.890> keep

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:21.890 
on and so forth you have to always keep

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:50.690 
on and so forth you have to always keep
increasing

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:54.000 

and<00:03:51.700> my<00:03:52.120> next<00:03:52.420> exercise<00:03:52.930> for<00:03:53.170> back<00:03:53.320> is<00:03:53.560> a<00:03:53.590> low

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
and my next exercise for back is a low

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.780 
and my next exercise for back is a low
cable<00:03:54.400> pulley<00:03:54.940> row<00:03:55.240> I<00:03:55.740> kind<00:03:56.740> of<00:03:56.830> invented<00:03:57.490> this

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.790 
cable pulley row I kind of invented this

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:00.000 
cable pulley row I kind of invented this
myself<00:03:58.330> because<00:03:58.720> I<00:03:58.960> can't<00:03:59.320> quite<00:03:59.620> find<00:03:59.860> a

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.010 
myself because I can't quite find a

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:01.710 
myself because I can't quite find a
machine<00:04:00.160> that<00:04:00.580> hits<00:04:00.730> the<00:04:00.910> muscle<00:04:01.330> the<00:04:01.630> way

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:01.720 
machine that hits the muscle the way

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.600 
machine that hits the muscle the way
that<00:04:01.900> I<00:04:01.930> want<00:04:02.170> to<00:04:02.260> hit<00:04:02.350> it<00:04:02.530> in<00:04:02.710> the<00:04:02.830> lower<00:04:03.040> lat

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:03.610 
that I want to hit it in the lower lat

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:06.480 
that I want to hit it in the lower lat
so<00:04:04.030> I<00:04:04.390> just<00:04:04.960> go<00:04:05.200> unilaterally<00:04:05.980> which<00:04:06.220> means

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:06.490 
so I just go unilaterally which means

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:09.420 
so I just go unilaterally which means
one<00:04:06.790> at<00:04:06.880> a<00:04:06.970> time<00:04:07.150> each<00:04:07.210> side<00:04:07.480> and<00:04:08.050> I<00:04:08.650> pull<00:04:09.010> with

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
one at a time each side and I pull with

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:11.850 
one at a time each side and I pull with
a<00:04:09.460> neutral<00:04:09.910> grip<00:04:10.150> right<00:04:10.630> down<00:04:10.900> to<00:04:11.230> the<00:04:11.320> side<00:04:11.680> of

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:11.860 
a neutral grip right down to the side of
