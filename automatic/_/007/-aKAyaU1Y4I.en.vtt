00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
it was like October or something so it's

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.170

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
that I wasn't really using my DSLRs

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.359 
that I wasn't really using my DSLRs

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
getting that much use and really that's

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.140 
getting that much use and really that's
the<00:01:15.960> bottom<00:01:16.290> line<00:01:16.470> when<00:01:17.009> it<00:01:17.189> came<00:01:17.369> down<00:01:17.430> to<00:01:17.880> me

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.280 
doing anything and I saw that the prices
were<00:01:23.100> slowly<00:01:23.490> going<00:01:23.790> down<00:01:24.030> so<00:01:24.720> I<00:01:24.750> decided<00:01:25.170> to

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
I decided to buy a new five-year mark -

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.539

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.569 
today not a new one but a used one in
the<00:01:32.909> same<00:01:33.090> condition<00:01:33.540> I<00:01:33.689> probably<00:01:34.340> be<00:01:35.340> able<00:01:35.490> to

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
the same condition I probably be able to

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.280 
the same condition I probably be able to
pick<00:01:35.729> one<00:01:35.880> up<00:01:36.000> for<00:01:36.210> you<00:01:36.720> know<00:01:36.840> four<00:01:37.049> to<00:01:37.140> five

hundred<00:01:37.320> less<00:01:38.040> than<00:01:38.369> I<00:01:38.579> actually<00:01:38.850> sold<00:01:39.150> mine

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
hundred less than I actually sold mine

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.880 
hundred less than I actually sold mine
so<00:01:39.540> I<00:01:39.750> would<00:01:40.170> have<00:01:40.259> saved<00:01:40.500> money<00:01:40.680> in<00:01:40.829> the

so I would have saved money in the
process<00:01:41.100> made<00:01:41.670> some<00:01:41.909> money<00:01:42.060> in<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.240> process

you<00:03:19.470> know<00:03:19.620> it<00:03:19.709> gives<00:03:19.889> me<00:03:19.979> a<00:03:20.129> room<00:03:20.280> to

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
you know it gives me a room to

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:22.399 
you know it gives me a room to
experiment<00:03:20.790> whenever<00:03:21.359> you<00:03:21.959> know<00:03:22.049> my<00:03:22.169> film

00:03:22.399 --> 00:03:22.409 
experiment whenever you know my film

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:24.080 
experiment whenever you know my film
range<00:03:22.620> finders<00:03:22.979> aren't<00:03:23.310> providing<00:03:23.760> me<00:03:23.879> what<00:03:24.060> I

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
range finders aren't providing me what I

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.599 
range finders aren't providing me what I
need<00:03:24.419> but<00:03:24.629> the<00:03:25.620> biggest<00:03:25.829> reason<00:03:26.250> why<00:03:26.370> I<00:03:26.400> have

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:26.609 
need but the biggest reason why I have

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:29.030 
need but the biggest reason why I have
these<00:03:26.760> cameras<00:03:27.150> is<00:03:27.299> to<00:03:27.510> do<00:03:27.629> cam<00:03:28.470> crunch<00:03:28.709> videos

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
these cameras is to do cam crunch videos

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.909 
these cameras is to do cam crunch videos
so<00:03:29.609> while<00:03:29.970> it<00:03:30.120> may<00:03:30.269> seem<00:03:30.329> like<00:03:30.510> I<00:03:30.870> replaced<00:03:31.379> the

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:31.919 
so while it may seem like I replaced the

00:03:31.919 --> 00:03:35.360 
so while it may seem like I replaced the
TANF<00:03:32.400> ID<00:03:32.599> with<00:03:33.599> these<00:03:33.810> cameras<00:03:34.290> you<00:03:34.949> know<00:03:34.979> they

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
TANF ID with these cameras you know they

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.719 
TANF ID with these cameras you know they
happened<00:03:36.739> separately<00:03:37.739> they<00:03:37.919> weren't<00:03:38.370> you
