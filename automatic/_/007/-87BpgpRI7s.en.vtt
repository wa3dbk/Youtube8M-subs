metal<00:00:25.920> pole<00:00:26.150> now<00:00:27.150> you're<00:00:27.269> going<00:00:27.390> to<00:00:27.449> see<00:00:27.599> that

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
metal pole now you're going to see that

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.310 
metal pole now you're going to see that
this<00:00:27.869> is<00:00:28.050> going<00:00:28.080> to<00:00:28.199> glide<00:00:29.990> either<00:00:30.990> way<00:00:31.260> you

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
this is going to glide either way you

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.530 
this is going to glide either way you
want<00:00:31.470> to<00:00:31.619> rotate<00:00:31.740> it<00:00:31.949> really<00:00:32.399> really<00:00:32.610> easy<00:00:32.640> so

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
want to rotate it really really easy so

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.120 
want to rotate it really really easy so
there<00:00:33.660> should<00:00:33.809> be<00:00:33.840> a<00:00:33.960> problem<00:00:34.079> with<00:00:34.290> that<00:00:34.410> but

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
there should be a problem with that but

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.950 
there should be a problem with that but
make<00:00:35.579> sure<00:00:35.610> that<00:00:35.880> your<00:00:36.030> seat<00:00:36.420> beads<00:00:36.630> are<00:00:36.809> nice

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
make sure that your seat beads are nice

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.690 
make sure that your seat beads are nice
and<00:00:37.230> evenly<00:00:37.590> spaced<00:00:37.950> by<00:00:38.100> getting<00:00:38.370> it<00:00:38.460> a<00:00:38.489> really

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
and evenly spaced by getting it a really

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:44.420 
and evenly spaced by getting it a really
quick<00:00:38.910> turn<00:00:39.290> and<00:00:40.290> then<00:00:40.800> slowing<00:00:41.040> it<00:00:41.219> down<00:00:43.430> this

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
quick turn and then slowing it down this

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.910 
quick turn and then slowing it down this
is<00:00:44.489> also<00:00:44.760> going<00:00:44.940> to<00:00:45.000> come<00:00:45.180> with<00:00:45.210> a<00:00:45.480> very<00:00:45.930> nice

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
is also going to come with a very nice

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.010 
is also going to come with a very nice
and<00:00:46.980> handy<00:00:47.520> curved<00:00:47.789> needle<00:00:48.090> be<00:00:48.690> careful

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
and handy curved needle be careful

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.330 
and handy curved needle be careful
because<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.350> end<00:00:49.469> of<00:00:49.559> this<00:00:49.649> is<00:00:49.800> pretty<00:00:50.070> sharp

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
because the end of this is pretty sharp

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.850 
because the end of this is pretty sharp
but<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:51.600> cool<00:00:51.870> thing<00:00:52.079> about<00:00:52.110> this<00:00:52.559> is

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
but the cool thing about this is

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.410 
but the cool thing about this is
whatever<00:00:53.399> kind<00:00:53.640> of<00:00:53.789> thread<00:00:54.000> that<00:00:54.120> you<00:00:54.180> want<00:00:54.329> to

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
whatever kind of thread that you want to

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.110 
whatever kind of thread that you want to
use<00:00:54.570> nylon<00:00:54.840> thread<00:00:55.350> so<00:00:56.160> cord<00:00:56.489> anything<00:00:57.000> like

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
use nylon thread so cord anything like

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:57.819 
use nylon thread so cord anything like
that

00:00:57.819 --> 00:00:57.829 
that

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:00.049 
that
all<00:00:58.829> you<00:00:59.129> have<00:00:59.219> to<00:00:59.309> do<00:00:59.430> is<00:00:59.550> thread<00:00:59.820> it<00:00:59.910> through

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
all you have to do is thread it through

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.670 
all you have to do is thread it through
this<00:01:00.539> needle<00:01:02.899> it<00:01:03.899> runs<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.229> whole<00:01:04.260> length<00:01:04.379> of

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
this needle it runs the whole length of

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.160 
this needle it runs the whole length of
the<00:01:04.799> needle<00:01:05.070> so<00:01:05.100> that's<00:01:05.309> pretty<00:01:05.489> cool<00:01:06.170> then

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
the needle so that's pretty cool then

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.490 
the needle so that's pretty cool then
after<00:01:07.409> you<00:01:07.500> have<00:01:07.619> that<00:01:07.799> done<00:01:08.420> all<00:01:09.420> you<00:01:10.140> have<00:01:10.290> to

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
after you have that done all you have to

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.039 
after you have that done all you have to
do<00:01:10.680> is<00:01:11.400> start<00:01:11.760> spinning<00:01:12.180> this<00:01:13.430> fairly<00:01:14.430> slowly

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:15.049 
do is start spinning this fairly slowly

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:18.740 
do is start spinning this fairly slowly
and<00:01:16.049> we<00:01:16.380> found<00:01:16.530> that<00:01:16.770> speed<00:01:17.130> and<00:01:17.369> angle<00:01:18.150> of<00:01:18.390> the

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
and we found that speed and angle of the

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.070 
and we found that speed and angle of the
needle<00:01:20.180> for<00:01:21.180> two<00:01:21.299> factors<00:01:21.750> in<00:01:21.960> determining

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
needle for two factors in determining

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.230 
needle for two factors in determining
how<00:01:22.590> quick<00:01:22.860> and<00:01:23.040> how<00:01:23.310> easy<00:01:23.549> it<00:01:23.700> is<00:01:23.790> to<00:01:24.030> get<00:01:24.119> the

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
how quick and how easy it is to get the

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.510 
how quick and how easy it is to get the
seed<00:01:24.420> beads<00:01:24.659> onto<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.259> needle<00:01:25.409> so<00:01:26.130> start<00:01:26.400> off

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
seed beads onto the needle so start off

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:34.390 
seed beads onto the needle so start off
kind<00:01:26.939> of<00:01:27.090> slow

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:34.400 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.130 

you

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.080 

so<00:01:38.140> I'm<00:01:38.200> not<00:01:38.320> working<00:01:38.500> on<00:01:38.710> the<00:01:38.830> inside<00:01:39.090> circle

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
so I'm not working on the inside circle

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:41.310 
so I'm not working on the inside circle
I'm<00:01:40.330> going<00:01:40.360> to<00:01:40.479> be<00:01:40.570> working<00:01:40.690> on<00:01:40.930> the<00:01:41.020> outside

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.320 
I'm going to be working on the outside

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.460 
I'm going to be working on the outside
and<00:01:41.530> just<00:01:42.400> very<00:01:42.729> lightly<00:01:43.299> stick<00:01:44.140> the<00:01:44.260> end<00:01:44.380> of

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:44.470 
and just very lightly stick the end of

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:45.920 
and just very lightly stick the end of
the<00:01:44.530> needle<00:01:44.650> into<00:01:45.040> the<00:01:45.250> seed<00:01:45.460> beads<00:01:45.670> and

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
the needle into the seed beads and

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.149 
the needle into the seed beads and
you'll<00:01:46.930> know<00:01:47.110> you<00:01:47.170> have<00:01:47.380> the<00:01:47.500> right<00:01:47.650> angle<00:01:48.040> and

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:48.159 
you'll know you have the right angle and

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:50.160 
you'll know you have the right angle and
you're<00:01:48.280> going<00:01:48.460> at<00:01:48.580> the<00:01:48.700> right<00:01:48.850> speed<00:01:49.210> when

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
you're going at the right speed when

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.109 
you're going at the right speed when
those<00:01:50.350> beads<00:01:50.619> just<00:01:50.979> jump<00:01:51.520> right<00:01:51.580> onto<00:01:52.030> the

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:52.119 
those beads just jump right onto the

00:01:52.119 --> 00:02:00.930 
those beads just jump right onto the
needle<00:01:59.070> so<00:02:00.070> after<00:02:00.369> you<00:02:00.430> have<00:02:00.490> a<00:02:00.580> couple<00:02:00.670> of

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:00.940 
needle so after you have a couple of

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:02.670 
needle so after you have a couple of
them<00:02:01.060> on<00:02:01.180> and<00:02:01.420> you<00:02:02.140> can<00:02:02.290> go<00:02:02.380> the<00:02:02.500> whole<00:02:02.649> length

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:02.680 
them on and you can go the whole length

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:07.109
