00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:08.110 
so we're going to throw a little bit

00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:09.990 
so we're going to throw a little bit
taller<00:00:08.350> cylinder<00:00:08.889> I'm<00:00:09.549> going<00:00:09.700> to<00:00:09.760> talk<00:00:09.850> about

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:10.000 
taller cylinder I'm going to talk about

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.230 
taller cylinder I'm going to talk about
getting<00:00:10.330> the<00:00:10.450> clay<00:00:10.629> out<00:00:10.660> of<00:00:10.809> the<00:00:10.930> bottom<00:00:11.320> and

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
getting the clay out of the bottom and

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.360 
getting the clay out of the bottom and
the<00:00:13.240> rate<00:00:13.420> at<00:00:13.450> which<00:00:13.570> you<00:00:13.750> need<00:00:13.780> to<00:00:13.990> pull<00:00:14.370> so

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:15.370 
the rate at which you need to pull so

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:17.429 
the rate at which you need to pull so
that<00:00:15.519> you're<00:00:15.639> not<00:00:15.759> taking<00:00:16.029> too<00:00:16.420> long<00:00:16.450> to<00:00:17.050> make

00:00:17.429 --> 00:00:17.439 
that you're not taking too long to make

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:19.230 
that you're not taking too long to make
a<00:00:17.470> piece<00:00:17.740> before<00:00:17.950> it<00:00:18.160> gets<00:00:18.340> all<00:00:18.520> soft<00:00:18.849> and

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:19.240 
a piece before it gets all soft and

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:25.890 
a piece before it gets all soft and
wants<00:00:19.810> to<00:00:19.930> slump<00:00:24.449> so<00:00:25.449> I'm<00:00:25.539> going<00:00:25.689> to<00:00:25.720> press

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:25.900 
wants to slump so I'm going to press

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.560 
wants to slump so I'm going to press
down<00:00:25.930> and<00:00:26.890> get<00:00:27.070> it<00:00:27.160> stuck<00:00:27.430> centering<00:00:28.390> and

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:28.570 
down and get it stuck centering and

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:29.939 
down and get it stuck centering and
centering<00:00:28.810> quickly<00:00:29.170> is<00:00:29.260> important<00:00:29.740> to

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:29.949 
centering quickly is important to

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:31.380 
centering quickly is important to
pulling<00:00:30.279> a<00:00:30.369> tall<00:00:30.550> cylinder<00:00:30.789> too<00:00:31.119> because

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:31.390 
pulling a tall cylinder too because

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:32.869 
pulling a tall cylinder too because
you're<00:00:31.630> adding<00:00:31.750> less<00:00:31.990> water<00:00:32.260> to<00:00:32.470> the<00:00:32.559> clay

00:00:32.869 --> 00:00:32.879 
you're adding less water to the clay

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:36.000 
you're adding less water to the clay
better<00:00:33.879> cone<00:00:34.120> up<00:00:34.470> it<00:00:35.470> comes<00:00:35.559> out<00:00:35.739> at<00:00:35.800> the<00:00:35.830> top

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.010 
better cone up it comes out at the top

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:42.680 
better cone up it comes out at the top
of<00:00:36.130> my<00:00:36.219> hands<00:00:36.610> and<00:00:37.570> come<00:00:37.870> back<00:00:38.050> down

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:01.220 
make sense to me and opening straight

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:03.010 
make sense to me and opening straight
down<00:01:01.430> is<00:01:01.670> one<00:01:01.880> of<00:01:02.000> them<00:01:02.120> if<00:01:02.300> you<00:01:02.390> open<00:01:02.720> straight

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:03.020 
down is one of them if you open straight

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.650 
down is one of them if you open straight
down<00:01:03.290> that<00:01:04.040> you've<00:01:04.640> got<00:01:04.820> no<00:01:05.000> real<00:01:05.210> strength<00:01:05.600> to

down that you've got no real strength to
push<00:01:05.930> against<00:01:06.200> the<00:01:06.380> clay<00:01:06.590> and<00:01:06.800> the<00:01:06.860> clay<00:01:06.890> can

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:07.220 
push against the clay and the clay can

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:08.920 
push against the clay and the clay can
kind<00:01:07.370> of<00:01:07.430> move<00:01:07.550> your<00:01:07.700> wherever<00:01:07.970> in<00:01:08.600> a<00:01:08.660> smaller

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:08.930 
kind of move your wherever in a smaller

kind of move your wherever in a smaller
piece<00:01:09.140> of<00:01:09.170> clay<00:01:09.440> it<00:01:09.560> doesn't<00:01:09.830> matter<00:01:09.979> as<00:01:10.130> much

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:10.190 
piece of clay it doesn't matter as much

does a lot if you open it up on the side

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:15.910 
does a lot if you open it up on the side
it's<00:01:14.479> kind<00:01:14.720> of<00:01:14.780> self<00:01:15.080> centering<00:01:15.470> that<00:01:15.590> it's

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
it's kind of self centering that it's

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.440 
it's kind of self centering that it's
automatic<00:01:16.400> to<00:01:16.490> be<00:01:16.610> pushing<00:01:16.850> the<00:01:16.970> clay<00:01:17.210> in<00:01:17.360> the

middle also when you open it up and it

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.240 
middle also when you open it up and it
starts<00:01:20.390> to<00:01:20.540> widen<00:01:20.750> this<00:01:21.440> clay<00:01:21.770> when<00:01:21.979> you<00:01:22.070> first

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:22.250 
starts to widen this clay when you first

do your first pull will get pulled into

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.630 
do your first pull will get pulled into
the<00:01:23.869> wall<00:01:24.050> so<00:01:24.560> that<00:01:24.590> you<00:01:25.100> get<00:01:25.250> more<00:01:25.400> height

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.640 
the wall so that you get more height

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:31.450 
the wall so that you get more height
without<00:01:25.820> actually<00:01:26.330> having<00:01:26.390> to<00:01:26.600> pull<00:01:26.810> more<00:01:30.460> now

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.460

whether it's coming down like this and

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:00.160 
whether it's coming down like this and
I'm<00:01:58.130> applying<00:01:58.369> pressure<00:01:58.550> over<00:01:59.030> here<00:01:59.060> or<00:01:59.810> using

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
I'm applying pressure over here or using

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.800 
I'm applying pressure over here or using
a<00:02:00.229> tool<00:02:00.410> on<00:02:00.560> this<00:02:00.679> side<00:02:00.920> if<00:02:01.369> it<00:02:01.580> catches<00:02:01.910> it

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
a tool on this side if it catches it

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.350 
a tool on this side if it catches it
gets<00:02:02.869> driven<00:02:03.679> into<00:02:04.009> the<00:02:04.130> clay<00:02:04.369> until<00:02:04.640> it<00:02:05.179> you

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 
gets driven into the clay until it you

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.719 
gets driven into the clay until it you
know<00:02:05.750> makes<00:02:06.289> a<00:02:06.470> dent<00:02:06.740> and<00:02:06.830> then<00:02:07.280> gets<00:02:07.459> pulled

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
know makes a dent and then gets pulled

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:10.090 
know makes a dent and then gets pulled
around<00:02:07.910> on<00:02:08.390> this<00:02:08.840> side<00:02:08.899> it<00:02:09.440> just<00:02:09.649> gets<00:02:09.830> pulled

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:10.100 
around on this side it just gets pulled

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:11.830 
around on this side it just gets pulled
away<00:02:10.250> and<00:02:10.700> doesn't<00:02:11.030> cause<00:02:11.209> any<00:02:11.420> damage

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
away and doesn't cause any damage

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.559 
away and doesn't cause any damage
same<00:02:12.590> with<00:02:12.709> working<00:02:13.069> here<00:02:13.490> if<00:02:13.819> I<00:02:13.940> work<00:02:14.120> here

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:14.569 
same with working here if I work here

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:16.600 
same with working here if I work here
and<00:02:14.690> it<00:02:15.050> gets<00:02:15.230> caught<00:02:15.470> like<00:02:15.770> it<00:02:16.040> drives<00:02:16.310> into

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
and it gets caught like it drives into

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.839 
and it gets caught like it drives into
the<00:02:16.640> clay<00:02:17.530> also<00:02:18.530> on<00:02:18.709> this<00:02:19.280> side<00:02:19.490> when<00:02:19.700> there's

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:19.849 
the clay also on this side when there's

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:21.970 
the clay also on this side when there's

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
too much torque and the clay is pulling

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.730 
too much torque and the clay is pulling
away<00:02:22.069> it<00:02:22.520> just<00:02:22.550> lets<00:02:22.970> go<00:02:23.270> if<00:02:23.599> I'm<00:02:24.140> if<00:02:24.410> I'm<00:02:24.500> not

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:24.740 
away it just lets go if I'm if I'm not

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.440 
away it just lets go if I'm if I'm not
if<00:02:25.069> I<00:02:25.190> don't<00:02:25.340> stick<00:02:25.640> in<00:02:25.790> the<00:02:25.880> clay<00:02:26.060> over<00:02:26.180> here

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
if I don't stick in the clay over here

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.150 
if I don't stick in the clay over here
I'll<00:02:26.900> be<00:02:27.080> causing<00:02:27.380> a<00:02:27.440> lot<00:02:27.590> of<00:02:27.709> torque<00:02:27.980> to

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
I'll be causing a lot of torque to

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.280 
I'll be causing a lot of torque to
happen<00:02:28.490> it's<00:02:29.180> always<00:02:29.420> best<00:02:29.599> to<00:02:29.750> work<00:02:29.900> at<00:02:30.050> three

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
happen it's always best to work at three

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.170 
happen it's always best to work at three

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
could work here it's best so I'm going

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.690 
could work here it's best so I'm going
to<00:02:38.090> pull<00:02:38.330> up<00:02:38.569> now<00:02:38.990> I'm<00:02:39.860> gonna<00:02:39.980> take<00:02:40.130> my<00:02:40.190> C's<00:02:40.490> for

to pull up now I'm gonna take my C's for
cookie<00:02:41.000> I'm<00:02:41.240> gonna<00:02:41.450> press<00:02:41.630> with<00:02:41.780> these<00:02:41.930> two

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
cookie I'm gonna press with these two

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.930 
cookie I'm gonna press with these two
parts<00:02:42.290> of<00:02:42.349> my<00:02:42.410> fingers<00:02:42.770> on<00:02:42.890> the<00:02:42.980> inside<00:02:43.280> and<00:02:43.550> my

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
parts of my fingers on the inside and my

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.059 
parts of my fingers on the inside and my
crampy<00:02:44.300> finger<00:02:44.630> as<00:02:44.780> I<00:02:45.290> pull<00:02:45.500> up<00:02:45.530> I'm<00:02:45.830> actually

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:46.069 
crampy finger as I pull up I'm actually

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:47.710 
crampy finger as I pull up I'm actually
going<00:02:46.280> to<00:02:46.370> move<00:02:46.430> this<00:02:46.610> finger<00:02:46.790> to<00:02:47.060> the<00:02:47.180> top<00:02:47.390> and

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
going to move this finger to the top and

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.839 
going to move this finger to the top and
press<00:02:48.200> down<00:02:48.440> a<00:02:48.470> little<00:02:48.830> bit<00:02:49.069> that's<00:02:49.610> gonna

00:02:49.839 --> 00:02:49.849 
press down a little bit that's gonna

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:52.530 
press down a little bit that's gonna
stop<00:02:50.150> it<00:02:50.330> from<00:02:50.660> becoming<00:02:51.200> uneven

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
stop it from becoming uneven

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.780 
stop it from becoming uneven
also<00:02:53.349> I<00:02:53.560> actually<00:02:53.920> do<00:02:54.220> want<00:02:54.400> to<00:02:54.459> make<00:02:54.549> sure<00:02:54.580> I'm

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
also I actually do want to make sure I'm

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:56.399 
also I actually do want to make sure I'm
pressing<00:02:55.209> them<00:02:55.330> together<00:02:55.450> then<00:02:56.260> I'm

00:02:56.399 --> 00:02:56.409 
pressing them together then I'm

00:02:56.409 --> 00:02:58.979 
pressing them together then I'm
establishing<00:02:56.920> a<00:02:57.370> thickness<00:02:57.610> and<00:02:58.000> keeping

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 
establishing a thickness and keeping

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:00.390 
establishing a thickness and keeping
that<00:02:59.110> thickness<00:02:59.319> all<00:02:59.590> the<00:02:59.620> way<00:02:59.739> to<00:02:59.799> the<00:02:59.950> top<00:03:00.159> as

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
that thickness all the way to the top as

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.100 
that thickness all the way to the top as
I<00:03:00.849> get<00:03:01.060> towards<00:03:01.269> the<00:03:01.329> top<00:03:01.540> I<00:03:01.629> want<00:03:01.750> to<00:03:01.900> release

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
I get towards the top I want to release

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:03.600 
I get towards the top I want to release
that<00:03:02.319> pressure<00:03:02.470> so<00:03:02.950> they're<00:03:03.099> not<00:03:03.189> applying

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
that pressure so they're not applying

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:05.910 
that pressure so they're not applying
torque<00:03:03.939> and<00:03:04.209> causing<00:03:04.870> it<00:03:04.959> to<00:03:05.079> twist<00:03:05.290> or<00:03:05.560> get

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
torque and causing it to twist or get

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.949 
torque and causing it to twist or get
too<00:03:06.069> thin<00:03:06.280> at<00:03:06.400> the<00:03:06.430> top<00:03:06.720> so<00:03:07.720> I'm<00:03:07.780> going<00:03:07.900> to

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
too thin at the top so I'm going to

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:11.160 
too thin at the top so I'm going to
squeeze<00:03:08.170> together<00:03:08.409> and<00:03:08.879> move<00:03:09.879> up<00:03:10.060> as<00:03:10.870> I<00:03:11.019> move

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
squeeze together and move up as I move

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:12.630 
squeeze together and move up as I move
up<00:03:11.290> I<00:03:11.379> want<00:03:11.560> to<00:03:11.590> move<00:03:11.739> towards<00:03:12.040> the<00:03:12.129> center<00:03:12.430> too

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
up I want to move towards the center too

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.180 
up I want to move towards the center too
and<00:03:13.590> then<00:03:14.590> let<00:03:14.769> go

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190 
and then let go

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.960 
and then let go
compress<00:03:16.000> the<00:03:16.180> rim<00:03:17.159> wet<00:03:18.159> it<00:03:18.310> inside<00:03:18.760> and<00:03:18.909> out

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
compress the rim wet it inside and out

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:20.970 
compress the rim wet it inside and out
top<00:03:19.299> to<00:03:19.480> bottom<00:03:19.629> it's<00:03:20.349> really<00:03:20.590> important<00:03:20.920> that

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
top to bottom it's really important that

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.369 
top to bottom it's really important that
all<00:03:21.099> the<00:03:21.220> surfaces<00:03:21.670> are<00:03:21.790> wet<00:03:21.939> if<00:03:22.599> there's<00:03:23.290> a

00:03:23.369 --> 00:03:23.379 
all the surfaces are wet if there's a

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:25.920 
all the surfaces are wet if there's a
dry<00:03:23.590> spot<00:03:23.920> it<00:03:24.670> can<00:03:24.730> stick<00:03:25.150> to<00:03:25.299> your<00:03:25.420> hand<00:03:25.599> and

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
dry spot it can stick to your hand and

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.699 
dry spot it can stick to your hand and
cause<00:03:26.260> the<00:03:26.440> piece<00:03:26.590> to<00:03:26.769> rip<00:03:28.230> because<00:03:29.230> throwing

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
cause the piece to rip because throwing

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:31.559 
cause the piece to rip because throwing
isn't<00:03:29.980> just<00:03:30.099> about<00:03:30.190> throwing<00:03:30.519> tall<00:03:30.909> because

00:03:31.559 --> 00:03:31.569 
isn't just about throwing tall because

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:33.240 
isn't just about throwing tall because
it's<00:03:31.810> you<00:03:31.930> want<00:03:32.079> to<00:03:32.170> use<00:03:32.290> the<00:03:32.620> clay<00:03:32.799> to<00:03:33.069> its

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
it's you want to use the clay to its

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.009 
it's you want to use the clay to its
best<00:03:33.519> advantage<00:03:33.639> so<00:03:34.329> you<00:03:34.389> also<00:03:34.540> have<00:03:34.720> to<00:03:34.840> throw

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:35.019 
best advantage so you also have to throw

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:38.250 
best advantage so you also have to throw
a<00:03:35.049> thin<00:03:36.120> and<00:03:37.120> you<00:03:37.329> need<00:03:37.480> to<00:03:37.569> take<00:03:37.930> all<00:03:38.109> the

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
a thin and you need to take all the

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.080 
a thin and you need to take all the
considerations<00:03:38.889> in<00:03:39.010> terms<00:03:39.310> of<00:03:39.459> how<00:03:39.609> wet<00:03:39.940> the

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
considerations in terms of how wet the

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.990 
considerations in terms of how wet the
clay<00:03:40.299> is<00:03:40.480> and<00:03:40.930> how<00:03:41.650> well<00:03:41.859> it<00:03:41.980> slides<00:03:42.310> so<00:03:42.879> I'm

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
clay is and how well it slides so I'm

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.250 
clay is and how well it slides so I'm
actually<00:03:43.180> applying<00:03:43.480> quite<00:03:43.930> a<00:03:43.989> lot<00:03:44.139> of

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
actually applying quite a lot of

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.860 
actually applying quite a lot of
pressure<00:03:44.470> right<00:03:44.590> now<00:03:44.940> moving<00:03:45.940> up<00:03:46.120> and<00:03:46.299> towards

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
pressure right now moving up and towards

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:50.339 
pressure right now moving up and towards
the<00:03:46.989> center<00:03:48.269> you<00:03:49.269> see<00:03:49.420> that<00:03:49.569> the<00:03:49.720> pull<00:03:49.959> marks

00:03:50.339 --> 00:03:50.349 
the center you see that the pull marks

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:53.059

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:09.119 
pull tall if you go in consistently as
you<00:04:07.180> pull<00:04:07.449> you<00:04:08.290> can<00:04:08.410> get<00:04:08.560> thinness<00:04:08.829> and

00:04:09.119 --> 00:04:09.129

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:14.139 
in this is again going to add a little

00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:15.569 
in this is again going to add a little
bit<00:04:14.290> of<00:04:14.379> height<00:04:14.500> to<00:04:14.680> it<00:04:14.829> and<00:04:15.010> actually<00:04:15.430> make

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:15.579 
bit of height to it and actually make

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:16.860 
bit of height to it and actually make
the<00:04:15.699> clay<00:04:15.879> a<00:04:15.910> little<00:04:16.000> bit<00:04:16.239> thicker<00:04:16.419> so<00:04:16.660> I<00:04:16.690> can

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:16.870 
the clay a little bit thicker so I can

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:21.000 
the clay a little bit thicker so I can
pull<00:04:17.049> more<00:04:19.320> see<00:04:20.320> how<00:04:20.380> the<00:04:20.440> lip<00:04:20.620> is<00:04:20.739> starting<00:04:20.949> to

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
bottom again now this part right here is

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:35.900 
bottom again now this part right here is
about<00:04:34.530> the<00:04:34.710> thickness<00:04:34.920> that<00:04:35.070> I<00:04:35.250> want<00:04:35.550> it's

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:35.910 
about the thickness that I want it's

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:37.220 
about the thickness that I want it's
only<00:04:36.060> this<00:04:36.240> part<00:04:36.510> right<00:04:36.630> here<00:04:36.690> that<00:04:37.050> it's

only this part right here that it's

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:39.020 
only this part right here that it's
still<00:04:37.470> thick<00:04:37.740> so<00:04:38.340> I'm<00:04:38.400> going<00:04:38.550> to<00:04:38.610> squeeze<00:04:38.820> in

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.030 
still thick so I'm going to squeeze in

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:40.280 
still thick so I'm going to squeeze in
down<00:04:39.210> there<00:04:39.360> and<00:04:39.510> as<00:04:39.600> I<00:04:39.690> get<00:04:39.810> up<00:04:39.930> to<00:04:40.050> here<00:04:40.200> I'm

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:40.290 
down there and as I get up to here I'm

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:42.890 
down there and as I get up to here I'm
going<00:04:40.410> to<00:04:40.470> release<00:04:40.680> the<00:04:40.830> pressure<00:04:41.750> make<00:04:42.750> sure

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 
going to release the pressure make sure

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:50.470 
going to release the pressure make sure
it's<00:04:43.050> wet

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:50.480 

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:52.450 

and<00:04:50.570> then<00:04:51.230> start<00:04:51.560> to<00:04:51.650> release<00:04:51.860> that<00:04:52.040> pressure

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:52.460 
and then start to release that pressure

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:55.610 
and then start to release that pressure

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:22.620 
thinness that gives it the height if it

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:25.010 
thinness that gives it the height if it
was<00:06:22.710> too<00:06:22.920> thick<00:06:23.160> it<00:06:23.310> would<00:06:23.400> still<00:06:23.640> be<00:06:23.670> short<00:06:24.090> so

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:25.020 
was too thick it would still be short so
