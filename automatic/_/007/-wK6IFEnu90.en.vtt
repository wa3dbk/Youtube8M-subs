00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
a weapon or something like that or i'm

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.560 
a weapon or something like that or i'm
reloading<00:01:48.030> just<00:01:48.750> because<00:01:49.049> it<00:01:49.200> makes<00:01:49.229> the

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
reloading just because it makes the

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.749 
reloading just because it makes the
animation<00:01:51.570> if<00:01:51.869> you<00:01:52.200> will<00:01:52.409> go<00:01:53.100> by<00:01:53.280> a<00:01:53.310> lot<00:01:53.430> faster

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
animation if you will go by a lot faster

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.980 
animation if you will go by a lot faster
and<00:01:54.950> that<00:01:55.950> helps<00:01:56.399> a<00:01:56.549> lot<00:01:56.820> except<00:01:57.479> there<00:01:57.659> is<00:01:57.810> no

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
and that helps a lot except there is no

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.289 
and that helps a lot except there is no
second<00:01:58.350> weapon<00:01:58.469> so<00:01:58.770> you<00:01:58.829> can't<00:01:59.130> do<00:01:59.340> that<00:01:59.520> ok<00:02:00.240> so

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
second weapon so you can't do that ok so

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:05.359 
second weapon so you can't do that ok so
that's<00:02:00.719> a<00:02:00.810> little<00:02:02.360> g.a.y<00:02:03.649> homosexual<00:02:04.649> and

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
that's a little g.a.y homosexual and

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.749
