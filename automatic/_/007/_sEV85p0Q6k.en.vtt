treat as clinicians is the

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.550

that<00:02:41.730> once<00:02:42.000> you<00:02:42.180> were<00:02:42.500> positive<00:02:43.500> for<00:02:43.709> HPV<00:02:43.950> you

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
that once you were positive for HPV you

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.790 
that once you were positive for HPV you
