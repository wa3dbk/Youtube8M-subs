00:02:59.760 --> 00:02:59.770 
slightly tricky I've learned but once

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:01.830 
slightly tricky I've learned but once
you've<00:02:59.950> got<00:03:00.100> them<00:03:00.220> all<00:03:00.310> lined<00:03:00.370> up<00:03:00.820> your<00:03:01.600> bowl

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.479 
it's tricky there we go but I'm sure
after<00:03:09.430> practice<00:03:10.120> it<00:03:10.870> will<00:03:11.140> be<00:03:11.440> no<00:03:11.860> problem<00:03:12.430> at

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:12.489
