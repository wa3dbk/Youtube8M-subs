00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.590
 cardboard that is known as cardboard leather 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:51.489
 neither the man then snow are 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:54.610
 five pieces of these five pieces are going to 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:57.879
 go separated by this kraft paper 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:59.620
 after we have cut the five 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:01.390
 if you want, you can come here 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:04.420
 for and night that I can give you until 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:07.360
 the measurement then first we're going to 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:10.080
 take the rubber is rubber that we will 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:14.560
 here it will be only on the shore 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:17.320
 let's put on paper here as you see 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.740
 and we are going to separate it in this way with 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:22.720
 this rule here that is a rule for 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:26.910
 binding and then we are going to 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.910
 continue with the next 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:37.010
 it's going to stay this way the I quote them 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:40.490
 after it is here according to the measurements 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:43.400
 It is now then we will 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:47.660
 throw some rubber with the roller 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:49.760
 in this way the roller always does not 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:53.180
 have to soak a lot because if not 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:55.690
 they will wet the fabric they will achieve all the 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.690
 work 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:04.159
 look at the clients guys after 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:06.590
 they throw the rubber never go to put the 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:09.560
 cardboard on top of the fabric more if the fabric 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:13.790
 on top of the cardboard because this is going to 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:16.190
 help us to be able to center them and 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:19.550
 after we do this we're going to move on 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:23.170
 the hand because the gums with the fever 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:27.319
 he is going to be stuck 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:29.840
 after that is already here with this 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:32.120
 from here that puts it we know it as 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.880
 Butt plate is cantonera going to serve 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:38.110
 for us to mark here so that it leaves 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.110
 the perfect corner 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:50.470
 then we do so with the four 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:54.710
 sides after we finished doing 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:57.530
 the four sides we are going to fold here 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:03:00.490
 so after we doubled here we're going to 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:04.610
 put the rubber and the next step to follow 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:08.420
 is the next one we have already finished 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:11.590
 paste then we doubled because this is 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:15.080
 the way the seamstress will be 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:17.640
 now I'm going to show you how to dial 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:20.870
 put here 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:23.850
 this is what works for the following 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:27.150
 then I'm going to put here and I 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:28.980

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.770
 I scored with people with the 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.990
 centimeters to that medium and that's it 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:39.510
