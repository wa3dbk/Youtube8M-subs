think<00:06:42.659> this<00:06:42.780> could<00:06:43.020> be<00:06:43.050> if<00:06:43.409> all<00:06:43.620> the<00:06:43.740> players

00:06:43.909 --> 00:06:43.919 
think this could be if all the players

00:06:43.919 --> 00:06:46.100 
think this could be if all the players
sell<00:06:44.159> on<00:06:44.250> for<00:06:44.400> their<00:06:44.460> price<00:06:44.729> is<00:06:44.970> what<00:06:45.870> it's

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:46.110 
sell on for their price is what it's

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:47.600 
sell on for their price is what it's
probably<00:06:46.349> the<00:06:46.470> best<00:06:46.680> episode<00:06:47.039> for<00:06:47.190> sure<00:06:47.370> and
