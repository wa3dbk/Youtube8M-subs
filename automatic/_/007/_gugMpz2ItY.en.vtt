00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.819
 Gerstner 

00:00:24.819 --> 00:00:25.699
 Petrik Sander 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:28.119
 everything still in it for her crew 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:31.710
 we want to see that European countries do not conquer the 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.579
 Guys just notice that they do not spend so much percent sweat 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.150
 that she was still there for the boys and right now 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:41.590
 I think you can stop them with the appropriate vehicles 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:42.339
 can 

00:00:42.339 --> 00:00:45.289
 You have that as a player as well as that it is important that one is correct 

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:48.410
 always burdened in Erfurt and time that it is difficult time 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:49.500
 out of question 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.710
 but we made a lot of big 4 9% so we have to 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:55.420
 for the team Keystone 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.510
 the board now also a bit Stegmann FWV who on the one hand 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.090
 Ascent aspirant started the season so far 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.130
 that the performance could not be retrieved 

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:07.560
 and there I can not say too much 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.430
 and there is always planning throughout the season, mistakes have also been made 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.130
 and, in my opinion, it does not bring so well now - from one 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.930
 Place out 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:20.340
 to look backwards and Elena past and Solomon the Nine 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.510
 already want to realign us and 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:26.260
 Petrik Sander will have to go somewhere very well, even if they are very good 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.240
 like to look back we do it anyway because it was a lot 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:30.899
 go on the Ostalb 

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:34.520
 what exactly was there my colleague Johannes Seemüller has the past months 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.520
 summarized once again for us 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.530
 the scholz arena is a pretty stadium for 5000 spectators 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.310
 Lawn heating special gates give it all at its best 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.220
 even the new office can be proud of the ancestors is ripe for 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:52.910
 the second league 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:55.460
 this is also matched by the player salaries 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.520
 the top earners get their bags full on the Ostalb 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.229
 up to 15 000 euros a month that's league tip to a footballing paradise 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.400
 We've already had two mistakes this season 

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.790
 initially the popular Edgar Schmitt had to take his hat off straight 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.599
 four game days 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:20.709
 As successor Jürgen Kohler was committed to the fact already middle 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:24.179
 November back because of alleged heart problems 

00:02:24.179 --> 00:02:27.299
 coli took over the job of sports director 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:30.909
 now Petrik Sander is to lead the team from the table cellar 

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:32.479
 difficult task 

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:35.729
 because the player's squad probably swirled in eels blithely 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:39.709
 Numerous professionals have left the club since the beginning of the season 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:41.569
 8 new people were committed 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:44.529
 Continuity is something else 

00:02:44.529 --> 00:02:48.859
 responsible for this course Schilf Eindhoven and sponsors of the VfR 

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:50.599
 Aalen 

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:53.999
 there is, on the one hand, we have the chance of the president 

00:02:53.999 --> 00:02:56.999
 The entrepreneur seems too good faith for the football network 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:02.029
 further is the influence of the main sponsor in Telgte 

00:03:02.029 --> 00:03:05.159
 this season alone, the engineering company has about four million 

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:08.159
 Euro pumped into the club 

00:03:09.309 --> 00:03:12.909
 In return, intec managers have made their way onto the Supervisory Board 

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:16.950
 Johannes Moser and Klaus Betz have said that here 

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:22.429
 Chairman of the Supervisory Board Moser was also his friend Jürgen Kohler with a 

00:03:22.429 --> 00:03:24.809
 unusual power filled out 

00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:27.809
 spicy coli has been the representative of 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:34.150
 The influence of Cuba soon got Martin Praum to feel the former 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.119
 Bundesliga professional was until the end of last year managing director in Ahlen 

00:03:38.119 --> 00:03:41.969
 Kohler, however, was looking for my sports director on important issues 

00:03:41.969 --> 00:03:43.619
 for Brown's dismissal 

00:03:43.619 --> 00:03:46.129
 for me what am I supposed to be difficult because 

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:47.780
 I myself was tall 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.370
 about the way you told her that the repression is coal 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:54.699
 I would have problems with him then sink 

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:58.569
 to have brought in the presidents threw me their knowledge surprisingly and also 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:01.059
 not professional 

00:04:01.059 --> 00:04:04.480
 instead, Motorola brings a longtime companion into the boat 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.049
 Herrmann Dresden 

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:09.799
 that Hermann Gläsner so the end of 2007 at TuS Koblenz dismissed 

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:11.029
 had been 

00:04:11.029 --> 00:04:14.150
 Pauli the Taliban is believed to have deceived Jung's process 

00:04:14.669 --> 00:04:17.669
 Next Wednesday, both parties meet again in court 

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:23.449
 Klässler bad reputation is to all club management but obviously no 

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:25.069
 problem 

00:04:25.069 --> 00:04:28.560
 the story of the World reading excerpt so I do not know all the dishes 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.560
 in big Welles our people have to decide 

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:36.289
 For example, they lost their noses 

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:37.440
 from messed up 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.440
 at her club Ivica Olic rules for the 4 

00:04:41.439 --> 00:04:45.069
 Werder is since yesterday that their device house siblings possible 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:48.309
 what could I have no peace to end when 

00:04:48.309 --> 00:04:49.960
 another reproach 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.419
 President has the idea of ​​football 

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:55.620
 or wrong advice about it 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:00.090
 Second division stadium holds a lot of money in the big name that shows that too 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:01.599
 becomes sporty successful 

00:05:01.599 --> 00:05:04.449
 I think it's going to be very difficult because that's just nice 

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:08.460
 How healthy if the atmosphere is not necessarily trusted right now 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:11.939
 constructive mood is shaped 

00:05:11.939 --> 00:05:15.959
 from paradise Ahlens coach Petrik Sander is obvious on the hand 

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:20.889
 Petrik Sander 

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:22.999
 we also allowed some time off 

00:05:22.999 --> 00:05:25.770
 from the weather this year but very much in the 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:28.580
 I had to smile once in a while 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:31.259
 the fire will still be a Robert Parker 

00:05:31.259 --> 00:05:35.020
 almost no good light percent on the club throws and percent I can 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:35.789
 Finally 

00:05:35.789 --> 00:05:39.710
 Much of that did not really understand many things 

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:41.909
 catching behind me in my time 

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:45.780
 because he does not want to take a position like that, he says 

00:05:45.779 --> 00:05:46.779
 want to relate 

00:05:46.779 --> 00:05:47.870
 I think so 

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:51.400
 that many things went wrong that many things did not go as they did 

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:53.539
 Percent would be normal 

00:05:53.539 --> 00:05:56.979
 But percent believe then should eventually draw a line and 

00:05:56.979 --> 00:06:00.749
 so he is also in the work-up is enough and now let us all together 

00:06:00.749 --> 00:06:01.970
 tackle everyone together 

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:03.719
 pursue a common goal 

00:06:03.719 --> 00:06:05.689
 but is she is that AP 

00:06:05.689 --> 00:06:08.939
 many players would have exchanged field 

00:06:08.939 --> 00:06:12.759
 the Islanders as a trader hold one has influence as which 

00:06:12.759 --> 00:06:16.199
 Jürgen Kohler is sporting director He has the decision 

00:06:16.199 --> 00:06:17.849
 met for example 

00:06:17.849 --> 00:06:21.770
 mentioned cadre exchange concerns e10 would have too many players go and stuff 

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:26.009
 many come so completely normal normal process that percent not 

00:06:26.009 --> 00:06:29.990
 once pseudo-solution that all in consultation in the panel percent 

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:31.719
 the percent is done 

00:06:31.719 --> 00:06:36.149
 So one thinks that we first had pre-selection we met as 

00:06:36.149 --> 00:06:38.929
 First, sit down and say what can we do 

00:06:38.929 --> 00:06:39.770
 makeable 

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:44.500
 Percent meets certain demands sound percent then it goes with its own 

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:45.259
 Rows and 

00:06:45.259 --> 00:06:49.030
 if then find the unraveling agreement and rejection and percent match 

00:06:49.029 --> 00:06:50.869
 then we have to react to it percent 

00:06:50.869 --> 00:06:53.909
 you can make the most concrete announcements the cooperation with Jürgen Kohler 

00:06:53.909 --> 00:06:55.150
 how it looks 

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:56.889
 not all sit together daily 

00:06:56.889 --> 00:06:59.110
 one percent persuaded a founding 

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:02.419
 and Frosta only football will try it 

00:07:02.419 --> 00:07:06.150
 to leave everything out to be successful together with the portal 

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:08.309
 and I think Maier had 

00:07:08.309 --> 00:07:11.309
 so much experience that you get percent of stuff 

00:07:12.169 --> 00:07:16.159
 we can have it without leaving its own line I'm all going 

00:07:16.159 --> 00:07:19.620
 clearly philosophize on football yes we have a very clear agreement 

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:22.860
 that we do everything together that he does not go to the left or somehow 

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:24.490
 can drift off to the right 

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:27.510
 and how to cook your own soup but that you can be very clear 

00:07:27.509 --> 00:07:31.210
 Task distribution and a common decision then to understand
