00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.249 

I<00:00:04.310> guess<00:00:05.310> I<00:00:05.670> started<00:00:06.390> kayaking<00:00:06.690> when<00:00:07.080> I<00:00:07.170> was

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
I guess I started kayaking when I was

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.459 
I guess I started kayaking when I was
around<00:00:07.440> 16<00:00:07.830> my<00:00:08.700> dad<00:00:08.940> took<00:00:09.150> me<00:00:09.300> along<00:00:09.510> to<00:00:09.809> a<00:00:09.840> a

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
around 16 my dad took me along to a a

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.890 
around 16 my dad took me along to a a
camp<00:00:11.099> that<00:00:11.400> was<00:00:11.670> being<00:00:11.880> held<00:00:12.150> for<00:00:12.360> kayaking<00:00:12.660> I

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
camp that was being held for kayaking I

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.020 
camp that was being held for kayaking I
had<00:00:13.019> no<00:00:13.170> idea<00:00:13.530> what<00:00:13.799> his<00:00:13.950> intentions<00:00:14.519> were<00:00:14.610> or

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
had no idea what his intentions were or

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.970 
had no idea what his intentions were or
I<00:00:15.299> wouldn't<00:00:15.960> really<00:00:16.049> pick<00:00:16.320> up<00:00:16.470> anything<00:00:16.740> from

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
I wouldn't really pick up anything from

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.790 
I wouldn't really pick up anything from
that<00:00:17.609> camp<00:00:17.910> but<00:00:18.600> obviously<00:00:19.020> my<00:00:19.140> dad<00:00:19.350> figured

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
that camp but obviously my dad figured

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.070 
that camp but obviously my dad figured
out<00:00:19.949> that<00:00:20.100> I<00:00:20.160> could<00:00:20.189> go<00:00:20.400> at<00:00:20.490> the<00:00:20.580> Olympics<00:00:21.080> and

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
out that I could go at the Olympics and

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.189 
out that I could go at the Olympics and
there<00:00:22.260> was<00:00:22.380> a<00:00:22.410> junior<00:00:22.769> will<00:00:23.930> general<00:00:24.930> chance

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
there was a junior will general chance

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.450 
there was a junior will general chance
the<00:00:25.410> following<00:00:25.800> year<00:00:25.980> which<00:00:26.130> I<00:00:26.279> could

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
the following year which I could

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.790 
the following year which I could
potentially<00:00:27.090> be<00:00:27.240> selected<00:00:27.689> for<00:00:27.869> so<00:00:28.170> I<00:00:28.529> guess

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
potentially be selected for so I guess

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.200 
potentially be selected for so I guess
from<00:00:29.010> that<00:00:29.130> point<00:00:29.369> making<00:00:29.609> it<00:00:29.880> during<00:00:30.090> your

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
from that point making it during your

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.810 
from that point making it during your
worlds<00:00:30.480> team<00:00:30.720> I<00:00:31.080> really<00:00:31.260> I<00:00:32.040> really<00:00:32.160> wanted<00:00:32.730> to

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
worlds team I really I really wanted to

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.040 
worlds team I really I really wanted to
continue<00:00:33.090> hiking<00:00:33.570> I<00:00:35.690> didn't<00:00:36.690> think<00:00:36.809> I<00:00:36.989> would

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
continue hiking I didn't think I would

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.100 
continue hiking I didn't think I would
medal<00:00:37.380> in<00:00:37.500> 2013<00:00:38.370> and<00:00:38.579> then<00:00:38.670> k1<00:00:39.059> 500<00:00:39.600> so<00:00:39.899> that's

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
medal in 2013 and then k1 500 so that's

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.920 
medal in 2013 and then k1 500 so that's
a<00:00:40.320> step<00:00:40.559> ahead<00:00:41.100> of<00:00:41.370> where<00:00:41.520> I<00:00:41.579> thought<00:00:41.760> and<00:00:42.090> in

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
a step ahead of where I thought and in

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.440 
a step ahead of where I thought and in
my<00:00:43.469> it's<00:00:44.129> always<00:00:44.399> hard<00:00:44.610> to<00:00:44.730> gauge<00:00:44.940> how<00:00:45.210> foot

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
my it's always hard to gauge how foot

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:46.819 
my it's always hard to gauge how foot
you're<00:00:45.600> going<00:00:45.719> to<00:00:45.780> be<00:00:45.989> you<00:00:46.230> can<00:00:46.260> say<00:00:46.559> give

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
you're going to be you can say give

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.430 
you're going to be you can say give
yourself<00:00:47.100> a<00:00:47.190> number<00:00:47.420> but<00:00:48.420> who<00:00:49.110> knows<00:00:49.260> if

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
yourself a number but who knows if

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.500 
yourself a number but who knows if
you're<00:00:49.530> gonna<00:00:49.649> head<00:00:49.890> it<00:00:50.090> yeah

things like how much more training I can

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:22.740 
things like how much more training I can
do<00:01:20.800> and<00:01:21.100> the<00:01:21.730> skills<00:01:22.060> I've<00:01:22.270> learned<00:01:22.540> within

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:22.750 
do and the skills I've learned within

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:24.570 
do and the skills I've learned within
the<00:01:22.960> year<00:01:23.260> so<00:01:23.530> the<00:01:23.860> bullet<00:01:24.160> yeah<00:01:24.340> they've

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:24.580 
the year so the bullet yeah they've

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:26.580 
the year so the bullet yeah they've
brought<00:01:24.820> up<00:01:24.940> 2016<00:01:25.660> seems<00:01:26.020> to<00:01:26.110> be<00:01:26.200> going<00:01:26.320> well

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
brought up 2016 seems to be going well

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:34.609 
brought up 2016 seems to be going well
but<00:01:26.950> I<00:01:27.190> guess<00:01:28.590> you<00:01:29.590> never<00:01:29.740> know<00:01:29.920> until<00:01:30.220> you<00:01:30.460> me

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.930 

being<00:01:35.619> in<00:01:35.710> this<00:01:35.770> relationship<00:01:36.190> with<00:01:36.369> zero<00:01:36.729> is

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:36.940 
being in this relationship with zero is

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:39.180 
being in this relationship with zero is
for<00:01:37.210> the<00:01:37.660> future<00:01:37.900> I<00:01:38.290> guess<00:01:38.350> that's<00:01:38.740> really

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:39.190 
for the future I guess that's really

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:41.520 
for the future I guess that's really
important<00:01:39.760> for<00:01:39.880> them<00:01:40.000> now<00:01:40.150> but<00:01:40.390> also<00:01:40.540> to

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
important for them now but also to

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.180 
important for them now but also to
figure<00:01:42.490> out<00:01:42.760> you<00:01:43.600> know<00:01:43.750> there's<00:01:44.590> a<00:01:44.680> life<00:01:44.920> after

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:45.190 
figure out you know there's a life after

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:47.940 
figure out you know there's a life after
kayaking<00:01:45.729> and<00:01:46.270> I<00:01:46.660> don't<00:01:47.470> want<00:01:47.590> to<00:01:47.650> always<00:01:47.830> be

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
kayaking and I don't want to always be

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.670 
kayaking and I don't want to always be
known<00:01:48.250> as<00:01:48.760> an<00:01:49.119> athlete<00:01:49.750> or<00:01:49.960> Lisa<00:01:50.260> Carrington

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:50.680 
known as an athlete or Lisa Carrington

the Quaker so to begin this relationship

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.820 
the Quaker so to begin this relationship
with<00:01:54.190> zero<00:01:54.460> and<00:01:54.940> then<00:01:55.150> continue<00:01:55.690> it<00:01:55.869> I<00:01:56.140> feel

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:56.830

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:58.950 
with zero and then continue it I feel
that<00:01:57.040> there's<00:01:57.220> a<00:01:57.340> lot<00:01:57.520> of<00:01:57.550> potential<00:01:58.240> for<00:01:58.270> my

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
that there's a lot of potential for my

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
guess I'm not sure I really want to do

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.960 
guess I'm not sure I really want to do
after<00:02:03.940> hiking<00:02:04.150> so<00:02:04.660> to<00:02:04.720> use<00:02:05.380> a<00:02:05.740> relationship<00:02:06.640> to
