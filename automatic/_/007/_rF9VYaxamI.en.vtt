00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
music and on top of that what I what I

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:43.970

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
thought was great is you allowed each

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.460 
thought was great is you allowed each
other<00:02:44.280> to<00:02:44.790> to<00:02:45.420> show<00:02:45.600> each<00:02:45.750> other's<00:02:46.020> strengths

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
other to to show each other's strengths

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.380 
other to to show each other's strengths
but<00:02:46.650> you<00:02:46.770> didn't<00:02:47.010> know<00:02:47.070> who<00:02:47.250> each<00:02:47.520> one<00:02:47.760> was<00:02:48.000> and

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
but you didn't know who each one was and

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.600 
but you didn't know who each one was and
yet<00:02:48.540> you<00:02:48.990> highlighted<00:02:49.710> each<00:02:49.920> person<00:02:50.400> in<00:02:50.550> a

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
yet you highlighted each person in a

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.550 
yet you highlighted each person in a
great<00:02:50.850> way<00:02:51.000> that<00:02:51.030> didn't<00:02:51.780> take<00:02:51.990> away<00:02:52.230> from<00:02:52.440> the

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
great way that didn't take away from the

00:02:52.560 --> 00:03:01.340 
great way that didn't take away from the
group<00:02:52.740> so<00:02:52.920> I<00:02:53.010> really<00:02:53.640> really<00:02:59.870> what<00:03:00.870> was<00:03:01.080> what

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
group so I really really what was what

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.770 
group so I really really what was what
but<00:03:01.980> when<00:03:02.130> it<00:03:02.250> transitioned<00:03:02.910> from<00:03:02.940> one<00:03:03.330> person

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
but when it transitioned from one person

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:04.550 
but when it transitioned from one person
to<00:03:03.960> the<00:03:03.990> next

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
to the next

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.920 
to the next
I<00:03:04.680> made<00:03:05.190> it<00:03:05.340> so<00:03:05.580> that<00:03:05.610> whoever<00:03:06.210> was<00:03:06.690> just

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
I made it so that whoever was just

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.440 
I made it so that whoever was just
dancing<00:03:07.410> came<00:03:08.280> right<00:03:08.610> back<00:03:08.850> in<00:03:09.060> line<00:03:09.210> with<00:03:09.360> the

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:16.450 
dancing came right back in line with the
group<00:03:09.690> and<00:03:10.200> it<00:03:10.500> was<00:03:10.530> wonderful<00:03:11.190> idea

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:16.460 

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:19.550
