00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
my hand out the way here we've got some

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:22.129 
my hand out the way here we've got some
branches<00:04:20.430> crossing<00:04:20.910> this<00:04:21.600> is<00:04:21.840> the<00:04:21.959> more

00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:22.139 
branches crossing this is the more

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:23.930 
branches crossing this is the more
established<00:04:22.740> branch<00:04:23.070> which<00:04:23.340> I<00:04:23.430> want<00:04:23.639> to<00:04:23.699> keep

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
established branch which I want to keep

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.540 
established branch which I want to keep
this<00:04:24.720> one's<00:04:24.990> going<00:04:25.440> to<00:04:25.470> be<00:04:25.590> rubbing<00:04:25.800> on<00:04:26.040> it<00:04:26.220> so

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
this one's going to be rubbing on it so

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:27.950 
this one's going to be rubbing on it so
I'm<00:04:26.639> actually<00:04:26.699> to<00:04:26.970> take<00:04:27.150> this<00:04:27.330> one<00:04:27.540> back<00:04:27.570> off

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 
I'm actually to take this one back off

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:34.610 
I'm actually to take this one back off
here<00:04:28.260> again<00:04:28.560> close<00:04:29.100> to<00:04:29.310> the<00:04:29.430> collar<00:04:33.620> inside

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
here again close to the collar inside

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:37.670 
here again close to the collar inside
the<00:04:34.800> tree<00:04:35.010> here<00:04:35.310> we've<00:04:35.850> got<00:04:36.030> a<00:04:36.440> few<00:04:37.440> branches

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
the tree here we've got a few branches

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.590 
the tree here we've got a few branches
growing<00:04:38.160> I<00:04:38.460> just<00:04:38.880> want<00:04:39.030> to<00:04:39.090> keep<00:04:39.180> it<00:04:39.330> a<00:04:39.389> bit

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 
growing I just want to keep it a bit

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:40.820 
growing I just want to keep it a bit
clearer<00:04:39.930> so<00:04:40.139> I'm<00:04:40.200> going<00:04:40.320> to<00:04:40.410> take<00:04:40.530> a<00:04:40.560> bit<00:04:40.800> of

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:40.830 
clearer so I'm going to take a bit of

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:45.379 
clearer so I'm going to take a bit of
this<00:04:41.070> branch<00:04:41.700> off<00:04:41.940> here<00:04:43.760> here<00:04:44.760> I've<00:04:44.940> got<00:04:45.120> some

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:45.389 
this branch off here here I've got some

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:47.629 
this branch off here here I've got some
dead<00:04:46.050> wood<00:04:46.380> I'm<00:04:46.860> it's<00:04:47.280> not<00:04:47.340> looking<00:04:47.610> that

00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:47.639 
dead wood I'm it's not looking that

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:49.640 
dead wood I'm it's not looking that
healthy<00:04:48.210> so<00:04:48.630> I'm<00:04:48.720> going<00:04:48.840> to<00:04:48.870> take<00:04:49.020> it<00:04:49.169> back<00:04:49.410> to

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:49.650 
healthy so I'm going to take it back to

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:51.050 
healthy so I'm going to take it back to
where<00:04:49.830> I've<00:04:49.919> got<00:04:50.040> this<00:04:50.160> fruiting<00:04:50.580> bud<00:04:50.790> and

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
where I've got this fruiting bud and

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:56.930 
where I've got this fruiting bud and
this<00:04:51.240> junk<00:04:51.630> joint<00:04:51.960> you<00:04:53.450> just<00:04:54.450> take<00:04:54.600> you<00:04:55.940> see

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:56.940 
this junk joint you just take you see

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:59.629 
this junk joint you just take you see
this<00:04:57.120> branch<00:04:57.510> here<00:04:57.900> has<00:04:58.380> been<00:04:58.560> rubbing<00:04:59.010> it's

00:04:59.629 --> 00:04:59.639 
this branch here has been rubbing it's

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:01.370 
this branch here has been rubbing it's
not<00:04:59.789> caused<00:05:00.030> any<00:05:00.150> damage<00:05:00.300> yet<00:05:00.840> but<00:05:01.110> we<00:05:01.200> don't

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:01.380 
not caused any damage yet but we don't

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:02.840 
not caused any damage yet but we don't
really<00:05:01.560> want<00:05:01.680> that<00:05:01.979> to<00:05:02.100> happen<00:05:02.250> so<00:05:02.700> I'm<00:05:02.760> gonna

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:02.850 
really want that to happen so I'm gonna

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:05.900 
really want that to happen so I'm gonna
take<00:05:03.060> this<00:05:03.270> one<00:05:03.450> off<00:05:03.680> we'll<00:05:04.680> take<00:05:04.830> it<00:05:04.979> back<00:05:05.190> to

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:05.910 
take this one off we'll take it back to

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:07.610 
take this one off we'll take it back to
here<00:05:06.570> because<00:05:07.050> we've<00:05:07.260> still<00:05:07.440> got<00:05:07.590> some

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:07.620 
here because we've still got some

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:11.360 
here because we've still got some
fruiting<00:05:08.160> buds<00:05:09.740> and<00:05:10.740> that'll<00:05:10.979> stay<00:05:11.190> as<00:05:11.340> a

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:11.370 
fruiting buds and that'll stay as a

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:15.520 
fruiting buds and that'll stay as a
fruiting<00:05:11.820> spur<00:05:12.150> there

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:15.530 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:18.310 

here<00:05:16.220> I<00:05:16.250> cut<00:05:16.520> a<00:05:16.550> larger<00:05:17.000> branch<00:05:17.270> off<00:05:17.510> last<00:05:17.810> year

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:18.320 
here I cut a larger branch off last year

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:21.580 
here I cut a larger branch off last year
and<00:05:18.910> it<00:05:19.910> sent<00:05:20.210> up<00:05:20.300> a<00:05:20.420> number<00:05:20.570> of<00:05:20.840> shoots<00:05:21.110> Sun

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:21.590 
and it sent up a number of shoots Sun

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:23.770 
and it sent up a number of shoots Sun
shoots<00:05:21.950> I'm<00:05:22.580> going<00:05:22.730> to<00:05:22.790> retain<00:05:23.030> these<00:05:23.240> two<00:05:23.540> for

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:23.780 
shoots I'm going to retain these two for

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:25.360 
shoots I'm going to retain these two for
the<00:05:23.840> structure<00:05:24.230> of<00:05:24.320> the<00:05:24.440> tree<00:05:24.710> I'm<00:05:25.220> actually

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:25.370 
the structure of the tree I'm actually

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:28.030 
the structure of the tree I'm actually
remove<00:05:25.910> these<00:05:26.210> two<00:05:26.600> because<00:05:27.500> I<00:05:27.680> don't<00:05:27.920> need

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:28.040 
remove these two because I don't need

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:32.020 
remove these two because I don't need
them<00:05:29.530> what<00:05:30.530> I<00:05:30.560> can<00:05:30.710> do<00:05:30.830> with<00:05:30.980> this<00:05:31.100> one<00:05:31.340> here<00:05:31.700> is

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:32.030 
them what I can do with this one here is

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:36.640 
them what I can do with this one here is
if<00:05:32.750> I<00:05:32.870> cut<00:05:33.080> it<00:05:33.230> to<00:05:33.260> one<00:05:34.160> two<00:05:34.670> three<00:05:35.320> four<00:05:36.320> buds

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:36.650 
if I cut it to one two three four buds

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:42.370 
if I cut it to one two three four buds
that<00:05:38.950> will<00:05:39.950> encourage<00:05:40.690> this<00:05:41.690> to<00:05:41.990> perform

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:42.380 
that will encourage this to perform

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:52.780 
that will encourage this to perform
fruit<00:05:43.010> but<00:05:43.670> in<00:05:44.120> the<00:05:44.210> next<00:05:44.480> year

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:52.790 

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:56.210 

there's<00:05:53.790> a<00:05:53.940> an<00:05:54.570> old<00:05:54.930> tweak<00:05:55.380> here<00:05:55.680> with<00:05:55.860> a<00:05:55.920> few

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:56.220 
there's a an old tweak here with a few

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:59.030 
there's a an old tweak here with a few
old<00:05:56.430> fruit<00:05:56.730> bugs<00:05:57.030> on<00:05:57.180> it<00:05:57.830> what<00:05:58.830> I'm<00:05:58.890> going<00:05:59.010> to

00:05:59.030 --> 00:05:59.040 
old fruit bugs on it what I'm going to

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:01.280 
old fruit bugs on it what I'm going to
do<00:05:59.130> is<00:05:59.250> encourage<00:05:59.520> some<00:06:00.150> new<00:06:00.390> fruit<00:06:00.690> but<00:06:00.960> by

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:01.290 
do is encourage some new fruit but by

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:03.560 
do is encourage some new fruit but by
creating<00:06:01.530> in<00:06:01.800> use<00:06:02.010> but<00:06:02.370> what<00:06:03.060> I<00:06:03.180> actually<00:06:03.270> do

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:03.570 
creating in use but what I actually do

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:07.340 
creating in use but what I actually do
is<00:06:03.600> cut<00:06:04.260> beneath<00:06:04.620> the<00:06:04.800> raster<00:06:05.130> bud<00:06:05.730> there<00:06:06.350> the

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:07.350 
is cut beneath the raster bud there the

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:09.470 
is cut beneath the raster bud there the
cut<00:06:07.590> your<00:06:08.220> we<00:06:08.310> want<00:06:08.400> to<00:06:08.550> cut<00:06:08.700> at<00:06:08.880> an<00:06:08.970> angle<00:06:09.090> so

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:09.480 
cut your we want to cut at an angle so

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:11.360 
cut your we want to cut at an angle so
that<00:06:09.510> the<00:06:09.780> rain<00:06:10.200> water<00:06:10.470> will<00:06:10.770> run<00:06:10.950> away<00:06:11.160> from

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:11.370 
that the rain water will run away from

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:15.170 
that the rain water will run away from
the<00:06:11.820> bud<00:06:12.000> so<00:06:12.420> so<00:06:13.290> down<00:06:13.920> from<00:06:14.370> where<00:06:14.610> the<00:06:14.640> top<00:06:15.030> of

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:15.180 
the bud so so down from where the top of

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:16.760 
the bud so so down from where the top of
the<00:06:15.240> bud<00:06:15.390> is<00:06:15.540> so<00:06:15.720> that<00:06:15.870> water<00:06:16.050> runs<00:06:16.380> off<00:06:16.530> it

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:16.770 
the bud is so that water runs off it

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:19.910 
the bud is so that water runs off it
these<00:06:17.430> four<00:06:17.850> buds<00:06:18.690> here<00:06:18.930> should<00:06:19.290> create<00:06:19.560> fruit

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:19.920

got a congested number of fruiting boats
Spurs<00:06:30.990> it's<00:06:31.830> good<00:06:32.010> to<00:06:32.160> sometimes<00:06:32.520> reduce<00:06:32.700> them

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:33.060

Spurs it's good to sometimes reduce them
down<00:06:33.090> in<00:06:33.480> it<00:06:33.650> encourage<00:06:34.650> more<00:06:35.520> big<00:06:36.180> fruit

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:36.510 
down in it encourage more big fruit

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:39.500 
down in it encourage more big fruit
rather<00:06:36.780> than<00:06:37.020> lots<00:06:37.170> of<00:06:37.350> small<00:06:37.650> food<00:06:38.510> where

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:39.510 
rather than lots of small food where

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:41.330 
rather than lots of small food where
I've<00:06:39.600> got<00:06:39.750> a<00:06:39.780> branch<00:06:40.080> going<00:06:40.470> to<00:06:40.680> the<00:06:40.770> backwards

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:41.340 
I've got a branch going to the backwards

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:43.370 
I've got a branch going to the backwards
that<00:06:41.610> rather<00:06:42.450> than<00:06:42.630> cutting<00:06:42.810> the<00:06:42.990> whole<00:06:43.110> thing

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:43.380 
that rather than cutting the whole thing

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:44.990 
that rather than cutting the whole thing
off<00:06:43.560> we've<00:06:43.830> got<00:06:43.860> some<00:06:44.130> fruit<00:06:44.340> notes<00:06:44.670> on<00:06:44.850> here

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:45.000 
off we've got some fruit notes on here

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.910 
off we've got some fruit notes on here
if<00:06:45.090> I<00:06:45.180> cut<00:06:45.360> those<00:06:45.510> off<00:06:45.720> cutting<00:06:46.500> off<00:06:46.710> some

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:46.920 
if I cut those off cutting off some

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:49.040 
if I cut those off cutting off some
apples<00:06:47.280> so<00:06:47.820> what<00:06:47.940> I<00:06:47.970> want<00:06:48.150> to<00:06:48.210> do<00:06:48.360> is<00:06:48.780> there's

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:49.050 
apples so what I want to do is there's

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:51.560 
apples so what I want to do is there's
an<00:06:49.110> outward<00:06:49.410> facing<00:06:49.590> bud<00:06:49.830> just<00:06:50.340> there<00:06:50.580> so<00:06:51.480> I'm

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:51.570 
an outward facing bud just there so I'm

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:54.620 
an outward facing bud just there so I'm
going<00:06:51.660> to<00:06:51.750> cut<00:06:52.080> it<00:06:52.290> across<00:06:53.250> like<00:06:53.610> that<00:06:53.640> so<00:06:54.540> that

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:54.630 
going to cut it across like that so that

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:56.000 
going to cut it across like that so that
will<00:06:54.780> stimulate<00:06:54.990> that<00:06:55.290> to<00:06:55.470> come<00:06:55.590> over<00:06:55.710> here

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:56.010 
will stimulate that to come over here

00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:58.160 
will stimulate that to come over here
where<00:06:56.220> there's<00:06:56.370> a<00:06:56.430> gap<00:06:56.640> onto<00:06:57.270> this<00:06:57.360> side<00:06:57.630> and

00:06:58.160 --> 00:06:58.170 
where there's a gap onto this side and

00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:00.110 
where there's a gap onto this side and
then<00:06:58.440> these<00:06:58.620> this<00:06:59.070> these<00:06:59.430> this<00:06:59.670> year<00:06:59.700> will

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:00.120 
then these this these this year will

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:01.510 
then these this these this year will
form<00:07:00.390> fruit

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:01.520 
form fruit

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:04.550 
form fruit
okay<00:07:02.520> I'm<00:07:02.820> gonna<00:07:03.000> Lynwood<00:07:03.690> doing<00:07:03.990> branch<00:07:04.290> that

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:04.560 
okay I'm gonna Lynwood doing branch that

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:06.080 
okay I'm gonna Lynwood doing branch that
I<00:07:04.620> can't<00:07:04.830> quite<00:07:05.070> reach<00:07:05.400> and<00:07:05.640> use<00:07:05.790> my<00:07:05.940> long

handled pruners to remove it give it a

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:13.910 
handled pruners to remove it give it a
good<00:07:09.030> sharp<00:07:09.330> tug<00:07:11.000> something<00:07:12.000> like<00:07:12.120> that<00:07:12.920> we've

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:13.920 
good sharp tug something like that we've

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:15.590 
good sharp tug something like that we've
now<00:07:14.100> given<00:07:14.430> this<00:07:14.490> tree<00:07:14.700> a<00:07:14.730> relatively<00:07:15.240> light

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:15.600 
now given this tree a relatively light

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:17.000 
now given this tree a relatively light
prune<00:07:15.990> we've<00:07:16.200> got<00:07:16.350> rid<00:07:16.500> of<00:07:16.530> criss<00:07:16.800> crossing

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:17.010 
prune we've got rid of criss crossing
