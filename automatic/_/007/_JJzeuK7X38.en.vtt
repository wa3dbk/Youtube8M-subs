the<00:05:09.390> ipad<00:05:09.780> is<00:05:10.100> the<00:05:11.100> most<00:05:11.280> advanced<00:05:11.970> piece<00:05:12.180> of

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:12.210 
the ipad is the most advanced piece of

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:14.180 
the ipad is the most advanced piece of
technology<00:05:12.390> that<00:05:13.140> I've<00:05:13.380> ever<00:05:13.560> worked<00:05:13.770> on<00:05:14.070> it

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:14.190 
technology that I've ever worked on it

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:16.460 
technology that I've ever worked on it
out<00:05:14.340> the<00:05:15.300> innovation<00:05:15.900> and<00:05:15.990> the<00:05:16.080> product

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:16.470 
out the innovation and the product

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:18.320 
out the innovation and the product
really<00:05:16.770> starts<00:05:17.100> with<00:05:17.340> multi-touch<00:05:17.730> itself

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:18.330 
really starts with multi-touch itself

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.780 
really starts with multi-touch itself
this<00:05:18.870> multi-touch<00:05:19.560> is<00:05:19.800> the<00:05:20.010> largest<00:05:20.370> that

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:20.790 
this multi-touch is the largest that

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:23.180 
this multi-touch is the largest that
we've<00:05:20.970> ever<00:05:21.150> built<00:05:21.450> in<00:05:21.690> a<00:05:21.750> product<00:05:22.230> and<00:05:22.470> it's

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:23.190 
we've ever built in a product and it's

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:25.100 
we've ever built in a product and it's
on<00:05:23.370> multi<00:05:23.790> touch<00:05:23.970> of<00:05:24.210> this<00:05:24.420> size<00:05:24.690> that<00:05:25.080> you

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:25.110 
on multi touch of this size that you

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:27.200 
on multi touch of this size that you
really<00:05:25.770> feel<00:05:26.100> the<00:05:26.340> power<00:05:26.610> and<00:05:27.000> performance

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:27.210 
really feel the power and performance

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:30.070 
really feel the power and performance
that<00:05:27.870> multi-touch<00:05:28.380> can<00:05:28.620> offer

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:30.080 
that multi-touch can offer

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.379 
that multi-touch can offer
by<00:05:30.620> putting<00:05:30.889> well<00:05:31.129> over<00:05:31.430> a<00:05:31.490> thousand<00:05:32.030> sensors

00:05:32.379 --> 00:05:32.389 
by putting well over a thousand sensors

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:35.679 
by putting well over a thousand sensors
in<00:05:32.599> this<00:05:32.900> multi-touch<00:05:33.500> design<00:05:34.030> the<00:05:35.030> level<00:05:35.569> of

00:05:35.679 --> 00:05:35.689 
in this multi-touch design the level of

00:05:35.689 --> 00:05:37.659 
in this multi-touch design the level of
multi-touch<00:05:36.199> accuracy<00:05:36.889> that<00:05:37.039> the<00:05:37.159> customer

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:37.669 
multi-touch accuracy that the customer

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:40.270 
multi-touch accuracy that the customer
experience<00:05:37.699> is<00:05:38.449> unprecedented<00:05:39.189> when<00:05:40.189> you

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:40.280 
experience is unprecedented when you

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:42.520 
experience is unprecedented when you
take<00:05:40.490> the<00:05:40.610> product<00:05:40.879> out<00:05:41.210> of<00:05:41.449> the<00:05:41.539> box<00:05:41.750> and<00:05:42.139> hit

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:42.530 
take the product out of the box and hit

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:45.100 
take the product out of the box and hit
the<00:05:42.710> power<00:05:42.919> button<00:05:43.300> the<00:05:44.300> display<00:05:44.689> me<00:05:44.960> it

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:45.110 
the power button the display me it

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:45.959 
the power button the display me it
becomes

00:05:45.959 --> 00:05:45.969 
becomes

00:05:45.969 --> 00:05:47.909 
becomes
and<00:05:46.449> I<00:05:46.569> think<00:05:46.629> our<00:05:47.049> customers<00:05:47.499> experience

00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:47.919 
and I think our customers experience

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:50.579 
and I think our customers experience
where<00:05:48.309> that<00:05:48.519> would<00:05:48.729> be<00:05:48.789> Bob<00:05:49.269> this<00:05:49.629> is<00:05:49.689> a<00:05:49.869> really

and you really feel the performance of

00:06:19.509 --> 00:06:21.809 
and you really feel the performance of
them<00:06:19.689> is<00:06:20.139> because<00:06:20.559> of<00:06:20.589> the<00:06:20.829> custom<00:06:21.279> silicon

00:06:21.809 --> 00:06:21.819 
them is because of the custom silicon

00:06:21.819 --> 00:06:24.329 
them is because of the custom silicon
that<00:06:22.509> we<00:06:22.809> designed<00:06:23.169> for<00:06:23.499> this<00:06:23.589> product<00:06:23.979> that
