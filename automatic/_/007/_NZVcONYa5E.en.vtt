conclusions out of this first appearance

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.209 
conclusions out of this first appearance
but<00:00:33.719> he<00:00:33.899> had<00:00:34.110> flashes<00:00:34.680> of<00:00:34.710> what<00:00:34.920> we'd<00:00:35.100> expect

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
but he had flashes of what we'd expect

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:36.979

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
from them see but I think this is going

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.389 
from them see but I think this is going
to<00:00:37.079> take<00:00:37.230> some<00:00:37.290> time<00:00:37.620> for<00:00:37.649> him<00:00:37.860> to<00:00:37.890> integrate

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
to take some time for him to integrate

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.190
