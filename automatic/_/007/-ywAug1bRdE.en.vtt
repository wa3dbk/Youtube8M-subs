 normal 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:16.840
 good to say that in France we were 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:18.430
 so desperate that we asked 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:22.000

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:04.729
 thing he would like him to aim 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.350

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:07.700
 relaxed over any wood at the beginning 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.729

 Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault of not

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.490
 this French crisis that responds
