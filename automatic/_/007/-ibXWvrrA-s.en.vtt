00:00:43.349 --> 00:00:43.359 
a little more difficult something I

00:00:43.359 --> 00:00:45.059 
a little more difficult something I
notice<00:00:43.629> about<00:00:43.839> Robin<00:00:44.170> is<00:00:44.440> that<00:00:44.620> his<00:00:44.739> stunts

and<00:00:45.190> beat<00:00:45.339> down<00:00:45.370> those<00:00:45.699> are<00:00:45.879> so<00:00:46.089> much<00:00:46.239> slower

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:46.510 
and beat down those are so much slower

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:48.689 
and beat down those are so much slower
than<00:00:46.600> bat<00:00:46.870> means<00:00:47.159> this<00:00:48.159> is<00:00:48.339> probably<00:00:48.609> the

00:00:48.689 --> 00:00:48.699 
than bat means this is probably the

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:49.979 
than bat means this is probably the

far<00:00:54.940> as<00:00:55.030> aerial<00:00:55.299> attack<00:00:55.600> I<00:00:55.809> didn't<00:00:56.199> get<00:00:56.289> a<00:00:56.319> test

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:56.620 
far as aerial attack I didn't get a test

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.039 
far as aerial attack I didn't get a test
it<00:00:56.829> but<00:00:57.729> it<00:00:57.819> seems<00:00:57.999> to<00:00:58.089> be<00:00:58.149> slightly<00:00:58.510> faster

00:00:59.039 --> 00:00:59.049 
it but it seems to be slightly faster

00:00:59.049 --> 00:01:01.559 
it but it seems to be slightly faster
than<00:00:59.079> Bettany's<00:00:59.589> if<00:01:00.249> you<00:01:00.460> do<00:01:00.579> know<00:01:00.789> and<00:01:01.389> can

confirm it please let me know just in
case<00:01:03.819> you<00:01:04.210> believe<00:01:04.659> what<00:01:04.809> I<00:01:04.839> said<00:01:05.080> on<00:01:05.199> the<00:01:05.290> last

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:05.500 
case you believe what I said on the last

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.200 
case you believe what I said on the last
night<00:01:05.830> here's<00:01:06.190> a<00:01:06.280> quick<00:01:06.580> comparison<00:01:06.820> between

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.210 
night here's a quick comparison between

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.440 
night here's a quick comparison between
Robin<00:01:07.750> embedment<00:01:08.020> standing<00:01:08.530> beatdown<00:01:09.450> okay

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:10.450 
Robin embedment standing beatdown okay

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:12.389 
Robin embedment standing beatdown okay
okay<00:01:10.899> maybe<00:01:11.229> that<00:01:11.469> was<00:01:11.530> a<00:01:11.649> little<00:01:11.770> too<00:01:12.039> quick

00:01:12.389 --> 00:01:12.399 
okay maybe that was a little too quick

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:14.420 
okay maybe that was a little too quick
so<00:01:12.670> here<00:01:13.270> it<00:01:13.360> is<00:01:13.450> again<00:01:13.630> in<00:01:13.689> slow<00:01:13.990> motion

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
so here it is again in slow motion

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.889 
so here it is again in slow motion
for<00:01:15.430> Robins<00:01:15.820> son<00:01:16.000> I<00:01:16.180> didn't<00:01:16.420> see<00:01:16.539> much<00:01:16.659> of<00:01:16.719> a

00:01:16.889 --> 00:01:16.899 
for Robins son I didn't see much of a

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:18.359 
for Robins son I didn't see much of a
difference<00:01:17.380> in<00:01:17.530> speed<00:01:17.829> between<00:01:18.009> his<00:01:18.340> and

00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:18.369 
difference in speed between his and

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:20.700 
difference in speed between his and
Batman's<00:01:18.909> but<00:01:19.630> you<00:01:19.689> can<00:01:19.810> see<00:01:19.960> Robins<00:01:20.380> beatdown

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:20.710 
Batman's but you can see Robins beatdown

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.039 
Batman's but you can see Robins beatdown
starts<00:01:21.039> off<00:01:21.159> a<00:01:21.189> lot<00:01:21.460> slower<00:01:21.820> because<00:01:22.659> he<00:01:22.899> does

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:23.049 
starts off a lot slower because he does

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:25.230 
starts off a lot slower because he does
a<00:01:23.079> little<00:01:23.259> spin<00:01:23.560> at<00:01:23.680> the<00:01:23.770> start<00:01:24.240> eventually

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240 
a little spin at the start eventually

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.060 
a little spin at the start eventually
though<00:01:25.570> Robin<00:01:26.020> does<00:01:26.170> speed<00:01:26.409> up<00:01:26.439> in<00:01:26.619> his<00:01:26.710> began

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:27.070 
though Robin does speed up in his began

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:28.980 
though Robin does speed up in his began
so<00:01:27.310> I<00:01:27.700> guess<00:01:28.090> it<00:01:28.270> kind<00:01:28.450> of<00:01:28.509> makes<00:01:28.570> up<00:01:28.810> for<00:01:28.840> that

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
so I guess it kind of makes up for that

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:30.810 
so I guess it kind of makes up for that
although<00:01:29.740> it<00:01:29.979> does<00:01:30.130> end<00:01:30.369> up<00:01:30.430> being<00:01:30.490> a<00:01:30.729> lot

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:30.820 
although it does end up being a lot

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.020 
although it does end up being a lot
slower<00:01:31.119> than<00:01:31.240> anyway<00:01:32.109> all<00:01:33.039> right<00:01:33.219> I<00:01:33.429> think<00:01:33.789> we

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
slower than anyway all right I think we

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.179 
slower than anyway all right I think we
spend<00:01:34.240> enough<00:01:34.420> time<00:01:34.450> on<00:01:34.780> this<00:01:34.960> now<00:01:35.679> I<00:01:35.710> think<00:01:35.950> we

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:36.189 
spend enough time on this now I think we

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:37.020 
spend enough time on this now I think we
should<00:01:36.219> take<00:01:36.399> a<00:01:36.460> look<00:01:36.609> at<00:01:36.789> what's<00:01:36.939> really

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
should take a look at what's really

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.249 
should take a look at what's really
important<00:01:37.840> his<00:01:38.079> moves<00:01:38.380> and<00:01:38.619> his<00:01:38.979> gadgets<00:01:40.259> now

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:41.259 
important his moves and his gadgets now

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:42.749 
important his moves and his gadgets now
