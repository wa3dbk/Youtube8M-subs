00:00:00.219 --> 00:00:03.219
 so 

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:10.620
 good morning, I'm Miguel RodrÃ­guez 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.230
 technical engineer of the nursery company 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.719
 jovÃ¡n and today we are going to explain we are going to 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.740
 talk about substrates in particular 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.630
 on coconut fiber 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:22.450
 for some time now it has become 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:24.070
 fashion among the footballer and between 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:27.130
 housewives using this type of 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:29.290
 substrate would appear like around 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.990
 of about five years that we started to 

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:32.739
 use it industrially and in large 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:34.870
 amounts 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:36.550
 here we have a block of coconut fiber 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.949
 this is what comes to us here 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:42.340
 that normally comes from countries like 

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:45.129
 Indian that is nothing but the bark 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:47.710
 of crushed and crushed coconut and 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:52.269
 compacted here comes compacted like what 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:54.699
 we see this makes the price of 

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:57.489
 this substrate because it comes in this form 

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:59.350
 of compact block for us to employ 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:01.900
 this material the first thing we do is 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:04.449
 hydrate what then the best for 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:06.010
 to do it is by flood normally 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:08.080
 for the wood they are are more blocks 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:11.020
 small that the best thing is to put it in 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.580
 any kind of bucket bucket and 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.920
 fill it with water this is going to go 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.360
 expanding its volume five times more 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.240
 you have to be careful because obviously 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.540
 if we put this here 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.829
 is going to rebozar when it expands 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.680
 then put the smaller blocks 

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:27.570
 and know that it's going to expand about five 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.149
 times more its volume then as 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:33.000
 result when that has already been 

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:35.310
 hydrated what we have is this 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.250
 material this material what it does is 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.409
 that the air to much the roots that is 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.610
 this is a type of material that is not a 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:47.789
 fertilizer this serves to enrich us 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:50.360
 add the soil the substrate to 

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:53.399
 make it lighter lighter so that 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:55.500
 the oxygen reaches the roots in those 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:58.709
 compacted land this is going to be worth 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.690
 to give you a bit of what we are 

00:01:58.709 --> 00:02:03.840
 talking about creation and of and so that 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:05.209
 nutrients from whom we have better is never 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.100
 a type of fertilizer as people think 

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:10.920
 these fertilizers this a fertilizer this is 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:13.170
 so that the earth is more fluffy more 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.850
 better for the plant you have to have 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.349
 Care especially with coconut fiber 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.680
 because if it's true that coconut fiber 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:22.350
 when we add to certain lands the 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.150
 principle the plant let's say it steals 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.990
 the nutrients then always when 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.570
 we mix fiber 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:29.970
 it is important to mix some compost 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.980
 on the same substrate put a little bit of 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.260
 fertilizer and mix it and then later this 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.530
 substrate would mix with soil with 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.790
 peat depending on the type of crop 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.850
 We recommend the use of coconut fiber 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:45.780
 to combine it with other substrates not 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:48.330
 alone since it is for a very 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.100
 technical and it's difficult to get ahead 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:52.500
 a plant only with coconut fiber 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.540
 then this is a good substrate for 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.170
 mix it with other substrates never for 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.170
 use them alone 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.380
 ah
