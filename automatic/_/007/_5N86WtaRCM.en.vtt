 This is one of the basics of confectionery 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.069
 absolute best known that is well suited 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.769

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.230
 type of cream today but we will make a pan di 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.820
 spain very unique ideal not only 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.049
 for those who are allergic to eggs 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.250
 lactose intolerant 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.350
 but also for those who suffer from 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.270
 hypercholesterolemia or decided to 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.550
 follow a strictly bound diet 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.310
 let's see together how to prepare the pan di 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.750
 spain without eggs and without cholesterol 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:31.019
 to prepare this recipe we have 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:36.510
 need 180 grams of white flour 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:40.110
 bio 60 g of potato starch 150 g of 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:43.050
 whole cane sugar 150 g of 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:47.239
 good coconut one packet of yeast 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:51.360
 for desserts a teaspoon of turmeric 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:55.800
 lemon peel organic 150 milliliters 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:57.510
 of soy milk a vanilla pod 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.359
 so let's start with the preparation 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.010
 inside a blender we pour it 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.049
 whole brown sugar for then 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.860
 we're going to reduce it to a dust 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:13.290
 then very fine but we give you with the 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:15.110
 lemon zest and now let's try it too 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:19.430
 with vanilla seeds 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.430
 let's go then to engrave the pod 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.600
 we risk simi inside 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.240
 now we also put some turmeric 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:43.260
 will ask for an orange color I am not 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:45.780
 sponge cake now back to everything 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:47.430
 meanwhile transferred the powder of 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.920
 flavored sugar inside one 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.870
 bowl and I joined the role of co with 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.550
 this and little ways that I did at home 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:55.020
 you can find the second recipe 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:56.490
 impression or I'll put myself after the 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.860
 link at the end of the video 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.869
 alternatively you can use one 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:05.040
 margarine but possibly prepared 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:08.000
 without hydrogenated fats and now 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:11.070
 we want everything 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:15.210
 so we got a butter cream 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:17.850
 vegetable and sugar naturally is what 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:23.430
 missing we combine the dry ingredients 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:25.880
 or organic and white flour 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.880
 potato starch 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:38.750
 if we also make baking powder and 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:43.850
 amalgamiamo combining all the ingredients 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.850
 slowly and flush soy milk 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.709
 here it is our beautiful cream for the 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.870
 sponge cake 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:54.480
 now what have I done here or lined 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:57.090
 a square pan on the side of 22 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:00.000
 centimeters with parchment paper I go to 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:02.280
 distribute the dough inside it 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.810
 level then with a sword I go to 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.450
 then bake in a preheated oven 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.480
 preheated to 180 degrees for about 30 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.739
 minutes 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:13.830
 here is our sponge cake 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:15.810
 pure vegetable given a little looks like people 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:17.640
 I did with eggs instead there is none 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.260
 not even trace cholesterol 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:23.700
 in fact I also show the 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:25.670
 internal consistency here it is because it is 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.380
 very soft 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:30.390
 in short, we are upsetting the kids 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:32.130
 the golden rules of the classic rules 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:34.049
 pastry and who knows if the pastry chefs 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:36.739
 they will be glad they will pull their ears 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:36.739
 crazy people
