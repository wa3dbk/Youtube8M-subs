welcome<00:00:10.860> to<00:00:10.950> poor<00:00:11.190> man<00:00:11.370> mods<00:00:11.670> today<00:00:12.030> we're

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
welcome to poor man mods today we're

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:17.330 
welcome to poor man mods today we're
gonna<00:00:12.269> show<00:00:12.540> you<00:00:12.570> how<00:00:12.690> to<00:00:12.870> install<00:00:13.259> a<00:00:15.650> yeah<00:00:16.680> the

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
gonna show you how to install a yeah the

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:29.390 
gonna show you how to install a yeah the
infamous<00:00:17.609> booster<00:00:18.119> okay<00:00:27.980> what<00:00:28.980> you<00:00:29.070> have<00:00:29.279> to

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
infamous booster okay what you have to

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.939 
infamous booster okay what you have to
do<00:00:29.580> when<00:00:30.330> you<00:00:30.420> hook<00:00:30.539> up<00:00:30.660> a<00:00:30.750> boost<00:00:30.960> gauge<00:00:31.019> you

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
do when you hook up a boost gauge you

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.680 
do when you hook up a boost gauge you
only<00:00:32.099> have<00:00:32.309> to<00:00:32.430> get<00:00:32.579> first<00:00:32.850> of<00:00:32.969> all<00:00:33.090> the

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
only have to get first of all the

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:34.970 
only have to get first of all the
hardware<00:00:34.050> to<00:00:34.170> do<00:00:34.290> it<00:00:34.440> you<00:00:34.590> have<00:00:34.649> to<00:00:34.800> get<00:00:34.890> the

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
hardware to do it you have to get the

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.220 
hardware to do it you have to get the
gauge<00:00:35.130> itself<00:00:35.460> it's<00:00:36.180> very<00:00:36.239> simple<00:00:36.840> all<00:00:37.170> it

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
gauge itself it's very simple all it

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.170 
gauge itself it's very simple all it
does<00:00:37.500> is<00:00:37.680> reads<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.100> vacuum<00:00:38.430> line<00:00:38.610> off<00:00:38.910> the

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
does is reads the vacuum line off the

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.010 
does is reads the vacuum line off the
brake<00:00:39.390> booster<00:00:39.570> so<00:00:40.350> what<00:00:40.500> we<00:00:40.590> did<00:00:40.770> was<00:00:41.579> random

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:42.020 
brake booster so what we did was random

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.350 
brake booster so what we did was random
from<00:00:43.020> inside<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:43.739> car<00:00:43.950> waiting<00:00:44.820> outside<00:00:44.969> the

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
from inside the car waiting outside the

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.850 
from inside the car waiting outside the
core<00:00:45.539> which<00:00:45.750> is<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:45.960> clear<00:00:46.170> line<00:00:46.350> this<00:00:46.620> is<00:00:46.739> our

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
core which is the clear line this is our

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.979 
core which is the clear line this is our
boost<00:00:47.070> line<00:00:47.280> right<00:00:47.460> here<00:00:47.640> and<00:00:47.850> it's<00:00:48.690> teed<00:00:48.870> off

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
boost line right here and it's teed off

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.690 
boost line right here and it's teed off
right<00:00:49.289> there<00:00:49.500> so<00:00:49.980> it<00:00:50.100> just<00:00:50.280> measures<00:00:50.430> the

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
right there so it just measures the

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:51.860 
right there so it just measures the
amount<00:00:50.760> of<00:00:50.940> boost<00:00:51.090> and<00:00:51.329> amount<00:00:51.600> of<00:00:51.660> vacuum

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
amount of boost and amount of vacuum

00:00:51.870 --> 00:01:03.260 
amount of boost and amount of vacuum
inside<00:00:52.289> that<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:53.250> brake<00:00:53.489> booster<00:01:01.940> so<00:01:02.940> we<00:01:03.090> went

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
inside that the brake booster so we went

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.700 
inside that the brake booster so we went
ahead<00:01:03.329> and<00:01:03.480> did<00:01:03.600> was<00:01:03.809> take<00:01:03.960> took<00:01:04.350> this<00:01:04.470> trim

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
ahead and did was take took this trim

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.490 
ahead and did was take took this trim
panel<00:01:04.890> down<00:01:05.129> in<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.339> car<00:01:05.540> we<00:01:06.540> mounted<00:01:06.990> this<00:01:07.200> I

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
panel down in the car we mounted this I

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.149 
panel down in the car we mounted this I
installed<00:01:08.460> this<00:01:08.729> and<00:01:09.320> tore<00:01:10.320> apart<00:01:10.439> underneath

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
installed this and tore apart underneath

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:27.770 
installed this and tore apart underneath
the<00:01:11.280> dash<00:01:25.640> this<00:01:26.640> hole<00:01:26.880> was<00:01:27.150> in<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.540> fender

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
the dash this hole was in the fender

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.319 
the dash this hole was in the fender
well<00:01:28.400> so<00:01:29.400> we<00:01:29.549> had<00:01:29.700> to<00:01:29.759> take<00:01:29.909> off<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.299> plastic

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
well so we had to take off the plastic

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.960 
well so we had to take off the plastic
fender<00:01:31.020> well<00:01:31.259> piece<00:01:31.670> obviously<00:01:32.670> pull<00:01:32.850> his

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
fender well piece obviously pull his

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.300 
fender well piece obviously pull his
wheel<00:01:33.180> out<00:01:33.210> and<00:01:33.659> then<00:01:34.290> we<00:01:34.409> found<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:34.770> hole<00:01:34.979> and

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
wheel out and then we found the hole and

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:41.810 
wheel out and then we found the hole and
ran<00:01:35.610> it<00:01:35.729> through<00:01:35.909> there<00:01:36.119> so<00:01:40.610> that's<00:01:41.610> how<00:01:41.759> we

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
ran it through there so that's how we

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:48.980 
ran it through there so that's how we
achieve<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:43.399> boost<00:01:44.399> gauge<00:01:47.329> we<00:01:48.329> have<00:01:48.570> pictures

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
achieve the boost gauge we have pictures

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.899 
achieve the boost gauge we have pictures
of<00:01:49.110> it<00:01:49.259> I<00:01:49.500> don't<00:01:50.159> know<00:01:50.220> if<00:01:50.310> we<00:01:50.369> have<00:01:50.460> lived<00:01:50.670> that

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
of it I don't know if we have lived that

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.149 
of it I don't know if we have lived that
we<00:01:51.600> have<00:01:51.689> lived<00:01:51.869> for<00:01:52.200> many<00:01:52.290> months<00:01:52.470> the

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
we have lived for many months the

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.450 
we have lived for many months the
pictures<00:01:53.869> of<00:01:54.869> the<00:01:55.049> install<00:01:55.380> I<00:01:55.590> don't<00:01:55.950> think<00:01:56.100> so

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
pictures of the install I don't think so

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.399 
pictures of the install I don't think so
well<00:01:57.360> anyway<00:01:57.600> it's<00:01:57.719> pretty<00:01:57.840> straightforward

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
well anyway it's pretty straightforward

00:01:58.409 --> 00:01:59.420 
well anyway it's pretty straightforward
you<00:01:58.439> just<00:01:58.590> had<00:01:58.710> a<00:01:58.740> client<00:01:58.950> holes<00:01:59.219> in<00:01:59.369> the

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
you just had a client holes in the

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.670 
you just had a client holes in the
firewall<00:01:59.820> and<00:02:00.060> stuff<00:02:01.020> that<00:02:01.200> won't<00:02:01.320> pinch

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
firewall and stuff that won't pinch

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.969 
firewall and stuff that won't pinch
other<00:02:02.369> places<00:02:02.700> cuz<00:02:02.939> they<00:02:03.060> have<00:02:03.180> a<00:02:03.210> lot<00:02:03.360> of<00:02:03.979> yeah

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
other places cuz they have a lot of yeah

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.190 
other places cuz they have a lot of yeah
wires<00:02:05.700> and<00:02:05.939> stuff<00:02:06.030> running<00:02:06.390> through<00:02:06.659> there<00:02:06.869> so

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
wires and stuff running through there so

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.910 
wires and stuff running through there so
just<00:02:07.829> try<00:02:08.039> and<00:02:08.099> find<00:02:08.340> a<00:02:08.429> spot

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
just try and find a spot

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.570 
just try and find a spot
and<00:02:10.759> I<00:02:11.060> kind<00:02:11.300> of<00:02:11.360> have<00:02:11.480> a<00:02:11.510> mess<00:02:11.810> here<00:02:12.400> this<00:02:13.400> is

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
and I kind of have a mess here this is

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.570 
and I kind of have a mess here this is
where<00:02:13.730> our<00:02:13.850> boost<00:02:14.090> line<00:02:14.360> is<00:02:14.569> and<00:02:15.190> it<00:02:16.190> connects

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
where our boost line is and it connects

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.930 
where our boost line is and it connects
to<00:02:16.700> the<00:02:16.910> intake<00:02:17.180> manifold<00:02:17.720> this<00:02:18.530> line<00:02:18.950> goes<00:02:19.700> up

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
to the intake manifold this line goes up

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.780 
to the intake manifold this line goes up
to<00:02:20.060> this<00:02:20.180> hose<00:02:20.420> which<00:02:21.350> is<00:02:21.500> connected<00:02:21.980> up<00:02:22.340> here

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
to this hose which is connected up here

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.390 
to this hose which is connected up here
and<00:02:22.970> it<00:02:23.750> tees<00:02:23.959> into<00:02:24.170> this<00:02:24.410> hose<00:02:24.650> which<00:02:25.040> goes<00:02:25.280> to

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
and it tees into this hose which goes to

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.790 
and it tees into this hose which goes to
the<00:02:25.490> brake<00:02:25.700> booster<00:02:25.880> and<00:02:26.380> to<00:02:27.380> the<00:02:27.500> intake

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
the brake booster and to the intake

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.680 
the brake booster and to the intake
manifold<00:02:28.310> so<00:02:28.459> it's<00:02:28.610> kind<00:02:28.820> of<00:02:28.880> complicated<00:02:29.209> the

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
manifold so it's kind of complicated the

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.170 
manifold so it's kind of complicated the
way<00:02:29.780> my<00:02:29.990> setup<00:02:30.290> is<00:02:30.530> but<00:02:30.890> all<00:02:31.550> you<00:02:31.850> need<00:02:31.880> to<00:02:32.090> do

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
way my setup is but all you need to do

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.150 
way my setup is but all you need to do
is<00:02:32.270> get<00:02:32.420> a<00:02:32.450> vacuum<00:02:32.720> source<00:02:33.020> from<00:02:33.440> the<00:02:33.770> intake

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
is get a vacuum source from the intake

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.850 
is get a vacuum source from the intake
manifold<00:02:34.610> hook<00:02:35.209> it<00:02:35.360> up<00:02:35.470> we're<00:02:36.470> going<00:02:36.560> to<00:02:36.620> do<00:02:36.739> is

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
manifold hook it up we're going to do is

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.580 
manifold hook it up we're going to do is
go<00:02:37.010> ahead<00:02:37.160> and<00:02:37.870> videotape<00:02:38.870> when<00:02:39.170> you<00:02:39.290> start<00:02:39.500> up

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
go ahead and videotape when you start up

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.400 
go ahead and videotape when you start up
the<00:02:39.680> car<00:02:39.860> what<00:02:40.100> the<00:02:40.130> boost<00:02:40.400> gauge<00:02:40.550> does<00:02:40.850> and

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
the car what the boost gauge does and

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.479 
the car what the boost gauge does and
I'll<00:02:42.410> show<00:02:42.590> you<00:02:42.680> what<00:02:42.830> it<00:02:42.920> does<00:02:43.040> when<00:02:43.250> it's<00:02:43.400> in

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:43.489 
I'll show you what it does when it's in

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:47.110 
I'll show you what it does when it's in
boost<00:02:43.730> and<00:02:43.940> what's<00:02:44.090> not<00:02:45.730> right<00:02:46.730> now<00:02:46.850> you're<00:02:47.000> at

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
boost and what's not right now you're at

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.220 
boost and what's not right now you're at
a<00:02:47.150> negative<00:02:47.680> 34<00:02:48.680> pounds<00:02:48.860> of<00:02:49.100> boost<00:02:50.140> when<00:02:51.140> you

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
a negative 34 pounds of boost when you

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.370 
a negative 34 pounds of boost when you
give<00:02:51.410> it<00:02:51.560> gas<00:02:51.709> it's<00:02:52.250> gonna<00:02:52.430> want<00:02:52.730> to<00:02:52.820> creep<00:02:53.030> up

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
give it gas it's gonna want to creep up

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:56.560 
give it gas it's gonna want to creep up
just<00:02:54.380> like<00:02:54.530> so<00:02:54.880> it's<00:02:55.880> good<00:02:56.090> it<00:02:56.150> just<00:02:56.390> measures

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:56.570 
just like so it's good it just measures

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:58.570 
just like so it's good it just measures
the<00:02:56.810> amount<00:02:56.870> of<00:02:57.080> vacuum<00:02:57.260> inside<00:02:57.620> the<00:02:57.680> line<00:02:57.950> so

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 
the amount of vacuum inside the line so

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.520 
the amount of vacuum inside the line so
when<00:02:58.760> you're<00:02:58.910> at<00:02:59.030> positive<00:02:59.540> boost<00:02:59.720> it's<00:03:00.320> going

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
when you're at positive boost it's going

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.470 
when you're at positive boost it's going
to<00:03:00.590> go<00:03:00.680> past<00:03:00.920> the<00:03:01.040> zero<00:03:01.310> which<00:03:01.519> is<00:03:01.640> here<00:03:01.880> it's

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
to go past the zero which is here it's

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.390 
to go past the zero which is here it's
going<00:03:02.630> to<00:03:02.690> go<00:03:02.810> on<00:03:02.959> this<00:03:03.200> side<00:03:03.530> of<00:03:03.560> the<00:03:03.830> zero<00:03:04.100> so

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
going to go on this side of the zero so

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.560 
going to go on this side of the zero so
right<00:03:04.550> now<00:03:04.670> we're<00:03:04.790> on<00:03:04.850> a<00:03:04.910> negative<00:03:05.330> so<00:03:05.450> it's

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:05.570 
right now we're on a negative so it's

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:06.850 
right now we're on a negative so it's
going<00:03:05.660> to<00:03:05.720> creep<00:03:05.900> the<00:03:06.050> signs<00:03:06.290> of<00:03:06.470> the<00:03:06.530> for<00:03:06.800> the

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
going to creep the signs of the for the

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.340 
going to creep the signs of the for the
positive<00:03:07.310> week<00:03:08.090> more<00:03:08.660> or<00:03:08.690> less<00:03:08.870> can't<00:03:09.110> do<00:03:09.230> that

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.350 
positive week more or less can't do that

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:10.750 
positive week more or less can't do that
right<00:03:09.530> now<00:03:09.680> and<00:03:09.860> unless<00:03:10.010> we're<00:03:10.220> in<00:03:10.340> we<00:03:10.610> have<00:03:10.730> a

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
right now and unless we're in we have a

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:19.160 
right now and unless we're in we have a
load<00:03:11.030> on<00:03:11.269> the<00:03:11.450> turbo<00:03:11.780> itself

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:27.600 

that's<00:03:20.170> what<00:03:20.380> this<00:03:20.650> games<00:03:20.980> done<00:03:26.550> thanks<00:03:27.550> for
