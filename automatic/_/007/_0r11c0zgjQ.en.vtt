we<00:01:45.380> are<00:01:45.530> going<00:01:45.680> to<00:01:45.740> make<00:01:45.860> a<00:01:45.890> chain<00:01:46.370> of<00:01:46.400> sorts<00:01:47.030> so

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
we are going to make a chain of sorts so

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.570 
we are going to make a chain of sorts so
I'm<00:01:47.960> starting<00:01:48.410> in<00:01:48.560> with<00:01:48.740> my<00:01:49.010> striping<00:01:49.490> brush

I'm starting in with my striping brush

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.660 
I'm starting in with my striping brush
like<00:01:49.820> this<00:01:50.060> and<00:01:50.360> looping<00:01:51.290> around<00:01:51.440> all<00:01:52.130> of<00:01:52.190> the

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
like this and looping around all of the

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:59.290 
like this and looping around all of the
time<00:01:55.840> and<00:01:57.400> then<00:01:58.400> the<00:01:58.580> chain<00:01:58.820> is<00:01:58.970> going<00:01:59.119> to<00:01:59.180> go

00:01:59.290 --> 00:01:59.300 
time and then the chain is going to go

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:04.690 
time and then the chain is going to go
down<00:01:59.690> and<00:02:00.820> it<00:02:01.820> is<00:02:01.850> going<00:02:02.119> to<00:02:02.630> turn<00:02:03.410> around<00:02:03.700> like

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
down and it is going to turn around like

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:15.010 
down and it is going to turn around like
this<00:02:07.570> and<00:02:08.590> I'm<00:02:09.590> going<00:02:09.800> to<00:02:09.860> put<00:02:10.039> the<00:02:10.160> chain<00:02:14.020> like

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
this and I'm going to put the chain like

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:21.040 
this and I'm going to put the chain like
this<00:02:17.230> and<00:02:18.670> then<00:02:19.670> go<00:02:19.940> around<00:02:20.150> see<00:02:20.690> how<00:02:20.810> I<00:02:20.840> did

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
this and then go around see how I did

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:22.750 
this and then go around see how I did
