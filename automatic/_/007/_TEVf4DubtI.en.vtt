00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
on out here before the tub gets into

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.040 
on out here before the tub gets into
place<00:00:29.220> this<00:00:29.910> is<00:00:30.090> the<00:00:30.119> drain<00:00:30.510> where<00:00:30.779> the<00:00:30.869> water

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
place this is the drain where the water

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.229 
place this is the drain where the water
leaves<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.529> tub<00:00:31.769> and<00:00:32.070> this<00:00:32.700> is<00:00:32.820> actually<00:00:33.149> the

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
leaves the tub and this is actually the

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.060 
leaves the tub and this is actually the
overflows<00:00:33.780> designed<00:00:34.260> to<00:00:34.380> be<00:00:34.469> open<00:00:34.829> all<00:00:34.950> the

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
overflows designed to be open all the

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.830 
overflows designed to be open all the
time<00:00:35.280> should<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.670> stopper<00:00:36.149> ever<00:00:36.300> be<00:00:36.480> in<00:00:36.570> place

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
time should the stopper ever be in place

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.150 
time should the stopper ever be in place
and<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:37.410> tub<00:00:37.620> was<00:00:37.770> going<00:00:37.890> to<00:00:37.950> overflow

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
and the tub was going to overflow

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.920 
and the tub was going to overflow
wouldn't<00:00:38.579> go<00:00:38.640> on<00:00:38.790> to<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:38.969> floor<00:00:39.210> right<00:00:39.450> all

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
wouldn't go on to the floor right all

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.470 
wouldn't go on to the floor right all
right<00:00:40.020> so<00:00:40.170> this<00:00:40.260> is<00:00:40.320> going<00:00:40.440> to<00:00:40.530> go<00:00:40.620> right<00:00:40.800> there

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:41.480 
right so this is going to go right there

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.819 
right so this is going to go right there
so<00:00:42.480> this<00:00:42.600> is<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:42.870> strand<00:00:43.170> that<00:00:43.320> you<00:00:43.379> see<00:00:43.680> from

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.370 
around to the studs to make up this tub
spout<00:03:09.269> connection<00:03:09.810> there's<00:03:09.989> actually<00:03:10.350> a

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
spout connection there's actually a

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.199 
spout connection there's actually a
threaded<00:03:10.890> female<00:03:11.220> connection<00:03:11.610> inside<00:03:11.970> the

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
threaded female connection inside the

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:14.600 
threaded female connection inside the
walls<00:03:12.420> another<00:03:12.690> one<00:03:12.900> right<00:03:13.080> here<00:03:13.440> so<00:03:14.100> I<00:03:14.130> had<00:03:14.459> to

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
walls another one right here so I had to

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.580 
walls another one right here so I had to
make<00:03:14.790> up<00:03:14.820> a<00:03:15.150> threaded<00:03:15.600> piece<00:03:15.989> with<00:03:16.290> male

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
make up a threaded piece with male

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.229 
make up a threaded piece with male
threads<00:03:17.010> on<00:03:17.190> each<00:03:17.340> end<00:03:17.640> out<00:03:17.820> of<00:03:17.970> a<00:03:18.030> piece<00:03:18.209> of

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
threads on each end out of a piece of

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:21.080 
threads on each end out of a piece of
copper<00:03:18.720> and<00:03:18.870> two<00:03:19.050> male<00:03:19.260> adapters<00:03:19.880> so<00:03:20.880> it<00:03:20.970> has

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
copper and two male adapters so it has

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:22.820 
copper and two male adapters so it has
to<00:03:21.209> be<00:03:21.300> just<00:03:21.600> the<00:03:21.750> right<00:03:21.930> length<00:03:22.230> so<00:03:22.470> that<00:03:22.530> as<00:03:22.709> I

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830 
to be just the right length so that as I

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:25.430 
to be just the right length so that as I
tighten<00:03:23.250> it<00:03:23.310> up<00:03:23.540> it<00:03:24.540> holds<00:03:24.989> that<00:03:25.080> spout

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
tighten it up it holds that spout

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:37.009 
tighten it up it holds that spout
against<00:03:25.860> the<00:03:25.950> tub<00:03:26.160> wall<00:03:32.060> good<00:03:35.720> this<00:03:36.720> chrome

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
against the tub wall good this chrome

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:40.039 
against the tub wall good this chrome
strain<00:03:37.350> it<00:03:37.500> will<00:03:37.590> cover<00:03:37.799> the<00:03:37.950> drain<00:03:39.049> instead

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:40.049 
strain it will cover the drain instead

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:41.810 
strain it will cover the drain instead
of<00:03:40.170> making<00:03:40.380> a<00:03:40.470> patch<00:03:40.709> that<00:03:40.739> fits<00:03:41.220> its<00:03:41.400> opening

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:41.820 
of making a patch that fits its opening

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:44.080 
of making a patch that fits its opening
perfectly<00:03:42.329> we're<00:03:42.600> going<00:03:42.840> to<00:03:42.900> take<00:03:43.170> a<00:03:43.410> patch

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.090 
perfectly we're going to take a patch

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:48.199 
perfectly we're going to take a patch
and<00:03:45.090> make<00:03:45.390> the<00:03:45.540> opening<00:03:46.049> fit<00:03:46.709> it<00:03:47.070> a<00:03:47.370> little

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
and make the opening fit it a little

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:51.440 
and make the opening fit it a little
oversized<00:03:48.690> and<00:03:49.110> then<00:03:49.410> just<00:03:49.890> trace<00:03:50.430> it<00:03:50.640> all

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
oversized and then just trace it all

00:03:51.450 --> 00:04:02.140 
oversized and then just trace it all
right<00:03:51.810> now<00:03:52.140> our<00:03:52.440> patch<00:03:53.480> should<00:03:54.480> fit<00:03:54.810> perfectly
