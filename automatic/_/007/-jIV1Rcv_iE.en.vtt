make<00:02:36.060> sure<00:02:36.269> it<00:02:36.389> gets<00:02:36.510> in<00:02:36.980> most<00:02:37.980> of<00:02:38.099> the<00:02:38.159> places

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
make sure it gets in most of the places

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.149 
make sure it gets in most of the places
and<00:02:38.700> you<00:02:39.269> can<00:02:39.420> also<00:02:39.569> do<00:02:39.840> it<00:02:39.930> in<00:02:39.989> the<00:02:40.049> back<00:02:40.349> spray

00:02:41.149 --> 00:02:41.159 
and you can also do it in the back spray

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:43.479 
and you can also do it in the back spray
it<00:02:41.219> in<00:02:41.340> the<00:02:41.400> back<00:02:41.609> um<00:02:41.939> if<00:02:42.239> you<00:02:42.299> get<00:02:42.450> oily<00:02:42.780> there

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:43.489

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:56.030 
but I think I'm okay so you just massage
it<00:02:49.290> in<00:02:49.530> really<00:02:49.739> good
