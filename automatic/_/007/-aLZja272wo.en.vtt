00:00:00.399 --> 00:00:05.720
 I came here a thousand kilometers I have other options I was 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:06.820
 no coma 

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:11.320
 Canada could have done a master there I could have got him right in 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:14.320
 America can do or in England as if I had for important 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:19.199
 Although has heard and that has been confirmed in the what exactly 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:20.119
 and stops 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:22.529
 70 on 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.099
 strong and can 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:30.380
 I can be inspired by philosophy though I economics its 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:31.749
 and that's it 

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:34.749
 really quiet in the word 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:40.649
 Lahr around that is APA 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.030
 a recent one 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:51.120
 Dr already yesterday I had once reached developers can on a fax 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.720
 the PS carpet 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.700
 I think even more 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:58.030
 but also comics represented the US 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.430
 in Europe, one I brought 

00:01:02.639 --> 00:01:03.959
 ARD 

00:01:03.959 --> 00:01:05.890
 Picture rtr here 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.620
 Dr as the main actor 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:11.780
 until the end of the euro he has 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.380
 the municipalities received "will be a result 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.730
 we had to go with other students 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:21.810
 and so the court continues with 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.810
 six others are different 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:28.760
 Hamilton 3 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.070
 the director himself 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.070
 set priorities in some homes 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.770
 a real one 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.770
 in its place it is for me 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.300
 me not that me free decision though 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:49.890
 there is not enough for me in this place is as a percent 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.100
 studying consequences of conflict actually lives 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.420
 that means we are all very different are very diverse 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.470
 and that actually makes you anew every day 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.110
 with what other person but life perspectives but way of life 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:04.200
 confronted 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.500
 and there one admits Christmas Eve in the constant process to itself 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:08.499
 changed honestly 

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:12.069
 and that is one or me is completely for the final score 

00:02:14.469 --> 00:02:17.469
 these and many interesting tracks 

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:21.259
 Dr 

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:27.979
 she carries a happy ending the first three 6 and how intense the discussion itself 

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:29.509
 NHL 

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:32.509
 my hero 

00:02:34.589 --> 00:02:35.679
 on 

00:02:35.679 --> 00:02:37.240
 what is it? 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.339
 van Gaal 

00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:41.109
 Link to OnlineReports 

00:02:41.109 --> 00:02:43.209
 meanwhile he warns 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:46.539
 what it's about and scored goals younger 

00:02:46.539 --> 00:02:47.850
 or RLV 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.850
 47 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:55.239
 the special thing about this place is that we have one in each game 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:56.919
 Torn ligament in the ankle 

00:02:56.919 --> 00:03:00.909
 Regardless of whether tuition fees are no matter what the conception of the degree programs 

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:04.679
 No matter what the development of your own faculty is also still on 

00:03:04.679 --> 00:03:08.169
 a high level to reduce the commission 

00:03:08.169 --> 00:03:13.279
 All but why should not we even backed the title are as well 

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:17.689
 with project is a twittering 

00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:20.739
 just checked before everyone thinks for themselves 

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:23.539
 often bring everyone 

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:26.159
 first on an island of Dr 

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:29.139
 That's what next percent I want 

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:32.139
 the sausage goes 

00:03:32.809 --> 00:03:35.530
 the most important thing is not what keeps those high 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:37.939
 already in the 4 the people here 

00:03:37.939 --> 00:03:39.239
 but do not give 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:42.400
 and I find that very popular and distinctive 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:47.679
 no matter if it's good or bad 

00:03:47.679 --> 00:03:50.679
 Here is the eldest son of Adolf Hitler 

00:03:53.439 --> 00:03:54.610
 I train here 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:58.410
 because there are no other universities the trader himself goes on in the 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:01.410
 Take care of the graduates 

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:05.499
 How can I think about other people 

00:04:05.499 --> 00:04:08.499
 and I just wrote 

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:34.179
