00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
same thing on the opposite side grand a

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.220 
same thing on the opposite side grand a
defense<00:02:51.260> middle<00:02:52.040> wheel<00:02:52.690> it<00:02:53.690> looks<00:02:53.959> like<00:02:54.140> it

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
defense middle wheel it looks like it

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.940 
defense middle wheel it looks like it
would<00:02:54.290> be<00:02:54.470> OK<00:02:54.860> for<00:02:54.920> defense<00:02:55.370> but<00:02:56.680> it's<00:02:57.680> kind<00:02:57.890> of

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
would be OK for defense but it's kind of

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:07.080 
would be OK for defense but it's kind of
hollow<00:02:58.160> on<00:02:58.790> the<00:02:58.820> inside<00:03:00.100> so<00:03:01.100> maybe<00:03:01.519> not

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.890 

and<00:03:08.489> WG<00:03:09.489> which<00:03:09.700> stands<00:03:10.000> for<00:03:10.150> a<00:03:10.300> wide<00:03:10.510> defense

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
and WG which stands for a wide defense

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.400 
and WG which stands for a wide defense
it's<00:03:11.200> almost<00:03:11.860> like<00:03:12.130> Edie<00:03:12.610> but<00:03:13.030> the<00:03:13.510> wings<00:03:14.050> are

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
it's almost like Edie but the wings are

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:19.380 
it's almost like Edie but the wings are
fixed<00:03:15.959> so<00:03:16.959> it<00:03:17.110> doesn't<00:03:17.500> loose<00:03:18.040> nor<00:03:19.030> you<00:03:19.360> can

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
fixed so it doesn't loose nor you can

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:22.229 
fixed so it doesn't loose nor you can
take<00:03:20.050> out<00:03:20.260> the<00:03:20.739> wings<00:03:21.580> or<00:03:21.819> anything<00:03:21.970> like<00:03:22.150> that

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
take out the wings or anything like that

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:26.460 
take out the wings or anything like that
so<00:03:22.599> yeah<00:03:24.030> so<00:03:25.030> it's<00:03:25.060> very<00:03:25.300> similar<00:03:25.599> to<00:03:25.750> Eve<00:03:26.019> Edie

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
so yeah so it's very similar to Eve Edie

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:29.009 
so yeah so it's very similar to Eve Edie
but<00:03:27.069> it's<00:03:27.580> fixed<00:03:28.060> it<00:03:28.209> doesn't<00:03:28.510> move<00:03:28.630> it's<00:03:28.930> not

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:29.019 
but it's fixed it doesn't move it's not

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:32.550 
but it's fixed it doesn't move it's not

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:43.590 
rubber sharp which is the part I really
really<00:03:35.470> want<00:03:37.830> great<00:03:38.830> for<00:03:39.690> defense<00:03:40.690> but<00:03:41.190> it<00:03:42.600> has

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:43.600 
really want great for defense but it has

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:48.420 
really want great for defense but it has
really<00:03:44.080> bad<00:03:44.440> stamina<00:03:47.250> yeah

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
really bad stamina yeah

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.440 
really bad stamina yeah
it's<00:03:48.549> I'd<00:03:49.390> still<00:03:49.720> use<00:03:49.900> it<00:03:50.049> though<00:03:50.170> it<00:03:50.350> it

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
it's I'd still use it though it it

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:55.229 
it's I'd still use it though it it
reduces<00:03:52.450> recoil<00:03:52.989> and<00:03:53.709> it<00:03:53.950> basically<00:03:54.580> makes

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:55.239 
reduces recoil and it basically makes

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:58.789 
reduces recoil and it basically makes
the<00:03:55.360> big<00:03:55.630> weight<00:03:55.840> of<00:03:55.989> rock<00:03:56.230> so<00:03:56.769> a<00:03:57.160> really<00:03:58.060> good

00:03:58.789 --> 00:03:58.799 
the big weight of rock so a really good

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:03.839 
the big weight of rock so a really good
defensive<00:03:59.799> bottom<00:04:00.510> but<00:04:01.510> I'd<00:04:01.930> prefer<00:04:02.260> CS<00:04:03.160> over

00:04:03.839 --> 00:04:03.849 
defensive bottom but I'd prefer CS over

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:07.259
