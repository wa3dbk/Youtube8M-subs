 in this dispute absolutely nemo what 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.790
 last December when in Russia

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:23.170
 iphone 5 connected operator threw out 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:25.269
 unexpected trick and put on the smartphone 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.610

 authorized resellers in the same year 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:31.510
 a similar prank decided to take 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:32.170
 and another official dealer of the company 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.810

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:52.780
 smartphone leaving the flagship price tag without 

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:55.299
 changes in the American smartphone market 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.620
 For a long time remained one of the most 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:58.750
 priority for apple 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:01.389
 however, last year, the apple began 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:04.540
 large-scale expansion into Asian countries 

00:04:01.389 --> 00:04:08.260
 in order to increase sales of iphone in China 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:11.040
 japan and india and it bore fruit 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:14.290
 In September, the share of iphone in Japan reached 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.700
 37 percent for comparison is similar 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:19.389
 rate for the US market 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:21.039
 is 36 percent if the company 

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:22.810
 keep current growth in 

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:25.720
 next year, its share in the Japanese market 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:28.030
 smartphones will be above 50 percent 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:30.160
 sounds promising because 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:33.220
 Japan is the fourth largest 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:35.940
 the smart phone market in the world after china usa 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:35.940
 and india 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:43.990

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:52.300
 the third quarter of 2014 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:54.550
 according to journalists engineers 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:58.030
 corporations will equip your smartphone with screens 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:05:00.699
 4.7 inches and five and a half 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:02.699
 inches apart from this both devices 

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:04.720
 will get special sensors 

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:07.270
 touches that can determine 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:09.400
 degree of clicking on the smartphone display 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:11.680
 such a sensor is very useful for 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:14.500
 avoid accidental application launches 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:17.530
 after clicking on the side of the screen but 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:17.979
 the most important thing of course is curved 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:19.599
 display 

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:21.490

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:27.280
 iphone 5s and iphone 5c 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:30.270
 However, in practice, this technology is still 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:35.970
 was never implemented 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:37.950
