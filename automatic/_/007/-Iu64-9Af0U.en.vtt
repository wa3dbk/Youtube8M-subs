00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.250
 [Music] 

00:00:02.139 --> 00:00:06.170
 Hello 

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:08.330
 besides the recipes that you left me 

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:10.340
 on facebook look to see and cook in 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:12.230
 direct to the palate and in the bag of 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:15.080
 desserts but since I did not feel like using 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:17.720
 raw egg at the end type this in your 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.360
 mental and tiramisu in google and I found 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:22.419
 a recipe that is the one I'm going to prepare 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:24.890
 [Music] 

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:27.470
 The first thing we are going to do is chop 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:29.990
 the chocolate 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:32.180
 keep in mind that I'm going to do the 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:35.920
 recipe for two people but I leave you 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.920
 the ingredients for 4 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.990
 once chopped we reserve them in the 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.380
 fridge 

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:45.680
 [Music] 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:48.620
 We are going to mix 100 ml of liquid cream 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:51.680
 with 50 grams of sugar and we're going to 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:54.240
 make in a saucepan on very low heat until 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.050
 that the sugar is completely dissolved 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.100
 [Music] 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:03.899
 Y 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:03.899
 [Music] 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:27.770
 then we assemble the rest of the cream 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:30.869
 [Music] 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:33.149
 and we also reserve it and then we go 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.770
 to work the mascarpone it's about going 

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:36.990
 removing it so that it takes a little 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:40.429
 of heat and then it is easier to mix it 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.429
 with the rest of the ingredients 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:58.070
 [Music] 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:02:01.010
 we add the whipped cream and we're going 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.880
 mixing well without beating to continue 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:07.920
 being very fluffy 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.920
 [Music] 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.800
 then add the cream in which 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:19.520
 we had dissolved the sugar 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.520
 Y 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:38.480
 [Music] 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:41.000
 and finally we add 4 tablespoons of 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.350
 coffee and I recommend you try this 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:03:00.300
 mixture is very good 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:03:03.010
 [Music] 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:06.550
 Now let's soak the biscuits of 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:09.160
 soletilla in coffee and if you feel like you can 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:14.200
 put a little rum or amaretto that 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:16.390
 it is totally to taste we soak the 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.580
 biscuits if they are very fresh 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:20.710
 you will have to withdraw soon because if not 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:22.780
 they will all break and put them in a 

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:25.600
 container if it is the same one in which 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.820
 will serve is not necessary but if 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:36.460
 you want to unmold it is very good to cover it 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:40.170
 with transparent film after the layer 

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:48.360
 of biscuits we add the mixture 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:48.360
 [Music] 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:54.280
 instead of cocoa powder put the 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.700
 little pieces of chocolate and you'll see how 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.700
 noticeable 

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.990
 Y 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:11.020
 another layer of biscuits 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:12.850
 [Music] 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:22.290
 again the mixture 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:24.850
 [Music] 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:30.260
 and a little more chocolate 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:34.169
 [Music] 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:35.710
 and this is ready to see what you think 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:56.970
 a hug until then 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:56.970
 [Music]
