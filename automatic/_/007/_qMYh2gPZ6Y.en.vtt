it a drought resistant plant but you

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.120 
it a drought resistant plant but you
will<00:00:30.090> get<00:00:30.269> a<00:00:30.300> greener<00:00:30.689> less<00:00:31.109> your<00:00:31.349> foliage<00:00:31.830> if

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
will get a greener less your foliage if

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.819 
will get a greener less your foliage if
you<00:00:32.730> look<00:00:33.000> here<00:00:33.420> this<00:00:33.660> is<00:00:33.899> in<00:00:34.079> a<00:00:34.170> very<00:00:34.410> dry

you look here this is in a very dry
setting<00:00:35.430> and<00:00:35.670> even<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.630> plant<00:00:36.930> looks<00:00:37.200> kind<00:00:37.500> of

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
setting and even the plant looks kind of

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.220 
setting and even the plant looks kind of
dusty<00:00:38.100> but<00:00:38.340> it's<00:00:38.489> also<00:00:38.700> a<00:00:38.910> multi<00:00:39.540> trunk<00:00:39.989> or

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
shrub type of habit of growth and that's

shrub type of habit of growth and that's
one<00:00:46.079> of<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.350> ways<00:00:46.530> you<00:00:46.590> can<00:00:47.100> get<00:00:47.280> this<00:00:47.550> tree

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
one of the ways you can get this tree

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.560 
one of the ways you can get this tree
this<00:00:49.710> is<00:00:49.770> a<00:00:49.950> close-up<00:00:50.280> of<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.760> foliage<00:00:51.239> as

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
this is a close-up of the foliage as

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.380 
this is a close-up of the foliage as
well<00:00:51.989> as<00:00:52.199> some<00:00:52.440> of<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:52.649> berries<00:00:53.219> they<00:00:53.969> bloom

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
well as some of the berries they bloom

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.080 
well as some of the berries they bloom
in<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:55.170> winter<00:00:55.590> in<00:00:55.920> our<00:00:56.129> area<00:00:56.520> in<00:00:56.640> Northern

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
in the winter in our area in Northern

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.889 
in the winter in our area in Northern
California<00:00:57.270> and<00:00:58.109> then<00:00:58.289> we<00:00:58.410> get<00:00:58.530> a<00:00:58.590> small

00:00:59.889 --> 00:00:59.899 
California and then we get a small

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:03.770 
California and then we get a small
brownish<00:01:00.899> berry<00:01:01.440> which<00:01:02.219> I'm<00:01:02.489> told<00:01:02.850> can<00:01:03.359> turn

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
brownish berry which I'm told can turn

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.880 
brownish berry which I'm told can turn
into<00:01:04.019> a<00:01:05.000> seedling<00:01:06.000> so<00:01:06.420> you<00:01:07.350> probably<00:01:07.680> don't

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
into a seedling so you probably don't

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.670 
into a seedling so you probably don't
want<00:01:08.430> to<00:01:08.490> have<00:01:08.729> this<00:01:09.000> in<00:01:09.270> areas<00:01:09.510> where<00:01:10.020> it

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
want to have this in areas where it

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.380 
want to have this in areas where it
could<00:01:10.860> easily<00:01:11.130> go<00:01:11.580> to<00:01:11.610> seed<00:01:12.060> and<00:01:13.700> although<00:01:14.700> I

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
could easily go to seed and although I

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.480 
could easily go to seed and although I
haven't<00:01:15.630> really<00:01:16.080> seen<00:01:16.350> that<00:01:16.409> happen<00:01:17.100> here<00:01:17.340> in

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
haven't really seen that happen here in

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.020 
haven't really seen that happen here in
Northern<00:01:17.880> California<00:01:18.090> it<00:01:18.810> could<00:01:19.080> be<00:01:19.290> that<00:01:19.500> the

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
Northern California it could be that the

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.550 
Northern California it could be that the
are<00:01:21.030> colder<00:01:21.540> temperatures<00:01:22.140> in<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.439> winter

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
are colder temperatures in the winter

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.460 
are colder temperatures in the winter
have<00:01:23.100> a<00:01:23.130> bearing<00:01:23.700> on<00:01:23.850> that<00:01:24.240> so<00:01:25.110> what<00:01:25.320> you're

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
have a bearing on that so what you're

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.830 
have a bearing on that so what you're
looking<00:01:25.619> at<00:01:25.979> here<00:01:26.040> is<00:01:26.729> a<00:01:26.810> a<00:01:27.810> low<00:01:28.740> branching

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
looking at here is a a low branching

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.870 
looking at here is a a low branching
setup<00:01:30.840> you<00:01:31.170> see<00:01:31.409> two<00:01:31.799> or<00:01:31.979> three<00:01:32.280> here<00:01:32.640> and<00:01:32.790> a

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
setup you see two or three here and a

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.109 
setup you see two or three here and a
grouping<00:01:33.390> and<00:01:33.650> the<00:01:34.650> maintenance<00:01:35.400> company<00:01:35.909> has

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
grouping and the maintenance company has

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.060 
grouping and the maintenance company has
done<00:01:36.329> a<00:01:36.360> nice<00:01:36.600> job<00:01:36.710> pruning<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.860> lower

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
done a nice job pruning the lower

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.640 
done a nice job pruning the lower
branches<00:01:38.729> out<00:01:38.939> to<00:01:39.180> clean<00:01:39.479> them<00:01:39.780> and<00:01:40.320> give<00:01:40.619> a

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
branches out to clean them and give a

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.020 
branches out to clean them and give a
nice<00:01:41.009> open<00:01:41.729> head<00:01:42.979> even<00:01:43.979> with<00:01:44.189> that<00:01:44.399> pruning

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
nice open head even with that pruning

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.749 
nice open head even with that pruning
you<00:01:45.210> get<00:01:45.390> a<00:01:45.420> nice<00:01:45.689> full<00:01:46.049> head<00:01:47.009> on<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.430> plant

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
you get a nice full head on the plant

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.090 
you get a nice full head on the plant
but<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.240> inside<00:01:48.810> branching<00:01:49.470> structure<00:01:50.009> has

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
but the inside branching structure has

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.789 
but the inside branching structure has
been<00:01:50.130> opened<00:01:50.790> up<00:01:50.970> as<00:01:51.180> have<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.750> lower<00:01:51.960> 3<00:01:52.439> to<00:01:52.590> 5

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
been opened up as have the lower 3 to 5

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.639 
been opened up as have the lower 3 to 5
feet<00:01:52.829> of<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:54.000> plant<00:01:54.329> and<00:01:54.689> I<00:01:54.930> really<00:01:55.229> like<00:01:55.409> this

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
feet of the plant and I really like this

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.429 
feet of the plant and I really like this
use<00:01:56.009> of<00:01:56.119> Russa<00:01:57.119> lancia<00:01:57.570> it's<00:01:57.810> a<00:01:57.869> good<00:01:58.140> look

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
use of Russa lancia it's a good look

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.020 
use of Russa lancia it's a good look
this<00:01:58.770> is<00:01:58.979> in<00:01:59.130> a<00:01:59.250> small<00:01:59.579> neighborhood<00:01:59.850> park<00:02:00.570> and

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
this is in a small neighborhood park and

this is in a small neighborhood park and
you<00:02:03.030> can<00:02:03.240> see<00:02:03.509> here<00:02:03.869> this<00:02:04.049> is<00:02:04.259> so<00:02:04.829> here's<00:02:05.430> what

I<00:02:05.670> like<00:02:05.909> about<00:02:06.090> Bruce<00:02:06.840> Lancia<00:02:07.469> as<00:02:07.740> a<00:02:07.770> design

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
I like about Bruce Lancia as a design

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.930 
I like about Bruce Lancia as a design
element<00:02:09.060> it<00:02:09.750> is<00:02:09.810> an<00:02:10.170> evergreen<00:02:10.709> tree<00:02:11.400> but<00:02:11.790> it's

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
element it is an evergreen tree but it's

hundreds during the summer so we need a

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.440

certainly tolerate the hot summers it's
from<00:02:53.760> South<00:02:54.090> Africa<00:02:54.870> so<00:02:55.260> it's<00:02:55.470> used<00:02:55.769> to<00:02:55.980> that

00:02:56.119 --> 00:02:56.129

probably the best way to make sure that
this<00:03:48.930> is<00:03:49.139> a<00:03:49.169> drought<00:03:49.530> tolerant<00:03:50.159> plant<00:03:50.519> is<00:03:50.790> to

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
this is a drought tolerant plant is to

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:54.500 
this is a drought tolerant plant is to
give<00:03:51.930> it<00:03:52.079> infrequent<00:03:52.979> deep<00:03:53.430> water<00:03:53.849> like<00:03:54.180> it

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
give it infrequent deep water like it

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.909 
give it infrequent deep water like it
would<00:03:54.659> naturally<00:03:55.639> receive<00:03:56.639> and<00:03:56.879> it's<00:03:57.060> in<00:03:57.359> its

00:03:57.909 --> 00:03:57.919 
would naturally receive and it's in its

00:03:57.919 --> 00:04:00.860 
would naturally receive and it's in its
home<00:03:58.919> environment<00:03:59.639> so<00:04:00.000> if<00:04:00.269> you<00:04:00.419> want<00:04:00.629> to<00:04:00.720> make

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
home environment so if you want to make

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.050 
home environment so if you want to make
this<00:04:01.079> a<00:04:01.139> more<00:04:01.440> drought<00:04:01.769> resistant<00:04:02.430> plant<00:04:02.729> give

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
this a more drought resistant plant give

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.530 
this a more drought resistant plant give
it<00:04:03.209> infrequent<00:04:04.199> deep<00:04:04.500> watering<00:04:05.389> but<00:04:06.389> I

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
it infrequent deep watering but I

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.140 
it infrequent deep watering but I
this<00:04:07.079> isn't<00:04:07.440> a<00:04:07.500> neighborhood<00:04:08.040> park<00:04:08.400> as<00:04:08.639> I<00:04:08.790> said

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
this isn't a neighborhood park as I said

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.539 
this isn't a neighborhood park as I said
and<00:04:09.449> it's<00:04:09.599> got<00:04:09.840> a<00:04:09.870> nice<00:04:10.169> medium<00:04:10.829> green<00:04:11.129> foliage

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:11.549

the<00:04:12.389> size<00:04:12.720> is<00:04:13.109> very<00:04:13.379> controlled<00:04:14.040> this<00:04:14.340> will

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:14.579 
the size is very controlled this will

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:17.449 
the size is very controlled this will
not<00:04:14.790> outgrow<00:04:15.419> the<00:04:15.629> space<00:04:15.989> and<00:04:16.380> as<00:04:17.070> you<00:04:17.220> can<00:04:17.400> see

as<00:04:48.360> a<00:04:48.389> large<00:04:48.810> shrub<00:04:49.350> which<00:04:49.620> I've<00:04:49.889> read<00:04:50.220> that

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:50.520 
as a large shrub which I've read that

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:54.219 
as a large shrub which I've read that
some<00:04:50.789> people<00:04:51.180> grow<00:04:51.870> it<00:04:52.139> that<00:04:52.350> way

00:04:54.219 --> 00:04:54.229 
some people grow it that way

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:56.390 
some people grow it that way
typically<00:04:55.229> if<00:04:55.500> you're<00:04:55.650> using<00:04:55.889> it<00:04:56.160> in<00:04:56.250> a

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400 
typically if you're using it in a

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.180 
typically if you're using it in a
residential<00:04:57.000> or<00:04:57.690> you<00:04:58.350> know<00:04:58.470> like<00:04:58.680> here<00:04:59.009> in<00:04:59.100> a

00:04:59.180 --> 00:04:59.190 
residential or you know like here in a

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:01.129 
residential or you know like here in a
park<00:04:59.520> type<00:05:00.000> setting<00:05:00.539> you<00:05:00.690> want<00:05:00.870> some

00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:01.139 
park type setting you want some

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:03.920 
park type setting you want some
clearance<00:05:01.710> underneath<00:05:02.130> so<00:05:02.729> just<00:05:03.330> depends<00:05:03.840> on

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:03.930 
clearance underneath so just depends on

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:06.499 
clearance underneath so just depends on
what<00:05:04.199> you're<00:05:04.380> using<00:05:04.410> it<00:05:05.009> for<00:05:05.039> but<00:05:05.669> I<00:05:06.030> think

00:05:06.499 --> 00:05:06.509 
what you're using it for but I think

00:05:06.509 --> 00:05:10.760 
what you're using it for but I think
it's<00:05:06.900> a<00:05:07.050> really<00:05:07.440> good<00:05:07.650> evergreen<00:05:08.810> medium<00:05:09.810> to

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:10.770 
it's a really good evergreen medium to

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:14.779 
it's a really good evergreen medium to
small<00:05:11.430> size<00:05:11.789> tree<00:05:12.389> and<00:05:13.160> highly<00:05:14.160> recommend

00:05:14.779 --> 00:05:14.789 
small size tree and highly recommend

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:17.689 
small size tree and highly recommend
this<00:05:14.970> one<00:05:15.030> I<00:05:15.620> would<00:05:16.620> say<00:05:16.889> because<00:05:17.160> of<00:05:17.550> the

00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:17.699 
this one I would say because of the

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:21.529 
this one I would say because of the
fruit<00:05:18.090> and<00:05:18.360> the<00:05:19.169> flower<00:05:19.470> drop<00:05:19.979> I<00:05:20.280> would<00:05:20.639> avoid
