00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
this time around we're going to be doing

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.400 
this time around we're going to be doing
something<00:00:17.100> similar<00:00:17.369> but<00:00:17.699> first<00:00:18.029> oh<00:00:18.300> it's<00:00:19.020> not

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
something similar but first oh it's not

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.500 
something similar but first oh it's not
safe<00:00:19.680> that<00:00:19.710> way<00:00:20.100> I<00:00:20.340> was<00:00:20.730> digging<00:00:21.000> away<00:00:21.090> you<00:00:21.240> see

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
safe that way I was digging away you see

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.390 
safe that way I was digging away you see
when<00:00:21.720> the<00:00:21.779> whole<00:00:21.960> wall<00:00:22.199> collapsed<00:00:22.710> I<00:00:22.859> think

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
when the whole wall collapsed I think

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.130 
when the whole wall collapsed I think
there's<00:00:23.580> a<00:00:23.670> giant<00:00:23.970> cavern<00:00:24.359> underneath<00:00:24.869> now

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.900 
there's a giant cavern underneath now
but<00:00:25.650> I've<00:00:25.740> left<00:00:25.890> it<00:00:26.070> alone<00:00:26.160> because<00:00:26.640> I<00:00:26.730> don't

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
but I've left it alone because I don't

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.140 
but I've left it alone because I don't
think<00:00:27.119> there<00:00:27.240> are<00:00:27.269> any<00:00:27.390> fossils<00:00:28.019> there<00:00:28.289> and

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:29.150

underpass if you run all the way off to
the<00:01:00.270> east<00:01:00.390> I<00:01:00.840> wonder<00:01:01.079> if<00:01:01.170> this<00:01:01.289> actually<00:01:01.559> would

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
the east I wonder if this actually would

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.039 
the east I wonder if this actually would
land<00:01:02.460> underneath<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:03.180> desert<00:01:03.539> if<00:01:03.719> you<00:01:03.840> are

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
land underneath the desert if you are

land underneath the desert if you are
traveled<00:01:04.739> all<00:01:04.860> this<00:01:05.010> way<00:01:05.070> on<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.400> normal<00:01:05.670> map

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
traveled all this way on the normal map

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.250 
traveled all this way on the normal map
I<00:01:05.970> suppose<00:01:06.240> it<00:01:06.420> would<00:01:06.600> because<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:06.990> Mirage

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
I suppose it would because the Mirage

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.609 
I suppose it would because the Mirage
tower<00:01:07.590> collapsed<00:01:08.130> holding<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:09.510> other<00:01:09.780> fossil

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.060 
if you guys remember we got the claw
fossil<00:01:12.930> instead<00:01:13.260> of<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.439> root<00:01:13.590> fossil<00:01:14.040> the
