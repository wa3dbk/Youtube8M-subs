nice<00:02:15.210> guess<00:02:15.480> and<00:02:15.690> see<00:02:15.810> it's<00:02:15.960> copying<00:02:17.390> and<00:02:19.850> this

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.800 
nice guess and see it's copying and this
should<00:02:21.030> take<00:02:21.210> less<00:02:21.420> than<00:02:21.450> 10<00:02:22.020> seconds<00:02:22.380> to<00:02:22.650> copy

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
should take less than 10 seconds to copy

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.910 
should take less than 10 seconds to copy
and<00:02:24.810> again<00:02:25.740> it's<00:02:26.040> done<00:02:27.200> so<00:02:28.200> to<00:02:28.260> interrupt<00:02:28.710> ice

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
and again it's done so to interrupt ice

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.980
