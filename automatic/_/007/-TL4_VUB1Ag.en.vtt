there<00:02:40.460> as<00:02:40.730> well<00:02:40.940> and<00:02:41.300> I<00:02:41.840> shot<00:02:42.110> off<00:02:42.380> the<00:02:42.650> impulse

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
there as well and I shot off the impulse

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:44.860 
there as well and I shot off the impulse
section<00:02:43.610> there<00:02:43.790> and<00:02:43.910> the<00:02:44.000> deflector<00:02:44.450> dish<00:02:44.480> off

the<00:02:45.020> NX<00:02:45.350> over<00:02:45.590> on<00:02:45.740> again<00:02:46.070> so<00:02:46.580> a<00:02:46.610> nice<00:02:47.330> little

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
the NX over on again so a nice little

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.120 
the NX over on again so a nice little
read<00:02:47.780> under<00:02:48.140> kind<00:02:48.290> of<00:02:48.380> glimpse<00:02:48.680> into<00:02:48.830> the

thinking of it

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.690 
thinking of it
so<00:02:51.230> we<00:02:51.320> have<00:02:51.440> a<00:02:51.470> profile<00:02:52.040> page<00:02:52.280> here<00:02:52.580> which

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
so we have a profile page here which

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.960 
so we have a profile page here which
shows<00:02:52.940> Azure<00:02:53.590> key<00:02:54.590> features<00:02:55.010> of<00:02:55.160> this<00:02:55.310> dish<00:02:55.640> if

and then some interesting facts along

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.390 
and then some interesting facts along
that<00:03:13.010> side<00:03:13.220> of<00:03:13.370> things<00:03:13.550> as<00:03:13.850> well<00:03:14.030> so<00:03:14.990> then<00:03:15.620> as

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
that side of things as well so then as

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.560 
that side of things as well so then as
is<00:03:16.700> the<00:03:16.850> kind<00:03:17.030> of<00:03:17.060> tradition<00:03:17.420> with<00:03:17.540> the

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.570 
is the kind of tradition with the

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:19.330 
is the kind of tradition with the
magazines<00:03:18.020> we<00:03:18.260> go<00:03:18.410> into<00:03:18.740> the<00:03:18.860> area<00:03:19.190> of

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
magazines we go into the area of

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.270 
magazines we go into the area of
designing<00:03:20.030> the<00:03:20.240> NX<00:03:20.630> or<00:03:20.810> one<00:03:21.050> and<00:03:21.320> Shawna's

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
designing the NX or one and Shawna's

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.090 
designing the NX or one and Shawna's
eclipse<00:03:22.580> into<00:03:22.880> the<00:03:23.030> design<00:03:23.390> history<00:03:23.870> and

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:24.100 
eclipse into the design history and

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.830 
eclipse into the design history and
where<00:03:25.100> it<00:03:25.250> went<00:03:25.430> from<00:03:25.550> and<00:03:26.270> where<00:03:26.630> it

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
where it went from and where it

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.680 
where it went from and where it
originally<00:03:27.740> ended<00:03:27.950> up<00:03:28.190> then<00:03:28.400> as<00:03:28.520> well<00:03:28.700> so<00:03:29.360> we

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 
originally ended up then as well so we

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:31.810 
originally ended up then as well so we
can<00:03:29.720> see<00:03:29.840> kind<00:03:30.590> of<00:03:30.710> following<00:03:31.310> the<00:03:31.490> design

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:31.820 
can see kind of following the design

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:34.840 
can see kind of following the design
philosophy<00:03:32.120> of<00:03:32.630> a<00:03:32.720> lot<00:03:32.840> of<00:03:32.990> the<00:03:33.220> ships<00:03:34.220> in<00:03:34.490> Star

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:34.850 
philosophy of a lot of the ships in Star

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:38.650 
philosophy of a lot of the ships in Star

Trek with the secondary hull you see the

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:40.060 
Trek with the secondary hull you see the
original<00:03:38.990> enterprise<00:03:39.110> kind<00:03:39.500> of<00:03:39.590> did<00:03:39.710> kind<00:03:40.010> of

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:40.070 
original enterprise kind of did kind of

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:42.670 
original enterprise kind of did kind of
follow<00:03:40.250> the<00:03:40.400> akira<00:03:40.900> field<00:03:41.900> office<00:03:42.260> which<00:03:42.560> it

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
follow the akira field office which it

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.560 
follow the akira field office which it
does<00:03:42.860> actually<00:03:43.280> touch<00:03:43.460> upon<00:03:43.580> in<00:03:44.000> the<00:03:44.150> magazine

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:44.570 
does actually touch upon in the magazine

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:46.540 
does actually touch upon in the magazine
itself<00:03:44.960> and<00:03:45.260> it's<00:03:45.800> actually<00:03:46.160> it's<00:03:46.280> quite<00:03:46.370> an

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:46.550 
itself and it's actually it's quite an

interesting<00:03:46.610> read<00:03:47.180> and<00:03:47.770> then<00:03:48.770> you<00:03:48.980> have<00:03:49.220> what

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:49.850 
interesting read and then you have what

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:51.580 
interesting read and then you have what
the<00:03:50.000> kind<00:03:50.180> of<00:03:50.240> decks<00:03:50.480> are<00:03:50.720> made<00:03:50.870> up<00:03:51.080> off<00:03:51.290> and

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 
the kind of decks are made up off and

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:53.320 
the kind of decks are made up off and
kind<00:03:51.830> of<00:03:51.860> why<00:03:52.490> they<00:03:52.700> ended<00:03:52.880> up<00:03:53.000> where<00:03:53.180> they

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:53.330 
kind of why they ended up where they

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:55.180 
kind of why they ended up where they
were<00:03:53.390> where<00:03:53.780> they<00:03:54.020> eventually<00:03:54.200> did<00:03:54.740> on<00:03:55.010> the

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:55.190 
were where they eventually did on the

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:57.880 
were where they eventually did on the
actual<00:03:55.520> show<00:03:55.850> itself<00:03:56.390> and<00:03:56.630> some<00:03:57.620> nice

to retrofit their ship and as the series
progressed<00:04:18.650> on<00:04:18.830> and<00:04:18.980> say<00:04:19.070> unfortunately<00:04:19.580> it

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:19.670 
progressed on and say unfortunately it

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:23.620 
progressed on and say unfortunately it
didn't<00:04:20.200> it<00:04:21.200> ended<00:04:22.100> prematurely<00:04:22.280> on<00:04:22.850> TV<00:04:23.330> but<00:04:23.510> we

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 
didn't it ended prematurely on TV but we

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:25.300 
didn't it ended prematurely on TV but we
see<00:04:23.810> the<00:04:23.960> addition<00:04:24.320> after<00:04:24.620> secondary<00:04:25.040> hole

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:25.310 
see the addition after secondary hole

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:29.620 
see the addition after secondary hole
and<00:04:25.660> underneath<00:04:26.660> the<00:04:26.870> original<00:04:27.140> mnx<00:04:28.630> Mardin

and underneath the original mnx Mardin

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:31.030 
and underneath the original mnx Mardin
they're<00:04:29.780> kind<00:04:30.050> of<00:04:30.080> giving<00:04:30.260> us<00:04:30.470> more<00:04:30.710> of<00:04:30.770> a

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:31.040 
they're kind of giving us more of a

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:34.000 
they're kind of giving us more of a
transition<00:04:31.610> field<00:04:31.910> between<00:04:32.350> the<00:04:33.350> annex<00:04:33.620> r1

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.010 
transition field between the annex r1

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:37.690 
transition field between the annex r1
and<00:04:34.370> in<00:04:34.730> CC<00:04:35.270> 1<00:04:35.540> 701<00:04:36.290> and<00:04:36.520> again<00:04:37.520> would<00:04:37.640> have

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:37.700 
and in CC 1 701 and again would have

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:39.610 
and in CC 1 701 and again would have
been<00:04:37.820> interesting<00:04:38.210> to<00:04:38.270> see<00:04:38.330> and<00:04:38.720> hopefully<00:04:39.170> if

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:39.620 
been interesting to see and hopefully if

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.590 
been interesting to see and hopefully if
they<00:04:39.830> ever<00:04:39.920> do<00:04:40.190> get<00:04:40.400> the<00:04:41.090> interest<00:04:41.390> to<00:04:41.510> bring

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:41.600 
they ever do get the interest to bring

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.270 
they ever do get the interest to bring
it<00:04:41.810> back<00:04:41.990> if<00:04:42.200> they<00:04:42.320> do<00:04:42.440> continuous<00:04:42.950> be

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:43.280 
it back if they do continuous be

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.160 
it back if they do continuous be
interesting<00:04:43.670> to<00:04:43.760> see<00:04:43.910> if<00:04:44.060> that<00:04:44.270> is<00:04:44.870> the<00:04:44.990> model

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:45.170 
interesting to see if that is the model

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:48.040 
interesting to see if that is the model
that<00:04:45.350> they<00:04:45.530> do<00:04:45.710> use<00:04:46.220> but<00:04:47.180> again<00:04:47.210> nice<00:04:47.780> little

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.050 
that they do use but again nice little

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:51.250 
that they do use but again nice little
reader<00:04:48.260> for<00:04:48.680> you<00:04:48.800> and<00:04:49.600> then<00:04:50.600> we<00:04:50.780> have<00:04:50.810> our

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:51.260 
reader for you and then we have our

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.250 
reader for you and then we have our
on-screen<00:04:51.770> appearance<00:04:52.280> here<00:04:52.490> and<00:04:52.669> our<00:04:52.820> sleep

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:53.260 
on-screen appearance here and our sleep

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.590 
on-screen appearance here and our sleep
after<00:04:53.740> the<00:04:53.830> next<00:04:54.070> issue<00:04:54.220> so<00:04:55.090> that's<00:04:55.270> pretty

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:55.600 
after the next issue so that's pretty

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.330 
after the next issue so that's pretty
much<00:04:55.690> the<00:04:55.870> magazine<00:04:56.260> again<00:04:56.500> similar<00:04:56.980> formula

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:57.340 
much the magazine again similar formula

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:58.620 
much the magazine again similar formula
to<00:04:57.430> what<00:04:57.520> we're<00:04:57.700> used<00:04:57.730> to<00:04:57.970> so<00:04:58.240> we<00:04:58.360> just<00:04:58.480> put

00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:58.630 
to what we're used to so we just put

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:02.720 
to what we're used to so we just put
that<00:04:58.660> aside<00:04:58.900> now<00:04:59.940> and<00:05:00.940> we<00:05:01.180> look<00:05:01.210> at<00:05:01.600> our<00:05:01.780> model

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:02.730 
that aside now and we look at our model

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:04.950 
that aside now and we look at our model
again<00:05:03.730> this<00:05:03.850> now<00:05:04.060> is<00:05:04.210> a<00:05:04.240> different<00:05:04.540> scale<00:05:04.720> to

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 
again this now is a different scale to

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:06.360 
again this now is a different scale to
the<00:05:05.050> previous<00:05:05.440> ships<00:05:05.650> that<00:05:05.800> we<00:05:05.980> have<00:05:06.250> been

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:06.370 
the previous ships that we have been

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:08.550 
the previous ships that we have been
used<00:05:06.610> to<00:05:06.700> so<00:05:07.300> again<00:05:07.810> I'm<00:05:07.930> interested<00:05:08.380> to<00:05:08.440> see

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:08.560 
used to so again I'm interested to see

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.410 
used to so again I'm interested to see
the<00:05:08.770> level<00:05:09.250> of<00:05:09.430> quality<00:05:09.790> that<00:05:10.030> we<00:05:10.090> have<00:05:10.120> on

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:10.420 
the level of quality that we have on

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:21.560 
the level of quality that we have on
here<00:05:10.570> so<00:05:10.750> let's<00:05:11.350> get<00:05:11.560> at<00:05:11.710> this<00:05:11.740> now<00:05:12.070> and<00:05:12.280> see

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:21.570 

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:43.350 

all<00:05:22.570> of<00:05:22.780> these<00:05:23.580> okay<00:05:24.580> so<00:05:24.730> here<00:05:25.240> we<00:05:25.270> go<00:05:37.020> okay<00:05:42.360> so

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:43.360 
all of these okay so here we go okay so

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:44.760 
all of these okay so here we go okay so
let's<00:05:43.510> just<00:05:43.660> kind<00:05:43.780> of<00:05:43.930> have<00:05:44.350> a<00:05:44.380> look<00:05:44.530> at<00:05:44.650> this

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:44.770 
let's just kind of have a look at this

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:48.060 
let's just kind of have a look at this
here<00:05:44.950> if<00:05:45.040> I<00:05:45.130> get<00:05:45.280> into<00:05:45.520> focus<00:05:46.530> nice<00:05:47.530> level<00:05:47.860> of

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:48.070 
here if I get into focus nice level of

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:49.440 
here if I get into focus nice level of
detail<00:05:48.340> on<00:05:48.430> this<00:05:48.580> to<00:05:48.730> be<00:05:48.820> honest<00:05:49.030> idea<00:05:49.270> and

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:49.450 
detail on this to be honest idea and

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:51.390 
detail on this to be honest idea and
they<00:05:50.140> have<00:05:50.260> touches<00:05:50.560> of<00:05:50.680> a<00:05:50.770> stacking<00:05:51.190> along

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:51.400 
they have touches of a stacking along

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:52.680 
they have touches of a stacking along
the<00:05:51.550> whole<00:05:51.700> areas<00:05:51.970> well<00:05:52.120> if<00:05:52.270> I<00:05:52.330> can<00:05:52.480> kind<00:05:52.570> of

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:52.690 
the whole areas well if I can kind of

the whole areas well if I can kind of
Skechers<00:05:53.140> in<00:05:53.440> the<00:05:53.860> light<00:05:54.040> and<00:05:54.690> the<00:05:55.690> decals<00:05:56.170> on

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:56.410 
Skechers in the light and the decals on

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:59.400 
Skechers in the light and the decals on
it<00:05:56.440> are<00:05:57.120> the<00:05:58.120> best<00:05:58.300> I've<00:05:58.480> seen<00:05:58.720> so<00:05:58.930> far<00:05:59.170> in<00:05:59.380> the

00:05:59.400 --> 00:05:59.410 
it are the best I've seen so far in the

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:01.620 
it are the best I've seen so far in the
series<00:05:59.680> if<00:06:00.160> I<00:06:00.400> can<00:06:00.550> get<00:06:00.670> workers<00:06:01.060> there<00:06:01.270> we<00:06:01.480> go

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:01.630 
series if I can get workers there we go

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:05.100 
series if I can get workers there we go
perfect<00:06:02.730> and<00:06:03.730> we<00:06:04.240> have<00:06:04.390> a<00:06:04.420> little<00:06:04.600> deflector

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:05.110 
perfect and we have a little deflector

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:07.440 
perfect and we have a little deflector
dish<00:06:05.140> they're<00:06:05.650> not<00:06:06.340> as<00:06:06.460> prominent<00:06:06.730> as<00:06:07.150> I

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:07.450 
dish they're not as prominent as I

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:08.760 
dish they're not as prominent as I
thought<00:06:07.600> of<00:06:07.720> it<00:06:07.810> but<00:06:07.900> I<00:06:07.930> did<00:06:08.110> I<00:06:08.200> wasn't<00:06:08.500> I<00:06:08.620> was

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:08.770 
thought of it but I did I wasn't I was

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:09.750 
thought of it but I did I wasn't I was
wondering<00:06:09.010> how<00:06:09.100> they<00:06:09.250> would<00:06:09.370> do<00:06:09.520> it<00:06:09.670> because

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:09.760 
wondering how they would do it because

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:11.280 
wondering how they would do it because
it<00:06:10.090> does<00:06:10.240> come<00:06:10.390> out<00:06:10.480> fish<00:06:10.750> words<00:06:10.990> that<00:06:11.170> have<00:06:11.260> a

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:11.290 
it does come out fish words that have a

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:13.380 
it does come out fish words that have a
kind<00:06:11.470> of<00:06:11.620> flush<00:06:11.830> here<00:06:12.070> to<00:06:12.820> kind<00:06:13.030> of<00:06:13.060> give<00:06:13.240> us<00:06:13.360> a

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:13.390 
kind of flush here to kind of give us a

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:15.570 
kind of flush here to kind of give us a
bit<00:06:13.600> more<00:06:13.630> of<00:06:14.080> a<00:06:14.110> longevity<00:06:15.070> because<00:06:15.550> I

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:15.580 
bit more of a longevity because I

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:19.040 
bit more of a longevity because I
probably<00:06:15.940> would<00:06:16.150> have<00:06:16.300> broke<00:06:16.510> enough<00:06:16.810> and

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:19.050 
probably would have broke enough and

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:21.750 
probably would have broke enough and
probably<00:06:20.050> as<00:06:20.410> time<00:06:20.620> went<00:06:20.800> on<00:06:20.980> we<00:06:21.190> have<00:06:21.640> our

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:21.760 
probably as time went on we have our

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:25.230 
probably as time went on we have our
cargo<00:06:22.030> bay<00:06:22.360> there<00:06:22.690> or<00:06:23.050> whole<00:06:23.710> bridge<00:06:24.670> section
