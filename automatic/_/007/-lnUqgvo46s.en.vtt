00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 then people will see how easy it is to 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.980
 from that program that we did 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.090
 to connect the oled flash via 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.330
 bluetooth 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.130
 We're going to turn this lamp on here, right? 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.970
 it's here 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.830
 through a relay module okay 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:23.670
 that we have a head module one channel 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:29.460
 where we connect the lamp and the source 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:33.630
 voltage of the lamp would be 220 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.800
 off the power socket so it was only the 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.739
 that we did 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.469
 we have the two supply wires of the 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.790
 negative relay we connected 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:46.160
 here the plate 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:50.100
 these two buses here more and less 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:52.110
 and the command for triggering the relay coil 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.789
 is that we call does not realize that it is the 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.600
 same pilot that is on 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.789
 board 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.440
 then our bluetooth module is already 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.859
 paired with tablet 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:07.909
 sure the coming of the command so I go 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:07.909
 connect the 220 lamp here 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:15.430
 ok the moment i type here a l 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:19.000
 capital 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:20.920
 she's going to call look 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.740
 both will turn on the led of the board as it goes 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:28.540
 call there, see you 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:30.510
 certain is that by the time I type b 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:35.229
 capital 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:36.700
 the lamp will turn off all right 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:39.220
 wireless ne 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.170
 already connected there is nothing connecting 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.210
 that we have here are feeding 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.440
 board that is coming from the computer but 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:48.490
 I can very well connected to a 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:50.970
 charger right that has usb input 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:56.320
 and the lamp source that 's coming here 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:59.350
 220 right again 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:04.690
 if I type capital l will happen 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:08.920
 What are you going to call right there and I come with 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:14.500
 fashion here is on 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:15.940
 if I type in capital letter if I 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:21.970
 type p 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:25.510
 There you go fishing in series. 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:29.200
 the programming is the same all right 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:31.480
 the programming is the same for led 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.549
 so I hope you have enjoyed it and in 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:37.320
 The time that has left you has 

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:37.320
 youtube to us, it's a hug
