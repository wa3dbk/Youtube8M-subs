sets<00:02:05.159> coming<00:02:05.430> out

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.350 

and<00:02:10.920> then<00:02:11.989> this<00:02:12.989> one<00:02:13.050> I<00:02:13.410> think<00:02:13.440> we<00:02:13.800> get<00:02:13.920> to<00:02:14.099> see

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
and then this one I think we get to see

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.500 
and then this one I think we get to see
from<00:02:15.360> the<00:02:15.450> bag<00:02:16.670> there<00:02:17.670> you<00:02:17.760> have<00:02:17.880> it<00:02:17.910> backwards

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
from the bag there you have it backwards

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:25.910 
from the bag there you have it backwards
so<00:02:19.440> yeah<00:02:23.300> so<00:02:24.300> this<00:02:24.599> is<00:02:24.630> the<00:02:24.870> first<00:02:25.349> form<00:02:25.650> of<00:02:25.800> the

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
so yeah so this is the first form of the

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.100 
so yeah so this is the first form of the
set<00:02:26.099> that<00:02:26.130> we<00:02:26.370> get<00:02:26.550> as<00:02:26.760> you<00:02:27.390> can<00:02:27.510> see<00:02:27.690> it's<00:02:27.900> like

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
set that we get as you can see it's like

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.130 
set that we get as you can see it's like
a<00:02:28.170> regular<00:02:28.470> trash<00:02:29.010> truck<00:02:29.430> and<00:02:30.390> he<00:02:30.660> has<00:02:30.870> it's

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:43.049 
can take this off and put like a mini

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:46.250 
can take this off and put like a mini
figure<00:02:43.410> inside<00:02:43.769> you<00:02:44.580> driving<00:02:45.060> him<00:02:45.930> in<00:02:46.080> there

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
figure inside you driving him in there

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.130 
figure inside you driving him in there
and<00:02:46.440> you'll<00:02:46.620> be<00:02:46.739> driving<00:02:47.040> it<00:02:47.750> put<00:02:48.750> this<00:02:48.900> back

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
symbol on the top and then we'll do a

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.430 
symbol on the top and then we'll do a
360<00:02:58.319> spin<00:02:58.850> we<00:02:59.850> got<00:03:00.030> a<00:03:00.060> broom<00:03:00.360> on<00:03:00.540> this<00:03:00.750> side<00:03:01.019> and

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
going to move on to the transformation

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.840 
going to move on to the transformation
