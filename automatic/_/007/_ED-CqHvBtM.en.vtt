00:00:10.439 --> 00:00:14.229
 The painter and sculptor Georg Baselitz is one of the most important German 

00:00:14.229 --> 00:00:18.039
 Contemporary artists his works are in the most important museums in the world 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:21.039
 to see 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.230
 What are your typical character traits? 

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:29.539
 this should always be reversed 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:31.679
 if I do something bad 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.430
 or if enough bad impression make the victim a mine 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.080
 character 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.450
 also affects other ways to make a bad impression and that 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:44.700
 Character character is always something to shape for me and most she says 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.070
 who is not her personal hero 

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:55.980
 that is really difficult was there is very family role model 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.380
 there was even my father's old brother my dad is coming that he does not 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:01.690
 say but we are not completely wrong 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:04.690
 Manduka four drivers my dad's brother 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:10.070
 and percent in my May development time after Popals will be time 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.040
 until graduation 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.190
 and after that I've always tried with big marathons 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:17.640
 To connect 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.440
 the Milestone Forums or Kate Moss experienced 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.940
 And certainly makes a very big impression on me or were already 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:25.560
 been prepared 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.000
 and, strangely enough, that has lasted until today 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.360
 this exemplary 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.420
 What is an irresistible try for them 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.520
 to occupy all images of other people 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.620
 send us a life wisdom 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.259
 for me 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.640
 was necessary 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.770
 which formation 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.670
 until the biology is honored and functioning soft-ring with it 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.470
 currently winner type 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.310
 and who knows what that would be to suppress or not at all 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:04.520
 feel 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.650
 is the state now 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:10.119
 the biological rest is perhaps given 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.119
 how do you have an unfulfilled dream? 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:19.969
 I collect 

00:02:19.969 --> 00:02:21.120
 and 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.719
 if I still embrace him with his vehicle 

00:02:23.719 --> 00:02:27.419
 For example, look at cow's milk, what do you want to do with it? 

00:02:27.419 --> 00:02:29.519
 Pat average of clutter heads 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:32.519
 It may seem ridiculous on the part of me of great importance 

00:02:33.399 --> 00:02:36.399
 what is she upset? 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:42.219
 what does a perfect day look like? 

00:02:42.219 --> 00:02:47.169
 yes that worked or 2 three hours really focused 

00:02:47.169 --> 00:02:48.369
 not to get sick
