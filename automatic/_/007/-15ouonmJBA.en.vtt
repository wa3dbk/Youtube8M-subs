the first ever rog series monitor yeah
so<00:00:29.400> right<00:00:29.640> behind<00:00:29.789> us<00:00:30.029> right<00:00:30.119> here<00:00:30.269> is<00:00:30.599> the<00:00:30.630> PG

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
so right behind us right here is the PG

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.160 
so right behind us right here is the PG
278<00:00:32.130> q<00:00:32.460> so<00:00:33.120> like<00:00:33.270> you<00:00:33.390> said<00:00:33.420> this<00:00:33.690> is<00:00:33.750> the<00:00:33.899> first

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
278 q so like you said this is the first

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.950 
278 q so like you said this is the first
rog<00:00:34.559> monitor<00:00:34.890> this<00:00:35.040> is<00:00:35.190> wqhd<00:00:36.120> base<00:00:36.540> this<00:00:36.809> is

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
rog monitor this is wqhd base this is

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.030 
rog monitor this is wqhd base this is
2560<00:00:37.559> x<00:00:37.890> 1440<00:00:38.309> it's<00:00:39.210> 27<00:00:39.840> inch<00:00:40.020> it's<00:00:40.559> a<00:00:40.710> TN<00:00:41.010> panel

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
2560 x 1440 it's 27 inch it's a TN panel

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.619 
2560 x 1440 it's 27 inch it's a TN panel
so<00:00:41.460> it's<00:00:41.579> got<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:41.850> one<00:00:41.969> millisecond<00:00:42.239> response

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
so it's got the one millisecond response

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.229 
so it's got the one millisecond response
time<00:00:43.140> it's<00:00:43.379> got<00:00:43.530> up<00:00:43.680> to<00:00:43.800> 144<00:00:44.579> hurts<00:00:44.789> refresh

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
time it's got up to 144 hurts refresh

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.760 
time it's got up to 144 hurts refresh
rate<00:00:45.450> and<00:00:45.690> it's<00:00:46.170> going<00:00:46.289> to<00:00:46.379> be<00:00:46.440> coming<00:00:46.559> out<00:00:46.739> in

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
rate and it's going to be coming out in

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.200 
rate and it's going to be coming out in
March<00:00:47.160> for<00:00:47.520> about<00:00:47.670> seven<00:00:47.969> ninety-nine

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
March for about seven ninety-nine

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.139 
March for about seven ninety-nine
alright<00:00:48.840> and<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.950> demo<00:00:50.640> that's<00:00:50.850> going<00:00:51.059> on

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
alright and the demo that's going on

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.450 
alright and the demo that's going on
right<00:00:51.210> now<00:00:51.360> is<00:00:51.780> a<00:00:51.809> g-sync<00:00:52.710> demo<00:00:53.129> and<00:00:53.340> if<00:00:53.399> you

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
right now is a g-sync demo and if you

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:54.590 
right now is a g-sync demo and if you
guys<00:00:53.550> aren't<00:00:53.730> familiar<00:00:53.879> what<00:00:54.120> you<00:00:54.210> think<00:00:54.449> it's

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
guys aren't familiar what you think it's

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.810 
guys aren't familiar what you think it's
basically<00:00:54.960> fixing<00:00:55.920> all<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.070> problems<00:00:56.640> it

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
basically fixing all the problems it

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.250 
basically fixing all the problems it
helps<00:00:57.059> your<00:00:57.180> graphics<00:00:57.660> card<00:00:57.750> communicate

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
helps your graphics card communicate

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.020 
helps your graphics card communicate
with<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.469> monitor<00:00:58.649> so<00:00:59.280> they<00:00:59.399> can<00:00:59.550> synchronize

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
with the monitor so they can synchronize

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.330 
with the monitor so they can synchronize
the<00:01:00.210> refresh<00:01:00.539> rate<00:01:00.660> and<00:01:00.960> I<00:01:01.590> don't<00:01:02.070> know<00:01:02.160> how

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
the refresh rate and I don't know how

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.439 
the refresh rate and I don't know how
much<00:01:02.550> this<00:01:02.699> is<00:01:02.760> going<00:01:02.940> to<00:01:03.030> pick<00:01:03.180> up<00:01:03.300> for<00:01:03.420> you

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
much this is going to pick up for you

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.200 
much this is going to pick up for you
guys<00:01:03.510> at<00:01:03.750> home<00:01:03.870> but<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.760> smoothness<00:01:05.760> of<00:01:05.970> the

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
guys at home but the smoothness of the

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.700 
guys at home but the smoothness of the
display<00:01:06.600> here<00:01:06.840> from<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.170> right<00:01:07.350> one<00:01:07.530> which<00:01:07.680> is

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
display here from the right one which is

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.010 
display here from the right one which is
g-sync<00:01:08.189> and<00:01:08.640> left<00:01:08.850> one<00:01:09.000> which<00:01:09.119> is<00:01:09.150> not<00:01:09.420> is

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
g-sync and left one which is not is

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.320 
g-sync and left one which is not is
quite<00:01:10.290> striking<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:11.010> demo<00:01:11.369> is<00:01:11.400> not<00:01:11.970> working

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
quite striking the demo is not working

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.690 
quite striking the demo is not working
optimally<00:01:12.479> right<00:01:12.930> now<00:01:13.049> but<00:01:13.500> yes<00:01:14.189> do<00:01:14.400> you<00:01:14.490> think

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
optimally right now but yes do you think

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.190 
optimally right now but yes do you think
will<00:01:14.820> make<00:01:14.970> everything<00:01:15.270> super<00:01:15.600> smooth<00:01:15.960> the

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
will make everything super smooth the

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.660 
will make everything super smooth the
frame<00:01:16.409> rate<00:01:16.590> will<00:01:16.710> always<00:01:16.979> equal<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.340> refresh

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
frame rate will always equal the refresh

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.010 
frame rate will always equal the refresh
rate<00:01:17.759> of<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.000> monitor<00:01:18.299> so<00:01:18.540> you'll<00:01:18.780> eliminate

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
rate of the monitor so you'll eliminate

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.109 
rate of the monitor so you'll eliminate
all<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.350> blurring<00:01:19.650> in<00:01:19.920> turn<00:01:20.100> beautiful<00:01:20.880> so<00:01:21.090> I

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
all the blurring in turn beautiful so I

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.999 
all the blurring in turn beautiful so I
keep<00:01:21.900> a<00:01:21.960> guy<00:01:22.080> keep<00:01:22.470> your<00:01:22.590> eyes<00:01:22.650> out<00:01:22.770> for<00:01:22.830> that

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
keep a guy keep your eyes out for that

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.550 
keep a guy keep your eyes out for that
monitor<00:01:23.369> and<00:01:23.549> release<00:01:24.119> date<00:01:24.390> again<00:01:24.869> March

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
of this month in January and this is

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.899 
of this month in January and this is
like<00:02:52.500> you<00:02:52.620> said<00:02:52.829> you<00:02:52.949> see<00:02:53.099> the<00:02:53.219> do<00:02:53.400> and<00:02:53.669> let's

00:02:53.899 --> 00:02:53.909 
like you said you see the do and let's

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:55.879 
like you said you see the do and let's
outlets<00:02:54.269> there<00:02:54.540> as<00:02:55.169> well<00:02:55.379> they<00:02:55.530> are<00:02:55.590> cooler

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:55.889 
outlets there as well they are cooler

00:02:55.889 --> 00:02:57.649 
outlets there as well they are cooler
and<00:02:56.219> it's<00:02:56.340> a<00:02:56.400> dual<00:02:56.579> fan<00:02:56.819> setup<00:02:57.209> so<00:02:57.419> it's<00:02:57.540> very

00:02:57.649 --> 00:02:57.659 
and it's a dual fan setup so it's very

00:02:57.659 --> 00:02:59.869 
and it's a dual fan setup so it's very
similar<00:02:57.959> to<00:02:58.109> kind<00:02:58.500> of<00:02:58.530> the<00:02:58.650> DC<00:02:58.949> to<00:02:59.099> design<00:02:59.400> I'm

00:02:59.869 --> 00:02:59.879 
similar to kind of the DC to design I'm

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:01.729 
similar to kind of the DC to design I'm
except<00:03:00.209> for<00:03:00.389> it<00:03:00.449> does<00:03:00.900> have<00:03:01.109> that<00:03:01.260> water<00:03:01.500> block

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
except for it does have that water block

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:03.409 
except for it does have that water block
plate<00:03:02.010> on<00:03:02.159> there<00:03:02.310> beautiful<00:03:02.790> so<00:03:02.909> an<00:03:03.000> excellent

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:03.419 
plate on there beautiful so an excellent

00:03:03.419 --> 00:03:05.330 
plate on there beautiful so an excellent
option<00:03:03.569> I<00:03:03.930> would<00:03:03.989> guess<00:03:04.290> particularly<00:03:04.949> if<00:03:05.189> you

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
option I would guess particularly if you

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.159 
option I would guess particularly if you
maybe<00:03:05.519> have<00:03:05.790> an<00:03:05.879> air-cooled<00:03:06.599> system<00:03:07.019> right

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:07.169 
maybe have an air-cooled system right

00:03:07.169 --> 00:03:09.589 
maybe have an air-cooled system right
now<00:03:07.319> and<00:03:07.560> are<00:03:07.949> thinking<00:03:08.370> to<00:03:08.609> possibly<00:03:09.299> invest

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:09.599 
now and are thinking to possibly invest

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:11.030 
now and are thinking to possibly invest
in<00:03:09.750> a<00:03:09.810> water<00:03:09.930> cooling<00:03:10.290> system<00:03:10.590> in<00:03:10.680> the<00:03:10.769> future

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
in a water cooling system in the future

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.530 
in a water cooling system in the future
you<00:03:11.129> got<00:03:11.280> both<00:03:11.430> of<00:03:11.459> those<00:03:11.669> work<00:03:12.209> well<00:03:12.389> together

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
you got both of those work well together

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:13.729 
you got both of those work well together
of<00:03:12.810> course<00:03:12.959> you're<00:03:13.139> going<00:03:13.230> to<00:03:13.319> get<00:03:13.409> excellent

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
of course you're going to get excellent

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:15.530 
of course you're going to get excellent
cooling<00:03:14.099> either<00:03:14.310> way<00:03:14.489> but<00:03:14.879> I<00:03:14.939> guess<00:03:15.180> probably

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
cooling either way but I guess probably

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.179 
cooling either way but I guess probably
better<00:03:16.019> cooling<00:03:16.349> if<00:03:16.560> you<00:03:16.680> go<00:03:16.799> with<00:03:16.919> the<00:03:17.009> water

00:03:17.179 --> 00:03:17.189 
better cooling if you go with the water

00:03:17.189 --> 00:03:19.129 
better cooling if you go with the water
cooled<00:03:17.459> solution<00:03:17.879> yeah<00:03:18.090> this<00:03:18.329> is<00:03:18.479> much<00:03:19.109> more

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:19.139 
cooled solution yeah this is much more

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:21.379 
cooled solution yeah this is much more
about<00:03:19.470> the<00:03:19.620> flexibility<00:03:20.250> and<00:03:20.400> it<00:03:21.000> does<00:03:21.180> come

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:21.389 
about the flexibility and it does come

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:23.390 
about the flexibility and it does come
very<00:03:21.870> close<00:03:22.109> in<00:03:22.349> performance<00:03:22.769> excellent<00:03:23.310> all

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
very close in performance excellent all

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.369 
very close in performance excellent all

here<00:06:10.790> so<00:06:11.000> k<00:06:11.180> it's<00:06:11.600> pretty<00:06:11.900> complicated<00:06:12.260> but

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:12.860 
here so k it's pretty complicated but

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:15.100 
here so k it's pretty complicated but
essentially<00:06:13.400> what<00:06:13.520> simulating<00:06:14.150> is<00:06:14.300> hey<00:06:14.570> we

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:15.110 
essentially what simulating is hey we

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:16.570 
essentially what simulating is hey we
could<00:06:15.320> someone<00:06:15.650> could<00:06:15.800> come<00:06:15.980> up<00:06:16.100> with<00:06:16.370> an

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:16.580 
could someone could come up with an

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:18.390 
could someone could come up with an
external<00:06:16.820> hard<00:06:17.000> drive<00:06:17.480> solution<00:06:17.930> like<00:06:18.200> this

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:18.400 
external hard drive solution like this

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:20.590 
external hard drive solution like this
where<00:06:19.400> all<00:06:19.610> this<00:06:19.790> would<00:06:19.940> be<00:06:20.030> on<00:06:20.150> the<00:06:20.270> internal

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:20.600 
where all this would be on the internal

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:22.630 
where all this would be on the internal
and<00:06:20.900> you'd<00:06:21.260> thunderbolt<00:06:21.740> it<00:06:21.860> back<00:06:22.070> to<00:06:22.310> your

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:22.640 
and you'd thunderbolt it back to your

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:23.890 
and you'd thunderbolt it back to your
Thunderbolt<00:06:23.090> 2<00:06:23.150> compatible<00:06:23.780> motherboard

we've gone with a motherboard like the

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:29.210 
we've gone with a motherboard like the
z87<00:06:27.750> deluxe<00:06:28.320> quad<00:06:28.590> which<00:06:28.860> has<00:06:29.010> two

you having extremely fast external
massive<00:06:38.760> storage<00:06:39.030> is<00:06:39.360> going<00:06:40.020> to<00:06:40.080> be<00:06:40.200> very<00:06:40.470> very

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:40.800 
massive storage is going to be very very

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.770 
massive storage is going to be very very
nice<00:06:41.070> particularly<00:06:41.670> if<00:06:41.820> you<00:06:41.970> like<00:06:42.480> to<00:06:42.660> go

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:42.780 
nice particularly if you like to go

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:44.540 
nice particularly if you like to go
places<00:06:42.810> and<00:06:43.290> make<00:06:43.500> videos<00:06:43.890> and<00:06:44.160> you<00:06:44.220> need<00:06:44.370> lots

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:44.550 
places and make videos and you need lots

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:46.640 
places and make videos and you need lots
of<00:06:44.670> storage<00:06:44.910> so<00:06:45.210> a<00:06:45.390> great<00:06:45.960> option<00:06:46.170> there<00:06:46.500> and

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:46.650 
of storage so a great option there and

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:47.690 
of storage so a great option there and
then<00:06:46.770> something<00:06:47.190> that<00:06:47.310> we<00:06:47.430> could<00:06:47.580> potentially

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:47.700 
then something that we could potentially

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:50.570 
then something that we could potentially
see<00:06:48.150> integrated<00:06:48.600> by<00:06:49.250> possibly<00:06:50.250> some<00:06:50.370> storage

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:50.580 
see integrated by possibly some storage

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:52.400
