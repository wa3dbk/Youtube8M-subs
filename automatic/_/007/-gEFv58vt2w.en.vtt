00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.000
 Ah, he is here! 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.000
 Let me take this. 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.000
 Do you want tea? 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
 Tea is so good, the owner 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.000
 the host. 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
 You are such a little barbarian. 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
 But you are not a good rush. 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
 A farmer’s hand is plowed, not a gun. 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 Ah, how can you look at it? 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
 Seeing that the rebellion for my service will pay more than the emperor. 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:12.500
 Dylan? 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:13.500
 the host? 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.500
 Then my duel pistol. 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 Do you like a gun? 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
 Master Chalmers, are you ready to take the bullets of this young man? 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000
 Young people, are you ready to take the bullets of the owner Chalmers? 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
 Ready to grab. 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
 Hello, thank you for watching. 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.500
 If you want to see what is difficult to bring to the world of a game, take a look at our "Behind the Scenes" video. 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.000
 There are a lot of good looks inside. 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000
 Yes, and you want to see where we came from and think about doing this, take a look at Assasins Creed 3 Trailer 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.000
 It looks good. 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.000
 I can not wait 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000
 You should follow us on Twitter and Facebook. 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000
 Because it is a good way for us to contact you. 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
 Ok, everyone, it’s fun.
