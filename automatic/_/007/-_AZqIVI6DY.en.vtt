00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:15.570
 hello to you all last year 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.939
 marked a whole new cycle 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.310
 a bunch of bearded sysadmin activity 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:22.200
 for the winter in a bevy and with serious 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.329
 kind and no less seriously outstretched 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.130
 hand crowded on the threshold of kickstarter 

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:28.529
 online store shelves literally 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.270
 Andy freshly filled and titles 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.430
 of different shapes and sizes about those to whom 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:34.700
 I was lucky a little less recently 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.500
 Born in the bowels of Velva greenlight and 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.719
 hiding with even greater force flow 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.210
 indie games made it harder to catch 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.399
 those same homemade cakes chuckling because 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.440
 which in general is not ashamed to pay 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.359
 your hard earned me and here's how 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.190
 just one of these cakes in the past 

00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:52.289
 the year for me was mysterious 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.589
 bottomless just sci-fi 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:57.719
 faster than light in general plots of bodies 

00:00:55.589 --> 00:00:59.820
 quite conditional thing may well 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.980
 fit in a couple of sentences are you captain 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.019
 one of the confederation ships and such 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.270
 the default fraction 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.640
 which leads a completely unequal war with 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.490
 constantly growing and the forces of the rebels 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.960
 and generally are on the verge of destruction 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.210
 specifically your task in this whole war 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.100
 quite easy to deliver from one end 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.140
 galaxies to other valuable information 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.210
 able to change the course of the war in favor 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.580
 confederation and once and for all do away 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.620
 with mutiny at the same time of course no one 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.150
 forbids you while traveling from 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:29.160
 sector to sector explore 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.140
 uncharted planets get involved in 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.150
 space adventure recruit yourself 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.160
 new types from different races 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.900
 and and generally lead full intrigue and 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:40.170
 romance life of the present 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.880
 space cowboy and really here 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.070
 this freedom to choose your way in 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.810
 galaxy and there is the essence of the game gameplay but 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.570
 if at all you can apply it 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.430
 the word f tel is more likely not a sort of game 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.470
 a collection of your own space 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.270
 bike you can avidly share with 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.400
 friends somewhere over a cup of coffee 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.470
 The main feature of fast times is nlite 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.630
 this very feeling is unknown sti 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.490
 cosmos that are in the best traditions 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.740
 bagel generated randomly 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.170
 every time you start a new game 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.179
 and you have to do it oh how often and 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.519
 not even so much because of the bonus in the form 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.010
 let's say a new class of ship crew 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:14.930
 which you get for 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.610
 less successful attempts to perform 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.220
 assigned task how many because 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.590
 that you just overestimated your coolness and 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.269
 in vain got involved in another mess as 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.430
 should not obey the next 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:27.439
 shipyards at the same time has become a trend for 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.390
 india 8-bit graphics is not at all 

00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:31.370
 prevents full immersion in constantly 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.650
 changing the world in the body is all the same 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.959

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:42.349
 periodically pop up windows you 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.450
 watch the fuss of the little 8-bit 

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:46.370
 the little dummies playing that troll of yours 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.200
 commands to the word arbitrary 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.150
 generated side quests here 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.889
 quite a lot here and you shaking 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.629
 merchants who of course need 

00:02:51.889 --> 00:02:54.590
 accompany the handle to the next 

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:56.720
 star systems 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.549
 Igor pirates which asks to teach 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.920
 power one of the provincial planets and 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:03.019
 almost endless star battle with 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.639
 pirated and not very ships from 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:06.609
 which is possible at almost any moment 

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:08.329
 before starting the engine 

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:10.129
 heroically escape 

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:11.569
 if you suddenly smell fried way 

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:13.459
 ship management and crews 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:15.709

 Oxygenated and easier need by 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:22.519
 scrap metal 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:24.260
 such a local currency that you 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:26.510
 get for destroying the enemy 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.549
 ships and quests for him 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:30.799
 you can hire a team in rare ports and 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:32.870
 buy various gadgets for the ship 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:34.940
 at the same time in the battles even the most competent 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:36.049
 hung with a star destroyer may not 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.609
 weak and row 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:39.500
 if the team is ok 

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:41.750
 sit in the cabins of every squadra 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.579
 it can and should be sent on time 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.739
 need a compartment of the ship to noticeably 

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:47.329
 strengthen let's say the power of accounts quickly 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:49.730
 put out the fire and repair 

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:51.590
 damaged compartments and if for buy 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:53.660
 currently teleport to the ship send your 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:55.730
 fighters aboard the enemy ship 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:57.470
 by pumping them a little plus in 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:59.449
 depending on race team members 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:01.459
 initially receive small bonuses 

00:03:59.449 --> 00:04:03.650
 let's say semi robots are twice as fast 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:06.139
 intelligent bugs repair damage 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:07.940
 the indispensable bard of life unbroken 

00:04:06.139 --> 00:04:10.370
 some huge guests from the ship 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:12.560
 stone people hardly suffer from 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:14.810
 fire well, just an illusion 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:17.389
 but they are boring and uninteresting and they 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:19.820
 there are no bonuses at all 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:21.919
 Retell absolutely all the details ftl 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:23.960
 which she so mentioned criminally many 

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:25.700
 I don't want at all if for you at least 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.740
 Something Warm Lamp Series 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:29.510

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:31.460
 send your own flight 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:33.169
 star cruiser galaxy then just 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:35.180
 take a dip in this adventure 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:37.070
 themselves good with proper skill and 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:40.070
 great luck way to the final boss 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:41.750
 may take on an hour well and then 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:43.639

 conquer my serenity galaxy and so 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:02.080
 stagnated in dock for too long
