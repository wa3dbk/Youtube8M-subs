stick like fish treats up their sleeves
and<00:02:51.160> wardrobe<00:02:52.090> weren't<00:02:52.360> happy<00:02:52.630> about<00:02:52.660> that

and wardrobe weren't happy about that

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.620 
and wardrobe weren't happy about that
but<00:02:54.340> we<00:02:54.430> just<00:02:54.460> had<00:02:54.760> such<00:02:55.000> a<00:02:55.030> great<00:02:55.270> time

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
but we just had such a great time

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:58.590 
but we just had such a great time
another<00:02:56.350> one<00:02:56.590> would<00:02:56.800> be<00:02:57.180> when<00:02:58.180> he<00:02:58.210> was<00:02:58.390> doing

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
another one would be when he was doing

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.390 
another one would be when he was doing
his<00:02:58.720> stunt<00:02:59.020> work<00:02:59.200> so<00:02:59.440> bounding<00:02:59.920> off<00:03:00.010> the<00:03:00.190> kids

his stunt work so bounding off the kids

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.550 
his stunt work so bounding off the kids
he<00:03:00.850> used<00:03:00.880> to<00:03:01.090> knock<00:03:01.300> them<00:03:01.510> over<00:03:01.630> because<00:03:02.440> he'd

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
he used to knock them over because he'd

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.650 
he used to knock them over because he'd
do<00:03:02.680> it<00:03:02.800> too<00:03:02.980> hard<00:03:03.190> and<00:03:03.460> be<00:03:03.610> too<00:03:03.760> enthusiastic

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
do it too hard and be too enthusiastic

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.330 
do it too hard and be too enthusiastic
and<00:03:04.780> I<00:03:04.870> said<00:03:04.990> you<00:03:05.260> can't<00:03:05.500> do<00:03:05.680> that<00:03:05.710> they're

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:09.070 
so he had to tone it down a little bit

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:11.730 
so he had to tone it down a little bit
but<00:03:09.580> it<00:03:10.300> was<00:03:10.330> good<00:03:10.630> fun<00:03:10.810> and<00:03:11.050> everyone<00:03:11.470> worked

but it was good fun and everyone worked

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:13.200 
but it was good fun and everyone worked
really<00:03:12.010> well<00:03:12.100> together<00:03:12.370> because<00:03:13.030> I<00:03:13.060> mean

kind of got it out their systems in the

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:28.979 
kind of got it out their systems in the
first<00:03:26.440> couple<00:03:26.650> of<00:03:26.800> days<00:03:26.860> and<00:03:27.430> then<00:03:27.870> after<00:03:28.870> that

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:28.989 
first couple of days and then after that

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:30.690 
first couple of days and then after that
they'd<00:03:29.290> rolled<00:03:29.530> off<00:03:29.680> and<00:03:29.800> be<00:03:29.860> like

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
they'd rolled off and be like

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.650 
they'd rolled off and be like
and<00:03:31.120> that<00:03:31.300> was<00:03:31.420> it<00:03:31.920> but<00:03:32.940> yeah<00:03:33.940> I<00:03:33.970> mean<00:03:34.330> they<00:03:34.510> had

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
and that was it but yeah I mean they had

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.720 
and that was it but yeah I mean they had
enough<00:03:34.930> to<00:03:35.080> harm<00:03:35.200> cuddling<00:03:35.620> up<00:03:35.830> to<00:03:36.040> him<00:03:36.190> when

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
enough to harm cuddling up to him when

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:38.010 
enough to harm cuddling up to him when
they<00:03:36.850> were<00:03:36.910> during<00:03:37.450> a<00:03:37.600> scene<00:03:37.810> or<00:03:37.989> something

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:38.020 
they were during a scene or something

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:40.229 
they were during a scene or something
like<00:03:38.350> that<00:03:38.410> so<00:03:39.040> I<00:03:39.070> think<00:03:39.400> they<00:03:39.670> all<00:03:39.820> got<00:03:40.060> it<00:03:40.150> out

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:40.239 
like that so I think they all got it out

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:42.210 
like that so I think they all got it out
of<00:03:40.270> their<00:03:40.540> systems<00:03:40.930> quickly<00:03:41.170> of<00:03:41.800> course<00:03:42.070> David

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
of their systems quickly of course David

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:43.890 
of their systems quickly of course David
Walliams<00:03:42.459> is<00:03:42.730> providing<00:03:43.180> the<00:03:43.330> voice<00:03:43.480> how<00:03:43.690> old

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
Walliams is providing the voice how old

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.680 
Walliams is providing the voice how old
you<00:03:44.019> think<00:03:44.170> he<00:03:44.410> he<00:03:44.620> captures<00:03:45.130> Ponzi<00:03:45.850> I<00:03:46.030> think

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
you think he he captures Ponzi I think

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:50.420 
you think he he captures Ponzi I think
he's<00:03:46.780> brilliant<00:03:47.489> he<00:03:48.489> he<00:03:48.850> does<00:03:49.060> a<00:03:49.300> amazing<00:03:50.140> job

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
he's brilliant he he does a amazing job

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.430 
he's brilliant he he does a amazing job
basically<00:03:51.430> I<00:03:52.000> think<00:03:52.600> it<00:03:52.930> sounds<00:03:53.140> a<00:03:53.290> bit<00:03:53.380> like

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.440 
basically I think it sounds a bit like

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.180 
basically I think it sounds a bit like
Pudsey<00:03:53.830> meets<00:03:54.220> David<00:03:54.519> kind<00:03:55.060> of<00:03:55.209> thing<00:03:55.450> so

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
Pudsey meets David kind of thing so

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.920 
Pudsey meets David kind of thing so
obviously<00:03:57.190> you've<00:03:57.310> got<00:03:57.340> David's<00:03:57.910> voice<00:03:58.450> and

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
obviously you've got David's voice and

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:00.600 
obviously you've got David's voice and
he<00:03:59.050> still<00:03:59.320> sounds<00:03:59.709> slightly<00:03:59.860> David<00:04:00.430> so<00:04:00.519> you

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:00.610 
he still sounds slightly David so you

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:02.070 
he still sounds slightly David so you
can<00:04:00.760> tell<00:04:00.910> it's<00:04:01.060> him<00:04:01.120> but<00:04:01.450> then<00:04:01.870> you've<00:04:02.019> got

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:02.080 
can tell it's him but then you've got

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.350 
can tell it's him but then you've got
that<00:04:02.590> kind<00:04:02.950> of<00:04:03.010> like<00:04:03.190> cheeky<00:04:03.640> dog<00:04:03.910> voice<00:04:04.120> from

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:04.360 
that kind of like cheeky dog voice from

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:07.500 
that kind of like cheeky dog voice from
Pudsey<00:04:05.280> but<00:04:06.280> it<00:04:06.459> is<00:04:06.610> weird<00:04:06.880> every<00:04:07.180> time<00:04:07.330> I<00:04:07.360> look

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
Pudsey but it is weird every time I look

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.509 
Pudsey but it is weird every time I look
at<00:04:07.570> palsy<00:04:07.870> now<00:04:07.989> I<00:04:08.019> think<00:04:08.140> of<00:04:08.380> David's<00:04:08.739> voice<00:04:08.890> so

00:04:09.509 --> 00:04:09.519 
at palsy now I think of David's voice so

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:11.790 
at palsy now I think of David's voice so
it's<00:04:09.640> quite<00:04:09.850> odd<00:04:10.000> but<00:04:10.360> yeah<00:04:11.170> quite<00:04:11.500> surreal

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:11.800 
it's quite odd but yeah quite surreal

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.530 
it's quite odd but yeah quite surreal
this<00:04:12.190> is<00:04:12.370> a<00:04:12.430> question<00:04:12.700> of<00:04:12.910> watching<00:04:13.239> the<00:04:13.330> film

this is a question of watching the film

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.030 
this is a question of watching the film
back<00:04:13.660> and<00:04:13.870> saying<00:04:14.110> it's<00:04:14.410> you<00:04:14.530> know<00:04:14.680> Pudsey

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
have a kind of human voice and kind of

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:18.840 
have a kind of human voice and kind of
interact<00:04:17.169> with<00:04:17.380> people<00:04:17.530> yeah<00:04:17.950> the<00:04:18.400> strangest

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:18.850 
interact with people yeah the strangest

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:20.490 
interact with people yeah the strangest
thing<00:04:18.970> for<00:04:19.299> me<00:04:19.450> actually<00:04:19.750> wasn't<00:04:20.169> the<00:04:20.350> voice

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500 
thing for me actually wasn't the voice

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.500 
thing for me actually wasn't the voice
itself<00:04:20.950> it<00:04:21.310> was<00:04:21.370> when<00:04:21.580> Patsy's<00:04:21.970> mouth<00:04:22.210> was

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:22.510 
itself it was when Patsy's mouth was

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:24.420 
itself it was when Patsy's mouth was
moving<00:04:22.690> when<00:04:23.169> he<00:04:23.260> was<00:04:23.380> talking<00:04:23.560> I<00:04:23.979> thought

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 
moving when he was talking I thought

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:25.790 
moving when he was talking I thought
that<00:04:24.610> was<00:04:24.700> so<00:04:24.910> weird

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:28.740 
but it was so surreal and I must admit

I<00:06:38.830> think<00:06:39.430> david<00:06:40.210> has<00:06:40.240> been<00:06:40.449> the<00:06:40.720> one<00:06:40.870> judge

00:06:41.129 --> 00:06:41.139 
I think david has been the one judge

00:06:41.139 --> 00:06:43.439 
I think david has been the one judge
that<00:06:41.410> has<00:06:41.560> really<00:06:41.770> really<00:06:42.039> supported<00:06:42.490> us<00:06:42.639> we

00:06:43.439 --> 00:06:43.449 
that has really really supported us we

00:06:43.449 --> 00:06:45.900 
that has really really supported us we
did<00:06:43.599> miss<00:06:43.750> distinct<00:06:44.229> for<00:06:44.440> him<00:06:44.650> and<00:06:45.009> he<00:06:45.639> came

did miss distinct for him and he came

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:47.550 
did miss distinct for him and he came
and<00:06:46.030> watch<00:06:46.150> this<00:06:46.330> in<00:06:46.479> panto<00:06:46.930> obviously<00:06:47.410> he's

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:47.560 
and watch this in panto obviously he's

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:50.159 
and watch this in panto obviously he's
done<00:06:47.710> the<00:06:47.800> film<00:06:48.039> now<00:06:48.280> and<00:06:48.750> so<00:06:49.750> yeah<00:06:49.930> he's

00:06:51.749 --> 00:06:51.759 
probably been the one judge that has

00:06:51.759 --> 00:06:53.909

yeah<00:07:28.030> I<00:07:28.389> try<00:07:28.720> and<00:07:29.139> think<00:07:29.530> of<00:07:29.710> new<00:07:30.039> tricks<00:07:30.370> which

00:07:30.779 --> 00:07:30.789

00:07:30.789 --> 00:07:32.670 
yeah I try and think of new tricks which
is<00:07:30.970> the<00:07:31.180> most<00:07:31.659> difficult<00:07:31.840> thing<00:07:32.139> because<00:07:32.440> if

00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:32.680 
is the most difficult thing because if

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:35.610 
is the most difficult thing because if
first<00:07:32.949> I<00:07:33.099> could<00:07:33.280> learn<00:07:33.909> everything<00:07:34.210> so<00:07:35.169> I<00:07:35.199> have

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:35.620 
first I could learn everything so I have

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:37.469 
first I could learn everything so I have
to<00:07:35.800> go<00:07:36.039> through<00:07:36.370> and<00:07:36.580> think<00:07:36.729> okay<00:07:37.030> what<00:07:37.270> and

00:07:37.469 --> 00:07:37.479 
to go through and think okay what and

00:07:37.479 --> 00:07:39.779 
to go through and think okay what and
what<00:07:37.690> new<00:07:37.900> ones<00:07:38.139> could<00:07:38.349> I<00:07:38.440> make<00:07:38.650> now<00:07:38.889> so<00:07:39.639> that's

00:07:39.779 --> 00:07:39.789 
what new ones could I make now so that's

00:07:39.789 --> 00:07:41.670 
what new ones could I make now so that's
probably<00:07:40.000> the<00:07:40.150> hardest<00:07:40.300> thing<00:07:41.139> for<00:07:41.169> me<00:07:41.349> so

00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:41.680 
probably the hardest thing for me so

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:43.740 
probably the hardest thing for me so
just<00:07:42.159> finally<00:07:42.400> what<00:07:42.580> is<00:07:42.669> the<00:07:42.789> future<00:07:43.270> hold<00:07:43.570> now

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:43.750 
just finally what is the future hold now
