00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.780
 v The song that Gundam boro rag that Shakti tea Karin always sings 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:15.570
 Would do important 1st and maybe No. 2 in the I have a No. 2 has been but just No. 2 used 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:17.250
 Young people if there is a future beyond the example star while scattered the spread specific poor skin dream of wings 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.020
 Go on a journey 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:25.420
 Yes this song completely space colonization 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:30.640
 It's a song, so in the flower of a daisies is such a flower 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:31.090
 If you turn it upside down, it's almost like a shuttle's vernier traveling to space 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:35.110
 Or 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:39.520
 A lot of verniers blink in the sky 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:40.010
 It looks like a flower garden of a daisies-would it be a song called 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.629
 follow 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:50.059
 It is a song that clearly sings what Earth has left 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:51.890
 Space colonization first generation in is that I think we said burning in quite hope, particularly among young people 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:01:00.030
 You can also guess that 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:01:06.510
 Although it was not the forced migration but the people who missed this place were old people, they remained on the earth 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:09.810
 If I was forced to force a space immigrant, there would be no information 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:15.540
 I mean that Shakti is singing this 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:16.320
 Activision also it's a space isoprenoid from I also grew up in 2 again mother of Shakti 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.670
 Right 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:27.180
 But that has already taken root as Ryuta here 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:33.600
 Say Rutte not longer the folk songs of why the universe city for a song to be sent out to the universe from Earth 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:36.310
 Be referred to the person who left it to the Earth is also Ya after being moved to another universe and that 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:40.360
 Yu What I think you can guess 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:44.680
 The thing is that Zanskar empire is that 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:51.789
 I'm home to the source of this song 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:56.330
 I would like to go home as a hometown recongista on the planet because it is the descendant of those who were forced to emigrate 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:02:03.380
 The place is of course in the land umbrella Reria European origin of this song 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:04.250
 Because Aaron is doing that anti-system movement Rigamilitia also wants to live here 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:11.950
 Because I 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:11.950
 I'm such that the side two of civil war that have the same roots v Gundam
