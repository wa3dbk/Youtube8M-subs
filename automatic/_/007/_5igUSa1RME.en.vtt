of crunch in here makes it more meteor
and<00:06:10.399> satisfying<00:06:10.969> especially<00:06:11.389> with<00:06:11.479> the

00:06:11.529 --> 00:06:11.539 
and satisfying especially with the

00:06:11.539 --> 00:06:15.959 
and satisfying especially with the
tomatoes<00:06:11.930> as<00:06:12.080> well<00:06:12.459> but<00:06:13.459> um<00:06:13.639> has<00:06:14.569> a<00:06:14.599> very<00:06:15.019> good

00:06:15.959 --> 00:06:15.969 
tomatoes as well but um has a very good

00:06:15.969 --> 00:06:20.049 
tomatoes as well but um has a very good
flavor<00:06:16.969> almost<00:06:17.509> sort<00:06:17.749> of<00:06:17.870> like<00:06:18.050> a<00:06:18.080> mesquite<00:06:19.059> so

00:06:20.049 --> 00:06:20.059 
flavor almost sort of like a mesquite so

00:06:20.059 --> 00:06:22.869 
flavor almost sort of like a mesquite so
it's<00:06:20.209> definitely<00:06:20.689> like<00:06:20.959> a<00:06:20.990> chili<00:06:21.379> I<00:06:21.800> have<00:06:22.669> made

00:06:22.869 --> 00:06:22.879 
it's definitely like a chili I have made

00:06:22.879 --> 00:06:25.629 
it's definitely like a chili I have made
others<00:06:23.209> before<00:06:24.009> different<00:06:25.009> ingredients<00:06:25.519> and

00:06:25.629 --> 00:06:25.639 
others before different ingredients and

00:06:25.639 --> 00:06:27.549 
others before different ingredients and
it<00:06:25.729> didn't<00:06:25.909> taste<00:06:26.029> anything<00:06:26.330> like<00:06:26.509> chili<00:06:26.990> so

00:06:27.549 --> 00:06:27.559 
it didn't taste anything like chili so

00:06:27.559 --> 00:06:29.619 
it didn't taste anything like chili so
this<00:06:27.709> is<00:06:27.860> definitely<00:06:28.069> a<00:06:28.370> big<00:06:28.610> improvement<00:06:28.669> and

00:06:29.619 --> 00:06:29.629 
this is definitely a big improvement and

00:06:29.629 --> 00:06:32.679 
this is definitely a big improvement and
I<00:06:30.319> would<00:06:30.499> make<00:06:30.709> it<00:06:30.830> again<00:06:31.300> and<00:06:32.300> I<00:06:32.389> know<00:06:32.449> it's

00:06:32.679 --> 00:06:32.689 
I would make it again and I know it's

00:06:32.689 --> 00:06:35.399 
I would make it again and I know it's
going<00:06:32.870> to<00:06:32.959> be<00:06:33.110> very<00:06:33.139> good<00:06:33.849> all<00:06:34.849> right<00:06:35.120> enjoy
