desktop and the new Celtx shots app for
the<00:00:10.230> iPad<00:00:10.559> so<00:00:11.400> what<00:00:11.820> I've<00:00:11.969> done<00:00:12.090> here<00:00:12.300> is<00:00:12.480> I've

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
the iPad so what I've done here is I've

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.849 
the iPad so what I've done here is I've
taken<00:00:14.420> extracted<00:00:15.420> a<00:00:15.690> part<00:00:16.109> of<00:00:16.350> a<00:00:16.470> script

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
taken extracted a part of a script

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.450 
taken extracted a part of a script
written<00:00:17.670> previously<00:00:17.970> in<00:00:18.750> Celtx<00:00:19.470> to<00:00:20.070> use<00:00:20.189> as<00:00:20.340> an

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
written previously in Celtx to use as an

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.990 
written previously in Celtx to use as an
example<00:00:20.550> so<00:00:21.439> yeah<00:00:22.439> let's<00:00:22.890> just<00:00:23.189> export<00:00:23.880> the

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
example so yeah let's just export the

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.339 
example so yeah let's just export the
script<00:00:24.300> to<00:00:24.869> the<00:00:25.439> iPad<00:00:26.220> and<00:00:26.570> I<00:00:27.570> need<00:00:27.930> add<00:00:28.140> an

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
script to the iPad and I need add an

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:29.929 
script to the iPad and I need add an
extra<00:00:28.650> scene<00:00:28.920> that's<00:00:29.189> not<00:00:29.340> really<00:00:29.580> there<00:00:29.730> but

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
extra scene that's not really there but

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.700 
extra scene that's not really there but
just<00:00:30.150> it's<00:00:30.420> just<00:00:30.510> for<00:00:30.990> demonstration

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
just it's just for demonstration

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.770

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
purposes so you can see how it works

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.479 
purposes so you can see how it works
with<00:00:33.960> multiple<00:00:34.110> scenes<00:00:34.590> in<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:34.920> script<00:00:35.010> when

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
with multiple scenes in the script when

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.639 
with multiple scenes in the script when
you<00:00:35.640> come<00:00:36.000> into<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.450> storyboarding<00:00:37.260> app<00:00:37.380> on

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
you come into the storyboarding app on

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.110 
you come into the storyboarding app on
the<00:00:37.770> iPad<00:00:38.100> so<00:00:38.129> yeah<00:00:38.840> script<00:00:39.840> exported<00:00:40.350> so

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:41.120 
the iPad so yeah script exported so

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.440 
the iPad so yeah script exported so
let's<00:00:42.120> move<00:00:42.300> over<00:00:42.510> to<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.930> iPad<00:00:43.079> and<00:00:44.329> see<00:00:45.329> what

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
let's move over to the iPad and see what

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.830 
let's move over to the iPad and see what
we<00:00:45.539> can<00:00:45.690> do<00:00:45.780> with<00:00:45.930> it<00:00:46.670> I'm<00:00:47.670> sorry<00:00:48.000> about<00:00:48.510> the

we can do with it I'm sorry about the

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.500 
we can do with it I'm sorry about the

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
recording quality but yeah it's not the

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:52.850 
recording quality but yeah it's not the
most<00:00:51.690> easiest<00:00:52.110> thing<00:00:52.320> in<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.440> world<00:00:52.530> to

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
most easiest thing in the world to

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.670 
most easiest thing in the world to
record<00:00:53.250> an<00:00:53.399> iPad<00:00:53.760> screen<00:00:54.170> but<00:00:55.170> yeah<00:00:55.410> here<00:00:55.649> we

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
record an iPad screen but yeah here we

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:56.000 
record an iPad screen but yeah here we
go

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
go

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.049

okay<00:00:56.430> this<00:00:57.300> is<00:00:57.420> just<00:00:57.600> some<00:00:59.059> demonstration

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
okay this is just some demonstration

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.900 
okay this is just some demonstration
storyboard<00:01:00.570> that<00:01:00.690> were<00:01:00.809> included<00:01:01.320> with<00:01:01.910> me

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
storyboard that were included with me

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.640 
storyboard that were included with me
playing<00:01:03.149> around<00:01:03.210> so<00:01:03.539> let's<00:01:03.660> import<00:01:04.320> the

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
playing around so let's import the

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.160 
playing around so let's import the
script<00:01:05.040> from<00:01:05.280> Celtic<00:01:05.610> sink<00:01:05.970> so<00:01:06.810> this<00:01:06.930> is<00:01:07.080> the

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
script from Celtic sink so this is the

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.050 
script from Celtic sink so this is the
script<00:01:07.380> we<00:01:07.590> just<00:01:07.740> exported<00:01:08.130> from<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:08.670> desktop

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
script we just exported from the desktop

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.060 
script we just exported from the desktop
so<00:01:09.659> I<00:01:10.080> will<00:01:10.650> open<00:01:11.430> it<00:01:11.670> now<00:01:11.820> in<00:01:12.090> in<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:13.110> app<00:01:13.200> and

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
so I will open it now in in the app and

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.440 
so I will open it now in in the app and
immediately<00:01:15.409> we<00:01:16.409> get<00:01:16.619> a<00:01:17.280> storyboard<00:01:17.880> set<00:01:18.299> up

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
immediately we get a storyboard set up

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.960 
immediately we get a storyboard set up
with<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:19.080> correct<00:01:19.710> name<00:01:20.390> and<00:01:21.390> we<00:01:22.259> have<00:01:22.439> the

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:22.970 
with the correct name and we have the

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:27.260 
with the correct name and we have the
two<00:01:23.970> scenes<00:01:25.250> divider<00:01:26.250> here<00:01:26.369> or<00:01:26.729> split<00:01:27.000> up<00:01:27.119> as

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
two scenes divider here or split up as

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.990 
two scenes divider here or split up as
two<00:01:27.450> sequences<00:01:27.960> and<00:01:28.400> there's<00:01:29.400> a<00:01:29.490> bug<00:01:29.729> here

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
two sequences and there's a bug here

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.340 
two sequences and there's a bug here
apparently

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
apparently

because<00:02:18.970> it<00:02:19.209> works<00:02:19.390> pretty<00:02:19.569> much<00:02:19.720> the<00:02:19.840> same<00:02:19.930> so

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
because it works pretty much the same so

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.280 
because it works pretty much the same so
I<00:02:21.280> have<00:02:21.550> a<00:02:21.600> storyboard<00:02:22.600> here<00:02:22.690> I<00:02:22.780> previously

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
I have a storyboard here I previously

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.630 
I have a storyboard here I previously
drawn<00:02:23.739> that<00:02:24.700> I<00:02:24.760> imported<00:02:25.569> into<00:02:25.690> my<00:02:25.980> iPad<00:02:26.980> image

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
drawn that I imported into my iPad image

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.390 
drawn that I imported into my iPad image
library<00:02:28.000> so<00:02:28.720> I<00:02:28.780> can<00:02:28.930> just<00:02:29.080> select<00:02:29.319> images<00:02:29.890> from

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
library so I can just select images from

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.540 
library so I can just select images from
from<00:02:31.000> this<00:02:31.180> storyboard<00:02:31.750> and<00:02:32.130> add<00:02:33.130> to<00:02:33.430> this

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
from this storyboard and add to this

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.089 
from this storyboard and add to this
sequence<00:02:34.209> and<00:02:34.630> if<00:02:35.019> you<00:02:35.140> have<00:02:35.290> I<00:02:35.530> have<00:02:35.680> an<00:02:35.800> iPad

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:36.099 
sequence and if you have I have an iPad

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:39.720 
sequence and if you have I have an iPad
one<00:02:36.310> if<00:02:36.519> you<00:02:36.670> have<00:02:36.790> an<00:02:36.880> iPad<00:02:37.209> 2<00:02:38.430> you<00:02:39.430> can<00:02:39.610> of

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
one if you have an iPad 2 you can of

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.340 
one if you have an iPad 2 you can of
course<00:02:39.760> use<00:02:40.180> the<00:02:40.360> built-in<00:02:40.690> camera<00:02:41.140> to

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
course use the built-in camera to

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:45.150 
course use the built-in camera to
capture<00:02:41.819> photos<00:02:42.819> right<00:02:43.510> away<00:02:43.840> into<00:02:44.440> into<00:02:44.980> your

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
capture photos right away into into your

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.539 
capture photos right away into into your
storyboard<00:02:45.760> which<00:02:46.299> I<00:02:46.540> believe<00:02:47.170> is<00:02:47.650> very<00:02:47.980> very

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:48.549 
storyboard which I believe is very very

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:52.110 
storyboard which I believe is very very
handy<00:02:49.000> if<00:02:49.090> you<00:02:49.239> work<00:02:49.450> in<00:02:50.130> in<00:02:51.130> on<00:02:51.519> the<00:02:51.760> location

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
handy if you work in in on the location

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.500 
handy if you work in in on the location
with<00:02:52.720> live<00:02:53.290> live<00:02:53.890> footage<00:02:54.220> I<00:02:54.610> work<00:02:54.940> animation

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
with live live footage I work animation

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.979 
with live live footage I work animation
so<00:02:55.690> for<00:02:55.870> me<00:02:55.959> it's<00:02:56.230> not<00:02:57.480> the<00:02:58.480> camera<00:02:58.810> is<00:02:58.870> not

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 
so for me it's not the camera is not

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:01.590 
so for me it's not the camera is not
that<00:02:59.140> important<00:02:59.560> to<00:02:59.650> me<00:02:59.680> but<00:03:00.250> for<00:03:00.610> a<00:03:00.940> life<00:03:01.120> my

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600 
that important to me but for a life my

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.240 
that important to me but for a life my
way<00:03:01.750> I<00:03:01.930> can<00:03:02.140> really<00:03:02.350> see<00:03:02.590> where<00:03:02.799> that<00:03:02.980> can<00:03:03.160> be

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
way I can really see where that can be

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.539 
way I can really see where that can be
useful<00:03:03.549> but<00:03:04.390> I<00:03:04.750> draw<00:03:05.709> on<00:03:05.860> my<00:03:05.980> storyboards<00:03:06.459> by

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:06.549 
useful but I draw on my storyboards by

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:08.940 
useful but I draw on my storyboards by
hand<00:03:06.760> and<00:03:06.970> I<00:03:07.060> often<00:03:07.959> draw<00:03:08.170> the<00:03:08.230> storyboards<00:03:08.769> on

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
hand and I often draw the storyboards on

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.920 
hand and I often draw the storyboards on
the<00:03:09.130> iPad<00:03:09.459> in<00:03:09.819> an<00:03:10.090> application<00:03:10.600> called<00:03:10.690> Pro

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
the iPad in an application called Pro

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.380 
the iPad in an application called Pro
crate<00:03:11.230> which<00:03:11.470> is<00:03:11.620> very<00:03:11.829> nice<00:03:11.980> to<00:03:12.160> draw<00:03:12.370> in<00:03:12.489> so

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.550 

this<00:03:16.390> will<00:03:16.540> be<00:03:16.660> very<00:03:16.780> handy<00:03:16.959> to<00:03:17.200> combine<00:03:17.440> those

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
this will be very handy to combine those

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:18.360 
this will be very handy to combine those
two<00:03:17.739> anyway

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
two anyway

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.449 
two anyway
and<00:03:18.579> for<00:03:19.060> each<00:03:19.440> storyboard<00:03:20.440> frame<00:03:20.650> you<00:03:21.220> can

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
and for each storyboard frame you can

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:24.630 
and for each storyboard frame you can
make<00:03:21.760> a<00:03:21.790> sketch<00:03:22.350> to<00:03:23.350> block<00:03:23.890> out<00:03:24.070> how<00:03:24.430> you're

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
make a sketch to block out how you're

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.970 
make a sketch to block out how you're
going<00:03:24.880> to<00:03:25.000> do<00:03:25.150> make<00:03:25.329> the<00:03:25.480> shot<00:03:25.660> so<00:03:26.380> I<00:03:26.410> went<00:03:26.829> into

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
going to do make the shot so I went into

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:28.410 
going to do make the shot so I went into
the<00:03:27.160> sketch<00:03:27.370> mode<00:03:27.609> here<00:03:27.760> for<00:03:27.940> the<00:03:28.000> first<00:03:28.180> frame

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
the sketch mode here for the first frame

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.170 
the sketch mode here for the first frame
and<00:03:28.690> you<00:03:28.900> have<00:03:29.079> a<00:03:29.590> library<00:03:30.070> click<00:03:30.459> pot<00:03:30.730> for

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
and you have a library click pot for

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.060 
and you have a library click pot for
useful<00:03:31.510> symbols<00:03:31.989> when<00:03:32.440> you<00:03:32.530> sketch<00:03:32.739> out<00:03:32.890> so

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:33.070 
useful symbols when you sketch out so

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:34.319 
useful symbols when you sketch out so
here<00:03:33.220> you<00:03:33.310> have<00:03:33.459> a<00:03:33.489> bunch<00:03:33.970> of<00:03:34.120> different

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:34.329 
here you have a bunch of different

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:36.840 
here you have a bunch of different
camera<00:03:34.810> symbols<00:03:35.200> you<00:03:35.320> can<00:03:35.470> work<00:03:35.709> with<00:03:35.920> and<00:03:36.340> I

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:36.850 
camera symbols you can work with and I

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:38.819 
camera symbols you can work with and I
draw<00:03:37.090> out<00:03:37.120> the<00:03:37.390> rectangle<00:03:37.600> here<00:03:38.109> because<00:03:38.500> this

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:38.829 
draw out the rectangle here because this

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:43.470 
draw out the rectangle here because this
scene<00:03:39.100> is<00:03:39.900> taking<00:03:40.900> place<00:03:41.109> on<00:03:41.440> a<00:03:41.470> on<00:03:41.950> a<00:03:42.010> roof<00:03:42.549> so

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
scene is taking place on a on a roof so

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.289 
scene is taking place on a on a roof so
the<00:03:43.959> stack<00:03:44.230> rectangle<00:03:44.920> will<00:03:45.130> symbolize<00:03:45.519> the

00:03:46.289 --> 00:03:46.299 
the stack rectangle will symbolize the

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:50.509 
the stack rectangle will symbolize the
roof<00:03:46.540> for<00:03:47.019> me<00:03:47.140> and<00:03:47.470> of<00:03:48.190> course<00:03:48.630> you<00:03:49.630> can<00:03:49.840> also

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 
roof for me and of course you can also

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:52.650 
roof for me and of course you can also
probably<00:03:51.519> get<00:03:51.700> the<00:03:51.910> roof

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:52.660 
probably get the roof

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.470 
probably get the roof
click<00:03:53.049> part<00:03:53.319> but<00:03:53.620> I<00:03:54.130> only<00:03:54.700> have<00:03:54.910> the<00:03:55.060> basic

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
click part but I only have the basic

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.059 
click part but I only have the basic
click<00:03:55.660> part<00:03:55.870> setup<00:03:56.230> there<00:03:56.500> is<00:03:56.590> a<00:03:56.620> bunch<00:03:56.859> of

00:03:57.059 --> 00:03:57.069 
click part setup there is a bunch of

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:59.970 
click part setup there is a bunch of
other<00:03:57.250> I<00:03:57.670> will<00:03:58.180> show<00:03:58.299> you<00:03:58.359> later<00:03:58.540> but<00:03:58.980> but

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
download so well let's just take an

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.210 
download so well let's just take an
arrow<00:04:06.579> arrow<00:04:06.970> to<00:04:07.510> to<00:04:08.380> show<00:04:08.530> how<00:04:08.739> I'm<00:04:08.889> going<00:04:09.069> to

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.220 
arrow arrow to to show how I'm going to

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.150 
arrow arrow to to show how I'm going to
move<00:04:09.370> the<00:04:09.519> camera<00:04:09.880> in<00:04:10.090> this<00:04:10.780> shot<00:04:10.959> because<00:04:11.859> I'm

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:12.160 
move the camera in this shot because I'm

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.210 
move the camera in this shot because I'm
going<00:04:12.370> to<00:04:12.549> let<00:04:12.880> it<00:04:12.910> fly<00:04:13.150> by<00:04:13.180> the<00:04:13.420> roof<00:04:13.660> so<00:04:14.349> yeah

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
going to let it fly by the roof so yeah

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.240 
going to let it fly by the roof so yeah
very<00:04:15.430> simple<00:04:16.120> sketch<00:04:16.510> but<00:04:16.780> it<00:04:16.959> will<00:04:17.080> it<00:04:18.039> will

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250 
very simple sketch but it will it will

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:19.160 
very simple sketch but it will it will
tell<00:04:18.820> me<00:04:18.940> how

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:19.170 
tell me how

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:20.270 
tell me how
want<00:04:19.290> to<00:04:19.380> make<00:04:19.500> the<00:04:19.620> show<00:04:19.770> and<00:04:19.980> then<00:04:20.070> I<00:04:20.130> can

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
want to make the show and then I can

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:21.560 
want to make the show and then I can
continue<00:04:20.370> make<00:04:20.820> a<00:04:20.850> sketch<00:04:21.120> for<00:04:21.240> each<00:04:21.390> and

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
continue make a sketch for each and

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:24.020 
continue make a sketch for each and
every<00:04:21.750> frame<00:04:21.870> how<00:04:22.220> with<00:04:23.220> using<00:04:23.610> the<00:04:23.730> building

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
every frame how with using the building

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.750 
every frame how with using the building
clip<00:04:24.180> parts<00:04:24.420> and<00:04:24.750> things<00:04:25.140> like<00:04:25.230> that<00:04:25.410> and<00:04:25.860> keep

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 
clip parts and things like that and keep

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.810 
clip parts and things like that and keep
working<00:04:27.000> on<00:04:27.710> designing<00:04:28.710> and<00:04:28.950> for<00:04:29.070> each<00:04:29.130> just

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:29.820 
working on designing and for each just

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:31.250 
working on designing and for each just
like<00:04:29.940> in<00:04:30.180> the<00:04:30.300> desk<00:04:30.480> fabrication<00:04:30.990> for<00:04:31.170> each

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:31.260 
like in the desk fabrication for each

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.640 
like in the desk fabrication for each
frame<00:04:31.950> here<00:04:32.250> you<00:04:32.700> can<00:04:32.880> select<00:04:33.180> the<00:04:33.600> shot<00:04:34.410> type

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
frame here you can select the shot type

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:36.590 
frame here you can select the shot type
if<00:04:34.950> it's<00:04:35.100> a<00:04:35.130> wide<00:04:35.310> shot<00:04:35.550> a<00:04:35.610> point<00:04:36.240> of<00:04:36.390> view<00:04:36.480> a

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:36.600 
if it's a wide shot a point of view a

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.060 
if it's a wide shot a point of view a
panning<00:04:36.930> shot<00:04:36.960> then<00:04:37.350> you<00:04:37.440> can<00:04:37.590> write<00:04:37.740> a<00:04:37.770> short

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:38.070 
panning shot then you can write a short

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:40.850 
panning shot then you can write a short
description<00:04:38.190> and<00:04:39.230> this<00:04:40.230> will<00:04:40.380> also<00:04:40.530> show<00:04:40.830> up

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 
description and this will also show up

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.660 
description and this will also show up
when<00:04:41.160> you<00:04:41.250> play<00:04:41.490> the<00:04:41.910> story<00:04:42.060> but<00:04:42.270> later<00:04:42.480> on<00:04:42.690> so

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:43.670 
when you play the story but later on so

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:49.700 
when you play the story but later on so
pretty<00:04:44.670> handy<00:04:45.080> and<00:04:47.060> yeah<00:04:48.080> especially<00:04:49.080> the

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
pretty handy and yeah especially the

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:52.010 
pretty handy and yeah especially the
shot<00:04:49.890> type<00:04:50.130> is<00:04:50.670> something<00:04:51.000> I<00:04:51.090> find<00:04:51.360> useful<00:04:51.600> to

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.020 
shot type is something I find useful to

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:55.220 
shot type is something I find useful to
note<00:04:52.740> on<00:04:53.010> each<00:04:53.040> storyboard<00:04:53.700> frame<00:04:53.940> and<00:04:54.270> if<00:04:55.110> you

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:55.230 
note on each storyboard frame and if you

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:57.550 
note on each storyboard frame and if you
have<00:04:55.350> a<00:04:55.380> large<00:04:55.830> storyboard<00:04:56.250> we<00:04:56.340> can<00:04:56.520> navigate

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:57.560 
have a large storyboard we can navigate

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.290 
have a large storyboard we can navigate
with<00:04:58.560> the<00:04:58.590> scene<00:04:58.890> headings<00:04:59.250> in<00:04:59.430> that<00:04:59.580> menu<00:05:00.000> and

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:00.300 
with the scene headings in that menu and

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.030 
with the scene headings in that menu and
you<00:05:00.780> can<00:05:00.930> switch<00:05:01.110> between<00:05:01.320> only<00:05:01.770> seeing<00:05:01.950> the

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:02.040 
you can switch between only seeing the

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:04.430 
you can switch between only seeing the
sketches<00:05:02.640> only<00:05:03.060> seen<00:05:03.240> in<00:05:03.330> the<00:05:03.510> storyboard

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.440 
sketches only seen in the storyboard

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:06.020 
sketches only seen in the storyboard
images<00:05:04.800> were<00:05:05.130> seeing<00:05:05.340> both<00:05:05.610> of<00:05:05.760> them<00:05:05.880> at<00:05:05.970> the

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:06.030 
images were seeing both of them at the

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:08.180 
images were seeing both of them at the
same<00:05:06.120> time<00:05:06.240> so<00:05:06.630> you<00:05:06.720> can<00:05:06.930> so<00:05:07.800> you<00:05:07.860> can<00:05:08.010> filter

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:08.190 
same time so you can so you can filter

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:10.610 
same time so you can so you can filter
it<00:05:08.340> down<00:05:08.550> a<00:05:08.580> bit<00:05:08.760> and<00:05:09.360> just<00:05:09.810> like<00:05:10.200> in<00:05:10.320> desktop

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:10.620 
it down a bit and just like in desktop

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:14.120 
it down a bit and just like in desktop
app<00:05:10.740> as<00:05:10.920> well<00:05:11.160> you<00:05:11.400> have<00:05:11.430> a<00:05:12.590> player<00:05:13.590> for<00:05:14.040> the

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:14.130 
app as well you have a player for the

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:16.880 
app as well you have a player for the
storyboard<00:05:14.580> so<00:05:14.970> you<00:05:15.060> can<00:05:15.320> play<00:05:16.320> it<00:05:16.410> up<00:05:16.590> and<00:05:16.830> you

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:16.890 
storyboard so you can play it up and you

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:19.100 
storyboard so you can play it up and you
can<00:05:16.980> set<00:05:17.160> the<00:05:17.310> timing<00:05:17.940> or<00:05:18.210> the<00:05:18.240> speed<00:05:18.540> I<00:05:18.930> don't

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:19.110 
can set the timing or the speed I don't

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:20.630 
can set the timing or the speed I don't
think<00:05:19.230> you<00:05:19.290> can<00:05:19.380> set<00:05:19.500> up<00:05:19.620> our<00:05:19.770> frame<00:05:20.070> unfort<00:05:20.520> I

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:20.640 
think you can set up our frame unfort I

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:23.110 
think you can set up our frame unfort I
can<00:05:21.510> only<00:05:21.630> set<00:05:21.780> the<00:05:21.810> timing<00:05:22.230> for<00:05:22.470> the<00:05:22.590> entire

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:23.120 
can only set the timing for the entire

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.630 
can only set the timing for the entire
entire<00:05:24.120> shot<00:05:24.420> or<00:05:24.690> the<00:05:24.900> entire<00:05:25.170> storyboard<00:05:26.070> it

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:26.640 
entire shot or the entire storyboard it

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:29.870 
entire shot or the entire storyboard it
will<00:05:26.790> be<00:05:26.940> pretty<00:05:27.240> handy<00:05:27.480> to<00:05:27.660> set<00:05:27.930> per<00:05:28.880> frame

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:29.880 
will be pretty handy to set per frame

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:33.410 
will be pretty handy to set per frame
and<00:05:30.630> what<00:05:30.960> they<00:05:31.080> can<00:05:31.290> show<00:05:31.830> us<00:05:31.980> not<00:05:32.420> display

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:33.420 
and what they can show us not display

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:35.660 
and what they can show us not display
the<00:05:34.020> sketches<00:05:34.470> here<00:05:34.650> but<00:05:35.190> only<00:05:35.400> the

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:35.670 
the sketches here but only the

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:40.150 
the sketches here but only the
storyboard<00:05:36.210> images<00:05:36.540> and<00:05:37.410> so<00:05:37.650> on<00:05:37.860> so<00:05:38.210> you<00:05:39.210> can

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:40.160 
storyboard images and so on so you can

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:46.790 
storyboard images and so on so you can
tweak<00:05:41.160> it<00:05:41.310> a<00:05:41.370> little<00:05:41.490> bit<00:05:41.730> in<00:05:41.910> a<00:05:41.940> way<00:05:42.000> and<00:05:45.800> well

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:46.800 
tweak it a little bit in a way and well

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.700 
tweak it a little bit in a way and well
I<00:05:47.220> guess<00:05:48.120> that's<00:05:48.450> pretty<00:05:48.600> much<00:05:48.720> it<00:05:48.990> you<00:05:49.560> can

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:49.710 
I guess that's pretty much it you can

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:51.680 
I guess that's pretty much it you can
add<00:05:49.830> you<00:05:50.520> can<00:05:50.550> add<00:05:50.730> a<00:05:50.760> new<00:05:50.910> sequence<00:05:51.330> of<00:05:51.450> course

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:51.690 
add you can add a new sequence of course

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:52.640 
add you can add a new sequence of course
that's<00:05:51.810> weren't<00:05:52.020> in<00:05:52.200> the<00:05:52.290> script<00:05:52.530> really

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:52.650 
that's weren't in the script really

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:55.220 
that's weren't in the script really
because<00:05:53.220> perhaps<00:05:54.000> you<00:05:54.180> had<00:05:54.420> part<00:05:55.020> of<00:05:55.170> the

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:55.230 
because perhaps you had part of the

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:56.930 
because perhaps you had part of the
script<00:05:55.470> and<00:05:55.650> then<00:05:55.740> you<00:05:55.860> keep<00:05:56.130> working<00:05:56.460> so<00:05:56.850> you

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:56.940 
script and then you keep working so you

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:59.690 
script and then you keep working so you
can<00:05:57.090> just<00:05:57.210> add<00:05:57.780> new<00:05:58.530> secrets<00:05:58.950> or<00:05:59.100> if<00:05:59.280> you<00:05:59.430> start

00:05:59.690 --> 00:05:59.700 
can just add new secrets or if you start

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:01.940 
can just add new secrets or if you start
working<00:06:00.030> on<00:06:00.270> a<00:06:00.360> storyboard<00:06:00.870> from<00:06:01.230> scratch<00:06:01.590> as

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:01.950 
working on a storyboard from scratch as

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:03.710 
working on a storyboard from scratch as
well<00:06:02.010> it's<00:06:02.760> not<00:06:02.970> always<00:06:03.150> that<00:06:03.450> you<00:06:03.510> have<00:06:03.690> a

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:03.720 
well it's not always that you have a

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:07.190 
well it's not always that you have a
script<00:06:03.960> to<00:06:04.290> work<00:06:04.320> on<00:06:05.120> that<00:06:06.120> you<00:06:06.240> can<00:06:06.390> import<00:06:06.660> so

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:07.200 
script to work on that you can import so

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:11.660 
script to work on that you can import so
yep<00:06:07.860> so<00:06:08.280> you<00:06:09.090> can<00:06:09.240> add<00:06:09.770> new<00:06:10.770> secrecy<00:06:11.220> wantin

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:11.670 
yep so you can add new secrecy wantin
