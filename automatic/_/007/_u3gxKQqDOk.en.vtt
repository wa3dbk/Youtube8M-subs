around<00:04:48.150> the<00:04:48.300> outside<00:04:48.720> of<00:04:48.870> the<00:04:48.990> street<00:04:49.289> before

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:49.380 
around the outside of the street before

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:52.430 
around the outside of the street before
long<00:04:50.180> I'm<00:04:51.180> going<00:04:51.389> to<00:04:51.479> excavate<00:04:51.960> around<00:04:52.289> the

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.440 
long I'm going to excavate around the

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.200 
long I'm going to excavate around the
outside<00:04:52.830> of<00:04:52.860> the<00:04:53.099> tree<00:04:53.310> before<00:04:53.460> long<00:04:53.820> to<00:04:54.030> see

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:54.210 
outside of the tree before long to see

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:55.820 
outside of the tree before long to see
if<00:04:54.270> maybe<00:04:54.449> I<00:04:54.630> can<00:04:54.840> find<00:04:55.050> some<00:04:55.229> arrowheads<00:04:55.680> or

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:55.830 
if maybe I can find some arrowheads or

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:59.629 
if maybe I can find some arrowheads or
things<00:04:57.380> say<00:04:58.380> a<00:04:58.409> little<00:04:58.680> bit<00:04:58.770> more<00:04:59.010> in<00:04:59.280> depth

00:04:59.629 --> 00:04:59.639 
things say a little bit more in depth

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:09.010 
things say a little bit more in depth
the<00:04:59.820> inside<00:05:00.240> the<00:05:00.449> tree<00:05:06.650> what<00:05:07.650> this<00:05:08.400> thing

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:09.020 
the inside the tree what this thing

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:11.810 
the inside the tree what this thing
that's<00:05:10.020> the<00:05:10.199> tree<00:05:10.440> really<00:05:11.159> yes

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:11.820 
that's the tree really yes

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:13.820 
that's the tree really yes
how<00:05:12.060> did<00:05:12.180> they<00:05:12.270> make<00:05:12.389> it<00:05:12.449> like<00:05:12.630> that<00:05:12.830> combining

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:13.830 
how did they make it like that combining

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:16.339 
how did they make it like that combining
it<00:05:14.310> okay<00:05:14.729> built<00:05:14.940> by<00:05:15.120> this<00:05:15.180> burn

00:05:16.339 --> 00:05:16.349 
it okay built by this burn

00:05:16.349 --> 00:05:18.620 
it okay built by this burn
that's<00:05:16.979> charcoal<00:05:17.490> it's<00:05:17.639> a<00:05:17.820> charcoal<00:05:18.389> from

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:18.630 
that's charcoal it's a charcoal from

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:21.320 
that's charcoal it's a charcoal from
fire<00:05:19.250> I'm<00:05:20.250> going<00:05:20.370> to<00:05:20.460> step<00:05:20.639> back<00:05:20.820> and<00:05:21.120> show<00:05:21.300> you

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:21.330 
fire I'm going to step back and show you

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:23.810 
fire I'm going to step back and show you
this<00:05:21.630> where<00:05:22.620> I<00:05:22.740> stand<00:05:23.010> next<00:05:23.190> to<00:05:23.340> the<00:05:23.490> base<00:05:23.639> so

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:23.820 
this where I stand next to the base so

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:26.270 
this where I stand next to the base so
it's<00:05:23.970> just<00:05:24.060> something<00:05:24.240> get<00:05:24.510> an<00:05:24.599> idea<00:05:25.280> how

it's just something get an idea how
large<00:05:26.460> the<00:05:26.729> tree<00:05:26.909> actually<00:05:27.330> is<00:05:27.479> there<00:05:27.630> you<00:05:27.750> go

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:28.310 
large the tree actually is there you go

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:34.670 
large the tree actually is there you go
I'm<00:05:29.310> gonna<00:05:29.430> do<00:05:29.580> a<00:05:29.610> slow<00:05:29.849> scan<00:05:30.210> up

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:34.680 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:38.070 

gigantic<00:05:35.680> tree<00:05:35.979> I<00:05:36.190> mean<00:05:36.460> it's<00:05:36.610> just<00:05:37.080> it's

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:38.080 
gigantic tree I mean it's just it's

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.340 
gigantic tree I mean it's just it's
beautiful<00:05:38.410> out<00:05:38.740> here

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:40.350 
beautiful out here

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:42.900 
beautiful out here
but<00:05:41.350> anyway<00:05:41.620> that's<00:05:41.800> our<00:05:42.039> trip<00:05:42.310> to<00:05:42.580> the<00:05:42.699> tree

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:42.910 
but anyway that's our trip to the tree

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:45.870 
but anyway that's our trip to the tree
thank<00:05:43.690> you
