 view it from the other side a problem osn 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.740
 that is a good idea beautiful 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.080
 I can solve the problem 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.080
 who could not need more 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.870

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.009
 everyone who had to get the bottlenecks since I started not getting anymore 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.149
 the state wants to be voted 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:10.849
 but you're actually not 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:13.849
 where I am sitting 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:18.099
 there is a sidewalk cover 

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:22.049
 sick in the Sickness Benefits Act 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:23.809

00:02:41.719 --> 00:02:45.079
 potter is back at the table 

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:47.549

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:49.619
 justice hopes 

00:02:49.619 --> 00:02:55.399

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:04.399
 I know one 

00:03:04.399 --> 00:03:07.849
 you can't go there anyway and this one was murdered 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:09.599
 in the years thereafter 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:12.429
 you can let them look into your mind 

00:03:12.429 --> 00:03:15.619
 now you have to come up with something that doesn't exist 

00:03:15.619 --> 00:03:18.669
 when i look it is not so sit of course does not exist 

00:03:19.669 --> 00:03:20.570
 what is this 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:24.100
 to bundle the knowledge that has been created in that pavement to sit with 

00:03:24.869 --> 00:03:26.249
 who is not on the pitch 

00:03:26.249 --> 00:03:27.499
 good news

 they still sat in a chair 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:42.149
 I think they make up his paper 

00:03:42.149 --> 00:03:44.539
 you should think about that 

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:46.729
 in the same way on the site 

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:49.999
 however, it consists of 

00:03:49.999 --> 00:03:51.919
 that here the text 

00:03:51.919 --> 00:03:53.759
 and pictures on 

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:56.759
 that if needed would not be the case 

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:00.649
