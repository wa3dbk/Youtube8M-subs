00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 for me it is very important that cosmetics do not 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.690
 tested on animals i won't 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.120
 embed video scary pictures if 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.889
 you must see them yourself but always 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.400
 check the ethics of a company 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:16.230
 on the checkpoint site this is the last video I tell you 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.020
 showed thermal kuat la rosh pose 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.240
 which as a result turned out to be unethical 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.300
 I don't know how I missed this piteous 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.910
 the company larusz pause belongs to l'oreal ya 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.500
 la real is never an ethical company 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.920
 even the most cruel 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.960
 in the cosmetic market so if you 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.940
 you know some ethical firms that 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.040
 releases thermal water then write 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.680
 me please about this as under the video 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.170
 I will leave links to an article about harmful 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.239
 components of cosmetics and also a link to 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.370
 the site where you can copy the composition 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.010
 cosmetic product and he would you and 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:53.579
 kind of dangerous components it is very convenient 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.800
 at first for the skin of the eyes of the same 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.989
 line I find it easy and nourishing cream 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.640
 twice a week I put on 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.710
 oil eyes and 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.500
 sweat soak 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.930
 it does not drip down my face now I 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.900
 Tamanu's oil was previously an organ and 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:12.000
 rosehip oil still I really 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.310
 like how moisturizes avocado oil for 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.330
 sensitive already she is very 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:20.640
 well suited and of course for the eyes 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.470
 I have a special sun protection to use 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.320
 its not very convenient and you have to stoke 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:28.560
 this cream in fingers began to sweat 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.450
 neatness on the skin around the eyes and also 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.430
 then the protector leaves white marks 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.950
 certainly a big minus but nothing yet 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.730
 better I havenâ€™t found it for myself of course 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.130
 protects the skin on the top five therefore 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:43.180
 even here these white tracks I somehow 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:45.590
 I close my eyes to them because 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:49.160
 protects the skin around the eyes food for me 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:51.010
 law after the sun after the beach i 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:54.140
 sure on some kind of butter 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:57.980
 usually this oil is known to all of you 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:00.020
 yellow speak which arbo website has either 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:01.970
 something else and also of course not 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:07.280
 forget to put oil on the decollete area 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:09.350
 and neck well, and let's go probably on the air 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.270
 I have a lot of oil but often me 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:13.940
 ask what to buy and for beginners I 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:16.550
 always answer tea tree and lavender and 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.830
 that of citrus and tea tree 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:21.920
 lavender is one of the few oils 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:24.920
 which can be applied to the skin without 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:27.760
 I like some base oil 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:30.380
 tea tree it is antibacterial and 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.360
 regenerating since ether to tea 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.910
 wood antiseptic then you can 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:37.040
 handle slightly prolonged wounds and 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:39.230
 scratching it will speed up their healing and 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.330
 also tea tree dries 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.670
 hated by sins and hastens it 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:46.190
 regrets for me is just a mast hev 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:49.010
 number one i take for some reason only here 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:51.760
 this oil is from jason i don't know why so 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:55.850
 i started buying it on and herbie and 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:58.370
 I buy it only and I love lavender 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:01.100
 its properties are similar to tea tree 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:03.230
 also dries inflammation accelerates 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:05.420
 skin regeneration process in a mask 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.880
 I add with pleasure and epithet 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:10.450
 peels 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:13.460
 sometimes on ours also on inflammation 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:16.220
 Well, about the citrus esters in my 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:18.890
 there is always at least one of this family 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.420
 at the moment this bergamot is very 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:23.120
 love for oily skin 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:26.810
 it is also necessary for hair suitable 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:29.570
 but if you have oily skin or mixed 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:32.060
 as I have for the regulation of the secret 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:34.160
 the sebaceous glands in the mask in the cream you can 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:36.800
 add and calmly drop by drop and 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.810
 I always have at least one citrus 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:41.000
 oily skin 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:43.130
 clay masks they work just 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.170
 fine they handle that is the secret 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:47.120
 sebaceous glands and and relieves inflammation 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:48.070
 dries a little so you need to be 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.110
 neat 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:53.660
 in the sun after using citrus 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:56.510
 of course we do not go out by any means 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:59.210
 because you can get burn choose 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:01.640
 citrus oils based on your 

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:04.190
 taste because they are very similar and 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:05.930
 range of actions and I think that here 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:10.460
 the main thing is to pick up what you exactly 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:13.100
 you like the smell but the last one 

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:15.200
 very important to me after washing I 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:16.610
 always use only disposable 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.970
 paper napkins 

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:22.340
 to remove excess water from the face as 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:24.530
 you know what morning bacteria are 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:26.870
 going from our face successfully in 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:29.240
 during the day multiplies in the evening 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:31.580
 safely populated back with new ones 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:33.139
 relatives and we do not need it from here 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:35.629
 and acne 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:37.879
 and no one wants any inflammation 

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:39.800
 have it on your face so i tell you 

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:42.499
 I recommend try this method if 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:45.229
 you still don't do that 

00:04:42.499 --> 00:04:47.240
 care I do not believe in the miracle of cream and magic 

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:49.699
 serum i believe only in what 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:51.949
 youth skin quality can be maintained 

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:54.229
 long enough due to moderate 

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:56.779
 clean and balanced 

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:58.610
 nutrition and age changes but they 

00:04:56.779 --> 00:05:00.529
 will still make themselves known early or 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:02.719
 late and you can only fight them 

00:05:00.529 --> 00:05:04.759
 the office of a qualified cosmetologist 

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:06.500
 that's all I hope you do 

00:05:04.759 --> 00:05:08.270
 liked this video if yes then not 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:10.449
 Forget me to tell everyone about it bye. 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:10.449
 until
