00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
kill just because my swarm was a

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.670 
kill just because my swarm was a
freaking<00:00:45.329> monster<00:00:45.660> I<00:00:46.140> do<00:00:46.230> know<00:00:46.410> a<00:00:46.440> lot<00:00:46.649> of

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
freaking monster I do know a lot of

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.049 
freaking monster I do know a lot of
people<00:00:46.739> think<00:00:47.010> that<00:00:47.129> that<00:00:47.340> kill<00:00:47.700> streak<00:00:47.910> is

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
people think that that kill streak is

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.880 
people think that that kill streak is
overpowered<00:00:48.780> and<00:00:48.899> I<00:00:48.989> do<00:00:49.050> think<00:00:49.530> so<00:00:49.710> as<00:00:49.860> well

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
overpowered and I do think so as well

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.010 
overpowered and I do think so as well
but<00:00:50.190> I<00:00:50.250> do<00:00:50.309> think<00:00:50.910> that<00:00:51.059> having<00:00:51.329> overpowered

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
but I do think that having overpowered

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.779 
but I do think that having overpowered
killstreaks<00:00:52.530> make<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.160> game<00:00:53.399> a<00:00:53.430> little<00:00:53.670> bit

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
killstreaks make the game a little bit

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.000 
killstreaks make the game a little bit
more<00:00:53.940> fun<00:00:54.180> sometimes<00:00:54.600> I<00:00:54.870> look<00:00:55.050> at<00:00:55.140> mw2<00:00:55.590> like

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
that game has probably the most

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.090 
that game has probably the most

I was kind of debating whether or not i
want<00:01:53.909> this<00:01:54.000> kill<00:01:54.240> streak<00:01:54.420> to<00:01:54.509> come<00:01:54.659> back<00:01:54.899> but<00:01:55.259> I

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
want this kill streak to come back but I

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.950 
want this kill streak to come back but I
kind<00:01:55.590> of<00:01:55.649> want<00:01:55.829> the<00:01:55.920> dogs<00:01:56.189> to<00:01:56.490> come<00:01:56.729> back<00:01:56.960> black

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
kind of want the dogs to come back black

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.890

dogs<00:01:58.170> game<00:01:58.380> without<00:01:58.560> dogs<00:01:58.890> I<00:01:59.280> don't<00:01:59.909> even

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:00.900 
dogs game without dogs I don't even

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:02.480 
dogs game without dogs I don't even
yeah<00:02:01.020> I<00:02:01.440> don't<00:02:01.500> think<00:02:01.830> would<00:02:01.920> be<00:02:02.070> considered<00:02:02.460> a

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
yeah I don't think would be considered a

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:03.770 
yeah I don't think would be considered a
black<00:02:02.700> ops<00:02:02.940> game<00:02:03.030> anymore<00:02:03.360> what<00:02:03.660> I<00:02:03.690> think

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
black ops game anymore what I think

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.300 
black ops game anymore what I think
they'll<00:02:04.140> do<00:02:04.350> is<00:02:04.470> that<00:02:04.590> they'll<00:02:04.740> bring<00:02:05.010> back

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
they'll do is that they'll bring back

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.250 
they'll do is that they'll bring back
dogs<00:02:05.670> but<00:02:05.940> they're<00:02:06.030> gonna<00:02:06.150> be<00:02:06.300> like<00:02:06.450> robotic

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:07.260 
dogs but they're gonna be like robotic

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.139 
dogs but they're gonna be like robotic
enhanced<00:02:07.950> dogs<00:02:08.220> or<00:02:08.520> something<00:02:08.550> like<00:02:09.030> the

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
enhanced dogs or something like the

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.720 
enhanced dogs or something like the
whole<00:02:09.360> idea<00:02:09.690> behind<00:02:10.170> black<00:02:10.560> ops<00:02:10.830> 3<00:02:11.220> is<00:02:11.490> that

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
whole idea behind black ops 3 is that

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.940 
whole idea behind black ops 3 is that
you<00:02:11.910> know<00:02:12.060> you're<00:02:12.630> using<00:02:13.020> robotics<00:02:13.800> to
