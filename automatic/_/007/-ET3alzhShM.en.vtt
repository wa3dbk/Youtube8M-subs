00:00:08.759 --> 00:00:12.639
 hello everyone I'm dan and I'm here 

00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:14.379
 new on island minecraft news for 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:17.780
 bring the latest news on 

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:20.160
 minecraft so let's start 

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:21.810
 a twitter user asked to 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.520
 nathan adam if one day they could 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.980
 feed the chickens with seeds in 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:28.110
 place of wheat with nathan adams 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.090
 he replied that in the next snapshot that 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:31.890
 it will be possible so that we can finally 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.200
 to use those thousands of seeds that 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.820
 we have saved 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.290
 more things nathan adam has been commented 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.120
 on your twitter that there will not be a 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.800
 I pose for the saddle since 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.600
 he likes the idea that the content of 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.430
 the chests of the unions are of 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:49.650
 utility has also said that 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:51.690
 we will find more objects in last unions 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:53.940
 something else what I 'm going to tell you 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.920
 now it happens in the last snapshots 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.750
 and that is that the zombies are now capable 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.690
 of taking things from the ground and even 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.610
 to equip themselves is to say that if we 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.410
 kill a group of zombies most likely 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.900
 is that when we return things no longer 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:08.430
 be there and have the zombies the 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.290
 if you were to kill those 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.570
 zombies did not let go of the things that you 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.950
 they had stolen good because it does not do anything 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.930
 has commented that he will do that when 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.420
 kill those zombies give us back the 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.310
 100% of the things that carry over 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.460
 well nothing has been all for the 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.869
 moment I will be attentive to new developments 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.580
 As you already know this week there has not been 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:29.590
 snapshot since they are traveling in a 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.850
 video game convention or something like that 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.430
 what we will have to wait for the 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.649
 next week more things some me 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.119
 you asked me to do series at the moment 

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:39.070
 It is impossible for me not to buy 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:41.110
 a new microphone since it is heard very 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.280
 wrong when I record with the force apps like this 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.350
 that for the moment I will continue with the 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.899
 tonic mods tutorials and more 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.909
 I'm also watching the 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:50.950
 possibility to offer mod packs 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:52.569
 Easy to install but I have to see 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.210
 if it's viable since I have to ask 

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:58.270
 permission to the modders and others so I already 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:00.929
 then you will see nothing but a greeting and even 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.929
 the next video
