00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
cameras to feature our translucent

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.580 
cameras to feature our translucent
mirror<00:00:19.410> so<00:00:20.220> with<00:00:20.369> the<00:00:20.460> translucent<00:00:21.090> mirror

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:21.590 
mirror so with the translucent mirror

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:23.870 
mirror so with the translucent mirror
lot<00:00:22.590> of<00:00:22.680> the<00:00:22.740> light<00:00:22.920> goes<00:00:23.160> through<00:00:23.189> the<00:00:23.640> mirror

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
lot of the light goes through the mirror

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.849 
lot of the light goes through the mirror
and<00:00:24.210> some<00:00:24.600> of<00:00:24.689> it<00:00:24.840> reflects<00:00:25.170> up<00:00:25.439> into<00:00:25.769> the

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
and some of it reflects up into the

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.330 
and some of it reflects up into the
focus<00:00:26.400> system<00:00:27.050> so<00:00:28.050> what<00:00:28.650> that<00:00:28.680> allows<00:00:28.949> us<00:00:29.220> to

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
focus system so what that allows us to

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.380 
focus system so what that allows us to
do<00:00:29.550> is<00:00:29.820> have<00:00:30.449> 10<00:00:30.960> frames<00:00:31.320> per<00:00:31.590> second

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:32.390 
do is have 10 frames per second

works while you're shooting because the

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.090 
works while you're shooting because the

we got here is not alpha 55 which is a

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.070 
we got here is not alpha 55 which is a
16<00:01:10.170> megapixel<00:01:10.350> camera<00:01:11.189> we<00:01:11.820> have<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.030> Alpha<00:01:12.390> 33

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080

what we also have because of translucent
mirror<00:01:35.300> is<00:01:35.530> electronic<00:01:36.530> viewfinder<00:01:37.130> which<00:01:37.160> we

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.430 
mirror is electronic viewfinder which we

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.150 
mirror is electronic viewfinder which we
call<00:01:37.610> your<00:01:37.730> own<00:01:37.940> finder<00:01:38.420> well<00:01:39.200> that<00:01:39.410> what<00:01:40.010> you

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
would see on the LCD panel here you can

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.050 
would see on the LCD panel here you can
also<00:01:48.170> see<00:01:48.470> in<00:01:48.590> the<00:01:48.710> electronic<00:01:49.490> viewfinder

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
also see in the electronic viewfinder

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.390 
also see in the electronic viewfinder
here<00:01:50.420> and<00:01:51.380> we<00:01:51.740> can<00:01:51.890> have<00:01:52.010> some<00:01:52.250> really

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:52.400 
here and we can have some really

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.960 
here and we can have some really
exciting<00:01:52.550> stuff<00:01:52.940> like<00:01:53.360> a<00:01:54.080> level<00:01:54.800> so<00:01:55.550> you<00:01:55.640> can

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:55.970 
exciting stuff like a level so you can

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:57.990 
exciting stuff like a level so you can
see<00:01:56.180> here<00:01:56.480> whether<00:01:56.750> or<00:01:56.900> not<00:01:56.990> your<00:01:57.260> level

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
see here whether or not your level

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.220 
see here whether or not your level
whether<00:01:59.000> you're<00:01:59.150> tilting<00:01:59.480> up<00:01:59.630> or<00:01:59.900> tilt<00:02:00.110> them

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:00.230 
whether you're tilting up or tilt them

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:07.899 
whether you're tilting up or tilt them
down

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:07.909 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:10.990 

we<00:02:08.450> also<00:02:08.629> have<00:02:08.780> things<00:02:09.080> like<00:02:09.819> three<00:02:10.819> different

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
we also have things like three different

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.940 
we also have things like three different
subtypes<00:02:11.510> of<00:02:11.690> grids<00:02:11.959> on<00:02:12.110> here<00:02:12.319> so<00:02:12.500> it's<00:02:12.650> a<00:02:12.709> rule

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
subtypes of grids on here so it's a rule

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.400 
subtypes of grids on here so it's a rule
of<00:02:12.980> thirds<00:02:13.340> spread<00:02:13.849> there's<00:02:14.629> a<00:02:14.780> square<00:02:15.379> grid

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
of thirds spread there's a square grid

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.500 
of thirds spread there's a square grid
there's<00:02:15.890> diagonal<00:02:16.489> lines<00:02:16.730> as<00:02:16.940> well<00:02:17.120> all

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
there's diagonal lines as well all

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.420 
there's diagonal lines as well all
things<00:02:17.810> that<00:02:17.900> can<00:02:18.140> help<00:02:18.319> you<00:02:18.530> compose<00:02:19.250> your

things that can help you compose your
picture<00:02:19.819> more<00:02:20.239> easily<00:02:21.010> we<00:02:22.010> have<00:02:22.280> our<00:02:22.750> auto

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
picture more easily we have our auto

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.479
