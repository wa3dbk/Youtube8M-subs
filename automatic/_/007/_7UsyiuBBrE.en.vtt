00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.359 
pretty pointless you can't do anything
so<00:01:33.990> in<00:01:34.110> a<00:01:34.170> minute<00:01:34.259> I<00:01:34.409> will<00:01:34.530> get<00:01:34.860> down<00:01:35.070> and

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
so in a minute I will get down and

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.160 
so in a minute I will get down and
actually<00:01:35.490> go<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.479> other<00:01:36.509> side<00:01:36.840> and<00:01:36.960> as<00:01:37.079> you

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
actually go the other side and as you

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.149 
actually go the other side and as you
see<00:01:37.350> from<00:01:37.470> this<00:01:37.650> side<00:01:37.829> you<00:01:37.890> can<00:01:38.070> actually

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
see from this side you can actually

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.100 
see from this side you can actually
revive<00:01:38.520> your<00:01:38.759> teammates<00:01:39.329> just<00:01:39.600> for<00:01:40.079> that
