 free out of working hours today i 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.099

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.780
 have participated in this initiative is 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.670
 true to make prevention starting from 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.040
 smaller your advice, of course 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.839
 They are especially useful adults is 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.180
 always a pleasure for us to do 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:21.750
 education when it comes to 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:25.010
 involve kids boys we do it 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.560
 always very willingly a part 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:29.869
 staff is not in service today is 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:32.450
 of free turn came here spontaneously 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:34.190
 will however there is also the departure of 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:37.310
 tolentino the real departure that 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:39.230
 today he is on duty possibly ago 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:42.170
 the intervention performs any type 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:44.840
 intervention starting from here I repeat for 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:47.900
 we are a pleasure when it comes to 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:50.900
 involve the new generations who 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:54.380
 will go into a future 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:56.300
 to identify oneself even in work 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:57.110
 as a fire brigade is always a 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:01.580
 pleasure for us 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:03.440
 in addition we also find the 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:07.190
 pleasure that these children have when 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:10.640
 they see us is very rewarding for us 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:14.570
 today a demonstration with an accident 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:17.360
 so a car in different problems that is 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:19.580
 the operation was practically open 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.320
 of 118 precisely to show that in 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.430
 quick times can save a life 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.730
 human 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.000
 certainly 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:28.830
 as for the times we have 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.890
 done everything normally 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.600
 we do in a car accident but in 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.820
 much slower we did it 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.060
 specifically for their own to show 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.950
 the various maneuvers 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:46.440
 dada starting from the cutting of the machine 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:48.850
 when opening the door and cutting 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.690
 until you reach total liberation 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.590
 of the 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:56.590
 of the wounded with the 118 that meanwhile lends 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.600
 the first care of the case is not rare 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.040
 situation does not even happen a few 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.110
 situation in which the car takes 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.700
 also fire therefore we did 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:06.400
 specially that must be shown 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.229
 also that we are ready for those for 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.740
 however, we have done so in 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.740
 slow manner
