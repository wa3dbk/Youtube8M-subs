00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.210 
then so now it'll be minecraft flaunt
it's<00:02:16.380> kind<00:02:16.500> of<00:02:16.620> screwed<00:02:16.860> up<00:02:16.980> because<00:02:17.040> the

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
it's kind of screwed up because the

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:22.520 
it's kind of screwed up because the
offsets<00:02:17.700> way<00:02:18.090> too<00:02:18.150> high<00:02:20.450> okay<00:02:21.450> there<00:02:21.600> we<00:02:21.630> go<00:02:21.690> it

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
offsets way too high okay there we go it

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.310 
offsets way too high okay there we go it
looks<00:02:22.680> way<00:02:22.830> better<00:02:23.209> then<00:02:24.209> we<00:02:24.330> can<00:02:24.480> go<00:02:24.600> to<00:02:24.660> the

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
looks way better then we can go to the

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.440 
looks way better then we can go to the
world<00:02:25.650> and<00:02:26.010> you<00:02:26.340> can<00:02:26.520> change<00:02:26.790> the<00:02:27.180> color<00:02:27.360> of

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
world and you can change the color of

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.820 
world and you can change the color of
the<00:02:27.540> world<00:02:27.720> let's<00:02:28.680> just<00:02:28.830> say<00:02:28.950> I<00:02:29.010> want<00:02:29.280> it<00:02:29.370> to<00:02:29.430> be

pull up all these particle systems it'll

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.360 
pull up all these particle systems it'll
automatically<00:03:14.790> add<00:03:15.650> we're<00:03:16.650> like<00:03:17.010> how<00:03:17.160> much
