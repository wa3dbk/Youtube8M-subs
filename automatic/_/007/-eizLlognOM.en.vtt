kind of railroad the signals to follow

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:57.270 
kind of railroad the signals to follow
step<00:06:55.990> up<00:06:56.199> when<00:06:56.440> one<00:06:56.620> I<00:06:56.650> don't<00:06:56.860> think<00:06:57.009> it's<00:06:57.130> like

00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:57.280 
step up when one I don't think it's like

00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:59.340 
step up when one I don't think it's like
prototypical<00:06:58.000> the<00:06:58.389> signal<00:06:58.750> or<00:06:58.840> injury<00:06:59.169> of<00:06:59.229> it

00:06:59.340 --> 00:06:59.350 
prototypical the signal or injury of it

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:01.560 
prototypical the signal or injury of it
it's<00:06:59.620> pretty<00:06:59.830> neat<00:07:00.100> hair<00:07:01.090> last<00:07:01.270> but<00:07:01.449> not<00:07:01.509> least
