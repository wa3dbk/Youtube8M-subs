00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:21.519 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:30.690 

this<00:03:22.519> is<00:03:22.700> Mike<00:03:23.480> to<00:03:28.420> little<00:03:29.420> bit<00:03:29.540> more<00:03:29.810> power

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
this is Mike to little bit more power

00:03:30.700 --> 00:04:20.770 
this is Mike to little bit more power
better<00:03:37.810> put<00:03:38.810> the<00:03:38.930> treble<00:03:39.349> on<00:03:39.409> three<00:03:39.829> o<00:03:39.859> clock

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:20.780 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:24.469 

well<00:04:21.780> let<00:04:22.770> a<00:04:22.800> power<00:04:23.070> I<00:04:23.250> think<00:04:23.310> it's<00:04:23.760> these

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:24.479 
well let a power I think it's these

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:27.950 
well let a power I think it's these
models<00:04:25.699> may<00:04:26.699> be<00:04:26.729> better<00:04:27.060> for<00:04:27.330> guitar<00:04:27.690> because

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 
models may be better for guitar because

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.110 
models may be better for guitar because
they<00:04:28.110> have<00:04:28.229> so<00:04:28.440> much<00:04:28.590> output<00:04:29.160> I<00:04:29.310> can<00:04:29.580> go<00:04:29.820> only

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 
they have so much output I can go only

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:48.600 
they have so much output I can go only
to<00:04:30.270> two<00:04:30.660> and<00:04:30.840> a<00:04:30.900> half<00:04:31.110> year<00:04:31.530> and

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:48.610 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:51.610 

okay
