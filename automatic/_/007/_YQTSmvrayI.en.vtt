section<00:02:15.709> right<00:02:15.859> here<00:02:15.890> is<00:02:16.430> similar<00:02:16.790> to<00:02:16.879> what<00:02:16.999> it

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
section right here is similar to what it

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:18.940 
section right here is similar to what it
would<00:02:17.150> be<00:02:17.299> on<00:02:17.510> a<00:02:17.540> one-inch<00:02:18.019> steer<00:02:18.530> tube<00:02:18.709> and

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
would be on a one-inch steer tube and

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:20.379 
would be on a one-inch steer tube and
then<00:02:19.069> swells<00:02:19.400> out<00:02:19.549> to<00:02:19.700> accommodate<00:02:20.180> one<00:02:20.299> on

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489 
one eight bearings what that allows you

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:24.970 
one eight bearings what that allows you
to<00:02:22.549> do<00:02:22.849> is<00:02:23.180> to<00:02:23.540> run<00:02:23.629> a<00:02:23.689> much<00:02:23.989> lighter<00:02:24.349> head<00:02:24.739> tube

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
to do is to run a much lighter head tube

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.339 
to do is to run a much lighter head tube
this<00:02:25.340> piece<00:02:25.579> is<00:02:25.790> forged<00:02:26.329> and<00:02:26.540> then<00:02:26.959> machine

00:02:27.339 --> 00:02:27.349 
this piece is forged and then machine

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:29.410 
this piece is forged and then machine
and<00:02:27.590> what<00:02:28.159> that<00:02:28.370> does<00:02:28.549> is<00:02:28.790> that<00:02:28.819> both<00:02:29.090> aligns

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
and what that does is that both aligns

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:30.699 
and what that does is that both aligns
the<00:02:29.599> grain<00:02:29.780> structure<00:02:30.079> makes<00:02:30.349> a<00:02:30.409> really

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:30.709 
the grain structure makes a really

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:32.349 
the grain structure makes a really
strong<00:02:30.980> head<00:02:31.219> tube<00:02:31.430> and<00:02:31.639> also<00:02:31.760> really<00:02:32.030> light

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:32.359 
strong head tube and also really light

00:02:32.359 --> 00:02:34.929 
strong head tube and also really light
head<00:02:32.989> tube<00:02:33.260> so<00:02:33.920> you<00:02:33.980> end<00:02:34.340> up<00:02:34.430> saving<00:02:34.700> about

00:02:34.929 --> 00:02:34.939 
head tube so you end up saving about

00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:37.030 
head tube so you end up saving about
eighty<00:02:35.269> grams<00:02:35.599> over<00:02:36.079> a<00:02:36.109> standard<00:02:36.379> one<00:02:36.709> and<00:02:36.739> 1/8

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
eighty grams over a standard one and 1/8

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.280 
eighty grams over a standard one and 1/8
head<00:02:37.280> tube<00:02:37.519> as<00:02:38.269> any<00:02:38.480> head<00:02:38.659> tube<00:02:38.840> gets<00:02:38.959> bigger

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
head tube as any head tube gets bigger

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.800 
head tube as any head tube gets bigger
in<00:02:40.099> steel<00:02:40.400> it<00:02:40.549> has<00:02:40.579> to<00:02:40.790> get<00:02:40.879> heavier<00:02:41.239> to<00:02:41.419> resist

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
in steel it has to get heavier to resist

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.959 
in steel it has to get heavier to resist
buckling<00:02:42.349> and<00:02:42.620> what<00:02:43.249> we<00:02:43.340> call<00:02:43.459> the<00:02:43.549> coke<00:02:43.730> can't

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:43.969 
buckling and what we call the coke can't

00:02:43.969 --> 00:02:46.089 
buckling and what we call the coke can't
effect<00:02:44.299> so<00:02:44.900> all<00:02:45.139> this<00:02:45.319> combats<00:02:45.709> that<00:02:45.950> by

00:02:46.089 --> 00:02:46.099 
effect so all this combats that by

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:47.559 
effect so all this combats that by
making<00:02:46.280> a<00:02:46.489> much<00:02:46.609> smaller<00:02:46.909> head<00:02:47.150> tube<00:02:47.359> that

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:47.569 
making a much smaller head tube that

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:49.479 
making a much smaller head tube that
still<00:02:47.840> works<00:02:48.079> with<00:02:48.290> modern<00:02:48.650> bearings<00:02:49.010> and<00:02:49.219> one
