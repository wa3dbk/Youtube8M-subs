starting at 20 each the different decks

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:13.969 
starting at 20 each the different decks
definitely<00:01:13.229> played<00:01:13.470> differently<00:01:13.860> and

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
definitely played differently and

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.679 
definitely played differently and
there's<00:01:14.159> a<00:01:14.220> lot<00:01:14.340> more<00:01:14.369> to<00:01:14.790> color<00:01:15.060> combinations

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689

this<00:01:15.990> time<00:01:16.229> around<00:01:16.640> and<00:01:17.640> I<00:01:17.970> think<00:01:18.210> with<00:01:18.450> some

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
this time around and I think with some

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:19.670 
this time around and I think with some
of<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:18.750> other<00:01:18.810> modes<00:01:19.170> you'll<00:01:19.350> find<00:01:19.560> yourself

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
of the other modes you'll find yourself

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.280 
of the other modes you'll find yourself
not<00:01:20.369> bug<00:01:20.640> so<00:01:20.850> bye-bye<00:01:21.060> be<00:01:21.600> constructed<00:01:22.110> play

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
and maybe want to go back there

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.850 
and maybe want to go back there
sometimes<00:01:23.759> as<00:01:23.939> a<00:01:23.970> new<00:01:24.180> change<00:01:24.479> of<00:01:24.600> pace<00:01:24.860> seen

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
you to get hints from the computer about

what you should do now the computer
plays<00:01:32.759> a<00:01:32.850> very<00:01:33.000> specific<00:01:33.329> way<00:01:33.600> I<00:01:33.780> think<00:01:34.140> it's

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
plays a very specific way I think it's

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.230

a new bunch of boosters and this is

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.810 
a new bunch of boosters and this is
relatively<00:05:59.260> inexpensive<00:06:00.040> if<00:06:00.250> you<00:06:00.400> were<00:06:00.520> to<00:06:00.669> go

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:00.820 
relatively inexpensive if you were to go

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:02.370 
relatively inexpensive if you were to go
to<00:06:00.880> a<00:06:01.060> shop<00:06:01.480> and<00:06:01.660> play<00:06:01.780> magic<00:06:02.200> the<00:06:02.290> gathering

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:05.290 
but in terms of iOS apps they can add up

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:07.050 
but in terms of iOS apps they can add up
pretty<00:06:05.320> quickly<00:06:05.770> so<00:06:05.919> just<00:06:06.400> be<00:06:06.550> mindful<00:06:06.850> of

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:07.060 
pretty quickly so just be mindful of

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:09.050 
pretty quickly so just be mindful of
that<00:06:07.180> and<00:06:07.330> be<00:06:07.780> careful<00:06:07.990> of<00:06:08.230> it<00:06:08.380> as<00:06:08.500> well

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:09.060 
that and be careful of it as well

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:11.820 
that and be careful of it as well
overall<00:06:10.060> I've<00:06:10.270> really<00:06:10.510> enjoyed<00:06:10.540> magic<00:06:11.140> 2014<00:06:11.800> I

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:13.560 
overall I've really enjoyed magic 2014 I
think<00:06:12.160> they've<00:06:12.280> taken<00:06:12.520> what<00:06:12.880> worked<00:06:13.120> well<00:06:13.300> and

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:13.570 
think they've taken what worked well and

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:15.750 
think they've taken what worked well and
iPad<00:06:13.900> at<00:06:14.050> Magic<00:06:14.350> 2013<00:06:14.950> and<00:06:15.160> really<00:06:15.370> increased

iPad at Magic 2013 and really increased

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:17.760 
iPad at Magic 2013 and really increased
it<00:06:15.940> the<00:06:16.090> layouts<00:06:16.330> a<00:06:16.480> lot<00:06:16.630> better<00:06:16.870> here<00:06:17.290> it

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:17.770 
it the layouts a lot better here it

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:20.070 
it the layouts a lot better here it
feels<00:06:17.980> a<00:06:18.130> lot<00:06:18.250> fresher<00:06:18.550> there's<00:06:19.390> new<00:06:19.570> modes<00:06:19.870> to

feels a lot fresher there's new modes to

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:21.750 
feels a lot fresher there's new modes to
play<00:06:20.290> I<00:06:20.320> think<00:06:20.500> the<00:06:20.830> sealed<00:06:21.070> mode<00:06:21.250> was<00:06:21.430> a<00:06:21.460> great

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:21.760 
play I think the sealed mode was a great

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:23.640 
play I think the sealed mode was a great
addition<00:06:22.030> and<00:06:22.360> something<00:06:22.720> that<00:06:22.750> is<00:06:23.320> certainly

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:23.650 
addition and something that is certainly

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:25.800 
addition and something that is certainly
welcomed<00:06:24.100> by<00:06:24.250> many<00:06:24.400> fans<00:06:24.760> it<00:06:25.540> definitely

welcomed by many fans it definitely

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:27.659 
welcomed by many fans it definitely
might<00:06:26.080> not<00:06:26.200> fit<00:06:26.440> every<00:06:26.740> need<00:06:26.950> you<00:06:26.980> wish<00:06:27.430> you

can't<00:06:27.850> just<00:06:28.030> open<00:06:28.210> the<00:06:28.450> Boosters<00:06:28.780> continually

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:29.410 
can't just open the Boosters continually

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:31.380 
can't just open the Boosters continually
but<00:06:29.919> it<00:06:30.130> does<00:06:30.280> give<00:06:30.490> you<00:06:30.580> that<00:06:30.730> control<00:06:31.180> that

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:32.969 
but it does give you that control that
deck<00:06:31.630> building<00:06:31.930> that<00:06:32.080> you've<00:06:32.200> wanted<00:06:32.470> in<00:06:32.680> this

deck building that you've wanted in this

00:06:32.979 --> 00:06:35.060 
deck building that you've wanted in this
genre<00:06:33.729> for<00:06:34.090> a<00:06:34.120> long<00:06:34.330> time

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:35.070 
genre for a long time

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:36.950 
genre for a long time
the<00:06:35.670> game<00:06:35.820> is<00:06:35.970> very<00:06:36.150> high<00:06:36.300> quality<00:06:36.570> however

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:36.960 
the game is very high quality however

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:38.900 
the game is very high quality however
there<00:06:37.230> are<00:06:37.320> a<00:06:37.350> few<00:06:37.590> bugs<00:06:37.830> I've<00:06:38.370> had<00:06:38.520> booster

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:38.910 
there are a few bugs I've had booster

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:41.210 
there are a few bugs I've had booster
packs<00:06:39.120> disappear<00:06:39.780> and<00:06:40.020> sealed<00:06:40.500> play<00:06:40.740> and<00:06:41.040> I've

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:41.220 
packs disappear and sealed play and I've

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:44.030 
packs disappear and sealed play and I've
also<00:06:41.370> had<00:06:42.120> a<00:06:42.180> situations<00:06:42.780> where<00:06:42.870> the<00:06:43.440> personas

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:44.040 
also had a situations where the personas

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:45.230 
also had a situations where the personas
does<00:06:44.220> not<00:06:44.370> seem<00:06:44.550> to<00:06:44.580> be<00:06:44.730> working<00:06:44.880> correctly

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:45.240 
does not seem to be working correctly

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:48.710 
does not seem to be working correctly
all<00:06:45.960> these<00:06:46.320> can<00:06:46.910> provide<00:06:47.910> some<00:06:48.120> minor<00:06:48.360> major

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:48.720 
all these can provide some minor major

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:50.450 
all these can provide some minor major
annoyances<00:06:49.440> and<00:06:49.770> so<00:06:49.920> the<00:06:50.070> game<00:06:50.190> definitely

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:50.460 
annoyances and so the game definitely

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:53.390 
annoyances and so the game definitely
needs<00:06:50.760> some<00:06:51.030> new<00:06:51.870> polish<00:06:52.320> however<00:06:53.040> overall

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:53.400 
needs some new polish however overall

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:55.520 
needs some new polish however overall
it's<00:06:53.820> a<00:06:53.970> great<00:06:54.480> experience<00:06:54.720> and<00:06:55.230> I<00:06:55.320> don't

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:55.530 
it's a great experience and I don't

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:57.260 
it's a great experience and I don't
think<00:06:55.800> a<00:06:55.980> few<00:06:56.400> bugs<00:06:56.640> should<00:06:56.790> deter<00:06:57.060> you<00:06:57.240> from

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:57.270 
think a few bugs should deter you from

00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:00.320 
think a few bugs should deter you from
enjoying<00:06:57.690> it<00:06:58.170> as<00:06:58.380> it<00:06:58.560> is<00:06:58.730> if<00:06:59.730> you<00:06:59.910> are<00:06:59.940> a<00:07:00.060> magic

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:00.330 
enjoying it as it is if you are a magic

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:01.520 
enjoying it as it is if you are a magic
player<00:07:00.510> I<00:07:00.540> definitely<00:07:00.900> recommend<00:07:01.050> picking

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:01.530 
player I definitely recommend picking

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:02.810

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:09.720 
great way to revisit it and the addition

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:10.910 
great way to revisit it and the addition
of<00:07:09.780> deck<00:07:09.990> building<00:07:10.320> will<00:07:10.500> give<00:07:10.650> you<00:07:10.740> that
