00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
took the clock test again and as you can

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.120 
took the clock test again and as you can
see<00:01:44.119> demonstrated<00:01:45.119> stunning<00:01:46.020> improvement<00:01:46.860> I

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
see demonstrated stunning improvement I

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.340 
see demonstrated stunning improvement I
thought<00:01:47.759> at<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:47.970> time<00:01:48.090> was<00:01:48.570> it<00:01:49.049> just<00:01:49.229> good

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
thought at the time was it just good

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.760 
thought at the time was it just good
luck<00:01:49.530> was<00:01:50.009> that<00:01:50.130> a<00:01:50.159> lot<00:01:50.280> of<00:01:50.340> Prayer<00:01:50.700> was<00:01:51.659> it<00:01:51.930> the

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
luck was that a lot of Prayer was it the

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.240 
luck was that a lot of Prayer was it the
coconut<00:01:53.189> oil<00:01:53.369> and<00:01:54.329> I<00:01:54.570> thought<00:01:54.750> well<00:01:55.250> we're

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
coconut oil and I thought well we're

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.249 
coconut oil and I thought well we're
gonna<00:01:56.369> keep<00:01:56.610> the<00:01:56.729> coconut<00:01:57.119> oil<00:01:57.329> going<00:01:57.540> then

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
gonna keep the coconut oil going then

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.130 
gonna keep the coconut oil going then
three<00:01:58.829> weeks<00:01:59.130> later<00:01:59.610> he<00:01:59.790> took<00:02:00.299> the<00:02:00.479> clock<00:02:00.750> test

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
three weeks later he took the clock test

three weeks later he took the clock test
a<00:02:01.350> third<00:02:01.680> time<00:02:02.070> and<00:02:02.600> continued<00:02:03.600> to<00:02:03.840> get<00:02:03.990> better

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
considerably higher levels and and you

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:11.780 
considerably higher levels and and you
can<00:03:10.620> get<00:03:10.739> whatever<00:03:10.950> levels<00:03:11.430> you<00:03:11.550> want

depending on how much you drink the

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.729 
depending on how much you drink the
problem<00:03:14.519> is<00:03:14.880> they<00:03:15.180> need<00:03:15.420> millions<00:03:16.080> of<00:03:16.290> dollars

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
problem is they need millions of dollars

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:20.509 
problem is they need millions of dollars
to<00:03:17.010> mass-produce<00:03:17.340> it<00:03:18.150> very<00:03:19.079> expensive<00:03:19.380> and<00:03:19.829> so

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
to mass-produce it very expensive and so

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:22.640 
to mass-produce it very expensive and so
we<00:03:20.760> can't<00:03:21.000> make<00:03:21.209> very<00:03:21.510> much<00:03:21.720> of<00:03:21.900> it<00:03:21.989> ourselves

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
we can't make very much of it ourselves

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.220 
we can't make very much of it ourselves
and<00:03:22.799> what<00:03:23.579> we<00:03:23.700> would<00:03:23.850> like<00:03:24.060> its<00:03:24.450> funding<00:03:24.959> so

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
and what we would like its funding so

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.130 
and what we would like its funding so
that<00:03:25.260> we<00:03:25.410> could<00:03:25.650> actually<00:03:25.950> scale<00:03:26.519> up<00:03:26.820> and<00:03:27.180> and

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
that we could actually scale up and and

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:29.990 
that we could actually scale up and and
make<00:03:28.560> it<00:03:28.590> but<00:03:28.920> of<00:03:29.040> course<00:03:29.070> there's<00:03:29.519> no<00:03:29.730> real

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
make it but of course there's no real

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.600 
make it but of course there's no real
profit<00:03:30.480> in<00:03:30.829> manufacturing<00:03:31.829> stuff<00:03:32.220> like<00:03:32.400> that

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610 
profit in manufacturing stuff like that

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:36.530 
profit in manufacturing stuff like that
so<00:03:33.239> until<00:03:33.930> a<00:03:34.200> high<00:03:34.440> potency<00:03:34.769> ketone<00:03:35.730> ester<00:03:36.329> is

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
so until a high potency ketone ester is

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.360

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150 
that it increased serum cholesterol but

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:32.760 
that it increased serum cholesterol but
in<00:04:31.270> truth<00:04:31.509> the<00:04:31.630> matter<00:04:31.780> was<00:04:32.020> it<00:04:32.229> was<00:04:32.380> helping

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:32.770 
in truth the matter was it was helping

in truth the matter was it was helping
the<00:04:32.889> profile<00:04:33.310> of<00:04:33.340> the<00:04:33.610> serum<00:04:33.910> cholesterol

the profile of the serum cholesterol

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:36.420 
the profile of the serum cholesterol
that<00:04:35.020> never<00:04:35.289> has<00:04:35.500> been<00:04:35.680> corrected<00:04:36.220> in<00:04:36.400> the

that never has been corrected in the

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:39.240 
that never has been corrected in the
public<00:04:36.850> press<00:04:37.120> and<00:04:37.570> I<00:04:38.500> think<00:04:38.949> that's<00:04:39.130> the

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.250 
public press and I think that's the

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:41.070 
public press and I think that's the
reason<00:04:39.400> people<00:04:39.729> have<00:04:40.030> misconceptions<00:04:40.360> about

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.080 
reason people have misconceptions about

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.490 
reason people have misconceptions about
it<00:04:41.380> so<00:04:41.979> not<00:04:42.400> only<00:04:42.610> does<00:04:43.000> coconut<00:04:43.630> oil<00:04:43.870> improve

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:44.500 
it so not only does coconut oil improve

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.080 
it so not only does coconut oil improve
