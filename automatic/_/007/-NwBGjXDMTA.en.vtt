00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:06.870
 hi i am a princess 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:09.349
 Today my friends will tell you more about 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:12.059
 phantoms for grief nav 

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:14.280
 be sure to put likes if you want 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.119
 see more videos on this game and 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:21.140
 let's start with the most basic and 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:24.960
 specifically with the fact that phantoms and ghosts 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:28.170
 different phantom this image 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.240
 anything from the past for example a train 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.180
 ghost or ghost ship 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:36.329
 the appearance of the phantom is just a kind 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:39.360
 record of events in that or 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.430
 somewhere else a ghost is a soul or spirit 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.350
 human 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.460
 visible or otherwise manifested 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.800
 real life 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.230
 ghost appears if he did not move 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.570
 another dimension or urala 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.899
 since he did not accomplish his mission 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:57.510
 on earth after you learned what 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.940
 different phantom from the ghost turn 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.850
 to the game and start with gables from 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.700
 definitions can be understood that phantoms 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.760
 It may not be on the nameplates of chum salmon 

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:11.610
 for example ship or train in this case 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:14.760
 This animatronics also from the definition 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:17.250
 it can be understood that the phantom is 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:20.580
 by recording they cannot move by 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:23.549
 differently so the heating they appear 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:26.640
 same places and attacks 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.060
 guard equally for example phantom who 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.820
 for the sake of 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:33.030
 constantly passes right by us 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.020
 him windows and balun bout first appears 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.080
 on camcorder 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:41.250
 and then the office these actions 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:42.780
 the phantom performs cyclical and cannot 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.510
 change your action 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.369
 what is only a record 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:50.340
 while ghosts 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:53.759
 have different properties and abilities and 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:56.490
 can move independently different 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.950
 dimensions for example reality or in 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.650
 reflection there scott recently 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:04.560
 posted on the game page teaser with 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:07.710
 raider and signed it in three letters end 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:11.130
 of pi that stands for dreadful 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:14.070
 Fredbir and this means that the finder is 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:16.680
 not just a ghost but a nightmarish ghost and 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:19.520
 this fact further confirms my 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:22.410
 the theory of what the games are 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:25.320
 sign as it will appear in 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:27.269
 as ghost guard bridges and this 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:30.239
 sounds more believable 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:33.030
 as it is possible that the real world is Fredber's soul 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:35.400
 It has long been freed in general of all 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.019
 the above it can be concluded that 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.330
 in the whole series fnaf 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:42.840
 You can meet the spirit of animatronics 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.380
 ghosts and the shadow plane Shadow 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.049
 Freddie 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:49.079
 or fredber but about golden freddie 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:50.400
 it is unclear so far as the story igil here 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:53.430
 also look like a ghost 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:56.040
 but at the same time it can usually be 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:58.410
 hallucinations or guard's vision 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.900
 so call him a ghost yet 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:03.420
 I will because more is needed for this 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.310
 Facts I hope the release you liked and 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:09.239

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.220

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:12.020
 hallucinations 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.330
 I must put likes 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:16.790
