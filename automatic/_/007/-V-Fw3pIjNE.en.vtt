00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:56.799 
the chops okay now what we'll do is add

00:01:56.799 --> 00:01:58.499 
the chops okay now what we'll do is add
oh<00:01:56.830> I'd<00:01:57.190> say<00:01:57.220> an<00:01:57.520> inch<00:01:57.820> to<00:01:58.060> an<00:01:58.150> inch<00:01:58.270> and<00:01:58.450> a<00:01:58.479> half

00:01:58.499 --> 00:01:58.509 
oh I'd say an inch to an inch and a half

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:01.649 
oh I'd say an inch to an inch and a half
of<00:01:58.869> vegetable<00:01:59.500> oil<00:01:59.619> into<00:01:59.860> a<00:02:00.009> pan<00:02:00.280> and<00:02:00.659> heat

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:01.659 
of vegetable oil into a pan and heat

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:03.990 
of vegetable oil into a pan and heat
this<00:02:01.840> up<00:02:02.049> over<00:02:02.500> medium-high<00:02:03.009> heat<00:02:03.220> to<00:02:03.880> about

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 
this up over medium-high heat to about

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.160 
this up over medium-high heat to about
350<00:02:04.990> degrees<00:02:05.610> put<00:02:06.610> the<00:02:06.729> chops<00:02:06.970> in<00:02:07.240> in<00:02:07.600> batches

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
350 degrees put the chops in in batches

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.190 
350 degrees put the chops in in batches
and<00:02:08.410> fry<00:02:09.009> them<00:02:09.280> for<00:02:09.310> about<00:02:09.520> two<00:02:09.940> minutes<00:02:10.119> so<00:02:11.080> it

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
and fry them for about two minutes so it

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.809 
and fry them for about two minutes so it
really<00:02:11.380> depends<00:02:11.770> on<00:02:11.890> the<00:02:11.950> size<00:02:12.220> of<00:02:12.400> your<00:02:12.550> pan

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
really depends on the size of your pan

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:14.580 
really depends on the size of your pan
if<00:02:13.000> you<00:02:13.030> have<00:02:13.209> a<00:02:13.239> fairly<00:02:13.660> large<00:02:13.989> pan<00:02:14.350> you<00:02:14.500> can

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
if you have a fairly large pan you can
