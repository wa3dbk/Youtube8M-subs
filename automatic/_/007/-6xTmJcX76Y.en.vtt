 michel lacasse a presentation of 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.199

 quality that will fill your animals with 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:29.010
 company car 4 9 17 38 bah yes we 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.579
 was talking on the phone before going into 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.559
 hello michel waves so that's fine 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.710
 you yes today's shows which one 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.239
 is going to talk about a tool is working pretty much 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:46.410
 indispensable when one wants to raise a 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:48.420
 brand new dog that is great 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.850
 year that more and more popular 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.550
 for a few years in quebec in the 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.379
 canine world for a star the sapo de 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.109
 what exactly is it 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:01.680
 well it's simple a click hours a 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:03.510
 little plastic box makes a noise 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.369
 metallic one click 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:10.200
 when you press a noise like 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:12.960
 so this sound the water is always followed 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.540
 reinforcement so a treat and 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.390
 its mark the desired behavior of 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:21.090
 the animal in training to throw 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.070
 buyster positive reinforcement and 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.280
 besides in the waters it is often 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.259
 the method recommended for training 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.420
 because it works great all 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.939
 as with dogs are a super 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.549
 receptive to this method the water that is 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.250
 without constraint and without correction jump 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:40.380
 I want to clarify 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:43.110
 now the big question is 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.570
 how is the mandate broken 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.490
 with sow had started how 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.770
 proceed in more than before ancient after 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.290
 we row is Greek was rather 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.880
 easy is always worth clicking after that 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.369
 takes precision and a 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.460
 observations because the click is worth 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:02.399
 always meant to the dogs he comes 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:05.729
 to give us the desired behavior 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:08.459
 so to be effective but the signal 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.890
 really needs to be given at the moment 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.860
 same where the 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:15.410
 features walk produces a small example 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.860
 here if you want to learn a dog to 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.590
 sleep 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:21.319
 we can first of all theirs and hans of a 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.790
 way of doing and as soon as his belly is going 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:25.580
 touch the ground 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:28.780
 we see immediately clicked 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:32.180
 rewards and we only have two seconds 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.740
 maximum to summarize points so it's 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.840
 pass quickly and in all dom as well 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:38.450
 motivating because we give a treat 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:41.209
 so that the probabilities that the 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:44.180
 behavior repeats itself are very strong 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:46.910
 and the commandment to sleep the famous pew 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:49.400
 him but we go there added but when 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:50.570
 be sure that the animal is volta 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:54.140
 always like that it works 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:56.900
 now the water where we really start 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.760
 but really at this museum cloud phone 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.700
 it's when you completely forget 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:04.760
 bacon and we want to model a 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:06.680
 sauce behavior and when training 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:11.739
 the dog had something 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:15.170
 a click to each parcel of 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:17.510
 behavior axis brings many and his 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:19.850
 desire it to do I give another 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:21.799
 example here we want our group i 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:25.070
 everything goes in his little bed we go 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:27.290
 first the click is while he looks 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:30.230
 bind him to five feet away 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:33.230
 the click is then when they advance 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:36.410
 to him the click and when he puts no 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:39.500
 inside we could see them gradually 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:42.500
 reinforcing each of the pots in the direction 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:44.870
 but if lille until the dog gets 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:47.690
 find it all in by not saying 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:49.940
 nothing commands him again one 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:53.030
 will end up with the m but when we get 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:56.030
 reminds 300% that the dog bo because 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:58.400
 we want to ask him and if he ever 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:59.540
 discussed or they are still wrong 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.890
 workouts because it happens 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:03.620
 almost always a 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:05.680
 we will ignore what is wrong we are going 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:08.570
 reduce our expectations 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:11.200
 operate so slice and 

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:13.940
 reinforce good behavior 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:16.510
 it can be good there your long complex 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:18.640
 but it's simple you just 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:21.310
 follow certain rules and usually 

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:23.230
 but we arrive at very good results 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:25.240
 the khl he succeeds thus to make of 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:27.400
 short sessions always because that's 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.780
 of lagos mental stimulation is like 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:32.590
 jelly on Thursday from a friendly 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:34.630
 enormously the proud he will already be anne who 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:35.620
 will ask me if the voice is also 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:38.500
 effective 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:40.660
 the clae that when one enters there is this 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:42.370
 question dawn a japan always that this 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:45.640
 is a little less because the voice 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:47.680
 it's not a sound that existed six years 

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:48.010
 the duke he can without bets all the 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.070
 days 

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:53.920
 yes and the famous oats plugged in or even 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:57.190
 leiv will never be faster than the 

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:59.380
 that the clip yes so in this chapter loeb 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:00.910
 is true that this is the little can in 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:03.040
 plastic the fact that who prevail 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:05.020
 because he's faster 

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:07.180
 what we want and that it's a sound that 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:08.440
 is really distinct but what good 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:10.870
 Either all treaties have been able to 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:13.210
 serve as a marker of the blank is 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:15.790
 just that it's a little less of 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:19.120
 interested constructions resulted in no 

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:20.890
 case a month always suggest 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:22.870
 take a class to be sure 

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:25.240
 to have understood as the instrument 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:28.030
 works and especially of being able 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:29.680
 exploit it at the big maximum because 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:31.270
 good this morning we just did a brief 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:33.550
 overview of not talking about 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:35.500
 overturned scene behavior and even 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:36.970
 of all the rules concern the keys 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:39.130
 than the dean to have a good fortnight 

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:41.560

 those of karin workers whose site 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:46.480
 web or it contains a lot 

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:49.060
 it's really worth it 

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:53.080
 to go for a ride it's really the 

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:56.170
 queen of clae that karen 3rd direct peace 

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:58.120
