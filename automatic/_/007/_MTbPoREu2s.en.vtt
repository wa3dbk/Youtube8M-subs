00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
another rectangle and just fold it like

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.890 
another rectangle and just fold it like
in<00:02:31.930> thirds<00:02:32.650> this<00:02:32.980> time<00:02:33.540> we're<00:02:34.540> not<00:02:34.690> going<00:02:34.840> to

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
in thirds this time we're not going to

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.300 
in thirds this time we're not going to
fold<00:02:35.110> it<00:02:35.170> into<00:02:35.319> four<00:02:35.590> pages<00:02:35.800> we're<00:02:36.099> going<00:02:36.250> to

fold it into four pages we're going to

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.479 
fold it into four pages we're going to
fall<00:02:36.459> in<00:02:36.670> three<00:02:36.970> pages<00:02:37.209> this<00:02:37.480> time<00:02:37.720> and<00:02:38.370> put<00:02:39.370> it

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489 
fall in three pages this time and put it

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:40.920 
fall in three pages this time and put it
back<00:02:39.580> in<00:02:39.730> the<00:02:39.790> fridge<00:02:39.970> for<00:02:40.180> another<00:02:40.450> 15

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
back in the fridge for another 15

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.350 
back in the fridge for another 15
minutes<00:02:41.110> free<00:02:41.590> for<00:02:42.459> those<00:02:42.670> who<00:02:42.790> kind<00:02:42.970> of<00:02:43.030> relax

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:48.120 
minutes free for those who kind of relax
and<00:02:43.660> so<00:02:43.989> it<00:02:44.140> will<00:02:44.230> be<00:02:44.260> easier<00:02:44.739> to<00:02:44.800> work<00:02:45.099> later

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:52.500 

and<00:02:49.530> after<00:02:50.530> 15<00:02:51.040> minutes<00:02:51.250> I<00:02:51.520> kind<00:02:51.880> of<00:02:51.940> like<00:02:52.090> tug

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
and after 15 minutes I kind of like tug

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.250 
and after 15 minutes I kind of like tug
in<00:02:52.690> the<00:02:52.900> ends<00:02:53.260> to<00:02:53.470> inform<00:02:53.830> it<00:02:53.980> like<00:02:54.160> a

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
in the ends to inform it like a

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.200 
in the ends to inform it like a
rectangular<00:02:56.260> circular<00:02:57.070> shape<00:02:57.370> so<00:02:57.940> it's

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:58.210 
rectangular circular shape so it's

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:02.520 
rectangular circular shape so it's
easier<00:02:58.720> to<00:02:58.810> work<00:02:58.990> with<00:03:00.540> because<00:03:01.540> my<00:03:01.750> pie<00:03:02.200> dish

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
easier to work with because my pie dish

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.720 
easier to work with because my pie dish
is<00:03:02.800> circular<00:03:03.400> so<00:03:03.700> I<00:03:03.940> want<00:03:04.210> to<00:03:04.480> like<00:03:04.810> form<00:03:05.410> a

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
is circular so I want to like form a

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.630 
is circular so I want to like form a
rather<00:03:06.750> circular<00:03:07.750> Dolph<00:03:08.080> for<00:03:08.770> it<00:03:09.010> easier<00:03:09.520> to

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
rather circular Dolph for it easier to

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.870 
rather circular Dolph for it easier to
mow<00:03:09.820> down<00:03:10.000> to<00:03:10.270> the<00:03:10.390> pie<00:03:10.660> dish<00:03:11.430> so<00:03:12.430> I<00:03:12.460> kind<00:03:12.850> of

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880 
mow down to the pie dish so I kind of

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.510 
mow down to the pie dish so I kind of
gave<00:03:13.090> up<00:03:13.150> towards<00:03:13.690> the<00:03:13.810> end<00:03:13.900> on<00:03:14.530> making<00:03:15.220> the

gave up towards the end on making the

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.720 
gave up towards the end on making the
dough<00:03:15.760> can<00:03:16.150> look<00:03:16.390> circular<00:03:17.380> it<00:03:17.680> turns<00:03:18.280> out<00:03:18.520> to

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
dough can look circular it turns out to

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.400 
dough can look circular it turns out to
be<00:03:18.760> rectangle<00:03:19.660> squarish<00:03:20.440> but<00:03:20.830> forget<00:03:21.640> it<00:03:21.670> and

form<00:04:13.810> it<00:04:13.960> into<00:04:14.110> like<00:04:14.530> a<00:04:14.740> square<00:04:15.490> shape<00:04:15.820> and

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
form it into like a square shape and

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.300 
form it into like a square shape and
just<00:04:16.390> roll<00:04:16.630> it<00:04:16.780> out<00:04:16.930> into<00:04:16.959> like<00:04:17.530> thin<00:04:17.799> strips

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.310 
just roll it out into like thin strips

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:21.420 
just roll it out into like thin strips
so<00:04:18.820> we<00:04:19.030> can<00:04:19.239> top<00:04:19.510> the<00:04:20.049> doll<00:04:20.290> out<00:04:20.530> and<00:04:20.799> just<00:04:21.190> kind

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:21.430 
so we can top the doll out and just kind

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:26.040 
so we can top the doll out and just kind
of<00:04:21.459> measure<00:04:21.730> it<00:04:23.790> to<00:04:24.790> see<00:04:25.060> how<00:04:25.450> long<00:04:25.690> do<00:04:25.930> you

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.050 
of measure it to see how long do you

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:27.990 
of measure it to see how long do you
want<00:04:26.170> the<00:04:26.380> dough<00:04:26.530> to<00:04:26.560> be<00:04:26.890> and<00:04:27.160> just<00:04:27.610> kind<00:04:27.970> of

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.000 
want the dough to be and just kind of

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.670 
want the dough to be and just kind of
estimate<00:04:28.360> it<00:04:28.600> to<00:04:28.630> be<00:04:28.720> longer<00:04:29.080> so<00:04:29.410> it<00:04:29.500> would<00:04:29.620> be

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
estimate it to be longer so it would be

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.650 
estimate it to be longer so it would be
easier<00:04:30.010> to<00:04:30.100> work<00:04:30.250> with<00:04:30.310> and<00:04:30.730> after<00:04:31.390> the<00:04:31.480> dough

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:31.660 
easier to work with and after the dough

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:34.680 
easier to work with and after the dough
is<00:04:31.810> done<00:04:31.840> baking<00:04:32.560> like<00:04:32.980> buying<00:04:33.460> big<00:04:33.700> and<00:04:34.000> we
