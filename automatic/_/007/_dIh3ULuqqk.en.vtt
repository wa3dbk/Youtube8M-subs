00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
 Let's take a sequence and I'll ask for a new one. 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:05.250
 Let's start by going through the 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.870
 button is very easy to set up and 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.480
 buttons I 'm going to teach how 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.190
 exports it also 150 per cent and 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:15.350
 fifty I'll do the following 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:17.910
 I'm going to create a rectangle zin is quite simple 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:19.320
 ready if I want to do a button for 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.369
 example while rounding do with 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.640
 rounded corners 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:26.789
 I made a little button here, I'm going to change 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:30.840
 agreement of my button put a touch of 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:33.090
 blue gradient for him to put the blue 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.989
 Darker down here, okay, it's gonna stay 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.090
 thus 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.120
 I really like using buttons filters 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.829
 here as for example shadow and viseu 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.290
 so I really like putting a 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.270
 shadow it and I'll put the effect that 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.890
 biodiesel which is a relief can be a 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.219
 internal video 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.989
 Okay, here I can control my gradient. 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.820
 if I want to control the size of the 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.550
 bug here also a click on top of 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.500
 a double click on it to show your show I 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.440
 I put the station so low up 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.510
 just want to get higher so it's 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.880
 very large put the size of 5 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.220
 occurs then you can apply this feature 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.070
 that you want to propose the little button 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.810
 I'll leave it in this format here, my 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.560
 Optimize panel only confirm if I am 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.909
 with the png of the same beauty is done that 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.770
 I'll do the following, I'll get the 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.860
 tool or create a text 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:25.130
 any here put here by 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.070
 example 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:30.170
 then there you will configure the text that 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:33.009
 we leave more or less in the south-central 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.220
 Decrease how hot his mother is. 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:36.380
 beauty 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.579
 If I want a straight line, select the 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.490
 panel align as I taught 

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:43.250
 relative to the object in the center in the 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:45.110
 downtown ok ok but because it was not in 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.240
 middle 7 stayed there that has a problem 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:50.240
 when I have the effects of viseu 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:52.220
 in these and made of relief it passes aa 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.750
 interpret sometimes for example me 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.439
 I am seeing that the object arrives until 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.319
 here o 

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:59.119
 but projecting a rectangle goes up 

00:01:57.319 --> 00:02:00.860
 so he usually lined up from a 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:02.899
 different way you do not have to be 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.000
 It's about that there. 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:07.399
 select the two objects both background 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.979
 how much text or f8 grip for 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:12.049
 convert it to 15 give a motor brightness 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.730
 gives the name of home button I'll dial 

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:15.709
 here the option is button beyond the button 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.630
 can I make an object that will accept 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:18.980
 animation almost a graphic that will be 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.989
 an object to be stored in the 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.150
 library both any symbol is 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:24.560
 there the other three also stay there 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.299
 and it's okay 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.280
 one important thing is that here this 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:30.350
 green area button functionality area 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.880
 if it is a menu with buttons side by side 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:33.950
 the second button I put here from 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.660
 south side - suspended here vertically that 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.910
 staying down here he's going to have a 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.530
 functionality a certain part of it is 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.329
 it passes over that green part 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.090
 here then I have to adjust these 

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:47.180
 options to resize and leave 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.709
 these slices here as much as possible is 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.660
 next to the button if you have not 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:52.639
 viewing it here or viewing it on 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.590
 branding option guide for slices lessons and 

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:56.450
 it will clear it was taking 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.370
 Slice overlap also has no 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.500
 how do you control those options that I 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:03.049
 I just show then display displays 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:05.180
 deny the slices you can control 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:07.459
 so its functionality is only 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.109
 my - wherever you have a button 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:10.609
 made double click on it 

00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:12.139
 so I can configure the states 

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:13.760
 when a double-click enters the 

00:03:12.139 --> 00:03:15.230
 symbol I know I am inside the symbol 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.120
 who is showing his name to me 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.920
 Where do I want to go back to the previous one? 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:22.380
 Click there'll come here in my dashboard 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.360
 so in the states, I got here 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.700
 a status panel and he has to 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.770
 performances that the standard mode like 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.540
 it will show up on the site on which the 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:31.980
 when you mouse over it but the 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.209
 he disappeared because he has nothing not 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.370
 set in about whether I want 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:37.380
 dies he copied the previous one nor the 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.850
 graphic is up that the released I 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.830
 stay down here, come back to me 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:42.630
 Beauty 15 when hovering over 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:46.890
 I want this text here for example 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:48.569
 change color so I could make one 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:49.890
 I also click on the bottom 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:52.170
 object of the fund since I made the two 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:54.480
 separated could not get any lighter 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:57.030
 Ok, it was slow but it's beautiful 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.590
 coming back to the options here in the state yet 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.540
 What I have there is a third one 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:02.220
 pressed when I criticized the pawn 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.049
 The previous one was like this when I clicked. 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.910
 I want it to add, for example, the 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:07.980
 filter that I put on relief then 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:09.959
 I do not want it to stay that way. 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:12.180
 it stays in the shade they are also unmarked 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:14.280
 she also then lost the two 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:16.560
 effects he is third when I 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.120
 I click the button and the last one is about 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.410
 while pressed after 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.209
 Press when I go back I 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:22.410
 I want it to look like something I 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:24.360
 I want him to come back like he 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:26.700
 it was in the beginning then come here copy the 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:29.010
 objects released from the first frame and 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:30.900
 lap in the last frame then the first 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:32.820
 when I move the mouse 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.350
 When I click and when I pass the 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:37.110
 mouse on after after clicking 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:39.720
 He comes back the same as the first one. 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:42.510
 come back here is for us to test it there 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:43.950
 just press the f12 that it will publish 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:46.220
 with the browser let's look at how 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:46.220
 stayed 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:51.310
 carry the next lesson we 'll go 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:52.750
 visualized as I send it here pro 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:55.150
 pro alan 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:59.890
 I went wrong with it, I changed it, I clicked it 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:05:01.510
