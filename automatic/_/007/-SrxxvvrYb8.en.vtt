new teachers and we invited them to join

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:35.200 
new teachers and we invited them to join
the<00:00:33.829> list<00:00:33.980> so<00:00:34.280> the<00:00:34.399> number<00:00:34.850> of<00:00:34.940> teachers

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:35.210 
the list so the number of teachers

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.029 
the list so the number of teachers
watching<00:00:35.660> this<00:00:35.960> video<00:00:36.320> and<00:00:36.559> using<00:00:36.920> these

00:00:37.029 --> 00:00:37.039 
watching this video and using these

00:00:37.039 --> 00:00:39.490 
watching this video and using these
worksheets<00:00:37.519> has<00:00:38.120> just<00:00:38.510> about<00:00:38.750> doubled<00:00:39.289> this

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:39.500 
worksheets has just about doubled this

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.099 
worksheets has just about doubled this
week<00:00:39.829> so<00:00:40.609> we're<00:00:40.910> very<00:00:41.210> excited<00:00:41.390> to<00:00:41.839> have<00:00:41.960> you

week so we're very excited to have you

00:00:42.109 --> 00:00:44.979 
week so we're very excited to have you
on<00:00:42.260> board<00:00:42.289> and<00:00:42.679> a<00:00:43.219> big<00:00:43.519> welcome<00:00:43.999> to<00:00:44.030> you<00:00:44.210> and<00:00:44.660> of

course a welcome to everybody else

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:49.450 
course a welcome to everybody else
so<00:00:47.179> the<00:00:47.329> strategy<00:00:47.570> this<00:00:47.989> week<00:00:48.260> is<00:00:48.440> doubles<00:00:48.859> +1

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:49.460 
so the strategy this week is doubles +1

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.849 
so the strategy this week is doubles +1
this<00:00:50.149> comes<00:00:50.539> from<00:00:50.719> our<00:00:50.929> new<00:00:51.170> ebook<00:00:51.589> called

00:00:51.849 --> 00:00:51.859 
this comes from our new ebook called

00:00:51.859 --> 00:00:55.329 
this comes from our new ebook called
let's<00:00:52.190> go<00:00:52.609> for<00:00:53.359> grade<00:00:54.019> 1<00:00:54.260> or<00:00:54.289> you<00:00:54.589> two<00:00:54.859> students

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:55.339 
let's go for grade 1 or you two students

00:00:55.339 --> 00:00:57.459 
let's go for grade 1 or you two students
and<00:00:55.519> it's<00:00:55.819> from<00:00:55.999> the<00:00:56.149> second<00:00:56.659> book<00:00:56.809> which<00:00:57.289> is

00:00:57.459 --> 00:00:57.469 
and it's from the second book which is

00:00:57.469 --> 00:00:59.380 
and it's from the second book which is
all<00:00:57.620> about<00:00:57.859> addition<00:00:58.609> strategies

00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.390 
all about addition strategies

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.489 
all about addition strategies
so<00:01:00.260> the<00:01:00.440> strategy<00:01:00.710> doubles<00:01:01.489> sorry<00:01:02.420> double<00:01:02.839> +1

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:03.499 
so the strategy doubles sorry double +1

00:01:03.499 --> 00:01:05.890 
so the strategy doubles sorry double +1
is<00:01:03.769> based<00:01:04.220> of<00:01:04.489> course<00:01:04.519> on<00:01:04.970> knowing<00:01:05.479> doubles

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:05.900 
is based of course on knowing doubles

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.930 
is based of course on knowing doubles
and<00:01:06.170> the<00:01:06.740> first<00:01:06.980> thing<00:01:07.190> to<00:01:07.310> say<00:01:07.340> is<00:01:07.550> if<00:01:07.820> a

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:07.940 
and the first thing to say is if a

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:09.580 
and the first thing to say is if a
student<00:01:08.150> didn't<00:01:08.600> know<00:01:08.810> the<00:01:09.020> doubles<00:01:09.380> then

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
student didn't know the doubles then

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.220 
student didn't know the doubles then
stop<00:01:10.220> and<00:01:10.640> go<00:01:10.970> back<00:01:11.000> and<00:01:11.360> revise<00:01:11.570> those<00:01:11.900> first

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:12.230 
stop and go back and revise those first

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:14.620 
stop and go back and revise those first
because<00:01:12.590> this<00:01:13.220> strategy<00:01:13.730> relies<00:01:14.090> on<00:01:14.150> knowing

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 
because this strategy relies on knowing

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:16.900 
because this strategy relies on knowing
those<00:01:14.840> so<00:01:15.110> doubles<00:01:15.830> +1<00:01:16.220> facts<00:01:16.580> aren't<00:01:16.790> that

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:16.910 
those so doubles +1 facts aren't that

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.960 
those so doubles +1 facts aren't that
simple<00:01:17.240> and<00:01:18.110> I'm<00:01:18.260> starting<00:01:18.530> with<00:01:18.770> 6<00:01:19.040> plus<00:01:19.310> 7<00:01:19.580> if

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:19.970 
simple and I'm starting with 6 plus 7 if

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:21.820 
simple and I'm starting with 6 plus 7 if
you<00:01:20.510> don't<00:01:20.690> have<00:01:20.810> something<00:01:21.050> to<00:01:21.260> go<00:01:21.380> back<00:01:21.590> on

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:21.830 
you don't have something to go back on

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:22.990 
you don't have something to go back on
you<00:01:22.100> know<00:01:22.190> that's<00:01:22.430> going<00:01:22.610> to<00:01:22.700> be<00:01:22.790> rather

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
you know that's going to be rather

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.440 
you know that's going to be rather
difficult<00:01:23.230> so<00:01:24.670> we're<00:01:25.670> basically<00:01:25.820> going<00:01:26.180> to

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
difficult so we're basically going to

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.060 
difficult so we're basically going to
say<00:01:26.540> to<00:01:26.780> the<00:01:27.080> student<00:01:27.410> do<00:01:27.470> you<00:01:27.530> know<00:01:27.650> what<00:01:27.800> 6

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.070 
say to the student do you know what 6

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.580 
say to the student do you know what 6
plus<00:01:28.280> 6<00:01:28.490> is<00:01:28.760> and<00:01:29.630> they'll<00:01:29.900> say<00:01:30.170> they<00:01:30.380> know<00:01:30.560> the

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
plus 6 is and they'll say they know the

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.650 
plus 6 is and they'll say they know the
answer<00:01:31.010> is<00:01:31.130> 12<00:01:31.310> and<00:01:31.640> then<00:01:31.760> we'll<00:01:31.970> say<00:01:32.150> what<00:01:32.390> 6

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:32.660 
answer is 12 and then we'll say what 6

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:34.990 
answer is 12 and then we'll say what 6
plus<00:01:32.870> 7<00:01:33.110> and<00:01:33.470> the<00:01:33.950> worksheets<00:01:34.430> take<00:01:34.790> that

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
plus 7 and the worksheets take that

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.970 
plus 7 and the worksheets take that
approach<00:01:35.270> so<00:01:35.600> they're<00:01:35.750> not<00:01:35.840> just<00:01:36.080> random

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:36.980 
approach so they're not just random

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:38.710 
approach so they're not just random
double<00:01:37.280> plus<00:01:37.520> 1<00:01:37.730> questions<00:01:38.210> but<00:01:38.420> they're<00:01:38.600> in

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:38.720 
double plus 1 questions but they're in

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.560 
double plus 1 questions but they're in
pairs<00:01:39.080> so<00:01:39.920> we<00:01:40.010> have<00:01:40.130> a<00:01:40.160> double<00:01:40.550> first<00:01:40.760> and<00:01:41.060> then

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 
pairs so we have a double first and then

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:43.750 
pairs so we have a double first and then
a<00:01:41.600> double<00:01:41.840> plus<00:01:42.140> one<00:01:42.410> and<00:01:42.710> so<00:01:42.920> on<00:01:42.950> so<00:01:43.490> with<00:01:43.640> the

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:43.760 
a double plus one and so on so with the

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.860 
a double plus one and so on so with the
10<00:01:44.000> frame<00:01:45.100> it's<00:01:46.100> a<00:01:46.400> fairly<00:01:46.970> simple<00:01:47.510> matter<00:01:47.570> to

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:47.870 
10 frame it's a fairly simple matter to

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:50.110 
10 frame it's a fairly simple matter to
show<00:01:48.260> the<00:01:48.470> doubles<00:01:48.830> they<00:01:49.460> should<00:01:49.700> be<00:01:49.880> familiar

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:50.120 
show the doubles they should be familiar

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.780 
show the doubles they should be familiar
with<00:01:50.600> that<00:01:50.780> pattern<00:01:51.140> in<00:01:51.680> the<00:01:51.920> case<00:01:52.130> of<00:01:52.370> sixes

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:52.790 
with that pattern in the case of sixes

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:54.760 
with that pattern in the case of sixes
in<00:01:52.970> the<00:01:53.090> case<00:01:53.270> of<00:01:53.420> all<00:01:53.600> the<00:01:53.810> doubles<00:01:54.170> we're

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
in the case of all the doubles we're

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.280 
in the case of all the doubles we're
going<00:01:54.950> to<00:01:55.100> use<00:01:55.400> everyday<00:01:56.150> contexts<00:01:56.840> so<00:01:57.020> four

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290 
going to use everyday contexts so four

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.590 
going to use everyday contexts so four
sixes<00:01:57.860> we<00:01:58.460> can<00:01:58.640> talk<00:01:58.820> about<00:01:58.940> eggs<00:01:59.240> being

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
sixes we can talk about eggs being

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.810 
sixes we can talk about eggs being
packed<00:01:59.930> in<00:02:00.140> dozens<00:02:00.620> and<00:02:00.800> half<00:02:01.070> dozens<00:02:01.640> and

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.820 
packed in dozens and half dozens and

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.570 
packed in dozens and half dozens and
tell<00:02:02.420> stories<00:02:02.750> about<00:02:02.780> that<00:02:03.200> and<00:02:04.130> then<00:02:04.460> of

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:04.580 
tell stories about that and then of

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.130 
tell stories about that and then of
course<00:02:04.790> we<00:02:04.970> just<00:02:05.000> put<00:02:05.360> one<00:02:05.540> more<00:02:05.690> and<00:02:05.840> say<00:02:05.960> how

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
course we just put one more and say how

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.410 
course we just put one more and say how
many<00:02:06.200> are<00:02:06.470> there<00:02:06.620> now<00:02:06.910> refer<00:02:07.910> to<00:02:08.090> the<00:02:08.209> number

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
many are there now refer to the number

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.749 
many are there now refer to the number
five<00:02:08.629> six<00:02:08.899> plus<00:02:09.110> seven<00:02:09.399> later<00:02:10.399> on<00:02:10.640> the

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
five six plus seven later on the

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:12.339 
five six plus seven later on the
worksheets<00:02:11.150> there<00:02:11.480> are<00:02:11.599> some<00:02:11.780> turnaround

00:02:12.339 --> 00:02:12.349 
worksheets there are some turnaround

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:14.770 
worksheets there are some turnaround
facts<00:02:12.680> like<00:02:12.890> that<00:02:12.950> and<00:02:13.879> so<00:02:14.120> we<00:02:14.269> can<00:02:14.420> use<00:02:14.599> the

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
facts like that and so we can use the

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:15.309 
facts like that and so we can use the
same

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:15.319 
same

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:18.160 
same
approach<00:02:16.090> one<00:02:17.090> thing<00:02:17.329> to<00:02:17.450> say<00:02:17.629> here<00:02:17.810> seven

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
approach one thing to say here seven

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.319 
approach one thing to say here seven
plus<00:02:18.349> six<00:02:18.560> you<00:02:18.829> could<00:02:19.189> have<00:02:19.489> a<00:02:19.519> child<00:02:19.879> say<00:02:20.180> well

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:20.329 
plus six you could have a child say well

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:22.720 
plus six you could have a child say well
I<00:02:20.359> know<00:02:20.480> seven<00:02:20.989> plus<00:02:21.170> seven<00:02:21.469> and<00:02:21.889> I<00:02:22.310> can<00:02:22.519> take

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
I know seven plus seven and I can take

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.209 
I know seven plus seven and I can take
one<00:02:22.969> away<00:02:23.269> so<00:02:23.959> it<00:02:24.079> is<00:02:24.170> actually<00:02:24.590> the<00:02:24.739> same<00:02:24.980> of

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:25.219 
one away so it is actually the same of

00:02:25.219 --> 00:02:27.489 
one away so it is actually the same of
course<00:02:25.310> as<00:02:25.819> a<00:02:25.879> double<00:02:26.359> take<00:02:26.840> away<00:02:27.109> one<00:02:27.319> I

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:27.499 
course as a double take away one I

00:02:27.499 --> 00:02:29.709 
course as a double take away one I
wouldn't<00:02:28.099> teach<00:02:28.280> both<00:02:28.609> strategies<00:02:29.269> I<00:02:29.480> think

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:29.719 
wouldn't teach both strategies I think

00:02:29.719 --> 00:02:31.360 
wouldn't teach both strategies I think
that<00:02:29.870> would<00:02:30.019> confuse<00:02:30.409> the<00:02:30.650> students<00:02:31.040> giving

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
that would confuse the students giving

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.459 
that would confuse the students giving
them<00:02:31.489> too<00:02:31.639> many<00:02:31.760> choices<00:02:32.060> but<00:02:33.049> it's<00:02:33.170> certainly

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:33.469 
them too many choices but it's certainly

00:02:33.469 --> 00:02:36.009 
them too many choices but it's certainly
an<00:02:33.560> option<00:02:33.709> if<00:02:34.280> the<00:02:34.489> students<00:02:34.849> can<00:02:34.969> do<00:02:35.150> it<00:02:35.239> okay

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:36.019 
an option if the students can do it okay

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:37.869 
an option if the students can do it okay
that's<00:02:36.200> it<00:02:36.409> for<00:02:36.439> this<00:02:36.650> video<00:02:36.859> I<00:02:37.310> hope<00:02:37.519> you've

00:02:37.869 --> 00:02:37.879 
that's it for this video I hope you've

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:39.220 
that's it for this video I hope you've
enjoyed<00:02:38.239> it<00:02:38.269> and<00:02:38.420> I'll<00:02:38.719> talk<00:02:38.930> to<00:02:38.989> you<00:02:39.109> next

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:50.970 
enjoyed it and I'll talk to you next
time
