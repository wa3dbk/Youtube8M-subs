00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:13.160
 potatoes on fire 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:17.419
 nobody can 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:21.919
 Yes, you must first cut it into three parts

 cut 4 pieces, too, this potato here 

00:00:25.999 --> 00:00:33.559
 such slices 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:37.160
 I discharged a piece of bacon right away 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:45.260
 take wrote put between slices can be seen 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:48.699
 and so 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:53.199

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:53.199
 potato bacon bacon potato 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:01:00.249
 garlic is also cut that fit 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.249
 here are the slots 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:15.800
 You can already wrap in foil 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:18.350
 but if you want to be confused what tastier 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.130
 it turned out you can take more onions 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.130
 get out of it 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:24.070
 round part what time has it fallen 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:26.240
 provide another need to put another 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.910
 because she got out entirely 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:32.360
 neatly and so do here 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:38.830
 hats such as potatoes on one side 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:40.790
 hat on the other side of the potato hat

 sale it is desirable that it be 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:43.580
 saline so as not to salt a hundred times 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:48.220
 potatoes in the country 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:57.050

 badge 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.570
 the filling probably fell from above 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:15.630
 and this sandwich 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:20.140
 wrap the foil in this way 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:28.570

 five minutes have passed 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:14.239
 most likely three deposits for a fee 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:16.640
 potatoes she fell apart 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:20.580
