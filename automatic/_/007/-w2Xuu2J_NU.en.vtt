 I am very comfortable also vegetables and 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.170
 I'm anti recipe model showing how 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.850
 is that I prepare my vegetables but they are 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.710
 different ingredients and now I'm 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.660
 using other ingredients then for 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.059
 have the variety really good 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.280
 let's start tran video well we're going to 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.739
 need half an onion me 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:47.160
 here I put it in slices after 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:49.980
 we are going to need these green peas 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:53.850
 which are beans or peas after I go to 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:56.699
 I need a whole red pepper that I 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.670
 love after the special ingredient 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:02.430
 is the cauliflower I love the cauliflower is 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.589
 a delicious and very easy ingredient 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.200
 prepare so we're going to need 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.359
 then a garlic as always you already 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:13.439
 you know my recipe can not miss the garlic 

00:01:09.359 --> 00:01:14.189
 let's put an oil in our 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.770
 pan try 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.520
 previously warm I will put them 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.250
 garlic 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:23.649
 and then a little red chilito of these and not 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.899
 let your eye wear this black 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:28.210
 because later he tastes very bitter and he knows 

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:30.039
 very very bad and good I'm going to put these 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:33.219
 peas are distributed because these are 

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:34.990
 those that last longer in well in preparing 

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:37.210
 true in cooking so let's go to 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:40.420
 put it there we will take care of our 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:42.880
 pan and meanwhile I'll put here 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.979
 the cauliflower to sew very quickly that the 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.569
 truth is that it is very little what is 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:48.729
 It takes up because I do not like it because it does not 

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:50.289
 I like that the cauliflower is cut 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:53.229
 that's good here I'm going to put the onion in 

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:55.299
 the pan I will stir very well I will 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:59.069
 leave for a while about 5 minutes nothing more 

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:59.069
 to caramelize well 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:11.500
 and I'll let it rest with a few dots 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:15.300
 while as it has already been so 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.300
 onion I will put the red pepper 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.159
 then here I am going to put my 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.310
 favorite seasonings you already know 

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:36.280

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:39.519

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:41.470

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:45.430

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:47.709
 ingredients ok and let's put little to 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:51.250

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:54.609
 cooked now and together with the other see what 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:56.379
 rich and this is set to last as 

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:58.000
 it is because it is cooked then 

00:02:56.379 --> 00:02:59.349

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.659
