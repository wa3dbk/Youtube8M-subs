00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
that actually nucleic acids are used as

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.150 
that actually nucleic acids are used as
a<00:00:32.099> means<00:00:32.340> to<00:00:32.820> transfer<00:00:33.570> our<00:00:33.890> energy<00:00:34.890> and

a means to transfer our energy and

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.940 
a means to transfer our energy and
that's<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:36.059> molecule<00:00:36.450> known<00:00:36.630> as<00:00:36.809> ATP<00:00:37.410> and

that's the molecule known as ATP and
that's<00:00:38.340> a<00:00:38.520> trick<00:00:38.850> question<00:00:38.879> that<00:00:39.329> a<00:00:39.360> lot<00:00:39.420> of

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
that's a trick question that a lot of

because<00:00:43.530> people<00:00:43.860> forget<00:00:44.010> that<00:00:44.309> ATP<00:00:44.640> is

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
because people forget that ATP is

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.740 
because people forget that ATP is
actually<00:00:45.270> a<00:00:45.420> kind<00:00:45.780> of<00:00:46.079> nucleic<00:00:46.620> acid

end you'll have the one thing that makes

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.649 
end you'll have the one thing that makes

will<00:01:58.770> use<00:01:59.009> guanine<00:01:59.549> adenine<00:02:00.090> and<00:02:00.329> cytosine

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
will use guanine adenine and cytosine

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.800 
will use guanine adenine and cytosine
the<00:02:01.320> one<00:02:01.500> difference<00:02:02.130> in<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:03.060> bases<00:02:03.479> between

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
the one difference in the bases between

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.770 
the one difference in the bases between
RNA<00:02:04.140> and<00:02:04.350> DNA<00:02:04.380> is<00:02:04.890> that<00:02:05.340> they'll<00:02:05.579> have<00:02:05.880> uracil

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
RNA and DNA is that they'll have uracil

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.990 
RNA and DNA is that they'll have uracil
in<00:02:07.020> place<00:02:07.259> of<00:02:07.500> thymine<00:02:07.740> now<00:02:08.640> let's<00:02:08.819> take<00:02:08.970> a

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
in place of thymine now let's take a

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.059 
in place of thymine now let's take a
look<00:02:09.270> at<00:02:09.420> how<00:02:09.869> you<00:02:09.929> join<00:02:10.379> these<00:02:10.649> nucleotides

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
look at how you join these nucleotides

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.979 
look at how you join these nucleotides
together<00:02:11.400> and<00:02:11.879> what<00:02:12.209> happens<00:02:12.569> is<00:02:12.720> that<00:02:12.750> the

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
together and what happens is that the

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:13.910 
together and what happens is that the
phosphate<00:02:13.470> of

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
phosphate of

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.550

one nucleotide here joins the sugar of
the<00:02:16.800> next<00:02:17.160> nucleotide<00:02:17.550> forming<00:02:18.540> a<00:02:18.690> long

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
the next nucleotide forming a long

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.910

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
that strand there now you commonly will

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.059 
that strand there now you commonly will
draw<00:02:59.250> DNA<00:02:59.910> in<00:03:00.180> a<00:03:00.390> ladder<00:03:00.720> form<00:03:01.049> like<00:03:01.230> this<00:03:01.440> kind

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 
draw DNA in a ladder form like this kind

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:05.690 
draw DNA in a ladder form like this kind
of<00:03:02.130> like<00:03:02.220> this<00:03:02.549> looks<00:03:02.760> like<00:03:02.880> a<00:03:02.940> ladder<00:03:03.860> but<00:03:04.860> you

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
of like this looks like a ladder but you

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.180 
of like this looks like a ladder but you
know<00:03:05.940> that<00:03:06.390> DNA<00:03:06.600> forms<00:03:07.080> a<00:03:07.140> double<00:03:07.350> helix<00:03:07.830> a

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
know that DNA forms a double helix a

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.789 
know that DNA forms a double helix a
helix<00:03:08.610> is<00:03:08.760> a<00:03:08.880> corkscrew<00:03:09.299> shape<00:03:09.870> now<00:03:10.470> we<00:03:10.500> call

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799 
helix is a corkscrew shape now we call

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:13.009 
helix is a corkscrew shape now we call
it<00:03:10.920> a<00:03:11.010> double<00:03:11.340> helix<00:03:11.489> because<00:03:11.970> there's<00:03:12.269> one

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
it a double helix because there's one

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:15.320 
it a double helix because there's one
two<00:03:13.500> strands<00:03:14.040> and<00:03:14.130> they<00:03:14.459> get<00:03:14.610> twisted<00:03:14.880> up<00:03:15.150> in

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
two strands and they get twisted up in

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.020 
two strands and they get twisted up in
this<00:03:15.480> shape<00:03:15.660> like<00:03:15.870> that<00:03:16.430> so<00:03:17.430> this<00:03:17.640> is<00:03:17.700> the

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
this shape like that so this is the

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.090 
this shape like that so this is the
structure<00:03:18.299> of<00:03:18.450> nucleic<00:03:18.870> acids<00:03:19.410> again

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
structure of nucleic acids again

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.640 
structure of nucleic acids again
individually<00:03:20.700> it's<00:03:21.299> just<00:03:21.570> a<00:03:21.690> to<00:03:22.109> long<00:03:22.290> chains

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
individually it's just a to long chains

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.360 
individually it's just a to long chains
of<00:03:23.090> nucleotides<00:03:24.090> joined<00:03:24.390> together<00:03:24.480> but<00:03:25.470> then

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
of nucleotides joined together but then

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.660 
of nucleotides joined together but then
wound<00:03:26.730> up<00:03:26.880> it<00:03:27.150> forms<00:03:27.570> the<00:03:27.690> nice<00:03:28.019> long<00:03:28.670> term

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
wound up it forms the nice long term

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:31.160 
wound up it forms the nice long term
stable<00:03:30.180> structure<00:03:30.540> known<00:03:30.720> as<00:03:30.750> the<00:03:30.959> double
