textures you can choose from there's

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:22.349 
textures you can choose from there's
black<00:03:20.049> brown<00:03:20.440> or<00:03:20.650> white<00:03:20.950> which<00:03:21.640> I<00:03:21.850> presume<00:03:22.180> is

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:22.359 
black brown or white which I presume is

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:25.080 
black brown or white which I presume is
the<00:03:22.540> color<00:03:22.810> of<00:03:22.959> the<00:03:23.109> fur<00:03:23.350> I<00:03:23.620> only<00:03:24.549> tested<00:03:25.000> that

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
the color of the fur I only tested that

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.270 
the color of the fur I only tested that
one<00:03:25.359> and<00:03:25.600> that<00:03:25.660> was<00:03:26.019> the<00:03:26.200> white<00:03:26.500> one<00:03:26.769> which<00:03:27.100> is

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
one and that was the white one which is

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.210 
one and that was the white one which is
the<00:03:27.430> one<00:03:27.549> you're<00:03:27.700> seeing<00:03:27.850> in<00:03:28.030> the<00:03:28.150> video<00:03:28.239> I

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
the one you're seeing in the video I

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.530 
the one you're seeing in the video I
personally<00:03:30.220> chose<00:03:30.430> the<00:03:30.700> white<00:03:30.970> one<00:03:31.180> because<00:03:31.450> I

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
personally chose the white one because I

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.420 
personally chose the white one because I
thought<00:03:31.720> it's<00:03:31.930> more<00:03:32.079> realistic<00:03:32.470> than<00:03:32.950> having

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
thought it's more realistic than having

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.069 
thought it's more realistic than having
black<00:03:33.700> which<00:03:34.030> it<00:03:34.209> was<00:03:34.299> like<00:03:34.480> in<00:03:34.660> the<00:03:34.870> original

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:35.079 
black which it was like in the original

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:37.470 
black which it was like in the original
as<00:03:35.620> these<00:03:36.160> are<00:03:36.190> people<00:03:36.819> living<00:03:37.090> in<00:03:37.180> the<00:03:37.269> snow

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
as these are people living in the snow

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.479 
as these are people living in the snow
so<00:03:37.810> they're<00:03:37.989> more<00:03:38.109> likely<00:03:38.530> to<00:03:38.680> get<00:03:38.799> fur<00:03:39.069> from

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489 
so they're more likely to get fur from

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:40.430 
so they're more likely to get fur from
snow

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
snow

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:04.770

on that note I couldn't help but notice

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:20.900 
on that note I couldn't help but notice
a<00:05:18.720> couple<00:05:19.200> of<00:05:19.380> issues<00:05:19.590> with<00:05:19.830> other<00:05:20.220> aspects<00:05:20.790> of

a couple of issues with other aspects of

a couple of issues with other aspects of

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:24.680 
the mod I'm not trying to diss encourage
the<00:05:23.190> author<00:05:23.370> but<00:05:23.669> this<00:05:23.850> still<00:05:24.090> feels<00:05:24.360> like<00:05:24.540> it

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:24.690 
the author but this still feels like it

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:28.370 
the author but this still feels like it
needs<00:05:24.870> a<00:05:24.960> lot<00:05:25.110> of<00:05:25.140> work<00:05:26.840> there<00:05:27.840> was<00:05:27.930> one<00:05:28.110> area

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:28.380 
needs a lot of work there was one area

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:29.900 
needs a lot of work there was one area
of<00:05:28.440> the<00:05:28.500> map<00:05:28.800> that<00:05:28.830> was<00:05:29.040> literally<00:05:29.400> just<00:05:29.700> a

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:29.910 
of the map that was literally just a

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:32.060 
of the map that was literally just a
vast<00:05:30.210> empty<00:05:30.630> space<00:05:31.050> but<00:05:31.560> don't<00:05:31.740> get<00:05:31.919> me<00:05:32.040> wrong

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:32.070 
vast empty space but don't get me wrong

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:34.250 
vast empty space but don't get me wrong
two<00:05:32.430> other<00:05:32.580> areas<00:05:32.790> which<00:05:33.210> included<00:05:33.720> a<00:05:33.870> desert

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:34.260 
two other areas which included a desert

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.670 
two other areas which included a desert
and<00:05:34.410> a<00:05:34.530> large<00:05:34.770> forest<00:05:35.100> were<00:05:35.400> very<00:05:35.640> well<00:05:35.880> made

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:36.680 
and a large forest were very well made

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:38.900 
and a large forest were very well made
overall<00:05:37.680> I<00:05:37.830> think<00:05:37.890> this<00:05:38.190> mod<00:05:38.400> could<00:05:38.580> do<00:05:38.730> with<00:05:38.880> a

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:38.910 
overall I think this mod could do with a

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:40.760 
overall I think this mod could do with a
bit<00:05:39.240> of<00:05:39.360> improvement<00:05:39.510> but<00:05:40.140> once<00:05:40.320> that's<00:05:40.560> done

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:40.770 
bit of improvement but once that's done

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:42.350 
bit of improvement but once that's done
