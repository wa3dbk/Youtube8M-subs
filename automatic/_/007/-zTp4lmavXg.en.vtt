00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:19.410
 Talk to you guys, beauty, everything for you more. 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.360
 a backoffice video a staff 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.800
 we are here my pc to make one more 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.090
 td and today is a different match 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.950
 folks 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.500
 not that the game itself is already different is 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:31.230
 an ordinary team that we're going to do with 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.030
 the python that is the revolver 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.829
 I remember having a personal had 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.900
 prevented from playing with a revolver is only 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.460
 with the magnum and come on let's see if the 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.980
 we get along well right guy 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.390
 This is a very good one even more confess 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.430
 load hotten 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.520
 We just have to stay at a 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:50.149
 short and medium distance distance 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.149
 to kill the enemies 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.200
 that's it 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.329
 I 'm going to have it here because it's not a good 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.210
 huh 

00:01:10.329 --> 00:01:16.810
 the firing line is very far and people 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:19.350
 You have to stay close to the right for broken into 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.350
 inside inside 

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:41.739
 the wii has people there was not lying 

00:01:37.239 --> 00:01:43.959
 old dirty I'm here with the machine 

00:01:41.739 --> 00:01:47.619
 just to stay with the faster class 

00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:50.009
 because I do not think there's any way to get good 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:53.259
 do not laugh 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:56.340
 I'm here because I do not think I can 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:58.209
 take the primary aquino lopes 102 has 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.649
 but I do not think there's anything 

00:01:58.209 --> 00:02:02.289
 so I left the mark here for 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:09.990
 get faster even as apple to 

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:15.900
 arrive here we are who will 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:17.700
 Who loves us, this is what the plan 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:21.300
 or assist in trying to put some 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:29.180
 thing here is already quite busy 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:39.300
 Sodium was mine we passed on 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:45.900
 or not 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:47.670
 but not crazy coast what this will give 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.160
 a walk in the same field 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:52.950
 I think the best option is we are 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.450
 with the marathÃ³n deception function 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.900
 so we can take the map of 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.900
 cap 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:06.930
 It's going to be good, it's not very divided. 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:10.400
 room is to see the map is half the team 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.400
 from one side to the other 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:19.100
 someone here in my 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:42.010
 the attack comes is mine I just want the 3 

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:45.120
 on top of the crazy is a lie I got to 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:48.120
 putting the crosshair on the animal's head is 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.120
 slutty 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:57.580
 get there does not stick arrives this is not a 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:04:02.370
 very suitable map to do this not 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:02.370
 it's good 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:10.930
 it 's not that 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:13.239
 the picture is another hand when trying to stay 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:15.340
 positive occurs with which made a 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:30.699
 crazy line 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:41.430
 there died in the street and I in one and 

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:41.430
 bus will be online no 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:47.800
 I watched it is not run like a doc 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:52.659
 Oh my, we're so frantic coming 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:05:11.150
 When I'm going to stay positive in the 

00:04:57.349 --> 00:05:16.930
 neighborhood lie there I have commented on 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:16.930
 mouse sensitivity and vetoed toc toc 

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:24.729
 Guarded, he's going to show up. 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:24.729
 Someone here will not 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:45.680
 not change the long will change good not nearly 

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:50.569
 I took the last one and come and tell me what I want 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:53.659
 in the crosshairs just shakes neymar made a 

00:05:50.569 --> 00:05:55.490
 I'm glad I did it, but that's it. 

00:05:53.659 --> 00:05:57.529
 I liked who knows how to get into another one. 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:58.490
 playing with passion only for 

00:05:57.529 --> 00:06:00.050
 you do not 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:02.389
 If you liked the video frame video 

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:03.860
 I liked your personal favorite and 

00:06:02.389 --> 00:06:05.840

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:10.599
