well it's important at this time because

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.660 
well it's important at this time because
if<00:01:13.720> we<00:01:13.870> look<00:01:14.080> at<00:01:14.229> where<00:01:14.560> the<00:01:14.800> Affordable<00:01:15.490> Care

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680 
Act is going to take us and we look at

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.500

the more increased population having

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:21.750 
the more increased population having
insurance<00:01:19.750> and<00:01:20.350> we<00:01:20.979> think<00:01:21.190> about<00:01:21.430> people

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:21.760 
insurance and we think about people

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.520 
insurance and we think about people
receiving<00:01:22.420> care<00:01:22.780> that<00:01:22.990> may<00:01:23.140> not<00:01:23.320> have

received care before it is very timely

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.680 
received care before it is very timely
that<00:01:26.920> we<00:01:27.040> begin<00:01:27.400> to<00:01:27.550> think<00:01:27.729> about<00:01:28.030> how<00:01:28.270> we

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:28.690 
that we begin to think about how we

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:31.920 
that we begin to think about how we
deliver<00:01:29.200> this<00:01:29.619> care<00:01:29.920> to<00:01:30.160> the<00:01:30.250> public<00:01:30.930> through
