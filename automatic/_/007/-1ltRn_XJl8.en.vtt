low profile block brackets lofts you
take<00:03:38.970> up<00:03:39.120> two<00:03:39.300> spots<00:03:39.570> if<00:03:39.840> you<00:03:39.989> have<00:03:40.140> a<00:03:40.170> case

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
take up two spots if you have a case

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.680 
take up two spots if you have a case
that<00:03:40.830> takes<00:03:41.190> the<00:03:41.989> low<00:03:42.989> profile<00:03:43.500> system<00:03:43.800> here

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 
that takes the low profile system here

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:50.170 
that takes the low profile system here
which<00:03:45.690> would<00:03:45.870> be<00:03:46.110> set<00:03:46.860> up<00:03:46.980> mainly<00:03:47.489> for<00:03:48.000> an<00:03:48.980> htpc

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
which would be set up mainly for an htpc

which would be set up mainly for an htpc
of<00:03:51.180> course<00:03:51.420> you<00:03:51.540> could<00:03:51.720> put<00:03:51.840> on<00:03:51.989> the<00:03:52.250> other

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
of course you could put on the other

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:54.890 
of course you could put on the other
bracket<00:03:53.760> that<00:03:53.880> came<00:03:54.060> with<00:03:54.270> it<00:03:54.300> and<00:03:54.570> you'd<00:03:54.690> have

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
bracket that came with it and you'd have

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.380 
bracket that came with it and you'd have
a<00:03:55.170> little<00:03:55.380> single<00:03:56.280> slot<00:03:56.609> solution<00:03:57.239> rather

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
a little single slot solution rather

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:58.130 
a little single slot solution rather
than<00:03:57.570> a

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
than a

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.920 
than a
low<00:03:58.380> profile<00:03:58.890> to<00:03:59.130> spot<00:03:59.400> solutions<00:04:00.590> well<00:04:01.590> let's

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
low profile to spot solutions well let's

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:08.059 
low profile to spot solutions well let's
put<00:04:03.930> it<00:04:04.050> in<00:04:04.140> and<00:04:04.440> see<00:04:04.770> what<00:04:05.010> the<00:04:05.670> 66<00:04:06.270> HD<00:04:06.840> 70<00:04:07.709> from

00:04:08.059 --> 00:04:08.069 
put it in and see what the 66 HD 70 from

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:12.920 
put it in and see what the 66 HD 70 from
sapphire<00:04:09.170> is<00:04:10.170> capable<00:04:10.560> of<00:04:10.680> doing
