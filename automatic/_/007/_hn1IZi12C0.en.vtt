00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:20.830 
out and it looks like Jules fight

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 
against a friendly fire the little guy

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.810 
against a friendly fire the little guy
called<00:01:23.500> it<00:01:23.619> out<00:01:23.740> first<00:01:24.010> with<00:01:24.250> the<00:01:24.400> team<00:01:24.610> kill

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:24.820 
called it out first with the team kill

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:26.430 
called it out first with the team kill
that<00:01:24.940> was<00:01:25.090> going<00:01:25.210> to<00:01:25.270> go<00:01:25.390> down<00:01:25.630> up<00:01:25.900> front<00:01:25.930> and

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:26.440 
that was going to go down up front and

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.530 
that was going to go down up front and
early<00:01:27.250> on<00:01:27.400> they're<00:01:27.640> trying<00:01:27.940> to<00:01:27.970> get<00:01:28.060> a<00:01:28.119> move<00:01:28.330> in

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:28.540 
early on they're trying to get a move in

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.070 
early on they're trying to get a move in
here<00:01:28.869> I<00:01:30.300> think<00:01:31.300> that<00:01:31.509> was<00:01:31.660> that<00:01:31.690> was

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.080 
here I think that was that was

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:33.900 
here I think that was that was
devastating<00:01:32.410> right<00:01:32.950> there<00:01:33.160> so<00:01:33.369> probably

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:33.910 
devastating right there so probably

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:35.550 
devastating right there so probably
gonna<00:01:34.060> be<00:01:34.210> a<00:01:34.240> good<00:01:34.390> idea<00:01:34.509> if<00:01:34.720> they<00:01:35.020> get<00:01:35.200> out<00:01:35.350> of

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 
gonna be a good idea if they get out of

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:36.749 
gonna be a good idea if they get out of
the<00:01:35.680> vehicle<00:01:35.830> it's<00:01:36.369> going<00:01:36.400> to<00:01:36.550> be<00:01:36.610> in<00:01:36.670> their

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:36.759 
the vehicle it's going to be in their

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:38.760 
the vehicle it's going to be in their
best<00:01:36.790> interest<00:01:37.420> and<00:01:37.810> now<00:01:38.320> we're<00:01:38.470> gonna<00:01:38.560> switch

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
best interest and now we're gonna switch

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.980 
best interest and now we're gonna switch
to<00:01:38.890> the<00:01:38.979> pistol<00:01:39.369> we've<00:01:39.580> got<00:01:39.820> the<00:01:40.240> DMR<00:01:40.750> over
