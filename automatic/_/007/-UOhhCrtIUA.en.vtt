place

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:29.920 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.440 

on<00:00:30.920> the<00:00:31.220> wall<00:00:31.400> you<00:00:31.550> will<00:00:31.580> see<00:00:31.850> two<00:00:32.060> sets<00:00:32.330> of

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:32.450 
on the wall you will see two sets of

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:34.000 
on the wall you will see two sets of
triangles<00:00:32.990> for<00:00:33.230> the<00:00:33.260> first<00:00:33.530> step<00:00:33.800> of<00:00:33.920> this

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.010 
triangles for the first step of this

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:35.710 
triangles for the first step of this
upgrade<00:00:34.490> you<00:00:34.670> only<00:00:34.820> have<00:00:34.970> to<00:00:35.060> focus<00:00:35.270> on<00:00:35.630> the

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:35.720 
upgrade you only have to focus on the

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.660 
upgrade you only have to focus on the
lower<00:00:35.930> row<00:00:36.170> of<00:00:36.320> triangles<00:00:36.890> there<00:00:37.070> seven<00:00:37.550> of

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:37.670 
lower row of triangles there seven of

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:39.700 
lower row of triangles there seven of
them<00:00:37.790> this<00:00:38.210> part<00:00:38.510> is<00:00:38.570> easy<00:00:38.780> and<00:00:39.110> it's<00:00:39.260> the<00:00:39.440> same

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:39.710 
them this part is easy and it's the same

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:48.260 
them this part is easy and it's the same
every<00:00:40.160> time

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.730 

you

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:52.740 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.490 

first<00:00:53.640> you<00:00:53.790> have<00:00:53.910> to<00:00:54.030> shoot<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.360> triangle<00:00:54.810> 61

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
first you have to shoot the triangle 61

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.450 
first you have to shoot the triangle 61
and<00:00:55.710> three<00:00:56.130> in<00:00:56.310> that<00:00:56.670> order<00:00:57.260> 61<00:00:58.260> then<00:00:58.950> three

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
and three in that order 61 then three

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.580 
and three in that order 61 then three
they<00:01:00.180> will<00:01:00.360> radiate<00:01:00.720> with<00:01:00.960> lightning<00:01:01.380> for<00:01:01.560> a

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
they will radiate with lightning for a

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:11.280 
they will radiate with lightning for a
few<00:01:01.890> seconds

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:11.290 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.720 

see<00:01:11.890> this<00:01:12.130> was

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:15.730 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:18.240 

once<00:01:16.660> they<00:01:16.870> are<00:01:16.900> done<00:01:17.140> reading<00:01:17.380> you<00:01:18.010> have<00:01:18.070> to

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.250 
once they are done reading you have to

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.880 
once they are done reading you have to
shoot<00:01:18.430> triangles<00:01:19.000> three<00:01:19.390> five<00:01:19.840> and<00:01:20.080> seven<00:01:20.200> in

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:20.890 
shoot triangles three five and seven in

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:33.040 
shoot triangles three five and seven in
that<00:01:21.250> order

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:33.050 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:35.750 

once<00:01:34.050> those<00:01:34.260> triangles<00:01:34.650> are<00:01:34.890> done<00:01:35.070> radiating

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:35.760 
once those triangles are done radiating

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.149 
once those triangles are done radiating
it<00:01:35.909> to<00:01:36.030> shoot<00:01:36.270> triangles<00:01:36.810> for<00:01:37.080> six<00:01:37.409> and<00:01:37.620> two<00:01:37.860> in

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
it to shoot triangles for six and two in

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.310 
it to shoot triangles for six and two in
that<00:01:38.400> order<00:01:38.670> once<00:01:39.270> they<00:01:39.479> are<00:01:39.510> done<00:01:39.870> you<00:01:40.229> will

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
that order once they are done you will

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.469 
that order once they are done you will
get<00:01:40.470> an<00:01:40.590> audio<00:01:40.950> indication<00:01:41.940> that<00:01:42.060> it's<00:01:42.240> done

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
get an audio indication that it's done

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.450 
get an audio indication that it's done
and<00:01:42.540> done<00:01:43.020> correctly<00:01:43.530> it<00:01:43.800> should<00:01:43.830> sound<00:01:44.310> like

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
and done correctly it should sound like

00:01:44.460 --> 00:02:08.150 
and done correctly it should sound like
this

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.220 

the<00:02:09.160> second<00:02:09.610> part<00:02:09.759> of<00:02:09.849> the<00:02:10.030> stat<00:02:10.360> upgrade<00:02:10.989> you

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
the second part of the stat upgrade you

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.170 
the second part of the stat upgrade you
have<00:02:11.379> to<00:02:11.530> turn<00:02:11.709> seven<00:02:12.190> switches<00:02:12.700> around<00:02:12.819> the

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
have to turn seven switches around the

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.059 
have to turn seven switches around the
map<00:02:13.390> as<00:02:13.629> far<00:02:13.840> as<00:02:13.989> I<00:02:14.110> know<00:02:14.170> they<00:02:14.590> are<00:02:14.620> order

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069 
map as far as I know they are order

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:17.520 
map as far as I know they are order
specific<00:02:15.790> and<00:02:16.000> it<00:02:16.420> works<00:02:16.599> every<00:02:16.959> time<00:02:16.989> for<00:02:17.410> us

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
specific and it works every time for us

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.800 
specific and it works every time for us
so<00:02:17.830> I<00:02:18.010> would<00:02:18.220> just<00:02:18.370> follow<00:02:18.519> this<00:02:18.849> order<00:02:19.060> the

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
so I would just follow this order the

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.170 
so I would just follow this order the
first<00:02:20.080> switches<00:02:20.500> up<00:02:20.650> near<00:02:20.860> stamina<00:02:21.400> generator
