00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
literally when you do in our stuff that

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.600 
literally when you do in our stuff that
we're<00:00:30.750> dealing<00:00:30.960> with<00:00:31.140> thing<00:00:31.470> here<00:00:31.830> is<00:00:32.009> reality

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
we're dealing with thing here is reality

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.520 
we're dealing with thing here is reality
and<00:00:32.910> we<00:00:33.210> talk<00:00:33.450> to<00:00:33.570> you<00:00:33.630> that<00:00:33.750> way<00:00:33.780> each<00:00:34.170> thing

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
and we talk to you that way each thing

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.860 
and we talk to you that way each thing
we<00:00:34.680> use<00:00:34.920> is<00:00:35.190> a<00:00:35.219> lot<00:00:35.489> of<00:00:35.610> power<00:00:35.820> not<00:00:36.510> from<00:00:36.660> the

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
we use is a lot of power not from the

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.990 
we use is a lot of power not from the
hand<00:00:37.140> it<00:00:37.680> from<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.040> body<00:00:38.280> from<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:38.850> waist

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
hand it from the body from the waist

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.690 
hand it from the body from the waist
when<00:00:39.570> you<00:00:39.629> hit<00:00:39.780> them<00:00:39.930> so<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.070> idea<00:00:41.460> is<00:00:41.550> when

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
when you hit them so the idea is when

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.250 
when you hit them so the idea is when
you<00:00:41.730> practice<00:00:42.270> you<00:00:42.570> need<00:00:42.750> to<00:00:42.870> understand

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
you practice you need to understand

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.619 
you practice you need to understand
that's<00:00:43.829> why<00:00:44.129> when<00:00:44.700> you<00:00:44.820> coming<00:00:45.120> in<00:00:45.239> here<00:00:45.480> and

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.510 
that's why when you coming in here and
I'm<00:00:45.809> gonna<00:00:45.899> hit<00:00:46.170> that's<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:46.890> whole<00:00:47.039> idea<00:00:47.070> of

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
I'm gonna hit that's the whole idea of

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.029 
I'm gonna hit that's the whole idea of
XY's<00:00:47.760> in<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.570> wrong<00:00:48.809> line<00:00:49.140> I<00:00:49.379> thought<00:00:49.710> one<00:00:49.860> go

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
XY's in the wrong line I thought one go
