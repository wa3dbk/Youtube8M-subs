00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240
 all 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:22.070
 so in this tutorial I will show you 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.830
 how to get the car radio code 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:28.500
 on a Renault vehicle 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:32.789
 I put the contact 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:35.000
 jal a car radio and there we have the 

00:00:32.789 --> 00:00:37.230
 unpleasant surprise 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.570
 the car radio does not work we are 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.280
 asks for a code that is composed of 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.540
 4 digits 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.399
 so I will explain the 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.770
 procedure to recover its codes 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.170
 you'll see it's very simple it's 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.510
 manipulation that can be done in 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.219
 not even a quarter of an hour this quad 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.710
 car radio is required when 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.809
 disconnect the battery so the order 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.860
 below the battery change or 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.610
 during any repair for 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:05.000
 get this code 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:07.560
 so it must already at first 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.229
 removed the car radio then to remove 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.440
 the radio must be manufactured to have 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.780
 like this so with wire 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.979
 relatively resilient if I took 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.830
 brazing sticks hours but good this 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:22.070
 walk with wire 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:24.570
 so from him I made 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.760
 otherwise if you can not make that 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.670
 you can use four cloud but 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:31.140
 it's better to make that it will be 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.920
 more convenient to remove the car radio 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:40.530
 easier then then cu 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:49.700
 we will push them 1the like the one 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:49.700
 first the second here is wrong 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:02:03.630
 enter here it is not well entered saas 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:06.479
 bring a little bit in fact it's a 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:10.769
 kind of staples that are behind 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:15.989
 this is the party, it's better 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:19.170
 I put both one now I'm going 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:21.540
 take the 2nd and I want to push them 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.730
 outwardly while pulling 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:28.019
 the car radio to me so I push to 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:35.989
 to be pushing outside and I'm pulling towards 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:35.989
 me the car radio and there it comes alone 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:44.849
 when we push the u 

00:02:40.469 --> 00:02:47.239
 outside we have an action like 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:52.140
 that's his pair one of them eclipsed 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:54.329
 the car radio of his home 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:58.890
 so once we have removed the other 

00:02:54.329 --> 00:03:01.700
 radio we're going to look at the label that's going 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:04.500
 found on the side on this label 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.420
 there are several strings the number of 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.620
 production 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.760
 finally rather the product number one 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.920
 fashion models etc 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.920
 so what will interest us 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:17.629
 this is the four the letter and the 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:22.769
 three numbers that are just after tÃ©o 

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:31.470
 so I'm going to highlight it here so 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:35.370
 here we at theo 965 so it's 1,965 that he 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:37.500
 have to mark on a tripod then with 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:40.139
 this letter and these three figures 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:43.379
 you have to go back to the software 

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:46.560
 that you can download on the link 

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:48.590
 which I put in very descriptions so 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:52.260
 now we will go on the computer 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:55.260
 to type this letter and these three 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:59.159
 numbers to have the code now 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:01.319
 to unlock the car radio so once 

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:04.440
 that we noted this loan code we can 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:07.409
 put their radios back in place so we 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:09.599
 remove the u is 11 inches or simply 

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:12.720
 in his housing the car radio and 

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:15.599
 cut through alone then once you 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:17.099
 will have downloaded the application whose 

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:20.190
 link being description you go 

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:27.139
 get this the layer application so 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:30.690
 you double click on it we get that 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:32.699
 you're going to type it the pre code that you 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:36.139
 have noted on the label of 

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:42.780
 the car radio in the car so here at 

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:45.169
 965 you type input is here you have 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:49.080
 the car radio cone so that is displayed 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:52.409
 so here 14 89 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:54.990
 you copy them on a sheet next 

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:56.539
 you type q and you enter for 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:58.590
 exit the application 

00:04:56.539 --> 00:05:01.650
 So now we have the code 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:05.430
 car radio that we will go to bang on 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:08.370
 the car radio in the car then we 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:15.169
 here's back in the car so I 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:19.259
 put the touch like this I turn on 

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:21.780
 the car radio and there is no request code 

00:05:19.259 --> 00:05:23.069
 so the code we're going to type it from the 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:25.500
 following way so it's the same 

00:05:23.069 --> 00:05:29.490
 procedure on all car radios so 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:32.400
 I said it was 14 89 so the 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:36.629
 first digit it will be with the key 1 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:39.180
 we're going their rule is so 14 

00:05:36.629 --> 00:05:44.099
 this is the second digit it will be with 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:47.189
 the key 2 us at 14 the third 

00:05:44.099 --> 00:05:53.690
 logically so with the key 

00:05:47.189 --> 00:05:56.599
 3 14 89 the 4th with 4 4 

00:05:53.690 --> 00:06:07.110
 I have seen four times to make 4 

00:05:56.599 --> 00:06:10.440
 So here and 14.89 and so I was able 9 

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:12.569
 times to make new and to validate 

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:14.699
 either long press the key 5 

00:06:12.569 --> 00:06:16.500
 either on the key 6 so it depends on 

00:06:14.699 --> 00:06:27.110
 car radios so we try both 

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:27.110
 possibilities here was the key 6 

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:33.770
 here is the tutorial is over 

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:43.090
 you can now again 

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:45.950
 enjoy your car stereo 

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:50.720
 thank you do not hesitate to subscribe to the 

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:54.280
 chain and to secular and the video thanks and 

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:54.280
 see you soon for new togo 

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:57.970
 m 

00:07:04.639 --> 00:07:06.639
 and 

00:07:08.139 --> 00:07:10.199
