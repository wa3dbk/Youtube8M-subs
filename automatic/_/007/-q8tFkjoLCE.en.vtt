lighter these knives I think it's about
three<00:02:26.850> ounces<00:02:27.079> if<00:02:28.079> not<00:02:28.410> less<00:02:28.739> okay<00:02:29.430> and<00:02:30.470> it<00:02:31.470> is

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
three ounces if not less okay and it is

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:37.370 
three ounces if not less okay and it is
very<00:02:31.769> very<00:02:32.489> sharp<00:02:33.920> this<00:02:34.920> knife<00:02:35.220> is<00:02:36.380> basically

guys know how how it compares to these

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:32.210 
guys know how how it compares to these
two<00:04:29.139> of<00:04:29.260> them<00:04:29.470> for<00:04:30.000> me<00:04:31.000> Chris<00:04:31.570> reefs<00:04:31.840> are

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 
two of them for me Chris reefs are

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:37.580 
two of them for me Chris reefs are
sometimes<00:04:33.220> on<00:04:33.669> it's<00:04:33.970> a<00:04:34.960> cutter<00:04:35.350> this<00:04:36.160> is<00:04:36.370> a

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
sometimes on it's a cutter this is a

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:42.600 
sometimes on it's a cutter this is a
knife<00:04:38.590> that<00:04:39.539> you<00:04:40.539> use<00:04:40.750> to<00:04:40.780> cut<00:04:40.960> anything<00:04:41.710> okay

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:42.610 
knife that you use to cut anything okay

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:47.990 
knife that you use to cut anything okay
in<00:04:43.030> the<00:04:43.180> city<00:04:43.389> let's<00:04:43.630> say<00:04:43.810> and<00:04:45.030> the<00:04:46.030> sng<00:04:46.630> here

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000 
in the city let's say and the sng here

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.860 
in the city let's say and the sng here
for<00:04:49.000> me<00:04:49.150> it's<00:04:49.419> more<00:04:49.660> about<00:04:49.870> Peter<00:04:51.570> you<00:04:52.570> try<00:04:52.810> to

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:52.870 
for me it's more about Peter you try to

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:56.640 
for me it's more about Peter you try to
beat<00:04:53.199> it<00:04:53.320> down<00:04:54.600> you<00:04:55.600> can<00:04:55.750> take<00:04:55.990> it<00:04:56.020> to<00:04:56.229> a<00:04:56.260> camp

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:56.650 
beat it down you can take it to a camp

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:02.969 
beat it down you can take it to a camp
and<00:04:59.370> because<00:05:00.370> of<00:05:00.400> it<00:05:00.729> it's<00:05:01.449> a<00:05:01.780> thick<00:05:02.110> plate

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:02.979 
and because of it it's a thick plate

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:11.550 
and because of it it's a thick plate
stock<00:05:03.280> and<00:05:04.380> the<00:05:06.539> really<00:05:07.710> mean<00:05:09.419> robust<00:05:10.560> handle

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:11.560 
stock and the really mean robust handle

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:14.550 
stock and the really mean robust handle
design<00:05:11.889> a<00:05:11.919> print<00:05:12.250> of<00:05:12.370> design<00:05:12.870> it<00:05:13.870> will<00:05:14.020> take<00:05:14.260> a

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:14.560 
design a print of design it will take a

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:18.089 
design a print of design it will take a
little<00:05:14.919> bit<00:05:15.160> more<00:05:15.870> beating<00:05:16.870> before<00:05:17.590> he<00:05:17.919> gives

00:05:18.089 --> 00:05:18.099 
little bit more beating before he gives

00:05:18.099 --> 00:05:23.850 
little bit more beating before he gives
up

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:23.860 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:28.260 

one<00:05:24.490> Thomas<00:05:24.819> model<00:05:25.750> 2.5<00:05:26.349> I<00:05:26.680> think<00:05:27.099> lays<00:05:27.430> lies

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:28.270 
one Thomas model 2.5 I think lays lies

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:33.510 
one Thomas model 2.5 I think lays lies
in<00:05:28.810> between<00:05:30.330> it<00:05:31.330> cuts<00:05:31.659> but<00:05:32.530> it<00:05:32.710> doesn't<00:05:33.009> cut<00:05:33.219> as

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:33.520 
in between it cuts but it doesn't cut as

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:40.999 
in between it cuts but it doesn't cut as
good<00:05:34.449> as<00:05:36.180> Chris<00:05:37.180> Reeves<00:05:37.419> knives<00:05:38.759> but<00:05:39.759> it<00:05:40.000> cuts

00:05:40.999 --> 00:05:41.009 
good as Chris Reeves knives but it cuts

00:05:41.009 --> 00:05:43.980 
good as Chris Reeves knives but it cuts
for<00:05:42.009> my<00:05:42.280> experience<00:05:42.819> it<00:05:43.330> cuts<00:05:43.569> better<00:05:43.780> than

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:43.990 
for my experience it cuts better than

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:48.360 
for my experience it cuts better than
the<00:05:44.169> sng<00:05:45.060> because<00:05:46.060> of<00:05:46.210> the<00:05:46.389> blade<00:05:46.930> shape<00:05:47.370> okay

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:48.370 
the sng because of the blade shape okay

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:51.450 
the sng because of the blade shape okay
at<00:05:48.610> least<00:05:49.379> for<00:05:50.379> this<00:05:50.500> one's<00:05:50.800> this<00:05:51.280> is<00:05:51.430> a

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:51.460 
at least for this one's this is a

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:55.999 
at least for this one's this is a
three-quarter<00:05:52.740> grind<00:05:54.330> this<00:05:55.330> is<00:05:55.509> hollow<00:05:55.719> grind

00:05:55.999 --> 00:05:56.009 
three-quarter grind this is hollow grind

00:05:56.009 --> 00:06:01.379 
three-quarter grind this is hollow grind
this<00:05:57.009> is<00:05:57.189> she's<00:05:57.370> all<00:05:57.520> wined<00:05:59.340> and<00:06:00.340> this<00:06:01.060> will

00:06:01.379 --> 00:06:01.389 
this is she's all wined and this will

00:06:01.389 --> 00:06:10.700 
this is she's all wined and this will
last<00:06:01.599> longer<00:06:01.990> in<00:06:02.590> a<00:06:02.770> cutting<00:06:04.110> test<00:06:07.620> in<00:06:08.620> a<00:06:08.979> city

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:10.710 
last longer in a cutting test in a city

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:14.309 
last longer in a cutting test in a city
this<00:06:11.710> is<00:06:11.919> a<00:06:11.949> better<00:06:12.279> option<00:06:12.990> because<00:06:13.990> much

00:06:14.309 --> 00:06:14.319 
this is a better option because much

00:06:14.319 --> 00:06:18.450 
this is a better option because much
lighter<00:06:14.879> it's<00:06:15.879> almost<00:06:16.289> 2<00:06:17.289> ounces<00:06:17.770> or<00:06:17.979> probably

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:18.460 
lighter it's almost 2 ounces or probably

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:22.589 
lighter it's almost 2 ounces or probably

something<00:06:26.199> lighter<00:06:26.529> than<00:06:27.150> sng<00:06:28.169> okay<00:06:29.169> Oh<00:06:31.050> three

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:32.050 
something lighter than sng okay Oh three

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:35.939 
something lighter than sng okay Oh three
of<00:06:32.229> them<00:06:32.440> are<00:06:32.680> a<00:06:32.740> frame<00:06:33.279> lock<00:06:34.110> so<00:06:35.110> you'll

00:06:35.939 --> 00:06:35.949 
of them are a frame lock so you'll

00:06:35.949 --> 00:06:38.119 
of them are a frame lock so you'll
probably<00:06:36.219> feel<00:06:36.490> very<00:06:36.789> securely<00:06:37.270> in<00:06:37.539> the<00:06:37.569> hand

00:06:38.119 --> 00:06:38.129 
probably feel very securely in the hand

00:06:38.129 --> 00:06:44.610 
probably feel very securely in the hand
play<00:06:39.129> length<00:06:39.400> wise<00:06:40.529> this<00:06:41.529> is<00:06:41.740> I<00:06:42.219> think<00:06:43.620> 3.6

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:44.620 
play length wise this is I think 3.6

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:49.019 
play length wise this is I think 3.6
something<00:06:45.069> this<00:06:45.490> 3.5<00:06:46.240> exactly<00:06:47.229> and<00:06:47.500> it<00:06:48.099> is<00:06:48.250> 3.5

00:06:49.019 --> 00:06:49.029 
something this 3.5 exactly and it is 3.5

00:06:49.029 --> 00:06:53.380 
something this 3.5 exactly and it is 3.5
but

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:53.390 

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:56.950 

the<00:06:54.460> model<00:06:55.460> 2.5<00:06:56.000> has<00:06:56.240> a<00:06:56.270> little<00:06:56.570> bit<00:06:56.780> more

00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:56.960

cutting length than the sng so all in
all<00:07:01.850> I<00:07:02.210> think
