00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
for that also i'm very good at saying

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.000 
for that also i'm very good at saying
goes<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.600> single<00:01:12.930> table<00:01:13.080> tournament<00:01:13.650> so<00:01:13.860> they

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
have these small sitting goes that if

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.950 
have these small sitting goes that if
you<00:01:16.290> win<00:01:16.470> you<00:01:16.590> satellite<00:01:17.040> to<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.970> event<00:01:18.509> and<00:01:18.659> i

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
you win you satellite to the event and i

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.630 
you win you satellite to the event and i
will<00:01:19.170> be<00:01:19.200> probably<00:01:19.860> grinding<00:01:20.520> those

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
will be probably grinding those

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.740 
will be probably grinding those
depending<00:01:21.210> on<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.390> dynamics<00:01:21.960> there<00:01:22.229> um<00:01:22.439> a

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.750 
depending on the dynamics there um a

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.570 
depending on the dynamics there um a
couple<00:01:24.750> of<00:01:24.990> predictions<00:01:25.560> I'm<00:01:26.070> going<00:01:26.520> to

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
couple of predictions I'm going to

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.969 
couple of predictions I'm going to
predict<00:01:26.939> a<00:01:27.030> bracelet<00:01:27.570> by<00:01:27.869> Bryan<00:01:28.290> Oh<00:01:28.470> Donna<00:01:28.770> you

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
predict a bracelet by Bryan Oh Donna you

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.770 
predict a bracelet by Bryan Oh Donna you
or<00:01:29.280> Christopher<00:01:29.790> George<00:01:30.270> I'm<00:01:30.450> going<00:01:30.570> to<00:01:30.630> say

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
or Christopher George I'm going to say

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.330 
or Christopher George I'm going to say
that<00:01:30.960> now<00:01:31.110> so<00:01:31.380> if<00:01:31.500> they<00:01:31.650> win<00:01:31.860> I<00:01:31.890> can<00:01:32.130> like

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
that now so if they win I can like

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.210 
that now so if they win I can like
rewind<00:01:32.880> and<00:01:33.060> say<00:01:33.240> they're<00:01:33.600> too<00:01:33.840> two<00:01:34.740> friends

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
rewind and say they're too two friends

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.039 
rewind and say they're too two friends
two<00:01:35.430> very<00:01:35.700> good<00:01:35.759> players<00:01:36.150> Christopher<00:01:36.810> George

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
two very good players Christopher George

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.649 
two very good players Christopher George
is<00:01:37.259> a<00:01:37.290> really<00:01:38.220> good<00:01:38.400> mix<00:01:38.610> game<00:01:38.850> player<00:01:39.150> I<00:01:39.180> think
