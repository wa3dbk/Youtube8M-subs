00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
there's going to be just a little hole

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.650 
there's going to be just a little hole
there<00:00:22.650> with<00:00:23.490> a<00:00:23.519> little<00:00:23.699> cap<00:00:24.000> in<00:00:24.210> it<00:00:24.330> the

there with a little cap in it the

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.509 
there with a little cap in it the
irregular<00:00:25.260> pump<00:00:25.529> is<00:00:25.710> behind<00:00:25.949> this<00:00:26.130> metal

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
irregular pump is behind this metal

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:27.800 
irregular pump is behind this metal
shield<00:00:26.789> in<00:00:27.000> the<00:00:27.090> back<00:00:27.269> and<00:00:27.510> I'll<00:00:27.599> show<00:00:27.779> you

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
shield in the back and I'll show you

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.330 
shield in the back and I'll show you
that<00:00:27.869> two<00:00:28.170> seconds<00:00:28.529> it's<00:00:28.650> not<00:00:28.769> hard<00:00:28.980> to<00:00:29.070> get<00:00:29.189> to

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
that two seconds it's not hard to get to

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.659 
that two seconds it's not hard to get to
the<00:00:30.150> first<00:00:30.330> thing<00:00:30.480> you<00:00:30.570> do<00:00:30.689> is<00:00:30.840> I<00:00:31.070> pre<00:00:32.070> unhooked

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
the first thing you do is I pre unhooked

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:33.860 
the first thing you do is I pre unhooked
all<00:00:32.820> this<00:00:32.969> stuff<00:00:33.239> so<00:00:33.360> you<00:00:33.390> don't<00:00:33.570> have<00:00:33.690> to

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
all this stuff so you don't have to

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.470 
all this stuff so you don't have to
watch<00:00:34.079> me<00:00:34.579> undoing<00:00:35.579> bolts<00:00:35.880> and<00:00:36.030> everything<00:00:36.360> I

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
watch me undoing bolts and everything I

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.819 
watch me undoing bolts and everything I
just<00:00:36.510> figured<00:00:36.989> it'd<00:00:37.079> be<00:00:37.110> a<00:00:37.200> lot<00:00:37.350> easier<00:00:37.380> for

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
just figured it'd be a lot easier for

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.350 
just figured it'd be a lot easier for
you<00:00:37.950> so<00:00:39.230> unplug<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:40.700> washer<00:00:41.700> for<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.090> level

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
you so unplug the washer for the level

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.959 
you so unplug the washer for the level
sensor<00:00:42.719> then<00:00:43.590> there's<00:00:43.860> simply<00:00:44.430> one<00:00:44.670> ten

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
sensor then there's simply one ten

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.020 
sensor then there's simply one ten
millimeter<00:00:45.390> plastic<00:00:45.690> nut<00:00:46.170> on<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.559> top<00:00:47.030> right

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
millimeter plastic nut on the top right

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.430 
millimeter plastic nut on the top right
there<00:00:48.950> that<00:00:49.950> comes<00:00:50.219> off<00:00:50.989> and<00:00:51.989> I<00:00:52.079> could<00:00:52.260> take

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
there that comes off and I could take

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.020 
there that comes off and I could take
out<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.680> front<00:00:52.920> pump<00:00:53.190> first<00:00:53.460> if<00:00:53.699> you've<00:00:53.850> got

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
out the front pump first if you've got

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.549 
out the front pump first if you've got
to<00:00:54.149> take<00:00:54.329> out<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.539> front<00:00:54.660> pump<00:00:54.930> first<00:00:55.110> it's<00:00:55.379> a

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
to take out the front pump first it's a

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.619 
to take out the front pump first it's a
lot<00:00:55.710> easier<00:00:56.039> there's<00:00:56.730> a<00:00:56.850> electrical

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
lot easier there's a electrical

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.569 
lot easier there's a electrical
connector<00:00:58.020> with<00:00:58.140> connection<00:00:58.770> with<00:00:58.890> two<00:00:59.100> metal

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
connector with connection with two metal

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.539 
connector with connection with two metal
spring<00:00:59.940> clips<00:01:01.280> pushing<00:01:02.280> on<00:01:02.430> them<00:01:02.609> and

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:04.549 
spring clips pushing on them and

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:11.400 
spring clips pushing on them and
good<00:01:05.089> pass

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:11.410 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:14.190 

actually<00:01:12.010> I<00:01:12.040> pop<00:01:12.340> it<00:01:12.490> out<00:01:12.550> first<00:01:12.820> to<00:01:13.810> pop<00:01:14.020> out

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.200 
actually I pop it out first to pop out

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.390 
actually I pop it out first to pop out

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.280 
the front one rotate it forward pull up
and<00:02:59.410> that<00:03:00.370> is<00:03:00.580> it<00:03:01.150> there's<00:03:01.959> a<00:03:01.989> little<00:03:02.080> spring

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
and that is it there's a little spring

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.080 
and that is it there's a little spring
clip<00:03:02.560> for<00:03:02.890> the<00:03:03.010> little<00:03:03.459> clip<00:03:03.640> for<00:03:03.820> the<00:03:03.910> hose

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.920 
connector that's for the front phone and
that<00:03:08.890> is<00:03:09.100> it<00:03:09.310> so<00:03:10.000> your<00:03:10.090> front<00:03:10.269> pump<00:03:10.540> goes<00:03:10.720> in

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
that is it so your front pump goes in

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:12.479 
that is it so your front pump goes in
there<00:03:11.140> pushes<00:03:11.500> down<00:03:11.650> in<00:03:11.830> that<00:03:11.950> little<00:03:12.130> grommet

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:12.489 
there pushes down in that little grommet

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:15.600 
there pushes down in that little grommet
on<00:03:12.580> the<00:03:12.640> bottle<00:03:13.590> and<00:03:14.590> that<00:03:15.130> is<00:03:15.310> where<00:03:15.489> the

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:15.610 
on the bottle and that is where the

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:17.030 
on the bottle and that is where the
headlight<00:03:16.180> window<00:03:16.510> is<00:03:16.570> too

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
headlight window is too

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.580 
headlight window is too
and<00:03:17.220> that's<00:03:17.730> basically<00:03:18.000> about<00:03:18.420> it<00:03:18.599> thanks<00:03:19.530> for
