00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.840
 looks nice that they are all back as a slight delay of the flood 

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.789
 still on gauge so the weather is there 

00:00:11.789 --> 00:00:15.229
 Percent should earn the playful 

00:00:15.229 --> 00:00:18.229
 Criteria a good selection 

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:21.329
 we got together for is 

00:00:21.329 --> 00:00:26.009
 Press meeting before an away game at Hannover 96 Ahmann Samsung Fuchs only 

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:26.759
 30 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:28.099
 we will be there 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:31.869
 2000 FCK windows in Essen accompany this is the so-called pull here 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:33.160
 have sold 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.070
 We assume who about two and a half thousand, according to Rainer Ali dere 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:38.520
 to have 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.070
 then the next home game against HSV stood now a 40 000 it aims 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.340
 then play the last in Frankfurt 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:47.760
 that we are reserved off but 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.640
 It is almost daily free reservation that is if I FCK Offense 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.620
 If you want to do a favor then you could announce that you regularly one 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.280
 Online shop customers are supposed to be there are definitely active tickets 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.330
 available 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.840
 and some reservations have already expired 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.870
 as the home game Freiburg was now 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.820
 33 breaks can be sold 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:06.710
 referee 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:08.300
 on Saturday against 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.480
 Hannover like Felix be two 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:11.790
 now he tells 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.680
 his lead of CFC home against Frankfurt the result is appalling 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.450
 back due to his yellow card suspension 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.020
 Love to say is the mood for the weather with the knowledge that where it is 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.610
 was so cold earlier 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.300
 get nominated to the players 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.300
 The case should be the mood within the nature of the team is good 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:34.830
 around 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:37.900
 teroddes I believe or GGG lead 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.800
 but now has done us quite well 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.450
 Percent the goal or equalizer 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.729
 But Perthes had so far released powers and a bit 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:48.729
 Confidence given for the upcoming tasks 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.830
 come and call now 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:54.820
 that does not really remember a research gap 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:55.759
 run to it 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:58.759
 and still had won 1 0 because we now with 7 8 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.900
 we had to give and you quietly believe that tourists can be in Egypt 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.920
 or when we come to Minden 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:07.770
 around 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:08.780
 in principle 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.000
 Less of a businessman - play from the last round then when you get to the 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.969
 Analyze and sometimes the games 

00:02:14.969 --> 00:02:19.329
 Verdi's opponent recently Cathert because she then Ventelo otherwise 

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:22.329
 Staff but another exhibition games 

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:25.359
 clearly what was annoying at the time 

00:02:25.359 --> 00:02:28.579
 dpa at that time was more in it but they did well 

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:30.799
 and I believe that at home 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:34.439
 is normal that the home game will occur differently 

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:36.439
 like here at the away game 

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:38.159
 We usually do that too 

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:41.019
 NBA the games good union 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:42.799
 who with the services 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:45.799
 I think the players off right 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:48.139
 it was clear that the sun was on the horizon 

00:02:48.139 --> 00:02:49.439
 that the German over 

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:52.539
 gorgeous and Saab the games compact the 

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:54.439
 Players just rest 

00:02:54.439 --> 00:02:57.759
 the sprinter success you 

00:02:57.759 --> 00:03:00.979
 so that Daum could do a little running 

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:02.789
 and 2 

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:05.419
 I've pillaged me mom I know that once 

00:03:05.419 --> 00:03:07.319
 explain yes we have 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:11.219
 Percent gave the situation or opponent directed a player off the field 

00:03:11.219 --> 00:03:12.120
 has been 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.249
 What convinced me it is already over a backlog 

00:03:15.249 --> 00:03:18.489
 if it is logical for me to switch to relatively new oven IV 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:20.679
 and around 

00:03:20.679 --> 00:03:23.769
 of course he was at the time he was playing 

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:28.370
 has offered itself through its power to grow again that is 

00:03:28.369 --> 00:03:31.289
 no matter how long in the field he has not had a good day 

00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:32.789
 also the stupid 

00:03:32.789 --> 00:03:36.029
 MÃ¼nz might come up with the first question. "Sperber" We have that 

00:03:36.029 --> 00:03:38.899
 Percent expects clearly addressed with the player 

00:03:38.899 --> 00:03:41.899
 but a x- and I said that also percent 

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:45.819
 it is also based on the reaction of the player it is nothing 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:48.819
 sang mourning and dealt with the Essenes 

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:51.899
 the players the every training session 

00:03:51.899 --> 00:03:53.679
 at every player 

00:03:53.679 --> 00:03:57.609
 in order for that to show the situation 

00:03:57.609 --> 00:03:59.299
 and from Trier 

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:03.499
 Systems ticked off for me and I then judge Natalies forums 

00:04:03.499 --> 00:04:04.509
 then too 

00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:07.919
 as I fill the squad so because of 

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:09.589
 this fact 

00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:12.919
 Maybe to finish saying a player is not demonized with me 

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:16.729
 Power you have to know so without toys 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.720
 and with us there are many hardships that partly after a performance on 10 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.639
 Had used weeks before 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:28.099
 because you have to betrayed piece far well present yes and 

00:04:29.189 --> 00:04:31.569
 that's it, too 

00:04:31.569 --> 00:04:33.289
 there too 

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:37.369
 to take account of the player also responsible for a squad 

00:04:37.369 --> 00:04:39.229
 Place was taken by Dr 

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:41.479
 been chosen 

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:44.469
 and percent coaches respond to the performance 

00:04:44.469 --> 00:04:46.990
 Emily the Witcher pays 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:49.300
 the first time 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:50.509
 trained again 

00:04:50.509 --> 00:04:51.909
 around 

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:55.059
 we left out in the EXR but still around 

00:04:55.059 --> 00:04:57.139
 Sbisa has 19 

00:04:57.139 --> 00:05:00.479
 he does on the inner band that is still so far 

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:02.159
 orderly 

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:03.889
 I think that will become one 

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:07.080
 only a bit of land because feel but it is important that it is true 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:10.300
 the knee and Neuenstadt - that's just it 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:13.699
 a small heater and fail Murcia Hofburg 

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:15.889
 due to illness 

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:18.889
 otherwise percent so far gives back in the squad 

00:05:20.969 --> 00:05:22.719
 Yates 

00:05:22.719 --> 00:05:27.079
 especially since i fit the personal details no one sits doubtful% shortly 

00:05:27.079 --> 00:05:29.439
 Amri could not train because of today 

00:05:29.439 --> 00:05:32.649
 Arvato Mobile will have to wait for tomorrow 

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.639
 smallest area is 

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:40.110
 but we think about listening to imports make Hannover 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:43.129
 "That's still considering it clean 

00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:47.059
 Machnig worse when it's good in Carroll for the crew 

00:05:47.059 --> 00:05:50.059
 for the prevention of board

 Mr. Rechtsschutz sales success calculator 

00:05:54.819 --> 00:05:57.819
 rushing festivals set before 

00:05:58.639 --> 00:05:59.860
 one is hopped the ice 

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:03.080
 We hope that you make class play that you have to but already worth it and then 

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.249
 hammer 

00:06:05.249 --> 00:06:08.249
 additional customers day later 

00:06:10.439 --> 00:06:12.610
 to celebrate this detention on yourself
