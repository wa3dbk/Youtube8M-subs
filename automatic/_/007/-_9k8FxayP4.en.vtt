from<00:00:36.660> watching<00:00:36.989> other<00:00:37.140> servers<00:00:37.590> and<00:00:37.739> I

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
from watching other servers and I

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.080 
from watching other servers and I
realized<00:00:38.250> that<00:00:38.399> I<00:00:38.489> didn't<00:00:38.820> see<00:00:38.969> them

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
realized that I didn't see them

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.819 
realized that I didn't see them
happening<00:00:39.629> as<00:00:39.780> much<00:00:39.989> when<00:00:40.200> I<00:00:40.230> went<00:00:40.500> out<00:00:40.620> to<00:00:40.770> eat

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
happening as much when I went out to eat

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.130 
happening as much when I went out to eat
there's<00:00:41.670> not<00:00:41.820> a<00:00:41.850> lot<00:00:42.030> of<00:00:42.059> mentorship<00:00:42.600> around

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
there's not a lot of mentorship around

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.569 
there's not a lot of mentorship around
anymore<00:00:43.559> and<00:00:43.649> there's<00:00:43.770> not<00:00:43.890> a<00:00:43.950> lot<00:00:44.010> of<00:00:44.160> people

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
anymore and there's not a lot of people

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.670 
anymore and there's not a lot of people
teaching<00:00:44.910> these<00:00:45.239> advanced<00:00:45.570> skills<00:00:45.960> and<00:00:46.469> so<00:00:46.649> I

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
teaching these advanced skills and so I

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.590 
teaching these advanced skills and so I
decided<00:00:46.890> that<00:00:47.340> since<00:00:47.940> I<00:00:48.120> had<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.420> experience

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
decided that since I had the experience

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.479 
decided that since I had the experience
I<00:00:48.870> might<00:00:49.020> as<00:00:49.140> well<00:00:49.230> be<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.500> person<00:00:49.800> who<00:00:49.890> kind

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
I might as well be the person who kind

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:51.500
