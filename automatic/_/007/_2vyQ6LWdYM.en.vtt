00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:13.449
 shortly before 

00:02:15.909 --> 00:02:20.559
 for 100 euros the same for the hour 

00:02:23.999 --> 00:02:24.909

 when love gets involved m there 

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:38.009
 what 

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:39.479
 as for her 

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:42.479
 yes the challenge 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:45.709
 one of them 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:47.569
 the world 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:50.949
 my 

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:53.949
 according to him 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:59.599
 as 

00:03:02.419 --> 00:03:04.449
 still 

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:07.339
 like but for m 

00:03:07.339 --> 00:03:11.499
 what 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:18.310
 percent 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:20.399
 the 

00:03:20.399 --> 00:03:24.149
 in e 1% what does it matter 

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:49.429
 there is a good day 

00:03:49.429 --> 00:03:52.489
 it's still me we have left the charm of a resort you have to come 

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:55.589
 in a more secret way 

00:03:55.589 --> 00:03:58.719
 this pretty piece of jean-marie raymond secret chandler 

00:03:58.719 --> 00:04:02.310
 on which I would like to say a few words show some aspects 

00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:04.269
 some techniques 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:07.529
 this musical style also said to speak in general about django music 

00:04:07.529 --> 00:04:09.739
 but it was missing that a victim 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:12.479
 particularly cyclical touch 

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:15.309
 music I find colorful% 

00:04:15.309 --> 00:04:18.309
 more than 5% 

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:23.189
 by analogy this curative approach 18 local music 

00:04:23.189 --> 00:04:25.520
 just like the recycling activity 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.550
 these nobles and at once tied themselves to the earth to the territories of the costs 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.550
 more if he has a very special flavor 

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:36.889
 species of intrinsic quality so that 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:39.889
 here I am I love this music 

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:46.199
 in a general way on the bridge when interpreting a piece I think 

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:49.439
 not that it is alone in this case I come to see 

00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:52.930
 a general idea about the taboo issue in the atmosphere 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:54.139
 the environment 

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:57.230
 it can be hard because it's a sad piece 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:01.160
 nostalgic where these did not subside descriptive ocassion 

00:05:03.569 --> 00:05:04.800
 I try to 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.740
 centuries ago 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:10.030
 put it a little bit my affinity with the composer of course that this 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:13.030
 is extremely subjective when you do not know the track composer 

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:16.650
 we can very well think something is that I was able to collect 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:19.249
 and for everything in his head 

00:05:19.249 --> 00:05:22.150
 but it's a little the music teacher of traveling 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:26.320
 in time space and above all more important traveling race for his own 

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:29.009
 his own imagination 

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:30.830
 those having evening 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:33.210
 port-au-prince didier picot 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:35.809
 and so me this piece 

00:05:35.809 --> 00:05:39.099
 judging I started to study I thought that enough 

00:05:39.599 --> 00:05:41.659
 a piece is still a half in the foot 

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:43.599
 What's more, happy mingling 

00:05:43.599 --> 00:05:46.599
 in it there is worse demand for tenderness 

00:05:47.629 --> 00:05:51.749
 sisi six devices so it's someone who seems to tell us La Liga and his friends 

00:05:51.749 --> 00:05:54.819
 I am happy although the water team in life 

00:05:54.819 --> 00:05:58.110
 and here I am going to share you I wanted to shout out 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:00.889
 it was not saying it with words but I wanted to scream with notes of 

00:06:00.889 --> 00:06:02.330
 music 

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:04.610
 that's what I feel this question 

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:07.159
 an interpreter after his loss not to try 

00:06:07.159 --> 00:06:09.849
 it must transmit 

00:06:09.849 --> 00:06:13.740
 what we feel since the butÃ´ anyway is to share the music does not 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:17.139
 conceives that in sharing 

00:06:17.139 --> 00:06:20.659
 supposedly with sharing others sharing emotions feelings 

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:25.400
 simply fun to play 

00:06:27.509 --> 00:06:30.439
 in a room that is not anything for simon very easy to play including 

00:06:30.439 --> 00:06:32.830
 in its second part 

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:36.189
 he was born here and he thinks that interesting to study 

00:06:36.189 --> 00:06:40.120
 he in his eyes unibail in singles in his design it's pretty original as 

00:06:40.119 --> 00:06:42.710
 writing 

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:51.680
 let's start with a little more talent for 100% the ride 

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:57.020
 so as I said just now 

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:00.900
 the British musician here I live here 

00:07:02.849 --> 00:07:04.919
 in this music we frequently find 

00:07:04.919 --> 00:07:07.039
 chromaticisms 

00:07:07.039 --> 00:07:10.169
 these traumas are rarely on the main melodic line 

00:07:10.169 --> 00:07:13.270
 they are often surprised at his intermediary 

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:16.319
 % and its interpreters including political what is to get them out 

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:20.110
 they gave themselves this dedication 

00:07:21.219 --> 00:07:23.969
 the room we place what's going on 

00:07:23.969 --> 00:07:26.520
 here his fourth world title 

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:28.839
 many chromatic passages 

00:07:28.839 --> 00:07:31.959
 which is often used to drive monique often serves two breaks of 

00:07:31.959 --> 00:07:34.849
 harmonic transmission 

00:07:34.849 --> 00:07:37.119
 and who are a little drowned in the accompaniment 

00:07:37.119 --> 00:07:40.300
 so we'll have to get them out 

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:43.020
 working on the kicking of the left is of course especially at this 

00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:44.240
 moment on forehand
