00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
has a good side and a bad side to it so

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.200 
has a good side and a bad side to it so
think<00:00:46.770> about<00:00:46.980> as<00:00:47.160> this<00:00:47.370> is<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.700> good<00:00:47.850> side<00:00:48.059> to

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
think about as this is the good side to

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.180 
think about as this is the good side to
your<00:00:48.329> body<00:00:48.510> I'm<00:00:48.840> definitely<00:00:49.559> into<00:00:49.920> living

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
your body I'm definitely into living

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.430 
your body I'm definitely into living
healthy<00:00:50.550> yeah<00:00:50.820> and<00:00:51.059> I'm<00:00:51.510> definitely<00:00:51.780> into

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
healthy yeah and I'm definitely into

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.100

doing<00:00:52.620> everything<00:00:52.829> that's<00:00:53.010> good<00:00:53.370> for<00:00:53.640> me<00:00:53.820> so<00:00:54.690> I

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
doing everything that's good for me so I

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.540 
doing everything that's good for me so I
think<00:00:55.170> this<00:00:55.559> is<00:00:55.710> one<00:00:55.860> of<00:00:55.890> those<00:00:56.039> things<00:00:56.399> the

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
think this is one of those things the

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:57.860

Equality<00:00:56.940> is<00:00:57.000> one<00:00:57.149> of<00:00:57.270> those<00:00:57.390> things<00:00:57.690> that's

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
Equality is one of those things that's

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.779 
Equality is one of those things that's
really<00:00:58.109> really<00:00:58.440> good<00:00:58.620> for<00:00:58.770> you<00:00:58.890> so<00:00:59.100> have<00:00:59.640> it

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:50.490 
world today was that one of the things

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:51.920 
world today was that one of the things
that<00:02:50.670> drew<00:02:50.820> you<00:02:51.000> to<00:02:51.030> this<00:02:51.360> film<00:02:51.660> you<00:02:51.810> know<00:02:51.900> I

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
that drew you to this film you know I

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.870

think<00:02:52.110> what<00:02:52.410> automatically<00:02:53.250> just<00:02:53.459> drew<00:02:53.640> me<00:02:53.670> to

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
think what automatically just drew me to

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.520 
think what automatically just drew me to
film<00:02:54.180> was<00:02:54.420> the<00:02:54.630> fact<00:02:54.959> that<00:02:55.080> it<00:02:55.290> was<00:02:55.380> so

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
film was the fact that it was so

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:56.870 
film was the fact that it was so
different<00:02:55.560> from<00:02:56.010> whatever<00:02:56.190> Karan<00:02:56.580> has<00:02:56.700> done

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
different from whatever Karan has done

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.970 
different from whatever Karan has done
so<00:02:57.060> far<00:02:57.270> yeah<00:02:57.540> I<00:02:57.810> think<00:02:57.959> that<00:02:58.230> was<00:02:58.470> it<00:02:58.620> it<00:02:58.830> was

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
so far yeah I think that was it it was

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.500 
so far yeah I think that was it it was
just<00:02:59.010> so<00:02:59.370> different<00:02:59.640> and<00:02:59.940> I<00:03:00.030> was<00:03:00.150> like<00:03:00.300> done

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
just so different and I was like done

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:01.640
