00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:58.010 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:01.040 

the<00:04:59.010> base<00:04:59.280> is<00:04:59.310> really<00:05:00.150> really<00:05:00.360> really<00:05:00.690> very

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:01.050 
the base is really really really very

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:06.290 
the base is really really really very
very<00:05:01.350> good<00:05:01.580> impressive<00:05:02.660> so<00:05:03.660> um<00:05:04.880> 120<00:05:05.880> bucks<00:05:06.120> I

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:09.870 
think the selling price on beats it's

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:14.450 
think the selling price on beats it's
around<00:05:10.710> 150<00:05:11.430> or<00:05:11.780> and<00:05:12.780> 40<00:05:13.110> I<00:05:13.139> don't<00:05:13.440> know<00:05:13.590> which
