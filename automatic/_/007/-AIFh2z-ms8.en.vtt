00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
into my little meter there now this is

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.260 
into my little meter there now this is
useful<00:02:16.900> because<00:02:17.410> this<00:02:17.890> little<00:02:17.980> meter<00:02:18.310> allows

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
useful because this little meter allows

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.390 
useful because this little meter allows
me<00:02:19.510> to<00:02:19.630> tap<00:02:19.810> and<00:02:19.990> hold<00:02:20.140> on<00:02:20.470> this<00:02:20.770> these<00:02:21.370> are

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
me to tap and hold on this these are

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.390 
me to tap and hold on this these are
like<00:02:21.760> my<00:02:21.940> spells<00:02:22.330> effectively<00:02:23.170> and<00:02:23.380> it<00:02:23.980> slows

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
like my spells effectively and it slows

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.860 
like my spells effectively and it slows
time<00:02:24.670> down<00:02:24.850> a<00:02:24.880> little<00:02:25.060> bit<00:02:25.240> and<00:02:25.420> then<00:02:25.480> I<00:02:25.690> can

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
time down a little bit and then I can

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.940 
time down a little bit and then I can
say<00:02:26.020> right<00:02:26.200> fire<00:02:26.530> it<00:02:26.560> there<00:02:26.860> boom<00:02:27.520> and<00:02:28.950> it

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
say right fire it there boom and it

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.350 
say right fire it there boom and it
builds<00:02:30.340> up<00:02:30.460> every<00:02:30.730> single<00:02:31.000> time<00:02:31.180> I'm

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
builds up every single time I'm

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.030 
builds up every single time I'm
destroying<00:02:31.750> these<00:02:31.990> buildings<00:02:32.470> and<00:02:32.650> so<00:02:32.800> forth

some point now let's go back to our home
and<00:03:59.340> you<00:04:00.340> know<00:04:00.430> very<00:04:00.640> quick<00:04:01.120> load<00:04:01.300> times

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:01.630 
and you know very quick load times

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:03.090 
and you know very quick load times
throughout<00:04:02.050> all<00:04:02.230> of<00:04:02.260> this<00:04:02.350> i<00:04:02.620> think<00:04:02.860> that

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:03.100 
throughout all of this i think that

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:04.680 
throughout all of this i think that
these<00:04:03.220> kinds<00:04:03.790> of<00:04:03.850> strategy<00:04:04.180> management<00:04:04.420> games

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:04.690 
these kinds of strategy management games

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:06.990 
these kinds of strategy management games
they<00:04:04.900> need<00:04:05.170> that<00:04:05.410> kind<00:04:05.590> of<00:04:05.740> fast<00:04:06.459> load<00:04:06.760> times

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.000 
they need that kind of fast load times

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.130 
they need that kind of fast load times
even<00:04:07.150> though<00:04:07.390> it<00:04:07.510> is<00:04:07.570> quite<00:04:07.900> a<00:04:07.930> handsome

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:08.140 
even though it is quite a handsome

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:13.010 
even though it is quite a handsome
looking<00:04:08.500> game<00:04:09.450> let's<00:04:10.450> claim<00:04:10.780> that<00:04:11.050> ok<00:04:11.920> and

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:13.020 
looking game let's claim that ok and

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:18.599 
looking game let's claim that ok and
exit<00:04:14.020> of<00:04:14.500> that<00:04:14.680> there<00:04:15.010> we<00:04:15.100> are<00:04:15.250> and<00:04:17.549> so<00:04:18.549> you

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:24.970 
faster or i can just go straight back

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:26.070 
faster or i can just go straight back
into<00:04:25.150> battle

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080 
into battle

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:27.270 
into battle
now<00:04:26.259> you<00:04:26.349> might<00:04:26.470> be<00:04:26.560> thinking<00:04:26.590> well<00:04:26.830> hold<00:04:27.159> on<00:04:27.250> a

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 
now you might be thinking well hold on a

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:28.529 
now you might be thinking well hold on a
second<00:04:27.580> you<00:04:27.639> don't<00:04:27.759> have<00:04:27.909> any<00:04:28.030> troops<00:04:28.330> left

00:04:28.529 --> 00:04:28.539 
second you don't have any troops left

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:30.029

00:04:30.029 --> 00:04:30.039 
because most of them got completely

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:31.649 
because most of them got completely
decimated<00:04:30.490> by<00:04:30.580> that<00:04:30.819> absolutely<00:04:31.330> terrible

00:04:31.649 --> 00:04:31.659

you're absolutely right they did get

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:39.330 
you're absolutely right they did get
absolutely<00:04:37.360> destroyed<00:04:37.870> but<00:04:38.680> now<00:04:39.129> they're

absolutely destroyed but now they're

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.999 
absolutely destroyed but now they're
immediately<00:04:39.639> back<00:04:40.060> that<00:04:40.750> is<00:04:41.139> hell<00:04:41.620> rival

00:04:41.999 --> 00:04:42.009 
immediately back that is hell rival

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:43.890 
immediately back that is hell rival
kingdoms<00:04:42.219> is<00:04:42.610> really<00:04:43.180> distinguishing<00:04:43.780> itself

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:43.900

00:04:55.589 --> 00:04:55.599 
different stuff because you have

00:04:55.599 --> 00:04:56.999 
different stuff because you have
essentially<00:04:56.020> portals<00:04:56.439> you<00:04:56.560> don't<00:04:56.710> train

00:04:56.999 --> 00:04:57.009 
essentially portals you don't train

essentially portals you don't train
troops<00:04:57.310> they<00:04:57.550> kind<00:04:57.729> of<00:04:57.759> just<00:04:57.819> come<00:04:58.210> through

troops they kind of just come through
this<00:04:58.599> portal<00:04:59.050> thing<00:04:59.370> so<00:05:00.370> let's<00:05:00.520> bring<00:05:00.699> these

00:05:00.869 --> 00:05:00.879 
this portal thing so let's bring these

this portal thing so let's bring these
in<00:05:01.560> I'm<00:05:02.560> going<00:05:02.680> to<00:05:02.740> bring<00:05:02.860> all<00:05:03.039> of<00:05:03.069> my<00:05:03.310> units

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:05.800 
into one spice mill and then hopefully

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.619 
into one spice mill and then hopefully
will<00:05:05.949> destroy<00:05:06.280> that<00:05:06.460> and<00:05:06.610> I'll<00:05:06.669> show<00:05:06.909> you<00:05:06.940> what

some of this other magic looks like

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:14.969 
some of this other magic looks like
hopefully<00:05:12.240> it's<00:05:13.240> building<00:05:13.599> up<00:05:13.690> it's<00:05:14.620> building

much<00:05:36.009> faster<00:05:36.250> in<00:05:36.550> rival<00:05:36.849> kingdoms<00:05:37.060> and<00:05:37.419> I

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:38.050 
much faster in rival kingdoms and I

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:40.170 
much faster in rival kingdoms and I
think<00:05:38.620> if<00:05:38.740> you<00:05:38.889> really<00:05:39.699> feel<00:05:39.819> the<00:05:39.969> sort<00:05:40.150> of

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:40.180 
think if you really feel the sort of

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:42.600 
think if you really feel the sort of
person<00:05:40.300> who's<00:05:40.569> like<00:05:40.750> pvp<00:05:41.469> is<00:05:41.800> absolutely

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:42.610 
person who's like pvp is absolutely

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:44.730 
person who's like pvp is absolutely
everything<00:05:42.969> about<00:05:43.389> what<00:05:43.629> I'm<00:05:43.779> about<00:05:43.900> then

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:44.740 
everything about what I'm about then

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:47.700 
everything about what I'm about then
there<00:05:45.520> we<00:05:45.610> go<00:05:45.729> oh<00:05:45.940> won't<00:05:46.810> that<00:05:46.930> blow<00:05:47.139> up<00:05:47.319> a<00:05:47.469> very

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:47.710 
there we go oh won't that blow up a very

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:51.089 
there we go oh won't that blow up a very
small<00:05:47.949> thing<00:05:48.430> brilliant<00:05:48.909> I<00:05:49.379> think<00:05:50.379> that<00:05:50.529> rival

00:05:51.089 --> 00:05:51.099 
small thing brilliant I think that rival

00:05:51.099 --> 00:05:53.369 
small thing brilliant I think that rival
kingdoms<00:05:51.250> is<00:05:51.550> is<00:05:51.729> is<00:05:52.150> going<00:05:52.449> to<00:05:52.509> scratch<00:05:53.199> an

00:05:53.369 --> 00:05:53.379 
kingdoms is is is going to scratch an

00:05:53.379 --> 00:05:54.839 
kingdoms is is is going to scratch an
itch<00:05:53.469> for<00:05:53.529> you<00:05:53.919> you<00:05:54.190> know<00:05:54.279> it's<00:05:54.460> much<00:05:54.669> more

00:05:54.839 --> 00:05:54.849 
itch for you you know it's much more

00:05:54.849 --> 00:05:56.159 
itch for you you know it's much more
immediate<00:05:55.060> smutch<00:05:55.479> quicker<00:05:55.750> you<00:05:55.870> can<00:05:55.930> just

00:05:56.159 --> 00:05:56.169 
immediate smutch quicker you can just

00:05:56.169 --> 00:05:57.600 
immediate smutch quicker you can just
keep<00:05:56.319> playing<00:05:56.680> the<00:05:57.099> only<00:05:57.250> thing<00:05:57.370> you<00:05:57.460> really

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:57.610 
keep playing the only thing you really

00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:59.820 
keep playing the only thing you really
need<00:05:57.789> to<00:05:58.089> be<00:05:58.180> waiting<00:05:58.539> for<00:05:58.779> is<00:05:58.990> your<00:05:59.440> buildings

00:05:59.820 --> 00:05:59.830 
need to be waiting for is your buildings

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:02.309 
need to be waiting for is your buildings
to<00:05:59.979> upgrade<00:06:00.659> so<00:06:01.659> I<00:06:01.690> think<00:06:01.779> that's<00:06:02.110> kind<00:06:02.289> of

00:06:02.309 --> 00:06:02.319 
to upgrade so I think that's kind of

00:06:02.319 --> 00:06:04.980 
to upgrade so I think that's kind of
neat<00:06:02.500> so<00:06:03.159> that<00:06:03.550> is<00:06:03.759> rival<00:06:04.150> kingdoms<00:06:04.360> age<00:06:04.719> of

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:04.990 
neat so that is rival kingdoms age of

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:07.350 
neat so that is rival kingdoms age of
ruin<00:06:05.259> it's<00:06:05.440> in<00:06:05.620> soft<00:06:06.009> launch<00:06:06.250> it<00:06:06.580> is<00:06:07.029> from

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:07.360 
ruin it's in soft launch it is from

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:11.519 
ruin it's in soft launch it is from
space<00:06:07.750> ape<00:06:08.080> games<00:06:08.529> and<00:06:09.060> I<00:06:10.080> think<00:06:11.080> that<00:06:11.289> it's

00:06:11.519 --> 00:06:11.529 
space ape games and I think that it's

00:06:11.529 --> 00:06:13.920 
space ape games and I think that it's
got<00:06:11.740> a<00:06:11.770> chance<00:06:12.069> it's<00:06:12.370> got<00:06:12.520> a<00:06:12.550> real<00:06:12.729> chance<00:06:12.969> when

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:13.930 
got a chance it's got a real chance when

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:17.519 
got a chance it's got a real chance when
it<00:06:14.229> comes<00:06:15.009> out<00:06:15.190> in<00:06:15.849> global<00:06:16.599> launch<00:06:16.960> at<00:06:17.289> some

00:06:17.519 --> 00:06:17.529 
it comes out in global launch at some

00:06:17.529 --> 00:06:19.469 
it comes out in global launch at some
point<00:06:17.800> probably<00:06:17.949> in<00:06:18.279> 2015<00:06:18.819> I<00:06:18.909> should<00:06:19.150> hope<00:06:19.240> so

00:06:19.469 --> 00:06:19.479 
point probably in 2015 I should hope so

00:06:19.479 --> 00:06:21.829 
point probably in 2015 I should hope so
should<00:06:19.960> hope<00:06:20.110> in<00:06:20.319> 20<00:06:20.529> 15<00:06:20.589> or<00:06:20.949> more<00:06:21.250> rings
