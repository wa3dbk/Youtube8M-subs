information the universal laws of nature
and<00:00:22.830> how<00:00:22.920> they<00:00:23.100> apply<00:00:23.250> to<00:00:23.490> life<00:00:24.050> let's<00:00:25.050> talk

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
and how they apply to life let's talk

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.290 
and how they apply to life let's talk
the<00:00:25.439> first<00:00:25.680> principle<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:26.580> law<00:00:26.730> of<00:00:26.760> balance

the first principle the law of balance

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.589 
the first principle the law of balance
there's<00:00:28.019> two<00:00:28.289> sides<00:00:28.560> to<00:00:28.769> everything<00:00:29.300> it<00:00:30.300> seems

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
there's two sides to everything it seems

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.420 
there's two sides to everything it seems
really<00:00:31.140> really<00:00:31.289> obvious<00:00:31.859> when<00:00:32.040> you<00:00:32.070> go<00:00:32.279> out

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
really really obvious when you go out

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.520 
really really obvious when you go out
and<00:00:32.579> nature<00:00:32.969> that<00:00:33.239> there's<00:00:33.719> an<00:00:33.870> upside<00:00:34.260> and<00:00:34.440> a

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
and nature that there's an upside and a

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.420 
and nature that there's an upside and a
downside<00:00:35.070> birth<00:00:35.460> life<00:00:36.230> good<00:00:37.230> bad<00:00:37.590> chaos<00:00:38.219> and

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
downside birth life good bad chaos and

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.340 
downside birth life good bad chaos and
order<00:00:38.550> but<00:00:39.360> you<00:00:39.480> know<00:00:39.600> when<00:00:39.780> you<00:00:39.899> come<00:00:40.140> back

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
order but you know when you come back

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.069 
order but you know when you come back
and<00:00:40.620> start<00:00:40.860> applying<00:00:41.280> it<00:00:41.460> to<00:00:41.489> your<00:00:41.640> own<00:00:41.730> life

00:00:42.069 --> 00:00:42.079

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
goodness gracious me people find it so

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.000 
goodness gracious me people find it so
hard<00:00:44.640> they<00:00:45.629> find<00:00:45.899> it<00:00:46.020> hard<00:00:46.230> to<00:00:46.379> understand

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
hard they find it hard to understand

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.130 
hard they find it hard to understand
that<00:00:47.579> for<00:00:47.789> every<00:00:48.030> upper<00:00:48.360> there's<00:00:48.780> a<00:00:48.870> downer

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
that for every upper there's a downer

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.150 
that for every upper there's a downer
for<00:00:49.500> every<00:00:50.250> depression<00:00:51.120> there's<00:00:51.510> an<00:00:51.629> elation

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.160 
for every depression there's an elation

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.250 
for every depression there's an elation
so<00:00:53.160> really<00:00:53.550> when<00:00:53.940> we<00:00:54.090> talk<00:00:54.329> about<00:00:54.360> finding

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
so really when we talk about finding

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.110 
so really when we talk about finding
ourselves<00:00:55.379> in<00:00:55.860> a<00:00:55.949> good<00:00:56.219> place<00:00:56.430> we<00:00:56.850> find

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
ourselves in a good place we find

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.209 
ourselves in a good place we find
ourselves<00:00:57.270> saying<00:00:57.870> we<00:00:58.410> don't<00:00:58.649> want<00:00:58.980> to<00:00:59.100> be

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
ourselves saying we don't want to be
