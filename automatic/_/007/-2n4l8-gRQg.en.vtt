00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.570
 in that direction 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.390
 in that direction 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:22.319
 in his direction to afp 

00:00:22.319 --> 00:00:23.409
 cast 

00:00:23.409 --> 00:00:26.409
 he determines 

00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:32.680
 what determines 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.680
 for the steps 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:39.700
 leave the room we talk about it salazar obama 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.690
 why because I hit the ball 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:43.780
 do I touch the bar 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.530
 at the wedding 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.940
 outside but outside put it there anyway 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.000
 you did what the earthlings he is called to occupy 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.960
 good after the bac it's like that here 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.620
 it's a choice he made the decision 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:59.940
 I have a straight line and when m 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.170
 all the part that yesterday on this side of the caf 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.040
 he participated in the experiment 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.040
 the part that is their the part the state the text also 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.020
 in my opinion the only sin the place of the Bastille 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.530
 achraf laval malaria blaze of the hand this axis noctis 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.600
 if right that goes there the straight line 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.130
 in which he is willing to pay that I stupid 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.150
 the part of that side 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.410
 it's the part that's halal and firm and if I touch the ball of the other 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:30.410
 side it's going to be the outside part 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:33.650
 it damages the ball 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.650
 some sort of action that I lead to buy 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:38.770
 crusaders 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.830
 if I'm there the aria of the ball that sarah palin 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.940
 in parallel if this cap the external part goes badly 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.630
 the 3d begins to spend three quarters of an hour 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.969
 but paid the attacker the roja felipe corbo 

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:54.260
 but not as I can it is launched 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.130
 in order to get them the ball 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.020
 was she going yao outside 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.020
 and ilaria baba dynamic that way 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.710
 what are the ways to do without 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:04.729
 I look forward 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:07.310
 have the same position at the foot side 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.349
 but hit the ball adobe systems inc it's a place 

00:02:13.649 --> 00:02:17.469
 so hitting at 10:15 am quite normal place I'm going 

00:02:17.469 --> 00:02:19.360
 the hang right chance hamster 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.360
 I know that over there the battle will be made in the direction 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:26.349
 but the mac alopexx nex politicized 

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:28.089
 I'm afraid 

00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:31.309
 but a handful of taxes 

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:34.839
 aboard a car average 110 pence while in front of pau is forfeit 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:37.439
 but I could rafa that 

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:38.919
 I do not complain 

00:02:38.919 --> 00:02:41.179
 bush for the exit phase 

00:02:41.179 --> 00:02:44.599
 we can not go far in section these submarines used on the fly 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:47.110
 sailing and I can go get points where like that 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.260
 the play a park cruises days with the army with the mayor for the 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.529
 departures 

00:02:52.529 --> 00:02:55.369
 four businesses related to growth capture could use to 

00:02:55.369 --> 00:02:58.259
 to be able to change the direction 

00:02:58.259 --> 00:02:59.659
 all these handicaps 

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:00.959
 it means that 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:02.979
 I have but not a handle 

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:04.930
 Stephanie is still stable 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.360
 but I have a challenge larry interested in alerting to the AP I 

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:11.359
 want me crazy six years 

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:15.679
 so know that it smells homes 

00:03:15.679 --> 00:03:17.369
 yeah finally so that m 

00:03:17.369 --> 00:03:20.199
 I'll be able to project the ride to the direction 

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:23.199
 but complains the Catalan squad with its time 

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:26.749
 as a buyer the next day the bad guys what to send out there 

00:03:26.749 --> 00:03:28.769
 which appears 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:31.249
 the instance learns from the art school of typing 

00:03:31.249 --> 00:03:35.099
 like in the fable it stops then how a country our chances that 

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:37.179
 to send there which tapas 

00:03:37.179 --> 00:03:40.179
 as to a hair clearly improves as in the fable 

00:03:42.869 --> 00:03:46.099
 it is a club the caf is stable but by definition 

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:49.659
 it is to keep the trajectory in the quest no longer slow to a weight cm 

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:52.359
 by the direction I want to play 

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:53.830
 if I want to play there 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:57.200
 damage to keep these are the most prone to go m 

00:03:57.839 --> 00:04:00.449
 in the direction of playing in power 

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:03.519
 increase my chances of getting there 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:07.499
 can i use% is to know how to get there or even 

00:04:07.499 --> 00:04:10.559
 bardas strikes and if I talked about the trajectory 

00:04:10.559 --> 00:04:13.559
 diana kate but what could I have too 

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:18.859
 speed of 

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:24.300
 what prompted him to what speed should be launched it took art 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:25.400
 according to 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.400
 the answer is no hyacinth single key report 

00:04:29.349 --> 00:04:32.689
 this notion does not make it to this trajectory at 4 'it's slower 

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:39.229
 that said it must be a good courage 

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:44.110
 it is the trace no weight mackay that's why we ask without blushing or 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.909
 goals to 1 

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:48.229
 the ceni which rests on a little more closed 

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:51.449
 the power is limited to having a technique that is growing 

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:55.389
 prints way to get back to lend to the basic reception 

00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:58.519
 because we can have it's like that sornay porta case that it gets better 

00:04:59.559 --> 00:05:02.740
 the walks this corn in wider than the peace m 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:05.840
 debate with his craft the man who still thinks the lover or other 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:09.069
 this fold the balls are wandering especially for the military 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:13.830
 the latter could 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:15.800
 mistrust soc c 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:19.470
 castro does not have 500 often scan sweeps also to changes of 

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:21.089
 direction 

00:05:21.089 --> 00:05:22.830
 in this case the ball to the claw 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:26.289
 the scala balala live out of cross currents 

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:29.639
 these knights over there death by his comrades 

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:31.309
 before we passed by 

00:05:31.309 --> 00:05:33.849
 I am here what I want to do a parallel 

00:05:33.849 --> 00:05:35.759
 we see I crossed 

00:05:35.759 --> 00:05:39.249
 I have to do something so that the bullet to Saint-Mayeux incident 

00:05:39.249 --> 00:05:41.270
 ball before afp we'll see 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:44.750
 so she seemed faf account to neutralize this English 

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:46.889
 besnard in this 

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:49.889
 at least and two ways 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:55.089
 the hulala cair 

00:05:55.089 --> 00:05:58.650
 your text I can change when tax at ease on land 

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:01.470
 I'm from there the end of like that I'm stealing it's looking for her place at the 

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:03.699
 hand like are Roman arrogant sort of thing by going 

00:06:03.699 --> 00:06:06.699
 and reflections at saint-lô sides of spalletti is effective 

00:06:08.779 --> 00:06:12.119
 then play more played with people and if the disease 

00:06:12.119 --> 00:06:14.349
 exactly we go to 40 km ap 

00:06:14.349 --> 00:06:17.379
 if play a little bit more but opt ​​assad basle north 

00:06:17.379 --> 00:06:19.490
 gerald m 7 

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:21.089
 if we believe it on the sides 

00:06:21.089 --> 00:06:23.389
 in power and led by afp 

00:06:23.389 --> 00:06:25.960
 we often think on the fly 

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:29.140
 you never know standing of that without head and dad inflation
