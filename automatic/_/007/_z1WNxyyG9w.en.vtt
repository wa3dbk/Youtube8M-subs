00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.219
 ok all strykers are still omitted 

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:11.290
 come in this we are video 

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:13.420
 today I'm here with a brand new tutorial 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:17.080
 in fact I bring the jetpack 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:19.110
 finally after 23 days there is 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:22.930
 working on I managed to get there 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:25.180
 this compact form of jet packs that 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:27.570
 works very very well also for 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:30.070
 survival it immediately saw why 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.309
 then immediately I'll show you how 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:36.159
 it works then we have coal because 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:38.080
 this jet lag works with fuel 

00:00:36.159 --> 00:00:40.559
 so with the coal to think that 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:43.510
 precisely it will be very useful in a survival 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.870
 for example for adventure maps what of 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.729
 gender 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.729
 This jetpack is if we put it on him 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:53.379
 being I hear about jetpack sales 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.769
 so nothing happens it just does 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:58.659
 smoke particles as a starting point e 

00:00:55.769 --> 00:01:01.089
 pro discharge if we have our own coal 

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:03.720
 inventory select it look at it 

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:06.850
 We start to explode if we jump 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:10.090
 we will obviously start flying for 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.320
 go down tours we select and when 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.509
 we are to understand if we do not want 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:17.020
 take damage just ask here 

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:18.520
 so we select this also works 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.939
 in survival we do nothing 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:24.700
 because when we are coal mentions 

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:26.679
 the moment of resistance that if precisely 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.510
 you have not understood what those who shoot up 

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:32.330
 for us it is an invisible killer 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:34.130
 how do you see china resistance were 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.620
 we arrive the existence ends what 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.150
 we do as you see us there 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:40.610
 we do wrong 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:42.170
 and on the other hand it also works in peaceful 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.390
 as you see on the pacific the clipper 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:49.220
 the same is born because a clipper 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:53.930
 let's say I don't say paid but it's a clipper 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:56.590
 which were already exploded let's say how 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:59.930
 this mechanism works a lot 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:01.580
 complex then 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.190
 I state immediately that the world is in 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.440
 description also the commands anyway 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:08.300
 we start immediately we need one 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:12.380
 scoreboard a simple scoreboard 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:16.610
 jetpack give me would we say that not 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:20.420
 it performs the function we say important 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:22.430
 carry out a lot of numerical function e 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:26.420
 then the first with a blog 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:27.440
 Christian if we have jetpacks here in 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.380
 this slot 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.820
 need a slot 102 if we have it there 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.320
 both between scores of 1 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:35.989
 if we don't have it, instead, we activate the 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:39.380
 torch and 107 to 0 this we need for 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:43.010
 understand exactly which player you need to raise 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:45.410
 coal from inventory every now and then 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:48.320
 let it work then in fact this sees 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:50.600
 we serve in the zero slot serves this if 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:52.580
 you have if seeing we have coal if 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:55.400
 we have only selected it 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:58.820
 obviously he heard this clock that in 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:04.310
 practice city creates us a clipper under a 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:08.600
 us invisible and and beyond that is 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:11.239
 even with confused water and 0 that would be 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:13.370
 let 's say the time of explosion that is missing 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:15.250
 to explode zero would be santana 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:17.349
 therefore it immediately shakes even if peaceful 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:21.680
 ok 

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:23.420
 and then this is in pages 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:27.319
 fire particles only when 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:29.209
 tiber explodes around us and this 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:31.459
 instead it gives us the effect of existence that 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:33.220
 I told you a second then now 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:36.860
 immediately 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:40.640
 and then this is let's say particles of 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:42.890
 smoke only to those who have jetpack scores 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:45.560
 one means that if we have many 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:47.060
 jetpack in this slot even if you do n't 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.680
 we use coal we will have the same as 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.900
 particles of smoke but not of fire 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.790
 because of fire we said that the 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.260
 first only when we want that 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:57.470
 this in practice definitely system 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:04:00.049
 to adjust what this is a clock 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:02.090
 which is activated only when 

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:05.299
 precisely we use coal if we keep 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:08.510
 coal decision in this area 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:10.430
 this torch turns off and then the 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:13.190
 objects that are suffering from the practices 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:16.130
 they start doing so 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:20.389
 This buyer sees the objects 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:21.709
 rain thanks and sees point on 

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:22.760
 buyer sees the items when 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:24.740
 they pass in here 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:26.890
 and every time they pass they pass 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:29.780
 slowly I speak so I say 

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:32.060
 so every time you step it had a 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:33.950
 piece of coal from the inventory so 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:36.950
 by saying singular the fact that the 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:41.150
 jetpack from consumption the coal well 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:43.300
 explained very well let's say I put it 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:46.910
 a whole lot to get this concept 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:49.490
 which seems simple from the first impact but 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:50.270
 it is not however you will find world 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:52.039
 enrollment 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:54.139
 if you are interested just a 

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:57.200
 build it with our hands 

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:59.060
 these two blocks less in fact see 

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:59.750
 why he did in all the videos are gods 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:03.080
 simple clocks 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:05.600
 this while and I am here and this puts 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:07.550
 the air then putting the redzone area 

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:09.919
 quickly, in practice, it stops 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:13.590
 they also become indisputable in practice 

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:16.950
 we all commit 6 1 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:18.800
 as you can see the already this is cooled 

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:21.000
 it's all for jet packs 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:23.250
 so if you enjoyed the video there 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.860
 I recommend leaving a like and if not 

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:26.700
 you want to lose even more tutorials vi 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:33.470
 I advise you to register 

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:33.470
 so nothing we close with silvio bello
