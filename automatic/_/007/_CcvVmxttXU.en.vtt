keeps me invested of course there are a

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:50.770 
keeps me invested of course there are a
few<00:01:49.520> parts<00:01:49.910> that<00:01:50.030> could<00:01:50.180> be<00:01:50.300> handled<00:01:50.630> better

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
few parts that could be handled better

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.620 
few parts that could be handled better
but<00:01:51.140> overall<00:01:51.440> it's<00:01:52.250> exactly<00:01:52.790> what<00:01:53.030> you<00:01:53.210> expect

and let me just say that some have

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.910 
and let me just say that some have
complained<00:01:55.970> that<00:01:56.150> I<00:01:56.300> and<00:01:57.020> we're<00:01:57.290> not<00:01:57.500> reading
