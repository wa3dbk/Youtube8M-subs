the<00:03:04.480> video<00:03:04.599> unfortunately<00:03:04.919> because<00:03:05.919> it's

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
the video unfortunately because it's

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.300 
the video unfortunately because it's
quite<00:03:06.189> a<00:03:06.219> bright<00:03:06.489> surface<00:03:07.200> and<00:03:08.200> then<00:03:08.409> the

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
quite a bright surface and then the

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.149 
quite a bright surface and then the
other<00:03:09.489> issue<00:03:09.609> is<00:03:09.790> that<00:03:10.090> and<00:03:10.829> it<00:03:11.829> sort<00:03:12.099> of

00:03:12.149 --> 00:03:12.159 
other issue is that and it sort of

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:14.879 
other issue is that and it sort of

area in in daylight it looks very young
milky<00:03:21.909> and<00:03:22.150> pile<00:03:22.709> but<00:03:23.709> actually<00:03:24.099> he<00:03:24.340> put<00:03:24.519> it<00:03:24.609> in

00:03:25.469 --> 00:03:25.479 
milky and pile but actually he put it in

milky and pile but actually he put it in
a<00:03:25.569> shaded<00:03:25.989> area<00:03:26.109> like<00:03:26.560> this<00:03:26.769> what<00:03:27.040> he<00:03:27.099> do<00:03:27.250> is<00:03:27.370> is

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
a shaded area like this what he do is is

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:29.670 
a shaded area like this what he do is is
that<00:03:27.489> this<00:03:27.790> is<00:03:28.030> actually<00:03:28.150> the<00:03:28.359> opposite<00:03:28.780> it's

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
that this is actually the opposite it's
