 great quality 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:16.209
 it was slow 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:18.219
 it was very slow compared to this pigeon 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:21.250
 that is , it is fast but of great quality 

00:02:18.219 --> 00:02:24.640

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:37.569
 peru did years ago in the year 2006 not 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:39.280
 I was in Peru I was my 4 but also 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:42.370
 I remember was fighting the undertaker 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:46.060
 against it the server works 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:48.730
 marketing already and that's what I call a 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.260
 together with die bar and without rules remember 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.609
 I will not leave the link in the 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.470
 description so you can see 

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:56.379
 the debut of the great quality if not what 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:58.780
 have seen but I when I saw it this is 

00:02:56.379 --> 00:03:01.599
 The first time, I said, bitch marque 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:04.890
 high sure not to fuck that high 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:08.910
 it has higher than the undertaker 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:11.940
 yes no and good in the year 2006 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:15.209
 has made very good stories with the 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:17.760
 undertaker in the year 2007 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:20.570
 I also history with batista and with 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:24.360
 King Mysterio was heavyweight champion 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:28.410
 and well after that for the year 2009 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:30.810
 it became already a this is like who 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:34.110
 and who at the beginning when it started was 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:36.750
 a monster was a monster that he 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:39.239
 he beat everyone was was then the 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:43.110
 source and all that good but then it 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:45.840
 turned into one in this one no one anymore 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:48.150
 for losing fights and all that what 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.650
 same happened with great khali to 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:53.650
 beginning inside like a monster 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:55.780
 a monster that he considers he wanted 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:57.629
 remove this he wanted to take away the position of 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:00.250
 landete quer that has been the story 

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:02.769
 then it was the champion I try this 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:06.189
 good from 22 to batista like for a while 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:09.760
 but then this one already lost its 

00:04:06.189 --> 00:04:11.650
 championship did not have its period rematch 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:15.459
 triple account once normal by the 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:18.370
 filter of the author of luigi and in the year 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:20.650
 2008 I think it has been good 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:22.900
 and then it became a schedule not 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:24.820
 for normal kissing everyone for 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:28.840
 dancing with a fool like a fag 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:31.930
 but good but to me it is for me by 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:34.870
 this personal opinion I do not like 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:38.320
 see the triple in cali so if you decide 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:40.780
 in cali to this wine and practically that 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:43.240
 it was a monster was bad because it should 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:45.729
 have continued like this because a because he has 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:49.120
 had to be committed in a monster in a 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:51.699
 this in a queer that for dancing that 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:54.190
 I do not taste the same as mine 

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:55.670
 same it happened with no kane does not 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:58.370
 the doubles treat him 

00:04:55.670 --> 00:05:00.650
 how the minutes deserve the same 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:03.350
 happened with who this one came in as a 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:06.410
 monster and at the end good according to the 

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:08.330
 history was that in when when 

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:11.000
 remove that in the mask became 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:12.830
 an unstoppable monster but then the 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.360
 two has hurt him changed the story and 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:17.240
 the story was that when whoever 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:20.210
 He took off the mask because he would lose all his 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:21.960
 powers good but good but so the 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:24.840
 sorry thing 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:26.819
 well I will miss the great khali already 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:29.250
 I'm going to miss him because practically 

00:05:26.819 --> 00:05:31.259
 when I started seeing again through 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:33.990

00:05:31.259 --> 00:05:37.020
 long toledo laws but when it was 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:39.630

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:43.080

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:45.750
