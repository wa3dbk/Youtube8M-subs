00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:13.650
 hello I'm oliver franz premium 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.080
 expand brazil 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.970
 I'll show you the selection step today 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.310
 forward and with 2 shorthand 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.350
 the variant is something 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.970
 lighter than the barbell on the 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.130
 shoulder because I totally on the balance 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.990
 otherwise it is a very much asked question 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.300
 good complementary exercises for the 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.180
 lower body builds strength around stability 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.800
 hump hips and knees on form the 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.239
 thighs and not just the 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.670
 Criteria thus sets the front page 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:56.670
 but also the two back and 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:58.260
 especially the buttock muscles at the 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.109
 now you just hold two shorthand 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.329
 close to the body 

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:05.670
 right back from the five 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:09.450
 companies withdraw their shoulders 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.979
 and at f5 wide stand start around 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.200
 the tense upper body remains 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.240
 upright when stepping forward 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.270
 first put the verse on 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:21.600
 Back leg flex until it almost and bottom 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.930
 touched and tense over the 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.560
 heel back to the starting position 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.439
 step forward 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.369
 put on various and on the fans 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.520
 on the back 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.439
 the whole without 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:37.310
 The upper body in the hip forward 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:40.130
 That does not require a lot of work 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.320
 stability and control, therefore, too 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:45.079
 much more or higher 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:47.179
 Requirements for stability as 

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:49.310
 at the other the golden ones 

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:50.479
 Weights are due to the step around 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.630
 this sloping movement clearly 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:55.969
 lower than the two buildings 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.500
 whole robbery for athletes and there 

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:59.899
 especially for runners in the game 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.270
 athlete very good supplement because it 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:04.340
 functional power in this piece 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.829
 movement also these demarcated lives 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.599
