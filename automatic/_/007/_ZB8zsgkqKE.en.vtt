00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.389
 hello dear audience and tip 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.740
 Welcome to a small action here 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:06.299
 in world of warcraft i have this 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.389
 little july liz taylors unfortunately on ice 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.200
 is and I will in the streams 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.630
 when I have time again 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.740
 probably the semester break then 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:14.910
 we have already revived 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.770
 once such an hour was done completely 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.580
 funny and Christian in the year are today 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:23.580
 here zero culture as a reindeer 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.460
 get or even two about successes 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.930
 namely in c29 - and we want 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.859
 show how to do all the successes 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.210
 I already got it 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.830
 some of but i thought 10 you have 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.710
 not even in or no counts 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.300
 not at 127 you become after each 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.860
 video out-feed own video 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.350
 upload it for those are some 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.489
 that's why some are very short 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.950
 but you will see videos like that 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.000
 go and know what you have to do and 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.350
 sometimes a bit longer as well 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.670
 for example, for success in the oskar 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.340
 enviably good for through 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.239
 success 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.500
 We will stop in a chat 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.850
 see which with christ thereby whether the 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.770
 success was really achieved or 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.239
 not because chris if all done 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.250
 expected so I was just doing 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.570
 and we heard both together 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.930
 want namely the rusty proto 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.369
 dragon he so rust me yes so we have 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.780
 the last time already done so 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.890
 suffer badly brings chris unfortunately 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.990
 not because he succeeds in songs in 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.240
 but we did 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.920
 then catch up next week 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.320
 anyway this is the video for the 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.200
 first boss today we will be the 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.030
 flames leviathan kill with success 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.040
 vitalis removal is relatively easy 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.170
 at level 100 so you will too 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.460
 probably 110 is done and for that 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.869
 we have to teach the guardian here 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.750
 of organs and address the wearer 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.369
 the hartmut that activates namely the 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.430
 secondary defense system of ultra 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.570
 This will get you protected or how 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.610
 you want to call the first boss 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.530
 about four times the life 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.420
 that's not bad in the 10s 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.430
 Mode is the ex-rapper solo 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.259
 knock it over so that means you need it 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.670
 also no two people of the carrier thing 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.850
 is you have to take you so gloomy 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:55.079
 I recycled in the referenced 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:57.750
 all constantly nothing back here what 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:59.460
 Definitely explain me there in any case 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.110
 being built pointed because if one 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.310
 He then triggers this hard mood 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.360
 what funny things we do your vehicle 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.680
 freeze 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.660
 I could not do anything about the 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.280
 broken vehicle is therefore kill before 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.660
 can start at all and that is with 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.560
 one of the best options 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.540
 namely on the 2 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.470
 the device fits so who does he miss 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:18.840
 can now close here so that shows 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:21.090
 the games also a machine 9 times 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.440
 then so can players back exactly 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.590
 and he can keep his mouth shut 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:28.080
 two more, but only in total 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:30.300
 ten times I believe so and the cemex 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.650
 you will need 25 when you are there 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.230
 Sometimes it is not enough if 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.480
 not shared now but you have to 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.650
 that in any case rich and in the bus 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.760
 to come here for the first time 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.260
 go through that show you of course 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.090
 However you get there to the bossen 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.440
 cetera that you have to know from the 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.680
 his 2 tronic never gives here 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.360
 Luckily, they were still live in there 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.209
 At that time , that means I still have one 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.310
 a bit about field of view, however 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:55.140
 otherwise and now I have as I said 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.820
 also brought now because then too 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.900
 very fast at your time and are 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.380
 sometimes not even that way anymore 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.980
 easy 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:05.760
 That's why we do that, I'm niki 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:07.350
 lauda I complicate so you have to 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.670
 start breaking the towers because there 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.930
 gets out of trouble and annoying 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.340
 but you can also simply drive through 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.739
 if you want that, it's faster 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.299
 but we've already broken them because 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:16.380
 yes no and then it communicates 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:17.910
 Incidentally, there are also days afterwards 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:19.830
 various other depths and here as well 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.489
 for example, his concerns do not apply 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:22.470
 repair 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:23.640
 from the first bus or with all three 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.170
 machines this results in lausanne 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.459
 seems to have said now 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.959
 if it does in hard mode it has to do each one 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:29.700
 sometimes there drips more at the boss 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:31.739
 and if you do that drive us 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.620
 sell here then tell me 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:35.820
 always take the referral because there is 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.989
 Experiences make the other machines 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:39.810
 it is not quite as good to Hartmann 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:41.310
 520 mode not all explanations 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.989
 which I deliver here you can in the 10th 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.690
 and 20s federal equivalent apply 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:47.910
 but this is in tens of ten 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.769
 only possible and 25s not quite as good 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:51.840
 except a level of high enough because 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:55.110
 These machines do more harm here 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.640
 the higher level is and quite good 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.450
 unless of course this is supposed to be 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.950
 namely the problem 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:00.269
 Normally you will get these too 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.980
 would have been if that would trigger 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:06.360
 but no, there must be 20,000 times 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:08.640
 let it be the simple but well 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:10.200
 and that I will not take up because 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:13.220
 here just so important failure and 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.220
 takes over 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:25.530
 optional is expired action house 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:26.820
 he makes his money there 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:28.890
 use the need of other clothes 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:30.090
 forge masters so just like her 

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:31.320
 perhaps marked for the virus remain 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:32.790
 added that is already such a 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:35.100
 a bit exhausting was there 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:39.110
 well also comes this can forms 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:42.030
 times fall over 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:43.740
 Sure, so you can do that too 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:45.260
 a low level do that 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:47.520
 success rather in any case 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:49.380
 but then you should at least 24 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:51.630
 So be on level 90 that is also good 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:52.890
 possible say so if now with yours 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:54.390
 wanted to make him character yes if you 

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:57.090
 have scooter software bought new or 

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:58.500
 not just then but if we 90 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:59.850
 should upgrade then you can indeed 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:02.220
 I also try to try directly 

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:03.750
 because the first moscow to get along with 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:05.070
 two man is actually well possible 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:06.270
 if both then it always ran with 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:08.940
 think the device differently 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:10.350
 because whenever you use the opponent with the 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:11.910
 cemetery from what hurls me here 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:14.940
 can not show the need said 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:16.140
 for the boss then fuck your dear and 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:18.210
 with the beaver flies with it everyone 

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:20.120
 normal so with the protection I the 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:23.760
 all the time doing 1 more harm 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:26.040
 So this blue thing right great 

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:27.600
 weather this time bar yes the bar 

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:28.890
 shows at this shot you have you can 

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.540
 but it would take a while to recharge 

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:32.640
 a guy on the bike this stuff 

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:34.260
 landscape because let these flying 

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:37.260
 things up there with no more 

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:38.760
 from over it damper lie just like that 

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:42.120
 little robbie comes around and they have 

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:43.380
 there came solid down and if you 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.880
 The stop shoots then you can 

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:46.140
 take it with you and recharge it 

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:47.790
 but then you'd need just one either 

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:49.650
 on the motorcycle of the landscape or 

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:52.229
 holding a pointed so that a 

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:53.310
 but it's always charging 

00:05:52.229 --> 00:05:54.510
 relatively constant with first 

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:56.370
 you have to buy there 

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:57.300
 do not put on the other put 

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:59.460
 on the cannon 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:01.590
 take the whole thing so awkward 

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:06.289
 that's why it does not exist anymore 

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:06.289
 believed to have the thermals with slow 

00:06:06.409 --> 00:06:13.639
 chris time I'd if I could 

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:17.940
 there the tower is up then we all have 

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:19.080
 not with austria you can you 

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:21.150
 others go through but you want 

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:22.770
 if you are already highspeed here 

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:24.270
 pace through people here then 

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:26.340
 Still as a citizen kill the Lord 

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:27.539
 not completely release it to 

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:29.490
 already these crystals on the top left and 

00:06:27.539 --> 00:06:30.960
 green on the right and blue on the right 

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:32.490
 red and the yellow that did not understand 

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:34.469
 they show that these are secondary 

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:35.360
 defensive systems are just the thing 

00:06:34.469 --> 00:06:37.620
 strengthen the bus 

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:39.419
 there are just four successes for and her 

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:42.030
 needs original is remove that is 

00:06:39.419 --> 00:06:43.080
 I believe that with all fours so you 

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:44.819
 really have to stand all four towers 

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:47.759
 let go of what suits for the 

00:06:44.819 --> 00:06:49.250
 kite up and kill I've noticed 

00:06:47.759 --> 00:06:53.280
 that somebody killed me something 

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:55.830
 made because it is indeed a good thing heard 

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:57.690
 only show how the principle is yes 

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:59.039
 really just about how to do that on the 

00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:00.389
 best then and you get them 

00:06:59.039 --> 00:07:08.009
 Protected at the beginning speaks for it 

00:07:00.389 --> 00:07:10.020
 is triggered at all comes directly 

00:07:08.009 --> 00:07:11.580
 to us for her song that i 

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:14.130
 Maybe completely out in the tens 

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:15.449
 Mode he has a miro relatively little 

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:16.110
 life should be very fast now 

00:07:15.449 --> 00:07:17.580
 go to death 

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:18.690
 Furthermore, with two people, the 

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:20.400
 landlord we have has in the beginning 

00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:21.659
 the relatively little sleep but that will be 

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:24.599
 more and more the more you put on it 

00:07:21.659 --> 00:07:26.340
 and well with two men and in ten 

00:07:24.599 --> 00:07:29.310
 mode, he is pretty fast 

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:31.169
 dead sport fashion and then you get the 

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:34.500
 whole successes like Chris just without 

00:07:31.169 --> 00:07:35.849
 Boxing stop with white vest the success 

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:37.889
 you usually have for free and then 

00:07:35.849 --> 00:07:40.590
 drop in very, very great because what 

00:07:37.889 --> 00:07:41.610
 Here fire soul and nice sword gives 

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:43.409
 better things then he has here 

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:46.139
 blacksmithing hire so how many 

00:07:43.409 --> 00:07:48.029
 successfully force gets hope that I 

00:07:46.139 --> 00:07:49.560
 But you are already better than that 

00:07:48.029 --> 00:07:51.870
 investigators namely the flat pants and the 

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:53.580
 role play bank and then I would 

00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:55.680
 say that was the first fits then 

00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:57.240
 to look at it we stop each one 

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:58.440
 So if you want to see something else now 

00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:59.669
 only humans have a problem with the 

00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:01.199
 most probably go well 

00:07:59.669 --> 00:08:02.759
 so we just show everyone the playlist 

00:08:01.199 --> 00:08:05.129
 if he looks right from the playlist 

00:08:02.759 --> 00:08:07.979
 then which bus you want to know and 

00:08:05.129 --> 00:08:09.979
 we show everyone today I feel 

00:08:07.979 --> 00:08:13.699
 see you next time 

00:08:09.979 --> 00:08:21.259
 Chris made sink for now 

00:08:13.699 --> 00:08:21.259
 had almost until next time
