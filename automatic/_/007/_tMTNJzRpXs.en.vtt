and agree why can't scholars agree

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:05.840 
and agree why can't scholars agree
because<00:05:04.050> there<00:05:04.260> are<00:05:04.410> so<00:05:04.740> many<00:05:04.980> discrepancies

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:05.850 
because there are so many discrepancies

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:09.620 
because there are so many discrepancies
that<00:05:05.880> the<00:05:06.150> Gospels<00:05:06.660> are<00:05:06.870> not<00:05:07.080> reliable
