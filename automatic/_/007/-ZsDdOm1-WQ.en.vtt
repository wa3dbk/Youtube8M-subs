water they I have the pop ribs and with
just<00:01:32.710> a<00:01:32.829> bit<00:01:33.040> of<00:01:33.159> hot<00:01:33.400> water<00:01:33.640> I'm<00:01:34.030> just<00:01:34.210> going

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:34.390 
just a bit of hot water I'm just going

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.850 
just a bit of hot water I'm just going
to<00:01:34.479> rinse<00:01:34.689> this<00:01:34.960> pot<00:01:35.229> ribs

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.790 

and<00:01:38.180> after<00:01:39.180> a<00:01:39.210> few<00:01:39.480> seconds<00:01:39.930> we're<00:01:40.290> gonna<00:01:40.470> pour

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:40.800 
and after a few seconds we're gonna pour

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.770 
and after a few seconds we're gonna pour
this<00:01:40.950> away<00:01:43.430> that's<00:01:44.430> got<00:01:44.640> a<00:01:44.670> lotus<00:01:45.060> roots<00:01:45.330> this

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
this away that's got a lotus roots this

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.210 
this away that's got a lotus roots this
is<00:01:45.840> what<00:01:46.140> I'm<00:01:46.260> going<00:01:46.470> to<00:01:46.500> do<00:01:46.680> is<00:01:46.740> just<00:01:46.950> going<00:01:47.130> to

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
is what I'm going to do is just going to

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.950 
is what I'm going to do is just going to
cut<00:01:47.370> it<00:01:47.460> into<00:01:47.610> slices<00:01:47.970> I<00:01:50.390> will<00:01:51.390> usually<00:01:51.570> cut

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
cut it into slices I will usually cut

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.140 
cut it into slices I will usually cut
the<00:01:52.110> skin<00:01:52.470> away<00:01:52.680> because<00:01:53.220> there's<00:01:53.520> some<00:01:53.700> still

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:54.150 
the skin away because there's some still

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.110 
the skin away because there's some still
some<00:01:54.390> dirt<00:01:54.630> there<00:01:54.960> and<00:01:55.250> I<00:01:56.250> find<00:01:56.610> it<00:01:56.730> easier<00:01:57.090> if

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:57.120 
some dirt there and I find it easier if

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.650 
some dirt there and I find it easier if
I<00:01:57.720> cut<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:58.800> sinewave<00:01:59.310> and<00:01:59.640> edges<00:02:00.120> and<00:02:00.360> little

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:00.660 
I cut the sinewave and edges and little

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:02.930 
I cut the sinewave and edges and little
slices<00:02:00.900> like<00:02:01.170> this<00:02:01.230> because<00:02:02.070> of<00:02:02.310> the<00:02:02.550> lotus

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:02.940 
slices like this because of the lotus

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:08.180 
slices like this because of the lotus
roots<00:02:03.240> it<00:02:03.900> is<00:02:04.320> a<00:02:04.560> very<00:02:05.750> awkward<00:02:06.750> shape<00:02:07.320> it's

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
roots it is a very awkward shape it's

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.680 
roots it is a very awkward shape it's
usually<00:02:08.340> very<00:02:08.729> difficult<00:02:09.060> for<00:02:09.119> me<00:02:09.240> to<00:02:09.360> cut<00:02:09.540> the

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
usually very difficult for me to cut the

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.210 
usually very difficult for me to cut the
skin<00:02:10.050> away<00:02:10.200> so<00:02:10.350> I<00:02:10.590> usually<00:02:10.679> cut<00:02:10.979> them<00:02:11.100> into

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
skin away so I usually cut them into

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.800
