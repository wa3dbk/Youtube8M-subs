00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:06.450
 good morning I bring you today the 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.840
 different clubs that today there are not many 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:12.110
 different unless I know already 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:16.010
 I will inform 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:17.630
 I will inform you more if you like or 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:20.000
 you want to know information about this 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:20.750
 good that I have in my hands now 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.930
 same 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:27.529
 is that of a lifetime or practically the 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:29.990
 that here the rod that you go the type are 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:32.060
 more with some is long 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:36.079
 a little bit because the difference is that 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:39.650
 example does not have no part is all 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:42.530
 one all wood is one is not that if 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:43.879
 it can be said that they are collectors but 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.100
 is where the difference is most noticeable and 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:48.500
 where else you would notice the difference will be the 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.570
 height what to deny it appears 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.610
 you get high in nations and other countries 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:55.400
 and compare you were solvent above 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:57.769
 from my chest and as a country this can not be 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:00.650
 I screw myself and centers here 

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:02.300
 well, once I've seen this one 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:04.850
 this one that I have here overflowed more than 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:08.120
 nothing because it is broken but they are like this 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:10.790
 the good comes like this or the better ones 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:13.250
 they are come as with a kind of thread 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:16.900
 and you can see it here as a screw and 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:20.510
 It is easy is like a screw let 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:22.370
 in thread I am had 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:25.430
 this part broken as you can see this 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:28.270
 varnished by ourselves but good 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:31.340
 I had a broken part here, look here 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:35.990
 It has from this as you 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:40.030
 sticks sounds plates and sounds like like 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:44.060
 open as you can see the distance is 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:46.790
 put the 56 centimeters higher what 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:50.360
 it brings more power when it comes to 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:55.880
 shoot when it comes to draw is the same 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:57.890
 to unscrew and it's broken and you 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.800
 I will teach now is the case of my 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.660
 father of my father and then he taught the 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.610
 mine that I have it good in the 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:08.490
 outline because that had in this 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:10.950
 briefcase and is the one that really made me more 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:12.790
 practically new fixes this as 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.129
 you are 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:18.430
 even higher than the other even a 

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:22.150
 a little less a little more forgiveness but 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:24.459
 same this to screw unscrew well 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:28.710
 and well the same you know they come 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:33.000
 painted different with this for grant 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:34.620
 so that it grabs better fabrics plus the 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.490
 Most are best as I can 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:40.260
 be and have 33 treatment so that what 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:43.770
 which is good as we are 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:46.220
 really wooden and there is no 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:46.220
 difference 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.930
 I need that I invented the one I used 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.599
 my father 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:59.769
 and as you can see here, fix again 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:03:02.439
 here the fabric so that the arm does not run 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:06.519
 but that is subject to the time to throw 

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:10.109
 strong and nothing more if liked later 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:10.109
 I bring you more models of 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:16.980
 of billiard stick and little else
