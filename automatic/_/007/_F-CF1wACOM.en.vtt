00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.110
 with General Claudio Corti we are in 

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:13.420
 the second day of rest here in 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:17.230
 bardonecchia as they are giving in the 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:20.020
 priority of Colombian Latin and good 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:24.250
 we have done a second week pretty 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:27.910
 quite difficult for the tour to 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:30.980
 the climatic conditions the cold but 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:34.930
 the boys are fighting 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:38.470
 I am quite happy with 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:40.610
 how the team marches why 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:43.550
 each one of the cyclists is 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:47.630
 progressing in own career looking 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:51.460
 experiences also looking at the level of 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:53.329
 where you can get effort from 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:57.199
 Recovery 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:58.720
 and we have also made some results 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:01.240
 what 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:04.809
 and I have become a little calmer 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:07.270
 stage of the fish market was very very 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:10.060
 good very 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:12.429
 very successful for us with four 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:15.460
 cyclists in the first platoon of the 

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:18.149
 tomorrow until the last two 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:20.720
 kilometers the fifth opposite of fabio me 

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:22.940
 make happy 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.700
 but we have this last week that is 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:29.150
 very important with high stages 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:32.480
 mountain and I hope we 're going to try to 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:37.200
 win a stage but now we turn 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:39.240
 is very very good is very positive 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.939
 also in the overall team 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:46.200
 we are in 12th place yesterday we went 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:48.750
 fourth in a stage towards high decides 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:52.200
 towards high mountain 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:54.980
 and this shows the level and willingness of 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.980
 these cyclists
