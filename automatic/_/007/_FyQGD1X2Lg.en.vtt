waves<00:01:15.819> then<00:01:16.810> I'll<00:01:16.929> flip<00:01:17.139> them<00:01:17.319> halfway

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350 
waves then I'll flip them halfway

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.039 
waves then I'll flip them halfway
through<00:01:17.920> I<00:01:18.359> usually<00:01:19.359> add<00:01:19.509> a<00:01:19.539> little<00:01:19.869> extra

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:20.049

time<00:01:20.709> on<00:01:20.920> our<00:01:21.069> toaster<00:01:21.490> but<00:01:21.639> everyone's

00:01:21.989 --> 00:01:21.999 
time on our toaster but everyone's

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:23.699 
time on our toaster but everyone's
toaster<00:01:22.359> is<00:01:22.450> different<00:01:22.779> alright<00:01:23.380> so<00:01:23.590> the

00:01:23.699 --> 00:01:23.709 
toaster is different alright so the

00:01:23.709 --> 00:01:25.199 
toaster is different alright so the
English<00:01:23.829> muffins<00:01:24.310> been<00:01:24.549> toasting<00:01:24.880> for<00:01:25.029> about

00:01:25.199 --> 00:01:25.209 
English muffins been toasting for about

00:01:25.209 --> 00:01:27.449 
English muffins been toasting for about
a<00:01:25.240> minute<00:01:25.509> and<00:01:25.779> I've<00:01:26.020> got<00:01:26.229> my<00:01:26.409> pan<00:01:26.679> I<00:01:26.979> think

00:01:27.449 --> 00:01:27.459 
a minute and I've got my pan I think

00:01:27.459 --> 00:01:29.309 
a minute and I've got my pan I think
it's<00:01:27.609> just<00:01:27.729> the<00:01:27.909> right<00:01:28.090> heat<00:01:28.359> where<00:01:28.630> I'm<00:01:29.139> not

00:01:29.309 --> 00:01:29.319 
it's just the right heat where I'm not

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:31.139 
it's just the right heat where I'm not
going<00:01:29.499> to<00:01:29.619> need<00:01:29.709> any<00:01:29.859> cooking<00:01:30.279> spray<00:01:30.579> and<00:01:30.880> the

00:01:31.139 --> 00:01:31.149 
going to need any cooking spray and the

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:39.780 
going to need any cooking spray and the
egg<00:01:32.139> will<00:01:32.529> hopefully<00:01:32.819> sort<00:01:33.819> of<00:01:33.969> stay<00:01:34.149> together

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:39.790 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.730 

so<00:01:40.790> here's<00:01:41.030> a<00:01:41.090> trick<00:01:41.300> if<00:01:41.960> you<00:01:42.170> all<00:01:42.320> don't<00:01:42.500> know

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
so here's a trick if you all don't know

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.370 
so here's a trick if you all don't know
this<00:01:43.490> eggshell<00:01:44.060> trick<00:01:44.330> but<00:01:44.540> if<00:01:44.630> you<00:01:44.810> use<00:01:45.050> one

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
this eggshell trick but if you use one

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.130 
this eggshell trick but if you use one
shell<00:01:45.770> to<00:01:46.100> grab<00:01:46.850> another<00:01:47.090> shell<00:01:47.630> it's<00:01:47.900> a<00:01:47.990> lot

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
shell to grab another shell it's a lot

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:57.370 
shell to grab another shell it's a lot
easier<00:01:48.290> to<00:01:48.530> get<00:01:48.710> it<00:01:48.860> out<00:01:50.410> number<00:01:51.410> two

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.109 

there<00:01:58.380> we<00:01:58.469> go<00:01:58.799> now<00:01:59.159> if<00:01:59.280> your<00:01:59.399> pan<00:01:59.609> isn't<00:01:59.850> hot

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
there we go now if your pan isn't hot

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.550 
there we go now if your pan isn't hot
enough<00:02:00.149> the<00:02:00.570> egg<00:02:00.719> white<00:02:00.899> will<00:02:01.079> spread<00:02:01.289> around

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
enough the egg white will spread around

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.249 
enough the egg white will spread around
a<00:02:01.679> little<00:02:01.770> bit<00:02:02.039> nothing<00:02:02.850> to<00:02:02.939> worry<00:02:02.969> about<00:02:03.259> you

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
a little bit nothing to worry about you

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:05.359 
a little bit nothing to worry about you
can<00:02:04.289> try<00:02:04.530> and<00:02:04.590> push<00:02:04.799> it<00:02:04.920> back<00:02:04.950> with<00:02:05.280> the

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
can try and push it back with the

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:06.889 
can try and push it back with the
spatula<00:02:05.610> if<00:02:05.909> you<00:02:06.060> want<00:02:06.240> but<00:02:06.450> you<00:02:06.570> don't<00:02:06.600> have

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
spatula if you want but you don't have

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.559 
spatula if you want but you don't have
to<00:02:07.170> so<00:02:07.950> Jennifer<00:02:08.250> likes<00:02:08.550> a<00:02:08.700> lot<00:02:08.879> of<00:02:08.940> salt<00:02:09.269> you
