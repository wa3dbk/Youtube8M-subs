00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:06.359
 hello everyone is the room we are 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.309
 found for the 8th locations 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.170
 pilots 

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:12.349
 so that's I'll show you first 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.059
 where is on the map 

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:18.050
 it is exactly here so close to ls 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.699
 custom easy to find 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:22.260
 I was asked the question in comment 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.090
 if there was a map that indicated the 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.550
 positions no there is no neighborhood 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:31.650
 find them 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:35.180
 so that's gone right arrow and we 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.180
 will see how we are going to transform 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.200
 suspension 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:54.719
 cost 1 a rabbit agreed that this is 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:56.370
 that he wants no no they are not even running 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.940
 quickly the rabbit could have put us 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.940
 a hare 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:03.840
 it starts to be downright chelou I 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.850
 think I want to eat 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:12.600
 vegetables i hate vegetables 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.840
 usually more now than that 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:20.990
 makes you want 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:24.200
 ok then okay 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:29.509
 so in fact we can not attack on 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:32.140
 can scratch we will try to stop 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:32.140
 a vehicle 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:47.420
 we are visibly reassured months to one is 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:50.239
 visible and if I stay there kind then the 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.220
 guy who makes a fuck a bunny at my 

00:01:50.239 --> 00:01:57.380
 he's the guy who actually took drugs 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:02:01.459
 spa - okay so we can do nothing 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:03.319
 more with the rabbit and bah listen I 

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:05.799
 will take the opportunity to tell you what 

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:05.799
 I had to tell you 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:13.459
 in a video that will soon arrive 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:16.340
 I think tomorrow if it's not tonight I 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:21.500
 will you do a little recap 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:24.109
 of my impressions on gta 5 next gen 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.000
 everything I noticed again from 

00:02:24.109 --> 00:02:28.519
 all that I noticed of goods but 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.459
 also not good so that's why 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:32.269
 it's interesting 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:34.549
 after I can tell you right now 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:36.709
 who does not have a photo I'm often asked 

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:37.880
 question do I buy gta 5 on 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:38.060
 next gen or is not it worth it 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.910
 stroke 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.109
 I tell you live in it's worth it 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.359
 if only at the graphics level 

00:02:42.109 --> 00:02:46.910
 it's impressive so it's finally 

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:49.579
 impressive when we come from the ps3 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:51.410
 or the xbox 360 and we arrive on next 

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:53.989
 gen it's impressive so necessarily 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.780
 it's worth it after I'm still 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:59.739
 tell you what's going on and what's not going 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.739
 what's that on the road 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:07.940
 a good kef pebble the rabbit it is 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:14.120
 cute but that's what it is 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:15.680
 cute that's all with her hair is going 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:19.190
 it is pretty but it looks a bit like 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:21.640
 statue but without not the statue with a 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.640
 sunset 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.630
 no if I put myself like that we'll be 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:30.260
 a backlight 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:32.030

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.420
 cigarettes no longer beside it's not 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:34.420

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:45.160
