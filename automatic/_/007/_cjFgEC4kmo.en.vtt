didn't<00:02:15.700> have<00:02:15.730> to<00:02:15.850> worry<00:02:16.060> about<00:02:16.150> that<00:02:16.800> I<00:02:17.800> knew

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
didn't have to worry about that I knew

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.890 
didn't have to worry about that I knew
that<00:02:18.520> I<00:02:18.610> was<00:02:18.730> going<00:02:18.820> to<00:02:18.910> take<00:02:19.000> videos<00:02:19.420> like

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
that I was going to take videos like

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.230 
that I was going to take videos like
this<00:02:20.050> you<00:02:20.200> know<00:02:20.290> the<00:02:20.530> bike<00:02:20.770> and<00:02:21.040> be<00:02:21.730> talking

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:22.240 
this you know the bike and be talking

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:23.520 
this you know the bike and be talking
but<00:02:22.450> I<00:02:22.600> don't<00:02:22.750> think<00:02:22.990> I've<00:02:23.080> ever<00:02:23.110> put<00:02:23.440> it

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
but I don't think I've ever put it

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.430 
but I don't think I've ever put it
together

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.020 

I<00:02:26.500> don't<00:02:26.800> really<00:02:26.920> know<00:02:27.220> when<00:02:27.460> it<00:02:27.580> just<00:02:27.760> clicked

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
I don't really know when it just clicked

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.930 
I don't really know when it just clicked
in<00:02:28.120> my<00:02:28.270> head<00:02:28.300> that<00:02:28.720> I<00:02:28.780> wanted<00:02:28.960> to<00:02:29.140> be<00:02:29.290> long<00:02:29.940> but

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
in my head that I wanted to be long but

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.940 
in my head that I wanted to be long but
it<00:02:31.150> wasn't<00:02:31.360> my<00:02:31.570> first<00:02:31.870> priority<00:02:32.140> like<00:02:32.590> it<00:02:32.740> was

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
it wasn't my first priority like it was

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.510 
it wasn't my first priority like it was
for<00:02:33.640> steel<00:02:33.850> doors<00:02:34.090> love

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
for steel doors love

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.580 
for steel doors love
so<00:02:36.030> I<00:02:36.060> started<00:02:36.450> watching<00:02:36.570> other<00:02:36.930> be<00:02:37.140> loggers

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
so I started watching other be loggers

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.130 
so I started watching other be loggers
like<00:02:37.920> 88<00:02:38.220> Hawaii<00:02:38.670> or<00:02:38.850> spencerian<00:02:39.720> he's<00:02:39.900> called

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
like 88 Hawaii or spencerian he's called

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.800 
like 88 Hawaii or spencerian he's called
now<00:02:40.460> and<00:02:41.460> I<00:02:41.670> thought<00:02:41.910> they<00:02:42.090> were<00:02:42.180> like<00:02:42.360> the

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
now and I thought they were like the

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.510 
now and I thought they were like the
bomb<00:02:43.020> you<00:02:43.320> know<00:02:43.380> there's<00:02:44.160> so<00:02:44.400> many

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 
bomb you know there's so many

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.940 
bomb you know there's so many
subscribers<00:02:44.880> and<00:02:45.780> they<00:02:46.530> had<00:02:46.680> a<00:02:46.710> lot<00:02:46.920> of

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
subscribers and they had a lot of

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.720 
subscribers and they had a lot of
tutorial<00:02:47.550> beds<00:02:47.820> and

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
tutorial beds and

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.970 
tutorial beds and
I'm<00:02:50.060> just<00:02:50.330> talking<00:02:50.780> about<00:02:50.870> you<00:02:51.200> know<00:02:51.319> stuff<00:02:51.769> in

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
I'm just talking about you know stuff in

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.979 
I'm just talking about you know stuff in
their<00:02:52.099> lives<00:02:52.340> and<00:02:52.970> what's<00:02:53.330> going<00:02:53.569> on<00:02:53.690> with<00:02:53.900> the

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
their lives and what's going on with the

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:55.870 
their lives and what's going on with the
world

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
world

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.570 
world
and<00:02:56.330> I<00:02:56.450> thought<00:02:56.630> it<00:02:56.720> was<00:02:56.780> really<00:02:56.930> cool<00:02:57.230> I

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
and I thought it was really cool I

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.830 
and I thought it was really cool I
wanted<00:02:58.580> to<00:02:58.670> do<00:02:58.820> that<00:02:58.850> but<00:02:59.300> of<00:02:59.390> course<00:02:59.420> I<00:02:59.660> wasn't

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
wanted to do that but of course I wasn't

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:05.400 
wanted to do that but of course I wasn't
do<00:03:00.080> that<00:03:00.230> in<00:03:00.350> like<00:03:00.500> front<00:03:00.740> of<00:03:00.860> Mike<00:03:01.360> Maya

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.510 

a<00:03:05.440> computer<00:03:06.400> then<00:03:07.300> I<00:03:07.330> realized<00:03:07.810> that<00:03:08.050> you<00:03:08.320> know

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:08.520 
a computer then I realized that you know

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.040 
a computer then I realized that you know
I've<00:03:09.520> seen<00:03:09.880> people<00:03:10.120> do<00:03:10.420> this<00:03:10.450> in<00:03:10.840> front<00:03:10.900> of

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:11.050 
I've seen people do this in front of

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:13.380 
I've seen people do this in front of
their<00:03:11.170> computer<00:03:11.470> and<00:03:11.940> watching<00:03:12.940> themselves

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
their computer and watching themselves

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.070 
their computer and watching themselves
and<00:03:14.910> it<00:03:15.910> kind<00:03:16.480> of<00:03:16.540> looked<00:03:16.690> like<00:03:16.720> a<00:03:16.810> boring

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:17.080 
and it kind of looked like a boring

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.960 
and it kind of looked like a boring
video<00:03:17.290> and<00:03:17.680> I<00:03:17.710> was<00:03:17.800> like<00:03:17.920> well<00:03:18.100> maybe<00:03:18.430> I<00:03:18.610> should

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
video and I was like well maybe I should

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
first time I did be log on the bike it

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.180 
first time I did be log on the bike it
didn't<00:03:25.540> turn<00:03:25.630> out<00:03:25.750> very<00:03:25.810> well<00:03:26.050> and<00:03:26.800> I<00:03:26.950> was<00:03:26.980> just

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.600 

and<00:03:31.180> I<00:03:31.540> had<00:03:31.720> been<00:03:31.989> let's<00:03:32.709> see<00:03:32.890> riding<00:03:33.340> for<00:03:33.489> like

and I had been let's see riding for like

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:35.160 
and I had been let's see riding for like
about<00:03:33.730> a<00:03:33.880> month<00:03:34.209> before<00:03:34.420> I<00:03:34.690> started<00:03:35.050> putting

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170 
about a month before I started putting

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.760 
about a month before I started putting
my<00:03:35.380> camera<00:03:35.709> in<00:03:35.770> my<00:03:35.860> face

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:38.770 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:41.970 

so

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:41.980 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:45.540 

in<00:03:42.129> the<00:03:42.610> long<00:03:42.819> run<00:03:42.959> why<00:03:43.959> I<00:03:43.989> v-log<00:03:44.409> because<00:03:44.860> when

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.940 
i first came about when I first
I<00:03:49.400> hadn't<00:03:50.239> started<00:03:50.629> riding<00:03:51.019> with<00:03:51.230> my<00:03:51.319> hub<00:03:51.560> kill

I<00:05:13.070> went<00:05:13.190> to<00:05:13.280> college<00:05:13.550> I<00:05:13.910> do<00:05:14.150> like<00:05:14.330> a<00:05:14.360> like<00:05:15.290> a

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:15.350 
I went to college I do like a like a

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:17.390 
I went to college I do like a like a
blog<00:05:15.710> a<00:05:15.740> brief

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:17.400 
blog a brief

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.040 
blog a brief
every<00:05:17.940> two<00:05:18.180> months<00:05:18.360> or<00:05:18.600> something

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:20.050 
every two months or something

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:22.710 
every two months or something
but<00:05:20.409> be<00:05:20.620> logging<00:05:20.860> I<00:05:21.280> think<00:05:21.610> is<00:05:21.729> also<00:05:21.909> very<00:05:22.240> it's

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:22.720 
but be logging I think is also very it's

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:24.390 
but be logging I think is also very it's
a<00:05:22.810> lot<00:05:22.990> easier<00:05:23.020> than<00:05:23.470> writing<00:05:23.860> something<00:05:24.280> down

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:24.400 
a lot easier than writing something down

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:26.129 
a lot easier than writing something down
if<00:05:25.120> you're<00:05:25.300> when<00:05:25.419> you're<00:05:25.509> v<00:05:25.690> logging<00:05:26.020> you're

00:05:26.129 --> 00:05:26.139 
if you're when you're v logging you're

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:28.320 
if you're when you're v logging you're
just<00:05:26.289> talking<00:05:26.740> instead<00:05:27.669> of<00:05:27.789> writing<00:05:28.120> it<00:05:28.270> down

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:28.330 
just talking instead of writing it down

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:31.050 
just talking instead of writing it down
would<00:05:28.659> take<00:05:29.050> a<00:05:29.319> long<00:05:29.860> time<00:05:29.919> although<00:05:30.639> when<00:05:31.030> I

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:31.060 
would take a long time although when I

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:34.559 
would take a long time although when I
do<00:05:31.180> like<00:05:32.110> write<00:05:32.379> blogs<00:05:32.650> I'm<00:05:33.039> i<00:05:33.729> can<00:05:34.270> get<00:05:34.389> more

00:05:34.559 --> 00:05:34.569 
do like write blogs I'm i can get more

00:05:34.569 --> 00:05:36.600 
do like write blogs I'm i can get more
details<00:05:35.050> because<00:05:35.650> I'm<00:05:35.770> thinking<00:05:36.009> about<00:05:36.430> the

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:36.610 
details because I'm thinking about the

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:39.210 
details because I'm thinking about the
subject<00:05:37.210> matter<00:05:37.419> longer<00:05:38.020> and<00:05:38.800> when<00:05:38.919> I'm<00:05:39.039> be

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:39.220 
subject matter longer and when I'm be

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:42.510 
subject matter longer and when I'm be
logging<00:05:39.490> I'm<00:05:39.879> just<00:05:40.830> saying<00:05:41.830> what<00:05:42.190> comes<00:05:42.430> to

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:42.520 
logging I'm just saying what comes to

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:45.500 
logging I'm just saying what comes to
mind<00:05:42.789> at<00:05:43.090> the<00:05:43.690> point<00:05:43.870> in<00:05:44.050> time

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:45.510 
mind at the point in time

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:50.240 
mind at the point in time
so<00:05:46.110> that's<00:05:47.010> my<00:05:47.490> main<00:05:48.500> reason<00:05:49.500> why<00:05:49.590> be<00:05:49.830> log<00:05:50.040> is

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:50.250 
so that's my main reason why be log is

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:52.820 
so that's my main reason why be log is
