pretty much the same rhythm all the way
through<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:50.700> song<00:01:50.939> so<00:01:51.299> it's<00:01:51.390> pretty<00:01:51.540> easy

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
through the song so it's pretty easy

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.069 
through the song so it's pretty easy
once<00:01:52.200> you<00:01:52.320> get<00:01:52.530> that<00:01:52.710> down<00:01:52.920> down<00:01:53.729> down<00:01:54.270> up<00:01:54.600> down
