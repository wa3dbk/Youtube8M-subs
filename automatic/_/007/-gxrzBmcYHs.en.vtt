necklaces and the nice thing about that

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:34.390 
necklaces and the nice thing about that
too<00:03:32.180> is<00:03:32.209> that<00:03:32.420> you're<00:03:32.690> adding<00:03:33.050> your<00:03:33.410> energy<00:03:34.040> to

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
too is that you're adding your energy to

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.430 
too is that you're adding your energy to
the<00:03:34.640> crystals<00:03:35.060> into<00:03:35.240> yes<00:03:35.570> jewelry<00:03:35.990> and<00:03:36.170> that's

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
the crystals into yes jewelry and that's

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.410 
the crystals into yes jewelry and that's
building<00:03:36.920> the<00:03:36.980> intention<00:03:37.700> so<00:03:37.850> it's<00:03:37.970> making<00:03:38.300> it

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:38.420 
building the intention so it's making it

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.330 
building the intention so it's making it
even<00:03:38.540> more<00:03:38.900> energetic<00:03:39.380> and<00:03:39.650> more<00:03:39.770> personal

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 
even more energetic and more personal

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:42.970
