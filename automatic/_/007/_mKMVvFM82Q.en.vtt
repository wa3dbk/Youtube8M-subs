00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:06.120
 Hello everyone, I am often asked how I am 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.649
 I tied this triangular strap 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.710
 hanging on a backpack 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:13.380
 on the lightning sliders for it is very convenient 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:17.100
 open and today i will share with you 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.420
 I'll tell you how I did it all Americans 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.270
 call it weaving 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.580
 rattlesnake does not mean 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.340
 knot 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:30.029
 rattlesnake really looks like 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:34.739
 this rattle on a rattlesnake tail 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:36.930
 such a triangular cross section if someone does not 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.770
 knows you can see the pictures 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.200
 beanbag 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:43.320
 sets a very unpleasant sound were video 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:46.230
 look generally imbued with the spirit 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:49.410
 Well, it's more pleasant for me to call triangular 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.690
 lanyard and so here it looks like this 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.390
 It stretched as taut as possible 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.960
 This is how it looks in not quite 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.550
 tightened up anyway 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.800
 medical lyre balloons clamp piece 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.650
 useful when you knit this, but 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.320
 completely optional 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:08.970
 Lanyard knits very easily looking 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.700
 this video is in bucha 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.670
 eyes to bind him and not 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.680
 no pictures needed 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:21.750
 manuals how to do this important to understand 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:23.450
 basic principles let's start us 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.369
 it takes so much paracord 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:28.369
 Now I will show the main 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.600
 principle as you will understand immediately 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:32.540
 eyes closed in general will immediately 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.049
 knit this lanyard nothing complicated here 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:37.530
 in general, no 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:41.700
 let's begin to visually distinguish 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:44.369
 long private and short take long 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:51.560
 part of the cord tossed over short 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:57.659
 as follows short here is long and 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:02:00.979
 would you bring it from below to below now 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.979
 inside court 1 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:10.660
 started throwing thaws end here now 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:13.480
 see this is a triangular lanyard with us 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:16.180
 here 3 ends one-two-three around them we 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.959
 and we will do weaving the first coil we 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:22.870
 have already done 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:25.000
 around this one this is another 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:31.530
 segment and this is the third turn now 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:33.970
 around this segment 1 did yes 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:39.640
 now around this segment 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:45.430
 that is, in this case it will be here 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:48.540
 So now the next time look 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.540
 around this segment 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.450
 let's pull up a little end 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.680
 superfluous 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:06.210
 you still need it all the time 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:07.590
 catching up to not only leshaka well 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:13.280
 so what now 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:16.730
 well now of course around this time 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:26.340
 brought back around this 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:29.490
 got back around this wrapped that's what 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:32.730
 It turns out such a picture, let me 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:36.630
 draw this whole thing so start 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:39.930
 pull up this lanyard generally need 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:41.900
 pull up very well such a structure 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:50.220
 imposed several such loops 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:53.220
 then tightens here is what should 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:56.100
 get well and then keep as you 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:04:00.540
 comfortable as possible here and so to keep and even 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:17.250
 we draw this picture once around and 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:22.070
 you're cool and around and you're well and here comes this 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:22.070
 trefoil occupied and 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:31.150
 and so on let's give for the most 

00:04:27.939 --> 00:04:31.780
 dull again say how first 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:39.159
 is done 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:43.180
 this weaving all who can understand 

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:45.370
 continue to continue to weave now 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:47.949
 I will show again how the beginning is done before 1 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:51.250
 there is a short end regarding 

00:04:47.949 --> 00:05:05.710
 short and long throw over 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:05:11.409
 short time we get inside so now 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:15.639
 this is one of the three turns out and start 

00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:22.180
 around them from times around this 2 around 

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:29.460
 this you completely drive 2 around this 3 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:29.460
 around this everything can be pulled 

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:36.030
 and according to this all night 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:43.069
 Well, here begins this pictor 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:45.449
 around three strands 

00:05:43.069 --> 00:05:47.970
 let 's see now how much and 

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:49.620
 show you how to finish that is 

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:51.270
 see also what chip can 

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:56.699
 adjust those long ends and lower 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:58.259
 there must be these two but the lengths 

00:05:56.699 --> 00:06:00.560
 it's longer leave that later 

00:05:58.259 --> 00:06:05.490
 tie a knot at the end 

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:08.069
 that is, in principle, right now I'm right here 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:15.000
 need here is a little a longer do I 

00:06:08.069 --> 00:06:20.569
 then I want this one to go out on his little 

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:21.840
 I continue to the top 

00:06:20.569 --> 00:06:24.060
 one time one time one time 

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:27.240
 but I wonâ€™t show you all the time 

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:29.000
 all well, all sliced ICQ to I need 

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:32.490
 very much did not tighten 

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.590
 So now we need to choose a loop there 

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:39.569
 no need 

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:42.180
 We look where the end of the loop here it is 

00:06:39.569 --> 00:06:49.860
 we find it right here below we pull 

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:55.849
 him we pull up for him as we 

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:55.849
 it is necessary and for this end we pull out 

00:06:56.599 --> 00:07:06.070
 we brought it here 

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:08.350
 all we got is what choke 

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:11.800
 you can hang as I showed just 

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:16.419
 at the zipper here you can just tie on 

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:22.050
 the knot can do something like this 

00:07:16.419 --> 00:07:25.810
 come up with interesting things like me 

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:28.810
 show in one of my videos here 

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:31.900
 there will be a link go see how 

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:37.210
 here here to put the node more interesting 

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:38.070
 very simple and funny that's basically 

00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:42.729
 it's all 

00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:46.660
 go see further how to put 

00:07:42.729 --> 00:07:51.720
 here is a normal bundle but now everyone 

00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:51.720
 thanks for watching everyone bye
