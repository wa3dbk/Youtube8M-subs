00:00:05.683 --> 00:00:08.009
 Hello. In the question of Gali from Yasser 

00:00:08.275 --> 00:00:11.399
 Pisal was on intermittent fasting or intermittent fasting 

00:00:12.662 --> 00:00:17.647
 The truth is that it is much more than fasting in Ramadan. 

00:00:18.843 --> 00:00:21.302
 But the whole story or the whole idea 

00:00:21.568 --> 00:00:24.227
 If you fast for about 15 or 16 hours. 

00:00:25.091 --> 00:00:29.411
 Eating high calorie calories by concentrating after exercise along 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:32.270
 And eat at night is 6 to 7 hours 

00:00:32.801 --> 00:00:36.590
 In the sense that you are example possible fasting for example from 7 pm or 10 pm 

00:00:37.122 --> 00:00:41.243
 And eat a day like 12 noon 

00:00:41.376 --> 00:00:44.034
 You have the 6 or 7 hours you can eat 

00:00:50.947 --> 00:00:53.207
 Min Possible to get rid of Intrament Fasting 

00:00:53.606 --> 00:00:58.059
 If one is busy or the nature of his job is abandoned 

00:00:59.056 --> 00:01:02.845
 His time is short; 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:08.361
 Materfresh brings a lot of food to make chicks, working tuna, doing a lot of eating 

00:01:08.494 --> 00:01:11.086
 Based on the proper nutrition of bodybuilding 

00:01:11.751 --> 00:01:15.075
 Or it is possible to have a great appetite means the man loves to eat a lot 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.794
 So he is afraid to smoke 

00:01:20.126 --> 00:01:22.585
 There is a lot of them in it, including Lean Gains 

00:01:22.718 --> 00:01:26.241
 The soft Jinde of his name Pepinlik is that if you want to gain muscle 

00:01:26.573 --> 00:01:28.301
 It is not fat on what has been estimated 

00:01:28.634 --> 00:01:31.957
 It stops about 16 hours a day and breaks for 8 hours 

00:01:32.555 --> 00:01:36.078
 And then eating carbohydrates very high in the days of exercise 

00:01:36.344 --> 00:01:38.471
 And high fat during rest days 

00:01:38.803 --> 00:01:41.462
 In our next type is Eat stop eat 

00:01:42.326 --> 00:01:44.785
 It is fasted for 24 hours 

00:01:45.251 --> 00:01:49.637
 And after you have the six days you shall eat what you desire 

00:01:49.903 --> 00:01:52.629
 Any quantities in any way you relax 

00:01:52.894 --> 00:01:54.556
 In Bardoa a need is called the Warrior Diet 

00:01:54.955 --> 00:01:57.813
 Diet Btaa warrior 

00:01:58.278 --> 00:02:02.798
 It is fasted 20 hours and Lake 4 hours eat them 

00:02:03.197 --> 00:02:06.653
 I would like to clarify the need that is always in the intranet of Fasting 

00:02:06.985 --> 00:02:10.508
 O God, distinguish between him and fasting, knowing that you are possible throughout the day drinking water 

00:02:11.173 --> 00:02:16.224
 It is possible to take any supplements and whey protein BCAA 

00:02:16.623 --> 00:02:20.545
 Because it helps the muscles to pull apart because they know of course 

00:02:20.877 --> 00:02:24.932
 The length of what you take for long periods of your body Mvihos amino acids 

00:02:25.197 --> 00:02:26.793
 Of its protein-rich protein 

00:02:27.191 --> 00:02:31.911
 Thus the body can consume muscle and burn it as it is diluted by energy 

00:02:32.243 --> 00:02:36.896
 What is the effect on the body or its advantages? 

00:02:37.693 --> 00:02:42.346
 All of us know that if we keep the blood glucose in the blood less pure 

00:02:42.678 --> 00:02:46.999
 And thus the amount of insulin that excreted in the body completely 

00:02:47.597 --> 00:02:52.183
 The body takes advantage of energy? Get rid of the fat in your body 

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:56.371
 Unfortunately, however, some of the muscles are relaxed 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:02:59.229
 Since they are always in the intranet, Fasting Libra is selling 

00:02:59.495 --> 00:03:02.951
 They take BCAA for the whole day 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.676
 Or protein or proteins that are used throughout the day 

00:03:06.141 --> 00:03:10.329
 On the basis of reducing the period of muscle breakdown 

00:03:11.126 --> 00:03:12.788
 And maintain the muscle mass 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.510
 I wish he had any question or inquiry I wanted to ask and I will respond to him 

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:19.302
 And Matnasosh are working for SharePoint or LIKE or Netscape for video 

00:03:19.767 --> 00:03:22.093
