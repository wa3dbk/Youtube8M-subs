I got him to vary based replication this
is<00:04:19.470> pretty<00:04:19.709> much<00:04:19.799> all<00:04:20.010> you<00:04:20.040> do<00:04:20.340> in<00:04:20.519> this

is pretty much all you do in this
application<00:04:20.820> but<00:04:21.329> I<00:04:21.359> mean<00:04:21.540> I<00:04:21.660> guess<00:04:21.870> it<00:04:22.019> can<00:04:22.109> be

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 
application but I mean I guess it can be

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.440 
application but I mean I guess it can be
addicting<00:04:22.560> i<00:04:22.650> guess<00:04:22.830> you<00:04:22.980> can<00:04:23.150> get<00:04:24.150> a<00:04:24.180> dig<00:04:24.419> to

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
addicting i guess you can get a dig to

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:26.330 
addicting i guess you can get a dig to
it<00:04:24.750> and<00:04:24.930> maybe<00:04:25.440> might<00:04:25.830> have<00:04:25.860> some<00:04:26.070> replay

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
it and maybe might have some replay

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:27.920 
it and maybe might have some replay
