move the series of Tuesday because I

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.340 
move the series of Tuesday because I
think<00:00:29.609> that's<00:00:29.760> more<00:00:30.090> um<00:00:30.359> you<00:00:31.460> know<00:00:32.460> a<00:00:33.140> it's<00:00:34.140> a

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
think that's more um you know a it's a

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.560 
think that's more um you know a it's a
better<00:00:35.250> time<00:00:35.550> for<00:00:35.760> me<00:00:35.880> to<00:00:36.000> upload<00:00:36.149> it<00:00:36.270> better

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
better time for me to upload it better

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.270 
better time for me to upload it better
day<00:00:36.750> I'm<00:00:36.870> guessing<00:00:37.320> is<00:00:37.500> better<00:00:37.829> word<00:00:38.040> to<00:00:38.160> put

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
day I'm guessing is better word to put

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.760 
day I'm guessing is better word to put
it<00:00:38.399> and<00:00:38.520> so<00:00:39.450> card<00:00:39.750> thought<00:00:39.960> to<00:00:40.140> guess<00:00:40.290> won't<00:00:40.559> be

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
it and so card thought to guess won't be

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.130 
it and so card thought to guess won't be
before<00:00:40.920> them<00:00:41.340> so<00:00:42.059> whatever<00:00:42.239> so<00:00:42.840> today<00:00:43.020> we'll
