players like that fact that this is not
a<00:00:54.489> well-known<00:00:55.000> amp<00:00:55.269> because<00:00:55.659> this<00:00:56.049> amp<00:00:56.350> is

00:00:56.549 --> 00:00:56.559 
a well-known amp because this amp is

nothing<00:00:57.010> but<00:00:57.129> pure<00:00:57.519> tone<00:00:57.820> it<00:00:58.149> sounds<00:00:58.809> great<00:00:58.989> it

00:00:59.160 --> 00:00:59.170 
nothing but pure tone it sounds great it

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:01.680 
nothing but pure tone it sounds great it
also<00:00:59.409> sounds<00:01:00.010> a<00:01:00.070> lot<00:01:00.250> like<00:01:00.309> some<00:01:00.699> really

amplifier that employs two el34 tubes
and<00:01:16.899> three<00:01:17.530> 12ax7<00:01:18.159> tubes<00:01:19.030> now<00:01:19.869> the<00:01:19.929> great

00:01:20.279 --> 00:01:20.289 
and three 12ax7 tubes now the great

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:22.800 
and three 12ax7 tubes now the great
thing<00:01:20.319> about<00:01:20.590> this<00:01:20.890> particular<00:01:21.250> amp<00:01:21.940> is<00:01:22.179> that

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:22.810 
thing about this particular amp is that

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.740 
thing about this particular amp is that
it<00:01:22.929> has<00:01:23.110> a<00:01:23.140> 5<00:01:23.619> selector<00:01:24.429> switch<00:01:24.759> located<00:01:25.539> in

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:25.750 
it has a 5 selector switch located in

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.100 
it has a 5 selector switch located in
the<00:01:25.929> back<00:01:26.140> that<00:01:26.860> allows<00:01:27.190> you<00:01:27.580> to<00:01:27.869> vary<00:01:28.869> the

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.110 
the back that allows you to vary the

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.440 
the back that allows you to vary the
power<00:01:29.380> on<00:01:29.710> it<00:01:29.740> so<00:01:30.159> even<00:01:30.700> though<00:01:30.789> it's<00:01:30.970> 40<00:01:31.270> watt

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:31.450 
power on it so even though it's 40 watt

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.120 
power on it so even though it's 40 watt
you<00:01:31.899> can<00:01:32.049> bring<00:01:32.200> it<00:01:32.350> down<00:01:32.470> to<00:01:32.590> two<00:01:32.740> and<00:01:32.890> a<00:01:32.920> half

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
you can bring it down to two and a half

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:38.850 
you can bring it down to two and a half
then<00:01:34.030> to<00:01:34.299> five<00:01:34.799> or<00:01:35.799> to<00:01:36.190> ten<00:01:36.490> or<00:01:36.819> to<00:01:37.240> 20<00:01:37.690> or<00:01:37.869> to<00:01:38.350> 40

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:38.860 
then to five or to ten or to 20 or to 40

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.389 
then to five or to ten or to 20 or to 40
so<00:01:39.929> being<00:01:40.929> that<00:01:41.020> this<00:01:41.319> is<00:01:41.500> a<00:01:41.530> non<00:01:41.830> master

00:01:42.389 --> 00:01:42.399 
so being that this is a non master

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:45.389 
so being that this is a non master
volume<00:01:42.640> amplifier<00:01:43.470> you<00:01:44.470> can<00:01:44.649> pretty<00:01:44.890> much<00:01:44.979> get

00:01:45.389 --> 00:01:45.399 
volume amplifier you can pretty much get

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:48.300 
volume amplifier you can pretty much get
a<00:01:45.429> lot<00:01:45.700> of<00:01:45.819> grind<00:01:46.149> out<00:01:46.509> of<00:01:46.840> it<00:01:46.989> and<00:01:47.200> not<00:01:47.500> a<00:01:47.560> not<00:01:48.250> a

a lot of grind out of it and not a not a

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.210 
a lot of grind out of it and not a not a

want the full output in the pure tone

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:56.910 
want the full output in the pure tone
you<00:01:55.660> can<00:01:55.690> go<00:01:55.929> all<00:01:56.110> the<00:01:56.140> way<00:01:56.229> up<00:01:56.379> to<00:01:56.500> the<00:01:56.619> 40

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
you can go all the way up to the 40

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
you can go all the way up to the 40
watts<00:01:58.530> why<00:01:59.530> I<00:01:59.560> say<00:01:59.890> this<00:02:00.039> is<00:02:00.190> a<00:02:00.220> non<00:02:00.489> master

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:00.940 
watts why I say this is a non master

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:03.119 
watts why I say this is a non master
volume<00:02:01.149> amplifier<00:02:01.750> is<00:02:02.050> that<00:02:02.349> it's<00:02:02.860> just

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:03.129 
volume amplifier is that it's just

00:02:03.129 --> 00:02:06.900 
volume amplifier is that it's just
single<00:02:03.580> volume<00:02:04.060> so<00:02:04.239> volume<00:02:04.269> 1<00:02:04.869> volume<00:02:05.110> 2<00:02:05.910> you

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:06.910 
single volume so volume 1 volume 2 you

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:09.119 
single volume so volume 1 volume 2 you
have<00:02:07.149> the<00:02:07.330> EQ<00:02:07.750> setting<00:02:08.200> here<00:02:08.470> which<00:02:08.619> is<00:02:08.739> treble

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:09.129 
have the EQ setting here which is treble

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:11.160 
have the EQ setting here which is treble
and<00:02:09.280> bass<00:02:09.459> and<00:02:09.789> then<00:02:10.360> we<00:02:10.569> have<00:02:10.750> a<00:02:10.780> range

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
and bass and then we have a range

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.380 
and bass and then we have a range
expander<00:02:11.980> which<00:02:12.129> is<00:02:12.310> at<00:02:12.430> low<00:02:12.640> and<00:02:12.879> high<00:02:12.910> knobs

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
expander which is at low and high knobs

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.140 
expander which is at low and high knobs
these<00:02:14.019> pretty<00:02:14.349> much<00:02:14.440> act<00:02:14.830> more<00:02:15.550> or<00:02:15.700> less<00:02:15.849> like

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
these pretty much act more or less like

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.080 
these pretty much act more or less like
a<00:02:16.180> boost<00:02:16.569> and<00:02:17.040> presence<00:02:18.040> control<00:02:18.489> so<00:02:18.760> it<00:02:18.910> gives

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
a boost and presence control so it gives

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.540 
a boost and presence control so it gives
you<00:02:19.180> greater<00:02:19.450> flexibility<00:02:20.200> now<00:02:21.040> of<00:02:21.340> course

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
you greater flexibility now of course

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.449 
you greater flexibility now of course
this<00:02:22.420> is<00:02:22.599> a<00:02:22.629> 2<00:02:22.810> channel<00:02:23.050> amplifier<00:02:23.230> and<00:02:24.069> it's

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
this is a 2 channel amplifier and it's

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:27.300 
this is a 2 channel amplifier and it's
in<00:02:24.819> order<00:02:25.480> to<00:02:25.569> use<00:02:25.900> the<00:02:26.440> capability<00:02:27.010> of<00:02:27.069> two

having<00:02:27.640> two<00:02:27.760> different<00:02:27.909> volumes<00:02:28.510> you're

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
having two different volumes you're

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.839 
having two different volumes you're
going<00:02:29.019> to<00:02:29.080> need<00:02:29.290> an<00:02:29.379> a/b<00:02:29.739> switch<00:02:29.950> but<00:02:30.730> the

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:30.849 
going to need an a/b switch but the

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:33.119 
going to need an a/b switch but the
great<00:02:31.030> thing<00:02:31.239> about<00:02:31.330> the<00:02:32.050> yba<00:02:32.590> one<00:02:32.860> bass

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:33.129 
great thing about the yba one bass

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:36.540 
great thing about the yba one bass
master<00:02:33.610> is<00:02:33.790> the<00:02:34.720> 4<00:02:34.959> channel<00:02:35.319> input<00:02:35.739> is<00:02:36.190> already

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
master is the 4 channel input is already

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.309 
master is the 4 channel input is already
wired<00:02:36.849> so<00:02:37.239> that<00:02:37.390> you<00:02:37.480> don't<00:02:37.720> necessarily<00:02:37.959> have

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319 
wired so that you don't necessarily have

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:41.430 
wired so that you don't necessarily have
to<00:02:38.409> jump<00:02:38.769> the<00:02:38.920> channels<00:02:39.420> so<00:02:40.420> for<00:02:40.750> example<00:02:41.170> over

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
to jump the channels so for example over

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.220 
to jump the channels so for example over
here<00:02:41.470> I'm<00:02:41.950> in<00:02:42.010> the<00:02:42.310> high<00:02:42.580> input<00:02:43.180> and<00:02:43.390> right<00:02:44.080> now

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
here I'm in the high input and right now

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.949 
here I'm in the high input and right now
I'm<00:02:44.349> only<00:02:44.500> using<00:02:44.890> channel<00:02:45.519> 1<00:02:45.790> so<00:02:46.420> over<00:02:46.720> here<00:02:46.930> I

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
I'm only using channel 1 so over here I

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:49.979 
I'm only using channel 1 so over here I
get<00:02:47.170> a<00:02:47.200> real<00:02:47.590> pure<00:02:48.340> tone<00:02:48.639> up<00:02:48.879> at<00:02:49.120> 40<00:02:49.480> watts<00:02:49.689> and

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
get a real pure tone up at 40 watts and

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:51.629 
get a real pure tone up at 40 watts and
even<00:02:50.170> I<00:02:50.260> dial<00:02:50.499> it<00:02:50.650> back<00:02:50.680> I'll<00:02:51.069> gets<00:02:51.249> a<00:02:51.340> lot<00:02:51.609> of

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:51.639 
even I dial it back I'll gets a lot of

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:53.520 
even I dial it back I'll gets a lot of
grind<00:02:51.999> and<00:02:52.150> distortion<00:02:52.659> even

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
grind and distortion even

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.460 
grind and distortion even
the<00:02:53.620> lower<00:02:53.770> volume<00:02:54.250> so<00:02:55.180> over<00:02:55.450> here<00:02:55.930> right<00:02:56.230> next

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
the lower volume so over here right next

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.160 
the lower volume so over here right next
to<00:02:56.560> it<00:02:56.590> is<00:02:56.740> 1<00:02:56.980> &amp;<00:02:57.160> 2<00:02:57.340> so<00:02:57.570> trainer<00:02:58.570> basically

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
to it is 1 &amp; 2 so trainer basically

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:00.660 
to it is 1 &amp; 2 so trainer basically
wired<00:02:59.380> these<00:02:59.740> two<00:02:59.920> channels<00:03:00.100> together<00:03:00.520> so<00:03:00.640> I

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
wired these two channels together so I

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.730 
wired these two channels together so I
don't<00:03:00.850> have<00:03:01.000> to<00:03:01.120> use<00:03:01.270> a<00:03:01.300> jumper<00:03:01.720> cable<00:03:01.750> so<00:03:02.560> now

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:02.740 
don't have to use a jumper cable so now

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:04.470 
don't have to use a jumper cable so now
I<00:03:02.770> can<00:03:02.980> use<00:03:03.010> volume<00:03:03.490> 1<00:03:03.670> and<00:03:03.700> volume<00:03:03.880> 2<00:03:04.240> and<00:03:04.270> get

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
I can use volume 1 and volume 2 and get

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.000 
I can use volume 1 and volume 2 and get
a<00:03:04.510> blend<00:03:04.870> of<00:03:05.050> both<00:03:05.170> of<00:03:05.380> these<00:03:05.440> channels<00:03:05.860> for

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
a blend of both of these channels for

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.270 
a blend of both of these channels for
even<00:03:06.220> more<00:03:06.570> sonic<00:03:07.570> versatility<00:03:08.470> and<00:03:08.650> then

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
even more sonic versatility and then

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.010 
even more sonic versatility and then
over<00:03:09.430> here<00:03:09.460> on<00:03:09.610> the<00:03:09.820> low<00:03:09.970> inputs<00:03:10.300> we<00:03:10.450> have<00:03:10.630> low

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:11.020 
over here on the low inputs we have low

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:14.490 
over here on the low inputs we have low
inputs<00:03:11.320> for<00:03:11.440> just<00:03:11.620> 1<00:03:11.830> &amp;<00:03:12.100> 2<00:03:12.670> &amp;<00:03:12.970> case<00:03:13.840> whatever<00:03:14.440> I

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
want to do if I need to do an a/b switch

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:17.970 
want to do if I need to do an a/b switch
to<00:03:16.450> use<00:03:16.600> both<00:03:16.810> the<00:03:16.900> volume<00:03:17.080> 1<00:03:17.350> and<00:03:17.380> volume<00:03:17.560> 2<00:03:17.950> I

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
to use both the volume 1 and volume 2 I

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.300 
to use both the volume 1 and volume 2 I
can<00:03:18.520> it's<00:03:19.240> a<00:03:19.450> great<00:03:19.810> sounding<00:03:20.380> amplifier<00:03:20.890> with

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
can it's a great sounding amplifier with

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:23.010 
can it's a great sounding amplifier with
just<00:03:21.640> pure<00:03:21.910> tone<00:03:22.209> and<00:03:22.480> sounds<00:03:22.780> even<00:03:22.990> better

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:23.020 
just pure tone and sounds even better

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:25.580 
just pure tone and sounds even better
when<00:03:23.380> you<00:03:23.410> throw<00:03:23.770> pedals<00:03:24.459> in<00:03:24.610> front<00:03:24.880> of<00:03:25.000> it

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
when you throw pedals in front of it

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.979 
when you throw pedals in front of it
let's<00:03:26.590> begin<00:03:27.070> by<00:03:28.030> hearing<00:03:28.300> the<00:03:28.480> samples<00:03:28.930> I

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:28.989 
let's begin by hearing the samples I

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:30.990 
let's begin by hearing the samples I
said<00:03:29.140> before<00:03:29.260> this<00:03:29.590> amp<00:03:29.800> has<00:03:29.920> just<00:03:30.250> a<00:03:30.489> great

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
said before this amp has just a great

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.360 
said before this amp has just a great
deal<00:03:31.209> of<00:03:31.239> tone<00:03:31.600> so<00:03:32.320> I'm<00:03:32.620> going<00:03:32.890> to<00:03:32.920> start<00:03:33.190> with

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
deal of tone so I'm going to start with

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.640 
deal of tone so I'm going to start with
just<00:03:33.520> volume<00:03:34.090> 1<00:03:34.360> channel<00:03:34.780> or<00:03:35.020> 1<00:03:35.350> the<00:03:35.500> first

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
just volume 1 channel or 1 the first

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.410 
just volume 1 channel or 1 the first
channel<00:03:35.980> over<00:03:36.190> here<00:03:36.280> I'm<00:03:36.700> going<00:03:37.150> all<00:03:37.300> the<00:03:37.390> way

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:37.420 
channel over here I'm going all the way

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:39.210 
channel over here I'm going all the way
down<00:03:37.660> to<00:03:37.870> two<00:03:38.020> and<00:03:38.110> a<00:03:38.140> half<00:03:38.230> watts<00:03:38.500> so<00:03:38.770> you<00:03:39.040> get

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
down to two and a half watts so you get

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.670 
down to two and a half watts so you get
to<00:03:39.340> hear<00:03:39.730> the<00:03:40.060> kind<00:03:40.270> of<00:03:40.450> overdrive<00:03:41.410> that<00:03:41.440> you

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
to hear the kind of overdrive that you

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:42.960 
to hear the kind of overdrive that you
get<00:03:41.830> out<00:03:41.950> of<00:03:41.980> this<00:03:42.070> amp<00:03:42.310> it<00:03:42.459> just<00:03:42.640> sounds

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
get out of this amp it just sounds

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:45.210 
get out of this amp it just sounds
fantastic<00:03:43.209> and<00:03:43.810> then<00:03:44.530> I'm<00:03:44.709> going<00:03:44.860> to<00:03:44.890> bump<00:03:45.100> it

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
fantastic and then I'm going to bump it

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.190 
fantastic and then I'm going to bump it
all<00:03:45.370> the<00:03:45.489> way<00:03:45.580> up<00:03:45.670> to<00:03:45.820> 40<00:03:46.180> watts<00:03:46.390> so<00:03:46.690> you<00:03:46.989> can

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 
all the way up to 40 watts so you can

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:48.960 
all the way up to 40 watts so you can
hear<00:03:47.500> it<00:03:47.530> just<00:03:48.010> cleans<00:03:48.280> up<00:03:48.520> and<00:03:48.670> then<00:03:48.760> it<00:03:48.850> just

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
hear it just cleans up and then it just

00:03:48.970 --> 00:04:06.480 
hear it just cleans up and then it just
becomes<00:03:49.239> really<00:03:49.360> round<00:03:50.110> and<00:03:50.500> beautiful

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:06.490 

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:13.850 

Oh

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:13.860 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:17.120 

Oh

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:23.810 

Oh

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:40.619 

you

00:04:40.619 --> 00:04:40.629 

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:43.659 

now<00:04:41.629> I<00:04:41.659> move<00:04:41.840> my<00:04:42.050> cord<00:04:42.349> into<00:04:42.919> the<00:04:43.099> second<00:04:43.520> input

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:43.669 
now I move my cord into the second input

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:45.369 
now I move my cord into the second input
which<00:04:43.940> is<00:04:44.090> a<00:04:44.120> blend<00:04:44.419> of<00:04:44.599> the<00:04:44.659> volume<00:04:45.229> 1<00:04:45.349> and

00:04:45.369 --> 00:04:45.379 
which is a blend of the volume 1 and

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:47.469 
which is a blend of the volume 1 and
volume<00:04:45.560> 2<00:04:46.009> channels<00:04:46.430> and<00:04:46.639> you'll<00:04:47.000> get<00:04:47.120> to<00:04:47.240> hear

00:04:47.469 --> 00:04:47.479 
volume 2 channels and you'll get to hear
