00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.220 
compensations we can learn to live with

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.760 
compensations we can learn to live with
until<00:01:17.220> things<00:01:17.700> begin<00:01:18.150> to<00:01:18.180> ache<00:01:18.600> where<00:01:19.350> we<00:01:19.530> feel

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
until things begin to ache where we feel

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.999 
until things begin to ache where we feel
the<00:01:19.950> stiffness<00:01:20.520> and<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:21.020> tension<00:01:22.020> now<00:01:22.560> we<00:01:22.650> can

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
the stiffness and the tension now we can

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.020 
the stiffness and the tension now we can
change<00:01:23.340> all<00:01:23.820> of<00:01:23.970> those<00:01:24.119> things<00:01:24.509> with<00:01:25.259> simple

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
change all of those things with simple

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.170 
change all of those things with simple
movements<00:01:27.030> now<00:01:27.900> what<00:01:28.110> I<00:01:28.140> like<00:01:28.590> about<00:01:29.180> moving

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
movements now what I like about moving

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.480 
movements now what I like about moving
is<00:01:30.329> all<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.689> various<00:01:31.079> ways<00:01:31.170> we<00:01:31.350> can<00:01:31.979> move<00:01:32.250> if

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
is all the various ways we can move if

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.999 
is all the various ways we can move if
we're<00:01:32.970> free<00:01:33.299> like<00:01:33.600> you<00:01:34.049> know<00:01:34.200> in<00:01:34.380> those<00:01:34.530> Indian

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
we're free like you know in those Indian

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.580 
we're free like you know in those Indian
movies<00:01:35.400> you<00:01:35.549> see<00:01:35.759> those<00:01:35.970> people<00:01:36.689> that<00:01:37.320> can<00:01:37.470> do

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
movies you see those people that can do

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.640 
movies you see those people that can do
those<00:01:37.740> cool<00:01:38.210> translation<00:01:39.210> movements<00:01:40.049> I<00:01:40.140> love

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
those cool translation movements I love

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.200 
those cool translation movements I love
stuff<00:01:41.100> like<00:01:41.130> that<00:01:41.700> but<00:01:42.600> we<00:01:42.780> can<00:01:42.960> use<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.380> brain

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
stuff like that but we can use the brain

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.539 
stuff like that but we can use the brain
by<00:01:45.210> slowing<00:01:45.750> things<00:01:46.320> down<00:01:46.619> and<00:01:47.159> I<00:01:47.280> want<00:01:47.490> to

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
by slowing things down and I want to

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.880 
by slowing things down and I want to
teach<00:01:47.790> you<00:01:48.030> a<00:01:48.180> real<00:01:48.600> simple<00:01:48.960> movement<00:01:49.740> that

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
teach you a real simple movement that

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.399 
teach you a real simple movement that
you<00:01:50.070> can<00:01:50.340> do<00:01:50.520> you're<00:01:50.939> just<00:01:51.149> going<00:01:51.450> to<00:01:51.720> follow

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
you can do you're just going to follow

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.700 
you can do you're just going to follow
along<00:01:52.829> so<00:01:53.310> you<00:01:53.850> can<00:01:54.090> do<00:01:54.240> it<00:01:54.270> seated<00:01:54.780> but<00:01:55.649> I

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
along so you can do it seated but I

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.030 
along so you can do it seated but I
would<00:01:55.979> suggest<00:01:56.189> that<00:01:57.000> you<00:01:57.240> lie<00:01:57.930> down<00:01:57.990> and<00:01:58.439> do

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
would suggest that you lie down and do

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.730 
would suggest that you lie down and do
it<00:01:59.250> so<00:01:59.490> if<00:01:59.549> you<00:01:59.670> have<00:01:59.850> to<00:02:00.090> stop<00:02:00.659> the<00:02:00.899> tape<00:02:01.140> to

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
it so if you have to stop the tape to

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.789 
it so if you have to stop the tape to
find<00:02:02.430> a<00:02:02.520> place<00:02:02.759> to<00:02:02.969> lie<00:02:03.149> down<00:02:03.350> you<00:02:04.350> can<00:02:04.560> either

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
find a place to lie down you can either

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:05.590 
find a place to lie down you can either

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270 
position or you can watch the fellow

position or you can watch the fellow
here<00:02:14.630> in<00:02:14.780> the<00:02:14.900> picture<00:02:15.140> do<00:02:16.040> the<00:02:16.220> movements<00:02:16.700> as

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
here in the picture do the movements as

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:20.199 
here in the picture do the movements as
I<00:02:17.000> describe<00:02:17.870> them<00:02:18.200> now<00:02:18.920> very<00:02:19.220> simply<00:02:19.910> you're

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:20.209 
I describe them now very simply you're

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:21.910 
I describe them now very simply you're
gonna<00:02:20.360> have<00:02:20.600> your<00:02:20.780> face<00:02:21.110> up<00:02:21.440> to<00:02:21.770> the<00:02:21.890> ceiling

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
gonna have your face up to the ceiling

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.809 
gonna have your face up to the ceiling
and<00:02:23.319> then<00:02:24.319> all<00:02:24.500> you've<00:02:24.709> got<00:02:24.980> to<00:02:25.190> do<00:02:25.340> is<00:02:25.550> keep

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:25.819 
and then all you've got to do is keep

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:28.210 
and then all you've got to do is keep
the<00:02:26.390> back<00:02:26.720> of<00:02:26.989> your<00:02:27.110> head<00:02:27.350> along<00:02:27.739> the<00:02:27.980> surface

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
the back of your head along the surface

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.100 
the back of your head along the surface
if<00:02:28.580> you<00:02:28.610> lift<00:02:29.030> it<00:02:29.180> up<00:02:29.270> off<00:02:29.510> of<00:02:29.750> the<00:02:29.840> surface

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
if you lift it up off of the surface

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.250 
if you lift it up off of the surface
that's<00:02:30.980> okay<00:02:31.550> this<00:02:32.390> is<00:02:32.569> what<00:02:32.750> you're<00:02:32.900> going<00:02:33.230> to

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
that's okay this is what you're going to

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.110 
that's okay this is what you're going to
do<00:02:33.530> you're<00:02:33.800> just<00:02:33.980> going<00:02:34.160> to<00:02:34.220> slide<00:02:34.520> the<00:02:34.850> back

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
do you're just going to slide the back

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.320 
do you're just going to slide the back
of<00:02:35.420> your<00:02:35.569> head<00:02:35.870> to<00:02:36.470> one<00:02:36.500> side<00:02:36.770> and<00:02:37.580> then<00:02:38.120> you're

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
of your head to one side and then you're

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.280 
of your head to one side and then you're
gonna<00:02:38.450> come<00:02:38.780> back<00:02:39.580> do<00:02:40.580> it<00:02:40.610> again<00:02:41.080> and<00:02:42.080> you'll

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
gonna come back do it again and you'll

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.670 
gonna come back do it again and you'll
come<00:02:42.800> back<00:02:43.600> then<00:02:44.600> you'll<00:02:44.780> shift<00:02:45.080> and<00:02:45.410> go<00:02:45.620> to

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
come back then you'll shift and go to

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.479 
come back then you'll shift and go to
the<00:02:45.950> other<00:02:46.100> side<00:02:46.489> and<00:02:46.880> come<00:02:46.910> back<00:02:47.750> and<00:02:48.489> then

the other side and come back and then

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:53.470 
the other side and come back and then
repeat<00:02:50.950> now<00:02:51.950> you're<00:02:52.370> going<00:02:52.519> to<00:02:52.580> go<00:02:52.760> from<00:02:53.120> side

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
repeat now you're going to go from side

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.630 
repeat now you're going to go from side
to<00:02:53.510> side<00:02:54.019> but<00:02:54.290> as<00:02:54.440> you<00:02:54.590> go<00:02:54.769> from<00:02:54.980> side<00:02:55.340> to<00:02:55.370> side

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
to side but as you go from side to side

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.270 
to side but as you go from side to side
pay<00:02:56.540> attention<00:02:57.110> to<00:02:57.200> what's<00:02:57.380> happening<00:02:57.860> to

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
pay attention to what's happening to

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.360 
pay attention to what's happening to
your<00:02:58.459> foot<00:02:58.819> or<00:02:59.450> to<00:02:59.660> your<00:02:59.840> hips<00:03:00.140> as<00:03:00.410> you<00:03:00.799> shift

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
your foot or to your hips as you shift

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:06.930 
your foot or to your hips as you shift
your<00:03:01.640> head<00:03:01.910> from<00:03:02.239> one<00:03:02.510> side<00:03:02.900> to<00:03:03.680> the<00:03:03.709> other

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.630 

that's<00:03:07.940> all<00:03:08.209> there's<00:03:08.510> to<00:03:08.569> it<00:03:09.010> now<00:03:10.010> when<00:03:10.310> we<00:03:10.459> do

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
that's all there's to it now when we do

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.180 
that's all there's to it now when we do
somatic<00:03:11.150> exercises<00:03:11.470> we<00:03:12.470> might<00:03:12.680> be<00:03:12.860> focusing

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
somatic exercises we might be focusing

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.030 
somatic exercises we might be focusing
them<00:03:13.670> on<00:03:13.790> our<00:03:13.940> head<00:03:14.410> but<00:03:15.410> we<00:03:15.560> want<00:03:15.769> to<00:03:15.890> pay

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
them on our head but we want to pay

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.130 
them on our head but we want to pay
attention<00:03:16.549> to<00:03:16.700> how<00:03:17.000> does<00:03:17.060> it<00:03:17.390> relate<00:03:17.750> to<00:03:17.810> the

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
attention to how does it relate to the

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.580 
attention to how does it relate to the
rest<00:03:18.590> of<00:03:18.829> our<00:03:18.950> body<00:03:19.310> and<00:03:19.820> when<00:03:20.600> we<00:03:20.780> do<00:03:20.959> cymatics

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
rest of our body and when we do cymatics

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:23.710 
rest of our body and when we do cymatics
we<00:03:21.799> do<00:03:22.040> them<00:03:22.280> probably<00:03:22.730> a<00:03:22.820> lot<00:03:23.090> slower<00:03:23.510> than

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
we do them probably a lot slower than

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.319 
we do them probably a lot slower than
you<00:03:23.900> saw<00:03:24.230> in<00:03:24.380> the<00:03:24.500> demonstration<00:03:25.150> because<00:03:26.150> we

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:26.329 
you saw in the demonstration because we

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:29.170 
you saw in the demonstration because we
focus<00:03:26.900> on<00:03:27.320> the<00:03:27.890> actions<00:03:28.549> that<00:03:28.609> are<00:03:28.790> taking

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
focus on the actions that are taking

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.199 
focus on the actions that are taking
place<00:03:29.390> and<00:03:29.840> on<00:03:30.410> the<00:03:30.650> release<00:03:31.100> because<00:03:31.970> when

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209 
place and on the release because when

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:35.410 
place and on the release because when
you<00:03:32.329> release<00:03:32.750> yourself<00:03:32.989> slowly<00:03:33.790> then<00:03:34.790> you

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
you release yourself slowly then you

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.110 
you release yourself slowly then you
create<00:03:35.840> relaxation<00:03:36.500> in<00:03:37.340> the<00:03:37.459> muscles<00:03:37.910> and

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
create relaxation in the muscles and

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.810 
create relaxation in the muscles and
then<00:03:38.570> you<00:03:38.690> maintain<00:03:38.930> that<00:03:39.230> function<00:03:40.130> by<00:03:40.549> just

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:40.820 
then you maintain that function by just

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:43.300 
then you maintain that function by just
following<00:03:41.329> along<00:03:41.420> the<00:03:42.109> best<00:03:42.380> that<00:03:42.560> you<00:03:42.709> can

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 
following along the best that you can

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:46.810 
following along the best that you can
so<00:03:44.180> in<00:03:44.329> this<00:03:44.630> week<00:03:44.989> cymatics<00:03:45.620> class<00:03:45.920> I'm<00:03:46.310> going

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:46.820 
so in this week cymatics class I'm going

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:48.880 
so in this week cymatics class I'm going
to<00:03:46.910> be<00:03:47.000> teaching<00:03:47.420> a<00:03:47.780> lot<00:03:48.109> of<00:03:48.350> movements<00:03:48.859> for

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:48.890 
to be teaching a lot of movements for

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:52.660 
to be teaching a lot of movements for
the<00:03:49.100> head<00:03:49.660> some<00:03:50.660> movements<00:03:51.260> for<00:03:51.440> the<00:03:51.560> eyes<00:03:51.799> and
