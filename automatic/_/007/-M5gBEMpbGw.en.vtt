just<00:01:11.880> got<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.590> SSD<00:01:13.590> 30,000<00:01:14.310> so<00:01:14.490> I<00:01:14.820> think<00:01:15.090> this

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
just got the SSD 30,000 so I think this

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.270 
just got the SSD 30,000 so I think this
mean<00:01:15.630> that<00:01:15.659> should<00:01:16.259> play<00:01:16.409> nice<00:01:16.680> together
