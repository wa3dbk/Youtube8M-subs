00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
and white now that's really cool because

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.340 
and white now that's really cool because
the<00:01:26.759> comic<00:01:27.090> book<00:01:27.240> is<00:01:27.570> a<00:01:27.840> black-and-white

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
the comic book is a black-and-white

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.530 
the comic book is a black-and-white
comic<00:01:28.710> book<00:01:29.009> but<00:01:29.280> covers<00:01:29.700> are<00:01:29.850> done<00:01:30.119> in<00:01:30.240> color

comic book but covers are done in color

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.670 
comic book but covers are done in color
however<00:01:32.450> you<00:01:33.450> know<00:01:33.540> you<00:01:33.869> can<00:01:34.049> always<00:01:34.110> turn<00:01:34.500> off

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
however you know you can always turn off

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.999 
however you know you can always turn off
the<00:01:34.829> color<00:01:35.070> on<00:01:35.850> your<00:01:36.119> HDTV<00:01:36.600> sets<00:01:37.259> and<00:01:37.530> that's

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
the color on your HDTV sets and that's

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.100 
the color on your HDTV sets and that's
probably<00:01:38.220> going<00:01:38.729> to<00:01:38.790> be<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:39.000> best<00:01:39.150> way<00:01:39.390> to

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
probably going to be the best way to

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.539 
probably going to be the best way to
probably<00:01:40.770> watch<00:01:40.979> the<00:01:41.189> rest<00:01:41.400> of<00:01:41.490> these

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
probably watch the rest of these

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.120 
probably watch the rest of these
episodes<00:01:42.180> if<00:01:42.990> you<00:01:43.140> have<00:01:43.229> a<00:01:43.290> color<00:01:43.560> TV<00:01:43.799> even

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
episodes if you have a color TV even

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.700 
episodes if you have a color TV even
though<00:01:44.280> you<00:01:44.430> do<00:01:44.640> turn<00:01:45.000> down<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.509> color<00:01:45.750> you

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
though you do turn down the color you

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.410 
though you do turn down the color you
have<00:01:46.920> a<00:01:46.950> little<00:01:47.399> bit<00:01:47.490> of<00:01:47.520> a<00:01:47.670> kind<00:01:48.180> of<00:01:48.240> like<00:01:48.329> a

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
have a little bit of a kind of like a

fake<00:01:48.899> tint<00:01:49.320> sometimes<00:01:49.920> and<00:01:50.220> sometimes<00:01:50.850> you

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
fake tint sometimes and sometimes you

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.840 
fake tint sometimes and sometimes you
can<00:01:51.420> use<00:01:51.600> like<00:01:51.840> a<00:01:51.869> special<00:01:52.500> color<00:01:52.890> box<00:01:53.280> or<00:01:53.610> you

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
can use like a special color box or you

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.550 
can use like a special color box or you
know<00:01:53.939> video<00:01:54.270> editors<00:01:54.540> have<00:01:54.810> that<00:01:54.990> did<00:01:55.200> strip

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
know video editors have that did strip

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.560 
know video editors have that did strip
