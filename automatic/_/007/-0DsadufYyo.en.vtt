00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:06.390
 in this first chapter 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.389
 let's do a review of the tools 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.939
 the devices relax we dump tread 

00:00:12.939 --> 00:00:15.169
 in the course 

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:19.239
 so that at the end of it you have a fairly complete view of which 

00:00:19.239 --> 00:00:20.609
 are 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.569
 in the media what are 

00:00:23.569 --> 00:00:25.899
 the mechanisms by which it is configured 

00:00:25.899 --> 00:00:29.119
 a local area network 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:32.600
 let's start all the most basic elements 

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.630
 composed for example network cards 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:37.740
 ethernet 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:41.130
 It must be said that most are computers at this time 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:41.970
 they have 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:43.970
 a card once informed 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.440
 both laptops and desktops 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.610
 and with them and the two computers we can create a small local network 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.249
 simply connecting them with a special card called 

00:00:56.249 --> 00:00:58.130
 crossed wire 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:01.080
 It is a standard hose but it has coursed the cables in a way 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.080
 special although we'll see in a chapter 

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:08.610
 I want disconnected to set ip addresses is for each of the 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:09.830
 computers 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.510
 we can assume sharing percent folders 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.510
 share percent printers and communicate 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.520
 one computer with the other 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.910
 here you only see how to shoot two computers 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:24.510
 if we wanted to c 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:27.440
 between more computers once we should 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.560
 he replaces this cable through his mouth 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.979
 you can also make network concessions these operators facing 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.920
 wireless devices with well like these that are new ere 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.190
 there are also 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.190
 to integrate them inside computer like a pc card and 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:46.770
 here we can see the collection 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.610
 which is known as adocco 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.090
 equal ip pendulum in each computer we already have communication 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.090
 and even gross post competitors like this being now 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:59.160
 you can also create 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.119
 small local networks in this case of mature networks 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:05.490
 I wanted staff that has very small reach of a few meters 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.139
 but because this is saying files and sharing things 

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:12.620
 came in between the computers with some brutus devices 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:18.060
 as I said before if we want to collect winning samples 

00:02:18.969 --> 00:02:21.809
 we have no choice but to 

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:24.569
 in will go to the cavs 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:26.759
 there were concentrators 

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:28.589
 we would have to 

00:02:28.589 --> 00:02:32.649
 on each card of each computer think integrated and asia 

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:38.629
 efe the card is to practice a hose a formal network cable 

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:39.959
 ethernet 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:41.509
 to go down 

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:43.819
 or concentrates 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:46.819
 these computers or have a limitation regarding 

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:51.599
 number of entries are high in tenerife 6 24 although from each other what 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:53.699
 we are normal people 

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:56.759
 even be all these computers until you no longer fit 

00:02:57.699 --> 00:03:00.399
 no new computer 

00:03:00.399 --> 00:03:02.049
 if that happens 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:04.169
 the jazz can not be seen 

00:03:04.169 --> 00:03:06.789
 connect with each other 

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:08.109
 can 

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:11.059
 do let's say very big mouth 

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:13.219
 joining 

00:03:13.219 --> 00:03:17.239
 a port or an exit port of one of the caps involved entry of the 

00:03:18.649 --> 00:03:22.259
 some cases have special ports for parties with injuries but 

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:27.909
 so you can do in direct mind the union of smoke ap with another 

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:32.549
 with a cable cut like the one that we have commented at the beginning this video 

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:36.599
 that way we have debt 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:40.169
 24 entries in the best then 48 or more 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:44.269
 this can continue to be done with more jabs 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:47.540
 although there are some limits that we can also see later 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:49.529
 they started indefinitely 

00:03:49.529 --> 00:03:53.089
 because possibly the signal deteriorates and the losses 

00:03:53.089 --> 00:03:56.089
 It has bearers and delays too 

00:03:56.649 --> 00:04:01.229
 who this network we have wireless devices like laptops xo 

00:04:02.749 --> 00:04:05.669
 p days efe we ​​are sorry access 

00:04:05.669 --> 00:04:09.369
 along with this he claimed to be a kind of wireless jack with which 

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:11.639
 we can join 

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:13.409
 this counted access 

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:15.729
 with a crossover cable 

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:18.549
 to a jab of those that we have in our network 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:21.549
 and in that way then all those wireless devices that 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.309
 We use our company 

00:04:24.309 --> 00:04:26.229
 we can connect the 

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:28.870
 to the local network can not be 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:33.180
 of tito ue wireless devices you see the pc type and like what are you seeing 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:34.669
 the screen 

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:37.180
 portable carrying integrated 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:40.479
 the wireless device this border 

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:43.139
 as we discussed everything is internal 

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:46.339
 one of the most popular bands is traditionally a modem 

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:50.919
 the models connect directly to the computer 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.860
 and delays for telephone connection 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.629
 the modems for the sl 

00:04:57.629 --> 00:04:59.330
 morals for cable 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:03.199
 but every time they are less shredded and switzerland may routes 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:07.020
 because the models 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:09.729
 they are already more exposed in theory 

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:12.279
 that in the others 

00:05:12.279 --> 00:05:15.279
 if we have a fucking river we have is 

00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:17.419
 modem 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:19.139
 inside seducer 

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:23.330
 and possibly an ethernet port to connect to our computer the 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:25.370
 network cards 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:29.580
 although local popular nations or between various ports 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:32.469
 not because it's being senate 

00:05:32.469 --> 00:05:34.199
 like basso and then 

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:36.389
 Several ports to connect 

00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:39.389
 being just a computer they go is computers from our house 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:42.830
 in addition another wireless connection 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:47.229
 with or against me we can miss the laptop recently 

00:05:47.229 --> 00:05:50.229
 for your match in resources between our computers 

00:05:51.219 --> 00:05:54.120
 share printers asphalt folder 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:57.910
 we can actually say that a cutter that our supplier gives us 

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:00.330
 and st 

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:05.890
 like everything ready before the end of last year a hotspot a modem 

00:06:06.529 --> 00:06:09.969
 and I prefer 13 

00:06:09.969 --> 00:06:13.669
 Finally companies with a large number of senators is not normal 

00:06:13.669 --> 00:06:16.919
 connect speakers directly with the cable patch cord 

00:06:17.559 --> 00:06:18.570
 host 

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:19.779
 by the cavs 

00:06:19.779 --> 00:06:22.080
 They are used in gutters 

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:24.650
 which are recessed narrated mushrooms 

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:27.749
 your hoses are going to give recipes and through 

00:06:27.749 --> 00:06:30.990
 of the structure of the gutters arrive still 

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:32.580
 closet 

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:35.259
 that on the back these cabinets with 

00:06:35.259 --> 00:06:38.749
 as we are a country panel with a connection panel 

00:06:38.749 --> 00:06:40.979
 the part back percent 

00:06:40.979 --> 00:06:42.529
 disconnect the cables 

00:06:42.529 --> 00:06:45.559
 and from the front we can join 

00:06:45.559 --> 00:06:48.559
 our computers playing the oscars 

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:52.499
 is a centralized way will carry out the network 

00:06:52.499 --> 00:06:54.430
 and it's known as 

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:57.240
 in structured cabling 

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:59.969
 and yes to everything 

00:06:59.969 --> 00:07:00.759
 see you soon
