little bit of fun with Minecraft forget
your<00:00:08.970> mushroom<00:00:09.630> farms<00:00:10.139> underground<00:00:10.830> forget

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
your mushroom farms underground forget

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.720 
your mushroom farms underground forget
all<00:00:11.790> of<00:00:11.849> that<00:00:12.559> why<00:00:13.559> not<00:00:13.799> just<00:00:14.099> make<00:00:14.340> giant

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
all of that why not just make giant

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.880 
all of that why not just make giant
mushrooms<00:00:15.389> in<00:00:15.630> daylight<00:00:16.109> without<00:00:16.650> even

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
mushrooms in daylight without even

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.029 
mushrooms in daylight without even
having<00:00:17.039> to<00:00:17.310> worry<00:00:17.730> about<00:00:18.020> mycelium<00:00:19.039> not

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
having to worry about mycelium not

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.090 
having to worry about mycelium not
possible<00:00:20.580> think<00:00:21.060> again<00:00:21.500> all<00:00:22.500> you<00:00:22.769> really<00:00:22.890> need

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
possible think again all you really need

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.519 
possible think again all you really need
to<00:00:23.250> do<00:00:23.400> is<00:00:23.730> make<00:00:24.090> sure<00:00:24.119> that<00:00:24.390> you<00:00:24.660> have<00:00:24.900> a<00:00:25.140> light

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
to do is make sure that you have a light

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.179 
to do is make sure that you have a light
level<00:00:25.859> of<00:00:26.070> below<00:00:26.460> 12<00:00:26.939> so<00:00:27.330> if<00:00:27.390> you<00:00:27.480> hit<00:00:27.599> f3<00:00:28.349> you

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
level of below 12 so if you hit f3 you

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.070 
level of below 12 so if you hit f3 you
will<00:00:29.340> see<00:00:29.580> that<00:00:29.880> right<00:00:30.119> now<00:00:30.150> our<00:00:30.300> light<00:00:30.750> level

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
will see that right now our light level

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.020 
will see that right now our light level
it's<00:00:31.320> hard<00:00:31.470> to<00:00:31.560> tell<00:00:31.679> it<00:00:31.830> right<00:00:31.980> now<00:00:32.189> it's<00:00:32.399> 15

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
it's hard to tell it right now it's 15

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.680 
it's hard to tell it right now it's 15
which<00:00:33.239> is<00:00:33.270> the<00:00:33.480> maximum<00:00:34.140> at<00:00:34.350> this<00:00:34.649> daylight<00:00:35.690> so

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
which is the maximum at this daylight so

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.600 
which is the maximum at this daylight so
we<00:00:37.200> are<00:00:37.530> going<00:00:37.770> to<00:00:37.860> do<00:00:38.010> something<00:00:38.430> we<00:00:38.579> are

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
we are going to do something we are

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.090 
we are going to do something we are
going<00:00:38.940> to<00:00:39.059> create<00:00:39.360> a<00:00:39.420> step<00:00:39.930> way<00:00:40.170> up<00:00:40.440> so<00:00:40.800> we<00:00:40.950> can

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
going to create a step way up so we can

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.389 
going to create a step way up so we can
actually<00:00:41.340> create<00:00:42.090> a<00:00:42.629> bit<00:00:43.500> of<00:00:43.530> a<00:00:43.649> ceiling<00:00:44.129> for

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
actually create a bit of a ceiling for

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.799 
actually create a bit of a ceiling for
our<00:00:44.610> future<00:00:45.180> giant<00:00:45.629> mushroom<00:00:47.539> keep<00:00:48.539> in<00:00:48.660> mind

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
our future giant mushroom keep in mind

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.360 
our future giant mushroom keep in mind
you<00:00:48.930> can<00:00:48.960> use<00:00:49.379> glass<00:00:49.680> you<00:00:49.920> don't<00:00:50.070> have<00:00:50.160> to<00:00:50.250> use

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
you can use glass you don't have to use

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.950 
you can use glass you don't have to use
leaves<00:00:50.640> I'm<00:00:50.969> just<00:00:51.180> using<00:00:51.390> leaves<00:00:51.600> because

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
leaves I'm just using leaves because

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.630 
leaves I'm just using leaves because
they're<00:00:52.079> easy<00:00:52.320> to<00:00:52.530> tear<00:00:52.739> down<00:00:52.770> after<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.430> fact

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
they're easy to tear down after the fact

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.000 
they're easy to tear down after the fact
so<00:00:54.590> what<00:00:55.590> is<00:00:55.680> this<00:00:55.890> one<00:00:56.699> two<00:00:57.239> three<00:00:57.870> four<00:00:58.440> five

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
so what is this one two three four five

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.429 
so what is this one two three four five
six<00:01:02.210> I'm<00:01:03.210> just<00:01:03.359> gonna<00:01:03.480> bring<00:01:03.899> it<00:01:04.049> out<00:01:04.110> a<00:01:04.170> little

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
six I'm just gonna bring it out a little

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.109 
six I'm just gonna bring it out a little
bit<00:01:04.619> more<00:01:06.470> seven<00:01:07.470> eight<00:01:07.770> that<00:01:08.490> is<00:01:08.549> what<00:01:09.000> you

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
bit more seven eight that is what you

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.440 
bit more seven eight that is what you
need<00:01:09.299> so<00:01:09.990> to<00:01:10.290> get<00:01:10.380> started<00:01:10.560> let's<00:01:11.010> do<00:01:11.880> a<00:01:11.909> really

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
need so to get started let's do a really

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.469 
need so to get started let's do a really
quick<00:01:12.689> I'd<00:01:13.530> say<00:01:13.799> five<00:01:14.100> by<00:01:14.340> five<00:01:14.580> a<00:01:14.880> five<00:01:15.270> by

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
quick I'd say five by five a five by

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.539 
quick I'd say five by five a five by
five<00:01:15.509> should<00:01:15.900> work<00:01:16.369> actually<00:01:17.369> you<00:01:17.430> probably

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
five should work actually you probably

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.039 
five should work actually you probably
even<00:01:17.850> be<00:01:18.030> able<00:01:18.180> to<00:01:18.240> get<00:01:18.360> away<00:01:18.450> with<00:01:18.630> three<00:01:18.930> by

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
even be able to get away with three by

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.109 
even be able to get away with three by
three<00:01:19.470> I<00:01:19.710> just<00:01:19.830> want<00:01:20.250> to<00:01:20.340> make<00:01:20.460> sure<00:01:20.759> that<00:01:21.060> I

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
three I just want to make sure that I

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.990 
three I just want to make sure that I
can<00:01:21.479> kind<00:01:22.049> of<00:01:22.170> not<00:01:22.650> have<00:01:22.890> to<00:01:23.070> figure<00:01:23.340> out<00:01:23.369> where

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
can kind of not have to figure out where

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.210 
can kind of not have to figure out where
the<00:01:24.299> center<00:01:24.659> is<00:01:24.780> all<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.049> time<00:01:25.229> and<00:01:25.470> that

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
the center is all the time and that

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.749 
the center is all the time and that
it'll<00:01:26.430> work<00:01:26.460> regardless<00:01:27.210> so<00:01:28.250> this<00:01:29.250> is<00:01:29.400> a<00:01:29.430> three

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
it'll work regardless so this is a three

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:36.310 
it'll work regardless so this is a three
by<00:01:29.909> five<00:01:31.310> and<00:01:32.310> a<00:01:33.000> four<00:01:33.229> that's<00:01:34.229> a<00:01:34.409> four<00:01:35.130> by<00:01:36.000> five

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 
by five and a four that's a four by five

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.910 
by five and a four that's a four by five
one<00:01:37.320> more

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.700 

this<00:01:41.520> is<00:01:41.700> especially<00:01:41.909> useful<00:01:42.360> in<00:01:42.869> servers

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
this is especially useful in servers

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.770 
this is especially useful in servers
especially<00:01:43.979> seeing<00:01:44.549> as<00:01:44.640> you<00:01:44.759> do<00:01:44.880> not<00:01:45.119> have<00:01:45.479> to

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
especially seeing as you do not have to

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.050 
especially seeing as you do not have to
find<00:01:46.700> mycelium<00:01:47.700> anywhere

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.210 

so<00:01:51.060> those<00:01:51.360> hoarding<00:01:51.990> mushroom<00:01:52.439> islands<00:01:52.920> or

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
so those hoarding mushroom islands or

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.590 
so those hoarding mushroom islands or
mushroom<00:01:53.580> biomes<00:01:53.939> don't<00:01:54.240> really<00:01:54.390> have<00:01:54.509> to

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
mushroom biomes don't really have to

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.630 
mushroom biomes don't really have to
worry<00:01:54.750> about<00:01:54.840> it<00:01:55.049> okay<00:01:55.170> double<00:01:55.979> checking<00:01:56.189> we

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
worry about it okay double checking we

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.340 
worry about it okay double checking we
are<00:01:56.940> now<00:01:57.270> at<00:01:57.509> 12<00:01:58.320> sunlight<00:01:59.159> so<00:02:00.060> in<00:02:00.330> reality<00:02:01.020> all

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
are now at 12 sunlight so in reality all

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.469 
are now at 12 sunlight so in reality all
you<00:02:01.500> have<00:02:01.590> to<00:02:01.680> do<00:02:01.770> is<00:02:01.920> just<00:02:02.130> plant<00:02:02.729> who<00:02:03.299> would

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
you have to do is just plant who would

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.840 
you have to do is just plant who would
have<00:02:03.570> thought<00:02:03.750> not<00:02:04.649> only<00:02:04.920> that<00:02:05.100> but<00:02:05.460> now<00:02:05.789> we

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
have thought not only that but now we

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:12.949 
have thought not only that but now we
need<00:02:06.270> some<00:02:06.890> what<00:02:07.890> was<00:02:08.069> it<00:02:08.220> bone<00:02:08.789> meal<00:02:09.060> and<00:02:11.959> this

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
need some what was it bone meal and this

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:15.680 
need some what was it bone meal and this
is<00:02:13.170> all<00:02:13.290> that<00:02:13.440> is<00:02:13.530> needed<00:02:13.680> to<00:02:14.060> grow<00:02:15.060> giant

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
is all that is needed to grow giant
