00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
legs off this bad boy suppose there we

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:42.950 
legs off this bad boy suppose there we
go<00:01:39.320> and<00:01:40.320> he<00:01:40.590> is<00:01:40.710> alive<00:01:41.270> it's<00:01:42.270> just<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:42.720> water

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
go and he is alive it's just the water

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.060 
go and he is alive it's just the water
is<00:01:43.290> so<00:01:43.740> cold<00:01:44.570> he's<00:01:45.570> just<00:01:45.899> a<00:01:46.110> pretty<00:01:46.649> sluggish

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
is so cold he's just a pretty sluggish

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:53.359 
is so cold he's just a pretty sluggish
but<00:01:47.990> we<00:01:48.990> get<00:01:49.200> too<00:01:49.380> close<00:01:49.560> to<00:01:49.680> him<00:01:49.979> he<00:01:50.700> moves<00:01:52.369> so

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.470 
really stoked about that that's my first

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:07.660 
really stoked about that that's my first
marked<00:04:03.980> gold<00:04:05.260> so<00:04:06.260> that<00:04:06.470> is<00:04:06.560> my<00:04:06.799> third<00:04:07.130> ring<00:04:07.489> of

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:07.670 
marked gold so that is my third ring of

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:11.229 
marked gold so that is my third ring of
the<00:04:07.700> year<00:04:08.209> I'm<00:04:09.079> really<00:04:09.350> happy<00:04:09.739> and<00:04:10.519> it<00:04:11.000> just

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:11.239 
the year I'm really happy and it just

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:13.479 
the year I'm really happy and it just
seems<00:04:11.450> like<00:04:11.690> the<00:04:11.930> only<00:04:12.049> way<00:04:12.200> I<00:04:12.350> find<00:04:12.829> rings<00:04:13.160> is

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:13.489 
seems like the only way I find rings is

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:15.009 
seems like the only way I find rings is
putting<00:04:13.820> on<00:04:13.910> the<00:04:14.060> waiters<00:04:14.419> and<00:04:14.630> getting<00:04:14.959> in

00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:15.019 
putting on the waiters and getting in

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:18.670 
putting on the waiters and getting in
the<00:04:15.139> water<00:04:15.350> so<00:04:15.859> that's<00:04:16.760> what<00:04:17.030> I'll<00:04:17.180> keep<00:04:17.870> doing

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:18.680 
the water so that's what I'll keep doing

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.529 
the water so that's what I'll keep doing
especially<00:04:19.009> on<00:04:19.100> these<00:04:19.250> nice<00:04:19.549> days<00:04:19.579> so<00:04:20.209> you<00:04:20.329> can
