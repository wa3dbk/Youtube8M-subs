00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.200
 is one of the great consequences for the whole planet the calculations 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.100
 preliminary reports indicate that the powerful earthquake in Chile 

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:12.410
 tilted even more the earth has altered its balance if they look dokic been 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:15.420
 on its own axis it will accelerate that means 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.420
 to one inti coma 6 microseconds - every day on the clock 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.859
 cejil itself is a huge land mass that moved and precisely that 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.900
 amount of mass causes so little alteration in the rotation of the planet 

00:00:28.899 --> 00:00:32.270
 climb in Athens that changes land for that 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.710
 the research of British scientists 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.760
 It also explains that the displacement of kilometers of rocks and material in a 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.199
 reduced space modifies the weight distribution in our 

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:44.740
 planet day 12 was 6 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:49.030
 anyone despite an amount that can not be understood and those earthquakes 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:50.670
 move much further 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.800
 but when compared to the total that the planet has is a percentage 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.840
 marginal why the change is so small 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.410
 after the sumatra earthquake of nine as one degrees on the richter scale 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.720
 I chose moved seven centimeters - 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.380
 the mega earthquake of chile due to the difference in latitude 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.130
 but in which he has been imprisoned for a long time, 6 comma 8 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.420
 microseconds and continue to be registered day by day 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.380
 the same effect that has occurred now 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.390
 not only on Saturday we lost that time the days have run forever 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.820
 now they will be shorter in this amount until another earthquake occurs 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.540
 of this type 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:31.560
 and continue adding the lost seconds 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.020
 by subtract 12 in the clock 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.940
 the weight changes on earth 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:40.380
 always alter their capacity at the moment this scientists say that if by 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.380
 example in the Chinese hydroelectric plant of the three p gorges te 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:50.160
 will fill with water up to 5 p then in exchange for mass in this sector would 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:55.000
 possibly that the days will increase its extension in zero coma 0 6
