health today we'll be demonstrating a

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.260 
health today we'll be demonstrating a
self<00:00:15.740> myofascial<00:00:16.400> release<00:00:16.609> of<00:00:17.119> the

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:17.270 
self myofascial release of the

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:19.179 
self myofascial release of the
subscapularis<00:00:17.960> muscle<00:00:18.130> now<00:00:19.130> the

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:19.189 
subscapularis muscle now the

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:21.130 
subscapularis muscle now the
subscapularis<00:00:19.849> muscle<00:00:20.000> is<00:00:20.419> one<00:00:20.599> of<00:00:20.720> the<00:00:20.839> four

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:21.140 
subscapularis muscle is one of the four

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.230 
subscapularis muscle is one of the four
rotator<00:00:21.560> cuff<00:00:21.890> muscles<00:00:22.310> and<00:00:22.789> it's<00:00:22.910> actually

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:23.240 
rotator cuff muscles and it's actually

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.060 
rotator cuff muscles and it's actually
on<00:00:23.359> the<00:00:23.390> front<00:00:23.779> of<00:00:23.900> your<00:00:24.019> shoulder<00:00:24.410> blade<00:00:24.619> so

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:25.070 
on the front of your shoulder blade so

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:26.620 
on the front of your shoulder blade so
if<00:00:25.130> you<00:00:25.220> picture<00:00:25.429> my<00:00:25.669> hand<00:00:25.939> as<00:00:26.179> your<00:00:26.329> shoulder

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:26.630 
if you picture my hand as your shoulder

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:28.659 
if you picture my hand as your shoulder
blade<00:00:26.839> or<00:00:26.869> the<00:00:26.990> scapula<00:00:27.560> the<00:00:27.769> muscle<00:00:28.249> sits<00:00:28.490> on

00:00:28.659 --> 00:00:28.669 
blade or the scapula the muscle sits on

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:30.399 
blade or the scapula the muscle sits on
the<00:00:28.789> fossa<00:00:29.060> of<00:00:29.269> the<00:00:29.359> depression<00:00:29.929> on<00:00:30.019> the<00:00:30.109> front

00:00:30.399 --> 00:00:30.409 
the fossa of the depression on the front

00:00:30.409 --> 00:00:32.679 
the fossa of the depression on the front
of<00:00:30.529> this<00:00:30.679> now<00:00:31.519> it's<00:00:31.880> a<00:00:31.970> very<00:00:32.210> important

00:00:32.679 --> 00:00:32.689 
of this now it's a very important

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:35.230 
of this now it's a very important
structure<00:00:33.020> because<00:00:33.800> it's<00:00:34.130> often<00:00:34.550> involved<00:00:35.180> in

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:35.240 
structure because it's often involved in

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.870 
structure because it's often involved in
anterior<00:00:36.200> posture<00:00:36.710> we<00:00:37.220> often<00:00:37.550> the<00:00:37.610> people<00:00:37.700> of

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:37.880 
anterior posture we often the people of

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.490 
anterior posture we often the people of
the<00:00:38.000> pectoralis<00:00:38.300> muscles<00:00:38.900> here<00:00:39.050> pulling<00:00:39.380> the

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:39.500 
the pectoralis muscles here pulling the

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.860 
the pectoralis muscles here pulling the
arm<00:00:39.650> forward<00:00:40.010> but<00:00:40.760> the<00:00:41.000> subscapularis<00:00:41.660> is

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:41.870 
arm forward but the subscapularis is

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:43.960 
arm forward but the subscapularis is
quite<00:00:42.110> important<00:00:42.590> and<00:00:42.770> if<00:00:43.100> it's<00:00:43.250> restricted

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:43.970 
quite important and if it's restricted

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:45.460 
quite important and if it's restricted
and<00:00:44.060> shortened<00:00:44.540> it's<00:00:44.870> going<00:00:45.050> to<00:00:45.110> pull<00:00:45.320> that

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:45.470 
and shortened it's going to pull that

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:47.890 
and shortened it's going to pull that
arm<00:00:45.650> for<00:00:45.980> it<00:00:46.130> and<00:00:46.280> internally<00:00:47.060> slightly<00:00:47.480> so

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:47.900 
arm for it and internally slightly so

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.660 
arm for it and internally slightly so
it's<00:00:48.020> a<00:00:48.080> very<00:00:48.320> important<00:00:48.830> area<00:00:49.070> to<00:00:49.100> focus<00:00:49.310> on

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:49.670 
it's a very important area to focus on

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:51.460 
it's a very important area to focus on
in<00:00:50.300> a<00:00:50.390> lot<00:00:50.570> of<00:00:50.600> different<00:00:50.990> conditions

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:51.470 
in a lot of different conditions

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:53.530 
in a lot of different conditions
involved<00:00:51.800> in<00:00:52.040> that<00:00:52.130> as<00:00:52.310> your<00:00:52.610> posture<00:00:53.000> so

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:53.540 
involved in that as your posture so

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.840 
involved in that as your posture so
maybe<00:00:53.930> he's<00:00:54.050> gonna<00:00:54.110> reach<00:00:54.380> the<00:00:54.410> arm<00:00:54.710> here<00:00:54.980> okay

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850 
maybe he's gonna reach the arm here okay

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:57.610 
maybe he's gonna reach the arm here okay
so<00:00:55.880> the<00:00:56.090> subscapularis<00:00:56.690> is<00:00:56.960> in<00:00:57.110> this<00:00:57.260> area

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:57.620 
so the subscapularis is in this area

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.680 
so the subscapularis is in this area
here<00:00:57.920> now<00:00:58.580> an<00:00:58.880> important<00:00:59.360> thing<00:00:59.390> to<00:00:59.660> remember

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
here now an important thing to remember

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.050 
here now an important thing to remember
is<00:01:00.230> that<00:01:00.260> there's<00:01:00.650> a<00:01:00.710> lot<00:01:00.890> of<00:01:01.010> nerves<00:01:01.370> veins

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:02.060 
is that there's a lot of nerves veins

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:04.359 
is that there's a lot of nerves veins
and<00:01:02.270> arteries<00:01:02.600> that<00:01:02.900> cross<00:01:03.170> this<00:01:03.410> muscle<00:01:03.890> so

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:04.369 
and arteries that cross this muscle so

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:05.919 
and arteries that cross this muscle so
when<00:01:04.519> you<00:01:04.640> start<00:01:04.939> to<00:01:05.059> perform<00:01:05.239> the<00:01:05.659> self

00:01:05.919 --> 00:01:05.929 
when you start to perform the self

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:08.109 
when you start to perform the self
myofascial<00:01:06.469> release<00:01:06.640> make<00:01:07.640> sure<00:01:07.850> you're<00:01:07.999> not

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:08.119 
myofascial release make sure you're not

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:09.999 
myofascial release make sure you're not
feeling<00:01:08.479> the<00:01:08.600> pulse<00:01:08.840> or<00:01:09.469> if<00:01:09.649> you're<00:01:09.829> pushing

00:01:09.999 --> 00:01:10.009 
feeling the pulse or if you're pushing

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:11.260 
feeling the pulse or if you're pushing
on<00:01:10.219> a<00:01:10.249> certain<00:01:10.549> area<00:01:10.759> that<00:01:11.060> you're<00:01:11.149> not

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270 
on a certain area that you're not

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:12.880 
on a certain area that you're not
creating<00:01:11.659> a<00:01:11.749> tingling<00:01:12.200> or<00:01:12.350> numbness<00:01:12.409> in<00:01:12.859> your

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
creating a tingling or numbness in your

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:14.770 
creating a tingling or numbness in your
arm<00:01:13.130> that<00:01:13.880> may<00:01:14.060> be<00:01:14.119> a<00:01:14.240> sign<00:01:14.509> that<00:01:14.539> you're

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
arm that may be a sign that you're

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.569 
arm that may be a sign that you're
actually<00:01:14.929> compressing<00:01:15.679> an<00:01:15.799> artery<00:01:16.130> a<00:01:16.189> vein<00:01:16.549> or

00:01:16.569 --> 00:01:16.579 
actually compressing an artery a vein or

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:18.459 
actually compressing an artery a vein or
one<00:01:17.090> of<00:01:17.210> the<00:01:17.299> nerves<00:01:17.539> so<00:01:17.929> just<00:01:18.140> something<00:01:18.319> to

00:01:18.459 --> 00:01:18.469 
one of the nerves so just something to

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:20.499 
one of the nerves so just something to
think<00:01:18.590> about<00:01:18.890> when<00:01:19.159> performing<00:01:19.609> this<00:01:19.759> so

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:20.509 
think about when performing this so

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:22.270 
think about when performing this so
you're<00:01:20.840> going<00:01:21.020> to<00:01:21.109> use<00:01:21.259> your<00:01:21.439> thumb<00:01:21.679> primarily

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
you're going to use your thumb primarily

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.489 
you're going to use your thumb primarily
so<00:01:22.579> I<00:01:22.789> mean<00:01:23.149> he<00:01:23.270> can<00:01:23.450> demonstrate<00:01:23.630> that<00:01:24.049> and

00:01:24.489 --> 00:01:24.499 
so I mean he can demonstrate that and

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:26.200 
so I mean he can demonstrate that and
notice<00:01:25.069> how<00:01:25.159> she<00:01:25.219> lowered<00:01:25.670> in<00:01:25.759> her<00:01:25.819> arm<00:01:26.030> and

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210 
notice how she lowered in her arm and

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.330 
notice how she lowered in her arm and
that's<00:01:26.630> taking<00:01:26.990> the<00:01:27.079> tension<00:01:27.350> off<00:01:27.740> of<00:01:27.799> the<00:01:28.069> sub

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
that's taking the tension off of the sub

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.219 
that's taking the tension off of the sub
scott<00:01:28.609> which<00:01:29.030> will<00:01:29.240> allow<00:01:29.539> them<00:01:29.810> to<00:01:29.869> get<00:01:30.079> in

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:30.229 
scott which will allow them to get in

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:31.569 
scott which will allow them to get in
there<00:01:30.409> deep<00:01:30.679> enough<00:01:30.829> to<00:01:31.159> perform<00:01:31.340> the

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:31.579 
there deep enough to perform the

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:33.999 
there deep enough to perform the
supplemental<00:01:32.149> faster<00:01:32.450> release<00:01:32.749> yep<00:01:33.710> and<00:01:33.920> as

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:34.009 
supplemental faster release yep and as

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:36.910 
supplemental faster release yep and as
you<00:01:34.130> can<00:01:34.219> see<00:01:34.280> nice<00:01:34.670> circular<00:01:35.030> motions<00:01:35.920> make

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
you can see nice circular motions make

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.919 
you can see nice circular motions make
sure<00:01:37.249> you<00:01:37.399> cover<00:01:37.639> the<00:01:37.759> entire<00:01:37.880> area<00:01:38.210> working

00:01:38.919 --> 00:01:38.929 
sure you cover the entire area working

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:41.559 
sure you cover the entire area working
your<00:01:39.200> weight<00:01:39.380> throughout<00:01:40.100> this<00:01:41.060> region<00:01:41.329> you

your weight throughout this region you

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:43.690 
your weight throughout this region you
want<00:01:41.689> to<00:01:41.810> cover<00:01:41.990> all<00:01:42.289> the<00:01:42.530> little<00:01:42.740> areas<00:01:43.069> deep

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
want to cover all the little areas deep

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.669 
want to cover all the little areas deep
