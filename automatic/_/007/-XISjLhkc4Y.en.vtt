that<00:00:59.940> means<00:01:00.239> looking<00:01:00.510> at<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:00.840> bigger<00:01:01.020> picture

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
that means looking at the bigger picture

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.340 
that means looking at the bigger picture
and<00:01:02.000> what<00:01:03.000> a<00:01:03.030> lot<00:01:03.329> of<00:01:03.480> artists<00:01:03.899> in<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.110> class

and what a lot of artists in the class
are<00:01:04.680> getting<00:01:05.010> excited<00:01:05.610> about<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:06.510> potential

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
are getting excited about the potential

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.219 
are getting excited about the potential
that<00:01:08.010> others<00:01:08.610> share<00:01:08.970> with<00:01:09.210> them<00:01:09.420> you<00:01:09.840> know<00:01:09.960> so

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
that others share with them you know so

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.710 
that others share with them you know so
that<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.590> idea<00:01:10.830> is<00:01:10.920> to<00:01:10.950> really<00:01:11.280> think<00:01:12.030> big<00:01:12.360> and

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
that the idea is to really think big and

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.929 
that the idea is to really think big and
to<00:01:12.840> distinguish<00:01:13.439> yourself<00:01:13.619> from<00:01:14.040> everybody

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
to distinguish yourself from everybody

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.640 
to distinguish yourself from everybody
else<00:01:15.180> and<00:01:15.450> to<00:01:15.540> make<00:01:15.689> work<00:01:15.960> that's<00:01:16.229> unique<00:01:16.619> to

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
else and to make work that's unique to

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.249 
else and to make work that's unique to
you<00:01:16.979> that<00:01:17.220> resonates<00:01:17.729> but<00:01:18.479> beyond<00:01:18.810> that<00:01:18.960> if

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
you that resonates but beyond that if

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:20.630 
you that resonates but beyond that if
you<00:01:19.350> can<00:01:19.500> look<00:01:19.650> at<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:19.890> bigger<00:01:20.130> picture<00:01:20.430> and

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
you can look at the bigger picture and

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.969 
you can look at the bigger picture and
see<00:01:20.970> all<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.360> whole<00:01:21.810> array<00:01:22.170> of<00:01:22.200> possibilities

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
see all the whole array of possibilities

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.300 
see all the whole array of possibilities
and<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.880> other<00:01:24.000> thing<00:01:24.240> that<00:01:24.270> is<00:01:24.390> so<00:01:25.310> exciting

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
and the other thing that is so exciting

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.760 
and the other thing that is so exciting
to<00:01:26.340> me<00:01:26.640> is<00:01:26.850> that<00:01:27.450> all<00:01:27.630> these<00:01:27.810> groups<00:01:28.110> establish

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
to me is that all these groups establish

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.069 
to me is that all these groups establish
their<00:01:28.950> own<00:01:28.979> synergy<00:01:29.549> and<00:01:29.790> their<00:01:29.939> own

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:30.079 
their own synergy and their own

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:31.969 
their own synergy and their own
relationships<00:01:31.079> and<00:01:31.290> their<00:01:31.350> own<00:01:31.500> support

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
relationships and their own support

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.160 
relationships and their own support
structure<00:01:32.310> I<00:01:32.729> didn't<00:01:33.360> anticipate<00:01:33.600> that<00:01:34.020> at

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
structure I didn't anticipate that at

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.230 
structure I didn't anticipate that at
all

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.330 

we<00:01:38.840> distinguish<00:01:39.530> really<00:01:39.799> clearly<00:01:40.070> between

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
we distinguish really clearly between

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:41.800 
we distinguish really clearly between
vision<00:01:41.149> which<00:01:41.299> I<00:01:41.420> think<00:01:41.600> are<00:01:41.689> the

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
vision which I think are the

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.719 
vision which I think are the
non-negotiable<00:01:42.649> issues<00:01:42.920> that<00:01:43.130> an<00:01:43.220> artist<00:01:43.399> has

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729 
non-negotiable issues that an artist has

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:47.740 
non-negotiable issues that an artist has
in<00:01:43.939> their<00:01:44.060> bag<00:01:44.899> of<00:01:45.159> meaning<00:01:46.159> and<00:01:46.750> strategy

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
in their bag of meaning and strategy

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.870 
in their bag of meaning and strategy
which<00:01:48.049> is<00:01:48.229> how<00:01:48.530> you<00:01:48.590> fulfill<00:01:49.130> that<00:01:49.159> vision<00:01:49.340> so

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
which is how you fulfill that vision so

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.260 
which is how you fulfill that vision so
