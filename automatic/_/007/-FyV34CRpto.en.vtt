00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:37.380 
screen looks a lot better on Mac OS X
than<00:01:32.240> it<00:01:32.420> did<00:01:32.690> on<00:01:32.920> PC<00:01:35.050> for<00:01:36.050> some<00:01:36.229> odd<00:01:36.350> reason

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390 
than it did on PC for some odd reason

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.170 
than it did on PC for some odd reason
but<00:01:38.390> yeah<00:01:38.920> there<00:01:39.920> you<00:01:40.009> go<00:01:40.130> guys<00:01:40.310> and<00:01:40.640> that<00:01:41.149> was

a boot up video

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.370 
a boot up video
I<00:01:42.229> think<00:01:42.649> it's<00:01:42.800> relatively<00:01:43.340> quick<00:01:43.729> and<00:01:44.380> very

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
I think it's relatively quick and very

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.920 
I think it's relatively quick and very
easy<00:01:45.560> to<00:01:46.100> install<00:01:46.789> if<00:01:47.360> you<00:01:47.600> know<00:01:47.720> what<00:01:47.840> you're

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:47.930 
easy to install if you know what you're

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.550 
easy to install if you know what you're
doing<00:01:48.259> and<00:01:49.040> if<00:01:49.310> you<00:01:49.610> have<00:01:49.880> the<00:01:50.000> right<00:01:50.180> iso<00:01:50.689> biz

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
doing and if you have the right iso biz

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.940 
doing and if you have the right iso biz
they<00:01:51.740> took<00:01:52.100> out<00:01:52.280> ab<00:01:52.520> support<00:01:53.000> in<00:01:53.680> ten<00:01:54.680> point

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
they took out ab support in ten point

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.520 
they took out ab support in ten point
six<00:01:55.189> point<00:01:55.520> two<00:01:55.760> and<00:01:56.270> this<00:01:56.360> is<00:01:56.420> 0.3<00:01:57.080> so<00:01:57.290> you

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
six point two and this is 0.3 so you

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:58.750 
six point two and this is 0.3 so you
have<00:01:57.619> to<00:01:57.740> have<00:01:57.830> a<00:01:57.890> patched<00:01:58.070> kernel<00:01:58.310> to<00:01:58.580> run

00:01:58.750 --> 00:01:58.760 
have to have a patched kernel to run

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.480 
have to have a patched kernel to run
this<00:01:59.290> well<00:02:00.290> hopefully<00:02:00.650> I<00:02:00.830> get<00:02:01.040> Mountain<00:02:01.310> lime

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
this well hopefully I get Mountain lime

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.340 
this well hopefully I get Mountain lime
right<00:02:01.790> now<00:02:01.939> and<00:02:02.420> then<00:02:02.600> it<00:02:02.720> all<00:02:02.869> be<00:02:03.140> good

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
right now and then it all be good

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.100 
right now and then it all be good
because<00:02:04.009> I've<00:02:04.580> never<00:02:04.880> had<00:02:05.150> a<00:02:05.210> Mac<00:02:05.450> before<00:02:05.840> so

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
because I've never had a Mac before so

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.949 
because I've never had a Mac before so
this<00:02:06.229> is<00:02:06.259> a<00:02:06.409> bit<00:02:06.590> of<00:02:06.680> an<00:02:06.770> adventure<00:02:07.959> for

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959
