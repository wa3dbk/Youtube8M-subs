00:00:59.229 --> 00:00:59.239 
infrastructure than you do let's look at

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:01.539 
infrastructure than you do let's look at
an<00:00:59.329> example<00:00:59.769> we<00:01:00.769> all<00:01:00.920> should<00:01:01.159> know<00:01:01.339> that<00:01:01.489> a

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:01.549 
an example we all should know that a

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:03.789 
an example we all should know that a
good<00:01:01.760> counter<00:01:02.149> to<00:01:02.269> Marines<00:01:02.569> or<00:01:02.749> tanks<00:01:03.049> we<00:01:03.649> can

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:03.799 
good counter to Marines or tanks we can

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:05.260 
good counter to Marines or tanks we can
see<00:01:03.949> that<00:01:04.040> these<00:01:04.220> few<00:01:04.430> tanks<00:01:04.640> will<00:01:04.879> wreck<00:01:05.120> the

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:05.270 
see that these few tanks will wreck the

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:07.030 
see that these few tanks will wreck the
small<00:01:05.570> marine<00:01:05.840> army<00:01:06.140> without<00:01:06.410> much<00:01:06.590> effort<00:01:06.920> at

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.040 
small marine army without much effort at

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.920 
small marine army without much effort at
all<00:01:07.160> this<00:01:07.940> would<00:01:08.150> lead<00:01:08.330> people<00:01:08.540> to<00:01:08.690> believe

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:08.930 
all this would lead people to believe

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:10.990 
all this would lead people to believe
that<00:01:09.080> Marines<00:01:09.560> are<00:01:09.740> bad<00:01:09.920> units<00:01:10.340> and<00:01:10.580> tanks<00:01:10.910> are

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.000 
that Marines are bad units and tanks are

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.670 
that Marines are bad units and tanks are
just<00:01:11.210> better<00:01:11.390> but<00:01:12.110> the<00:01:12.230> fact<00:01:12.470> of<00:01:12.560> the<00:01:12.620> matter

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 
just better but the fact of the matter

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.230 
just better but the fact of the matter
is<00:01:12.980> that<00:01:13.010> the<00:01:13.220> tank<00:01:13.430> army<00:01:13.730> is<00:01:13.820> far<00:01:14.060> more

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
is that the tank army is far more

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.420 
is that the tank army is far more
valuable<00:01:14.390> if<00:01:14.930> the<00:01:15.650> marines<00:01:15.920> had<00:01:16.100> a<00:01:16.130> similar

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
valuable if the marines had a similar

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.010 
valuable if the marines had a similar
cost<00:01:16.820> of<00:01:17.060> the<00:01:17.150> tanks<00:01:17.450> and<00:01:17.570> we<00:01:17.630> fought<00:01:17.870> them

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
cost of the tanks and we fought them

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.020 
cost of the tanks and we fought them
again<00:01:18.320> we<00:01:19.040> can<00:01:19.190> see<00:01:19.370> that<00:01:19.400> the<00:01:19.610> trades<00:01:19.880> are

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
again we can see that the trades are

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.900 
again we can see that the trades are
about<00:01:20.210> even<00:01:20.950> like<00:01:21.950> I<00:01:22.070> said<00:01:22.340> we<00:01:22.520> all<00:01:22.700> should

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:22.910 
about even like I said we all should

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:24.220 
about even like I said we all should
know<00:01:23.030> that<00:01:23.180> tanks<00:01:23.450> are<00:01:23.600> a<00:01:23.630> good<00:01:23.900> answer<00:01:24.110> to

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:24.230 
know that tanks are a good answer to

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:26.530 
know that tanks are a good answer to
Marines<00:01:24.620> in<00:01:24.740> mass<00:01:24.950> numbers<00:01:25.430> but<00:01:26.030> the<00:01:26.180> point<00:01:26.420> is

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:26.540 
Marines in mass numbers but the point is

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:27.910 
Marines in mass numbers but the point is
that<00:01:26.570> the<00:01:26.810> cost<00:01:27.020> of<00:01:27.200> the<00:01:27.260> Army's<00:01:27.560> will<00:01:27.710> largely

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
that the cost of the Army's will largely

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.310 
that the cost of the Army's will largely
determine<00:01:28.280> the<00:01:28.610> success<00:01:29.000> we<00:01:29.870> can<00:01:29.900> very<00:01:30.230> easily

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
determine the success we can very easily

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.410 
determine the success we can very easily
see<00:01:30.770> that<00:01:30.950> a<00:01:31.130> larger<00:01:31.550> mixed<00:01:31.820> army<00:01:32.060> will<00:01:32.210> win

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
see that a larger mixed army will win

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.060 
see that a larger mixed army will win
fights<00:01:32.750> effortlessly<00:01:33.290> against<00:01:33.650> a<00:01:33.770> smaller
