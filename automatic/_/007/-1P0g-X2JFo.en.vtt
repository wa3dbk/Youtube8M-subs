00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
but if I did let's say I'm right I would

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.600 
but if I did let's say I'm right I would
answer<00:01:52.259> it<00:01:52.409> now<00:01:52.470> would<00:01:52.560> go<00:01:52.740> to<00:01:52.799> purple<00:01:53.399> because

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
answer it now would go to purple because

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.030 
answer it now would go to purple because
that<00:01:53.820> is<00:01:53.939> the<00:01:54.030> color<00:01:54.210> of<00:01:54.299> the<00:01:54.450> question<00:01:54.890> now<00:01:55.890> if

question<00:02:43.530> you<00:02:43.830> may<00:02:43.980> get<00:02:44.160> multiple<00:02:44.610> questions

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
question you may get multiple questions

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.460 
question you may get multiple questions
depending<00:02:45.090> on<00:02:45.360> how<00:02:45.540> far<00:02:45.780> the<00:02:45.960> question<00:02:46.290> gets

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
depending on how far the question gets

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.560 
depending on how far the question gets
around<00:02:46.650> the<00:02:46.800> table<00:02:47.130> if<00:02:47.250> everyone<00:02:48.210> misses<00:02:48.420> a

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
around the table if everyone misses a

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.060 
around the table if everyone misses a
question<00:02:48.990> the<00:02:49.260> one<00:02:49.410> that<00:02:49.530> you<00:02:49.590> missed<00:02:49.830> first

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
question the one that you missed first

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:51.980 
question the one that you missed first
it<00:02:50.640> would<00:02:50.850> come<00:02:51.060> back<00:02:51.090> to<00:02:51.390> you<00:02:51.480> with<00:02:51.600> the<00:02:51.720> next

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
purple question you would get the green

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.690 
purple question you would get the green
one<00:02:54.900> after<00:02:55.530> everyone<00:02:55.920> else<00:02:55.950> missed<00:02:56.340> that<00:02:56.550> one

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
one after everyone else missed that one

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.090 
one after everyone else missed that one
and<00:02:57.630> your<00:02:57.750> objective<00:02:58.170> is<00:02:58.290> to<00:02:58.320> get<00:02:58.500> all<00:02:58.740> the<00:02:58.770> way

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:26.900 
is the logo board game by Spin Master
now<00:03:24.660> I<00:03:25.350> have<00:03:25.800> some<00:03:26.010> pros<00:03:26.250> and<00:03:26.280> cons<00:03:26.490> to<00:03:26.760> this

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
now I have some pros and cons to this

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:28.340 
now I have some pros and cons to this
game<00:03:27.060> but<00:03:27.150> the<00:03:27.270> Pro<00:03:27.480> and<00:03:27.630> the<00:03:27.690> con<00:03:27.900> are<00:03:28.110> really

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
game but the Pro and the con are really

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.110 
game but the Pro and the con are really
the<00:03:28.470> same<00:03:28.709> thing<00:03:28.740> the<00:03:29.250> pro<00:03:29.459> is<00:03:29.640> that<00:03:29.820> this<00:03:29.940> is

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
the same thing the pro is that this is

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.750 
the same thing the pro is that this is
all<00:03:30.420> knowledge<00:03:30.930> based<00:03:31.410> so<00:03:31.980> if<00:03:32.130> you<00:03:32.250> know<00:03:32.490> more

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
all knowledge based so if you know more

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.640 
all knowledge based so if you know more
than<00:03:32.880> everyone<00:03:33.180> else<00:03:33.360> you<00:03:33.600> should<00:03:33.990> win<00:03:34.470> the

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
than everyone else you should win the

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.140 
than everyone else you should win the
game<00:03:34.830> now<00:03:35.070> that's<00:03:35.459> not<00:03:35.640> entirely<00:03:35.940> true

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
game now that's not entirely true

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:37.340 
game now that's not entirely true
because<00:03:36.570> if<00:03:36.720> you<00:03:36.810> just<00:03:36.959> get<00:03:37.110> the<00:03:37.230> right

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
because if you just get the right

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.830 
because if you just get the right
question<00:03:37.890> in<00:03:38.040> the<00:03:38.130> right<00:03:38.250> color<00:03:38.550> you<00:03:39.150> can<00:03:39.540> jump

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
question in the right color you can jump

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.630 
question in the right color you can jump
ahead<00:03:39.959> because<00:03:40.380> sometimes<00:03:40.860> it's<00:03:41.070> not<00:03:41.190> evenly

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
ahead because sometimes it's not evenly

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.790 
ahead because sometimes it's not evenly
balanced<00:03:42.090> a<00:03:42.209> purple<00:03:42.810> may<00:03:42.989> not<00:03:43.170> be<00:03:43.320> close<00:03:43.530> but<00:03:43.770> a

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:43.800 
balanced a purple may not be close but a

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.220 
balanced a purple may not be close but a
green<00:03:44.040> you<00:03:44.910> have<00:03:45.030> a<00:03:45.090> green<00:03:45.330> question<00:03:45.510> you<00:03:45.900> skip

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
green you have a green question you skip

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.530 
green you have a green question you skip
past<00:03:46.470> purples<00:03:47.100> and<00:03:47.190> yellows<00:03:47.280> and<00:03:47.550> reds<00:03:47.910> and<00:03:48.090> go

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
past purples and yellows and reds and go

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.300 
past purples and yellows and reds and go
way<00:03:48.720> further<00:03:48.930> than<00:03:49.230> you<00:03:49.530> maybe<00:03:49.800> should<00:03:50.100> have

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
way further than you maybe should have

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.000 
way further than you maybe should have
for<00:03:50.489> getting<00:03:50.670> a<00:03:50.760> question<00:03:50.940> right<00:03:51.300> but<00:03:52.050> you're

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
for getting a question right but you're

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:54.890 
for getting a question right but you're
going<00:03:53.190> to<00:03:53.280> do<00:03:53.700> well<00:03:53.940> if<00:03:54.180> you<00:03:54.209> know<00:03:54.540> a<00:03:54.570> lot<00:03:54.870> about

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
going to do well if you know a lot about

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.810 
going to do well if you know a lot about
consumerism<00:03:55.890> and<00:03:56.160> that's<00:03:56.340> kind<00:03:56.640> of<00:03:56.700> the

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:56.820 
consumerism and that's kind of the

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.310 
consumerism and that's kind of the
downside<00:03:57.060> as<00:03:57.480> well<00:03:57.630> as<00:03:57.750> it<00:03:57.840> makes<00:03:57.989> me<00:03:58.140> feel<00:03:58.290> a

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:58.320 
downside as well as it makes me feel a

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:59.960 
downside as well as it makes me feel a
little<00:03:58.470> bit<00:03:58.650> bad<00:03:58.890> about<00:03:58.920> myself<00:03:59.280> for<00:03:59.700> knowing
