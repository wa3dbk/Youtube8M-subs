00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.059
 but that sounds funny too 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:11.799
 there are families and the clouds 

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:13.450
 I would now like to briefly introduce once 

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:15.280
 the families are divided according to 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:17.170
 depending on the height 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.029
 they occur in the atmosphere 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:21.910
 the top floor is like this 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:23.920
 about 7 to 13 kilometers in height 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:26.529
 and there is the partial to minus 60 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:29.320
 Cold is this spring or 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:30.070
 Cirrus clouds pure from ice crystals and 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.480
 through the high wind speeds 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.580
 you see that too 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:36.010
 the fusel tauss here we have one 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:38.680
 cirousse us - together with a ciro 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:41.260
 cumulus a floor deeper so between 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.760
 three and seven kilometers altitude 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.159
 We are in the middle of high floor here 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:47.110
 the old cumulus clouds are at home 

00:00:45.159 --> 00:00:49.629
 old customer must that is a cumulus 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:51.010
 Cloud here in front of a street 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:53.170
 So in a layer of clouds 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.720
 it has partly been converted 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.670
 from ice to water partly still one 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.290
 The temperatures are lower around the floor 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.400
 zero degrees that means we usually have 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:02.440
 pure water clouds 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.119
 here are the strategies shapes clouds too 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.670
 home here we have a status 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:08.380
 nebulos seen from above that it is one 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.579
 schicht works that we know when we are in 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.799
 have winter high pressure 

00:01:09.579 --> 00:01:14.320
 under these status clouds it is gray 

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:16.180
 dull cute and cold so we go 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.829
 rather to the beautiful clouds namely to 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:20.020
 the spring clouds the spring clouds 

00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:21.399
 belong to the family of vertical 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:23.439
 clouds partly extend from 

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:25.119
 at the bottom to the top 

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:26.859
 but this is the first one 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:29.590
 nursery of the source clouds 

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:30.729
 cumulus hummels cumulus in medio chris 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.729
 only under very good conditions 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:36.280
 grow into capital thunderstorm clouds 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:38.710
 then we have such a communen 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.140
 in the bus kapella tus is from whole 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.789
 down here what is there water 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.570
 get further up the colder it gets 

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:45.640
 it up here 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:48.549
 the ice and the zirn screen itself 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:51.069
 expand if the top part of the 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:53.079
 troop break abut that was so far 

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:55.530
 little excursion into the family life of 

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:55.530
 clouds
