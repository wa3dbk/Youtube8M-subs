what that profile looks like and so what

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.320 
what that profile looks like and so what
we're<00:01:20.430> going<00:01:20.520> to<00:01:20.580> do<00:01:20.790> is<00:01:21.000> we're<00:01:21.150> going<00:01:21.240> to

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
we're going to do is we're going to

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.310 
we're going to do is we're going to
break<00:01:21.600> down<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:22.200> profile<00:01:22.650> into<00:01:23.509> two<00:01:24.509> areas<00:01:25.020> in

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
break down the profile into two areas in

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.980 
break down the profile into two areas in
order<00:01:25.680> to<00:01:25.799> most<00:01:26.430> effectively<00:01:27.060> answer<00:01:27.450> this

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
order to most effectively answer this

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.980 
order to most effectively answer this
question<00:01:28.590> and<00:01:28.770> by<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.369> way<00:01:29.549> it's<00:01:30.329> pretty<00:01:30.810> much

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
question and by the way it's pretty much

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.109 
question and by the way it's pretty much
the<00:01:31.259> same<00:01:31.290> process<00:01:32.250> that<00:01:32.280> you<00:01:32.700> should<00:01:32.909> go

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
the same process that you should go

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.440 
the same process that you should go
through<00:01:33.479> when<00:01:33.960> developing<00:01:34.650> what<00:01:35.189> is<00:01:35.939> commonly

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
through when developing what is commonly

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.260 
through when developing what is commonly
referred<00:01:36.600> to<00:01:37.079> as<00:01:37.560> your<00:01:38.150> 30-second<00:01:39.150> elevator

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.740 
speech
the<00:01:40.890> same<00:01:41.130> answer<00:01:41.490> would<00:01:41.820> probably<00:01:41.850> are<00:01:42.630> the

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
the same answer would probably are the

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.100 
the same answer would probably are the
same<00:01:42.960> presentation<00:01:43.619> would<00:01:44.220> work<00:01:45.090> both<00:01:45.780> for

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
same presentation would work both for

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.460 
same presentation would work both for
your<00:01:46.500> elevator<00:01:47.009> pitch<00:01:47.100> and<00:01:47.630> for<00:01:48.630> answering
