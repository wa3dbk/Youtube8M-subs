00:00:04.079 --> 00:00:10.510
 Hi, I'm Alberto and in this video I'm going 

00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:13.630
 to show how we will proceed to start 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:15.929
 the brushcutter first when 

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:19.380
 we already have our machine mounted 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:22.080
 we will fill the fuel 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:25.490
 with unleaded gasoline and oil 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.490
 2% synthetic 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:32.990
 we will take the machine for it the 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:36.220
 carburetor mounts a small membrane 

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:39.170
 we will press it until the fuel 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:41.440
 returns to the tank by the tube 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:44.440
 transparent 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:51.329
 once we have seen how the 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:51.329
 fuel we put the starter locked 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:59.970
 we put the button in position 1 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:02.910
 and we will start 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:06.030
 the brush cutters mount a starter 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:09.150
 easy it 's important not to hit her 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:12.020
 from the beginning you can break the 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.020
 pier that carries inside 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:19.590
 an advice that I will give you after its use 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:22.500
 and check the status of the filter and the 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.790
 Spark plug are two very easy steps to 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.790
 perform 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:31.240
 to access the filter we remove the 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:33.510
 screw on the top we take the 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.510
 top 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.220
 and we take out the foam 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:44.240
 that carries 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:47.090
 the clean up with soap and water we 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:49.600
 we will make sure to dry it well and 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:53.140
 we will put back 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:55.950
 It is important that it is well dry before 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.950
 to ride it 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:04.240
 the spark plug is very easy to check the 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:08.030
 since it's on top of the 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:11.370
 engine in a very accessible place 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:13.769
 we remove the pipette 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.220
 and with the spark plug wrench attached to 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:16.220
 the machine 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:24.980
 we loose it 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:27.440
 and we will finish it with the hand 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:31.970
 we will make sure that the spark plug is not 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:36.940
 neither greased nor wet with gasoline if 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:36.940
 is wet our machine will not start 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:42.090
 we put it back together 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.879
 always with your hand 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:49.069
 and we'll just tighten it with the key 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:49.069
 of spark plugs that we attached to the machine 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:55.420
 to keep the machine is important 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:58.940
 empty the fuel tank 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:02.420
 tear it off and leave it on until 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:04.120
 stop if we do these steps on 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:07.610
 next day that we can use it 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:10.370
 will start without any problem 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:12.310
 if we do not empty the fuel and 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:15.650
 we leave the carburetor full of gas 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:18.770
 We will be a plug with oil 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:22.480
 evaporates the gasoline leaving the part of 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:22.480
 oil in the carburetor
