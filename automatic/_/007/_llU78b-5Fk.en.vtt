00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.060
 where 

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:14.590
 tired of mixing with this program 

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:14.590
 shit that brings your mixer 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.910
 good i am rabat or crazy 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:39.620
 to configure virtual dj 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.620
 for your mixer 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.750
 the first that we have to do 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.750
 to download 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:52.190
 I leave the pure version 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:58.970
 the downloads 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:10.150
 in the folder 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:13.150
 and then we execute 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:13.150
 realistic 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.270
 when we already have it 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.540
 then to the folder where we have 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.540
 installed 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.560
 and we look for the virtual dj vale 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.299
 what does this 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.200
 replace and good 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.549
 we always have it 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:12.080
 then to make it compatible with 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:12.080
 our mixer 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:26.250
 we unloaded and as before we 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.250
 alarte is download 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.640
 and this folder is worth 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.390
 we open 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:58.920
 that open folder and we go to documents 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:06.650
 and this time in documents 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.650
 on the 2nd hard drive 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:24.850
 It will be empty but I already 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.850
 I have already stuck it then 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.159
 or if 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.819
 and will ask us if they want to pass or anything 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:35.569
 why not 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:35.569
 see you in the next 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:44.670
 how 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:00.090
 configuration 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:03.150
 and here it will come out 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:04.650
 the ticket exits and that 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.950
 I think it's already set up I do not 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.950
 agreement 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:20.660

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:27.750
 I'll leave the mouse still here 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:46.490
 let's load a song 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:46.490
 and why not 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:05:00.650
 I do not have the sound through the speakers 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.650
 then I was like the voice 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.110
 I just for the mixer 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:31.310
