this is a cardboard container which is

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.469 
this is a cardboard container which is
great<00:01:16.170> because<00:01:16.560> it<00:01:17.189> is<00:01:18.140> recyclable<00:01:19.189> material

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:20.479

application<00:02:30.220> um<00:02:31.500> the<00:02:32.500> thing<00:02:32.769> that<00:02:32.980> is<00:02:33.160> really

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
application um the thing that is really

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:36.300 
application um the thing that is really
good<00:02:33.760> about<00:02:33.880> this<00:02:34.239> is<00:02:34.569> and<00:02:35.260> this<00:02:35.950> is<00:02:36.010> what<00:02:36.280> i

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
good about this is and this is what i

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:37.860 
good about this is and this is what i
have<00:02:36.519> on<00:02:36.549> today<00:02:36.849> and<00:02:37.239> i<00:02:37.420> do<00:02:37.480> have<00:02:37.660> a<00:02:37.750> little

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
have on today and i do have a little

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.559 
have on today and i do have a little
finishing<00:02:38.260> powder<00:02:38.590> over<00:02:39.010> it<00:02:39.040> but<00:02:39.459> i<00:02:39.970> think<00:02:40.450> it

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:40.569 
finishing powder over it but i think it

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:44.100 
finishing powder over it but i think it
gives<00:02:40.720> really<00:02:41.049> good<00:02:41.140> coverage<00:02:42.480> not<00:02:43.480> quite<00:02:43.870> as

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
gives really good coverage not quite as

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:49.440 
gives really good coverage not quite as
good<00:02:44.380> as<00:02:44.680> the<00:02:45.750> the<00:02:46.750> loose<00:02:47.019> mineral<00:02:47.470> um<00:02:48.450> powder

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
good as the the loose mineral um powder

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.100 
good as the the loose mineral um powder
of<00:02:49.870> there's<00:02:50.340> but<00:02:51.340> it's<00:02:51.370> it's<00:02:52.060> okay<00:02:52.810> if<00:02:52.959> you're

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
of there's but it's it's okay if you're

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.340 
of there's but it's it's okay if you're
in<00:02:53.260> a<00:02:53.319> hurry<00:02:53.350> I<00:02:54.340> prefer<00:02:54.760> the<00:02:55.000> loose<00:02:55.480> stuff<00:02:56.049> like

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350 
in a hurry I prefer the loose stuff like

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:58.410 
in a hurry I prefer the loose stuff like
I<00:02:56.380> think<00:02:56.889> I<00:02:56.980> get<00:02:57.220> a<00:02:57.250> better<00:02:57.549> coverage<00:02:58.120> and<00:02:58.359> I

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
I think I get a better coverage and I

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.449 
I think I get a better coverage and I
think<00:02:58.600> it<00:02:58.720> covers<00:02:58.900> my<00:02:59.230> pores<00:02:59.590> and<00:02:59.950> fills<00:03:00.190> in<00:03:00.340> my

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
think it covers my pores and fills in my

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:02.879 
think it covers my pores and fills in my
pores<00:03:00.730> better<00:03:01.030> but<00:03:01.870> what<00:03:02.260> this<00:03:02.410> is<00:03:02.470> really

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:02.889 
pores better but what this is really

00:03:02.889 --> 00:03:07.770 
pores better but what this is really
good<00:03:03.190> for<00:03:03.959> is<00:03:04.959> concealing<00:03:05.889> so<00:03:06.700> I<00:03:07.150> used<00:03:07.450> it<00:03:07.600> for

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
good for is concealing so I used it for

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.530 
good for is concealing so I used it for
concealer<00:03:08.410> and<00:03:08.650> then<00:03:08.709> I<00:03:08.889> did<00:03:09.190> buff<00:03:09.430> it<00:03:09.609> into<00:03:09.760> my

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
concealer and then I did buff it into my

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.410 
concealer and then I did buff it into my
pores<00:03:10.870> and<00:03:11.170> for<00:03:11.440> that<00:03:11.790> believe<00:03:12.790> it<00:03:12.880> or<00:03:12.940> not<00:03:13.090> I'm

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
for my concealer it picks up a lot of a

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.440 
for my concealer it picks up a lot of a
lot<00:03:26.680> of<00:03:26.799> product<00:03:27.250> and<00:03:27.609> it<00:03:27.910> works<00:03:28.120> really

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
lot of product and it works really

lot of product and it works really
really<00:03:28.599> well<00:03:28.840> so<00:03:31.440> when<00:03:32.440> i<00:03:32.470> purchased<00:03:32.739> this

00:03:33.059 --> 00:03:33.069 
really well so when i purchased this

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:37.409 
really well so when i purchased this
again<00:03:33.870> mmm<00:03:34.870> i<00:03:35.669> don't<00:03:36.669> know<00:03:36.760> if<00:03:37.060> i<00:03:37.269> was

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:37.419 
again mmm i don't know if i was

00:03:37.419 --> 00:03:39.900 
again mmm i don't know if i was
purchasing<00:03:38.319> the<00:03:38.500> custom<00:03:39.040> kit<00:03:39.340> i<00:03:39.579> probably

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 
purchasing the custom kit i probably

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:44.490 
purchasing the custom kit i probably
would<00:03:40.980> just<00:03:41.980> because<00:03:42.489> of<00:03:43.060> the<00:03:43.900> fact<00:03:44.169> that<00:03:44.319> I<00:03:44.440> do

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
would just because of the fact that I do

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.339 
would just because of the fact that I do
like<00:03:44.859> it<00:03:45.010> for<00:03:45.190> concealer<00:03:45.790> am<00:03:46.299> I<00:03:46.810> going<00:03:46.989> to<00:03:47.079> use

00:03:47.339 --> 00:03:47.349 
like it for concealer am I going to use

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:51.610 
like it for concealer am I going to use
it<00:03:47.560> a<00:03:47.799> lot<00:03:48.190> as<00:03:48.609> my<00:03:49.389> powder

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 
it a lot as my powder

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.470 
it a lot as my powder
why<00:03:51.950> not<00:03:52.129> really<00:03:52.340> this<00:03:52.700> is<00:03:52.879> basically<00:03:53.360> a

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 
why not really this is basically a

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.420 
why not really this is basically a
concentrated<00:03:54.290> version<00:03:54.530> of<00:03:54.890> the<00:03:55.220> loose

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
concentrated version of the loose

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.059 
concentrated version of the loose
minerals<00:03:55.940> that<00:03:56.180> they<00:03:56.330> have<00:03:56.540> and<00:03:56.870> as<00:03:57.709> you<00:03:57.890> can

00:03:58.059 --> 00:03:58.069 
minerals that they have and as you can

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:01.360 
minerals that they have and as you can
see<00:03:58.099> it's<00:03:58.580> not<00:03:58.879> very<00:03:59.090> pink<00:03:59.450> so<00:03:59.930> it's<00:04:00.680> it's<00:04:01.220> a

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.370 
see it's not very pink so it's it's a

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:04.660 
see it's not very pink so it's it's a
lot<00:04:01.640> more<00:04:01.840> tan<00:04:02.840> or<00:04:03.349> buff-colored<00:04:03.830> than<00:04:04.640> I

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:04.670 
lot more tan or buff-colored than I

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:06.220 
lot more tan or buff-colored than I
thought<00:04:04.970> it<00:04:05.030> was<00:04:05.239> going<00:04:05.390> to<00:04:05.450> be<00:04:05.629> it's<00:04:05.930> a<00:04:06.049> good

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.230 
thought it was going to be it's a good

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:10.660 
thought it was going to be it's a good
match<00:04:06.440> for<00:04:06.470> me<00:04:06.920> but<00:04:07.930> so<00:04:08.930> anyway<00:04:09.319> if<00:04:09.680> you<00:04:10.459> have<00:04:10.640> a

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:10.670 
match for me but so anyway if you have a

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:13.569 
match for me but so anyway if you have a
stippling<00:04:11.060> brush<00:04:11.650> and<00:04:12.650> you're<00:04:13.129> getting<00:04:13.430> the

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:13.579 
stippling brush and you're getting the

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:16.800 
stippling brush and you're getting the
kit<00:04:13.819> I<00:04:14.120> would<00:04:14.480> suggest<00:04:14.930> getting<00:04:15.379> this

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810 
kit I would suggest getting this

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:19.840 
kit I would suggest getting this
personally<00:04:17.810> I<00:04:18.169> would<00:04:18.650> give<00:04:18.859> it<00:04:19.010> probably

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:19.850 
personally I would give it probably

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:25.659 
personally I would give it probably
between<00:04:20.359> a<00:04:20.930> I<00:04:22.870> would<00:04:23.870> give<00:04:24.020> it<00:04:24.139> a<00:04:24.400> four<00:04:25.400> to<00:04:25.639> A

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:25.669 
between a I would give it a four to A

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:28.150 
between a I would give it a four to A
five<00:04:26.060> if<00:04:26.600> you're<00:04:27.530> going<00:04:27.620> to<00:04:27.680> use<00:04:27.800> it<00:04:28.010> as<00:04:28.130> a

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.160 
five if you're going to use it as a

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.370 
five if you're going to use it as a
concealer<00:04:28.610> i<00:04:29.060> would<00:04:29.360> probably<00:04:29.690> as<00:04:30.320> a

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:30.380 
concealer i would probably as a

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:32.950 
concealer i would probably as a
foundation<00:04:30.979> just<00:04:31.550> because<00:04:31.850> you<00:04:31.970> have<00:04:32.180> to<00:04:32.449> baby

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960 
foundation just because you have to baby

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.680 
foundation just because you have to baby
it<00:04:33.110> along<00:04:33.500> and<00:04:33.919> put<00:04:34.190> it<00:04:34.280> on<00:04:34.400> with<00:04:34.610> this<00:04:34.820> and<00:04:35.360> you

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:35.690 
it along and put it on with this and you

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:37.659 
it along and put it on with this and you
can't<00:04:35.990> get<00:04:36.169> too<00:04:36.350> heavy<00:04:36.620> with<00:04:36.830> the<00:04:36.979> application

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:37.669 
can't get too heavy with the application

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:42.969 
can't get too heavy with the application
I<00:04:37.940> probably<00:04:38.570> only<00:04:39.020> give<00:04:39.289> it<00:04:39.320> a<00:04:39.470> three<00:04:40.510> the<00:04:41.979> you

00:04:42.969 --> 00:04:42.979

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:45.430 
I probably only give it a three the you
know<00:04:43.100> like<00:04:43.370> I<00:04:43.520> said<00:04:43.760> I<00:04:44.030> I<00:04:44.270> do<00:04:44.570> like<00:04:45.050> that<00:04:45.380> it's
