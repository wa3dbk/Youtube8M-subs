Box aside and get to the actual hardware

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.160 
Box aside and get to the actual hardware
which<00:01:15.759> is<00:01:15.939> the<00:01:16.060> start<00:01:16.329> of<00:01:16.390> the<00:01:16.450> show<00:01:16.659> here<00:01:16.960> and

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170 
which is the start of the show here and

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.149 
which is the start of the show here and
there<00:01:17.590> it<00:01:17.890> is<00:01:17.920> the<00:01:19.079> motorola<00:01:20.079> droid<00:01:20.829> razr<00:01:20.860> HD

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:21.159 
there it is the motorola droid razr HD

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:24.779 
there it is the motorola droid razr HD
and<00:01:22.710> right<00:01:23.710> off<00:01:23.829> the<00:01:23.950> bat<00:01:24.130> you<00:01:24.280> can<00:01:24.430> see<00:01:24.609> this

00:01:24.779 --> 00:01:24.789 
and right off the bat you can see this

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:26.910 
and right off the bat you can see this
new<00:01:25.030> textured<00:01:25.930> back<00:01:26.140> obviously<00:01:26.439> this<00:01:26.740> is

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:26.920 
new textured back obviously this is

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.039 
new textured back obviously this is
similar<00:01:27.130> to<00:01:27.280> the<00:01:27.430> original<00:01:27.520> RAZR<00:01:28.000> as<00:01:28.299> we<00:01:28.899> have

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:29.049 
similar to the original RAZR as we have

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:31.440 
similar to the original RAZR as we have
the<00:01:29.289> kevlar<00:01:30.219> coating<00:01:30.250> but<00:01:30.789> it's<00:01:30.909> it's<00:01:31.270> been

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:31.450 
the kevlar coating but it's it's been

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.690 
the kevlar coating but it's it's been
slightly<00:01:32.170> change<00:01:32.710> it's<00:01:32.920> a<00:01:32.979> little<00:01:33.189> softer<00:01:33.579> and

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700 
slightly change it's a little softer and

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.340 
slightly change it's a little softer and
obviously<00:01:34.000> coach<00:01:34.270> the<00:01:34.450> entire<00:01:34.780> back<00:01:35.079> of<00:01:35.109> the

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
obviously coach the entire back of the

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.380 
obviously coach the entire back of the
device<00:01:35.469> so<00:01:36.310> it<00:01:36.369> should<00:01:36.549> be<00:01:36.579> extremely<00:01:36.909> scratch

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390 
device so it should be extremely scratch

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:39.990 
device so it should be extremely scratch
resistant<00:01:38.049> and<00:01:38.280> not<00:01:39.280> good<00:01:39.460> all<00:01:39.549> scuffed<00:01:39.820> up

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 
resistant and not good all scuffed up

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.789 
resistant and not good all scuffed up
like<00:01:40.210> before<00:01:40.630> then<00:01:41.170> we<00:01:41.259> do<00:01:41.380> still<00:01:41.619> have<00:01:41.679> a

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:41.799 
like before then we do still have a

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:43.050 
like before then we do still have a
little<00:01:41.950> bit<00:01:42.039> of<00:01:42.130> aluminum<00:01:42.640> here<00:01:42.880> they've

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
little bit of aluminum here they've

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.609 
little bit of aluminum here they've
wrapped<00:01:43.630> the<00:01:43.780> whole<00:01:43.960> phone<00:01:44.200> here<00:01:44.469> in<00:01:44.530> an

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:44.619 
wrapped the whole phone here in an

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:47.849 
wrapped the whole phone here in an
aluminum<00:01:45.030> aluminum<00:01:46.030> bezel<00:01:46.479> and<00:01:46.869> as<00:01:47.590> you<00:01:47.740> can

00:01:47.849 --> 00:01:47.859 
aluminum aluminum bezel and as you can

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:50.160 
aluminum aluminum bezel and as you can
see<00:01:47.890> the<00:01:48.189> phone's<00:01:48.399> extremely<00:01:49.090> thin<00:01:49.479> it<00:01:49.990> is<00:01:50.049> a

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
see the phone's extremely thin it is a

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.649 
see the phone's extremely thin it is a
droid<00:01:50.469> razr<00:01:50.710> so<00:01:50.979> that<00:01:51.130> is<00:01:51.280> expected<00:01:52.090> and<00:01:52.479> it

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:52.659 
droid razr so that is expected and it

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:54.480 
droid razr so that is expected and it
slightly<00:01:53.259> curves<00:01:53.829> up<00:01:54.070> here<00:01:54.249> just<00:01:54.429> very

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 
slightly curves up here just very

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.080 
slightly curves up here just very

mirror mode straight up to the TV then
around<00:03:33.040> bottom<00:03:33.490> we<00:03:33.640> have<00:03:33.790> a<00:03:33.820> couple<00:03:34.060> of<00:03:34.270> screws

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
around bottom we have a couple of screws

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:36.210 
around bottom we have a couple of screws
here<00:03:35.050> which<00:03:35.200> we've<00:03:35.410> been<00:03:35.590> seeing<00:03:35.800> lately<00:03:35.890> on

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 
here which we've been seeing lately on

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:38.760 
here which we've been seeing lately on
smartphones<00:03:36.820> and<00:03:37.150> this<00:03:37.990> makes<00:03:38.200> it<00:03:38.350> so<00:03:38.560> the

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:38.770 
smartphones and this makes it so the

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:40.890 
smartphones and this makes it so the
back<00:03:39.070> is<00:03:39.340> actually<00:03:39.880> not<00:03:40.000> removable<00:03:40.480> so<00:03:40.810> the

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
back is actually not removable so the

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.350 
back is actually not removable so the
battery<00:03:41.230> is<00:03:41.290> not<00:03:41.470> removable<00:03:41.730> technically<00:03:42.730> and

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:43.360 
battery is not removable technically and

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.020 
battery is not removable technically and
we<00:03:43.450> do<00:03:43.570> have<00:03:43.720> a<00:03:44.280> 2530<00:03:45.280> milliamp<00:03:45.760> hour<00:03:45.910> battery

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
we do have a 2530 milliamp hour battery
