00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
overeating is one of the cause that

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.049 
overeating is one of the cause that

allows the energy to flow through us the

allows the energy to flow through us the

but<00:01:09.810> it<00:01:09.930> hurts<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.500> individual<00:01:11.100> who<00:01:11.280> does

that and so another one step of changing

your life is coming to the realization
that<00:01:17.700> we<00:01:18.030> only<00:01:18.270> need<00:01:18.600> one<00:01:19.409> meal<00:01:19.920> a<00:01:20.189> day

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
that we only need one meal a day

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.899 
that we only need one meal a day
to<00:01:21.090> change<00:01:21.360> your<00:01:21.570> life<00:01:21.750> now<00:01:22.530> of<00:01:22.710> course<00:01:22.909> this

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
to change your life now of course this

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.390 
to change your life now of course this
is<00:01:24.150> a<00:01:24.180> gradual<00:01:24.780> process<00:01:25.020> and<00:01:25.380> we<00:01:25.740> can't<00:01:26.040> if

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
is a gradual process and we can't if

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.700 
is a gradual process and we can't if
someone<00:01:26.549> is<00:01:27.060> eating<00:01:27.390> three<00:01:27.900> four<00:01:28.170> five<00:01:28.470> and

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
someone is eating three four five and

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.010 
someone is eating three four five and
six<00:01:28.890> meals<00:01:29.100> a<00:01:29.280> day<00:01:29.310> I'm<00:01:30.030> not<00:01:30.299> asking<00:01:30.750> for<00:01:30.780> you

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
six meals a day I'm not asking for you

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.109 
six meals a day I'm not asking for you
to<00:01:31.170> start<00:01:31.710> immediately<00:01:32.340> to<00:01:32.490> eat<00:01:32.640> one<00:01:32.909> meal

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
to start immediately to eat one meal

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.999 
to start immediately to eat one meal
that's<00:01:33.630> not<00:01:34.200> how<00:01:34.409> it<00:01:34.619> works

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
that's not how it works

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.420 
that's not how it works
it's<00:01:35.670> a<00:01:35.880> gradual<00:01:36.479> process<00:01:36.540> and<00:01:37.439> so<00:01:37.890> one<00:01:38.189> of<00:01:38.340> the

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
it's a gradual process and so one of the

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.940 
it's a gradual process and so one of the
ways<00:01:38.640> that<00:01:39.090> will<00:01:39.600> lead<00:01:39.869> you<00:01:40.079> to<00:01:40.110> that<00:01:40.439> is<00:01:40.680> to

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
ways that will lead you to that is to

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.399 
ways that will lead you to that is to
start<00:01:41.159> fasting<00:01:41.970> one<00:01:42.540> day<00:01:42.750> out<00:01:43.079> of<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.320> month

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
start fasting one day out of the month

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.359 
start fasting one day out of the month
and<00:01:43.920> over<00:01:44.880> time<00:01:45.180> your<00:01:46.079> stomach<00:01:46.710> will<00:01:46.979> shrink

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
and over time your stomach will shrink

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.030 
and over time your stomach will shrink
and<00:01:47.670> so<00:01:48.630> in<00:01:48.810> time<00:01:49.110> you'll<00:01:49.409> come<00:01:49.439> to<00:01:49.920> the

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
and so in time you'll come to the

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.800 
and so in time you'll come to the
realization<00:01:50.670> or<00:01:50.850> should<00:01:51.030> I<00:01:51.090> say<00:01:51.270> the

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
realization or should I say the

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.929 
realization or should I say the
knowledge<00:01:52.020> of<00:01:52.320> that<00:01:52.439> you<00:01:52.799> can<00:01:52.979> only<00:01:53.189> eat<00:01:53.549> one

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
knowledge of that you can only eat one

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.319 
knowledge of that you can only eat one
meal<00:01:54.149> a<00:01:54.210> day<00:01:54.360> and<00:01:54.780> when<00:01:55.619> that<00:01:55.770> happens<00:01:56.520> you

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
meal a day and when that happens you

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.120 
meal a day and when that happens you
will<00:01:57.509> get<00:01:57.659> a<00:01:57.689> better<00:01:57.990> flow<00:01:58.320> of<00:01:58.350> energy<00:01:58.979> that

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
will get a better flow of energy that

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.219 
will get a better flow of energy that
flows<00:01:59.310> through<00:01:59.460> you<00:01:59.880> better<00:02:00.210> thoughts<00:02:00.630> better

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
flows through you better thoughts better

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.499 
flows through you better thoughts better
creativity<00:02:02.219> and<00:02:02.430> that<00:02:02.880> will<00:02:03.030> really<00:02:03.240> add

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
creativity and that will really add

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.410 
creativity and that will really add
tremendous<00:02:04.350> value<00:02:04.380> to<00:02:04.890> your<00:02:05.310> life<00:02:05.369> that<00:02:06.240> is
