00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:10.250 

in<00:00:09.090> this<00:00:09.210> blender<00:00:09.599> video<00:00:09.809> we're<00:00:09.960> working<00:00:10.170> with

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
in this blender video we're working with

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.980 
in this blender video we're working with
blender<00:00:10.849> 2.6<00:00:11.849> 0<00:00:12.300> and<00:00:12.599> we're<00:00:12.719> gonna<00:00:12.809> be<00:00:12.900> looking

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
blender 2.6 0 and we're gonna be looking

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.410 
blender 2.6 0 and we're gonna be looking
at<00:00:13.200> the<00:00:13.320> quick<00:00:13.650> smoke<00:00:14.219> feature<00:00:14.610> so<00:00:15.299> we're

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
at the quick smoke feature so we're

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.689 
at the quick smoke feature so we're
going<00:00:15.509> to<00:00:15.599> go<00:00:15.630> into<00:00:15.780> detail<00:00:16.410> on<00:00:16.440> making<00:00:16.949> real

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
going to go into detail on making real

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.970 
going to go into detail on making real
realistic<00:00:18.330> looking<00:00:19.050> smoke<00:00:19.439> there's<00:00:19.710> a<00:00:19.770> lot<00:00:19.949> of

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
realistic looking smoke there's a lot of

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.279 
realistic looking smoke there's a lot of
you<00:00:20.189> can<00:00:20.340> do<00:00:20.460> with<00:00:20.609> textures<00:00:21.090> it's<00:00:21.990> great<00:00:22.109> that

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
you can do with textures it's great that

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:23.210 
you can do with textures it's great that
but<00:00:22.380> I'm<00:00:22.470> going<00:00:22.560> to<00:00:22.619> show<00:00:22.830> you<00:00:22.920> how<00:00:22.980> to<00:00:23.070> just

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
but I'm going to show you how to just

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.519 
but I'm going to show you how to just
create<00:00:23.430> a<00:00:23.580> very<00:00:24.000> quick<00:00:24.269> basic<00:00:24.480> smoke<00:00:25.080> element

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
create a very quick basic smoke element

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.060 
create a very quick basic smoke element
using<00:00:26.099> the<00:00:26.220> quick<00:00:26.430> smoke<00:00:26.990> feature<00:00:27.990> so<00:00:28.920> I'm

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
using the quick smoke feature so I'm

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.679 
using the quick smoke feature so I'm
just<00:00:29.220> going<00:00:29.340> to<00:00:29.400> delete<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:29.730> fault<00:00:29.939> cube<00:00:30.330> and

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
just going to delete the fault cube and

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.610 
just going to delete the fault cube and
then<00:00:30.869> add<00:00:31.170> in<00:00:31.740> a<00:00:31.890> UV<00:00:32.130> sphere<00:00:32.340> and<00:00:33.380> then<00:00:34.380> I<00:00:34.410> hit

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
then add in a UV sphere and then I hit

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.290 
then add in a UV sphere and then I hit
spacebar<00:00:34.890> and<00:00:35.130> i'm<00:00:35.309> going<00:00:35.399> to<00:00:35.460> type<00:00:35.610> in<00:00:35.820> smoke

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
spacebar and i'm going to type in smoke

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.360 
spacebar and i'm going to type in smoke
and<00:00:36.660> you<00:00:36.690> can<00:00:37.170> see<00:00:37.350> quick<00:00:37.590> smoke<00:00:37.800> comes<00:00:38.070> up<00:00:38.250> i'm

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
and you can see quick smoke comes up i'm

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.369 
and you can see quick smoke comes up i'm
going<00:00:38.399> to<00:00:38.550> hit<00:00:38.610> enter<00:00:38.730> voila<00:00:39.480> we<00:00:39.870> have<00:00:40.079> created

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
going to hit enter voila we have created

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:46.340 
going to hit enter voila we have created
a<00:00:41.989> domain<00:00:42.989> object<00:00:43.860> and<00:00:44.040> our<00:00:44.550> ad<00:00:45.020> particles<00:00:46.020> to

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
a domain object and our ad particles to

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.590 
a domain object and our ad particles to
our<00:00:46.590> original<00:00:46.920> sphere<00:00:47.399> object<00:00:47.940> for<00:00:48.300> making

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
our original sphere object for making

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.139 
our original sphere object for making
smoke<00:00:48.899> and<00:00:49.739> go<00:00:49.829> in<00:00:49.950> my<00:00:50.039> camera<00:00:50.280> view<00:00:50.610> here<00:00:50.940> and

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
smoke and go in my camera view here and

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.850 
smoke and go in my camera view here and
i<00:00:51.239> move<00:00:51.390> my<00:00:51.420> camera<00:00:51.809> up<00:00:52.050> a<00:00:52.320> little<00:00:52.530> bit<00:00:52.649> since

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
i move my camera up a little bit since

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.770 
i move my camera up a little bit since
the<00:00:53.010> smoke<00:00:53.280> by<00:00:53.640> default<00:00:53.969> will<00:00:54.180> be<00:00:54.300> moving<00:00:54.660> up

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
the smoke by default will be moving up

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.590 
the smoke by default will be moving up
and<00:00:55.410> if<00:00:55.559> it<00:00:55.649> hit<00:00:55.770> alt<00:00:55.980> a<00:00:56.219> you<00:00:56.309> can<00:00:56.760> see<00:00:57.090> it<00:00:57.270> start

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
and if it hit alt a you can see it start

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.790 
and if it hit alt a you can see it start
to<00:00:57.660> generate<00:00:58.050> some<00:00:59.039> particles<00:00:59.550> of<00:00:59.760> smoke

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800 
to generate some particles of smoke

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.590 
to generate some particles of smoke
moving<00:01:01.800> on<00:01:01.949> up<00:01:01.980> and<00:01:02.370> being<00:01:02.760> limited<00:01:03.000> to<00:01:03.210> our

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
moving on up and being limited to our

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.109 
moving on up and being limited to our
domain<00:01:04.080> cube<00:01:04.559> object<00:01:05.220> that<00:01:05.400> was<00:01:05.580> created<00:01:05.640> when

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
domain cube object that was created when

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.760 
domain cube object that was created when
we<00:01:06.270> ran<00:01:07.020> our<00:01:07.170> quick<00:01:07.650> smoke<00:01:08.430> feature<00:01:09.299> here<00:01:09.770> so

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
we ran our quick smoke feature here so

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.100 
we ran our quick smoke feature here so
now<00:01:10.920> i<00:01:10.950> hit<00:01:11.490> escape<00:01:11.700> and<00:01:12.030> now<00:01:12.510> that<00:01:12.659> these<00:01:12.780> Keys

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
now i hit escape and now that these Keys

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.660 
now i hit escape and now that these Keys
have<00:01:13.229> been<00:01:13.260> generated<00:01:13.530> or<00:01:14.010> keyframes<00:01:14.520> have

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
have been generated or keyframes have

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.010 
have been generated or keyframes have
generated<00:01:15.090> I'm<00:01:15.270> going<00:01:15.390> to<00:01:15.450> hit<00:01:15.509> right<00:01:15.780> arrow

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
generated I'm going to hit right arrow

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.990 
generated I'm going to hit right arrow
to<00:01:16.170> move<00:01:16.350> to<00:01:16.650> a<00:01:16.680> point<00:01:16.890> I<00:01:17.040> like<00:01:17.250> I'm<00:01:17.580> gonna<00:01:17.909> hit

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
to move to a point I like I'm gonna hit

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.300 
to move to a point I like I'm gonna hit
f12<00:01:18.360> to<00:01:18.600> see<00:01:18.810> what<00:01:18.960> it<00:01:19.020> looks<00:01:19.200> like<00:01:19.409> there<00:01:20.220> we

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
f12 to see what it looks like there we

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.950 
f12 to see what it looks like there we
have<00:01:20.400> a<00:01:20.430> cloud<00:01:20.640> of<00:01:20.670> smoke<00:01:20.880> with<00:01:21.360> a<00:01:21.630> gray

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
have a cloud of smoke with a gray

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.260 
have a cloud of smoke with a gray
background<00:01:22.790> I'm<00:01:23.790> going<00:01:23.909> to<00:01:23.970> feel<00:01:24.090> a<00:01:24.150> change

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
background I'm going to feel a change

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.420 
background I'm going to feel a change
background<00:01:24.540> to<00:01:24.750> make<00:01:24.840> that<00:01:24.960> more<00:01:25.110> visible<00:01:25.500> but

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
background to make that more visible but

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:27.890 
background to make that more visible but
let's<00:01:26.640> say<00:01:26.820> we<00:01:26.970> want<00:01:27.150> to<00:01:27.330> and<00:01:27.630> I'm<00:01:27.720> not<00:01:27.810> going

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
let's say we want to and I'm not going

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.770 
let's say we want to and I'm not going
to<00:01:27.960> get<00:01:28.080> into<00:01:28.229> detail<00:01:28.829> too<00:01:29.159> much<00:01:29.340> detail<00:01:29.700> on

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
to get into detail too much detail on

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.120 
to get into detail too much detail on
you<00:01:30.780> know<00:01:30.900> changing<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.560> texture<00:01:31.979> of<00:01:32.009> the

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
you know changing the texture of the

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.770 
you know changing the texture of the
smoke<00:01:32.340> which<00:01:32.549> can<00:01:32.729> change<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.210> look<00:01:33.450> and<00:01:33.570> feel

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
smoke which can change the look and feel

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.289 
smoke which can change the look and feel
of<00:01:33.840> it<00:01:34.020> completely<00:01:34.500> but<00:01:35.220> just<00:01:35.640> show<00:01:35.850> you<00:01:35.909> the

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
of it completely but just show you the

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.539 
of it completely but just show you the
texture<00:01:37.259> of<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.500> smoke<00:01:37.799> and<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.100> material

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
texture of the smoke and the material

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.700 
texture of the smoke and the material
that<00:01:38.700> smoke<00:01:38.880> is<00:01:39.060> based<00:01:39.270> on<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.570> domain<00:01:39.990> object

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
that smoke is based on the domain object

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.170 
that smoke is based on the domain object
that<00:01:40.799> can<00:01:40.920> be<00:01:41.009> confusing<00:01:41.460> since<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:41.850> smoke<00:01:42.060> is

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
that can be confusing since the smoke is

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.240 
that can be confusing since the smoke is
coming<00:01:42.299> off<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:42.630> sphere<00:01:43.020> but<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.860> smoke<00:01:44.100> is

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
coming off the sphere but the smoke is

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.130 
coming off the sphere but the smoke is
actually<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:44.729> domain<00:01:45.060> object<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.780> sphere<00:01:46.049> is

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
actually the domain object the sphere is

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.940 
actually the domain object the sphere is
just<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.619> where<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.189> smoke<00:01:47.399> is<00:01:47.460> coming<00:01:47.790> from

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
just the where the smoke is coming from

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.819 
just the where the smoke is coming from
so<00:01:50.270> with<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.420> cube<00:01:51.899> object<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:52.530> domain

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
so with the cube object the domain

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.330 
so with the cube object the domain
object<00:01:53.689> selected<00:01:54.689> we're<00:01:55.530> going<00:01:55.710> to<00:01:55.920> now<00:01:56.070> go<00:01:56.280> to

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
object selected we're going to now go to

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.240 
object selected we're going to now go to
our<00:01:56.549> materials<00:01:57.149> here<00:01:57.540> and<00:01:57.890> to<00:01:58.890> make<00:01:59.040> I<00:01:59.130> just

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
our materials here and to make I just

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.109 
our materials here and to make I just
want<00:01:59.369> to<00:01:59.399> make<00:01:59.460> the<00:01:59.610> smoke<00:01:59.820> a<00:01:59.850> little<00:01:59.969> bit

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
want to make the smoke a little bit

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.160 
want to make the smoke a little bit
wider<00:02:00.240> because<00:02:00.420> once<00:02:00.630> again<00:02:00.689> if<00:02:00.869> we<00:02:00.899> render

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
wider because once again if we render

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.980 
wider because once again if we render
that<00:02:01.320> out<00:02:01.380> it's<00:02:01.680> a<00:02:01.770> very<00:02:01.979> gray<00:02:02.250> dark<00:02:02.490> smoke<00:02:02.990> and

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
that out it's a very gray dark smoke and

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.810 
that out it's a very gray dark smoke and
I'm<00:02:04.200> just<00:02:04.350> going<00:02:04.469> to<00:02:04.740> basically<00:02:05.009> change<00:02:05.579> the

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
I'm just going to basically change the

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.940 
I'm just going to basically change the
admission<00:02:06.479> right<00:02:06.780> here<00:02:07.170> I'm<00:02:07.560> going<00:02:07.740> to<00:02:07.829> change

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
admission right here I'm going to change

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.480 
admission right here I'm going to change
it<00:02:08.069> to

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:09.490 
it to

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:13.240 
it to
2.3<00:02:10.490> and<00:02:10.660> see<00:02:11.660> how<00:02:11.810> that<00:02:11.870> looks<00:02:12.260> with<00:02:12.650> f12

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
2.3 and see how that looks with f12

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:14.620 
2.3 and see how that looks with f12
there<00:02:13.490> and<00:02:13.670> now<00:02:13.760> we<00:02:13.820> have<00:02:13.940> more<00:02:14.180> of<00:02:14.300> a<00:02:14.390> white

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
there and now we have more of a white

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.590 
there and now we have more of a white
smoke<00:02:15.700> you<00:02:16.700> know<00:02:16.760> as<00:02:16.910> a<00:02:16.940> lot<00:02:17.090> you<00:02:17.210> can<00:02:17.270> do<00:02:17.390> once

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
smoke you know as a lot you can do once

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.140 
smoke you know as a lot you can do once
again<00:02:17.780> with<00:02:17.900> lighting<00:02:18.350> and<00:02:18.560> the<00:02:19.250> materials

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
again with lighting and the materials

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.180 
again with lighting and the materials
and<00:02:20.390> stuff<00:02:20.630> like<00:02:20.810> that<00:02:20.870> and<00:02:21.290> if<00:02:21.920> we<00:02:22.040> go<00:02:22.160> over

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
and stuff like that and if we go over

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.980 
and stuff like that and if we go over
here<00:02:22.550> to<00:02:22.610> our<00:02:22.790> particle<00:02:23.450> settings<00:02:24.820> well

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:25.990 
here to our particle settings well

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:30.730 
here to our particle settings well
physics<00:02:26.990> settings<00:02:27.350> for<00:02:27.680> domain<00:02:29.230> then<00:02:30.230> if<00:02:30.620> we

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:30.740 
physics settings for domain then if we

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:34.180 
physics settings for domain then if we
want<00:02:30.860> to<00:02:31.040> edit<00:02:31.220> the<00:02:31.520> smoke<00:02:32.500> we<00:02:33.500> have<00:02:33.680> particle

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
want to edit the smoke we have particle

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.310 
want to edit the smoke we have particle
settings<00:02:34.520> and<00:02:34.760> physics<00:02:35.180> settings<00:02:35.540> here<00:02:35.930> that

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.320 
settings and physics settings here that

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:37.780 
settings and physics settings here that
we<00:02:36.410> can<00:02:36.440> play<00:02:36.710> with<00:02:36.950> as<00:02:37.130> well<00:02:37.400> so<00:02:37.670> you<00:02:37.760> can

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
we can play with as well so you can

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.180 
we can play with as well so you can
change<00:02:38.060> like<00:02:38.270> the<00:02:38.680> gravity<00:02:39.680> so<00:02:39.860> if<00:02:39.950> you<00:02:40.010> want

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
change like the gravity so if you want

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.880 
change like the gravity so if you want
the<00:02:40.250> smoke<00:02:40.490> to<00:02:40.610> kind<00:02:40.790> of<00:02:40.880> fall<00:02:41.360> down<00:02:41.930> rather

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
the smoke to kind of fall down rather

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.570 
the smoke to kind of fall down rather
than<00:02:43.040> go<00:02:43.550> up<00:02:43.580> or<00:02:43.970> if<00:02:44.870> you<00:02:45.020> want<00:02:45.200> it<00:02:45.290> to<00:02:45.470> show<00:02:46.280> the

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
than go up or if you want it to show the

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.190 
than go up or if you want it to show the
amid<00:02:46.820> objects<00:02:47.240> right<00:02:47.480> now<00:02:47.600> the<00:02:47.660> sphere<00:02:48.020> does

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
amid objects right now the sphere does

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.020 
amid objects right now the sphere does
not<00:02:48.320> render<00:02:48.560> but<00:02:48.800> if<00:02:48.860> we<00:02:48.950> click<00:02:49.130> this<00:02:49.340> it<00:02:49.820> will

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
not render but if we click this it will

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.920 
not render but if we click this it will
render<00:02:50.980> so<00:02:51.980> a<00:02:52.190> lot<00:02:52.940> a<00:02:52.970> lot<00:02:53.270> a<00:02:53.330> lot<00:02:53.540> of<00:02:53.660> options

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
render so a lot a lot a lot of options

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:55.600 
render so a lot a lot a lot of options
are<00:02:54.020> playing<00:02:54.200> with<00:02:54.350> but<00:02:54.680> the<00:02:54.890> point<00:02:55.430> of<00:02:55.490> this

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
are playing with but the point of this

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:57.310 
are playing with but the point of this
tutorials<00:02:56.000> show<00:02:56.300> the<00:02:56.780> feature<00:02:57.020> that<00:02:57.260> allows

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:57.320 
tutorials show the feature that allows

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
create a smoke smoking environment so I

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.220 
create a smoke smoking environment so I
want<00:03:05.360> to<00:03:05.390> thank<00:03:05.450> you<00:03:05.630> for<00:03:05.690> watching<00:03:06.110> please
