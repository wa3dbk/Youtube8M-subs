to<00:00:08.490> be<00:00:08.549> honest<00:00:08.879> I<00:00:09.059> probably<00:00:09.210> shouldn't<00:00:09.660> be

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:10.560 
to be honest I probably shouldn't be

freaking<00:00:17.520> all<00:00:17.640> the<00:00:17.789> stuff

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:26.540 

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:32.920 

well<00:00:27.540> let's<00:00:27.810> benchmarking

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:32.930 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.189 

here<00:00:33.649> you<00:00:33.739> have<00:00:33.860> benchmarking<00:00:34.570> GTA<00:00:35.570> 5<00:00:35.899> on<00:00:36.170> a

00:00:36.189 --> 00:00:36.199 
here you have benchmarking GTA 5 on a

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:42.700 
here you have benchmarking GTA 5 on a
Radeon<00:00:36.910> 5750<00:00:37.910> a<00:00:39.340> comparative<00:00:41.260> Nvidia<00:00:42.260> card

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:42.710 
Radeon 5750 a comparative Nvidia card

might<00:00:43.040> be<00:00:43.960> geforce<00:00:45.219> 550<00:00:46.219> don't<00:00:46.969> believe<00:00:48.670> ATI

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:49.670 
might be geforce 550 don't believe ATI

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.420 
might be geforce 550 don't believe ATI
cards<00:00:50.030> aren't<00:00:50.269> currently<00:00:50.420> optimized<00:00:51.320> for<00:00:52.100> GTA

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:52.430 
cards aren't currently optimized for GTA

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.319 
cards aren't currently optimized for GTA
5<00:00:53.140> whereas<00:00:54.140> Nvidia<00:00:54.710> cards<00:00:55.129> are<00:00:55.850> completely

00:00:56.319 --> 00:00:56.329 
5 whereas Nvidia cards are completely

5 whereas Nvidia cards are completely
optimized<00:00:56.809> for<00:00:57.019> it<00:00:57.170> they<00:00:57.290> have<00:00:57.409> a<00:00:57.440> better

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:57.710 
optimized for it they have a better

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.219 
optimized for it they have a better
driver<00:00:58.040> right<00:00:58.280> now<00:00:58.309> I<00:00:58.989> think<00:00:59.989> they<00:01:00.079> work

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:00.229 
driver right now I think they work

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:03.100 
driver right now I think they work
closer<00:01:00.500> frocks<00:01:00.890> are<00:01:01.129> on<00:01:01.399> this<00:01:01.550> one<00:01:01.760> so<00:01:02.149> it's<00:01:02.989> to

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.110 
closer frocks are on this one so it's to

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:04.850 
closer frocks are on this one so it's to
be<00:01:03.140> expected

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
be expected

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.420 
be expected
so<00:01:05.430> even<00:01:05.580> a<00:01:05.780> hiring

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
so even a hiring

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.040 
so even a hiring
ATI<00:01:09.180> card<00:01:09.540> right<00:01:10.440> now<00:01:10.470> has<00:01:10.860> a<00:01:10.890> performance<00:01:11.550> hit

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:12.050 
ATI card right now has a performance hit

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:15.530 
ATI card right now has a performance hit
until<00:01:13.050> AMD<00:01:13.950> works<00:01:14.130> on<00:01:14.480> optimizing<00:01:15.480> the

we<00:02:43.859> go<00:02:43.950> from<00:02:44.069> normal<00:02:44.340> to<00:02:45.200> high<00:02:46.200> very<00:02:46.739> high<00:02:46.799> and

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
we go from normal to high very high and

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:53.899 
tea ultra in some sense alright as you
switch<00:02:51.659> the<00:02:51.840> settings<00:02:52.200> it<00:02:52.859> starts<00:02:53.340> taking<00:02:53.549> up

00:02:53.899 --> 00:02:53.909 
switch the settings it starts taking up

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:59.580 
switch the settings it starts taking up
more<00:02:54.150> and<00:02:54.389> more<00:02:54.480> of<00:02:54.780> your<00:02:55.219> backs<00:02:56.219> cards<00:02:56.760> memory

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:06.360 

so<00:03:00.160> right<00:03:00.310> now<00:03:00.459> I'm<00:03:00.610> left<00:03:00.849> 750

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.780 

shit

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.449 

it's<00:03:10.540> just<00:03:10.870> barely

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
it's just barely

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:16.649 
it's just barely
barely<00:03:13.209> cap

00:03:16.649 --> 00:03:16.659 

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:18.239 

you<00:03:16.959> can<00:03:17.200> however<00:03:17.409> push<00:03:17.890> it<00:03:18.040> higher

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:18.249 
you can however push it higher

00:03:18.249 --> 00:03:22.589 
you can however push it higher
particularly<00:03:19.150> for<00:03:19.420> that<00:03:20.280> first<00:03:21.280> room<00:03:21.599> let's

00:03:22.589 --> 00:03:22.599 
particularly for that first room let's

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:25.080 
particularly for that first room let's
round<00:03:22.749> the<00:03:22.900> setting<00:03:23.260> see<00:03:23.709> just<00:03:24.430> how<00:03:24.609> high<00:03:24.849> you

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
round the setting see just how high you

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.089 
round the setting see just how high you
can<00:03:25.269> take<00:03:25.569> it<00:03:25.749> before<00:03:25.930> you<00:03:26.319> crash<00:03:26.680> the<00:03:26.920> game

00:03:27.089 --> 00:03:27.099 
can take it before you crash the game

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:37.410 
can take it before you crash the game
and<00:03:27.579> have<00:03:27.700> no<00:03:27.879> FPS

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:37.420 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:43.230 

so<00:03:38.110> yeah<00:03:38.560> I<00:03:38.860> tried<00:03:40.140> the<00:03:41.670> 750<00:03:42.670> play<00:03:42.850> higher

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:43.240 
so yeah I tried the 750 play higher

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:47.570 
so yeah I tried the 750 play higher
settings<00:03:43.780> I<00:03:44.080> got<00:03:44.980> like<00:03:45.370> 17

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:47.580 
settings I got like 17

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:53.600 
settings I got like 17
and<00:03:48.810> somewhere

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:58.460 

let's<00:03:54.090> ring<00:03:54.420> it

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.230 

I<00:03:58.530> was

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:00.240 
I was

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:03.780 
I was
I<00:04:00.270> mean<00:04:00.900> look<00:04:01.400> asking<00:04:02.400> but

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790 
I mean look asking but

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:06.380 
I mean look asking but
it<00:04:04.000> wasn't<00:04:04.510> really<00:04:04.599> problem

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390 
it wasn't really problem

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:09.800 
it wasn't really problem
so<00:04:07.110> yeah

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.780
