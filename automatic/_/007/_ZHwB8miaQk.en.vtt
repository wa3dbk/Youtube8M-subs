00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:34.470 
placebo is about an additional 15 pounds

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.490 
placebo is about an additional 15 pounds
now<00:00:35.190> this<00:00:35.430> is<00:00:35.609> not<00:00:35.760> a<00:00:36.000> huge<00:00:36.420> number<00:00:36.629> and<00:00:37.260> it's

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
now this is not a huge number and it's

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.860 
now this is not a huge number and it's
you<00:00:37.920> know<00:00:38.039> it's<00:00:38.219> not<00:00:38.370> gonna<00:00:38.550> make<00:00:39.539> someone

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
you know it's not gonna make someone

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.490 
you know it's not gonna make someone
from<00:00:40.199> 300<00:00:40.920> pounds<00:00:41.280> to<00:00:41.489> their<00:00:42.000> ideal<00:00:42.420> weight

from 300 pounds to their ideal weight

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.779 
from 300 pounds to their ideal weight
but<00:00:43.500> we<00:00:43.620> do<00:00:43.800> know<00:00:44.010> that<00:00:44.039> even<00:00:44.460> modest

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
but we do know that even modest

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.029 
but we do know that even modest
reductions<00:00:45.329> in<00:00:45.539> weight<00:00:45.899> can<00:00:46.260> improve<00:00:46.710> health

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
reductions in weight can improve health

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.419 
reductions in weight can improve health
outcomes<00:00:47.870> does<00:00:48.870> this<00:00:49.109> is<00:00:49.289> this<00:00:49.589> sustainable<00:00:50.250> I

00:00:50.419 --> 00:00:50.429 
outcomes does this is this sustainable I

outcomes does this is this sustainable I
don't<00:00:50.789> know<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.600> problem<00:00:52.019> is<00:00:52.079> that<00:00:52.260> we<00:00:52.379> don't

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:52.589 
don't know the problem is that we don't

00:00:52.589 --> 00:00:55.639 
don't know the problem is that we don't
know<00:00:52.710> how<00:00:53.070> long<00:00:53.399> this<00:00:53.820> effect<00:00:54.719> will<00:00:54.929> last<00:00:55.230> and

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
know how long this effect will last and

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.319 
know how long this effect will last and
if<00:00:56.190> these<00:00:56.370> people<00:00:56.789> need<00:00:56.940> to<00:00:56.999> be<00:00:57.089> on<00:00:57.120> this

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
if these people need to be on this

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:58.880 
if these people need to be on this
medication<00:00:57.510> forever<00:00:58.289> and<00:00:58.530> that's<00:00:58.649> kind<00:00:58.859> of

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
medication forever and that's kind of

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.489 
medication forever and that's kind of
what<00:00:59.100> this<00:00:59.309> what<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.879> the<00:01:00.719> company<00:01:01.140> is<00:01:01.199> saying

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:01.499 
what this what the the company is saying

00:01:01.499 --> 00:01:03.259 
what this what the the company is saying
is<00:01:01.620> that<00:01:01.649> yeah<00:01:02.309> if<00:01:02.429> you're<00:01:02.640> losing<00:01:02.940> weight<00:01:02.969> you

00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:03.269 
is that yeah if you're losing weight you

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:07.430 
is that yeah if you're losing weight you
need<00:01:03.390> to<00:01:03.449> be<00:01:03.629> on<00:01:03.780> this<00:01:04.760> forever<00:01:05.780> or<00:01:06.780> until<00:01:07.350> you

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:07.440 
need to be on this forever or until you

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:08.930 
need to be on this forever or until you
develop<00:01:07.560> side<00:01:07.950> effects<00:01:08.280> and<00:01:08.460> I<00:01:08.550> don't<00:01:08.730> I<00:01:08.880> don't

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:08.940 
develop side effects and I don't I don't

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:10.490 
develop side effects and I don't I don't
like<00:01:09.090> that<00:01:09.450> mindset<00:01:09.960> of<00:01:10.080> being<00:01:10.170> on<00:01:10.470> a

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
like that mindset of being on a

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.770 
like that mindset of being on a
medication<00:01:10.920> forever

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
medication forever

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.430 
medication forever
is<00:01:13.050> it<00:01:13.380> safe<00:01:13.760> we<00:01:14.760> don't<00:01:14.970> know<00:01:15.320> there's<00:01:16.320> a

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:16.440 
is it safe we don't know there's a

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.890 
is it safe we don't know there's a
reason<00:01:16.890> why<00:01:17.010> they<00:01:17.250> did<00:01:17.550> not<00:01:17.580> approve<00:01:18.090> it<00:01:18.360> last

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
reason why they did not approve it last

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.980 
reason why they did not approve it last
year<00:01:19.230> because<00:01:19.560> it<00:01:19.710> did<00:01:19.890> increase<00:01:20.220> heart<00:01:20.610> rate

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
year because it did increase heart rate

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.230 
year because it did increase heart rate
and<00:01:21.990> it<00:01:22.110> does<00:01:22.470> seem<00:01:22.890> to<00:01:22.920> do<00:01:23.250> that

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
and it does seem to do that

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.600 
and it does seem to do that
overall<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.230> studies<00:01:25.560> that<00:01:25.680> have<00:01:25.800> been<00:01:25.830> shown

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
overall the studies that have been shown

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.180 
overall the studies that have been shown
to<00:01:26.760> not<00:01:26.910> seem<00:01:27.540> this<00:01:27.750> show<00:01:28.500> any<00:01:28.680> problems<00:01:29.070> in

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:29.190 
to not seem this show any problems in

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:31.580 
to not seem this show any problems in
the<00:01:29.520> short-term<00:01:29.910> but<00:01:30.360> again<00:01:31.200> that<00:01:31.380> is<00:01:31.410> a<00:01:31.500> very

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
the short-term but again that is a very

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.280 
the short-term but again that is a very
narrow<00:01:32.130> mindset<00:01:33.000> and<00:01:33.480> it's<00:01:33.600> not<00:01:33.810> because<00:01:34.140> a

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
narrow mindset and it's not because a

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.140 
narrow mindset and it's not because a
lot<00:01:34.500> of<00:01:34.530> times<00:01:34.800> the<00:01:35.190> problems<00:01:35.730> that<00:01:35.880> arise

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
lot of times the problems that arise

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.560 
lot of times the problems that arise
with<00:01:36.540> these<00:01:36.690> medications<00:01:37.380> they<00:01:38.310> happen<00:01:38.760> 5<00:01:39.030> 10

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
with these medications they happen 5 10

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.230 
with these medications they happen 5 10
15<00:01:40.200> even<00:01:40.380> 20<00:01:40.560> years<00:01:40.890> down<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.490> road<00:01:41.520> and<00:01:42.120> I

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
15 even 20 years down the road and I

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.480 
15 even 20 years down the road and I
wouldn't<00:01:42.630> be<00:01:42.750> surprised<00:01:43.230> if<00:01:43.560> this<00:01:43.800> medication

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
wouldn't be surprised if this medication

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.330 
wouldn't be surprised if this medication
has<00:01:44.790> some<00:01:45.060> side<00:01:45.270> effects<00:01:45.570> that<00:01:45.660> we<00:01:45.900> see

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
has some side effects that we see

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.490 
has some side effects that we see
develop<00:01:47.340> later<00:01:47.880> on<00:01:48.120> down<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.420> road<00:01:48.540> so<00:01:49.470> you

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
develop later on down the road so you

to help with all those issues so you

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.350 
to help with all those issues so you
know<00:02:14.100> if<00:02:14.190> you're<00:02:14.310> thinking<00:02:14.490> about<00:02:14.850> starting

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
know if you're thinking about starting

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.000 
know if you're thinking about starting
use

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
use

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.530 
use
when<00:02:16.340> it<00:02:16.459> comes<00:02:16.640> out<00:02:16.849> I<00:02:16.879> would<00:02:17.150> be<00:02:17.180> very

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
when it comes out I would be very

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.440 
when it comes out I would be very
hesitant<00:02:17.900> about<00:02:18.379> doing<00:02:19.069> that<00:02:19.280> you<00:02:20.150> know<00:02:20.239> for

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
hesitant about doing that you know for

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:21.819 
hesitant about doing that you know for
some<00:02:20.689> people<00:02:21.019> that<00:02:21.049> might<00:02:21.409> be<00:02:21.680> the

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:21.829 
some people that might be the

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:24.190 
some people that might be the
difference-maker<00:02:22.250> but<00:02:23.090> for<00:02:23.299> the<00:02:23.390> most<00:02:23.599> part<00:02:23.780> I

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
difference-maker but for the most part I

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.740 
difference-maker but for the most part I
think<00:02:24.470> that<00:02:24.920> the<00:02:25.099> weight<00:02:26.000> reductions<00:02:26.599> are

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
think that the weight reductions are

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:27.940 
think that the weight reductions are
going<00:02:26.930> to<00:02:26.989> be<00:02:27.110> modest

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
going to be modest

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:29.500 
going to be modest
and<00:02:28.099> I<00:02:28.549> think<00:02:28.790> that<00:02:28.909> there<00:02:29.060> are<00:02:29.239> going<00:02:29.390> to<00:02:29.450> be

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
and I think that there are going to be

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.740 
and I think that there are going to be
some<00:02:29.810> side<00:02:30.049> effects<00:02:30.349> and<00:02:30.530> some<00:02:30.860> risks<00:02:31.370> that<00:02:32.150> we

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
some side effects and some risks that we

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.360 
some side effects and some risks that we
might<00:02:33.019> not<00:02:33.170> even<00:02:33.349> know<00:02:33.620> about<00:02:33.769> until<00:02:33.890> further

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
might not even know about until further

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.180 
might not even know about until further
down<00:02:34.610> the<00:02:34.760> road<00:02:35.140> one<00:02:36.140> of<00:02:36.260> the<00:02:36.379> diets<00:02:36.980> that<00:02:37.069> I

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
down the road one of the diets that I

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:38.949 
down the road one of the diets that I
have<00:02:37.549> had<00:02:37.790> the<00:02:37.940> good<00:02:38.090> success<00:02:38.480> with<00:02:38.750> in

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 
have had the good success with in

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:41.410 
have had the good success with in
patients<00:02:39.470> with<00:02:39.590> mine<00:02:39.799> within<00:02:40.459> my<00:02:40.670> practice<00:02:41.180> is

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
patients with mine within my practice is

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.920 
patients with mine within my practice is
the<00:02:42.079> HCG<00:02:42.950> diet<00:02:43.180> now<00:02:44.180> I'm<00:02:44.390> not<00:02:44.599> exactly<00:02:44.810> sure

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
the HCG diet now I'm not exactly sure

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.089 
the HCG diet now I'm not exactly sure
how<00:02:45.200> this<00:02:45.230> even<00:02:45.650> works

00:02:46.089 --> 00:02:46.099 
how this even works

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:50.110 
how this even works
we've<00:02:46.670> had<00:02:46.879> people<00:02:47.060> lose<00:02:47.709> 60<00:02:48.709> 70<00:02:49.220> 80<00:02:49.430> over<00:02:50.090> a

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
we've had people lose 60 70 80 over a

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.630 
we've had people lose 60 70 80 over a
hundred<00:02:50.540> pounds<00:02:50.989> and<00:02:51.140> they<00:02:51.769> do<00:02:51.829> seem<00:02:52.310> to<00:02:52.430> keep

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
hundred pounds and they do seem to keep

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.660 
hundred pounds and they do seem to keep
it<00:02:52.790> off<00:02:52.970> over<00:02:53.900> a<00:02:54.349> couple<00:02:54.680> number<00:02:55.099> a<00:02:55.220> couple<00:02:55.430> of

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
it off over a couple number a couple of

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.339 
it off over a couple number a couple of
years<00:02:55.909> now<00:02:56.180> we<00:02:56.659> don't<00:02:56.870> have<00:02:56.959> the<00:02:57.049> long-term

00:02:57.339 --> 00:02:57.349 
years now we don't have the long-term

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:59.759 
years now we don't have the long-term
Studies<00:02:57.920> on<00:02:58.040> this<00:02:58.190> as<00:02:58.400> well<00:02:58.609> but<00:02:59.329> the

00:02:59.759 --> 00:02:59.769 
Studies on this as well but the

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:02.129 
Studies on this as well but the
reductions<00:03:00.769> seem<00:03:00.980> to<00:03:01.129> be<00:03:01.250> larger<00:03:01.790> and

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:02.139 
reductions seem to be larger and

00:03:02.139 --> 00:03:04.240 
reductions seem to be larger and
patients<00:03:03.139> seem<00:03:03.290> to<00:03:03.440> tolerate<00:03:03.889> it<00:03:04.069> better

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
patients seem to tolerate it better

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.970 
patients seem to tolerate it better
without<00:03:04.730> any<00:03:05.000> side<00:03:05.359> effects<00:03:05.690> so<00:03:06.230> you<00:03:06.530> know<00:03:06.950> I

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
without any side effects so you know I

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:08.740 
without any side effects so you know I
think<00:03:07.129> that<00:03:07.430> you<00:03:07.549> should<00:03:07.730> look<00:03:07.970> into<00:03:08.209> that<00:03:08.329> do

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
think that you should look into that do

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:10.449 
think that you should look into that do
your<00:03:08.959> own<00:03:09.139> research<00:03:09.170> because<00:03:09.799> that's<00:03:10.220> what's

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459 
your own research because that's what's

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:11.710 
your own research because that's what's
most<00:03:10.519> important<00:03:11.389> you<00:03:11.480> need<00:03:11.599> to<00:03:11.659> be

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
most important you need to be

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.680 
most important you need to be
comfortable<00:03:12.230> with<00:03:12.799> what<00:03:13.099> you're<00:03:13.129> doing<00:03:13.690> and

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
comfortable with what you're doing and

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:17.050 
comfortable with what you're doing and
you<00:03:14.840> need<00:03:14.959> to<00:03:15.200> understand<00:03:15.859> now<00:03:16.400> the<00:03:16.459> risks<00:03:16.940> and

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
you need to understand now the risks and

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:18.789 
you need to understand now the risks and
benefits<00:03:17.120> that<00:03:17.599> come<00:03:17.840> along<00:03:17.870> with<00:03:18.139> any<00:03:18.500> diet

00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:18.799 
benefits that come along with any diet

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:22.119 
benefits that come along with any diet
so<00:03:20.019> hopefully<00:03:21.019> this<00:03:21.169> was<00:03:21.319> helpful<00:03:21.349> if<00:03:21.949> you
