00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:07.670 

indeed<00:00:02.689> what<00:00:03.689> is<00:00:03.870> a<00:00:03.899> waste<00:00:04.230> of<00:00:04.440> time<00:00:05.600> I<00:00:06.680> think

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
indeed what is a waste of time I think

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.249 
indeed what is a waste of time I think
that's<00:00:07.890> really<00:00:08.250> the<00:00:09.290> crux<00:00:10.290> of<00:00:10.590> the<00:00:10.710> issue<00:00:10.740> here

00:00:12.249 --> 00:00:12.259 
that's really the crux of the issue here

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:17.450 
that's really the crux of the issue here
one<00:00:13.259> could<00:00:13.590> argue<00:00:13.620> that<00:00:14.719> a<00:00:15.740> waste<00:00:16.740> of<00:00:16.980> time<00:00:17.220> is

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
one could argue that a waste of time is

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:23.630 
one could argue that a waste of time is
completely<00:00:18.000> innocent<00:00:18.529> so<00:00:19.529> if<00:00:20.400> for<00:00:21.150> example<00:00:22.640> if

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
completely innocent so if for example if

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.720 
completely innocent so if for example if
someone<00:00:23.850> were<00:00:24.420> interested<00:00:25.380> enjoyed<00:00:25.830> studying

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
someone were interested enjoyed studying

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.349 
someone were interested enjoyed studying
about<00:00:27.619> precious<00:00:28.619> metals<00:00:29.000> would<00:00:30.000> that<00:00:30.210> be<00:00:30.330> a

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
about precious metals would that be a

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:43.030 
about precious metals would that be a
waste<00:00:30.599> of<00:00:30.720> time<00:00:33.860> if<00:00:34.860> somebody<00:00:35.670> enjoyed<00:00:36.450> Oh

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:43.040 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.220 

racing<00:00:44.040> cars<00:00:44.480> would<00:00:45.480> that<00:00:45.629> be<00:00:45.690> a<00:00:45.840> waste<00:00:46.079> of

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
racing cars would that be a waste of

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.610 
racing cars would that be a waste of
time<00:00:46.440> I<00:00:46.820> i<00:00:47.820> think<00:00:48.629> you<00:00:48.930> know<00:00:48.989> that's<00:00:49.320> that

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
time I i think you know that's that

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.740 
time I i think you know that's that
that's<00:00:49.860> an<00:00:50.520> issue<00:00:50.640> for<00:00:50.850> each<00:00:51.239> person<00:00:51.480> to

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
that's an issue for each person to

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.770 
that's an issue for each person to
answer<00:00:51.899> I<00:00:52.260> mean<00:00:52.590> for<00:00:52.890> example<00:00:53.210> my<00:00:54.210> wife<00:00:54.449> who<00:00:54.750> is

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
answer I mean for example my wife who is

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.049 
answer I mean for example my wife who is
pretty<00:00:55.559> close<00:00:55.800> to<00:00:56.039> being<00:00:56.070> a<00:00:56.340> Luddite<00:00:56.730> would

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
pretty close to being a Luddite would

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:02.000 
pretty close to being a Luddite would
say<00:00:57.329> making<00:00:57.840> this<00:00:57.960> video<00:00:58.170> stuff<00:00:58.559> time<00:00:58.789> so<00:01:01.010> what

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
say making this video stuff time so what

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.329 
say making this video stuff time so what
is<00:01:02.309> a<00:01:02.340> waste<00:01:02.789> of<00:01:02.940> time<00:01:03.830> personally<00:01:04.830> speaking<00:01:04.979> I

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
is a waste of time personally speaking I

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.910 
is a waste of time personally speaking I
i<00:01:05.549> don't<00:01:06.030> think<00:01:06.479> that<00:01:06.600> gold<00:01:07.200> and<00:01:07.409> silver<00:01:07.740> are<00:01:07.770> a

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
i don't think that gold and silver are a

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.520 
i don't think that gold and silver are a
waste<00:01:08.159> of<00:01:08.340> time<00:01:08.580> it's<00:01:08.909> it's<00:01:09.210> something<00:01:09.630> I<00:01:09.869> like

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
waste of time it's it's something I like

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.140 
waste of time it's it's something I like
to<00:01:10.560> read<00:01:10.830> about<00:01:11.070> it's<00:01:11.430> something<00:01:11.790> I<00:01:11.909> like<00:01:12.119> to

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
to read about it's something I like to

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:18.260 
to read about it's something I like to
talk<00:01:12.600> about<00:01:12.930> and<00:01:13.520> I<00:01:14.520> like<00:01:14.939> to<00:01:15.090> buy<00:01:15.240> it<00:01:15.270> and<00:01:15.680> I<00:01:17.270> I

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
talk about and I like to buy it and I I

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.770 
talk about and I like to buy it and I I
think<00:01:18.570> it's<00:01:18.720> liquid<00:01:19.400> someone<00:01:20.400> will<00:01:20.640> buy<00:01:21.210> my

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
think it's liquid someone will buy my

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.710 
think it's liquid someone will buy my
precious<00:01:22.229> metal<00:01:22.560> if<00:01:22.740> I<00:01:22.890> want<00:01:23.130> to<00:01:23.189> sell<00:01:23.430> it<00:01:23.720> as

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
precious metal if I want to sell it as

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.850 
precious metal if I want to sell it as
opposed<00:01:25.170> to<00:01:25.409> keeping<00:01:26.040> it<00:01:26.189> in<00:01:26.310> a<00:01:26.400> bank<00:01:26.840> or<00:01:27.840> as<00:01:28.650> it

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
opposed to keeping it in a bank or as it

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.380 
opposed to keeping it in a bank or as it
was<00:01:28.979> referred<00:01:29.280> to<00:01:29.369> being<00:01:30.060> liquid<00:01:32.090> well<00:01:33.090> I

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
was referred to being liquid well I

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.170 
was referred to being liquid well I
guess<00:01:33.780> that<00:01:33.810> means<00:01:34.229> you<00:01:34.560> put<00:01:35.040> your<00:01:35.250> faith<00:01:35.909> or

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
guess that means you put your faith or

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.539 
guess that means you put your faith or
trust<00:01:36.299> in<00:01:36.900> another<00:01:37.470> person<00:01:37.890> in<00:01:38.579> yourself<00:01:39.180> so<00:01:39.810> I

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:40.549 
trust in another person in yourself so I

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:43.280 
trust in another person in yourself so I
one<00:01:41.549> could<00:01:41.790> say<00:01:42.000> for<00:01:42.210> example<00:01:42.299> putting<00:01:43.020> your

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
one could say for example putting your

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.770 
one could say for example putting your
money<00:01:43.560> in<00:01:43.979> a<00:01:44.040> savings<00:01:44.610> account<00:01:44.939> at<00:01:45.450> a<00:01:45.479> one

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
money in a savings account at a one

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.179 
money in a savings account at a one
percent<00:01:46.170> interest<00:01:46.560> rate<00:01:46.799> is<00:01:47.040> a<00:01:47.070> waste<00:01:47.430> of<00:01:47.610> time

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:49.189 
percent interest rate is a waste of time

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:52.219 
percent interest rate is a waste of time
I'm<00:01:50.189> not<00:01:50.790> trying<00:01:51.060> to<00:01:51.090> be<00:01:51.180> overly<00:01:51.270> harsh<00:01:51.869> it's

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
I'm not trying to be overly harsh it's

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.139 
I'm not trying to be overly harsh it's
just<00:01:52.500> you<00:01:52.649> know<00:01:52.680> it<00:01:53.070> depends<00:01:53.790> on<00:01:53.909> one's

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
just you know it depends on one's
