Hi, I'm Ty and I'm from SpyCameraCCTV

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:13.379
In today's video we're going to be looking
at our Mini 720p HD Spy Video Recorder

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:16.100
We're going to look at some of the key features

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:22.950
First of all we have rotatable lens of up
to 180 degrees, which means you can hide this

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:27.270
anywhere and adjust the camera's position
to suit you

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:38.280
To compliment this it also has a wide-angle
lens of 160 degrees field-of-view

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:49.149
It has 720p HD video recording, which is great
on such a small unit

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:54.659
There are various different triggering modes
that you could use

00:00:54.659 --> 00:01:02.530
Things like motion detection: meaning it will
only detect when movement in its line-of-sight

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:08.220
Vibration detection—which means it will
trigger from things like a door slamming and

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.729
anything gives quite a high vibration

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:20.510
It also has sound triggering so it triggers
when it hears any sort of sound from the in-built

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:21.780
microphone

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:28.710
What you can also do with this as well is
scheduled recording

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:35.799
You can set it up, let's say, from 10am to
3pm and then it will record constantly between

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:36.869
these times

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:42.070
When this camera is triggered to record it
will record onto a MicroSD card that you will

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:43.070
pop in there

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:52.450
It has a 10 hour battery life – so it makes
it great for hiding in places – and it is

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:53.520
rechargeable as well

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.399
Pop in the plug and it recharges it all for
you—that's for 10 hours

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:03.079
Now to set this camera up on any of the triggering
modes I've talked about you have a little

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:05.909
switch on the side there

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:14.240
You can have it set up between constant record

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.840
If you want to switch it to motion detection
mode you've got a little running man—switch

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.330
that across

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:28.440
Now if you want to set-up things like the
scheduled recording or vibration trigger you'll

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.970
just simply pop in the USB into the side just
there

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:42.500
Pop it into a PC, install the software and
then from there you can actually set it up

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:48.170
the scheduled recording, vibration trigger
and some of the key features on this

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.700
