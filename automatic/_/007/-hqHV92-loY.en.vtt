00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:53.880 
thing you can see here there is like an

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.540 
thing you can see here there is like an
excessive<00:00:54.720> amount<00:00:54.900> of<00:00:55.260> space<00:00:55.500> there<00:00:55.770> I'm<00:00:56.370> sure

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
excessive amount of space there I'm sure

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.229 
excessive amount of space there I'm sure
you<00:00:56.640> can<00:00:56.730> see<00:00:56.850> it<00:00:56.970> it's<00:00:57.930> like<00:00:58.489> so<00:00:59.489> it<00:00:59.640> makes<00:00:59.820> the

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
you can see it it's like so it makes the

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.799 
you can see it it's like so it makes the
latch<00:01:00.750> really<00:01:01.230> like<00:01:02.510> fluffy<00:01:03.510> it's<00:01:03.660> like

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
latch really like fluffy it's like

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.749 
latch really like fluffy it's like
there's<00:01:04.500> no<00:01:04.589> latch<00:01:04.860> gate<00:01:05.129> on<00:01:05.280> it<00:01:05.430> so<00:01:05.580> look

00:01:05.749 --> 00:01:05.759 
there's no latch gate on it so look

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:07.520 
there's no latch gate on it so look
where<00:01:05.910> it<00:01:06.000> goes<00:01:06.180> down<00:01:06.450> there<00:01:06.720> in<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:07.259> blade

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
where it goes down there in the blade

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.380 
where it goes down there in the blade
it's<00:01:08.250> really<00:01:08.520> knowing<00:01:08.790> that<00:01:08.970> you're<00:01:09.060> flipping

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390

the trainer blade it connects with it
all<00:01:12.690> the<00:01:13.170> time<00:01:13.200> it's<00:01:13.830> super<00:01:14.280> annoying

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:17.730 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:20.870 

I<00:01:17.880> put<00:01:18.300> an<00:01:18.390> o-ring<00:01:18.570> on<00:01:18.900> there<00:01:19.140> as<00:01:19.320> a<00:01:19.980> you<00:01:20.730> can

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.960 
i'm going to put another one on there
just<00:01:27.300> for<00:01:27.420> extra<00:01:27.540> lock<00:01:27.810> up<00:01:28.020> but<00:01:28.980> actually<00:01:29.160> with

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
just for extra lock up but actually with

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.600 
just for extra lock up but actually with
10<00:01:30.540> ring<00:01:30.930> in<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.650> closed<00:01:31.920> position<00:01:31.950> it

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
10 ring in the closed position it

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.940 
10 ring in the closed position it
actually<00:01:33.180> locks<00:01:33.720> up<00:01:33.900> really<00:01:34.170> tight<00:01:34.470> as<00:01:34.890> you

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
actually locks up really tight as you

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.360 
actually locks up really tight as you
can<00:01:35.130> see<00:01:35.250> here<00:01:35.460> kind<00:01:35.850> of<00:01:35.880> demonstrate<00:01:36.390> it<00:01:37.370> but

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:38.370 
can see here kind of demonstrate it but

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:40.730 
can see here kind of demonstrate it but
it<00:01:38.520> locks<00:01:38.730> there<00:01:38.910> pretty<00:01:39.060> tight<00:01:39.300> but<00:01:39.630> you<00:01:40.560> can

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
it locks there pretty tight but you can

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.790 
it locks there pretty tight but you can
still<00:01:40.980> like<00:01:41.220> squeeze<00:01:41.700> it<00:01:41.910> like<00:01:42.560> there's<00:01:43.560> not

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:43.800 
still like squeeze it like there's not

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.580 
still like squeeze it like there's not
much<00:01:44.300> pressure<00:01:45.300> on<00:01:45.480> there<00:01:45.810> it's<00:01:46.080> really<00:01:46.410> easy

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
much pressure on there it's really easy

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.740 
much pressure on there it's really easy
to<00:01:46.620> open<00:01:46.800> and<00:01:47.100> as<00:01:48.090> you<00:01:48.210> can<00:01:48.330> see<00:01:48.360> here<00:01:48.630> it's

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
to open and as you can see here it's

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.710 
to open and as you can see here it's
even<00:01:49.050> worse<00:01:49.380> when<00:01:49.830> it's<00:01:50.490> open<00:01:50.880> it<00:01:51.060> just<00:01:51.300> falls

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
even worse when it's open it just falls

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.340 
even worse when it's open it just falls
out

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.859 

you<00:01:54.860> can<00:01:54.979> see<00:01:55.159> the<00:01:55.310> wear<00:01:55.700> and<00:01:55.970> tear<00:01:56.060> a<00:01:56.540> little

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:56.869 
you can see the wear and tear a little

00:01:56.869 --> 00:01:58.960 
you can see the wear and tear a little
bit<00:01:56.990> I<00:01:57.229> mean<00:01:57.500> I<00:01:57.590> don't<00:01:57.740> even<00:01:57.770> know<00:01:58.009> I've<00:01:58.729> had<00:01:58.850> it

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:58.970 
bit I mean I don't even know I've had it

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:00.190 
bit I mean I don't even know I've had it
for<00:01:59.060> a<00:01:59.090> couple<00:01:59.150> months<00:01:59.479> so<00:01:59.780> i<00:01:59.840> guess<00:02:00.049> i've

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
for a couple months so i guess i've

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.910 
for a couple months so i guess i've
dropped<00:02:00.409> us<00:02:00.590> um<00:02:00.799> but<00:02:01.640> uh<00:02:02.380> it's<00:02:03.380> just<00:02:03.530> pretty

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
dropped us um but uh it's just pretty

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.440 
dropped us um but uh it's just pretty
cheap<00:02:04.750> now<00:02:05.750> for<00:02:05.960> the<00:02:06.020> handles<00:02:07.209> i'm<00:02:08.209> not

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
cheap now for the handles i'm not

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.510 
cheap now for the handles i'm not
exactly<00:02:08.840> sure<00:02:09.020> what<00:02:09.440> they're<00:02:09.619> made<00:02:09.800> of<00:02:09.830> but

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 
exactly sure what they're made of but

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.880 
exactly sure what they're made of but
it's<00:02:10.789> some<00:02:11.030> kind<00:02:11.239> of<00:02:11.360> really<00:02:11.630> cheap<00:02:11.959> metal<00:02:12.380> as

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
it's some kind of really cheap metal as

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:14.350 
it's some kind of really cheap metal as
this<00:02:13.010> was<00:02:13.220> a<00:02:13.250> twenty-dollar<00:02:13.760> knife<00:02:14.000> I<00:02:14.209> don't

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
this was a twenty-dollar knife I don't

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.630 
this was a twenty-dollar knife I don't
anything<00:02:14.510> tour<00:02:14.840> that<00:02:15.080> much<00:02:15.319> but<00:02:16.130> you<00:02:16.250> can<00:02:16.400> see

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
anything tour that much but you can see

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.370 
anything tour that much but you can see
all<00:02:16.970> just<00:02:17.690> the<00:02:17.900> wear<00:02:18.410> and<00:02:18.620> tear<00:02:18.709> on<00:02:18.920> it<00:02:19.190> and

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
all just the wear and tear on it and

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.350 
all just the wear and tear on it and
there's<00:02:21.380> those<00:02:21.620> I<00:02:21.920> guess<00:02:22.400> it's<00:02:22.580> skeletonize<00:02:23.150> I

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
there's those I guess it's skeletonize I

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.840 
there's those I guess it's skeletonize I
think<00:02:23.569> I<00:02:24.380> think<00:02:25.069> it's<00:02:25.190> to<00:02:25.370> help<00:02:25.459> the<00:02:25.670> weight

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
think I think it's to help the weight

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.420 
think I think it's to help the weight
but<00:02:26.209> it's<00:02:26.360> still<00:02:26.720> it's<00:02:27.500> it's<00:02:27.980> pretty<00:02:28.220> heavy

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
but it's still it's it's pretty heavy

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.759 
but it's still it's it's pretty heavy
it's<00:02:29.239> probably<00:02:29.450> around<00:02:29.750> five<00:02:29.989> to<00:02:30.170> six<00:02:30.380> ounces

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:30.769 
it's probably around five to six ounces

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:33.070 
it's probably around five to six ounces
and<00:02:30.980> look<00:02:31.730> how<00:02:31.880> thick<00:02:32.269> those<00:02:32.510> handles<00:02:32.959> are

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
and look how thick those handles are

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:37.360 
and look how thick those handles are
those<00:02:33.920> are<00:02:34.250> some<00:02:34.489> fat<00:02:34.989> handles<00:02:36.069> you<00:02:37.069> can<00:02:37.130> tell

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
those are some fat handles you can tell

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:38.500 
those are some fat handles you can tell
I<00:02:37.400> wish<00:02:37.550> I<00:02:37.640> had<00:02:37.730> something<00:02:37.880> to<00:02:38.060> compare<00:02:38.360> it<00:02:38.420> to

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
I wish I had something to compare it to

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.360 
I wish I had something to compare it to
but<00:02:38.900> I<00:02:39.110> don't<00:02:39.410> have<00:02:39.500> my<00:02:39.650> regular<00:02:39.830> knife<00:02:40.190> right

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
but I don't have my regular knife right

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.479 
but I don't have my regular knife right
now<00:02:40.519> I'm<00:02:40.730> trading<00:02:41.300> it<00:02:41.500> but<00:02:42.500> uh<00:02:42.530> just<00:02:43.220> showing

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:43.489 
now I'm trading it but uh just showing

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:48.970 
now I'm trading it but uh just showing
you<00:02:43.550> there

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.430 

and<00:02:49.550> this<00:02:50.239> is<00:02:50.360> the<00:02:50.450> part<00:02:50.629> I<00:02:50.659> hate<00:02:50.720> the<00:02:50.930> most<00:02:51.080> is

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
and this is the part I hate the most is

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.009 
and this is the part I hate the most is
the<00:02:51.790> slickness<00:02:52.790> of<00:02:52.970> the<00:02:53.299> handles<00:02:53.750> while

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:54.019 
the slickness of the handles while

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:56.470 
the slickness of the handles while
you're<00:02:54.140> flipping<00:02:54.730> it'll<00:02:55.730> just<00:02:55.909> come<00:02:56.209> out<00:02:56.390> of

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
you're flipping it'll just come out of

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.210 
you're flipping it'll just come out of
your<00:02:56.569> hands<00:02:56.750> sometimes<00:02:57.019> it's<00:02:57.530> that<00:02:57.799> slick

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
your hands sometimes it's that slick

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.800 
your hands sometimes it's that slick
there's<00:02:58.819> no<00:02:59.120> grip<00:02:59.599> whatsoever<00:03:00.170> no<00:03:00.379> traction

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
there's no grip whatsoever no traction

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.530 
there's no grip whatsoever no traction
you<00:03:02.810> can<00:03:02.930> see<00:03:03.049> that<00:03:03.200> it's<00:03:03.319> just<00:03:03.470> really<00:03:03.739> slick

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
you can see that it's just really slick

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.080 
you can see that it's just really slick
and<00:03:05.890> there's<00:03:06.890> one<00:03:07.099> skeleton<00:03:07.400> either<00:03:07.760> to<00:03:07.940> help

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
and there's one skeleton either to help

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:09.820 
and there's one skeleton either to help
the<00:03:08.239> weight<00:03:08.420> it<00:03:08.629> actually<00:03:08.989> feels<00:03:09.440> pretty<00:03:09.590> good

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:09.830 
the weight it actually feels pretty good

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:12.220 
the weight it actually feels pretty good
it<00:03:10.730> wasn't<00:03:11.030> so<00:03:11.120> slick<00:03:11.420> and<00:03:11.450> be<00:03:11.660> all<00:03:11.780> right<00:03:11.959> and

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
it wasn't so slick and be all right and

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.000 
it wasn't so slick and be all right and
it's<00:03:12.769> actually<00:03:13.160> decent<00:03:13.340> looking<00:03:13.819> knife<00:03:15.010> but

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
it's actually decent looking knife but

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:17.830 
it's actually decent looking knife but
now<00:03:16.370> do<00:03:16.430> the<00:03:16.640> most<00:03:16.819> interesting<00:03:17.510> part<00:03:17.720> that

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
now do the most interesting part that

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.860 
now do the most interesting part that
ruined<00:03:18.079> it<00:03:18.110> for<00:03:18.290> me<00:03:18.319> is<00:03:18.680> the<00:03:18.739> handle<00:03:19.730> play<00:03:19.970> look

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
ruined it for me is the handle play look

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:22.030 
ruined it for me is the handle play look
at<00:03:20.989> this<00:03:21.140> handle<00:03:21.530> play<00:03:21.650> it<00:03:21.709> should<00:03:21.920> be

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
at this handle play it should be

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.380 
at this handle play it should be
something<00:03:22.280> like<00:03:22.430> that<00:03:22.760> that's<00:03:22.910> how<00:03:23.060> you<00:03:23.120> want

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.390 
something like that that's how you want

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:27.789 
something like that that's how you want
it<00:03:23.480> but<00:03:24.260> look<00:03:24.650> at<00:03:24.799> that<00:03:25.510> that<00:03:26.510> is<00:03:26.569> some<00:03:27.500> of<00:03:27.650> the

00:03:27.789 --> 00:03:27.799 
it but look at that that is some of the

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:30.250 
it but look at that that is some of the
worst<00:03:27.829> handle<00:03:28.670> play<00:03:28.849> I've<00:03:29.000> ever<00:03:29.030> seen<00:03:29.690> on<00:03:30.109> a

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
worst handle play I've ever seen on a

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.009 
worst handle play I've ever seen on a
butterfly<00:03:30.500> knife<00:03:30.709> I<00:03:31.299> would<00:03:32.299> recommend<00:03:32.420> just

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:33.019 
butterfly knife I would recommend just

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:34.930 
butterfly knife I would recommend just
like<00:03:33.140> upgrading<00:03:33.590> just<00:03:33.890> like<00:03:34.040> 10<00:03:34.340> bucks<00:03:34.640> more

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:34.940 
like upgrading just like 10 bucks more

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:36.759 
like upgrading just like 10 bucks more
and<00:03:35.120> getting<00:03:35.269> a<00:03:35.390> baron<00:03:35.780> son<00:03:36.019> trainer<00:03:36.500> those

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:36.769 
and getting a baron son trainer those

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:39.729 
and getting a baron son trainer those
are<00:03:36.920> way<00:03:37.310> more<00:03:37.340> high<00:03:37.670> quality<00:03:38.319> but<00:03:39.319> look<00:03:39.530> at

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:39.739 
are way more high quality but look at

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:42.539 
are way more high quality but look at
the<00:03:40.010> trouble<00:03:40.310> that<00:03:41.269> it<00:03:41.420> is<00:03:41.569> to<00:03:41.750> close<00:03:42.079> that

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:42.549 
the trouble that it is to close that

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:47.800 
the trouble that it is to close that
it's<00:03:43.549> just<00:03:43.870> so<00:03:44.870> awkward<00:03:46.090> it<00:03:47.090> rattles<00:03:47.690> around

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
it's just so awkward it rattles around

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.830 
it's just so awkward it rattles around
so<00:03:48.230> much<00:03:48.379> too<00:03:48.620> it's<00:03:48.799> really<00:03:49.069> noisy<00:03:49.690> you<00:03:50.690> can

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
so much too it's really noisy you can

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.300 
so much too it's really noisy you can
see<00:03:51.019> out<00:03:51.140> there<00:03:51.319> it<00:03:51.799> when<00:03:52.069> you're<00:03:52.190> just

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
see out there it when you're just

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:53.710 
see out there it when you're just
flipping<00:03:52.760> it<00:03:52.879> it's<00:03:53.030> just<00:03:53.209> so<00:03:53.450> uncomfortable

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 
flipping it it's just so uncomfortable

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:57.729 
flipping it it's just so uncomfortable
that<00:03:54.790> look<00:03:55.790> at<00:03:55.910> that<00:03:56.120> it's<00:03:57.079> not<00:03:57.349> supposed<00:03:57.680> to

00:03:57.729 --> 00:03:57.739 
that look at that it's not supposed to

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:00.670 
that look at that it's not supposed to
be<00:03:57.829> like<00:03:57.919> that<00:03:58.150> it's<00:03:59.150> just<00:04:00.049> the<00:04:00.260> handle<00:04:00.530> plays

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680

it's<00:04:05.810> kind<00:04:05.989> of<00:04:06.049> slick<00:04:06.290> something<00:04:06.709> but<00:04:07.459> look

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:07.639 
it's kind of slick something but look

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:09.129

when<00:04:07.760> you<00:04:07.819> try<00:04:07.970> to<00:04:08.000> catch<00:04:08.269> the<00:04:08.480> knife<00:04:08.690> I<00:04:08.959> mean

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:09.139 
when you try to catch the knife I mean

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:13.289

the<00:04:09.290> latch<00:04:10.120> bypasses<00:04:11.120> the<00:04:11.359> safe<00:04:12.319> handle<00:04:12.739> and

00:04:13.289 --> 00:04:13.299 
the latch bypasses the safe handle and

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:15.879 
the latch bypasses the safe handle and
it's<00:04:14.299> just<00:04:14.480> crazy<00:04:14.810> it'll<00:04:15.139> slip<00:04:15.560> out<00:04:15.739> your

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:15.889

but<00:05:24.940> uh<00:05:25.110> those<00:05:26.110> holes<00:05:26.470> and<00:05:27.570> I<00:05:28.570> try<00:05:28.780> to<00:05:28.840> get<00:05:29.020> to

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:29.140 
but uh those holes and I try to get to

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:31.620 
but uh those holes and I try to get to
focus<00:05:29.710> right<00:05:30.220> here<00:05:30.250> on<00:05:30.640> the<00:05:30.910> blade<00:05:31.120> but<00:05:31.390> it's

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:31.630 
focus right here on the blade but it's

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:33.930 
focus right here on the blade but it's
kind<00:05:31.840> of<00:05:31.870> hard<00:05:32.080> to<00:05:32.110> do<00:05:32.320> on<00:05:32.530> the<00:05:33.520> side<00:05:33.730> right

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:36.150 
kind of hard to do on the side right
there<00:05:34.380> but<00:05:35.380> that<00:05:35.530> pretty<00:05:35.710> much<00:05:35.890> concludes

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:36.160 
there but that pretty much concludes

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.000
