00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:27.420
 emotional brain behavior and 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:30.510
 emotions then the main doubts 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.219
 about a psychiatry consultation is 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.910
 really different a medical appointment 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:38.250
 actually yes and no 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.379
 the psychiatry consultation is a consultation 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.469
 medical psychiatrist is a professional 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:46.050

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.070
 doctor 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:52.829
 the consultation then have many things in 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.050
 common with a medical appointment she 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:58.550
 needs history or we need 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:02.250
 hear the person understand the problem 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:06.030
 investigate the second moment it can 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:09.180
 have a physical examination and a third 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.010
 mental health 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.560
 and may consist of some tests 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.110
 but it also begins in history 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.060
 when you are talking to the 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.830
 patient starting with the individual 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.979
 You'll start to notice your status. 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:26.820
 to make a diagnosis 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:29.070
 the complementary exams are similar 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.119
 the examinations used in a consultation 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.990
 general medical 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:35.369
 you will serve to complement 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:40.079
 diagnostic hypotheses that arise 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:42.360
 during the exam's history consultation 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:44.729
 mental and physical examination 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.200
 Finally, a hypothesis must be formulated 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:50.820
 diagnostic right 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:53.299
 what the patient has what are the 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:57.659
 indications of treatment thereafter 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:02:01.020
 only then not be prescribed the medication 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:03.719
 or psychotherapy as a psychiatrist too 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.899
 can prescribe psychotherapy and can 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:09.840
 forward if you read this patient 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:11.580
 volunteered so that it follows on from 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:15.780
 treatment often 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:18.870
 my practice is the psychologist he does 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:21.000
 part of a treatment and the patient 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.520
 uses the medication and also uses the 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.870
 psychotherapy in the next video to us 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:29.450
 will talk about the types of psychotherapy 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.450
 and how do they work until then?
