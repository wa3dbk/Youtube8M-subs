00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 always in this tutorial I'm going to 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:07.639
 show how acquired eternity warriors 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:11.550
 so it's valid for emeralds 

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:12.630
 the drunk number of potions finally I 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.969
 will show you how to hack all 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.049
 the game data though globally 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:17.520
 good so that's all for that it takes 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.170
 first download the game ah yes 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.980
 I forgot and so for that he you 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:25.880
 you need a jailbrake apple device 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:28.529
 good I tell you right now the ipod 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.570
 the ipod not the last but before 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.840
 last is at power level a little 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:36.809
 gestures iphone 3gs I also think 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:41.070
 but if you have an iphone 4 4s iphone 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:42.899
 5 ipad 2 ipad 3 and no 4 seems to us 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.290
 normally it's good there is no 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.840
 worry 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.149
 so if it does not work it is that your 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:51.360
 your device is not powerful enough 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:53.640
 so for this jailbreak so finally 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.809
 for this bag jailbreak you'll have 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.420
 need to have a device 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:01.890
 jailbroken to go on cydia and add 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:05.640
 the source http of points that slash has 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:08.159
 pété dot iphonegate dot com so 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.930
 here I leave you I leave you the train 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.369
 to describe 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.049
 at worst you press pause for 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.020
 your way everything will be in the 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:18.270
 description then to install 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.750
 the application guînes player finally the 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:26.630
 tweak range player 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:26.630
 so here you are looking for nuclear 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.479
 so here's once it's done you 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:38.329
 will have on your desk 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:40.259
 an application like this so we go 

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:41.700
 note that at least salubrious and here I 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.100
 when can you see how that's 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.180
 present 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.820
 so you put it aside for the 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.270
 moment 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.270
 you start the game 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:03.670
 here I hope it's not the war 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.110
 because with the camera it is 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.360
 impossible to take a little space 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:10.950
 so I hope not so so here is a 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.950
 priori if you have not use your 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:19.600
 vosges m you have five so and if 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:24.850
 you never have more than 5 where you 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:27.340
 have less than five done so how 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:29.950
 is already called boss rushes 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:33.040
 here is a chance to get some 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.450
 gems or second round I do not know 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.400
 too where exactly diamonds came on 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:40.150
 who cares 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:45.250
 so here you check the deal is 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:46.239
 so beach time and 5th rod so kind I 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:51.250
 go on a gameplay 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:52.360
 I go to give it 5 I'm looking for ah 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.610
 yes no would be first you have to 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:59.350
 click on a selective track 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:05.590
 change warriors 2g so between my shadow 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:08.200
 emerald searched look and so if 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.130
 you never have such a big result 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.110
 that's normal 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:13.530
 in fact, there is a lot of 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:17.470
 data corresponding to figure 5 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:19.810
 so hop I go back on the game for 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:22.630
 change this value so I do not buy 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:26.700
 a potion of rage 2 up I have more than 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:28.650
 three I go back between three 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.730
 research 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:35.620
 so there you see that decreases I have 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:37.000
 more than 6084 to find so I'm wearing 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:40.090
 again again changed my 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:43.870
 value buy hop you see me rest 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:47.680
 more than one world a single diamond the 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:49.060
 rotor I feel so that's normally 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.970
 you're going to have a big thing like that 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:55.360
 huge so good the one who we 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:04:00.340
 interest there are two that we 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:03.640
 forbidden to the top one and this one is going 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:05.790
 you look at who writes from where wb here 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.790
 the 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:10.950
 so the kind checks kaneka so you 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:12.840
 just go modified the two had 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.700
 created so you click on it on the 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:18.110
 value you wait for the countdown 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:18.110
 of 10 seconds 

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:27.030
 so here you can add two 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:30.810
 temples one of 3000 tons 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:33.830
 ok you rewrite exactly the same 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:33.830
 value on the other 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:40.890
 so it can go from 2 1 to 5 according to 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:42.090
 the results for to find good there 

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:43.890
 I had only two so I had some 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:44.970
 luck I'm lucky but it can not 

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:47.190
 there may be more as there may 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:53.900
 to have there I write exactly the same 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:55.770
 give 1000 ok I go back on the game 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:57.750
 so you see I still have a 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:58.170
 it's normal it's instantaneous makes you 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:01.650
 buy 

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:02.970
 you see that I have 1998 so you 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:06.350
 do the same thing to have 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:09.210
 as you see I have 914 health potions 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:13.080
 it's the same I actually got me 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:15.419
 the giant very badly the number of potions 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:18.060
 that I had then I just had to 

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:20.070
 change the deal and then using to 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:22.260
 each time changing the situation and 

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:24.419
 game player for the end power 

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.590
 modify precisely this data so 

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:27.660
 I scored 1000 but you can 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:31.290
 mark the number you want you l 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:34.380
 need 998 I go back there I 

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:38.550
 mark to limit I scored 9 9 8 

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:40.770
 there like that here is up so for you 

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:42.060
 give an example I will change I 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:49.169
 I'm going to add some 

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:54.560
 zeros or even 09/03 raingeard jose 

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:54.560
 3-0 below I add 3.06 

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:06.980
 here I go back on the game you see 

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:11.630
 it's not instant I buy 

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:14.600
 here I am here and there a lot 1997 1998 

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:16.010
 so that's very simple as I 

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:20.830
 tell you to you can also ac and your 

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:22.850
 level good up to level 60 10 max 

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:24.710
 but you pass you can go from 

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:25.280
 level 3 we see it 70 without any worry 

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:27.650
 with this 

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:30.020
 it's enough to change the value 

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:32.780
 for after the game and on game player 

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:34.730
 and then change it to make it 

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:37.790
 modify them 

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:41.450
