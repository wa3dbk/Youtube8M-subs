00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
necessary jobs that our system should be

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.820 
necessary jobs that our system should be
able<00:00:11.219> to<00:00:11.340> do<00:00:11.490> and<00:00:11.780> we<00:00:12.780> have<00:00:12.990> also<00:00:13.200> been<00:00:13.469> able<00:00:13.590> to

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
able to do and we have also been able to

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.330 
able to do and we have also been able to
group<00:00:14.099> those<00:00:14.490> functionalities<00:00:15.330> but<00:00:16.289> based<00:00:17.070> on

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
group those functionalities but based on

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.880 
group those functionalities but based on
the<00:00:17.820> type<00:00:18.210> of<00:00:18.240> work<00:00:18.750> they're<00:00:19.020> doing<00:00:19.050> into

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
the type of work they're doing into

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.590 
the type of work they're doing into
components<00:00:20.490> for<00:00:20.640> example<00:00:21.060> the<00:00:21.420> face

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
components for example the face

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.720 
components for example the face
recognizer<00:00:22.170> the<00:00:22.740> image<00:00:22.920> acquisition<00:00:23.070> phase

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
recognizer the image acquisition phase

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.750 
recognizer the image acquisition phase
detector<00:00:24.119> and<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:24.900> training<00:00:25.140> set<00:00:25.380> manager<00:00:25.760> so

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
detector and the training set manager so

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.720 
detector and the training set manager so
we<00:00:27.090> also<00:00:27.300> have<00:00:27.720> had<00:00:28.019> a<00:00:28.260> basic<00:00:28.830> idea<00:00:28.949> we<00:00:29.550> have

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
we also have had a basic idea we have

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.359 
we also have had a basic idea we have
now<00:00:30.269> found<00:00:30.599> out<00:00:30.869> how<00:00:31.170> the<00:00:31.230> components<00:00:32.160> should

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
now found out how the components should

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.670 
now found out how the components should
actually<00:00:32.669> interact<00:00:33.360> with<00:00:33.570> each<00:00:33.600> other<00:00:33.930> the

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
actually interact with each other the

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.520 
actually interact with each other the
remaining<00:00:35.190> part<00:00:35.489> is<00:00:35.760> to<00:00:36.480> partition<00:00:36.960> of<00:00:37.320> the

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
remaining part is to partition of the

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.619 
remaining part is to partition of the
system<00:00:37.860> if<00:00:38.010> possible<00:00:39.020> into<00:00:40.020> subsystems

00:00:41.619 --> 00:00:41.629 
system if possible into subsystems

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:44.690 
system if possible into subsystems
because<00:00:42.629> breaking<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.410> system<00:00:43.800> into<00:00:44.219> lower

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
because breaking the system into lower

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.869 
because breaking the system into lower
parts<00:00:45.480> will<00:00:46.020> enable<00:00:46.410> us<00:00:46.770> to<00:00:46.879> understand

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
parts will enable us to understand

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.110 
parts will enable us to understand
better<00:00:48.539> how<00:00:48.870> to<00:00:48.930> implement<00:00:49.440> power<00:00:50.309> to<00:00:50.670> send<00:00:50.879> us

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
better how to implement power to send us

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.110 
better how to implement power to send us
to<00:00:51.660> implement<00:00:52.110> our<00:00:52.410> system<00:00:52.980> in<00:00:53.219> smaller<00:00:53.699> parts

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
to implement our system in smaller parts

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.540 
to implement our system in smaller parts
and<00:00:54.270> then<00:00:54.360> integrate<00:00:54.899> those<00:00:55.340> parts<00:00:56.340> to<00:00:56.520> make

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
and then integrate those parts to make

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.810 
and then integrate those parts to make
the<00:00:56.789> whole<00:00:56.969> system<00:00:57.350> now<00:00:58.350> as<00:00:58.710> is<00:00:59.070> evident<00:00:59.550> that

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
the whole system now as is evident that

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.360 
the whole system now as is evident that
power<00:01:00.390> face<00:01:00.719> recognition<00:01:00.930> system<00:01:01.829> has<00:01:02.039> two

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
power face recognition system has two

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.399 
power face recognition system has two
major<00:01:02.670> components<00:01:02.969> phase<00:01:03.480> recognized<00:01:04.019> her<00:01:04.229> in

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
major components phase recognized her in

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.060 
major components phase recognized her in
training<00:01:04.830> set<00:01:05.100> which<00:01:05.700> share<00:01:06.030> these<00:01:06.479> three

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
training set which share these three

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.500 
training set which share these three
common<00:01:08.070> components<00:01:08.760> in<00:01:08.909> their<00:01:09.090> functionality

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
common components in their functionality

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.240 
common components in their functionality
which<00:01:09.900> is<00:01:10.080> phases<00:01:10.530> database<00:01:10.920> image

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
which is phases database image

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.780 
which is phases database image
acquisition<00:01:11.430> and<00:01:11.909> phase<00:01:12.600> detector<00:01:13.460> so<00:01:14.460> it's

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
acquisition and phase detector so it's

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.060 
acquisition and phase detector so it's
pretty<00:01:15.090> natural<00:01:15.720> or<00:01:15.930> pretty<00:01:16.409> understandable

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
pretty natural or pretty understandable

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.690 
pretty natural or pretty understandable
that<00:01:17.400> we<00:01:17.549> divided<00:01:17.939> our<00:01:18.210> system<00:01:19.070> we<00:01:20.070> partition

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
that we divided our system we partition

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.570 
that we divided our system we partition
it<00:01:20.850> based<00:01:21.750> on<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.500> print<00:01:22.770> function<00:01:22.979> ality<00:01:23.430> of

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
it based on the print function ality of

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.120 
it based on the print function ality of
face<00:01:24.210> recognizer<00:01:24.780> and<00:01:25.170> training<00:01:25.560> set<00:01:25.710> manager

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
face recognizer and training set manager

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.520 
face recognizer and training set manager
so<00:01:26.310> we<00:01:26.430> could<00:01:26.580> say<00:01:26.700> one<00:01:27.390> part<00:01:27.689> of<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.320> system

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
so we could say one part of the system

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.429 
so we could say one part of the system
could<00:01:28.829> be<00:01:29.009> to<00:01:29.340> recognize<00:01:29.909> a<00:01:29.939> face<00:01:30.299> and<00:01:30.659> do<00:01:31.290> all

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
could be to recognize a face and do all

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.020 
could be to recognize a face and do all
the<00:01:31.590> jobs<00:01:31.619> associated<00:01:32.280> with<00:01:32.700> it<00:01:32.820> and<00:01:33.000> the

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
the jobs associated with it and the

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.630 
the jobs associated with it and the
other<00:01:33.420> could<00:01:33.900> be<00:01:33.930> to<00:01:34.380> train<00:01:34.799> and<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:35.159> manage

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
other could be to train and to manage

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.510 
other could be to train and to manage
our<00:01:36.060> training<00:01:36.689> set<00:01:36.930> and<00:01:37.079> all<00:01:37.770> those<00:01:37.979> jobs<00:01:38.369> that

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
our training set and all those jobs that

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.690 
our training set and all those jobs that
you<00:01:38.670> see<00:01:38.850> here<00:01:39.090> associated<00:01:39.840> with<00:01:39.930> it<00:01:40.310> so<00:01:41.310> let's

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
you see here associated with it so let's

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.600 
you see here associated with it so let's
move<00:01:42.000> on<00:01:42.270> and<00:01:42.619> partition<00:01:43.619> our<00:01:43.740> system<00:01:44.280> into

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
move on and partition our system into

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.560 
move on and partition our system into
two<00:01:44.759> subsystems<00:01:45.210> and<00:01:46.280> design<00:01:47.280> a<00:01:47.670> have<00:01:48.540> a

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
two subsystems and design a have a

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.749 
two subsystems and design a have a
logical<00:01:49.290> design<00:01:49.470> for<00:01:49.950> both<00:01:50.130> of<00:01:50.280> those<00:01:50.399> systems

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
logical design for both of those systems

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.300 
logical design for both of those systems
so<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.149> so<00:01:51.689> that<00:01:51.869> we<00:01:52.470> can<00:01:52.710> implement<00:01:52.979> them

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
so the so that we can implement them

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.580 
so the so that we can implement them
later<00:01:53.490> on<00:01:53.659> right<00:01:54.659> then

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
later on right then

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.889 
later on right then
partitioning<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:56.759> system<00:01:57.090> into<00:01:57.299> subsystems

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
partitioning the system into subsystems

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.249 
partitioning the system into subsystems
and<00:01:58.549> developing<00:01:59.549> very<00:01:59.759> logical<00:02:00.240> design<00:02:00.359> now

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
and developing very logical design now

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.309 
and developing very logical design now
to<00:02:01.320> do<00:02:01.740> that<00:02:01.770> let's<00:02:02.250> first<00:02:02.579> focus<00:02:02.969> on<00:02:03.420> the<00:02:04.020> big

00:02:04.309 --> 00:02:04.319 
to do that let's first focus on the big

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:07.069 
to do that let's first focus on the big
components<00:02:04.679> needed<00:02:05.219> to<00:02:05.579> manage<00:02:06.060> a<00:02:06.479> training

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
components needed to manage a training

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.529 
components needed to manage a training
set<00:02:07.289> all<00:02:07.500> the<00:02:07.740> necessary<00:02:08.250> components<00:02:08.879> keep

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
set all the necessary components keep

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.960 
set all the necessary components keep
them<00:02:09.810> and<00:02:10.080> let's<00:02:10.319> just<00:02:10.440> discard<00:02:11.220> the<00:02:11.700> others

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
them and let's just discard the others

means the phase recognizer this part so

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.200 
means the phase recognizer this part so

would<00:04:36.039> be<00:04:36.280> a<00:04:36.310> set<00:04:36.729> of<00:04:36.880> these<00:04:37.090> three<00:04:37.509> components

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:37.690 
would be a set of these three components

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:40.469 
would be a set of these three components
which<00:04:38.320> make<00:04:38.590> up<00:04:38.800> subsystem<00:04:39.789> one<00:04:39.970> along<00:04:40.330> with

00:04:40.469 --> 00:04:40.479 
which make up subsystem one along with

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:43.860 
which make up subsystem one along with
the<00:04:40.570> faces<00:04:40.750> database<00:04:41.320> and<00:04:41.970> along<00:04:42.970> with<00:04:43.210> these

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:43.870 
the faces database and along with these

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:45.659 
the faces database and along with these
three<00:04:44.229> components<00:04:44.410> with<00:04:44.949> phase<00:04:45.099> recognizer

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:45.669 
three components with phase recognizer

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:47.240 
three components with phase recognizer
image<00:04:46.060> acquisition<00:04:46.210> and<00:04:46.660> phase<00:04:46.810> detector

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.250 
image acquisition and phase detector

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:49.620 
image acquisition and phase detector
along<00:04:48.250> with<00:04:48.280> the<00:04:48.520> faces<00:04:48.699> database<00:04:49.300> make

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:49.630 
along with the faces database make

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:51.360 
along with the faces database make
subsystem<00:04:50.289> to<00:04:50.410> that<00:04:50.860> is<00:04:51.009> the<00:04:51.160> phase

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:51.370 
subsystem to that is the phase

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:53.670 
subsystem to that is the phase
recognizer<00:04:51.910> so<00:04:52.509> this<00:04:52.660> is<00:04:52.690> the<00:04:53.020> logical<00:04:53.470> design

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 
recognizer so this is the logical design

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.670 
recognizer so this is the logical design
overall<00:04:54.430> logical<00:04:55.090> design<00:04:55.210> of<00:04:55.720> our<00:04:55.960> complete

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:56.680 
overall logical design of our complete

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.890 
overall logical design of our complete
system<00:04:57.070> so<00:04:57.789> I<00:04:57.820> think<00:04:58.000> this<00:04:58.419> will<00:04:58.599> give<00:04:58.780> you<00:04:58.870> a

00:04:58.890 --> 00:04:58.900 
system so I think this will give you a

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:02.310 
system so I think this will give you a
better<00:04:59.139> understanding<00:05:00.010> of<00:05:00.479> how<00:05:01.479> now<00:05:01.990> that<00:05:02.020> it

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:02.320 
better understanding of how now that it

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.080 
better understanding of how now that it
is<00:05:02.349> partitioned<00:05:02.919> into<00:05:03.220> two<00:05:03.340> parts<00:05:03.880> it's

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:04.090 
is partitioned into two parts it's

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:06.930 
is partitioned into two parts it's
easier<00:05:04.750> to<00:05:05.440> develop<00:05:05.919> an<00:05:06.280> understanding<00:05:06.400> of

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:06.940 
easier to develop an understanding of

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:11.520 
easier to develop an understanding of
mud<00:05:07.720> to<00:05:08.110> pave<00:05:08.590> our<00:05:08.919> way<00:05:09.220> to<00:05:10.210> how<00:05:10.659> to<00:05:11.169> actually

mud to pave our way to how to actually

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.120 
implement it how to code this stuff now

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:17.850 
implement it how to code this stuff now
if<00:05:16.120> it's<00:05:16.330> still<00:05:16.510> not<00:05:16.690> clear<00:05:16.930> to<00:05:17.200> you<00:05:17.230> it<00:05:17.590> will

if it's still not clear to you it will

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:20.250 
if it's still not clear to you it will
be<00:05:18.070> because<00:05:18.310> right<00:05:18.970> after<00:05:19.150> this<00:05:19.750> logical
