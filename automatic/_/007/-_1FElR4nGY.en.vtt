00:01:27.279 --> 00:01:27.289 
board I'm going to place that onto the

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:31.510 
board I'm going to place that onto the
board<00:01:27.560> like<00:01:27.770> so<00:01:27.830> and<00:01:28.399> smooth<00:01:28.909> us<00:01:29.240> out<00:01:30.369> with<00:01:31.369> the

board like so and smooth us out with the

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.749 
board like so and smooth us out with the
heel<00:01:31.759> of<00:01:32.030> your<00:01:32.060> hand<00:01:32.960> and<00:01:33.369> use<00:01:34.369> the<00:01:34.610> small

heel of your hand and use the small
pallet<00:01:35.390> knife<00:01:35.569> to<00:01:36.560> trim<00:01:36.770> around<00:01:37.130> the<00:01:37.580> edge

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:48.790 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:55.060 

and<00:01:49.790> then<00:01:50.510> smooth<00:01:51.170> with<00:01:51.710> your<00:01:51.920> hand<00:01:54.070> smooth

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:06.159 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:11.220 

and<00:02:06.280> then<00:02:07.030> we<00:02:07.270> trim<00:02:09.360> so<00:02:10.360> you<00:02:10.420> have<00:02:10.660> a<00:02:10.690> nice<00:02:10.929> nice

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
and then we trim so you have a nice nice

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:24.000 
and then we trim so you have a nice nice
edge

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:38.630 

and<00:02:24.580> then<00:02:24.819> you're<00:02:25.480> ready<00:02:25.510> for<00:02:26.340> the<00:02:27.340> embossing

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.710 

so<00:02:39.210> for<00:02:39.480> the<00:02:39.630> embossing<00:02:40.140> you<00:02:40.890> take<00:02:41.160> the<00:02:41.310> little

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
so for the embossing you take the little

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.680 
so for the embossing you take the little
flower<00:02:42.720> and<00:02:42.750> leaf<00:02:43.100> place<00:02:44.100> it<00:02:44.340> onto<00:02:44.580> the<00:02:44.730> sugar

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
flower and leaf place it onto the sugar

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.470 
flower and leaf place it onto the sugar
paste<00:02:45.930> and<00:02:46.320> press<00:02:47.070> firmly<00:02:47.400> just<00:02:47.880> rock<00:02:48.180> it<00:02:48.210> from

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
paste and press firmly just rock it from

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.240 
paste and press firmly just rock it from
side<00:02:48.660> to<00:02:48.720> side<00:02:48.900> to<00:02:49.380> make<00:02:49.530> sure<00:02:49.740> you<00:02:49.950> have<00:02:50.130> an

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
side to side to make sure you have an

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.450 
side to side to make sure you have an
even<00:02:50.550> embossing<00:02:51.060> and<00:02:51.240> then<00:02:52.230> move<00:02:52.590> that<00:02:52.890> along

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:53.460 
even embossing and then move that along

00:02:53.460 --> 00:03:03.380 
even embossing and then move that along
and<00:02:54.710> repeat<00:02:56.270> and<00:02:57.270> turn<00:02:57.690> the<00:02:57.900> plaque<00:02:58.170> and<00:03:02.390> keep

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
and repeat and turn the plaque and keep

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:19.880 
and repeat and turn the plaque and keep
embossing<00:03:05.330> that<00:03:06.330> pattern

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.650 

around<00:03:20.730> the<00:03:20.910> plaque

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.050 

now<00:03:25.200> because<00:03:25.560> I<00:03:25.710> press<00:03:26.040> down<00:03:26.070> I've<00:03:26.700> probably

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
now because I press down I've probably

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.360 
now because I press down I've probably
made<00:03:27.510> the<00:03:27.900> outside<00:03:28.470> edge<00:03:28.710> a<00:03:28.740> little<00:03:29.070> uneven

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
made the outside edge a little uneven

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:34.960 
made the outside edge a little uneven
and<00:03:29.790> so<00:03:30.360> again<00:03:30.690> you<00:03:31.410> need<00:03:31.590> to<00:03:31.650> lift<00:03:32.280> that<00:03:32.940> and

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
and so again you need to lift that and

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:38.840 
and so again you need to lift that and
reach<00:03:35.970> rim<00:03:36.650> don't<00:03:37.650> just<00:03:37.890> push<00:03:38.130> it<00:03:38.280> in<00:03:38.490> because

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
reach rim don't just push it in because

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:42.230 
reach rim don't just push it in because
then<00:03:39.030> you'll<00:03:39.180> alter<00:03:39.810> the<00:03:39.990> design<00:03:40.640> of<00:03:41.640> the

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:42.240 
then you'll alter the design of the

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.330 
then you'll alter the design of the
outline<00:03:42.600> so<00:03:42.780> just<00:03:43.140> push<00:03:43.320> that<00:03:43.560> button<00:03:43.890> cut

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
outline so just push that button cut

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.490 
outline so just push that button cut
that<00:03:44.520> off<00:03:44.760> with<00:03:45.090> your<00:03:45.690> small<00:03:45.930> palette<00:03:46.320> knife

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
that off with your small palette knife

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.930 
that off with your small palette knife
to<00:03:46.830> tidy<00:03:47.640> it<00:03:47.880> up<00:03:48.060> and<00:03:49.490> then<00:03:50.490> you<00:03:50.640> would<00:03:50.760> leave

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
to tidy it up and then you would leave

00:03:50.940 --> 00:04:00.980 
to tidy it up and then you would leave
that<00:03:51.120> to<00:03:51.330> dry<00:03:52.700> before<00:03:54.140> you<00:03:55.140> paint<00:03:55.440> it

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
and I'm going to put some into the lid

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:18.150 
and I'm going to put some into the lid
of<00:04:13.120> the<00:04:14.760> just<00:04:15.760> color<00:04:16.030> and<00:04:16.650> mix<00:04:17.650> a<00:04:17.830> little<00:04:17.950> of

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 
the color and it's the key is to have

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
the color and it's the key is to have
the<00:04:22.900> consistency<00:04:23.230> like<00:04:23.980> water<00:04:24.370> and<00:04:24.850> that<00:04:25.660> blob

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 
the consistency like water and that blob

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:29.820 
the consistency like water and that blob
of<00:04:26.050> color<00:04:27.300> try<00:04:28.300> not<00:04:28.510> to<00:04:28.660> shake<00:04:28.900> it<00:04:29.200> or<00:04:29.440> touch

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:31.290 
of color try not to shake it or touch
the<00:04:30.070> lid<00:04:30.280> because<00:04:30.610> that<00:04:30.760> will<00:04:30.850> just<00:04:30.880> take<00:04:31.180> the

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 
the lid because that will just take the

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.390 
the lid because that will just take the
color<00:04:31.510> back<00:04:31.780> into<00:04:32.170> the<00:04:32.290> lid<00:04:32.470> you<00:04:32.950> need<00:04:33.100> to<00:04:33.220> lift

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:33.400 
color back into the lid you need to lift

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.880 
color back into the lid you need to lift
that<00:04:33.610> color<00:04:33.910> and<00:04:34.210> drop<00:04:34.990> that<00:04:35.230> blob<00:04:35.530> of<00:04:35.560> color

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:35.890

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:38.470 
into the embossed outline and it will

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:46.080 
into the embossed outline and it will
run<00:04:38.710> around<00:04:38.830> the<00:04:39.130> flower

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.090 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:53.750
