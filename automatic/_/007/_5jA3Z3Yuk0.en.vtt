only survive a little time they do the

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
same thing but you spawns a couple of

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.439 
same thing but you spawns a couple of
brood<00:00:28.170> lords<00:00:28.439> every<00:00:28.710> time<00:00:28.859> it<00:00:29.039> attacks

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:29.449 
brood lords every time it attacks

brood lords every time it attacks
meeting<00:00:30.449> you<00:00:30.570> name<00:00:30.750> it<00:00:30.900> can<00:00:31.019> only<00:00:31.140> hear<00:00:31.410> I'm<00:00:31.560> a

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
meeting you name it can only hear I'm a

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.370 
meeting you name it can only hear I'm a
ground<00:00:31.980> unit<00:00:32.219> rather<00:00:32.660> so<00:00:33.660> Harry's<00:00:34.170> had<00:00:34.290> to

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
ground unit rather so Harry's had to

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.049 
ground unit rather so Harry's had to
respond<00:00:34.739> faster<00:00:35.190> these<00:00:35.309> brood<00:00:35.550> lords<00:00:35.820> as<00:00:35.910> soon

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
respond faster these brood lords as soon

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.610 
respond faster these brood lords as soon
as<00:00:36.149> he<00:00:36.239> saw<00:00:36.390> them<00:00:36.510> start<00:00:36.780> pumping<00:00:37.110> out<00:00:37.200> Vikings

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
as he saw them start pumping out Vikings

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.340 
as he saw them start pumping out Vikings
which<00:00:37.800> are<00:00:38.010> very<00:00:38.309> good<00:00:38.579> anti<00:00:38.820> air<00:00:39.050> so<00:00:40.050> it<00:00:40.079> looks

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
which are very good anti air so it looks

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.290 
which are very good anti air so it looks
like<00:00:40.469> these<00:00:40.559> brood<00:00:40.829> lords<00:00:41.160> have<00:00:41.250> got<00:00:41.399> no<00:00:42.030> way

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
like these brood lords have got no way

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.319 
like these brood lords have got no way
to<00:00:42.360> stop<00:00:42.660> those<00:00:42.809> Vikings<00:00:44.000> possibly<00:00:45.000> bring<00:00:45.210> in

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
to stop those Vikings possibly bring in

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.540 
to stop those Vikings possibly bring in
some<00:00:45.510> hydras<00:00:46.050> but<00:00:46.469> hydrogen<00:00:47.129> are<00:00:47.219> going<00:00:47.370> to<00:00:47.430> be

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
some hydras but hydrogen are going to be

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.660 
some hydras but hydrogen are going to be
so<00:00:47.789> far<00:00:48.030> away<00:00:48.180> now<00:00:48.800> so<00:00:49.800> it's<00:00:50.309> not<00:00:50.520> really

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
so far away now so it's not really

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.100 
so far away now so it's not really
likely<00:00:51.180> he's<00:00:51.420> going<00:00:51.570> to<00:00:51.629> be<00:00:51.719> able<00:00:51.809> to<00:00:51.930> stop

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
likely he's going to be able to stop

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.479 
likely he's going to be able to stop
these<00:00:52.260> Vikings<00:00:52.739> from<00:00:52.920> killing<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.309> brood

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
these Vikings from killing the brood

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.029 
these Vikings from killing the brood
lords<00:00:53.850> to<00:00:54.120> be<00:00:54.239> honest<00:00:54.510> because<00:00:54.739> brood<00:00:55.739> losses

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
lords to be honest because brood losses

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.790 
lords to be honest because brood losses
and<00:00:56.160> see<00:00:56.340> our<00:00:56.460> free<00:00:56.640> slow<00:00:56.940> units<00:00:57.559> for<00:00:58.559> your

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
and see our free slow units for your

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.290 
and see our free slow units for your
slow<00:00:59.070> and<00:00:59.250> clunky<00:00:59.460> and<00:00:59.670> that's<00:00:59.910> the<00:01:00.120> reason

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
slow and clunky and that's the reason

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.319 
slow and clunky and that's the reason
why<00:01:00.510> because<00:01:01.079> they're<00:01:01.230> so<00:01:01.350> powerful

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:02.329 
why because they're so powerful

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:04.340 
why because they're so powerful
obviously<00:01:03.329> they<00:01:03.480> can<00:01:03.660> move<00:01:03.780> at<00:01:03.960> lightning

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
obviously they can move at lightning

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.560 
obviously they can move at lightning
speed<00:01:04.680> then<00:01:04.949> a<00:01:04.979> yeah<00:01:05.850> everyone<00:01:06.330> will<00:01:06.479> be

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
speed then a yeah everyone will be

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.899 
speed then a yeah everyone will be
playing<00:01:06.810> six<00:01:07.140> so<00:01:07.560> that's<00:01:08.130> a<00:01:08.280> parent's<00:01:08.670> feature

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
playing six so that's a parent's feature

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.500 
playing six so that's a parent's feature
there<00:01:09.180> so<00:01:09.630> frak<00:01:10.619> is<00:01:10.770> done<00:01:11.060> probably<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.330> right

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
there so frak is done probably the right

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.990 
there so frak is done probably the right
thing<00:01:12.570> I<00:01:12.869> suppose<00:01:13.260> he<00:01:13.619> just<00:01:14.460> had<00:01:14.610> to<00:01:14.729> kind<00:01:14.880> of

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
thing I suppose he just had to kind of

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.580 
thing I suppose he just had to kind of
sacrifice<00:01:15.509> him<00:01:15.659> and<00:01:15.780> do<00:01:15.840> as<00:01:15.960> much<00:01:16.110> damage<00:01:16.170> to

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
sacrifice him and do as much damage to

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.310 
sacrifice him and do as much damage to
him<00:01:17.090> Haley<00:01:18.090> as<00:01:18.299> you<00:01:18.450> could<00:01:18.659> possibly<00:01:18.840> with

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
him Haley as you could possibly with

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.429 
him Haley as you could possibly with
them<00:01:19.500> just<00:01:19.860> keep<00:01:20.040> them<00:01:20.189> in<00:01:20.340> Haley's<00:01:20.700> her<00:01:20.909> face

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:21.439 
them just keep them in Haley's her face

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:23.480 
them just keep them in Haley's her face
attacking<00:01:22.439> all<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.650> time<00:01:22.860> because<00:01:23.220> if<00:01:23.430> we

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
attacking all the time because if we

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.310 
attacking all the time because if we
tried<00:01:23.729> to<00:01:23.759> move<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.090> three<00:01:24.390> balls<00:01:24.630> back<00:01:25.049> to

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
tried to move the three balls back to

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.940 
tried to move the three balls back to
sort<00:01:25.560> of<00:01:25.650> safe<00:01:25.890> from<00:01:26.159> area<00:01:27.090> in<00:01:27.240> his<00:01:27.390> own<00:01:27.509> mean

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
sort of safe from area in his own mean

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:29.990 
sort of safe from area in his own mean
it's<00:01:28.950> not<00:01:29.159> going<00:01:29.280> to<00:01:29.369> do<00:01:29.460> too<00:01:29.670> well<00:01:29.850> from

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
it's not going to do too well from

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.190 
it's not going to do too well from
because<00:01:30.270> they<00:01:30.329> probably<00:01:30.479> all<00:01:30.659> get<00:01:30.810> picked<00:01:31.049> off

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
because they probably all get picked off

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.560

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
the rest of this i mean no problem they

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:27.930 
the rest of this i mean no problem they
can<00:02:26.380> don't<00:02:26.650> deal<00:02:26.920> with<00:02:27.070> the<00:02:27.160> Vikings<00:02:27.700> do<00:02:27.790> they

want to go into our mouths so that's a
good<00:02:29.800> reason<00:02:29.980> to<00:02:30.220> get<00:02:30.370> hydras<00:02:31.020> rather<00:02:32.020> than

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
good reason to get hydras rather than

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.390 
good reason to get hydras rather than
users<00:02:34.870> which<00:02:35.140> ticket<00:02:35.440> there<00:02:35.620> I<00:02:35.800> think<00:02:36.099> Haley's

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
users which ticket there I think Haley's

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.250 
users which ticket there I think Haley's
realized<00:02:36.819> at<00:02:36.970> this<00:02:37.090> point<00:02:37.390> loss<00:02:37.870> which<00:02:38.110> is

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
realized at this point loss which is

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.790 
realized at this point loss which is
controlling<00:02:38.769> and<00:02:39.040> messing<00:02:39.400> around<00:02:39.840> yes<00:02:40.840> it

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
controlling and messing around yes it

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.300 
controlling and messing around yes it
looks<00:02:42.069> like<00:02:42.280> it's<00:02:42.519> the<00:02:42.640> GG<00:02:43.150> at<00:02:43.269> this<00:02:43.390> point

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
looks like it's the GG at this point

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.190 
looks like it's the GG at this point
that<00:02:45.310> was<00:02:45.430> a<00:02:45.489> nice<00:02:45.819> game<00:02:46.180> back<00:02:46.599> and<00:02:46.840> forth<00:02:47.050> from

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
both players mistakes were made but

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.670 
both players mistakes were made but
that's<00:02:49.420> what<00:02:49.569> makes<00:02:49.599> the<00:02:49.870> game<00:02:50.019> interesting

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680
