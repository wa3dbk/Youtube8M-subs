00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:03.270 
this is really cool I mean the ceramic

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:05.749 
this is really cool I mean the ceramic
six<00:00:03.600> it<00:00:03.870> looks<00:00:04.290> like<00:00:04.620> it's<00:00:04.830> out<00:00:05.009> of<00:00:05.160> ceramic

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
six it looks like it's out of ceramic

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:08.059 
six it looks like it's out of ceramic
how'd<00:00:06.299> you<00:00:06.450> do<00:00:06.600> that<00:00:06.629> yeah<00:00:07.170> I<00:00:07.200> mean<00:00:07.500> this<00:00:07.680> this

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
how'd you do that yeah I mean this this

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:10.520 
how'd you do that yeah I mean this this
particular<00:00:08.550> effect<00:00:09.300> it's<00:00:09.540> a<00:00:09.690> it's<00:00:09.960> a<00:00:10.139> matte

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
particular effect it's a it's a matte

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.339 
particular effect it's a it's a matte
white<00:00:10.860> pearl<00:00:11.340> and<00:00:11.730> we<00:00:12.330> call<00:00:12.570> it<00:00:12.780> ceramic

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
white pearl and we call it ceramic

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:14.720 
white pearl and we call it ceramic
because<00:00:13.469> with<00:00:13.710> that's<00:00:13.920> literally<00:00:14.340> what<00:00:14.610> we

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
because with that's literally what we

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.250 
because with that's literally what we
wanted<00:00:15.030> it<00:00:15.150> to<00:00:15.299> look<00:00:15.420> like<00:00:15.480> almost<00:00:15.929> like<00:00:16.109> an

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
wanted it to look like almost like an

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.070 
wanted it to look like almost like an
aerospace<00:00:16.760> type<00:00:17.760> of<00:00:17.970> look<00:00:18.180> and<00:00:18.359> feel<00:00:18.420> it's

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
aerospace type of look and feel it's

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.140 
aerospace type of look and feel it's
very<00:00:19.289> technical<00:00:19.560> but<00:00:20.130> at<00:00:20.220> the<00:00:20.340> same<00:00:20.550> time<00:00:20.850> with

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
very technical but at the same time with

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.439 
very technical but at the same time with
this<00:00:21.300> kind<00:00:21.600> of<00:00:21.660> we<00:00:22.020> call<00:00:22.199> it<00:00:22.350> taupe<00:00:22.619> silver

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:23.449 
this kind of we call it taupe silver

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:26.439 
this kind of we call it taupe silver
graphic<00:00:24.449> defect<00:00:24.869> still<00:00:25.410> very<00:00:25.619> elegant<00:00:26.220> and

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:26.449 
graphic defect still very elegant and

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:30.380 
graphic defect still very elegant and
fitting<00:00:27.449> with<00:00:27.630> the<00:00:27.750> mazda6<00:00:28.170> design<00:00:29.210> this<00:00:30.210> is

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
fitting with the mazda6 design this is

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.020 
fitting with the mazda6 design this is
all<00:00:30.660> masked<00:00:31.380> and<00:00:31.560> painted<00:00:32.040> and<00:00:32.219> believe<00:00:32.850> me

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
all masked and painted and believe me

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.120 
all masked and painted and believe me
this<00:00:33.180> was<00:00:33.420> not<00:00:33.780> easy<00:00:34.079> to<00:00:34.320> do<00:00:34.500> we<00:00:34.680> really<00:00:34.980> had<00:00:35.100> a

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
this was not easy to do we really had a

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.970 
this was not easy to do we really had a
big<00:00:35.489> challenge<00:00:36.000> on<00:00:36.329> our<00:00:36.480> hands<00:00:37.020> with<00:00:37.290> this<00:00:37.500> but

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
big challenge on our hands with this but

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.229 
big challenge on our hands with this but
I<00:00:38.010> think<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.399> end<00:00:38.520> result<00:00:38.700> really

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
I think the end result really

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.810 
I think the end result really
complements<00:00:39.899> the<00:00:40.020> mazda6<00:00:40.649> is<00:00:41.070> designed<00:00:41.489> was

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
complements the mazda6 is designed was

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.779 
complements the mazda6 is designed was
this<00:00:41.969> more<00:00:42.390> difficult<00:00:42.570> to<00:00:42.930> do<00:00:43.140> than<00:00:43.440> the

00:00:43.779 --> 00:00:43.789 
this more difficult to do than the

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:46.910 
this more difficult to do than the
vector3<00:00:44.789> on<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.420> paint<00:00:45.629> job<00:00:45.840> I<00:00:46.020> believe<00:00:46.079> so

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
vector3 on the paint job I believe so

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.010 
vector3 on the paint job I believe so
yeah<00:00:47.160> because<00:00:47.399> just<00:00:47.850> just<00:00:48.270> because<00:00:48.660> of<00:00:48.809> all

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
yeah because just just because of all

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.709 
yeah because just just because of all
the<00:00:49.350> lines<00:00:49.770> and<00:00:50.190> how<00:00:50.789> we<00:00:50.850> had<00:00:51.120> everything<00:00:51.449> to

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
the lines and how we had everything to

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.900 
the lines and how we had everything to
intersect<00:00:52.260> was<00:00:52.530> just<00:00:52.829> really<00:00:53.100> difficult<00:00:53.489> to

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
intersect was just really difficult to

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.420 
intersect was just really difficult to
work<00:00:54.090> out<00:00:54.420> and<00:00:54.899> just<00:00:55.199> required<00:00:55.590> a<00:00:55.739> lot<00:00:55.980> of<00:00:56.010> hand

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
work out and just required a lot of hand

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.520 
work out and just required a lot of hand
masking<00:00:57.000> well<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.390> lines<00:00:57.629> really<00:00:57.930> remind<00:00:58.379> me

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
masking well the lines really remind me

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:59.720 
masking well the lines really remind me
of<00:00:58.559> we<00:00:58.710> are<00:00:58.859> in<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.010> design<00:00:59.340> so<00:00:59.520> when<00:00:59.640> you're

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
of we are in the design so when you're

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.150 
of we are in the design so when you're
scanning<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.989> body<00:01:01.199> surface<00:01:01.590> day<00:01:01.920> that's

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
scanning the body surface day that's

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.950 
scanning the body surface day that's
what<00:01:02.370> really<00:01:02.609> reminds<00:01:03.059> us<00:01:03.149> like<00:01:03.329> it<00:01:03.660> looks

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
what really reminds us like it looks

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.899 
what really reminds us like it looks
like<00:01:04.140> an<00:01:04.290> engineering<00:01:04.890> blueprint<00:01:05.790> if<00:01:05.880> you

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
like an engineering blueprint if you

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.460 
like an engineering blueprint if you
will<00:01:06.000> from<00:01:06.240> certain<00:01:06.600> angles<00:01:06.750> that's<00:01:07.170> right

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
will from certain angles that's right

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.560 
will from certain angles that's right
and<00:01:07.920> light<00:01:08.220> as<00:01:08.460> with<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:08.850> vector<00:01:09.090> concept

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
and light as with the vector concept

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.289 
and light as with the vector concept
over<00:01:10.290> here<00:01:10.650> but<00:01:11.250> we<00:01:11.520> will<00:01:11.640> notice<00:01:12.000> that<00:01:12.150> in

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
over here but we will notice that in

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.420 
over here but we will notice that in
many<00:01:12.479> cases<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:13.080> lines<00:01:13.320> change<00:01:13.770> direction

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
many cases the lines change direction

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.490 
many cases the lines change direction
when<00:01:14.580> they<00:01:14.700> hit<00:01:14.850> a<00:01:14.909> particular<00:01:15.570> feature<00:01:16.140> on

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
when they hit a particular feature on

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.800 
when they hit a particular feature on
the<00:01:16.619> car<00:01:16.860> and<00:01:17.189> that<00:01:17.549> really<00:01:17.880> enhances<00:01:18.570> that<00:01:18.780> I

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
the car and that really enhances that I

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.600 
the car and that really enhances that I
think<00:01:19.170> kind<00:01:19.470> of<00:01:19.560> highlights<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.250> lines

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
think kind of highlights the lines

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.390 
think kind of highlights the lines
actual<00:01:21.360> lines<00:01:21.600> of<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:21.900> car<00:01:22.080> now<00:01:23.009> this<00:01:23.220> is

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
actual lines of the car now this is

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.399 
actual lines of the car now this is
really<00:01:23.939> stunning<00:01:24.210> let's<00:01:24.450> go<00:01:24.900> take<00:01:25.110> a<00:01:25.140> look<00:01:25.320> at

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
really stunning let's go take a look at

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.200 
really stunning let's go take a look at
the<00:01:25.500> interviews<00:01:25.920> yeah<00:01:26.130> we<00:01:26.430> did<00:01:26.610> a<00:01:26.640> ton<00:01:26.909> of<00:01:26.970> work

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
the interviews yeah we did a ton of work

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.410 
the interviews yeah we did a ton of work
on<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.509> interior<00:01:27.780> let's<00:01:28.110> take<00:01:28.290> a<00:01:28.320> look<00:01:29.420> this

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
on the interior let's take a look this

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.630 
on the interior let's take a look this
is<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.780> interior<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.470> ceramic<00:01:31.950> sex<00:01:32.159> Derek

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
is the interior the ceramic sex Derek

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.149 
is the interior the ceramic sex Derek
these<00:01:33.000> seats<00:01:33.420> they<00:01:34.409> don't<00:01:34.619> look<00:01:34.740> like<00:01:34.799> car

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
these seats they don't look like car

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.440 
these seats they don't look like car
seats<00:01:35.369> they<00:01:35.579> almost<00:01:35.700> look<00:01:35.939> like<00:01:35.970> fine

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
seats they almost look like fine

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.520 
seats they almost look like fine
furniture

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
furniture

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.260 
furniture
yeah<00:01:38.189> I<00:01:38.220> mean<00:01:38.430> it's<00:01:38.640> funny<00:01:38.880> you<00:01:39.030> say<00:01:39.240> that

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
yeah I mean it's funny you say that

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.910 
yeah I mean it's funny you say that
because<00:01:39.479> that<00:01:39.930> was<00:01:40.079> really<00:01:40.470> kind<00:01:40.650> of<00:01:40.770> the

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
because that was really kind of the

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.700 
because that was really kind of the
inspiration<00:01:41.240> we<00:01:42.240> were<00:01:42.329> looking<00:01:42.689> at<00:01:42.840> for

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
inspiration we were looking at for

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.149 
inspiration we were looking at for
design<00:01:44.090> fashion<00:01:45.090> design<00:01:45.690> think<00:01:46.500> of<00:01:46.650> like<00:01:46.830> fine

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
design fashion design think of like fine

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.760 
design fashion design think of like fine
leather<00:01:47.490> goods<00:01:47.880> and<00:01:48.299> shoes<00:01:48.900> I<00:01:49.260> know<00:01:49.320> it<00:01:49.500> sounds

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
leather goods and shoes I know it sounds

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:50.930 
leather goods and shoes I know it sounds
crazy<00:01:49.890> but<00:01:50.250> that's<00:01:50.369> kind<00:01:50.640> of<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.760> foundation

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:50.940 
crazy but that's kind of the foundation

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.359 
crazy but that's kind of the foundation
for<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.600> inspiration<00:01:52.229> and<00:01:52.680> you<00:01:52.770> can<00:01:52.920> see<00:01:53.130> here

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
for the inspiration and you can see here

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.310 
for the inspiration and you can see here
we've<00:01:53.520> taken<00:01:53.550> these<00:01:54.000> two<00:01:54.270> very<00:01:54.570> subtle<00:01:55.020> tones

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
we've taken these two very subtle tones

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.830 
we've taken these two very subtle tones
of<00:01:55.650> white<00:01:56.610> leather<00:01:56.880> and<00:01:57.270> then<00:01:57.659> we've

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
of white leather and then we've

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.810 
of white leather and then we've
interwoven<00:01:58.320> them<00:01:58.920> to<00:01:59.070> create<00:01:59.310> this<00:01:59.610> dynamic

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
interwoven them to create this dynamic

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.660 
interwoven them to create this dynamic
graphic<00:02:00.750> tied<00:02:01.290> into<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.740> exterior<00:02:02.280> and

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
graphic tied into the exterior and

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.219 
graphic tied into the exterior and
really<00:02:03.210> gives<00:02:03.479> this<00:02:03.659> feeling<00:02:04.110> of

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
really gives this feeling of

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.980 
really gives this feeling of
sophistication<00:02:05.149> to<00:02:06.149> the<00:02:06.270> car<00:02:06.509> and<00:02:06.720> I<00:02:06.750> think

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
sophistication to the car and I think

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.840 
sophistication to the car and I think
that's<00:02:07.170> something<00:02:07.500> that<00:02:07.920> we've<00:02:08.489> been<00:02:08.520> trying

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:08.850 
that's something that we've been trying

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:10.820 
that's something that we've been trying
to<00:02:09.030> do<00:02:09.179> throughout<00:02:09.509> our<00:02:09.810> interiors<00:02:10.380> even<00:02:10.679> down

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
to do throughout our interiors even down

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.130 
to do throughout our interiors even down
to<00:02:11.009> things<00:02:11.220> like<00:02:11.340> fine<00:02:12.180> stitching<00:02:12.630> on<00:02:13.020> the

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
to things like fine stitching on the

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.890 
to things like fine stitching on the
dash<00:02:13.380> and<00:02:13.860> on<00:02:13.950> the<00:02:14.040> seats<00:02:14.400> really<00:02:15.120> creating

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
dash and on the seats really creating

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.080 
dash and on the seats really creating
this<00:02:16.050> theme<00:02:16.350> throughout<00:02:16.769> the<00:02:16.980> interior<00:02:17.310> again

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
this theme throughout the interior again

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.199 
this theme throughout the interior again
you<00:02:18.360> normally<00:02:19.170> don't<00:02:19.380> see<00:02:19.470> this<00:02:19.920> in<00:02:20.130> a<00:02:20.670> vehicle

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
you normally don't see this in a vehicle

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:22.790 
you normally don't see this in a vehicle
in<00:02:21.300> this<00:02:21.450> class<00:02:21.750> and<00:02:22.080> that's<00:02:22.140> kind<00:02:22.500> of<00:02:22.560> a<00:02:22.620> big

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
in this class and that's kind of a big

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.890 
in this class and that's kind of a big
priority<00:02:23.070> for<00:02:23.610> us<00:02:23.640> with<00:02:24.480> our<00:02:24.600> interior

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
designs at Mazda I mean I think when

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.440 
designs at Mazda I mean I think when
people<00:02:28.440> get<00:02:28.830> in<00:02:28.980> the<00:02:29.160> regular<00:02:29.670> Mazda<00:02:30.120> 6

said that's our priority right now
that's<00:02:44.790> where<00:02:44.940> our<00:02:45.000> design<00:02:45.450> is<00:02:45.600> really<00:02:45.780> really

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
that's where our design is really really

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.229 
that's where our design is really really
focused<00:02:46.620> great<00:02:47.160> job<00:02:47.430> we<00:02:47.610> can't<00:02:47.820> wait<00:02:47.970> to<00:02:48.090> see

products<00:02:54.230> so<00:02:55.230> now<00:02:55.380> we're<00:02:55.590> looking<00:02:55.680> at<00:02:55.829> the

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
products so now we're looking at the

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.340 
products so now we're looking at the
vector<00:02:56.250> three<00:02:56.820> what's<00:02:57.030> alright<00:02:57.480> did<00:02:58.019> the<00:02:58.140> name

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
vector three what's alright did the name

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.140 
vector three what's alright did the name
come<00:02:58.380> before<00:02:58.799> the<00:02:59.070> design<00:02:59.430> or<00:02:59.640> did<00:02:59.760> you<00:02:59.880> name

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
come before the design or did you name

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:01.729 
come before the design or did you name
it<00:03:00.390> after<00:03:00.690> you<00:03:00.989> designed<00:03:01.350> it

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
it after you designed it

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:03.740 
it after you designed it
no<00:03:01.980> we<00:03:02.280> named<00:03:02.489> it<00:03:02.610> after<00:03:02.760> we<00:03:03.060> designed<00:03:03.450> it<00:03:03.600> but

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
no we named it after we designed it but

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.140 
no we named it after we designed it but
in<00:03:03.989> designing<00:03:04.799> it<00:03:05.130> you<00:03:05.310> know<00:03:05.430> it's<00:03:05.700> all<00:03:05.850> about

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
in designing it you know it's all about

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:07.610 
in designing it you know it's all about
what<00:03:06.450> we've<00:03:06.570> been<00:03:06.690> calling<00:03:06.930> these<00:03:07.170> vector

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
what we've been calling these vector

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.509 
what we've been calling these vector
graphics<00:03:08.250> and<00:03:08.820> this<00:03:08.940> is<00:03:09.120> also<00:03:09.329> all<00:03:09.660> about<00:03:09.959> this

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:10.519 
graphics and this is also all about this

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:13.340 
graphics and this is also all about this
progressive<00:03:11.519> line<00:03:11.760> work<00:03:12.120> that<00:03:12.660> kind<00:03:12.840> of<00:03:12.959> front

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
progressive line work that kind of front

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:16.250 
progressive line work that kind of front
fragments<00:03:14.130> in<00:03:14.519> two<00:03:14.820> separate<00:03:15.690> lines<00:03:15.930> and

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
fragments in two separate lines and

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:17.960 
fragments in two separate lines and
creates<00:03:16.560> kind<00:03:16.739> of<00:03:16.860> motion<00:03:17.430> you<00:03:17.579> know<00:03:17.730> and

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
creates kind of motion you know and

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.690 
creates kind of motion you know and
we're<00:03:18.930> trying<00:03:19.170> to<00:03:19.230> think<00:03:19.410> of<00:03:19.500> the<00:03:19.590> name<00:03:19.799> and<00:03:20.100> we

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
we're trying to think of the name and we

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.220 
we're trying to think of the name and we
just<00:03:20.730> came<00:03:21.000> up<00:03:21.030> with<00:03:21.180> vector<00:03:21.690> like<00:03:21.840> vector

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
just came up with vector like vector

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:23.460 
just came up with vector like vector
graphics<00:03:22.769> you

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
graphics you

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.790 
graphics you
and<00:03:23.560> it's<00:03:24.370> in<00:03:24.490> the<00:03:24.670> name<00:03:24.850> stock<00:03:25.180> you<00:03:25.660> know

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:25.800 
and it's in the name stock you know

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.290 
and it's in the name stock you know
former<00:03:26.800> engineer<00:03:26.980> you<00:03:27.580> know<00:03:27.670> a<00:03:27.700> vector<00:03:28.120> is<00:03:28.270> a

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:28.300 
former engineer you know a vector is a

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:30.780 
former engineer you know a vector is a
force<00:03:28.720> and<00:03:29.110> a<00:03:29.230> direction<00:03:29.440> so<00:03:30.040> that's<00:03:30.490> kind<00:03:30.730> of

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
force and a direction so that's kind of

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.030 
force and a direction so that's kind of
fitting<00:03:31.150> for<00:03:31.300> this<00:03:31.450> but<00:03:31.750> these<00:03:32.230> graphics<00:03:32.890> are

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
fitting for this but these graphics are

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.490 
fitting for this but these graphics are
stunning<00:03:33.400> I<00:03:33.850> hope<00:03:34.510> to<00:03:34.690> show<00:03:34.840> up<00:03:34.960> on<00:03:35.080> the<00:03:35.170> video

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
stunning I hope to show up on the video

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.680 
stunning I hope to show up on the video
because<00:03:36.100> they're<00:03:36.280> really<00:03:36.550> subtle<00:03:37.120> and<00:03:37.300> almost

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:37.690 
because they're really subtle and almost

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:40.230 
because they're really subtle and almost
a<00:03:38.020> ghost<00:03:38.230> light<00:03:38.620> and<00:03:39.400> these<00:03:39.610> are<00:03:39.820> really

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:40.240 
a ghost light and these are really

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.990 
a ghost light and these are really
affected<00:03:40.810> by<00:03:40.840> the<00:03:41.530> light<00:03:41.740> especially<00:03:42.100> outside

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
affected by the light especially outside

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.930 
affected by the light especially outside
so<00:03:43.360> when<00:03:43.510> you<00:03:43.630> see<00:03:43.900> it<00:03:43.990> in<00:03:44.170> a<00:03:44.410> mid-day<00:03:45.160> you<00:03:45.730> get

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:45.940 
so when you see it in a mid-day you get

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.840 
so when you see it in a mid-day you get
this<00:03:46.090> really<00:03:46.390> cool<00:03:46.570> gradation<00:03:47.530> effect<00:03:47.850> over

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:48.850 
this really cool gradation effect over

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:51.120 
this really cool gradation effect over
the<00:03:48.880> car<00:03:49.210> and<00:03:49.480> what's<00:03:49.720> really<00:03:50.020> cool<00:03:50.200> here<00:03:50.710> the

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.130 
the car and what's really cool here the

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.280 
the car and what's really cool here the
base<00:03:51.340> paint<00:03:51.730> of<00:03:51.970> the<00:03:52.090> car<00:03:52.300> is<00:03:52.450> so<00:03:52.690> red<00:03:53.020> just

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
base paint of the car is so red just

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:55.110 
base paint of the car is so red just
like<00:03:53.470> our<00:03:53.650> production<00:03:54.160> but<00:03:54.610> then<00:03:54.790> we<00:03:54.910> came

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
like our production but then we came

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.210 
like our production but then we came
through<00:03:55.450> and<00:03:55.660> made<00:03:55.900> three<00:03:56.290> other<00:03:56.530> shades<00:03:56.950> of

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
through and made three other shades of

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.480 
through and made three other shades of
red<00:03:57.660> it<00:03:58.660> starts<00:03:59.110> with<00:03:59.290> the<00:03:59.440> light<00:03:59.680> it<00:03:59.890> lightest

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:00.490 
red it starts with the light it lightest

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:02.640 
red it starts with the light it lightest
and<00:04:00.700> then<00:04:00.940> slightly<00:04:01.360> darker<00:04:01.990> and<00:04:02.200> as<00:04:02.290> we<00:04:02.440> move

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
and then slightly darker and as we move

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:05.010 
and then slightly darker and as we move
down<00:04:02.890> the<00:04:02.950> side<00:04:03.370> of<00:04:03.400> the<00:04:03.580> car<00:04:03.820> it<00:04:04.210> gets<00:04:04.480> darker

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:05.020 
down the side of the car it gets darker

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:07.230 
down the side of the car it gets darker
and<00:04:05.230> then<00:04:05.650> darker<00:04:06.220> once<00:04:06.460> again<00:04:06.850> all<00:04:07.030> the<00:04:07.120> way

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:07.240 
and then darker once again all the way

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:09.480 
and then darker once again all the way
at<00:04:07.360> the<00:04:07.390> base<00:04:07.630> so<00:04:08.290> when<00:04:08.470> it's<00:04:08.620> outside<00:04:09.070> you<00:04:09.340> get

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:09.490 
at the base so when it's outside you get

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:12.360 
at the base so when it's outside you get
this<00:04:09.670> really<00:04:10.030> cool<00:04:10.270> shaded<00:04:11.080> effect<00:04:11.470> it<00:04:12.310> really

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:12.370 
this really cool shaded effect it really

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:14.370 
this really cool shaded effect it really
enhances<00:04:13.210> the<00:04:13.240> overall<00:04:13.720> kind<00:04:13.960> of<00:04:14.110> shadow

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:14.380 
enhances the overall kind of shadow

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:16.349 
enhances the overall kind of shadow
graphics<00:04:15.010> that<00:04:15.250> that<00:04:15.820> we've<00:04:16.030> been<00:04:16.150> developing

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359 
graphics that that we've been developing

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:18.780 
graphics that that we've been developing
and<00:04:17.140> another<00:04:17.590> key<00:04:17.830> point<00:04:18.160> here<00:04:18.220> is<00:04:18.370> just<00:04:18.489> the

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:18.790 
and another key point here is just the

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:21.840 
and another key point here is just the
dynamic<00:04:19.390> of<00:04:19.510> the<00:04:19.690> the<00:04:20.410> lines<00:04:20.680> these<00:04:21.310> kind<00:04:21.730> of

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:21.850 
dynamic of the the lines these kind of

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:24.330 
dynamic of the the lines these kind of
vector<00:04:22.030> lines<00:04:22.480> start<00:04:23.290> up<00:04:23.470> front<00:04:23.800> and<00:04:24.040> as<00:04:24.190> they

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 
vector lines start up front and as they

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:26.400 
vector lines start up front and as they
go<00:04:24.490> down<00:04:24.640> the<00:04:24.820> side<00:04:25.090> of<00:04:25.120> the<00:04:25.360> car<00:04:25.570> again<00:04:26.260> they

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.410 
go down the side of the car again they

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:28.470 
go down the side of the car again they
kind<00:04:26.590> of<00:04:26.680> enhance<00:04:27.100> the<00:04:27.340> lines<00:04:27.610> of<00:04:27.850> the<00:04:27.940> car<00:04:28.150> and

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:28.480 
kind of enhance the lines of the car and

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:30.659 
kind of enhance the lines of the car and
you<00:04:28.810> see<00:04:29.080> there's<00:04:29.320> like<00:04:29.500> intersections<00:04:30.430> that

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:30.669 
you see there's like intersections that

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:32.670 
you see there's like intersections that
take<00:04:30.880> place<00:04:31.090> and<00:04:31.480> then<00:04:31.900> it<00:04:32.020> breaks<00:04:32.260> into<00:04:32.650> a

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:32.680 
take place and then it breaks into a

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.250 
take place and then it breaks into a
smaller<00:04:33.160> area<00:04:33.310> and<00:04:34.000> kind<00:04:34.510> of<00:04:34.630> creates<00:04:35.020> this

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:35.260 
smaller area and kind of creates this

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.680 
smaller area and kind of creates this
reflection<00:04:35.800> type<00:04:36.250> quality<00:04:36.790> to<00:04:37.210> the<00:04:37.330> rear<00:04:37.540> of

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:37.690 
reflection type quality to the rear of

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:39.600 
reflection type quality to the rear of
the<00:04:37.780> car<00:04:38.020> and<00:04:38.530> all<00:04:38.770> of<00:04:38.950> this<00:04:39.040> is<00:04:39.220> meant<00:04:39.430> to<00:04:39.520> be

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:39.610 
the car and all of this is meant to be

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:42.030 
the car and all of this is meant to be
somewhat<00:04:40.330> subtle<00:04:40.690> you<00:04:41.169> know<00:04:41.320> but<00:04:41.890> still

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:42.040 
somewhat subtle you know but still

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:44.490 
somewhat subtle you know but still
enhancing<00:04:42.880> the<00:04:43.000> overall<00:04:43.030> dynamic<00:04:44.020> and<00:04:44.169> design

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:44.500 
enhancing the overall dynamic and design

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.380 
enhancing the overall dynamic and design
of<00:04:44.530> the<00:04:44.710> car<00:04:44.950> and<00:04:45.460> this<00:04:45.580> is<00:04:45.730> all<00:04:45.850> pure<00:04:46.120> paint

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:46.390 
of the car and this is all pure paint

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:48.220 
of the car and this is all pure paint
this<00:04:46.600> is<00:04:46.720> not<00:04:46.870> graphics<00:04:47.470> this<00:04:47.620> is<00:04:47.680> paint

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:48.230 
this is not graphics this is paint

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:50.590 
this is not graphics this is paint
yeah<00:04:48.620> you'll<00:04:48.800> see<00:04:48.890> ton<00:04:49.250> of<00:04:49.280> raps<00:04:49.820> here<00:04:50.180> at<00:04:50.360> SEMA
