now<00:00:54.989> I'm<00:00:55.320> going<00:00:55.620> to<00:00:55.800> use<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:56.489> pH<00:00:57.239> paper<00:00:57.890> to

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
now I'm going to use the pH paper to

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.750 
now I'm going to use the pH paper to
test<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.760> different<00:01:00.149> pH<00:01:00.870> levels<00:01:01.289> in<00:01:01.760> these

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
test the different pH levels in these

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.329 
test the different pH levels in these
three<00:01:03.449> orange<00:01:03.870> juice<00:01:04.019> drinks<00:01:04.350> I<00:01:04.530> will<00:01:04.979> first

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
three orange juice drinks I will first

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.580 
three orange juice drinks I will first
start<00:01:05.489> with<00:01:05.939> Florida's<00:01:06.930> natural<00:01:07.080> orange

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
start with Florida's natural orange

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:17.910 
start with Florida's natural orange
juice<00:01:08.750> dip<00:01:09.750> it<00:01:09.900> in<00:01:13.790> bring<00:01:14.790> out

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:17.920 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:26.590 

it<00:01:18.920> looks<00:01:19.130> to<00:01:19.310> be<00:01:19.490> a<00:01:20.439> number<00:01:21.439> four<00:01:25.240> now<00:01:26.240> I'm

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
it looks to be a number four now I'm

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:38.840 
it looks to be a number four now I'm
going<00:01:26.960> to<00:01:27.080> test<00:01:27.290> the<00:01:28.070> Sunny<00:01:28.369> D<00:01:28.640> orange<00:01:29.240> juice

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:46.410 

seems<00:01:39.850> to<00:01:40.060> be<00:01:40.240> and<00:01:40.570> number<00:01:41.229> three<00:01:45.180> now<00:01:46.180> I'll

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
seems to be and number three now I'll

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:58.419 
seems to be and number three now I'll
try<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:48.100> fresh-squeezed<00:01:48.850> orange<00:01:49.149> juice

00:01:58.419 --> 00:01:58.429 

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:07.109 

seems<00:01:59.090> to<00:01:59.270> be<00:01:59.299> about<00:01:59.630> a<00:01:59.689> number<00:02:00.109> four<00:02:00.350> as<00:02:00.500> well

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:09.580 

from<00:02:08.119> this<00:02:08.269> experiment<00:02:08.869> we<00:02:08.959> can<00:02:09.349> conclude

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
from this experiment we can conclude

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.330 
from this experiment we can conclude
that<00:02:10.180> since<00:02:11.180> Sunny<00:02:11.510> D<00:02:11.750> is<00:02:11.989> lower<00:02:12.470> on<00:02:12.800> the<00:02:13.010> pH

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
that since Sunny D is lower on the pH

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.860 
that since Sunny D is lower on the pH
scale<00:02:14.530> it<00:02:15.530> has<00:02:15.769> a<00:02:15.799> higher<00:02:16.099> content<00:02:16.670> of

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
scale it has a higher content of

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.930 
scale it has a higher content of
ascorbic<00:02:17.870> acid
