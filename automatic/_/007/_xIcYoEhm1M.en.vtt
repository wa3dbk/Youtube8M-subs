00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:05.300 

today<00:00:01.410> so<00:00:01.469> this<00:00:01.979> is<00:00:02.250> my<00:00:02.790> gps<00:00:03.480> test<00:00:04.110> video<00:00:04.710> of

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
today so this is my gps test video of

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.950 
today so this is my gps test video of
we're<00:00:05.819> coming<00:00:06.120> and<00:00:06.270> going<00:00:06.509> at<00:00:07.370> 500<00:00:08.370> 500<00:00:09.360> 6<00:00:09.690> k's

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
we're coming and going at 500 500 6 k's

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.970 
we're coming and going at 500 500 6 k's
an<00:00:10.200> hour<00:00:11.150> seems<00:00:12.150> to<00:00:12.630> be<00:00:12.780> working<00:00:13.500> pretty<00:00:13.860> well

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
an hour seems to be working pretty well

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.000 
an hour seems to be working pretty well
I<00:00:14.160> got<00:00:14.429> the<00:00:14.549> update<00:00:14.670> frequency<00:00:15.210> in<00:00:15.540> this<00:00:15.660> one

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:16.010 
I got the update frequency in this one

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:19.550 
I got the update frequency in this one
10<00:00:17.010> updates<00:00:17.490> a<00:00:17.640> second<00:00:18.029> delay<00:00:18.900> is<00:00:19.109> currently

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
10 updates a second delay is currently

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.000 
10 updates a second delay is currently
around<00:00:20.210> 30<00:00:21.210> to<00:00:21.480> 40<00:00:21.900> milliseconds<00:00:22.289> as<00:00:22.830> well

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
around 30 to 40 milliseconds as well

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.429 
around 30 to 40 milliseconds as well
I've<00:00:23.130> estimated<00:00:23.730> at<00:00:23.820> the<00:00:23.939> measured<00:00:24.269> speed<00:00:24.630> so

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
I've estimated at the measured speed so

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.710 
I've estimated at the measured speed so
it<00:00:25.529> seems<00:00:25.710> correct<00:00:26.010> very<00:00:26.400> well<00:00:26.720> direct

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
it seems correct very well direct

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.060 
it seems correct very well direct
sunlight<00:00:29.210> during<00:00:30.210> sunlight<00:00:30.570> and<00:00:30.869> test

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
sunlight during sunlight and test

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.430 
sunlight during sunlight and test
shallow<00:00:32.910> to<00:00:33.060> see<00:00:33.360> and<00:00:33.540> direct<00:00:33.900> sunlight<00:00:34.910> but

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:36.440 
shallow to see and direct sunlight but

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:44.140 
shallow to see and direct sunlight but
some<00:00:37.440> kind<00:00:37.710> of<00:00:37.770> shielding<00:00:38.220> device<00:00:38.250> like<00:00:38.760> this

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:44.150 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:48.940 

I<00:00:46.270> want<00:00:47.270> to<00:00:47.360> get<00:00:47.450> that<00:00:47.600> matter<00:00:47.780> but<00:00:48.470> something

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:48.950 
I want to get that matter but something

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.130 
I want to get that matter but something
like<00:00:49.100> that<00:00:49.280> seems<00:00:50.000> to<00:00:50.180> work<00:00:50.330> for<00:00:50.660> direct

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:51.140 
like that seems to work for direct

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.530 
like that seems to work for direct
sunlight<00:00:51.640> so<00:00:52.640> as<00:00:52.850> you<00:00:52.910> can<00:00:53.030> see<00:00:53.180> the<00:00:53.300> numbers

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:53.540 
sunlight so as you can see the numbers

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.720 
sunlight so as you can see the numbers
flickering<00:00:54.320> just<00:00:54.620> randomly<00:00:55.070> we're<00:00:55.340> counting

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 
flickering just randomly we're counting

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:00.440 
flickering just randomly we're counting
cruise<00:00:56.480> control<00:00:56.540> mode<00:00:57.700> dad<00:00:58.700> can<00:00:58.910> you

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:00.450 
cruise control mode dad can you

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:02.150 
cruise control mode dad can you
take<00:01:00.870> it<00:01:00.990> off<00:01:01.080> cruise<00:01:01.290> control<00:01:01.650> just<00:01:01.860> inside

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
take it off cruise control just inside

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.470 
take it off cruise control just inside
the<00:01:02.340> burial

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
the burial

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.119 
the burial
speedo<00:01:03.720> very<00:01:04.110> little<00:01:04.409> just<00:01:04.440> they<00:01:04.650> can<00:01:04.830> see<00:01:05.040> it

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
speedo very little just they can see it

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.750 
speedo very little just they can see it
change<00:01:05.400> up<00:01:05.550> and<00:01:05.729> down

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:14.440 

see<00:01:09.300> like<00:01:09.480> going<00:01:09.720> up<00:01:09.840> and<00:01:09.990> down

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.450 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.499 

so<00:01:15.020> that<00:01:15.140> seems<00:01:15.409> to<00:01:15.560> be<00:01:15.729> pretty<00:01:16.729> done<00:01:17.090> I<00:01:17.119> kind

00:01:17.499 --> 00:01:17.509 
so that seems to be pretty done I kind

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:22.680 
so that seems to be pretty done I kind
of<00:01:17.570> dead<00:01:17.810> speak<00:01:18.500> to

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:22.690 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:24.720 

that's<00:01:23.200> according<00:01:23.470> the<00:01:23.680> effect<00:01:23.980> true<00:01:24.580> to

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:24.730 
that's according the effect true to

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:28.940 
that's according the effect true to
ground<00:01:25.000> not<00:01:26.670> taking<00:01:27.670> their<00:01:27.820> County

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
ground not taking their County

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.060 
ground not taking their County
altitude<00:01:29.960> so<00:01:30.960> it's<00:01:31.200> your<00:01:31.409> horizontal<00:01:31.680> vector

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
altitude so it's your horizontal vector

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.180 
altitude so it's your horizontal vector
not<00:01:32.430> your<00:01:32.610> actual<00:01:32.759> true

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:35.190 
not your actual true

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.070 
not your actual true
and<00:01:35.970> yes<00:01:36.420> that's<00:01:36.840> good<00:01:36.960> night

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.080 
and yes that's good night

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.710 
and yes that's good night
we're<00:01:38.800> going<00:01:38.920> in<00:01:39.130> a<00:01:39.190> tunnel<00:01:39.490> now<00:01:39.760> under<00:01:40.690> a

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:40.720 
we're going in a tunnel now under a

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.050 
we're going in a tunnel now under a
bridge<00:01:41.050> seems<00:01:41.680> to<00:01:41.860> think<00:01:42.280> a<00:01:42.370> slightly<00:01:42.700> when<00:01:42.970> it

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
bridge seems to think a slightly when it

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.450 
bridge seems to think a slightly when it
goes<00:01:43.180> under<00:01:43.330> a<00:01:43.420> bridge<00:01:43.750> I'm<00:01:43.870> going<00:01:44.020> to<00:01:44.080> have<00:01:44.200> to

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
goes under a bridge I'm going to have to

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.670 
goes under a bridge I'm going to have to
do<00:01:45.460> something<00:01:45.730> about<00:01:45.940> that<00:01:46.260> instead<00:01:47.260> of<00:01:47.320> cut

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:47.680 
do something about that instead of cut

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.010 
do something about that instead of cut
off<00:01:47.800> so<00:01:48.100> see<00:01:48.820> the<00:01:48.940> tunnel<00:01:49.330> just<00:01:49.510> coming<00:01:49.930> on

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
off so see the tunnel just coming on

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:55.620 
off so see the tunnel just coming on
here

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.899 

guys<00:01:56.200> back<00:01:56.380> up<00:01:56.590> allows<00:01:57.219> much<00:01:57.460> smoother<00:01:57.789> than

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:57.909 
guys back up allows much smoother than

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:01.330 
guys back up allows much smoother than
normal<00:01:58.240> actually

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:07.380 

to<00:02:02.210> reset<00:02:02.719> the<00:02:02.869> chip<00:02:03.140> there's

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.340 

there's<00:02:07.840> a<00:02:07.900> full<00:02:08.080> system<00:02:08.440> reset<00:02:08.830> on<00:02:08.950> the<00:02:08.979> other

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
there's a full system reset on the other

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:12.090 
there's a full system reset on the other
electronics<00:02:11.350> that<00:02:11.560> seems<00:02:11.740> to<00:02:11.830> work<00:02:11.950> pretty

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
electronics that seems to work pretty

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.620 
electronics that seems to work pretty
well<00:02:12.280> as<00:02:12.550> a<00:02:12.580> reset<00:02:13.120> button

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
well as a reset button

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.200 
well as a reset button
but<00:02:15.170> yeah<00:02:15.290> I'm<00:02:15.580> press<00:02:16.580> with<00:02:16.790> that<00:02:16.910> that<00:02:17.060> seems

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:17.210 
but yeah I'm press with that that seems

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:18.700 
but yeah I'm press with that that seems
to<00:02:17.360> be<00:02:17.390> good<00:02:17.600> enough

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:18.710 
to be good enough

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:21.820 
to be good enough
play<00:02:18.890> that<00:02:18.920> should<00:02:19.400> work
