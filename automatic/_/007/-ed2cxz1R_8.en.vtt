approximately<00:03:21.710> I<00:03:22.550> would<00:03:22.820> say<00:03:23.030> maybe<00:03:23.240> eight

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
approximately I would say maybe eight

approximately I would say maybe eight
inches<00:03:24.080> to<00:03:24.350> a<00:03:24.830> foot<00:03:25.160> route<00:03:25.730> it<00:03:26.450> was<00:03:26.600> moving

inches to a foot route it was moving
through<00:03:27.140> the<00:03:27.230> water<00:03:27.470> very<00:03:27.890> very<00:03:27.950> quickly

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
through the water very very quickly

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.430 
through the water very very quickly
probably<00:03:28.610> 20<00:03:29.120> miles<00:03:29.330> an<00:03:29.540> hour<00:03:29.630> to<00:03:29.960> start<00:03:30.230> with

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
probably 20 miles an hour to start with

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.110 
probably 20 miles an hour to start with
and<00:03:30.650> then<00:03:30.710> accelerate<00:03:31.310> it's<00:03:31.490> approximately

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
and then accelerate it's approximately

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.990 
and then accelerate it's approximately
40<00:03:32.480> miles<00:03:32.630> an<00:03:32.900> hour
