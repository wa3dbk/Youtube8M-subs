you know primarily I try to find
something<00:00:13.720> to<00:00:13.750> do<00:00:13.990> like<00:00:14.290> lately<00:00:14.590> it's<00:00:14.830> been

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:14.950 
something to do like lately it's been

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:16.529 
something to do like lately it's been
this<00:00:15.070> chromatic<00:00:15.520> scale<00:00:15.760> in<00:00:16.000> a<00:00:16.059> couple

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:16.539 
this chromatic scale in a couple

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:19.019 
this chromatic scale in a couple
positions<00:00:17.199> I<00:00:17.230> don't<00:00:18.039> know<00:00:18.130> trying<00:00:18.759> to<00:00:18.820> find

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:19.029 
positions I don't know trying to find

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:21.720 
positions I don't know trying to find
like<00:00:19.179> a<00:00:19.210> scale<00:00:19.570> the<00:00:20.380> directive<00:00:21.160> practice<00:00:21.550> is

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:21.730 
like a scale the directive practice is

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:23.999 
like a scale the directive practice is
really<00:00:21.880> redundant<00:00:22.539> it's<00:00:23.199> a<00:00:23.259> discipline<00:00:23.739> thing

00:00:23.999 --> 00:00:24.009 
really redundant it's a discipline thing

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:28.290 
really redundant it's a discipline thing
it's<00:00:24.609> better<00:00:24.849> if<00:00:25.149> by<00:00:25.919> if<00:00:26.919> I<00:00:27.099> start<00:00:27.399> like<00:00:28.119> with<00:00:28.269> a

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:28.300 
it's better if by if I start like with a

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.790 
it's better if by if I start like with a
lick<00:00:28.570> or<00:00:28.719> something<00:00:29.079> that<00:00:29.259> I've<00:00:29.380> been<00:00:29.559> trying

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:29.800

lick or something that I've been trying
to<00:00:29.949> work<00:00:30.160> on<00:00:30.369> or<00:00:30.640> something<00:00:30.939> like<00:00:31.059> that

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
to work on or something like that

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.530 
to work on or something like that
there's<00:00:33.070> a<00:00:33.159> lick<00:00:33.399> that<00:00:33.640> I've<00:00:33.970> been<00:00:34.120> doing<00:00:34.390> in

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:34.540 
there's a lick that I've been doing in

in
and<00:00:36.449> do<00:00:37.230> it<00:00:37.260> for<00:00:37.469> the<00:00:37.530> kids<00:00:37.769> at<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.039> end<00:00:38.219> which

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.170 

it's<00:01:07.560> just<00:01:08.070> an<00:01:08.159> exercise<00:01:08.399> really<00:01:08.850> and

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
it's just an exercise really and

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:19.910 
it's just an exercise really and
something<00:01:09.659> I<00:01:09.689> made<00:01:09.869> up<00:01:10.020> just<00:01:10.170> to

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:32.790 

I<00:01:20.030> noticed<00:01:21.030> like<00:01:21.090> they<00:01:21.240> can<00:01:21.360> do<00:01:21.479> that<00:01:21.630> they<00:01:22.020> go

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:32.800 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:39.540 

you

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:39.550 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:42.810 

I<00:01:39.840> just<00:01:40.840> play<00:01:41.170> just<00:01:41.590> you<00:01:41.800> know<00:01:41.920> you<00:01:41.980> just<00:01:42.610> sit

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 
I just play just you know you just sit

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.730 
I just play just you know you just sit
down<00:01:42.850> over<00:01:43.060> the<00:01:43.180> guitar<00:01:43.330> and<00:01:43.840> just<00:01:44.050> do

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:44.740 
down over the guitar and just do

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.520 
down over the guitar and just do
whatever<00:01:44.920> for<00:01:45.460> you<00:01:46.210> know<00:01:46.330> a<00:01:46.660> half<00:01:46.990> an<00:01:47.140> hour<00:01:47.260> or

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
whatever for you know a half an hour or

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.340 
whatever for you know a half an hour or
an<00:01:47.650> hour<00:01:47.770> whatever<00:01:48.460> that's<00:01:49.270> pretty<00:01:49.480> much<00:01:49.660> that

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 
an hour whatever that's pretty much that

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.570 
an hour whatever that's pretty much that
should<00:01:50.590> do<00:01:50.710> it<00:01:50.740> I<00:01:51.280> try<00:01:52.270> and<00:01:52.330> just<00:01:52.510> sit<00:01:52.840> and<00:01:53.580> see

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:54.580 
should do it I try and just sit and see

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.040 
should do it I try and just sit and see
maybe<00:01:54.790> there<00:01:55.060> might<00:01:55.210> be<00:01:55.240> a<00:01:55.360> riff<00:01:55.570> I'm<00:01:55.750> working

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:56.050 
maybe there might be a riff I'm working

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:58.370 
maybe there might be a riff I'm working
on<00:01:56.170> so<00:01:56.500> then<00:01:56.650> that<00:01:56.890> gives<00:01:56.920> me<00:01:57.160> something<00:01:57.370> to<00:01:57.580> do

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
on so then that gives me something to do

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.600 
on so then that gives me something to do
hit<00:01:59.380> like<00:01:59.560> that<00:01:59.830> one<00:02:00.040> lick<00:02:00.250> that<00:02:00.400> I<00:02:00.490> was

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610 
hit like that one lick that I was

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:02.880 
hit like that one lick that I was
talking<00:02:00.790> about<00:02:01.000> was<00:02:01.600> something<00:02:02.200> I<00:02:02.410> started<00:02:02.830> to

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
talking about was something I started to

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:04.470 
talking about was something I started to
do<00:02:03.040> one<00:02:03.250> night<00:02:03.460> and<00:02:03.700> I<00:02:03.730> didn't<00:02:04.060> finish<00:02:04.180> it

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:04.480 
do one night and I didn't finish it

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:05.700 
do one night and I didn't finish it
because<00:02:04.720> it<00:02:04.840> wasn't<00:02:04.990> really<00:02:05.230> sure<00:02:05.380> what<00:02:05.590> it

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
because it wasn't really sure what it

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.650 
because it wasn't really sure what it
was<00:02:05.860> so<00:02:06.460> I<00:02:06.520> thought<00:02:06.700> well<00:02:06.820> let's<00:02:06.850> expand<00:02:07.510> on

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:07.660 
was so I thought well let's expand on

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:08.700 
was so I thought well let's expand on
that<00:02:07.690> and<00:02:07.930> see<00:02:08.050> what<00:02:08.170> that<00:02:08.230> is

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:08.710 
that and see what that is

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:10.350 
that and see what that is
and<00:02:09.040> so<00:02:09.220> that<00:02:09.369> just<00:02:09.399> did<00:02:09.820> give<00:02:10.030> yourself

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
and so that just did give yourself

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.480 
and so that just did give yourself
something<00:02:10.540> set<00:02:11.200> to<00:02:11.410> work<00:02:11.590> on<00:02:11.800> if<00:02:12.130> you're<00:02:12.370> just

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.490 
something set to work on if you're just

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:13.890 
something set to work on if you're just
playing<00:02:12.790> a<00:02:12.940> scale<00:02:13.210> of<00:02:13.420> it<00:02:13.540> sounds<00:02:13.750> pretty

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
playing a scale of it sounds pretty

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.750 
playing a scale of it sounds pretty
mind-numbing<00:02:14.530> and<00:02:14.890> you're<00:02:15.070> not<00:02:15.220> really<00:02:15.610> doing

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
mind-numbing and you're not really doing

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.480 
mind-numbing and you're not really doing
anything<00:02:16.120> you're<00:02:16.840> just<00:02:16.870> sort<00:02:17.230> of<00:02:17.290> like<00:02:17.530> you<00:02:18.310> go

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
anything you're just sort of like you go

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:20.100 
anything you're just sort of like you go
like<00:02:18.790> played<00:02:19.120> a<00:02:19.150> high<00:02:19.390> speed<00:02:19.660> I<00:02:19.690> can<00:02:19.810> do<00:02:19.930> it<00:02:20.050> a

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
like played a high speed I can do it a

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:21.720 
like played a high speed I can do it a
slow<00:02:20.320> speed<00:02:20.590> I<00:02:20.710> can<00:02:20.890> work<00:02:21.040> up<00:02:21.190> a<00:02:21.370> little<00:02:21.610> speed

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
slow speed I can work up a little speed

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.520 
slow speed I can work up a little speed
as<00:02:21.970> fast<00:02:22.000> it's<00:02:22.450> just<00:02:22.630> somehow<00:02:23.140> you<00:02:23.320> get

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
as fast it's just somehow you get

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.410 
as fast it's just somehow you get
distracted<00:02:23.770> doing<00:02:24.730> that<00:02:24.910> because<00:02:25.090> it's<00:02:25.240> not

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
distracted doing that because it's not

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.290 
distracted doing that because it's not
really<00:02:25.780> engaging<00:02:26.530> you<00:02:26.860> you<00:02:27.700> know<00:02:27.820> every<00:02:28.180> week

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
really engaging you you know every week

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:29.760 
really engaging you you know every week
it<00:02:28.450> has<00:02:28.600> a<00:02:28.690> book<00:02:28.870> of<00:02:28.990> scales<00:02:29.230> somewhere<00:02:29.650> around

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
it has a book of scales somewhere around

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.040 
it has a book of scales somewhere around
and<00:02:30.220> I<00:02:30.520> you<00:02:30.850> sit<00:02:31.090> there<00:02:31.270> and<00:02:31.390> you<00:02:31.480> play<00:02:31.720> those

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
and I you sit there and you play those

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:33.750 
and I you sit there and you play those
and<00:02:32.350> you<00:02:32.410> don't<00:02:32.590> you<00:02:32.740> don't<00:02:32.830> apply<00:02:33.220> them<00:02:33.520> to

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
and you don't you don't apply them to

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.610 
and you don't you don't apply them to
some<00:02:34.120> sort<00:02:34.150> of<00:02:34.390> music<00:02:34.810> there's<00:02:35.080> no<00:02:35.230> use<00:02:35.410> for
