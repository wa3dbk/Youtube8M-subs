00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.100
 thank you very much very good morning 

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:05.720
 pleasure to accompany the week 

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.850
 we go with information of the forecast of 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:09.320
 time today the temperature stays in the 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:11.810
 center of monterrey marking at the moment 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:14.540
 23 degrees centigrade we have at the moment 

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:15.800
 the light northwest wind reaches 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:18.169
 gusts up to 20 kilometers per hour 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:20.449
 moisture at 78 percent moment and 

00:00:18.169 --> 00:00:22.669
 pressure of 1,015 millibars today we hope 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:25.279
 that the temperature continues to rise and 

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:26.779
 I can dial in the afternoon to 28 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:29.179
 degrees the presence of average sky 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:30.859
 cloudy will be dominating just as 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:32.960
 Yesterday he has already mastered a little 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:34.789
 to little atmospheric stability with 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.620
 a slight forecast of rains yet 

00:00:34.789 --> 00:00:39.109
 for today very minimal only 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.480
 we talk about 30 to 40 percent of 

00:00:39.109 --> 00:00:43.609
 probability of rain this morning and 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.440
 continues in the afternoon very light too 

00:00:43.609 --> 00:00:47.629
 the forecast tomorrow again too 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.609
 if it intensifies this probability of 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:51.170
 rain and we ended the week also 

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:53.149
 with probabilities of precipitation 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.309
 for Friday and Saturday and the maximum 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:58.820
 temperatures are going to score between 25 to 26 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:01:00.620
 minimum degrees between 18 to 20 a 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.870
 starting next Sunday is when 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.489
 we hope that they will completely withdraw 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.180
 rainfall and maximize have the 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.730
 maximum temperatures between 29 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.220
 30 degrees and the presence of the average sky 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:13.350
 cloudy and already without precipitation and we see 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.640
 currently the satellite map of the 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.410
 Mexican Republic and we see all the 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.360
 systems that are currently dominating 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:20.610
 about the Mexican Republic we have 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.229
 wide low pressure channels here what 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.870
 we can appreciate one on the mountain 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.880
 western mother other the moment about 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:28.290
 the northeast of the gulf of mexico which is the 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.850
 which is interacting causing the 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.550
 instability in addition to tropical water 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.530
 number 31 to the season on the 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.840
 Yucatan Peninsula also causing ya 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.310
 rains and storms and we must unite these 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.380
 are the unstable ones that the 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.960
 moment and this channel also low 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.790
 pressure that presents 80 percent of 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.860
 potential for cyclonic development in 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:50.130
 the next hours keep this moment 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.020
 an approximate distance to 335 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.119
 kilometers southwest of acapulco 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.040
 warrior and its moisture flow can already 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.600
 be generating rainfall in 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.920
 Some points of the country of the country 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.080
