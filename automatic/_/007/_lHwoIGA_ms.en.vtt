00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.149 

when<00:00:00.570> I<00:00:00.599> knew<00:00:00.930> I<00:00:00.960> meant<00:00:01.290> the<00:00:01.500> right<00:00:01.770> woman<00:00:01.949> for

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:02.159 
when I knew I meant the right woman for

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:04.670 
when I knew I meant the right woman for
me<00:00:02.490> I<00:00:02.760> decided<00:00:03.270> I<00:00:03.510> really<00:00:03.780> wanted<00:00:04.020> to<00:00:04.140> do<00:00:04.410> a

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680 
me I decided I really wanted to do a

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.810 
me I decided I really wanted to do a
proposal<00:00:05.430> that<00:00:05.640> was<00:00:05.910> really<00:00:06.210> special<00:00:06.779> so<00:00:07.820> what

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
proposal that was really special so what

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.089 
proposal that was really special so what
I<00:00:08.849> did<00:00:09.120> is<00:00:09.330> I<00:00:09.360> actually<00:00:09.630> created<00:00:10.469> an<00:00:10.710> entire

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
I did is I actually created an entire

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.589 
I did is I actually created an entire
video<00:00:11.370> game<00:00:11.900> using<00:00:12.900> some<00:00:13.889> themes<00:00:14.700> and<00:00:15.179> and

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
video game using some themes and and

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.529 
video game using some themes and and
imagery<00:00:16.560> from<00:00:16.830> from<00:00:17.369> marriage<00:00:17.789> that<00:00:18.150> were

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
imagery from from marriage that were

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.900 
imagery from from marriage that were
important<00:00:18.990> to<00:00:19.050> me<00:00:19.289> and<00:00:19.560> I<00:00:19.740> thought<00:00:19.949> would<00:00:20.789> be

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
important to me and I thought would be

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.740 
important to me and I thought would be
special<00:00:21.359> for<00:00:21.390> us<00:00:21.600> and<00:00:22.170> then<00:00:23.160> I<00:00:23.430> actually<00:00:23.760> sort

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
special for us and then I actually sort

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.769 
special for us and then I actually sort
of<00:00:24.900> embedded<00:00:25.859> the<00:00:26.160> proposal<00:00:26.730> inside<00:00:27.330> the<00:00:27.570> game

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
of embedded the proposal inside the game

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.669 
of embedded the proposal inside the game
so<00:00:28.740> a<00:00:29.070> little<00:00:29.550> background<00:00:30.019> for<00:00:31.019> for<00:00:31.349> the<00:00:31.439> video

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
so a little background for for the video

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.889 
so a little background for for the video
you're<00:00:31.890> about<00:00:31.920> to<00:00:32.099> see<00:00:32.250> which<00:00:32.730> I<00:00:33.059> actually<00:00:33.329> had

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
you're about to see which I actually had

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.639 
you're about to see which I actually had
a<00:00:33.930> hidden<00:00:34.890> camera<00:00:35.570> filming<00:00:36.570> her<00:00:36.870> reaction<00:00:37.410> and

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
a hidden camera filming her reaction and

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.470 
a hidden camera filming her reaction and
the<00:00:38.129> whole<00:00:38.309> thing<00:00:38.930> but<00:00:39.930> what<00:00:40.829> I<00:00:40.860> did<00:00:41.100> is<00:00:41.489> I<00:00:41.730> took

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
the whole thing but what I did is I took

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.869 
the whole thing but what I did is I took
the<00:00:42.660> engagement<00:00:43.230> ring<00:00:43.730> hollowed<00:00:44.730> out<00:00:44.820> a

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
the engagement ring hollowed out a

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.799 
the engagement ring hollowed out a
battery<00:00:45.300> pack<00:00:45.570> for<00:00:46.110> an<00:00:46.410> Xbox<00:00:46.829> 360<00:00:47.070> controller

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:47.809 
battery pack for an Xbox 360 controller

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:50.180 
battery pack for an Xbox 360 controller
put<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:48.899> engagement<00:00:49.440> ring<00:00:49.559> in<00:00:49.739> there<00:00:49.950> and

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
put the engagement ring in there and

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:56.209 
put the engagement ring in there and
then<00:00:52.489> the<00:00:54.379> controller<00:00:55.379> was<00:00:55.590> actually<00:00:55.980> running

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
then the controller was actually running

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.689 
then the controller was actually running
off<00:00:56.579> of<00:00:56.610> USB<00:00:57.300> power<00:00:57.620> but<00:00:58.620> it<00:00:59.070> had<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.489> fake

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
off of USB power but it had the fake

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.869 
off of USB power but it had the fake
battery<00:01:00.059> pack<00:01:00.329> in<00:01:00.570> there<00:01:00.750> and<00:01:01.070> so<00:01:02.070> we<00:01:02.820> were

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
battery pack in there and so we were

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.660 
battery pack in there and so we were
playing<00:01:03.210> this<00:01:03.449> game<00:01:03.510> together<00:01:04.280> that<00:01:05.280> I<00:01:05.309> made

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
playing this game together that I made

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.840 
playing this game together that I made
and<00:01:06.320> the<00:01:07.320> whole<00:01:07.530> point<00:01:08.070> at<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.369> end<00:01:08.490> was

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
and the whole point at the end was

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.210 
and the whole point at the end was
supposed<00:01:09.630> to<00:01:09.720> get<00:01:09.930> her<00:01:10.170> to<00:01:10.470> open<00:01:10.799> up<00:01:11.040> the

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
supposed to get her to open up the

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.670 
supposed to get her to open up the
battery<00:01:11.490> pack<00:01:11.840> so<00:01:12.840> she<00:01:12.900> would<00:01:13.140> find<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.500> ring

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
battery pack so she would find the ring

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.070 
battery pack so she would find the ring
and<00:01:13.920> I<00:01:14.040> would<00:01:14.189> propose<00:01:14.549> so<00:01:15.420> without<00:01:15.840> further

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
and I would propose so without further

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:22.110 
and I would propose so without further
ado<00:01:16.470> here's<00:01:17.189> what<00:01:17.430> happened

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:22.120 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:02:11.570 

yeah

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:29.040 

so<00:02:12.580> it's<00:02:12.760> like

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:35.890 

so<00:02:30.050> in<00:02:30.170> cinnamon<00:02:30.830> one

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:45.360 

it<00:02:36.650> is<00:02:36.890> the<00:02:37.040> one

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:03:09.620 

so<00:02:45.940> looks<00:02:46.209> like<00:02:46.330> you<00:02:46.569> need<00:02:46.720> to<00:02:46.750> loosen

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:30.970 

I<00:03:12.980> think<00:03:13.980> Stan

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:42.270 

and<00:03:31.980> I<00:03:32.549> think<00:03:32.750> EVP<00:03:33.750> right<00:03:33.810> now

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:04:17.960 

looking<00:03:42.760> for<00:03:42.940> more

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:22.190 

I<00:04:18.000> wish<00:04:18.660> I<00:04:18.810> run<00:04:19.050> yeah<00:04:20.390> no<00:04:21.390> no<00:04:21.720> wait<00:04:21.930> I<00:04:21.959> was

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 
I wish I run yeah no no wait I was

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:27.290 
I wish I run yeah no no wait I was
almost<00:04:22.410> at<00:04:22.740> you

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.439

00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:30.449 
to you the battery is supposed to be

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:32.780 
to you the battery is supposed to be
running
