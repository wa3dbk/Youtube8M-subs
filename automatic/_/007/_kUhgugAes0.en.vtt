00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
it you don't have to use notepad in

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.380

particular<00:03:01.360> you<00:03:01.480> can<00:03:01.510> actually<00:03:01.870> use<00:03:03.060> our<00:03:04.060> real

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
particular you can actually use our real

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:09.150 
particular you can actually use our real
a<00:03:04.930> real<00:03:05.260> nomad<00:03:06.299> if<00:03:07.299> you<00:03:07.690> wanted<00:03:07.989> to<00:03:08.140> I<00:03:08.350> do<00:03:08.890> that

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
but the point is if you get your

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.620 
but the point is if you get your
