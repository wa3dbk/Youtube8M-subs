flop which is what i was getting a

00:01:08.749 --> 00:01:12.160 
flop which is what i was getting a
signal<00:01:09.109> for<00:01:09.350> is<00:01:09.859> a<00:01:09.920> week<00:01:10.280> and<00:01:10.579> i'm<00:01:11.539> assuming<00:01:11.689> so

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270 
plug yet

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:19.359 
plug yet

00:01:22.209 --> 00:01:22.219 
I'm able to with that etrack

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:27.240 
I'm able to with that etrack
discriminate<00:01:23.060> between<00:01:23.920> iron<00:01:24.920> targets<00:01:25.579> and

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.250 
discriminate between iron targets and

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.630 
discriminate between iron targets and
basically<00:01:28.250> sweet<00:01:28.640> targets<00:01:29.030> right<00:01:29.210> next<00:01:29.509> to<00:01:29.630> it

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.640 
basically sweet targets right next to it

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:36.249 
basically sweet targets right next to it
let's<00:01:31.640> take<00:01:31.850> a<00:01:31.909> look<00:01:32.210> here<00:01:35.049> actually<00:01:36.049> it's<00:01:36.170> a

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:36.259 
let's take a look here actually it's a

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:40.209 
let's take a look here actually it's a
memorial<00:01:36.409> but<00:01:36.920> doesn't<00:01:37.909> really<00:01:38.060> matter<00:01:39.219> just

00:01:40.209 --> 00:01:40.219
