00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
to be different and there are a lot of

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.729 
to be different and there are a lot of
ways<00:00:59.280> to<00:00:59.460> be<00:00:59.550> different<00:00:59.940> I<00:01:00.120> think<00:01:01.020> one<00:01:01.559> of<00:01:01.590> the

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
ways to be different I think one of the

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.619 
ways to be different I think one of the
biggest<00:01:01.949> mistakes<00:01:02.460> that<00:01:02.609> people<00:01:02.730> make<00:01:03.000> it<00:01:03.390> are

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
biggest mistakes that people make it are

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.950 
biggest mistakes that people make it are
sort<00:01:04.170> of<00:01:04.229> grandiose<00:01:04.769> expectations<00:01:05.700> that<00:01:06.390> if

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
sort of grandiose expectations that if

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.890 
sort of grandiose expectations that if
you<00:01:07.140> put<00:01:07.500> it<00:01:07.619> out<00:01:07.710> there<00:01:08.040> they'll<00:01:08.700> come<00:01:08.970> I

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
you put it out there they'll come I

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.840 
you put it out there they'll come I
think<00:01:10.439> it<00:01:10.680> takes<00:01:10.710> a<00:01:11.040> lot<00:01:11.189> of<00:01:11.220> effort<00:01:11.610> to<00:01:11.729> get

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
think it takes a lot of effort to get

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.830 
think it takes a lot of effort to get
noticed<00:01:13.189> but<00:01:14.240> but<00:01:15.240> if<00:01:15.509> you<00:01:15.720> have<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.200> right

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
noticed but but if you have the right

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.649 
noticed but but if you have the right
marketing<00:01:18.840> effort<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.680> right<00:01:20.659> creativity

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
marketing effort the right creativity

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.469 
marketing effort the right creativity
and<00:01:21.990> you<00:01:22.680> target<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.189> right<00:01:23.310> segments<00:01:24.060> I

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
and you target the right segments I

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.160 
and you target the right segments I
think<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:26.070> little<00:01:26.250> guy<00:01:26.520> can<00:01:26.880> really<00:01:27.240> grow

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
think the little guy can really grow

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.890 
think the little guy can really grow
very<00:01:28.439> quickly<00:01:28.500> I<00:01:29.009> think<00:01:29.369> one<00:01:29.790> key<00:01:30.030> is<00:01:30.270> search

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
very quickly I think one key is search

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.700 
very quickly I think one key is search

your<00:01:57.780> way<00:01:57.899> there's<00:01:58.320> a<00:01:58.380> real<00:01:58.710> new<00:01:59.930> movement

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
your way there's a real new movement

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.440 
your way there's a real new movement
going<00:02:01.110> on<00:02:01.380> where<00:02:01.950> there's<00:02:02.729> a<00:02:02.820> creation<00:02:03.390> of

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
going on where there's a creation of

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.730 
going on where there's a creation of
micro<00:02:04.170> segments<00:02:04.820> we're<00:02:05.820> seeing<00:02:06.170> with<00:02:07.170> so<00:02:07.619> many

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
micro segments we're seeing with so many

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.499 
micro segments we're seeing with so many
people<00:02:08.160> out<00:02:08.280> there<00:02:08.580> that<00:02:08.759> one<00:02:08.970> size<00:02:09.209> doesn't

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
people out there that one size doesn't

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.290 
people out there that one size doesn't
fit<00:02:09.660> all<00:02:09.840> and<00:02:10.289> so<00:02:11.160> it's<00:02:11.640> creating<00:02:11.970> new

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300
