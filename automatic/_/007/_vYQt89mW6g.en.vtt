and it's the reefer tyranny you know the

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:11.440 
and it's the reefer tyranny you know the
reef<00:02:09.979> or<00:02:10.129> tyranny<00:02:10.369> might<00:02:10.759> flow<00:02:11.000> a<00:02:11.030> little<00:02:11.239> bit

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
reef or tyranny might flow a little bit

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.600 
reef or tyranny might flow a little bit
more<00:02:11.629> air<00:02:11.870> at<00:02:12.290> the<00:02:12.500> end<00:02:12.620> of<00:02:12.740> the<00:02:12.800> day<00:02:12.980> with<00:02:13.430> its

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
more air at the end of the day with its

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.220 
more air at the end of the day with its
design<00:02:13.940> but<00:02:14.120> I<00:02:14.150> think<00:02:14.420> by<00:02:14.540> stepping<00:02:14.569> up<00:02:15.110> to

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
design but I think by stepping up to

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.140 
design but I think by stepping up to
something<00:02:15.560> like<00:02:15.709> the<00:02:15.920> subdermal

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
something like the subdermal

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:18.819 
something like the subdermal
or<00:02:17.209> the<00:02:17.329> sub<00:02:17.750> operator<00:02:18.170> you<00:02:18.290> just<00:02:18.470> get<00:02:18.560> a<00:02:18.590> lot

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:18.829 
or the sub operator you just get a lot

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:21.160 
or the sub operator you just get a lot
more<00:02:18.860> glove<00:02:19.340> for<00:02:19.909> your<00:02:20.000> money<00:02:20.180> so<00:02:20.750> this<00:02:21.049> is<00:02:21.079> a

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
more glove for your money so this is a

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.710 
more glove for your money so this is a
pretty<00:02:21.349> reasonable<00:02:21.650> shore<00:02:22.549> club<00:02:22.760> from<00:02:23.299> icon

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
pretty reasonable shore club from icon

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:24.940 
pretty reasonable shore club from icon
and<00:02:23.930> I<00:02:24.079> think<00:02:24.349> it's<00:02:24.439> an<00:02:24.530> improvement<00:02:24.709> over

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
and I think it's an improvement over

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.550 
and I think it's an improvement over
