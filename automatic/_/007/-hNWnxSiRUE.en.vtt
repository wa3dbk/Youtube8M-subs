a<00:01:53.520> bigger<00:01:53.729> squad<00:01:54.030> don't<00:01:54.210> hear<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.869> hope<00:01:55.530> so

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
a bigger squad don't hear the hope so

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.670 
a bigger squad don't hear the hope so
cuz<00:01:56.040> they're<00:01:56.250> a<00:01:56.280> bit<00:01:57.110> bit<00:01:58.110> light<00:01:58.320> in<00:01:58.500> some

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
cuz they're a bit bit light in some

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.649 
cuz they're a bit bit light in some
areas<00:01:58.950> of<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.130> pitch<00:01:59.310> not<00:01:59.940> seen<00:02:00.119> defense<00:02:00.509> it's

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
areas of the pitch not seen defense it's

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:01.700 
areas of the pitch not seen defense it's
a<00:02:00.720> problem<00:02:00.990> at<00:02:01.080> the<00:02:01.170> moment<00:02:01.200> because<00:02:01.560> they

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
a problem at the moment because they

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.249 
a problem at the moment because they
don't<00:02:01.860> have<00:02:01.950> back<00:02:02.580> up<00:02:02.610> there<00:02:03.000> may<00:02:03.960> be<00:02:03.990> another

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
don't have back up there may be another

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.130 
don't have back up there may be another
striker<00:02:05.420> with<00:02:06.420> the<00:02:06.600> other<00:02:06.750> players<00:02:06.960> going

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
striker with the other players going

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.109 
striker with the other players going
with<00:02:07.350> Africa<00:02:07.800> in<00:02:07.890> January<00:02:08.310> so<00:02:08.489> hopefully

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
with Africa in January so hopefully

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.999 
with Africa in January so hopefully
because<00:02:09.989> I<00:02:10.050> think<00:02:10.229> might<00:02:10.410> just<00:02:10.619> need<00:02:10.709> it<00:02:10.769> and

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
because I think might just need it and

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.530 
because I think might just need it and
to<00:02:11.220> meet<00:02:11.700> in<00:02:11.850> opposition<00:02:12.239> in<00:02:12.300> the<00:02:12.390> league

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
to meet in opposition in the league

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.630 
to meet in opposition in the league
hopefully<00:02:13.050> I<00:02:13.290> think<00:02:14.130> they<00:02:14.190> should<00:02:14.370> bring<00:02:14.489> in

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
hopefully I think they should bring in

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.060 
hopefully I think they should bring in
the<00:02:14.700> least<00:02:14.820> centre-back<00:02:15.660> and<00:02:15.900> because<00:02:16.890> one

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 
the least centre-back and because one

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.009 
the least centre-back and because one
got<00:02:17.310> covered<00:02:17.610> to<00:02:17.760> net<00:02:17.940> Stephen<00:02:18.420> Eli's<00:02:18.690> injured

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.019 
got covered to net Stephen Eli's injured

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:21.259 
got covered to net Stephen Eli's injured
now<00:02:19.170> so<00:02:19.860> I<00:02:19.890> think<00:02:20.010> we<00:02:20.280> should<00:02:20.459> def<00:02:20.850> peeping<00:02:21.150> in

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:21.269 
now so I think we should def peeping in

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:23.540 
now so I think we should def peeping in
the<00:02:21.390> sent<00:02:21.569> back<00:02:21.750> for<00:02:21.870> color<00:02:22.110> and<00:02:22.380> asking<00:02:23.370> who

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
the sent back for color and asking who

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.280 
the sent back for color and asking who
need<00:02:23.760> another<00:02:24.060> Strega<00:02:24.480> because<00:02:24.810> they're<00:02:25.080> the

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
need another Strega because they're the

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.170 
need another Strega because they're the
last<00:02:25.470> room<00:02:25.739> he<00:02:25.980> matured<00:02:26.400> that<00:02:26.430> haven't<00:02:27.060> got

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
last room he matured that haven't got

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.720 
last room he matured that haven't got
any<00:02:27.390> death<00:02:27.660> or<00:02:27.840> foot<00:02:28.110> wide<00:02:28.830> the<00:02:29.010> chances<00:02:29.519> but

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
any death or foot wide the chances but

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.250 
any death or foot wide the chances but
we<00:02:30.150> needed<00:02:30.420> at<00:02:30.569> least<00:02:30.690> two<00:02:30.840> no<00:02:30.959> one<00:02:31.140> who

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
we needed at least two no one who

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:32.630 
we needed at least two no one who
couldn't<00:02:31.500> spoil<00:02:31.860> the<00:02:32.010> game<00:02:32.160> up<00:02:32.370> a<00:02:32.400> bit

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
couldn't spoil the game up a bit

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.610 
couldn't spoil the game up a bit
stopping<00:02:33.300> Stephanie<00:02:33.780> strike<00:02:34.019> on<00:02:34.170> you<00:02:34.260> as<00:02:34.410> well

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
yeah it's top priority is going to be

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.050

missing<00:02:37.590> during<00:02:37.950> January<00:02:38.519> you<00:02:38.670> could<00:02:38.820> after<00:02:38.940> a

fearsome and I can't see anybody in the
squad<00:02:41.730> who<00:02:41.880> can<00:02:42.090> appear<00:02:42.390> smart<00:02:42.660> America<00:02:42.989> it's

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
squad who can appear smart America it's

squad who can appear smart America it's
on<00:02:43.230> Form<00:02:43.530> so<00:02:44.160> that's<00:02:45.090> priority<00:02:45.690> i<00:02:45.720> guess<00:02:45.930> yeah

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
on Form so that's priority i guess yeah

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.600 
on Form so that's priority i guess yeah
purity<00:02:47.130> course<00:02:47.430> then<00:02:48.620> fair<00:02:49.620> enough<00:02:49.650> if<00:02:50.250> the

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
purity course then fair enough if the

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:51.800 
purity course then fair enough if the
price<00:02:50.820> is<00:02:50.850> right<00:02:51.030> we're<00:02:51.360> gonna<00:02:51.480> have<00:02:51.600> to<00:02:51.690> let

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
price is right we're gonna have to let

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.990 
price is right we're gonna have to let
them<00:02:51.900> go<00:02:52.130> also<00:02:53.130> we<00:02:53.220> can<00:02:53.459> deal<00:02:53.670> with<00:02:53.820> the<00:02:53.880> big

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
them go also we can deal with the big

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.670 
them go also we can deal with the big
clubs<00:02:54.299> now<00:02:54.480> of<00:02:54.690> the<00:02:54.810> way<00:02:54.930> edges<00:02:55.230> and<00:02:55.380> the<00:02:55.470> money

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
clubs now of the way edges and the money

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.160 
clubs now of the way edges and the money
so<00:02:56.310> if<00:02:56.489> the<00:02:56.880> price<00:02:57.150> is<00:02:57.180> right<00:02:57.360> I<00:02:57.750> would<00:02:58.019> be

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
so if the price is right I would be

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:59.210 
so if the price is right I would be
happier<00:02:58.260> let<00:02:58.709> them<00:02:58.799> go<00:02:58.950> and<00:02:59.100> get<00:02:59.160> a

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
happier let them go and get a

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.520 
happier let them go and get a
replacement<00:02:59.940> yeah<00:03:00.810> i<00:03:00.870> think<00:03:01.019> the<00:03:01.290> real<00:03:01.470> i

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
replacement yeah i think the real i

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.830 
replacement yeah i think the real i
think<00:03:01.680> they<00:03:02.040> need<00:03:02.250> a<00:03:02.280> good<00:03:02.700> striker<00:03:03.329> really

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
think they need a good striker really

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.130 
think they need a good striker really
perhaps<00:03:04.620> a<00:03:04.769> good<00:03:04.950> central<00:03:05.340> defender

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
perhaps a good central defender

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.880 
perhaps a good central defender
further<00:03:07.770> than<00:03:07.950> that<00:03:08.130> a<00:03:08.160> few<00:03:08.520> inches<00:03:09.890> coming

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
further than that a few inches coming

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.340 
further than that a few inches coming
back<00:03:11.040> in<00:03:11.160> the<00:03:11.280> team<00:03:11.510> from<00:03:12.510> Hindi<00:03:12.900> should<00:03:13.050> I<00:03:13.140> say

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
back in the team from Hindi should I say

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:16.580 
back in the team from Hindi should I say
could<00:03:13.920> help<00:03:14.480> at<00:03:15.480> least<00:03:15.690> two<00:03:15.990> players<00:03:16.290> I<00:03:16.560> think

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
could help at least two players I think

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:19.250 
could help at least two players I think
needed<00:03:17.190> to<00:03:18.000> improve<00:03:18.270> the<00:03:18.450> team<00:03:18.660> especially

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
needed to improve the team especially

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
even Andy Carroll back but in defense I

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.570
