00:00:12.439 --> 00:00:15.439
 at a rally 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:21.619
 Today we are in the coastal town I want to call you in Girona 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:23.429
 talk with your good things 

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:28.069
 susana molina this writer by vocation the former businessman will come to 

00:00:28.069 --> 00:00:30.330
 his profession but neither is it concerned 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.789
 the young the weekend for paintings a passion 

00:00:33.789 --> 00:00:38.819
 it's something that they asked for body and soul and what they could not resist 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.240
 medellin 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:46.479
 in a rally we are with his son in recent years exciting work 

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:50.490
 has been able to see the light in different exhibitions walking to the viewer 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:54.739
 for his strength his potential and his commitment now his eyes win 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:59.830
 you say that your work is an intuitive painting can not be explained better yes 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:04.120
 so I repeat myself on a board on canvas or those who feel 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:04.950
 the moment 

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:07.280
 I even get carried away many times 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.450
 by its own distinct and that is what gives the impression is completely 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.070
 the record is exhausted 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.520
 you miss having an academic education or that is precisely what 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.320
 gives you freedom when it comes to creating is accommodated high because it has not done something 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.170
 in lack that I do not know 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.049
 and that previously was also a one to one to a freedom to create what 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:30.520
 I feel without any influence of children producing a total freedom 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.399
 many times with the fingers with the hands that you feel when you have 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:36.950
 direct contact with the waist 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:38.080
 is a 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:43.090
 a cesida d must feel that you care about princesses a way 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.010
 to get inside the painting 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:48.170
 so I was following the capitulars that makes me want 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.310
 we see that in your workshop apart from having the traditional oil paintings you also have 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.440
 decoration and industrial paintings to what is due 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:59.870
 PS is because I like to experiment with quotation marks 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:01.550
 as a kind of alchemist 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:05.000
 Well, as I am lucky to know the reactions between different materials 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.510
 he used them apart from my unique moment everything painting and is involved with the 

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:12.449
 nature and talion involved from the point even of 

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:17.089
 recycle paintings of different computers that will not go to the garbage or android 

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:18.819
 banega pollution 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:20.779
 how to select the colors 

00:02:20.779 --> 00:02:24.339
 of the colors to the enemy to which the first question that there is that sense 

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:27.739
 intuition totally depending on the state of mind depending on what 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:30.239
 have seen the moment the street depending on the idea that in that 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:31.829
 stop 

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:33.679
 Then what does it tell you? 

00:02:33.679 --> 00:02:36.789
 the painter can have a favorite color you have 

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:38.610
 the numbers not necessarily 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.430
 the colors is a reflection the mood depends on how you are 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.719
 you use more without realizing unconsciously club 

00:02:45.719 --> 00:02:49.279
 Many of his paintings currently revolving embossed 

00:02:49.279 --> 00:02:53.419
 reaching almost to the terrain of cultures although perhaps some material readings 

00:02:53.419 --> 00:02:56.829
 or technique to achieve it sometimes they use is very serious 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:03:00.369
 say the least you must subscribe for special effects like I'm here 

00:03:00.369 --> 00:03:02.719
 used for example from 

00:03:02.719 --> 00:03:06.769
 from the base of titan venetian stucco because it gives me an important point 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:10.179
 then it cracks and that gives a realism what I want 

00:03:10.179 --> 00:03:11.819
 comments until recently 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:13.489
 the more seriously the painting 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:17.100
 have you ever thought about leaving it for lack of time the general 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.110
 there they declare happy 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:20.689
 plus 

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:23.499
 percent let's see leave it neither 

00:03:23.499 --> 00:03:27.309
 never thought about leaving it if it loosens times because of circumstances of 

00:03:27.309 --> 00:03:28.109
 work 

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:31.250
 and as to what the request because 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.680
 jaime delicate now brake I want to be out on the street is thanks to me 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.459
 family that are the main 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:39.979
 in women and main functions 

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:43.809
 supported today on the issues manÃ¡ and joaquim have pushed insisted pact 

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:48.599
 the children are critical that this comment does not pay them tora 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:53.339
 smith we are in doubt they are totally critical in everything I do 

00:03:53.339 --> 00:03:57.749
 unquestionably the criticism and it is for me it is very important I have my 

00:03:57.749 --> 00:04:00.979
 hands the catalog of his latest collection pateras 

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:04.839
 after talking a little about it this catalog refers to a series of 

00:04:04.839 --> 00:04:05.719
 picture 

00:04:05.719 --> 00:04:09.059
 what are they referring to so studios that migrants spend 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:13.910
 when they come to Spain then these sres all the pictures have a 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:15.529
 small a little poem 

00:04:15.529 --> 00:04:17.280
 that together with the picture 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.639
 they make the tension of the public debut go towards the story that I 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:22.400
 I want to tell 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.440
 currently working on his new collection he could reveal us some 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:27.289
 little thing 

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:30.289
 yes in it if you allow me to teach you precisely 

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:35.150
 the one that the flagship picture of the deva of the new series of documentation 

00:04:38.499 --> 00:04:39.919
 this collection 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:42.499
 it's called against nature 

00:04:42.499 --> 00:04:45.579
 of its cause of the chaos that we are 

00:04:46.189 --> 00:04:49.969
 gerardo humans are taking nature in this box 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.240
 it can be seen 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.169
 who could save precisely 

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:59.199
 the tree that represents nature the rebirth of nature against 

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:02.539
 what we are doing against all this destruction 

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:05.850
 has the metal sheets mean precisely the oppression 

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:08.590
 of the contamination of the exploitation 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:12.960
 the counterpoint nature the blue sky in the background always together with the color 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:14.330
 green is a hope 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:15.199
 but 

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:18.900
 if you figures of the drought and a sheet and in the middle a tree other than 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:22.409
 means that although nature makes athletic fight against us by 

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:23.370
 rectify 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:26.490
 we are always in danger because of losing them to have human 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:28.589
 soda that you have left for dignity 

00:05:28.589 --> 00:05:29.449
 everyone 

00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:31.120
 he has to paint everything 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:35.380
 Seattle I think that in the world the paint even the biggest 

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:40.560
 they ended their life but it did not end they never managed to finish 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:44.900
 paint because the painting I do not know that sometimes as a universe its show many 

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:48.470
 thank you for letting us in the company thank you very much for 

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:50.460
