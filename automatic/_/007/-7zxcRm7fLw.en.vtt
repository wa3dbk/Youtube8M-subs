can do know not everybody's ridden a

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.040 
can do know not everybody's ridden a
sport<00:00:41.790> bike<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.270> way<00:00:42.420> they<00:00:42.600> can<00:00:42.750> be<00:00:42.870> written

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
sport bike the way they can be written

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.200 
sport bike the way they can be written
like<00:00:43.290> I<00:00:43.469> can't<00:00:43.770> twist<00:00:44.010> throttle<00:00:44.399> what<00:00:45.090> it

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
like I can't twist throttle what it

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.639 
like I can't twist throttle what it
needs<00:00:45.390> to<00:00:45.510> be<00:00:45.660> but<00:00:45.870> I<00:00:45.989> can<00:00:46.170> sure<00:00:46.320> push<00:00:46.500> the

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
needs to be but I can sure push the

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.190 
needs to be but I can sure push the
pedal<00:00:46.950> on<00:00:47.039> this<00:00:47.190> thing<00:00:47.430> so<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:48.690> idea<00:00:48.809> is<00:00:49.079> to

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
pedal on this thing so the idea is to

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.750 
pedal on this thing so the idea is to
put<00:00:49.440> a<00:00:49.469> passenger<00:00:49.710> in<00:00:50.010> here<00:00:50.370> and<00:00:50.550> give<00:00:50.670> them

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
put a passenger in here and give them

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.140 
put a passenger in here and give them
the<00:00:50.820> experience

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:52.150 
the experience

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:54.930 
the experience
which<00:00:52.660> is<00:00:52.840> truly<00:00:53.530> amazing<00:00:53.740> so<00:00:54.550> tell<00:00:54.760> me<00:00:54.790> about

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:54.940

the<00:00:55.120> ride<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:56.590> ride<00:00:56.620> in<00:00:56.980> this<00:00:57.100> is<00:00:57.370> really

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:57.880 
the ride the ride in this is really

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.960 
the ride the ride in this is really
surprisingly<00:00:58.570> fast<00:00:58.900> it's<00:00:59.490> it<00:01:00.490> handles<00:01:00.880> really

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:00.970 
surprisingly fast it's it handles really

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:03.540 
surprisingly fast it's it handles really
well<00:01:01.210> I<00:01:01.600> mean<00:01:01.960> it's<00:01:02.440> a<00:01:02.530> vehicle<00:01:02.980> that<00:01:03.100> you<00:01:03.310> can

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:03.550 
well I mean it's a vehicle that you can

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:04.950 
well I mean it's a vehicle that you can
it's<00:01:03.760> like<00:01:03.910> a<00:01:03.940> drippy<00:01:04.390> at<00:01:04.480> least<00:01:04.720> in<00:01:04.870> the

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:04.960 
it's like a drippy at least in the

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:06.040 
it's like a drippy at least in the
drifting

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:06.050 
drifting

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:08.290 
drifting
you<00:01:06.950> can<00:01:07.130> spin<00:01:07.370> the<00:01:07.490> rear<00:01:07.670> wheel<00:01:07.940> up<00:01:08.090> really

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:08.300 
you can spin the rear wheel up really

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.320 
you can spin the rear wheel up really
easy<00:01:08.570> you<00:01:08.750> can<00:01:09.050> slide<00:01:09.350> it<00:01:09.640> the<00:01:10.640> gearbox<00:01:10.880> is

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.330 
easy you can slide it the gearbox is

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.820 
easy you can slide it the gearbox is
sequential<00:01:11.990> six<00:01:12.890> feet<00:01:13.130> so<00:01:13.400> it's

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:14.830 
sequential six feet so it's

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.880 
sequential six feet so it's
 clutch<00:01:16.820> you<00:01:17.630> have<00:01:17.750> 12<00:01:17.990> hour

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
 clutch you have 12 hour

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.640 
 clutch you have 12 hour
brake<00:01:19.130> pedal<00:01:19.490> ready<00:01:19.810> it's<00:01:20.810> really<00:01:21.110> simple<00:01:21.380> all

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:21.650 
brake pedal ready it's really simple all

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:23.800 
brake pedal ready it's really simple all
the<00:01:21.770> controls<00:01:22.190> or<00:01:22.580> off<00:01:23.180> of<00:01:23.450> the<00:01:23.510> motorcycle

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
the controls or off of the motorcycle

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.580 
the controls or off of the motorcycle
it's<00:01:24.409> all<00:01:24.729> fully<00:01:25.729> street<00:01:26.150> legal<00:01:26.540> but<00:01:26.810> uh<00:01:26.840> it's

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:31.400 
people have helped me build in the

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.980 
people have helped me build in the
industry<00:01:31.850> that<00:01:31.880> I<00:01:32.000> came<00:01:32.060> in<00:01:32.479> you<00:01:32.659> know<00:01:32.780> they

industry that I came in you know they
helped<00:01:33.200> me<00:01:33.320> develop<00:01:33.560> this<00:01:33.860> pitching<00:01:34.580> velocity

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:35.509 
helped me develop this pitching velocity

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:37.570 
helped me develop this pitching velocity
stack<00:01:36.200> for<00:01:36.470> which<00:01:36.710> is<00:01:36.830> really<00:01:37.009> important<00:01:37.430> all

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:37.580 
stack for which is really important all

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:38.950 
stack for which is really important all
the<00:01:37.700> engines<00:01:38.060> these<00:01:38.300> days<00:01:38.570> with<00:01:38.869> the

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 
the engines these days with the

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.870 
the engines these days with the
computers<00:01:39.470> and<00:01:39.680> technology<00:01:40.369> it's<00:01:40.580> very

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
computers and technology it's very

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.749 
computers and technology it's very
important<00:01:41.390> on<00:01:41.479> the<00:01:42.259> mass<00:01:42.500> air<00:01:42.800> sensor<00:01:42.830> xand

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:43.759 
important on the mass air sensor xand

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:45.490 
important on the mass air sensor xand
the<00:01:43.820> temperature<00:01:44.300> sensors<00:01:44.810> of<00:01:44.990> the<00:01:45.110> air<00:01:45.229> and

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
the temperature sensors of the air and

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.200 
the temperature sensors of the air and
all<00:01:45.560> the<00:01:45.680> things<00:01:45.890> like<00:01:46.070> that<00:01:46.250> so<00:01:46.550> with<00:01:46.820> kam

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 
all the things like that so with kam

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.330 
all the things like that so with kam
developing<00:01:47.690> that<00:01:47.840> for<00:01:48.110> me<00:01:48.229> it<00:01:48.890> takes<00:01:49.159> those

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
developing that for me it takes those

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.219 
developing that for me it takes those
headaches<00:01:49.610> away<00:01:50.000> and<00:01:50.240> this<00:01:50.630> thing<00:01:50.840> runs<00:01:51.110> like

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:51.229 
headaches away and this thing runs like

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:54.040 
headaches away and this thing runs like
a<00:01:51.380> bat<00:01:51.619> out<00:01:51.979> and<00:01:52.310> you've<00:01:53.060> got<00:01:53.210> other<00:01:53.479> cars<00:01:53.810> here

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:54.050 
a bat out and you've got other cars here
