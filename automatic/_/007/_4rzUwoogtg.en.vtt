00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
this into three pieces and start

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.180 
this into three pieces and start
creating<00:01:46.920> a<00:01:47.070> Dutch<00:01:47.250> braid<00:01:48.620> rotate<00:01:49.620> the<00:01:49.800> lowest

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:50.190 
creating a Dutch braid rotate the lowest

section<00:01:50.580> under<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.300> middle<00:01:51.600> and<00:01:51.870> then<00:01:52.650> rotate

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:53.010 
section under the middle and then rotate

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:56.120 
section under the middle and then rotate
the<00:01:53.040> top<00:01:53.340> section<00:01:53.790> under<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.090> middle<00:01:55.130> repeat

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.080 
this a few times and then we can start

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.520 
this a few times and then we can start
adding<00:01:58.290> hair<00:01:58.440> in

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
whenever you rotate the top section
