00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
shell so if we go to the right side

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.610 
shell so if we go to the right side
below<00:00:47.480> and<00:00:48.480> we<00:00:48.660> have<00:00:48.780> here<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.110> buttons<00:00:49.500> to

time off let's say five minutes and
after<00:02:30.010> five<00:02:30.370> minutes<00:02:30.700> it<00:02:31.030> will<00:02:31.299> become<00:02:31.690> a

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
after five minutes it will become a

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.449 
after five minutes it will become a
dynamic<00:02:32.830> system<00:02:33.610> again<00:02:35.070> so<00:02:36.070> this<00:02:36.220> is<00:02:36.250> really

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459 
dynamic system again so this is really

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:39.270 
dynamic system again so this is really
exciting<00:02:36.640> so<00:02:37.299> let<00:02:37.480> me<00:02:37.600> apply<00:02:37.840> this<00:02:38.100> but<00:02:39.100> I<00:02:39.160> also
