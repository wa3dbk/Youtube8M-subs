way<00:00:19.410> I<00:00:19.439> teach<00:00:19.590> a<00:00:19.949> lot<00:00:20.100> of<00:00:20.220> my<00:00:20.310> left-handed

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
way I teach a lot of my left-handed

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.120 
way I teach a lot of my left-handed
students<00:00:21.270> which<00:00:21.449> is<00:00:21.600> sort<00:00:22.289> of<00:00:22.380> a<00:00:22.500> throwing

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
students which is sort of a throwing

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.519 
students which is sort of a throwing
stock<00:00:23.400> with<00:00:24.119> the<00:00:24.240> left<00:00:24.449> hand<00:00:24.720> but<00:00:25.019> knitting<00:00:25.350> as

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
stock with the left hand but knitting as

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.580 
stock with the left hand but knitting as
if<00:00:25.920> you<00:00:26.039> were<00:00:26.160> right<00:00:26.369> handed<00:00:26.609> so<00:00:27.119> that<00:00:28.050> way<00:00:28.260> we

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
if you were right handed so that way we

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.500 
if you were right handed so that way we
can<00:00:29.039> cover<00:00:29.189> it<00:00:29.400> a<00:00:29.550> base<00:00:29.730> and<00:00:29.760> you<00:00:30.090> can<00:00:30.240> see<00:00:30.480> how

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
can cover it a base and you can see how

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:36.350 
can cover it a base and you can see how
it<00:00:30.779> is<00:00:30.960> but<00:00:31.230> this<00:00:31.920> is<00:00:32.099> a<00:00:32.250> a<00:00:33.770> great<00:00:35.000> increase<00:00:36.000> for

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
it is but this is a a great increase for

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.770 
it is but this is a a great increase for
doing<00:00:36.660> invisible<00:00:37.380> increases<00:00:38.129> because<00:00:38.340> it

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:38.780 
doing invisible increases because it

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.810 
doing invisible increases because it
gradually<00:00:39.780> it<00:00:40.379> doesn't<00:00:41.010> make<00:00:41.070> any<00:00:41.129> hole<00:00:41.520> and

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
gradually it doesn't make any hole and

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.630 
gradually it doesn't make any hole and
it<00:00:42.450> does<00:00:42.660> a<00:00:42.690> gradual<00:00:43.410> shift<00:00:43.739> one<00:00:44.129> way<00:00:44.309> or<00:00:44.610> the

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
it does a gradual shift one way or the

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.180 
it does a gradual shift one way or the
other<00:00:45.050> most<00:00:46.050> of<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.350> time<00:00:46.530> if<00:00:46.739> it<00:00:46.860> just<00:00:47.070> says

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
other most of the time if it just says

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.400 
other most of the time if it just says
make<00:00:47.430> one<00:00:47.670> in<00:00:47.850> a<00:00:47.910> pattern<00:00:48.149> it<00:00:48.539> doesn't<00:00:49.320> matter

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
make one in a pattern it doesn't matter

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.619 
make one in a pattern it doesn't matter
which<00:00:49.739> one<00:00:49.980> you<00:00:50.010> use<00:00:50.160> it<00:00:50.700> does<00:00:50.940> matter<00:00:51.239> if<00:00:51.510> you

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
which one you use it does matter if you

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.450 
which one you use it does matter if you
start<00:00:51.840> stacking<00:00:52.440> them<00:00:52.559> on<00:00:52.710> top<00:00:52.949> of<00:00:53.010> each<00:00:53.250> other

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
start stacking them on top of each other

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.970 
start stacking them on top of each other
so<00:00:53.610> if<00:00:53.850> you're<00:00:54.000> doing<00:00:54.329> a<00:00:54.390> make<00:00:54.600> 1<00:00:54.629> left<00:00:54.840> on<00:00:55.379> the

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
so if you're doing a make 1 left on the

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.439 
so if you're doing a make 1 left on the
left<00:00:56.219> side<00:00:56.399> of<00:00:56.460> a<00:00:56.610> garment<00:00:56.850> and<00:00:57.120> make<00:00:57.270> one

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
left side of a garment and make one

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.180 
left side of a garment and make one
right<00:00:57.570> on<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.809> other<00:00:57.840> side<00:00:58.020> then<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.739> slope

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
right on the other side then the slope

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.160 
right on the other side then the slope
tends<00:00:59.609> to<00:00:59.789> go<00:00:59.910> in<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.180> same<00:01:00.359> direction<00:01:00.420> and

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
tends to go in the same direction and

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.869 
tends to go in the same direction and
it's<00:01:01.500> a<00:01:01.590> subtle<00:01:01.800> difference<00:01:02.039> but<00:01:02.550> it<00:01:02.609> can<00:01:02.850> make

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
it's a subtle difference but it can make

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.000 
it's a subtle difference but it can make
a<00:01:03.120> difference<00:01:03.300> when<00:01:03.750> they're<00:01:03.930> repeated<00:01:04.830> one

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
a difference when they're repeated one

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.240 
a difference when they're repeated one
on<00:01:05.159> top<00:01:05.309> of<00:01:05.339> another<00:01:05.960> okay<00:01:06.960> so<00:01:07.020> see<00:01:07.619> if<00:01:07.740> Monica

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
on top of another okay so see if Monica

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:16.680 
on top of another okay so see if Monica
can<00:01:08.430> get<00:01:08.580> zoomed<00:01:09.479> in<00:01:09.780> here<00:01:10.140> close<00:01:10.439> enough<00:01:10.860> and

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:16.690 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.320 

so<00:01:17.650> I<00:01:17.680> want<00:01:17.980> to<00:01:18.070> be<00:01:18.190> able<00:01:18.280> to<00:01:18.490> see<00:01:18.730> this<00:01:18.910> strand

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:19.330 
so I want to be able to see this strand

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:25.410 
so I want to be able to see this strand
right<00:01:19.690> here

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.420 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.880 

is<00:01:25.990> that<00:01:26.200> good<00:01:26.670> okay<00:01:27.670> so<00:01:28.320> basically<00:01:29.320> when

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:29.890 
is that good okay so basically when

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:31.740 
is that good okay so basically when
you're<00:01:30.009> doing<00:01:30.310> a<00:01:30.400> make<00:01:30.640> one<00:01:30.939> you<00:01:31.119> want<00:01:31.390> to<00:01:31.509> grab

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:31.750 
you're doing a make one you want to grab

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.590 
you're doing a make one you want to grab
the<00:01:32.049> bar<00:01:32.320> that<00:01:32.619> goes<00:01:32.799> between<00:01:33.490> the<00:01:34.330> two

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:34.600 
the bar that goes between the two

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.380 
the bar that goes between the two
stitches<00:01:34.990> in<00:01:35.350> the<00:01:35.470> row<00:01:35.680> below<00:01:35.950> so<00:01:36.820> if<00:01:36.850> you<00:01:37.240> can

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390 
stitches in the row below so if you can

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.310 
stitches in the row below so if you can
see<00:01:37.630> here<00:01:37.930> I've<00:01:38.049> put<00:01:38.770> my<00:01:38.890> finger<00:01:39.310> over<00:01:39.340> that

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
see here I've put my finger over that

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.710 
see here I've put my finger over that
just<00:01:41.320> like<00:01:41.500> that<00:01:41.710> so<00:01:42.369> to<00:01:42.789> make<00:01:43.000> up<00:01:43.060> to<00:01:43.570> do<00:01:43.690> a

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:43.720 
just like that so to make up to do a

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.649 
just like that so to make up to do a
make<00:01:44.170> 1<00:01:44.200> left<00:01:45.060> you're<00:01:46.060> going<00:01:46.270> to<00:01:46.390> take<00:01:46.600> your

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:46.659 
make 1 left you're going to take your

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:48.929 
make 1 left you're going to take your
left<00:01:47.049> hand<00:01:47.200> needle<00:01:47.590> and<00:01:47.979> you're<00:01:48.549> going<00:01:48.670> to<00:01:48.729> put

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:48.939 
left hand needle and you're going to put

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:51.600 
left hand needle and you're going to put
it<00:01:49.060> under<00:01:49.990> that<00:01:50.170> bar<00:01:50.380> from<00:01:50.740> front<00:01:51.220> to<00:01:51.310> back<00:01:51.430> and

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
it under that bar from front to back and

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.570 
it under that bar from front to back and
pick<00:01:52.299> it<00:01:52.420> up<00:01:52.570> and<00:01:53.220> then<00:01:54.220> you're<00:01:54.340> going<00:01:54.430> to<00:01:54.490> take

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:54.580 
pick it up and then you're going to take

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.670 
pick it up and then you're going to take
your<00:01:54.759> right<00:01:55.090> needle<00:01:55.330> and<00:01:55.689> you're<00:01:56.289> going<00:01:56.530> to

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:56.680 
your right needle and you're going to

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.999 
your right needle and you're going to
put<00:01:57.159> it<00:01:57.250> into<00:01:57.729> the<00:01:57.759> back<00:01:58.149> of<00:01:58.210> that<00:01:58.450> loop<00:01:58.720> and

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
put it into the back of that loop and

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:04.200 
put it into the back of that loop and
just<00:02:00.009> knit<00:02:00.340> it<00:02:01.860> so<00:02:02.860> that<00:02:03.069> was<00:02:03.310> a<00:02:03.549> make<00:02:04.000> 1<00:02:04.030> left

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.210 
just knit it so that was a make 1 left

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:06.719 
just knit it so that was a make 1 left
and<00:02:04.750> the<00:02:04.810> reason<00:02:05.200> it's<00:02:05.350> a<00:02:05.470> make<00:02:05.740> 1<00:02:05.770> left<00:02:06.009> is

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:06.729 
and the reason it's a make 1 left is

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:09.059 
and the reason it's a make 1 left is
because<00:02:07.479> that<00:02:07.690> twist<00:02:08.110> that<00:02:08.350> I<00:02:08.470> put<00:02:08.739> in<00:02:08.860> there

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:09.069 
because that twist that I put in there

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:10.889 
because that twist that I put in there
by<00:02:09.399> knitting<00:02:09.819> it<00:02:09.940> through<00:02:10.330> the<00:02:10.450> back<00:02:10.630> of<00:02:10.660> the

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
by knitting it through the back of the

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:16.110 
by knitting it through the back of the
loop<00:02:13.230> leans<00:02:14.230> to<00:02:14.500> the<00:02:14.530> left<00:02:14.790> let<00:02:15.790> me<00:02:15.940> nip

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
loop leans to the left let me nip

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.500 
loop leans to the left let me nip
another<00:02:16.510> one<00:02:17.010> here<00:02:18.010> I'll<00:02:18.100> do<00:02:18.280> this<00:02:18.459> one<00:02:18.519> I'll

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
another one here I'll do this one I'll

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.600 
another one here I'll do this one I'll
do<00:02:19.630> one<00:02:19.810> more<00:02:19.959> English<00:02:20.380> style<00:02:20.590> so<00:02:21.280> picking

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
do one more English style so picking

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.170 
do one more English style so picking
that<00:02:21.880> bar<00:02:22.090> up<00:02:22.330> front<00:02:22.360> to<00:02:22.840> back<00:02:23.910> putting<00:02:24.910> my

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
that bar up front to back putting my

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.380 
that bar up front to back putting my
needle<00:02:25.239> in<00:02:25.780> to<00:02:26.230> the<00:02:26.350> back<00:02:26.560> of<00:02:26.590> the<00:02:26.739> loop<00:02:27.390> always

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
needle in to the back of the loop always

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.599 
needle in to the back of the loop always
helps<00:02:28.720> to<00:02:28.840> have<00:02:28.870> nice<00:02:29.170> sharp<00:02:29.530> pointed<00:02:30.130> tips<00:02:30.400> on

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:30.609 
helps to have nice sharp pointed tips on

00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:34.080 
helps to have nice sharp pointed tips on
your<00:02:30.730> needles<00:02:31.530> and<00:02:32.530> I'm<00:02:32.680> using<00:02:32.980> on<00:02:33.820> this

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
your needles and I'm using on this

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.740 
your needles and I'm using on this
project<00:02:34.390> i'm<00:02:34.720> using<00:02:35.170> knitters<00:02:35.440> pride<00:02:35.470> cubix

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
project i'm using knitters pride cubix

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.569 
project i'm using knitters pride cubix
so<00:02:37.750> there's<00:02:38.230> another<00:02:38.590> make<00:02:38.829> one<00:02:39.070> left<00:02:39.310> now

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:39.579 
so there's another make one left now

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:41.250 
so there's another make one left now
that<00:02:39.760> was<00:02:39.910> english<00:02:40.090> style<00:02:40.480> now<00:02:40.750> here<00:02:41.019> i'll<00:02:41.109> do

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
that was english style now here i'll do

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.670 
that was english style now here i'll do
another<00:02:41.290> one<00:02:42.570> continental<00:02:43.570> so<00:02:43.989> you<00:02:44.049> can<00:02:44.440> see

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
another one continental so you can see

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.490 
another one continental so you can see
basically<00:02:45.130> the<00:02:45.519> same<00:02:45.820> basic<00:02:46.329> thing<00:02:46.359> pick<00:02:47.320> that

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
basically the same basic thing pick that

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.090 
basically the same basic thing pick that

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
knit into the back of the loop and there

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.479 
knit into the back of the loop and there
we've<00:02:58.239> done<00:02:58.480> it<00:02:59.579> I'm<00:03:00.579> going<00:03:00.760> to<00:03:00.850> do<00:03:00.970> next<00:03:01.269> one

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
we've done it I'm going to do next one

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:08.510 
we've done it I'm going to do next one

bat front to back back of the loop

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.850 
bat front to back back of the loop
now<00:03:09.520> if<00:03:09.640> you're<00:03:09.790> a<00:03:09.820> left-handed<00:03:10.510> person<00:03:10.830> may<00:03:11.830> I

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
now if you're a left-handed person may I

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.130 
now if you're a left-handed person may I
show<00:03:12.250> my<00:03:12.430> left-handers<00:03:13.150> how<00:03:13.480> to<00:03:13.540> knit<00:03:13.870> is

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
show my left-handers how to knit is

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.520 
show my left-handers how to knit is
there<00:03:14.950> generally<00:03:15.340> going<00:03:15.580> to<00:03:15.790> just<00:03:16.720> do<00:03:17.110> a<00:03:17.140> throw

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
there generally going to just do a throw

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.300 
there generally going to just do a throw
they're<00:03:17.770> just<00:03:17.950> going<00:03:18.100> to<00:03:18.220> wrap<00:03:18.490> like<00:03:19.240> that<00:03:19.510> and

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
they're just going to wrap like that and

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.620 
they're just going to wrap like that and
so<00:03:21.310> if<00:03:21.430> they're<00:03:21.580> doing<00:03:21.760> that<00:03:22.000> they're<00:03:22.390> going

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630 
so if they're doing that they're going

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:24.480 
so if they're doing that they're going
to<00:03:22.690> just<00:03:22.840> pick<00:03:23.110> it<00:03:23.260> up<00:03:23.410> exactly<00:03:24.070> the<00:03:24.130> same<00:03:24.340> way

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:24.490 
to just pick it up exactly the same way

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:28.670 
to just pick it up exactly the same way
front<00:03:24.820> to<00:03:24.970> back<00:03:25.860> into<00:03:26.860> the<00:03:26.950> back<00:03:27.100> loop<00:03:27.450> wrap

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
front to back into the back loop wrap

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.830 
front to back into the back loop wrap
and<00:03:29.680> like<00:03:30.640> that<00:03:30.850> now<00:03:31.060> those<00:03:31.270> are<00:03:31.300> make<00:03:31.600> one

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
and like that now those are make one

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.330 
and like that now those are make one
less<00:03:32.400> now<00:03:33.400> to<00:03:33.910> do<00:03:34.030> a<00:03:34.060> make<00:03:34.300> 1<00:03:34.330> right<00:03:34.980> go<00:03:35.980> back<00:03:36.160> to

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
less now to do a make 1 right go back to

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:41.850 
less now to do a make 1 right go back to
english<00:03:37.590> put<00:03:38.590> a<00:03:38.620> couple<00:03:38.860> in<00:03:39.040> here<00:03:40.800> now<00:03:41.800> we're

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:41.860 
english put a couple in here now we're

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:43.440 
english put a couple in here now we're
going<00:03:42.040> back<00:03:42.400> to<00:03:42.430> that<00:03:42.610> bar<00:03:42.910> and<00:03:43.150> this<00:03:43.270> time

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
going back to that bar and this time

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:45.150 
going back to that bar and this time
we're<00:03:43.540> going<00:03:43.630> to<00:03:43.690> pick<00:03:43.840> it<00:03:43.930> up<00:03:44.050> back<00:03:44.350> to<00:03:44.740> front

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160 
we're going to pick it up back to front

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.630 
we're going to pick it up back to front
and<00:03:46.320> we're<00:03:47.320> going<00:03:47.590> to<00:03:47.620> knit<00:03:48.070> into<00:03:48.340> the<00:03:48.520> front

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:48.640 
and we're going to knit into the front

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.510 
and we're going to knit into the front
of<00:03:49.300> the<00:03:49.450> loop<00:03:49.660> that<00:03:49.930> I've<00:03:50.050> picked<00:03:50.260> up<00:03:50.470> I<00:03:50.770> always

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:51.520 
of the loop that I've picked up I always

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.250 
of the loop that I've picked up I always
find<00:03:51.760> this<00:03:51.910> is<00:03:52.090> a<00:03:52.120> little<00:03:52.330> harder<00:03:52.780> so<00:03:52.960> I<00:03:52.990> often

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
find this is a little harder so I often

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.040 
find this is a little harder so I often
will<00:03:53.590> like<00:03:53.740> to<00:03:53.770> kind<00:03:54.610> of<00:03:54.760> scoot<00:03:55.540> it<00:03:55.690> onto<00:03:56.020> my

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:56.050 
will like to kind of scoot it onto my

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:59.910 
will like to kind of scoot it onto my
needle<00:03:56.380> with<00:03:56.650> my<00:03:56.860> fingernail<00:03:57.820> and<00:03:58.680> then<00:03:59.680> wrap

00:03:59.910 --> 00:03:59.920 
needle with my fingernail and then wrap

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.670 
needle with my fingernail and then wrap
it<00:03:59.950> and<00:04:00.330> there<00:04:01.330> and<00:04:01.630> so<00:04:01.960> the<00:04:02.080> twist<00:04:02.350> on<00:04:02.500> this

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680 
it and there and so the twist on this

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.680 
it and there and so the twist on this
goes<00:04:03.160> to<00:04:03.430> the<00:04:03.550> right<00:04:03.760> so<00:04:04.300> those<00:04:04.450> stitches

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:04.690 
goes to the right so those stitches

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:06.720 
goes to the right so those stitches
would<00:04:05.020> kind<00:04:05.230> of<00:04:05.320> lean<00:04:05.590> ever<00:04:05.920> so<00:04:06.250> slightly<00:04:06.550> to

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730 
would kind of lean ever so slightly to

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:14.670 
would kind of lean ever so slightly to
the<00:04:06.880> right<00:04:07.560> do<00:04:08.560> it<00:04:08.680> again<00:04:11.820> back<00:04:12.820> to<00:04:13.180> front<00:04:13.780> just

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
the right do it again back to front just

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:19.599 
the right do it again back to front just
one<00:04:14.860> bar<00:04:15.130> not<00:04:15.430> too<00:04:16.080> there<00:04:17.080> we<00:04:17.200> go

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:29.920 

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:33.650 

okay<00:04:30.430> i<00:04:30.700> will<00:04:31.180> show<00:04:31.420> you<00:04:31.480> again<00:04:31.840> continental

okay i will show you again continental

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:40.110 
okay i will show you again continental
pick<00:04:34.660> it<00:04:34.780> up<00:04:34.930> back<00:04:35.800> to<00:04:36.280> front<00:04:38.670> get<00:04:39.670> it<00:04:39.820> into<00:04:39.970> the

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.120 
pick it up back to front get it into the

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:44.700 
pick it up back to front get it into the
front<00:04:40.540> of<00:04:40.630> that<00:04:40.720> loop

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:44.710 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:46.980 

over<00:04:45.520> that

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:46.990 
over that

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:51.360 
over that
again<00:04:47.620> continental<00:04:48.570> back<00:04:49.570> to<00:04:49.960> front<00:04:50.290> and<00:04:50.860> into

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:51.370 
again continental back to front and into

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:56.439 
again continental back to front and into
the<00:04:51.460> front<00:04:51.730> of<00:04:51.820> the<00:04:51.880> loop

00:04:56.439 --> 00:04:56.449 

00:04:56.449 --> 00:05:02.200 

and<00:04:56.629> then<00:04:56.930> for<00:04:57.110> the<00:04:57.199> lefties<00:04:58.389> same<00:04:59.389> thing<00:05:01.210> back

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:02.210 
and then for the lefties same thing back

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:08.279 
and then for the lefties same thing back
to<00:05:02.539> front<00:05:04.659> there

00:05:08.279 --> 00:05:08.289 

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:14.040 

it<00:05:08.589> wrapped<00:05:09.599> and<00:05:10.599> pull<00:05:10.839> through<00:05:11.699> okay<00:05:12.699> so<00:05:13.449> let

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:14.050 
it wrapped and pull through okay so let

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:16.159 
it wrapped and pull through okay so let
me<00:05:14.080> run<00:05:14.379> through<00:05:14.589> those<00:05:14.770> again<00:05:15.099> one<00:05:15.699> more<00:05:15.879> time

00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:16.169 
me run through those again one more time

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:21.629 
me run through those again one more time
so<00:05:18.149> make<00:05:19.149> one<00:05:19.479> left<00:05:20.129> you're<00:05:21.129> going<00:05:21.279> to<00:05:21.369> pick<00:05:21.520> it

00:05:21.629 --> 00:05:21.639 
so make one left you're going to pick it

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:29.540 
so make one left you're going to pick it
up<00:05:21.759> front<00:05:22.539> to<00:05:22.749> back<00:05:22.779> and<00:05:23.580> into<00:05:24.580> the<00:05:24.699> back<00:05:24.999> loop

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:29.550 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:34.379 

make<00:05:30.550> one<00:05:30.819> right<00:05:31.889> back<00:05:32.889> to<00:05:33.189> front<00:05:33.550> knit<00:05:34.210> into

00:05:34.379 --> 00:05:34.389 
make one right back to front knit into

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:37.619 
make one right back to front knit into
the<00:05:34.479> front<00:05:34.599> loop<00:05:35.879> so<00:05:36.879> you<00:05:36.939> go<00:05:37.089> front<00:05:37.360> back<00:05:37.569> back

00:05:37.619 --> 00:05:37.629 
the front loop so you go front back back

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:40.799 
the front loop so you go front back back
or<00:05:38.199> back<00:05:38.710> front<00:05:39.069> front<00:05:39.189> but<00:05:40.059> that<00:05:40.180> helps<00:05:40.569> and

00:05:40.799 --> 00:05:40.809 
or back front front but that helps and

00:05:40.809 --> 00:05:43.379 
or back front front but that helps and
that's<00:05:41.740> how<00:05:41.949> you<00:05:42.009> do<00:05:42.339> your<00:05:42.580> make<00:05:42.909> one<00:05:43.149> writes

00:05:43.379 --> 00:05:43.389 
that's how you do your make one writes

00:05:43.389 --> 00:05:49.769 
that's how you do your make one writes
and<00:05:43.689> make<00:05:44.020> one<00:05:44.229> less<00:05:48.149> so<00:05:49.149> if<00:05:49.270> you<00:05:49.419> have<00:05:49.599> any

00:05:49.769 --> 00:05:49.779 
and make one less so if you have any

00:05:49.779 --> 00:05:51.209 
and make one less so if you have any
questions<00:05:50.199> would<00:05:50.349> be<00:05:50.469> happy<00:05:50.740> to<00:05:50.860> help<00:05:51.009> you<00:05:51.189> out
