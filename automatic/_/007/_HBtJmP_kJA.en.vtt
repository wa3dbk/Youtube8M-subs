00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:05.940
 At apple , our customers are the first 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:09.269
 and of course 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.920
 highest priority is not lacking us anymore 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.780
 in the heart as theirs to live 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.519
 simplify and a little bit far 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.560
 more entertaining 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.720
 our everyday life and increasingly hectic and 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.180
 confusing we take a lot 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.800
 a lot of wanting to do too much around 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.960
 reach the impossible 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.800
 but our biggest enemy is still 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.050
 always the time 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.920
 We postpone our obligations 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.109
 deep into the night 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.899
 these are usually too exhausted and 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.690
 to be productive and the consequences are 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.399
 usually only felt the next day 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:40.550
 Tiredness and problems getting up 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.200
 are not rare here 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:45.690
 Insomnia is a big problem 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.340
 of today's youth cultures the 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.260
 Students often sit 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.120
 nightly in front of the tv and 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.809
 computer and play brutal killer 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.309
 games 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.289
 instead of the prescribed ones 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.910
 to do homework or for one 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.250
 important brand addition will be to learn 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.199
 we at Apple have the problem yet 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.690
 recognized in time and it is quite 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.619
 Targeted approach 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.510
 together with the world's best 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.939
 programmers we sat down 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.490
 and a new app will of course be one 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.799
 app the life of all people from now on 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:17.100
 we should baptize completely 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:19.259
 She loves months long 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.720
 we have various designs and created 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.119
 functional programs from day to day 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.119
 day was our project and stronger and 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:29.820
 everyday use but what exactly is a 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.590
 love actually they can run with ice 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.960
 just spontaneous and totally 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.860
 disconnect carefree completely no matter where 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.720
 they are straight 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.070
 Imagine they come after 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.799
 a hectic day at home 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.770
 still have to shop but would spend a lot 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.310
 rather do not sleep at all 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.079
 bock on one 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.870
 what would not I be a little bit now 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:50.560
 live nap 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:50.560
 38 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.080
 or you sit in front of the television 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:04.550
 but are far too comfortable now 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:07.229
 to get up and go to bed 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:08.130
 Should Switzerland be removed in four 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.140
 hours I have to go again 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.090
 get up it's supposed to be fasting behind 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.990
 to go to sleep 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.230
 moment I have the new app of 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.230
 apple 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.260
 This app is also included 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.450
 to use caution 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:29.040
 it should not be used for 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.040
 For example, if you cross a street 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.080
 if you're just in a patch 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:39.150
 or if they just at crossing 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.780
 This time we also have various 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.520
 special functions built-in 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.290
 For example, if the just in the 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.210
 put school math lessons and 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.340
 just want to sleep a little bit 

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:52.390
 This can make your eyes easy 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.000
 stay open 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:57.640
 or when your parents come in again 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.470
 annoying and unnecessary draw conversation 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.370
 want to lead and you do not feel like it 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.860
 have to listen 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:06.190
 we have the functions to match this 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:10.330
 which automatically answer for you maria 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:13.290
 upset because no buyer can be found 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:15.250
 Anyway stay 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.380

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.150

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:22.060

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:25.750
 smartphones how does it cost everyone ? 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.830
 related functions 1 599 euro 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.690
 bargain 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:30.580
 and because I do not feel like it anymore 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.900
 to tell this nonsense here 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:34.380
