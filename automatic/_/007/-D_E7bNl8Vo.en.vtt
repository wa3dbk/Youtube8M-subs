00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.940 
going to review on the lego sorting head
and<00:00:07.649> the<00:00:08.220> demonstration<00:00:08.880> of<00:00:09.000> how<00:00:09.150> it<00:00:09.240> works

standard face here and there's a few
other<00:00:16.949> ones<00:00:18.320> firstly<00:00:19.320> just<00:00:19.350> see<00:00:19.680> what<00:00:19.920> it<00:00:20.039> is

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
other ones firstly just see what it is

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.040 
other ones firstly just see what it is
it's<00:00:21.029> basically<00:00:21.180> a<00:00:21.779> big<00:00:22.289> plastic<00:00:22.560> head<00:00:23.779> as<00:00:24.779> the

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
it's basically a big plastic head as the

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.160 
it's basically a big plastic head as the
Lego<00:00:25.380> logo<00:00:25.800> on<00:00:25.949> the<00:00:26.099> top<00:00:26.990> and<00:00:28.189> it<00:00:29.189> comes<00:00:29.429> in

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:30.170 
Lego logo on the top and it comes in

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:33.280 
Lego logo on the top and it comes in
apart<00:00:31.170> several<00:00:31.590> pieces<00:00:31.859> smooth<00:00:32.430> at<00:00:32.669> the<00:00:32.790> top

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:33.290 
apart several pieces smooth at the top

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.220 
apart several pieces smooth at the top
to<00:00:34.290> make<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.530> hole<00:00:35.540> got<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.660> top<00:00:36.870> layer<00:00:37.050> which

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
to make the hole got the top layer which

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:44.770 
to make the hole got the top layer which
lops<00:00:40.040> turn<00:00:41.040> around<00:00:41.280> this<00:00:41.340> way<00:00:41.430> got<00:00:42.500> on<00:00:43.500> tree

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:44.780 
lops turn around this way got on tree

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:51.410 
lops turn around this way got on tree
two<00:00:45.780> trees<00:00:47.180> and<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.329> best<00:00:49.820> so<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:51.059> trees<00:00:51.239> only

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
two trees and the best so the trees only

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.860 
two trees and the best so the trees only
go<00:00:51.690> back<00:00:51.930> in<00:00:52.110> one<00:00:52.350> way<00:00:52.530> smallest<00:00:53.489> hole<00:00:54.390> goes

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
go back in one way smallest hole goes

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.779 
go back in one way smallest hole goes
first<00:00:57.350> then<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.500> next<00:00:58.710> one<00:00:58.859> actually<00:00:59.579> don't

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
first then the next one actually don't

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.060 
first then the next one actually don't
speak<00:01:00.180> by<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:00.809> way<00:01:01.020> they're<00:01:01.500> going<00:01:01.620> to<00:01:01.680> only

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
speak by the way they're going to only

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:14.660 
speak by the way they're going to only
go<00:01:02.190> in<00:01:02.370> one<00:01:02.399> way<00:01:02.579> and<00:01:08.060> handle<00:01:09.060> to<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.270> back<00:01:13.670> and

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
go in one way and handle to the back and

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.539 
go in one way and handle to the back and
then<00:01:14.880> you've<00:01:14.970> got<00:01:15.119> your<00:01:15.240> top<00:01:15.420> so<00:01:16.380> turn<00:01:17.369> back

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
then you've got your top so turn back

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.100 
then you've got your top so turn back
around<00:01:17.670> round<00:01:17.970> here<00:01:18.270> so<00:01:18.479> got<00:01:18.750> something<00:01:18.990> to

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
around round here so got something to

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.170 
around round here so got something to
look<00:01:19.170> out<00:01:19.350> what<00:01:20.280> I'm<00:01:20.369> going<00:01:20.460> to<00:01:20.520> do<00:01:20.670> now<00:01:20.820> is<00:01:20.939> put

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
look out what I'm going to do now is put

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.300 
look out what I'm going to do now is put
all<00:01:21.330> this<00:01:21.570> container<00:01:22.530> of<00:01:22.680> Lego<00:01:22.890> into<00:01:23.340> here<00:01:25.310> the

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
all this container of Lego into here the

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.670 
all this container of Lego into here the
best<00:01:27.270> way<00:01:27.450> to<00:01:27.479> get<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.780> best<00:01:27.930> results<00:01:28.409> for<00:01:28.560> the

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
best way to get the best results for the

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:34.630 
best way to get the best results for the
sorting<00:01:29.130> itself

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:44.020 

so<00:01:36.799> you<00:01:37.799> it<00:01:37.920> all<00:01:38.009> falling<00:01:38.399> in<00:01:38.490> there

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:50.209 

swatting<00:01:45.030> itself<00:01:45.359> into<00:01:48.979> that's<00:01:49.979> going<00:01:50.159> to

00:01:50.209 --> 00:01:50.219 
swatting itself into that's going to

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:52.249 
swatting itself into that's going to
take<00:01:50.369> a<00:01:50.399> very<00:01:50.579> long<00:01:50.700> time<00:01:51.090> so<00:01:51.630> a<00:01:51.659> critical<00:01:52.020> way

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
take a very long time so a critical way

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:53.959 
take a very long time so a critical way
to<00:01:52.319> do<00:01:52.560> it<00:01:52.679> obviously<00:01:52.799> would<00:01:53.250> be<00:01:53.399> to<00:01:53.520> take<00:01:53.700> top

00:01:53.959 --> 00:01:53.969 
to do it obviously would be to take top

00:01:53.969 --> 00:02:01.819 
to do it obviously would be to take top
off<00:01:54.140> and<00:01:55.140> it's<00:01:55.469> activity<00:02:00.409> I'm<00:02:01.409> trying<00:02:01.649> to<00:02:01.709> put

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
off and it's activity I'm trying to put

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.319 
off and it's activity I'm trying to put
pretty<00:02:01.979> much<00:02:02.100> like<00:02:02.369> you<00:02:02.429> review<00:02:02.640> the

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
pretty much like you review the

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.080 
pretty much like you review the
directions<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:04.079> that<00:02:04.469> it<00:02:04.560> comes<00:02:04.770> to<00:02:05.090> suggest

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
directions the that it comes to suggest

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:54.559 
directions the that it comes to suggest
that<00:02:06.240> you<00:02:06.329> shakers<00:02:07.729> gently<00:02:08.729> as<00:02:08.880> you<00:02:08.910> go

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:54.569 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:03:09.899 

what<00:02:55.829> topic<00:02:56.829> on<00:03:08.069> all<00:03:09.069> these<00:03:09.250> little<00:03:09.430> bits<00:03:09.730> to

00:03:09.899 --> 00:03:09.909 
what topic on all these little bits to

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:18.690 
what topic on all these little bits to
the<00:03:10.030> same<00:03:12.659> little<00:03:16.950> okay<00:03:17.950> so<00:03:18.010> the<00:03:18.370> liquid<00:03:18.489> is

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
the same little okay so the liquid is

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:31.309 
the same little okay so the liquid is
now<00:03:18.819> stored<00:03:19.090> in<00:03:19.239> there<00:03:20.730> just<00:03:21.730> show<00:03:21.939> you

00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:31.319 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:34.259 

firstly<00:03:32.319> it's<00:03:32.530> quite<00:03:32.829> for<00:03:33.129> this<00:03:33.639> lots<00:03:33.970> of<00:03:34.090> big

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:34.269 
firstly it's quite for this lots of big

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:39.140 
firstly it's quite for this lots of big
pieces<00:03:35.340> secondly<00:03:36.340> it<00:03:36.579> has<00:03:36.790> smaller<00:03:37.329> editions

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
pieces secondly it has smaller editions

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.000 
pieces secondly it has smaller editions
and<00:03:40.150> the<00:03:40.689> bottom<00:03:40.989> layer<00:03:41.169> has<00:03:41.439> the<00:03:41.469> smallest

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
and the bottom layer has the smallest

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:47.459 
and the bottom layer has the smallest
pieces<00:03:43.799> so<00:03:45.450> it's<00:03:46.450> not<00:03:46.599> the<00:03:46.750> exact<00:03:47.019> science

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:47.469 
pieces so it's not the exact science

00:03:47.469 --> 00:03:52.770 
pieces so it's not the exact science
that's<00:03:48.129> pretty<00:03:48.549> good<00:03:50.370> it<00:03:51.370> still<00:03:51.669> makes<00:03:52.629> it

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780 
that's pretty good it still makes it

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.440 
that's pretty good it still makes it
easier<00:03:53.079> to<00:03:53.430> put<00:03:54.430> away<00:03:54.519> my<00:03:54.819> guess<00:03:55.000> is<00:03:55.150> you<00:03:55.359> to

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
easier to put away my guess is you to

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:56.940 
easier to put away my guess is you to
find<00:03:55.689> different<00:03:55.959> pieces<00:03:56.379> when<00:03:56.829> you're

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:56.950 
find different pieces when you're

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:58.800 
find different pieces when you're
actually<00:03:57.099> wanting<00:03:57.519> to<00:03:57.669> make<00:03:57.879> something<00:03:58.389> so

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
actually wanting to make something so

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:06.770 
actually wanting to make something so
it's<00:03:59.799> pretty<00:03:59.949> functional<00:04:01.139> pretty<00:04:02.139> cute

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:15.300 

that's<00:04:07.780> what<00:04:07.989> it<00:04:08.079> does<00:04:10.739> so<00:04:11.739> there<00:04:11.919> you<00:04:11.979> have<00:04:12.040> it

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:17.370 

you
