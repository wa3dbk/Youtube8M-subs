00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:00.570 
going to bottleneck these guys into
somewhere<00:02:59.380> dangerous<00:02:59.590> and<00:03:00.069> make<00:03:00.220> sure<00:03:00.250> they

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580 
somewhere dangerous and make sure they

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.550 
somewhere dangerous and make sure they
come<00:03:00.790> this<00:03:00.970> way<00:03:01.150> so<00:03:01.660> that<00:03:01.690> i<00:03:01.870> can<00:03:02.019> essentially

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
come this way so that i can essentially

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.710 
come this way so that i can essentially
trap<00:03:02.920> them<00:03:03.099> and<00:03:03.250> hit<00:03:03.340> them<00:03:03.370> with<00:03:03.610> arrows<00:03:04.060> so

00:03:05.789 --> 00:03:05.799 
what we're going to do is we're going to

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:08.339 
what we're going to do is we're going to
completely<00:03:06.220> cover<00:03:07.000> this<00:03:07.180> entire<00:03:07.420> area<00:03:07.900> here
