it looks like you know every now and

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:25.770 
it looks like you know every now and
then<00:02:24.160> it<00:02:24.250> looks<00:02:24.370> a<00:02:24.490> little<00:02:24.610> mouthy<00:02:25.450> with<00:02:25.570> this

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
then it looks a little mouthy with this

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.390 
then it looks a little mouthy with this
bit<00:02:26.020> and<00:02:26.200> he<00:02:26.260> makes<00:02:26.890> it

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
bit and he makes it

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.070 
bit and he makes it
yeah<00:02:27.490> Eve<00:02:27.730> really<00:02:28.060> isn't<00:02:28.330> that's<00:02:28.600> not<00:02:28.780> really

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
yeah Eve really isn't that's not really

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:34.290 
yeah Eve really isn't that's not really
part<00:02:29.290> of<00:02:29.410> him<00:02:29.560> I<00:02:32.640> think<00:02:33.640> when<00:02:33.790> she<00:02:33.940> asked<00:02:34.150> him<00:02:34.240> a

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
part of him I think when she asked him a

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:39.390 
part of him I think when she asked him a
trot<00:02:34.600> it<00:02:34.840> was<00:02:34.960> a<00:02:34.990> little<00:02:35.320> bit<00:02:35.470> sharp<00:02:38.100> last<00:02:39.100> time

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
trot it was a little bit sharp last time

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.540 
trot it was a little bit sharp last time
gets<00:02:39.970> a<00:02:40.090> little<00:02:40.210> long<00:02:40.480> there<00:02:41.370> yeah<00:02:42.370> I<00:02:42.400> think

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
gets a little long there yeah I think

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.130 
gets a little long there yeah I think
you<00:02:42.910> know<00:02:43.060> you<00:02:43.120> really<00:02:43.360> have<00:02:43.570> to<00:02:43.660> have<00:02:43.750> a<00:02:43.810> plan

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
you know you really have to have a plan

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.870 
you know you really have to have a plan
there<00:02:44.470> I<00:02:44.500> think<00:02:44.650> I<00:02:45.190> think<00:02:45.670> they<00:02:45.820> were

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
there I think I think they were

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.730 
there I think I think they were
originally<00:02:46.330> thinking<00:02:46.570> maybe<00:02:46.720> five<00:02:47.080> one<00:02:47.410> six

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:47.740 
originally thinking maybe five one six

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:50.400 
originally thinking maybe five one six
and<00:02:48.130> you<00:02:49.060> know<00:02:49.180> but<00:02:49.330> I<00:02:49.390> think<00:02:49.780> it's<00:02:49.870> five<00:02:50.110> one

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
and you know but I think it's five one

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.320 
and you know but I think it's five one
five<00:02:50.680> but<00:02:50.950> I<00:02:50.980> think<00:02:51.250> as<00:02:51.430> you<00:02:51.490> jump<00:02:51.910> out<00:02:52.090> of<00:02:52.150> the

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
five but I think as you jump out of the

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:53.790 
five but I think as you jump out of the
internet<00:02:52.630> you<00:02:52.750> really<00:02:53.020> need<00:02:53.200> to<00:02:53.290> be<00:02:53.410> thinking

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.800 
internet you really need to be thinking

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.080 
internet you really need to be thinking
right<00:02:54.340> lead<00:02:54.850> them<00:02:55.000> right<00:02:55.030> go<00:02:55.540> get<00:02:55.690> the<00:02:55.840> five
