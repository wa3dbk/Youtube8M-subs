 strong that is also talking because 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.680
 he saw the press that was there he did not know 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.639
 the subject I would like to address can also 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.230
 to be is news in development 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.719
 we will be there for weeks to whom 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.449
 even if we are going to be attentive to the one 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:22.230
 happens in that marriage also what 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.970
 is the role of the Peruvian characters in 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.619
 the whole chilean television there is a 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.410
 photo gallery that is telling us 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.640
 that we are telling ourselves how are the 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.070
 characters but not only present no 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.340
 they have hope and hope for 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.870
 example the teleserie is also saying is 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.550
 our historical as it has been 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.660
 ill represented on another television 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.660
 or we see the next note even 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.860
 and 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:53.100
 after the controversial failure of the beech after 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.260
 The careful maritime conflict between Peru 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.880
 and chile we wanted to remind the 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.620
 Peruvian characters that have gone through 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:01.430
 Chilean television interpreted by 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.430
 national actors 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:10.100
 of monkeys to the year 1998 when the three 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.930
 series blur and new account of tvn 3 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.210
 paula zúñiga played the employee 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.860
 magician and lituma being one of the first 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.370
 in characterizing itself as the recognized 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.370
 Peruvian nanny 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:26.380
 that five years later I would repeat the 

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:28.969
 former minister of culture paulina urrutia 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.590
 giving life to sofía méndez employed 

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:33.039
 Peruvian in the teleserie of doors 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.039
 in 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.060
 the most remembered Peruvian nannies 

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:44.189
 interpreted on our television 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.899
 the protagonist of hope production 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.000
 from tvn who went back to relive the schedule 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.649
 of the teleseries after lunch of 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.030
 the written or the ramirez interpreted 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.030
 a suffering one uses to look at you 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.870
 generally in the series 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.840
 fiction 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:06.250
 sketches in different instances not 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.200
 new in generally not only 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.450
 with respect to foreigners 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.270
 fundamentally respect 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.489
 our own reality here is presented 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.170
 to the games in a way is presented to 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:18.420
 those that are not games of another way and 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.190
 they are obviously caricature 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.140
 I think that somehow 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.910
 be certain caricature 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.500
 a reiterative character the 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.540
 national dramatic productions 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:33.190
 current reality or a wrong 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:34.630
 stereotype of the neighboring country but about 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.819
 all the issues have to be treated 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:38.140
 present with respect, that is if there is a 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:39.910
 humiliation and we see people who 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.800
 saying you Peruvian clear 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.570
 obviously it falls then it is portrayed to 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.459
 a person who works a advisor 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:47.680
 home of Peruvian descent is 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:49.840
 answering one to one reality is us 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.300
 showing nothing denigrating and nothing that is 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:55.010
 false is a reality I think that 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:57.980
 always so a bit paradoxical 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.450
 well that also depends on the 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.710
 channel creativity that pretty 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:04.020
 limited 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:06.520
 that does not surprise me that is like 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:08.020
 the official reading 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.430
 another of the actresses who have 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.740
 interpreted characters but they are not 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.570
 tamara acosta and claudia heads giving and 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.970
 of the clementine sisters and mariah 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:20.010
 paita in pampa illusion teleserie also 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:20.010
 of the state channel exhibited in 2001 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:29.189
 in a more humorous context in the year 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.709
 2009 the iquiqueño actor fernando today gave 

00:03:29.189 --> 00:03:33.030
 life to the Hindu immigrant character who 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:35.489
 leads to interrupting Luis Jara in the 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:38.580
 stellar a punch of struggle personifying 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:40.660
 an undocumented Peruvian in our country 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:44.440
 obviously if it is through humor 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:48.350
 there is a graph and a drawing from behind 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:52.280
 thicker and obviously always 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:57.310
 when characterizing or doing a mode with 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:57.310
 respect to operate not always others 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:04.900
 then about that one tries to 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:06.340
 clear to draw and accept much more and 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.050
 I think what but do not do the same with 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.390
 us good I think the last 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:12.790
 time has been portrayed 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:16.410
 with my ignorance with a stereotype 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:16.410
 as peruano was 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:20.410
 a weak man 

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:26.120
 mocking a mocking character 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:28.490
 finally the terrain the teleseries the 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:30.590
 2011 mega took the air the goodbye series to the 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:32.270
 seventh of a story line that narrated the 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:35.050
 war the peaceful starring 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:35.050
 Fernando left the 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:41.830
 after the long list of characters 

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:43.930
 Peruvian interpreted in our 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:47.210
 screen girls have been these well 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:49.340
 represented on Chilean television 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:51.240
 the approach that is made in slope 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:54.150
 It costs a lot 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:56.460
 the same as sometimes the Argentine when 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:58.560
 tries to characterize the Chilean 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:01.020
 it costs a lot to us peace equal 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:04.729
 with the Peruvian given that the phenomena 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:07.110
 cultural the the voice flexes 

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:11.310
 it's very difficult for a comedian 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:13.349
 I can take advantage of it, I think the 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:15.840
 representation of the Peruvians of the 

00:05:13.349 --> 00:05:18.810
 immigrants in general in chile is very 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:20.849
 The debit is what happens with all kinds of 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:22.620
 minorities within our society that 

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:26.289
 it is still quite pejorative in many 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:28.419
 quite ignorant cases in other cases 

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:30.279
 I think that TV would be hope of 

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:33.219
 national television of chile saw us in 

00:05:30.279 --> 00:05:35.379
 some measure or showed us an advance 

00:05:33.219 --> 00:05:37.230
 about how we see the 

00:05:35.379 --> 00:05:39.210
 neighboring countries 

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:40.230
 diverse and varied opinions generate 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:42.990
 the representations of characters 

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:44.280
 Peruvians on our television stage 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:46.470
 which he assured as the resolution 

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:49.640
 of the court of the beech in addition to some 

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:49.640
 will not leave according 

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:52.780
 safety pin
