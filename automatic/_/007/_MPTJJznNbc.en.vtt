00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509 
okay this is just Geo Metro calm before

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:08.240 
okay this is just Geo Metro calm before
doing<00:00:06.930> is<00:00:07.259> I'm<00:00:07.529> going<00:00:07.560> to<00:00:07.710> show<00:00:07.830> you<00:00:07.859> how<00:00:08.010> to<00:00:08.130> do

doing is I'm going to show you how to do
the<00:00:08.370> proper<00:00:09.530> compression<00:00:10.530> check<00:00:10.769> on<00:00:10.950> the

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
the proper compression check on the

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.620 
the proper compression check on the
engine<00:00:11.570> the<00:00:14.120> what<00:00:15.120> I've<00:00:15.240> done<00:00:15.389> is<00:00:15.509> I've

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
engine the what I've done is I've

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.029 
engine the what I've done is I've
already<00:00:15.839> removed<00:00:16.080> the<00:00:16.350> bolts<00:00:16.710> for<00:00:16.800> the<00:00:16.859> air

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
already removed the bolts for the air

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.220 
already removed the bolts for the air
cleaner<00:00:17.340> so<00:00:17.880> I<00:00:17.940> can<00:00:18.150> remove<00:00:18.510> it<00:00:18.570> quickly<00:00:18.990> and

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
cleaner so I can remove it quickly and

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.560 
cleaner so I can remove it quickly and
easily<00:00:19.380> so<00:00:19.920> we<00:00:20.070> can<00:00:20.250> go<00:00:21.210> through<00:00:21.449> this<00:00:21.510> a

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
easily so we can go through this a

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.540 
easily so we can go through this a
little<00:00:21.750> faster<00:00:22.260> than<00:00:22.410> normal<00:00:22.470> this<00:00:23.279> car

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
little faster than normal this car

do an inspection on the belt at the

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.100 
do an inspection on the belt at the
tensioner<00:02:02.800> and<00:02:02.830> pulley<00:02:03.690> every<00:02:04.690> time<00:02:04.870> to<00:02:04.960> check

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
tensioner and pulley every time to check

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.230 
tensioner and pulley every time to check
the<00:02:05.290> oil<00:02:05.320> I<00:02:05.710> recommend<00:02:06.310> you<00:02:06.370> do<00:02:06.550> that<00:02:06.700> to<00:02:06.850> every

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
the oil I recommend you do that to every

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:13.140 
the oil I recommend you do that to every
car<00:02:07.960> out<00:02:07.990> there<00:02:10.020> so<00:02:11.670> what<00:02:12.670> we've<00:02:12.820> done<00:02:12.970> is

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
car out there so what we've done is

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.850 
car out there so what we've done is
we've<00:02:13.300> starved<00:02:13.720> the<00:02:13.960> engine<00:02:14.260> of<00:02:14.380> fuel<00:02:16.740> and<00:02:17.740> the

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
we've starved the engine of fuel and the

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.740 
we've starved the engine of fuel and the
reason<00:02:18.190> for<00:02:18.220> this<00:02:18.640> and<00:02:19.240> we've<00:02:19.390> left<00:02:19.600> the

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
reason for this and we've left the

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.900 
reason for this and we've left the
injector<00:02:20.140> unplug<00:02:20.560> and<00:02:21.040> the<00:02:21.400> reason<00:02:21.670> for<00:02:21.700> this

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
injector unplug and the reason for this

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.000 
injector unplug and the reason for this
is<00:02:21.970> when<00:02:22.240> we<00:02:22.330> crank<00:02:22.570> it<00:02:22.690> over<00:02:22.840> it<00:02:23.530> would<00:02:23.710> spray

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
is when we crank it over it would spray

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.890 
is when we crank it over it would spray
fuel<00:02:24.370> and<00:02:24.610> then<00:02:24.820> it<00:02:24.940> washes<00:02:25.180> the<00:02:25.480> fuel<00:02:25.750> down

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
fuel and then it washes the fuel down

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.690 
fuel and then it washes the fuel down
the<00:02:26.080> runners<00:02:26.440> and<00:02:26.950> before<00:02:27.340> you<00:02:27.430> get<00:02:27.580> your

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
the runners and before you get your

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.670 
the runners and before you get your
compression<00:02:28.180> check<00:02:28.360> done<00:02:28.660> the<00:02:29.200> compression

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
compression check done the compression

brand-new<00:03:46.920> this<00:03:47.920> is<00:03:48.100> a<00:03:48.130> rearing<00:03:49.030> motor<00:03:49.450> or

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:50.320 
brand-new this is a rearing motor or

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.080 
brand-new this is a rearing motor or
what<00:03:50.590> we<00:03:50.680> call<00:03:50.830> our<00:03:51.010> rebuilt<00:03:51.430> engine<00:03:51.850> that<00:03:52.000> we

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
what we call our rebuilt engine that we

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:54.660 
what we call our rebuilt engine that we
sell<00:03:52.390> and<00:03:52.690> then<00:03:53.170> it<00:03:53.290> has<00:03:53.410> an<00:03:53.560> mpg<00:03:54.100> head<00:03:54.280> on<00:03:54.490> it

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:54.670 
sell and then it has an mpg head on it

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:57.540 
sell and then it has an mpg head on it
so<00:03:55.360> that<00:03:55.540> gives<00:03:55.780> us<00:03:55.930> the<00:03:56.140> Keysha<00:03:56.560> from<00:03:56.860> 150

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:57.550 
so that gives us the Keysha from 150

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:59.160 
so that gives us the Keysha from 150
pounds<00:03:57.910> that<00:03:58.000> you'd<00:03:58.120> have<00:03:58.270> from<00:03:58.420> rearing<00:03:58.840> just

00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.170 
pounds that you'd have from rearing just

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.680 
pounds that you'd have from rearing just
rebuilding<00:03:59.620> a<00:03:59.680> motor<00:03:59.890> without<00:04:00.610> boring<00:04:00.940> it<00:04:01.240> and

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:01.690 
rebuilding a motor without boring it and

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:03.570 
rebuilding a motor without boring it and
that<00:04:01.960> gives<00:04:02.080> us<00:04:02.260> is<00:04:02.410> our<00:04:02.590> extra<00:04:02.920> 30<00:04:03.160> pounds<00:04:03.520> of

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:03.580 
that gives us is our extra 30 pounds of

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:06.810 
that gives us is our extra 30 pounds of
compression<00:04:04.180> and<00:04:05.040> that's<00:04:06.040> how<00:04:06.190> we<00:04:06.340> make<00:04:06.670> the

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:06.820 
compression and that's how we make the

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:11.100 
compression and that's how we make the
mpg<00:04:07.740> it<00:04:08.740> works<00:04:09.190> so<00:04:09.400> good<00:04:09.430> on<00:04:09.790> a<00:04:09.900> rebuilt<00:04:10.900> motor

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:11.110 
mpg it works so good on a rebuilt motor

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:14.040 
mpg it works so good on a rebuilt motor
and<00:04:11.500> then<00:04:12.040> went<00:04:12.250> on<00:04:12.460> a<00:04:12.490> brand<00:04:13.390> new<00:04:13.510> motor

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:14.050 
and then went on a brand new motor

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
and then went on a brand new motor
it's<00:04:14.710> a<00:04:15.209> reflector<00:04:16.209> minute<00:04:16.799> when<00:04:17.799> it's<00:04:17.920> on<00:04:18.040> a

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
it's a reflector minute when it's on a

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:19.949 
it's a reflector minute when it's on a
brand<00:04:18.370> new<00:04:18.459> motor<00:04:18.790> the<00:04:19.090> it's<00:04:19.570> even<00:04:19.840> higher

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 
brand new motor the it's even higher

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:22.260 
brand new motor the it's even higher
compression<00:04:20.530> so<00:04:20.920> it's<00:04:21.070> it<00:04:21.430> even<00:04:21.640> works<00:04:21.820> better

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
compression so it's it even works better

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.540 
compression so it's it even works better
a<00:04:22.690> lot<00:04:23.260> better<00:04:23.560> that's<00:04:23.770> why<00:04:23.950> we<00:04:24.070> get<00:04:24.220> the<00:04:24.340> most

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.550 
a lot better that's why we get the most

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:26.310 
a lot better that's why we get the most
gas<00:04:24.820> miles<00:04:25.150> in<00:04:25.420> the<00:04:25.510> industry

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.320 
gas miles in the industry

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.200 
gas miles in the industry
okay<00:04:26.980> now<00:04:27.190> we're<00:04:27.490> going<00:04:27.580> to<00:04:27.670> do<00:04:27.760> is<00:04:27.850> plug<00:04:28.030> the

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.210 
okay now we're going to do is plug the

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:30.510 
okay now we're going to do is plug the
injector<00:04:28.600> back<00:04:28.810> in<00:04:29.080> why<00:04:30.040> don't<00:04:30.160> you<00:04:30.250> go<00:04:30.370> ahead

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 
injector back in why don't you go ahead

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:36.780 
injector back in why don't you go ahead
and<00:04:30.870> crank<00:04:31.870> it<00:04:32.020> over<00:04:33.780> and<00:04:35.460> let's<00:04:36.460> crank<00:04:36.670> it

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:36.790 
and crank it over and let's crank it

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:42.690 
and crank it over and let's crank it
till<00:04:36.940> I<00:04:36.970> tell<00:04:37.120> you<00:04:37.240> to<00:04:37.300> stop<00:04:41.460> right<00:04:42.460> there

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:42.700 
till I tell you to stop right there

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:45.270 
till I tell you to stop right there
alright<00:04:43.600> so<00:04:43.840> that<00:04:44.020> probably<00:04:44.710> puts<00:04:44.890> about<00:04:45.040> as

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 
alright so that probably puts about as

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:46.920 
alright so that probably puts about as
much<00:04:45.400> fuel<00:04:45.760> in<00:04:45.940> it<00:04:46.030> is<00:04:46.180> if<00:04:46.330> you<00:04:46.420> just<00:04:46.600> shut<00:04:46.780> them

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:46.930 
much fuel in it is if you just shut them

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:49.200 
much fuel in it is if you just shut them
down<00:04:47.140> and<00:04:47.220> you're<00:04:48.220> normally<00:04:48.670> going<00:04:48.730> to<00:04:48.910> do<00:04:49.030> it

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.210 
down and you're normally going to do it

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:56.640 
down and you're normally going to do it
but<00:04:53.760> we'll<00:04:54.760> run<00:04:55.060> through<00:04:55.300> it<00:04:55.620> run<00:04:56.620> a

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:56.650 
but we'll run through it run a

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:58.260 
but we'll run through it run a
compression<00:04:57.070> check<00:04:57.400> and<00:04:57.610> I<00:04:57.669> expect<00:04:58.090> it<00:04:58.240> to

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:58.270 
compression check and I expect it to

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:00.300 
compression check and I expect it to
fade<00:04:58.570> off<00:04:58.870> from<00:04:59.230> good<00:04:59.530> compression<00:04:59.860> on<00:05:00.160> this

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:00.310 
fade off from good compression on this

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:02.460 
fade off from good compression on this

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:02.470 
one to the last one not having that

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:07.290 
one to the last one not having that
graded<00:05:02.860> compression<00:05:03.870> oh<00:05:05.940> please

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:07.300 
graded compression oh please

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.409 
graded compression oh please
and<00:05:08.020> as<00:05:08.230> you<00:05:08.350> can<00:05:08.470> see<00:05:08.680> on<00:05:08.860> it<00:05:09.070> we<00:05:09.190> only<00:05:09.340> got<00:05:09.520> 145

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:10.419 
and as you can see on it we only got 145

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:14.250 
and as you can see on it we only got 145
pounds<00:05:10.780> of<00:05:10.870> compression<00:05:12.630> now<00:05:13.630> don't<00:05:13.960> ever

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:14.260 
pounds of compression now don't ever

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.400 
pounds of compression now don't ever
ever<00:05:14.650> put<00:05:15.160> few<00:05:15.610> oil<00:05:15.910> in<00:05:16.390> the<00:05:16.570> cylinders<00:05:17.080> just

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:17.410 
ever put few oil in the cylinders just

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:19.680 
ever put few oil in the cylinders just
if<00:05:17.530> that<00:05:17.710> is<00:05:17.830> a<00:05:17.860> no-no<00:05:18.430> that<00:05:19.270> doesn't<00:05:19.600> do

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:19.690 
if that is a no-no that doesn't do

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:22.170 
if that is a no-no that doesn't do
anything<00:05:19.960> for<00:05:20.380> you<00:05:20.620> doesn't<00:05:21.220> you<00:05:21.430> that's<00:05:22.060> a

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:22.180 
anything for you doesn't you that's a

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:24.170 
anything for you doesn't you that's a
trick<00:05:22.510> that<00:05:22.540> car<00:05:23.050> Lots<00:05:23.380> came<00:05:23.680> up<00:05:23.860> with

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:24.180 
trick that car Lots came up with

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:26.450 
trick that car Lots came up with
years<00:05:24.300> ago<00:05:24.419> if<00:05:25.259> I<00:05:25.440> had<00:05:25.680> this<00:05:25.830> thing<00:05:26.070> and<00:05:26.400> I

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:26.460 
years ago if I had this thing and I

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.279 
years ago if I had this thing and I
jumped<00:05:26.820> in<00:05:26.940> some<00:05:27.120> oil<00:05:27.270> in<00:05:27.509> the<00:05:27.630> cylinders<00:05:28.139> it

00:05:28.279 --> 00:05:28.289 
jumped in some oil in the cylinders it

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:30.200 
jumped in some oil in the cylinders it
will<00:05:28.380> show<00:05:28.560> me<00:05:28.590> a<00:05:28.740> compression<00:05:29.130> rating<00:05:29.669> it<00:05:30.060> has

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:30.210 
will show me a compression rating it has

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:37.510 
will show me a compression rating it has
nothing<00:05:30.630> to<00:05:30.660> do<00:05:30.870> with<00:05:30.960> anything

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:37.520 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.950 

okay<00:05:38.520> let's<00:05:38.699> try<00:05:38.820> that<00:05:38.910> one<00:05:39.150> more<00:05:39.180> time<00:05:39.360> go

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:39.960 
okay let's try that one more time go

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:43.029 
okay let's try that one more time go
ahead<00:05:40.139> and<00:05:40.229> crank<00:05:40.380> it<00:05:40.560> over

00:05:43.029 --> 00:05:43.039 

00:05:43.039 --> 00:05:46.159 

that's<00:05:44.039> plenty<00:05:44.430> good<00:05:44.759> and<00:05:45.300> you<00:05:45.840> can<00:05:45.930> see<00:05:46.050> where

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:46.169 
that's plenty good and you can see where

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:52.969 
that's plenty good and you can see where
150<00:05:46.889> pounds<00:05:48.949> and<00:05:51.080> we'll<00:05:52.080> do<00:05:52.199> the<00:05:52.320> last<00:05:52.500> one<00:05:52.710> and

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:52.979 
150 pounds and we'll do the last one and

00:05:52.979 --> 00:06:01.009 
150 pounds and we'll do the last one and
it'll<00:05:53.130> be<00:05:53.250> 150<00:05:53.789> pounds<00:05:54.120> or<00:05:54.210> less

00:06:01.009 --> 00:06:01.019 

00:06:01.019 --> 00:06:08.399 

but<00:06:02.019> crank<00:06:02.409> it<00:06:02.529> over<00:06:05.939> and<00:06:06.939> forever<00:06:07.719> there<00:06:08.109> 50

00:06:08.399 --> 00:06:08.409 
but crank it over and forever there 50

00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:11.369 
but crank it over and forever there 50
bones<00:06:09.389> and<00:06:10.389> the<00:06:10.509> longer<00:06:10.839> you<00:06:10.959> do<00:06:11.109> it<00:06:11.139> the<00:06:11.259> more

00:06:11.369 --> 00:06:11.379 
bones and the longer you do it the more

00:06:11.379 --> 00:06:13.109 
bones and the longer you do it the more
to<00:06:11.679> wash<00:06:11.829> out<00:06:12.099> if<00:06:12.249> we<00:06:12.339> go<00:06:12.459> back<00:06:12.639> and<00:06:12.879> do<00:06:12.969> the

00:06:13.109 --> 00:06:13.119 
to wash out if we go back and do the

00:06:13.119 --> 00:06:14.639 
to wash out if we go back and do the
number<00:06:13.449> one<00:06:13.599> cylinder<00:06:13.899> getting<00:06:14.259> to<00:06:14.349> five<00:06:14.499> me

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:14.649 
number one cylinder getting to five me

00:06:14.649 --> 00:06:22.079 
number one cylinder getting to five me
down<00:06:14.769> 130<00:06:15.309> 525<00:06:16.299> pounds<00:06:17.009> and<00:06:19.409> that<00:06:20.409> is<00:06:20.679> a<00:06:21.089> reason

00:06:22.079 --> 00:06:22.089 
down 130 525 pounds and that is a reason

00:06:22.089 --> 00:06:23.729 
down 130 525 pounds and that is a reason
that<00:06:22.209> you<00:06:22.359> don't<00:06:22.749> do<00:06:22.989> a<00:06:23.019> compression<00:06:23.379> check

00:06:23.729 --> 00:06:23.739 
that you don't do a compression check

00:06:23.739 --> 00:06:26.569 
that you don't do a compression check
with<00:06:23.919> the<00:06:24.039> injector<00:06:24.399> harness<00:06:24.849> plugged<00:06:25.089> in<00:06:25.299> and

00:06:26.569 --> 00:06:26.579 
with the injector harness plugged in and

00:06:26.579 --> 00:06:30.209 
with the injector harness plugged in and
the<00:06:27.989> and<00:06:28.989> that'll<00:06:29.259> give<00:06:29.379> you<00:06:29.469> real<00:06:29.679> numbers<00:06:30.069> on

00:06:30.209 --> 00:06:30.219 
the and that'll give you real numbers on

00:06:30.219 --> 00:06:31.979 
the and that'll give you real numbers on
your<00:06:30.369> engine<00:06:30.759> body<00:06:31.239> you<00:06:31.419> guys<00:06:31.539> are<00:06:31.689> doing<00:06:31.869> from

00:06:31.979 --> 00:06:31.989 
your engine body you guys are doing from

00:06:31.989 --> 00:06:33.209 
your engine body you guys are doing from
pressure<00:06:32.229> checking<00:06:32.649> just<00:06:32.679> simply<00:06:33.099> not

00:06:33.209 --> 00:06:33.219 
pressure checking just simply not

00:06:33.219 --> 00:06:35.639 
pressure checking just simply not
getting<00:06:33.489> the<00:06:33.579> right<00:06:33.759> numbers<00:06:34.179> and<00:06:34.499> some<00:06:35.499> of

00:06:35.639 --> 00:06:35.649 
getting the right numbers and some of

00:06:35.649 --> 00:06:36.779 
getting the right numbers and some of
you<00:06:35.739> are<00:06:35.829> going<00:06:36.009> through<00:06:36.129> the<00:06:36.249> motors<00:06:36.610> and

00:06:36.779 --> 00:06:36.789 
you are going through the motors and

00:06:36.789 --> 00:06:38.069 
you are going through the motors and
can't<00:06:37.209> figure<00:06:37.360> out<00:06:37.479> why<00:06:37.629> you<00:06:37.689> can't<00:06:37.899> get<00:06:37.989> the

00:06:38.069 --> 00:06:38.079 
can't figure out why you can't get the

00:06:38.079 --> 00:06:40.139 
can't figure out why you can't get the
compression<00:06:38.499> to<00:06:38.619> come<00:06:38.769> up<00:06:38.949> and<00:06:39.099> really<00:06:39.849> it's

00:06:40.139 --> 00:06:40.149 
compression to come up and really it's

00:06:40.149 --> 00:06:41.789 
compression to come up and really it's
just<00:06:40.209> you<00:06:40.689> already<00:06:41.019> had<00:06:41.139> the<00:06:41.289> compression

00:06:41.789 --> 00:06:41.799 
just you already had the compression

00:06:41.799 --> 00:06:44.189 
just you already had the compression
before<00:06:42.099> you<00:06:42.189> read<00:06:42.579> it<00:06:42.729> the<00:06:42.849> motor<00:06:43.059> I<00:06:43.419> hope<00:06:44.019> that

00:06:44.189 --> 00:06:44.199 
before you read it the motor I hope that

00:06:44.199 --> 00:06:46.559 
before you read it the motor I hope that
helps<00:06:44.469> out<00:06:44.679> and<00:06:44.979> remember<00:06:45.759> don't<00:06:46.149> dump<00:06:46.389> any

00:06:46.559 --> 00:06:46.569 
helps out and remember don't dump any

00:06:46.569 --> 00:06:48.659 
helps out and remember don't dump any
oil<00:06:46.809> in<00:06:46.959> the<00:06:47.079> cylinders<00:06:47.559> ever<00:06:47.829> to<00:06:48.189> check<00:06:48.429> it

00:06:48.659 --> 00:06:48.669 
oil in the cylinders ever to check it

00:06:48.669 --> 00:06:51.689 
oil in the cylinders ever to check it
and<00:06:49.659> when<00:06:50.049> you<00:06:50.139> check<00:06:50.349> it<00:06:50.589> it's<00:06:51.069> always<00:06:51.249> dry

00:06:51.689 --> 00:06:51.699 
and when you check it it's always dry

00:06:51.699 --> 00:06:54.929 
and when you check it it's always dry
it's<00:06:52.029> always<00:06:52.239> with<00:06:52.360> the<00:06:52.479> injector<00:06:52.779> unplug<00:06:53.939> and

00:06:54.929 --> 00:06:54.939 
it's always with the injector unplug and

00:06:54.939 --> 00:06:58.229 
it's always with the injector unplug and
