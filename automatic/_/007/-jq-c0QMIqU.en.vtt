00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
there at the beginning but I think we

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.660

that we had something well yeah you've

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.390 
that we had something well yeah you've
dominated<00:03:09.450> here<00:03:09.599> I<00:03:09.660> mean<00:03:10.140> I<00:03:10.230> hate<00:03:10.560> to<00:03:10.920> use<00:03:11.160> the

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
dominated here I mean I hate to use the

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.009 
dominated here I mean I hate to use the
word<00:03:11.430> but<00:03:11.700> yeah<00:03:11.819> you've<00:03:12.030> dominated<00:03:12.780> for<00:03:12.930> the

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
word but yeah you've dominated for the

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:15.020 
word but yeah you've dominated for the
most<00:03:13.230> part<00:03:13.560> and<00:03:13.859> like<00:03:14.670> I<00:03:14.700> said<00:03:14.849> they're

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
most part and like I said they're

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.690

catching<00:03:15.269> up<00:03:15.390> to<00:03:15.540> you<00:03:15.660> yeah<00:03:16.379> no<00:03:16.980> one<00:03:17.160> relaxed

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
catching up to you yeah no one relaxed

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.729 
catching up to you yeah no one relaxed
over<00:03:18.000> the<00:03:18.120> winter<00:03:18.480> and<00:03:18.780> we<00:03:19.200> didn't<00:03:19.440> do<00:03:19.530> too

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
over the winter and we didn't do too

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:21.050 
over the winter and we didn't do too
much<00:03:19.769> because<00:03:20.190> we<00:03:20.370> thought<00:03:20.579> we<00:03:20.760> were<00:03:20.819> in<00:03:20.909> good

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
much because we thought we were in good

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.210 
much because we thought we were in good
shape<00:03:21.120> but<00:03:21.720> everyone<00:03:22.440> stepped<00:03:22.799> it<00:03:22.920> up<00:03:23.010> a<00:03:23.190> notch

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
shape but everyone stepped it up a notch

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.420 
shape but everyone stepped it up a notch
so<00:03:23.400> I<00:03:23.670> guess<00:03:23.849> that's<00:03:24.090> just<00:03:24.390> opening<00:03:24.900> up<00:03:25.019> the

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
so I guess that's just opening up the

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.250 
so I guess that's just opening up the
tables<00:03:26.430> to<00:03:26.670> go<00:03:26.849> a<00:03:26.879> little<00:03:27.030> faster<00:03:27.390> and<00:03:28.019> try<00:03:28.200> to

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
tables to go a little faster and try to

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.430 
tables to go a little faster and try to
get<00:03:28.530> a<00:03:28.799> step<00:03:29.340> ahead<00:03:29.489> again<00:03:29.940> the<00:03:30.780> top<00:03:30.989> five<00:03:31.260> in
