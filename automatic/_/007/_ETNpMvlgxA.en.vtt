this is more than just that so let's uh
open<00:01:08.189> up<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.340> walls<00:01:08.490> and<00:01:08.790> see<00:01:09.119> how<00:01:09.270> I<00:01:09.299> did<00:01:09.450> the

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
open up the walls and see how I did the

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.440 
open up the walls and see how I did the
the<00:01:10.200> wiring<00:01:10.560> for<00:01:10.740> this<00:01:10.830> room<00:01:11.060> as<00:01:12.060> you<00:01:12.210> can<00:01:12.270> see

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
the wiring for this room as you can see

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.780 
the wiring for this room as you can see
through<00:01:12.659> here<00:01:13.610> this<00:01:14.610> wire<00:01:14.880> here<00:01:14.909> is<00:01:15.390> the

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:16.790 
through here this wire here is the

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:21.560 
through here this wire here is the
redstone<00:01:17.790> wire<00:01:17.939> for<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.180> door<00:01:18.420> I<00:01:20.299> throat<00:01:21.299> or

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
redstone wire for the door I throat or

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.770 
redstone wire for the door I throat or
connector<00:01:21.900> and<00:01:23.000> that<00:01:24.000> right<00:01:24.299> there<00:01:24.330> is<00:01:24.659> a

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
connector and that right there is a

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.740 
connector and that right there is a
redstone<00:01:25.170> torch<00:01:25.290> that<00:01:25.860> sits<00:01:26.400> at<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.030> back

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
redstone torch that sits at the back

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.950 
redstone torch that sits at the back
side<00:01:28.170> of<00:01:28.200> that<00:01:28.560> block<00:01:29.070> and<00:01:29.460> so<00:01:30.450> when<00:01:30.869> the

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
side of that block and so when the

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.550 
side of that block and so when the
person<00:01:31.320> knocks<00:01:31.560> out<00:01:31.770> that<00:01:31.950> block<00:01:32.189> it<00:01:32.520> d<00:01:33.030> powers

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
person knocks out that block it d powers

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.679 
person knocks out that block it d powers
both<00:01:34.560> of<00:01:34.740> these<00:01:34.829> circuits<00:01:35.280> so<00:01:36.150> for<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.420> door

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
both of these circuits so for the door

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.219 
both of these circuits so for the door
there's<00:01:37.650> two<00:01:38.009> inverters<00:01:38.400> and<00:01:38.790> so<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:39.900> powered

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
there's two inverters and so the powered

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.990 
there's two inverters and so the powered
door<00:01:40.439> which<00:01:40.710> is<00:01:40.829> holding<00:01:41.100> an<00:01:41.220> open<00:01:41.460> closes

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
door which is holding an open closes

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.880 
door which is holding an open closes
it's<00:01:42.540> an<00:01:42.600> iron<00:01:42.810> door<00:01:42.990> so<00:01:43.229> to<00:01:43.259> pain<00:01:43.560> in<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.740> ass

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
it's an iron door so to pain in the ass

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.410 
it's an iron door so to pain in the ass
to<00:01:43.920> close<00:01:44.720> with<00:01:45.720> count<00:01:46.020> dying<00:01:46.290> somewhere<00:01:47.420> down

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
to close with count dying somewhere down

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.580 
to close with count dying somewhere down
of<00:01:48.540> the<00:01:48.600> lava<00:01:48.780> cow<00:01:50.180> all<00:01:51.180> right<00:01:51.329> and<00:01:51.479> up<00:01:52.170> here

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
of the lava cow all right and up here

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.550 
of the lava cow all right and up here
there's<00:01:53.579> also<00:01:53.820> a<00:01:54.000> ladder<00:01:54.960> thing<00:01:55.229> up<00:01:55.320> here<00:01:55.470> to

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
there's also a ladder thing up here to

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.319 
there's also a ladder thing up here to
get<00:01:55.649> lights<00:01:55.890> the<00:01:56.100> dynamite<00:01:58.909> we<00:01:59.909> go<00:02:00.060> that's

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
get lights the dynamite we go that's

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.950 
get lights the dynamite we go that's
only<00:02:00.479> two<00:02:00.689> sticks<00:02:00.990> of<00:02:01.079> dynamite<00:02:01.439> I<00:02:01.619> found<00:02:02.430> that

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
only two sticks of dynamite I found that

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.990 
only two sticks of dynamite I found that
much<00:02:03.960> more<00:02:04.380> actually<00:02:04.860> kills<00:02:05.159> the<00:02:05.369> person<00:02:05.520> with

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
much more actually kills the person with

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.589 
much more actually kills the person with
just<00:02:06.210> the<00:02:06.390> dynamite<00:02:07.489> which<00:02:08.489> is<00:02:08.910> not<00:02:09.270> quite

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
just the dynamite which is not quite

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.390 
just the dynamite which is not quite
what<00:02:09.660> I'm<00:02:09.959> wanting<00:02:10.170> to<00:02:10.440> do

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
what I'm wanting to do

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.680 
what I'm wanting to do
above<00:02:12.400> here<00:02:12.580> you<00:02:12.670> can<00:02:12.790> see<00:02:12.909> the<00:02:12.940> lava<00:02:13.239> and

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
above here you can see the lava and

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.509 
above here you can see the lava and
there's<00:02:14.349> some<00:02:14.560> glass<00:02:14.860> here<00:02:15.099> so<00:02:15.250> it<00:02:15.370> breaks

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:15.519 
there's some glass here so it breaks

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:17.670 
there's some glass here so it breaks
really<00:02:15.879> easily<00:02:16.030> almost<00:02:16.840> all<00:02:16.989> through<00:02:17.200> all<00:02:17.470> the

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
really easily almost all through all the

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.229 
really easily almost all through all the
glass<00:02:17.860> breaks<00:02:18.159> pretty<00:02:18.700> much<00:02:18.819> every<00:02:19.000> time

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
glass breaks pretty much every time

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:21.270 
glass breaks pretty much every time
except<00:02:20.230> for<00:02:20.379> maybe<00:02:20.470> a<00:02:20.590> couple<00:02:20.620> pieces<00:02:20.980> over

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
except for maybe a couple pieces over

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.430 
except for maybe a couple pieces over
here<00:02:22.019> and<00:02:23.019> if<00:02:23.950> you<00:02:24.040> can<00:02:24.220> see<00:02:24.610> from<00:02:24.819> this<00:02:25.030> angle

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
here and if you can see from this angle

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.220 
here and if you can see from this angle
there's<00:02:26.440> actually<00:02:27.040> a<00:02:27.310> kind<00:02:28.239> of<00:02:28.360> like<00:02:28.510> a<00:02:28.599> ring

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
there's actually a kind of like a ring

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.030 
there's actually a kind of like a ring
of<00:02:29.560> glass<00:02:29.980> that<00:02:31.230> that<00:02:32.230> way<00:02:32.319> the<00:02:32.440> source<00:02:32.739> blocks

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
of glass that that way the source blocks

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.009 
of glass that that way the source blocks
of<00:02:33.190> love<00:02:33.370> is<00:02:33.610> sitting<00:02:33.940> on<00:02:34.000> top<00:02:34.060> of<00:02:34.299> this<00:02:34.569> this

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:37.140 
of love is sitting on top of this this
ring<00:02:35.290> of<00:02:35.440> glass<00:02:35.680> and<00:02:35.950> then<00:02:36.280> it's<00:02:36.430> coming<00:02:37.030> down

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
ring of glass and then it's coming down

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.319 
ring of glass and then it's coming down
here<00:02:37.360> as<00:02:37.480> a<00:02:37.780> lava<00:02:38.079> fall<00:02:38.410> and<00:02:38.769> then<00:02:39.730> there's<00:02:39.940> two

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:40.329 
here as a lava fall and then there's two

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:43.770 
here as a lava fall and then there's two
more<00:02:40.650> columns<00:02:41.650> here<00:02:41.769> I<00:02:41.829> think<00:02:42.010> it's<00:02:42.129> the<00:02:42.780> arena

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
more columns here I think it's the arena

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.050 
more columns here I think it's the arena
glasses<00:02:44.230> three<00:02:44.500> high<00:02:44.680> and<00:02:44.890> the<00:02:45.670> reason<00:02:46.030> for

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
glasses three high and the reason for

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.140 
glasses three high and the reason for
that<00:02:46.269> is<00:02:46.660> I<00:02:46.720> found<00:02:47.260> that<00:02:47.610> TNT<00:02:48.610> will<00:02:48.760> actually

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
that is I found that TNT will actually

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.949 
that is I found that TNT will actually
destroy<00:02:49.480> lava<00:02:49.810> source<00:02:50.140> blocks<00:02:51.599> that<00:02:52.599> kind<00:02:52.840> of

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
destroy lava source blocks that kind of

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:54.900 
destroy lava source blocks that kind of
defeats<00:02:53.799> the<00:02:53.799> entire<00:02:53.980> purpose<00:02:54.250> of<00:02:54.579> the<00:02:54.670> trap

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
defeats the entire purpose of the trap

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.809 
defeats the entire purpose of the trap
that<00:02:55.150> happens<00:02:55.690> and<00:02:56.470> so<00:02:56.829> I<00:02:56.859> finally<00:02:57.609> got<00:02:57.700> to

00:02:57.809 --> 00:02:57.819 
that happens and so I finally got to

00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:59.670 
that happens and so I finally got to
lift<00:02:57.970> up<00:02:58.120> the<00:02:58.239> lava<00:02:58.420> source<00:02:58.690> blocks<00:02:58.930> a<00:02:59.019> bit<00:02:59.200> to

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
lift up the lava source blocks a bit to

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.860 
lift up the lava source blocks a bit to
get<00:02:59.769> it<00:02:59.829> out<00:02:59.950> of<00:03:00.010> the<00:03:00.099> way<00:03:00.540> this<00:03:01.540> works<00:03:01.750> out

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
get it out of the way this works out

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:03.780 
get it out of the way this works out
pretty<00:03:01.989> well<00:03:02.140> I<00:03:02.500> kind<00:03:03.190> of<00:03:03.220> downside<00:03:03.579> is<00:03:03.700> it

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
pretty well I kind of downside is it

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.369 
pretty well I kind of downside is it
takes<00:03:03.970> such<00:03:04.180> a<00:03:04.209> long<00:03:04.420> time<00:03:04.660> that<00:03:04.720> the<00:03:05.230> lava

00:03:05.369 --> 00:03:05.379 
takes such a long time that the lava

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:07.949 
takes such a long time that the lava
flows<00:03:05.739> is<00:03:05.950> to<00:03:06.160> get<00:03:06.310> to<00:03:06.430> the<00:03:06.549> bottom<00:03:06.959> you

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
flows is to get to the bottom you

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:09.780 
flows is to get to the bottom you
probably<00:03:08.349> solve<00:03:08.920> that<00:03:09.129> by<00:03:09.190> bringing<00:03:09.400> this

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
probably solve that by bringing this

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.009 
probably solve that by bringing this
class<00:03:10.060> ceiling<00:03:10.629> down<00:03:11.079> to<00:03:11.470> maybe<00:03:12.129> this<00:03:12.430> level

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
class ceiling down to maybe this level

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:17.069 
class ceiling down to maybe this level
and<00:03:14.019> I<00:03:14.140> might<00:03:14.319> help<00:03:14.440> a<00:03:14.560> bit<00:03:15.150> I<00:03:16.150> might<00:03:16.930> try<00:03:17.049> that

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:17.079 
and I might help a bit I might try that

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:21.300 
and I might help a bit I might try that
at<00:03:17.290> some<00:03:17.410> point<00:03:17.440> I<00:03:17.650> just<00:03:17.680> didn't<00:03:18.220> do<00:03:18.280> it<00:03:20.220> so<00:03:21.220> if

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
at some point I just didn't do it so if

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:23.069 
at some point I just didn't do it so if
you<00:03:21.430> want<00:03:21.579> to<00:03:21.639> see<00:03:21.880> how<00:03:22.060> this<00:03:22.239> goes<00:03:22.480> I<00:03:22.810> have<00:03:22.989> it

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:23.079 
you want to see how this goes I have it

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:25.589 
you want to see how this goes I have it
up<00:03:23.169> put<00:03:23.440> a<00:03:23.470> button<00:03:23.709> there<00:03:23.980> for<00:03:24.599> testing

00:03:25.589 --> 00:03:25.599 
up put a button there for testing

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:29.280 
up put a button there for testing
purposes<00:03:26.880> but<00:03:27.880> let's<00:03:28.060> uh<00:03:28.239> let's<00:03:28.389> go<00:03:28.630> upstairs

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
purposes but let's uh let's go upstairs

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.930 
purposes but let's uh let's go upstairs
and<00:03:30.450> take<00:03:31.450> a<00:03:31.510> look<00:03:31.870> at<00:03:32.049> the<00:03:32.470> mechanics<00:03:33.130> take<00:03:33.880> a

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
and take a look at the mechanics take a

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.170 
and take a look at the mechanics take a
look<00:03:34.030> with<00:03:34.180> you<00:03:34.329> what<00:03:34.930> it<00:03:34.989> looks<00:03:35.019> like<00:03:35.169> above

or stairway mothers but they also say
well<00:03:51.600> they<00:03:51.720> did<00:03:51.840> the<00:03:51.930> farm<00:03:52.230> on<00:03:52.380> and<00:03:52.710> then<00:03:53.610> a

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
well they did the farm on and then a

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:58.280 
well they did the farm on and then a
trap<00:03:53.940> on<00:03:54.530> my<00:03:55.530> cheating<00:03:55.890> world<00:03:57.170> alright<00:03:58.170> so

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
trap on my cheating world alright so

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:14.070 
is a interesting centerpiece of some

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:20.390 
is a interesting centerpiece of some
kind<00:04:15.110> it's<00:04:16.110> artwork<00:04:16.530> I<00:04:16.680> swear<00:04:19.220> well<00:04:20.220> it's

end with a bang let's go set this off
again<00:04:41.630> haha<00:04:42.630> wrong<00:04:42.840> door<00:04:43.610> alright<00:04:44.610> so<00:04:44.760> there's

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:44.940 
again haha wrong door alright so there's

again haha wrong door alright so there's
the<00:04:45.030> door<00:04:48.290> and<00:04:50.600> this<00:04:51.600> time<00:04:51.780> we'll<00:04:51.900> go<00:04:51.990> up<00:04:52.020> top

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380 
the door and this time we'll go up top

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:58.550 
the door and this time we'll go up top
and<00:04:52.650> watch<00:04:52.830> it<00:04:52.980> go<00:04:53.100> off<00:04:54.860> alright<00:04:57.380> so<00:04:58.380> this

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560 
and watch it go off alright so this

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.490 
and watch it go off alright so this
won't<00:04:58.680> close<00:04:58.860> the<00:04:59.040> door<00:04:59.220> but<00:04:59.430> that's<00:04:59.580> okay

won't close the door but that's okay
there's<00:05:01.500> the<00:05:01.590> TNT<00:05:02.210> and<00:05:03.210> back<00:05:03.420> a<00:05:03.450> little<00:05:03.630> bit

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:04.460 
there's the TNT and back a little bit

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:10.040 
there's the TNT and back a little bit
and<00:05:05.570> then<00:05:06.570> got<00:05:07.440> all<00:05:07.560> the<00:05:07.650> glass<00:05:08.510> and<00:05:09.510> this<00:05:09.960> is

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:10.050 
and then got all the glass and this is

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:24.020
