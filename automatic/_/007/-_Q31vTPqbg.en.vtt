Hey folks it is Barry here welcome to myvirginkitchen,
today we are making some mind blowing stonking

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:17.850
gorgeous pulled pork quesadilla I have had
4 of these already they are so so good.

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.840
We are achieving lazy again with our pulled
pork playlist this is using the pulled pork

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.020
leftovers from our perfect pulled pork video
if you did not see that one that is the main

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:32.829
video to check out so hit the button up there
and that will take you to it, it is so so

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:38.309
good and by slow cooking our pork shoulder
like we did it is so easy to chuck this together

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.109
guys as you will find out now!

00:00:40.109 --> 00:00:44.289
So If you have not done the pork yet and it
is so easy hit the button up there and check

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:48.659
out the main pulled pork video or there is
more pulled pork inspiration on there I will

00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:50.190
be adding throughout this Month.

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.360
If you are ready and have the pulled pork
ready like I have hit pause on the video now

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:59.600
*clicks fingers*, write all of the ingredients
down oh it is so good I am excited I do not

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.149
know why I am excited I have eaten for of
them but they are good trust me.

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.930
So we will to start with getting our tortillas
and smothering over a couple of tablespoons

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.550
of salsa, barbecue sauce would also work well
but I was in a salsa kind of mood so get all

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:13.010
nice and spread out.

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:16.650
With that done it is now a case of adding
the toppings of your choice so of course down

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.840
goes our delicious pulled pork which was made
with a paprika dry rub in our previous video

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.220
this has simply been stored in a sealed container
in the fridge, then I added some chopped spring

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:35.160
onion, some peppers a nice mixture there of
yellow and orange ones a handful of grated

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:36.160
cheese.

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.550
Make sure they are level before topping with
another tortilla.

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:44.300
Get your hob onto a medium flame, place your
pan on top, brush your pan with a little bit

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:51.760
of oil and once warm cook for around 3 or
4 minutes either side to melt the cheese and

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:55.870
toast the outside of the tortilla, press down
for even cooking if you need to.

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:00.570
In terms of flipping it I passed mine onto
a plate another plate the same size on top

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:06.580
flipped it over so you can see the toasted
side and simply returned to the pan and cooked

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.000
for 2 minutes more again to toast the outside.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.500
Simply remove from the pan and cut into wedges
with a knife serving almost immediately.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.069
The smells of the warmed tortilla with the
pork is fantastic, such a delicious, easy

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:23.950
treat and the taste of the pulled pork at
the heart of them makes it a real winner perfect

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.250
for using up those pork leftovers.

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.180
Remember of course the flavours can be tweaked
depending on the rubs used and the topping

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.180
in the tortilla.

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.260
Oh my goodness guys they keep looking at me
I must put them down, I hope I have got across

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.220
to you how good these are they are mind blowingly
good.

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.980
Remember our pulled pork was made with pork
shoulder if you are buying from the supermarket

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.400

pulled pork you will just get the most amazing

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.400
