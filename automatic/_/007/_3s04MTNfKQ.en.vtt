one<00:05:47.889> thing<00:05:48.160> I<00:05:48.280> particularly<00:05:48.700> like<00:05:49.060> about<00:05:49.090> the

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:49.450 
one thing I particularly like about the

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:51.360 
one thing I particularly like about the
arcade<00:05:49.870> mode<00:05:50.110> is<00:05:50.320> that<00:05:50.530> when<00:05:50.889> you<00:05:50.979> get<00:05:51.130> to<00:05:51.250> the

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:51.370 
arcade mode is that when you get to the

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:53.610 
arcade mode is that when you get to the
character<00:05:51.760> you're<00:05:51.940> playing<00:05:52.180> as<00:05:52.570> Eggman<00:05:53.349> shows

up<00:05:53.830> and<00:05:54.010> clones<00:05:54.310> you<00:05:54.490> trying<00:05:55.090> to<00:05:55.150> explain<00:05:55.510> how

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:55.720 
up and clones you trying to explain how

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:57.000

it's<00:05:55.870> possible<00:05:56.020> for<00:05:56.470> two<00:05:56.620> of<00:05:56.710> the<00:05:56.800> same

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:57.010 
it's possible for two of the same

laziness on the developers part makes me

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:03.360 
laziness on the developers part makes me
wonder<00:06:01.810> why<00:06:02.020> Eggman<00:06:02.320> never<00:06:02.530> did<00:06:02.680> this<00:06:02.800> before

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:03.370
