00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:14.380
 hello here is such a high energy me 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:18.160
 I was just doing a product test 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:21.160
 straight in my office and is often ten 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:24.820
 hours a day computer and I come out 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:28.090
 I still have nordic walking here 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:28.630
 is it I never liked so well 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:32.140
 to get 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:34.149
 and now I have a trampoline today 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:37.690
 bought a mini trampoline only has 

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:40.510
 16 40 euros cost between 40 and 50 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:43.449
 is synonymous to tight I find quite 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:45.909
 they are practically wineable 

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:48.069
 Again, I do not use somewhere 

00:00:45.909 --> 00:00:51.940
 in the area room does not have 

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:56.649
 fold up and lay the bed and 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:58.600
 yes that has bounce the advantage that 

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:00.129
 he will not markus red either 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.280
 meaningful and by many people the 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:05.649
 stop cancer therapies 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:09.340
 Not only do we have blood in the body of two, too 

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:11.530
 the lymphatic system, the liquid that 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.329
 Little body flows and where many 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:17.560
 is there are materials like clear here 

00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:19.359
 in my fed which and all that 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.490
 saved it works hall 

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:23.530
 not so good with the last ten kilos 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:26.380
 Slimming is here I have to do as and 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.859
 I have this time to spend an hour too 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.810
 go 

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:32.530
 that's why five times every now and then 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:34.119
 minutes in his film changed or 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:38.890
 if I had recalls, he also 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:40.920
 Something like that I have here around and 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.360
 tried a quarter of an hour during the day 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.820
 20 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.320
 to move me and that's for 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.740
 better than nothing moving 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.930
 and yes I can recommend it costs a lot 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.880
 money and the thing is likely 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.840
 just like this composer as well 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.700
 this sandwich maker 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.790
 that was a make quite a again 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:02.070
 in the recycling yard but if you are 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.020
 Something buys that really where 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.840
 It sees every day where your work tells 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:10.700
 Come along and use that too 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.700
 I guaranteed so it was
