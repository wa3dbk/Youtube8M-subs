00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.030
 good lights of the day make me more steering 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.220
 Vyacheslav 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.849
 and today we will talk on training 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:11.730
 I prepared the backs 

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:13.889
 exercise it is specific of course 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.990
 brood on many times can see it and 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.140
 but we carried it a little bit better 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:22.619
 let's sort it out our element it was looking for what 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.119
 variable type of pull-ups is called 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.400
 he is a typewriter 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.349
 that is, now I will demonstrate how he 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.840
 performed and I will quietly you 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:34.189
 telling how to learn which muscles 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.189
 here we have a little bit later 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:55.950
 here is this element 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:59.730
 forgiveness is better than you say we 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:01.800
 now tell s-3ro this is not only in 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.530
 back also trains hands and 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.830
 forearm when you do exercise 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.810
 on the street can be much more convenient and this 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.660
 it will be much more correct to be considered when 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.830
 you will do with a corner that is but 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:16.350
 the wall did not interfere here 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.930
 so I make her name so she will 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.520
 unlock and brest 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:23.550
 what I want to say about this exercise is it 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.070
 train your back even static and 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:27.470
 in a dynamic way 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:30.539
 static he trains what you 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:34.130
 hang taut what you have 

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:36.570
 always muscles are in tension and 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:39.080
 dynamic what are you doing transition 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:43.880
 that is , it will work here 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:47.660
 some kind of bundles of some kind 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:50.520
 less muscle the broadest back muscles and 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:51.330
 their triceps and their 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.490
 biceps 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.830
 so feel when the ways are in the flesh 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.000
 of course you can exercise this with us 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.950
 what is looking who else 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.259
 but not strong enough for that 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:04.259
 exercises that I recommend doing 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:07.220
 I would recommend a good course to learn 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:09.899
 catch up but it's obvious and 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:12.150
 learn how to be about a minute 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:16.140
 hanging tight what can 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.620
 beret abandoned looked back and wie sie 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.980
 den 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.950
 just around the world when to go to one 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.459
 hands and tours 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:27.700
 turned back went down came back 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:31.230
 come down here and it will be 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:35.590
 develop and help you when learning 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:38.050
 of this exercise well, that's all that 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:40.810
 I wanted to sky in this little video tutorial 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:44.050
 I want to tell you something that will soon begin 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:46.209
 we already have a series of release and training and 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:48.250
 learning elements is what many 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:49.690
 reasoned asked so 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.379
 subscribe to the channel wait for new 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:53.769
 video 

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:56.200
 I think the next video lesson is very 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:58.420
 cool element that you probably still 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:01.000
 not seen may have seen but not seen 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:04.560
 trainers so wait subscribe to 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.560
