00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:13.650
 This exercise equipment is a micro-incline bench press. 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:14.549
 The flat bench presses the bench to perform the work on such a flat bench 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:19.680
 It is. 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:23.400
 Between Incline bench press has an angle of approximately 25 degrees from the unchanging 45 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:27.839
 You're exercising on a bench with a scissor . 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:32.910
 The part of the ten used muscles that exercise on this bench is the thorny upper 

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:38.010
 Exercise can be a lot. The angle at this time is the most 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:43.260
 It was a central part of the upper part of the chest in Incline bench 3 goals in the chest 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:47.699
 It is important to place the bench in the lower part at this point 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:50.239
 And there is another important point to explain. 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:50.239
 Elbow 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:58.900
 At this angle when the fluid is in the chest 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:01:00.310
 Hold the pressure firmly. When the elbow goes up, the shoulder joint 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:06.220
 The crowd may come 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:09.580
 And when the elbow is too directed downwards, 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:13.300
 You will have to be careful because it becomes the Triesps movement. 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:16.150
 When you raise it too much, you may feel discomfort in the shoulder area. 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:20.770
 If you feel like it, I'd better lower it a little. 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:24.820
 I do not have any stimulation on my chest muscles . 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:30.220
 Since viable'll have a good range of appliances joints vary from person 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:33.580
 It is important to look for the range of motion of your joints 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:36.940
 I'm going to enter the incline bench press. 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:39.189
 Put it on an incline bench. 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:44.590
 Ass 

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:47.130
 Put it in deep, do not pull your waist too high. 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.130
 Dad 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:53.659
 After you grab it, wrap it in a circle. 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.659
 I raised it. 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:02:01.659
 In this case, 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:05.470
 Put your biceps on the top of your chest and push it. 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:10.000
 It is recommended that the operating range be as large as possible within the safe range 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:14.940
 The partial operation range allows for partial muscle growth and the complete home range is complete 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:20.010
 You have to think you can get muscle growth . Yandere. 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:24.769
 Oh, push it down. Come down again. 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.769
 Became rather I not see a good jusiguyo 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:35.670
 Please bring your elbows down when unloaded when'll 14th 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:40.099
 At the back of the arm rather than the heart 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.099
 The focus of the exercise will be metamorphosis . 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:46.650
 Oh , it's good to avoid posture. Let's go up the elbow too. 

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:46.650
 When 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:55.849
 So that the shoulder joints and ligaments can also be hurt, I think haejusimyeon this position 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:59.900
 Attend the form in the middle of the elbow to an appropriate level . 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:03:05.840
 Threw down toward your chest, then gave into the 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:08.319
 In the heart of the increasingly giving it threw down the form made haejusimyeon recommended 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.319
 stop 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:14.090
 This completes the incline bench press .
