 control does not have does not have a background is in 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:05.970
 the background totally round this in this 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:11.310
 redoubt any movement 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.310
 is very susceptible very susceptible 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.920
 Y 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:21.050
 Y 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.050
 i 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:36.540
 in times it is believed that they were the beginnings

 the first surfers 5,000 years of 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.550
 antiquity a 13 year old boy had to 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.790
 enter the sea and leave with that raft 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:47.310
 without getting wet and sincere caught by 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.980
 some wave happened that was for a 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.840
 kind of mistake then he this one 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:53.430
 caught a truth ball from a dome 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.470
 then this person that on the 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.480
 first totora horse felt that it was

 dream that flew that a pelican with the 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.350
 of a ball when he took this wave with 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:06.760
 the horse and totora 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.760
 and he feels like he's a pelican 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.080
 Y 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:15.690
 I was on my knees and he feels the 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:20.210
 need to stand up put one foot 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:22.820
 with the other and stopped when standing

 under the base and entered it on the wall 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:34.970
 of the wave inside the wall of the ball 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.280
 and he had so much joy that he closed the 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:43.480
 eyes and closed his eyes 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:43.480
 if I'm flying with love 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:49.530
