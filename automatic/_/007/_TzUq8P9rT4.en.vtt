00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 everyone loves to ride but did you know that 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.660
 imprint of the nose to something as unique 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.790
 like a person's fingerprint or what 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.800
 catnip is a real drug for 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.599
 cats one of the essential oils under 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.820
 the name did not feed who penetrates 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.619
 cat's nasal tissue and behaves like one 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.109
 from and watch Ramone data pheromone 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.369
 stimulates afferent neurons 

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:22.890
 affecting activity and sexual 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.510
 80 percent behavior which is what 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.880
 principle not bad because cats 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.039
 spends 85 percent of his time 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.349
 do nothing at all nutrition 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.960
 feces and even mating takes 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.820
 only 4 percent of their time but when how 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.890
 move they always land on 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.809
 legs it occurs due to reflex 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.210
 air straightening cats are very 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.040
 sensitive to gravity movement that 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.020
 allows them to quickly determine where 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.090
 there is a bottom and also they have a very 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.430
 flexible spine and so-called 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.350
 floating key and thanks to this they 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.449
 can easily roll over without changing 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.550
 your momentum moms and did you know 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.649
 what's up his tail when his 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.020
 stroking to give you sniff your ass 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.210
 to you use scent for communication and 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.549
 this behavior makes iron available 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.100
 emits pheromones with their personal smell 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.170
 good alternative handshake also 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.510
 they rub you to spread their 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.760
 pheromones gland on and chord tail and 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.299
 bodies help to there tag you with their 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.250
 the smell 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.229
 and also inform other cat magic 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.090
 personality readiness for reproduction and 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.979
 territories on the other hand as 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.750
 bury their feces trying 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.030
 mask your smell this evolutionary 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.100
 instinct helps not only to avoid 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.860
 predators on and shows that in the wild 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.150
 nature is not a step below 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.159
 dominant felines in the same way 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.170
 year expresses that recognizes it in 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.970
 dominant cats can not see in 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.310
 total darkness but they see much 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.259
 better than us in dim light when it has 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.180
 cell ball behind the retina called 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.220
 the bed corner chad representing of 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.200
 mirrors themselves reflecting additional 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.119
 light back to the retina twilight this 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.579
 gives their eyes another chance to collect 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.590
 more light on in complete darkness they all 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.750
 nor can we see anything 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.820
 if you ever see when in three 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.130
 different colors you can practically be 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.590
 confident that this is the most responsible gene 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.719
 for freshness and is located by vetch of chromosomes 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.009
 that means cats can have two 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.509
 colors in compounds 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.720
 sang because they have two 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:15.150
 x chromosomes on the other side of the y chromosome 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.220
 does not have genes responsible for color because 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.920
 this cats most often will only have 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:22.110
 one color paired with white which is interesting we 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.030
 still do not know why cats purr 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.920
 the fact is that they are silent not only from 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.670
 fun but also when it hurts or 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.040
 they are injured 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:31.019
 many believe that this is a way to express 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.299
 passivity or pleasure but one 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:34.500
 An interesting theory is that the frequency on 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:37.680
 which cats purr 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.750
 from 24 to 140 girls helps healthy 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.209
 bone growth and healing of damage 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.220
 perhaps this is a way to maintain muscle and 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:45.329
 guests healthy without large 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.370
 energy consumption 

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:49.920
