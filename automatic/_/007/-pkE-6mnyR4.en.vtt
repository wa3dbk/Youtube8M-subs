do much of what so so much hair I

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:52.820 
do much of what so so much hair I
haven't<00:02:51.750> rushed<00:02:51.930> it<00:02:52.080> through<00:02:52.110> since<00:02:52.680> I've

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
haven't rushed it through since I've

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.370 
haven't rushed it through since I've
combed<00:02:53.070> since<00:02:53.580> I've<00:02:53.760> them<00:02:53.940> dried<00:02:54.870> it<00:02:55.110> so<00:02:55.320> you

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
combed since I've them dried it so you

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.860 
combed since I've them dried it so you
can<00:02:55.770> see<00:02:55.980> how<00:02:56.190> aerated<00:02:56.970> it<00:02:57.120> is<00:02:57.240> the<00:02:57.510> difference

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
can see how aerated it is the difference

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.560 
can see how aerated it is the difference
between<00:02:58.020> this<00:02:58.290> and<00:02:58.350> normal<00:02:58.590> straightening<00:02:59.570> is

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
between this and normal straightening is

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.870 
between this and normal straightening is
that<00:03:00.990> it<00:03:01.140> got<00:03:01.350> the<00:03:01.410> air<00:03:01.680> within<00:03:01.980> it<00:03:02.310> it's<00:03:02.580> got

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
that it got the air within it it's got

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.080 
that it got the air within it it's got
the<00:03:03.480> flow<00:03:03.750> in<00:03:03.960> the<00:03:04.050> movement<00:03:04.970> it's<00:03:05.970> not

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
the flow in the movement it's not

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.000 
the flow in the movement it's not
completely<00:03:06.630> frizz<00:03:06.990> free<00:03:07.020> but<00:03:07.620> then<00:03:07.770> mine

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
completely frizz free but then mine

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.680 
completely frizz free but then mine
won't<00:03:08.250> be<00:03:08.430> because<00:03:08.640> I<00:03:08.820> don't<00:03:09.120> blow<00:03:09.390> dry<00:03:09.630> it

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
won't be because I don't blow dry it

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.240 
won't be because I don't blow dry it
with<00:03:09.810> the<00:03:09.900> nozzle<00:03:10.110> and<00:03:10.560> point<00:03:10.890> it<00:03:11.040> straight

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
with the nozzle and point it straight

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.180 
with the nozzle and point it straight
down<00:03:11.640> I<00:03:12.030> don't<00:03:12.660> have<00:03:12.900> the<00:03:13.110> hair<00:03:13.380> directly<00:03:14.010> on

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
down I don't have the hair directly on

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.640 
down I don't have the hair directly on
there<00:03:14.489> the<00:03:15.060> heat<00:03:15.300> rather<00:03:15.570> directly<00:03:16.200> on<00:03:16.470> the

that's too harsh I like to my hair to be

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.670 
that's too harsh I like to my hair to be
quite<00:03:35.760> flowing<00:03:36.330> and<00:03:36.630> quite<00:03:36.959> sort<00:03:37.290> of<00:03:37.410> I<00:03:37.560> do

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
quite flowing and quite sort of I do

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.170 
quite flowing and quite sort of I do
like<00:03:37.950> it<00:03:38.100> smooth<00:03:38.370> because<00:03:38.760> I<00:03:38.820> have<00:03:38.940> frizzy

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
like it smooth because I have frizzy

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.720 
like it smooth because I have frizzy
curly<00:03:39.269> hair<00:03:39.780> it's<00:03:39.959> really<00:03:40.260> nice<00:03:40.470> and<00:03:40.830> a<00:03:41.070> nice

pleasure<00:03:42.090> for<00:03:42.300> me<00:03:42.390> to<00:03:42.600> have<00:03:42.810> nice<00:03:43.200> smooth<00:03:43.560> hair

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:43.830 
pleasure for me to have nice smooth hair

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:45.550 
pleasure for me to have nice smooth hair
it<00:03:43.920> feels<00:03:43.980> really<00:03:44.370> smooth<00:03:44.700> to<00:03:44.940> to<00:03:45.300> touch

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
it feels really smooth to to touch

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.630 
it feels really smooth to to touch
obviously<00:03:46.560> I<00:03:46.590> could<00:03:46.739> run<00:03:46.920> some<00:03:47.130> more<00:03:47.160> serum

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
obviously I could run some more serum

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.310 
obviously I could run some more serum
through<00:03:47.850> this<00:03:48.060> and<00:03:48.269> make<00:03:48.390> it<00:03:48.420> more<00:03:48.750> smoother

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320 
through this and make it more smoother

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.020 
through this and make it more smoother
so<00:03:49.590> I<00:03:49.620> just<00:03:49.890> find<00:03:50.100> that<00:03:50.220> using<00:03:50.670> that<00:03:50.850> as

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
so I just find that using that as

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.890 
so I just find that using that as
opposed<00:03:51.330> to<00:03:51.360> a<00:03:51.600> normal<00:03:51.989> a<00:03:52.230> big<00:03:53.160> brush<00:03:53.900> like

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
opposed to a normal a big brush like

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.979 
opposed to a normal a big brush like
this<00:03:55.380> I<00:03:55.769> find<00:03:56.370> these<00:03:56.550> a<00:03:57.060> little<00:03:57.600> bit<00:03:57.690> too

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
this I find these a little bit too

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:00.860 
this I find these a little bit too
difficult<00:03:58.620> to<00:03:58.709> handle<00:03:58.860> I<00:03:59.459> get<00:04:00.269> my<00:04:00.420> hair<00:04:00.660> round

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
difficult to handle I get my hair round

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.620 
difficult to handle I get my hair round
it<00:04:01.200> and<00:04:01.470> get<00:04:01.860> the<00:04:01.980> care<00:04:02.160> properly<00:04:02.670> wound<00:04:03.239> round

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
it and get the care properly wound round

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.229 
it and get the care properly wound round
it<00:04:03.870> without<00:04:04.560> getting<00:04:04.950> all<00:04:05.100> in<00:04:05.430> a<00:04:05.760> mess<00:04:05.970> because

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
it without getting all in a mess because

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:08.420 
it without getting all in a mess because
it's<00:04:06.570> got<00:04:06.840> the<00:04:06.989> the<00:04:07.680> bristles<00:04:08.070> all<00:04:08.220> the<00:04:08.340> way

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
it's got the the bristles all the way

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.190 
it's got the the bristles all the way
through<00:04:08.700> I<00:04:08.730> end<00:04:08.970> up<00:04:09.120> picking<00:04:09.330> up<00:04:09.570> hairs<00:04:09.870> from

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
through I end up picking up hairs from

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.170 
through I end up picking up hairs from
somewhere<00:04:10.680> else<00:04:10.709> that<00:04:11.040> I<00:04:11.070> don't<00:04:11.370> want<00:04:11.610> to<00:04:11.820> put

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
somewhere else that I don't want to put

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.150 
somewhere else that I don't want to put
through<00:04:12.390> the<00:04:12.510> blow-dryer<00:04:12.959> so<00:04:13.680> I<00:04:13.709> just<00:04:13.950> find

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
through the blow-dryer so I just find

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:18.500 
through the blow-dryer so I just find
this<00:04:14.519> so<00:04:14.820> I<00:04:16.640> just<00:04:17.640> find<00:04:17.880> this<00:04:18.060> because<00:04:18.299> the

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
this so I just find this because the

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:20.150 
this so I just find this because the
bristles<00:04:18.870> are<00:04:18.960> contained<00:04:19.380> within<00:04:19.500> here<00:04:20.010> it's

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
bristles are contained within here it's

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.490 
bristles are contained within here it's
just<00:04:20.370> so<00:04:20.609> much<00:04:20.789> easier

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:21.500 
just so much easier

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.080 
just so much easier
and<00:04:21.799> I<00:04:21.920> don't<00:04:21.980> end<00:04:22.280> up<00:04:22.400> picking<00:04:22.580> up<00:04:22.850> other

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 
and I don't end up picking up other

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:26.380 
and I don't end up picking up other
hairs<00:04:23.390> where<00:04:23.630> this<00:04:23.750> touches<00:04:24.230> my<00:04:24.380> scalp<00:04:25.090> this<00:04:26.090> I

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:26.390 
hairs where this touches my scalp this I

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:28.660
