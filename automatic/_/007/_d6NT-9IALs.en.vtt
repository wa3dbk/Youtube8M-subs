00:00:08.709 --> 00:00:08.719 
a tube so I just recently acquired a

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:12.070 
a tube so I just recently acquired a
cold<00:00:09.020> steel<00:00:09.230> torpedo<00:00:09.740> this<00:00:10.610> thing<00:00:10.879> is<00:00:11.059> a<00:00:11.090> 14

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:12.080 
cold steel torpedo this thing is a 14

cold steel torpedo this thing is a 14
inches<00:00:12.320> long<00:00:12.559> and<00:00:12.860> weighs<00:00:13.099> 2<00:00:13.370> pounds<00:00:13.990> I<00:00:14.990> think

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:15.679 
inches long and weighs 2 pounds I think

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:20.139 
inches long and weighs 2 pounds I think
it's<00:00:15.769> pretty<00:00:15.920> thick<00:00:16.189> here<00:00:16.550> I'm<00:00:16.790> sure<00:00:16.970> you<00:00:19.149> all

00:00:20.139 --> 00:00:20.149 
it's pretty thick here I'm sure you all

00:00:20.149 --> 00:00:21.760 
it's pretty thick here I'm sure you all
right<00:00:20.300> at<00:00:20.540> the<00:00:20.720> thickest<00:00:21.079> point<00:00:21.259> it's<00:00:21.529> about<00:00:21.619> a

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:21.770 
right at the thickest point it's about a

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:23.800 
right at the thickest point it's about a
stick<00:00:22.130> around<00:00:22.220> as<00:00:22.460> a<00:00:22.579> quarter<00:00:22.910> all<00:00:23.599> right

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:23.810 
stick around as a quarter all right

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:31.210 
stick around as a quarter all right
that's<00:00:24.140> how<00:00:24.259> big<00:00:24.410> the<00:00:24.470> thing<00:00:24.739> is<00:00:30.099> all<00:00:31.099> right

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:31.220 
that's how big the thing is all right

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:32.650 
that's how big the thing is all right
now<00:00:31.340> have<00:00:31.520> a<00:00:31.550> hard<00:00:31.790> time<00:00:31.939> sticking<00:00:32.210> this<00:00:32.419> into

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:32.660 
now have a hard time sticking this into

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:35.020 
now have a hard time sticking this into
the<00:00:32.720> wood<00:00:32.930> just<00:00:33.230> because<00:00:33.760> sort<00:00:34.760> of<00:00:34.820> like<00:00:34.910> the

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:35.030 
the wood just because sort of like the

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:36.780 
the wood just because sort of like the
spiral<00:00:35.329> down<00:00:35.780> point

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:36.790 
spiral down point

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:39.070 
spiral down point
it<00:00:37.790> has<00:00:37.970> to<00:00:38.090> poke<00:00:38.300> really<00:00:38.540> big<00:00:38.660> holes<00:00:38.870> in<00:00:38.990> the

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:39.080 
it has to poke really big holes in the

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.170 
it has to poke really big holes in the
target<00:00:39.500> and<00:00:39.650> it<00:00:39.920> will<00:00:40.130> not<00:00:40.280> stick<00:00:40.580> it<00:00:40.790> you<00:00:41.060> know

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:41.180 
target and it will not stick it you know

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:42.610 
target and it will not stick it you know
an<00:00:41.270> uneven<00:00:41.630> angle<00:00:41.930> like<00:00:42.110> if<00:00:42.230> it's<00:00:42.380> like<00:00:42.500> this

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.620 
an uneven angle like if it's like this

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.310 
an uneven angle like if it's like this
just<00:00:42.920> can<00:00:43.040> bounce<00:00:43.250> off<00:00:43.690> now<00:00:44.690> as<00:00:44.900> with<00:00:45.050> a<00:00:45.110> knife

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:45.320 
just can bounce off now as with a knife

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.440 
just can bounce off now as with a knife
it<00:00:45.560> probably<00:00:45.920> stick<00:00:46.190> but<00:00:46.880> you<00:00:46.970> can't<00:00:47.180> stick<00:00:47.360> in

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:47.450 
it probably stick but you can't stick in

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.710 
it probably stick but you can't stick in
wood<00:00:47.660> it's<00:00:47.810> just<00:00:47.990> a<00:00:48.200> lot<00:00:48.410> more<00:00:48.440> difficult<00:00:49.720> so

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:50.720 
wood it's just a lot more difficult so

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.420 
wood it's just a lot more difficult so
I'm<00:00:50.780> going<00:00:50.930> to<00:00:50.960> hit<00:00:51.110> it<00:00:51.260> in<00:00:51.350> my<00:00:51.440> phone<00:00:51.710> our

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:55.370 
into the target now I did come in at an

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:57.220 
into the target now I did come in at an
angle<00:01:55.460> all<00:01:56.390> right<00:01:56.630> I<00:01:56.660> thought<00:01:56.930> I've<00:01:57.110> been

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:57.230 
angle all right I thought I've been

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:59.320 
angle all right I thought I've been
thrown<00:01:57.380> this<00:01:57.470> thing<00:01:57.650> for<00:01:57.950> and<00:01:58.160> if<00:01:58.760> you<00:01:59.240> guys

00:01:59.320 --> 00:01:59.330

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.000 
thrown this thing for and if you guys
dead<00:01:59.690> on<00:01:59.840> it'll<00:02:00.170> hit<00:02:00.320> stick<00:02:00.590> up<00:02:00.710> to<00:02:00.830> about

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:01.010 
dead on it'll hit stick up to about

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:05.440 
dead on it'll hit stick up to about
halfway<00:02:01.360> into<00:02:02.360> the<00:02:02.540> target<00:02:02.780> so<00:02:04.300> that's<00:02:05.300> what

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
halfway into the target so that's what

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:06.670 
halfway into the target so that's what
happened<00:02:05.750> now<00:02:06.110> I'm<00:02:06.170> gonna<00:02:06.290> try<00:02:06.380> the<00:02:06.470> water
