00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 what a super start today yes that was 

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:07.170
 a nice start with 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.360
 with flashy football and the second 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.980
 link or you great some salt 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.170
 however, there was an unprecedented first half 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.929
 how nice we played 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.670
 rare good so well realized this 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.699
 season or the way as the played 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.100
 finish it off or make an annual pressure 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:26.490
 everyone participated yes that was simply not possible 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:29.400
 then separate separate largest ones are added 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.990
 first half of the pleasure for the public was 2 tbsp 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.329
 what had been less with groningen 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.880
 Digital more tragedies less 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.230
 dispensing space concept has been more on the 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.540
 instead of playing the 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.840
 assignment went to the zest you yourself too 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:45.440
 it is going fast now with one 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:48.410
 asus and goals yes yes goes well 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.210
 just a second 11 also something 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.920
 bring more but then hedge 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.900
 yes it did not go so well the field 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:57.590
 gently wash it out 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:59.420
 mat slippery so we knew what to do with it 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:02.180
 she has big yes me first 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.800
 download and you are in the second half 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.229
 the relax on the couch 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.310
 okay tell him all the way 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:09.650
 second goal 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:13.970
 Giving away 2 goals was therefore necessary 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:15.530
 5060 sounds better the 5th to you 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.830
 so that we have to pay attention anyway 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:21.470
 get that second place and what's next 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:24.720
 farther in is yes we see that then 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.670
 agent that score the last few weeks is that 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.860
 something as you get closer to the source 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:33.120
 or because you are in the position more often 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:35.040
 years think god has always been 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.390
 resident in the previous period we price 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.210
 also have a number of times of distance 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.680
 scored and is now going well but is 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.020
 indeed so that if you go in more often 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.030
 the peace content and the team is running 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.590
 yes then you can you can too 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.820
 and then you also have to between 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.650
 couple maybe 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.090
 and van bommel if you can still give advice 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.160
 it must remain 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.200
 I also said to the television 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.460
 must determine themselves 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.869
 but as it played today it was 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.970
 really very big class 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.410
 yes it would be nice to think he is today 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.600
 He enjoyed having a nice day 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:05.460
 was before and then he comes right to 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.310
 don't applause the audience and change it 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:11.970
 menu too long singing and the banners 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:15.330
 you have to stay yes the care always beautiful me 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:18.660
 I have never experienced this before 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:21.690
 so much my son and so long and so hard 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.910

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.930

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.330

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.930
 the same 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:38.640
 you have the buttons by fire 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.769
 no you have mine for yourself 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.849
 thoughts of when that you like that 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:43.230
 definitive 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:45.000

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.129

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.420
 1 year contract signed with anarchy 

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:50.489

 to the cup final but it is too 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:05.849
 so that the club 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.160
 like to have clarity one and then 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:08.849
 and maybe you cook for yourself too 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.140
