by the way you can use playful people
closer<00:01:28.090> to<00:01:28.330> the<00:01:28.390> world<00:01:28.570> and<00:01:28.869> trickster<00:01:29.800> to<00:01:30.070> do

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:30.190 
closer to the world and trickster to do

jungle<00:01:36.820> camps<00:01:37.090> using<00:01:37.479> a<00:01:37.540> technique<00:01:37.869> called

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:37.930 
jungle camps using a technique called

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:46.770 
jungle camps using a technique called
double<00:01:38.560> jump<00:01:44.670> you<00:01:45.670> can<00:01:45.790> just<00:01:45.940> drink<00:01:46.360> many

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780 
double jump you can just drink many

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.570 
double jump you can just drink many
different<00:01:47.110> ways<00:01:47.259> actually<00:01:47.650> natural<00:01:48.310> when<00:01:48.490> you

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:48.580 
different ways actually natural when you

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.639 
different ways actually natural when you
go<00:01:48.700> over<00:01:49.060> here<00:01:49.990> you<00:01:50.140> can<00:01:50.259> see<00:01:50.380> some<00:01:50.440> more

00:01:50.639 --> 00:01:50.649 
go over here you can see some more

00:01:50.649 --> 00:02:02.130 
go over here you can see some more
example<00:01:59.940> finally<00:02:00.940> here<00:02:01.420> is<00:02:01.570> the<00:02:01.720> basic

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
example finally here is the basic

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:03.469 
example finally here is the basic
algorithm<00:02:02.560> we<00:02:02.860> face

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
algorithm we face

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.700 
algorithm we face
unfortunately<00:02:04.479> I<00:02:04.630> wasn't<00:02:04.929> running<00:02:05.259> below<00:02:05.649> to

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
unfortunately I wasn't running below to

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.070 
unfortunately I wasn't running below to
play<00:02:05.950> that<00:02:06.190> day<00:02:06.420> but<00:02:07.420> this<00:02:07.630> representation

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
play that day but this representation

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:16.830 
play that day but this representation
comes<00:02:08.560> close<00:02:08.830> to<00:02:09.039> what<00:02:09.070> happened<00:02:15.300> now<00:02:16.300> let's

to try some sisters in a real game you

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.140 
to try some sisters in a real game you
generate<00:02:33.380> the<00:02:33.500> video<00:02:33.709> for<00:02:34.100> direct<00:02:34.370> bottom<00:02:34.640> as

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
generate the video for direct bottom as

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.660
