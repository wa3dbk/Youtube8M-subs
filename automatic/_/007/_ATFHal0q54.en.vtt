00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:42.730
 I was inspired by the latest video that made porters 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:45.880
 the smoky site of the law 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:50.280

 gray mouse is not gray mouse imports text raf 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.020
 that is to say a joke and yet I speak without thinking 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.240
 and that is why this site is a coloring 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:16.880
