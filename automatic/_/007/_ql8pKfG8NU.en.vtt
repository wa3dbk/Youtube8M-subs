00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.850
 how can you or what's infuriating 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:08.069
 annoying for the ol this result or it's 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.730
 still a good wall 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:10.870
 I would say it's 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:12.540
 a good draw 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:16.360
 Even if I 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:18.430
 tonight it's a pity here is the penalty a 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.439
 been withdrawn his decision on Tuesday 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:21.789
 he made his decision he needs the 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:22.640
 respect 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:24.680
 it's like that 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.720
 it's a shame for us but 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:29.220
 brewery I think that overall 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.750
 the pharmacy is very solid 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.419
 like that it was his all 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.079
 team 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:35.079
 the com 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.960
 this match there 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:39.960
 very pleasant very strong 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.949
 you're performing tonight 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.190
 shareholders of the arts is absolutely 

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:46.190
 huge 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.630
 this team tonight it reassured me I 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.040
 am going to 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:55.040
 even still do more on the means 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:06.100
 we stay there 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.689
 to have everything naked like that passage 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:12.990
 his escape or to have dreamed a little 

00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:12.990
 everything and not to be expected as turning 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:17.360
 yeah for sure 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.700
 we had monsters 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.330
 it's good 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.960
 to riders 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.960
 stopped 

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:28.340
 you heard him whistle 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:30.320
 apparently sir turpin before you 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:37.329
 make the stop apparently here fire very 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:37.329
 early chanted nothing function on the 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.470
 it is 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:45.190
 made his decision respect it on the 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.190
 respect but here 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.730
 and 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.100
 this little advance 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:55.840
 how to explain your calm 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.840
 tragic not been supportive tonight 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.670
 this penalty has 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:01.500
 but Saturday on time 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.570
 that's how it's to respect 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:08.750
 it's a young team still have 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.750
 its colors inside that 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:14.320
 the gray color no it's 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.490
 let's move on to something else we liked to take 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.660
 the three points in front of our audience this 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:17.590
 evening who was and who has a new 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.380
 time 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.060
 huge 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:25.460
 just one thing to say is that it's 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.460
 shame shame for us as 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:30.160
 it's the hazards of 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:35.490
 football we respect the decisions 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:35.490
