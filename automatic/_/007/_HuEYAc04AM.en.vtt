pretty<00:02:27.780> disappointed<00:02:28.440> actually<00:02:29.060> I<00:02:30.060> don't

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
pretty disappointed actually I don't

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.360 
pretty disappointed actually I don't
know<00:02:30.989> if<00:02:31.170> it<00:02:31.319> came<00:02:31.590> through<00:02:31.890> them<00:02:32.069> and<00:02:32.220> have<00:02:32.310> to

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
know if it came through them and have to

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.089 
know if it came through them and have to
look<00:02:32.700> when<00:02:33.180> I'm<00:02:33.330> editing<00:02:33.840> this<00:02:34.050> but<00:02:34.410> there<00:02:34.920> was

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:35.099 
look when I'm editing this but there was

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:37.160 
look when I'm editing this but there was
already<00:02:35.280> some<00:02:35.730> things<00:02:35.970> that<00:02:36.300> were<00:02:36.810> kind<00:02:37.019> of

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
already some things that were kind of

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.530 
already some things that were kind of
underneath<00:02:38.120> this<00:02:39.120> layer<00:02:39.840> of<00:02:40.140> protection<00:02:40.890> and

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
underneath this layer of protection and

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:46.160 
underneath this layer of protection and
then<00:02:42.540> at<00:02:42.810> the<00:02:42.959> very<00:02:43.310> bottom<00:02:44.310> here<00:02:45.049> where<00:02:46.049> you

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
then at the very bottom here where you

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.110 
then at the very bottom here where you
can<00:02:46.319> see<00:02:46.350> this<00:02:46.709> kind<00:02:47.250> of<00:02:47.340> stuff

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
can see this kind of stuff

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.390 
can see this kind of stuff
it's<00:02:48.870> almost<00:02:49.080> equivalent<00:02:49.380> to<00:02:49.769> like<00:02:50.190> if<00:02:50.370> you

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
it's almost equivalent to like if you

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.910 
it's almost equivalent to like if you
had<00:02:50.880> a<00:02:50.959> plastic<00:02:51.959> screen<00:02:52.230> protector<00:02:52.290> and<00:02:52.739> the

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
had a plastic screen protector and the

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.190 
had a plastic screen protector and the
edge<00:02:53.069> was<00:02:53.340> coming<00:02:53.670> up<00:02:53.819> how<00:02:54.450> it<00:02:54.630> would<00:02:54.780> continue

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
edge was coming up how it would continue

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.070 
edge was coming up how it would continue
to<00:02:55.230> get<00:02:55.410> things<00:02:55.880> stuck<00:02:56.880> on<00:02:57.090> it<00:02:57.269> and<00:02:57.450> then<00:02:57.959> it

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
to get things stuck on it and then it

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.770 
to get things stuck on it and then it
would<00:02:58.200> get<00:02:58.380> a<00:02:58.440> little<00:02:58.769> bit<00:02:58.980> crusty<00:02:59.780> that's

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
would get a little bit crusty that's

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.680 
would get a little bit crusty that's
exactly<00:03:01.380> what<00:03:01.830> happened<00:03:02.489> here<00:03:02.519> so<00:03:03.450> it<00:03:03.569> was

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
exactly what happened here so it was

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.770 
exactly what happened here so it was
already<00:03:03.900> a<00:03:03.989> little<00:03:04.140> bit<00:03:04.319> crusty<00:03:04.530> and<00:03:05.360> the<00:03:06.360> fit

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
already a little bit crusty and the fit

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.589 
already a little bit crusty and the fit
isn't<00:03:07.049> quite<00:03:07.980> what<00:03:08.790> I<00:03:08.849> was<00:03:09.000> expecting

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:09.599 
isn't quite what I was expecting

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:13.850 
isn't quite what I was expecting
either<00:03:09.870> I<00:03:10.260> don't<00:03:10.650> understand<00:03:11.370> why<00:03:12.290> they<00:03:13.290> made

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
either I don't understand why they made

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.970 
either I don't understand why they made
this<00:03:14.099> longer<00:03:14.760> here<00:03:15.239> if<00:03:15.420> it<00:03:16.230> wasn't<00:03:16.590> going<00:03:16.830> to

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
this longer here if it wasn't going to

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:22.340 
this longer here if it wasn't going to
actually<00:03:17.760> be<00:03:18.630> long<00:03:18.900> enough<00:03:19.170> to<00:03:19.430> not<00:03:21.230> cover<00:03:22.230> up

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
actually be long enough to not cover up

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.560 
actually be long enough to not cover up
the<00:03:22.739> front<00:03:23.010> facing<00:03:23.430> camera<00:03:23.880> I<00:03:24.030> mean<00:03:24.480> I

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
the front facing camera I mean I

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:26.569 
the front facing camera I mean I
understand<00:03:25.109> making<00:03:25.739> it<00:03:26.010> into<00:03:26.160> where<00:03:26.280> you<00:03:26.430> can

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:26.579 
understand making it into where you can

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:27.890 
understand making it into where you can
tell<00:03:26.760> the<00:03:26.790> difference<00:03:27.209> between<00:03:27.269> the<00:03:27.690> top<00:03:27.870> and

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
tell the difference between the top and

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.319 
tell the difference between the top and
the<00:03:28.079> bottom<00:03:28.230> but<00:03:28.590> truthfully<00:03:29.239> everything<00:03:30.239> is

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:30.329 
the bottom but truthfully everything is

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:31.789 
the bottom but truthfully everything is
the<00:03:30.450> same<00:03:30.480> size<00:03:30.900> so<00:03:31.230> if<00:03:31.380> you're<00:03:31.530> not<00:03:31.620> gonna

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
the same size so if you're not gonna

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:35.000 
the same size so if you're not gonna
make<00:03:32.040> it<00:03:32.100> long<00:03:32.880> enough<00:03:33.030> to<00:03:33.989> not<00:03:34.440> cover<00:03:34.709> that<00:03:34.859> up

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
make it long enough to not cover that up

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.940 
make it long enough to not cover that up
then<00:03:35.730> just<00:03:35.760> stop<00:03:36.750> it<00:03:36.900> there<00:03:36.930> instead<00:03:37.739> of

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
then just stop it there instead of

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.190 
then just stop it there instead of
actually<00:03:38.609> trying<00:03:38.940> to<00:03:39.120> make<00:03:39.269> it<00:03:39.450> aware<00:03:39.569> this

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
actually trying to make it aware this

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:45.620 
actually trying to make it aware this
isn't<00:03:40.590> half<00:03:40.890> on<00:03:41.310> and<00:03:41.609> half<00:03:41.780> off<00:03:42.780> and<00:03:44.450> with<00:03:45.450> this

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
isn't half on and half off and with this

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.590 
isn't half on and half off and with this
phone<00:03:46.350> the<00:03:46.739> face<00:03:46.920> of<00:03:47.220> it<00:03:47.370> is<00:03:47.549> everything<00:03:48.269> is<00:03:48.389> so

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
phone the face of it is everything is so

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.430 
phone the face of it is everything is so
similar<00:03:49.910> it's<00:03:50.910> actually<00:03:51.329> hard<00:03:51.600> to<00:03:51.810> place<00:03:52.079> the

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
similar it's actually hard to place the

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.789 
similar it's actually hard to place the
screen<00:03:52.769> protector<00:03:53.359> or<00:03:54.359> it's<00:03:54.630> even<00:03:55.260> there's

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:55.799 
screen protector or it's even there's

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:58.580 
screen protector or it's even there's
nothing<00:03:56.810> really<00:03:57.810> guiding<00:03:58.260> you

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
nothing really guiding you

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.680 
nothing really guiding you
so<00:03:59.160> again<00:04:00.000> if<00:04:00.209> they<00:04:00.329> would<00:04:00.450> have<00:04:00.569> actually

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
so again if they would have actually

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:02.720 
so again if they would have actually
just<00:04:01.019> cut<00:04:01.170> this<00:04:01.319> off<00:04:01.530> here<00:04:01.560> that<00:04:02.519> would<00:04:02.639> have

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
just cut this off here that would have

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.390 
just cut this off here that would have
actually<00:04:02.880> been<00:04:03.180> an<00:04:03.329> easier<00:04:03.870> way<00:04:04.590> to<00:04:04.620> determine

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
actually been an easier way to determine

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.340 
actually been an easier way to determine
where<00:04:06.090> to<00:04:06.120> place<00:04:06.510> this<00:04:06.810> screen<00:04:07.139> protector

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:07.350 
where to place this screen protector

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:10.360 
where to place this screen protector
when<00:04:08.310> you're<00:04:08.549> setting<00:04:09.000> it<00:04:09.090> down<00:04:09.329> on<00:04:09.630> top<00:04:09.900> of<00:04:10.139> it

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:10.370 
when you're setting it down on top of it

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:14.479 
when you're setting it down on top of it
so<00:04:11.370> there<00:04:11.609> are<00:04:11.730> some<00:04:12.090> bubbles<00:04:12.600> that<00:04:13.200> well<00:04:13.920> okay

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:14.489 
so there are some bubbles that well okay

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:16.340 
so there are some bubbles that well okay
so<00:04:14.519> they're<00:04:14.940> not<00:04:15.060> exactly<00:04:15.209> bubbles<00:04:15.840> it's<00:04:16.079> more

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
so they're not exactly bubbles it's more

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:18.319 
so they're not exactly bubbles it's more
of<00:04:16.440> where<00:04:16.650> the<00:04:16.769> adhesive<00:04:16.950> just<00:04:17.489> needs<00:04:17.700> to<00:04:17.940> dry

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:18.329 
of where the adhesive just needs to dry

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:20.150 
of where the adhesive just needs to dry
because<00:04:18.660> of<00:04:18.810> the<00:04:19.019> alcohol<00:04:19.470> pad<00:04:19.709> that<00:04:19.889> I<00:04:19.950> used

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
because of the alcohol pad that I used

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.520 
because of the alcohol pad that I used
on<00:04:20.370> it<00:04:20.519> I'm<00:04:21.359> not<00:04:21.539> quite<00:04:21.840> sure<00:04:21.870> what's<00:04:22.349> going<00:04:22.500> to

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.530 
on it I'm not quite sure what's going to

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:23.960 
on it I'm not quite sure what's going to
happen<00:04:22.830> around<00:04:23.039> the<00:04:23.099> edges<00:04:23.430> but<00:04:23.610> they<00:04:23.760> may

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
happen around the edges but they may

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.820 
happen around the edges but they may
also<00:04:24.620> dry<00:04:25.620> out

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:26.830 
also dry out

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:29.580 
also dry out
the<00:04:26.919> edges<00:04:27.430> of<00:04:27.460> the<00:04:27.789> screen<00:04:28.150> are<00:04:28.360> rounded<00:04:28.900> so

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.590 
the edges of the screen are rounded so

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:32.490 
the edges of the screen are rounded so
this<00:04:29.919> isn't<00:04:30.159> going<00:04:30.729> to<00:04:30.849> go<00:04:30.970> edge<00:04:31.180> to<00:04:31.389> edge<00:04:31.509> but

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:32.500 
this isn't going to go edge to edge but

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:33.570 
this isn't going to go edge to edge but
if<00:04:32.620> you're<00:04:32.740> not<00:04:32.830> gonna<00:04:32.949> make<00:04:33.039> an<00:04:33.220> edge<00:04:33.340> to<00:04:33.520> edge

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:33.580 
if you're not gonna make an edge to edge

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.149 
if you're not gonna make an edge to edge
you<00:04:33.819> need<00:04:33.940> to<00:04:34.000> just<00:04:34.270> bring<00:04:34.419> it<00:04:34.629> a<00:04:34.690> little<00:04:34.930> bit

00:04:35.149 --> 00:04:35.159 
you need to just bring it a little bit

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:38.640 
you need to just bring it a little bit
over<00:04:36.159> from<00:04:36.669> the<00:04:36.789> edge<00:04:36.909> so<00:04:37.479> that<00:04:37.659> when<00:04:37.810> it<00:04:37.930> sits

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:38.650 
over from the edge so that when it sits

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:41.369 
over from the edge so that when it sits
down<00:04:38.949> on<00:04:39.280> there<00:04:39.690> you're<00:04:40.690> not<00:04:40.810> overlapping

00:04:41.369 --> 00:04:41.379 
down on there you're not overlapping

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:44.189 
down on there you're not overlapping
anywhere<00:04:42.069> on<00:04:42.280> the<00:04:42.430> edges<00:04:42.819> because<00:04:43.599> that's

00:04:44.189 --> 00:04:44.199 
anywhere on the edges because that's

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:45.629 
anywhere on the edges because that's
just<00:04:44.530> going<00:04:44.680> to<00:04:44.740> make<00:04:44.800> the<00:04:45.039> edges<00:04:45.340> of<00:04:45.520> the

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:45.639 
just going to make the edges of the

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:47.939 
just going to make the edges of the
screen<00:04:45.909> protector<00:04:46.030> not<00:04:46.539> stick<00:04:47.110> so<00:04:47.770> I<00:04:47.800> mean
