I much prefer those over the long neck's

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.990 
I much prefer those over the long neck's
cuz<00:00:33.870> they're<00:00:34.079> well<00:00:34.559> long<00:00:35.430> necks<00:00:35.670> aren't<00:00:35.910> much

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
cuz they're well long necks aren't much

longer than that and if you stretch

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.950 
longer than that and if you stretch
these<00:00:37.469> out<00:00:37.739> they<00:00:37.920> get<00:00:38.100> quite<00:00:38.340> long<00:00:38.660> I<00:00:39.660> know

much<00:04:11.650> it<00:04:12.060> it's<00:04:13.060> two<00:04:13.659> point<00:04:14.079> three<00:04:14.319> five<00:04:14.620> tires

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
much it it's two point three five tires
