00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:15.960
 You want to do comics usually is 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.060
 worry a lot about a sketchy drawing 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.789
 with a technical level in the composition of 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.949
 pages of his dynamism characters 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:26.099
 kind of things but not all that 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:29.220
 end up paying due attention or not 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:31.109
 worrying to study the script study 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.360
 and writing good scripts is an area 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.610
 different from that of drawing and are not 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.250
 all people who want to be 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.300
 Therefore, no final thank you 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:44.460
 accounts are different and if we had 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:46.829
 theorist talking about drawing art or 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.260
 same comic book thing 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.000
 narrative except it 's more there are others 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.980
 books directed to writing scripts 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.100
 because really an area you need 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.550
 of much study very knowledgeable 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:02.489
 theoretical capacity of organization 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:04.140
 synthesis mainly creativity 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.450
 many people who write good 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.360
 scripts are often highlighted because they 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:12.210
 an area so common in people who 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.970
 study and dedicate to it comes much 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.280
 people asked me to talk a little bit about 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:20.310
 scripts indicate something about this 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.830
 good so come indicated that some 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.689
 books that I consider to be interesting 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.369
 for a reading for you about 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.409
 mainly set up for 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.840
 things in these 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.329
 script ends up serving movies for 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.460
 theater book and groomsmen 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.110
 then for you to give some research and 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.810
 seek to join with their expertise 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.640
 technical in the first sequential active 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:46.760
 book that I will recommend to you 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:50.270
 here is the manual your sweet field 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:53.330
 1979 and this American here is a director 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:56.330
 of films and vidal of scripts and 60 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:58.820
 many of the theories postulated or 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.830
 excerpts you see out of tutorials 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:04.190
 of script that talks about structures 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:06.710
 basic and setra the foundation is this here 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:08.660
 They took the book from this guy to 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.970
 write small did then 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.940
 you want to go to the source from which comes all 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:16.670
 that beginning theory means and end 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:19.040
 Here reading is very easy but 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.750
 quiet to read and even a bit of dunga 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.610
 before in some parts but I believe 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.620
 that you know the theories that 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:27.830
 is putting here he will pull you the 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.790
 cinema but as I said it also serves 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.980
 for comics 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.840
 he proposes that the exercises also he 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.880
 example uses movies are very 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.590
 I believe that almost everything 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.550
 world has seen of the exterminator of 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.550
 future 2 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:42.200
 this edition of 2001 I've heard 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:45.170
 that the most recent issues in a 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:47.810
 update and with the film a bit more 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:50.060
 current or have some those are very 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:53.360
 but popular in the late 80s and 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:55.459
 90 and I think both in 2013 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:58.070
 I have tested an entire generation that has not 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:01.190
 witnessed this kind of movie if you 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:03.590
 never read anything about script about how 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:05.959
 write about conforming stories 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:08.060
 I recommend you start with this 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:10.070
 precisely because of this time I think it has 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.290
 a very simple reading but it is well 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:14.269
 easy for you to assimilate ideas into 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.820
 my next recommendation is this one 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:19.190
 hero of a thousand faces of joseph campbell is 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:21.620
 in this book about the 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:24.620
 legendary journey of the hero he goes 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:27.019
 seek philosophy in the great stories 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:29.630
 the mythology of the regions to explain 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:33.470
 this thing the hero myth and we saw was 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:35.840
 written in 1949 still holds great 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:38.630
 scripts great stories they have as 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.760
 basis of this exchange rate theory is a 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:41.930
 indispensable reading for good 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.269
 writers 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:46.819
 want to deepen this thing write 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:49.219
 stories relegated the scripts only 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:52.719
 How much does he do in mythology? 

00:03:49.219 --> 00:03:55.459
 in philosophy on this kind of thing you 

00:03:52.719 --> 00:03:57.349
 needs to be a bit harder on the video 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:04:00.170
 I enjoyed reading a little bit about reading. 

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:02.840
 more about this kind of things theory 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:04.730
 so if you 're not used to reading 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:08.090
 these things do not have the habit of 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:10.400
 reading books only remaining super mangal 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:12.290
 Never hero your thing a little more 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.239
 Deep for more head I do not 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:16.579
 I recommend you start with it because 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:19.459
 You will not be able to follow the 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:22.880
 reasoning is the first time that today I 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:26.120
 I confess I was 19 and I did not 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:28.220
 I understood almost date nor was passing 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:30.889
 it's because I did not have theoretical maturity 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:33.410
 to follow this surgery 

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:36.590
 years later and again 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:38.720
 absorb much more certain but even that 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:40.789
 You do not know why he got to 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:43.130
 see later make this name remarkable 

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:44.840
 because if you can listen for sure 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:47.300
 You 'll hear about this again. 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:48.949
 the next video to indicate that this 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:52.400
 here drawing scott's comics 

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:54.380
 macleod my great master of the 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:56.120
 comics he is his third book 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:58.039
 he did not clearly tell the script he 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:00.380
 talks about telling stories in 

00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:02.479
 comics that in good for the script that 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:05.240
 interesting that it speaks objectively of 

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:07.280
 so he'll pull you to the 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:09.289
 issues a question of creating 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:11.780
 characters that expose 

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:13.490
 most exclusive features of 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:15.470
 different comics from here 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:17.750
 he speaks of a context to tell 

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:19.639
 exploring more generally is to write the name 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:21.800
 recommended reading is also very 

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:24.860
 simple you can start with it too 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:26.870
 this day was published in 2008 and it is well 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:28.639
 latest delivery will be very easy 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:29.550
 You found beyond these three 

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:32.580
 books here 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:34.410
 to find you find a certain 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:36.210
 anxiety in bookstores and neither do I 

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:38.580
 I know which publisher strike is publishing 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:40.590
 now I'm not even going to indicate the name of the 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:43.050
 publisher for now but I do not have one 

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:45.450
 name of the book the name of the author and finally 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:47.550
 It's going to be a student text for you. 

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:50.160
 who wrote about telling stories 

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:52.260
 in comics is this text I will leave 

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:54.360
 here in the video description a link to 

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:56.940
 download or online reader if you 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:58.860
 preferring free is only access if you can 

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:00.510
 between nenÃª alaor for those who do not 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:04.410
 knows what she wrote the hatred and 

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:06.840
 revenge trong good tones of the bench between 

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:08.970
 other renowned works in 

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:11.940
 comics he will talk a lot of good 

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:14.610
 from his view ok then he will not go to 

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:16.620
 It's serious, but it's definitely worth it. 

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:19.500
 because he talks about how history 

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:21.690
 just in the comic not the button 

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:24.000
 General with her these two books here 

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:26.270
 sure if I could stay an hour 

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:32.940
 reading to you I would say the following 

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:35.520
 begins with this later and if the 

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:37.080
 text love little the idea at the same time 

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:40.740
 I also hurt 

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:42.960
 last is here but no doubt 

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:45.240
 greater reference is to read many works 

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:46.650
 I have watched many movies have enough 

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:47.490
 reference to extend your 

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:49.170
 vocabulary 

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:51.600
 if you are a person who does not always 

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:52.890
 same thing, the same kind of godparents 

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:54.660
 you will hardly be able to 

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:56.400
 surprise with a more critical view 

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:58.770
 about telling stories 

00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:01.620
 so while you're like that 

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:04.380
 Something in my head will read a little 

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:07.580
 to know everything a little of everything comes out 

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:09.000
 comfort zone to know things 

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:12.150
 many different 

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.460
 Okay, so , I'll leave mine there. 

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:16.889
 description of the video name of the books 

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:19.620
 the link for you to access the text of the 

00:07:16.889 --> 00:07:25.250
 love nor a line of a conferred 

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:25.250
 and that's what we're talking about then 

00:07:25.949 --> 00:07:28.940
