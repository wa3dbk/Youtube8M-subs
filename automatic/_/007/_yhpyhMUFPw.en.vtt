00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
at how I'm gonna do that it's not going

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.540 
at how I'm gonna do that it's not going
to<00:01:01.230> be<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.440> easiest<00:01:02.100> thing<00:01:02.250> in<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.460> world

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
to be the easiest thing in the world

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.969 
to be the easiest thing in the world
where<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.149> aquarium<00:01:03.989> is<00:01:04.170> to<00:01:04.379> move<00:01:04.680> it<00:01:04.860> out

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
that inch so I'll figure that out I'm

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.380 
that inch so I'll figure that out I'm
hoping<00:01:08.130> to<00:01:08.250> look<00:01:08.400> at<00:01:08.549> it<00:01:08.700> tonight<00:01:08.880> or<00:01:09.210> tomorrow

just<00:02:20.080> added<00:02:20.500> the<00:02:20.590> biological<00:02:21.250> filtration<00:02:21.550> and

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
just added the biological filtration and

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.030 
just added the biological filtration and
they<00:02:22.090> worked<00:02:22.300> out<00:02:22.480> really<00:02:22.720> great

this specific problem you're having with
the<00:04:14.130> tank<00:04:17.060> rate<00:04:18.060> of<00:04:18.150> 300<00:04:18.540> gallons<00:04:19.140> per<00:04:19.320> hour

the tank rate of 300 gallons per hour
which<00:04:19.770> I<00:04:19.890> figured<00:04:20.160> for<00:04:20.340> my<00:04:20.520> 55<00:04:21.420> gallon<00:04:21.870> tank

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:22.080 
which I figured for my 55 gallon tank

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:26.150 
which I figured for my 55 gallon tank
would<00:04:22.290> be<00:04:22.580> sufficient<00:04:24.020> the<00:04:25.020> intake<00:04:25.920> tube

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
would be sufficient the intake tube

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.450 
would be sufficient the intake tube
