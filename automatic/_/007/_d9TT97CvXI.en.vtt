00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 today I will make a review of the basis of hb 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.010
 forever music 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:10.769
 This is a base I think I have one 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.200
 base of love and hate for me because I 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.710
 I love it and sometimes I do not like at all 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.870
 none 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:19.020
 sometimes some beautiful too sometimes I 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:22.320
 I do not like it at all but she's a 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:25.109
 excellent base is excellent for those who have 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.150
 dry skin normal skin 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.490
 I think it makes me dislike her. 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.949
 because my skin is oily but even 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.360
 so it is an excellent base that I 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.940
 really like 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.910
 so yes it depends on the day it 's over 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.530
 fresh and skin is good there I opt 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.800
 to use it because the effect it 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.399
 leaves the skin is very beautiful the skin stays 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.770
 beautiful 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:50.280
 usually when I use it someone speaks 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.960
 praises perco speaks that the beautiful stone 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:56.539
 then this is a good point for the 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:01:00.449
 base is certainly so here she has 

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:03.570
 something the bread she is acrylic here 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:10.740
 just like the other bars it has 30 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:12.900
 ml my thing 128 this color looks good 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.090
 cool on my skin is to have a subtotal 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.320
 so the thigh is neither yellow nor 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.420
 with pink 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.310
 so I really like her, I go 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.500
 explain for you to see the difference 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.720
 so no product on the skin 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:28.340
 so I'll pass on to you to see 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.340
 unlike her 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:30.470
 she was here so she is but sequinha 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:32.510
 even so it leaves the skin luminous 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:35.600
 I do not feel I'm seeing a glow 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:39.290
 Reflecting but what I get I do not 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:41.990
 I feel it is wet but it is dry but 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:44.270
 she leaves has a glow of the skin know 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:46.040
 It looks like you have super skin. 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:48.850
 healthy so that 's it I think a lot 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.850
 beautiful not 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:55.100
 it is a more moisturizing base and I think 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:57.620
 that she charges a lot of snakes super good 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:00.050
 only it makes my skin look oily 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.510
 very fast so that's what makes me not 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:04.610
 I really like her but I think it's 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:09.140
 because it has more moisturizing effect 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:11.930
 in even she is not so dry 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:13.070
 about the bases I usually like 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:16.040
 enough 

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:18.050
 I really like her, she was already in 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.120
 a hall is almost halfway so it 's 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:22.640
 a sign that I really like 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:25.520
 even if I have oily skin not always 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.960
 I use bases are dry because at 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:29.060
 Sometimes I like this effect more 

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:30.410
 bright, it seems like a 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.090
 God's brightness 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:34.760
 so that's why I really like this 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:36.830
 line is this is a basis that I always 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.810
 I use powder after I step on it 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:41.240
 because I do not like that effect 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:43.670
 Then I'll have a glass for 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:47.540
 make the skin more opaque I usually 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:49.310
 I opted for the hd powder of the music forever too 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:51.890
 is of the same nature and is in line with 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:54.350
 I really like the effect of these 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:56.540
 two products together give me 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:04:00.260
 I think my skin looks more beautiful 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:02.690
 gives a camouflaged the forums I'm feelin ' 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.430
 take a picture, I think it's beautiful, I 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:06.170
 I really like using this base at night. 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:10.550
 which is usually fresher 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:12.800
 then the skin gets fresher 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:16.340
 also so the skin takes longer. 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:18.350
 time to get oily and I really like it 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:22.010
 of this base 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:23.900
 To say that I do not like, I know sometimes. 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:25.760
 when I am her during the day 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:28.700
 It really gets bad because my skin 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:30.890
 get curious very fast but to use 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:33.230
 I like it a lot at night. 

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:35.260
 so I always step powder after that I 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:38.270
 I think she has average coverage 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:40.340
 average can build to achieve a 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:41.990
 coverage better but as I already said 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:44.660
 I do not like it much, I prefer a finish. 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:46.820
 more natural then I do with three 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:49.190
 Her fields I can fulfill all 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:51.830
 My taste is that it yields a lot because 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:55.790
 I've used both this base and it is 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:59.600
 in half but I can not tell if I 

00:04:55.790 --> 00:05:02.180
 buy her again I prefer her 

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:04.340
 and that matthew elbit which is a version 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:06.410
 much better for those who have oily skin 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:08.600
 I think I get the match velt 

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:10.790
 precisely because it has this finish 

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:12.440
 more sequel for it to be harnessed 

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:15.110
 a very hot city I transfer 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:17.330
 much more bases then sequinho 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:19.280
 generally better but anyway 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:21.350
 I really like this base 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:24.560
 and I think that who has normal skin 

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:28.400
 Dry skin will tidy up or love this base. 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:30.560
 because she really looks very handsome 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:32.240
 on the skin is who has the skin has a lot 

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:33.860
 of people who have oily skin that I love 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:36.170
 this basis also precisely because of 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:38.330
 because it is an excellent base the finish 

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:39.950
 she's beautiful, she does not stay with you either. 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:42.740
 that aspect of which we are 

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:45.650
 full face base knows it does not get so 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:48.140
 heavy it is not apparent that we have 

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:51.230
 There is a lot of product on the face so this is 

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:52.520
 yes a good point for her is then is 

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:54.860
 this girls 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:56.600
 Review is too fast to leave my 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:58.850
 opinion on the basis 

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:01.070
 I really hope you liked it. 

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:02.570
 If you already use Saturday and if you like, you comment. 

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:04.190
 down here for us to talk to 

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:05.810
 no one take this path if your 

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:07.420
 The first time on the channel 

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:10.960
 low to stay inside the news 

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:10.960
 from initial
