 healthy life eats rice every day 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:42.030
 this is a cup of rice grain 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.650
 impeccable pre-cooked fluid for two cups 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.650
 and a half of liquid 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:48.330
 we first boil the water 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:50.220
 it's okay that it's boiling we're going 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:53.010
 to add a teaspoon coffee maker 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:55.650
 curry we will incorporate it well without 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.930
 we will incorporate it well and we will 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:01.080
 let's add the cup next 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.880
 of raw rice and we return it to 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:05.070
 incorporate we cover you we go down 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:07.440
 temperature and we wait for the cooking that 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.869
 it's about 20 to 25 minutes and 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:12.869
 it comes out this goes very well and with that 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:15.030
 is going to be the April recipe then he 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.690
 everything is already matched we already have the 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.660
 grill 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:20.550
 let's use cucumber that we're going 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:23.310
 to add at this time here is that 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:25.350
 that almost nobody does for him and pectin to 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.840
 the pan saved from giving cucumber with 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.690
 shell is going to add a little bit of 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:34.530
 onion and onion cambray with the rabito 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:37.649
 and no need to remove it going 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.640
 to add a little dehydrated garlic 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:43.380
 you can add it 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:48.190
 is that there is no problem and cilantro 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:50.190
 They have to and do good mix leaves no 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:53.440
 just incorporate 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:55.600
 here you can not notice it is a bit 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.990
 dry let's add a little bit of 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.990
 Butter 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.310
 and with that order 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:08.649
 Many people what they do at home is 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.869
 that fat is added first 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:13.750
 ingredients and fat butter 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:15.160
 or oil is the scheme then here 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.470
 what we want to do that the 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:20.590
 fat is not going to burn so that the 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:23.290
 consumption is more healthy 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.730
 the rice did not get more than the curry 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:28.060
 because right now it's doing so 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:30.550
 Thai type but does not take salt either 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.230
 you do not have any oil or onions 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:34.750
 down because that's what we're winning in 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:37.420
 minutes will take the preparation of the 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:40.930
 rice grain 20 to 25 minutes no more 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:43.000
 by house if we were going to use incorporate 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.489
 as you can see and the grease goes 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.790
 covering the ingredients and we're going to 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:50.860
 add some panela cheese here to 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.720
 see if it's going to be added in cubes or 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.210
 I'm going to cut it very quickly here 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.610
 trochita that is the knife 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:03:00.760
 and hoeness is very good recipe as 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:03.460
 for now yes girls to copy it is 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.620
 very simple you can if you're cool 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:07.130
 although it is hot but the cucumber is 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:10.150
 very fresh 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:10.150
 let's add 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:18.620
 look, remember, take the cucumber 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:21.450
 sliced ​​and control of casca carries 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:24.090
 little onion and then the little 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.140
 Cambrai orbits the onion can be 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.569
 to change 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:30.239
 from cambrai so that the tail and the 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:33.480
 Onion go chopped and you can add 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:35.220
 then you put coriander cilantro and 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.709
 deposit a little dehydrated garlic 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:41.310
 everyone to put a little curry on 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:42.959
 powder for our ingredients to 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:46.200
 that has the curry is so very 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:49.680
 sds type ingredient orient 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:53.740
 true if this did not make him see to do 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:56.080
 we are going to add a bit of 

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:59.090
 our grain of rice so you leave 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:02.300
 incorporating and heating 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:05.180
 and it looks different totally different and 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:07.790
 everything was in the teaspoon of coffee maker 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:10.340
 of curry that was put in the water two 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:12.830
 cups and a half of water for a cup of 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:14.690
 rice that features as you search 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:17.389
 the rice so they do not stick and nothing 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:19.340
 pre-cooked or impeccable or stick 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:21.380
 brands handle it like pallero the 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:25.520
 characteristic of the rice grain is 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:28.400
 light brown color a sturdy and long makes 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.840
 clarito robust or extreme that gordi 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.880
 chubby and long 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:36.320
 the comparison of forget how you should 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:37.970
 extra and do not look how the pepiño is given 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:42.689
 last one is going to add a trickle of 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:44.429
 soy sauce only one splash 

00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:47.129
 a little bit and that the elche does little 

00:04:44.429 --> 00:04:48.869
 it is incorporated again 

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:51.149
 As you can see, it's a recipe 

00:04:48.869 --> 00:04:54.360
 simple to prepare everything we have in 

00:04:51.149 --> 00:04:56.440

 the cheese 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:01.300
 cilantro the only thing that maybe not 

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:02.770
 we came to have is the curry but in 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.720

 there it seems restored already know how to 

00:05:17.359 --> 00:05:24.859

00:05:21.319 --> 00:05:27.199
 weights in a ration not of rociíto if already 

00:05:24.859 --> 00:05:31.059
