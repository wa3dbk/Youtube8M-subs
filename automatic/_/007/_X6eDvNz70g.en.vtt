00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.950
 hello by this video i will you 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.919
 show how cuttings and a plant 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:10.160
 green indoor you have a pretty 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:14.670
 plant you wish to reproduce 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:17.460
 here's how to do it on this plant 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:21.029
 I will take a cuttings 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:25.019
 of ivy so for that I will choose 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:29.189
 one of the most beautiful leaves towards the 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:40.020
 up and I'm going to cut off using a 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:44.840
 chisel at the intersection like this I 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.840
 remove the cuttings 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:01:00.949
 then I'm going to put my cuttings in a 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:01:04.129
 little glass of water I place this little 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:08.299
 preferably Verdot near a window 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:10.810
 in the light I do not change the water but 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:13.729
 I add him every two days 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:17.630
 you will see that the roots are good 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:19.490
 quickly enough to form and once 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:24.830
 you will have many you can 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:27.530
 win your ivy and to speed up 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.659
 root formation small tips 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:33.500
 like the bouquets of flowers I add 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:35.539
 a pinch of powdered sugar and you 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.159
 will see that the roots are going fast 

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:41.330
 develop 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:44.170
 here and you can make cuttings 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:48.560
 from any indoor plant 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:51.100
 you just have to choose a stem in 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.100
 healthy 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:10.840
 a hint of sugar and I leave 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:10.840
 rooted my cuttings
