00:00:59.570 --> 00:00:59.580 
that much room in a Spitfire there is

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:01.429 
that much room in a Spitfire there is
actually<00:00:59.970> no<00:01:00.150> room<00:01:00.360> whatsoever<00:01:00.390> and<00:01:01.110> in<00:01:01.199> fact

actually no room whatsoever and in fact

00:01:01.439 --> 00:01:03.500 
actually no room whatsoever and in fact
I<00:01:01.589> could<00:01:01.650> do<00:01:01.979> with<00:01:02.220> a<00:01:02.369> lot<00:01:02.820> more<00:01:03.059> room<00:01:03.330> at

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
I could do with a lot more room at

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.730 
I could do with a lot more room at
shoulder<00:01:03.930> height<00:01:03.960> here<00:01:04.470> there<00:01:05.460> is<00:01:06.740> quite

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
shoulder height here there is quite

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.620 
shoulder height here there is quite
considerable<00:01:08.490> interference<00:01:08.850> with<00:01:09.540> the

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
considerable interference with the

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.359 
considerable interference with the

ability to move the stick left and right

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.090 
ability to move the stick left and right
it<00:01:12.119> affects<00:01:12.750> your<00:01:12.960> ability<00:01:13.110> to<00:01:13.619> swivel<00:01:13.890> around

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
it affects your ability to swivel around

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.600 
it affects your ability to swivel around
even<00:01:14.700> without<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.510> canopy<00:01:15.960> shut<00:01:16.370> right<00:01:17.370> well

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
even without the canopy shut right well

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:27.030 
even without the canopy shut right well
let's<00:01:17.820> see<00:01:18.060> what<00:01:18.090> it's<00:01:18.330> like<00:01:18.540> with<00:01:18.750> a<00:01:18.780> lid<00:01:19.020> down

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:27.040 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.630 

well<00:01:28.040> well<00:01:28.280> this<00:01:29.120> certainly<00:01:29.930> isn't<00:01:30.520> for<00:01:31.520> the

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
well well this certainly isn't for the

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.770 
well well this certainly isn't for the

obviously<00:01:47.890> the<00:01:48.890> first<00:01:49.190> thing<00:01:49.460> that<00:01:49.490> takes<00:01:50.000> you

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
obviously the first thing that takes you

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.359 
obviously the first thing that takes you
is<00:01:50.680> just<00:01:51.680> how<00:01:51.860> little<00:01:52.070> room<00:01:52.430> it<00:01:52.640> is<00:01:52.670> probably

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:54.369 
is just how little room it is probably

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:58.960 
is just how little room it is probably
it's<00:01:55.369> a<00:01:55.490> good<00:01:55.520> 100<00:01:56.149> percent<00:01:56.720> worse<00:01:57.790> than<00:01:58.790> the

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:58.970 
it's a good 100 percent worse than the

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:00.609 
it's a good 100 percent worse than the
problem<00:01:59.330> of<00:01:59.479> turning<00:01:59.869> around<00:01:59.960> to<00:02:00.290> look<00:02:00.440> behind

some<00:02:42.230> features<00:02:42.500> in<00:02:42.860> the<00:02:42.980> cockpit<00:02:43.370> which<00:02:43.549> I

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
some features in the cockpit which I

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.190 
some features in the cockpit which I
actually<00:02:43.820> like<00:02:44.799> starting<00:02:45.799> on<00:02:45.890> the<00:02:46.010> left<00:02:46.250> the

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
actually like starting on the left the

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.810 
actually like starting on the left the
elevator<00:02:48.200> trim<00:02:48.440> wheel<00:02:48.739> is<00:02:49.070> perhaps<00:02:49.489> a<00:02:49.670> bit<00:02:49.790> too

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:49.820 
elevator trim wheel is perhaps a bit too

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:51.850 
elevator trim wheel is perhaps a bit too
big<00:02:50.180> but<00:02:50.450> nicely<00:02:51.140> positioned<00:02:51.290> and

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
big but nicely positioned and

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.000 
big but nicely positioned and
businesslike<00:02:53.080> full<00:02:54.080> quadrant<00:02:54.560> is<00:02:54.709> nice

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
businesslike full quadrant is nice

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.190 
businesslike full quadrant is nice
frontal<00:02:56.000> friction<00:02:56.420> is<00:02:56.540> nice<00:02:56.780> it's<00:02:57.049> all

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
frontal friction is nice it's all

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.009 
frontal friction is nice it's all
businesslike<00:02:57.890> welter<00:02:58.489> hand<00:02:58.760> and<00:02:59.630> of<00:02:59.810> course

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:00.019 
businesslike welter hand and of course

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:03.400 
businesslike welter hand and of course
that<00:03:00.730> allows<00:03:01.730> sufficient<00:03:02.450> space<00:03:02.810> for<00:03:02.870> what<00:03:03.260> is

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
that allows sufficient space for what is

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.690 
that allows sufficient space for what is
perhaps<00:03:03.760> the<00:03:04.760> best<00:03:05.049> comparative<00:03:06.049> feature

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
perhaps the best comparative feature

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.539 
perhaps the best comparative feature
cockpit<00:03:07.700> wise<00:03:07.880> between<00:03:08.480> the<00:03:08.989> 109<00:03:09.440> and<00:03:09.650> spit<00:03:09.950> in

00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:10.549 
cockpit wise between the 109 and spit in

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:12.490 
cockpit wise between the 109 and spit in
that<00:03:10.790> the<00:03:11.000> undercarriage<00:03:11.540> controls<00:03:12.230> are

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
that the undercarriage controls are

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.130 
that the undercarriage controls are
nicely<00:03:12.799> to<00:03:13.160> hand<00:03:13.459> just<00:03:14.150> in<00:03:14.329> front<00:03:14.600> of<00:03:14.810> the

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140 
nicely to hand just in front of the

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.140 
nicely to hand just in front of the
throttle<00:03:15.470> controls<00:03:15.980> and<00:03:16.250> do<00:03:16.519> not<00:03:16.760> require

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
throttle controls and do not require

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.930 
throttle controls and do not require
that<00:03:17.510> one<00:03:18.230> changes<00:03:18.799> hands<00:03:19.040> immediately<00:03:19.670> after

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
that one changes hands immediately after

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.509 
that one changes hands immediately after
takeoff<00:03:20.329> blind<00:03:21.110> flying<00:03:21.320> panel<00:03:21.890> given<00:03:22.370> that

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:22.519 
takeoff blind flying panel given that

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:24.340 
takeoff blind flying panel given that
it's<00:03:22.700> not<00:03:23.120> particularly<00:03:23.540> familiar<00:03:23.810> to<00:03:24.260> me

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:24.350 
it's not particularly familiar to me

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:26.949 
it's not particularly familiar to me
looks<00:03:24.590> ok<00:03:24.980> and<00:03:25.010> I<00:03:25.160> particularly<00:03:25.640> like<00:03:26.420> the

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 
looks ok and I particularly like the

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:29.740 
looks ok and I particularly like the
artificial<00:03:27.470> horizon<00:03:27.670> one<00:03:28.670> can<00:03:28.910> cage<00:03:29.209> it<00:03:29.480> and

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:29.750 
artificial horizon one can cage it and

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:32.490 
artificial horizon one can cage it and
thereby<00:03:30.320> keep<00:03:31.310> it<00:03:31.459> from

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
thereby keep it from

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.350 
thereby keep it from
in<00:03:32.590> toppling<00:03:33.130> during<00:03:33.520> heavy<00:03:33.700> maneuver<00:03:34.210> or

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:34.360 
in toppling during heavy maneuver or

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.360 
in toppling during heavy maneuver or
possibly<00:03:34.810> even<00:03:35.110> faster<00:03:35.560> ected<00:03:35.890> afterwards

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
possibly even faster ected afterwards

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.640 
possibly even faster ected afterwards
it's<00:03:36.580> a<00:03:36.970> much<00:03:37.390> more<00:03:37.600> businesslike<00:03:38.050> instrument

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
it's a much more businesslike instrument

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.160 
it's a much more businesslike instrument
than<00:03:38.800> Spitfires<00:03:39.510> there<00:03:40.510> is<00:03:40.600> then<00:03:40.780> of<00:03:40.930> course

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.170 
than Spitfires there is then of course

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:43.470 
than Spitfires there is then of course
the<00:03:41.770> breech<00:03:42.280> of<00:03:42.520> the<00:03:42.610> cannon<00:03:42.970> which<00:03:43.150> fires

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
the breech of the cannon which fires

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.980 
the breech of the cannon which fires
through<00:03:44.470> the<00:03:44.650> spinner<00:03:45.360> which<00:03:46.360> seems<00:03:46.660> to<00:03:46.780> take

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:46.990 
through the spinner which seems to take

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:50.750 
through the spinner which seems to take
up<00:03:47.170> quite<00:03:47.410> inordinate<00:03:47.890> amounts<00:03:48.400> of<00:03:48.520> room<00:03:48.959> the

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
up quite inordinate amounts of room the

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.040 
up quite inordinate amounts of room the
engine<00:03:51.760> gauges<00:03:52.150> and<00:03:52.240> fuel<00:03:52.480> gauge<00:03:52.720> quite

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:53.050 
engine gauges and fuel gauge quite

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:56.550 
engine gauges and fuel gauge quite
reasonably<00:03:53.560> easy<00:03:53.830> to<00:03:54.010> read<00:03:55.200> but<00:03:56.200> other<00:03:56.350> than

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
reasonably easy to read but other than

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:01.199 
reasonably easy to read but other than
that<00:03:57.330> it's<00:03:58.330> I<00:03:59.190> must<00:04:00.190> return<00:04:00.580> to<00:04:00.640> my<00:04:00.940> previous

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:01.209 
that it's I must return to my previous

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:03.720 
that it's I must return to my previous
verdict<00:04:01.900> on<00:04:02.050> it<00:04:02.170> it<00:04:02.320> is<00:04:02.470> unbelievably<00:04:03.430> small

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 
verdict on it it is unbelievably small

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:06.300 
verdict on it it is unbelievably small
unbelievably<00:04:04.630> cramped<00:04:05.200> and<00:04:05.890> I<00:04:06.010> certainly

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
unbelievably cramped and I certainly

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.570 
unbelievably cramped and I certainly
wouldn't<00:04:06.730> care<00:04:07.060> to<00:04:07.150> go<00:04:07.270> to<00:04:07.330> war<00:04:07.630> in<00:04:07.810> it<00:04:08.580> given

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:09.580 
wouldn't care to go to war in it given

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:12.030 
wouldn't care to go to war in it given
the<00:04:09.760> knowledge<00:04:09.940> that<00:04:10.180> the<00:04:10.390> opposition<00:04:11.320> was

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 
the knowledge that the opposition was

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.130 
the knowledge that the opposition was
equipped<00:04:12.370> with<00:04:12.430> a<00:04:12.550> Spitfire<00:04:13.000> I<00:04:13.270> think<00:04:14.050> it

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:14.140 
equipped with a Spitfire I think it

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:16.320 
equipped with a Spitfire I think it
stopped
