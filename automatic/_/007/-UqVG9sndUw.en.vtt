levels in the game normally the water

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.100 
levels in the game normally the water
level<00:01:20.850> is<00:01:20.970> bad<00:01:21.210> either<00:01:21.509> because<00:01:21.869> just

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
level is bad either because just

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.090 
level is bad either because just
controls<00:01:22.560> poorly<00:01:23.159> or<00:01:23.369> really<00:01:23.759> slowly<00:01:24.119> or<00:01:25.100> you

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
controls poorly or really slowly or you

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.620 
controls poorly or really slowly or you
know<00:01:26.220> alternatively<00:01:27.000> it's<00:01:27.210> just<00:01:27.390> super

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
know alternatively it's just super

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.149 
know alternatively it's just super
difficult<00:01:28.080> as<00:01:28.200> they'll<00:01:28.350> find<00:01:28.560> like<00:01:28.799> a<00:01:28.829> teenage

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
difficult as they'll find like a teenage

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.830 
difficult as they'll find like a teenage
Ninja<00:01:29.460> Turtle<00:01:29.880> games<00:01:30.060> and<00:01:30.299> actually<00:01:30.570> some<00:01:30.810> of

hindsight does do kind of look like

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.390 
hindsight does do kind of look like
fireballs<00:03:23.840> maybe<00:03:24.840> the<00:03:25.620> most<00:03:25.829> flaming

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400

what<00:03:27.930> I'm<00:03:28.019> saying<00:03:29.420> now<00:03:30.420> we've<00:03:30.540> got<00:03:30.690> stingrays

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
what I'm saying now we've got stingrays

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.080 
what I'm saying now we've got stingrays
in<00:03:31.319> their<00:03:31.620> natural<00:03:31.799> habitat<00:03:32.489> I<00:03:32.519> guess<00:03:32.760> how<00:03:33.060> big

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
in their natural habitat I guess how big

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.000 
in their natural habitat I guess how big
is<00:03:33.480> this<00:03:33.600> whale<00:03:33.900> that<00:03:34.109> it<00:03:34.230> actually<00:03:34.380> houses

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
is this whale that it actually houses

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:36.559 
is this whale that it actually houses
like<00:03:35.190> an<00:03:35.310> entire<00:03:35.549> ecosystem<00:03:35.819> there's

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:36.569 
like an entire ecosystem there's

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:39.289 
like an entire ecosystem there's

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
the stingrays not really a problem but

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:18.240 
the stingrays not really a problem but
the<00:04:15.879> electric<00:04:16.269> eels<00:04:16.540> can<00:04:17.139> sort<00:04:17.889> of<00:04:18.010> be<00:04:18.220> a

start with and I'm actually at zero

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:46.610 
start with and I'm actually at zero
right<00:04:45.250> now<00:04:45.400> I<00:04:45.520> should<00:04:45.850> probably<00:04:45.970> be<00:04:46.180> careful

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 
right now I should probably be careful

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.650 
right now I should probably be careful
and<00:04:47.620> only<00:04:48.310> three<00:04:48.669> continues<00:04:49.120> as<00:04:49.270> well<00:04:49.449> but<00:04:49.600> I'm

are gonna go down relatively easy and
we'll<00:05:14.710> pick<00:05:14.860> up<00:05:14.919> another<00:05:15.190> extra<00:05:15.520> like<00:05:15.669> there

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:15.940 
we'll pick up another extra like there

when<00:05:21.639> we<00:05:21.669> come<00:05:21.849> next<00:05:22.090> probably<00:05:22.720> some<00:05:22.990> of<00:05:23.080> the

00:05:23.129 --> 00:05:23.139 
when we come next probably some of the

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:24.540 
when we come next probably some of the
hardest<00:05:23.169> stages<00:05:23.770> for<00:05:23.919> me<00:05:24.039> the<00:05:24.160> tree-tops

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:24.550 
hardest stages for me the tree-tops

really make sense considering we're
going<00:05:27.760> to<00:05:27.820> the<00:05:27.910> treetops<00:05:28.300> but<00:05:29.020> in<00:05:29.169> any<00:05:29.410> case

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:29.500 
going to the treetops but in any case

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:31.080
