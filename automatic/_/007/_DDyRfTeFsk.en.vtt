00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:09.240
 hello friends with you karabash 74 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.639
 and today we look at the next 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.259
 modification for the game spintires new me 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.070
 wouldn't call it very big 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:20.570
 modifications are a small addition 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:23.910
 brand new wheels for the Urals and insulation 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:28.500
 This mod also came out in my opinion yesterday or 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:30.330
 the day before yesterday here and so let's see 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.309
 its on the range because we have everything there 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:40.579
 cars are in principle we have this mod i 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:40.579
 I think that we will quickly find 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:54.879
 so what do we let us now sit down 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:58.140
 immediately to the Urals, he is most likely in the Urals 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:01:01.140
 probably we are now 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.140
 let's set 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:17.960
 so here it is our warmer game 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:20.460
 sunk at all tough so set 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.270
 by the way, I have seen such before 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.009
 insulation 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:29.240
 now very rarely meet enough 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:31.500
 You know, I often travel between cities and 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.539
 I notice well here for example 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:37.050
 Chelyabinsk region that is new Urals 

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:39.630
 when driven from the factory somewhere there on 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:42.360
 their destination is distilled i.e. 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.159
 there is a column of whole new Urals here 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:48.119
 they go there with such 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:50.520
 insulation in winter on all models they 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:55.280
 stand that is apparently a separate piece 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:58.830
 order and so and we go wheels 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:02.069
 as I understand it, and by the way of the wheels, I 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:12.170
 for some reason I do not see where they are new wheels 

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:12.170
 interesting for urala 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:21.750
 that is, as if the wheels, I do not see new 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:24.990
 wheels for Ural's probably the wheel 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:27.880
 let's move to KAMAZ and see 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:32.380
 on it or something but, in principle, to the wheel 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:34.950
 same on must not be secret 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.950
 plant 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:51.180
 what about wheels i'm not sure guys seem 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:53.520
 these wheels are nothing at all 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:59.850
 I can not understand my standard 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:03:03.770
 default wheels do not understand written for 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:07.410
 urala wheels and where 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:18.500
 if this casing we found where then 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:21.570
 wheels well these are ordinary krasowski that is 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:24.930
 honestly guys i don't see that is 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:27.420
 case to adequately adequately this when 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:31.690
 we will have a good winter that is, they will not 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:34.750
 that cream one there as it turns out 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:37.510
 Sadovsky there did through them so there 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:39.340
 redid did that winter which 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.530
 Initially, there was a normal winter 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:46.230
 I meant redone yes campaign 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:48.610
 not cry did so here he smacks again 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:50.110
 here I am because of this and did not 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:51.880
 consider that mod that is the same 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:55.810
 the german cream on the same 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:58.000
 wheels on on was called about 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:00.670
 standard rubber guys i don't know i don't 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.850
 sure that this is standard tires 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:08.020
 there is so that is declared that is me 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:10.720
 I downloaded what I needed, but I do not see any 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:12.760
 rubber actually I'll turn on the mod now 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:17.080
 of course i will see if what i am in front of 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:20.739
 I'll shoot a video but I doubt that this 

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:23.770
 what we need a case to sensible thought 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:26.440
 done very nice cool 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:29.620
 done that is, it is clear that this is not 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:31.510
 just know some texture on top 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.850
 lies and that is, it shows that 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:37.660
 as if she really is something on 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:41.350
 it pulled it is clear that some 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:43.450
 voluminous such in general so here so 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:44.350
 Here is a brief overview with you was Karabash 

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:45.940
