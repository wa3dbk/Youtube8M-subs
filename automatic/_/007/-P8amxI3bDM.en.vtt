 is andreas silly sitting at my side 

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:16.020
 the man with the head 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.060
 the striker of the competition since 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.790
 our will teaches us weeks of fear 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.200
 striker manuel schÃ¤ffler manually like 

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:24.450
 Do you have such a run now 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.400
 even historical victory against osnabrÃ¼ck 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:28.050
 the first time in the third league that 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.250
 Holstein won me 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.200
 sometimes operate yourself 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:38.699
 to blog all that takes place in the 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:40.320
 moment very well rewarded for what we do 

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:56.059
 not so successful at the beginning of the season 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:58.789
 managed now is not the 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:01.649
 championship decision in the 

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:03.030
 Going to say ten 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.860
 play before seasonal 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.310
 what 2011 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.930
 msv duisburg with cup final in berlin 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:12.480
 So you can play championship games in the 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.520
 goal- oriented cup match of this quality 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:18.060

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.460
 shoes a few more spectators was 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.850
 but I feel like a feeling function 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.280
 Games I think is something very cool 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.820
 is just about with and between 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.410
 easy on the opponent, too 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.200
 to make the fear already in advance 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:37.410
 our way of playing and we take 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:41.040

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:46.530

 from basing it if someday 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.870
