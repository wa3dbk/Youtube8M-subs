00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.180
 good friends of the channel I am animal and 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.859
 we are today in the mood guide 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:08.510
 I'm going to start by explaining the skills 

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:10.190
 let's start with the passive each time 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:12.650
 we make four spells the next 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:15.830
 spell will produce a study according 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:17.900
 you are going to see now what is 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:20.029
 studying and explaining one thing about the 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:23.720
 passive from a beginning that is 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:25.700
 very important the next topic I want 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.500
 that you know that with passion you do not 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.690
 you threw out the passive when you get out of base 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:32.419
 throw it and go to the w to go loading the 

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:33.829
 passive without spending good manna let's go 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:35.780
 integrity we have the q1 which is the 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:37.340
 disintegration is a ball of fire that 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.280
 if we killed the children we started the manna 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.270
 that we have launched is that simple 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.790
 the good thing that has stability that has 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:45.590
 very little cd compared to the others now 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.630
 let's go to the w no that's the icon 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:50.510
 disintegration I want to say that all 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:53.570
 the skills as well as the w and 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.309
 the last one if the passive is loaded the 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.050
 it blemish defect as you will see this is a 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:58.969
 cone attack and with the definitive 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.350
 sorry I wanted with the passive but theme 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:02.390
 definitive well good comes very well 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.800
 then we have a like that is the shield 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.149
 the armor was not fused 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.009
 resistance more than for five 

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:08.659
 seconds and also when they do not have 

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:09.380
 physically nothing we have magical damage to the 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:12.700
 enemies 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:16.039
 and finally we have different notivers 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:18.049
 special a powerful dean and that 

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:20.090
 when it falls towards the magic year and also 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:22.820
 every time bieber is in play you can 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.320
 hit and enemies that are close to 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.670
 he then also suffer fire damage 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:31.909
 you are going to see what the passive applied 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:33.590
 as you see in the USA I was going to kill him 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:35.689
 to handle has can also handle 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.950
 with the r and you can give the order by 

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:38.900
 example of putting it in a 7 in case of 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.380
 emergency and others 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:43.600
 and well then let's call 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:46.539
 now we go to the equipment as you know 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.810
 have and well then start with two boots 

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:50.680
 lots of life and a week 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.420
 we will start by catching the catalyst 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:55.210
 protector on the subject that does not give 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.250
 survival nothing 200 of life 300 of 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.289
 manna we need mana life every time 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.060
 that we add a level for 8 seconds 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:02.380
 this does not come very well after we 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.210
 let's see if we have the boots of 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.369
 sorcerer with the improvement you like the most 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:08.739
 so much is the fury as safe for 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:10.060
 get back faster based on these boots 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:12.250
 but a lot also for the benefit 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.630
 magic then we will really catch the 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.540
 scales of the ages have and is a 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:18.760
 character that is very easy to 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.049
 die when he has a strong hook and 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.549
 with the cheap one is going to have a 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:23.250
 little bit more survival and also 

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:25.989
 we will gain enough skill power 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.849
 then we can quickly catch the 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:29.739
 mortal hat engraved by the following 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:32.260
 we gain skill power we increase a 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:33.970
 25% can open data so ours and with 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.510
 that will do much more damage to our 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.849
 enemies 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.500
 then we will quickly catch the 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:40.299
 torment and hunger this is a subject 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.920
 quite controversial not much that tells you 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:44.769
 that the day before that does not help us anymore 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.630
 I'm going to tell you why it's 260 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:48.310
 300 chance of life penetration 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.530
 magic that is very important 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:54.910
 you in you vers when we have 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:57.760
 stivers with stun we hit more damage because 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:59.560
 the damage is prolonged because it is 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.780
 studied rentier also stronger than 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.120
 100 double is worth the damage is doubled 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.069
 duplicate make up what you see here very well 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.470
 if we hit a tibet we hit a damage 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:09.960
 duplicated enzymes tuned it and you see with 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.490
 his aura 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:13.590
 apply your mind of leandro and 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:15.510
 supposedly it's worth and well I can 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.349
 teach that applies 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.690
 slowed down the enemy and you're going 

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:22.180
 violating then apply him the centrist of 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:24.459
 riley if it applies we're going together now or 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.780
 you can make the combo run and 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:27.580
 we will also gain life power of 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.550
 skill and we will do much more damage 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:32.650
 last very situational object serves 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:34.239
 Both the sonia hourglass and the 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.650
 pincer death line that's more your 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:37.930
 election I personally just take the 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:39.610
 pincer to hit a bombshell to the last 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.620
 objective and give it everything but also 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:44.590
 serves the role of the arena of death 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:46.540
 now let's go to the skills sequence 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.640
 as you know level 1 and what we are going 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.140
 let's prioritize is going to be the cv by the 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:52.269
 subject that has very little yields and makes 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:53.860
 a lot of damage and also if we kill a child 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:56.049
 because if we kill has recovered manna 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:58.420
 changed is also worth then at level 2 if 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:04:00.190
 the second thing that we will prioritize will be the w 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.709
 for the issue of the strong damage it does and 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:03.970
 the attack in area not at level 4 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:05.590
 we will raise a truth that will not serve 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:08.049
 for when we do basic do 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:09.459
 exactly this salts base loads and 

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:11.650
 will have two charges before reaching the 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:13.750
 line in case you're charged to 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:16.600
 maximum that base do not do it staying at 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:18.549
 the cargo then we will climb different the 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:20.470
 level 6 we will respect him as always the 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:22.260
 simple combo if you have passive charged 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:24.970
 strips will have fun combo 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:27.520
 vw and the tools 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:29.020
 very well we are going now the subject of the 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.730
 runas the rune as you are seeing in 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.780
 screen we can use the great brand of 

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:32.950
 magic performance that gives us to 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.470
 magic performance against enemies 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:36.880
 we increase its magic resistance the 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:39.550
 great skill power glyph for 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:41.590
 win more skill power faucets 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:43.600
 by level that has more strength in the 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:45.160
 skate of the mid game then we also have 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.990
 the herd relationship transits for 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:48.670
 hold more the line and finally great 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:50.920
 that this essence of power skill for 

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:53.200
 win as you know the necessary appeal for 

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:56.050
 start strong now let's go to the topic of 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:56.920
 hand we will use a 2109 21 power 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.290
 of skill 

00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:01.000
 you are looking at the branch and then 29 of 

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:03.580
 utility that will serve us well for 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.110
 be fixing wins for example plus and it 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:07.000
 keep more time 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:08.320
