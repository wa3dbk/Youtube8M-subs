00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
of you know portal 2 is just filled with

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.220 
of you know portal 2 is just filled with
tiny<00:00:26.490> little<00:00:26.910> things<00:00:27.359> that<00:00:27.480> all<00:00:27.689> build<00:00:27.960> up<00:00:28.109> to

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
tiny little things that all build up to

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.990 
tiny little things that all build up to
make<00:00:28.380> a<00:00:28.410> great<00:00:28.650> game<00:00:28.830> and<00:00:29.070> so<00:00:29.550> just<00:00:29.760> really

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
make a great game and so just really

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.359 
make a great game and so just really
polishing<00:00:30.539> those<00:00:30.630> are<00:00:30.810> ok<00:00:31.710> but<00:00:31.740> there<00:00:32.160> is<00:00:32.250> more

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
polishing those are ok but there is more

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:33.830 
polishing those are ok but there is more
complexity<00:00:33.000> we've<00:00:33.180> been<00:00:33.300> playing<00:00:33.570> some<00:00:33.780> of

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
complexity we've been playing some of

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.299 
complexity we've been playing some of
the<00:00:33.899> cop<00:00:34.079> today<00:00:34.260> and<00:00:34.530> you've<00:00:34.649> got<00:00:34.800> these<00:00:34.980> you

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
the cop today and you've got these you

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.549 
the cop today and you've got these you
but<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.520> gels<00:00:35.820> and<00:00:36.180> all<00:00:36.899> of<00:00:37.050> that<00:00:37.110> so<00:00:37.410> do<00:00:37.469> you

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
but the gels and all of that so do you

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.470 
but the gels and all of that so do you
think<00:00:37.590> it's<00:00:37.739> a<00:00:37.860> trickier<00:00:38.219> game<00:00:38.489> at<00:00:38.670> all<00:00:38.760> um<00:00:39.270> so

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
think it's a trickier game at all um so

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.420 
think it's a trickier game at all um so
we<00:00:39.570> worked<00:00:39.809> really<00:00:39.989> hard<00:00:40.230> and<00:00:40.649> we're<00:00:41.219> eating

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
we worked really hard and we're eating

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.430 
we worked really hard and we're eating
testers<00:00:41.790> in<00:00:41.820> every<00:00:42.420> single<00:00:42.719> day<00:00:42.840> at<00:00:43.170> valve

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
testers in every single day at valve

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.139 
testers in every single day at valve
they're<00:00:43.860> testing<00:00:44.160> a<00:00:44.190> single<00:00:44.520> player<00:00:44.670> in<00:00:44.789> coop

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
they're testing a single player in coop

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.270 
they're testing a single player in coop
and<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.390> idea<00:00:45.629> was<00:00:45.660> to<00:00:46.020> add<00:00:46.289> flex<00:00:46.829> it<00:00:47.010> II<00:00:47.070> and

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
and the idea was to add flex it II and

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.450 
and the idea was to add flex it II and
add<00:00:47.520> tools<00:00:47.910> but<00:00:48.539> not<00:00:48.690> add<00:00:48.840> difficulty<00:00:49.379> so<00:00:50.070> you

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
add tools but not add difficulty so you

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.760 
add tools but not add difficulty so you
can<00:00:50.610> watch<00:00:50.820> a<00:00:51.030> video<00:00:51.149> on<00:00:51.629> youtube<00:00:51.690> and<00:00:52.469> see<00:00:52.620> the

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
can watch a video on youtube and see the

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.160 
can watch a video on youtube and see the
crazy<00:00:53.100> thing<00:00:53.370> someone's<00:00:53.670> doing<00:00:54.030> and<00:00:54.390> be<00:00:55.050> like

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
crazy thing someone's doing and be like

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.119 
crazy thing someone's doing and be like
I'll<00:00:55.320> never<00:00:55.500> be<00:00:55.620> able<00:00:55.680> to<00:00:55.770> do<00:00:55.890> that<00:00:56.010> but

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
I'll never be able to do that but

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.560 
I'll never be able to do that but
honestly<00:00:56.489> you'll<00:00:56.760> be<00:00:56.879> able<00:00:56.940> to<00:00:57.120> as<00:00:57.360> you

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
honestly you'll be able to as you

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.330 
honestly you'll be able to as you
progress<00:00:57.840> through<00:00:58.050> learn<00:00:58.559> how<00:00:58.770> to<00:00:58.829> do<00:00:59.039> that<00:00:59.190> so

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
progress through learn how to do that so

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.490 
progress through learn how to do that so
that<00:00:59.370> when<00:00:59.550> you<00:00:59.640> get<00:00:59.760> to<00:00:59.879> that<00:01:00.000> step<00:01:00.329> all<00:01:01.020> those

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
that when you get to that step all those

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.990 
that when you get to that step all those
things<00:01:01.770> will<00:01:01.890> come<00:01:02.039> together<00:01:02.219> and<00:01:02.670> it's<00:01:02.789> not

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
things will come together and it's not

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.630 
things will come together and it's not
difficult<00:01:03.329> for<00:01:03.600> you<00:01:03.930> it<00:01:04.080> simply<00:01:04.860> complex<00:01:05.400> for

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
difficult for you it simply complex for

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.550 
difficult for you it simply complex for
you<00:01:05.729> and<00:01:05.880> you<00:01:05.970> keeps<00:01:06.270> problem<00:01:06.720> solving<00:01:07.140> your

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
you and you keeps problem solving your

writing capacity centered on that and
how<00:01:11.760> do<00:01:11.820> you<00:01:11.939> find<00:01:12.240> writing<00:01:12.540> that<00:01:12.960> much

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
how do you find writing that much

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.230 
how do you find writing that much
dialogue<00:01:13.470> when<00:01:13.650> it's<00:01:13.770> mostly<00:01:14.189> one-sided<00:01:14.610> how

of go around and if you can't make each

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.130 
of go around and if you can't make each
other<00:01:23.340> laugh<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:24.000> problem<00:01:24.450> is<00:01:24.540> not<00:01:24.869> going<00:01:25.080> to

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
other laugh the problem is not going to

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.289 
other laugh the problem is not going to
be<00:01:25.229> good<00:01:25.350> for<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:25.770> game<00:01:25.890> as<00:01:26.070> well<00:01:26.220> and<00:01:26.549> so<00:01:27.119> it's

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
be good for the game as well and so it's

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:28.910 
be good for the game as well and so it's
really<00:01:27.360> keeping<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:27.840> intensity<00:01:28.350> up<00:01:28.470> and<00:01:28.710> just

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
really keeping the intensity up and just

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.069 
really keeping the intensity up and just
working<00:01:29.369> it<00:01:29.579> through<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:30.420> thing<00:01:30.810> of<00:01:30.930> course

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
working it through the thing of course

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
so similar actually to the original

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:00.660 
so similar actually to the original
portal<00:02:58.600> team<00:02:58.780> we<00:02:59.560> had<00:02:59.650> this<00:02:59.769> team<00:03:00.100> cult<00:03:00.370> of<00:03:00.609> the

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
portal team we had this team cult of the

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.050 
portal team we had this team cult of the
paint<00:03:01.000> team<00:03:01.180> and<00:03:01.420> there<00:03:01.989> they<00:03:02.799> were

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
paint team and there they were

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.699 
paint team and there they were
seattle-based<00:03:04.060> students<00:03:04.900> and<00:03:05.290> they<00:03:05.380> come<00:03:05.590> up

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
seattle-based students and they come up

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:07.710 
seattle-based students and they come up
with<00:03:05.739> this<00:03:05.859> really<00:03:06.280> cool<00:03:06.489> concept<00:03:06.730> and<00:03:07.239> at

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
with this really cool concept and at

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.949 
with this really cool concept and at
first<00:03:08.380> we<00:03:08.890> kind<00:03:09.400> of<00:03:09.459> struggle<00:03:10.299> with<00:03:10.390> what<00:03:10.810> it

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
first we kind of struggle with what it

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:12.090 
first we kind of struggle with what it
all<00:03:11.079> means<00:03:11.260> and<00:03:11.410> then<00:03:11.560> it<00:03:11.709> really<00:03:11.859> became

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:12.100 
all means and then it really became

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.819 
all means and then it really became
clearer<00:03:12.489> portal<00:03:13.209> one<00:03:13.390> was<00:03:13.900> about<00:03:14.019> surfaces

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:14.829 
clearer portal one was about surfaces

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:15.960 
clearer portal one was about surfaces
and<00:03:14.950> you<00:03:15.040> look<00:03:15.160> at<00:03:15.280> surfing<00:03:15.609> I<00:03:15.700> could<00:03:15.820> put<00:03:15.940> a

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
and you look at surfing I could put a

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:17.849 
and you look at surfing I could put a
pole<00:03:16.150> there<00:03:16.359> I<00:03:16.390> kampra<00:03:16.780> portal<00:03:17.079> there<00:03:17.230> what

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:17.859 
pole there I kampra portal there what

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:19.620

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:21.820 
you can look at a surface and go okay I

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:23.009 
you can look at a surface and go okay I
can't<00:03:22.150> put<00:03:22.269> a<00:03:22.299> portal<00:03:22.630> there<00:03:22.720> but<00:03:22.870> I<00:03:22.900> can

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:23.019 
can't put a portal there but I can

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:24.150 
can't put a portal there but I can
change<00:03:23.200> the<00:03:23.290> properties<00:03:23.530> of<00:03:23.739> that<00:03:23.920> surface

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
change the properties of that surface

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.180 
change the properties of that surface
and<00:03:24.640> so<00:03:25.239> that<00:03:25.750> just<00:03:26.530> changes<00:03:26.920> the<00:03:27.010> way<00:03:27.160> you

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
and so that just changes the way you

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.550 
and so that just changes the way you
look<00:03:27.400> at<00:03:27.519> puzzles<00:03:27.910> and<00:03:28.120> you<00:03:28.930> can<00:03:29.079> I<00:03:29.109> can<00:03:29.410> say

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:38.859 
have more complexity the puzzle than

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:40.740 
have more complexity the puzzle than
there<00:03:39.010> is<00:03:39.040> with<00:03:39.850> really<00:03:40.120> with<00:03:40.269> the<00:03:40.329> paint<00:03:40.569> like
