00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:12.920 
will do the trick and I can just kind of

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.639 
will do the trick and I can just kind of
sand<00:01:13.159> it<00:01:13.310> down<00:01:14.260> so

00:01:16.639 --> 00:01:16.649 
sand it down so

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:20.359 
sand it down so
I've<00:01:17.159> got<00:01:17.399> like<00:01:17.579> my<00:01:17.640> mixing<00:01:18.210> bowl<00:01:18.619> and<00:01:19.619> a

00:01:24.169 --> 00:01:24.179 
butter knife to spread it and I'm just

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:28.580 
butter knife to spread it and I'm just
going<00:01:24.299> to<00:01:24.329> go<00:01:24.479> for<00:01:24.780> it<00:01:24.899> so<00:01:27.079> you<00:01:28.079> know<00:01:28.200> I<00:01:28.229> can't

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
going to go for it so you know I can't

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.919 
going to go for it so you know I can't
make<00:01:28.649> it<00:01:28.890> anywhere<00:01:29.189> I<00:01:29.520> mean<00:01:30.000> generally

00:01:30.919 --> 00:01:30.929 
make it anywhere I mean generally

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:31.999 
make it anywhere I mean generally
speaking<00:01:30.960> you'd<00:01:31.439> want<00:01:31.649> to<00:01:31.710> use<00:01:31.829> like<00:01:31.950> a

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
speaking you'd want to use like a

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.919 
speaking you'd want to use like a
fiberglass<00:01:32.610> repair<00:01:33.060> kit<00:01:33.299> for<00:01:33.509> this<00:01:33.689> kind<00:01:33.899> of

00:01:33.919 --> 00:01:33.929 
fiberglass repair kit for this kind of

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:36.380 
fiberglass repair kit for this kind of
thing<00:01:34.200> but<00:01:34.670> it's<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:35.759> middle<00:01:36.060> of<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.179> summer

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
thing but it's the middle of the summer

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.660 
thing but it's the middle of the summer
I<00:01:36.509> don't<00:01:36.750> have<00:01:36.869> a<00:01:36.899> time<00:01:37.229> energy<00:01:37.890> or<00:01:38.130> the

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
I don't have a time energy or the

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.130 
I don't have a time energy or the
know-how<00:01:38.880> so<00:01:40.399> this<00:01:41.399> is<00:01:41.549> what<00:01:41.700> I'm<00:01:41.819> doing<00:01:42.030> and<00:01:42.359> I

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
know-how so this is what I'm doing and I

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.469 
know-how so this is what I'm doing and I
think<00:01:43.200> it'll<00:01:43.530> be<00:01:43.679> just<00:01:43.890> fine

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 
think it'll be just fine

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:48.469 
think it'll be just fine
anyway<00:01:45.479> this<00:01:45.569> next<00:01:45.899> video<00:01:46.140> will<00:01:46.590> be<00:01:47.390> after<00:01:48.390> I'm

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
anyway this next video will be after I'm

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.510 
anyway this next video will be after I'm
done<00:01:48.659> with<00:01:48.840> this<00:01:49.020> mess<00:01:49.319> okay<00:01:50.390> step<00:01:51.390> two<00:01:52.520> take

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
done with this mess okay step two take

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.940 
done with this mess okay step two take
this<00:01:53.729> thing<00:01:53.970> all<00:01:54.179> catched<00:01:54.929> up<00:01:56.030> sort<00:01:57.030> of<00:01:57.179> I<00:01:57.950> mean

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
this thing all catched up sort of I mean

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.039 
this thing all catched up sort of I mean
it<00:01:59.250> doesn't<00:01:59.399> look<00:01:59.610> pretty<00:01:59.819> right<00:02:00.060> now<00:02:00.239> anyways

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
it doesn't look pretty right now anyways

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.859 
it doesn't look pretty right now anyways
what's<00:02:01.289> that<00:02:01.469> hardens<00:02:01.829> up<00:02:02.539> I'll<00:02:03.539> be<00:02:03.689> able<00:02:03.750> to

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
what's that hardens up I'll be able to

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.709 
what's that hardens up I'll be able to
sand<00:02:04.200> that<00:02:04.349> smooth<00:02:05.239> it<00:02:06.239> won't<00:02:06.479> match<00:02:06.689> the

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
sand that smooth it won't match the

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:10.279 
sand that smooth it won't match the
color<00:02:07.200> but<00:02:08.329> I'm<00:02:09.329> willing<00:02:09.660> to<00:02:09.690> bet<00:02:09.899> it's<00:02:10.110> going

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
color but I'm willing to bet it's going

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.170 
color but I'm willing to bet it's going
to<00:02:10.349> do<00:02:10.470> just<00:02:10.769> fine<00:02:10.860> to<00:02:11.190> keep<00:02:11.340> the<00:02:11.549> water<00:02:11.819> out<00:02:11.940> of

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
to do just fine to keep the water out of

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.750 
to do just fine to keep the water out of
there

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
there

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:19.400 
there
so<00:02:14.760> anyways<00:02:15.629> next<00:02:16.079> video<00:02:16.470> will<00:02:16.799> be<00:02:16.829> a<00:02:18.410> smooth

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
so anyways next video will be a smooth

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.849 
so anyways next video will be a smooth
sandy<00:02:19.890> surface<00:02:20.129> I<00:02:20.489> suppose<00:02:21.350> it<00:02:22.350> still<00:02:22.650> doesn't

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:22.859 
sandy surface I suppose it still doesn't

00:02:22.859 --> 00:02:28.520 
sandy surface I suppose it still doesn't
look<00:02:23.069> pretty<00:02:23.340> but<00:02:24.049> there<00:02:25.049> it<00:02:25.170> is<00:02:27.380> and<00:02:28.380> as<00:02:28.500> far

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
look pretty but there it is and as far

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.900 
look pretty but there it is and as far
as<00:02:28.739> the<00:02:28.920> rock<00:02:29.130> not<00:02:30.120> going<00:02:30.389> anywhere

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
as the rock not going anywhere

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:38.690 
as the rock not going anywhere
anyways

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.760
