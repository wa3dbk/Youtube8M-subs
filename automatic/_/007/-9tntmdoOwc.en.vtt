00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:06.470
 The fluttering is Sweden's highest-priced street 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:12.440
 Street was completed in 1938. Until then, there was only one trick ride 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.500
 Fehr keeps and hikes people 

00:00:16.339 --> 00:00:20.480
 The view of Flattr Öl on the mountains is impressive 

00:00:20.479 --> 00:00:24.380
 In a circle, you're attracted to all that would be neither Clapton 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:25.470
 the DAX 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:26.550
 Mr. boys 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.550
 would make beautiful and worthwhile 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.390
 The road is in high risk of being in strong wind and weather 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.490
 closed is therefore there are such signs 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:44.280
 the one many miles forecasts if you have to take another path 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.210
 Now we drive from the south to the plateau gaps 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.740
 It goes exactly seven kilometers in Märkischen clock grade 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.530
 You always think you are almost at the top, but then it's just the one 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:01.550
 next hurdle 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:03.620
 then we can see the wind more easily 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:05.730
 the view is severely limited 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:08.730
 Clearing services are on the way throughout winter 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:16.000
 in winter, the street is basically closed from 22:00 to 6:00 in the morning 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.520
 until the 80s, the street was from November to May 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.120
 permanently locked 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:26.280
 because the road shortened the way south by one hour you have great 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.280
 Efforts have been made to keep them open in the winter 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:33.700
 Of course it makes a big difference for the tourism industry 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.430
 the way south of Sweden is one hour shorter or longer 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.350
 Dahl leads the road almost only about free-profi-eleven 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.760
 she used to be too fast or snowed 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.930
 after a heavy snowfall or blizzard peasant best three to four 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:50.770
 days 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:56.360
 is because the clearing forces cleared the road again since 2007 you build 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.210
 with ever greater success 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:03.060
 out of the problem snow the solution with the help of an impressively big caterpillar 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.650
 are probably built snow walls 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:13.460
 Through the tireless efforts of the ears forces is the road since 2007 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:16.239
 almost constantly passable 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:20.170
 Now the road is only then blocked if the through 

00:02:20.169 --> 00:02:22.159
 Snow driving is so bad 

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:26.889
 that motorists can not see the next way Feiler and 

00:02:26.889 --> 00:02:29.889
 therefore at risk of straying from the road 

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:35.709
 the walls are about a hundred meters 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:38.499
 away from the road on both sides 

00:02:38.499 --> 00:02:41.579
 so they should break the wind from different directions 

00:02:48.419 --> 00:02:52.840
 Throughout the winters of persistent spaces, the mountains are always growing 

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:56.689
 go on and off sometime for skiers or sledging 

00:02:56.689 --> 00:02:58.430
 Pedestrian to a problem 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.750
 to the same extent, thefts have become an attraction 

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:06.199
 at the parking lot at the memorial stone stands Seeger traffic 

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:10.939
 for example, you can see how tall you are in relation to one 

00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:14.369
 vw-bus is 

00:03:14.369 --> 00:03:18.379
 and you can see how beautiful the sunsets are in calm weather
