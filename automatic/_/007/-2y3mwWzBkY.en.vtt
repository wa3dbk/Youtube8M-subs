00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
noticed that the that this seems to be

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.900 
noticed that the that this seems to be
fairly<00:00:21.900> contentious<00:00:22.470> with<00:00:23.010> people<00:00:23.519> saying<00:00:23.730> it

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
fairly contentious with people saying it

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.429 
fairly contentious with people saying it
does<00:00:24.060> people<00:00:24.600> saying<00:00:24.779> it<00:00:24.900> doesn't<00:00:24.990> and<00:00:25.380> I

does people saying it doesn't and I

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.800 
does people saying it doesn't and I
notice<00:00:25.920> at<00:00:26.160> least<00:00:26.340> according<00:00:26.609> to<00:00:26.910> my<00:00:27.240> testing

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
notice at least according to my testing

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.839 
notice at least according to my testing
and<00:00:28.050> I'm<00:00:28.410> about<00:00:28.590> to<00:00:28.650> go<00:00:28.830> through<00:00:28.859> it<00:00:29.220> decently

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
and I'm about to go through it decently

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.610 
and I'm about to go through it decently
extensively<00:00:30.420> with<00:00:31.880> my<00:00:32.880> testing<00:00:33.420> it's<00:00:33.780> both

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
extensively with my testing it's both

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.750 
extensively with my testing it's both
kind<00:00:35.610> of<00:00:35.730> true<00:00:36.000> and<00:00:36.180> kind<00:00:36.390> of<00:00:36.510> not<00:00:37.760> essentially

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
kind of true and kind of not essentially

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.240 
kind of true and kind of not essentially
it<00:00:38.820> boils<00:00:38.969> down<00:00:39.210> to<00:00:39.329> one<00:00:39.540> thing<00:00:39.800> centuries<00:00:40.800> do

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
it boils down to one thing centuries do

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.819 
it boils down to one thing centuries do
not<00:00:41.489> proc<00:00:41.910> it<00:00:42.180> and<00:00:42.440> there's<00:00:43.440> been<00:00:43.590> a<00:00:43.620> lot<00:00:43.800> of

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
the way in which it can look like this

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.139 
the way in which it can look like this
but<00:00:58.050> it's<00:00:58.230> actually<00:00:58.500> not<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.070> case<00:00:59.100> so<00:00:59.969> right

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149

the gym but it's camping that so we're

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.660 
the gym but it's camping that so we're

hatreds vendors and that's that's

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:58.070 
hatreds vendors and that's that's
because<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:56.640> hatred<00:01:56.939> spend<00:01:57.149> are<00:01:57.270> still<00:01:57.450> a

because the hatred spend are still a
century<00:01:58.619> slip<00:01:58.950> so<00:01:59.520> you<00:01:59.909> might<00:02:00.060> be<00:02:00.090> thinking

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
century slip so you might be thinking

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.719 
century slip so you might be thinking
well<00:02:00.539> maybe<00:02:00.990> it's<00:02:01.470> because<00:02:01.649> okay<00:02:02.399> it's<00:02:02.610> the

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
well maybe it's because okay it's the

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.550 
well maybe it's because okay it's the
hatred<00:02:03.060> spender<00:02:03.330> what<00:02:03.959> if<00:02:04.080> it's<00:02:04.259> just<00:02:04.350> the

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
hatred spender what if it's just the

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:11.300 
hatred spender what if it's just the
century<00:02:04.979> auto<00:02:05.250> attack<00:02:06.830> so<00:02:08.179> let's<00:02:09.950> do<00:02:10.950> this<00:02:11.130> we

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
century auto attack so let's do this we

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.100 
century auto attack so let's do this we
no<00:02:11.430> longer<00:02:11.459> have<00:02:11.970> these<00:02:12.569> six<00:02:13.290> piece<00:02:13.680> or<00:02:14.280> honors

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
no longer have these six piece or honors

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:20.520 
no longer have these six piece or honors
and<00:02:16.110> so<00:02:16.410> all<00:02:16.980> the<00:02:17.220> centuries<00:02:17.430> will<00:02:17.730> do<00:02:17.850> now

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:27.699 

we<00:02:21.530> can<00:02:21.680> find<00:02:22.780> really<00:02:23.780> helpful<00:02:26.709> attacking

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
we can find really helpful attacking

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:30.190 
we can find really helpful attacking
this<00:02:28.040> is<00:02:28.250> ferociously<00:02:28.849> is<00:02:29.299> it<00:02:29.480> best<00:02:29.720> but<00:02:30.080> we're

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
this is ferociously is it best but we're

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:43.590 
this is ferociously is it best but we're
not<00:02:30.290> saying<00:02:30.500> any<00:02:30.769> prox<00:02:31.239> of<00:02:32.239> the<00:02:32.750> gold

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.910 

I'm<00:02:58.180> going<00:02:58.390> to<00:02:58.480> switch<00:02:58.660> it<00:02:58.810> up<00:02:58.870> here<00:02:59.110> that's

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
I'm going to switch it up here that's

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.910 
I'm going to switch it up here that's
what<00:03:00.129> you're<00:03:00.280> gonna<00:03:00.400> see<00:03:00.610> some<00:03:00.640> prox<00:03:01.360> and<00:03:01.959> the

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
what you're gonna see some prox and the

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.240 
what you're gonna see some prox and the
reason<00:03:03.340> and<00:03:03.489> I'll<00:03:03.580> explain<00:03:03.879> the<00:03:04.000> reason<00:03:05.250> and

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
reason and I'll explain the reason and

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:07.740 
reason and I'll explain the reason and
the<00:03:06.340> reason<00:03:06.370> why<00:03:06.760> probably<00:03:07.300> rather<00:03:07.510> people

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
the reason why probably rather people

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.930 
the reason why probably rather people
like<00:03:08.050> the<00:03:08.500> tenth<00:03:08.680> centuries<00:03:09.129> and<00:03:09.489> in<00:03:09.580> fact<00:03:09.790> I

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
like the tenth centuries and in fact I

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.390 
like the tenth centuries and in fact I
sell<00:03:10.150> products<00:03:10.569> but<00:03:10.780> one<00:03:11.080> and<00:03:11.890> it's<00:03:12.040> because

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
sell products but one and it's because

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.270 
sell products but one and it's because
of<00:03:12.430> the<00:03:13.120> room<00:03:13.390> most<00:03:14.319> people<00:03:14.560> have<00:03:14.680> Spitfire

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
of the room most people have Spitfire

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.430 
of the room most people have Spitfire
turret<00:03:15.580> which<00:03:15.940> is<00:03:16.180> the<00:03:16.480> turbo<00:03:16.870> also<00:03:17.230> for<00:03:17.410> our

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
turret which is the turbo also for our

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.500 
turret which is the turbo also for our
homing<00:03:17.800> rockets<00:03:18.190> at<00:03:18.340> random<00:03:18.760> nearby<00:03:19.090> enemies

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
homing rockets at random nearby enemies

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:20.910 
homing rockets at random nearby enemies
for<00:03:19.780> one<00:03:19.870> hundred<00:03:20.080> twenty<00:03:20.110> percent<00:03:20.560> weapon

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
for one hundred twenty percent weapon

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.270 
for one hundred twenty percent weapon
damage<00:03:21.040> is<00:03:21.370> fire<00:03:21.610> now<00:03:22.599> with<00:03:23.170> Spitfire<00:03:23.860> turret

damage is fire now with Spitfire turret

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.479 
damage is fire now with Spitfire turret
the<00:03:24.880> interesting<00:03:25.690> thing<00:03:26.019> is<00:03:26.049> the<00:03:27.010> Spitfire

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:27.489 
the interesting thing is the Spitfire

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:29.820 
the interesting thing is the Spitfire
tour<00:03:27.730> the<00:03:28.390> the<00:03:28.690> Rockets<00:03:28.900> that<00:03:29.200> come<00:03:29.530> off<00:03:29.560> of

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:29.830 
tour the the Rockets that come off of

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:34.229 
tour the the Rockets that come off of
the<00:03:30.220> turret<00:03:31.799> they<00:03:32.799> count<00:03:33.069> as<00:03:33.190> your<00:03:33.549> damage<00:03:33.940> not

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 
the turret they count as your damage not

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:39.990 
the turret they count as your damage not
your<00:03:34.510> centuries<00:03:35.140> damage<00:03:38.400> probably<00:03:39.400> because

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
your centuries damage probably because

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.270 
your centuries damage probably because
it's<00:03:40.150> being<00:03:40.360> factored<00:03:40.870> in<00:03:40.989> it<00:03:41.170> as<00:03:41.290> two<00:03:42.190> hundred

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
it's being factored in it as two hundred

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.250 
it's being factored in it as two hundred
eighty<00:03:42.549> percent<00:03:42.849> weapon<00:03:43.420> damage<00:03:43.569> which<00:03:44.110> is

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
eighty percent weapon damage which is

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:49.350 
eighty percent weapon damage which is
based<00:03:44.470> on<00:03:44.650> whatever<00:03:45.280> your<00:03:45.730> weapon<00:03:47.010> so<00:03:48.360> and
