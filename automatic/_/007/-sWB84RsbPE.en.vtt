00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
the back there's one here here here here

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.580 
the back there's one here here here here
here<00:00:29.699> in<00:00:29.970> here<00:00:30.210> and<00:00:30.869> then<00:00:31.019> there's<00:00:31.230> one<00:00:31.380> under

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
the barcode there alright so I window

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:43.209 
the barcode there alright so I window
just<00:00:34.110> gonna<00:00:35.090> pop<00:00:36.090> the<00:00:36.270> faceplate<00:00:36.809> off<00:00:40.969> okay

00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:43.219 
just gonna pop the faceplate off okay

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:46.340 
just gonna pop the faceplate off okay
there<00:00:44.219> it<00:00:44.370> is<00:00:44.489> we'll<00:00:44.820> take<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.149> rebels<00:00:45.510> off<00:00:45.690> so

there it is we'll take the rebels off so
it's<00:00:46.469> easier<00:00:46.739> for<00:00:46.770> me<00:00:46.950> to<00:00:47.039> solder<00:00:49.700> okay<00:00:50.700> I

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
it's easier for me to solder okay I

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.040 
it's easier for me to solder okay I
don't<00:00:51.239> know<00:00:51.300> if<00:00:51.390> you'll<00:00:51.539> be<00:00:51.660> able<00:00:51.690> to<00:00:51.840> see<00:00:52.020> it

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
don't know if you'll be able to see it

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.500 
don't know if you'll be able to see it
but<00:00:52.170> there's<00:00:52.760> four<00:00:53.760> pins<00:00:54.059> under<00:00:54.390> this

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
but there's four pins under this

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.619 
but there's four pins under this
resistor<00:00:55.079> here<00:00:55.550> you're<00:00:56.550> positive<00:00:56.850> goes<00:00:57.480> to

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
resistor here you're positive goes to

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.869 
resistor here you're positive goes to
the<00:00:57.719> one<00:00:57.960> closest<00:00:58.590> to<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.800> analog<00:00:59.250> stick<00:00:59.280> and

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
the one closest to the analog stick and

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.360 
the one closest to the analog stick and
you're<00:01:00.870> negative<00:01:01.020> goes<00:01:01.469> all<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:01.739> way<00:01:01.920> closest

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
you're negative goes all the way closest

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.530 
you're negative goes all the way closest
to<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.640> deep<00:01:02.850> end<00:01:04.070> alright<00:01:05.070> so<00:01:05.400> my<00:01:06.030> ribs<00:01:06.270> my

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
to the deep end alright so my ribs my

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.870 
to the deep end alright so my ribs my
positive<00:01:07.020> my<00:01:07.560> blacks<00:01:07.830> my<00:01:08.010> negative<00:01:08.430> already

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
positive my blacks my negative already

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.200 
positive my blacks my negative already
have<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.150> LED<00:01:09.299> Trotter<00:01:09.810> dog<00:01:10.970> so<00:01:11.970> I'm<00:01:12.060> just

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
have the LED Trotter dog so I'm just

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.380 
have the LED Trotter dog so I'm just
going<00:01:12.330> to<00:01:12.390> put<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.689> battery<00:01:13.110> in<00:01:13.200> I<00:01:14.119> can<00:01:15.119> find

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
going to put the battery in I can find

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:29.719 
going to put the battery in I can find
it<00:01:21.770> okay<00:01:22.770> got<00:01:22.920> my<00:01:23.070> battery<00:01:23.369> pack<00:01:23.580> here<00:01:28.729> okay

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
it okay got my battery pack here okay

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.420 
it okay got my battery pack here okay
I'm<00:01:29.939> gonna<00:01:30.299> do<00:01:30.619> the<00:01:31.619> controller<00:01:32.009> doesn't<00:01:32.220> even

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
I'm gonna do the controller doesn't even

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.569 
I'm gonna do the controller doesn't even
have<00:01:32.549> to<00:01:32.640> be<00:01:32.729> on<00:01:33.000> for<00:01:33.270> this<00:01:33.360> point<00:01:34.040> so<00:01:35.040> I'm<00:01:35.400> just

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
have to be on for this point so I'm just

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:36.980 
have to be on for this point so I'm just
going<00:01:35.729> to<00:01:35.790> touch<00:01:36.060> them<00:01:36.299> to<00:01:36.420> a<00:01:36.450> point<00:01:36.750> and

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
going to touch them to a point and

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.789 
going to touch them to a point and
you'll<00:01:37.110> see<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.350> LED<00:01:37.860> light<00:01:38.369> off<00:01:39.740> see<00:01:40.740> you

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
you'll see the LED light off see you

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.910 
you'll see the LED light off see you
lighten<00:01:41.040> up<00:01:41.189> there<00:01:41.810> alright<00:01:42.810> so<00:01:43.290> now<00:01:43.439> I'm
