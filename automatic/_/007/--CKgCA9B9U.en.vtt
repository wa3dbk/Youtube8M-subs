flip<00:01:47.490> videos<00:01:47.820> which<00:01:48.090> might<00:01:48.270> even<00:01:48.390> just<00:01:48.509> be

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
flip videos which might even just be

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.660 
flip videos which might even just be
easier<00:01:48.990> and<00:01:49.200> better<00:01:49.229> so<00:01:50.070> that<00:01:50.100> way<00:01:50.369> you<00:01:50.430> know<00:01:50.640> I
