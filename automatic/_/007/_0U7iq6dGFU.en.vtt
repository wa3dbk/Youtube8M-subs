00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.990
 today I will remount the application 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.119
 a wall diva poverty is true that this 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.650
 does less 6.0 + 1 and dies what is it 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.510
 it's ok paying application on cydia 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.619
 store at gun price and 9.6 is this 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.449
 that they not allow enough 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.880
 simply edit the animations for 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.289
 the banners received a notification the 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.850
 alerts like the percentage of 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.620
 batteries when you stay 20% you 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.910
 have a little warning then this title of 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.460
 alert the time we can change the 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.690
 animations as well as those of the heap 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.379
 desired hours ie the 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.270
 multitouch 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.100
 then we are here registration title here 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.500
 from the app frees up all you have to 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.910
 face he buy it installed confirmed a 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.379
 time it's done said designed rest 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.460
 springboard of your device better 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.020
 a section in the settings 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.030
 the old one we see in the settings 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.920
 to go to beaurains and die here on 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.180
 presses it if divided into three 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.739
 sections the first being the 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.149
 banner dues 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.550
 so when we got a 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.920
 notification little changed his animation 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.840
 so if we press it first 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.570
 the slide animations it's common that goes 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.409
 arrive first in match can say I 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.659
 do not want them to come out of nowhere 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.790
 of efforts ie how does the 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.070
 ios system is made from the left of the 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.380
 right from above or from below I was told 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.920
 that he's talking about the left coming towards 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.470
 the right 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.259
 so we will blow this happiness here 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.680
 and we see that the notification comes from 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.659
 left 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.610
 so we can put a fact that wants 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.470
 to say that it will happen to degrade I 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.040
 am you who decides what wanted 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.049
 do with 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.299
 then the disney animation ckac intake 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.939
 look at from the top because I have 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.470
 says slide up if I say lights down to 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.360
 see go down finally she 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.950
 always happens from the left and the 10 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.990
 may ccam animation to notification 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.810
 go away and it's walbaum now 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.729
 like this then you can put a zoom 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.380
 and we are at August where just no 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.470
 zoom this hero are trying each one putting 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.060
 as one day we see that the zoom arrives 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:59.399
 in this moment of the match we are a zoom 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.680
 bigger or even smaller like those 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.719
 this on the but by default but will 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:07.049
 simply arrive from the left 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:08.789
 the roman waves obs I support her 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:11.990
 bad deal we come back from a setting 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:14.630
 Fitness floods blew this banner 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:16.810
 pf just happened from the left does that 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:19.220
 it's not bad to customize the 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.510
 notifications that one is in water by the 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.760
 notifications center we are 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.860
 little extras here for doing in 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.080
 This celebrations purchases when little 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.480
 square with the volumes then the spring 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.910
 notification does that that's it for 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.230
 banner notifications so that was 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:33.800
 for bathers now the 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.510
 alerts 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.760
 so if we go in it's the same 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:40.160
 principle during animations we will 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.360
 put the animation bounce we go the 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.480
 leave by default 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:46.400
 wafa and is by default that gives on the 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.680
 first map by digs not on 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.820
 here default check it's like that 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.890
 that receives a notification is 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:54.680
 okay now here we'll put a 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:56.570
 headband so here is the band what is it 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.670
 it just happened from the right 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:01.070
 bounces one can put a feed 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:03.080
 it happens quietly with a gradient 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:05.210
 and we can put a game too 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:09.110
 so they will name smaller ones to 

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:12.350
 bigger like this or vice versa 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:14.180
 bigger morons like these one can 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:17.270
 just put a hundred zoom to their hands 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:20.120
 or even by default then we do is 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:24.200
 here is zoom we can put a fact too 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:25.970
 with those like this makes fasting is 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.430
 enough made choice I see almost doing 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:30.110
 all the possibilities that now has 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.270
 multi tasking then the multitasking 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:34.100
 got on the job switcher it's up to 

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:35.840
 tell the notification band but not 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:38.090
 the notification band but 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.400
 multitasking then not hurt slide 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:42.230
 nightly entertainment including wheat fai 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.090
 but default by default is like 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:45.800
 this we already see the icons 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:47.810
 when you double tap the fighter a 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:49.460
 Maintenance binds animation are 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:52.180
 mazou mines for example look good 

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:55.070
 here in hamburg we see that his brother 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:56.570
 so the zoom then be the opposite that 

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:57.020
 is going to be the biggest fight of the most 

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:58.910
 small 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:00.200
 then the animation fire is when 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:01.460
 enter the multitasking 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.110
 we see that the applications 

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:04.940
 appear under a mode of doing 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:06.860
 that is to degrade 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:09.320
 otherwise it's all to animate poverty 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:11.180
 the picture 6.0 more then for 

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:12.970
 the application an emerging will give total 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:15.080
 of three stars 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:16.609
 so why three stars because 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:19.040
 yeah that's right at the end of 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:22.880
 the application but it's just the 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:24.350
 animation changes simply its 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.139
 crate for what I will limit to 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:26.460
 stars 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:27.780
 public shay invited stolen canvases 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.949
 application mistress the right time 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.360
 in the comments below on 

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:32.009
 youtube only had me maintenance in 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.680
 star otherwise it's around apps 

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:35.729
 for your idevice 6.0 plus then I 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.110
 know it's been a long time since this 

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:38.759
 application the outputs and all the 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:40.020
 other the game is presented also know 

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:42.419
 to make a long time they're out it's 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:44.009
 to say one or two months but need to 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:45.569
 unless I make them one you have to 

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:47.669
 present these applications once 

00:04:45.569 --> 00:04:48.840
 it's a minimum done before or see
