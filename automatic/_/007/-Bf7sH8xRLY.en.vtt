boost I've got 13 CC secondaries right
now<00:04:14.449> in<00:04:14.659> 660<00:04:15.470> primary<00:04:16.070> so<00:04:16.340> I'm<00:04:16.430> gonna<00:04:16.549> replace

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:17.329 
now in 660 primary so I'm gonna replace

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:20.050 
now in 660 primary so I'm gonna replace
the<00:04:17.659> 660<00:04:18.289> primary<00:04:18.829> um<00:04:19.099> actually<00:04:19.639> I'm<00:04:19.909> going<00:04:20.000> to

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:20.060 
the 660 primary um actually I'm going to

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:21.909 
the 660 primary um actually I'm going to
leave<00:04:20.209> the<00:04:20.359> 660<00:04:20.989> s<00:04:21.049> alone<00:04:21.349> I'm<00:04:21.560> gonna<00:04:21.650> replace

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:21.919 
leave the 660 s alone I'm gonna replace

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:24.730 
leave the 660 s alone I'm gonna replace
the<00:04:22.220> 1300<00:04:23.030> secondaries<00:04:23.750> with<00:04:23.960> some<00:04:24.229> Siemens

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
the 1300 secondaries with some Siemens

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:28.689 
the 1300 secondaries with some Siemens
2400<00:04:25.570> CC<00:04:26.570> so<00:04:27.080> that's<00:04:27.260> gonna<00:04:27.380> give<00:04:28.340> me<00:04:28.460> quite<00:04:28.610> a

00:04:28.689 --> 00:04:28.699 
2400 CC so that's gonna give me quite a

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:30.580 
2400 CC so that's gonna give me quite a
bit<00:04:28.880> more<00:04:29.060> fuel<00:04:29.419> so<00:04:29.690> hopefully<00:04:30.080> I<00:04:30.110> can<00:04:30.349> squeeze

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:30.590 
bit more fuel so hopefully I can squeeze

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:33.490 
bit more fuel so hopefully I can squeeze
out<00:04:30.770> another<00:04:30.830> 75<00:04:31.729> or<00:04:31.940> 100<00:04:32.060> horsepower<00:04:32.510> right

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:33.500 
out another 75 or 100 horsepower right

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.839 
out another 75 or 100 horsepower right
now<00:04:33.710> I<00:04:33.740> diode<00:04:34.130> it<00:04:34.460> 376<00:04:35.419> but<00:04:35.720> I<00:04:35.900> ran<00:04:36.169> out<00:04:36.320> of<00:04:36.349> fuel

00:04:36.839 --> 00:04:36.849 
now I diode it 376 but I ran out of fuel

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:39.839 
now I diode it 376 but I ran out of fuel
so<00:04:37.849> hence<00:04:38.510> the<00:04:38.840> bigger<00:04:39.020> injectors

00:04:39.839 --> 00:04:39.849 
so hence the bigger injectors

00:04:39.849 --> 00:04:42.339 
so hence the bigger injectors
alright<00:04:40.849> I'll<00:04:41.000> update<00:04:41.270> you<00:04:41.479> whenever<00:04:42.020> I<00:04:42.139> get

00:04:42.339 --> 00:04:42.349 
alright I'll update you whenever I get

00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:47.830 
alright I'll update you whenever I get
some<00:04:42.860> progress<00:04:43.610> made<00:04:43.820> on<00:04:44.270> the<00:04:44.530> fuel<00:04:45.530> pumps
