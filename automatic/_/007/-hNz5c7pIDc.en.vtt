with<00:02:59.540> the<00:02:59.629> stabilizing<00:03:00.290> I'm<00:03:00.409> as<00:03:00.620> well<00:03:00.829> I

00:03:01.059 --> 00:03:01.069 
with the stabilizing I'm as well I

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:02.830 
with the stabilizing I'm as well I
actually<00:03:01.459> say<00:03:01.879> lower<00:03:02.239> the<00:03:02.420> weight<00:03:02.599> on<00:03:02.810> that

activation<00:03:04.519> yeah<00:03:05.269> i<00:03:05.870> think<00:03:06.019> the<00:03:06.260> stabilizing

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
activation yeah i think the stabilizing

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.149
