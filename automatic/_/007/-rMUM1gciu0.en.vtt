the<00:00:12.540> OP<00:00:12.630> instancing<00:00:13.140> yeah<00:00:13.769> I<00:00:13.800> think<00:00:14.010> I<00:00:14.880> think

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:15.720 
the OP instancing yeah I think I think

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.960 
the OP instancing yeah I think I think
right<00:00:15.960> now<00:00:16.139> we<00:00:16.199> have<00:00:16.650> a<00:00:16.830> lot<00:00:17.070> we<00:00:17.369> have<00:00:17.730> a<00:00:17.760> lot<00:00:17.939> of

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
right now we have a lot we have a lot of

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.020 
right now we have a lot we have a lot of
scores<00:00:18.359> and<00:00:18.689> so<00:00:19.619> you<00:00:20.280> know<00:00:20.310> get<00:00:20.580> the<00:00:20.699> scores

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:21.030 
scores and so you know get the scores

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:23.900 
scores and so you know get the scores
where<00:00:21.330> they<00:00:21.480> need<00:00:21.690> the<00:00:22.020> ball<00:00:22.230> and<00:00:22.730> get<00:00:23.730> people

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
where they need the ball and get people

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.150 
where they need the ball and get people
shots<00:00:24.750> and<00:00:25.080> I<00:00:25.230> think<00:00:25.470> that's<00:00:25.619> the<00:00:25.740> point<00:00:25.890> guard

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
shots and I think that's the point guard

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.700 
shots and I think that's the point guard
job<00:00:26.430> and<00:00:26.640> so<00:00:26.820> I<00:00:27.029> don't<00:00:27.840> need<00:00:27.990> to<00:00:28.140> shoot<00:00:28.350> as<00:00:28.529> much

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
job and so I don't need to shoot as much

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.139 
job and so I don't need to shoot as much
with<00:00:29.640> with<00:00:30.150> these<00:00:30.359> guys<00:00:30.539> coming<00:00:30.960> back<00:00:32.149> Jeremy

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.720 
and so it's not really about my flow as
it<00:04:13.989> is<00:04:14.140> about<00:04:14.320> everyone<00:04:14.920> else's<00:04:15.250> and<00:04:15.459> I<00:04:15.519> think

to have fun doing it versus feeling
pressured<00:05:06.510> to<00:05:06.750> succeed<00:05:08.900> Jeremy<00:05:09.900> even<00:05:10.080> though

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:10.140 
pressured to succeed Jeremy even though

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:11.420 
pressured to succeed Jeremy even though
you've<00:05:10.290> been<00:05:10.410> very<00:05:10.560> humble<00:05:10.950> about<00:05:11.010> all<00:05:11.310> this

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:11.430 
you've been very humble about all this

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:12.860 
you've been very humble about all this
focusing<00:05:11.970> on<00:05:12.090> a<00:05:12.120> team<00:05:12.330> success<00:05:12.690> and

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:12.870 
focusing on a team success and

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:14.810 
focusing on a team success and
everything<00:05:12.930> when<00:05:13.710> LeBron<00:05:14.010> says<00:05:14.400> this<00:05:14.730> is

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:14.820 
everything when LeBron says this is

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:16.100 
everything when LeBron says this is
probably<00:05:15.000> the<00:05:15.150> biggest<00:05:15.300> game<00:05:15.630> we've<00:05:16.080> played

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.110 
probably the biggest game we've played

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:18.140 
probably the biggest game we've played
in<00:05:16.380> a<00:05:16.500> while<00:05:16.620> most<00:05:16.920> watch<00:05:17.100> game<00:05:17.430> because<00:05:17.760> of

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:18.150 
in a while most watch game because of

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:20.330 
in a while most watch game because of
what<00:05:18.330> Jeremy<00:05:18.660> Lin's<00:05:18.840> doing<00:05:19.170> does<00:05:19.680> any<00:05:20.010> part<00:05:20.100> of

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:20.340 
what Jeremy Lin's doing does any part of

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:21.740 
what Jeremy Lin's doing does any part of
feel<00:05:20.550> a<00:05:20.580> little<00:05:20.730> bit<00:05:20.850> bigger<00:05:21.060> tomorrow<00:05:21.480> then

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:21.750 
feel a little bit bigger tomorrow then

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:28.370 
feel a little bit bigger tomorrow then
what's<00:05:22.230> been<00:05:22.410> going<00:05:22.620> on<00:05:22.680> so<00:05:22.740> far<00:05:26.930> not<00:05:27.930> not

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:28.380 
what's been going on so far not not

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:31.910 
what's been going on so far not not
really<00:05:28.890> I<00:05:29.220> think<00:05:29.730> for<00:05:29.970> us<00:05:30.120> we<00:05:30.560> want<00:05:31.560> to<00:05:31.740> make

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:31.920 
really I think for us we want to make

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:34.610 
really I think for us we want to make
sure<00:05:32.570> what<00:05:33.570> we're<00:05:33.720> thinking<00:05:33.930> about<00:05:34.230> is<00:05:34.470> we

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:34.620 
sure what we're thinking about is we

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:36.110 
sure what we're thinking about is we
want<00:05:34.800> to<00:05:34.860> build<00:05:35.040> momentum<00:05:35.160> going<00:05:35.730> into<00:05:35.940> the

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:36.120 
want to build momentum going into the

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:37.460 
want to build momentum going into the
all-star<00:05:36.240> break<00:05:36.510> and<00:05:36.870> we<00:05:37.080> want<00:05:37.260> to<00:05:37.320> make<00:05:37.440> a

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:37.470 
all-star break and we want to make a

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:39.890 
all-star break and we want to make a
push<00:05:37.740> after<00:05:38.160> the<00:05:38.310> all-star<00:05:38.460> break<00:05:38.730> and<00:05:39.090> I

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:39.900 
push after the all-star break and I

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:41.390 
push after the all-star break and I
think<00:05:40.140> this<00:05:40.290> is<00:05:40.440> a<00:05:40.470> good<00:05:40.710> opportunity<00:05:40.890> to

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:41.400 
think this is a good opportunity to

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:44.570 
think this is a good opportunity to
build<00:05:41.640> momentum<00:05:41.790> and<00:05:42.270> it's<00:05:43.200> a<00:05:43.350> big<00:05:43.560> game<00:05:43.800> don't

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:44.580 
build momentum and it's a big game don't

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:46.040 
build momentum and it's a big game don't
get<00:05:44.700> me<00:05:44.850> wrong<00:05:44.880> we're<00:05:45.300> playing<00:05:45.480> a<00:05:45.570> great<00:05:45.780> team

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:46.050 
get me wrong we're playing a great team

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:47.540 
get me wrong we're playing a great team
and<00:05:46.230> it's<00:05:46.380> going<00:05:46.500> to<00:05:46.560> be<00:05:46.710> a<00:05:46.919> good<00:05:47.310> evaluation

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:47.550 
and it's going to be a good evaluation

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:50.120 
and it's going to be a good evaluation
of<00:05:47.970> where<00:05:48.120> we're<00:05:48.360> at<00:05:48.540> so<00:05:48.780> from<00:05:49.770> that<00:05:49.800> end

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:50.130 
of where we're at so from that end

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:52.670 
of where we're at so from that end
obviously<00:05:50.760> we're<00:05:50.940> excited<00:05:51.240> and<00:05:51.600> ready<00:05:52.260> for

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:52.680 
obviously we're excited and ready for

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:55.730 
obviously we're excited and ready for
the<00:05:52.770> challenge<00:05:53.220> but<00:05:54.110> you<00:05:55.110> know<00:05:55.230> besides<00:05:55.380> that

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:55.740 
the challenge but you know besides that

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:56.750 
the challenge but you know besides that
we're<00:05:55.950> just<00:05:56.100> going<00:05:56.250> to<00:05:56.280> try<00:05:56.460> to<00:05:56.490> stay

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:56.760 
we're just going to try to stay

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:00.290 
we're just going to try to stay
consistent<00:05:56.970> and<00:05:57.660> and<00:05:58.310> you<00:05:59.310> know<00:05:59.400> I<00:05:59.430> think<00:05:59.730> we

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:00.300 
consistent and and you know I think we

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:03.590 
consistent and and you know I think we
don't<00:06:00.419> want<00:06:00.840> to<00:06:00.990> get<00:06:01.430> get<00:06:02.430> too<00:06:02.640> high<00:06:02.880> and<00:06:03.270> ready

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:03.600 
don't want to get get too high and ready

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:06.770 
don't want to get get too high and ready
for<00:06:04.190> you<00:06:05.190> know<00:06:05.310> the<00:06:05.460> the<00:06:05.970> elite<00:06:06.240> teams<00:06:06.540> and

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:06.780 
for you know the the elite teams and

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:08.870 
for you know the the elite teams and
then<00:06:06.900> lose<00:06:07.140> that<00:06:07.410> energy<00:06:07.620> against<00:06:08.460> the<00:06:08.580> you

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:08.880 
then lose that energy against the you

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:11.360 
then lose that energy against the you
know<00:06:09.000> teams<00:06:09.450> with<00:06:09.630> poor<00:06:10.500> records<00:06:10.950> and<00:06:11.100> I<00:06:11.160> think

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:11.370 
know teams with poor records and I think

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:15.890 
know teams with poor records and I think
that's<00:06:11.520> been<00:06:11.700> a<00:06:11.730> problem<00:06:11.910> of<00:06:12.210> ours<00:06:12.890> thanks
