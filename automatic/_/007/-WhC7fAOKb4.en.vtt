00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
container that I just kind of scattered

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.300 
container that I just kind of scattered
a<00:00:17.880> PC<00:00:18.240> appear<00:00:18.570> in<00:00:18.660> there<00:00:18.810> but<00:00:19.740> yes<00:00:19.980> that's

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
a PC appear in there but yes that's

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.179 
a PC appear in there but yes that's
doing<00:00:20.640> really<00:00:20.789> nice<00:00:21.470> my<00:00:22.470> spinach<00:00:22.830> is<00:00:22.949> getting

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
doing really nice my spinach is getting

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.220 
doing really nice my spinach is getting
bigger<00:00:23.340> I've<00:00:23.850> got<00:00:24.000> a<00:00:24.029> couple<00:00:24.269> of<00:00:24.449> people<00:00:25.019> ants

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
bigger I've got a couple of people ants

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.560 
bigger I've got a couple of people ants
in<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:25.410> back<00:00:25.560> they<00:00:25.800> didn't<00:00:26.150> sprout<00:00:27.150> too<00:00:27.390> well

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
I think it got too cold for them they

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.520 
I think it got too cold for them they
were<00:00:32.090> not<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.360> Holy<00:00:33.600> fueling<00:00:34.140> sprouted<00:00:36.530> that

ones<00:01:02.520> that<00:01:02.789> I'm<00:01:02.879> just<00:01:03.120> using<00:01:03.390> I've<00:01:03.780> are

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
ones that I'm just using I've are

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.479 
ones that I'm just using I've are
actually<00:01:04.589> harvest<00:01:04.949> this<00:01:05.040> a<00:01:05.100> few<00:01:05.430> times

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
actually harvest this a few times

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.840 
actually harvest this a few times
already<00:01:05.939> I<00:01:06.560> just<00:01:07.560> go<00:01:07.799> down<00:01:07.950> and<00:01:08.189> I<00:01:08.250> pick<00:01:08.700> the

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
already I just go down and I pick the

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.899 
already I just go down and I pick the
leaves<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.450> outer<00:01:09.630> leave<00:01:09.900> and<00:01:10.549> you<00:01:11.549> can<00:01:11.729> see

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
leaves the outer leave and you can see

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.000 
leaves the outer leave and you can see
how<00:01:11.939> big<00:01:12.360> they<00:01:12.570> are<00:01:12.600> there's<00:01:13.020> a<00:01:13.110> black<00:01:13.619> seated

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
how big they are there's a black seated

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.090 
how big they are there's a black seated
Simpson<00:01:14.520> and<00:01:14.909> then<00:01:15.030> there's<00:01:15.240> some<00:01:15.890> this<00:01:16.890> is

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
Simpson and then there's some this is

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.330 
Simpson and then there's some this is
Romain<00:01:17.850> and<00:01:18.530> I<00:01:19.530> guess<00:01:19.680> a<00:01:19.710> couple<00:01:19.950> of<00:01:20.189> all

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
Romain and I guess a couple of all

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.940 
Romain and I guess a couple of all
speeds<00:01:20.670> of<00:01:20.880> some<00:01:21.090> red<00:01:21.780> sails<00:01:22.170> or<00:01:22.530> something

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
speeds of some red sails or something

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.100 
speeds of some red sails or something
that<00:01:23.250> sprouted<00:01:23.700> here<00:01:24.030> so<00:01:24.299> they're<00:01:24.630> growing<00:01:24.990> as

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
that sprouted here so they're growing as

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.740 
that sprouted here so they're growing as
well<00:01:25.320> but<00:01:25.590> it's<00:01:26.159> just<00:01:26.340> a<00:01:26.430> mixture<00:01:26.700> and<00:01:27.000> I<00:01:27.570> just

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
well but it's just a mixture and I just

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.980 
well but it's just a mixture and I just
scattered<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.200> seeds<00:01:28.439> in<00:01:28.590> this<00:01:28.740> container

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
scattered the seeds in this container

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.780 
scattered the seeds in this container
early<00:01:30.990> early<00:01:31.350> early<00:01:31.380> this<00:01:31.890> spring<00:01:32.070> actually

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
early early early this spring actually

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.190 
early early early this spring actually
it<00:01:32.850> was<00:01:32.939> still<00:01:33.150> winter<00:01:33.360> time<00:01:33.689> when<00:01:33.720> I<00:01:33.930> did<00:01:34.170> it

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.310 
took those out left one lettuce plant
and<00:01:59.159> I<00:01:59.340> was<00:01:59.820> good<00:02:00.000> and<00:02:00.119> let<00:02:00.240> it<00:02:00.270> try<00:02:00.869> to<00:02:00.930> grow<00:02:01.259> to

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
and I was good and let it try to grow to

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.550 
and I was good and let it try to grow to
a<00:02:01.439> heads<00:02:01.799> and<00:02:02.070> off<00:02:02.159> let's<00:02:02.430> see<00:02:02.610> what<00:02:02.759> happens

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.039 
a heads and off let's see what happens
this<00:02:04.560> container<00:02:04.979> as<00:02:05.250> well<00:02:05.460> I<00:02:05.850> decided<00:02:06.030> I<00:02:06.750> space

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
this container as well I decided I space

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.540
