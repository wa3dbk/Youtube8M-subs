00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
 hello you love me now yes 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:05.460
 again often asked for it 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:07.410
 That's why I make more make-up 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.360
 I start now in which I give you 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.400
 my everyday make-up show my 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.559
 Currently, and I always start 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.770
 to apply to a primer 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.150
 against redness and freckles like that 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.590
 it works a bit, so I do that 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.689
 whole face if a board what 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.150
 the freckles are evenly concealed 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.920
 and redness a bit and then it is 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.680
 that just a bit more even 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.570
 about it comes a foundation I have yes 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.850
 found my absolute dream woman nation 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.020
 Although from fly I had only the sound 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.980
 oyster that was still one 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.840
 bit too dark to have to 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.360
 brighten meanwhile there is the 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.329
 lean tone and as you can see he is great 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:45.120
 mega bright and I'm so glad that 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.250
 This sound gives because you see it too 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.629
 even that is just my skin tone, the 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.700
 is totally great i love this one 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.010
 foundation and this is so great 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.780
 how do I just go on and on 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.760
 then work well with a brush 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.039
 one that keeps it even in the skin 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.770
 The whole thing is fixed then I fix 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.600
 with a transparent brother the 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.339
 I use only the whole thing 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.220
 so holds a bit fixed longer 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.920
 and to lessen the shine 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.510
 because so that the skin is something gleaming 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.310
 yes really normal but I find her 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.350
 that this strong shine for some 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.509
 products just like it brings 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.740
 absurd as if you had the extremely greasy 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.200
 skin or as if you were very strong 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.369
 Next he sweats 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.060
 I have a little threesome here now 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:29.610
 palette of alterra that I wear 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.790
 just like sunbathing smaller than bigger 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.890
 as a sign on so almost once down 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.780
 on the eyelash along the eyelashes 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.299
 his line and then upwards 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.159
 going over the lid fold over the 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.150
 lidfalte is important for keeping it 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.649
 also looks when you see the eyes 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.320
 has concluded it can not be so 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.189
 strongly on or I blinded 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.780
 it is still good 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.549
 that's just really complete 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.530
 of course, so what is the eyes 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.820
 I currently have the absolute natural 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.130
 daily does not know why 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.320
 next comes white shadow from 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.759
 schubert missing while I use the 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.689
 actually mainly for the 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.790
 eyebrows 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.710
 I keep it a bit like that 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.820
 eyebrows you can do that under the 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.229
 Apply a little bit of bow 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.460
 but also good blind again that is 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.920
 does not look so makeup then has 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:14.260
 one quite a natural one quite 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.580
 natural light spot and that stresses 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.709
 the eyebrows are very beautiful 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:21.550
 then I wear this on the 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:22.570
 inside on the highlight the whole 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.450
 just a little bit more 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:27.130
 the one has almost brighter in the eye 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.450
 eyeshadow and go outward 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.520
 then getting darker it is simply 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.660
 I find a very nice effect for 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.730
 I use the eyebrows 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.260
 eyebrow pencil from lucona i have 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.920
 now my absolute dream color 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.570
 found 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.180
 I always had the problem that the 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:40.959
 Arsonist when very strong red sting 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.630
 I think I have 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:45.040
 and this he has his matter effect 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.570
 the so brown 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.360
 horrible and that is a command 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:50.770
 of course, as this redstitch and me 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.030
 I really like that so much 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:53.980
 Eyebrows just a bit 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.320
 on and should be so a bit 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:03:00.160
 through then ties the next 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:03.160
 response league in the tone to edelbitter 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:07.239
 write and control mine 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:10.030
 my face first of all the big ones 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:11.440
 points and that's what I give it that way 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.680
 bit on it and he was still very 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.580
 I have to eat the dark food very much 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.709
 make it really natural 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.330
 looks for the rest of the face 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:20.080
 I use that all brother would be the 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.880
 brightest tone 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.170
 that is too dark for my face 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.760
 but only slightly too dark 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.110
 that's why it's good for that 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.049
 face something to control though 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:31.120
 not so strong just because this sound sway 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:33.840
 but it is very dark I use 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:36.970
 but like one for the nose and that 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.590
 I wear then as I said outside on the 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.640
 makes it all a little bit 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.320
 I became that narrower now actually 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.340
 not really intend my nose 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.450
 is not too thick now 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.130
 or too wide 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.380
 but I just feel good when 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:49.060
 the face is shaped like that 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:50.799
 and then you have to really but very 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.790
 well so it does not look blind 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:53.110
 as if you were left and right 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:57.700
 just two thick brown stripes 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:59.330
 painted and, as I said, good blind 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:00.290
 next 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:03.050
 i will use mine again 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:05.900
 transparent powder around the places below 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:08.570
 the eye looks chic Bonn that the 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:10.730
 The forehead of the forehead lightly the child 

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:13.640
 slightly and slightly above the lips 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:15.890
 too hey people what you actually need 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.970
 if you are pale but it is somehow 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:19.130
 a tip from me but I do not know 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:22.430
 always does after that time as 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:24.800
 Next comes the mascara 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:26.210
 I like to use waterproof mascara 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.070
 simply because I have very sensitive eyes 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:29.630
 I would like to have tears 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:32.240
 when the sun is beating, however 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:33.770
 dazzle or in winter by the 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.940
 cold winter but also in training 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.040
 actually all the time I need 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:38.360
 Definitely waterproof I'll pack 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:40.670
 Of course all the products I have here 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.750
 use with name shade and so on 

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:43.130
 on the brush I have in the 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:44.960
 description so you know exactly what 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:47.110
 something was what it looks like and so on 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:49.610
 so do not worry 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:52.010
 yes, mascara, that's me, actually 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:53.750
 dear black mask even if it is yes 

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:55.460
 Relatively natural is the make up 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:58.700
 I think black things are easy 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:00.320
 better than brown and mascara order 

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:02.420
 It always lasts forever because of me 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:03.890
 really catch every single eyelash 

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:06.470
 So I want the smallest ones 

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:08.690
 hidden eyelashes in the corner of your eye 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:10.220
 and I think lashes make up lasts 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:12.740
 with me longer than the complete other 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:14.450
 catch up heek I'm easy 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:18.520
 totally fussy about my eyelashes 

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:21.020
 everything must be 100% accurate and with me 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:23.980
 I just no longer sit like it that way 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:26.390
 glued and I'm really scary there 

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:29.000
 fussy if that happens at some point 

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:30.410
 I'm done with the eyelashes then 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.060
 actually almost done 

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:35.210
 You see, it looks relatively natural 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:37.100
 you do not look right make-up 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:39.260
 out to the eyes of course then 

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:41.660
 Sometimes I still catch my name 

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:44.240
 nose the name back something to highlight 

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:47.380
 namely with the alverde camouflage but 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:47.380
 yes, that was it , too 

00:05:48.059 --> 00:05:51.610
