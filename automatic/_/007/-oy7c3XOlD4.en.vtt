more<00:02:06.600> hopefully<00:02:07.320> in<00:02:07.469> competition<00:02:08.340> and

more hopefully in competition and

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.720 
more hopefully in competition and

a<00:02:26.340> funny<00:02:27.060> story<00:02:27.450> when<00:02:27.630> I<00:02:27.690> first<00:02:28.050> spawned<00:02:28.470> on

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
a funny story when I first spawned on

a funny story when I first spawned on
this<00:02:28.830> map<00:02:29.010> as<00:02:29.220> a<00:02:29.250> terrorist<00:02:29.610> I<00:02:29.910> was<00:02:30.360> looking<00:02:30.600> at

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
this map as a terrorist I was looking at

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:31.700 
this map as a terrorist I was looking at
the<00:02:30.810> writing<00:02:31.110> on<00:02:31.230> the<00:02:31.320> wall

the writing on the wall

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:33.800 
the writing on the wall
I<00:02:31.740> asked<00:02:32.370> FM<00:02:32.670> pone<00:02:32.910> what<00:02:33.120> language<00:02:33.510> it<00:02:33.660> was

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
I asked FM pone what language it was

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.720 
I asked FM pone what language it was
because<00:02:34.170> I<00:02:34.260> didn't<00:02:34.770> want<00:02:34.800> to<00:02:34.950> sound<00:02:35.040> stupid<00:02:35.370> as

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
because I didn't want to sound stupid as

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.640 
because I didn't want to sound stupid as
soon<00:02:36.330> as<00:02:36.480> I<00:02:36.570> asked<00:02:36.840> the<00:02:36.900> question<00:02:37.290> I<00:02:37.410> turned

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
soon as I asked the question I turned

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.110 
soon as I asked the question I turned
around<00:02:37.830> and<00:02:38.310> it<00:02:39.300> became<00:02:39.690> painfully<00:02:39.990> obvious

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
around and it became painfully obvious

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.570 
around and it became painfully obvious
the<00:02:42.120> map<00:02:42.330> has<00:02:42.540> a<00:02:42.570> smooth<00:02:43.140> modern<00:02:43.980> look<00:02:44.220> to<00:02:44.250> it<00:02:44.400> I

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
the map has a smooth modern look to it I

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:45.950 
the map has a smooth modern look to it I
almost<00:02:44.730> expect<00:02:45.210> to<00:02:45.300> see<00:02:45.450> something<00:02:45.720> from

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:45.960 
almost expect to see something from

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.580 
almost expect to see something from
Calder<00:02:46.500> in<00:02:46.740> one<00:02:47.130> of<00:02:47.220> these<00:02:47.340> little<00:02:47.730> open<00:02:48.150> areas

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
Calder in one of these little open areas

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.260 
Calder in one of these little open areas
also<00:02:49.590> there's<00:02:49.830> not<00:02:49.950> a<00:02:50.010> lot<00:02:50.250> to<00:02:50.280> line<00:02:50.730> up<00:02:50.910> nades

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
also there's not a lot to line up nades

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:52.700 
also there's not a lot to line up nades
with<00:02:51.630> I<00:02:51.840> would<00:02:51.990> think<00:02:52.200> that<00:02:52.230> at<00:02:52.410> this<00:02:52.500> point

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:52.710 
with I would think that at this point

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:54.830 
with I would think that at this point
mappers<00:02:53.160> would<00:02:53.310> include<00:02:53.520> visual<00:02:53.940> cues<00:02:54.300> with

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
mappers would include visual cues with

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.420 
mappers would include visual cues with
the<00:02:54.960> idea<00:02:55.290> that<00:02:55.530> they<00:02:55.620> would<00:02:55.710> be<00:02:55.860> used<00:02:56.040> to<00:02:56.190> line

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
the idea that they would be used to line

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.100 
the idea that they would be used to line
up<00:02:56.550> smokes<00:02:56.880> and<00:02:57.090> flashes<00:02:57.600> and<00:02:57.780> that<00:02:57.870> sort<00:02:58.080> of

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
up smokes and flashes and that sort of

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.770 
up smokes and flashes and that sort of
thing<00:02:58.320> eventually<00:02:59.210> reproducible<00:03:00.210> needs<00:03:00.420> will

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
thing eventually reproducible needs will

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.470 
thing eventually reproducible needs will
be<00:03:00.810> found<00:03:01.260> but<00:03:01.860> lining<00:03:02.460> them<00:03:02.640> up<00:03:02.670> is<00:03:03.030> really<00:03:03.450> a

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
be found but lining them up is really a

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.510 
be found but lining them up is really a
chore<00:03:03.900> aspect<00:03:04.560> to<00:03:04.710> the<00:03:04.800> game<00:03:04.830> something<00:03:05.400> to

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:05.520 
chore aspect to the game something to

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.600 
chore aspect to the game something to
memorize<00:03:05.940> I<00:03:06.210> wouldn't<00:03:06.900> mind<00:03:07.110> one<00:03:07.500> bit<00:03:07.560> if<00:03:08.100> they

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
memorize I wouldn't mind one bit if they

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.880 
memorize I wouldn't mind one bit if they
were<00:03:08.670> just<00:03:08.940> visual<00:03:09.540> cues<00:03:09.960> designed<00:03:10.470> to<00:03:10.620> guide

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
were just visual cues designed to guide

the different really cool a smoke throws

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.050 
the different really cool a smoke throws
there<00:03:19.620> isn't<00:03:19.800> a<00:03:19.830> lot<00:03:20.040> of<00:03:20.070> that<00:03:20.310> here<00:03:20.550> on<00:03:20.760> this

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
there isn't a lot of that here on this

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.900 
there isn't a lot of that here on this
version<00:03:21.240> of<00:03:21.420> season<00:03:21.810> it's<00:03:22.320> almost<00:03:22.590> too<00:03:23.160> clean

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910

it<00:03:24.600> seems<00:03:25.380> a<00:03:25.500> lot<00:03:25.680> of<00:03:25.830> thought<00:03:26.040> was<00:03:26.220> put<00:03:26.400> into

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:26.460 
it seems a lot of thought was put into

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:29.210 
it seems a lot of thought was put into
making<00:03:26.850> player<00:03:27.300> models<00:03:27.780> visible<00:03:28.530> the<00:03:28.890> colors

making player models visible the colors

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:30.350 
making player models visible the colors
on<00:03:29.340> the<00:03:29.430> walls<00:03:29.640> used<00:03:30.030> the<00:03:30.180> lack<00:03:30.330> of

distracting stuff and textures really
