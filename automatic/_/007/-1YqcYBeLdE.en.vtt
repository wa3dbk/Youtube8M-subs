let's<00:04:08.530> say<00:04:08.680> for<00:04:08.829> an<00:04:08.889> example<00:04:08.919> you<00:04:09.370> want<00:04:09.579> to

00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:09.699 
let's say for an example you want to

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:12.240 
let's say for an example you want to
plant<00:04:09.970> the<00:04:10.090> bomb<00:04:10.329> on<00:04:10.659> vibe<00:04:11.379> the<00:04:11.739> first<00:04:11.979> you

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
plant the bomb on vibe the first you

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.159 
plant the bomb on vibe the first you
know<00:04:12.340> the<00:04:12.370> first<00:04:12.459> em<00:04:12.819> come<00:04:13.060> there<00:04:13.540> are<00:04:13.720> a<00:04:13.780> lot

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:14.169 
know the first em come there are a lot

00:04:14.169 --> 00:04:17.069 
know the first em come there are a lot
of<00:04:14.199> corners<00:04:14.799> in<00:04:15.040> that<00:04:15.790> that<00:04:16.180> first<00:04:16.479> room<00:04:16.870> not

00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:17.079 
of corners in that that first room not

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:18.509 
of corners in that that first room not
the<00:04:17.109> not<00:04:17.500> to<00:04:17.590> em<00:04:17.680> come<00:04:17.859> outside<00:04:18.070> the<00:04:18.370> one

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:18.519 
the not to em come outside the one

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:21.149 
the not to em come outside the one
inside<00:04:18.909> so<00:04:19.510> when<00:04:20.019> it<00:04:20.139> comes<00:04:20.289> down<00:04:20.560> to<00:04:20.620> a<00:04:20.799> lot<00:04:21.070> of

00:04:21.149 --> 00:04:21.159 
inside so when it comes down to a lot of

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:23.070 
inside so when it comes down to a lot of
people<00:04:21.280> will<00:04:21.459> more<00:04:21.699> or<00:04:21.789> less<00:04:21.880> just<00:04:21.909> run<00:04:22.479> in<00:04:22.720> or

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
people will more or less just run in or

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.379 
people will more or less just run in or
I<00:04:23.710> guess<00:04:23.800> they<00:04:24.220> would<00:04:24.370> check<00:04:24.520> two<00:04:24.849> different

00:04:25.379 --> 00:04:25.389 
I guess they would check two different

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:28.050 
I guess they would check two different
corners<00:04:25.750> and<00:04:25.930> then<00:04:26.169> run<00:04:26.349> in<00:04:26.500> but<00:04:27.370> there<00:04:27.849> might

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
corners and then run in but there might

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.450 
corners and then run in but there might
be<00:04:28.090> a<00:04:28.270> guy<00:04:28.539> in<00:04:28.900> an<00:04:29.199> awkward<00:04:29.530> position<00:04:29.949> like

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460 
be a guy in an awkward position like

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:33.510 
be a guy in an awkward position like
maybe<00:04:30.639> he's<00:04:30.820> behind<00:04:31.210> a<00:04:31.539> lamp<00:04:31.960> that<00:04:32.530> you<00:04:33.130> didn't

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 
maybe he's behind a lamp that you didn't

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:34.860 
maybe he's behind a lamp that you didn't
notice<00:04:33.849> and<00:04:34.060> if<00:04:34.150> you<00:04:34.240> were<00:04:34.330> actually<00:04:34.510> playing

it<00:04:35.050> a<00:04:35.110> little<00:04:35.169> slower<00:04:35.770> you<00:04:36.280> might<00:04:36.490> have<00:04:36.580> it

00:04:36.839 --> 00:04:36.849 
it a little slower you might have it

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:39.270

in<00:05:11.880> times<00:05:12.150> in<00:05:12.330> my<00:05:12.390> gameplay<00:05:12.780> where<00:05:12.930> I<00:05:12.990> become

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:13.620 
in times in my gameplay where I become

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:16.730 
in times in my gameplay where I become
too<00:05:13.860> aggressive<00:05:14.340> and<00:05:14.550> it's<00:05:15.390> it's<00:05:16.260> very

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:16.740 
too aggressive and it's it's very

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:18.470 
too aggressive and it's it's very
noticeable<00:05:17.340> to<00:05:17.520> me<00:05:17.550> and<00:05:17.850> when<00:05:17.940> i<00:05:17.970> noticed<00:05:18.240> that

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:18.480 
noticeable to me and when i noticed that

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:20.420 
noticeable to me and when i noticed that
i<00:05:18.810> kind<00:05:19.200> of<00:05:19.290> just<00:05:19.350> revert<00:05:19.770> back<00:05:19.800> to<00:05:20.010> playing

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:20.430 
i kind of just revert back to playing

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:22.730 
i kind of just revert back to playing
slow<00:05:20.760> so<00:05:21.690> let's<00:05:21.990> say<00:05:22.050> for<00:05:22.230> an<00:05:22.320> example<00:05:22.350> i'm

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:22.740 
slow so let's say for an example i'm

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:24.740 
slow so let's say for an example i'm
playing<00:05:22.920> a<00:05:23.010> conquest<00:05:23.370> game<00:05:23.610> on<00:05:23.880> well<00:05:24.420> let's

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:24.750 
playing a conquest game on well let's

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:26.420 
playing a conquest game on well let's
just<00:05:24.930> keep<00:05:25.110> it<00:05:25.230> consistent<00:05:25.560> savad<00:05:26.160> and

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:26.430 
just keep it consistent savad and

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:29.090 
just keep it consistent savad and
overall<00:05:27.330> i<00:05:27.570> start<00:05:27.990> playing<00:05:28.290> too<00:05:28.620> aggressively

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:29.100 
overall i start playing too aggressively

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:31.820 
overall i start playing too aggressively
and<00:05:29.340> when<00:05:29.430> i<00:05:29.460> noticed<00:05:29.700> this<00:05:30.030> i<00:05:30.270> dial<00:05:31.170> my<00:05:31.470> myself

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:31.830 
and when i noticed this i dial my myself

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:34.520 
and when i noticed this i dial my myself
back<00:05:32.220> i<00:05:32.400> try<00:05:32.880> to<00:05:32.940> force<00:05:33.390> myself<00:05:33.600> to<00:05:33.930> play<00:05:34.110> a<00:05:34.200> lot

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:34.530 
back i try to force myself to play a lot

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:36.980 
back i try to force myself to play a lot
slower<00:05:34.740> until<00:05:35.130> I<00:05:35.400> can<00:05:35.610> get<00:05:35.820> used<00:05:36.150> to<00:05:36.390> playing

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:36.990 
slower until I can get used to playing

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:39.200 
slower until I can get used to playing
faster<00:05:37.710> again<00:05:37.860> so<00:05:38.550> it's<00:05:38.850> kind<00:05:39.030> of<00:05:39.090> like

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:39.210 
faster again so it's kind of like

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:41.480 
faster again so it's kind of like
shifting<00:05:39.660> gears<00:05:39.960> in<00:05:40.170> a<00:05:40.230> way<00:05:40.380> when<00:05:41.190> you're<00:05:41.280> I

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:41.490 
shifting gears in a way when you're I

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:44.900 
shifting gears in a way when you're I
guess<00:05:41.760> I<00:05:43.100> don't<00:05:44.100> think<00:05:44.250> of<00:05:44.310> an<00:05:44.370> analogy<00:05:44.790> right

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:44.910 
guess I don't think of an analogy right

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:46.040 
guess I don't think of an analogy right
now<00:05:45.000> but<00:05:45.150> anyhow<00:05:45.390> you're<00:05:45.570> just<00:05:45.750> shifting

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:46.050 
now but anyhow you're just shifting

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:47.960 
now but anyhow you're just shifting
gears<00:05:46.290> to<00:05:46.470> a<00:05:46.500> lower<00:05:46.740> to<00:05:47.130> a<00:05:47.160> lower<00:05:47.370> level<00:05:47.640> and

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:47.970 
gears to a lower to a lower level and

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:49.940 
gears to a lower to a lower level and
then<00:05:48.300> easing<00:05:48.750> yourself<00:05:48.810> back<00:05:49.320> into<00:05:49.590> the<00:05:49.770> game

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:49.950 
then easing yourself back into the game

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:51.710 
then easing yourself back into the game
so<00:05:50.220> you<00:05:50.280> don't<00:05:50.580> get<00:05:50.820> frustrated<00:05:51.150> all<00:05:51.600> the<00:05:51.630> time

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:51.720 
so you don't get frustrated all the time

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:53.750 
so you don't get frustrated all the time
I<00:05:52.080> feel<00:05:52.380> that<00:05:52.470> a<00:05:52.530> lot<00:05:52.710> of<00:05:52.740> people<00:05:52.860> when<00:05:53.580> they

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:53.760 
I feel that a lot of people when they

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:55.640 
I feel that a lot of people when they
get<00:05:53.880> in<00:05:54.030> that<00:05:54.150> groove<00:05:54.180> of<00:05:54.720> aggressiveness<00:05:55.590> and

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:55.650 
get in that groove of aggressiveness and

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:58.280 
get in that groove of aggressiveness and
they<00:05:56.010> start<00:05:56.340> playing<00:05:56.520> bad<00:05:56.880> they<00:05:57.600> just<00:05:57.870> they
