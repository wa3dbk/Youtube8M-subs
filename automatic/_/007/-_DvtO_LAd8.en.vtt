that<00:02:29.870> the<00:02:30.200> nine<00:02:30.379> key<00:02:30.709> you<00:02:31.670> know<00:02:31.819> it'll<00:02:32.239> just

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
that the nine key you know it'll just

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.900 
that the nine key you know it'll just
you'll<00:02:33.650> be<00:02:33.800> waiting<00:02:33.980> there<00:02:34.250> for<00:02:34.280> ages<00:02:34.459> it<00:02:34.790> will

you'll be waiting there for ages it will

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:36.370 
you'll be waiting there for ages it will
last<00:02:35.060> longer<00:02:35.420> but<00:02:35.690> you've<00:02:35.840> got<00:02:35.930> to<00:02:35.960> wait<00:02:36.170> there

command and quake live scripting so

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.080 
command and quake live scripting so
basically<00:02:41.319> I<00:02:41.440> just<00:02:41.620> showed<00:02:41.860> you<00:02:41.910> quickly<00:02:42.910> then

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
basically I just showed you quickly then

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.000 
basically I just showed you quickly then
all<00:02:43.360> the<00:02:43.510> spawns<00:02:43.810> they've<00:02:44.260> all<00:02:44.410> see<00:02:44.709> all<00:02:44.860> the

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
all the spawns they've all see all the

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:46.920 
all the spawns they've all see all the
plots<00:02:45.160> of<00:02:45.280> timed<00:02:45.580> out<00:02:45.819> I<00:02:46.150> mean<00:02:46.599> that's<00:02:46.750> why

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
plots of timed out I mean that's why

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.920 
plots of timed out I mean that's why
it's<00:02:47.110> going<00:02:47.170> to<00:02:47.349> happen<00:02:47.819> so<00:02:48.819> yeah<00:02:49.360> so<00:02:49.660> nine

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
it's going to happen so yeah so nine

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.949 
it's going to happen so yeah so nine
does<00:02:50.230> that<00:02:50.470> and<00:02:50.770> now<00:02:51.670> a<00:02:51.940> is<00:02:52.239> the<00:02:52.599> air<00:02:52.690> for

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
does that and now a is the air for

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:55.559 
does that and now a is the air for
spawning<00:02:53.319> it's<00:02:53.620> not<00:02:53.950> for<00:02:54.430> spawning<00:02:54.819> button<00:02:55.330> it

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:55.569 
spawning it's not for spawning button it

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:58.740 
spawning it's not for spawning button it
just<00:02:55.900> helps<00:02:56.830> you<00:02:56.920> practice<00:02:57.340> you<00:02:58.270> know<00:02:58.390> check

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
just helps you practice you know check

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.070 
just helps you practice you know check
you<00:02:59.020> can<00:02:59.200> check<00:02:59.350> yourself<00:02:59.739> how<00:03:00.150> often<00:03:01.150> spawns

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080 
you can check yourself how often spawns

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.400 
you can check yourself how often spawns
come<00:03:02.380> up<00:03:02.530> the<00:03:03.310> best<00:03:03.780> spawning<00:03:04.780> hour<00:03:05.110> for

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
come up the best spawning hour for

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:07.890 
come up the best spawning hour for
spawning<00:03:05.769> a<00:03:06.069> weapons<00:03:06.970> are<00:03:07.180> the<00:03:07.360> plasma<00:03:07.720> gun

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
spawning a weapons are the plasma gun

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.390 
spawning a weapons are the plasma gun
and<00:03:08.200> of<00:03:08.349> course<00:03:08.590> the<00:03:08.769> railgun<00:03:09.130> because

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
and of course the railgun because

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.370 
and of course the railgun because
they're<00:03:09.610> a<00:03:09.910> little<00:03:10.120> bit<00:03:10.300> more<00:03:10.420> instant<00:03:10.900> you

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
they're a little bit more instant you

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:12.720 
they're a little bit more instant you
can<00:03:11.560> use<00:03:11.680> other<00:03:11.860> weapons<00:03:12.250> you<00:03:12.370> know<00:03:12.489> great

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
can use other weapons you know great

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.910 
can use other weapons you know great
knowledge<00:03:12.940> of<00:03:13.150> rocket<00:03:13.390> launcher<00:03:13.920> they're

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
knowledge of rocket launcher they're

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.830 
knowledge of rocket launcher they're
fine<00:03:15.160> as<00:03:15.340> well<00:03:15.519> but<00:03:15.819> I<00:03:15.970> mean<00:03:16.180> most<00:03:16.330> people

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
fine as well but I mean most people

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.750 
fine as well but I mean most people
prefer<00:03:17.049> to<00:03:17.290> you<00:03:18.010> know<00:03:18.130> zoom<00:03:18.400> in<00:03:18.549> with<00:03:18.640> the

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
prefer to you know zoom in with the

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.580 
prefer to you know zoom in with the
plasma<00:03:18.940> gun<00:03:19.269> and<00:03:19.450> then<00:03:19.540> fire<00:03:19.810> round<00:03:20.110> finish

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
plasma gun and then fire round finish

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.610 
plasma gun and then fire round finish
the<00:03:20.739> kill<00:03:20.890> off<00:03:21.040> so<00:03:21.569> pressing<00:03:22.569> 8<00:03:22.900> now<00:03:23.080> hopefully

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
the kill off so pressing 8 now hopefully

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.979 
the kill off so pressing 8 now hopefully
my<00:03:24.190> bot<00:03:24.459> will<00:03:24.850> not<00:03:25.090> spawn<00:03:25.390> at<00:03:25.480> the<00:03:25.569> top<00:03:25.750> so

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:25.989 
my bot will not spawn at the top so

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:29.520 
my bot will not spawn at the top so
press<00:03:26.230> it<00:03:26.410> again<00:03:26.709> it<00:03:27.220> again<00:03:27.340> and<00:03:28.290> just<00:03:29.290> keep

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
press it again it again and just keep

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:31.680 
press it again it again and just keep
cycling<00:03:29.830> through<00:03:30.220> there<00:03:30.430> you<00:03:30.519> go<00:03:30.700> and<00:03:31.030> there

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
cycling through there you go and there

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:35.670 
cycling through there you go and there
is<00:03:31.930> so<00:03:32.519> basically<00:03:33.519> um<00:03:33.989> the<00:03:34.989> technique<00:03:35.470> behind

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
is so basically um the technique behind

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.500 
is so basically um the technique behind
for<00:03:36.069> spawning<00:03:36.400> is<00:03:36.670> you<00:03:37.000> stand<00:03:38.850> in<00:03:39.850> a<00:03:39.940> location

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
for spawning is you stand in a location

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.710 
for spawning is you stand in a location
on<00:03:40.630> the<00:03:40.810> map<00:03:40.840> which<00:03:41.489> cuts<00:03:42.489> off<00:03:42.730> it<00:03:43.150> you'd<00:03:43.450> like

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
on the map which cuts off it you'd like

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.750 
on the map which cuts off it you'd like
you're<00:03:43.930> too<00:03:44.079> close<00:03:44.350> for<00:03:45.190> that<00:03:45.310> person<00:03:45.730> to

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
you're too close for that person to

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.830 
you're too close for that person to
spawn<00:03:46.120> a<00:03:46.420> knee<00:03:46.900> and<00:03:47.489> big<00:03:48.489> maps<00:03:48.730> like<00:03:48.940> also<00:03:49.390> you

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
spawn a knee and big maps like also you

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.990 
spawn a knee and big maps like also you
know<00:03:49.959> wide<00:03:50.670> wide<00:03:52.590> path<00:03:53.590> maps<00:03:54.160> I<00:03:54.489> guess<00:03:54.790> you'd

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
know wide wide path maps I guess you'd

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.300 
know wide wide path maps I guess you'd
say<00:03:55.410> like<00:03:56.410> is<00:03:56.590> easy<00:03:56.769> and<00:03:56.980> you<00:03:57.100> know<00:03:57.190> I'm

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
say like is easy and you know I'm

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:59.009 
say like is easy and you know I'm
looking<00:03:57.579> down<00:03:57.609> a<00:03:57.790> long<00:03:58.090> massive<00:03:58.540> corridor<00:03:58.989> I

00:03:59.009 --> 00:03:59.019 
looking down a long massive corridor I

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:00.750 
looking down a long massive corridor I
mean<00:03:59.380> that's<00:03:59.530> the<00:03:59.890> farthest<00:04:00.340> away<00:04:00.430> but

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 
mean that's the farthest away but

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.640 
mean that's the farthest away but
obviously<00:04:01.209> you've<00:04:01.359> got<00:04:01.570> down<00:04:01.840> near<00:04:02.019> the<00:04:02.049> Y<00:04:02.290> as

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
obviously you've got down near the Y as

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:05.970 
obviously you've got down near the Y as
well<00:04:02.890> and<00:04:04.320> over<00:04:05.320> the<00:04:05.410> other<00:04:05.530> side<00:04:05.560> the<00:04:05.829> map

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:05.980 
well and over the other side the map

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:08.400 
well and over the other side the map
down<00:04:06.280> near<00:04:06.459> the<00:04:06.489> LG<00:04:06.910> and<00:04:07.239> up<00:04:07.690> in<00:04:07.840> the<00:04:07.930> PT<00:04:08.230> room

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:08.410 
down near the LG and up in the PT room

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:09.840 
down near the LG and up in the PT room
so<00:04:08.590> there's<00:04:08.769> one<00:04:08.890> of<00:04:09.010> four<00:04:09.190> spawns<00:04:09.549> but<00:04:09.790> you

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:09.850 
so there's one of four spawns but you

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:12.180 
so there's one of four spawns but you
know<00:04:09.940> it<00:04:10.060> takes<00:04:10.239> out<00:04:10.480> a<00:04:10.750> lot<00:04:11.440> of<00:04:11.530> the<00:04:11.620> spawns<00:04:11.920> I

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.190 
know it takes out a lot of the spawns I

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:13.890 
know it takes out a lot of the spawns I
mean<00:04:12.519> I'll<00:04:12.640> press<00:04:12.880> eight<00:04:13.090> again<00:04:13.390> see

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:13.900 
mean I'll press eight again see

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:15.780 
mean I'll press eight again see
hopefully<00:04:14.109> will<00:04:14.440> come<00:04:14.650> there<00:04:14.920> no<00:04:15.310> he<00:04:15.430> doesn't

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
hopefully will come there no he doesn't

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:18.240 
hopefully will come there no he doesn't
so<00:04:16.060> it<00:04:16.539> again<00:04:16.750> and<00:04:16.989> there<00:04:17.590> is<00:04:17.739> so<00:04:18.010> there<00:04:18.160> we<00:04:18.220> go

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250 
so it again and there is so there we go

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.449 
so it again and there is so there we go
out<00:04:18.459> of<00:04:18.579> six<00:04:18.789> spawns<00:04:19.150> you<00:04:19.419> spawn<00:04:19.690> there<00:04:19.840> twice

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
out of six spawns you spawn there twice

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:23.040 
out of six spawns you spawn there twice
you<00:04:21.459> know<00:04:21.579> sometimes<00:04:21.850> it's<00:04:22.210> more<00:04:22.270> active<00:04:23.020> than

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.050 
you know sometimes it's more active than

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:26.250 
you know sometimes it's more active than
that<00:04:23.320> any<00:04:23.530> jewel<00:04:23.740> it<00:04:24.580> just<00:04:25.180> really<00:04:25.690> depends<00:04:26.080> on

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:26.260 
that any jewel it just really depends on

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:27.990 
that any jewel it just really depends on
your<00:04:26.350> luck<00:04:26.530> I<00:04:26.710> mean<00:04:26.890> for<00:04:27.130> spawning<00:04:27.430> isn't<00:04:27.850> all

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.000 
your luck I mean for spawning isn't all

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.930 
your luck I mean for spawning isn't all
about<00:04:28.030> skill<00:04:28.660> I<00:04:28.690> mean<00:04:28.960> it<00:04:29.080> does<00:04:29.820> you<00:04:30.820> know

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:30.940 
about skill I mean it does you know

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:32.279 
about skill I mean it does you know
there<00:04:31.120> are<00:04:31.150> there<00:04:31.600> is<00:04:31.690> a<00:04:31.720> skill<00:04:32.020> to<00:04:32.200> it

00:04:32.279 --> 00:04:32.289 
there are there is a skill to it

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:35.159 
there are there is a skill to it
obviously<00:04:32.760> your<00:04:33.760> opponent<00:04:34.270> I<00:04:34.389> mean<00:04:34.690> he

doesn't click like these boxes and click
you<00:04:37.570> know<00:04:37.600> spawn<00:04:38.020> straightaway<00:04:38.560> he<00:04:38.800> sometimes

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:39.220 
you know spawn straightaway he sometimes

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:41.580 
you know spawn straightaway he sometimes
weights<00:04:39.520> it<00:04:39.700> just<00:04:39.880> up<00:04:40.000> to<00:04:40.030> kill<00:04:40.479> him<00:04:40.630> looks

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:41.590 
weights it just up to kill him looks

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:45.360 
weights it just up to kill him looks
like<00:04:41.800> you<00:04:41.919> need<00:04:42.039> to<00:04:42.160> practice<00:04:42.400> so<00:04:44.340> over<00:04:45.340> here

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.370 
like you need to practice so over here

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:47.970 
like you need to practice so over here
I'll<00:04:45.700> flick<00:04:46.060> on<00:04:46.210> Maya

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:47.980 
I'll flick on Maya

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:50.520 
I'll flick on Maya
should<00:04:48.340> have<00:04:48.430> put<00:04:49.000> that<00:04:49.030> on<00:04:49.240> before<00:04:49.570> my<00:04:49.810> kill

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:50.530 
should have put that on before my kill

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:55.890 
should have put that on before my kill
script<00:04:50.950> so<00:04:51.540> when<00:04:52.540> you're<00:04:52.690> up<00:04:52.810> there<00:04:54.900> when

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:00.100 
you're up here you've got fail you've

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:02.970 
you're up here you've got fail you've
got<00:05:00.340> the<00:05:00.900> grenade<00:05:01.900> launcher<00:05:02.350> platform<00:05:02.530> this

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:02.980 
got the grenade launcher platform this

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:05.190 
got the grenade launcher platform this
to<00:05:03.130> spawns<00:05:03.490> there<00:05:03.760> so<00:05:04.060> pressing<00:05:04.420> 8<00:05:04.690> you<00:05:05.080> know<00:05:05.170> I

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:05.200 
to spawns there so pressing 8 you know I

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:07.980 
to spawns there so pressing 8 you know I
hope<00:05:05.410> these<00:05:05.560> ones<00:05:05.890> there<00:05:06.810> sometimes<00:05:07.810> your

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:07.990 
hope these ones there sometimes your

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:10.020 
hope these ones there sometimes your
spawns<00:05:08.230> over<00:05:08.470> there<00:05:08.620> it's<00:05:09.340> not<00:05:09.520> just<00:05:09.580> these

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:10.030 
spawns over there it's not just these

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:11.670 
spawns over there it's not just these
two<00:05:10.330> stuff<00:05:10.600> they're<00:05:10.780> not<00:05:10.900> the<00:05:11.050> only<00:05:11.110> to<00:05:11.410> spawn

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:11.680 
two stuff they're not the only to spawn

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.040 
two stuff they're not the only to spawn
seeking<00:05:12.010> he<00:05:12.220> can<00:05:12.400> spawn<00:05:12.910> in<00:05:13.060> it<00:05:13.780> can<00:05:13.930> also

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:14.050 
seeking he can spawn in it can also

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:27.750 
seeking he can spawn in it can also
spawn<00:05:14.460> around<00:05:15.460> down<00:05:15.760> here<00:05:16.260> or<00:05:22.200> yeah<00:05:23.370> here<00:05:26.730> so<00:05:27.730> I

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:27.760 
spawn around down here or yeah here so I

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:31.200 
spawn around down here or yeah here so I
mean<00:05:28.560> probably<00:05:29.560> the<00:05:29.860> worst<00:05:30.400> example<00:05:30.970> of<00:05:31.000> for

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:31.210 
mean probably the worst example of for

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:32.610 
mean probably the worst example of for
spawning<00:05:31.510> I<00:05:31.690> mean<00:05:31.810> nothing's<00:05:32.140> gone<00:05:32.320> right<00:05:32.560> for

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:32.620 
spawning I mean nothing's gone right for

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:34.650 
spawning I mean nothing's gone right for
me<00:05:32.830> I<00:05:32.980> was<00:05:33.100> police<00:05:33.340> then<00:05:33.550> that's<00:05:34.480> what<00:05:34.570> I

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:34.660 
me I was police then that's what I

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:36.270 
me I was police then that's what I
wanted<00:05:34.870> to<00:05:35.020> stand<00:05:35.230> probably<00:05:35.650> you<00:05:35.950> know<00:05:35.980> back

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:36.280 
wanted to stand probably you know back

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:40.830 
wanted to stand probably you know back
here<00:05:36.490> a<00:05:36.520> bit<00:05:37.860> so<00:05:38.860> there<00:05:39.040> we<00:05:39.160> go<00:05:39.190> I<00:05:39.580> mean<00:05:39.910> I<00:05:40.120> was

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:40.840 
here a bit so there we go I mean I was

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.390 
here a bit so there we go I mean I was
standing<00:05:41.140> too<00:05:41.170> far<00:05:41.470> forward<00:05:41.740> that's<00:05:42.010> why<00:05:42.220> he

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:42.400 
standing too far forward that's why he

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.310 
standing too far forward that's why he
could<00:05:42.520> spawn<00:05:42.790> down<00:05:43.030> there<00:05:43.270> but<00:05:43.840> she<00:05:44.080> should

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:44.320 
could spawn down there but she should

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:46.680 
could spawn down there but she should
not<00:05:44.500> have<00:05:44.680> been<00:05:44.800> able<00:05:44.950> to<00:05:45.100> do<00:05:45.280> so<00:05:46.150> I<00:05:46.180> mean<00:05:46.570> now

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:46.690 
not have been able to do so I mean now

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:48.450 
not have been able to do so I mean now
it's<00:05:46.720> working<00:05:47.020> a<00:05:47.230> bit<00:05:47.380> better<00:05:47.500> it's<00:05:47.890> it<00:05:48.340> all

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:48.460 
it's working a bit better it's it all

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:50.100 
it's working a bit better it's it all
comes<00:05:48.700> from<00:05:48.850> practice<00:05:49.330> like<00:05:49.630> you<00:05:49.780> know<00:05:49.900> where

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:50.110 
comes from practice like you know where

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:51.960 
comes from practice like you know where
to<00:05:50.170> stand<00:05:50.410> you<00:05:50.650> learn<00:05:50.800> where<00:05:51.040> to<00:05:51.070> stand<00:05:51.370> he's

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:51.970 
to stand you learn where to stand he's

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:53.430 
to stand you learn where to stand he's
not<00:05:52.120> going<00:05:52.240> to<00:05:52.300> always<00:05:52.510> spawn<00:05:53.020> here<00:05:53.230> you<00:05:53.320> know

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:53.440 
not going to always spawn here you know

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.250 
not going to always spawn here you know
three<00:05:53.740> in<00:05:53.830> a<00:05:53.920> row<00:05:53.950> there<00:05:54.250> was<00:05:54.400> pretty<00:05:54.610> good

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:55.260 
three in a row there was pretty good

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.630 
three in a row there was pretty good
jump<00:05:56.260> around<00:05:56.500> here<00:05:56.650> I<00:05:56.890> haven't<00:05:57.280> pressed<00:05:57.490> the

00:05:57.630 --> 00:05:57.640 
jump around here I haven't pressed the

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:59.130 
jump around here I haven't pressed the
button<00:05:57.910> yet<00:05:58.030> that's<00:05:58.270> why<00:05:58.450> he<00:05:58.570> hasn't<00:05:58.690> spawned

00:05:59.130 --> 00:05:59.140 
button yet that's why he hasn't spawned

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:03.000 
button yet that's why he hasn't spawned
probably<00:06:00.300> but<00:06:01.300> um<00:06:01.510> yeah<00:06:02.020> go<00:06:02.290> nuts<00:06:02.530> look<00:06:02.800> guys
