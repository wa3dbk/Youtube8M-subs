who<00:00:18.800> are<00:00:18.830> trying<00:00:19.070> to<00:00:19.310> lose<00:00:19.490> weight<00:00:19.520> but<00:00:20.060> I<00:00:20.390> get

who are trying to lose weight but I get

who are trying to lose weight but I get
a<00:00:20.570> lot<00:00:20.750> of<00:00:20.840> questions<00:00:21.200> from<00:00:21.500> people<00:00:21.590> who<00:00:22.070> are

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:22.189 
a lot of questions from people who are

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:24.460 
a lot of questions from people who are
trying<00:00:22.220> to<00:00:22.580> either<00:00:22.790> gain<00:00:23.090> or<00:00:23.480> maintain<00:00:23.509> weight

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:24.470 
trying to either gain or maintain weight

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.339 
trying to either gain or maintain weight
on<00:00:24.770> a<00:00:25.220> plant-based<00:00:25.550> diet<00:00:25.849> now<00:00:26.840> the<00:00:26.900> reason

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:27.349 
on a plant-based diet now the reason

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:29.170 
on a plant-based diet now the reason
this<00:00:27.439> is<00:00:27.500> so<00:00:27.739> difficult<00:00:28.009> is<00:00:28.520> because<00:00:28.550> when<00:00:29.119> you

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:29.180 
this is so difficult is because when you

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:30.640 
this is so difficult is because when you
get<00:00:29.300> into<00:00:29.540> eating<00:00:29.720> healthy<00:00:29.869> whole

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:30.650 
get into eating healthy whole

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:33.069 
get into eating healthy whole
plant-based<00:00:31.189> foods<00:00:31.730> they<00:00:32.599> have<00:00:32.780> a<00:00:32.810> lot<00:00:33.050> of

00:00:33.069 --> 00:00:33.079 
plant-based foods they have a lot of

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:35.670 
plant-based foods they have a lot of
water<00:00:33.380> and<00:00:33.739> they<00:00:33.860> have<00:00:33.980> a<00:00:34.040> lot<00:00:34.280> of<00:00:34.310> fiber<00:00:34.700> which

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:35.680 
water and they have a lot of fiber which

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.130 
water and they have a lot of fiber which
decreases<00:00:36.680> their<00:00:37.040> calorie<00:00:37.579> density<00:00:38.149> calorie

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:39.140 
decreases their calorie density calorie

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.009 
decreases their calorie density calorie
density<00:00:39.440> is<00:00:39.890> when<00:00:40.820> you<00:00:41.180> look<00:00:41.390> at<00:00:41.600> the<00:00:41.809> amount

00:00:42.009 --> 00:00:42.019 
density is when you look at the amount

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:45.099 
density is when you look at the amount
of<00:00:42.170> calories<00:00:42.769> for<00:00:43.250> a<00:00:43.309> given<00:00:43.609> volume<00:00:43.910> of<00:00:44.510> food

00:00:45.099 --> 00:00:45.109 
of calories for a given volume of food

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:48.069 
of calories for a given volume of food
so<00:00:45.800> whole<00:00:46.340> plant<00:00:46.760> foods<00:00:47.090> are<00:00:47.329> very<00:00:47.690> low

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:48.079 
so whole plant foods are very low

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:51.369 
so whole plant foods are very low
calorie<00:00:48.769> density<00:00:49.250> they<00:00:50.000> have<00:00:50.269> not<00:00:50.899> very<00:00:51.199> many

00:00:51.369 --> 00:00:51.379 
calorie density they have not very many

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:53.110 
calorie density they have not very many
calories<00:00:51.649> but<00:00:52.219> they<00:00:52.370> fill<00:00:52.670> up<00:00:52.699> your<00:00:52.850> stomach

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.120 
calories but they fill up your stomach

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.020 
calories but they fill up your stomach
really<00:00:53.600> easily<00:00:54.109> so<00:00:54.410> for<00:00:55.160> those<00:00:55.250> people<00:00:55.730> who

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.030 
really easily so for those people who

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.360 
really easily so for those people who
need<00:00:56.329> to<00:00:56.359> increase<00:00:57.050> their<00:00:57.230> calories<00:00:57.649> it<00:00:58.160> can

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370 
need to increase their calories it can

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.360 
need to increase their calories it can
be<00:00:58.489> difficult<00:00:58.969> for<00:00:59.629> people<00:00:59.690> who<00:01:00.440> want<00:01:00.920> to<00:01:01.010> lose

be difficult for people who want to lose

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.970 
be difficult for people who want to lose

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:33.080 
you are looking to gain muscle you can't

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.680 
you are looking to gain muscle you can't
eat<00:01:33.410> your<00:01:33.590> way<00:01:33.770> to<00:01:33.830> muscle<00:01:34.370> the<00:01:35.180> way<00:01:35.330> you<00:01:35.390> gain

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:35.690 
eat your way to muscle the way you gain

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.100 
eat your way to muscle the way you gain
muscle<00:01:36.140> is<00:01:36.380> by<00:01:36.590> doing<00:01:36.890> strength<00:01:37.250> training<00:01:37.370> and

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110 
muscle is by doing strength training and

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.020 
muscle is by doing strength training and
what<00:01:39.110> you<00:01:39.230> eat<00:01:39.500> can<00:01:39.710> support<00:01:40.370> your<00:01:40.640> muscle

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
what you eat can support your muscle

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.270 
what you eat can support your muscle
growth<00:01:41.270> but<00:01:42.050> that's<00:01:42.200> not<00:01:42.440> how<00:01:42.740> you<00:01:42.800> grow

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
growth but that's not how you grow

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.020 
growth but that's not how you grow
muscle<00:01:43.700> so<00:01:44.300> getting<00:01:44.660> into<00:01:44.930> the<00:01:45.050> actual<00:01:45.350> foods

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
muscle so getting into the actual foods

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.480 
muscle so getting into the actual foods
foods<00:01:47.030> that<00:01:47.270> are<00:01:47.420> high<00:01:47.630> in<00:01:47.930> fat<00:01:48.350> are<00:01:48.920> calorie

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
foods that are high in fat are calorie

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.390 
foods that are high in fat are calorie
dense<00:01:49.850> because<00:01:50.210> fat<00:01:50.900> has<00:01:51.200> nine<00:01:51.230> calories<00:01:52.070> per

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:52.400 
dense because fat has nine calories per

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.270 
dense because fat has nine calories per
gram<00:01:52.720> whereas<00:01:53.720> carbohydrates<00:01:54.650> and<00:01:54.830> proteins

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
gram whereas carbohydrates and proteins

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.540 
gram whereas carbohydrates and proteins
have<00:01:55.580> four<00:01:56.150> calories<00:01:56.540> per<00:01:56.780> gram<00:01:56.990> so<00:01:57.550> healthy

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:58.550 
have four calories per gram so healthy

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:00.940 
have four calories per gram so healthy
foods<00:01:58.820> that<00:01:59.000> are<00:01:59.180> high<00:01:59.300> in<00:01:59.330> fat<00:01:59.630> nuts<00:02:00.440> seeds

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
foods that are high in fat nuts seeds

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:02.920 
foods that are high in fat nuts seeds

to<00:02:23.380> condense<00:02:23.770> them<00:02:24.160> it<00:02:24.520> helps<00:02:25.000> to<00:02:25.090> break<00:02:25.270> down

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
to condense them it helps to break down

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.950 
to condense them it helps to break down
the<00:02:25.630> fiber<00:02:25.930> so<00:02:26.620> you<00:02:26.680> can<00:02:27.370> fit<00:02:27.910> more<00:02:28.210> into<00:02:28.540> your

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:28.960
