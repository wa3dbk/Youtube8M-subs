00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.420 
about eight months now and as you can
tell<00:01:20.659> it's<00:01:21.170> really<00:01:21.259> subtle<00:01:21.650> the<00:01:21.890> color<00:01:22.100> looks

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:22.430 
tell it's really subtle the color looks

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:24.820 
tell it's really subtle the color looks
very<00:01:22.490> very<00:01:22.970> natural<00:01:23.240> there<00:01:23.690> is<00:01:23.720> no<00:01:23.840> pixelation
