00:00:26.466 --> 00:00:29.466
- [speaking Spanish]

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.333
- WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE FRUIT?
- FRUIT OR FOOD?

00:00:38.333 --> 00:00:41.900
DO YOU HAVE AN ACCENT?
- NO, I DON'T HAVE AN ACCENT.

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.366

00:00:45.366 --> 00:00:47.166

- YES, YOU DO.

00:00:47.166 --> 00:00:48.733
- WHERE?
- COLUMBIAN.

00:00:48.733 --> 00:00:51.000
YOU HAVE
A COLUMBIAN ACCENT.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.766
- WHAT--WHAT DO YOU MEAN
BY THAT?

00:00:52.766 --> 00:00:53.900
I-I-I'M--

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.500
- IT'S AN ACCENT
OF WHERE YOU SPEAK

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.733
COMBO--COLUMBIAN

00:00:58.733 --> 00:01:01.400
EVERY TIME
YOU SAY SOMETHING.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.800
- CAN YOU DO MY ACCENT,

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.166
IF YOU THINK
I HAVE AN ACCENT?

00:01:04.166 --> 00:01:05.966
BECAUSE I DON'T THINK
I HAVE AN ACCENT.

00:01:05.966 --> 00:01:08.566
- [babbling]

00:01:08.566 --> 00:01:10.600
- I SOUND LIKE THAT?

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.133
- BUT I DIDN'T EVEN
UNDERSTAND IT.

00:01:13.133 --> 00:01:15.000
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND ME?

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.633
YOU'VE NEVER WATCHED
"MODERN FAMILY"?

00:01:16.633 --> 00:01:18.633
EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS ME
ON "MODERN FAMILY."

00:01:18.633 --> 00:01:20.566
- I NEVER WATCH
"MODERN FAMILY."

00:01:20.566 --> 00:01:22.600
- WHAT?

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.700
- IT'S NOT A CARTOON SHOW.

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.133
[laughter]

00:01:26.133 --> 00:01:28.266
WHAT TYPE OF CARTOON
DO YOU LIKE?

00:01:28.266 --> 00:01:30.500
- WELL, I USED TO WATCH
ALL THE CARTOONS

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.466
MY SON MANOLO
USED TO WATCH,

00:01:32.466 --> 00:01:35.800
LIKE BUGS BUNNY,
THE PINK PANTHER.

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.966
DO YOU KNOW ANY OF THOSE?
- I DON'T KNOW.

00:01:37.966 --> 00:01:39.966
I MEAN, YOU SHOULD WATCH
"THE SIMPSONS."

00:01:39.966 --> 00:01:41.533
IT'S A FUNNY RIDE.

00:01:41.533 --> 00:01:43.300
- WHICH ONE IS YOUR FAVORITE
FROM "THE SIMPSONS"?

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.200
- I WOULD HAVE TO SAY--

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.866
I WOULD HAVE TO SAY
THE DAD.

00:01:47.866 --> 00:01:50.366
- "OMER."
- "OMER."

00:01:50.366 --> 00:01:52.800
I HAVE TO SAY "OMER."

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.933
HE MAKES FUNNY NOISES,
LIKE...

00:01:54.933 --> 00:01:57.500
[grunting]

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:58.900
- YOU LOOK SO CUTE.

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.400
- [giggles]

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.266
I'M TURNING SIX
THIS MONTH.

00:02:02.266 --> 00:02:04.466
- OH, MY GOD,
THAT'S BAD.

00:02:04.466 --> 00:02:07.766
- NO, IT ISN'T.
- IT'S TOO OLD NOW.

00:02:07.766 --> 00:02:09.400
- I KNOW,
BUT SIX IS BETTER.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.833
I MEAN, WHEN YOU TURN 18
AND YOU'RE IN HIGH SCHOOL,

00:02:12.833 --> 00:02:14.500
GUESS WHAT,
YOU GET TO DRIVE A CAR,

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.900
AND YOU GET
YOUR DRIVER'S LICENSE.

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:18.966
- THAT IS TRUE.

00:02:18.966 --> 00:02:21.666
- ALSO, WHEN YOU'RE FULLY GROWN

00:02:21.666 --> 00:02:25.666
AND A MAN EYEBALLS YOU
AND YOU HAVE A CAR,

00:02:25.666 --> 00:02:27.566
THAT MEANS
HE WANTS TO RACE.

00:02:27.566 --> 00:02:31.600
- A RACE?
- YEAH, AND YOU RACE HIM.

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.466
I WANT A DINOSAUR
FOR MY BIRTHDAY,

00:02:33.466 --> 00:02:37.400
BUT I CAN'T HAVE ANY
BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL EXTINCT.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.033
- OH, BUT YOU CAN GET,
LIKE, A PLASTIC ONE

00:02:39.033 --> 00:02:40.200
OR SOMETHING,
LIKE THIS ONE.

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.200
LOOK, THIS IS,
LIKE, A DUCK.

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.233
- IT'S A DUCK.
LOOK, IT'S--

00:02:45.233 --> 00:02:47.533
- BUT I'M SURE THEY CAN GET YOU,
LIKE, A DINOSAUR--

00:02:47.533 --> 00:02:49.066
LIKE, THE MATERIAL.

00:02:49.066 --> 00:02:50.566
- LOOK, LOOK, LOOK.
IT'S A DUCK.

00:02:50.566 --> 00:02:52.933
IT HAS TWO LEGS,
WEBBED FEET.

00:02:52.933 --> 00:02:55.133
SOMETIMES DINOSAURS
HAVE WEBBED FEET.

00:02:55.133 --> 00:02:56.366
I DON'T KNOW.

00:02:56.366 --> 00:02:58.033
- WHICH ONE IS THE DINOSAUR
YOU WANT?

00:02:58.033 --> 00:03:00.466
- I WOULD HAVE TO SAY
A CRONKODON.

00:03:00.466 --> 00:03:02.633
- A CRONKENDON?

00:03:02.633 --> 00:03:05.866
- THEY CALL IT A CRONKODON
BECAUSE OF ITS STEEP LEGS

00:03:05.866 --> 00:03:07.933
AND ITS EYESIGHT

00:03:07.933 --> 00:03:11.833
AND ITS ABILITY
TO BREATHE UNDERWATER.

00:03:11.833 --> 00:03:13.266
- WHAT?

00:03:13.266 --> 00:03:16.400
- THE CRONKODON ACTUALLY
JUMPS OUT THE WATER,

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.000
GRABBING ITS NATURAL PREY
OR SOMETHING ELSE,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.733
LIKE A TRICERATOPS
OR A BRACHIOSAURUS

00:03:22.733 --> 00:03:26.000
OR EVEN ANOTHER
MEAT-EATING DINOSAUR.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.366
DO YOU LIKE PIZZA?
- OF COURSE.

00:03:28.366 --> 00:03:30.166
WHO DOESN'T LIKE PIZZA?

00:03:30.166 --> 00:03:33.400
WE EAT PIZZA IN COLUMBIA.

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:34.733
IS IT--
- HERE, HAVE A SLICE.

00:03:34.733 --> 00:03:36.366
- BUT IS IT OLD?
ARE YOU GONNA HAVE--

00:03:36.366 --> 00:03:38.600
- NO, IT'S--
NO, I DON'T WANT ANY.

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.500
- WHY?
- BUT I DON'T WANT ONE.

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.000
- OKAY,
BUT THEN WHAT IF IT'S OLD

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.233
AND YOU'RE TRICKING ME?

00:03:46.233 --> 00:03:47.233
- IT'S NOT OLD.

00:03:47.233 --> 00:03:48.400
PLUS, I JUST DON'T WANT ANY,

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.166
BECAUSE I'M NOT HUNGRY
RIGHT NOW.

00:03:50.166 --> 00:03:52.366
- DO YOU HAVE
A GIRLFRIEND?

00:03:54.233 --> 00:03:55.900
- NO.

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.500
- NO?
- NOPE.

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.166
- WHY NOT?

00:03:59.166 --> 00:04:00.966
- YOU KNOW
WHAT THE CRONKODON DOES

00:04:00.966 --> 00:04:02.733
WHEN A VICTIM--

00:04:02.733 --> 00:04:04.400
- ARE YOU CHANGING
THE SUBJECT?

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.566
- THE NATURAL PREY?
- YEAH, I KNOW.

00:04:06.566 --> 00:04:08.633
YOU TOLD ME ALL THAT,
BUT WHAT ABOUT THE GIRLFRIEND?

00:04:08.633 --> 00:04:09.733
- [scoffs]

00:04:09.733 --> 00:04:11.133
NO, I DON'T HAVE
A GIRLFRIEND.

00:04:11.133 --> 00:04:14.466
NO, I'LL NEVER GET A GIRLFRIEND.
- WHY?

00:04:14.466 --> 00:04:16.666
- ALIEN DUCK
ON MY HEAD.

00:04:16.666 --> 00:04:18.933
- YOU'RE STILL
CHANGING THE SUBJECT.

00:04:18.933 --> 00:04:22.900
- EVERYONE SAY HELLO
TO THE DUCK ON MY HEAD.

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:24.100
THANKS, SOFIA.

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:25.666
THIS IS
"THE NOAH RITTER SHOW."

00:04:25.666 --> 00:04:27.166
- GIVE ME A KISS.
- BYE.

00:04:27.166 --> 00:04:28.766
- GIVE ME A KISS!

00:04:28.766 --> 00:04:30.233
- [screams]

00:04:30.233 --> 00:04:33.300
- HOW ARE YOU SO ADORABLE?
COME HERE!

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.366
- [screams]

00:04:35.366 --> 00:04:37.466
- YOU RAN AWAY
FROM SOFIA VERGARA.

00:04:37.466 --> 00:04:39.366
- [laughs]
