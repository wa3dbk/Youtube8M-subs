 computer from the outside before any 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:17.279
 do not forget to turn off 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:18.420
 completely your computer you 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.180
 will find in the trade a lot of 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.890
 products we will all be worth 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.050
 but really a trick that works very 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.289
 well it's white vinegar moisten 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.660
 a piece of absorbent paper 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:34.550
 with white vinegar be careful 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:37.410
 not that it tastes and it's a little bit 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:39.690
 from their kits and to just have a 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:43.230
 rat wet feet and you can 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:46.350
 then without hesitation to the east on the 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:52.110
 keyboard on the screen well do all 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:57.989
 the keys obviously on the hood 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:59.520
 the computer also thought good just 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.770
 after passing the vinegar well 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.719
 wiped with dry paper towel 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.030
 you have to lift all the vinegar very 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:09.090
 quickly to avoid the computer on 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.479
 noon did to clean the underside of the 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.040
 keyboard 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.330
 you can use an air bomb 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.610
 tablet that you can easily in 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.939
 the trade so you use it in 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:21.119
 placing the tip under a touch and 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:23.180
 thus pressing you to expel the 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:26.580
 impurities that lies beneath the keys 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.150
 the ventilation holes are often under 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.650
 machines 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.180
 that's why we do not need them 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.750
 lay on a mattress or on a surface 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.009
 soft so as not to obstruct these holes 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.750
 same way one should not favor 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.159
 the entrance of dust so avoid 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.140
 put your computer on landrin which 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:43.799
 dusty on this computer by 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.159
 example the holes here is here and 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.530
 right here 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.540
 if you own a tower avoid the 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.610
 put directly on the ground favorite put 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.110
 a base between the ground and the tower 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.590
 especially if you have some 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.759
 carpet 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.060
 because it will create electricity 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.560
 static that will end up on the tower 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.149
 if you are a smoker avoid spitting 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.899
 too much smoke on your screen it goes 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.930
 become very fast 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.700
 you know 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:06.420

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.420
