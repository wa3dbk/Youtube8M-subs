hey there it's JJ here and for this

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:09.530 
hey there it's JJ here and for this
quick<00:00:07.799> tip<00:00:08.099> I'm<00:00:08.370> gonna<00:00:08.730> dive<00:00:09.059> into<00:00:09.300> the

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
quick tip I'm gonna dive into the

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.049 
quick tip I'm gonna dive into the
denoiser<00:00:10.170> plug<00:00:10.440> in<00:00:10.650> my<00:00:10.830> Sonics<00:00:11.280> and<00:00:11.580> show<00:00:12.000> you

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
denoiser plug in my Sonics and show you

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.049 
denoiser plug in my Sonics and show you
some<00:00:12.420> uses<00:00:12.809> directly<00:00:13.320> from<00:00:13.440> the<00:00:13.620> studio<00:00:13.950> I<00:00:14.250> was

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
some uses directly from the studio I was

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.290 
some uses directly from the studio I was
sent<00:00:15.540> a<00:00:15.960> couple<00:00:16.379> of<00:00:16.590> stems<00:00:16.949> to<00:00:17.279> mix<00:00:17.550> and<00:00:17.880> both

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
sent a couple of stems to mix and both

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.630 
sent a couple of stems to mix and both
the<00:00:18.510> vocals<00:00:18.930> and<00:00:19.080> guitar<00:00:19.619> tracks<00:00:19.980> had<00:00:20.369> a<00:00:20.400> lot

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
the vocals and guitar tracks had a lot

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.970 
the vocals and guitar tracks had a lot
of<00:00:20.670> noise<00:00:20.970> from<00:00:21.930> when<00:00:22.199> they<00:00:22.320> were<00:00:22.380> recorded

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
of noise from when they were recorded

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.609 
of noise from when they were recorded
somebody<00:00:23.789> kind<00:00:24.330> of<00:00:24.449> new<00:00:24.600> to<00:00:24.720> recording<00:00:25.289> and<00:00:25.470> I

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
somebody kind of new to recording and I

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.410 
somebody kind of new to recording and I
said<00:00:26.130> I<00:00:26.160> would<00:00:26.369> help<00:00:26.490> them<00:00:26.580> out<00:00:26.820> but<00:00:27.240> the

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
said I would help them out but the

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.269 
said I would help them out but the
tracks<00:00:27.660> were<00:00:27.840> pretty<00:00:28.109> full<00:00:28.380> of<00:00:28.529> noise<00:00:28.980> and

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
tracks were pretty full of noise and

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.810 
tracks were pretty full of noise and
hiss<00:00:29.840> so<00:00:30.840> first<00:00:31.080> up<00:00:31.260> I<00:00:31.470> had<00:00:31.800> a<00:00:31.830> noisy<00:00:32.430> guitar

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
hiss so first up I had a noisy guitar

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.110 
hiss so first up I had a noisy guitar
and<00:00:33.149> using<00:00:33.989> EQ<00:00:34.500> to<00:00:34.800> try<00:00:35.070> and<00:00:35.280> solve<00:00:35.550> that<00:00:35.880> and

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
and using EQ to try and solve that and

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.540 
and using EQ to try and solve that and
remove<00:00:36.450> it<00:00:36.690> was<00:00:37.320> destroying<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:38.129> high<00:00:38.280> end

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
remove it was destroying the high end

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.540 
remove it was destroying the high end
and<00:00:38.730> clarity<00:00:39.210> so<00:00:39.870> I<00:00:39.899> opted<00:00:40.469> for<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.710> Oxford

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
and clarity so I opted for the Oxford

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:42.110 
and clarity so I opted for the Oxford
denoiser

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
denoiser

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.750 
denoiser
so<00:00:43.050> here's<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.350> guitar<00:00:43.649> part<00:00:43.980> without<00:00:44.700> any

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
so here's the guitar part without any

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:57.440 
so here's the guitar part without any
denoising<00:00:45.480> going<00:00:45.930> on

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:57.450 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.440 

this<00:00:58.080> is<00:00:58.260> a<00:00:58.290> pretty<00:00:58.680> intimate<00:00:59.190> song<00:00:59.640> with<00:01:00.150> very

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:00.450 
this is a pretty intimate song with very

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:02.720 
this is a pretty intimate song with very
little<00:01:00.750> elements<00:01:01.410> so<00:01:01.800> I<00:01:01.830> wanted<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.400> guitar

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
little elements so I wanted the guitar

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.130 
little elements so I wanted the guitar
to<00:01:02.850> simply<00:01:03.210> be<00:01:03.360> there<00:01:03.630> and<00:01:03.810> not<00:01:03.960> be

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
to simply be there and not be

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.380 
to simply be there and not be
distracting<00:01:04.949> with<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.250> noisy<00:01:05.730> and<00:01:05.970> Issy

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
distracting with the noisy and Issy

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.260 
distracting with the noisy and Issy
high-end<00:01:06.810> so<00:01:07.710> here<00:01:07.920> I<00:01:07.950> activate<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.730> denoiser

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
high-end so here I activate the denoiser

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.050 
high-end so here I activate the denoiser
and<00:01:09.450> I<00:01:09.660> used<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.710> auto<00:01:10.920> detect<00:01:11.490> mode<00:01:11.760> to

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
and I used the auto detect mode to

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.140 
and I used the auto detect mode to
analyze<00:01:12.660> the<00:01:12.900> noise<00:01:13.050> and<00:01:13.590> then<00:01:14.400> dial<00:01:14.700> in<00:01:14.940> the

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
analyze the noise and then dial in the

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.330 
analyze the noise and then dial in the
threshold<00:01:15.690> just<00:01:16.260> below<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.860> noise<00:01:17.010> floor

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
threshold just below the noise floor

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.960 
threshold just below the noise floor
that<00:01:17.700> it<00:01:18.000> detected<00:01:18.680> now<00:01:19.680> I<00:01:19.710> adjust<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.460> remove

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
that it detected now I adjust the remove

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.780 
that it detected now I adjust the remove
amount<00:01:21.570> and<00:01:21.990> find<00:01:22.470> a<00:01:22.560> good<00:01:22.770> compromise<00:01:23.310> and

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
amount and find a good compromise and

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.910 
amount and find a good compromise and
that's<00:01:24.660> what<00:01:24.990> this<00:01:25.110> is<00:01:25.170> about<00:01:25.410> is<00:01:25.680> about

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
that's what this is about is about

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.190 
that's what this is about is about
compromise<00:01:26.340> so<00:01:27.180> how<00:01:27.330> can<00:01:27.390> we<00:01:27.630> get<00:01:27.840> a<00:01:27.870> less

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
compromise so how can we get a less

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.480 
compromise so how can we get a less
distracting<00:01:28.979> and<00:01:29.100> noisy

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
distracting and noisy

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.060 
distracting and noisy
instrument<00:01:30.119> but<00:01:30.690> one<00:01:30.900> that<00:01:31.140> still<00:01:31.500> maintains

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
instrument but one that still maintains

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.910 
instrument but one that still maintains
some<00:01:32.400> of<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.580> high-end<00:01:32.940> presence<00:01:33.680> and<00:01:34.680> now

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
some of the high-end presence and now

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.180 
some of the high-end presence and now
using<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.580> air<00:01:36.330> parameter<00:01:37.200> I<00:01:37.410> sort<00:01:37.830> of<00:01:37.920> let

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:38.190 
using the air parameter I sort of let

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.999 
using the air parameter I sort of let
some<00:01:38.460> of<00:01:38.580> the<00:01:38.700> high-end<00:01:39.119> back<00:01:39.390> in<00:01:39.690> and<00:01:40.009> what

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
some of the high-end back in and what

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.859 
some of the high-end back in and what
this<00:01:41.160> does<00:01:41.369> is<00:01:41.580> it<00:01:41.759> eases<00:01:42.240> up<00:01:42.270> on<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.690> noise

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
this does is it eases up on the noise

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.510 
this does is it eases up on the noise
reduction<00:01:43.259> occurring<00:01:43.920> in<00:01:44.070> some<00:01:44.310> of<00:01:44.430> the

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
reduction occurring in some of the

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.640 
reduction occurring in some of the
higher<00:01:44.670> frequencies<00:01:45.330> so<00:01:45.990> again<00:01:46.259> I'm<00:01:46.380> looking

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:46.650 
higher frequencies so again I'm looking

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:48.410 
higher frequencies so again I'm looking
for<00:01:46.830> a<00:01:46.860> compromise<00:01:47.460> here<00:01:47.759> by<00:01:47.910> bringing<00:01:48.240> some

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
for a compromise here by bringing some

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.719 
for a compromise here by bringing some
of<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.630> high<00:01:48.750> frequencies<00:01:49.380> back<00:01:49.619> in<00:01:49.920> but<00:01:50.550> not

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
of the high frequencies back in but not

00:01:50.729 --> 00:02:00.230 
of the high frequencies back in but not
too<00:01:51.000> much<00:01:51.210> to<00:01:51.570> let<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:51.899> hiss<00:01:52.110> also<00:01:52.590> back<00:01:52.830> in

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.490 

so<00:02:01.240> now<00:02:01.390> I<00:02:01.420> just<00:02:01.540> wanted<00:02:01.899> to<00:02:01.990> add<00:02:02.110> a<00:02:02.140> little

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
so now I just wanted to add a little

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.730 
so now I just wanted to add a little
extra<00:02:02.770> EQ<00:02:03.520> just<00:02:03.970> to<00:02:04.149> push<00:02:04.390> up<00:02:04.600> the<00:02:05.110> top<00:02:05.320> part<00:02:05.350> of

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
extra EQ just to push up the top part of

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.889 
extra EQ just to push up the top part of
that<00:02:05.830> guitar<00:02:06.009> frequency<00:02:06.939> just<00:02:07.210> a<00:02:07.420> little<00:02:07.720> bit

00:02:07.889 --> 00:02:07.899 
that guitar frequency just a little bit

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:16.740 
that guitar frequency just a little bit
and<00:02:08.170> so<00:02:08.739> here's<00:02:08.950> what<00:02:09.009> we<00:02:09.220> have<00:02:09.250> now

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.420 

next<00:02:17.750> up<00:02:17.870> I<00:02:18.050> had<00:02:18.260> vocal<00:02:18.709> recordings<00:02:19.220> which

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
next up I had vocal recordings which

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.309 
next up I had vocal recordings which
also<00:02:19.879> had<00:02:20.090> a<00:02:20.120> significant<00:02:20.810> amount<00:02:20.959> of<00:02:21.110> noise

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 
also had a significant amount of noise

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:30.420 
also had a significant amount of noise
and<00:02:21.620> hiss<00:02:21.830> so<00:02:22.790> here's<00:02:23.209> the<00:02:23.420> raw<00:02:23.599> vocal<00:02:24.140> sound

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.180 

stop<00:02:31.450> again<00:02:32.450> I<00:02:32.630> went<00:02:32.900> for<00:02:33.080> the<00:02:33.140> denoiser<00:02:33.470> this

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
stop again I went for the denoiser this

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.070 
stop again I went for the denoiser this
took<00:02:34.520> quite<00:02:34.760> a<00:02:34.819> bit<00:02:35.060> more<00:02:35.240> adjusting<00:02:35.840> to

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
took quite a bit more adjusting to

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.920 
took quite a bit more adjusting to
achieve<00:02:36.470> a<00:02:36.709> reasonable<00:02:36.950> sound<00:02:37.610> taking<00:02:38.540> noise

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
achieve a reasonable sound taking noise

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:40.540 
achieve a reasonable sound taking noise
and<00:02:39.260> hiss<00:02:39.410> away<00:02:39.650> from<00:02:39.890> something<00:02:40.310> like<00:02:40.340> a

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550 
and hiss away from something like a

and hiss away from something like a

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
vocal always removed some of the

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.020 
vocal always removed some of the
high-end<00:02:42.650> energy<00:02:43.010> and<00:02:43.220> that<00:02:43.340> brings<00:02:43.610> presence

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
high-end energy and that brings presence

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.330 
high-end energy and that brings presence
to<00:02:44.180> the<00:02:44.300> vocal<00:02:44.570> recordings<00:02:44.990> the<00:02:45.620> more<00:02:45.830> noise<00:02:46.100> I

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
to the vocal recordings the more noise I

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.010 
to the vocal recordings the more noise I
tried<00:02:46.610> to<00:02:46.790> remove<00:02:47.060> the<00:02:47.390> more<00:02:47.570> the<00:02:47.690> vocal

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:48.020 
tried to remove the more the vocal

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.170 
tried to remove the more the vocal
seemed<00:02:48.230> to<00:02:48.380> suffer<00:02:48.770> but<00:02:49.220> also<00:02:49.400> the<00:02:49.910> more<00:02:50.150> I

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
seemed to suffer but also the more I

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.330 
seemed to suffer but also the more I
moved<00:02:50.480> around<00:02:50.660> the<00:02:50.810> plugin<00:02:51.290> and<00:02:51.470> adjusted

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
moved around the plugin and adjusted

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.250 
moved around the plugin and adjusted
some<00:02:52.489> of<00:02:52.580> the<00:02:52.640> parameters<00:02:53.209> and<00:02:53.480> listened<00:02:54.170> to

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
some of the parameters and listened to

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.530 
some of the parameters and listened to
what<00:02:54.530> I<00:02:54.739> was<00:02:54.860> doing<00:02:55.280> the<00:02:55.790> better<00:02:55.970> I<00:02:56.060> got<00:02:56.330> at

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
what I was doing the better I got at

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.030 
what I was doing the better I got at
being<00:02:56.750> able<00:02:57.020> to<00:02:57.230> make<00:02:57.500> those<00:02:57.739> subtle

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
being able to make those subtle

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.040 
being able to make those subtle
adjustments<00:02:58.610> while<00:02:58.850> still<00:02:59.209> retaining<00:02:59.450> as

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.050 
adjustments while still retaining as

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:02.440 
adjustments while still retaining as
much<00:03:00.380> of<00:03:00.560> the<00:03:00.650> high-end<00:03:01.010> as<00:03:01.190> possible<00:03:01.730> so<00:03:02.060> take

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
much of the high-end as possible so take

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:15.970 
much of the high-end as possible so take
a<00:03:02.480> listen<00:03:13.090> the<00:03:14.090> air<00:03:14.330> parameter<00:03:15.170> was<00:03:15.560> a<00:03:15.590> really

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
a listen the air parameter was a really

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.190 
a listen the air parameter was a really
welcome<00:03:16.370> addition<00:03:16.790> is<00:03:17.390> that<00:03:17.570> it<00:03:17.660> helped<00:03:17.930> put

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
welcome addition is that it helped put

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.020 
welcome addition is that it helped put
back<00:03:18.440> the<00:03:18.739> missing<00:03:18.980> high-end<00:03:19.610> from<00:03:19.940> the

back the missing high-end from the

back the missing high-end from the
denoising<00:03:20.420> process<00:03:21.110> again<00:03:21.650> by<00:03:22.280> loosening<00:03:22.820> up

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
denoising process again by loosening up

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.690 
denoising process again by loosening up
on<00:03:23.390> some<00:03:24.290> of<00:03:24.440> the<00:03:24.530> D<00:03:24.680> noises<00:03:25.040> that's<00:03:25.160> happening

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
on some of the D noises that's happening

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.240 
on some of the D noises that's happening
at<00:03:25.880> the<00:03:26.090> higher<00:03:26.300> frequencies<00:03:26.989> so<00:03:27.739> here's<00:03:28.100> it

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
at the higher frequencies so here's it

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:35.440 
at the higher frequencies so here's it
with<00:03:28.400> some<00:03:28.610> air<00:03:33.730> so<00:03:34.730> that's<00:03:34.910> it<00:03:35.030> for<00:03:35.180> the<00:03:35.299> D

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
with some air so that's it for the D

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:38.530 
with some air so that's it for the D
