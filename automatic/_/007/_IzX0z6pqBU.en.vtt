00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 Talk, people, beauty, all right. 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.720
 Thank God 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.880
 good this video here now to show the 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.840
 result of the work that we have 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:17.520
 this whole week and on the bike 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:19.949
 Slow down for lease percent was 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:24.150
 very laborious understood a service there 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:28.349
 which is not fast but it was great 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:30.090
 quality is the rear wheel was 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:34.140
 mashed as you already know 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:37.770
 and then we had to do the work there 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:40.200
 on the tac motors was kneaded rear wheel 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.969
 and unfortunately I had to paint the 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.770
 wheels I wanted to keep that edge 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.629
 polished of her 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.510
 I just had to paint will have to 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.039
 to paint some color because that 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.590
 punished I could not do more 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:58.649
 I could only wish I could not 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:01:01.379
 take in a place where he was polishing 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.180
 in the tournament that diamonds the ball 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:07.590
 again tackles the wheel and get more 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:09.330
 fine to get in but then polina 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.939
 we could not do that, I found 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.010
 that would get very bad is the quality of the 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.920
 the wheel would not be very thick would be 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.920
 very easy fine you finish 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.549
 spoiling her in another hole then only 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:26.430
 we made it back very nice 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:29.119
 and then I decided to paint in black and not keep 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.439
 the originality of the bike this bike here 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:34.439
 2012 has already left with the clothes all black 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:37.710
 Just like this one, so I preferred to keep it there. 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:40.290
 the same black wheel is which I made some 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.360
 some detail one detail or another there 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.299
 different even to stay legal stays 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.320
 my face I tried is the brake disc 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.450
 here o 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.939
 only from the middle of gold to stay 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.970
 her that most race album or because 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.770
 have daisies selling haidara 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.260
 among other brands launch golden 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.730
 red network so I preferred to do this 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:03.750
 color because all black and I thought it would 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:05.340
 get very faded then fc there 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.890
 Golden looks cool, I did it myself 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:11.850
 this insured culture that anyone who wants to 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:14.580
 know which color is the old gold is alone 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:17.640
 you buy an old gold spray making 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.770
 Pee licha everything right but I 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:23.700
 preparation and painting is very cool this 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:26.900
 thing here and the black one we used 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:31.200
 here was a brilliant black with 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:33.630
 good blue pearls the wheel itself is black 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:37.530
 black even when you get the sun 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:39.990
 sees the blue metallic waiting in the 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.330
 blue lines look cool 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:44.550
 only when it picks up the sound so I liked it 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.470
 cause of it there because she is black black 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.580
 When it hits the ground it gets kind of 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.090
 blue pearls 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:57.780
 so cool, so damn good 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:03:01.019
 come here is golden because it does not 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.459
 I could find it then I did the cleaning. 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:09.720
 All motor and I also 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:12.000
 Also cool wash of golds 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.459
 only I already see many thousand rounded up 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.830
 and the guys do the service does not stay 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:18.510
 very good then I looked for the legal gold 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:20.040
 could not find even taking 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.959
 cool golden because someone always goes 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.360
 talking could be darker could 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:26.130
 To be clearer then I opted for black 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.330
 It's my pleasure, it 's what I like and it's 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:30.870
 that's important, right? 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:32.430
 so come on, I did that, not that 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:38.269
 wheel painting 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:38.269
 the wheel balance alignment is and 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:43.500
 cool and I'm using now and the guys 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:48.420
 city ​​club that I wanted to show 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:50.340
 You motorcycle king that road is right. 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:54.320
 that he has different in the other 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:04:00.959
 I wore this one and a half white too 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:04:02.690
 it turns white in the chain once and 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:07.670
 really enjoyed 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:08.180
 is a club that does not loose a thorn in the 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:10.360
 wheel 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:13.340
 no way did i go the first time 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:16.910
 I used that I rode the bike twice in 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:19.850
 Our thousand in a time novelty did not explain 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:21.739
 nothing on the wheel so logical you go 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:23.480
 apply it will let it dry and leave 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:27.590
 dry for a couple of hours, right? 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:29.300
 leaves the skin drying out the timbu 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:31.250
 It's just that I capped enough current 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:33.710
 but it's good that already 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:37.610
 protects the chain well does not spoil 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:39.230
 has a premature wear and that's it 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:42.700
 I indicate this is not sponsored here 

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:45.380
 No way for the engine in anything else is 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:48.010
 good product is of great quality then 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:49.520
 I'll point out to you, you 're wearing that one. 

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:52.730
 club here 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:55.400
 in the motes kings grands law that while the 

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:56.870
 speedy is good 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:58.730
 I think the most top you have there for us 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:00.080
 today in the market, at least here 

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:04.610
 national 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:07.390
 That 's it, it 's good, my good, my moto. 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:07.390
 it was very good 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:14.330
 exceeded my expectations is not because 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:16.070
 I thought the wheel meant to stay 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:18.020
 very good so I opted in the middle but liked it 

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:20.090
 Holy shit if it was to change color. 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:22.340
 I would not trade the pizzeria even if she 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:26.120
 Black she was well well here now 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:28.280
 It was really cool, I fucking liked it, right. 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:30.380
 in the future I had to paint wheel 

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:33.410
 again it will not be this bike will be the 

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:35.240
 my next bike so I already have it 

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:36.800
 More or less what I want in the other is 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:39.890
 totally different is no longer a 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:44.630
 naked then I'll keep 100,000 like this 

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:46.940
 most original because it was already the 

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:47.720
 time to stay there changing a lot of the 

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:50.930
 bike right 

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:55.690

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:13.010
 they all did a job here 

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:18.020
 excellent job here on the bike and now 

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:19.280
 it is only to walk without novelty just by going back to 

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:21.860
 track to go right 

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:24.500
 Logic here on the wheel rim I'm still going 

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:25.850
 put a ribbon on the monster 

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:28.280
 I think I will not put it on. 

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:30.080
 monster monster monster - blue whiting and 

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:32.360
 put that big sticker on after 

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:33.640
 more ahead, because this wheel 

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:35.870
 has not yet been polished she is 

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:37.520
 practically two and kanu so let's go 

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:38.780

 Thank you guys, God bless. 

00:06:56.570 --> 00:07:02.150
 sorry for the absence of the most 

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:04.400
 unfortunately I just did not have more time to 

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:07.160
 to really do was really difficult 

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:09.280
 doing some work work is not 

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:12.170
 which is taking up enough time then 

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:14.590
 Luckily I do not owe it to beauty, that's it. 

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:17.980
