00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:23.330
 in the 15th century in Italy is when it 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:28.279
 the rebirth begins, that's why we speak 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:31.310
 of 480 because it is the year 1400 1820 30 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:34.040
 etcetera throughout that 15th century that 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:36.930
 in Italian it is called 480 the same as 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:40.920
 been 16 is called cinquecento 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.570
 that is the 80's etc for being so Italian 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.890
 this moment is why we talk about 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:51.230
 art of quattrocento in italy so 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:53.870
 in the 15th century there will be a 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:57.020
 true revolution in the history of 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:59.920
 art that without absolutely breaking with the 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:02.449
 past presupposes new budgets 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.309
 of which will largely depart 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:07.550
 all that is the figurative tradition 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:10.670
 the artistic tradition until in the 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:13.670
 20th century the avant-garde of the 20th century 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.680
 break that conception of space 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.350
 figurative that was generated in the 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.390
 Renaissance 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:22.299
 first of all because it's called 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:25.150
 rebirth among other reasons but the 

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:28.479
 fundamental is because it occurs 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:30.390
 The aim is to seek a rebirth of the art of 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:32.700
 classical antiquity 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:37.260
 It is the rebirth of the art of antiquity 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:39.930
 classic is not a copy that have it very 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:43.320
 in account is not a copy this is about 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:46.380
 an emulation it is a new 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.960
 creation inspired by that art of 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:52.200
 classic antiquity in many cases with 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.060
 A clear desire to excel is a 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.840
 term taken from the rhetoric is from the 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:00.300
 emulation and I guess the meaning 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.789
 they are perfectly clear, we are not 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:05.670
 talking about a copy for example 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:08.940
 we are seeing the church or we are going to see 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:14.100
 the church of san lorenzo de 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:16.080
 brunelleschi in photography and in this 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.050
 image for example we can see how 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.780
 Brunelleschi in this Florentine church 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:23.940
 is using the classic orders of 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.709
 classical antiquity this is a 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:29.850
 Church of the Quattrocento of course 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:31.920
 with the Corinthian order and then do something 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:35.280
 which is that it places above the order 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:37.130
 Corinthian of this order with his house his 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.840
 shaft its capital 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.820
 taken clearly from antiquity 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.790
 classic places a fragment of 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:46.130
 entablamento to increase the height of 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.530
 the church that is something that does not 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.900
 we would probably find in art 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:53.210
 of classical antiquity but really 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.250
 or the same in these pilasters really 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:57.200
 is taking this model of the 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:00.200
 classical antiquity and it is 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:02.210
 inspiring to recover it for 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.830
 overcome it and so on based on all 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:07.420
 the remnants that remain of that antiquity 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:07.420
 classic that you can study
