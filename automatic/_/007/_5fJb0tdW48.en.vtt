00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:56.910 
let's get a little break on that that
way<00:01:54.729> so<00:01:54.789> I<00:01:54.969> have<00:01:55.119> to<00:01:55.209> replace<00:01:55.509> that<00:01:55.740> with<00:01:56.740> this

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
way so I have to replace that with this

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.959 
way so I have to replace that with this
one<00:01:57.159> so<00:01:57.340> I<00:01:57.369> could<00:01:57.520> put<00:01:57.640> a<00:01:57.670> screw<00:01:57.939> in<00:01:57.969> it<00:01:58.799> okay

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
one so I could put a screw in it okay

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:05.370 
one so I could put a screw in it okay
now<00:02:01.200> put<00:02:02.200> that<00:02:02.229> in<00:02:03.209> pretty<00:02:04.209> much<00:02:04.270> all<00:02:04.689> my<00:02:05.079> kegs

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
now put that in pretty much all my kegs

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.660 
now put that in pretty much all my kegs
are<00:02:06.009> in<00:02:06.219> there<00:02:06.399> satisfied<00:02:07.240> with<00:02:07.450> that<00:02:08.429> and<00:02:09.429> now

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
are in there satisfied with that and now

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.780 
are in there satisfied with that and now
I'm<00:02:09.849> going<00:02:10.090> to<00:02:10.179> proceed<00:02:10.539> to<00:02:11.250> get<00:02:12.250> ready<00:02:12.489> here

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
I'm going to proceed to get ready here

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.390 
I'm going to proceed to get ready here
to<00:02:13.030> unmount<00:02:13.870> the<00:02:14.079> motherboard<00:02:14.620> and<00:02:14.860> then

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
to unmount the motherboard and then

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.580 
to unmount the motherboard and then
mount<00:02:15.670> it<00:02:15.879> in<00:02:16.000> here<00:02:16.510> but<00:02:17.110> before<00:02:17.230> I<00:02:17.410> do<00:02:17.500> that

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
mount it in here but before I do that

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.860 
mount it in here but before I do that
you'd<00:02:17.980> figure<00:02:18.280> out<00:02:18.340> what<00:02:19.150> screws<00:02:19.540> and<00:02:19.780> how

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
you'd figure out what screws and how

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.780 
you'd figure out what screws and how
many<00:02:19.930> of<00:02:20.110> them<00:02:20.319> should<00:02:20.709> have<00:02:20.829> reason<00:02:21.310> to<00:02:21.640> make

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
many of them should have reason to make

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.789 
many of them should have reason to make
this<00:02:21.940> motherboard<00:02:22.239> get<00:02:23.049> seated<00:02:23.410> properly

00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:23.799 
this motherboard get seated properly

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:26.369 
this motherboard get seated properly
right<00:02:24.190> you<00:02:24.370> um<00:02:24.579> it's<00:02:25.150> critical<00:02:25.629> to<00:02:25.660> have<00:02:25.840> been

00:02:26.369 --> 00:02:26.379 
right you um it's critical to have been

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:31.289 
right you um it's critical to have been
like<00:02:27.069> say<00:02:27.430> of<00:02:27.610> a<00:02:28.260> motherboard<00:02:29.260> are<00:02:29.730> a<00:02:30.730> manual

00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:31.299 
like say of a motherboard are a manual

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:34.199 
like say of a motherboard are a manual
for<00:02:31.329> your<00:02:31.599> motherboard<00:02:32.849> so<00:02:33.849> that<00:02:33.970> you<00:02:34.090> know

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:34.209 
for your motherboard so that you know

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:36.119 
for your motherboard so that you know
what<00:02:34.480> each<00:02:35.019> wire<00:02:35.470> is<00:02:35.650> connected<00:02:35.799> because

00:02:36.119 --> 00:02:36.129 
what each wire is connected because

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
back of the case the back case plate see

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:15.290 
back of the case the back case plate see
all<00:04:13.500> right<00:04:13.650> we're<00:04:14.400> going<00:04:14.490> to<00:04:14.580> use<00:04:14.790> the<00:04:15.090> one

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:15.300 
all right we're going to use the one

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:16.880 
all right we're going to use the one
that<00:04:15.630> came<00:04:15.780> with<00:04:15.960> the<00:04:16.020> machine<00:04:16.380> if<00:04:16.709> at<00:04:16.830> all

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:16.890 
that came with the machine if at all

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:20.390 
that came with the machine if at all
possible<00:04:17.660> but<00:04:18.660> and<00:04:19.049> I<00:04:19.770> don't<00:04:20.010> think<00:04:20.250> that's

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
possible but and I don't think that's

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.270 
possible but and I don't think that's
happening<00:04:20.549> because<00:04:20.989> it's<00:04:21.989> attached<00:04:22.350> too<00:04:23.010> much

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
happening because it's attached too much

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.420 
happening because it's attached too much
to<00:04:23.610> the<00:04:23.970> case<00:04:24.600> and<00:04:25.440> this<00:04:25.740> one<00:04:25.980> that<00:04:26.130> we<00:04:26.220> have

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
to the case and this one that we have

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:30.620 
to the case and this one that we have
here<00:04:27.950> like<00:04:28.950> the<00:04:29.370> holes<00:04:29.580> match<00:04:29.790> so<00:04:30.180> we<00:04:30.330> can<00:04:30.480> we

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:30.630 
here like the holes match so we can we

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:34.760 
here like the holes match so we can we
can<00:04:30.780> make<00:04:30.930> it<00:04:31.170> with<00:04:31.590> a<00:04:31.680> certainly<00:04:32.010> make<00:04:32.190> it

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:34.770 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:37.470 

let's<00:04:35.770> see<00:04:35.950> what<00:04:36.130> else<00:04:36.160> we<00:04:36.370> got<00:04:36.520> to<00:04:36.700> do<00:04:36.910> yeah

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:37.480 
let's see what else we got to do yeah

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.630 
let's see what else we got to do yeah
and<00:04:37.870> I<00:04:37.960> didn't<00:04:38.260> really<00:04:38.290> like<00:04:38.650> that<00:04:38.680> faceplate

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:39.640 
and I didn't really like that faceplate
