and you can read it we're charging at
eighty<00:00:29.820> six<00:00:30.090> or<00:00:30.210> three<00:00:30.390> milliamps<00:00:32.030> now<00:00:33.030> if<00:00:33.149> we

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
eighty six or three milliamps now if we

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.389 
eighty six or three milliamps now if we
take<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.540> standard<00:00:34.820> USB<00:00:35.820> P<00:00:36.180> cord<00:00:36.510> with<00:00:36.930> the

wall<00:00:38.399> charger<00:00:39.290> plug<00:00:40.290> that<00:00:40.469> in

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:48.990 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:54.200 

ah

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:00.060 

get<00:00:55.210> that<00:00:55.329> close<00:00:55.870> enough<00:00:56.020> you<00:00:56.230> can<00:00:56.380> read<00:00:56.590> it<00:00:59.070> so

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:00.070 
get that close enough you can read it so

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.660 
get that close enough you can read it so
it's<00:01:00.160> 49<00:01:00.489> 9<00:01:01.030> 6<00:01:01.480> milliamps<00:01:02.370> so<00:01:03.370> that's<00:01:03.489> a<00:01:03.550> huge

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:03.670 
it's 49 9 6 milliamps so that's a huge

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:05.580 
it's 49 9 6 milliamps so that's a huge
difference<00:01:03.809> it's<00:01:04.809> good<00:01:04.960> definitely<00:01:05.170> notice

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.590 
difference it's good definitely notice

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 
will actually drain fast and you can

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:11.250 
will actually drain fast and you can
charge<00:01:10.270> it<00:01:10.390> if<00:01:10.510> you're<00:01:10.600> using<00:01:10.750> any<00:01:10.960> sort<00:01:11.200> of

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
do it with a cut it in half that this

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.039 
do it with a cut it in half that this
makes<00:02:03.790> a<00:02:03.909> mess<00:02:04.090> and<00:02:04.360> then<00:02:04.450> you<00:02:04.540> get<00:02:04.630> four<00:02:04.840> wires

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:05.049 
makes a mess and then you get four wires

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:07.260 
makes a mess and then you get four wires

the white and green and I immunity the
solder<00:02:13.810> because<00:02:14.019> all<00:02:14.200> we<00:02:14.260> have<00:02:14.350> to<00:02:14.410> do<00:02:14.500> is<00:02:14.620> just

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:14.769 
solder because all we have to do is just

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:17.789 
solder because all we have to do is just
tie<00:02:14.950> them<00:02:15.100> together<00:02:15.250> and<00:02:15.989> short<00:02:16.989> them<00:02:17.170> and

00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:17.799 
tie them together and short them and

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:19.890 
tie them together and short them and
that<00:02:17.920> should<00:02:17.950> do<00:02:18.130> the<00:02:18.160> trick<00:02:18.250> so<00:02:18.750> I'm<00:02:19.750> going<00:02:19.870> to

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
that should do the trick so I'm going to

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.960 
that should do the trick so I'm going to
keep<00:02:20.019> cutting<00:02:20.290> the<00:02:20.350> video<00:02:20.440> in<00:02:21.310> between<00:02:21.700> just

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
keep cutting the video in between just

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:22.740 
keep cutting the video in between just
to<00:02:22.060> make<00:02:22.209> it<00:02:22.239> a<00:02:22.299> little<00:02:22.360> easier

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
to make it a little easier

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.539 
to make it a little easier
so<00:02:23.290> the<00:02:23.350> next<00:02:23.500> step<00:02:23.680> I'm<00:02:23.769> going<00:02:23.890> to<00:02:23.950> do<00:02:24.040> here<00:02:24.400> is

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:24.549 
so the next step I'm going to do here is

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:26.940 
so the next step I'm going to do here is
to<00:02:25.420> pull<00:02:25.870> these<00:02:25.959> guys<00:02:26.019> out<00:02:26.290> a<00:02:26.350> little<00:02:26.380> more<00:02:26.709> and

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
to pull these guys out a little more and

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.229 
to pull these guys out a little more and
then<00:02:27.310> I'll<00:02:27.459> be<00:02:27.549> right<00:02:27.610> back<00:02:30.120> alright<00:02:31.120> I

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:31.239 
then I'll be right back alright I

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:32.280 
then I'll be right back alright I
believe<00:02:31.299> I<00:02:31.480> got<00:02:31.600> enough<00:02:31.780> the<00:02:31.870> wires<00:02:32.079> exposed

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
believe I got enough the wires exposed

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:38.640 
believe I got enough the wires exposed

the end coming this way if your cable

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.819 
the end coming this way if your cable
just<00:02:44.320> clip<00:02:44.970> that<00:02:45.970> white<00:02:46.209> and<00:02:46.329> green<00:02:46.450> wires

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:46.829 
just clip that white and green wires

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:52.199 
just clip that white and green wires
right<00:02:47.829> off<00:02:49.560> cut<00:02:50.560> them<00:02:50.709> flush<00:02:51.120> make<00:02:52.120> sure

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
right off cut them flush make sure

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:55.640 
right off cut them flush make sure
they're<00:02:52.329> not<00:02:52.420> touching<00:02:52.600> each<00:02:52.840> other

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.390 

next<00:02:56.650> we're<00:02:56.739> going<00:02:56.830> to<00:02:56.920> take<00:02:57.010> those<00:02:57.159> white

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
next we're going to take those white

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.580 
next we're going to take those white
earring<00:02:57.610> wires<00:02:57.879> and<00:02:58.180> strip<00:02:58.750> them<00:02:58.930> now<00:02:59.260> you<00:02:59.319> can

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
earring wires and strip them now you can

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.350 
earring wires and strip them now you can
use<00:02:59.860> variety<00:03:00.220> things<00:03:00.750> you<00:03:01.750> take<00:03:01.870> a<00:03:01.930> knife<00:03:02.140> and

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
use variety things you take a knife and

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:13.520 
use variety things you take a knife and
you<00:03:04.360> can<00:03:04.450> just<00:03:05.549> gently<00:03:10.739> go<00:03:11.739> around<00:03:11.769> their<00:03:12.220> edge

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
you can just gently go around their edge

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:21.270 
you can just gently go around their edge
blade<00:03:18.540> stop<00:03:19.540> cutting<00:03:19.840> your<00:03:19.900> finger<00:03:20.200> off<00:03:20.379> or

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
blade stop cutting your finger off or

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.960 
blade stop cutting your finger off or
even<00:03:22.019> better<00:03:23.370> if<00:03:24.370> you<00:03:24.519> get<00:03:24.640> some<00:03:24.790> wire

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
even better if you get some wire

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:29.190 
even better if you get some wire
strippers<00:03:25.799> and<00:03:26.799> I<00:03:26.890> believe<00:03:27.310> these<00:03:28.079> will<00:03:29.079> go

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
strippers and I believe these will go

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.190 
strippers and I believe these will go
down<00:03:29.349> to<00:03:29.500> this<00:03:29.620> size<00:03:30.750> makes<00:03:31.750> it<00:03:31.840> even<00:03:31.989> easier

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
down to this size makes it even easier

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:40.289 
down to this size makes it even easier
and<00:03:37.799> clean<00:03:38.799> up<00:03:38.890> the<00:03:38.980> other<00:03:39.099> one<00:03:39.280> with<00:03:40.180> the

00:03:40.289 --> 00:03:40.299 
and clean up the other one with the

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:59.360 
and clean up the other one with the
strippers<00:03:40.690> since<00:03:40.900> I<00:03:41.019> have<00:03:41.200> them

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:03.920 

all<00:04:00.000> right<00:04:00.379> so<00:04:01.379> now<00:04:01.470> we<00:04:01.620> got<00:04:01.739> the<00:04:01.860> two<00:04:02.930> bare

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
all right so now we got the two bare

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.630 
all right so now we got the two bare
wires<00:04:04.170> here<00:04:05.269> so<00:04:06.269> you<00:04:06.330> get<00:04:06.450> your<00:04:06.569> green<00:04:06.810> your

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:07.640 
wires here so you get your green your

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:12.670 
wires here so you get your green your
white

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.559 

this<00:04:13.220> is<00:04:13.340> a<00:04:13.370> really<00:04:13.640> hard<00:04:13.760> part<00:04:13.970> all<00:04:14.420> right

00:04:14.559 --> 00:04:14.569 
this is a really hard part all right

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:20.319 
this is a really hard part all right
skiing<00:04:15.200> just<00:04:15.920> spinning<00:04:16.519> together<00:04:19.150> they<00:04:20.150> need

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:20.329 
skiing just spinning together they need

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:24.100 
skiing just spinning together they need
to<00:04:20.449> be<00:04:20.570> connected<00:04:22.150> shorted<00:04:23.150> out<00:04:23.240> touching

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.110 
to be connected shorted out touching

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:31.300 
to be connected shorted out touching
each<00:04:24.199> other<00:04:29.320> once<00:04:30.320> your<00:04:30.470> pause<00:04:30.680> you've<00:04:30.979> really

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:31.310 
each other once your pause you've really

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:35.460 
each other once your pause you've really
got<00:04:31.460> them<00:04:32.169> spliced<00:04:33.169> together<00:04:33.350> really<00:04:33.710> good

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:35.470 
got them spliced together really good

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:37.210 
got them spliced together really good
it's<00:04:36.470> not<00:04:36.560> really<00:04:36.770> gonna<00:04:36.860> be<00:04:36.949> any<00:04:37.070> tension

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:37.220 
it's not really gonna be any tension

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.820 
it's not really gonna be any tension
pulling<00:04:37.639> on<00:04:37.729> these<00:04:37.910> I<00:04:38.380> recommend<00:04:39.380> you<00:04:39.680> take<00:04:39.800> a

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:39.830 
pulling on these I recommend you take a

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:49.060 
pulling on these I recommend you take a
piece<00:04:39.979> of<00:04:40.009> tape<00:04:44.800> electrical<00:04:45.800> tape<00:04:47.889> don't<00:04:48.889> need

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.070 
piece of tape electrical tape don't need

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:57.420 
piece of tape electrical tape don't need
a<00:04:49.130> very<00:04:49.250> big<00:04:49.340> one<00:04:55.180> wrap<00:04:56.180> it<00:04:56.330> around<00:04:56.360> these<00:04:56.690> guys

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:57.430 
a very big one wrap it around these guys

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:01.810 
a very big one wrap it around these guys
so<00:04:58.430> it's<00:04:58.520> highly<00:04:58.850> unlikely<00:05:00.460> if<00:05:01.460> they're<00:05:01.639> come

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:01.820 
so it's highly unlikely if they're come

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:07.230 
so it's highly unlikely if they're come
apart<00:05:02.500> on<00:05:03.500> the<00:05:03.680> road<00:05:05.199> and<00:05:06.199> the<00:05:06.320> excess<00:05:06.620> tape

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:07.240 
apart on the road and the excess tape

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:19.180 
apart on the road and the excess tape
cut<00:05:08.240> it<00:05:08.360> off<00:05:16.960> stick<00:05:17.960> those<00:05:18.139> wires<00:05:18.410> back<00:05:18.919> into

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:19.190 
cut it off stick those wires back into

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:24.760 
cut it off stick those wires back into
the<00:05:19.970> cord<00:05:23.169> this<00:05:24.169> is<00:05:24.229> why<00:05:24.380> I<00:05:24.440> didn't<00:05:24.590> want<00:05:24.710> to

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:24.770 
the cord this is why I didn't want to

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:27.939 
the cord this is why I didn't want to
cut<00:05:24.919> in<00:05:25.010> half<00:05:25.990> there's<00:05:26.990> a<00:05:27.080> nice<00:05:27.289> neat<00:05:27.650> cord

00:05:27.939 --> 00:05:27.949 
cut in half there's a nice neat cord

00:05:27.949 --> 00:05:29.560 
cut in half there's a nice neat cord
still<00:05:28.250> it's<00:05:28.639> not<00:05:28.760> going<00:05:28.940> to<00:05:29.000> look<00:05:29.060> hideous<00:05:29.270> no

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:29.570 
still it's not going to look hideous no

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:34.810 
still it's not going to look hideous no
matter<00:05:29.750> where<00:05:29.900> you're<00:05:30.050> using<00:05:30.289> it<00:05:33.610> all<00:05:34.610> right

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:34.820 
matter where you're using it all right

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:42.040 
matter where you're using it all right
now<00:05:35.830> with<00:05:36.830> the<00:05:36.919> cord<00:05:37.159> buttoned<00:05:37.460> up<00:05:37.550> a<00:05:40.900> nice<00:05:41.900> big

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:42.050 
now with the cord buttoned up a nice big

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:48.100
