found-footage<00:00:09.389> movies<00:00:09.719> which<00:00:10.440> I<00:00:10.740> know<00:00:11.190> a<00:00:11.370> lot

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
found-footage movies which I know a lot

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.249 
found-footage movies which I know a lot
of<00:00:11.730> people<00:00:12.150> hate<00:00:12.420> they've<00:00:12.660> hated<00:00:12.870> it<00:00:13.110> ever

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
of people hate they've hated it ever

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.220 
of people hate they've hated it ever
since<00:00:13.650> the<00:00:13.889> Blair<00:00:14.130> Witch<00:00:14.160> Project<00:00:14.780> I've<00:00:15.780> liked

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
since the Blair Witch Project I've liked

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.870 
since the Blair Witch Project I've liked
some<00:00:16.560> of<00:00:16.710> them<00:00:16.800> it's<00:00:17.010> an<00:00:17.130> interesting<00:00:17.430> concept

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
some of them it's an interesting concept

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.279 
some of them it's an interesting concept
it's<00:00:18.390> not<00:00:18.449> something<00:00:18.960> that<00:00:19.050> should<00:00:19.260> be

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
it's not something that should be

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.130 
it's not something that should be
flooded<00:00:19.770> into<00:00:19.920> the<00:00:20.039> market<00:00:20.840> but<00:00:21.840> there's<00:00:22.020> been

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
flooded into the market but there's been

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.650 
flooded into the market but there's been
a<00:00:22.170> few<00:00:22.320> I<00:00:22.380> like<00:00:22.470> and<00:00:22.970> this<00:00:23.970> one<00:00:24.150> might<00:00:24.420> have

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
a few I like and this one might have

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:25.759 
a few I like and this one might have
some<00:00:24.930> potential<00:00:25.410> it's<00:00:25.500> got<00:00:25.619> the

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
some potential it's got the

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.880 
some potential it's got the
claustrophobia<00:00:26.580> and<00:00:27.199> I<00:00:28.199> think<00:00:28.380> it<00:00:28.439> has<00:00:28.590> a<00:00:28.619> good

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
claustrophobia and I think it has a good

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.650 
claustrophobia and I think it has a good
excuse<00:00:29.369> for<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:29.670> filming<00:00:30.119> too<00:00:30.300> which<00:00:30.510> is

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
excuse for the filming too which is

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.479 
excuse for the filming too which is
always<00:00:30.960> I<00:00:31.170> think<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.650> biggest<00:00:31.920> problem<00:00:32.399> with

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
always I think the biggest problem with

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.360 
always I think the biggest problem with
these<00:00:32.579> found-footage<00:00:32.910> movies<00:00:33.860> the<00:00:34.860> backtrack

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
these found-footage movies the backtrack

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.810 
these found-footage movies the backtrack
a<00:00:35.399> bit<00:00:35.660> this<00:00:36.660> one<00:00:36.870> is<00:00:36.960> about<00:00:37.079> apparently<00:00:37.590> ace

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:37.820 
a bit this one is about apparently ace

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:39.799 
a bit this one is about apparently ace
originally<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:38.940> Apollo<00:00:39.239> space<00:00:39.690> program

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
originally the Apollo space program

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.139 
originally the Apollo space program
ended<00:00:40.410> with<00:00:40.559> Apollo<00:00:40.890> 17<00:00:41.520> after<00:00:41.850> that<00:00:41.969> they

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
ended with Apollo 17 after that they

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.760 
ended with Apollo 17 after that they
thought<00:00:42.300> it<00:00:42.360> was<00:00:42.570> kind<00:00:43.140> of<00:00:43.200> a<00:00:43.320> waste<00:00:43.469> of<00:00:43.680> money

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
thought it was kind of a waste of money

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.729 
thought it was kind of a waste of money
and<00:00:44.480> so<00:00:45.480> they<00:00:45.570> canceled<00:00:45.930> follow<00:00:46.079> it<00:00:46.230> Apollo<00:00:46.559> 18

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
and so they canceled follow it Apollo 18

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.510 
and so they canceled follow it Apollo 18
this<00:00:47.610> one's<00:00:47.850> about<00:00:48.000> a<00:00:48.710> apparently<00:00:49.710> secret

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
this one's about a apparently secret

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.959 
this one's about a apparently secret
mission<00:00:50.940> that<00:00:51.149> was<00:00:51.329> launched<00:00:52.760> looks<00:00:53.760> like

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
mission that was launched looks like

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.000 
mission that was launched looks like
probably<00:00:54.239> to<00:00:54.510> follow<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:55.079> Soviets<00:00:55.620> trying<00:00:55.920> to

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
probably to follow the Soviets trying to

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.639 
probably to follow the Soviets trying to
land<00:00:56.160> on<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.399> moon<00:00:56.430> which<00:00:57.289> will<00:00:58.289> get<00:00:58.440> him<00:00:58.530> to

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
land on the moon which will get him to

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.299 
land on the moon which will get him to
that<00:00:58.800> if<00:00:59.010> when<00:00:59.609> the<00:00:59.820> movie<00:01:00.030> comes<00:01:00.149> out<00:01:00.420> and

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:01.309 
that if when the movie comes out and

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:04.789 
that if when the movie comes out and
well<00:01:02.309> they<00:01:03.180> wind<00:01:03.480> up<00:01:03.600> finding<00:01:04.019> something<00:01:04.439> on

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
well they wind up finding something on

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.280 
well they wind up finding something on
the<00:01:04.979> moon<00:01:05.159> in<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.420> trailers<00:01:06.780> we<00:01:06.930> don't<00:01:07.110> really

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
the moon in the trailers we don't really

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.100 
the moon in the trailers we don't really
see<00:01:07.500> much<00:01:07.790> we<00:01:08.790> see<00:01:09.000> at<00:01:09.150> one<00:01:09.390> scene<00:01:09.720> there's

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
see much we see at one scene there's

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.750 
see much we see at one scene there's
like<00:01:10.200> a<00:01:10.290> spider<00:01:10.740> looking<00:01:11.070> creature<00:01:11.340> inside

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
like a spider looking creature inside

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.649 
like a spider looking creature inside
the<00:01:11.909> guy's<00:01:12.060> helmet<00:01:14.060> my<00:01:15.060> guess<00:01:15.299> is<00:01:15.540> that's

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
the guy's helmet my guess is that's

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.630 
the guy's helmet my guess is that's
probably<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.259> stage<00:01:16.590> one<00:01:16.920> of<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.220> aliens

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
probably the stage one of the aliens

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.410 
probably the stage one of the aliens
like<00:01:17.759> a<00:01:17.850> face<00:01:18.060> hugger<00:01:18.299> type<00:01:18.570> thing<00:01:18.810> but<00:01:19.560> uh<00:01:20.420> you

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
like a face hugger type thing but uh you

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.850 
like a face hugger type thing but uh you
get<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.720> basic<00:01:22.049> gist<00:01:22.170> they<00:01:22.380> get<00:01:22.500> to<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.710> moon

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
get the basic gist they get to the moon

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.100 
get the basic gist they get to the moon
to<00:01:23.040> get<00:01:23.130> out<00:01:23.340> start<00:01:24.119> looking<00:01:24.360> around<00:01:24.450> starting

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
to get out start looking around starting

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.600 
to get out start looking around starting
to<00:01:25.259> see<00:01:25.350> there's<00:01:25.530> something<00:01:25.770> out<00:01:25.890> there

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:27.610 
to see there's something out there

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:29.630 
to see there's something out there
what<00:01:28.240> I<00:01:28.270> said<00:01:28.780> earlier<00:01:28.840> though<00:01:29.290> about

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
what I said earlier though about

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.850 
what I said earlier though about
potential<00:01:30.640> is<00:01:30.880> that<00:01:32.490> it's<00:01:33.490> kind<00:01:33.760> of<00:01:33.850> hard<00:01:34.270> like

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
potential is that it's kind of hard like

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.530 
potential is that it's kind of hard like
to<00:01:35.860> explain<00:01:36.310> why<00:01:36.490> people<00:01:36.520> are<00:01:36.910> still<00:01:37.150> filming

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:37.540 
to explain why people are still filming

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.460 
to explain why people are still filming
stuff<00:01:37.840> in<00:01:38.080> these<00:01:38.650> types<00:01:38.920> of<00:01:39.040> situations

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
stuff in these types of situations

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.230 
stuff in these types of situations
because<00:01:41.470> you<00:01:42.400> wouldn't<00:01:42.730> carry<00:01:42.970> around

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 
because you wouldn't carry around

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.240 
because you wouldn't carry around
cameras<00:01:43.690> and<00:01:43.840> continue<00:01:44.110> to<00:01:44.200> film<00:01:44.440> like<00:01:44.979> most

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 
cameras and continue to film like most

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.940 
cameras and continue to film like most
people<00:01:45.490> would<00:01:45.820> like<00:01:46.150> in<00:01:46.930> the<00:01:47.200> Blair<00:01:47.410> Witch<00:01:47.440> how

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
people would like in the Blair Witch how

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.100 
people would like in the Blair Witch how
much<00:01:48.160> that<00:01:48.430> would<00:01:48.580> they<00:01:48.729> have<00:01:48.850> film<00:01:49.120> that<00:01:49.420> you

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
much that would they have film that you

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.280 
much that would they have film that you
had<00:01:50.290> a<00:01:50.320> little<00:01:50.710> bit<00:01:50.890> more<00:01:50.950> of<00:01:51.220> an<00:01:51.310> excuse<00:01:51.760> with

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
had a little bit more of an excuse with

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.370 
had a little bit more of an excuse with
quarantine<00:01:53.290> because<00:01:53.500> it<00:01:53.979> was<00:01:54.160> a<00:01:54.190> news<00:01:54.520> crew

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
quarantine because it was a news crew

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.520 
quarantine because it was a news crew
but<00:01:56.380> still<00:01:57.420> but<00:01:58.420> towards<00:01:58.960> the<00:01:58.990> later<00:01:59.229> part<00:01:59.320> of

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
but still but towards the later part of

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.170 
but still but towards the later part of
that<00:01:59.590> from<00:01:59.830> them<00:01:59.920> you<00:02:00.009> were<00:02:00.100> like<00:02:00.220> why<00:02:00.820> is<00:02:00.880> he

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:01.180 
that from them you were like why is he

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.370 
that from them you were like why is he
still<00:02:01.360> have<00:02:01.479> the<00:02:01.509> camera<00:02:03.720> almost<00:02:04.720> the<00:02:05.200> same

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
still have the camera almost the same

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.170 
still have the camera almost the same
extent<00:02:05.710> of<00:02:05.800> in<00:02:06.250> Cloverfield<00:02:06.640> although<00:02:07.030> at

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:07.180 
extent of in Cloverfield although at

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:08.699 
extent of in Cloverfield although at
least<00:02:07.210> Cloverfield<00:02:08.020> it<00:02:08.170> wasn't<00:02:08.410> like<00:02:08.500> one<00:02:08.619> of

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709 
least Cloverfield it wasn't like one of

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:10.199 
least Cloverfield it wasn't like one of
those<00:02:08.830> really<00:02:09.040> supposed<00:02:09.790> to<00:02:09.820> be<00:02:09.910> one<00:02:10.060> of<00:02:10.119> those

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
those really supposed to be one of those

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:12.750 
those really supposed to be one of those
really<00:02:10.390> tiny<00:02:10.780> cameras<00:02:11.440> so<00:02:12.340> you<00:02:12.400> can<00:02:12.550> kind<00:02:12.730> of

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
really tiny cameras so you can kind of

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.449 
really tiny cameras so you can kind of
see<00:02:12.940> that<00:02:13.060> it's<00:02:13.209> just<00:02:13.330> on<00:02:13.780> his<00:02:13.959> risk<00:02:14.250> but<00:02:15.250> this

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
see that it's just on his risk but this

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:17.550 
see that it's just on his risk but this
one<00:02:15.670> I<00:02:15.700> think<00:02:16.000> probably<00:02:16.209> has<00:02:16.540> the<00:02:16.690> best<00:02:16.989> excuse

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
one I think probably has the best excuse

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.650 
one I think probably has the best excuse
in<00:02:17.800> that<00:02:18.010> when<00:02:18.730> they're<00:02:18.850> inside<00:02:19.270> like<00:02:19.540> the

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
in that when they're inside like the

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.270 
in that when they're inside like the
little<00:02:19.870> Apollo<00:02:20.380> and<00:02:20.650> nothing<00:02:20.920> at<00:02:21.010> whatever

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
little Apollo and nothing at whatever

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.330 
little Apollo and nothing at whatever

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
the lunar make a lander there's a camera

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:25.380 
the lunar make a lander there's a camera
set<00:02:24.640> up<00:02:24.670> in<00:02:24.820> air<00:02:24.970> that<00:02:25.060> just<00:02:25.239> constantly

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
set up in air that just constantly

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.790 
set up in air that just constantly
records<00:02:26.080> okay<00:02:27.000> so<00:02:28.000> it's<00:02:28.150> not<00:02:28.209> them<00:02:28.510> I<00:02:28.660> I<00:02:29.590> don't

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
records okay so it's not them I I don't

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.890 
records okay so it's not them I I don't
know<00:02:30.250> why<00:02:30.430> they<00:02:30.550> had<00:02:30.670> never<00:02:30.790> done<00:02:31.120> more<00:02:31.660> these

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900
