as<00:00:08.580> we<00:00:08.790> continue<00:00:09.269> our<00:00:09.300> discussion<00:00:10.139> of<00:00:10.230> chord

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
as we continue our discussion of chord

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.009 
as we continue our discussion of chord
voicings<00:00:11.280> we<00:00:12.030> did<00:00:12.240> look<00:00:12.450> at<00:00:12.599> some<00:00:12.809> different

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
voicings we did look at some different

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:14.900 
voicings we did look at some different
chord<00:00:13.440> voicings<00:00:13.950> that<00:00:14.099> are<00:00:14.190> conducive<00:00:14.340> to<00:00:14.700> the

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
chord voicings that are conducive to the

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:21.320 
chord voicings that are conducive to the
funk<00:00:15.500> style<00:00:18.380> another<00:00:19.380> way<00:00:19.619> to<00:00:19.680> approach<00:00:20.330> chord

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
funk style another way to approach chord

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.189 
funk style another way to approach chord
voicings<00:00:21.990> in<00:00:22.199> comping<00:00:23.130> is<00:00:23.310> to<00:00:23.970> use<00:00:24.240> inversions

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
voicings in comping is to use inversions

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.429 
voicings in comping is to use inversions
so<00:00:25.710> for<00:00:26.070> instance<00:00:26.130> say<00:00:26.699> you<00:00:26.760> have<00:00:27.090> an<00:00:27.240> a7<00:00:28.080> chord

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
so for instance say you have an a7 chord

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.220 
so for instance say you have an a7 chord
here<00:00:29.369> in<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:29.880> second<00:00:30.660> position<00:00:30.779> of<00:00:31.140> the

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
here in the second position of the

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.950 
here in the second position of the
guitar<00:00:31.759> this<00:00:32.759> would<00:00:33.000> be<00:00:33.149> an<00:00:33.270> inversion<00:00:33.630> of<00:00:33.899> the

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
guitar this would be an inversion of the

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.420 
guitar this would be an inversion of the
a7<00:00:34.710> in<00:00:34.980> a<00:00:35.130> drop<00:00:35.520> to<00:00:35.850> voicing<00:00:36.540> and<00:00:37.070> so<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.219> notes

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
a7 in a drop to voicing and so the notes

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.319 
a7 in a drop to voicing and so the notes
that<00:00:38.670> we<00:00:38.790> have<00:00:39.059> this<00:00:39.360> would<00:00:39.600> be<00:00:39.809> a<00:00:40.280> second<00:00:41.329> a

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
that we have this would be a second a

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.959 
that we have this would be a second a
second<00:00:43.230> inversion<00:00:43.559> a7<00:00:44.550> chord<00:00:44.820> you<00:00:44.940> have<00:00:45.090> e<00:00:45.649> may

00:00:46.959 --> 00:00:46.969 
second inversion a7 chord you have e may

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:52.220 
second inversion a7 chord you have e may

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
being the flat 7 of that cord so now if

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.689 
being the flat 7 of that cord so now if
you<00:00:59.399> move<00:00:59.579> it<00:00:59.730> up<00:00:59.850> an<00:00:59.969> inversion<00:01:00.410> we<00:01:01.410> have<00:01:01.710> the

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
you move it up an inversion we have the

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.469 
you move it up an inversion we have the
third<00:01:03.120> inversion<00:01:03.780> of<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.229> a7<00:01:05.159> chord<00:01:05.479> which

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
third inversion of the a7 chord which

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.609 
third inversion of the a7 chord which

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.850 
sharp which the third e which is the 5th
and<00:01:14.430> then<00:01:14.460> a<00:01:15.119> which<00:01:15.780> is<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:16.259> root<00:01:16.530> of<00:01:16.650> that

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
on the high E string the c-sharp which

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.310 
on the high E string the c-sharp which
is<00:01:38.320> the<00:01:38.470> major<00:01:38.680> 3rd<00:01:39.100> and<00:01:39.450> then<00:01:40.450> boom<00:01:40.870> the<00:01:40.900> last

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.320 
is the major 3rd and then boom the last

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:46.020 
is the major 3rd and then boom the last
one<00:01:41.560> here<00:01:41.830> we<00:01:42.520> have<00:01:44.130> this<00:01:45.130> particular<00:01:45.520> chord

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
one here we have this particular chord

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.020 
one here we have this particular chord
here<00:01:46.390> is<00:01:46.600> the<00:01:47.110> first<00:01:47.620> inversion<00:01:48.070> of<00:01:48.310> the<00:01:48.370> a7

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030 
here is the first inversion of the a7

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.390 
here is the first inversion of the a7
chord<00:01:49.270> and<00:01:49.450> you<00:01:49.930> have<00:01:50.080> C<00:01:50.500> sharp<00:01:50.980> which<00:01:51.250> is

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:51.400 
chord and you have C sharp which is

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.990 
chord and you have C sharp which is
third<00:01:51.880> you<00:01:52.600> have<00:01:52.750> G<00:01:53.110> which<00:01:53.320> is<00:01:53.470> the<00:01:53.590> flat<00:01:53.830> 7<00:01:54.370> you

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 
third you have G which is the flat 7 you

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.210 
third you have G which is the flat 7 you
have<00:01:55.120> a<00:01:55.360> which<00:01:55.870> is<00:01:55.900> the<00:01:56.170> root<00:01:56.380> and<00:01:56.530> then<00:01:57.070> you

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:57.220 
have a which is the root and then you

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:59.880 
have a which is the root and then you
also<00:01:57.370> have<00:01:57.580> B<00:01:58.000> which<00:01:58.360> is<00:01:58.390> the<00:01:58.690> fifth<00:01:59.050> so<00:01:59.800> you

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
also have B which is the fifth so you

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.620 
also have B which is the fifth so you
have<00:02:00.250> all<00:02:00.640> these<00:02:01.420> different<00:02:01.720> versions<00:02:02.650> of<00:02:03.630> the

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
have all these different versions of the

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:10.949 
have all these different versions of the
cord<00:02:04.960> here<00:02:05.880> now<00:02:06.880> as<00:02:07.470> we<00:02:08.470> talked<00:02:08.740> earlier<00:02:09.959> you

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 
cord here now as we talked earlier you

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:13.800 
cord here now as we talked earlier you
can<00:02:11.170> add<00:02:11.380> tensions<00:02:12.130> you<00:02:12.880> know<00:02:13.030> on<00:02:13.240> a<00:02:13.270> dominant

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
can add tensions you know on a dominant

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.140 
can add tensions you know on a dominant
7<00:02:14.140> some<00:02:14.350> common<00:02:14.800> tensions<00:02:15.310> that<00:02:15.520> are<00:02:15.580> gray<00:02:15.880> are

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
7 some common tensions that are gray are

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:21.750 
7 some common tensions that are gray are
nine<00:02:17.520> Thirteen's<00:02:19.410> like<00:02:20.410> I<00:02:20.560> said<00:02:20.830> in<00:02:21.040> a<00:02:21.070> work

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
nine Thirteen's like I said in a work

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.810 
nine Thirteen's like I said in a work
very<00:02:22.209> well<00:02:22.300> with<00:02:22.930> the<00:02:23.110> funk<00:02:23.380> style<00:02:23.680> guitar<00:02:23.890> but

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:24.820 
very well with the funk style guitar but

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:26.430 
very well with the funk style guitar but
I'm<00:02:24.910> going<00:02:25.060> to<00:02:25.120> demonstrate<00:02:25.300> just<00:02:25.990> using

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
I'm going to demonstrate just using

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.110 
I'm going to demonstrate just using
different<00:02:27.390> inversions<00:02:28.390> within<00:02:29.170> a<00:02:30.120> chord

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
different inversions within a chord

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.570 
different inversions within a chord
progression<00:02:31.709> so<00:02:32.709> I'm<00:02:32.770> just<00:02:32.950> going<00:02:33.100> to<00:02:33.160> go<00:02:33.250> and

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
progression so I'm just going to go and

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.970 
progression so I'm just going to go and
move<00:02:33.820> up<00:02:34.030> the<00:02:34.209> inversions<00:02:34.870> on<00:02:35.050> an<00:02:35.170> a7<00:02:35.769> chord
