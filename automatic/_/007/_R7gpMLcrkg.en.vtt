00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 hello to all today we're going 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:04.710
 see how to make rhombuses 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.859
 honey and almonds 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:13.380
 we will need as an ingredient of the zest 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:16.640
 of orange 250 g of honey 250 grams 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.960
 almonds and flour 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:32.250
 first of all we will hit our 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:35.239
 orange to take the zest and then 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:38.010
 we are going to crack in a world 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:50.850
 so I'm using the technique with a 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:53.430
 hammer and we proceed in the same way 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.750
 for all the rest of the fines there 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.750
 then add our best 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:18.439
 and then using a wooden spoon 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:20.600
 mix properly we add then 

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:27.979
 flour as it goes 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:28.670
 to form a beautiful, non-sticky paste 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:30.319
 paw and bret 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.079
 we will then spread it on a plate 

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:36.700
 with parchment paper so we go 

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:36.700
 make about 1 cm thick 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:44.060
 here we bake then ten minutes to 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:45.409
 190 Â° this is our plan that cooked 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:51.200
 we then come to position our 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:52.909
 cake on our board then we 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.179
 let's go cut in eleven years so we 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:02:04.539
 first cuts slats at an angle in 

00:01:56.179 --> 00:02:04.539
 that sense about a centimeter and a half 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:22.120
 then skew in the other direction always 

00:02:14.749 --> 00:02:22.120
 one centimeter to get diamonds 

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:28.219
 we will have obtained a diamond of 

00:02:27.469 --> 00:02:32.409
 honey and almonds 

00:02:28.219 --> 00:02:32.409
 good tasting see you soon goodbye
