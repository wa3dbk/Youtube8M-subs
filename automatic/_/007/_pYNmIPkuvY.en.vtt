going<00:01:58.950> to<00:01:59.040> go<00:01:59.130> for<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.399> simplest<00:01:59.939> probably

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
going to go for the simplest probably

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.920 
going to go for the simplest probably
and<00:02:01.409> it's<00:02:02.340> really<00:02:02.610> effective<00:02:03.060> so<00:02:03.360> this<00:02:03.780> is

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
and it's really effective so this is

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.719 
and it's really effective so this is
going<00:02:04.079> to<00:02:04.140> work<00:02:04.200> the<00:02:05.159> first<00:02:05.369> thing<00:02:05.490> I<00:02:05.520> want<00:02:05.640> to

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
going to work the first thing I want to

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.680 
going to work the first thing I want to
do<00:02:05.820> is<00:02:05.969> take<00:02:06.210> my<00:02:06.450> my<00:02:07.380> date<00:02:08.129> my<00:02:08.520> code<00:02:09.090> to<00:02:09.119> open<00:02:09.360> my

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
do is take my my date my code to open my

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.010 
do is take my my date my code to open my
database<00:02:10.140> rather<00:02:10.590> connect<00:02:11.250> to<00:02:11.400> my<00:02:11.520> database

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
database rather connect to my database

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.400 
database rather connect to my database
and<00:02:12.200> selecting<00:02:13.160> my<00:02:13.280> database<00:02:13.760> I<00:02:14.170> want<00:02:15.170> to<00:02:15.230> take

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
and selecting my database I want to take

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.390 
and selecting my database I want to take
this<00:02:15.590> up<00:02:15.830> to<00:02:16.510> just<00:02:17.510> where<00:02:17.810> the<00:02:18.370> submit<00:02:19.370> button

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
this up to just where the submit button

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.440 
this up to just where the submit button
is<00:02:19.820> checked<00:02:21.010> so<00:02:22.010> what<00:02:22.610> we've<00:02:22.730> got<00:02:22.910> is<00:02:23.060> we<00:02:23.240> just

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
is checked so what we've got is we just

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.290 
is checked so what we've got is we just
connecting<00:02:24.230> to<00:02:24.260> the<00:02:24.380> database<00:02:25.030> inside<00:02:26.030> here

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
connecting to the database inside here

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.450 
connecting to the database inside here
and<00:02:26.720> then<00:02:26.840> under<00:02:27.140> here<00:02:27.320> I<00:02:27.380> can<00:02:27.680> start<00:02:27.950> my<00:02:28.160> code

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:28.460 
and then under here I can start my code

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:31.930 
and then under here I can start my code
to<00:02:28.730> check<00:02:29.240> my<00:02:29.630> username<00:02:30.500> now<00:02:30.820> bear<00:02:31.820> in<00:02:31.850> mind

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
to check my username now bear in mind

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.300 
to check my username now bear in mind
you<00:02:32.180> can<00:02:32.390> put<00:02:32.570> your<00:02:32.660> check<00:02:32.900> anywhere<00:02:33.310> for

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
you can put your check anywhere for

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:35.740 
you can put your check anywhere for
simplicity<00:02:34.640> I'm<00:02:35.000> just<00:02:35.180> going<00:02:35.330> to<00:02:35.390> shove<00:02:35.570> it<00:02:35.660> in

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
simplicity I'm just going to shove it in

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.570 
simplicity I'm just going to shove it in
here<00:02:35.990> and<00:02:36.170> I'm<00:02:36.470> gonna<00:02:36.620> kill<00:02:36.890> the<00:02:37.070> rest<00:02:37.340> of<00:02:37.490> the

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
here and I'm gonna kill the rest of the

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.680 
here and I'm gonna kill the rest of the
script<00:02:37.940> if<00:02:38.450> the<00:02:38.900> user<00:02:40.240> name<00:02:41.240> has<00:02:41.360> already<00:02:41.570> been

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
script if the user name has already been

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.020 
script if the user name has already been
found<00:02:41.930> you<00:02:42.470> can<00:02:42.590> put<00:02:42.770> it<00:02:42.860> anywhere<00:02:42.920> a<00:02:43.430> bear<00:02:43.970> in

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
found you can put it anywhere a bear in

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.700 
found you can put it anywhere a bear in
mind<00:02:44.150> if<00:02:44.270> you<00:02:44.360> are<00:02:44.540> using<00:02:44.750> a<00:02:44.930> full-length<00:02:45.320> page

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:45.710 
mind if you are using a full-length page

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:48.760 
mind if you are using a full-length page
and<00:02:46.010> it<00:02:46.070> is<00:02:46.190> your<00:02:46.340> website<00:02:47.020> the<00:02:48.020> dive<00:02:48.380> function

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:48.770 
and it is your website the dive function

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:49.960 
and it is your website the dive function
is<00:02:48.830> going<00:02:48.920> to<00:02:48.980> cut<00:02:49.220> off<00:02:49.310> the<00:02:49.400> rest<00:02:49.580> of<00:02:49.670> the<00:02:49.730> code

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
is going to cut off the rest of the code

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.380 
is going to cut off the rest of the code
so<00:02:50.030> I<00:02:50.300> don't<00:02:50.510> recommend<00:02:50.600> using<00:02:50.990> this<00:02:51.260> I

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
so I don't recommend using this I

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.390 
so I don't recommend using this I
recommend<00:02:53.390> encasing<00:02:54.230> what<00:02:54.740> the<00:02:55.070> checks<00:02:55.340> that

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
recommend encasing what the checks that

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.940 
recommend encasing what the checks that
you<00:02:55.580> already<00:02:55.760> have<00:02:56.470> inside<00:02:57.470> an<00:02:57.620> if<00:02:57.740> statement

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
you already have inside an if statement

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.030 
you already have inside an if statement
and<00:02:58.330> not<00:02:59.330> really<00:02:59.630> to<00:02:59.810> kill<00:03:00.140> the<00:03:00.260> script<00:03:00.560> but

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
and not really to kill the script but

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.790 
and not really to kill the script but
you<00:03:01.340> will<00:03:01.490> get<00:03:01.970> the<00:03:02.090> general<00:03:02.600> idea<00:03:03.410> of<00:03:03.440> it<00:03:03.590> here

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:03.800 
you will get the general idea of it here

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.190 
you will get the general idea of it here
and<00:03:04.100> how<00:03:05.030> to<00:03:05.090> work<00:03:05.390> what<00:03:05.630> we're<00:03:05.750> trying<00:03:05.900> to<00:03:06.050> do

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
and how to work what we're trying to do

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.730 
and how to work what we're trying to do
so<00:03:07.130> let<00:03:07.550> me<00:03:07.640> get<00:03:07.790> on<00:03:07.880> with<00:03:07.910> it<00:03:08.500> what<00:03:09.500> we<00:03:09.590> need

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:09.740 
so let me get on with it what we need

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:11.410 
so let me get on with it what we need
what<00:03:10.010> we<00:03:10.130> need<00:03:10.160> to<00:03:10.370> do<00:03:10.520> is<00:03:10.730> we<00:03:10.940> need<00:03:11.060> to<00:03:11.180> set<00:03:11.300> up

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
what we need to do is we need to set up

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:16.120 
what we need to do is we need to set up
a<00:03:11.480> query<00:03:11.780> that<00:03:12.140> specifies<00:03:14.050> taking<00:03:15.050> a<00:03:15.200> record

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
a query that specifies taking a record

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:18.760 
a query that specifies taking a record
with<00:03:16.370> a<00:03:16.400> with<00:03:16.910> a<00:03:16.940> particular<00:03:17.360> username<00:03:17.840> so<00:03:18.530> I'm

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:18.770 
with a with a particular username so I'm

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:22.180 
with a with a particular username so I'm
gonna<00:03:18.950> set<00:03:19.250> up<00:03:19.280> my<00:03:20.110> name<00:03:21.110> check<00:03:21.470> query<00:03:21.920> here

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
gonna set up my name check query here

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:23.980 
gonna set up my name check query here
I'm<00:03:22.580> gonna<00:03:22.760> give<00:03:22.940> it<00:03:22.970> a<00:03:23.060> name<00:03:23.240> check<00:03:23.510> the

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:23.990 
I'm gonna give it a name check the

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:26.290 
I'm gonna give it a name check the
variable<00:03:24.530> name<00:03:24.650> name<00:03:24.860> check<00:03:25.100> and<00:03:26.060> this<00:03:26.180> is

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:26.300 
variable name name check and this is

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:29.020 
variable name name check and this is
going<00:03:26.480> to<00:03:26.570> be<00:03:26.630> my<00:03:27.260> SQL<00:03:27.680> query<00:03:27.950> I'm<00:03:28.850> gonna

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 
going to be my SQL query I'm gonna

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:33.180 
going to be my SQL query I'm gonna
select<00:03:29.390> let's<00:03:29.870> say<00:03:30.050> username<00:03:30.380> for<00:03:31.630> simplicity

select let's say username for simplicity

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:36.100 
select let's say username for simplicity
this<00:03:34.190> is<00:03:34.370> not<00:03:34.580> going<00:03:34.730> to<00:03:34.820> select<00:03:35.660> all<00:03:35.870> the<00:03:35.960> bits

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:36.110 
this is not going to select all the bits

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:37.720 
this is not going to select all the bits
of<00:03:36.200> data<00:03:36.380> like<00:03:36.890> with<00:03:37.070> the<00:03:37.130> Gator<00:03:37.310> for<00:03:37.400> use<00:03:37.580> in

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:39.760 
of data like with the Gator for use in
Asterix<00:03:38.150> it's<00:03:38.330> gonna<00:03:38.450> take<00:03:38.690> more<00:03:38.840> time<00:03:39.080> so<00:03:39.650> I'm

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:39.770 
Asterix it's gonna take more time so I'm

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:44.200 
Asterix it's gonna take more time so I'm
selecting<00:03:39.920> username<00:03:40.700> from<00:03:42.400> users<00:03:43.400> since

selecting username from users since

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:47.200 
selecting username from users since
that's<00:03:44.450> our<00:03:44.660> table<00:03:45.290> name<00:03:45.560> down<00:03:45.710> here<00:03:45.770> and<00:03:46.250> I'm

that's our table name down here and I'm

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:51.190 
that's our table name down here and I'm
gonna<00:03:47.360> say<00:03:47.630> where<00:03:48.430> username<00:03:49.430> is<00:03:50.240> equal<00:03:50.750> to<00:03:50.930> and

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:51.200 
gonna say where username is equal to and

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:54.090 
gonna say where username is equal to and
if<00:03:51.830> we<00:03:52.010> look<00:03:52.160> up<00:03:52.280> here<00:03:52.580> the<00:03:53.060> user<00:03:53.420> name<00:03:53.630> the

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:54.100 
if we look up here the user name the

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:57.010 
if we look up here the user name the
person<00:03:55.100> submits<00:03:56.030> to<00:03:56.150> the<00:03:56.240> form<00:03:56.510> is<00:03:56.750> in<00:03:56.930> the

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:57.020 
person submits to the form is in the

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:58.930 
person submits to the form is in the
variable<00:03:57.230> name<00:03:57.410> username<00:03:57.890> so<00:03:58.610> we<00:03:58.700> can<00:03:58.820> just

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
variable name username so we can just

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.110 
variable name username so we can just
come<00:03:59.150> down<00:03:59.180> here<00:03:59.630> and<00:03:59.780> type<00:04:00.440> in<00:04:00.650> username<00:04:01.120> now

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 
come down here and type in username now

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.930 
come down here and type in username now
as<00:04:02.300> it<00:04:02.420> stands<00:04:02.690> if<00:04:02.960> I<00:04:03.110> were<00:04:03.350> to<00:04:03.590> say<00:04:03.830> choose<00:04:04.730> the

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:04.940 
as it stands if I were to say choose the

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:08.710 
as it stands if I were to say choose the
name<00:04:05.120> Alex<00:04:05.900> this<00:04:06.770> would<00:04:06.980> select<00:04:07.370> every<00:04:08.120> record

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:08.720 
name Alex this would select every record

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.410 
name Alex this would select every record
in<00:04:09.080> the<00:04:09.140> database<00:04:09.410> that<00:04:09.890> has<00:04:10.130> the<00:04:10.160> name<00:04:10.880> Alex

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:11.420 
in the database that has the name Alex

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:13.030 
in the database that has the name Alex
as<00:04:11.630> we<00:04:11.990> can<00:04:12.140> see<00:04:12.260> there's<00:04:12.440> one<00:04:12.470> at<00:04:12.830> the<00:04:12.890> moment

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
as we can see there's one at the moment

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.640 
as we can see there's one at the moment
now<00:04:13.910> if<00:04:14.060> I<00:04:14.210> was<00:04:14.360> to<00:04:14.480> specify<00:04:14.990> in<00:04:15.230> this<00:04:15.410> case

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:15.650 
now if I was to specify in this case

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:17.770 
now if I was to specify in this case
with<00:04:15.890> this<00:04:16.040> only<00:04:16.310> one<00:04:16.549> record<00:04:16.940> if<00:04:17.359> I<00:04:17.540> were<00:04:17.660> to

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780 
with this only one record if I were to

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:21.180 
with this only one record if I were to
specify<00:04:17.989> the<00:04:18.260> username<00:04:18.650> as<00:04:19.160> Dale<00:04:19.670> for<00:04:20.090> example

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.190 
specify the username as Dale for example

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:23.740 
specify the username as Dale for example
no<00:04:22.190> records<00:04:22.580> will<00:04:22.760> be<00:04:22.790> returned

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:23.750 
no records will be returned

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:27.400 
no records will be returned
so<00:04:24.440> therefore<00:04:25.400> the<00:04:26.270> username<00:04:26.660> wouldn't<00:04:27.200> exist

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:27.410 
so therefore the username wouldn't exist

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:29.410 
so therefore the username wouldn't exist
if<00:04:27.590> no<00:04:27.800> records<00:04:27.950> are<00:04:28.250> returned<00:04:28.550> so<00:04:29.150> we<00:04:29.240> need<00:04:29.390> a

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:29.420 
if no records are returned so we need a

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:32.080 
if no records are returned so we need a
function<00:04:29.870> to<00:04:29.900> check<00:04:30.400> how<00:04:31.400> many<00:04:31.460> records<00:04:31.820> are

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.090 
function to check how many records are

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:34.690 
function to check how many records are
returned<00:04:32.450> and<00:04:32.720> you<00:04:33.110> can<00:04:33.260> do<00:04:33.410> this<00:04:33.590> I'm<00:04:34.550> going

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:34.700 
returned and you can do this I'm going

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:37.060 
returned and you can do this I'm going
to<00:04:34.790> create<00:04:34.910> a<00:04:35.000> count<00:04:35.240> variable<00:04:35.630> and<00:04:36.020> it<00:04:36.770> is

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.070 
to create a count variable and it is

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:40.720 
to create a count variable and it is
MySQL<00:04:37.970> num<00:04:38.210> rows<00:04:38.630> and<00:04:39.200> it<00:04:39.830> just<00:04:40.010> returns<00:04:40.400> the

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:40.730 
MySQL num rows and it just returns the

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:44.920 
MySQL num rows and it just returns the
amount<00:04:41.210> of<00:04:41.710> records<00:04:42.820> or<00:04:43.820> rows<00:04:44.120> rather<00:04:44.390> that

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:44.930 
amount of records or rows rather that

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:48.340 
amount of records or rows rather that
contain<00:04:45.350> within<00:04:45.980> your<00:04:46.490> query<00:04:47.270> which<00:04:47.870> we<00:04:47.900> have

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:48.350 
contain within your query which we have

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:50.920 
contain within your query which we have
called<00:04:48.530> name<00:04:48.800> check<00:04:49.040> so<00:04:49.730> let's<00:04:50.540> just<00:04:50.750> test

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:50.930 
called name check so let's just test

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:53.560 
called name check so let's just test
this<00:04:51.140> I'm<00:04:52.070> going<00:04:52.190> to<00:04:52.250> echo<00:04:52.580> out<00:04:52.790> count<00:04:53.210> and

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:53.570 
this I'm going to echo out count and

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:55.270 
this I'm going to echo out count and
then<00:04:54.260> I'm<00:04:54.350> just<00:04:54.380> going<00:04:54.620> to<00:04:54.680> kill<00:04:54.920> the<00:04:55.040> script

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:55.280 
then I'm just going to kill the script

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:57.520 
then I'm just going to kill the script
so<00:04:55.520> the<00:04:55.610> rest<00:04:55.760> of<00:04:55.880> it<00:04:55.970> doesn't<00:04:56.120> execute<00:04:56.540> and

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:57.530 
so the rest of it doesn't execute and

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:00.790 
so the rest of it doesn't execute and
I'm<00:04:58.160> going<00:04:58.310> to<00:04:58.370> return<00:04:58.610> to<00:04:58.790> register<00:04:59.620> and<00:05:00.620> I'm

the password isn't going to be checks
we've<00:05:17.419> killed<00:05:17.630> the<00:05:17.720> script<00:05:18.050> so<00:05:18.770> if<00:05:19.160> I<00:05:19.340> just<00:05:19.550> put

to<00:05:34.940> change<00:05:35.240> this<00:05:35.360> to<00:05:35.540> Alex<00:05:39.070> and<00:05:40.070> that<00:05:40.700> would<00:05:40.970> be

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:41.330 
to change this to Alex and that would be

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:43.120 
to change this to Alex and that would be
with<00:05:41.450> a<00:05:41.479> small<00:05:41.780> a<00:05:41.810> because<00:05:42.350> well<00:05:42.590> in<00:05:42.800> fact<00:05:43.040> I

with a small a because well in fact I

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:49.300 
with a small a because well in fact I

think we've got no script tags the way

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:52.240 
think we've got no script tags the way
to<00:05:49.660> deal<00:05:50.660> with<00:05:50.780> case<00:05:50.990> sensitivity<00:05:51.530> as<00:05:51.830> well<00:05:51.979> so

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:52.250 
to deal with case sensitivity as well so

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:54.490 
to deal with case sensitivity as well so
this<00:05:52.370> is<00:05:52.520> another<00:05:52.790> pointer<00:05:53.240> here's<00:05:53.900> when

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:54.500 
this is another pointer here's when

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:56.050 
this is another pointer here's when
we're<00:05:54.680> taking<00:05:54.919> the<00:05:55.100> username<00:05:55.520> into<00:05:55.669> account

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:56.060 
we're taking the username into account

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:57.850 
we're taking the username into account
what<00:05:56.750> we're<00:05:56.870> going<00:05:56.990> to<00:05:57.050> do<00:05:57.169> is<00:05:57.380> we're<00:05:57.590> going<00:05:57.770> to

00:05:57.850 --> 00:05:57.860 
what we're going to do is we're going to

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:05.050 
what we're going to do is we're going to
say<00:05:58.479> an<00:06:00.250> STR<00:06:01.250> to<00:06:01.430> lower<00:06:01.460> so<00:06:02.150> STR<00:06:02.750> to<00:06:03.020> lower<00:06:04.060> so

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:05.060 
say an STR to lower so STR to lower so

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:06.340 
say an STR to lower so STR to lower so
just<00:06:05.390> to<00:06:05.450> make<00:06:05.540> sure<00:06:05.690> we're<00:06:05.840> always<00:06:05.990> comparing

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:06.350 
just to make sure we're always comparing

and<00:06:08.490> what<00:06:08.939> we're<00:06:09.029> going<00:06:09.119> to<00:06:09.210> do<00:06:09.360> here<00:06:09.599> is<00:06:09.900> we

00:06:10.459 --> 00:06:10.469 
and what we're going to do here is we

00:06:10.469 --> 00:06:12.890 
and what we're going to do here is we
are<00:06:10.499> going<00:06:10.830> to<00:06:10.919> let<00:06:11.430> me<00:06:11.490> just<00:06:11.669> find<00:06:11.909> it<00:06:12.119> click

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:12.900 
are going to let me just find it click

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:15.320 
are going to let me just find it click
register<00:06:13.409> and<00:06:13.619> we<00:06:14.490> can<00:06:14.610> see<00:06:14.669> the<00:06:14.789> value<00:06:15.059> of<00:06:15.089> one

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:15.330 
register and we can see the value of one

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:16.189 
register and we can see the value of one
is<00:06:15.569> returned

00:06:16.189 --> 00:06:16.199 
is returned

00:06:16.199 --> 00:06:17.989 
is returned
so<00:06:16.589> really<00:06:16.979> the<00:06:17.189> check<00:06:17.460> that<00:06:17.639> we're<00:06:17.759> looking

00:06:17.989 --> 00:06:17.999 
so really the check that we're looking

00:06:17.999 --> 00:06:21.019 
so really the check that we're looking
for<00:06:18.210> here<00:06:18.419> the<00:06:18.599> if<00:06:18.719> statement<00:06:19.229> is<00:06:19.349> if<00:06:20.029> this

00:06:21.019 --> 00:06:21.029 
for here the if statement is if this

00:06:21.029 --> 00:06:22.399 
for here the if statement is if this
variable<00:06:21.539> that<00:06:21.629> we<00:06:21.719> recurring<00:06:22.110> out<00:06:22.259> at<00:06:22.349> the

00:06:22.399 --> 00:06:22.409 
variable that we recurring out at the

00:06:22.409 --> 00:06:26.570 
variable that we recurring out at the
moment<00:06:22.800> is<00:06:22.919> not<00:06:23.789> equal<00:06:24.479> to<00:06:24.509> zero<00:06:25.159> then<00:06:26.159> we<00:06:26.399> need

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:26.580 
moment is not equal to zero then we need

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:29.059 
moment is not equal to zero then we need
to<00:06:26.789> tell<00:06:27.599> the<00:06:27.719> user<00:06:27.839> that<00:06:28.050> the<00:06:28.529> username<00:06:28.949> is

00:06:29.059 --> 00:06:29.069 
to tell the user that the username is

00:06:29.069 --> 00:06:31.279 
to tell the user that the username is
already<00:06:29.189> registered<00:06:29.719> so<00:06:30.719> here<00:06:30.930> what<00:06:31.080> we<00:06:31.169> can

00:06:31.279 --> 00:06:31.289 
already registered so here what we can

00:06:31.289 --> 00:06:33.139 
already registered so here what we can
do<00:06:31.439> is<00:06:31.680> create<00:06:31.830> a<00:06:32.009> simple<00:06:32.309> if<00:06:32.399> statement<00:06:32.430> and

00:06:33.139 --> 00:06:33.149 
do is create a simple if statement and

00:06:33.149 --> 00:06:38.769 
do is create a simple if statement and
our<00:06:33.960> block<00:06:34.289> and<00:06:35.189> we<00:06:35.369> can<00:06:35.490> say<00:06:35.699> if<00:06:35.999> our<00:06:37.309> count

00:06:38.769 --> 00:06:38.779 
our block and we can say if our count

00:06:38.779 --> 00:06:42.170 
our block and we can say if our count
doesn't<00:06:39.779> equal<00:06:40.169> zero<00:06:40.409> meaning<00:06:41.159> there<00:06:41.999> is<00:06:42.029> a

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:42.180 
doesn't equal zero meaning there is a

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:44.059 
doesn't equal zero meaning there is a
record<00:06:42.360> present<00:06:42.960> under<00:06:43.379> this<00:06:43.499> condition

00:06:44.059 --> 00:06:44.069 
record present under this condition

00:06:44.069 --> 00:06:46.360 
record present under this condition
where<00:06:44.249> the<00:06:44.370> username<00:06:44.699> is<00:06:44.969> already<00:06:45.259> specified

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:46.370 
where the username is already specified

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:48.619 
where the username is already specified
then<00:06:47.370> we<00:06:47.460> can<00:06:47.580> just<00:06:47.759> kill<00:06:47.909> the<00:06:48.089> script<00:06:48.330> and

00:06:48.619 --> 00:06:48.629 
then we can just kill the script and

00:06:48.629 --> 00:06:52.850 
then we can just kill the script and
just<00:06:49.439> say<00:06:50.120> username<00:06:51.120> already<00:06:51.649> taken<00:06:52.649> or

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:52.860 
just say username already taken or

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:55.700 
just say username already taken or
whatever<00:06:53.610> you<00:06:53.789> want<00:06:54.330> to<00:06:54.419> put<00:06:54.449> so<00:06:55.409> coming<00:06:55.680> back

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:55.710 
whatever you want to put so coming back

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:58.399 
whatever you want to put so coming back
here<00:06:55.830> to<00:06:56.129> refresh<00:06:56.490> we<00:06:56.759> can<00:06:56.789> choose<00:06:57.749> Alex<00:06:58.110> and
