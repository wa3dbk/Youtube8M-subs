00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:10.769
 Hello, our culture with 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:12.920
 plastic is 5 polystyrene seal without 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:12.920
 lamination 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:32.810
 the sphere we have here is such a sphere is the floor 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.810
 man and now we will 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:01:00.430
 the equipment is still new but still burning 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.430
 so you can see smoke 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.780
 I didnâ€™t pull a little bit 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:26.680
 great weather plastic that's okay 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:29.439
 for and rush quite fit like that 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:32.049
 look important pump let's see 

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:34.210
 what happened here as you see 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:36.159
 top top 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:39.360
 the picture turned out good 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:43.149
 Wonderful you sprained a little 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:46.869
 radius of the hemisphere is a normal say 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:49.770
 so the phenomenon of plastic here but we are at the edges 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:52.840
 also see how we cracked 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:56.619
 cracked seal you can see these here 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:59.409
 white what furrows are plastic 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:02.950
 when stretched along with him not 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:05.830
 paint is stretched 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:10.569
 minus that is if we want to get with 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:14.080
 using print Christmas ball New Year 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:21.069
 it is better to choose a fairy tale print area 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:27.549
 somewhere halfway to half the height at 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:29.620
 half the height and diameter of the hemisphere then 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:31.750
 There is here in this area seal she as 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:42.989
 would have been preserved and in principle 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:42.989
 She can continue to look good.
