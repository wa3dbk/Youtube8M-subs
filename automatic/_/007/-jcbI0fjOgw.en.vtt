still<00:02:15.670> there<00:02:16.090> but<00:02:16.239> it's<00:02:16.390> not<00:02:16.450> as<00:02:16.660> bad<00:02:16.840> as<00:02:16.900> it

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
still there but it's not as bad as it

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:23.520 
still there but it's not as bad as it
was<00:02:17.470> on<00:02:17.709> the<00:02:18.040> first<00:02:18.310> day<00:02:18.959> but<00:02:19.959> this<00:02:20.620> oh<00:02:21.420> I<00:02:22.530> know

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
was on the first day but this oh I know

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.949 
was on the first day but this oh I know
the<00:02:23.860> flakes<00:02:24.190> are<00:02:24.430> just<00:02:24.849> way<00:02:25.060> too<00:02:25.120> much<00:02:25.630> and<00:02:25.870> I

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
the flakes are just way too much and I

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:28.620 
the flakes are just way too much and I
think<00:02:26.200> it's<00:02:26.349> because<00:02:26.680> I<00:02:26.920> was<00:02:27.600> generous<00:02:28.600> with

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
think it's because I was generous with

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.140 
think it's because I was generous with
it<00:02:28.959> so<00:02:29.260> I'm<00:02:29.709> gonna<00:02:29.890> do<00:02:30.130> another<00:02:30.370> one<00:02:30.520> I'm<00:02:30.940> gonna

yet but I did get flicking and which is
quite<00:02:46.870> a<00:02:46.900> shame<00:02:47.200> with<00:02:47.890> others<00:02:48.220> some<00:02:48.519> other

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
quite a shame with others some other

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.039 
quite a shame with others some other
problems<00:02:49.060> out<00:02:49.300> there<00:02:50.170> are<00:02:50.680> my<00:02:50.830> staples<00:02:51.370> I<00:02:51.610> do

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
problems out there are my staples I do

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:55.410 
problems out there are my staples I do
apply<00:02:53.049> a<00:02:53.080> lot<00:02:53.410> of<00:02:53.560> them<00:02:53.799> and<00:02:54.130> I<00:02:54.940> don't<00:02:55.239> get

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
apply a lot of them and I don't get

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.080 
apply a lot of them and I don't get
flicking<00:02:55.840> with<00:02:55.870> that<00:02:56.140> but<00:02:56.410> this<00:02:56.709> I<00:02:57.160> guess<00:02:57.940> I

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
flicking with that but this I guess I

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.120 
flicking with that but this I guess I
don't<00:02:58.150> need<00:02:58.510> to<00:02:58.569> apply<00:02:58.989> too<00:02:59.260> much<00:02:59.290> so<00:03:00.069> I'm

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
don't need to apply too much so I'm

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.610 
don't need to apply too much so I'm
gonna<00:03:00.310> try<00:03:00.700> that<00:03:00.730> and<00:03:01.299> see<00:03:01.330> how<00:03:02.319> that<00:03:02.560> works

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
gonna try that and see how that works
