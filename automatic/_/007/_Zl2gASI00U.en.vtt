increase my strength after eight or ten

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.109 
increase my strength after eight or ten
weeks<00:00:14.820> will<00:00:15.179> I<00:00:15.210> lose<00:00:15.750> my<00:00:15.780> energy<00:00:16.670> well<00:00:17.670> that's

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
weeks will I lose my energy well that's

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
training consistently and with great

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.910 
training consistently and with great
intensity<00:00:25.859> the<00:00:26.820> biggest<00:00:27.180> issue<00:00:27.330> is<00:00:27.920> replacing

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
intensity the biggest issue is replacing

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.120 
intensity the biggest issue is replacing
muscle<00:00:29.550> sugar<00:00:29.820> or<00:00:30.090> glycogen<00:00:30.750> so<00:00:31.470> that<00:00:31.710> person

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
muscle sugar or glycogen so that person

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.160 
muscle sugar or glycogen so that person
can<00:00:32.160> get<00:00:32.399> ready<00:00:32.640> for<00:00:32.700> the<00:00:32.940> next<00:00:33.360> workout<00:00:33.870> if

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
can get ready for the next workout if

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.860 
can get ready for the next workout if
you<00:00:34.710> don't<00:00:34.920> do<00:00:35.280> this<00:00:35.550> you<00:00:36.329> begin<00:00:36.480> to<00:00:36.690> feel

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
you don't do this you begin to feel

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.110 
you don't do this you begin to feel
tired<00:00:37.260> your<00:00:37.649> workouts<00:00:38.040> begin<00:00:38.370> to<00:00:38.460> fade<00:00:38.760> your

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
tired your workouts begin to fade your

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.000 
tired your workouts begin to fade your
strength<00:00:39.390> and<00:00:39.570> stamina<00:00:39.809> begins<00:00:40.620> to<00:00:40.800> fail

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
strength and stamina begins to fail

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.190 
strength and stamina begins to fail
that's<00:00:41.760> why<00:00:41.969> I<00:00:42.000> tell<00:00:42.270> people<00:00:42.420> when<00:00:43.020> you're

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
that's why I tell people when you're

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.010 
that's why I tell people when you're
training<00:00:43.620> hard<00:00:44.040> and<00:00:44.370> consistently<00:00:45.239> you<00:00:45.840> want

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
training hard and consistently you want

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.049 
training hard and consistently you want
to<00:00:46.110> take<00:00:46.289> in<00:00:46.440> some<00:00:46.680> type<00:00:46.890> of<00:00:46.920> sugary<00:00:47.760> drink

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
to take in some type of sugary drink

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.970 
to take in some type of sugary drink
like<00:00:48.239> Gatorade<00:00:48.809> after<00:00:49.260> your<00:00:49.410> workout<00:00:49.770> because

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
like Gatorade after your workout because

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.670 
like Gatorade after your workout because
that<00:00:50.219> speeds<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:51.210> glycogen<00:00:51.719> replacement

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
that speeds the glycogen replacement

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.970 
that speeds the glycogen replacement
process<00:00:53.300> so<00:00:54.300> again<00:00:54.629> as<00:00:54.870> your<00:00:55.410> training<00:00:55.710> day

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
process so again as your training day

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.099 
process so again as your training day
after<00:00:56.280> day<00:00:56.430> week<00:00:56.670> after<00:00:56.850> week<00:00:57.030> your<00:00:57.750> body<00:00:57.960> is

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
after day week after week your body is

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.959 
after day week after week your body is
able<00:00:58.199> to<00:00:58.379> replace<00:00:58.680> that<00:00:58.739> glycogen<00:00:59.190> so<00:00:59.789> you<00:00:59.850> can

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
able to replace that glycogen so you can

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.279 
able to replace that glycogen so you can
get<00:01:00.090> ready<00:01:00.239> for<00:01:00.390> your<00:01:00.480> next<00:01:00.600> workout

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
get ready for your next workout

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.460 
get ready for your next workout
but<00:01:01.949> if<00:01:02.100> you're<00:01:02.280> not<00:01:02.460> training<00:01:03.120> hard<00:01:03.470> really

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
but if you're not training hard really

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.010 
but if you're not training hard really
isn't<00:01:04.710> gonna<00:01:04.799> make<00:01:05.010> a<00:01:05.040> difference

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020 
isn't gonna make a difference

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.100 
isn't gonna make a difference
proteins<00:01:07.020> can<00:01:07.320> be<00:01:07.439> converted<00:01:07.860> into<00:01:08.159> sugars<00:01:09.150> so

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
proteins can be converted into sugars so

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.250 
proteins can be converted into sugars so
the<00:01:10.979> real<00:01:11.220> answer<00:01:11.460> is<00:01:12.210> you<00:01:12.930> can<00:01:13.080> utilize

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
the real answer is you can utilize

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.850 
the real answer is you can utilize
proteins<00:01:14.189> to<00:01:15.180> replace<00:01:15.540> glycogen<00:01:16.170> but<00:01:16.740> the

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
proteins to replace glycogen but the

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.679 
proteins to replace glycogen but the
question<00:01:17.340> is<00:01:17.460> it's<00:01:17.670> going<00:01:17.759> to<00:01:17.820> depend<00:01:17.970> on<00:01:18.330> you

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
question is it's going to depend on you

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.410 
question is it's going to depend on you
how<00:01:19.439> hard<00:01:19.770> are<00:01:19.860> you<00:01:19.890> training<00:01:20.460> are<00:01:20.700> those

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
how hard are you training are those

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.450 
how hard are you training are those
proteins<00:01:22.049> going<00:01:22.320> to<00:01:22.380> be<00:01:22.500> able<00:01:22.590> to<00:01:22.740> replace

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
proteins going to be able to replace

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.450 
proteins going to be able to replace
your<00:01:23.670> glycogen<00:01:24.479> in<00:01:25.049> enough<00:01:25.590> time<00:01:25.830> to<00:01:25.890> get<00:01:26.310> you

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
your glycogen in enough time to get you

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.960 
your glycogen in enough time to get you
ready<00:01:26.610> for<00:01:26.939> your<00:01:27.150> next<00:01:27.360> workout<00:01:28.340> so<00:01:29.340> my

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
ready for your next workout so my

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.170 
ready for your next workout so my
suggestion<00:01:30.450> is<00:01:30.689> you<00:01:31.350> try<00:01:31.650> it<00:01:31.710> you<00:01:32.610> tell<00:01:32.909> me<00:01:33.030> how

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
suggestion is you try it you tell me how

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.899 
suggestion is you try it you tell me how
you<00:01:33.240> feel<00:01:33.860> because<00:01:34.860> if<00:01:35.100> you're<00:01:35.220> not<00:01:35.250> training

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
you feel because if you're not training

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.100 
you feel because if you're not training
crazy<00:01:36.689> hard<00:01:37.200> or<00:01:37.680> you<00:01:38.640> know<00:01:38.759> very<00:01:39.150> consistently

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
crazy hard or you know very consistently

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.100 
crazy hard or you know very consistently
you<00:01:40.740> might<00:01:40.920> be<00:01:41.040> able<00:01:41.159> to<00:01:41.220> do<00:01:41.430> it<00:01:41.579> me<00:01:42.270> I<00:01:42.479> can't<00:01:42.899> do

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
you might be able to do it me I can't do

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.330 
you might be able to do it me I can't do
it<00:01:43.229> I<00:01:43.350> gotta<00:01:43.380> have<00:01:43.890> some<00:01:44.130> type<00:01:44.310> of

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
it I gotta have some type of

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.880 
it I gotta have some type of
carbohydrates<00:01:45.149> in<00:01:45.299> my<00:01:45.509> diet<00:01:45.810> because<00:01:46.470> I<00:01:46.680> just

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
carbohydrates in my diet because I just

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.399 
carbohydrates in my diet because I just
don't<00:01:47.100> have<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.430> snap<00:01:47.729> if<00:01:47.939> I<00:01:48.060> don't<00:01:48.299> will<00:01:49.290> it

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
don't have the snap if I don't will it

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.870 
don't have the snap if I don't will it
affect<00:01:49.710> your<00:01:49.979> size<00:01:50.460> and<00:01:50.970> your<00:01:51.600> strength<00:01:52.200> again

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
affect your size and your strength again

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.760 
affect your size and your strength again
depends<00:01:53.880> on<00:01:53.970> how<00:01:54.119> hard<00:01:54.390> you<00:01:54.479> train<00:01:54.869> does<00:01:55.649> it

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
depends on how hard you train does it

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.550 
depends on how hard you train does it
affect<00:01:56.070> my<00:01:56.549> size<00:01:56.850> well<00:01:57.210> I<00:01:57.240> you<00:01:58.200> know<00:01:58.229> we<00:01:58.439> all

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
affect my size well I you know we all

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.770 
affect my size well I you know we all
feel<00:01:58.590> bigger<00:01:59.430> when<00:01:59.729> we're<00:01:59.909> you<00:02:00.270> know<00:02:00.420> filled

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
feel bigger when we're you know filled

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.230 
feel bigger when we're you know filled
with<00:02:00.869> carbohydrates<00:02:01.560> and<00:02:01.740> water<00:02:02.030> maybe<00:02:03.030> it's

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.060 
with carbohydrates and water maybe it's
a<00:02:03.299> perception<00:02:03.630> thing<00:02:04.020> I<00:02:04.290> don't<00:02:04.439> think<00:02:04.680> I<00:02:04.770> look

a perception thing I don't think I look

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
does it affect my strength absolutely

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.570 
does it affect my strength absolutely
because<00:02:09.479> I<00:02:09.750> don't<00:02:10.170> have<00:02:10.349> that<00:02:10.619> power<00:02:11.160> that

because I don't have that power that
snap<00:02:12.090> because<00:02:12.569> I<00:02:12.690> haven't

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
snap because I haven't

just<00:02:19.970> doesn't<00:02:20.300> do<00:02:20.450> it<00:02:20.480> for<00:02:20.629> me<00:02:20.959> now<00:02:21.769> again

that we're talking about healthy
carbohydrates<00:02:29.510> and<00:02:29.930> you<00:02:30.260> also<00:02:30.379> have<00:02:30.680> to

00:02:30.789 --> 00:02:30.799 
carbohydrates and you also have to

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:33.400 
carbohydrates and you also have to
remember<00:02:31.069> this<00:02:31.400> that<00:02:32.239> if<00:02:32.360> you're<00:02:32.690> an<00:02:32.840> athlete

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
remember this that if you're an athlete

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.920 
remember this that if you're an athlete
and<00:02:33.709> you're<00:02:34.069> training<00:02:34.450> consistently<00:02:35.480> with

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
and you're training consistently with

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.979 
and you're training consistently with
intensity<00:02:36.500> your<00:02:37.040> body<00:02:37.340> utilizes

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:37.989 
intensity your body utilizes

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:40.960 
intensity your body utilizes
carbohydrates<00:02:38.989> much<00:02:39.500> better<00:02:39.830> your<00:02:40.670> body

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
carbohydrates much better your body

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.229 
carbohydrates much better your body
doesn't<00:02:41.420> release<00:02:41.840> tons<00:02:42.560> of<00:02:42.920> insulin<00:02:43.519> in<00:02:43.940> order

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:44.239 
doesn't release tons of insulin in order

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:45.940 
doesn't release tons of insulin in order
to<00:02:44.360> clear<00:02:44.599> the<00:02:44.720> sugar<00:02:44.989> from<00:02:45.530> the<00:02:45.590> bloodstream

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
to clear the sugar from the bloodstream

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.280 
to clear the sugar from the bloodstream
because<00:02:46.459> your<00:02:46.640> body's<00:02:47.000> utilizing<00:02:47.840> that<00:02:47.989> sugar

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
because your body's utilizing that sugar

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.130 
because your body's utilizing that sugar
and<00:02:48.530> therefore<00:02:49.459> your<00:02:49.910> body<00:02:50.209> doesn't<00:02:50.780> require

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
and therefore your body doesn't require

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.500 
and therefore your body doesn't require
as<00:02:51.500> much<00:02:51.739> insulin<00:02:52.370> because<00:02:53.090> you're<00:02:53.239> a<00:02:53.269> body

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
as much insulin because you're a body

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.380 
as much insulin because you're a body
assimilates<00:02:53.930> sugar<00:02:54.920> and<00:02:55.220> uses<00:02:55.549> insulin<00:02:56.180> much

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
assimilates sugar and uses insulin much

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.240 
assimilates sugar and uses insulin much
better<00:02:56.840> so<00:02:57.590> when<00:02:57.769> you<00:02:57.860> hear<00:02:58.069> these<00:02:58.190> things

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
better so when you hear these things

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.729 
better so when you hear these things
about<00:02:58.730> low<00:02:59.390> carb<00:02:59.690> diets<00:03:00.110> through<00:03:00.319> the<00:03:00.470> best

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:00.739 
about low carb diets through the best

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:02.910 
about low carb diets through the best
and<00:03:01.099> that's<00:03:01.340> not<00:03:01.579> quite<00:03:01.849> accurate<00:03:02.150> because

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
and that's not quite accurate because

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.280 
and that's not quite accurate because
you<00:03:03.920> can<00:03:04.099> still<00:03:04.459> get<00:03:04.640> fat<00:03:04.940> on<00:03:05.180> a<00:03:05.269> low-carb<00:03:06.200> diet

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
you can still get fat on a low-carb diet

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.430 
you can still get fat on a low-carb diet
if<00:03:06.769> you<00:03:07.220> eat<00:03:07.489> enough<00:03:07.790> calories<00:03:08.440> because

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
if you eat enough calories because

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.559 
if you eat enough calories because
weight<00:03:09.799> loss<00:03:09.980> comes<00:03:10.280> from<00:03:10.489> a<00:03:10.579> calorie<00:03:11.000> deficit

00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:11.569 
weight loss comes from a calorie deficit

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:14.319 
weight loss comes from a calorie deficit
regardless<00:03:12.290> of<00:03:12.470> what<00:03:12.620> you<00:03:12.799> eat<00:03:12.950> is<00:03:13.220> it<00:03:14.180> a

regardless of what you eat is it a

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:17.400 
regardless of what you eat is it a
little<00:03:14.629> easier<00:03:15.140> to<00:03:15.410> lose<00:03:15.530> weight<00:03:15.860> on<00:03:16.099> a<00:03:16.299> lower

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
little easier to lose weight on a lower

little easier to lose weight on a lower
carbohydrate<00:03:18.410> diet<00:03:19.280> yes<00:03:20.209> it<00:03:20.420> is<00:03:20.540> because<00:03:20.959> the

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:21.109 
carbohydrate diet yes it is because the

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:25.240 
carbohydrate diet yes it is because the
average<00:03:21.799> person<00:03:22.549> isn't<00:03:23.269> very<00:03:23.750> active<00:03:24.260> doesn't

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
average person isn't very active doesn't

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.520 
average person isn't very active doesn't
utilize<00:03:25.459> carbohydrates<00:03:26.420> very<00:03:26.630> well<00:03:26.930> they

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
utilize carbohydrates very well they

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:29.650 
utilize carbohydrates very well they
store<00:03:27.950> fat<00:03:28.250> rather<00:03:28.549> quickly<00:03:28.940> because<00:03:29.180> they're

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:29.660 
store fat rather quickly because they're

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:32.259 
store fat rather quickly because they're
not<00:03:29.840> active<00:03:30.440> their<00:03:31.040> metabolism<00:03:31.819> doesn't

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:32.269 
not active their metabolism doesn't

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:35.020 
not active their metabolism doesn't
utilize<00:03:32.450> calories<00:03:33.260> effectively<00:03:33.920> and<00:03:34.160> as<00:03:34.790> they

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
utilize calories effectively and as they

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.920 
utilize calories effectively and as they
become<00:03:35.260> lazier<00:03:36.260> and<00:03:36.530> fatter<00:03:37.250> their<00:03:38.090> body<00:03:38.420> has

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:38.930 
become lazier and fatter their body has

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:42.849 
become lazier and fatter their body has
to<00:03:39.290> use<00:03:39.590> more<00:03:40.329> insulin<00:03:41.329> to<00:03:41.630> clear<00:03:42.410> the<00:03:42.560> sugar

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:42.859 
to use more insulin to clear the sugar

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:45.460 
to use more insulin to clear the sugar
from<00:03:43.280> the<00:03:43.340> bloodstream<00:03:43.760> and<00:03:44.329> pull<00:03:44.900> it<00:03:44.959> into

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
from the bloodstream and pull it into

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:48.430 
from the bloodstream and pull it into
the<00:03:45.590> cells<00:03:45.859> for<00:03:46.190> utilization<00:03:46.780> so<00:03:47.780> that<00:03:48.019> is<00:03:48.200> why

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
the cells for utilization so that is why

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.770 
the cells for utilization so that is why
as<00:03:48.769> Americans<00:03:49.760> become<00:03:50.180> fatter<00:03:50.480> and<00:03:50.690> fatter

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
as Americans become fatter and fatter

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.409 
as Americans become fatter and fatter
and<00:03:51.049> fatter<00:03:51.430> type-2<00:03:52.430> diabetes

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:53.419 
and fatter type-2 diabetes

00:03:53.419 --> 00:03:55.360 
and fatter type-2 diabetes
becomes<00:03:54.019> greater<00:03:54.319> and<00:03:54.440> greater<00:03:54.709> because<00:03:55.040> they

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
becomes greater and greater because they

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:58.449 
becomes greater and greater because they
become<00:03:55.700> more<00:03:56.019> insulin<00:03:57.019> resistant<00:03:57.680> so<00:03:58.310> that

00:03:58.449 --> 00:03:58.459 
become more insulin resistant so that

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:00.580 
become more insulin resistant so that
means<00:03:58.730> their<00:03:59.000> body<00:03:59.180> has<00:03:59.450> to<00:03:59.599> produce<00:03:59.780> more<00:04:00.530> and

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590 
means their body has to produce more and

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:03.819 
means their body has to produce more and
more<00:04:00.739> insulin<00:04:01.459> to<00:04:02.150> clear<00:04:02.419> all<00:04:02.690> those<00:04:03.049> excess

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:03.829 
more insulin to clear all those excess

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:06.190 
more insulin to clear all those excess
sugars<00:04:04.340> that<00:04:04.819> they're<00:04:05.090> eating<00:04:05.510> from<00:04:06.019> their
