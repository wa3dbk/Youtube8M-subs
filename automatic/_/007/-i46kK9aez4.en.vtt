00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:14.910
 dear gardeners we welcome you 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:14.910
 you are the world and today we have 1 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:22.140
 citrus grafting daily 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:25.439
 cultures we have already shot one video about 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:28.260
 vaccination technique we told how 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:31.590
 you can plant a citrus tree which 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:34.350
 grown from seed and sergei malenkov 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.660
 a collector of tropical plants he us 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.550
 very detailed about it all 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.070
 tell me please find this 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.890
 video and see and now we will continue 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:47.220
 conversation in his already greenhouses where here 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:51.270
 many grafted plants are already sex contributing 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:53.970
 and who are in the growth stage and here 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:57.060
 how to further care for them to carry out 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:01:00.240
 behind this grafted plants now 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:04.229
 the next stage, Sergey, yes, this is it 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:06.270
 line that's been grafted the wild, as it were 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.979
 citrus plant was grafted on lime here 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.619
 here from the kidney here you can see the vaccine and yes 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.689
 such here binding almost already has lila 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.680
 in itself is because she 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:18.689
 natural latex at this very thing 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:22.049
 decomposes under the influence of the atmosphere 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:25.109
 here then when she sprouted 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:28.710
 the cultural part of the line gives it was well 

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:32.549
 This clothespin is made to grow in 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.380
 upright here I am now 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.060
 I will remove her 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:40.260
 be seen here above 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:42.840
 vaccinations germinates savage this is what I mean 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:45.150
 not a cultivated plant like his 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.700
 be sure to clean up because the 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:50.310
 there is this sprout in twos on knocking on 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.810
 two yes this is what because if you give 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.410
 he grow up he will instantly grow 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:59.030
 a big plant in tokyo cultural spittle 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:59.030
 will remain in such a position as 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.980
 that's why as soon as you see that 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:06.020
 germinates by two it is necessary 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:09.690
 to remove 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:11.250
 to grow the cultural part is still here 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.560
 please tell me in this 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.230
 cups how many should we keep here 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.600
 such a hello and stretch well as here 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.760
 are you some kind of cultural twig 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:23.730
 I don't know she happens to grow 5 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.390
 It produces 25 centimeters, depending on the 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.490
 growth forces 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:31.820
 current circumstances and so on 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:35.940
 there is fertilizer so on here somehow when 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:37.890
 you're in vain you cut it you can and 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.690
 it is possible to replant it in principle 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:43.590
 immediately transplant ie it is somewhat 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:46.260
 months to keep but immediately big 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.000
 pot experience is not when it does not cause 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.110
 branch 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.010
 cultivated plants because how would 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:54.959
 Well, she will take root . yes and you 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:58.070
 will manipulate the roots 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:03:02.090
 it is better to not make everything better 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:05.880
 Well, then we look at here 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:09.540
 adults have citrus trees for many 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:14.730
 After all, growing and it is adult citrus 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:16.890
 trees are larger than cedar and grown from 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.380
 a seed and here is a man waiting waiting 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:21.750
 few years but such a tree has grown 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:25.230
 it does not bear fruit here look 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:27.989
 Sergey shows here how can perry 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:30.239
 graft 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:32.790
 here is such a plant here here 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:35.519
 one vaccination hasn't been taken here yet 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:37.680
 piping here is a kidney inoculation like us in 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:41.519
 the first video showed here 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:43.530
 second vaccination here too see it 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:45.080
 central it was the main branch 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.210
 already cut off 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:48.460
 but cleans up as were chosen 

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:51.410
 more or less 

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:52.690
 turn symmetrical so that later when 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:57.350
 start growing 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:04:00.290
 cultural this shoots they were in the crown 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:02.870
 as without symmetric to legion in different 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:05.870
 the parties wanted here for example 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:08.210
 same habit here it has already sprouted 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:10.520
 the cultural part here is strapping always 

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:12.830
 the shot taken can be seen here vaccination 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:14.360
 the cut is all visible and here she began 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:17.030
 germinate and here it goes into this 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:20.959
 side rarely grow and pro turn 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:23.090
 a symmetrical plant here too 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:25.970
 this here is an escape here this one with light 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:29.150
 leaves up great that's grown already 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:34.100
 this is cultural this is then he but when you 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:36.410
 matures here this part is cut perfectly 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:41.660
 that is, here on this you have plants 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:47.080
 vaccinated once two three 4 5 it returned 4 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:49.700
 buds on up to 4000 poured to one grade 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:54.040
 hello im he sorts 

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:56.660
 genna in english sounds jigi oh well 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:58.910
 Here, in principle, you can even vaccinate 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:00.350
 several varieties in one in one crown and 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:02.780
 you will be for example on one branch 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:06.590
 oranges hang other lemons 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:09.980

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:34.780
 There is now with this technology vaccinations 

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:36.890
 yes lock up this technology for the year 

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:41.030
 grows up here the vaccine was made 

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:42.830
 you can see here are some remnants of a stock and 

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:46.250
 this year it grows easier 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:50.090
 and then grows a tree 

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:54.380
