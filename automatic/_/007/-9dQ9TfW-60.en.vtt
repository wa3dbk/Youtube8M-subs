00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:07.780
 [Music] 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.790
 and that's the whole world it's either a 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.750
 failure that 2010 and today we get 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.789
 found for a new video 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.139
 minecraft i'm going to present you a 

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:18.600
 new system in autumn that I 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.720
 created it's a musical mix j 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.300
 we can also call his mixer 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.860
 so it has 18 different voices that 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.160
 offers you music opportunities 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:31.470
 almost infinite each color presents 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:35.300
 one voice in total three rounds of six 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.300
 voice place us the piano part 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:38.430
 drums 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.739
 and finally in bass 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:48.320
 who if this control board where every 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:50.180
 joystick represents a voice one can by 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:53.059
 example turned on or off the blue channel 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:56.120
 who is here it works the same for all 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:57.320
 the tracks and the kacm side we have a screen 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.690
 who give us children in time 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.170
 real this bar indicates the voice that 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:04.369
 are lit up so there is none 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:08.330
 then these four languages indicate the 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:11.180
 time 1 2 3 or 4 alas this counter 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.830
 indicates the number of the measure and finally 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.259
 these sicav and tells us the different 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.910
 start-up states possible then 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:18.290
 unfortunately the counters time it 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:20.690
 measurement are not activated in time 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.280
 normal one walk but to rotate 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.530
 the video fellag and the storyteller so I 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.830
 had to disable me saw leaping to the newspaper 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.520
 like this joystick 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.520
 now I'm going to make you a little 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.630
 example 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.520
 first of all we started we need 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.970
 click on this joystick to turn on 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.740
 the main timer this is the tempo is 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:40.759
 on but nothing happens because 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.310
 no sail is his 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:44.810
 we see for example activate the voice 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.450
 violet which corresponds to a big 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:50.660
 battery case and the bass drum 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:57.390
 is it yes we can admit the cash 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:59.270
 clear and hihat 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.009
 [Music] 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.980
 now we're going to put the piano of the 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:08.439
 low and more 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:08.439
 [Music] 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:23.040
 [Music] 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.040
 and you cut the music 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.909
 [Music] 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.769
 here you see pretty much how that 

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:30.730
 market 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:32.650
 another example now on a music 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.959
 that everyone knows radioactive 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:38.049
 images in dragons so we'll put 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:40.319
 early low a piano that the 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:40.319
 agreements 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:45.990
 a bass drum there is also this 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.330
 joystick that makes it possible to launch a departure 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:49.670
 sync the confession is active and so you 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:52.670
 go hear the baton departure 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.670
 here 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:11.170
 [Music] 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:12.060
 now I replace the coupe by the 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:34.040
 beginning of the chorus 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:42.689
 [Music] 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:43.010
 and a new coupe and now so 

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:48.000
 after 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:48.000
 [Music] 

00:03:48.889 --> 00:03:52.049
 now I want to cut all 

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:54.230
 pathways and I will explain the 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:54.230
 operation 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:03.500
 then the electronic part of the system 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:05.420
 is rather compact since I used 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.490
 the blocks or life 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:10.340
 this is the first time I use the 

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:12.620
 wireless redstone mode it's just based 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:14.989
 on a receiver is a transmitter which 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.220
 avoid harris sons everywhere but 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:18.019
 really it makes the system a lot 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:20.329
 more compact performant and the game there that 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:21.919
 me too so if you too do 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:23.540
 the axon as I advise you 

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:27.190
 to download it can be very 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:31.840
 so not useful here we have a screen party 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:31.840
 but the most important is there 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:38.780
 this is the main timer very little 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:40.520
 so if all four measures a 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:42.470
 electrical impulse is sent to 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:45.740
 the wifi transmitter of fuck 0 years old who is 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:48.190
 here the times are cut off so I 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.190
 I will love him 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:57.379
 so we can see the current and 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.379
 which rotates 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:01.229
 every turn 

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:08.690
 at the beginning of each time we find a 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:10.130
 receiver frequency found 0 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:10.600
 well pulse were all four 

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:13.390
 measures 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:16.100
 so it's the same for all the ways 

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:18.500
 for example the yellow voice then go 

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:19.820
 cut because there is no connection between the 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:22.690
 voice and transmitter 

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:22.690
 because the piston is closed 

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:30.980
 if you activate their yellow the piston 

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:30.980
 opens 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:37.210
 and the current goes on when 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:37.210
 and then transmitted to the music block 

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:46.280
 you can pre-pay each 

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:47.990
 once a by one 

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:49.820
 thanks to these levers so when the 

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:53.900
 joystick and bcc that the musica block is 

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:54.590
 disabled so there will not be played if 

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:56.090
 you want me to do some 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:57.530
 musical interpretations that you 

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:59.780
 like well do not hesitate to bring the 

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:01.340
 headlines in the comments I could 

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:03.560
 interpret it and thanks to this machine 

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:05.030
 is posted then the video 

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:06.530
 thank you for stealing this video you 

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:08.030
 can you subscribe to my dog 68 

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:10.250
 kabylie to see more videos 

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:12.260
 do not hesitate to put a love 

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:14.240

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:16.330
 continue I say goodbye and to you
