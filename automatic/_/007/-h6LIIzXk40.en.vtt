00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.800
 Ah 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:11.309
 The most incredible aspect is the awakening 

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:15.299
 I have a lot of whole body exercises . 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:19.950
 Bridge and shoulder liquor whole heart 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:22.710
 The crew 15 k off set to the line 

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:28.289
 In front of this bridge 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:29.759
 Cargo milk tube 8, the shoulder line up of national strength is second to catch yo 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.030
 You 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:37.720
 I buy a room and have a tea bar. 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:40.650
 what I see as shoulder width h81 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.650
 a sleep 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:48.300
 Once in 6, 2 times in a row and 5 times in a row. 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:52.470
 At the 8th price after this raise 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:54.870
 The leg team is trang up to that power. 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:58.170
 What did you do this time? 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:01.530
 Would you like to open your knees to run as shoulder width 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:04.500
 Get your arm. Make it right. Hold it. 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:08.700
 But I'm on your leg. 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:12.149
 4 Ass starts to slip 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:15.000
 I got a 10 and I got a kid . 

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:20.039
 After this exercise, 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:22.740
 Can I need you release the power bars so what's with the attitude 

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:25.440
 The monster pharmacist 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:29.910
 Manpower too 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:32.790
 Steve Consort first-party indirect 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:38.640
 He raised his body up . 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:44.580
 If you do that you will get hurt or stock excitement , your muscles are relaxed and very pretty. 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:48.150
 If you want to stretch your records and make them look better on moss or on me. 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:52.070
 I need to extend it to 10G 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:52.070
 Come on, the speakers are deep 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:59.380
 It looks like this is when the problem grows. 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:02.649
 And I'm here to stay with Kim. 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:07.060
 Get me a very short zip line first 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:11.980
 Even if you do not stay here like this , 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:14.319
 If you require a short sword late hours, how often do away once Actress 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:19.500
 When it's negative, it's really cool. 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:19.500
 I wonder if it's possible to go to a wide range of art.
