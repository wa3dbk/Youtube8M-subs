00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:16.299
 hello everyone today I bring you a trick to 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:17.830
 speak to you 2 the zombies the pnÃ¼ma for 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:19.570
 move of diet and good I was in this 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:22.060
 starting with pocho is a very trick 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:24.460
 simple very very very easy to do and 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.830
 It is also very useful also about 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.090
 that's good when you commit suicide here in 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:30.189
 the panel does not become 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:31.840
 spirit in this case in the pose as 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:33.220
 you see, the only thing I do is revive him 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.079
 but I do not get to revive him 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:36.670
 when the bar will reach the end by 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:38.470
 loose and come back to resuscitate again 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:41.770
 you do not have to support the bar so much 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:44.020
 with the put in half is worth no and 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.579
 Well this is what happens after what 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.559
 happens is that poch is good here you go back to 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:49.870
 see when the post touches the panel does not and it 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:52.449
 suicidal and it becomes spirit not 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.430
 As you can see, it will take much longer but 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:57.190
 much more to spend is worth the time 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:59.109
 that we have spirit not of this 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.440
 when we are so dead not in the 

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:03.390
 purgatory as they say 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.119
 well, we will have much more time not 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.740
 it means that it's the finite but let's go 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.409
 to endure a lot more as you see 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.700
 I still did not start to spend 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.350
 although now you will see that it will start 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.630
 spend a little time but 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:19.200
 because when you are reviving and 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.790
 loose it and do not bring the same rhythm 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.190
 all the time are not every time 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.110
 reanima is not not constant then 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:26.729
 that's why sometimes it's a tad low but very 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.799
 little is given much more time to 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.170
 do all of yours open all and 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.090
 then from a run you do this or not 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.890
 be you become spirit this the 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.399
 double chance is there and you do it all 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.080
 a pull is worth a trick as I say 

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:41.490
 very useful this we started doing the 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.899
 first days but good look between a 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.640
 thing and another as there were other videos 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.710
 well I started good this leaves it for a 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.560
 little bit later but hey it's very 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.340
 simple is worth as you have seen and 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.750
 practically has not spent nor 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.659
 half the time and although it stays 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.800
 it's worth it so nothing was just that and 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.330
 I hope you liked it if it has 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.890
 liked to vote i like favorites and we 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.159
 we see in the next video greetings to 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.159
 everyone 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.200
 Y
