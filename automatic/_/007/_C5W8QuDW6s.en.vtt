00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:07.020
 Talk to me, beauty. I 'm here again. 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:09.480
 to make a new one box if this is 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.860
 of my new processor is an intel core 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:16.049
 i5 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:26.070
 it's a model the 41 focus this thing 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:27.359
 here is the 5 44 40 it's 3.1 ghz of 6mb 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.000
 of cache 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.859
 without speaking that it is the intelligence cast 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.710
 smart of the intel nÃ© 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:39.239
 is a fourth generation processor it is 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:46.890
 from lg to 1150 is a good processor 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:59.430
 it is the turn of 3.3 giga hertz in the case 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:01:03.080
 then we will open here I found it difficult to 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:06.210
 Guys, I bought this CPU. 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:08.479
 but it was something that I did not go 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:12.390
 say so I will not overclock 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:16.530
 so a great processor for those who do not 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:19.080
 will overclock and yes for you 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:22.320
 I just want to play and you can put on pants. 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.720
 A great teacher here is a manual. 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:29.130
 instructions on how you like places 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:32.729
 processor is the right way neither in nor 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:37.290
 to no board workout the core adhesive 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:43.880
 i5 here comes a mac ad 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:47.990
 Product fun also threatened here 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.990
 half-kneaded in the box 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:02:00.020
 We got some boxing from him. I 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:02.720
 I recommend not to wear the vest box and yes 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:05.720
 try investing a better wildcard 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.280
 Because this fellow boxed well he 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:11.000
 put up with the processor 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:14.420
 so much is in the warranty and you have 13 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.709
 years with this cure then and with this 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.400
 tv folder 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:21.770
 so you have three years warranty and 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.450
 also if you are staying with the trailers 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:26.110
 I recommend replacing the thermal paste 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:32.570
 put a thermal paste a little 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:39.459
 better because it will help a lot in the 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:39.459
 heat dissipation here has to open 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:51.760
 well protected 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:55.549
 then this is the processor or 4440 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:57.350
 how can you see how it is from intel 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:03:01.910
 it does not come with the pins 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:07.459
 in it will already use mdc they come with pins 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:14.269
 before I had in mdf 8350 now I am 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:16.820
 entering here with 15 to see what goes 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:22.430
 to give in fact I have not had one yet 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:25.070
 desktop with 15 so let's test then 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:28.310
 This is it, I hope you liked it. 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:32.750
 Clicking people jewelry there to motivate me 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:35.060
 make more videos and if you could 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:38.620
 also sign up thank you very much for 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:38.620
