broken<00:02:03.320> antenna<00:02:03.909> but<00:02:04.909> if<00:02:05.090> those<00:02:05.240> things<00:02:05.510> are

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
broken antenna but if those things are

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.199 
broken antenna but if those things are
good<00:02:05.810> all<00:02:06.260> you<00:02:06.409> want<00:02:06.560> to<00:02:06.619> do<00:02:06.740> is<00:02:06.979> change<00:02:07.970> out

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209 
good all you want to do is change out

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:10.929 
good all you want to do is change out
this<00:02:08.420> beast<00:02:08.810> okay<00:02:09.530> so<00:02:10.250> we've<00:02:10.489> got<00:02:10.519> the<00:02:10.729> old<00:02:10.849> one

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:10.939 
this beast okay so we've got the old one

00:02:10.939 --> 00:02:15.339 
this beast okay so we've got the old one
out<00:02:12.340> let's<00:02:13.340> see<00:02:13.550> about<00:02:13.670> getting<00:02:14.030> the<00:02:14.780> new<00:02:14.959> one

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:15.349 
out let's see about getting the new one

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:17.410 
out let's see about getting the new one
let<00:02:15.530> me<00:02:15.620> walk<00:02:15.860> in<00:02:16.040> here<00:02:16.280> with<00:02:16.400> it

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
let me walk in here with it

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.550 
let me walk in here with it
all<00:02:18.230> right<00:02:18.410> so<00:02:18.680> got<00:02:19.430> the<00:02:19.550> old<00:02:19.700> one<00:02:20.349> the<00:02:21.349> new

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
all right so got the old one the new

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.839 
all right so got the old one the new
ones<00:02:21.770> that<00:02:21.890> we<00:02:21.980> have<00:02:22.450> are<00:02:23.450> actually<00:02:23.810> a<00:02:24.849> little

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:25.849 
ones that we have are actually a little

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:27.910 
ones that we have are actually a little
bit<00:02:26.030> different<00:02:26.270> okay<00:02:27.050> they<00:02:27.170> don't<00:02:27.319> make<00:02:27.530> these

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
bit different okay they don't make these

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.010 
bit different okay they don't make these
original<00:02:28.459> ones<00:02:28.580> anymore<00:02:29.000> but<00:02:29.690> you<00:02:29.780> can<00:02:29.870> see

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
original ones anymore but you can see

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:31.510 
original ones anymore but you can see
this<00:02:30.140> new<00:02:30.349> one<00:02:30.530> the<00:02:30.620> body<00:02:30.800> is<00:02:31.040> basically<00:02:31.370> the

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520 
this new one the body is basically the

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.449 
this new one the body is basically the
same<00:02:31.760> similar<00:02:32.360> style<00:02:33.100> it<00:02:34.100> has<00:02:34.190> a<00:02:34.250> little

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459 
same similar style it has a little

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:36.070 
same similar style it has a little
cutout<00:02:34.640> on<00:02:34.790> the<00:02:34.910> side<00:02:35.150> that's<00:02:35.450> about<00:02:35.660> the<00:02:35.870> big

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
cutout on the side that's about the big

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.680 
cutout on the side that's about the big
difference<00:02:36.530> and<00:02:36.910> what<00:02:37.910> you<00:02:38.000> need<00:02:38.120> to<00:02:38.209> do<00:02:38.390> is

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
difference and what you need to do is

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.020 
difference and what you need to do is
just<00:02:39.110> cut<00:02:39.410> these<00:02:39.860> wires<00:02:40.100> off<00:02:40.370> the<00:02:40.489> old<00:02:40.640> one<00:02:40.819> the

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
just cut these wires off the old one the

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.270 
just cut these wires off the old one the
old<00:02:41.690> plug<00:02:41.989> the<00:02:42.500> new<00:02:42.680> ones<00:02:42.860> come<00:02:43.069> with<00:02:43.250> a

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
old plug the new ones come with a

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.390 
old plug the new ones come with a
different<00:02:43.640> style<00:02:43.790> plug<00:02:45.040> so<00:02:46.040> you<00:02:46.069> cut<00:02:46.280> the

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
different style plug so you cut the

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.589 
different style plug so you cut the
wiring<00:02:46.730> off<00:02:46.849> the<00:02:46.970> old<00:02:47.090> one<00:02:47.269> you<00:02:47.360> cut<00:02:47.510> the

00:02:47.589 --> 00:02:47.599 
wiring off the old one you cut the

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:49.449 
wiring off the old one you cut the
wiring<00:02:47.930> off<00:02:48.080> the<00:02:48.560> new<00:02:48.739> one<00:02:48.950> maybe<00:02:49.160> leave<00:02:49.430> a

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:49.459 
wiring off the new one maybe leave a

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:50.880 
wiring off the new one maybe leave a
couple<00:02:49.790> inches

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
couple inches

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.330 
couple inches
okay<00:02:51.890> splice<00:02:52.340> the<00:02:52.580> plug<00:02:52.790> back<00:02:53.030> on<00:02:53.239> there<00:02:54.340> from

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
okay splice the plug back on there from

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.140 
okay splice the plug back on there from
the<00:02:55.430> old<00:02:55.549> one<00:02:55.790> and<00:02:57.040> you'll<00:02:58.040> be<00:02:58.160> good<00:02:58.310> to<00:02:58.370> go<00:02:58.489> all

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
the old one and you'll be good to go all

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:00.220 
the old one and you'll be good to go all
right<00:02:59.209> so<00:02:59.540> I'm<00:02:59.630> going<00:02:59.750> to<00:02:59.780> go<00:02:59.900> ahead<00:02:59.959> and<00:03:00.140> do

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
right so I'm going to go ahead and do

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.380 
right so I'm going to go ahead and do
that<00:03:00.370> we'll<00:03:01.370> put<00:03:01.549> it<00:03:01.640> back<00:03:01.670> together<00:03:01.940> and<00:03:02.209> I'll

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
that we'll put it back together and I'll

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:04.030 
that we'll put it back together and I'll
show<00:03:02.630> you<00:03:02.660> what<00:03:03.260> it's<00:03:03.380> like<00:03:03.500> when<00:03:03.709> we're<00:03:03.890> back

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
show you what it's like when we're back

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.660 
show you what it's like when we're back
as<00:03:05.000> you<00:03:05.120> can<00:03:05.269> see<00:03:05.530> got<00:03:06.530> this<00:03:06.739> new<00:03:07.040> resistor

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
as you can see got this new resistor

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:10.410 
as you can see got this new resistor
I'll<00:03:07.819> spliced<00:03:08.180> in<00:03:08.590> when<00:03:09.590> you<00:03:09.680> go<00:03:09.739> to<00:03:09.799> splice<00:03:10.100> it

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
I'll spliced in when you go to splice it

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.670 
I'll spliced in when you go to splice it
really<00:03:11.420> the<00:03:11.510> only<00:03:11.630> one<00:03:11.810> that<00:03:11.989> matters<00:03:12.140> why<00:03:12.620> are

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
really the only one that matters why are

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.550 
really the only one that matters why are
wise<00:03:12.980> is<00:03:13.370> this<00:03:14.090> most<00:03:14.299> farther<00:03:14.780> away<00:03:14.870> one<00:03:15.290> from

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
wise is this most farther away one from

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.190 
wise is this most farther away one from
the<00:03:15.680> plug<00:03:16.150> there's<00:03:17.150> one<00:03:17.390> on<00:03:17.600> one<00:03:17.780> end<00:03:17.959> all<00:03:18.080> by

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
the plug there's one on one end all by

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:18.640 
the plug there's one on one end all by
itself

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
itself

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.449 
itself
you<00:03:19.549> want<00:03:19.700> to<00:03:19.760> splice<00:03:19.970> that<00:03:20.000> to<00:03:20.330> the<00:03:20.420> same<00:03:20.660> wire

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
you want to splice that to the same wire

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:24.759 
you want to splice that to the same wire
that's<00:03:22.459> got<00:03:23.239> one<00:03:23.269> on<00:03:23.630> that<00:03:23.780> look<00:03:23.959> far<00:03:24.200> end<00:03:24.470> on

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:24.769 
that's got one on that look far end on

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:28.420 
that's got one on that look far end on
the<00:03:25.130> old<00:03:25.280> plug<00:03:26.230> you<00:03:27.230> leave<00:03:27.440> maybe<00:03:28.130> like<00:03:28.310> an

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 
the old plug you leave maybe like an

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:30.550 
the old plug you leave maybe like an
inch<00:03:28.810> these<00:03:29.810> wires

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
inch these wires

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:31.930 
inch these wires
so<00:03:30.680> you<00:03:30.769> can<00:03:30.980> have<00:03:31.130> something<00:03:31.370> this<00:03:31.430> place<00:03:31.670> too

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
so you can have something this place too

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.110 
so you can have something this place too
and<00:03:32.620> I<00:03:33.620> usually<00:03:33.890> use<00:03:34.010> these<00:03:34.100> crimps<00:03:34.459> places<00:03:34.880> I

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
and I usually use these crimps places I

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.310 
and I usually use these crimps places I
mean<00:03:35.150> I<00:03:35.299> know<00:03:35.450> people<00:03:35.660> don't<00:03:35.870> like<00:03:35.989> them<00:03:36.170> but

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:36.320 
mean I know people don't like them but

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.410 
mean I know people don't like them but
give<00:03:36.590> them<00:03:36.650> the<00:03:36.709> pull<00:03:36.920> test<00:03:37.190> if<00:03:37.459> they<00:03:37.820> pull<00:03:38.060> and

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:38.420 
give them the pull test if they pull and

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.860 
give them the pull test if they pull and
don't<00:03:39.260> pull<00:03:39.620> out<00:03:39.650> they're<00:03:40.070> good<00:03:40.720> that's<00:03:41.720> what

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
don't pull out they're good that's what

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:43.300 
don't pull out they're good that's what
they<00:03:41.959> use<00:03:42.140> in<00:03:42.230> the<00:03:42.290> aviation<00:03:42.590> industry<00:03:42.890> they

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 
they use in the aviation industry they

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:45.130 
they use in the aviation industry they
do<00:03:43.370> not<00:03:43.579> like<00:03:43.790> soldering<00:03:44.630> in<00:03:44.810> the<00:03:44.870> aviation

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.140 
do not like soldering in the aviation

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:47.470 
do not like soldering in the aviation
industry<00:03:45.350> because<00:03:45.920> it<00:03:46.250> will<00:03:46.370> crack<00:03:46.609> over<00:03:47.120> time

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 
industry because it will crack over time

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.300 
industry because it will crack over time
with<00:03:47.720> vibration<00:03:48.230> so<00:03:48.709> just<00:03:48.980> letting<00:03:49.160> you<00:03:49.280> know

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
with vibration so just letting you know

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:52.300 
with vibration so just letting you know
so<00:03:50.209> I<00:03:50.269> got<00:03:50.390> this<00:03:50.480> beast<00:03:50.720> in<00:03:50.930> here<00:03:51.230> plugged<00:03:52.220> it

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
so I got this beast in here plugged it

so that's it now you got your low speed

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:34.390 
so that's it now you got your low speed
going<00:04:33.200> you<00:04:33.500> need<00:04:33.680> that<00:04:33.890> when<00:04:34.010> you're<00:04:34.159> going<00:04:34.310> to

you<00:04:41.630> know<00:04:41.750> right<00:04:42.020> it<00:04:42.229> doesn't<00:04:42.470> get<00:04:42.590> too<00:04:42.860> hot

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:42.890 
you know right it doesn't get too hot
