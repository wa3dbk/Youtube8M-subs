00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:03.719
 hello expressed I hope everyone is very 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.880
 well today I bring you an idea 

00:00:03.719 --> 00:00:07.770
 gift for valentine very easy 

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:09.960
 we only have left is that we only need 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.550
 five ingredients are left something like this they know 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.139
 delicious and you delay very little 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.510
 time doing them if you want to see how 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.190
 he says follow with the tutorial you're going to 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:19.020
 need two brawn is one of those 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.119
 you bought in the super half cup 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.100
 sugar glass or powdered medium bar 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.779
 of white chocolate butter for 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.360
 cover the cake pops and some three 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.100
 peaks of valentine theme 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.900
 ah 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.970
 now for the two brawn is inside a 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.920
 bowl and with your very clean hands you are going to 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:37.699
 start to crumble those or do the 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.170
 bits to start with the dough 

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:42.059
 it is very important that the serious ones do not 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.739
 have any type of filling and once 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.649
 you've finished you'll be like that 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.180
 sand cut the butter into pieces and 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.739
 now over the top of the mines of 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.019
 brownie and this is going to be much easier 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.180
 the whole process at the beginning I tried 

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:56.190
 show this with a wooden spoon or 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.750
 with this little thing but it made me very 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.579
 difficult then he started doing it with 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.170
 hands remember to keep the 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.170
 super super clean hands 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.650
 once this mixed medium you are going to put 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.530
 just half the amount of sugar 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.060
 glas and you're going to keep mixing 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.440
 patience because at first it seems that 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.690
 they do not join anything and that these were 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.160
 gruda but already with time the matter 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.810
 it begins to melt a little bit in your 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.810
 hands and everything becomes a mass 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.610
 homogeneous 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.530
 if you feel that already all the ingredients 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.060
 they were incorporated very very well now 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.890
 you can finish kneading this with the 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.960
 shovel and now you can make a small 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.539
 little ball and the dough will have something like that 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.829
 cover the dough with cling film to avoid 

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:35.479
 that is crusted and now 

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:37.369
 take it to the refrigerator for half an hour 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:38.960
 when you know it, it will be much more 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:40.700
 compact because butter has been 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.530
 hardened and now we're going to start 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.090
 make the cake pops I like 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.009
 put them on a plate with paper 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.509
 film and with a little bit of dough I start to 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:50.020
 make a small ball within two 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:52.560
 palms of my hands 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.560
 do not 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.030
 now take a skewer stick and 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:02.660
 click right in the center and you can 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:04.610
 lie on top of your plate you can 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:05.930
 Repeat this process many more times 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.630
 this amount of mass did not reach 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:11.240
 approximately for 89 cake pops of 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:13.040
 size of a ping pong ball and 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.570
 take them in the fridge for another 15 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.310
 minutes 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:18.020
 melts white chocolate and now covers 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.700
 all your cake pops this step is going to be 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.610
 much easier so they already have a 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.020
 stick from which you can attach it to 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.640
 remove the excess and you have a lot 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.320
 more even you're going to start shaking it and 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.400
 you go around 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:31.170
 quickly with the melted chocolate 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.990
 you're going to start putting your spring with 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.760
 dragees on top of your cake pop and so 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:37.470
 they will adhere very easily we are going to 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.600
 Do the same with the rest of the cake pops 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.520
 What I like about this recipe is that it does not 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.340
 you need bitumen because many times it is 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.900
 very difficult to find I suggest you 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.970
 through the whole brownie ball 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:51.480
 with the stick so it is very safe 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:53.580
 and do not go to shofar during this step 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.290
 on this side put about three peaks that 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.060
 they are very small hearts of 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.980
 different colors and I thought super 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.769
 I got it flirtatiously in a store 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.720
 pastry it occurred to me that I also 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:05.730
 I could give without a stick and put them in 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.650
 a box so that they look like truffles or 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:10.799
 you can fix a small basket with 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.599
 some cake pops and it looks lovely it 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:14.370
 they look super striking and they are a detail 

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:16.410
 very special for your valentine you 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.239
 family your friends or anyone 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.310
 who wants his licenses 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:22.019
 we want to finish as you can see they are very 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.519
 Easy to make all materials 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:25.470
 the super conciliations and is a 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:27.390
 excellent last minute gift I've already 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.069
 eaten a few do not imagine what 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:30.450
 delicious they were but good what 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:31.980
 I leave for you to do it and I 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.720

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.549
