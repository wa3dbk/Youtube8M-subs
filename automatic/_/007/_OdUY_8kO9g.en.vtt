00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
pixels in his in her cameras CCD that

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.550 
pixels in his in her cameras CCD that
are<00:01:29.220> overexposed<00:01:30.060> and<00:01:30.360> they're<00:01:30.930> because

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
are overexposed and they're because

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.190 
are overexposed and they're because
they're<00:01:31.590> too<00:01:31.890> orderly<00:01:32.460> to<00:01:33.060> be<00:01:33.180> sunspots<00:01:33.810> and

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
they're too orderly to be sunspots and

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
they're too orderly to be sunspots and
nothing<00:01:34.920> to<00:01:35.040> get<00:01:35.159> excited<00:01:35.430> about<00:01:35.880> but<00:01:37.220> Miss

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220

it<00:01:40.470> doesn't<00:01:40.500> make<00:01:40.860> sense<00:01:40.920> to<00:01:41.430> her<00:01:41.700> because<00:01:42.240> the

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
it doesn't make sense to her because the

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.120 
it doesn't make sense to her because the
object<00:01:42.840> was<00:01:43.020> behind<00:01:43.290> clouds<00:01:43.710> in<00:01:43.950> some

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
object was behind clouds in some

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.700 
object was behind clouds in some
pictures<00:01:44.579> behind<00:01:45.030> tree<00:01:45.540> branches<00:01:46.079> and<00:01:46.110> others

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
pictures behind tree branches and others

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.060 
pictures behind tree branches and others
and<00:01:46.950> out<00:01:47.340> in<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:47.610> open<00:01:48.149> and<00:01:48.329> others<00:01:48.899> and<00:01:49.110> what

and out in the open and others and what
caught<00:01:50.310> her<00:01:50.460> eye<00:01:50.729> was<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.750> fact<00:01:52.020> that<00:01:52.380> these

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
caught her eye was the fact that these

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.660 
caught her eye was the fact that these
little<00:01:53.399> lights<00:01:53.790> are<00:01:54.350> inside<00:01:55.350> of<00:01:55.590> it<00:01:56.189> and<00:01:56.399> she

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
little lights are inside of it and she

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.569 
little lights are inside of it and she
has<00:01:56.850> one<00:01:57.119> that's<00:01:57.360> even<00:01:58.250> zoomed<00:01:59.250> in<00:01:59.460> a<00:01:59.490> little

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
has one that's even zoomed in a little

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.190 
has one that's even zoomed in a little
bit<00:01:59.939> more<00:02:00.270> we're<00:02:00.450> gonna<00:02:00.570> take<00:02:00.780> a<00:02:00.810> look<00:02:00.960> at<00:02:01.079> that

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
bit more we're gonna take a look at that

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.859 
bit more we're gonna take a look at that
next<00:02:01.530> and<00:02:02.060> there<00:02:03.060> it<00:02:03.180> is<00:02:03.299> but<00:02:03.990> this<00:02:04.140> one<00:02:04.380> is<00:02:04.530> but

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869 
next and there it is but this one is but

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:09.440 
next and there it is but this one is but
seen<00:02:06.869> through<00:02:07.829> the<00:02:08.039> branches<00:02:09.030> that<00:02:09.149> she<00:02:09.330> was

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
seen through the branches that she was

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.930 
seen through the branches that she was
talking<00:02:09.840> about<00:02:09.869> earlier<00:02:10.259> so<00:02:10.770> she<00:02:11.280> took<00:02:11.760> them

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
talking about earlier so she took them

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:12.640 
talking about earlier so she took them
from<00:02:12.270> mulch

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
from mulch

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.809
