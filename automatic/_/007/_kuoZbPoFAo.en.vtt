00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:26.880 
lyrics and I think in this respect we
will<00:02:23.500> make<00:02:24.040> a<00:02:24.069> major<00:02:24.550> step<00:02:25.150> forward<00:02:25.650> the<00:02:26.650> data

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
will make a major step forward the data

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:29.460 
will make a major step forward the data
collected<00:02:27.430> by<00:02:27.489> Gocha<00:02:28.120> also<00:02:28.480> teaches<00:02:28.900> us<00:02:28.930> a<00:02:29.170> lot

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470

about<00:02:29.620> what's<00:02:30.040> actually<00:02:30.250> inside<00:02:30.819> the<00:02:31.209> earth

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
about what's actually inside the earth

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:34.350 
about what's actually inside the earth
so<00:02:32.709> we'll<00:02:32.980> get<00:02:33.190> a<00:02:33.340> clearer<00:02:33.700> view<00:02:33.940> of<00:02:34.150> how<00:02:34.300> the

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
so we'll get a clearer view of how the

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.630 
so we'll get a clearer view of how the

00:03:58.319 --> 00:03:58.329 
the great news is that there is even

the great news is that there is even

scientists are very hungry to receive
even<00:04:05.079> more<00:04:05.169> data<00:04:05.500> because<00:04:05.980> the<00:04:06.099> gate<00:04:06.250> becomes

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:06.760 
even more data because the gate becomes

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.370 
even more data because the gate becomes
also<00:04:06.970> better<00:04:07.269> and<00:04:07.480> better<00:04:07.630> the<00:04:07.840> longer<00:04:08.079> we

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:08.380 
also better and better the longer we

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:10.530 
also better and better the longer we
measure<00:04:08.560> so<00:04:09.280> we<00:04:09.819> are<00:04:09.880> fewer<00:04:10.090> for<00:04:10.359> maybe

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:10.540 
measure so we are fewer for maybe

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:13.170 
measure so we are fewer for maybe
another<00:04:10.690> two<00:04:11.079> years<00:04:11.349> we<00:04:12.130> plan<00:04:12.340> to<00:04:12.639> use<00:04:12.819> all

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:17.320 
but we are now cleared that we have

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.219 
but we are now cleared that we have
