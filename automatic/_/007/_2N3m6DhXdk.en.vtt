00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520
 hello everyone I'm Elijah 362 I bring 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.639
 this new video and this time in play the 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.469
 call of duty black ops 2 one more time and 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.630
 first of all I have to ask 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.670
 apologies for two little things the first the 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.230
 you're going to notice in the gameplay and that's 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.270
 Well, a few French 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.800
 talking about background I forgot to silence 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.350
 them and because well basically good 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.970
 many times game without sound is worth 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.619
 absolutely nothing sound game 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.720
 listening to music or whatever or 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.849
 talking on Skype if I'm with angel and 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.560
 with josemi and well then we have video 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.450
 silence them because I basically think 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.210
 remember that in this game, no 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.440
 I was playing with sound then 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.450
 you're basically going to listen to a few 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.340
 French talk about background like the 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.899
 most of you will not understand anything because it does not happen 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.040
 nothing but it might be a bit annoying 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.170
 I will try to lower the sound though 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.879
 the sound of 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.129
 the weapons but good I'll try that 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:53.129
 do not spend more and the second of which the 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:55.289
 I wanted to apologize is that good 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.640
 thinking about this silencing because I've 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.170
 thought that many times I will have 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.090
 unintentionally muted some 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.500
 subscribers that I will have met in 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.449
 the games have not found me with 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.970
 you and you will have silenced you wanted 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.720
 saying I just wanted to tell you that this is not what 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.490
 I make bets that 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.650
 tell us silence for no reason in 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.440
 concrete basically silence because 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.420
 I have used to silence all 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.220
 if it is a job and commented and many 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.450
 times if I'm playing live or even 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.150
 in the series so that the view that 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.490
 it basically consists of not talking 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.530
 with you, you are going to see forgiveness 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.330
 we are silent then if they are gameplays 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.460
 commented floor silence so I os 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.050
 I apologize if I do not pay attention to you 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:35.070
 in quotes when I'm playing 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:37.140
 online but if many times if I 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.570
 you speak before with silence you are going to see 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.150
 that some message was even sent or I 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.640
 I put the micro if I can or even 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.170
 I put myself would talk with you and tell you 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.119
 invite me and we play together whatever 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:52.290
 so I wanted to apologize for 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:54.780
 those two little things and I also wanted to 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:57.030
 this video wanted to bring you a little 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.580
 news so to speak I do not already have 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.610
 prepared some videos the way 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.380
 Vale campaign are ready now and only 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.900
 I have to upload them they are ready from 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.300
 the first day of the game is valid from 12 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.550
 that I have it from Monday 12th 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.020
 community repeated several times and 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.970
 I have prepared 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.350
 I could not say or maybe six 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.760
 episodes of the new campaign that already 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.160
 you know it's not a very campaign mode 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.620
 long and for that reason I wanted to upload it to 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.540
 be a short campaign in quotation marks 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.960
 compared to assassin's creed 3 or 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.490
 uncharted or x-men whatever is pretty 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.140
 short since it's a shooter we already know 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:33.510
 how are the campaign modes also of 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:36.330
 call of duty and well I also have 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.650
 to tell you that it's a campaign mode that 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.920
 to be call of duty as it is quite 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.450
 pretty good in my opinion I think that 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.820
 it's a good campaign mode to be a call 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.590
 of duty and as I say nothing comparable with 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:48.660
 a sauce inscribed with an uncharted 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.120
 I can play whatever you can not 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.560
 compare at all but good to be 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.540
 Call of Duty truth is that to me 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.700
 it's quite liking I'm not finished 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.370
 to record it but I already tell you that I have 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.290
 five or six episodes just in case 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.790
 spend a little bit and then good 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.650
 Well, I have them ready, I would just have 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.050
 I want to upload them I hope to upload them 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.780
 I think if something happens to me upload them 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:10.970
 still power then 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.740
 basically, I wanted to ask you 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:14.300
 although the des that I want to 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:16.640
 upload it but good regardless of 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:18.319
 I feel like it or I did not want to ask you 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:21.500
 if you want this story mode to go up 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:23.900
 the truth is that good as I say 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:26.330
 I want to go up, you are going to see 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.340
 also a little thing before I continue 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:31.370
 you are going to see what happened to me all the 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:33.470
 zone I mean all the whole 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:35.000
 heading in this area then you will see 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:36.500
 that when I stay with the crossbow and the 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.180
 ballistic knife starts to move me already 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.680
 on the right side and play 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.050
 absolutely all the gameplay I put on 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.519
 nervous and was finally 3ยบ bis veis 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:45.560
 that right now and an advantage of what 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:47.810
 they would be three weapons but not later 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.700
 comes the day son of all begin to 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:51.800
 stab me down from the range of everything 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.660
 so well I just wanted to tell you 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:55.100
 that before continuing to talk about the 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:57.260
 campaign mode or in story mode like 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:59.000
 you prefer and is that good 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.739
 regardless of what follows 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.900
 saying that I like it or did not want 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:05.030
 ask you and now now is when the 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.650
 I wanted to ask you if you want to see 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:08.269
 the story mode you want to see the mode 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:09.950
 history of this critical heat and I think 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:11.989
 which is quite important because 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:14.360
 good as a delivery comes out a 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:16.549
 delivery every year not an annual delivery 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:18.650
 almost all of us found this game 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:21.620
 it is important to also follow the 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:23.870
 argument that has that as I say it does not 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.640
 can you can not compare forgiveness in 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:28.070
 absolute with other arguments of other 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:29.900
 deliveries of video games but to be a 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:30.890
 call of duty is pretty good is 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:33.950
 a story that I'm liking 

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:37.880
 very much to be good because of the saga 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:39.710
 call of duty one more time so nothing 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:41.150
 I think I just wanted to comment on that 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:42.380
 I think he did not let me ask you anything else 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:44.270
 sorry for what I said to the 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:46.790
 principle also tell you how 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:49.190
 campaign and well to comment in the 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:51.110
 comments if you want me to upload it and 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:53.090
 I start to leave it ready so 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:55.100
 nothing the gameplay is going to come to an end 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:57.560
 I'm sorry if I worked a lot but it's 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:59.630
 pretty early and good I just 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:02.460
 wake up we are here on weekends 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:03.750
 I just woke up and what was said 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:05.789
 nothing I hope you liked it already 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:09.810
 you know like and favorites and without anything else 

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:12.169
 to say goodbye elias 360 until the 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:12.169
 next
