motor<00:00:15.960> which<00:00:16.230> is<00:00:16.260> a<00:00:16.710> little<00:00:17.250> bit<00:00:17.369> different

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
motor which is a little bit different

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.340 
motor which is a little bit different
than<00:00:17.970> the<00:00:18.060> production<00:00:18.330> Viper<00:00:18.750> engine<00:00:19.050> it's

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
than the production Viper engine it's

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.189

calibration for racing specifically and

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.349 
calibration for racing specifically and
it<00:00:27.599> makes<00:00:27.750> about<00:00:28.019> 640<00:00:28.890> horsepower<00:00:29.359> 605

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.280 

now<00:00:53.550> street-legal<00:00:54.390> we<00:00:54.480> don't<00:00:54.660> have<00:00:54.809> catalyst

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:55.290 
now street-legal we don't have catalyst

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:57.139 
now street-legal we don't have catalyst
we<00:00:55.500> don't<00:00:55.649> have<00:00:55.800> some<00:00:56.040> of<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.219> OBD<00:00:56.640> monitors

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
we don't have some of the OBD monitors

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.290 
we don't have some of the OBD monitors
are<00:00:58.079> as<00:00:58.379> it's<00:00:59.010> a<00:00:59.100> race<00:00:59.280> car<00:00:59.309> so<00:01:00.000> it's<00:01:00.090> a<00:01:00.149> lot<00:01:00.270> of

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
are as it's a race car so it's a lot of

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.750 
are as it's a race car so it's a lot of
fun<00:01:00.540> today<00:01:01.050> we're<00:01:01.320> we're<00:01:01.770> just<00:01:01.800> final

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
fun today we're we're just final

verification<00:01:03.390> of<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.540> calibration<00:01:04.170> we're

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
verification of the calibration we're

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.690 
verification of the calibration we're
checking<00:01:04.559> all<00:01:04.830> of<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:05.100> spark<00:01:05.400> and<00:01:05.519> fuel

monitors that are still operative for
making<00:01:11.580> sure<00:01:11.700> there<00:01:11.850> aren't<00:01:12.030> any<00:01:12.119> interaction

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:13.050 
making sure there aren't any interaction

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:14.810 
making sure there aren't any interaction
problems<00:01:13.560> or<00:01:13.710> anything<00:01:13.860> like<00:01:14.070> that<00:01:14.130> you<00:01:14.580> can't

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
problems or anything like that you can't

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.460 
problems or anything like that you can't
see<00:01:15.090> them<00:01:15.180> but<00:01:15.330> we've<00:01:15.509> got<00:01:15.720> in<00:01:15.990> cylinder

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
see them but we've got in cylinder

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.290 
see them but we've got in cylinder
pressure<00:01:16.860> transducers<00:01:17.640> or<00:01:17.670> piezoelectric

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:18.300 
pressure transducers or piezoelectric

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.290 
pressure transducers or piezoelectric
devices<00:01:19.110> so<00:01:19.590> we<00:01:20.070> can<00:01:20.220> actually<00:01:20.580> see<00:01:21.090> what's

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:21.300 
devices so we can actually see what's

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.149 
devices so we can actually see what's
going<00:01:21.360> on<00:01:21.659> with<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:21.960> combustion<00:01:22.320> we<00:01:22.830> can<00:01:22.979> see

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
going on with the combustion we can see

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.950 
going on with the combustion we can see
the<00:01:23.250> rate<00:01:23.430> of<00:01:23.550> rise<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:24.000> peak<00:01:24.210> pressures<00:01:24.690> and

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
the rate of rise the peak pressures and

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.050 
the rate of rise the peak pressures and
if<00:01:25.440> there's<00:01:25.619> any<00:01:25.770> nak<00:01:26.070> occurring<00:01:26.550> we<00:01:26.700> can<00:01:26.880> tell

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
if there's any nak occurring we can tell

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.880 
if there's any nak occurring we can tell
that<00:01:27.240> right<00:01:27.420> away<00:01:27.600> so<00:01:28.229> what<00:01:28.380> we're<00:01:28.500> doing<00:01:28.530> we

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
that right away so what we're doing we

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.499 
that right away so what we're doing we
run<00:01:29.039> in<00:01:29.160> steady-state<00:01:29.490> points<00:01:30.119> at<00:01:30.240> each<00:01:30.360> of

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
run in steady-state points at each of

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.060 
run in steady-state points at each of
the<00:01:30.600> different<00:01:30.630> speed<00:01:31.229> and<00:01:31.259> load<00:01:31.500> conditions

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
the different speed and load conditions

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.100 
the different speed and load conditions
we're<00:01:32.580> looking<00:01:32.850> for<00:01:33.060> spark<00:01:33.360> nap<00:01:33.570> or<00:01:33.840> making

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
we're looking for spark nap or making

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.719 
we're looking for spark nap or making
adjustments<00:01:34.679> to<00:01:34.770> fuel<00:01:34.979> and<00:01:35.130> spark<00:01:35.250> to<00:01:35.580> make

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
adjustments to fuel and spark to make

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.340 
adjustments to fuel and spark to make
sure<00:01:35.880> we<00:01:35.970> don't<00:01:36.090> have<00:01:36.270> any<00:01:36.330> issues<00:01:36.750> there<00:01:36.929> yeah

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
sure we don't have any issues there yeah

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.740 
sure we don't have any issues there yeah
I've<00:01:37.470> always<00:01:37.619> been<00:01:37.860> a<00:01:37.890> car<00:01:38.130> nut<00:01:38.330> from<00:01:39.330> day<00:01:39.479> one

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
I've always been a car nut from day one

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.690 
I've always been a car nut from day one
and<00:01:40.020> I<00:01:40.229> always<00:01:40.530> wanted<00:01:40.770> to<00:01:40.830> work<00:01:40.979> on<00:01:41.160> cars<00:01:41.429> and

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
and I always wanted to work on cars and

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.180 
and I always wanted to work on cars and
specifically<00:01:42.390> engines<00:01:42.890> I've<00:01:43.890> been<00:01:44.039> with

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:44.190 
specifically engines I've been with

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:46.639 
specifically engines I've been with
Chrysler<00:01:44.429> now<00:01:44.670> 29<00:01:45.149> years<00:01:45.479> I<00:01:45.750> was<00:01:46.380> on<00:01:46.530> the

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
Chrysler now 29 years I was on the

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.010 
Chrysler now 29 years I was on the
original<00:01:47.039> team<00:01:47.250> Viper<00:01:47.490> back<00:01:47.880> started<00:01:48.390> in<00:01:48.450> 1989

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
original team Viper back started in 1989

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.020 
original team Viper back started in 1989
before<00:01:49.470> that<00:01:49.860> I<00:01:49.890> was<00:01:50.130> at<00:01:50.250> Lamborghini<00:01:50.789> with

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
before that I was at Lamborghini with

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.270 
before that I was at Lamborghini with
Chrysler<00:01:51.330> so<00:01:52.080> I<00:01:52.140> kind<00:01:52.350> of<00:01:52.409> cut<00:01:52.590> my<00:01:52.740> teeth<00:01:52.800> there

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
Chrysler so I kind of cut my teeth there

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.730 
Chrysler so I kind of cut my teeth there
a<00:01:53.310> little<00:01:53.520> bit<00:01:53.670> on<00:01:53.789> v10s<00:01:54.300> came<00:01:55.050> back<00:01:55.289> worked<00:01:55.560> on

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
a little bit on v10s came back worked on

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.699 
a little bit on v10s came back worked on
Viper<00:01:56.539> Vipers<00:01:57.539> been<00:01:57.690> in<00:01:57.810> my<00:01:57.929> blood<00:01:58.110> ever<00:01:58.380> since

00:01:58.699 --> 00:01:58.709 
Viper Vipers been in my blood ever since

00:01:58.709 --> 00:02:02.509 
Viper Vipers been in my blood ever since
and<00:01:59.099> it's<00:02:00.030> part<00:02:00.300> of<00:02:00.390> me
