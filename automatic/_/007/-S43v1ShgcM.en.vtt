00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:44.530 
i'm going to drop the airship and

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:46.650 
i'm going to drop the airship and
hopefully<00:04:45.340> when<00:04:45.550> it<00:04:45.700> reaches<00:04:46.090> the<00:04:46.240> range<00:04:46.450> of

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:46.660 
hopefully when it reaches the range of

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:48.990 
hopefully when it reaches the range of
the<00:04:46.780> ir<00:04:47.140> transmitter<00:04:47.410> on<00:04:47.950> the<00:04:48.070> way<00:04:48.190> down<00:04:48.490> it's

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.000 
the ir transmitter on the way down it's

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.360 
the ir transmitter on the way down it's
going<00:04:49.120> to<00:04:49.210> turn<00:04:49.420> on<00:04:49.690> fly<00:04:50.410> around<00:04:50.560> hover<00:04:51.070> or

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:51.370 
going to turn on fly around hover or

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:54.570 
going to turn on fly around hover or
crash<00:04:51.760> so<00:04:52.300> that's<00:04:52.960> the<00:04:53.140> plan<00:04:53.400> what<00:04:54.400> could<00:04:54.550> go

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:54.580 
crash so that's the plan what could go

00:04:54.580 --> 00:05:16.690 
crash so that's the plan what could go
wrong

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:16.700 

00:05:16.700 --> 00:06:12.880 

the

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:12.890 

00:06:12.890 --> 00:07:14.500 

ahaha<00:06:13.890> the<00:06:13.950> glim<00:06:14.730> planted<00:06:15.180> perfectly

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:14.510 

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:49.230 

dropping<00:07:15.350> now

00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:49.240 

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:53.700

I really like this little airship and
I'm<00:07:53.860> really<00:07:54.039> nothing<00:07:54.759> bad<00:07:54.940> to<00:07:54.970> say<00:07:55.150> about<00:07:55.330> it

00:07:55.650 --> 00:07:55.660 
I'm really nothing bad to say about it

00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:57.540 
I'm really nothing bad to say about it
except<00:07:56.199> that<00:07:56.259> it<00:07:56.410> won't<00:07:56.770> work<00:07:56.979> in<00:07:57.220> the<00:07:57.310> Sun

00:07:57.540 --> 00:07:57.550

some clay especially if your trim knobs
don't<00:08:04.870> fully<00:08:05.169> compensate<00:08:05.949> otherwise<00:08:06.880> this<00:08:07.180> is

00:08:07.379 --> 00:08:07.389 
don't fully compensate otherwise this is

00:08:07.389 --> 00:08:09.330 
don't fully compensate otherwise this is
a<00:08:07.419> great<00:08:07.750> little<00:08:07.780> machine<00:08:08.199> and<00:08:08.710> it's<00:08:08.830> a<00:08:08.949> lot<00:08:09.160> of

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:09.340 
a great little machine and it's a lot of
