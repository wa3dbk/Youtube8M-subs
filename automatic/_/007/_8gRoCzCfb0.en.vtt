00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
only things you could really break his

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.060 
only things you could really break his
leaves<00:02:06.460> oh<00:02:06.820> if<00:02:07.780> you<00:02:07.960> need<00:02:08.170> to<00:02:08.380> you<00:02:08.500> can<00:02:08.530> break

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:09.070 
leaves oh if you need to you can break

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:10.380 
leaves oh if you need to you can break
one<00:02:09.310> in<00:02:09.459> order<00:02:09.640> to<00:02:09.700> get<00:02:09.880> something<00:02:10.090> but<00:02:10.300> you

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
one in order to get something but you

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
one in order to get something but you
cannot<00:02:10.750> use<00:02:11.019> the<00:02:11.230> wood<00:02:11.470> Oh<00:02:12.690> make<00:02:13.690> mainly<00:02:14.350> you

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
cannot use the wood Oh make mainly you

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:17.090 
cannot use the wood Oh make mainly you
can<00:02:14.560> only<00:02:14.769> use<00:02:14.980> leaves<00:02:15.280> and<00:02:15.580> shears<00:02:15.910> and

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
can only use leaves and shears and

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.009 
can only use leaves and shears and
another<00:02:18.100> thing<00:02:18.550> is<00:02:18.700> no<00:02:18.940> stacking<00:02:19.360> so<00:02:19.930> you

00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:20.019 
another thing is no stacking so you

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:22.080 
another thing is no stacking so you
can't<00:02:20.290> just<00:02:20.350> go<00:02:20.620> leave<00:02:20.920> and<00:02:21.220> stack<00:02:21.760> your<00:02:21.940> way

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
can't just go leave and stack your way

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:23.729 
can't just go leave and stack your way
around<00:02:22.239> to<00:02:22.569> the<00:02:22.660> top<00:02:22.900> and<00:02:23.140> make<00:02:23.319> yourself

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:23.739 
around to the top and make yourself

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:25.590 
around to the top and make yourself
these<00:02:23.920> bridges<00:02:24.220> and<00:02:24.550> stuff<00:02:24.819> so<00:02:25.330> we're<00:02:25.510> going

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600 
these bridges and stuff so we're going

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.440 
these bridges and stuff so we're going
to<00:02:25.690> say<00:02:25.840> no<00:02:26.080> stacking<00:02:26.440> with<00:02:26.739> the<00:02:26.890> leaves<00:02:27.100> of

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
to say no stacking with the leaves of

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.870 
to say no stacking with the leaves of
you<00:02:28.450> can<00:02:28.840> find<00:02:29.800> other<00:02:30.010> players<00:02:30.340> and<00:02:30.550> hit<00:02:30.700> them

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
you can find other players and hit them

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
you can find other players and hit them
as<00:02:31.150> well<00:02:31.450> but<00:02:33.120> depends<00:02:34.120> what<00:02:34.239> you<00:02:34.360> really<00:02:34.569> want

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
as well but depends what you really want

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.240 
as well but depends what you really want
to<00:02:34.959> do<00:02:35.110> if<00:02:35.230> you<00:02:35.319> have<00:02:35.350> any<00:02:35.650> strategy<00:02:36.160> or

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
to do if you have any strategy or

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.259 
to do if you have any strategy or
anything<00:02:36.610> oh<00:02:36.790> and<00:02:38.370> that's<00:02:39.370> really<00:02:39.910> not<00:02:40.060> much

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:40.269 
anything oh and that's really not much

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:42.060 
anything oh and that's really not much
not<00:02:40.510> too<00:02:40.690> much<00:02:40.720> rules<00:02:41.140> oh<00:02:41.260> yeah<00:02:41.440> you<00:02:41.500> can't<00:02:41.860> go

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.070 
not too much rules oh yeah you can't go

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:43.710 
not too much rules oh yeah you can't go
underground<00:02:42.370> or<00:02:42.700> anything<00:02:42.970> like<00:02:43.000> that<00:02:43.120> all

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
underground or anything like that all

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.020 
underground or anything like that all
you<00:02:44.140> can<00:02:44.290> do<00:02:44.470> is<00:02:44.680> go<00:02:45.040> the<00:02:45.190> trees<00:02:45.430> hide<00:02:45.670> run

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
you can do is go the trees hide run

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:50.340 
you can do is go the trees hide run
around<00:02:46.360> and<00:02:46.660> and<00:02:47.560> you<00:02:48.190> cannot<00:02:48.670> try<00:02:49.140> well<00:02:50.140> I

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
around and and you cannot try well I

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:52.350 
around and and you cannot try well I
guess<00:02:50.680> you<00:02:50.829> can<00:02:51.070> try<00:02:51.310> to<00:02:51.370> kill<00:02:51.579> slender<00:02:51.760> but<00:02:52.180> he

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
guess you can try to kill slender but he

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:53.759 
guess you can try to kill slender but he
will<00:02:52.510> want<00:02:52.660> it<00:02:52.750> that's<00:02:52.989> a<00:02:53.110> really<00:02:53.320> stupid<00:02:53.530> idea

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:53.769 
will want it that's a really stupid idea

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:56.370 
will want it that's a really stupid idea
so<00:02:54.519> why<00:02:54.670> would<00:02:54.850> you<00:02:54.880> do<00:02:55.060> that<00:02:55.090> because<00:02:55.840> to<00:02:56.110> kill

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
so why would you do that because to kill

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.110 
so why would you do that because to kill
you<00:02:56.560> and<00:02:57.070> so<00:02:57.220> yeah<00:02:57.370> you<00:02:57.430> just<00:02:57.640> hide<00:02:57.910> it's

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
you and so yeah you just hide it's

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.370 
you and so yeah you just hide it's
really<00:02:58.570> fun<00:02:58.810> it's<00:02:59.079> kind<00:02:59.260> of<00:02:59.290> like

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
really fun it's kind of like

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:00.990 
really fun it's kind of like
hide-and-seek<00:02:59.829> you<00:03:00.130> just<00:03:00.310> play<00:03:00.519> a<00:03:00.549> play<00:03:00.850> with

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
hide-and-seek you just play a play with

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.680 
hide-and-seek you just play a play with
other<00:03:01.120> people<00:03:01.510> they<00:03:01.630> liked<00:03:01.900> it<00:03:02.140> and<00:03:03.690> however

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
other people they liked it and however

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.800 
other people they liked it and however
you<00:03:05.079> want<00:03:05.380> and<00:03:05.590> also<00:03:06.340> what<00:03:06.970> you<00:03:07.150> have<00:03:07.269> to<00:03:07.390> do<00:03:07.540> is

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
you want and also what you have to do is

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:12.270 
you want and also what you have to do is
um<00:03:08.650> new<00:03:09.430> go<00:03:09.670> to<00:03:09.730> settings<00:03:10.859> graphics<00:03:11.859> and<00:03:12.160> you

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
um new go to settings graphics and you

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.580 
um new go to settings graphics and you
change<00:03:12.640> your<00:03:12.790> game<00:03:12.970> up<00:03:13.090> to<00:03:13.209> 75<00:03:13.840> that's<00:03:14.230> about

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
change your game up to 75 that's about

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.680 
change your game up to 75 that's about
the<00:03:15.340> gamma<00:03:15.549> everybody's<00:03:16.239> going<00:03:16.420> to<00:03:16.450> have<00:03:16.600> to

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
the gamma everybody's going to have to

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.380 
the gamma everybody's going to have to
change<00:03:16.989> the<00:03:17.280> 75%<00:03:18.280> gamma<00:03:18.549> because<00:03:19.180> it's

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
change the 75% gamma because it's

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:21.870 
change the 75% gamma because it's
because<00:03:20.109> that<00:03:20.290> it<00:03:20.440> gives<00:03:20.590> it<00:03:20.739> nice<00:03:21.250> and<00:03:21.640> dark

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
because that it gives it nice and dark

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.319 
because that it gives it nice and dark
but<00:03:22.359> it's<00:03:22.660> not<00:03:23.170> too<00:03:23.470> dark<00:03:23.680> the<00:03:24.370> same<00:03:24.670> time<00:03:24.970> it's

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:25.329 
but it's not too dark the same time it's

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:26.280 
but it's not too dark the same time it's
like<00:03:25.390> kind<00:03:25.720> of<00:03:25.780> bright

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
like kind of bright

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.140 
like kind of bright
still<00:03:26.469> see<00:03:26.709> but<00:03:26.920> it's<00:03:27.340> kind<00:03:27.579> of<00:03:27.700> right<00:03:27.909> because

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
still see but it's kind of right because

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:29.670 
still see but it's kind of right because
you<00:03:28.239> know<00:03:28.360> we<00:03:28.750> don't<00:03:28.870> want<00:03:29.049> cheaters<00:03:29.379> that<00:03:29.530> go

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
you know we don't want cheaters that go

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.530 
you know we don't want cheaters that go
to<00:03:29.739> life<00:03:30.040> you<00:03:30.519> know<00:03:30.549> full<00:03:30.969> brightness<00:03:31.209> and

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
to life you know full brightness and

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.119 
to life you know full brightness and
they<00:03:31.599> can<00:03:31.750> see<00:03:31.930> everything<00:03:32.170> no<00:03:32.439> you<00:03:32.799> got<00:03:32.920> to<00:03:32.950> go

00:03:33.119 --> 00:03:33.129 
they can see everything no you got to go

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:35.849 
they can see everything no you got to go
seven<00:03:33.340> times<00:03:33.609> gamma<00:03:33.819> i<00:03:34.239> got<00:03:34.750> fix<00:03:35.079> that<00:03:35.319> after<00:03:35.680> 0

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:35.859 
seven times gamma i got fix that after 0

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:39.449 
seven times gamma i got fix that after 0
75<00:03:36.640> gamma<00:03:37.120> and<00:03:37.510> yeah<00:03:38.439> it's<00:03:38.680> pretty<00:03:39.040> much<00:03:39.250> it

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:39.459 
75 gamma and yeah it's pretty much it

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:41.819 
75 gamma and yeah it's pretty much it
and<00:03:39.700> so<00:03:40.450> yeah<00:03:40.689> I<00:03:40.719> hope<00:03:40.989> you<00:03:41.140> guys<00:03:41.319> will<00:03:41.560> want<00:03:41.709> to
