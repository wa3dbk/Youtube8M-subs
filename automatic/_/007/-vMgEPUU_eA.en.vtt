downplayed telekinesis I don't use a lot
in<00:00:13.980> this<00:00:14.280> vid<00:00:14.549> a<00:00:14.759> strategy<00:00:15.719> guide<00:00:16.619> but<00:00:17.039> um<00:00:17.220> it

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
in this vid a strategy guide but um it

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.670 
in this vid a strategy guide but um it
does<00:00:18.119> have<00:00:18.300> its<00:00:18.420> benefits<00:00:18.480> and<00:00:19.170> it<00:00:19.230> has<00:00:19.380> very

the Germans could have been interested
in<00:00:40.590> something<00:00:40.890> useful

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:59.450

plasmid<00:01:02.190> slots<00:01:02.429> at<00:01:02.549> this<00:01:02.670> time<00:01:02.850> you<00:01:03.030> have<00:01:03.179> to

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
plasmid slots at this time you have to

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.030 
plasmid slots at this time you have to
choose<00:01:03.600> a<00:01:03.629> plasma<00:01:04.259> you<00:01:04.379> have<00:01:04.559> right<00:01:04.799> now<00:01:04.979> to

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
choose a plasma you have right now to

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.779 
choose a plasma you have right now to
replace<00:01:05.640> and<00:01:06.409> I<00:01:07.520> always<00:01:08.520> choose<00:01:09.060> fire

00:01:10.779 --> 00:01:10.789 
replace and I always choose fire

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:13.670 
replace and I always choose fire
surprisingly<00:01:11.789> I<00:01:12.030> don't<00:01:12.570> use<00:01:12.780> fire<00:01:13.020> very<00:01:13.470> much

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
surprisingly I don't use fire very much

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.770 
surprisingly I don't use fire very much
at<00:01:13.860> all<00:01:14.039> and<00:01:14.399> the<00:01:14.580> electric<00:01:14.939> shock<00:01:15.180> has<00:01:15.479> so

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
at all and the electric shock has so

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.240 
at all and the electric shock has so
many<00:01:15.869> more<00:01:16.080> benefits<00:01:16.170> on<00:01:16.950> with<00:01:17.159> the

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
many more benefits on with the

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.570 
many more benefits on with the
immobilization<00:01:17.610> of<00:01:18.149> enemies<00:01:18.539> and<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:19.320> water

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:19.580 
immobilization of enemies and the water

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.570 
immobilization of enemies and the water
shocked<00:01:20.580> that<00:01:21.210> I<00:01:21.240> definitely<00:01:21.630> keep<00:01:21.899> it<00:01:22.220> so<00:01:23.220> i

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
shocked that I definitely keep it so i

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.639 
shocked that I definitely keep it so i
would<00:01:24.090> highly<00:01:24.360> recommend<00:01:24.570> that<00:01:25.140> you<00:01:25.259> replace

00:01:25.639 --> 00:01:25.649 
would highly recommend that you replace

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:27.859 
would highly recommend that you replace
fire<00:01:26.039> instead<00:01:26.670> of<00:01:26.819> the<00:01:26.909> shock<00:01:27.149> when<00:01:27.479> you<00:01:27.509> on

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
fire instead of the shock when you on

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.090 
fire instead of the shock when you on
choose<00:01:28.140> which<00:01:28.380> slot<00:01:28.649> to<00:01:28.830> use<00:01:28.979> your

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
choose which slot to use your

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.859 
choose which slot to use your
telekinesis<00:01:29.729> in<00:01:29.940> um<00:01:32.179> again<00:01:33.179> it's<00:01:33.330> up<00:01:33.539> to<00:01:33.690> you

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
telekinesis in um again it's up to you

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.809 
telekinesis in um again it's up to you
but<00:01:34.200> for<00:01:34.440> the<00:01:34.860> remainder<00:01:35.100> of<00:01:35.220> this<00:01:35.340> strategy<00:01:35.789> i

00:01:35.809 --> 00:01:35.819 
but for the remainder of this strategy i

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:38.770 
but for the remainder of this strategy i
will<00:01:36.360> be<00:01:37.049> using<00:01:37.200> electric<00:01:37.649> shock<00:01:37.860> so<00:01:38.280> i

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
will be using electric shock so i

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:45.900 
will be using electric shock so i
recommend<00:01:39.780> you<00:01:39.929> stick<00:01:40.140> with<00:01:40.170> it

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:45.910 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:02:13.880 

way

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:03:15.290 

nothing<00:02:14.400> like<00:02:14.730> you<00:02:15.000> I<00:02:15.510> you

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:18.420 

okay<00:03:16.300> now's<00:03:16.930> the<00:03:16.960> time<00:03:17.380> we're<00:03:17.680> going<00:03:17.890> to<00:03:18.010> grab

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
okay now's the time we're going to grab

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.580 
okay now's the time we're going to grab
the<00:03:18.670> shotgun<00:03:18.850> and<00:03:19.450> when<00:03:19.900> you<00:03:19.990> grab<00:03:20.230> it<00:03:20.410> it's

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
the shotgun and when you grab it it's

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:21.930 
the shotgun and when you grab it it's
going<00:03:20.860> to<00:03:20.920> go<00:03:21.040> dark<00:03:21.370> and<00:03:21.640> it's<00:03:21.760> going<00:03:21.850> to

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
going to go dark and it's going to

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:25.680 
going to go dark and it's going to
trigger<00:03:22.180> a<00:03:23.550> lot<00:03:24.550> of<00:03:24.670> enemies<00:03:25.000> but<00:03:25.300> they're<00:03:25.510> all

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
trigger a lot of enemies but they're all

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.020 
trigger a lot of enemies but they're all
fairly<00:03:26.140> simple<00:03:26.620> and<00:03:26.800> all<00:03:27.160> you<00:03:27.280> need<00:03:27.459> is<00:03:27.700> your

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
fairly simple and all you need is your

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:29.910 
fairly simple and all you need is your
wrench<00:03:28.240> you<00:03:29.170> really<00:03:29.380> don't<00:03:29.530> even<00:03:29.560> have<00:03:29.800> to

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
wrench you really don't even have to

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.830 
wrench you really don't even have to
shock<00:03:30.160> them<00:03:30.400> so<00:03:32.700> it<00:03:33.700> helps<00:03:33.970> to<00:03:34.060> have<00:03:34.090> some

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
shock them so it helps to have some

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.300 
shock them so it helps to have some
first<00:03:35.020> aid<00:03:35.170> kits<00:03:35.410> available<00:03:35.500> in<00:03:35.920> case<00:03:36.070> you<00:03:36.190> do

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
first aid kits available in case you do

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:38.850 
first aid kits available in case you do
get<00:03:36.459> hit<00:03:36.700> but<00:03:37.390> once<00:03:38.350> you<00:03:38.440> grab<00:03:38.590> the<00:03:38.709> shotgun

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:38.860 
get hit but once you grab the shotgun

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:42.510 
get hit but once you grab the shotgun
just<00:03:39.370> wake<00:03:39.520> your<00:03:39.790> wrench<00:03:40.090> and<00:03:40.410> I<00:03:41.410> like<00:03:42.160> to<00:03:42.310> kind

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:42.520 
just wake your wrench and I like to kind

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.250 
just wake your wrench and I like to kind
of<00:03:42.550> go<00:03:42.670> back<00:03:42.850> into<00:03:43.030> a<00:03:43.120> corner<00:03:43.510> and<00:03:43.660> just<00:03:44.080> kind
