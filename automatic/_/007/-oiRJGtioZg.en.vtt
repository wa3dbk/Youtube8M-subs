00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.080 
I've borrowed enjoyed setting this that

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.050 
I've borrowed enjoyed setting this that
this<00:01:32.290> up<00:01:32.560> the<00:01:32.710> water<00:01:32.920> cooling<00:01:33.310> system<00:01:33.700> works

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.060 
this up the water cooling system works

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.380 
this up the water cooling system works
amazingly<00:01:34.750> compared<00:01:35.409> to<00:01:35.530> the<00:01:35.710> and<00:01:36.390> having

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390 
amazingly compared to the and having

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:39.960 
amazingly compared to the and having
fans<00:01:37.720> set<00:01:38.080> up<00:01:38.200> in<00:01:38.380> the<00:01:38.500> case<00:01:38.740> and<00:01:39.100> the<00:01:39.490> free

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:39.970 
fans set up in the case and the free

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:42.030 
fans set up in the case and the free
fans<00:01:40.299> that<00:01:40.570> were<00:01:40.720> originally<00:01:41.650> on<00:01:42.010> the

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:42.040 
fans that were originally on the

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.969 
fans that were originally on the
reference<00:01:42.610> 7990<00:01:43.510> so<00:01:44.110> it's<00:01:44.740> a<00:01:44.860> great

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:44.979 
reference 7990 so it's a great

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:46.620 
reference 7990 so it's a great
improvement<00:01:45.460> and<00:01:45.880> there's<00:01:46.000> not<00:01:46.180> really<00:01:46.390> not

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630 
improvement and there's not really not

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.340 
improvement and there's not really not
that<00:01:46.780> much<00:01:46.960> noise<00:01:47.260> it<00:01:47.500> even<00:01:47.860> under<00:01:48.130> full<00:01:48.340> load

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
that much noise it even under full load

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.820 
that much noise it even under full load
now<00:01:50.350> when<00:01:50.619> playing<00:01:50.830> games<00:01:51.189> and<00:01:51.430> high<00:01:51.700> settings

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:52.830 
now when playing games and high settings

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:55.530 
now when playing games and high settings
that<00:01:53.830> the<00:01:54.070> only<00:01:54.220> increase<00:01:54.790> in<00:01:55.060> fan<00:01:55.330> noise

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:55.540 
that the only increase in fan noise

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:00.780 
that the only increase in fan noise
comes<00:01:55.900> from<00:01:56.140> the<00:01:57.540> psu<00:01:58.540> the<00:01:58.990> power<00:01:59.229> supply<00:01:59.790> but

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:00.790 
comes from the psu the power supply but

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:05.070 
comes from the psu the power supply but
even<00:02:00.939> that's<00:02:01.299> not<00:02:01.450> not<00:02:02.380> anything<00:02:02.710> to<00:02:04.080> concern

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:05.080 
even that's not not anything to concern

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:09.270 
even that's not not anything to concern

79 I know with the reference fans I I I

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:17.030 
79 I know with the reference fans I I I
felt<00:02:15.969> it<00:02:16.090> was

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
felt it was

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.160 
felt it was
quite<00:02:17.819> loud<00:02:18.120> and<00:02:18.510> and<00:02:18.689> that's<00:02:18.989> what

quite loud and and that's what

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.929 
quite loud and and that's what
ultimately<00:02:19.590> led<00:02:19.680> me<00:02:20.010> to<00:02:20.219> practice<00:02:20.519> in<00:02:20.849> my

00:02:20.929 --> 00:02:20.939 
ultimately led me to practice in my

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:25.069 
ultimately led me to practice in my
first<00:02:21.680> water<00:02:22.680> cooling<00:02:23.129> system<00:02:23.840> but<00:02:24.840> yeah<00:02:24.959> I'm

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:25.079 
first water cooling system but yeah I'm

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:27.740 
first water cooling system but yeah I'm
very<00:02:25.109> pleased<00:02:25.560> with<00:02:25.590> it<00:02:25.859> in<00:02:26.099> the<00:02:26.939> new<00:02:27.120> year<00:02:27.450> I

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
very pleased with it in the new year I

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.069 
very pleased with it in the new year I
may<00:02:28.560> consider<00:02:29.239> switching<00:02:30.239> the<00:02:30.540> motherboard

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:31.079 
may consider switching the motherboard

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:35.660 
may consider switching the motherboard
and<00:02:31.290> cpu<00:02:31.349> to<00:02:32.099> her<00:02:32.750> AMD<00:02:34.010> Kaveri<00:02:35.010> set<00:02:35.340> up<00:02:35.519> when

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
and cpu to her AMD Kaveri set up when

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.460 
and cpu to her AMD Kaveri set up when
they<00:02:35.790> become<00:02:36.030> available<00:02:36.180> but<00:02:36.900> that<00:02:37.290> will<00:02:37.439> be

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
they become available but that will be

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.309 
they become available but that will be
dependent<00:02:38.069> on<00:02:38.220> how<00:02:39.120> powerful<00:02:39.780> the<00:02:39.900> top<00:02:40.109> of<00:02:40.260> the

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
dependent on how powerful the top of the

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:44.599 
dependent on how powerful the top of the
range<00:02:41.689> Kaveri<00:02:42.689> will<00:02:42.989> be<00:02:43.139> so<00:02:44.069> yeah<00:02:44.250> there's<00:02:44.459> my

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:44.609 
range Kaveri will be so yeah there's my

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:46.789 
range Kaveri will be so yeah there's my
