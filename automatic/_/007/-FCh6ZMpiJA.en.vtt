00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.420
 in the salon des passions we find costume jewelery from which kuriles 

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:08.050
 clowns but we find mostly passionate jean-charles and retirees 

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:09.859
 he pinches it for the models 

00:00:09.859 --> 00:00:13.759
 his finest work this wheel boat took him a year's work of eight 

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:17.769
 hours a day for the whole complicated by handicap jean-charles the case the 

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:21.119
 arm to work the finished side my model I'm satisfied 

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:24.310
 then the mississippi is the sea 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:26.619
 it's one of the most beautiful that's true 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:29.220
 some shuffles in between rob 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.820
 radio controlled at most a fishing boat I'm happy 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.600
 a sea rescue boat the passion has no limits not even 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.440
 the one set by the mississippi wallet cost more than 700 dead 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.100
 or in equipment it is the motor part which cost the most expensive but it 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.780
 allows the boat to evolve on water 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.240
 the passion of the six sites minutia patience and versatility and alexander 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:53.430
 attic 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.810
 on the other hand 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:59.150
 the electronic electricity morale since all the models are 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:00.450
 Radio Controlled 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:02.570
 fifth actor and entry point 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.450
 its flagship measure for a wide range of DIY or economic 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.770
 the bill 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.450
 for all other passionate Pauline encounters after going 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.160
 by the drawing then the gouache and the oil painting 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.970
 she tries to translate into watercolor master of the places she admires these 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:20.750
 weapons are simple paper 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.000
 not a dime summer cloth colors that's why trying to 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:29.570
 to translate through the press that the community I see around me 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.630
 in the varied landscapes 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.440
 objects as expected 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.440
 what does the word watercolor work eric woerth mean 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.130
 and that's what gives brightness and transparency 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.920
 I do not really like how their lives feel about photos 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.900
 on site to better soak up the atmosphere 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.390
 but the watercolor of the eu does not take all its time it is by period 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.790
 that is clear it is much easier 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.660
 as soon as the good days come out 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.600
 in the middle of nature and then go in search of a place 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.500
 for many representatives of the state to sad birthday by 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.620
 example yet I like very much know him say all his colors 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.959
 platelets or watercolor the passion and the same a passion as those amateurs who 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:12.250
 do not like to share he appreciates as they did at the show
