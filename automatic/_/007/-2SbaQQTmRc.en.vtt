00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
really see the need to measure more than

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.140 
really see the need to measure more than
that<00:00:27.630> so<00:00:28.070> yeah<00:00:29.070> I'll<00:00:29.460> let<00:00:29.580> you<00:00:29.699> see<00:00:29.849> how<00:00:29.970> much

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:40.430 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:47.350 

and<00:00:41.430> it<00:00:41.879> is<00:00:41.910> at<00:00:42.180> fifteen<00:00:42.660> and<00:00:42.690> a<00:00:42.989> half<00:00:44.870> okay

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:47.360 
and it is at fifteen and a half okay

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.299 
and it is at fifteen and a half okay
let<00:00:48.360> me<00:00:48.450> do<00:00:48.629> these<00:00:48.809> ones<00:00:49.170> that<00:00:49.289> I<00:00:49.469> combined<00:00:49.950> on

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
let me do these ones that I combined on

00:00:50.309 --> 00:01:02.330 
let me do these ones that I combined on
the<00:00:50.399> side<00:00:52.550> and<00:00:54.469> this<00:00:55.469> one<00:00:55.710> is<00:00:55.890> at<00:00:57.530> 15<00:01:01.039> okay

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
the side and this one is at 15 okay

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:17.200 
the side and this one is at 15 okay
take<00:01:03.210> what's<00:01:03.390> in<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.600> middle

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:23.470 

this<00:01:18.200> one<00:01:18.350> is<00:01:18.440> at<00:01:18.560> 14<00:01:19.040> I<00:01:21.640> know<00:01:22.640> the<00:01:23.030> middle<00:01:23.390> of

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:23.480 
this one is at 14 I know the middle of

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.530 
this one is at 14 I know the middle of
my<00:01:23.570> head<00:01:23.810> have<00:01:24.260> we<00:01:24.410> shorted<00:01:24.710> like<00:01:25.240> this<00:01:26.240> when<00:01:26.420> I

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:26.540 
my head have we shorted like this when I

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.660 
my head have we shorted like this when I
cut<00:01:26.810> my<00:01:26.840> perm<00:01:27.260> I<00:01:27.410> just<00:01:27.620> cut<00:01:27.800> off<00:01:27.920> too<00:01:28.130> much<00:01:28.280> I

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
cut my perm I just cut off too much I

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.060 
cut my perm I just cut off too much I
didn't<00:01:29.270> I<00:01:29.480> would<00:01:30.170> like<00:01:30.290> that<00:01:30.560> while<00:01:30.830> I<00:01:30.860> was

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
didn't I would like that while I was

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.310 
didn't I would like that while I was
cutting<00:01:31.460> it<00:01:31.760> so<00:01:32.240> that's<00:01:32.450> probably<00:01:32.630> why<00:01:32.870> short

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320 
cutting it so that's probably why short

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.969 
cutting it so that's probably why short
the<00:01:33.979> middle<00:01:34.250> of<00:01:34.340> my<00:01:34.430> head<00:01:34.580> is<00:01:34.820> so<00:01:34.940> short<00:01:35.979> in

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:36.979 
the middle of my head is so short in

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:44.830 
the middle of my head is so short in
comparison<00:01:39.220> this<00:01:40.220> one<00:01:40.840> is<00:01:42.100> at<00:01:43.100> 15<00:01:43.940> to<00:01:44.510> little

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
comparison this one is at 15 to little

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:51.069 
comparison this one is at 15 to little
15

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:51.079 

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:54.670 

and<00:01:51.200> I'll<00:01:52.299> measure<00:01:53.299> a<00:01:53.450> couple<00:01:54.049> in<00:01:54.110> the<00:01:54.170> back

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:54.680 
and I'll measure a couple in the back

00:01:54.680 --> 00:02:04.149 
and I'll measure a couple in the back
seems<00:01:55.490> like<00:01:55.640> my<00:01:55.759> average<00:01:56.180> is<00:01:56.360> 15

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:04.159 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:13.089 

this<00:02:04.789> one<00:02:05.030> in<00:02:06.999> 14<00:02:07.999> and<00:02:08.179> a<00:02:08.239> half

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:13.099 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:21.920 

and<00:02:13.609> this<00:02:14.060> one

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:27.059 

fifteen

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:27.069 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:32.630 

I<00:02:27.099> need<00:02:27.670> to<00:02:27.790> do<00:02:27.939> a<00:02:27.970> couple<00:02:28.180> more<00:02:28.360> but<00:02:28.599> good<00:02:28.720> luck

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.540 

this<00:02:33.240> one

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:44.600 

another<00:02:38.240> 15

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:51.220 

and

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.190 

performances<00:02:52.230> past<00:02:52.500> four<00:02:52.739> teams<00:02:54.049> so<00:02:55.049> they

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
performances past four teams so they

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.349 
performances past four teams so they
must<00:02:55.349> be<00:02:55.409> most<00:02:55.709> of<00:02:55.829> my<00:02:55.950> 15<00:02:56.549> I<00:02:56.579> have<00:02:56.879> a<00:02:56.909> couple<00:02:57.239> at

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:57.359 
must be most of my 15 I have a couple at

00:02:57.359 --> 00:03:03.500 
must be most of my 15 I have a couple at
14<00:02:57.840> or<00:02:58.140> 14<00:02:58.469> 1/2<00:02:58.849> but<00:03:00.739> yeah<00:03:01.969> the<00:03:02.969> first<00:03:03.000> things

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
14 or 14 1/2 but yeah the first things

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.309 
14 or 14 1/2 but yeah the first things
that<00:03:03.569> I<00:03:03.900> did<00:03:04.109> about<00:03:04.290> a<00:03:04.409> year<00:03:04.500> ago<00:03:04.890> I<00:03:05.219> was<00:03:05.879> at

00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:06.319 
that I did about a year ago I was at

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:10.819 
that I did about a year ago I was at
about<00:03:07.319> 10<00:03:07.920> inches<00:03:08.129> average<00:03:09.120> so<00:03:09.659> I<00:03:10.109> guess<00:03:10.709> the

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:10.829 
about 10 inches average so I guess the

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:13.190 
about 10 inches average so I guess the
pics<00:03:11.010> of<00:03:11.099> things<00:03:11.310> that<00:03:11.459> I<00:03:11.689> move<00:03:12.689> about<00:03:12.780> 5

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200

- shrinkage of cord what's an inspectors
I<00:03:18.900> guess<00:03:19.019> I<00:03:19.109> have<00:03:19.290> about<00:03:19.530> an<00:03:19.980> inch<00:03:20.219> of

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
I guess I have about an inch of

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:24.050 
I guess I have about an inch of
shrinkage<00:03:21.019> because<00:03:22.019> they<00:03:22.379> say<00:03:22.819> your<00:03:23.819> hair
