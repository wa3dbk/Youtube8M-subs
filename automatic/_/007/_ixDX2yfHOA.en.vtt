00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
give it to a good home rather than it be

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.580

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
it's the wire cell fusion ink foundation

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.780 
it's the wire cell fusion ink foundation
I<00:03:39.720> think<00:03:40.170> I<00:03:40.260> saw<00:03:40.410> Shannon<00:03:40.920> do<00:03:41.100> a<00:03:41.130> review<00:03:41.610> on<00:03:41.760> it

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
I think I saw Shannon do a review on it

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.000 
I think I saw Shannon do a review on it
and<00:03:42.060> it<00:03:42.120> kind<00:03:42.330> of<00:03:42.390> made<00:03:42.570> me<00:03:42.600> want<00:03:42.930> it<00:03:43.200> so<00:03:43.769> I<00:03:43.800> got

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
and it kind of made me want it so I got

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:48.020 
and it kind of made me want it so I got
it<00:03:44.160> and<00:03:44.370> I<00:03:45.180> do<00:03:45.360> like<00:03:45.810> it<00:03:46.140> it's<00:03:46.380> very<00:03:47.030> powdery

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
it and I do like it it's very powdery

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.600 
it and I do like it it's very powdery
it's<00:03:48.840> literally<00:03:49.470> like<00:03:49.620> a<00:03:49.680> liquid<00:03:50.220> to<00:03:50.400> powder

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:50.610 
it's literally like a liquid to powder

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:52.400 
it's literally like a liquid to powder
so<00:03:51.000> it<00:03:51.030> feels<00:03:51.330> like<00:03:51.570> I've<00:03:51.720> got<00:03:51.750> powder<00:03:52.110> on<00:03:52.290> my

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
so it feels like I've got powder on my

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.470 
so it feels like I've got powder on my
face<00:03:52.650> not<00:03:52.950> a<00:03:53.130> liquid<00:03:53.340> foundation<00:03:54.090> and<00:03:54.239> the

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
face not a liquid foundation and the

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.690 
face not a liquid foundation and the
coverage<00:03:54.959> isn't<00:03:55.440> that<00:03:55.620> great<00:03:55.890> on<00:03:56.190> it<00:03:56.340> so<00:03:56.550> it's

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
coverage isn't that great on it so it's

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.790 
coverage isn't that great on it so it's
very<00:03:56.940> different<00:03:57.510> to<00:03:57.840> what<00:03:57.870> I'm<00:03:58.050> used<00:03:58.080> to<00:03:58.410> but<00:03:58.500> I

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:58.800 
very different to what I'm used to but I

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:01.190 
very different to what I'm used to but I
kind<00:03:59.160> of<00:03:59.250> like<00:03:59.459> it<00:03:59.489> kind<00:04:00.090> of<00:04:00.209> don't<00:04:00.450> anyways<00:04:00.989> we
