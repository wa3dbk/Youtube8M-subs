00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.930 
the same way it warms the bottle of
sterilized<00:02:27.770> so<00:02:28.770> it<00:02:28.920> should<00:02:29.130> be<00:02:29.310> going<00:02:29.550> off<00:02:29.730> in

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940

a<00:02:30.030> couple<00:02:30.420> seconds<00:02:30.930> letting<00:02:31.800> us<00:02:31.890> know<00:02:31.920> that

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
a couple seconds letting us know that

and<00:02:40.010> at<00:02:40.220> the<00:02:40.340> end<00:02:40.550> you<00:02:40.700> can<00:02:40.880> see<00:02:40.910> that<00:02:41.450> is

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.020 
and at the end you can see that is

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:43.720 
and at the end you can see that is
bubbling<00:02:42.470> real<00:02:42.680> fast<00:02:43.010> and<00:02:43.220> the<00:02:43.340> water<00:02:43.550> is

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
bubbling real fast and the water is

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.120 
bubbling real fast and the water is
almost<00:02:43.940> out<00:02:44.300> that's<00:02:44.960> why<00:02:45.110> I'm<00:02:45.200> very<00:02:45.440> important

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
almost out that's why I'm very important

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:10.390 
green and sometimes you might want to
give<00:03:09.230> it<00:03:09.260> a<00:03:09.380> couple<00:03:09.530> seconds<00:03:10.100> so<00:03:10.250> they're

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
give it a couple seconds so they're

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.110 
give it a couple seconds so they're
still<00:03:10.580> steaming<00:03:11.060> before<00:03:11.690> you<00:03:11.840> take<00:03:12.050> it<00:03:12.080> out

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
still steaming before you take it out

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.670

yeah<00:03:14.120> we've<00:03:14.630> heard<00:03:14.780> a<00:03:14.930> few<00:03:15.080> complaints<00:03:15.440> about

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
yeah we've heard a few complaints about

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.770 
yeah we've heard a few complaints about
the<00:03:17.620> alarm<00:03:18.620> but<00:03:18.920> I'd<00:03:19.850> actually<00:03:20.270> think<00:03:20.600> it's<00:03:20.720> a

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
the alarm but I'd actually think it's a

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.200 
the alarm but I'd actually think it's a
good<00:03:20.930> thing<00:03:20.990> just<00:03:21.440> because<00:03:21.740> you<00:03:22.610> can<00:03:22.790> be<00:03:22.910> doing

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:23.210 
good thing just because you can be doing

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:25.540 
good thing just because you can be doing
other<00:03:23.390> things<00:03:23.650> with<00:03:24.650> your<00:03:24.680> baby<00:03:24.980> as<00:03:25.190> far<00:03:25.430> as

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:25.550 
other things with your baby as far as

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:29.220 
other things with your baby as far as
changing<00:03:25.820> them<00:03:26.240> or<00:03:27.040> feet<00:03:28.040> or<00:03:28.340> you<00:03:28.820> know

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
changing them or feet or you know

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.000 
changing them or feet or you know
anything<00:03:30.230> in<00:03:30.350> out<00:03:30.470> of<00:03:30.560> the<00:03:30.620> room<00:03:30.800> and<00:03:30.920> you

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
anything in out of the room and you

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:32.230 
anything in out of the room and you
still<00:03:31.280> be<00:03:31.400> able<00:03:31.460> to<00:03:31.580> hit<00:03:31.700> that<00:03:31.850> long<00:03:32.030> when<00:03:32.210> it

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:32.240 
still be able to hit that long when it

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:50.580 
still be able to hit that long when it
goes<00:03:32.450> off<00:03:32.660> so<00:03:33.530> I<00:03:33.560> think<00:03:33.650> it's<00:03:33.890> a<00:03:33.950> good<00:03:34.130> feature

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:54.670 

put<00:03:51.590> the<00:03:51.740> water<00:03:52.570> cover<00:03:53.570> and<00:03:53.750> do<00:03:54.230> it<00:03:54.320> the<00:03:54.440> same

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 
put the water cover and do it the same

00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:01.900 
put the water cover and do it the same
way<00:03:59.110> and<00:04:00.110> that's<00:04:00.410> my<00:04:00.590> conclusion<00:04:00.830> of<00:04:01.760> the

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:01.910 
way and that's my conclusion of the

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:05.380 
way and that's my conclusion of the
review<00:04:02.090> on<00:04:03.080> the<00:04:03.440> Munchkin<00:04:04.010> bottle<00:04:04.520> warmer<00:04:04.880> and
