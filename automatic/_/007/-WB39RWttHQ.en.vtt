club<00:04:03.430> and<00:04:03.579> then<00:04:03.790> I'll<00:04:04.090> I<00:04:04.239> actually<00:04:04.420> like<00:04:04.690> this

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
club and then I'll I actually like this

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:06.869 
club and then I'll I actually like this
one<00:04:04.930> right<00:04:05.200> here<00:04:05.260> the<00:04:06.069> armband<00:04:06.430> clip<00:04:06.730> because

00:04:06.869 --> 00:04:06.879 
one right here the armband clip because

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:08.789 
one right here the armband clip because
it<00:04:07.120> has<00:04:07.239> velcro<00:04:07.480> so<00:04:08.170> it's<00:04:08.260> a<00:04:08.290> little<00:04:08.439> easier<00:04:08.530> to

00:04:08.789 --> 00:04:08.799 
it has velcro so it's a little easier to

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:10.500 
it has velcro so it's a little easier to
tighten<00:04:09.099> down<00:04:09.129> and<00:04:09.970> of<00:04:10.030> course<00:04:10.060> you<00:04:10.359> can

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510 
tighten down and of course you can

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:12.210 
tighten down and of course you can
charge<00:04:10.689> it<00:04:10.780> so<00:04:11.530> I'm<00:04:11.620> going<00:04:11.680> to<00:04:11.829> give<00:04:11.920> it<00:04:12.010> four

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.510

camera to watch what you recorded and

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.370 
camera to watch what you recorded and
the<00:04:31.150> other<00:04:31.270> thing<00:04:31.330> is<00:04:31.479> the<00:04:31.660> Wi-Fi<00:04:32.020> network

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:32.380 
the other thing is the Wi-Fi network

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:34.230 
the other thing is the Wi-Fi network
range<00:04:32.620> on<00:04:32.830> this<00:04:32.979> is<00:04:33.130> someone<00:04:33.789> limited<00:04:34.120> so

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 
range on this is someone limited so

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.510 
range on this is someone limited so
after<00:04:34.449> you<00:04:34.510> get<00:04:34.660> to<00:04:34.780> pout<00:04:34.990> 20<00:04:35.380> 30<00:04:35.590> feet<00:04:35.889> you're

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:36.520 
after you get to pout 20 30 feet you're

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.490 
after you get to pout 20 30 feet you're
going<00:04:36.639> to<00:04:36.699> probably<00:04:36.849> drop<00:04:37.240> it<00:04:37.479> drop<00:04:37.690> the<00:04:37.960> Wi-Fi

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:38.500 
going to probably drop it drop the Wi-Fi

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.439 
going to probably drop it drop the Wi-Fi
signal<00:04:38.919> from<00:04:39.039> the<00:04:39.159> camera<00:04:39.490> so<00:04:40.120> keep<00:04:40.300> that<00:04:40.330> in

00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:40.449 
signal from the camera so keep that in

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:42.600 
signal from the camera so keep that in
mind<00:04:40.659> if<00:04:40.750> you<00:04:40.870> need<00:04:41.020> to<00:04:41.110> have<00:04:41.260> real<00:04:41.610> extended

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:42.610 
mind if you need to have real extended

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:44.730 
mind if you need to have real extended
viewing<00:04:43.000> the<00:04:43.780> Wi-Fi<00:04:44.080> signal<00:04:44.470> might<00:04:44.620> not

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:44.740 
viewing the Wi-Fi signal might not

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:46.950 
viewing the Wi-Fi signal might not
support<00:04:44.949> that<00:04:45.340> but<00:04:45.580> overall<00:04:45.849> I<00:04:46.120> think<00:04:46.570> it's

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 
support that but overall I think it's

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.719 
support that but overall I think it's
worth<00:04:47.169> four<00:04:47.380> and<00:04:47.470> a<00:04:47.500> half<00:04:47.530> stars<00:04:47.620> so<00:04:48.550> nice

00:04:48.719 --> 00:04:48.729 
worth four and a half stars so nice

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:51.330 
worth four and a half stars so nice
economical<00:04:49.479> action<00:04:50.169> camera<00:04:50.530> with<00:04:51.099> some
