00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 hello to all people I am inspire you God 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.990
 I bring a fifa 12 gameplay I think 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.360
 I honestly do not know what example and you 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.330
 I'm going to put this this video I want it 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:15.570
 take advantage to give explanations not that 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:18.930
 there was a lot of excitement about the offer of 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:21.810
 the xbox how much it cost you left for free 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.990
 I'll explain it to you and I'll also 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.660
 explain the consequences that 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.539
 for my channel you can have a new 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:34.220
 console first what the offer is 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:38.489
 about my birthday is ok and they told me 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:41.910
 hey well a friend did not tell me hey there's 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:44.680
 this offer at gamestop but then you would 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.950
 payment but 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:49.720
 you should give your ps3 and some games 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:52.420
 so that it came out to buy you the 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:54.670
 cifa and the gold and I said there is no 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.380
 problem there is no problem and nothing else was 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.850
 A gift from a friend is worth not me 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:03.769
 said the price and 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:05.420
 and it was a gamestop offer that was 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:07.880
 I finished until I finished stocks 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.390
 until it's over, it did not work out 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:13.700
 free is not the price but that 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:15.770
 gave to me is the xbox whatever it is to me 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:20.479
 it came free but the person who sees the 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:23.210
 gift is not worth it and also that as much 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:26.450
 mess that you've gone to the xbox is 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:29.119
 shit the xbox the ps3 is better at 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.940
 no moment of a boxing I said that the 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:34.940
 ps3 was a garbage was a shit all 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:38.479
 otherwise I had an xbox and then 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:41.479
 I went to ps3 first ok but now 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:43.729
 I see that there are more people who are in xbox 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:46.940
 they also told me that it was time to 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:51.100
 make the change and many of my friends 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:55.299
 and they go they will start to move to 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:58.360
 to xbox in no time I said that 

00:01:55.299 --> 00:02:00.490
 I'm not going to play in ps3 either because I have 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:03.729
 a friend who today his weekends 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:06.759
 home is very truck and you have to give in 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:08.890
 ours because he has a ps3 not so 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:11.080
 there I will connect to depend the 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:13.360
 games of the games forgiveness that 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.670
 buy online what I know maybe it's 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:19.260
 buy the future call of duty black ops' 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:21.750
 cough you 'll see me there playing with him 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.120
 or the whole roll connecting on the play 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:27.269
 ok I never said I was going 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:29.189
 to stop playing in ps3 but good the 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:31.409
 people are riding their movies and such 

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:35.400
 it was also a boxing that is not explained 

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:37.709
 nothing very fast very excited because to 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.769
 I really like the xbox forever 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:42.750
 the command and such the command is a pain in the ass if 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:45.359
 I tell you the truth because the joysticks 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:49.319
 they are like sunk and they are not like those of 

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:51.359
 those of ps3 that are are are like how 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:54.120
 it's called that mushrooms not that 

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:57.230
 They are like a little out but good 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:00.109
 is to get used to it or else to catch a 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:02.819
 command of these of hearts 

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:06.480
 Well, I'm going to start explaining 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:10.139
 the consequences in this case 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:12.239
 negative that brings the xbox then 

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:15.359
 then to the nou channel like for example the 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:17.190
 ultimate and some told me what happens 

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:19.650
 with the templates of the ultimate and so 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.530
 they fuck it is worth seeing I wanted to tell you 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.260
 yes, if you want 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:26.060
 that starts again from scratch but 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.970
 making me a template of the series to 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:31.900
 that I started the series 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:35.900
 that day is the Italian league is worth 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:38.660
 start again the series of the the 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.700
 series when climbing the first the first 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:42.770
 chapter how do I open the envelopes and everything or 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:45.620
 if you want directly to happen to me 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:50.030
 make it a week or two doing in 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:52.730
 the equipment and I directly metal the 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:58.730
 episode 2 of the template that I already had 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:04:01.340
 in the at the rally of the ps3 I have 800 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:02.770
 xbox live points that gave me the 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.290
 goal 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:07.930
 they say it's to open envelopes of 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:10.690
 last team I do not know how many are 800 points 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:14.590
 to buy one is to buy yourself a 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:18.100
 about or so from yumbo world and one 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:20.049
 normal I do not know I do not know I think I'm going to 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:22.630
 be in happy hour if you want what 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:25.870
 recorded and I upload if I get something good if 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:27.510
 not because it just depends on how it is 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:30.600
 that day 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:32.880
 and that more than the dlc of the of the 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:34.830
 eurocopa I'm going to buy the end to 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:37.520
 final in summer is worth the expedition mode 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:40.350
 I'm not going to do it, I hope we care 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:42.330
 but the eurocopa if I'm going to do it 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:46.680
 I will buy more or less when it starts 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:50.370
 starts I think on June 13 or 16 and if the 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:52.470
 you are going to have those dates in summer 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:54.420
 more or less the fennel in a channel 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:57.150
 fifa that is not missing be eurocopa by 

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:58.710
 supposed to see positive things 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:02.010
 positive things that I will be able to play 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:03.900
 with the people of xbox like that but not 

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:06.510
 hope you are playing all the time 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:08.670
 with you it's worth because call of duty is 

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:10.770
 One thing is worth, for example, call of duty 

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:12.750
 you can join whenever you want to see it 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:15.150
 when you see me playing modern warfare 3 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:16.800
 or so you can serve without gloves 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:19.160
 sorry, I'm messing 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:22.260
 you can join without any problem 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:25.770
 but I who know fifa is more to play one 

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:27.660
 against one would be like for example 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:29.910
 we put an example not every day it 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:33.570
 connect twenty person the xbox 

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:36.030
 they would be like 20 people 

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:38.070
 they want to play with me or at least 10 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:39.840
 no but they are matches of 20 minutes and 

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:42.450
 of course you can not play with everyone and when 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:45.000
 I connect to the xbox is to record and 

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:47.130
 like in ps3 it's not like we're going with ps3 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.170
 when I connect to the console it's for 

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:51.180
 record or play with friends is worth if I 

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:53.610
 You see I'm in the Cullen, your type 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:55.530
 they are digital I am not always going to put the 

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:59.130
 micro is more does not put the micro of the 

00:05:55.530 --> 00:06:02.430
 xbox a was playing with Ã¡lex the other 

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:05.940
 day and he said put the mic on the list 

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:08.490
 from that of the xbox and I had no idea of 

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:10.940
 put the mic not at the end we just 

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:13.880
 talking about the team script as always 

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:16.430
 well then 

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:19.580
 that's all I wanted to say parts 

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:22.400
 negative rather than positive not having 

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:25.010
 some other positive because it is not the 

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:27.380
 connection that goes better you will not see so many 

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:30.290
 lacquered gameplays 

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:31.970
 and that's it and it's already I think I think it 's 

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:34.720
 all for a people I hope that I have 

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:38.050
 I hope you've been clear 

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:40.270
 by the offer of the xbox the price the 

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:42.790
 gamertag the gamer I do not know if I said it 

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:45.020
 before it is is pirates is worth as the name 

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:47.120
 of the same channel 

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:49.039
 get inspired 2 I will accept everything is good 

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:52.669
 when I have to add some friends 

00:06:49.039 --> 00:06:54.949
 and fill the list I will delete some 

00:06:52.669 --> 00:06:56.659
 are more inactive it is worth not 

00:06:54.949 --> 00:06:59.509
 have connected me that I know in 10 days or 

00:06:56.659 --> 00:07:02.509
 well but not if it's a friend then I'll erase 

00:06:59.509 --> 00:07:04.940
 someone who has never played or who 

00:07:02.509 --> 00:07:07.310
 I have not talked to him and I 'll see and see 

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:10.639
 but you know my gamer is that it is 

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:13.360
 pirate with the xbox no table to me I came out 

00:07:10.639 --> 00:07:16.180
 free but it was a gift 

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:18.129
 what more we have said ultimate in 

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:21.699
 start over again but doing 

00:07:18.129 --> 00:07:23.909
 a template like that of play 3 of the 

00:07:21.699 --> 00:07:23.909
 series 

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:28.520
 it's true 2 versus 2 with a came up we're going 

00:07:26.599 --> 00:07:30.830
 to do another series at the moment is 

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:34.039
 stopped because the best thing is caught the xbox 

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:36.740
 the quiet is not going to sell the ps3 

00:07:34.039 --> 00:07:39.229
 to the best I caught it I know in 

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:42.169
 summer or so you guide more or less have a 

00:07:39.229 --> 00:07:43.879
 little more money and nothing else I hope that 

00:07:42.169 --> 00:07:45.860
 you liked the gameplay what 

00:07:43.879 --> 00:07:49.340
 you have seen and so the next video already 

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:52.729

00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:55.550
 normal comment or a live or ultimate 

00:07:52.729 --> 00:07:58.430
 team as I started as I do not know what to read 

00:07:55.550 --> 00:08:01.219
 this video was just for clarification 

00:07:58.430 --> 00:08:03.080
 that a lot of excitement was mounted about how much 

00:08:01.219 --> 00:08:05.960
 cost that you're going to do now with tiny tim 

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:07.430

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:09.530
 that you liked lx favorites for 

00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:12.430
 that people in the channel at least 

00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:14.770

00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:16.300
