00:00:01.359 --> 00:00:04.240
 the last match that have a long summary is therefore also 

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:07.709
 cambuur and top oss a special duel because on both sides 

00:00:08.499 --> 00:00:12.009
 old keeper as a responsible for the group at cambuur that is the 

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:15.009
 Stanley Menzo and at top Oss for a long time Hans the King 

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:19.310
 by often allowing trainers to play their teams as it used to be like 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:23.330
 that means we have two very defensive teams tonight 

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:24.529
 facing each other 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:27.189
 let's hope that is not the case 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:30.210
 can do well there seems in any case not to want to go into connection with 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.770
 playmaker the sun through van der heijden 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.680
 has recovered from a few gilles debrus hours he can start right away and that goes 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.050
 at the expense of the more defensive eric way 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.230
 jack 2 i'm already starting at top oss because dirk schoofs anyway by one 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:47.570
 muscle injury that only happened during the warming up or by Hans de Koning 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:52.500
 his basic formation at the end so still had to adjust helmond sport plays on 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.500
 us with dutch 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:57.609
 are September 19th 

00:00:57.609 --> 00:01:01.859
 for the final victory of top oss that stands in stark contrast to that 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.740
 good series of cambuur 

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:07.570
 what top gets a good chance here eric week is already sent in depth 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.940
 hold on and then there is the collision merz peter van der flag 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.579
 but the ball goes on the words of the players of top oss 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.940
 not on the dot 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.300
 quekel is through there is contact with van der flag 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.160
 yes you can whistle but that does the referee they visit 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.160
 ultimately not 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:31.050
 fools 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.050
 for space at martine aubry 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:45.510
 forest must nearby brick in the right place 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:48.510
 and broke's free kick 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.280
 and from the very first minute she was actually a very nice captivating 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.280
 match with the ball on the crossbar 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.740
 we are seventh of the season 

00:02:12.179 --> 00:02:14.029
 but then broke 

00:02:14.029 --> 00:02:17.029
 search for witnesses 

00:02:25.609 --> 00:02:27.539
 it seems to continue or not 

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:30.819
 toos lastras he has to tackle driving 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:33.819
 and therefore a justified penalty kick against me 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:39.299
 cor de vos and some difficulty with that 

00:02:43.219 --> 00:02:46.709
 the turn year has all the time to go to the right corner 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:50.029
 cambuur is a unique opportunity to take the lead 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:55.730
 top oss stupidity now the albert i laan on the right he gets the ball with two 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:56.480
 man with him 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:57.859
 but is that promise 

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:01.149
 why is it another top oss 

00:03:01.149 --> 00:03:04.149
 excellent goal if service must have separate team 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:09.800
 it is against the ratio but still this is a very nice action by 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:11.009
 through the sande head 

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:13.699
 we must break with brooks and with rustberg 

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:15.339
 without the two 

00:03:15.339 --> 00:03:18.339
 and then ibo bumps into the far corner tomorrow 

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:22.479
 He is therefore not included in that series of photos, but he does have time to rest 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:26.659
 from leeuwarden 

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:29.659
 after all, forest also leads with 2 0 

00:03:30.309 --> 00:03:32.099
 must also wakkie with brabant asos 

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:33.989
 the collision this is a violation 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:36.989
 but what does that referee do 

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:41.379
 no penalty on top oss 

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:46.919
 ten young referee from Hoofddorp so not good because this is absolute 

00:03:46.919 --> 00:03:48.279
 penalty 

00:03:48.279 --> 00:03:50.099
 French king you are even less 

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:53.099
 to invite to his birthday party 

00:03:56.639 --> 00:03:59.639
 ball badly concealed 

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:02.529
 now stands behind 

00:04:02.529 --> 00:04:05.529
 marti 

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:09.849
 in the second instance 

00:04:11.969 --> 00:04:14.969
 he is therefore fit again sander van der meadow where is that also sharp 

00:04:18.969 --> 00:04:22.539
 has won a Haarlem fortune fortune three times in a row 

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:23.919
 rbc 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:27.360
 we went now have to go home with top oss 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:28.729
 from the drive 

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:30.809
 brookmans 

00:04:30.809 --> 00:04:33.809
 men outside 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:37.909
 the ball from the heath 

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:40.909
 no no happy game played 

00:04:43.819 --> 00:04:46.819
 paul beekmans 

00:05:06.099 --> 00:05:08.819
 now got the impression that at least that is the judgment of the arbitrator 

00:05:08.819 --> 00:05:11.819
 and another penalty news will run 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:20.849
 second penalty in this match 

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:22.650
 and for the second time 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:25.650
 unique opportunity from eleven meters the cammeleur not exploited 

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:30.639
 left the casillas without a chance 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.729
 the queen menzo were the verbal 

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:42.710
 an altercation about the side 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:45.710
 and then there is football again 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:55.740
 and yet everything has to survive with a man less but still 

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:58.740
 always with that 2 0 lead 

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:09.919
 that top ox also won in this last season 

00:06:09.919 --> 00:06:12.529
 then with the two in two goals from erik quekel 

00:06:12.529 --> 00:06:15.529
 not with top oss with 2 0 

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:24.259
 what his pointed failures 

00:06:24.259 --> 00:06:27.089
 short the one 

00:06:27.089 --> 00:06:28.330
 a cross from the side 

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:31.330
 jans the end foot 

00:06:54.279 --> 00:06:57.409
 and he scored the winning one against rbc last week 

00:06:57.409 --> 00:07:00.460
 a sporty just ahead of time the 2 2 against top oss 

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:03.460
 Christian again good for three points 

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:19.430
 the man of the match referee
