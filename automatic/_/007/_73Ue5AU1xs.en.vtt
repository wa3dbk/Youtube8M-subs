the spreadsheet and different analysis
that<00:00:28.289> I've<00:00:28.470> done<00:00:29.449> so<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:30.570> purpose<00:00:30.869> of<00:00:31.050> the

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
that I've done so the purpose of the

that I've done so the purpose of the
spreadsheet<00:00:31.679> is<00:00:31.890> to<00:00:32.130> try<00:00:32.340> and<00:00:32.369> model<00:00:32.700> the

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
spreadsheet is to try and model the

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.110 
spreadsheet is to try and model the
damage<00:00:33.360> that<00:00:33.390> each<00:00:33.840> champion<00:00:34.170> does<00:00:34.559> over<00:00:34.800> time

there's<00:00:36.120> a<00:00:36.180> lot<00:00:36.360> of<00:00:36.390> different<00:00:36.540> ways<00:00:36.930> to

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
there's a lot of different ways to

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.380 
there's a lot of different ways to
approximate<00:00:37.590> dps<00:00:37.980> and<00:00:38.250> each<00:00:38.969> has<00:00:39.000> their<00:00:39.239> own

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
approximate dps and each has their own
