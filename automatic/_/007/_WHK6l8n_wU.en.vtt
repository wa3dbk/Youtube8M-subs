installing this on to the phone is

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.390 
installing this on to the phone is
rather<00:01:22.140> cumbersome<00:01:22.799> so<00:01:23.009> if<00:01:23.070> you're<00:01:23.220> a<00:01:23.250> person

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400

rather cumbersome so if you're a person
that<00:01:23.580> likes<00:01:23.820> to<00:01:23.939> switch<00:01:24.240> out<00:01:24.420> cases<00:01:24.840> this

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
that likes to switch out cases this

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.050 
that likes to switch out cases this
might<00:01:25.170> not<00:01:25.320> be<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.500> one<00:01:25.740> for<00:01:25.950> you<00:01:26.100> so<00:01:26.369> what<00:01:27.000> you

volume up and down in the power button
and<00:02:02.460> I<00:02:02.880> do<00:02:02.939> love<00:02:03.240> what<00:02:03.360> they've<00:02:03.479> done<00:02:03.659> here<00:02:03.719> so

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
and I do love what they've done here so

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.380 
and I do love what they've done here so
because<00:02:04.829> the<00:02:04.920> plastic<00:02:05.340> is<00:02:05.399> rather<00:02:05.880> thick<00:02:06.240> on

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
because the plastic is rather thick on

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.690 
because the plastic is rather thick on
these<00:02:06.570> sides<00:02:06.869> in<00:02:07.290> order<00:02:07.950> to<00:02:08.280> prevent

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
these sides in order to prevent

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.160 
these sides in order to prevent
resistance<00:02:09.239> with<00:02:09.479> the<00:02:09.599> plastic<00:02:09.810> and<00:02:10.080> your

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
fingers they actually cut it out ver

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
in that groove you don't get any

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.950 
in that groove you don't get any
resistance<00:02:30.920> at<00:02:31.070> all<00:02:31.160> from<00:02:31.310> the<00:02:31.430> plastic<00:02:31.960> now

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:32.960

the whole screen itself is left

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.460 
the whole screen itself is left
untouched<00:02:34.640> so<00:02:35.090> you<00:02:35.150> have<00:02:35.420> access<00:02:36.170> to<00:02:36.200> the

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
power button and then the capacitive

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.690 
power button and then the capacitive
buttons<00:02:38.450> on<00:02:38.840> the<00:02:38.930> sides<00:02:39.170> the<00:02:39.950> top<00:02:40.190> works<00:02:40.490> fine

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
buttons on the sides the top works fine

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.460 
buttons on the sides the top works fine
as<00:02:40.910> well<00:02:41.060> and<00:02:41.660> I<00:02:41.720> do<00:02:41.780> have<00:02:41.960> a<00:02:42.050> screen<00:02:42.320> protector

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
as well and I do have a screen protector

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:43.960 
as well and I do have a screen protector
on<00:02:42.890> here<00:02:43.130> you<00:02:43.250> have<00:02:43.400> to<00:02:43.550> worry<00:02:43.730> about<00:02:43.850> that

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
on here you have to worry about that

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.660 
on here you have to worry about that
bubbling<00:02:44.480> up<00:02:44.660> at<00:02:44.780> all<00:02:45.040> it<00:02:46.040> has<00:02:46.160> a<00:02:46.190> nice<00:02:46.370> lay<00:02:46.580> on

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
bubbling up at all it has a nice lay on

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:47.980 
bubbling up at all it has a nice lay on
the<00:02:46.760> table<00:02:46.790> design<00:02:47.300> as<00:02:47.510> you<00:02:47.600> can<00:02:47.720> see<00:02:47.870> it's

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:47.990 
the table design as you can see it's

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:49.690 
the table design as you can see it's
very<00:02:48.230> small<00:02:48.590> just<00:02:48.980> just<00:02:49.130> slightly<00:02:49.430> on<00:02:49.670> the

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
very small just just slightly on the

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.699 
very small just just slightly on the
table<00:02:50.030> design<00:02:50.330> but<00:02:50.930> it<00:02:51.050> will<00:02:51.230> get<00:02:51.380> the<00:02:51.530> job

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
table design but it will get the job

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:53.470 
table design but it will get the job
done<00:02:51.770> so<00:02:52.250> if<00:02:52.310> you<00:02:52.430> replace<00:02:52.790> the<00:02:52.820> screen<00:02:53.209> side

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
done so if you replace the screen side

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:54.970 
done so if you replace the screen side
down<00:02:53.750> you<00:02:54.290> don't<00:02:54.440> have<00:02:54.530> to<00:02:54.590> worry<00:02:54.740> about<00:02:54.830> the

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
down you don't have to worry about the

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.760 
down you don't have to worry about the
screen<00:02:55.220> scratching<00:02:55.760> up<00:02:56.350> at<00:02:57.350> the<00:02:57.470> bottom<00:02:57.709> of

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
the device you do have SGPS branding so

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.630 
the device you do have SGPS branding so
you<00:02:59.900> can<00:03:00.020> see<00:03:00.110> says<00:03:00.290> linear<00:03:00.680> and<00:03:00.890> then<00:03:01.459> you<00:03:01.550> do

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
you can see says linear and then you do

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.610 
you can see says linear and then you do
have<00:03:01.760> a<00:03:01.820> cutout<00:03:02.030> for<00:03:02.420> the<00:03:02.480> speaker<00:03:03.290> which

the bottom you do have to cut outs one
is<00:03:08.270> for<00:03:08.420> the<00:03:08.450> micro<00:03:08.750> USB<00:03:09.140> charging<00:03:09.500> port<00:03:09.860> which

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
is for the micro USB charging port which

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.160 
is for the micro USB charging port which
is<00:03:10.130> ample<00:03:10.580> and<00:03:10.700> large<00:03:10.910> so<00:03:11.300> I've<00:03:11.540> had<00:03:11.690> no<00:03:11.870> issues

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
is ample and large so I've had no issues

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:13.990 
is ample and large so I've had no issues
with<00:03:12.230> my<00:03:12.410> chargers<00:03:12.890> and<00:03:13.130> the<00:03:13.670> secondary

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
with my chargers and the secondary

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.900 
with my chargers and the secondary
microphone<00:03:14.209> cutout<00:03:14.780> works<00:03:14.959> just<00:03:15.170> fine<00:03:15.410> and

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
microphone cutout works just fine and

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:17.949 
microphone cutout works just fine and
finally<00:03:16.910> at<00:03:17.000> the<00:03:17.030> top<00:03:17.269> you<00:03:17.420> do<00:03:17.540> have<00:03:17.690> three

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 
finally at the top you do have three

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:19.240 
finally at the top you do have three
separate<00:03:18.260> cut<00:03:18.440> out<00:03:18.560> to<00:03:18.739> one<00:03:18.890> ish<00:03:18.980> for<00:03:19.160> the

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
separate cut out to one ish for the

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.460 
separate cut out to one ish for the
antenna<00:03:19.610> jack<00:03:19.880> one<00:03:20.780> is<00:03:20.900> for<00:03:21.080> the<00:03:21.110> main

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 
antenna jack one is for the main

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:23.500 
antenna jack one is for the main
microphone<00:03:21.709> fed<00:03:22.370> no<00:03:22.519> issues<00:03:22.820> with<00:03:22.970> that<00:03:23.030> and

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
microphone fed no issues with that and

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:25.240 
microphone fed no issues with that and
then<00:03:23.989> you<00:03:24.110> have<00:03:24.230> the<00:03:24.350> headphone<00:03:24.739> jack<00:03:24.769> which

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
then you have the headphone jack which

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:26.620 
then you have the headphone jack which
is<00:03:25.400> cut<00:03:25.610> out<00:03:25.640> right<00:03:25.880> here<00:03:26.090> the<00:03:26.239> back<00:03:26.420> as<00:03:26.600> well

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630 
is cut out right here the back as well

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:29.080 
is cut out right here the back as well
so<00:03:27.410> you<00:03:27.500> can<00:03:27.620> use<00:03:27.950> that<00:03:28.160> with<00:03:28.519> some<00:03:28.730> larger

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
so you can use that with some larger

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.509 
so you can use that with some larger
headphones<00:03:29.660> as<00:03:29.840> well<00:03:30.130> now<00:03:31.130> I<00:03:31.160> do<00:03:31.280> have<00:03:31.370> one

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:31.519 
headphones as well now I do have one

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:33.009 
headphones as well now I do have one
minor<00:03:31.910> annoyance<00:03:32.330> that<00:03:32.390> I<00:03:32.480> wanted<00:03:32.750> to<00:03:32.810> point

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:33.019 
minor annoyance that I wanted to point

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:35.170 
minor annoyance that I wanted to point
out<00:03:33.170> regarding<00:03:33.650> the<00:03:33.800> case<00:03:34.010> while<00:03:34.760> these<00:03:34.940> sides

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
out regarding the case while these sides

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.540 
out regarding the case while these sides
are<00:03:35.420> super<00:03:36.050> tight<00:03:36.230> and<00:03:36.500> super<00:03:36.860> salty<00:03:37.340> held

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:37.550 
are super tight and super salty held

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:39.460 
are super tight and super salty held
together<00:03:37.730> by<00:03:38.030> that<00:03:38.360> Mon<00:03:38.750> mechanism<00:03:39.320> right

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470 
together by that Mon mechanism right

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:41.080 
together by that Mon mechanism right
there<00:03:39.739> the<00:03:40.190> back<00:03:40.370> has<00:03:40.580> nothing<00:03:40.910> that<00:03:41.000> really

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
there the back has nothing that really

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:42.820 
there the back has nothing that really
holds<00:03:41.390> into<00:03:41.720> place<00:03:41.930> so<00:03:42.140> it<00:03:42.260> does<00:03:42.440> tend<00:03:42.709> to

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:42.830 
holds into place so it does tend to

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:44.710 
holds into place so it does tend to
shake<00:03:43.340> in<00:03:43.549> there<00:03:43.670> just<00:03:43.880> a<00:03:44.060> little<00:03:44.299> bit<00:03:44.420> as<00:03:44.570> you

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 
shake in there just a little bit as you

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.170 
shake in there just a little bit as you
can<00:03:44.870> see<00:03:45.310> so<00:03:46.310> while<00:03:46.489> it<00:03:46.580> doesn't<00:03:46.730> affect<00:03:47.060> a

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
can see so while it doesn't affect a

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:48.580 
can see so while it doesn't affect a
user<00:03:47.390> to<00:03:47.510> the<00:03:47.690> case<00:03:47.870> it's<00:03:48.140> just<00:03:48.290> something

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590 
user to the case it's just something

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:50.590 
user to the case it's just something
that's<00:03:48.620> annoying<00:03:49.010> so<00:03:49.400> whenever<00:03:50.150> I'm<00:03:50.269> holding

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:50.600 
that's annoying so whenever I'm holding

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.150 
that's annoying so whenever I'm holding
the<00:03:50.690> case<00:03:50.900> and<00:03:51.170> doing<00:03:51.470> something<00:03:51.739> on<00:03:51.830> my<00:03:51.950> phone

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160 
the case and doing something on my phone

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.190 
the case and doing something on my phone
I<00:03:52.430> usually<00:03:52.700> hear<00:03:53.150> that<00:03:53.360> rattle<00:03:53.720> up<00:03:53.840> and<00:03:53.989> down

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:54.200 
I usually hear that rattle up and down

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.320 
I usually hear that rattle up and down
and<00:03:54.500> it's<00:03:54.590> just<00:03:54.860> a<00:03:55.100> little<00:03:55.430> bit<00:03:55.610> annoying<00:03:55.880> so

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:56.330 
and it's just a little bit annoying so

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:57.820 
and it's just a little bit annoying so
it<00:03:56.720> doesn't<00:03:56.959> really<00:03:57.049> affect<00:03:57.170> the<00:03:57.440> usage<00:03:57.769> of

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:57.830 
it doesn't really affect the usage of

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:59.140 
it doesn't really affect the usage of
the<00:03:57.980> case<00:03:58.190> but<00:03:58.519> it's<00:03:58.640> just<00:03:58.790> something<00:03:59.120> I

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150 
the case but it's just something I

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.240 
the case but it's just something I
wanted<00:03:59.390> to<00:03:59.480> point<00:03:59.690> out<00:03:59.930> i<00:03:59.959> just<00:04:00.290> wish<00:04:00.500> that<00:04:00.530> the

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.250 
wanted to point out i just wish that the

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:02.530 
wanted to point out i just wish that the
case<00:04:01.400> was<00:04:01.549> built<00:04:01.790> a<00:04:01.880> little<00:04:02.030> bit<00:04:02.239> better<00:04:02.450> just

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.540 
case was built a little bit better just

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.210 
case was built a little bit better just
so<00:04:02.930> that<00:04:03.080> there<00:04:03.200> was<00:04:03.290> a<00:04:03.320> groove<00:04:03.620> around<00:04:03.799> here

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.220 
so that there was a groove around here

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.640 
so that there was a groove around here
where<00:04:04.700> the<00:04:04.820> backplate<00:04:05.269> could<00:04:05.450> hold<00:04:05.989> on<00:04:06.170> to<00:04:06.320> and

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650 
where the backplate could hold on to and

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:10.030 
where the backplate could hold on to and
then<00:04:06.860> it<00:04:06.980> would<00:04:07.160> prevent<00:04:07.430> that<00:04:07.610> readily<00:04:09.040> so

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 
then it would prevent that readily so

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:11.949 
then it would prevent that readily so
being<00:04:10.340> in<00:04:10.459> all<00:04:10.670> white<00:04:10.910> and<00:04:10.970> glossy<00:04:11.780> plastic

being in all white and glossy plastic

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:14.710 
being in all white and glossy plastic
you<00:04:12.650> will<00:04:12.860> have<00:04:13.100> some<00:04:13.310> cons<00:04:13.790> to<00:04:14.120> it<00:04:14.150> first<00:04:14.570> of

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720 
you will have some cons to it first of

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.659 
you will have some cons to it first of
all<00:04:14.840> i<00:04:15.080> can<00:04:15.470> catch<00:04:15.650> it<00:04:15.860> with<00:04:16.010> the<00:04:16.040> light<00:04:16.430> you

00:04:16.659 --> 00:04:16.669 
all i can catch it with the light you

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:17.979 
all i can catch it with the light you
can<00:04:16.790> see<00:04:16.850> that<00:04:17.000> it<00:04:17.180> does<00:04:17.330> pick<00:04:17.600> up<00:04:17.720> a<00:04:17.810> lot<00:04:17.930> of

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:17.989 
can see that it does pick up a lot of

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:20.380 
can see that it does pick up a lot of
fingerprints<00:04:18.680> and<00:04:18.799> scratches<00:04:19.090> now<00:04:20.090> because

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:20.390 
fingerprints and scratches now because

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:21.640 
fingerprints and scratches now because
this<00:04:20.479> is<00:04:20.599> a<00:04:20.690> white<00:04:20.900> model<00:04:21.289> you<00:04:21.349> don't<00:04:21.560> really

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:21.650 
this is a white model you don't really

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:23.469 
this is a white model you don't really
tend<00:04:21.890> to<00:04:22.039> see<00:04:22.250> this<00:04:22.400> much<00:04:22.610> unless<00:04:22.970> you<00:04:23.150> catch

00:04:23.469 --> 00:04:23.479 
tend to see this much unless you catch

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:25.240 
tend to see this much unless you catch
it<00:04:23.690> with<00:04:23.810> the<00:04:23.840> light<00:04:24.080> just<00:04:24.320> right

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.250 
it with the light just right

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:26.380 
it with the light just right
if<00:04:25.340> you<00:04:25.400> were<00:04:25.520> to<00:04:25.610> pick<00:04:25.700> up<00:04:25.880> some<00:04:26.060> of<00:04:26.150> the<00:04:26.210> other

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:26.390 
if you were to pick up some of the other

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:28.060 
if you were to pick up some of the other
colors<00:04:26.660> you<00:04:26.930> will<00:04:27.080> see<00:04:27.290> those<00:04:27.440> more<00:04:27.680> easily

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.070 
colors you will see those more easily

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:30.460 
colors you will see those more easily
and<00:04:28.190> more<00:04:28.310> visibly<00:04:28.960> now<00:04:29.960> because<00:04:30.230> it<00:04:30.350> is

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:30.470 
and more visibly now because it is

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:32.350 
and more visibly now because it is
glossy<00:04:30.770> it<00:04:31.070> does<00:04:31.280> team<00:04:31.580> to<00:04:31.760> get<00:04:32.030> some<00:04:32.210> of<00:04:32.240> the

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 
glossy it does team to get some of the

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:33.850 
glossy it does team to get some of the
grease<00:04:32.570> on<00:04:32.780> your<00:04:32.810> hands<00:04:33.140> which<00:04:33.350> means<00:04:33.620> that

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:33.860 
grease on your hands which means that

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:35.200 
grease on your hands which means that
this<00:04:34.010> is<00:04:34.250> a<00:04:34.280> little<00:04:34.490> bit<00:04:34.580> more<00:04:34.700> slippery<00:04:35.090> than

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.210 
this is a little bit more slippery than

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:38.440 
this is a little bit more slippery than
I'd<00:04:35.360> like<00:04:35.420> it<00:04:35.660> to<00:04:35.780> be<00:04:35.920> it's<00:04:36.920> not<00:04:37.100> as<00:04:37.370> grippy<00:04:38.330> as

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:38.450 
I'd like it to be it's not as grippy as

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:40.210 
I'd like it to be it's not as grippy as
a<00:04:38.480> matte<00:04:38.810> finish<00:04:39.260> and<00:04:39.440> those<00:04:39.920> are<00:04:40.040> the<00:04:40.130> ones

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:40.220 
a matte finish and those are the ones

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:41.710 
a matte finish and those are the ones
that<00:04:40.340> I<00:04:40.460> prefer<00:04:40.730> obviously<00:04:41.180> just<00:04:41.450> because<00:04:41.690> a

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:41.720 
that I prefer obviously just because a

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.840 
that I prefer obviously just because a
little<00:04:41.900> bit<00:04:41.990> more<00:04:42.080> comfortable<00:04:42.560> to<00:04:42.680> hold<00:04:42.850> but

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:43.850 
little bit more comfortable to hold but

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:45.640 
little bit more comfortable to hold but
on<00:04:43.940> the<00:04:44.090> positive<00:04:44.270> side<00:04:44.600> this<00:04:44.990> is<00:04:45.050> a<00:04:45.230> beautiful

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:45.650 
on the positive side this is a beautiful

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:47.920 
on the positive side this is a beautiful
case<00:04:46.160> so<00:04:46.370> it's<00:04:46.520> nice<00:04:46.730> and<00:04:46.760> shiny<00:04:47.360> so<00:04:47.720> you<00:04:47.810> can

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:47.930 
case so it's nice and shiny so you can

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:49.690 
case so it's nice and shiny so you can
see<00:04:48.050> it's<00:04:48.170> it<00:04:48.590> looks<00:04:48.650> pretty<00:04:48.890> clean<00:04:49.340> unless

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:49.700 
see it's it looks pretty clean unless

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:50.800 
see it's it looks pretty clean unless
you<00:04:49.970> really<00:04:50.150> want<00:04:50.270> to<00:04:50.510> look<00:04:50.630> at<00:04:50.720> the

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:50.810 
you really want to look at the

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:53.620 
you really want to look at the
fingerprints<00:04:51.850> and<00:04:52.850> I'm<00:04:53.000> over<00:04:53.270> I'm<00:04:53.420> pretty

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:53.630 
fingerprints and I'm over I'm pretty

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:55.090 
fingerprints and I'm over I'm pretty
pleased<00:04:53.930> with<00:04:53.960> the<00:04:54.260> actual<00:04:54.560> looks<00:04:54.890> of<00:04:55.010> the

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:55.100 
pleased with the actual looks of the

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:56.980 
pleased with the actual looks of the
case<00:04:55.310> but<00:04:55.700> the<00:04:55.850> case<00:04:56.030> itself<00:04:56.330> is<00:04:56.480> enjoy<00:04:56.810> the

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:56.990 
case but the case itself is enjoy the

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:58.510 
case but the case itself is enjoy the
whole<00:04:57.170> just<00:04:57.530> because<00:04:57.800> it<00:04:57.919> has<00:04:58.040> these<00:04:58.220> cutouts

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:58.520 
whole just because it has these cutouts

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.010 
whole just because it has these cutouts
right<00:04:58.880> here<00:04:59.090> that<00:04:59.240> I<00:04:59.270> mentioned<00:04:59.570> so<00:04:59.870> your

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.020 
right here that I mentioned so your

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:02.470 
right here that I mentioned so your
fingers<00:05:00.380> rest<00:05:00.650> in<00:05:00.860> there<00:05:01.250> very<00:05:01.280> nicely<00:05:01.760> it's

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:02.480 
fingers rest in there very nicely it's

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.390 
fingers rest in there very nicely it's
very<00:05:02.630> comfortable<00:05:03.020> hold<00:05:03.380> it's<00:05:03.800> not<00:05:03.980> too<00:05:04.160> bulky

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:04.400 
very comfortable hold it's not too bulky

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.220 
very comfortable hold it's not too bulky
but<00:05:04.850> at<00:05:04.940> the<00:05:05.000> same<00:05:05.150> time<00:05:05.360> it's<00:05:05.570> not<00:05:05.780> too<00:05:06.020> late

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:06.230 
but at the same time it's not too late

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:08.409 
but at the same time it's not too late
way<00:05:06.500> either<00:05:06.740> it's<00:05:07.400> just<00:05:07.700> at<00:05:07.820> the<00:05:07.940> perfect

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:08.419 
way either it's just at the perfect

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:11.080 
way either it's just at the perfect
weight<00:05:08.780> and<00:05:09.050> dimensions<00:05:09.380> and<00:05:10.160> it's<00:05:10.970> probably

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:11.090 
weight and dimensions and it's probably

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:12.550 
weight and dimensions and it's probably
one<00:05:11.300> of<00:05:11.330> the<00:05:11.450> nicer<00:05:11.750> cases<00:05:12.140> that<00:05:12.260> I've<00:05:12.380> held

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:12.560 
one of the nicer cases that I've held

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.650 
one of the nicer cases that I've held
and<00:05:12.800> it's<00:05:12.890> very<00:05:13.100> comfortable<00:05:13.520> slides<00:05:14.270> in<00:05:14.540> and

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:14.660 
and it's very comfortable slides in and

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:16.900 
and it's very comfortable slides in and
out<00:05:14.750> of<00:05:14.810> your<00:05:14.990> pocket<00:05:15.380> very<00:05:15.620> easily<00:05:15.860> and<00:05:16.340> in

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:16.910 
out of your pocket very easily and in

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:18.310 
out of your pocket very easily and in
terms<00:05:17.060> of<00:05:17.240> protection<00:05:17.720> you<00:05:17.750> will<00:05:17.990> get<00:05:18.140> some

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:18.320 
terms of protection you will get some

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:19.780 
terms of protection you will get some
pretty<00:05:18.500> decent<00:05:18.680> protection<00:05:19.280> out<00:05:19.370> of<00:05:19.490> it<00:05:19.580> just

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:19.790 
pretty decent protection out of it just

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:22.180 
pretty decent protection out of it just
because<00:05:20.000> these<00:05:20.360> sides<00:05:20.690> all<00:05:21.110> around<00:05:21.770> here<00:05:22.010> are

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:22.190 
because these sides all around here are

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:24.100 
because these sides all around here are
thicker<00:05:22.490> than<00:05:22.700> the<00:05:22.760> middle<00:05:23.090> so<00:05:23.390> they<00:05:23.840> seem<00:05:24.080> to

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:24.110 
thicker than the middle so they seem to

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:25.930 
thicker than the middle so they seem to
be<00:05:24.260> like<00:05:24.500> a<00:05:24.530> reinforced<00:05:25.220> bumper<00:05:25.610> that<00:05:25.790> will

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:25.940 
be like a reinforced bumper that will

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:28.390 
be like a reinforced bumper that will
protect<00:05:26.090> from<00:05:26.419> any<00:05:26.540> potential<00:05:27.200> damage<00:05:27.800> the

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:28.400 
protect from any potential damage the

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:29.920 
protect from any potential damage the
back<00:05:28.580> of<00:05:28.730> stuff<00:05:28.910> is<00:05:29.030> rather<00:05:29.210> flimsy<00:05:29.570> like<00:05:29.900> I

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:29.930 
back of stuff is rather flimsy like I

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:31.300 
back of stuff is rather flimsy like I
said<00:05:30.260> so<00:05:30.440> I<00:05:30.470> don't<00:05:30.680> really<00:05:30.800> see<00:05:30.890> us<00:05:31.070> adding

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:31.310 
said so I don't really see us adding

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:33.400 
said so I don't really see us adding
much<00:05:31.580> protection<00:05:31.970> it's<00:05:32.690> really<00:05:32.930> just<00:05:33.050> a<00:05:33.200> cover

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:33.410 
much protection it's really just a cover

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:34.620 
much protection it's really just a cover
at<00:05:33.560> the<00:05:33.590> back<00:05:33.770> and<00:05:33.800> protect<00:05:34.250> from<00:05:34.490> scratches

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:34.630 
at the back and protect from scratches

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:37.030 
at the back and protect from scratches
but<00:05:35.630> overall<00:05:35.990> is<00:05:36.200> a<00:05:36.260> daily<00:05:36.560> case<00:05:36.800> it's

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:37.040 
but overall is a daily case it's

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:39.909 
but overall is a daily case it's
definitely<00:05:37.550> a<00:05:37.580> good<00:05:37.850> one<00:05:38.229> it<00:05:39.229> will<00:05:39.410> offer<00:05:39.590> good

00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:39.919 
definitely a good one it will offer good

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:42.340 
definitely a good one it will offer good
protection<00:05:40.300> stylish<00:05:41.300> and<00:05:41.570> other<00:05:42.050> than<00:05:42.260> those
