 once the dough ball is ready 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.800
 you put it on a plate that you

 bring back for a few moments 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.640
 this way to prevent the onion from 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.640

 you take the dough out of the fridge 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.970
 then you will spread it out on a plane 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.970
