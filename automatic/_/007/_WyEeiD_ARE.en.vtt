00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:08.839 

we<00:00:07.290> found<00:00:07.560> a<00:00:07.649> two<00:00:07.799> point<00:00:08.010> perspective<00:00:08.040> just

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
we found a two point perspective just

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:10.879 
we found a two point perspective just
over<00:00:09.090> two<00:00:09.240> years<00:00:09.269> ago<00:00:09.719> and<00:00:09.990> really<00:00:10.530> our<00:00:10.679> main

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
over two years ago and really our main

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.339 
over two years ago and really our main
passions<00:00:11.460> are<00:00:11.820> the<00:00:12.509> environment<00:00:13.019> and

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
passions are the environment and

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.289 
passions are the environment and
high-quality<00:00:13.860> design<00:00:14.280> so<00:00:14.790> it's<00:00:14.969> combining

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
high-quality design so it's combining

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.029 
high-quality design so it's combining
those<00:00:15.480> two<00:00:15.540> things<00:00:15.839> that<00:00:16.199> seem<00:00:16.440> like<00:00:16.590> that<00:00:16.800> a

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
those two things that seem like that a

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:18.410 
those two things that seem like that a
good<00:00:17.460> combination<00:00:17.670> for<00:00:17.970> starting<00:00:18.300> our

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
good combination for starting our

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.590 
good combination for starting our
architectural<00:00:18.840> and<00:00:19.080> furniture<00:00:19.470> design<00:00:19.710> firm

architectural and furniture design firm

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.630 
architectural and furniture design firm
we<00:00:21.600> like<00:00:21.750> to<00:00:21.840> think<00:00:21.900> of<00:00:22.279> furnitures<00:00:23.279> actually

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
we like to think of furnitures actually

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.000 
we like to think of furnitures actually
small<00:00:23.939> buildings<00:00:24.359> because<00:00:25.260> the<00:00:25.650> way<00:00:25.800> their

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
small buildings because the way their

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.620 
small buildings because the way their
detail<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.550> way<00:00:26.640> to<00:00:26.699> constructed<00:00:27.269> and<00:00:27.390> design

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
detail the way to constructed and design

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.679 
detail the way to constructed and design
is<00:00:27.840> basically<00:00:28.260> the<00:00:28.410> same<00:00:28.439> as<00:00:28.650> a<00:00:29.189> building<00:00:29.689> the

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
is basically the same as a building the

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:31.999 
is basically the same as a building the
main<00:00:30.869> difference<00:00:30.900> is<00:00:31.320> that<00:00:31.380> they're<00:00:31.830> done<00:00:31.980> a

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
main difference is that they're done a

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.020 
main difference is that they're done a
lot<00:00:32.219> faster<00:00:32.399> and<00:00:32.759> a<00:00:33.180> lot<00:00:33.270> less<00:00:33.329> ecclesia<00:00:35.030> we

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
lot faster and a lot less ecclesia we

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.819 
lot faster and a lot less ecclesia we
have<00:00:36.210> pretty<00:00:36.540> much<00:00:36.600> total<00:00:37.050> control<00:00:37.320> over<00:00:37.410> the

have pretty much total control over the

find us because they're looking for an
echo<00:01:06.420> from<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.720> architect<00:01:06.990> so<00:01:07.590> that's<00:01:07.920> a

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
echo from the architect so that's a

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.340 
echo from the architect so that's a
great<00:01:08.159> fit<00:01:08.520> for<00:01:08.700> our<00:01:08.850> skills<00:01:09.420> because<00:01:09.840> it's

was like on the west coast lived out

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.719 
was like on the west coast lived out
there<00:01:33.810> for<00:01:34.020> about<00:01:34.110> five<00:01:34.380> years<00:01:34.619> and<00:01:34.770> got<00:01:35.549> a<00:01:35.579> lot

there for about five years and got a lot

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.870 
there for about five years and got a lot
of<00:01:35.759> experience<00:01:36.270> in<00:01:37.250> especially<00:01:38.250> green<00:01:38.579> design

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
of experience in especially green design

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.310 
of experience in especially green design
environmental<00:01:39.630> design<00:01:39.869> being<00:01:40.229> in

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
environmental design being in

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.880 
environmental design being in
California's<00:01:40.950> state<00:01:41.670> mandates<00:01:42.380> are<00:01:43.380> a<00:01:43.439> lot

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
California's state mandates are a lot

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.740 
California's state mandates are a lot
more<00:01:43.920> strict<00:01:44.430> than<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:45.060> rest<00:01:45.240> of<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:45.420> country

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
more strict than the rest of the country

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.780 
more strict than the rest of the country
so<00:01:46.470> that<00:01:46.500> was<00:01:46.860> I<00:01:47.130> think<00:01:47.520> what<00:01:47.670> really

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
so that was I think what really

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.880 
so that was I think what really
kick-started<00:01:48.090> our<00:01:48.600> our<00:01:49.320> green<00:01:49.649> and

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
kick-started our our green and

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.520 
kick-started our our green and
sustainable<00:01:50.899> initiative<00:01:51.899> I<00:01:52.020> guess<00:01:52.170> you'd<00:01:52.320> say

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
sustainable initiative I guess you'd say

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:53.870 
sustainable initiative I guess you'd say
we<00:01:52.740> knew<00:01:52.890> we<00:01:53.040> wanted<00:01:53.070> to<00:01:53.310> be<00:01:53.430> a<00:01:53.460> little<00:01:53.640> closer

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
we knew we wanted to be a little closer

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.120 
we knew we wanted to be a little closer

was run by a competition from the
village<00:03:38.859> to<00:03:38.890> design<00:03:39.700> an<00:03:39.880> environmentally

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
village to design an environmentally

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.410 
village to design an environmentally
friendly<00:03:41.079> home<00:03:41.260> so<00:03:42.040> we<00:03:42.220> took<00:03:42.400> it<00:03:42.459> to<00:03:42.700> the<00:03:42.730> to

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420 
friendly home so we took it to the to

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.300 
friendly home so we took it to the to
the<00:03:43.510> extreme<00:03:43.810> level<00:03:44.140> and<00:03:44.350> thought<00:03:45.100> you<00:03:45.130> know

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
the extreme level and thought you know

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.220 
the extreme level and thought you know
why<00:03:45.489> not<00:03:45.519> do<00:03:45.820> it<00:03:45.850> zero<00:03:46.239> energy<00:03:46.450> this<00:03:46.989> will<00:03:47.109> be

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
why not do it zero energy this will be

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.050 
why not do it zero energy this will be
our<00:03:47.260> first<00:03:47.500> project<00:03:47.799> that's<00:03:48.280> we<00:03:48.459> platinum<00:03:48.700> and

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
our first project that's we platinum and

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.330 
our first project that's we platinum and
platinum<00:03:49.840> is<00:03:49.930> difficult<00:03:50.350> to<00:03:50.470> achieve<00:03:50.560> that

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
platinum is difficult to achieve that

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.039 
platinum is difficult to achieve that
we're<00:03:51.549> excited<00:03:51.760> about<00:03:52.060> the<00:03:52.180> project<00:03:52.359> of<00:03:52.840> being

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:53.049 
we're excited about the project of being

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:55.140 
we're excited about the project of being
able<00:03:53.140> to<00:03:53.290> achieve<00:03:53.410> that<00:03:53.739> level<00:03:53.920> we<00:03:54.880> always

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
able to achieve that level we always

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:56.430 
able to achieve that level we always
knew<00:03:55.329> at<00:03:55.450> some<00:03:55.600> point<00:03:55.840> we<00:03:56.019> wanted<00:03:56.230> to<00:03:56.260> start

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440 
knew at some point we wanted to start

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.210 
knew at some point we wanted to start
