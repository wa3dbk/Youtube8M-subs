00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:12.340
 hello pasta for is it 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:15.250
 deities just eat a lot 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:18.910
 differently with different sauces here is one of 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:21.870
 them we are today and made of reasons 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:21.870
 several cloves of garlic 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.670
 a little chili pepper 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:29.410
 I just have it now but no more 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:35.800
 the principle of this is enough, especially since I 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:36.850
 seed it is used to cut 1 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:46.440
 eggplant 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:52.389
 dice centimeter a couple of bulbs 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:55.899
 also diced olive oil on 

00:00:52.389 --> 00:01:01.179
 griddle and driving onions not even 

00:00:55.899 --> 00:01:03.549
 fried to break smoked bacon well 

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:10.560
 you know what grams hundred hundred hundred 

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:10.560
 fifty can be less and stripes 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.140
 not long and not fat and send on 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:24.259
 another griddle let her there 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.259
 dried scooped up with fats 

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:32.759
 tangle over three minutes and let you start 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:36.600
 frying add eggplants yet 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:40.890
 after three or four minute fragrant mixture 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:43.679
 rather fragrant ingredients are these chili 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:46.020
 and garlic and how brazen eggplant ate 

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:48.140
 and drank all the oil add a little 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:53.580
 oils 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:57.689
 Well, garlic and pepper stuck give 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:02:01.849
 its flavors were all to on moderate 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:05.240
 fire now fire to maximum and add 

00:02:01.849 --> 00:02:08.250
 amateur own juice and a half banks 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.649
 Now summer can certainly be added and 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:14.519
 fresh 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:16.920
 sol by the way this thing and sprinkle and 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:19.170
 dimensional but I prefer all the same 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.700
 canned it is an Italian affair 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.850
 not that they are just not the knees 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.380
 good quality and really worth 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:28.320
 it will be cheaper than you take 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.810
 good buy tomatoes somewhere in 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:34.410
 Moscow for example 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:37.230
 fasting use bar Lansky Portillo not 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:39.720
 In this case such tubules 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:42.269
 grooved over them and what value 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.700
 tubules like what shape have posts but you 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:47.060
 can i take any i use these 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:51.720
 so because I bought them at a discount 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:55.319
 there was an action in the store trying sauce 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.370
 add sugar to compensate 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:58.330
 acid 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:02.740
 some more salt 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:07.470
 waste stewed in a lid 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:11.610
 water salute cool and send there post 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:13.420
 12 minutes as written on the packaging 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:20.260
 extra virgin oils 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:24.970
 at night the glass bowl stirred a little 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:33.040
 and I take a breakdown of the centuries so I put cheese and 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:36.040
 various then the remaining pasta food 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:40.510
 river but instead of the river you can 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:47.820
 use any ricotta curd just 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:52.360
 Little did I recode history 250 grams 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:55.170
 now pour the whole thing sauce can 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:55.170
 permit 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:17.140
 you need a glass of a good day 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:21.780
 and it is possible it has no seams almost have all 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:21.780
 bon appetit good luck for now
