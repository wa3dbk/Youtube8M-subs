you're sewing your design
so<00:01:12.210> let's<00:01:12.479> go<00:01:12.630> ahead<00:01:12.719> and<00:01:13.110> put<00:01:13.409> this<00:01:13.619> on<00:01:14.509> so<00:01:15.509> the

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
so let's go ahead and put this on so the

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.929 
so let's go ahead and put this on so the
inside<00:01:16.229> part<00:01:16.530> goes<00:01:16.890> underneath<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.430> design

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
inside part goes underneath the design

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:24.490 
inside part goes underneath the design
and<00:01:18.299> I<00:01:19.229> try<00:01:19.500> to<00:01:19.560> Center<00:01:20.009> it<00:01:20.240> as<00:01:21.240> best<00:01:21.659> I<00:01:21.930> can<00:01:22.430> and

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
and I try to Center it as best I can and

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.670 
and I try to Center it as best I can and
then<00:01:25.500> I<00:01:25.829> undo<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:26.969> screw<00:01:27.299> right<00:01:28.020> here<00:01:28.320> as<00:01:28.469> much

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
then I undo the screw right here as much

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.340 
then I undo the screw right here as much
as<00:01:28.710> I<00:01:28.890> can<00:01:28.950> so<00:01:29.340> I<00:01:29.399> can<00:01:29.460> just<00:01:29.869> fit<00:01:30.869> it<00:01:30.960> over<00:01:31.200> the

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
as I can so I can just fit it over the

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.529 
as I can so I can just fit it over the
top<00:01:31.590> and<00:01:31.969> then<00:01:32.969> I<00:01:33.000> can<00:01:33.270> always<00:01:33.390> tighten<00:01:33.810> it<00:01:35.539> and

00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:36.539 
top and then I can always tighten it and

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:39.260 
top and then I can always tighten it and
then<00:01:37.109> once<00:01:37.320> you<00:01:37.439> have<00:01:37.619> it<00:01:37.799> pretty<00:01:38.729> tight<00:01:39.000> you

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
then once you have it pretty tight you

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.090 
then once you have it pretty tight you
can<00:01:39.509> go<00:01:39.630> ahead<00:01:39.719> and<00:01:40.020> pull<00:01:40.229> your<00:01:40.259> fabric<00:01:40.619> a

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
can go ahead and pull your fabric a

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.830 
can go ahead and pull your fabric a
little<00:01:41.460> bit<00:01:41.700> more<00:01:41.969> so<00:01:42.180> you<00:01:42.240> make<00:01:42.450> sure<00:01:42.600> it's

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
little bit more so you make sure it's

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.130 
little bit more so you make sure it's
really<00:01:43.229> tight<00:01:44.299> now<00:01:45.299> let's<00:01:45.509> talk<00:01:45.689> about<00:01:45.750> the

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
really tight now let's talk about the

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.639 
really tight now let's talk about the
thread<00:01:46.460> so<00:01:47.460> I'm<00:01:47.820> using<00:01:48.179> embroidery<00:01:48.960> floss<00:01:49.140> the

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
thread so I'm using embroidery floss the

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.499 
thread so I'm using embroidery floss the
length<00:01:49.950> I<00:01:50.219> would<00:01:50.490> say<00:01:50.700> is<00:01:50.759> about<00:01:51.000> 14<00:01:51.479> inches

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
length I would say is about 14 inches

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.620 
length I would say is about 14 inches
you<00:01:52.020> don't<00:01:52.200> want<00:01:52.350> to<00:01:52.439> cut<00:01:52.649> a<00:01:52.859> huge<00:01:53.729> long<00:01:54.210> piece

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
you don't want to cut a huge long piece

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:55.910 
you don't want to cut a huge long piece
because<00:01:55.109> then<00:01:55.229> it's<00:01:55.380> just<00:01:55.469> going<00:01:55.619> to<00:01:55.679> get<00:01:55.799> all

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
because then it's just going to get all

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.319 
because then it's just going to get all
tangled<00:01:56.369> up<00:01:56.520> so<00:01:56.729> you<00:01:56.789> definitely<00:01:56.969> want

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
tangled up so you definitely want

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:58.819 
tangled up so you definitely want
something<00:01:57.509> to<00:01:57.780> manage<00:01:58.170> and<00:01:58.380> it's<00:01:58.500> better<00:01:58.619> to

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
something to manage and it's better to

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.069 
something to manage and it's better to
be<00:01:58.950> a<00:01:58.979> little<00:01:59.310> bit<00:01:59.490> on<00:01:59.640> the<00:02:00.270> shorter<00:02:00.630> side<00:02:00.659> than

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
be a little bit on the shorter side than

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.840 
be a little bit on the shorter side than
to<00:02:01.109> worry<00:02:01.380> about<00:02:01.649> how<00:02:02.310> many<00:02:02.369> times<00:02:02.670> you're

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
to worry about how many times you're

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.279 
to worry about how many times you're
going<00:02:02.880> to<00:02:02.999> have<00:02:03.119> to<00:02:03.179> tie<00:02:03.359> a<00:02:03.390> knot<00:02:03.600> I'm<00:02:04.140> also

00:02:04.279 --> 00:02:04.289 
going to have to tie a knot I'm also

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:07.099 
going to have to tie a knot I'm also
using<00:02:04.499> an<00:02:05.039> embroidery<00:02:05.609> needle<00:02:05.729> this<00:02:06.689> makes<00:02:06.929> it

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:07.109 
using an embroidery needle this makes it

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:08.749 
using an embroidery needle this makes it
very<00:02:07.140> helpful<00:02:07.679> as<00:02:07.829> well<00:02:08.039> now<00:02:08.280> when<00:02:08.429> you<00:02:08.520> cut

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
very helpful as well now when you cut

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.260 
very helpful as well now when you cut
your<00:02:08.910> floss<00:02:09.590> you'll<00:02:10.590> notice<00:02:11.070> that<00:02:11.460> the<00:02:11.910> single

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
your floss you'll notice that the single

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.630 
your floss you'll notice that the single
floss<00:02:12.510> is<00:02:12.780> made<00:02:13.080> up<00:02:13.260> of<00:02:13.530> a<00:02:13.890> bunch<00:02:14.190> of<00:02:14.400> little

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
floss is made up of a bunch of little

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.050 
floss is made up of a bunch of little
strands<00:02:15.300> so<00:02:15.690> there<00:02:15.870> should<00:02:16.140> be<00:02:16.170> six<00:02:16.890> strands

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
strands so there should be six strands

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.970 
strands so there should be six strands
and<00:02:18.150> for<00:02:18.450> my<00:02:18.690> example<00:02:19.200> I'm<00:02:19.440> going<00:02:19.620> to<00:02:19.680> go<00:02:19.860> ahead

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
and for my example I'm going to go ahead

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.970 
and for my example I'm going to go ahead
and<00:02:20.400> use<00:02:20.580> three<00:02:21.209> of<00:02:21.330> those<00:02:21.510> strands<00:02:22.140> so

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
and use three of those strands so

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.430 
and use three of those strands so
there's<00:02:23.190> three<00:02:23.459> strands<00:02:23.940> on<00:02:24.060> here<00:02:24.690> and<00:02:24.870> it

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
there's three strands on here and it

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.100 
there's three strands on here and it
really<00:02:25.709> just<00:02:25.950> depends<00:02:26.370> on<00:02:26.610> how<00:02:26.970> thick<00:02:27.870> you

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
really just depends on how thick you

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:29.990 
really just depends on how thick you
want<00:02:28.140> each<00:02:28.560> stitch<00:02:28.920> to<00:02:29.160> be<00:02:29.310> so<00:02:29.520> if<00:02:29.610> you<00:02:29.700> want<00:02:29.910> it

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
want each stitch to be so if you want it

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.850 
want each stitch to be so if you want it
more<00:02:30.180> on<00:02:30.239> the<00:02:30.360> thinner<00:02:30.540> side<00:02:30.630> you<00:02:30.989> can<00:02:31.140> use<00:02:31.290> two

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
more on the thinner side you can use two

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.290 
more on the thinner side you can use two
strands<00:02:32.370> or<00:02:32.520> if<00:02:32.640> you<00:02:32.730> want<00:02:32.880> it<00:02:32.970> thicker<00:02:33.060> you

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
strands or if you want it thicker you

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.030 
strands or if you want it thicker you
can<00:02:33.330> use<00:02:33.540> four<00:02:34.020> it's<00:02:34.290> really<00:02:34.620> up<00:02:34.739> to<00:02:34.769> you<00:02:35.010> to

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
can use four it's really up to you to

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.000 
can use four it's really up to you to
experiment<00:02:35.670> on<00:02:35.880> that<00:02:35.930> so<00:02:36.930> it's<00:02:37.140> on<00:02:37.349> my<00:02:37.680> needle

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
experiment on that so it's on my needle

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.150 
experiment on that so it's on my needle
and<00:02:38.190> then<00:02:38.489> on<00:02:38.760> the<00:02:38.940> very<00:02:38.970> end<00:02:39.510> here<00:02:39.840> I<00:02:40.019> just<00:02:40.160> tie

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
and then on the very end here I just tie

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.850 
and then on the very end here I just tie
a<00:02:41.190> knot<00:02:41.489> you<00:02:42.230> can<00:02:43.230> see<00:02:43.560> that<00:02:43.739> I<00:02:43.769> already

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
a knot you can see that I already

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.620 
a knot you can see that I already
started<00:02:44.670> on<00:02:44.790> my<00:02:44.970> design

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
started on my design

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.000 
started on my design
so<00:02:45.720> what<00:02:45.870> my<00:02:45.989> stitches<00:02:46.410> are<00:02:46.530> essentially

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
so what my stitches are essentially

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.280 
so what my stitches are essentially
doing<00:02:47.190> is<00:02:47.430> they're<00:02:47.760> filling<00:02:48.239> in<00:02:48.450> the<00:02:48.660> space<00:02:48.989> in

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
doing is they're filling in the space in

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:50.990 
doing is they're filling in the space in
between<00:02:49.860> my<00:02:50.069> lines<00:02:50.310> that's<00:02:50.580> why<00:02:50.700> it's<00:02:50.910> a

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
between my lines that's why it's a

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.509 
between my lines that's why it's a
filler<00:02:51.269> stitch<00:02:51.709> so<00:02:52.709> what<00:02:52.890> I'm<00:02:53.010> going<00:02:53.130> to<00:02:53.160> do<00:02:53.340> is

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
filler stitch so what I'm going to do is

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:56.570 
filler stitch so what I'm going to do is
start<00:02:53.790> on<00:02:53.940> the<00:02:54.090> back<00:02:54.269> and<00:02:54.860> I'm<00:02:55.860> going<00:02:55.890> to<00:02:56.340> bring

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
start on the back and I'm going to bring

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:57.680 
start on the back and I'm going to bring
up<00:02:56.760> my<00:02:56.910> needle<00:02:57.209> and<00:02:57.239> I'm<00:02:57.330> starting<00:02:57.540> in<00:02:57.660> the

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
up my needle and I'm starting in the

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.539 
up my needle and I'm starting in the
back<00:02:57.870> so<00:02:58.080> my<00:02:58.200> knots<00:02:58.410> going<00:02:58.590> to<00:02:58.709> be<00:02:58.799> hidden<00:02:58.980> so

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549 
back so my knots going to be hidden so

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:00.590 
back so my knots going to be hidden so
I'm<00:02:59.640> actually<00:02:59.790> going<00:03:00.000> to<00:03:00.060> start<00:03:00.299> right<00:03:00.569> here

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
I'm actually going to start right here

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:06.559 
I'm actually going to start right here
on<00:03:01.049> this<00:03:01.170> inside<00:03:01.709> part<00:03:02.190> of<00:03:02.660> my<00:03:03.660> flower<00:03:04.019> and<00:03:05.569> I'm

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:06.569 
on this inside part of my flower and I'm

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:10.039 
on this inside part of my flower and I'm
starting<00:03:06.900> just<00:03:07.470> outside<00:03:08.180> my<00:03:09.180> blue<00:03:09.480> line<00:03:09.510> you

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:10.049 
starting just outside my blue line you

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:13.970 
starting just outside my blue line you
can<00:03:10.230> see<00:03:10.349> that's<00:03:10.530> right<00:03:10.830> on<00:03:11.099> the<00:03:11.130> edge<00:03:12.830> pull<00:03:13.830> it

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
can see that's right on the edge pull it

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.100 
can see that's right on the edge pull it
through<00:03:14.370> and<00:03:14.670> the<00:03:15.420> trick<00:03:15.660> is<00:03:15.690> when<00:03:15.959> you're

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
through and the trick is when you're

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.350 
through and the trick is when you're
pulling<00:03:16.319> your<00:03:16.620> stitches<00:03:17.099> through<00:03:17.400> don't<00:03:18.030> pull

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
pulling your stitches through don't pull

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.210 
pulling your stitches through don't pull
it<00:03:18.510> too<00:03:18.750> tight<00:03:18.780> or<00:03:19.319> I'll<00:03:19.440> start<00:03:19.739> puckering

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
it too tight or I'll start puckering

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.729 
it too tight or I'll start puckering
your<00:03:20.370> fabric<00:03:20.970> so<00:03:21.870> you<00:03:21.930> wanted<00:03:22.260> to<00:03:22.320> have<00:03:22.440> a<00:03:22.500> nice

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 
your fabric so you wanted to have a nice

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:25.250 
your fabric so you wanted to have a nice
tension<00:03:23.040> but<00:03:23.430> not<00:03:23.489> too<00:03:23.820> tight<00:03:24.120> all<00:03:25.079> right

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
tension but not too tight all right

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:26.780 
tension but not too tight all right
let's<00:03:25.829> move<00:03:26.040> this<00:03:26.160> out<00:03:26.340> of<00:03:26.370> the<00:03:26.459> way<00:03:26.579> so<00:03:26.640> you

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
let's move this out of the way so you

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.020 
let's move this out of the way so you
can<00:03:26.880> see<00:03:27.000> what<00:03:27.269> I'm<00:03:27.359> doing<00:03:28.459> so<00:03:29.459> I'm<00:03:29.670> going<00:03:30.000> to

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
can see what I'm doing so I'm going to

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:34.009 
can see what I'm doing so I'm going to
start<00:03:30.660> on<00:03:30.989> the<00:03:31.470> opposite<00:03:32.130> side<00:03:32.519> on<00:03:32.970> the<00:03:33.810> edge

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
start on the opposite side on the edge

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:37.789 
start on the opposite side on the edge
of<00:03:34.560> my<00:03:34.620> blue<00:03:35.459> line<00:03:35.730> and<00:03:36.230> I'm<00:03:37.230> going<00:03:37.410> to<00:03:37.500> come<00:03:37.769> up

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:20.110 
it's really cool but can I do something
similar<00:05:17.960> on<00:05:18.229> my<00:05:18.500> sewing<00:05:18.800> machine<00:05:19.190> the<00:05:19.760> answer

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:20.120 
similar on my sewing machine the answer

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:23.409 
similar on my sewing machine the answer
is<00:05:20.270> yes<00:05:20.810> and<00:05:20.870> no<00:05:21.110> you<00:05:22.100> can<00:05:22.370> do<00:05:22.550> it<00:05:22.729> if<00:05:22.970> you<00:05:23.180> have

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:23.419 
is yes and no you can do it if you have

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:25.360 
is yes and no you can do it if you have
an<00:05:23.780> embroidery<00:05:24.229> machine<00:05:24.380> but<00:05:24.979> if<00:05:25.100> you<00:05:25.190> have

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:25.370 
an embroidery machine but if you have

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:27.610 
an embroidery machine but if you have
just<00:05:25.610> a<00:05:25.760> regular<00:05:25.789> sewing<00:05:26.479> machine<00:05:26.900> you<00:05:27.440> can

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:27.620 
just a regular sewing machine you can

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:29.350 
just a regular sewing machine you can
still<00:05:27.889> do<00:05:28.070> a<00:05:28.100> satin<00:05:28.550> stitch<00:05:28.580> but<00:05:29.060> it's<00:05:29.210> going

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.360 
still do a satin stitch but it's going

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.320 
still do a satin stitch but it's going
to<00:05:29.600> look<00:05:29.750> more<00:05:30.169> like<00:05:30.229> this<00:05:31.010> and<00:05:31.340> what<00:05:31.669> it<00:05:31.789> is<00:05:31.970> is

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:32.330 
to look more like this and what it is is

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:35.560 
to look more like this and what it is is
a<00:05:32.389> zig-zag<00:05:33.350> stitch<00:05:33.850> but<00:05:34.850> the<00:05:34.970> stitches<00:05:35.360> are

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:35.570 
a zig-zag stitch but the stitches are

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:38.650 
a zig-zag stitch but the stitches are
really<00:05:36.229> close<00:05:36.560> together<00:05:37.100> so<00:05:37.490> what<00:05:38.090> it<00:05:38.210> does<00:05:38.389> is

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:38.660 
really close together so what it does is

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:40.600 
really close together so what it does is
it<00:05:38.810> forms<00:05:39.139> just<00:05:39.560> a<00:05:39.650> straight<00:05:39.950> line<00:05:40.190> with<00:05:40.430> all

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:40.610 
it forms just a straight line with all

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:41.650 
it forms just a straight line with all
these<00:05:40.760> stitches<00:05:40.970> stacked

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:41.660 
these stitches stacked

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:43.990 
these stitches stacked
what<00:05:42.110> is<00:05:42.200> used<00:05:42.470> for<00:05:42.740> is<00:05:42.950> for<00:05:43.160> doing<00:05:43.460> outlines

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:44.000 
what is used for is for doing outlines

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.960 
what is used for is for doing outlines
such<00:05:44.510> as<00:05:44.660> on<00:05:44.900> your<00:05:45.320> appliques<00:05:45.950> so<00:05:46.729> it's<00:05:46.910> a

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:46.970 
such as on your appliques so it's a

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:49.480 
such as on your appliques so it's a
really<00:05:47.240> nice<00:05:47.389> stitch<00:05:47.660> to<00:05:47.900> use<00:05:48.190> but<00:05:49.190> you're<00:05:49.310> not

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:49.490 
really nice stitch to use but you're not

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:51.159 
really nice stitch to use but you're not
going<00:05:49.729> to<00:05:49.789> quite<00:05:50.030> get<00:05:50.240> something<00:05:50.780> of<00:05:50.990> this

00:05:51.159 --> 00:05:51.169 
going to quite get something of this

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:52.719 
going to quite get something of this
effect<00:05:51.740> so<00:05:51.889> I'm<00:05:52.039> going<00:05:52.220> to<00:05:52.250> show<00:05:52.430> you<00:05:52.460> how<00:05:52.700> to

00:05:52.719 --> 00:05:52.729 
effect so I'm going to show you how to

00:05:52.729 --> 00:05:56.110 
effect so I'm going to show you how to
do<00:05:52.970> this<00:05:53.120> next<00:05:53.330> on<00:05:53.630> your<00:05:53.660> machine<00:05:54.139> if<00:05:55.120> your

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:56.120 
do this next on your machine if your

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:58.360 
do this next on your machine if your
machine<00:05:56.270> can<00:05:56.690> do<00:05:56.840> a<00:05:56.870> zig-zag<00:05:57.440> stitch<00:05:57.680> you

00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:58.370 
machine can do a zig-zag stitch you

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:00.070 
machine can do a zig-zag stitch you
should<00:05:58.610> be<00:05:58.760> able<00:05:58.940> to<00:05:59.120> pull<00:05:59.419> off<00:05:59.450> a<00:05:59.599> satin

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:00.080 
should be able to pull off a satin

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:02.650 
should be able to pull off a satin
stitch<00:06:00.110> as<00:06:00.560> well<00:06:00.729> so<00:06:01.729> we're<00:06:02.240> going<00:06:02.389> to<00:06:02.450> just

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:02.660 
stitch as well so we're going to just

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:04.570 
stitch as well so we're going to just
ignore<00:06:02.930> all<00:06:03.169> these<00:06:03.560> numbers<00:06:03.919> except<00:06:04.370> for

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:04.580 
ignore all these numbers except for

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:06.640 
ignore all these numbers except for
these<00:06:04.940> two<00:06:05.000> numbers<00:06:05.660> here<00:06:06.020> I've<00:06:06.200> already

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:06.650 
these two numbers here I've already

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:08.830 
these two numbers here I've already
selected<00:06:06.889> the<00:06:07.550> zig-zag<00:06:07.820> stitch<00:06:08.030> for<00:06:08.690> my

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:08.840 
selected the zig-zag stitch for my

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:11.800 
selected the zig-zag stitch for my
machine<00:06:09.080> this<00:06:10.070> is<00:06:10.370> the<00:06:10.639> stitch<00:06:10.940> width<00:06:11.360> number

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:11.810 
machine this is the stitch width number

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:14.710 
machine this is the stitch width number
and<00:06:12.080> this<00:06:12.650> is<00:06:12.800> the<00:06:12.950> stitch<00:06:13.190> length<00:06:13.700> so<00:06:14.599> the

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:14.720 
and this is the stitch length so the

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:15.850 
and this is the stitch length so the
first<00:06:14.960> thing<00:06:15.110> I'm<00:06:15.200> going<00:06:15.289> to<00:06:15.440> do<00:06:15.530> is<00:06:15.650> I'm<00:06:15.740> going

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:15.860 
first thing I'm going to do is I'm going

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:19.629 
first thing I'm going to do is I'm going
to<00:06:15.919> lower<00:06:16.160> the<00:06:16.280> stitch<00:06:16.820> length<00:06:18.610> because<00:06:19.610> I

00:06:19.629 --> 00:06:19.639 
to lower the stitch length because I

00:06:19.639 --> 00:06:23.020 
to lower the stitch length because I
want<00:06:20.030> my<00:06:20.180> stitches<00:06:21.070> to<00:06:22.070> be<00:06:22.400> very<00:06:22.669> close

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:23.030 
want my stitches to be very close

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:25.330 
want my stitches to be very close
together<00:06:23.330> so<00:06:24.289> it's<00:06:24.500> still<00:06:24.710> zigzagging<00:06:25.190> back

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:25.340 
together so it's still zigzagging back

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:27.010 
together so it's still zigzagging back
and<00:06:25.490> forth<00:06:25.849> but<00:06:26.120> it's<00:06:26.270> doing<00:06:26.510> it<00:06:26.599> really<00:06:26.780> close

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:27.020 
and forth but it's doing it really close

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:28.450 
and forth but it's doing it really close
together<00:06:27.200> so<00:06:27.410> i'm<00:06:27.620> laurin<00:06:27.919> as<00:06:28.039> low<00:06:28.190> as<00:06:28.340> I<00:06:28.430> can

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:28.460 
together so i'm laurin as low as I can

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:32.800 
together so i'm laurin as low as I can
go<00:06:28.610> without<00:06:29.300> hitting<00:06:29.870> zero<00:06:30.639> now<00:06:31.639> the<00:06:31.700> width<00:06:32.570> of

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:32.810 
go without hitting zero now the width of

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:36.520 
go without hitting zero now the width of
it<00:06:32.990> is<00:06:33.200> going<00:06:33.860> to<00:06:34.130> depend<00:06:34.400> on<00:06:34.880> how<00:06:35.120> thick<00:06:35.780> you

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:36.530 
it is going to depend on how thick you

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:38.469 
it is going to depend on how thick you
want<00:06:36.560> your<00:06:37.039> row<00:06:37.250> to<00:06:37.310> be<00:06:37.610> so<00:06:37.940> you<00:06:38.030> can<00:06:38.180> see<00:06:38.270> this

00:06:38.469 --> 00:06:38.479 
want your row to be so you can see this

00:06:38.479 --> 00:06:41.830 
want your row to be so you can see this
one<00:06:38.780> here<00:06:39.169> is<00:06:39.320> actually<00:06:39.560> a<00:06:40.450> four<00:06:41.450> point

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:41.840 
one here is actually a four point

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:43.960 
one here is actually a four point
five<00:06:42.440> and<00:06:42.830> then<00:06:43.100> you<00:06:43.190> can<00:06:43.310> see<00:06:43.430> it's<00:06:43.550> thicker

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:43.970 
five and then you can see it's thicker

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:46.420 
five and then you can see it's thicker
down<00:06:44.210> here<00:06:44.630> so<00:06:44.840> I<00:06:44.870> did<00:06:45.139> the<00:06:45.320> the<00:06:45.770> widest<00:06:46.220> stitch

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:46.430 
down here so I did the the widest stitch

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:49.870 
down here so I did the the widest stitch
I<00:06:46.639> can<00:06:46.820> do<00:06:46.970> on<00:06:47.090> my<00:06:47.210> machine<00:06:47.360> which<00:06:48.050> is<00:06:48.230> a<00:06:48.410> six<00:06:48.880> so

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:49.880 
I can do on my machine which is a six so

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:51.820 
I can do on my machine which is a six so
depending<00:06:50.389> on<00:06:50.480> what<00:06:50.690> you<00:06:50.840> want<00:06:51.080> to<00:06:51.200> do<00:06:51.350> you<00:06:51.680> can

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:51.830 
depending on what you want to do you can

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:53.250 
depending on what you want to do you can
adjust<00:06:52.190> it<00:06:52.340> and<00:06:52.520> I<00:06:52.610> definitely<00:06:52.669> recommend

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:53.260 
adjust it and I definitely recommend

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.420 
adjust it and I definitely recommend
playing<00:06:54.260> with<00:06:54.470> your<00:06:54.650> machine<00:06:54.770> until<00:06:55.190> you<00:06:55.280> get

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:55.430 
playing with your machine until you get

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:57.300 
playing with your machine until you get
something<00:06:55.669> that<00:06:55.910> you're<00:06:56.060> comfortable<00:06:56.360> with

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:57.310 
something that you're comfortable with

00:06:57.310 --> 00:07:00.490 
something that you're comfortable with
I've<00:06:58.310> already<00:06:58.580> ironed<00:06:59.090> my<00:06:59.210> applique<00:06:59.930> onto<00:07:00.169> my

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:00.500 
I've already ironed my applique onto my

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:02.830 
I've already ironed my applique onto my
fabric<00:07:00.710> and<00:07:01.070> now<00:07:01.220> I'm<00:07:01.340> going<00:07:01.490> to<00:07:01.550> use<00:07:01.610> my<00:07:02.060> satin

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:02.840 
fabric and now I'm going to use my satin

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:05.260 
fabric and now I'm going to use my satin
stitch<00:07:03.020> to<00:07:03.230> outline<00:07:03.800> that<00:07:03.830> applique<00:07:04.700> now<00:07:05.210> I

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:05.270 
stitch to outline that applique now I

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:08.170 
stitch to outline that applique now I
want<00:07:05.570> to<00:07:05.630> make<00:07:05.810> sure<00:07:06.250> that<00:07:07.250> the<00:07:07.610> edge<00:07:07.790> of<00:07:08.150> my

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:08.180 
want to make sure that the edge of my

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:10.390 
want to make sure that the edge of my
applique<00:07:08.840> falls<00:07:09.320> right<00:07:09.680> in<00:07:09.889> the<00:07:10.010> middle<00:07:10.220> of

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:10.400 
applique falls right in the middle of

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:12.550 
applique falls right in the middle of
the<00:07:10.580> width<00:07:10.820> of<00:07:10.940> my<00:07:11.150> stitches<00:07:11.600> so<00:07:12.080> my<00:07:12.230> stitches

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:12.560 
the width of my stitches so my stitches

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:14.080 
the width of my stitches so my stitches
aren't<00:07:12.740> coming<00:07:13.100> to<00:07:13.130> the<00:07:13.250> edge<00:07:13.460> in<00:07:13.850> fact

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:14.090 
aren't coming to the edge in fact

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:15.580 
aren't coming to the edge in fact
they're<00:07:14.300> going<00:07:14.330> to<00:07:14.510> be<00:07:14.630> overlapping<00:07:15.229> and

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:15.590 
they're going to be overlapping and

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:18.129 
they're going to be overlapping and
going<00:07:15.860> on<00:07:16.040> both<00:07:16.280> sides<00:07:16.610> so<00:07:17.600> I'm<00:07:17.690> just<00:07:17.900> going<00:07:18.080> to

00:07:18.129 --> 00:07:18.139 
going on both sides so I'm just going to

00:07:18.139 --> 00:07:23.280 
going on both sides so I'm just going to
take<00:07:18.440> my<00:07:18.650> time<00:07:19.630> so<00:07:20.630> that<00:07:20.810> I<00:07:20.840> make<00:07:21.350> sure<00:07:21.620> to

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:23.290 
take my time so that I make sure to

00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:26.320 
take my time so that I make sure to
carefully<00:07:24.290> outline<00:07:24.800> it<00:07:25.100> and<00:07:25.280> the<00:07:25.880> whole<00:07:26.090> thing

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:26.330 
carefully outline it and the whole thing
