 i 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.430
 top 10 most unexplored places in the 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:14.260
 earth man has revealed many 

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:16.840
 secrets of the earth with the help of 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:19.210
 machines vehicles research and the 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.070
 development most places of 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:22.929
 the earth are accessible now with 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:27.220
 improvements in infrastructure and 

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:29.349
 technology number 10 caves deep 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.720
 sinuous and dark slippery e 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:33.310
 uninhabitable the caves also continue 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.640
 being one of the least places 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:37.750
 explored and documented on earth 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.220
 Speleology is very popular in France 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:43.810
 Italy Australia United Kingdom USA 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:46.030
 etcetera therefore most of the 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:48.310
 caves currently documented are from 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:51.310
 europe asia north america and 

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:53.410
 australia however china that has 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:55.360
 the highest limestone deposits 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:58.510
 in the world it has very few caves 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:00.640
 explored south america africa the 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:03.250
 Antarctic have not been explored to the fullest 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.710
 the exact number of 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:08.229
 The caves of the earth Bologna 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.170
 giorgi to the deepest cave known 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:12.040
 in the world has also not been explored 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.820
 completely because of its environment 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.110
 extreme 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:19.810
 inhospitable mind number 9 amazon rainforest 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:22.150
 the Amazon forest contains 50% of the 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.280
 tropical forests of the world its 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:26.290
 biodiversity is extremely broad 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.570
 since it supports numerous types of 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:30.820
 plant species and more than 2,000 birds 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:33.430
 and mammals its climate and its surroundings 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.410
 have invoked the interests of many of 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.960
 the great expeditions of exploration 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:40.810
 however, its habitat has impeded 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:43.240
 in-depth exploration of this region near 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:46.810
 of 2.5 million species of insects 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:48.700
 and 438 thousand species of plants have been 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:52.390
 officially documented and many 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:55.330
 they stopped being discovered number 8 the 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:57.039
 Antarctica no one knows exactly what 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:00.580
 there is below the ground the side of the 

00:01:57.039 --> 00:02:02.500
 Antarctic with layers of 3200 ice 18 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:04.780
 meters thick is also the place 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:07.780
 colder on earth scientists 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.869
 they believe that there is a network of rivers streams and 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.220
 stony ground under the ice 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:14.080
 recently the discovery of the 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.880
 subglacial lakes has opened a new 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.580
 chapter in the exploration of the 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.050
 Antarctic there are possibilities that these 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.120
 lakes harbor forms of 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:23.680
 that can be studied by providing 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.900
 useful answers to scientists 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.600
 about life in outer space 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.520
 the bottom of the ocean below the 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:34.600
 Antarctica has not yet been explored 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:36.850
 number 7 pit of the marianas the place 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:40.000
 deeper and darker in the ocean 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:42.010
 it is 10,911 meters deep is 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.380
 one of the least explored places in 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.450
 the earth because of its depth and 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:48.550
 pressure of up to 1000 atmospheres what 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.890
 deep is completely hostile to 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:53.020
 human beings even though the 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.060
 scientific development has increased 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:56.830
 the knowledge of man about life 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.870
 on the high seas with the discovery of 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:01.180
 many new varieties of creatures from 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.520
 deep water on the ocean floor only 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.410
 2% of the ocean floor has been 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.990
 explored leaving much more for 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:10.090
 discover a study of life on high 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:11.950
 Sea help scientists understand 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.900
 the patterns of life and the only ones 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:17.310
 deep-sea creatures in the 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:20.290
 extreme ocean conditions number 6 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:22.480
 deserts we know that in all 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.610
 deserts of the earth have been realized 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.950
 very few scans since they have 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:29.590
 the less hospitable environments for 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.569
 have human life exploration is almost 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.459
 they have always been marked with tragedy and 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:36.190
 the loss of life due to the hard 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:38.230
 desert conditions scientists 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:40.120
 and extreme adventurers delve into 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:44.830
 the deserts for research and the

 seventy meters above sea level the 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:52.599
 gun carbon psuv has the distinction of 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:55.330
 be the highest mountain climbing on the 

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:57.239
 land four unsuccessful expeditions 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:59.290
 have been carried out to date 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:01.269
 currently the government of Bhutan has 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:03.700
 Forbidden to climb the mountain due to 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:05.890
 religious beliefs and it's unlikely 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:11.410
 that is conquered in the near future 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:13.690
 Number 4 greenland ice layer 81% 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:15.670
 of Greenland is covered in ice and 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:17.440
 therefore it is also the least 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:19.870
 populated the world with the main 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:22.060
 settlements located on the free coast 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:24.010
 of greenland ice has only been 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.780
 explored to some extent since the 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:28.750
 climate and ice is not fit for life 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:30.760
 human however scientists 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:32.410
 carry out expeditions for the purpose of 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.700
 research and development in the north 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:37.690
 from Greenland

 Number 3 northwest of Siberia Siberia 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:42.130
 constitutes almost all of north asia 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:44.170
 which the west of Siberia is 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:46.240
 covered with ice while the east and 

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:47.400
 center of siberia is made up of chains 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.570
 mountainous 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.460
 Recently many expeditions 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:53.740
 research are carried out by the 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:55.840
 scientists and geologists to study their 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:57.850
 environment and ecology as the 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:01.360
 The majority of the population is concentrated in 

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:04.030
 West of Siberia number 2 mountains 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:06.220
 from northern Colombia the mountains of 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:08.320
 North of Colombia have been unexplored 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:10.420
 until recently when a group of 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:13.420
 scientists embarked on an expedition 

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:15.340
 biological the yariguÃ­es mountains are the 

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:17.490
 home of a species recently 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:21.280

 the central area of high forest area 

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:27.970
 mountainous has been under protection 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:30.640
 due to its inclusion in parks

 New Guinea nationals these forests 

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:35.800
 are the life supports of species of 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:37.900
 birds and animals varied however 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:41.190
 mining activities are raising 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:41.190
 threats to its fragile ecosystem
