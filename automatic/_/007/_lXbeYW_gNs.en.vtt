the<00:00:00.149> design<00:00:00.450> started<00:00:01.110> 1<00:00:01.890> year<00:00:01.920> ago<00:00:02.330> one<00:00:03.330> of<00:00:03.360> the

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:03.480 
the design started 1 year ago one of the

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.300 
the design started 1 year ago one of the
half<00:00:03.689> years<00:00:03.929> ago<00:00:04.200> because<00:00:04.440> we<00:00:04.740> presented<00:00:05.220> the

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
half years ago because we presented the

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.160 
half years ago because we presented the
current<00:00:05.670> the<00:00:05.790> mondial<00:00:06.150> in<00:00:06.299> Paris<00:00:06.660> last

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
current the mondial in Paris last

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.450 
current the mondial in Paris last
October<00:00:07.680> and<00:00:08.480> our<00:00:09.480> pre<00:00:09.840> force<00:00:10.170> to<00:00:10.980> start<00:00:11.250> with

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
October and our pre force to start with

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.060 
October and our pre force to start with
a<00:00:11.490> specific<00:00:11.940> architecture<00:00:12.389> for<00:00:13.380> battery<00:00:13.799> cars

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
a specific architecture for battery cars

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.230 
a specific architecture for battery cars
so<00:00:14.759> this<00:00:15.059> car<00:00:15.330> is<00:00:15.540> not<00:00:15.750> a<00:00:15.990> modified<00:00:17.029> car<00:00:18.029> we

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
so this car is not a modified car we

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.510 
so this car is not a modified car we
already<00:00:18.660> had<00:00:18.930> in<00:00:19.199> in<00:00:19.500> the<00:00:19.650> range<00:00:19.830> no<00:00:20.100> it's<00:00:20.369> a

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
already had in in the range no it's a

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:26.380 
already had in in the range no it's a
specific<00:00:20.820> architecture<00:00:22.160> but<00:00:23.160> again<00:00:23.430> our<00:00:24.710> main

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:26.390 
specific architecture but again our main

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.370 
specific architecture but again our main
issue<00:00:27.390> was<00:00:27.689> to<00:00:28.410> find<00:00:28.980> a<00:00:29.070> car<00:00:29.279> which<00:00:29.929> pleases<00:00:30.929> a

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
issue was to find a car which pleases a

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.630 
issue was to find a car which pleases a
normal<00:00:32.099> customer<00:00:32.340> a<00:00:32.820> real<00:00:33.360> car<00:00:34.010> not<00:00:35.010> a<00:00:35.040> very

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
normal customer a real car not a very

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.369 
normal customer a real car not a very
futuristic<00:00:36.570> a<00:00:37.469> real<00:00:37.950> car<00:00:38.250> but<00:00:38.700> electric<00:00:39.239> so<00:00:40.230> we

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
futuristic a real car but electric so we

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.090 
futuristic a real car but electric so we
started<00:00:40.770> one<00:00:41.579> and<00:00:41.730> a<00:00:41.790> half<00:00:41.820> years<00:00:42.149> ago<00:00:43.100> well

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
started one and a half years ago well

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.340 
started one and a half years ago well
then<00:00:44.399> the<00:00:44.789> usual<00:00:45.420> thing<00:00:45.450> is<00:00:45.809> that<00:00:46.020> there's<00:00:46.260> a

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
then the usual thing is that there's a

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.330 
then the usual thing is that there's a
competition<00:00:46.739> in<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.520> design<00:00:47.850> and<00:00:48.120> we<00:00:48.870> choose

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:49.340 
competition in the design and we choose

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:53.270 
competition in the design and we choose
this<00:00:50.340> design<00:00:50.789> because<00:00:50.820> we<00:00:51.719> felt<00:00:51.960> it<00:00:52.350> was<00:00:52.379> for

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
this design because we felt it was for

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.880 
this design because we felt it was for
sale<00:00:53.430> de<00:00:53.730> Rossi<00:00:54.120> horn<00:00:54.360> song<00:00:54.870> reassuring<00:00:55.739> and

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
sale de Rossi horn song reassuring and

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.319 
sale de Rossi horn song reassuring and
very<00:00:56.879> sensual<00:00:57.390> and<00:00:58.609> also<00:00:59.609> at<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.850> same<00:00:59.879> time

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
very sensual and also at the same time

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.479 
very sensual and also at the same time
we<00:01:00.570> developed<00:01:01.020> a<00:01:01.170> new<00:01:01.410> front-end<00:01:01.829> identity

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
we developed a new front-end identity

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.520 
we developed a new front-end identity
which<00:01:02.789> you<00:01:02.940> see<00:01:03.120> here<00:01:03.149> we<00:01:03.809> showed<00:01:03.989> also<00:01:04.350> with

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
which you see here we showed also with

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.399 
which you see here we showed also with
the<00:01:04.739> dizzier<00:01:05.159> on<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.610> module<00:01:05.760> and<00:01:06.200> but<00:01:07.200> for

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
the dizzier on the module and but for

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.300 
the dizzier on the module and but for
the<00:01:07.470> first<00:01:07.740> time<00:01:08.010> on<00:01:08.659> Zoe<00:01:09.659> preview<00:01:10.320> Honor<00:01:10.560> I

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
the first time on Zoe preview Honor I

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.320 
the first time on Zoe preview Honor I
would<00:01:11.369> say<00:01:11.640> more<00:01:12.320> traditional<00:01:14.330> proportions

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
would say more traditional proportions

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.890 
would say more traditional proportions
so<00:01:16.020> you<00:01:16.740> have<00:01:16.920> this<00:01:17.150> renault<00:01:18.150> logo<00:01:18.570> which<00:01:18.750> is

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
so you have this renault logo which is

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.810 
so you have this renault logo which is
much<00:01:19.110> bigger<00:01:19.380> than<00:01:19.530> before<00:01:19.830> it's<00:01:20.580> more

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
much bigger than before it's more

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.300 
much bigger than before it's more
upright<00:01:21.180> it's<00:01:21.810> on<00:01:21.960> a<00:01:21.990> dark<00:01:22.320> background<00:01:22.439> so

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
upright it's on a dark background so

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.420 
upright it's on a dark background so
very<00:01:23.670> well<00:01:24.119> visible<00:01:24.659> and<00:01:25.040> there's<00:01:26.040> a<00:01:26.100> theme

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
very well visible and there's a theme

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.600 
very well visible and there's a theme
towards<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.240> headlamps<00:01:27.840> so<00:01:28.409> this<00:01:28.710> new

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
towards the headlamps so this new

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.060 
towards the headlamps so this new
front-end<00:01:30.060> identity<00:01:30.659> you<00:01:31.140> will<00:01:31.320> find<00:01:31.530> on<00:01:31.770> all

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
front-end identity you will find on all

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.350 
front-end identity you will find on all
the<00:01:32.610> new<00:01:32.790> or<00:01:33.780> coming<00:01:34.200> Renaud's<00:01:35.090> it's<00:01:36.090> not

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
the new or coming Renaud's it's not

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.890 
the new or coming Renaud's it's not
exactly<00:01:37.340> exactly<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.700> same<00:01:38.939> I<00:01:39.150> mean<00:01:39.509> we<00:01:39.659> try

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
exactly exactly the same I mean we try

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.050 
exactly exactly the same I mean we try
to<00:01:39.960> find<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.439> interpretation<00:01:41.250> for<00:01:41.579> each<00:01:41.729> car

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
to find the interpretation for each car

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.530 
to find the interpretation for each car
as<00:01:42.270> we<00:01:43.259> have<00:01:43.380> announced<00:01:43.729> the<00:01:44.729> Paris<00:01:45.030> show<00:01:45.270> I

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
as we have announced the Paris show I

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.789 
as we have announced the Paris show I
mean<00:01:45.899> Zoe<00:01:46.380> preview<00:01:47.189> is<00:01:47.540> well<00:01:48.540> we'd<00:01:48.780> say<00:01:48.990> ninety

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
mean Zoe preview is well we'd say ninety

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.310 
mean Zoe preview is well we'd say ninety
percent<00:01:49.979> it<00:01:50.790> presents<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.299> the<00:01:51.750> real<00:01:51.899> car<00:01:52.170> the

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
percent it presents the the real car the

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.490 
percent it presents the the real car the
reproduction<00:01:52.979> car<00:01:54.020> so<00:01:55.020> there<00:01:55.259> are<00:01:55.320> some

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
reproduction car so there are some

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.310 
reproduction car so there are some
differences<00:01:55.950> for<00:01:56.700> example<00:01:57.020> well<00:01:58.020> the

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
differences for example well the

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.350 
differences for example well the
headlamps<00:01:59.070> are<00:01:59.219> very<00:01:59.430> beautiful<00:01:59.670> here<00:02:00.149> we

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
headlamps are very beautiful here we

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.990 
headlamps are very beautiful here we
have<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.600> latest<00:02:00.810> technology<00:02:01.560> of<00:02:01.770> LEDs<00:02:02.250> but

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
have the latest technology of LEDs but

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.780 
have the latest technology of LEDs but
well<00:02:03.390> due<00:02:03.689> to<00:02:03.899> cost<00:02:04.560> reasons<00:02:04.890> we<00:02:05.460> will<00:02:05.610> have<00:02:05.759> a

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
well due to cost reasons we will have a

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.180 
well due to cost reasons we will have a
more<00:02:06.060> conventional<00:02:06.509> technology<00:02:07.439> here<00:02:07.740> same

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
more conventional technology here same

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.949 
more conventional technology here same
for<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.520> taillights<00:02:08.970> so<00:02:09.599> that's<00:02:09.840> a

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
for the taillights so that's a

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.720 
for the taillights so that's a
difference<00:02:10.489> we<00:02:11.489> won't<00:02:11.700> have<00:02:11.970> a

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
difference we won't have a

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.600 
difference we won't have a
very<00:02:13.420> probably<00:02:13.720> we<00:02:14.230> won't<00:02:14.379> have<00:02:14.650> a<00:02:14.680> glass<00:02:15.310> roof

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
very probably we won't have a glass roof

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.300 
very probably we won't have a glass roof
because<00:02:16.510> a<00:02:17.080> glass<00:02:17.409> roof<00:02:17.620> I<00:02:17.830> mean<00:02:17.980> it<00:02:18.099> brings

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
because a glass roof I mean it brings

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.430 
because a glass roof I mean it brings
lots<00:02:18.519> of<00:02:18.670> light<00:02:18.879> inside<00:02:19.269> but<00:02:19.780> it<00:02:19.900> heats<00:02:20.110> up<00:02:20.290> the

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
lots of light inside but it heats up the

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.440 
lots of light inside but it heats up the
interior<00:02:20.739> so<00:02:21.220> you<00:02:21.280> need<00:02:21.610> air<00:02:21.849> conditioned<00:02:22.330> for

that<00:02:22.629> which<00:02:22.989> takes<00:02:23.260> electricity<00:02:23.980> so<00:02:24.519> well<00:02:24.970> we

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:25.239 
that which takes electricity so well we

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:27.420 
that which takes electricity so well we
won't<00:02:25.390> have<00:02:25.629> that<00:02:25.659> on<00:02:26.110> this<00:02:26.470> electric<00:02:27.040> car<00:02:27.250> and

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
won't have that on this electric car and

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.990 
won't have that on this electric car and
then<00:02:27.879> in<00:02:28.030> the<00:02:28.180> inside<00:02:28.599> we<00:02:29.110> have<00:02:29.319> very

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
then in the inside we have very

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.729 
then in the inside we have very
expensive<00:02:31.000> materials<00:02:31.599> here<00:02:31.810> on<00:02:32.049> the<00:02:32.230> show<00:02:32.470> car

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:32.739 
expensive materials here on the show car

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:34.410 
expensive materials here on the show car
which<00:02:33.220> we<00:02:33.400> don't<00:02:33.549> have<00:02:33.700> in<00:02:33.849> the<00:02:33.970> production

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
which we don't have in the production

car because one of the main aims was

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.500 
car because one of the main aims was
also<00:02:37.000> to<00:02:37.890> introduce<00:02:38.890> an<00:02:39.400> electric<00:02:39.879> car<00:02:40.060> which

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
also to introduce an electric car which

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.229 
also to introduce an electric car which
is<00:02:40.540> affordable<00:02:41.170> for<00:02:41.319> everyone<00:02:41.709> so<00:02:42.370> Zoe

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:43.239 
is affordable for everyone so Zoe

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:46.319 
is affordable for everyone so Zoe
preview<00:02:43.690> will<00:02:44.319> cost<00:02:44.650> well<00:02:45.430> about<00:02:45.730> the<00:02:45.790> the

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:46.329 
preview will cost well about the the

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:49.199 
preview will cost well about the the
equivalent<00:02:46.840> of<00:02:46.989> a<00:02:47.079> clear<00:02:47.739> diesel<00:02:48.040> or<00:02:48.459> with<00:02:49.180> a

equivalent of a clear diesel or with a
thermic<00:02:49.629> engine<00:02:49.989> so<00:02:50.530> it's<00:02:51.040> it's<00:02:51.430> really<00:02:51.609> a

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
thermic engine so it's it's really a

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.170 
thermic engine so it's it's really a
very<00:02:52.060> reasonable<00:02:52.599> pricing
