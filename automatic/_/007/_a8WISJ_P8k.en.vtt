00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.500 

let's<00:00:11.590> go<00:00:11.770> in<00:00:11.980> the<00:00:12.160> tone<00:00:12.430> map<00:00:12.639> this<00:00:13.080> image

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:15.510 
let's go in the tone map this image

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:19.450 
let's go in the tone map this image
right<00:00:16.510> here

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:19.460 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.060 

all<00:00:20.330> right<00:00:20.480> a<00:00:20.509> little<00:00:20.630> bit<00:00:20.810> washed<00:00:21.050> out<00:00:21.320> you

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:22.070 
all right a little bit washed out you

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:23.950 
all right a little bit washed out you
know<00:00:22.220> but<00:00:22.490> that's<00:00:22.640> that's<00:00:22.910> our<00:00:23.119> last<00:00:23.300> process

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:23.960 
know but that's that's our last process

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.120 
know but that's that's our last process
so<00:00:24.169> we're<00:00:24.289> going<00:00:24.410> to<00:00:24.470> actually<00:00:24.619> get<00:00:24.949> rid<00:00:25.099> of

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:25.130 
so we're going to actually get rid of

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:27.159 
so we're going to actually get rid of
that<00:00:25.369> and<00:00:25.609> start<00:00:25.939> from<00:00:26.060> the<00:00:26.480> default<00:00:26.869> setting

00:00:27.159 --> 00:00:27.169 
that and start from the default setting

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:31.389 
that and start from the default setting
again<00:00:28.090> and<00:00:29.090> I<00:00:29.960> remember<00:00:30.019> this<00:00:30.529> time<00:00:30.800> first

00:00:31.389 --> 00:00:31.399 
again and I remember this time first

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:32.709 
again and I remember this time first
thing<00:00:31.579> I<00:00:31.669> want<00:00:31.880> to<00:00:31.910> do<00:00:32.029> is<00:00:32.059> adjust<00:00:32.239> a<00:00:32.540> white

00:00:32.709 --> 00:00:32.719 
thing I want to do is adjust a white

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:36.729 
thing I want to do is adjust a white
point<00:00:32.989> in<00:00:33.079> black<00:00:33.290> point<00:00:34.420> and<00:00:35.420> if<00:00:36.170> I<00:00:36.260> want<00:00:36.530> more

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:36.739 
point in black point and if I want more

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:38.979 
point in black point and if I want more
contrast<00:00:37.370> I'll<00:00:37.640> push<00:00:37.879> them<00:00:38.120> up<00:00:38.300> quite<00:00:38.720> a<00:00:38.750> bit

00:00:38.979 --> 00:00:38.989 
contrast I'll push them up quite a bit

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:41.950 
contrast I'll push them up quite a bit
higher<00:00:39.730> there<00:00:40.730> is<00:00:40.909> a<00:00:41.059> a<00:00:41.089> school<00:00:41.449> of<00:00:41.480> thought<00:00:41.600> in

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:41.960 
higher there is a a school of thought in

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.750 
higher there is a a school of thought in
HDR<00:00:42.320> that<00:00:42.589> you<00:00:42.680> push<00:00:42.920> your<00:00:43.040> white<00:00:43.190> black<00:00:43.460> point

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:43.760 
HDR that you push your white black point

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:49.869 
HDR that you push your white black point
way<00:00:44.149> up<00:00:46.780> sometimes<00:00:47.780> yes<00:00:47.960> sometimes<00:00:48.079> no<00:00:48.790> but<00:00:49.790> it

00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:49.879 
way up sometimes yes sometimes no but it

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:52.419 
way up sometimes yes sometimes no but it
works<00:00:50.030> pretty<00:00:50.210> well<00:00:50.300> in<00:00:50.510> this<00:00:50.600> case<00:00:51.429> strength

00:00:52.419 --> 00:00:52.429 
works pretty well in this case strength

00:00:52.429 --> 00:00:54.520 
works pretty well in this case strength
will<00:00:52.579> keep<00:00:52.730> where<00:00:52.910> it<00:00:53.030> is<00:00:53.179> color<00:00:53.960> saturation

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530 
will keep where it is color saturation

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.110 
will keep where it is color saturation
will<00:00:54.920> push<00:00:55.370> up<00:00:55.550> a<00:00:55.609> little<00:00:55.820> bit<00:00:55.910> see<00:00:56.090> what

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.120 
will push up a little bit see what

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.840 
will push up a little bit see what
happens<00:00:56.570> now<00:00:57.410> again<00:00:57.649> I<00:00:57.890> want<00:00:58.309> all<00:00:58.489> of<00:00:58.550> these

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
happens now again I want all of these

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.209 
happens now again I want all of these
shots<00:00:59.089> we<00:00:59.329> have<00:00:59.510> this<00:00:59.660> great<00:01:00.019> gritty<00:01:00.469> paint

00:01:01.209 --> 00:01:01.219 
shots we have this great gritty paint

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:02.770 
shots we have this great gritty paint
chipping<00:01:01.730> sort<00:01:02.210> of<00:01:02.300> things<00:01:02.480> we're<00:01:02.600> going<00:01:02.719> to

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:02.780 
chipping sort of things we're going to

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.550 
chipping sort of things we're going to
push<00:01:02.899> the<00:01:03.019> micro<00:01:03.289> contrast<00:01:03.859> up<00:01:04.070> quite<00:01:04.580> a<00:01:04.610> bit

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:05.560 
push the micro contrast up quite a bit

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.870 
push the micro contrast up quite a bit
it<00:01:06.560> would<00:01:06.679> get<00:01:06.800> darker<00:01:07.160> again<00:01:07.429> which<00:01:07.610> is<00:01:07.759> no

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:07.880 
it would get darker again which is no

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.350 
it would get darker again which is no
big<00:01:08.060> deal<00:01:09.460> pull<00:01:10.460> the<00:01:10.550> black<00:01:10.759> point<00:01:11.060> back<00:01:11.330> a

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:11.360 
big deal pull the black point back a

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.029 
big deal pull the black point back a
little<00:01:11.570> bit<00:01:11.750> in<00:01:11.869> this<00:01:11.990> case<00:01:14.860> takes<00:01:15.860> a<00:01:15.950> few

00:01:16.029 --> 00:01:16.039 
little bit in this case takes a few

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:17.440 
little bit in this case takes a few
seconds<00:01:16.399> of<00:01:16.490> render<00:01:16.759> and<00:01:16.940> then<00:01:17.030> pull<00:01:17.300> the

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
seconds of render and then pull the

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.130 
seconds of render and then pull the
gamma<00:01:17.690> up<00:01:17.990> a<00:01:18.580> little<00:01:19.580> more<00:01:19.759> now<00:01:20.390> luminosity

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
gamma up a little more now luminosity

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.260 
gamma up a little more now luminosity
will<00:01:21.319> also<00:01:21.710> brighten<00:01:22.520> your<00:01:22.610> image<00:01:22.940> so<00:01:22.970> we're

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
will also brighten your image so we're

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.660 
will also brighten your image so we're
going<00:01:23.360> to<00:01:23.450> bring<00:01:23.659> that<00:01:23.810> up<00:01:23.869> quite<00:01:24.290> a<00:01:24.320> bit<00:01:24.670> and

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
going to bring that up quite a bit and

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.179 
going to bring that up quite a bit and
we<00:01:25.790> may<00:01:25.939> need<00:01:26.090> to<00:01:26.210> pull<00:01:26.450> the<00:01:26.890> gamma<00:01:27.890> back

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:28.189 
we may need to pull the gamma back

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:29.649 
we may need to pull the gamma back
you're<00:01:28.729> probably<00:01:28.970> seeing<00:01:29.270> by<00:01:29.450> now<00:01:29.600> that

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:29.659 
you're probably seeing by now that

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:31.510 
you're probably seeing by now that
certain<00:01:30.079> controls<00:01:30.439> work<00:01:30.649> in<00:01:30.829> tandem<00:01:31.070> if<00:01:31.430> you

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
certain controls work in tandem if you

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.179 
certain controls work in tandem if you
do<00:01:31.700> something<00:01:31.970> with<00:01:32.270> with<00:01:32.990> with<00:01:33.590> one<00:01:33.920> you<00:01:34.070> got

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:34.189 
do something with with with one you got

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:36.160 
do something with with with one you got
to<00:01:34.310> reverse<00:01:34.610> the<00:01:34.969> process<00:01:35.149> with<00:01:35.600> the<00:01:35.750> other<00:01:35.899> in

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
to reverse the process with the other in

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.590 
to reverse the process with the other in
this<00:01:37.009> case<00:01:37.250> gamma<00:01:37.490> got<00:01:37.759> pushed<00:01:38.060> up<00:01:38.270> on<00:01:38.450> them

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
this case gamma got pushed up on them

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.179 
this case gamma got pushed up on them
when<00:01:38.689> I'll<00:01:38.840> see<00:01:38.990> you<00:01:39.079> got<00:01:39.229> pushed<00:01:39.560> up<00:01:39.799> then<00:01:40.100> you

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:40.189 
when I'll see you got pushed up then you

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:42.940 
when I'll see you got pushed up then you
got<00:01:40.310> to<00:01:40.399> pull<00:01:40.520> gamma<00:01:40.790> back<00:01:41.030> down<00:01:41.240> again<00:01:41.950> get

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
got to pull gamma back down again get

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.300 
got to pull gamma back down again get
your<00:01:43.100> exposure<00:01:43.460> where<00:01:44.360> you<00:01:44.509> want<00:01:44.719> it<00:01:45.310> there

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
your exposure where you want it there

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.490 
your exposure where you want it there
you<00:01:46.369> go<00:01:46.490> a<00:01:46.670> little<00:01:46.820> more<00:01:47.000> moody<00:01:47.390> see<00:01:48.110> detail

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
you go a little more moody see detail

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.490 
you go a little more moody see detail
everywhere<00:01:48.829> we<00:01:49.700> can<00:01:49.850> bring<00:01:50.060> that<00:01:50.570> up<00:01:50.750> just<00:01:50.960> a

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
everywhere we can bring that up just a

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.029 
everywhere we can bring that up just a
notch<00:01:52.329> micro<00:01:53.329> contrast<00:01:53.840> turned<00:01:54.110> up<00:01:54.320> now<00:01:54.500> if<00:01:54.829> we

00:01:55.029 --> 00:01:55.039 
notch micro contrast turned up now if we

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:56.289 
notch micro contrast turned up now if we
change<00:01:55.310> our<00:01:55.460> light<00:01:55.640> smoothing<00:01:56.060> that<00:01:56.210> will

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:56.299 
change our light smoothing that will

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:58.090 
change our light smoothing that will
change<00:01:56.600> the<00:01:57.289> way<00:01:57.409> this<00:01:57.560> image<00:01:57.890> looks

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
change the way this image looks

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.499 
change the way this image looks
tremendously<00:01:58.930> so<00:02:00.460> the<00:02:01.460> middle<00:02:01.789> one<00:02:01.909> look<00:02:02.390> at

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:02.509 
tremendously so the middle one look at

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:04.929 
tremendously so the middle one look at
that<00:02:02.710> texture<00:02:03.710> pops<00:02:03.920> right<00:02:04.189> out<00:02:04.250> all<00:02:04.579> up<00:02:04.789> in

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:04.939 
that texture pops right out all up in

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:06.459 
that texture pops right out all up in
here<00:02:05.090> I<00:02:05.149> like<00:02:05.390> this<00:02:05.539> a<00:02:05.600> lot<00:02:05.780> i'm<00:02:06.140> going<00:02:06.259> to<00:02:06.320> keep

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:06.469 
here I like this a lot i'm going to keep

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:08.770 
here I like this a lot i'm going to keep
that<00:02:06.619> whenever<00:02:06.920> i<00:02:07.219> know<00:02:07.490> it<00:02:07.609> already<00:02:07.780> but

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
that whenever i know it already but

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.970 
that whenever i know it already but
let's<00:02:08.959> look<00:02:09.049> at<00:02:09.170> the<00:02:09.229> next<00:02:09.380> two

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.030 

you<00:02:13.940> lose<00:02:14.180> the<00:02:14.360> punch<00:02:14.629> in<00:02:14.930> the<00:02:15.440> paintings<00:02:15.890> in

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
you lose the punch in the paintings in

you lose the punch in the paintings in
the<00:02:16.129> edge<00:02:16.250> of<00:02:16.370> the<00:02:16.459> frame<00:02:16.670> and<00:02:16.909> this<00:02:17.480> should<00:02:17.629> be

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
the edge of the frame and this should be

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.490 
the edge of the frame and this should be
even<00:02:17.930> worse<00:02:18.080> for<00:02:18.799> this<00:02:18.920> image<00:02:19.280> yeah<00:02:20.500> totally

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500

but<00:04:22.380> we<00:04:22.470> maintain<00:04:22.950> detail<00:04:23.460> in<00:04:23.730> there<00:04:24.110> even

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
but we maintain detail in there even

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.070 
but we maintain detail in there even
maintain<00:04:25.470> detail<00:04:25.860> and<00:04:26.010> it's<00:04:26.100> very<00:04:26.520> dark<00:04:27.080> part

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.080 
maintain detail and it's very dark part

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:29.720 
maintain detail and it's very dark part
of<00:04:28.200> this<00:04:28.260> little<00:04:28.530> cover<00:04:28.740> here<00:04:29.070> or<00:04:29.370> like<00:04:29.490> little

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:29.730 
of this little cover here or like little

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:32.720 
of this little cover here or like little
shelf<00:04:29.970> area<00:04:30.710> what's<00:04:31.710> important<00:04:32.130> also<00:04:32.280> to

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:32.730 
shelf area what's important also to

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:33.950 
shelf area what's important also to
mention<00:04:33.120> here<00:04:33.270> is<00:04:33.300> that<00:04:33.420> this<00:04:33.660> is<00:04:33.810> one<00:04:33.930> of

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
mention here is that this is one of

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.750 
mention here is that this is one of
those<00:04:34.110> shots<00:04:34.410> that<00:04:34.590> went<00:04:34.740> two<00:04:34.950> stops<00:04:35.220> over<00:04:35.610> and

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:35.760 
those shots that went two stops over and

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:38.180 
those shots that went two stops over and
five<00:04:36.120> stops<00:04:36.450> under<00:04:36.720> that's<00:04:37.680> why<00:04:37.800> we're<00:04:37.980> able

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.190 
five stops under that's why we're able

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:39.980 
five stops under that's why we're able
to<00:04:38.310> get<00:04:38.460> that<00:04:38.610> an<00:04:38.790> incredibly<00:04:39.360> wide<00:04:39.720> dynamic

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:39.990 
to get that an incredibly wide dynamic

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:44.180 
to get that an incredibly wide dynamic
range<00:04:40.350> and<00:04:40.890> capture<00:04:41.880> detail<00:04:42.360> in<00:04:42.600> all<00:04:43.350> of<00:04:43.650> these

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:44.190 
range and capture detail in all of these

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:47.930 
range and capture detail in all of these
areas<00:04:45.050> and<00:04:46.400> that's<00:04:47.400> I'm<00:04:47.610> going<00:04:47.730> to<00:04:47.790> I'm<00:04:47.880> going

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
areas and that's I'm going to I'm going

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:51.410 
areas and that's I'm going to I'm going
to<00:04:48.090> keep<00:04:48.270> that<00:04:48.450> but<00:04:48.870> that's<00:04:49.080> very<00:04:49.320> nice
