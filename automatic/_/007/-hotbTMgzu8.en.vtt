this is a match using the m16 on c-town

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:16.000 
this is a match using the m16 on c-town
c-town<00:00:14.390> is<00:00:14.450> a<00:00:14.660> very<00:00:15.170> very<00:00:15.440> tight<00:00:15.740> close

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:16.010

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:17.530 
c-town is a very very tight close
quarters<00:00:16.400> map<00:00:16.610> so<00:00:16.790> using<00:00:17.090> something<00:00:17.300> like<00:00:17.390> the

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:17.540 
quarters map so using something like the

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:20.650 
quarters map so using something like the
m16<00:00:18.140> is<00:00:18.350> a<00:00:18.800> challenge<00:00:19.490> this<00:00:19.700> is<00:00:19.760> not<00:00:20.090> easy<00:00:20.480> to

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:20.660 
m16 is a challenge this is not easy to

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.980 
m16 is a challenge this is not easy to
use<00:00:20.990> because<00:00:21.260> to<00:00:21.650> the<00:00:21.710> m16<00:00:22.340> to<00:00:23.210> be<00:00:23.360> consistent

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:23.990 
use because to the m16 to be consistent

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:25.390 
use because to the m16 to be consistent
I<00:00:24.050> mean<00:00:24.230> you<00:00:24.349> can<00:00:24.500> run<00:00:24.710> around<00:00:24.830> with<00:00:25.009> this<00:00:25.189> gun

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:25.400 
I mean you can run around with this gun

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.370 
I mean you can run around with this gun
you<00:00:25.849> can<00:00:26.029> do<00:00:26.150> well<00:00:26.360> with<00:00:26.390> it<00:00:26.540> at<00:00:26.750> times<00:00:26.930> but

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:27.380 
you can do well with it at times but

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.050 
you can do well with it at times but
it's<00:00:27.560> not<00:00:27.740> gonna<00:00:27.919> be<00:00:28.160> something<00:00:28.430> you<00:00:28.610> can<00:00:28.730> rely

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:29.060 
it's not gonna be something you can rely

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.780 
it's not gonna be something you can rely
on<00:00:29.110> to<00:00:30.110> really<00:00:30.380> rely<00:00:30.650> on<00:00:30.680> the<00:00:30.890> m16<00:00:31.369> you<00:00:31.490> have<00:00:31.640> to

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:31.790 
on to really rely on the m16 you have to

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:33.580 
on to really rely on the m16 you have to
understand<00:00:32.360> spacing<00:00:32.900> and<00:00:33.140> you<00:00:33.260> know<00:00:33.380> how<00:00:33.530> to

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:33.590 
understand spacing and you know how to

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.550 
understand spacing and you know how to
keep<00:00:33.829> me<00:00:34.280> away<00:00:34.490> from<00:00:34.520> you<00:00:35.079> because<00:00:36.079> as<00:00:36.290> you<00:00:36.410> see

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:36.560 
keep me away from you because as you see

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:37.930 
keep me away from you because as you see
whenever<00:00:36.770> I<00:00:36.950> get<00:00:37.010> close<00:00:37.250> to<00:00:37.460> an<00:00:37.550> enemy<00:00:37.670> to<00:00:37.880> see

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:37.940 
whenever I get close to an enemy to see

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.240 
whenever I get close to an enemy to see
how<00:00:38.030> inconsistent<00:00:38.780> it<00:00:38.930> is<00:00:39.110> up<00:00:39.320> close<00:00:39.470> it<00:00:40.100> has

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:40.250 
how inconsistent it is up close it has

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:41.860 
how inconsistent it is up close it has
lots<00:00:40.460> to<00:00:40.580> do<00:00:40.700> with<00:00:40.730> internet<00:00:41.210> connection<00:00:41.240> I

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:41.870 
lots to do with internet connection I

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:43.990 
lots to do with internet connection I
mean<00:00:42.080> it<00:00:42.260> has<00:00:42.380> a<00:00:42.410> lot<00:00:42.710> to<00:00:42.980> do<00:00:43.130> with<00:00:43.340> the<00:00:43.520> lag<00:00:43.760> in

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:44.000 
mean it has a lot to do with the lag in

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000 
mean it has a lot to do with the lag in
the<00:00:44.120> game<00:00:44.150> how<00:00:45.020> bad<00:00:45.230> the<00:00:45.410> enemies<00:00:45.680> are<00:00:45.830> lagging

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 
the game how bad the enemies are lagging

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.310 
the game how bad the enemies are lagging
so<00:00:47.000> to<00:00:47.060> really<00:00:47.390> just<00:00:47.630> compensate<00:00:48.140> for<00:00:48.260> that

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:48.320 
so to really just compensate for that

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.400 
so to really just compensate for that
you<00:00:48.770> want<00:00:48.980> to<00:00:49.070> keep<00:00:49.220> just<00:00:49.460> a<00:00:49.640> good<00:00:50.200> medium<00:00:51.200> to

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:51.410 
you want to keep just a good medium to

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:53.590 
you want to keep just a good medium to
long<00:00:51.590> range<00:00:52.030> distance<00:00:53.030> between<00:00:53.210> you<00:00:53.420> and<00:00:53.450> the

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 
long range distance between you and the

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.630 
long range distance between you and the
enemy<00:00:53.630> at<00:00:53.930> all<00:00:54.050> times<00:00:54.320> so<00:00:54.650> what<00:00:55.220> that<00:00:55.310> equates

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
enemy at all times so what that equates

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.700 
enemy at all times so what that equates
to<00:00:55.790> on<00:00:56.180> c-town<00:00:56.600> that<00:00:56.990> means<00:00:57.200> you're<00:00:57.350> gonna<00:00:57.440> end

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:57.710 
to on c-town that means you're gonna end

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.220 
to on c-town that means you're gonna end
up<00:00:57.860> camping<00:00:58.670> a<00:00:58.760> lot<00:00:58.900> basically<00:00:59.900> what<00:01:00.140> I'm

commentary I have mixed thoughts on

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:16.599 
commentary I have mixed thoughts on
spawn<00:01:15.409> trapping<00:01:15.710> and<00:01:15.979> those<00:01:16.070> of<00:01:16.219> you<00:01:16.310> that<00:01:16.490> are

00:01:16.599 --> 00:01:16.609 
spawn trapping and those of you that are

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:18.520 
spawn trapping and those of you that are
new<00:01:16.789> to<00:01:16.820> call<00:01:17.299> of<00:01:17.420> duty<00:01:17.659> and<00:01:17.780> modern<00:01:18.229> warfare<00:01:18.350> 3

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
new to call of duty and modern warfare 3

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.739 
new to call of duty and modern warfare 3
is<00:01:18.770> your<00:01:18.920> first<00:01:19.249> ever<00:01:22.210> game<00:01:23.210> that<00:01:23.359> you<00:01:23.509> played

00:01:23.739 --> 00:01:23.749 
is your first ever game that you played

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:27.270 
is your first ever game that you played
from<00:01:24.049> either<00:01:24.619> Treyarch<00:01:25.310> or<00:01:25.520> infinity<00:01:26.390> ward

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.280 
from either Treyarch or infinity ward

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.889 
from either Treyarch or infinity ward
spawn<00:01:28.280> trapping<00:01:28.579> is<00:01:28.850> basically<00:01:29.299> when<00:01:29.810> you

00:01:29.889 --> 00:01:29.899 
spawn trapping is basically when you

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:32.770 
spawn trapping is basically when you
play<00:01:30.109> domination<00:01:30.799> and<00:01:30.979> you<00:01:31.039> keep<00:01:31.939> them<00:01:32.149> on<00:01:32.359> one

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
play domination and you keep them on one

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.450 
play domination and you keep them on one
side<00:01:33.049> of<00:01:33.170> the<00:01:33.259> map<00:01:33.439> you<00:01:33.679> hold<00:01:33.950> two<00:01:34.219> of<00:01:34.249> the

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
side of the map you hold two of the

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.520 
side of the map you hold two of the
flags<00:01:34.759> and<00:01:35.119> then<00:01:35.569> you<00:01:35.719> trap<00:01:36.020> them<00:01:36.200> on<00:01:36.409> the

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
flags and then you trap them on the

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.559 
flags and then you trap them on the
other<00:01:36.649> side<00:01:36.920> so<00:01:37.189> that<00:01:37.340> they<00:01:37.490> can't<00:01:37.819> get<00:01:38.179> out<00:01:38.420> of

00:01:38.559 --> 00:01:38.569 
other side so that they can't get out of

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:40.090 
other side so that they can't get out of
their<00:01:38.719> spawn<00:01:38.990> they<00:01:39.229> can't<00:01:39.499> capture<00:01:39.979> that

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
their spawn they can't capture that

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.309 
their spawn they can't capture that
second<00:01:40.520> flag<00:01:40.729> and<00:01:41.090> you're<00:01:41.869> essentially

00:01:42.309 --> 00:01:42.319 
second flag and you're essentially

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:43.899 
second flag and you're essentially
guaranteed<00:01:42.829> a<00:01:42.920> victory<00:01:43.219> because<00:01:43.579> the<00:01:43.729> win

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:43.909 
guaranteed a victory because the win

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
mean you can literally push up to the

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:11.440 
mean you can literally push up to the
point<00:03:10.190> where<00:03:10.400> they're<00:03:10.520> actually<00:03:10.670> spawning<00:03:11.240> in

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
point where they're actually spawning in

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:12.970 
point where they're actually spawning in
front<00:03:11.660> of<00:03:11.750> you<00:03:11.870> you<00:03:12.080> can<00:03:12.260> knife<00:03:12.500> them<00:03:12.770> as

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
front of you you can knife them as

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.180 
front of you you can knife them as
they're<00:03:13.220> spawning<00:03:13.520> and<00:03:14.650> it<00:03:15.650> was<00:03:15.800> just<00:03:16.010> pretty

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
they're spawning and it was just pretty

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.370 
they're spawning and it was just pretty
stupid<00:03:16.550> but<00:03:17.240> my<00:03:17.390> thoughts<00:03:17.660> on<00:03:17.840> spawn<00:03:18.080> trapping

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380 
stupid but my thoughts on spawn trapping

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:21.070 
stupid but my thoughts on spawn trapping
I<00:03:18.710> don't<00:03:19.580> know<00:03:19.760> I<00:03:20.030> think<00:03:20.420> it's<00:03:20.750> kind<00:03:20.810> of<00:03:21.020> a

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:21.080 
I don't know I think it's kind of a

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:23.050 
I don't know I think it's kind of a
necessary<00:03:21.290> evil<00:03:21.710> I<00:03:22.160> mean<00:03:22.580> when<00:03:22.790> you<00:03:22.880> play

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
necessary evil I mean when you play

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:24.550 
necessary evil I mean when you play
against<00:03:23.300> good<00:03:23.450> players<00:03:23.570> you<00:03:24.050> kind<00:03:24.260> of<00:03:24.350> have<00:03:24.530> to

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
against good players you kind of have to

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.560 
against good players you kind of have to
spawn<00:03:24.890> trap<00:03:25.130> them<00:03:25.310> but<00:03:25.790> when<00:03:25.910> you<00:03:25.940> when<00:03:26.300> you<00:03:26.420> do

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:26.570 
spawn trap them but when you when you do

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:28.960 
spawn trap them but when you when you do
like<00:03:27.080> this<00:03:27.230> gameplay<00:03:27.440> here<00:03:27.830> for<00:03:28.010> example<00:03:28.250> when

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
like this gameplay here for example when

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:30.310 
like this gameplay here for example when
you<00:03:29.060> play<00:03:29.240> against<00:03:29.510> noobs<00:03:29.720> I<00:03:30.020> mean<00:03:30.140> some<00:03:30.290> of

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:30.320 
you play against noobs I mean some of

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:32.170 
you play against noobs I mean some of
these<00:03:30.440> guys<00:03:30.500> on<00:03:30.890> the<00:03:30.980> other<00:03:31.010> team<00:03:31.130> are<00:03:31.430> decent

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
these guys on the other team are decent

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.480 
these guys on the other team are decent
you<00:03:32.330> know<00:03:32.450> they're<00:03:32.570> not<00:03:32.690> bad<00:03:32.870> 1.5<00:03:33.620> k<00:03:33.860> ds<00:03:34.040> maybe

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:34.490 
you know they're not bad 1.5 k ds maybe

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:36.580 
you know they're not bad 1.5 k ds maybe
2<00:03:34.790> k<00:03:35.000> ds<00:03:35.180> every<00:03:35.900> now<00:03:36.020> and<00:03:36.170> then<00:03:36.230> but<00:03:36.350> then<00:03:36.470> you

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
2 k ds every now and then but then you

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:38.110 
2 k ds every now and then but then you
get<00:03:36.710> the<00:03:36.890> really<00:03:37.130> bad<00:03:37.250> split<00:03:37.610> screeners<00:03:37.970> that

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
get the really bad split screeners that

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.180 
get the really bad split screeners that
go<00:03:38.210> like<00:03:38.390> two<00:03:38.660> and<00:03:38.840> thirty<00:03:39.050> and<00:03:39.530> that<00:03:39.980> kind<00:03:40.160> of

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
go like two and thirty and that kind of

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.070 
go like two and thirty and that kind of
ruins<00:03:40.460> it<00:03:40.520> for<00:03:40.580> the<00:03:40.760> team<00:03:40.940> I<00:03:41.150> think<00:03:41.780> it's

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:42.080 
ruins it for the team I think it's

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.080 
ruins it for the team I think it's
necessary<00:03:42.320> to<00:03:42.770> trap<00:03:43.130> a<00:03:43.310> good<00:03:43.520> team<00:03:43.700> but<00:03:43.730> when

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.090 
necessary to trap a good team but when

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:45.310 
necessary to trap a good team but when
you<00:03:44.180> when<00:03:44.450> you're<00:03:44.570> doing<00:03:44.660> this<00:03:44.930> like<00:03:45.170> we're

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:45.320

you when you're doing this like we're
doing<00:03:45.500> here<00:03:45.830> I<00:03:45.980> think<00:03:46.250> it's<00:03:46.370> pretty<00:03:46.580> damn<00:03:46.850> lame

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090
