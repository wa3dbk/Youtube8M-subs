00:00:01.479 --> 00:00:04.040
 so it's just barber like I said 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.650
 it was a pm and allow a half breed 

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:10.219
 I slept very poorly 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:11.329
 this impact 

00:00:11.329 --> 00:00:12.099
 south 

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:14.349
 the blood feeds on the blood 

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:18.309
 of wild animals from domestic animals - the blood also 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.380
 noting that deleting 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:22.539
 he defends home 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:26.389
 I went to the woods for more than 30 years through their 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:28.439
 parts 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.260
 the patient with the Chavez disease presents in the chronic phase some 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.670
 symptoms like academic inpe 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.039
 increase the heart but we will also find an increase in the 

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:42.589
 connected changes 

00:00:42.589 --> 00:00:45.980
 Inguinal blood circulation 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:51.120
 and this patient is slowly reducing these activities 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.140
 so today there are many treatments that will 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:55.740
 controlling the disease 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.740
 but this alias that is diminishing these activities 

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:02.740
 due to the increase in the number of 

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:04.489
 in 30 years one with 11 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.570
 in this circulatory system if the nervous system also 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:12.210
 now another very important disease a disease that is very serious is the 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.390
 malaria 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.520
 and we'll talk a little bit about the symptoms of this disease and 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.520
 their biological cycles 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.200
 remembering that malaria is also caused by a protozoan 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:28.000
 and recognized as a poor yield generated protozoan that causes 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.219
 malaria 

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:30.880
 it's the plasmodium 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.880
 Let's get to know a bit more about the malaria cycle. 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.890
 then malaria it is transmitted by a mosquito 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.689
 let's celebrate, we have a center there now for a person with 

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:45.079
 the shapes 

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:48.240
 of the plasmodium protozoa in the bloodstream 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.049
 so I searched for tuguÃ¡ new films also known as skate nail 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:56.049
 I'm leaving an infected person 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.729
 with the now protozoan forms 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.830
 caren the mosquito's digestive tract 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:04.649
 so now to Mayan 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.149
 Let's set goals. 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.350
 male r female 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:11.469
 so we're going to have the training now 

00:02:11.469 --> 00:02:13.770
 the male and female gametes 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.659
 I give dishes the air 

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:19.649
 reproduction then I know your life with mosquito tissue ' 

00:02:20.689 --> 00:02:21.499
 cooper 

00:02:21.499 --> 00:02:24.829
 fertilization of the Xingu formation 

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:26.300
 the zygote now 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:27.980
 will settle 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.289
 Mourinho have teaching 

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:31.409
 of the mosquito ' 

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:33.339
 and begins to reproduce 

00:02:33.339 --> 00:02:38.520
 forming the forms known as spores 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.029
 with you so soon 

00:02:40.029 --> 00:02:43.539
 the spurs and three double sporozoites 

00:02:43.539 --> 00:02:46.639
 ruptured the diseased cells had 

00:02:46.639 --> 00:02:50.749
 karina circulation and will stop silence home 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:53.519
 of the mosquito 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:54.629
 so folks 

00:02:54.629 --> 00:03:00.439
 I did not seek everything we have the cycle of the sexual reproduction of the plasmodium 

00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:02.349
 You forgot that this is important. 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:07.390
 then we talk to the fifth and it is considered as definitive host 

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:08.930
 with malaria 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:10.040
 because I cut 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.689
 repression getting married 

00:03:11.689 --> 00:03:14.529
 Now let's continue our keninha. 

00:03:14.529 --> 00:03:16.009
 when the 'mosquito' 

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:18.809
 and here is a person who has no disease 

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:22.779
 to probe the blood he does not with a home a substance 

00:03:22.779 --> 00:03:24.319
 other commanders 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:27.679
 present in mosquito saliva 

00:03:27.679 --> 00:03:29.839
 this substance 

00:03:29.839 --> 00:03:33.219
 present in the leg in the saliva that immaculates in the patient 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:38.029
 she who is taking the sporozoite forms 

00:03:38.029 --> 00:03:41.049
 as Olympic spores for further 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:42.279
 from sandy 

00:03:42.279 --> 00:03:43.919
 person's 

00:03:43.919 --> 00:03:47.040
 who was not infected person who was bitten peruano 

00:03:48.339 --> 00:03:53.509
 these forms now go straight to the citrus duck through the service 

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:56.509
 taken to the blue saw 

00:03:57.559 --> 00:04:01.109
 and there reproduce themselves in order to sec their life 

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:04.030
 speaking the first volunteers 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.499
 the first or irritating forms 

00:04:06.499 --> 00:04:11.579
 these surreal wind mere memos and now 12 400 

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:15.330
 does not seem but forget the blood collection 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:18.320
 and also reproduce aptly 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.159
 forming Olympic standards 

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:24.360
 that go to the whole region in Brazil 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.930
 invading new and softness 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:31.069
 do not interfere with the red blood cells we will now have the formation 

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:35.180
 it is reported that they will later be Islamic 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:36.020
 female 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:37.430
 and masculine 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:41.629
 so folks at the moment we're going to have the breeding 

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:43.370
 acec is only long 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:46.470
 then we have - or items short of fights and masses 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:51.900
 bursting the flame on, reproducing from speaking to sweat 

00:04:52.509 --> 00:04:56.690
 salads and pasta the slow-moving branches get accustomed to a new relationship 

00:04:57.539 --> 00:05:01.990
 by coincidence at the time they break the red blood cells you notice 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:05.100
 What happened? 

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:06.310
 the patient has a 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:07.120
 ferri 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.560
 about 40 roosters 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.470
 such as intense sweating 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:12.879
 tremors 

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:17.730
 and with this we are characterizing malaria with marital access 

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:19.909
 keter parker positive 

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:23.199
 of 48 hours and 48 hours and some patients 

00:05:23.719 --> 00:05:31.099
 at 72 hours and 72 hours is also 36 hours in 36 hours depending on the 

00:05:31.099 --> 00:05:34.840
 I've decided to stop the patient. 

00:05:35.539 --> 00:05:40.159
 Now let's finish ours then mine, for you, do not forget the 

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:43.159
 Important details please note 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:48.960
 then malaria she has as intermediate host 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:50.010
 The man 

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:52.330
 do not forget the reproduction a little 

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:53.969
 to your life 

00:05:53.969 --> 00:05:55.560
 after losing definitively 

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:56.700
 it's a mosquito 

00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:00.020
 and transmission occurs through the bite of the 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:00.969
 moskito 

00:06:00.969 --> 00:06:03.460
 dollar at the end says 

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:07.029
 then I ask the Nato to malaria is a very important disease 

00:06:07.029 --> 00:06:11.749
 The main symptom is malaria access, remembering that depending on the type and 

00:06:11.749 --> 00:06:15.180
 where the patient's check-up period is 

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:18.860
 is that we are going to have here in the intervals deny fÃ©drigo to cesumar 

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:23.320
 very well I would like this deep just a little bit more 

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:25.130
 on diseases 

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:29.320
 the parasites caused by these christie lights dishes larger than the same 

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:31.349
 for important sectors 

00:06:31.349 --> 00:06:34.349
 Neither do I await you for our next biology class. 

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:35.919
 even heavier
