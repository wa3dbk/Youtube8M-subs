environmental nature center that's how
you<00:00:37.890> get<00:00:38.070> there<00:00:38.309> which<00:00:38.640> is<00:00:38.670> sort<00:00:39.210> of<00:00:39.270> very

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
you get there which is sort of very

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.340 
you get there which is sort of very
close<00:00:39.780> to<00:00:41.000> Newport<00:00:42.000> Beach<00:00:42.149> High<00:00:42.300> School<00:00:42.329> in<00:00:42.840> on

close to Newport Beach High School in on

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.209 
close to Newport Beach High School in on
seven<00:00:43.980> sixteenth<00:00:44.520> Street<00:00:44.820> in<00:00:45.800> Costa<00:00:46.800> Mesa<00:00:46.920> and

seven sixteenth Street in Costa Mesa and
Newport<00:00:47.579> Beach<00:00:47.730> so<00:00:47.760> I<00:00:47.940> guess<00:00:48.210> it's<00:00:48.420> not<00:00:48.629> not

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
Newport Beach so I guess it's not not

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.319 
Newport Beach so I guess it's not not
quite<00:00:49.379> ready<00:00:49.680> yet<00:00:49.770> but<00:00:50.190> it's<00:00:50.610> looking<00:00:50.760> good

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
quite ready yet but it's looking good

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.810 
quite ready yet but it's looking good
from<00:00:51.660> where<00:00:51.809> it's<00:00:51.960> going<00:00:52.260> and<00:00:52.469> it's<00:00:53.430> going<00:00:53.699> to

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
from where it's going and it's going to

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.060 
from where it's going and it's going to
be<00:00:53.969> it's<00:00:54.180> going<00:00:54.300> to<00:00:54.629> be<00:00:54.690> amazing<00:00:57.739> this<00:00:58.739> is<00:00:58.920> what

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
be it's going to be amazing this is what

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.490 
be it's going to be amazing this is what
it<00:00:59.160> looks<00:00:59.309> like<00:00:59.489> now

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.020 

that's<00:01:05.190> what<00:01:05.430> it's<00:01:05.550> going<00:01:05.730> to<00:01:05.820> look<00:01:05.910> like

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
that's what it's going to look like

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:12.010 
that's what it's going to look like
later

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.100 

this<00:01:13.020> is<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.290> desert<00:01:13.650> portion<00:01:15.020> there's<00:01:16.020> a

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
this is the desert portion there's a

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.460 
this is the desert portion there's a
display<00:01:16.620> on<00:01:16.860> on<00:01:17.580> why<00:01:17.970> native<00:01:18.450> plants<00:01:18.960> we're

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
display on on why native plants we're

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.320 
display on on why native plants we're
here<00:01:21.260> and<00:01:22.260> question<00:01:23.130> is<00:01:23.250> why<00:01:23.550> have<00:01:23.880> native

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
here and question is why have native

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.920 
here and question is why have native
plants<00:01:24.840> well<00:01:25.190> once<00:01:26.190> you<00:01:26.340> understand<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:27.600> the

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
plants well once you understand the the

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.650 
plants well once you understand the the
habitat<00:01:28.800> was<00:01:29.580> healthy<00:01:30.120> and<00:01:30.150> needs<00:01:30.450> to<00:01:30.570> be

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:30.660 
habitat was healthy and needs to be

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:33.380 
habitat was healthy and needs to be
healthy<00:01:31.080> again<00:01:31.170> it's<00:01:32.040> pretty<00:01:32.220> obvious<00:01:32.730> why<00:01:33.150> we

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
healthy again it's pretty obvious why we

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.330 
healthy again it's pretty obvious why we
have<00:01:33.540> to<00:01:33.690> have<00:01:33.780> native<00:01:34.050> plants<00:01:34.440> we<00:01:35.070> have<00:01:35.220> to

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
have to have native plants we have to

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.850 
have to have native plants we have to
have<00:01:35.430> at<00:01:35.520> least<00:01:35.550> a<00:01:36.500> presence<00:01:37.500> of<00:01:37.620> all<00:01:37.740> the

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
have at least a presence of all the

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.250 
have at least a presence of all the
things<00:01:38.070> that<00:01:38.310> used<00:01:38.460> to<00:01:38.550> be<00:01:38.730> here<00:01:38.990> story<00:01:39.990> it's

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:40.260 
things that used to be here story it's

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.230 
things that used to be here story it's
very<00:01:40.470> difficult<00:01:40.710> to<00:01:41.130> establish<00:01:41.280> these<00:01:41.850> native

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
very difficult to establish these native

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.590 
very difficult to establish these native
plants<00:01:42.440> in<00:01:43.440> their<00:01:43.979> symbiotic<00:01:44.670> relationships

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
plants in their symbiotic relationships

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.870 
plants in their symbiotic relationships
because<00:01:46.080> that<00:01:46.290> was<00:01:46.470> usually<00:01:47.250> built<00:01:47.520> up<00:01:47.729> over

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
because that was usually built up over

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.300 
because that was usually built up over
centuries<00:01:48.060> so<00:01:48.780> to<00:01:48.840> recreate<00:01:49.320> that<00:01:49.650> is<00:01:49.920> very

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
centuries so to recreate that is very

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:57.050 
centuries so to recreate that is very
very<00:01:50.520> difficult<00:01:53.210> and<00:01:54.830> this<00:01:55.830> is<00:01:56.040> why<00:01:56.310> this<00:01:56.820> is

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
very difficult and this is why this is

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.840 
very difficult and this is why this is
the<00:01:57.270> food<00:01:57.540> web<00:01:57.840> which<00:01:58.740> is<00:01:59.190> always<00:01:59.550> very

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
the food web which is always very

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.300 
the food web which is always very
complicated<00:02:00.630> particular<00:02:01.229> plants<00:02:01.830> feed<00:02:02.070> on

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
complicated particular plants feed on

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.150 
complicated particular plants feed on
each<00:02:02.340> other<00:02:02.670> little<00:02:03.300> little<00:02:03.720> insects<00:02:04.350> carry

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:05.160 
each other little little insects carry

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.219 
each other little little insects carry
pollen<00:02:05.940> from<00:02:06.090> one<00:02:06.180> to<00:02:06.420> the<00:02:06.479> other<00:02:06.570> and<00:02:06.930> need

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
pollen from one to the other and need

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.320 
pollen from one to the other and need
one<00:02:07.470> plant<00:02:07.830> and<00:02:08.369> go<00:02:08.550> to<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:08.790> other<00:02:08.910> one<00:02:09.000> the

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
one plant and go to the other one the

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.320 
one plant and go to the other one the
other<00:02:09.360> one<00:02:09.540> depends<00:02:10.320> on<00:02:10.440> those<00:02:10.590> insects<00:02:11.330> so

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
other one depends on those insects so

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.330 
other one depends on those insects so
this<00:02:12.540> this<00:02:12.840> complicated<00:02:13.380> food<00:02:13.709> web<00:02:13.950> which<00:02:14.190> we

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
this this complicated food web which we

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.850 
this this complicated food web which we
really<00:02:14.610> don't<00:02:14.730> understand<00:02:15.330> yet<00:02:15.570> who<00:02:15.959> is<00:02:16.650> the

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
really don't understand yet who is the

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.260 
really don't understand yet who is the
thing<00:02:17.070> with<00:02:17.250> that<00:02:17.400> is<00:02:17.550> very<00:02:17.760> difficult<00:02:17.940> to

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
thing with that is very difficult to

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.690 
thing with that is very difficult to
build<00:02:18.420> up<00:02:18.690> this<00:02:19.290> display<00:02:19.830> talks<00:02:20.220> about<00:02:20.550> the

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
build up this display talks about the

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.760 
build up this display talks about the
vanishing<00:02:21.180> habitat<00:02:21.690> you<00:02:22.140> know<00:02:22.230> we<00:02:22.350> save<00:02:22.620> a

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
vanishing habitat you know we save a

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.920 
vanishing habitat you know we save a
tiny<00:02:23.070> bit<00:02:23.400> of<00:02:23.610> the<00:02:23.700> habitat<00:02:24.150> for<00:02:24.390> instance<00:02:24.720> for

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
tiny bit of the habitat for instance for

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.440 
tiny bit of the habitat for instance for
a<00:02:24.959> frog<00:02:25.290> and<00:02:25.650> then<00:02:26.340> we're<00:02:26.790> not<00:02:26.910> aware<00:02:27.090> of<00:02:27.269> the

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
a frog and then we're not aware of the

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.140 
a frog and then we're not aware of the
fact<00:02:27.690> that<00:02:27.810> before<00:02:28.470> before<00:02:29.100> we<00:02:29.340> saved<00:02:29.640> it<00:02:29.850> that

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
fact that before before we saved it that

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.509 
fact that before before we saved it that
frog<00:02:30.480> depended<00:02:31.110> upon<00:02:31.200> emergency<00:02:32.010> spaces

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:32.519 
frog depended upon emergency spaces

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:35.030 
frog depended upon emergency spaces
somewhere<00:02:32.850> else<00:02:33.030> during<00:02:33.510> say<00:02:34.260> it<00:02:34.410> 100<00:02:34.860> year

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
somewhere else during say it 100 year

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.880 
somewhere else during say it 100 year
flood<00:02:35.239> so<00:02:36.239> that<00:02:36.480> the<00:02:36.680> relationships<00:02:37.680> are<00:02:37.860> very

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
flood so that the relationships are very

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.979 
flood so that the relationships are very
complicated<00:02:38.700> and<00:02:38.970> the<00:02:39.360> amount<00:02:39.660> of<00:02:39.750> green

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
complicated and the amount of green

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:42.440 
complicated and the amount of green
space<00:02:40.290> that<00:02:40.560> we<00:02:40.680> leave<00:02:40.920> the<00:02:41.790> amount<00:02:42.060> of<00:02:42.150> native

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
plants that we leave sometimes isn't

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.180 
plants that we leave sometimes isn't
enough<00:02:44.430> there's<00:02:45.239> vanishing<00:02:45.930> habitat<00:02:46.440> take<00:02:47.160> a

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
enough there's vanishing habitat take a

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.190 
enough there's vanishing habitat take a
look<00:02:47.370> at<00:02:47.519> this<00:02:47.640> map<00:02:47.700> well<00:02:48.300> that's<00:02:48.840> that<00:02:49.019> that's

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
look at this map well that's that that's

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.509 
look at this map well that's that that's
the<00:02:49.440> problem<00:02:49.709> is<00:02:49.920> that<00:02:50.070> there's<00:02:50.220> too<00:02:50.400> much

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:50.519 
the problem is that there's too much

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:52.670 
the problem is that there's too much
development<00:02:51.060> so<00:02:51.989> these<00:02:52.170> are<00:02:52.230> these<00:02:52.620> are

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
development so these are these are

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.770 
development so these are these are
educational<00:02:53.459> displays<00:02:53.820> which<00:02:54.239> are<00:02:54.450> really

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
educational displays which are really

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.690 
educational displays which are really
belong<00:02:55.230> or<00:02:55.500> a<00:02:55.530> high<00:02:55.680> school<00:02:55.950> pretty<00:02:56.160> amazing

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
belong or a high school pretty amazing

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.949 
belong or a high school pretty amazing
the<00:02:56.910> cactus<00:02:57.810> grows<00:02:58.140> in<00:02:59.100> Costa<00:02:59.580> Mesa<00:02:59.700> a<00:03:00.150> Newport

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
the cactus grows in Costa Mesa a Newport

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:04.009 
the cactus grows in Costa Mesa a Newport
Beach<00:03:01.110> here<00:03:02.070> it<00:03:02.130> is<00:03:02.250> under<00:03:02.489> construction<00:03:03.019> you

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
Beach here it is under construction you

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:08.020 
Beach here it is under construction you
can<00:03:04.200> see<00:03:04.440> that<00:03:04.470> this<00:03:04.769> is<00:03:05.010> the<00:03:05.750> planting<00:03:06.750> area

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
can see that this is the planting area

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:12.199 
can see that this is the planting area
there<00:03:09.030> is<00:03:09.150> composting<00:03:09.900> bins<00:03:10.670> it's<00:03:11.670> very<00:03:11.970> close

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
there is composting bins it's very close

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:14.180 
there is composting bins it's very close
to<00:03:12.239> the<00:03:12.390> school<00:03:12.750> and<00:03:12.810> this<00:03:13.200> is<00:03:13.410> this<00:03:13.709> is<00:03:13.890> one<00:03:14.069> of

to the school and this is this is one of
our<00:03:14.310> dreams<00:03:14.730> is<00:03:15.140> to<00:03:16.140> have<00:03:16.319> every<00:03:16.860> school

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
our dreams is to have every school

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.890 
our dreams is to have every school
combine<00:03:18.480> the<00:03:18.720> composting<00:03:19.410> facility<00:03:19.950> and<00:03:20.900> here

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
combine the composting facility and here

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.940 
combine the composting facility and here
is<00:03:22.140> their<00:03:22.319> solar<00:03:22.590> system<00:03:23.930> we<00:03:24.930> see<00:03:25.110> it's<00:03:25.260> a<00:03:25.410> 24

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
is their solar system we see it's a 24

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:30.370 
is their solar system we see it's a 24

here's so here's a panorama what it
looks<00:03:53.650> like<00:03:53.830> now<00:03:57.930> is<00:03:58.930> it<00:03:59.110> parking<00:03:59.620> space<00:03:59.770> for

00:03:59.910 --> 00:03:59.920 
looks like now is it parking space for

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.180 
looks like now is it parking space for
