00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
been a long time since I've seen

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.449 
been a long time since I've seen
breaking<00:03:24.510> bad<00:03:24.540> like<00:03:24.840> I<00:03:25.019> mean<00:03:25.379> usually<00:03:25.739> saw

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
breaking bad like I mean usually saw

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:27.949 
breaking bad like I mean usually saw
wasn't<00:03:26.699> the<00:03:26.849> main<00:03:27.000> focus<00:03:27.359> and<00:03:27.449> he<00:03:27.510> wasn't<00:03:27.750> the

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
wasn't the main focus and he wasn't the

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:29.960 
wasn't the main focus and he wasn't the
main<00:03:28.109> focus<00:03:28.530> of<00:03:28.650> the<00:03:28.889> series<00:03:29.250> so<00:03:29.579> it's<00:03:29.760> kind<00:03:29.909> of

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
main focus of the series so it's kind of

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.539 
main focus of the series so it's kind of
easy<00:03:30.269> to<00:03:30.389> forget<00:03:30.750> something<00:03:31.139> like<00:03:31.169> that<00:03:31.349> but<00:03:32.220> I

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 
easy to forget something like that but I

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:35.500 
easy to forget something like that but I
don't<00:03:32.760> think<00:03:32.909> chuck<00:03:33.239> was<00:03:33.419> ever<00:03:33.720> mentioned<00:03:34.590> in

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510

breaking battle we get to see how he is

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:51.439 
breaking battle we get to see how he is
he's<00:03:50.099> pretty<00:03:50.280> much<00:03:50.459> in<00:03:50.639> that<00:03:50.699> slippin<00:03:51.239> Jimmy

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:51.449 
he's pretty much in that slippin Jimmy

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:53.689 
he's pretty much in that slippin Jimmy
top<00:03:51.810> phase<00:03:52.169> and<00:03:52.560> so<00:03:53.069> we're<00:03:53.250> getting<00:03:53.459> to<00:03:53.549> see

00:03:53.689 --> 00:03:53.699 
top phase and so we're getting to see

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:55.909 
top phase and so we're getting to see
him<00:03:53.729> progress<00:03:53.940> back<00:03:54.419> into<00:03:54.629> that<00:03:54.750> phase<00:03:55.049> but<00:03:55.680> as

00:03:55.909 --> 00:03:55.919 
him progress back into that phase but as

00:03:55.919 --> 00:03:59.420 
him progress back into that phase but as
a<00:03:55.979> more<00:03:56.430> intelligent<00:03:56.819> human<00:03:57.389> being<00:03:57.690> so<00:03:58.430> I

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
a more intelligent human being so I

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.089 
a more intelligent human being so I
wonder<00:04:00.060> how<00:04:00.540> the<00:04:00.599> conflict<00:04:01.500> between<00:04:01.560> Chuck

00:04:02.089 --> 00:04:02.099 
wonder how the conflict between Chuck

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:04.759 
wonder how the conflict between Chuck
and<00:04:02.449> Saul<00:04:03.449> is<00:04:03.659> going<00:04:03.900> to<00:04:03.989> be<00:04:04.169> probably<00:04:04.620> at<00:04:04.709> the

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:04.769 
and Saul is going to be probably at the

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:06.319 
and Saul is going to be probably at the
end<00:04:04.829> of<00:04:05.190> this<00:04:05.370> season<00:04:05.639> because<00:04:05.940> that's

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:06.329 
end of this season because that's

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:07.430 
end of this season because that's
probably<00:04:06.599> going<00:04:06.720> to<00:04:06.780> be<00:04:06.840> the<00:04:06.900> one<00:04:07.109> of<00:04:07.199> the<00:04:07.260> main

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
probably going to be the one of the main

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.110 
probably going to be the one of the main
things<00:04:07.470> that<00:04:08.129> is<00:04:08.549> going<00:04:08.729> to<00:04:08.790> be<00:04:08.849> the<00:04:08.940> main

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:17.030 
from that couple and I I didn't think he

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:19.480 
from that couple and I I didn't think he
would<00:05:17.120> do<00:05:17.270> something<00:05:17.510> like<00:05:17.840> that<00:05:17.900> so<00:05:18.380> early<00:05:19.280> on

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:19.490 
would do something like that so early on

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:21.700 
would do something like that so early on
like<00:05:20.120> in<00:05:20.450> the<00:05:20.720> season<00:05:21.170> I<00:05:21.200> didn't<00:05:21.470> think<00:05:21.620> he

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:21.710 
like in the season I didn't think he

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:23.350 
like in the season I didn't think he
would<00:05:21.800> do<00:05:21.950> something<00:05:22.130> like<00:05:22.400> that<00:05:22.460> but<00:05:23.090> to<00:05:23.180> see

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:23.360 
would do something like that but to see

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.690 
would do something like that but to see
how<00:05:23.570> he<00:05:23.630> actually<00:05:23.930> accepted<00:05:24.800> that<00:05:24.830> bribe<00:05:25.370> and
