accommodate modern science and even most

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.220 
accommodate modern science and even most
aspects<00:00:23.700> of<00:00:23.849> the<00:00:23.910> modern<00:00:24.270> world<00:00:24.509> they<00:00:24.810> reject

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
aspects of the modern world they reject

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.180 
aspects of the modern world they reject
specifically<00:00:26.009> evolution<00:00:26.789> and<00:00:27.920> they<00:00:28.920> are

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:29.190 
specifically evolution and they are

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:31.519 
specifically evolution and they are
really<00:00:29.699> trying<00:00:30.119> to<00:00:30.420> work<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.900> country<00:00:31.350> back

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
really trying to work the country back

to<00:00:31.830> bring<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.220> country<00:00:32.699> back<00:00:32.970> to<00:00:33.780> what<00:00:33.930> they

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:34.080 
to bring the country back to what they

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.380 
to bring the country back to what they
regard<00:00:34.500> as<00:00:34.680> it's<00:00:35.070> properly<00:00:35.670> religious

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
regard as it's properly religious

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.930 
regard as it's properly religious
foundations<00:00:37.199> so<00:00:37.410> they're<00:00:37.559> using<00:00:37.860> politics<00:00:38.580> to

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
foundations so they're using politics to

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.630 
foundations so they're using politics to
advance<00:00:39.330> what<00:00:39.600> is<00:00:39.690> essentially<00:00:40.350> a<00:00:40.640> religious

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
advance what is essentially a religious

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.840 
advance what is essentially a religious
goal<00:00:41.940> that<00:00:42.300> is<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:42.570> heart<00:00:43.079> of<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:44.219> evolution

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
goal that is the heart of the evolution

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.319 
goal that is the heart of the evolution
versus<00:00:45.239> creationism<00:00:45.870> issue<00:00:46.940> yes<00:00:47.940> there<00:00:48.149> is<00:00:48.300> a

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
versus creationism issue yes there is a

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.369 
versus creationism issue yes there is a
controversy<00:00:48.989> it's<00:00:49.829> in<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.100> public<00:00:50.460> eye<00:00:50.610> it's

00:00:51.369 --> 00:00:51.379 
controversy it's in the public eye it's

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:55.130 
controversy it's in the public eye it's
national<00:00:52.379> news<00:00:52.410> now<00:00:53.010> that<00:00:53.870> evolution<00:00:54.870> is

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
national news now that evolution is

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.940 
national news now that evolution is
somehow<00:00:55.469> wrong<00:00:56.070> and<00:00:56.579> that<00:00:56.940> we<00:00:57.120> have<00:00:57.420> to

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:57.950 
somehow wrong and that we have to

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:00.410 
somehow wrong and that we have to
believe<00:00:58.950> in<00:00:59.160> something<00:00:59.430> called<00:00:59.730> intelligent

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
believe in something called intelligent

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.510 
believe in something called intelligent
design<00:01:00.780> and<00:01:01.110> what<00:01:01.620> I<00:01:01.649> would<00:01:01.860> say<00:01:02.070> is<00:01:02.340> that

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
design and what I would say is that

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.600 
design and what I would say is that
there<00:01:02.670> is<00:01:02.910> no<00:01:03.410> controversy<00:01:04.410> within<00:01:04.800> the

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
there is no controversy within the

evolutionary theory they are still
trying<00:01:12.149> to<00:01:12.270> understand<00:01:13.050> how<00:01:13.259> evolution<00:01:13.890> works

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
trying to understand how evolution works

it's<00:01:32.070> not<00:01:32.159> such<00:01:32.490> a<00:01:32.520> big<00:01:32.759> deal

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
it's not such a big deal

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.140 
it's not such a big deal
completely<00:01:34.080> opposite<00:01:34.590> in<00:01:34.710> science<00:01:35.119> what<00:01:36.119> a

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
completely opposite in science what a

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.330 
completely opposite in science what a
lot<00:01:36.360> of<00:01:36.570> unfortunately<00:01:37.290> textbooks<00:01:38.130> lead

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
people to to misunderstand is that a

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.219 
people to to misunderstand is that a
really<00:01:41.610> good<00:01:41.790> theory<00:01:42.090> grows<00:01:42.479> up<00:01:42.689> into<00:01:42.869> a<00:01:42.990> law

really good theory grows up into a law

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.310 
really good theory grows up into a law
as<00:01:43.560> if<00:01:44.280> theories<00:01:44.970> are<00:01:45.240> refined<00:01:45.990> and<00:01:46.229> then

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
as if theories are refined and then

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.990 
as if theories are refined and then
become<00:01:46.619> laws<00:01:46.860> and<00:01:47.130> laws<00:01:47.280> are<00:01:47.310> somehow<00:01:47.700> more

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
become laws and laws are somehow more
