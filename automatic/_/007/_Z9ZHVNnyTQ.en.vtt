Kickstarter into their fans directly do

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:12.320 
Kickstarter into their fans directly do
you<00:00:11.280> think<00:00:11.490> that<00:00:11.670> that's<00:00:11.880> kind<00:00:12.150> of<00:00:12.240> a

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
you think that that's kind of a

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.570 
you think that that's kind of a
situation<00:00:12.509> that<00:00:12.780> party<00:00:13.110> 5<00:00:13.320> might<00:00:13.620> end<00:00:13.889> up<00:00:14.340> in

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
situation that party 5 might end up in

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.790 
situation that party 5 might end up in
or<00:00:14.880> you<00:00:15.389> know<00:00:15.509> I<00:00:15.719> think<00:00:15.929> here's<00:00:16.379> the<00:00:16.500> thing<00:00:16.650> it

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
or you know I think here's the thing it

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.260 
or you know I think here's the thing it
would<00:00:16.890> be<00:00:16.920> really<00:00:17.310> fun<00:00:17.609> to<00:00:17.789> all<00:00:17.910> get<00:00:18.090> back

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
would be really fun to all get back

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.540 
would be really fun to all get back
together<00:00:18.449> again<00:00:18.779> but<00:00:19.529> it<00:00:19.650> was<00:00:19.740> so<00:00:20.010> much<00:00:20.039> a

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
together again but it was so much a

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.120 
together again but it was so much a
point<00:00:20.880> in<00:00:21.090> time<00:00:21.300> and<00:00:21.720> an<00:00:22.109> age<00:00:22.410> for<00:00:22.439> all<00:00:22.949> of

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
point in time and an age for all of

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.830 
point in time and an age for all of
these<00:00:23.250> characters<00:00:23.670> be<00:00:23.789> hard<00:00:24.090> to<00:00:24.240> imagine<00:00:24.510> I

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
these characters be hard to imagine I

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.019 
these characters be hard to imagine I
think<00:00:25.140> recreating<00:00:25.890> that<00:00:26.310> in<00:00:26.460> any<00:00:26.640> meaningful

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
think recreating that in any meaningful

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.570 
think recreating that in any meaningful
way<00:00:27.449> and<00:00:27.570> Veronica<00:00:28.320> Mars<00:00:28.529> can<00:00:29.070> do<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.369> thing

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
way and Veronica Mars can do the thing

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.849 
way and Veronica Mars can do the thing
she<00:00:29.789> was<00:00:30.210> doing<00:00:30.240> before<00:00:30.539> but<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.470> idea<00:00:31.500> of<00:00:31.830> a

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
she was doing before but the idea of a

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.979 
she was doing before but the idea of a
bunch<00:00:32.040> of<00:00:32.219> 35<00:00:32.910> 40<00:00:33.180> year<00:00:33.420> olds<00:00:33.660> who<00:00:33.750> are<00:00:33.780> living

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
bunch of 35 40 year olds who are living

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.950 
bunch of 35 40 year olds who are living
without<00:00:34.200> their<00:00:34.530> parents<00:00:35.540> it's<00:00:36.540> a<00:00:36.690> it's

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
without their parents it's a it's

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.930 
without their parents it's a it's
flattering<00:00:37.469> I<00:00:37.860> think<00:00:38.250> that<00:00:38.430> people<00:00:38.610> always

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
flattering I think that people always

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.850 
flattering I think that people always
ask<00:00:39.090> but<00:00:39.660> is<00:00:39.750> there<00:00:39.780> gonna<00:00:40.050> be<00:00:40.110> some<00:00:40.500> sort<00:00:40.680> of

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
ask but is there gonna be some sort of

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.530 
ask but is there gonna be some sort of
something<00:00:41.340> a<00:00:41.550> reunion<00:00:41.850> show<00:00:42.030> or<00:00:42.510> a

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
something a reunion show or a

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.229 
something a reunion show or a
reimagining<00:00:42.930> of<00:00:43.320> things<00:00:43.590> but<00:00:43.829> yeah<00:00:44.610> it's<00:00:45.059> not

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
reimagining of things but yeah it's not

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.670 
reimagining of things but yeah it's not
a<00:00:45.300> show<00:00:45.629> I<00:00:45.660> don't<00:00:45.960> think<00:00:46.200> that<00:00:46.320> lends<00:00:46.530> itself

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
a show I don't think that lends itself

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.139 
a show I don't think that lends itself
to<00:00:47.010> that<00:00:47.160> quite<00:00:47.520> like<00:00:47.700> some<00:00:47.910> of<00:00:48.000> these<00:00:48.090> other

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
to that quite like some of these other

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.260 
to that quite like some of these other
shows<00:00:48.480> do<00:00:48.719> but<00:00:49.399> you<00:00:50.399> know<00:00:50.489> would<00:00:50.579> be<00:00:50.730> great

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
shows do but you know would be great

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.910 
shows do but you know would be great
being<00:00:51.780> back<00:00:51.870> in<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.199> company<00:00:52.590> of<00:00:52.710> all<00:00:52.829> the

people<00:00:53.160> we<00:00:53.280> worked<00:00:53.460> with<00:00:53.699> but<00:00:54.350> but<00:00:55.350> yeah<00:00:55.469> I

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
people we worked with but but yeah I

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.020 
people we worked with but but yeah I
don't<00:00:55.620> think<00:00:55.860> anybody<00:00:56.219> wants<00:00:56.370> to<00:00:56.640> see<00:00:56.789> a<00:00:56.820> bunch

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
don't think anybody wants to see a bunch

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.700 
don't think anybody wants to see a bunch
of<00:00:57.180> 40<00:00:57.570> year<00:00:57.660> olds<00:00:57.870> crying<00:00:58.230> about<00:00:58.500> their

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
of 40 year olds crying about their

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.110 
of 40 year olds crying about their
parents<00:00:59.100> not<00:00:59.309> being<00:00:59.340> around<00:00:59.699> where<00:00:59.940> do<00:01:00.030> you

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
parents not being around where do you

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.180 
parents not being around where do you
think<00:01:00.300> you<00:01:00.390> would<00:01:00.570> see<00:01:00.809> your<00:01:01.289> characters<00:01:01.800> and

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
think you would see your characters and

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.319 
think you would see your characters and
where<00:01:02.520> do<00:01:02.609> you<00:01:02.670> think<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:03.030> rest<00:01:03.180> of<00:01:03.270> the

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
where do you think the rest of the

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.570 
where do you think the rest of the
characters<00:01:03.600> would<00:01:03.930> be<00:01:03.989> if<00:01:04.920> you<00:01:05.430> were<00:01:05.519> to

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
characters would be if you were to

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.030 
characters would be if you were to
revisit<00:01:06.479> them<00:01:06.600> later<00:01:06.840> later<00:01:07.320> on<00:01:07.530> in<00:01:07.680> life<00:01:07.830> I

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
revisit them later later on in life I

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.950 
revisit them later later on in life I
think<00:01:08.100> given<00:01:08.610> all<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:08.880> turmoil<00:01:09.540> and<00:01:09.810> upheaval

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
think given all the turmoil and upheaval

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.160 
think given all the turmoil and upheaval
and<00:01:11.390> challenge<00:01:12.390> that<00:01:12.479> they<00:01:12.780> were<00:01:12.840> faced<00:01:13.140> with

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
and challenge that they were faced with

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.830 
and challenge that they were faced with
I<00:01:13.560> I<00:01:13.590> suppose<00:01:14.490> I<00:01:14.670> would<00:01:14.850> like<00:01:15.180> him<00:01:15.659> to<00:01:15.689> be

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
I I suppose I would like him to be

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.719 
I I suppose I would like him to be
living<00:01:16.259> and<00:01:16.380> easier<00:01:16.710> life<00:01:17.159> somehow<00:01:18.090> and

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:19.729 
living and easier life somehow and

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:23.270 
living and easier life somehow and
something<00:01:20.729> that<00:01:20.850> felt<00:01:21.180> intact<00:01:22.170> and<00:01:22.590> you<00:01:23.189> know

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
something that felt intact and you know

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.090 
something that felt intact and you know
I<00:01:23.310> think<00:01:23.400> he<00:01:23.759> he<00:01:24.509> as<00:01:24.750> they<00:01:25.020> all<00:01:25.259> did<00:01:25.560> had<00:01:25.830> kind

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
I think he he as they all did had kind

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.280 
I think he he as they all did had kind
of<00:01:26.159> a<00:01:26.250> lifetime's<00:01:26.759> worth<00:01:27.060> of<00:01:27.360> challenge<00:01:27.990> and

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
of a lifetime's worth of challenge and

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:34.700 
of a lifetime's worth of challenge and
and<00:01:29.780> emotional<00:01:30.860> turmoil<00:01:32.240> so<00:01:33.240> I<00:01:33.540> hope<00:01:34.229> he's<00:01:34.409> I

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
and emotional turmoil so I hope he's I

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.520 
and emotional turmoil so I hope he's I
