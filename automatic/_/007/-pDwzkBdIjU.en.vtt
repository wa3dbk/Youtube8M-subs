00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:06.690
 plus a Samsung smartphone in the area and there 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.080
 Youtube people today I'm going 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:12.599
 to introduce the new Samsung device 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:16.260
 more a galaxy for Brazil for everything 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:21.210
 world is samsung galaxy xande two 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:23.910
 ps 7572 but the galaxy model for 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.310
 complete the list not only to make 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.320
 table the same subject you are launching 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.179
 device hell 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.559
 and we do not know the same purpose 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:37.530
 But the most coherent answer is 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.820
 you simply have more options for 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.700
 consumers 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:44.850
 This is a very interesting tactic. 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.710
 smart but let's comment bring the 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.440
 specifications when sending 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.460
 features and comments on this 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.030
 new appliance 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:58.079
 it has connectivity at 2 in 62 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:06.000
 apparatus of 2 different networks 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:12.299
 gsm 850 to 1900 in model gt is 75 71 850 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:14.100
 to 900 no gt this ter 57 2 e tanguá e cba 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:17.700
 900 and 2006 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:20.600
 the optional sweet ie let's have to see 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.619
 only with a sim and the version with two simple ones 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:27.150
 probably the version with a yes if 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:28.560
 will call samsung galaxy large rs 75 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.040
 seventy né 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:34.860
 likely to have one of the 55 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.470
 will have the of the neighborhood booth will be announced 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.049
 announced in April and will be 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.630
 launched in this second quarter of 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:45.329
 2003 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:48.090
 11.1 millimeters so he the unit 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.560
 you thin and you can even look in the 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.110
 internet you will see some pictures 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:55.140
 them leaving the description of 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:58.259
 video with the images I did if I could 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.810
 find that out 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:03.450
 it has 11 points in the millimeters as already 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.200
 then I said this is very good with the 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.090
 appliance 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.729
 as you can see in this image that I 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.800
 I'm showing you here, we 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.260

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:15.050
 activity neighborhood industry here we 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:17.240
 we saw a game, and then we can see 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:20.300
 that the device is a good processor and that 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:22.910
 the appliance is good too for it's thing 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:26.420

 3.15 megapixels that people say that 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:29.180
 the camera of the apparatus with 3 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:32.239
 Megapixels are bad not good quality 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:35.720
 of cameras is not due to the amount of 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:38.540
 pixels but it is due to the quality 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:41.570
 company that makes the camera of the 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:44.510
 vechi so the camera is not bad 

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:47.000
 the camera only has 3 megapixels that is 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:48.770
 the photo size a little reduced 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.920
 top genius gadgets 

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:54.350
 we can come to htc and nihilism had until 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:57.700
 one thing that saying happened in 4 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:04:00.860
 megapixel camera only he had 14 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:03.739
 megapixels being that they were not megapixels 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:04.910
 and the ultra megapixels that were equivalent to 3 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:08.390
 megapixels 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:10.070
 this is a tst expensive technology is coming and 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:13.630
 what a wonder 

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:17.239

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:18.590
 pixels it shoots videos and has no 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:20.660
 secondary camera 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:23.280
 he counted on the operating system of the 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:25.889
 google with android 4.1 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:28.500
 2 g / l bean is it sure will be 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:31.260
 updated to 4.2 because it has a 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:35.550
 1.2 ghz core processor that 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:38.160
 tolerates sufficient and 14.2 in sensors 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:41.190
 it has proximity accelerometer and 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:45.780
 it has a mms sms and mail to the media 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:48.480
 and the yen and the rs in brownsville have an html 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:51.450
 He does not have a radio, it 's a shame, I do not see him. 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:53.280
 why they assumed they have put in a 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:55.200
 another video of mine I'm going to talk about it 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:58.680
 because samsung has launched another 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:03.000
 a device very similar to almost any 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:05.910
 What are some things, then? 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.730
 wanting to launch very precise devices 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:11.070
 one more with that another with that to 

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:15.000
 power to really achieve this new 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:19.110
 public he even has the java emulator there 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:21.990
 me mdp and it is available in the colors 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:25.860
 black red white but to Brazil 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:28.650
 it will only come with the white and black color and the 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:31.020
 blue standard of samsung and in future 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:33.120
 other things will come from his battery is 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:34.919
 very good I feel better Perez for a 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:36.860
 device with the dual core processor of 

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:40.950
 1.2 ghz 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:43.410
 I searched, but I do not know which 

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:46.410
 chip being the thinker if a cortex at 5 

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:49.200
 account that accepted the cortex A9 cortex 

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:51.810
 a15 listen to the possibility of the cortex 

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:55.140
 a15 because it will only come in top hands 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:57.330
 Airlines expands the galaxy s 4 then 

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:59.910
 this is it personal this was a video and saw 

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:02.310
 comments feature found 

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:04.919
 that this video not satisfied did not take 

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:06.960
 no doubt leave in comments 

00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:08.820
 also tell me that I need to improve 

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:10.979
 I would like your opinion 

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:12.660
 I'm making various video styles 

00:06:10.979 --> 00:06:15.690
 because a lot of people are complaining 

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:18.120
 of my videos I speak very fast 

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:19.919
 for talking very fast some people 

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:22.169
 I do not like it 

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:27.560
 I have another channel that he is. 

00:06:22.169 --> 00:06:27.560
 with 122 thousand views and is there to 

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:34.240
 323 18 however script 

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:38.220
 so this video is coming to an end 

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:40.660
 until the next little taste like favorite 

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:44.400
 share it's just you press on 

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:47.620
 add to favorites list or 

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:51.240
 share the point you want 

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:51.240
 so this is it and such
