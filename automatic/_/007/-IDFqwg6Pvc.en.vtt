00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.250
 november was another month again 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.780
 a few cool things I have with you 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.540
 I would like to share in the 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.250
 october birthday that is also a matter 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.780
 I would like to show you 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.289

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.090

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.340
 First, I want you a whole 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.880
 special foundation show us what is 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.740
 the osg in flash spray foundation the 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.599
 I've been in Paris in december 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.910
 bought because it is not in germany 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.320
 My review also had more to it 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.759
 I can bring that to you in the 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:37.380
 infobox link this is one 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:39.510
 foundation that you spray on me 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.730
 Do you know her? Yes I have her but I have 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.590
 she no longer uses the whole month 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.510
 because I did not want her to leave 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.190
 because I love her so much and I have 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.989
 she's back for a video recently 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.390
 used and I do not have it again 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.640
 in love with that, I have a lot of time 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.469
 it often uses enough again 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.210
 So I can still keep it loose for a long time 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.199
 use because I almost have them now 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.059
 a year 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.399
 I already have one at me 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.320
 Last time Paris is here again 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.780
 10 times as a kind of mission it is 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.250
 time that I need so slow 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.110
 and hope that someday 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.210
 can buy somewhere again then wants 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.860
 i show you a rose water i 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.049
 my satire that I think pretty much 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.240
 his fierce round made love 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.070
 Evo has shown that I'm laying mine 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.229
 face already for about one 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.290
 year with rose water my rose water 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:27.299
 was not pure rose water it was 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.729
 still mixed with other things brass 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:33.780
 I have been around for about a month now 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:36.530

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.850

 Face care routine also online 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.920
 that's a bit complicated and there 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.350
 i'll show you how i like this water 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.670
 user dax's a makeup company 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.930
 I also know them now 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.210
 everyone now 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.009
 That was one of the first companies 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.990
 where I just bought make-up 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.850
 So I have no idea or make-up 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.420
 I had thought to after then 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.040
 bought first lipgloss and then gave it 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.670
 he no longer in germany me at night 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.070
 then have me 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.450
 an online page at 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.190
 this is already a new one 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.239
 a bit longer but I have these 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.680
 brush 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:15.270
 that's what these two are here with 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.560
 nordstrom ordered that I may 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.090
 but not shut off normally because 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.040
 The shipping costs are pretty expensive 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.020
 but I really wanted this one 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.180
 brushes actually have the goods almost 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:27.209
 always sold out especially this one 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:31.290
 industry that's this account brush 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:33.959
 the most extreme because the account with it 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.670
 Stop being extremely clean I do not know 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:40.350
 I like to work with it and then 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:41.700
 This eco industry or do I risk degree 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:44.100
 does not only speak to the foreigners but 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.299
 this is not such an allround brasch 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.400
 idea so I give myself becoming the 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:49.319
 example when the bronze on then mine 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.030
 blank my highlight i can use it 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:53.340
 cities I can do everything with it 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:56.069
 I like it very compact that's why 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.870
 my november has also been a favorite 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:59.880
 girlfriend of me the love please when 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.970
 she also has a video of me 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:05.970
 she once told me 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:08.540
 at the beginning, of course, god 30-50 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:11.519
 Subscriber or so she meant to me 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.180
 Do not dilute in this addiction makeup 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:14.310
 to buy 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.720
 I really do not hold my own 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.420
 I buy only the things that I 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.100
 want to have and I need and 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.079
 things where I know what I mean 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:24.030
 really gonna work 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:25.799
 and I bought a palette 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:29.430
 that's the lorac range 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:30.930
 deloitte pro palette thought for a long time 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.549
 if I buy them because I have mine 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:35.220
 pallets and the whole naked and so 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:37.290
 but i do not regret it a piece of me 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.329
 she uses the colors almost every day 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.910
 are just awesome 

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:44.670
 Apart from the color selection are the 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:47.209
 Eyeshadow extremely well pigmented and 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:49.620
 they are extremely soft so they are 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:51.329
 some already a bit crumbly 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:54.239
 but i like that yes i like it when i am 

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:56.940
 paint the brush and then 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:59.069
 do you have brush color on it you know that 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:01.260
 it so that's something I hold very much 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:03.090
 That's why I love the palette and 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.940
 I have to go from my mother in law 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:07.590

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:49.150
 Come away from all this beauty 

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:51.640
 Toned I know it runs some of it 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:53.410

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:58.840

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:03.760
 book has not started to read 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:06.010
 but it is a very good book i have 

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:07.870
 I read a lot about it 

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:10.870
 have been around for a while but I read 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:18.790
 at the moment still felt one year 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:21.070
 but now idiot find annoying book 

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:23.530
 i much prefer he is i find it 

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:25.200
 I need a bit boring that's why 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:27.250
 a little bit to read this book 

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:28.990
 That's why I thought so 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:31.660
 ordered that from jens 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:33.610
 corssen and christiane tramitz me and 

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:35.590
 the others it's about as 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:36.820
 self-development succeed 

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:38.919
 Relationships 

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:41.020
 I can read you a little something 

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:42.910
 we feel shy of others 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:45.010
 and feel misunderstood 

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:46.720
 we are waiting eagerly for that 

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:48.310
 Our feelings return our feelings 

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:50.500
 expectations are met 

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:51.820
 blah blah blah blah blah finally everything 

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:54.340
 advance is just about it 

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:56.530
 Build relationships that work 

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:59.380
 it's not just about partnership 

00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:02.200
 for example, man and woman, but 

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:04.060
 around girlfriends in general at all 

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:07.240
 all acquaintances and so they stop 

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:08.680
 we work better than I do 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:10.270
 already read it is just like that 

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:13.650
 Misunderstandings feel us 

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:16.870
 misunderstood and misunderstood 

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:18.550
 competitive and blah blah blah and us 

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:20.050
 have to start with us first that is 

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:22.720
 such a bit of a psychological one 

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:24.160
 so book I love the apologie 

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:25.720
 here and I look forward to that soon 

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:28.780
 finally to be able to start 

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:30.850
 my last month's favorite is no 

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:35.170
 book also no make-up is it a 

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:38.590
 Sweater in a braid in 

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:40.720
 such a sky blue baby blue and is it 

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:42.220
 Cashmere is my first 

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:43.840
 cashmere sweater 

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:45.610
 Cashmere is of course a bit 

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:49.030
 more expensive but that is such an investment 

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:50.920
 I think and an item that you stop 

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:53.530
 already in his closet should have 

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:55.480
 if you maintain it then you think 

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:57.370
 For a very long time, I know what I am 

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:59.830
 not such a winter guy i like that 

00:06:57.370 --> 00:07:02.370
 winter, not because of me 

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:04.750
 also to buy winter clothes because of that 

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:06.700
 ordered my husband now and then to do things for 

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:09.910
 me and that was now a sweater from him 

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:11.770
 I fell in love with myself 

00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:13.300
 I do not spend so much money in pully 

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:15.880
 I think that came now 100 euro 

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:17.670
 link that up again because 

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:20.710

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:22.750

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:25.140
 often cause my husband lately only too 

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:27.640
 do not know any other policies 

00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:29.920
 I do not have that many police , I have to 

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:31.570
 Admit it is mine right now 

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:32.410
 favorite sweater and I wear it 

00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:34.210
 with pleasure 

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:38.050
 November was another month of the month 

00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:40.240
 I have to give things close to them again 

00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:41.830
 so much love to see what the 

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:44.950
 december brings me that way because i got mine
