yellows<00:00:42.150> and<00:00:42.180> greens<00:00:42.450> I'm<00:00:42.780> going<00:00:42.900> to<00:00:42.960> kind<00:00:43.170> of

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
yellows and greens I'm going to kind of

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.650 
yellows and greens I'm going to kind of
just<00:00:43.470> put<00:00:43.680> together<00:00:44.060> I'm<00:00:45.060> going<00:00:45.210> to<00:00:45.270> use<00:00:45.390> this

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
just put together I'm going to use this

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.370 
just put together I'm going to use this
green<00:00:46.020> and<00:00:46.380> maybe<00:00:46.920> some<00:00:47.160> of<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.550> mums<00:00:48.380> it's

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:49.380 
green and maybe some of the mums it's

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:51.440 
green and maybe some of the mums it's
very<00:00:49.500> fall<00:00:49.860> and<00:00:50.220> autumnal<00:00:50.310> and<00:00:51.120> I<00:00:51.180> think<00:00:51.360> they

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:51.450 
very fall and autumnal and I think they

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:54.530 
very fall and autumnal and I think they
really<00:00:51.690> work<00:00:51.840> well<00:00:52.050> together<00:00:53.300> you<00:00:54.300> need<00:00:54.450> to

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:54.540 
really work well together you need to

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:56.780 
really work well together you need to
definitely<00:00:54.780> take<00:00:54.989> off<00:00:55.320> all<00:00:55.560> of<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:55.790> greenery

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:56.790 
definitely take off all of the greenery

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:58.670 
definitely take off all of the greenery
because<00:00:57.390> this<00:00:57.660> greenery<00:00:57.989> in<00:00:58.200> the<00:00:58.320> foliage

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
because this greenery in the foliage

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.729 
because this greenery in the foliage
will<00:00:59.430> basically<00:01:00.360> pull<00:01:00.840> your<00:01:01.170> water<00:01:01.410> if<00:01:01.649> you

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
will basically pull your water if you

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.200 
will basically pull your water if you
think<00:01:01.920> of<00:01:02.010> it<00:01:02.070> that<00:01:02.130> way

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.990

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
bedroom arrangement so you're going to

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:21.859

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
cut at an angle and then you're going to

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.080 
cut at an angle and then you're going to
crisscross<00:01:22.170> up<00:01:22.710> into<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.100> stem<00:01:23.340> you<00:01:23.880> could

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
crisscross up into the stem you could

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.340 
crisscross up into the stem you could
smash<00:01:24.330> it<00:01:24.479> with<00:01:24.509> a<00:01:24.600> hammer<00:01:24.659> but<00:01:25.080> that's<00:01:25.259> a

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
smash it with a hammer but that's a

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.430 
smash it with a hammer but that's a
little<00:01:25.530> bit<00:01:25.649> much<00:01:26.040> um<00:01:26.610> per<00:01:27.300> year<00:01:27.600> so<00:01:27.780> that<00:01:28.229> does

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:28.440 
little bit much um per year so that does

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:29.810 
little bit much um per year so that does
the<00:01:28.619> trick<00:01:28.649> and<00:01:28.979> it<00:01:29.040> just<00:01:29.190> open<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.670> vein

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
the trick and it just open to the vein

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.030 
the trick and it just open to the vein
acid<00:01:30.750> green<00:01:30.930> and<00:01:31.110> purple<00:01:31.259> looks<00:01:31.560> so<00:01:31.860> good

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
acid green and purple looks so good

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.160 
acid green and purple looks so good
together<00:01:32.250> I'm<00:01:33.210> just<00:01:33.330> going<00:01:33.509> to<00:01:33.690> cut<00:01:33.899> up<00:01:33.990> as

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
together I'm just going to cut up as

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.480 
together I'm just going to cut up as
well<00:01:35.270> and<00:01:36.649> then<00:01:37.649> maybe<00:01:37.860> a<00:01:37.950> little<00:01:38.130> bit<00:01:38.310> of<00:01:38.340> this

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
well and then maybe a little bit of this

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.109 
well and then maybe a little bit of this
graph<00:01:40.100> so<00:01:41.100> there<00:01:41.399> you<00:01:41.460> have<00:01:41.520> it<00:01:41.640> i<00:01:41.850> feel<00:01:42.000> like

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
graph so there you have it i feel like

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.999 
graph so there you have it i feel like
