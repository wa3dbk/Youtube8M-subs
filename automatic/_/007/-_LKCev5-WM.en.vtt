muzzle<00:00:29.970> brake<00:00:30.150> does<00:00:30.390> is<00:00:30.750> that<00:00:31.380> it<00:00:31.619> allows<00:00:31.650> you

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
muzzle brake does is that it allows you

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.770 
muzzle brake does is that it allows you
move<00:00:32.369> faster<00:00:32.820> while<00:00:32.969> holding<00:00:33.149> your<00:00:33.300> pistol

move faster while holding your pistol

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.200 
move faster while holding your pistol
and<00:00:33.960> it<00:00:34.680> allows<00:00:34.980> you<00:00:35.130> to<00:00:35.160> have<00:00:35.309> more<00:00:35.579> damage<00:00:36.059> at

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
and it allows you to have more damage at

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.630 
and it allows you to have more damage at
longer<00:00:36.540> range<00:00:36.750> what<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.800> arc<00:00:37.980> allows<00:00:38.399> you<00:00:38.579> to

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
longer range what the arc allows you to

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.950 
longer range what the arc allows you to
do<00:00:38.760> is<00:00:39.000> also<00:00:39.719> allows<00:00:39.930> you<00:00:40.110> move<00:00:40.320> faster<00:00:40.800> but

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:41.960 
do is also allows you move faster but

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.830 
do is also allows you move faster but
increases<00:00:42.960> your<00:00:43.079> damage<00:00:43.110> by<00:00:43.710> about<00:00:43.980> 25%<00:00:44.840> now

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
increases your damage by about 25% now

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.840 
increases your damage by about 25% now
if<00:00:45.989> you<00:00:46.140> see<00:00:46.350> here<00:00:46.590> I'm<00:00:46.770> shooting<00:00:47.250> a<00:00:47.340> hunter<00:00:47.670> in

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
if you see here I'm shooting a hunter in

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.990 
if you see here I'm shooting a hunter in
a<00:00:48.300> no<00:00:49.020> critical<00:00:49.559> hit<00:00:49.829> zone<00:00:50.039> and<00:00:50.309> not<00:00:50.550> armored

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
a no critical hit zone and not armored

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.150 
a no critical hit zone and not armored
zone<00:00:51.149> so<00:00:51.329> it's<00:00:51.480> normal<00:00:52.020> damage<00:00:52.410> so<00:00:52.829> there's<00:00:52.980> no

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
zone so it's normal damage so there's no

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.420 
zone so it's normal damage so there's no
multiplier<00:00:53.730> there<00:00:54.110> it<00:00:55.110> will<00:00:55.440> take<00:00:55.500> 20<00:00:56.190> shots

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
multiplier there it will take 20 shots

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.639 
multiplier there it will take 20 shots
to<00:00:56.730> kill<00:00:57.379> when<00:00:58.379> I<00:00:58.590> do<00:00:58.710> not<00:00:59.100> have<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.789> arc<00:01:00.030> on

00:01:00.639 --> 00:01:00.649 
to kill when I do not have the arc on

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:03.950 
to kill when I do not have the arc on
when<00:01:01.649> I<00:01:01.680> put<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.190> arc<00:01:02.370> on<00:01:02.579> it<00:01:02.820> will<00:01:03.480> take<00:01:03.719> only

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
when I put the arc on it will take only

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.270 
when I put the arc on it will take only
16<00:01:04.619> shots<00:01:04.860> to<00:01:05.070> kill<00:01:05.280> and<00:01:05.519> that<00:01:06.420> is<00:01:07.110> about<00:01:07.530> a<00:01:07.590> 25%

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
16 shots to kill and that is about a 25%

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.480 
16 shots to kill and that is about a 25%
damage<00:01:08.970> increase<00:01:09.920> with<00:01:10.920> a<00:01:10.950> little<00:01:11.340> bit<00:01:11.460> of

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
damage increase with a little bit of

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.060 
damage increase with a little bit of
room<00:01:11.970> for<00:01:12.000> error<00:01:12.330> just<00:01:12.750> because<00:01:13.070> there's

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
room for error just because there's

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.210 
room for error just because there's
overkill<00:01:14.670> damage<00:01:15.119> so<00:01:15.420> I<00:01:15.720> am<00:01:16.140> guessing<00:01:16.770> around

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
overkill damage so I am guessing around

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.219 
overkill damage so I am guessing around
25%<00:01:17.670> because<00:01:18.030> that's<00:01:18.390> where<00:01:18.630> it<00:01:18.689> lands<00:01:18.990> on<00:01:19.049> the

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
25% because that's where it lands on the

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.200 
25% because that's where it lands on the
dot<00:01:19.470> so<00:01:20.220> it's<00:01:20.490> gonna<00:01:20.610> be<00:01:20.759> somewhere<00:01:21.090> around

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
dot so it's gonna be somewhere around

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.950 
dot so it's gonna be somewhere around
that<00:01:21.540> line<00:01:21.720> uh<00:01:22.820> this<00:01:23.820> upgrade<00:01:24.240> I<00:01:24.390> recommend
