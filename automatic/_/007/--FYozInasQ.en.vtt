00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
line down the middle of these and that

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.280 
line down the middle of these and that
looks<00:00:32.189> about<00:00:32.520> right<00:00:32.759> in<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:33.719> middle<00:00:33.930> maybe

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
looks about right in the middle maybe

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.729 
looks about right in the middle maybe
move<00:00:34.590> it<00:00:34.739> up<00:00:34.860> a<00:00:35.010> little<00:00:35.340> bit<00:00:35.750> right<00:00:36.750> there<00:00:36.780> now

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
move it up a little bit right there now

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.139 
move it up a little bit right there now
it's<00:00:38.040> important<00:00:38.460> we<00:00:38.610> have<00:00:40.340> that<00:00:41.340> there<00:00:41.879> are<00:00:41.940> 10

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
it's important we have that there are 10

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.770 
it's important we have that there are 10
inches<00:00:42.390> apart<00:00:42.780> so<00:00:43.739> I'm<00:00:44.100> going<00:00:44.129> to<00:00:44.940> label<00:00:45.270> this

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
inches apart so I'm going to label this

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.540 
inches apart so I'm going to label this
right<00:00:46.170> here<00:00:48.230> from<00:00:49.230> here<00:00:49.559> to<00:00:49.739> here<00:00:50.010> is<00:00:50.190> 5<00:00:50.520> inches

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
right here from here to here is 5 inches

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:57.369 
right here from here to here is 5 inches
and<00:00:51.530> from<00:00:52.530> here<00:00:52.770> to<00:00:52.949> here<00:00:55.160> is<00:00:56.160> 5<00:00:56.489> inches

00:00:57.369 --> 00:00:57.379 
and from here to here is 5 inches

00:00:57.379 --> 00:00:59.900 
and from here to here is 5 inches
together<00:00:58.379> it's<00:00:58.680> 10<00:00:58.980> inches<00:00:59.250> apart<00:00:59.520> like<00:00:59.699> they

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
together it's 10 inches apart like they

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.840 
together it's 10 inches apart like they
set<00:01:00.210> and<00:01:00.530> then<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.710> next<00:01:01.920> locus<00:01:02.489> that<00:01:02.520> I'm

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
set and then the next locus that I'm

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.890 
set and then the next locus that I'm
going<00:01:03.180> to<00:01:03.329> do<00:01:03.510> is<00:01:04.489> 7<00:01:05.489> units<00:01:05.610> from<00:01:06.240> point<00:01:06.630> are

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
going to do is 7 units from point are

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.820 
going to do is 7 units from point are
now<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:07.860> locus<00:01:08.430> of<00:01:08.460> points<00:01:09.420> from<00:01:10.320> a<00:01:10.439> single

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
now the locus of points from a single

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.789 
now the locus of points from a single
point<00:01:10.979> is<00:01:11.220> a<00:01:11.280> circle<00:01:12.119> so<00:01:13.110> I'm<00:01:13.320> just<00:01:13.560> going<00:01:13.740> to

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
point is a circle so I'm just going to

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.840 
point is a circle so I'm just going to
grab<00:01:14.159> my<00:01:14.310> circle<00:01:15.060> tool<00:01:16.100> to<00:01:17.100> draw<00:01:17.310> a<00:01:17.580> circle

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
grab my circle tool to draw a circle

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.670 
grab my circle tool to draw a circle
here<00:01:18.439> oops<00:01:19.439> I'm<00:01:20.189> going<00:01:20.280> to<00:01:20.430> recenter<00:01:20.970> this

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680 
here oops I'm going to recenter this

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:27.429 
here oops I'm going to recenter this
hopefully<00:01:22.680> I<00:01:22.710> draw<00:01:23.040> this<00:01:23.250> large<00:01:23.640> enough<00:01:24.740> but

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:27.439 
hopefully I draw this large enough but

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:30.520 
hopefully I draw this large enough but
what's<00:01:28.439> going<00:01:28.770> to<00:01:28.920> happen<00:01:29.460> sorry<00:01:30.240> about<00:01:30.450> that

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
what's going to happen sorry about that

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:35.929 
what's going to happen sorry about that
is<00:01:32.240> it<00:01:33.240> centered<00:01:33.750> on<00:01:33.960> our<00:01:34.640> and<00:01:35.640> I'm<00:01:35.729> going<00:01:35.880> to

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
is it centered on our and I'm going to

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.069 
is it centered on our and I'm going to
make<00:01:36.060> this<00:01:36.090> circle<00:01:36.570> a<00:01:36.630> little<00:01:36.689> bit<00:01:36.900> bigger

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
make this circle a little bit bigger

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.010 
make this circle a little bit bigger
because<00:01:37.320> it<00:01:37.590> has<00:01:37.799> a<00:01:37.829> radius<00:01:38.430> of<00:01:38.610> seven<00:01:39.030> so<00:01:39.659> if

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
because it has a radius of seven so if

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.370 
because it has a radius of seven so if
this<00:01:40.229> is<00:01:40.470> 5<00:01:40.770> from<00:01:41.250> this<00:01:41.430> line<00:01:41.729> to<00:01:42.329> our<00:01:42.380> locus

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
this is 5 from this line to our locus

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.710 
this is 5 from this line to our locus
line<00:01:43.619> in<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:43.920> middle<00:01:44.040> we<00:01:44.670> know<00:01:44.880> that<00:01:44.909> seven<00:01:45.600> is

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
line in the middle we know that seven is

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.270 
line in the middle we know that seven is
going<00:01:45.869> to<00:01:45.930> go<00:01:46.079> a<00:01:46.110> little<00:01:46.439> bit<00:01:46.710> above<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:48.140> five

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
going to go a little bit above the five

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.230 
going to go a little bit above the five
so<00:01:50.280> we'll<00:01:50.399> say<00:01:50.610> it's<00:01:50.759> like<00:01:50.970> that<00:01:52.369> so<00:01:53.369> again<00:01:53.850> let

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
so we'll say it's like that so again let

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.469 
so we'll say it's like that so again let
me<00:01:54.329> label<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:54.869> radius<00:01:55.290> to<00:01:55.500> this<00:01:56.329> so<00:01:57.329> the

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
me label the radius to this so the

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.160 
me label the radius to this so the
radius<00:01:57.659> of<00:01:58.020> our<00:01:58.670> of<00:01:59.670> the<00:02:00.000> circle<00:02:00.540> is<00:02:00.719> going<00:02:01.049> to

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
radius of our of the circle is going to

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.709 
radius of our of the circle is going to
be<00:02:01.320> seven<00:02:01.799> and<00:02:01.979> that's<00:02:02.579> why<00:02:02.850> it<00:02:02.909> goes<00:02:03.390> above

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
be seven and that's why it goes above

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:07.399 
be seven and that's why it goes above
our<00:02:04.579> locus<00:02:05.579> here<00:02:06.540> in<00:02:06.689> the<00:02:06.810> Middle<00:02:07.049> East<00:02:07.200> two

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
our locus here in the Middle East two

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:08.960 
our locus here in the Middle East two
lines<00:02:07.680> because<00:02:08.190> it's<00:02:08.310> from<00:02:08.459> here<00:02:08.670> to<00:02:08.759> here<00:02:08.849> is

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
lines because it's from here to here is

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.600 
lines because it's from here to here is
five<00:02:09.209> and<00:02:09.450> so<00:02:10.050> we<00:02:10.140> just<00:02:10.319> need<00:02:10.530> to<00:02:10.619> mark<00:02:10.890> an<00:02:11.039> X<00:02:11.250> on

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
five and so we just need to mark an X on

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.820 
five and so we just need to mark an X on
each<00:02:11.849> point<00:02:12.090> that<00:02:12.330> satisfies<00:02:12.930> this

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
each point that satisfies this

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.700 
each point that satisfies this
and<00:02:13.890> so<00:02:14.130> we<00:02:14.670> just<00:02:14.880> mark<00:02:15.690> an<00:02:15.840> X<00:02:15.960> where<00:02:16.260> these<00:02:16.410> tu

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
and so we just mark an X where these tu

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:19.520 
and so we just mark an X where these tu
lo<00:02:17.340> sai<00:02:17.610> intersect<00:02:18.210> so<00:02:18.900> we<00:02:19.080> have<00:02:19.170> an<00:02:19.260> X<00:02:19.440> here

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
lo sai intersect so we have an X here
