00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:21.299 
something a little different so that it

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:23.330 
something a little different so that it
can<00:02:21.450> actually<00:02:21.659> start<00:02:22.140> off<00:02:22.349> where<00:02:22.799> we<00:02:22.830> left<00:02:23.099> off

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340
