00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.100 

well<00:00:13.220> the<00:00:13.610> Swift<00:00:13.910> actually<00:00:14.480> is<00:00:14.690> probably

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:15.110 
well the Swift actually is probably

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:18.010 
well the Swift actually is probably
suited<00:00:15.559> to<00:00:15.770> maybe<00:00:16.460> a<00:00:16.790> young<00:00:17.150> couple<00:00:17.660> with

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:18.020 
suited to maybe a young couple with

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:20.650 
suited to maybe a young couple with
maybe<00:00:18.830> just<00:00:18.920> the<00:00:19.160> one<00:00:19.310> child<00:00:19.610> however<00:00:20.360> the

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:20.660 
maybe just the one child however the

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.170 
maybe just the one child however the
main<00:00:20.840> reason<00:00:21.200> behind<00:00:21.320> the<00:00:21.619> Swift<00:00:21.950> is<00:00:22.730> the<00:00:22.939> fact

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:23.180 
main reason behind the Swift is the fact

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.589 
main reason behind the Swift is the fact
that<00:00:23.300> it's<00:00:23.830> only<00:00:24.830> 8<00:00:25.099> foot<00:00:25.369> long<00:00:25.550> and<00:00:25.820> it's

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:26.599 
that it's only 8 foot long and it's

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:29.470 
that it's only 8 foot long and it's
small<00:00:26.930> its<00:00:27.110> compact<00:00:27.260> and<00:00:28.210> you<00:00:29.210> know<00:00:29.329> it's

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:29.480 
small its compact and you know it's

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:30.819 
small its compact and you know it's
kinda<00:00:29.779> like<00:00:29.810> you<00:00:30.020> don't<00:00:30.200> have<00:00:30.380> to<00:00:30.500> go<00:00:30.650> and

00:00:30.819 --> 00:00:30.829 
kinda like you don't have to go and

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:32.740 
kinda like you don't have to go and
upgrade<00:00:31.070> to<00:00:31.400> a<00:00:31.579> big<00:00:31.790> floor<00:00:32.150> drive<00:00:32.360> to<00:00:32.540> be<00:00:32.660> able

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:32.750 
upgrade to a big floor drive to be able

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.250 
upgrade to a big floor drive to be able
toing<00:00:33.310> tare<00:00:34.310> weight<00:00:34.340> usually<00:00:35.090> between<00:00:35.260> 750

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:36.260 
toing tare weight usually between 750

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.270 
toing tare weight usually between 750
and<00:00:36.500> 800<00:00:37.280> kgs<00:00:37.790> so<00:00:38.600> this<00:00:39.110> particular<00:00:39.560> beam<00:00:39.950> here

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:40.280 
and 800 kgs so this particular beam here

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.760 
and 800 kgs so this particular beam here
because<00:00:40.820> the<00:00:41.000> low<00:00:41.149> tare<00:00:41.480> weight<00:00:41.510> can<00:00:42.500> actually

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:42.770 
because the low tare weight can actually

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:44.830 
because the low tare weight can actually
be<00:00:42.829> towed<00:00:43.070> with<00:00:43.190> a<00:00:43.309> four-cylinder<00:00:43.910> camera<00:00:44.210> or

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:44.840 
be towed with a four-cylinder camera or

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.510 
be towed with a four-cylinder camera or
a<00:00:44.870> very<00:00:45.230> small<00:00:45.590> forward<00:00:45.980> Drive<00:00:46.190> you<00:00:46.370> don't

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:46.520 
a very small forward Drive you don't

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.180 
a very small forward Drive you don't
have<00:00:46.640> to<00:00:46.760> upgrade<00:00:46.910> to<00:00:47.300> a<00:00:47.330> to<00:00:48.110> a<00:00:48.140> Hilux<00:00:48.560> or<00:00:48.830> and

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:49.190 
have to upgrade to a to a Hilux or and

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:50.410 
have to upgrade to a to a Hilux or and
this<00:00:49.400> and<00:00:49.580> Navarre<00:00:49.850> or<00:00:49.970> anything<00:00:50.150> like<00:00:50.360> that

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.420 
this and Navarre or anything like that

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.030 
this and Navarre or anything like that
to<00:00:50.690> be<00:00:50.780> able<00:00:50.900> to<00:00:50.990> enjoy<00:00:51.110> gonna<00:00:51.470> weigh<00:00:51.650> kitten

to be able to enjoy gonna weigh kitten

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.520 
to be able to enjoy gonna weigh kitten
in<00:00:52.750> anything<00:00:53.750> really<00:00:53.960> I<00:00:54.110> mean<00:00:54.350> this

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530 
in anything really I mean this

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.170 
in anything really I mean this
particular<00:00:54.890> model<00:00:55.220> here<00:00:55.610> is<00:00:55.730> the<00:00:55.880> outback

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:56.180 
particular model here is the outback

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:57.430 
particular model here is the outback
motor<00:00:56.450> so<00:00:56.690> it's<00:00:56.810> a<00:00:56.840> little<00:00:56.960> bit<00:00:57.110> more<00:00:57.260> like<00:00:57.410> a

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 
motor so it's a little bit more like a

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.100 
motor so it's a little bit more like a
the<00:00:58.340> dams<00:00:58.640> and<00:00:58.880> the<00:00:59.000> rivers<00:00:59.360> and<00:00:59.390> the<00:00:59.660> lakes

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:00.110 
the dams and the rivers and the lakes

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:02.050 
the dams and the rivers and the lakes
and<00:01:01.010> that<00:01:01.130> sort<00:01:01.340> of<00:01:01.370> stuff<00:01:01.580> which<00:01:01.610> is<00:01:01.790> an

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:02.060 
and that sort of stuff which is an

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:04.240 
and that sort of stuff which is an
accessible<00:01:02.680> generally<00:01:03.680> bit<00:01:03.860> an<00:01:03.950> on-road

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
accessible generally bit an on-road

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.490 
accessible generally bit an on-road
careful<00:01:04.699> because<00:01:05.329> the<00:01:05.630> Outback<00:01:05.930> you<00:01:06.049> get<00:01:06.200> into

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500 
careful because the Outback you get into

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.819 
careful because the Outback you get into
a<00:01:06.530> fight

00:01:06.819 --> 00:01:06.829 
a fight

00:01:06.829 --> 00:01:08.890 
a fight
you've<00:01:07.549> got<00:01:07.670> a<00:01:07.700> bigger<00:01:07.909> shaggy<00:01:08.240> so<00:01:08.509> that<00:01:08.689> can

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:08.900 
you've got a bigger shaggy so that can

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.380 
you've got a bigger shaggy so that can
sort<00:01:09.110> of<00:01:09.170> anal<00:01:09.350> that<00:01:09.909> sometimes<00:01:10.909> a<00:01:11.090> little<00:01:11.210> bit

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
sort of anal that sometimes a little bit

of rough terrain that you saw get are

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:15.429 
of rough terrain that you saw get are
specially<00:01:14.150> after<00:01:14.270> rain<00:01:14.600> you<00:01:15.170> know<00:01:15.290> like

specially after rain you know like

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:19.090 
specially after rain you know like
sometimes<00:01:15.680> the<00:01:17.319> potholes<00:01:18.319> developing<00:01:18.979> this

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
sometimes the potholes developing this

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.559 
sometimes the potholes developing this
little<00:01:19.369> bit<00:01:19.490> of<00:01:19.579> angulation<00:01:19.999> in<00:01:20.329> the<00:01:20.420> road

00:01:20.559 --> 00:01:20.569 
little bit of angulation in the road

00:01:20.569 --> 00:01:22.690 
little bit of angulation in the road
Nestle<00:01:20.960> stuff<00:01:21.229> and<00:01:21.679> tile<00:01:22.159> this<00:01:22.369> around<00:01:22.609> that

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
Nestle stuff and tile this around that

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.300 
Nestle stuff and tile this around that
sort<00:01:22.999> of<00:01:23.030> stuff<00:01:23.210> are<00:01:23.569> areas<00:01:24.170> because<00:01:25.069> of<00:01:25.219> the

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
sort of stuff are areas because of the

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.149 
sort of stuff are areas because of the
height<00:01:25.880> there's<00:01:26.420> no<00:01:26.600> issues<00:01:26.990> with<00:01:27.229> it<00:01:27.289> scraped

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:28.159 
height there's no issues with it scraped

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:29.590 
height there's no issues with it scraped
and<00:01:28.280> underneath<00:01:28.700> the<00:01:28.850> bed<00:01:28.999> or<00:01:29.179> anything<00:01:29.270> like

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
and underneath the bed or anything like

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.840 
and underneath the bed or anything like
that<00:01:29.799> you<00:01:30.799> know<00:01:30.920> it's<00:01:31.039> pretty<00:01:31.189> ragged<00:01:31.700> it's

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850 
that you know it's pretty ragged it's

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.719 
that you know it's pretty ragged it's
got<00:01:32.030> the<00:01:32.149> heavy<00:01:32.469> backdrop<00:01:33.469> jacks<00:01:33.979> there<00:01:34.219> yeah

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:34.729 
got the heavy backdrop jacks there yeah

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:37.959 
got the heavy backdrop jacks there yeah
so<00:01:35.259> you<00:01:36.259> know<00:01:36.289> and<00:01:36.710> on<00:01:36.889> the<00:01:37.039> undulating<00:01:37.520> ground

00:01:37.959 --> 00:01:37.969 
so you know and on the undulating ground

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:39.760 
so you know and on the undulating ground
you<00:01:38.210> can<00:01:38.359> sort<00:01:38.569> of<00:01:38.630> set<00:01:39.229> them<00:01:39.409> up<00:01:39.560> on<00:01:39.679> a

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
you can sort of set them up on a

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.859 
you can sort of set them up on a
different<00:01:40.069> angle<00:01:40.219> if<00:01:40.490> you<00:01:40.579> had<00:01:40.729> to<00:01:40.909> yeah<00:01:41.600> sure

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:41.869 
different angle if you had to yeah sure

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:43.809 
different angle if you had to yeah sure
the<00:01:42.170> script<00:01:42.439> would<00:01:42.560> be<00:01:42.740> a<00:01:42.770> good<00:01:42.950> choice<00:01:43.189> so<00:01:43.249> if

00:01:43.809 --> 00:01:43.819 
the script would be a good choice so if

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:46.060 
the script would be a good choice so if
you<00:01:43.939> need<00:01:44.149> a<00:01:44.209> camping<00:01:44.659> car<00:01:44.810> camping

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
you need a camping car camping

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.530 
you need a camping car camping
because<00:01:47.000> it's<00:01:47.900> small<00:01:48.170> its<00:01:48.320> compact<00:01:48.500> and<00:01:49.540> you

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:50.540 
because it's small its compact and you

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.750 
because it's small its compact and you
know<00:01:50.630> like<00:01:50.840> generally<00:01:51.380> what<00:01:52.130> happens<00:01:52.460> is<00:01:52.580> when

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:52.760 
know like generally what happens is when

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.430 
know like generally what happens is when
you<00:01:52.910> when<00:01:53.210> you're<00:01:53.330> new<00:01:53.510> to<00:01:53.690> it<00:01:53.810> this<00:01:54.380> is

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:54.440 
you when you're new to it this is

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.160 
you when you're new to it this is
generally<00:01:54.890> the<00:01:54.950> first<00:01:55.490> thing<00:01:55.790> that<00:01:55.820> you<00:01:56.600> sort

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
generally the first thing that you sort

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:58.030 
generally the first thing that you sort
of<00:01:57.200> think<00:01:57.410> yourself<00:01:57.680> into

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:58.040 
of think yourself into
