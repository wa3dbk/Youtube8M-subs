00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.820 

I<00:00:36.100> think<00:00:36.370> it's<00:00:36.489> coming<00:00:36.850> down<00:00:37.090> to<00:00:37.150> a<00:00:37.390> lot<00:00:37.630> of

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:37.830 
I think it's coming down to a lot of

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:44.900 
I think it's coming down to a lot of
real<00:00:38.830> fast<00:00:39.610> switches

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.540 

yeah<00:00:45.660> it's<00:00:46.260> frustrating<00:00:46.710> taking<00:00:47.130> so<00:00:47.310> long<00:00:47.340> to
