00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:12.200
 and the people who are promoting the 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:14.290
 initiative for the production are people 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.540
 hungry for money 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:19.570
 they do not care if there is everything about 

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:21.610
 they looked for a flag they have a 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:25.500
 group of people who are the saints who 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:25.500
 they are professionals 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.439
 they are going to look 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:38.540
 in 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:42.450
 I do not see the company here 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:46.710
 the bull is important because they do not want 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:50.070
 make a public presence because they have 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.780
 also simply bullfighting 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.360
 unfortunately it was already touched by the 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.450
 politics 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:58.520
 and you see that the political groups the 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:02.660
 political parties that are in favor of 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:04.339
 abolish the bullfights is not they put the 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.720
 flag to the bull flag 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:09.320
 animal rights can the 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:12.229
 flag the suffering of a bull but 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:16.610
 unfortunately that is not the background 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:18.890
 of all but you see that in time 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:22.280
 in which we are, it is necessary to gather 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:26.320
 people count votes join support then 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:30.610
 they hung on this in my opinion for 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:33.700
 well to give strength to his party to his 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:35.860
 political ideology to the best how like 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:38.290
 we describe in art within the 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:40.030
 party now as everything is very difficult 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:43.180
 explain art not art explains us 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:46.229
 you feel then this art inside 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.229
 of the bulls is 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:53.130
 you see the bullfighter standing there with 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:55.020
 the bull in the ring without another weapon that does not 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.409
 be in these two things in a rapier and 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:01.259
 a crutch and that when it happens 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:04.049
 the bull you move so many things inside 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.939
 that there are times when he screams there are only 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:08.310
 times you can cry in the 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:11.730
 lying that are the emotions that to a 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:14.610
 person causes you the art I do not know what 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.769
 you think about the concept of 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:21.060
 abolition of bullfighting in 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:23.970
 mexico because it's something against 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:27.360
 our traditions something against 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:31.519
 even from the nuclear family because this 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.519
 it comes from grandparents grandchildren 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:40.300
 take it away from this the town goes to 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:43.030
 have more family breakup going to 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:45.750
 have more this there will be no union in 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.750
 our society 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:58.680
 yes yes yes yes yes 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.680
 and now yes 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.459
 all right
