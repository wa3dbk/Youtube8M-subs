00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:12.000
 well here we are in another area of ​​the 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:15.509
 happy project of hen 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.970
 something important this is a phase of 11 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.160
 weeks since you have 11 weeks can 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.439
 see it is very very very very developed 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:26.130
 and also pretty the long chicks 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:29.160
 and at 21 weeks approximately liters 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:32.219
 of mana they start to put these 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.410
 bones are for being small beginners 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.480
 and this is a topic that diego we are going to 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.540
 speak a moment now that he and diego 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.239
 is going to tell us and here almost I almost 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.160
 gave a hen in the legs to here something 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.710
 important this other sector here is of 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.289
 11 weeks from here they can be 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:53.180
 seeing remaining evident right in 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:57.629
 this lot started with a lot of 300 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:01:00.469
 birds just as well in six weeks of 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.469
 agricultural cantonal 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:07.270
 last week I decided together with my 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:10.000
 partners invest a little more in what 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:12.790
 I told him about the economy with the plate 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.810
 of zinc in the sight of 5 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:18.490
 what previous 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:21.950
 and we acquired 200 jewels more than 6 weeks 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:23.899
 when we bring them in, I thought I was going to 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:27.049
 have a normal behavior but that 

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:31.159
 he had problems 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:34.399
 of 11 weeks and 7 weeks and then 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:36.170
 we put this project now this same 

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:38.479
 area is just under construction 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:41.600
 then you can see the type of feeders 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:45.229
 what is the canoe the canoe that had the 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:47.569
 housing and we cut it in two so that 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:50.270
 is to put the concentrate to the 

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:53.750
 buoys and will help us elisabeth the 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:55.850
 society is right that it is in its 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.289
 feeders are temporary there 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.680
 finish installing what they are 

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:03.730
 water troughs the troughs are 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:06.820
 of the industrial type let's say the most 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:08.560
 used that is by gravity and 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:11.320
 we need to put what is the tank 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.480
 of water that the water tank is where 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:16.540
 It can be dosed for vitamins 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:19.190
 dewormers in short just barely 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:22.570
 we were with this as this Saturday of 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:25.380
 of the infrastructure project of 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:28.560
 batches 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:30.360
 It is supported in this 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.670
 here some people may be watching and 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.310
 they are wondering but what project 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:38.370
 more masses and I do not see anything new 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:44.040
 new and here we can see diego 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:46.550
 is in the little hand that we in the 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:49.230
 part of project research 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:52.140
 we started to use what is the 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:54.330
 forage green hydroponic forage 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.040
 hydroponic green itself at least the 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:59.850
 that we use is corn 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:02.880
 yellow it is not transgenic because the 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:05.550
 idea is that then happy chickens 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:08.070
 country apart from how its name 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:11.670
 says be happy be totally 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:13.390
 natural be organic at the moment 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.850
 we can not give 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:18.130
 an ecological product because I think 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:22.120
 with which the hens of 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:26.650
 posture although little is mostly the 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:28.420
 Soybean sorghum or corn comes from the USA or 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.610
 It can also be from Argentina or 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.230
 Brazil where they use the transgenic 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:34.330
 then we can not tell 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:36.370
 the people that we are using that 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.710
 we are producing an egg totally 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:39.480
 organic 

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:42.090
 the problem we have had with the 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:46.620
 Hydroponic green forage is the price 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:48.270
 when coming to buni these dimes and diretes 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.220
 between environmentalists and 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:53.420
 transgenic 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:55.580
 has increased the price of seed 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:59.420
 criolla 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:00.980
 up to two thousand two thousand 500 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:04.220
 rent colons and then there not 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:07.580
 we are profitable forage production 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:09.650
 if we get hydroponic green if 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:11.870
 we get good quality seed already 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:14.510
 a reasonable cost then then 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:16.340
 we come back to the part of itself the forage 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:18.859
 hydroponic green that is high in 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:21.049
 protein up to 12 percent is 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:24.350
 extremely easy to use now, that is 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:26.960
 they will see him in a job later 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:30.500
 the seed is finished just as they do 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:33.530
 we take them from those of the peasants of 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:35.780
 the coffee farmers put the seed in 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:38.150
 water for a certain time with a 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:41.030
 lime water then we took it out we would go 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:44.420
 we put it back and later 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:49.000
 we spread it on the ground in a 

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:51.880
 plastic and we put this one drawer 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.880
 the drawer that we have is for 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:05:01.990
 approximately 10 kilos of seed 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:05:03.670
 the function of the right one is now in the 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:07.300
 background what it takes is plastic bag 

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:10.450
 plastic trash as a garden and how it goes 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:12.970
 to work this here and the mesh in 

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:15.970
 chairs so why is this this 

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:18.340
 Hydroponic duty form system is in 

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:19.930
 the site or we are here in 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:22.930
 this chicken coop in this lot of 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:25.530
 development we sow the corn the forage 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:29.260
 green that's why it's the plastic for 

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:30.880
 limit them from touching the ground in the 

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.440
 drawer of the function that meets 

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:35.620
 it's just that the animals do not 

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:40.470
 enter where the corn is and when 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:44.290
 the seed is deposited then covered 

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:47.260
 they will compete to give you this darkness 

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:50.260
 necessary for the corn or the seed 

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:51.810
 begins to sprout in the same seed at 

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:55.080
 feel 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:57.419
 with the other seeds it feels as if 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:58.860
 was planted with darkness and 

00:05:57.419 --> 00:06:02.639
 then more than enough already to 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:05.540
 second day begins to sprout and the fourth 

00:06:02.639 --> 00:06:08.360
 day is removed 

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:10.670
 the sharan that was shading him already 

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:13.540
 from that we simply add it 

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:16.280
 with a broth water until 10 days 

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:20.360
 after 10 days it starts to 

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:22.790
 lower the protein content in the 

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:26.570
 analysis that we have 

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:30.170
 higher than 12% if I remember correctly how 

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:32.660
 the 12.48 percent protein that is 

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:35.300
 really very good satisfactory for 

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:37.160
 what is the development of the pullets 

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:40.010
 layers 

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:44.420
 and this what is to implement on fire 

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:46.490
 intensively if the idea is the same as 

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:49.400
 that's how this is a project too 

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:52.070
 investigative is to see good those 10 kilos 

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:54.140
 for how many days and for how many 

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:56.540
 chickens or cocks that reaches me 

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:59.360
 then do it stepped so that 

00:06:56.540 --> 00:07:01.760
 when it is finished consuming the 

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:04.940
 first crate of green courage 

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:07.430
 hydroponic already the second or third and 

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:09.650
 are ready to be consumed by 

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:11.060
 the animals but let's go back to the 

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:13.880
 cost-benefit 

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:18.380
 If the price of corn is not accessible or 

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:20.690
 not not comfortable enough to 

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:23.210
 us to develop it this one 

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:25.190
 we would still be waiting to see in 

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:27.740
 what time are we still implementing the 

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:29.690
 Hydroponic green forage go out to a 

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:31.100
 pause and when we return we will know 

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:33.470
 let's talk with the officials 

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:35.330
 of the cantonal agricultural center while 

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:36.980
 Diego prepares some aspects 

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:38.840
 important why is the part of 

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:40.009
 development as the money said and diego 

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:42.020
 corals 

00:07:40.009 --> 00:07:44.270
 in the part already what is the production 

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:47.030
 of course he 

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:49.460
 you will like it and vice versa 

00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:50.990
 grams but this we will see in a 

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:52.940
 second program the production part 

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:54.500
 in this what was the part of 

00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:57.580
 development production more than all 

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:57.580
 birds we return
