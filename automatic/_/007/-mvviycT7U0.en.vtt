00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.370
 hello friends with you dan tel double s 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.649
 and before we begin I wanted to tell 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.540
 what looked at one extra 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.440
 here on the bottom is sharp 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.820
 a steppe map here can be excellent 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:17.520
 shine saw like a bow tally 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.160
 also the boy showed through perfectly 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.800
 these bushes all who travels there for at 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.650
 them on the left flank we get on 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.500
 right here i'm still pouring the network poems a 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:32.160
 The main task that I would like to take 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.809
 44 will suffer hard now 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.340
 punish him close 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:42.239
 here it is, even the poor without falling for me 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:47.910
 here means to me such a task to kill three 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:50.340
 Fri Sa rival to get st15 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.680
 to perform will melt us and in doing so 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:56.280
 win the battle and survive i will find 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.710
 tried to do on t-34 85 and did that 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.320
 task but unfortunately I got sick there 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.969
 in the end we won and poverty is not me 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.430
 I think it is necessary with distinction 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.710
 do to get this prototype and 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.869
 I do not want just to l . carry me this 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:13.229
 very difficult on lt as i'm already on arte 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:17.070
 I will be art bieber and tolerate what 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:19.950
 the letter ltn and lt have me there 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.409
 bend down now that's great light now batch 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.020
 see yagtigr here leaving that is 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:29.700
 such a cool place in the square f6 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:31.560
 where are two fri-shki damn me like 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.079
 as if it would fire 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.440
 I'm going to put it on, but here I’m overcharging 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.260
 was 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:39.990
 there would put the load and finished off already 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:42.840
 here recharge unfortunately I 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:45.450
 now nothing fails yagdtigrom 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:49.470
 and we will deal with it later as well 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:52.260
 like with that 268 who glowed there 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.360
 now I know that now I have nothing 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:56.790
 to rock the boat and in the center there is flattery 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.830
 feeling lit up weird and waffles not 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:04.080
 bloom in flash sit down shone and 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:07.320
 yak-yak on arrival about here already we have 6 guts 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:09.780
 and this is rarely so rarely when not 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.450
 do not happen often when necessary happens 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:15.890
 so rarely do you wait there for us . 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:19.380
 he wants a fight there waiting for 1 about the base and 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:22.460
 it turns out that those throws all damn IBD 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:25.500
 like knowing what kind of body would be needed here 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:28.200
 saw 268 miss it means 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.000
 need to get to or excellent abacha how 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.640
 can not be better suited to be 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.040
 to here these pawns of Thrawn 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:38.220
 gouge out read 2,000 drum damage 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:41.910
 goes and in any way will not suffer and 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:43.980
 if there 's 140 to wait while it's a cadet 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:47.790
 tyry-pyry then left here quickly 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:50.940
 took this ptshku drove 1tb sewed it 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:53.280
 damn all the tank is directly adapted for 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:56.670
 order to do this 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:59.340
 this e15 here waffles aviad lunch on 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.680
 recharge it costs it waits i think 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.750
 it would be necessary to brighten him up and then when 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.660
 will already stay there with him a little 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:10.260
 just need him a bit 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:13.860
 distributed the bashi number and nearly falls 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.730
 go badly they throw up at 1600 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.550
 fine 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.040
 I think that's penalty 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:21.410
 leave me a bunch a little quieter chic 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:25.010
 sign on leave slightly 4 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:26.720
 projectile and here's a tiger 20 leaving from the sides 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:30.350
 pancake bacha long comes down 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:32.290
 without getting shorter he already think 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:35.780
 need to batch again climbed somewhere 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:38.930
 let's go go tariq al on a picnic falling 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:41.720

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:45.550
 which can damn foil shoot 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:48.110
 still with the guard throw hard here and 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:49.550
 deciding to keep a dozen to later 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:52.520
 drive in and mortgage 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:55.400
 scatter those two already 

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:59.780
 lift 1 there are left 2 candle art 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:02.360

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:05.420
 our artillery can’t get 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:09.680

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:13.220
 there is no other place we look here 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:15.320
 Now it ’s time to pick up the thoughts 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:18.260
 responsible for the slide and thank god I drove 

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:19.310
 already there is no need to be faster because it 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:22.490

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:26.780

 nobody sees me here it is not 

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:50.629
 pay attention to and

 there are also e100 matches still thrown behind or 

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:33.860
