00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:31.650
 brown green and ride like it makes the 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:34.130

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.730

 Bartko and far and the insight is far 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:13.440
 away it is already santa corona in 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:43.260
 has been the green after just 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:43.260
 Chocolate has been dedicated to chocolate 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:59.340
 Canvas is that just show classics 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:59.340
 guests stay 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:20.900
 more show and still gasoline off the lif 

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:34.590
 expect that something cooking mike 

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:47.159
 terranova l and left six grandson michael 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:52.500
 jacksons is okay okay 

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:56.209
 Coconut would have to order at 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:56.209
 Do not give importer with her 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:04.909
 it tastes very sweet so it stands 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:07.139
 there is also artificial aroma 

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:09.090
 That's probably the coconut 

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:13.650
 only as an artificial flavor then I have 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:15.569
 All three have bitten 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:19.979
 that is was every time a 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:24.060
 chocolate in there and therefore no 

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:25.610
 Imagine what he still has to do with coconut 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:31.340
 should have 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:31.340
 the next is that 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:40.979
 So it's okay to say so 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:45.810
 the packaging of course still nice 

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:49.650
 so that the taste comes 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:51.080
 somehow yes it does not dry up and 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:59.039
 which means in German 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:05:00.930
 it's not that's a window on 

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:02.940
 so I've actually turn the 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:06.560
 it's just nothing is missing there 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:09.449
 that's so ordinary the normal 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:12.659
 eminems just that one coconut aroma 

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:14.819
 touched and therefore only that 

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:17.880
 it tastes especially good then 

00:05:14.819 --> 00:05:18.900
 thank you for not just an ok 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:21.599
 it was a bit too 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:24.240
 cooled only at the end of the defense 

00:05:21.599 --> 00:05:26.940
 but thanks for seeing and if you guys 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:28.259

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:30.719
 to get the stuff 

00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:33.090
 I'm already crazy for us 

00:05:30.719 --> 00:05:34.770
 Not at all what you imagine 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:36.360
 would be crazy and where then in the 

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:38.340
 testing turns out that's not 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:40.050
 I always try to cool it 

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:45.419
