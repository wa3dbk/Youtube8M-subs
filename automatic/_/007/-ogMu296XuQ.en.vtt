00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:11.129
 results from the

 nelore curio emotion 

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:17.379
 I always use little again 

00:00:18.419 --> 00:00:21.839
 75% of the European population 

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:23.499

 of blood from Mozambique the 50% saints he met 

00:00:28.749 --> 00:00:30.849
 this basis here 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:34.050
 is that they will use us again would be little 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.050
 was produced pc 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
 and when you can try to potentiate this phase 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:50.280
 the wake you do that I got very structured back the cd because you 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.360
 like a different drink 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.180
 we are in the whole month of October in September 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.660
 you will go to my room 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:04.089
 I go 40 and so many days without rain the country cut off the four-legged animals 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:11.160
 as protagonists of the action of motorcycle the public both are against bush to little 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.240
 which is unlikely

 this genetic experiment 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.190
 Fantastic 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.820
 it's the ps 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.230
 my uncle the extreme action 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:43.860
 quality 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.110
