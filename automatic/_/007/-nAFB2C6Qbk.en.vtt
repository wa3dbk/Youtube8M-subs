 hello friends welcome to another 

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:07.300
 presentation of cautious I buy my name 

00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:10.389
 is Pablo crochet and today we will be 

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:13.269
 showing the new infiniti juve x 70 is 

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:15.160
 2015 this model of nationally in 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:16.630
 a line and the only decision there 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.680
 that taking the time to acquire it is 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:19.150
 our preference in what is 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.500
 rear- wheel drive or four-wheel drive 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.320
 wheels of the model that we are driving 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.730
 today it is rear-wheel drive although this 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.699
 model was introduced more than 10 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:30.970
 years like the fx model the line continues 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:34.450
 being aggressive and sports do not present 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:36.010
 many notable changes in what is the 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:38.050
 vehicle line one of the changes 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:40.480
 most remarkable we have this year is the 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.399
 absence of 5.0 v8 engine that infinite 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:45.190
 stopped producing for this kind of 

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:47.770
 model outside this model the model s 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.899
 presents details in another color tone 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:51.699
 such as the black in this detail what 

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:53.559
 are the 21 inch aluminum wheels 

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:55.090
 the black grille mirrors 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:57.820
 mirrors that are automatically 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:59.170
 retractable and heated part 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.480
 of the vehicle at the exits of 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.699
 air is black what a look is 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:06.400
 more still more sporting this also 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:08.710
 model presents the lights by xenon has 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.490

 and it knows with on off also also without 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.270
 key 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.219
 this vehicle is a crossover that we 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:21.119
 offers the same luxury and power 

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:23.969
 these thanks to a 3.7 v6 engine 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.950
 which produces 325 our 167 forces 

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:28.710
 pounds of torque this combined with the 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.439
 rear-wheel drive a transmission of 7 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.149
 automatic speeds and a suspension 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:36.060
 sports allows us to accelerate from 0 to 60 

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:37.950
 in just 6 seconds seconds as soon as 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.479
 to consumption this vehicle 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.670
 get a combined consumption between 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.920
 city ​​highway 19 miles per gallon 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.140
 as for the security of this 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.479
 vehicle offers electronic controls 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.009
 of traction and stability and brakes 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.099
 anti-lock this vehicle brake 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:58.020
 only 120 feet at a speed of 60 

00:01:53.099 --> 00:01:59.579
 to 0 we also have what are bags of 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.799
 front and side for 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:04.129
 front seats for seats 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:06.900
 We have rear air curtains 

00:02:04.129 --> 00:02:09.869
 complete on both sides 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.880
 we also have output sensors from 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.950
 lane sensors of possible accident 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.920
 frontal which alert us to 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.540
 any possibility of accident 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.000
 this discreetly a system of four 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:24.750
 cameras which offers us a vision 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.850
 of 360 degrees apart from that we have 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.260
 front and rear cameras and we have 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.660
 front and rear sensors too 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:33.210
 to assist us in space where the 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:35.550
 place where space is reduced 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:38.910
 the lifting system also has a 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:40.590
 distance control system which 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.930
 not only retains the extension of 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.480
 vehicle ahead of us but also 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.190
 has a laser system which 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.440
 detects traffic speed 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:52.380
 around us in traffic 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.360
 the vehicle is congested and decelerated 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:57.030
 maintains from accelerating keeping the 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:03:00.540
 distance or the speed of traffic in 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:03.690
 Overall, the handling is accurate thanks to 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.500
 the sports suspension and the powerful 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.850
 brakes 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.730

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:11.490
 behind the wheel the ride is rigid and 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:14.220
 sporty especially with the rims 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:17.130

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:19.230

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:24.630
 vehicle the head is well isolated from 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:26.010
 external sound where when one presses 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:28.769
 to the accelerator 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:31.200
 and explode all that power is 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:32.459
 feel the exhaust pipes taking out all that 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.849
 power what gives a handle 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:37.409
