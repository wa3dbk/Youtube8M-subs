00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:08.000
 (An inspiring journey from Java to Bali) 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.160
 (Sri Lestali rides her modified motorcycle across 1200 km) 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.240
 (From Jakarta all the way to Bali) 

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:13.840
 (telling an inspiring journey) 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.040
 (Web Video 4: Bali Island!) 

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:26.520
 I made the final sprint to East Java. 

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:28.720
 This process has passed quickly 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.240
 A grandson with a grandson in Jasmine (Day 13th, Jasmine, East Java) 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.440
 Impressed by my experience (over 530 km from the final line of Bali) 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.800
 Sri, please continue to pray 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.560
 Let my grandson walk again 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.280
 Someone in Mozokto escorted me into the city 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.800
 A full day of rain in Studeadok 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:56.760
 (The 19th day, East South Dream of East Java is 140 kilometers from the final line of Bali Island) 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.360
 Nineteenth day 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:03.120
 I went to the southernmost dream of the easternmost state of Java. 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.480
 Famous Indonesian photographer Rio Hermi 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.680
 Stayed with me for a few days 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.960
 Rio travels all over Indonesia 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.840
 I have witnessed the status quo of the disabled 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.600
 Indonesia has laws 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.240
 Protect the rights of disabled people 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:25.800
 But rarely implemented 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.080
 When I was young 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.640
 Most people with disabilities only stay at home 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.080
 until today 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.960
 I am almost 60 years old. 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.680
 It’s been a long time 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.200
 This situation has not changed 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:45.720
 (The 20th day, Java Island to Bali Island Ferry is 120 kilometers from the finish line) 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.920
 I feel like a celebrity when I got on the boat. 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.240
 Everyone wants to come and say hello 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.640
 After a 20-day journey 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.120
 Bali Island! 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.680
 Very excited 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.320
 I am going along the north route. 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.000
 Picturesque 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.760
 Finally came to Rottweiler Beach 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.000
 The locals are very curious 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.680
 So beautiful 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.200
 On the 21st day, I got up early (the 21st day of Rottweiler Beach, Bali) 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.360
 We are going to see dolphins (80 km from the finish line) 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.920
 This is my first time taking a boat 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.440
 Also my first time watching dolphins 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.400
 On the return trip back to the beach 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.160
 Another first time 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.520
 Swim in the sea 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:54.360
 I like 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.320
 awesome 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.040
 Around Indonesia 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.560
 There are small NGOs that help people with disabilities 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.880
 One of the "high-five" of Rottweiler Beach is one of them. 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:16.640
 There are many types of modified motorcycles 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.840
 My journey has inspired two of my employees. 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.880
 They asked if I could join for a few days. 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:30.600
 I have never participated in a modified motorcycle fleet. 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:35.520
 So I really want to try 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.480
 I am very happy to be with them. 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.160
 We are on the road together. 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.480
 (Twenty-second day, Ubud, Bali, 25 km from the finish line) 

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:49.440
 Today my journey is about to end. 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.480
 I am going to the finish line in Ubud. 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:57.240
 Then go to Denpasar, the capital of Bali 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.640
 Her behavior is too great 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.200
 Today more than 50 people follow me. 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.720
 Everyone seems to be happy to ride with me. 

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:11.000
 I was a little excited for the first time. 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.640
 Very happy, I want to cry... 

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:17.640
 - departure - departure 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.520
 In those dark and sad years after my accident 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.560
 I don’t even think about it. 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.360
 I will have what I am doing today. 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.360
 (breaking thunder ship Seri) 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:51.600
 I did it 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:58.640
 From Jakarta to 1200 km to Bali Island 

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:04.800
 I hope other people with disabilities can be inspired 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:08.840
 I hope they can feel that nothing can't be done. 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.080
 I haven't finished yet. 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:16.560
 One of the sponsors, "The Surfing Girl" on the second day 

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.280
 Prepared a surprise for me 

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:21.000
 Today we are going to take you to the surf 

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:23.800
 They want me to surf 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:25.560
 (Foreign Language) 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.680
 We headed to the famous Bali Kuta Surf Beach 

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:43.840
 Relax 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:49.880
 Kneeling on the surfboard in the sea 

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:53.120
 Feel like I jumped up 

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:56.080
 This is the feeling that I have never had since I happened. 

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:01.080
 The sea gives me the freedom I can’t enjoy on land. 

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:02.920
 so fun 

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:06.120
 It’s all like a dream. 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.080
 The dream comes true 

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:12.720
 Review now 

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:17.120
 The past two weeks have been the happiest time of my life. 

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:21.720
 My original intention is to let people see the possibilities. 

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:26.040
 Share your experience and inspire others 

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:27.720
 I think I did it. 

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:30.640
 I am looking forward to next year. 

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:33.840
 Who knows which island I will cross? 

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:47.600
