Mercedes diesel guy and I'm here to talk
to<00:00:05.910> you<00:00:06.000> about<00:00:06.089> a<00:00:06.210> possible<00:00:06.540> oil<00:00:07.049> pressure

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:08.300 
to you about a possible oil pressure

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:14.629 
to you about a possible oil pressure
problem<00:00:09.300> on<00:00:09.570> my<00:00:09.900> 1991<00:00:10.740> VW<00:00:11.160> Vanagon<00:00:11.550> I<00:00:13.639> recently

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
problem on my 1991 VW Vanagon I recently

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.490 
problem on my 1991 VW Vanagon I recently
did<00:00:15.000> a<00:00:15.059> lot<00:00:15.240> of<00:00:15.330> repairs<00:00:15.660> including<00:00:17.390> you<00:00:18.390> know

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:18.500 
did a lot of repairs including you know

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.529 
did a lot of repairs including you know
fixing<00:00:19.500> oil<00:00:19.710> leaks<00:00:20.039> and<00:00:20.670> installing<00:00:21.210> new<00:00:21.300> oil

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.029 
fixing oil leaks and installing new oil
pressure<00:00:21.840> sensors<00:00:22.320> and<00:00:22.500> I<00:00:22.529> took<00:00:22.590> it<00:00:22.769> out<00:00:22.859> for

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
pressure sensors and I took it out for

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.310 
pressure sensors and I took it out for
its<00:00:23.160> first<00:00:23.400> real<00:00:23.730> long<00:00:24.000> drive<00:00:24.390> this<00:00:25.080> past

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
its first real long drive this past

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.849 
its first real long drive this past
weekend<00:00:25.769> and<00:00:26.779> it<00:00:27.779> was<00:00:27.810> dark<00:00:28.140> on<00:00:28.439> the<00:00:28.590> way<00:00:28.680> back

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
weekend and it was dark on the way back

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.429 
weekend and it was dark on the way back
at<00:00:29.670> operating<00:00:30.449> temperature<00:00:30.570> in<00:00:31.109> highway

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
at operating temperature in highway

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.580 
at operating temperature in highway
speed<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:32.489> oil<00:00:32.730> pressure<00:00:33.059> light<00:00:33.410> blinked<00:00:34.410> and

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
speed the oil pressure light blinked and

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.819 
speed the oil pressure light blinked and
the<00:00:35.190> buzzer<00:00:35.610> went<00:00:35.880> off<00:00:35.940> so<00:00:36.620> pulled<00:00:37.620> it<00:00:37.739> over

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
the buzzer went off so pulled it over

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:38.630 
the buzzer went off so pulled it over
shut<00:00:38.190> it<00:00:38.280> off

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
shut it off

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.510 
shut it off
checked<00:00:38.940> plenty<00:00:39.780> of<00:00:39.870> oil<00:00:39.960> in<00:00:40.170> it<00:00:40.460> started<00:00:41.460> it

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
checked plenty of oil in it started it

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.650 
checked plenty of oil in it started it
up<00:00:41.579> again<00:00:41.850> and<00:00:42.829> it<00:00:43.829> behaved<00:00:44.520> just<00:00:44.789> fine<00:00:45.000> so<00:00:45.329> I

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
up again and it behaved just fine so I

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.299 
up again and it behaved just fine so I
drove<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.079> last<00:00:46.289> 30<00:00:46.500> miles<00:00:46.739> home<00:00:46.980> and<00:00:47.160> I<00:00:47.219> was

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
drove the last 30 miles home and I was

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:48.470 
drove the last 30 miles home and I was
again<00:00:47.460> as<00:00:47.700> I<00:00:47.789> was<00:00:47.820> getting<00:00:47.969> off<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.210> highway

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
again as I was getting off the highway

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.290 
again as I was getting off the highway
the<00:00:49.460> started<00:00:50.460> acting<00:00:50.760> up<00:00:50.820> again

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
the started acting up again

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.910 
the started acting up again
I<00:00:51.329> noticed<00:00:51.840> if<00:00:51.930> I<00:00:51.989> put<00:00:52.170> it<00:00:52.230> into<00:00:52.469> neutral<00:00:52.800> and

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
I noticed if I put it into neutral and

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.290 
I noticed if I put it into neutral and
gave<00:00:53.039> it<00:00:53.129> some<00:00:53.250> more<00:00:53.340> gas<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:53.760> pressure<00:00:54.000> the

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
gave it some more gas the pressure the

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.049 
gave it some more gas the pressure the
light<00:00:54.660> would<00:00:54.870> go<00:00:54.899> out<00:00:55.370> meaning<00:00:56.370> that<00:00:56.640> the

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
light would go out meaning that the

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.380 
light would go out meaning that the
sensor<00:00:57.420> seems<00:00:58.250> to<00:00:59.250> be<00:00:59.370> reading<00:00:59.670> properly<00:01:00.180> and

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
sensor seems to be reading properly and

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.420 
sensor seems to be reading properly and
that<00:01:00.960> by<00:01:01.170> reason<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.530> RPMs<00:01:01.920> are<00:01:02.070> raised<00:01:02.340> the

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
that by reason the RPMs are raised the

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.810 
that by reason the RPMs are raised the
oil<00:01:02.670> pressure<00:01:03.000> and<00:01:03.949> then<00:01:04.949> no<00:01:05.129> longer<00:01:05.189> sensed<00:01:05.760> a

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
oil pressure and then no longer sensed a

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.700 
oil pressure and then no longer sensed a
problem<00:01:06.210> so<00:01:06.390> I've<00:01:06.930> got<00:01:07.080> one<00:01:07.229> of<00:01:07.320> two<00:01:07.439> things

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
problem so I've got one of two things

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.620 
problem so I've got one of two things
happening<00:01:08.070> here<00:01:08.130> either<00:01:08.610> a<00:01:08.760> false<00:01:09.119> reading

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
happening here either a false reading

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.690 
happening here either a false reading
off<00:01:09.750> that<00:01:09.960> sensor<00:01:10.380> or<00:01:10.590> a<00:01:10.619> real<00:01:11.130> oil<00:01:11.520> pressure

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
off that sensor or a real oil pressure

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.620 
off that sensor or a real oil pressure
problem<00:01:13.790> if<00:01:14.790> it's<00:01:14.939> a<00:01:15.000> real<00:01:15.119> global<00:01:15.330> pressure

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
problem if it's a real global pressure

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.980 
problem if it's a real global pressure
problem<00:01:16.080> one<00:01:16.290> and<00:01:17.150> there<00:01:18.150> are<00:01:18.180> two<00:01:18.479> likely

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
problem one and there are two likely

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.719 
problem one and there are two likely
culprits<00:01:19.710> here<00:01:20.330> sorry<00:01:21.680> one<00:01:22.680> of<00:01:22.710> them<00:01:22.890> is<00:01:23.159> the

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
culprits here sorry one of them is the

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.090 
culprits here sorry one of them is the
oil<00:01:24.240> filter<00:01:24.540> I'm<00:01:24.720> using<00:01:24.930> since<00:01:25.740> I've<00:01:25.860> had<00:01:25.979> the

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
oil filter I'm using since I've had the

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.190 
oil filter I'm using since I've had the
van<00:01:26.250> involve<00:01:26.549> used<00:01:26.850> almost<00:01:27.210> exclusively<00:01:27.390> the

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
van involve used almost exclusively the

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
Frane pH 287 zero a filter and I've

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.770 
Frane pH 287 zero a filter and I've
never<00:01:35.579> had<00:01:35.820> a<00:01:35.850> problem<00:01:36.030> with<00:01:36.180> it<00:01:36.329> four<00:01:36.600> and

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
never had a problem with it four and

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.580 
never had a problem with it four and
eight<00:01:36.930> years<00:01:37.259> 36,000<00:01:38.220> miles<00:01:38.400> but<00:01:39.439> we<00:01:40.439> have

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
eight years 36,000 miles but we have

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.319 
eight years 36,000 miles but we have
every<00:01:40.770> 6,000<00:01:41.310> miles<00:01:41.460> worth<00:01:41.640> of<00:01:41.729> oil<00:01:41.820> changes

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
every 6,000 miles worth of oil changes

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.149 
every 6,000 miles worth of oil changes
isn't<00:01:42.659> all<00:01:42.810> that<00:01:42.840> much<00:01:43.020> it's<00:01:43.439> possible<00:01:43.920> I<00:01:43.979> just

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
isn't all that much it's possible I just

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.300 
isn't all that much it's possible I just
got<00:01:44.310> lucky<00:01:44.490> so<00:01:44.820> far<00:01:45.030> so<00:01:46.189> upon<00:01:47.189> the

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
got lucky so far so upon the

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.859 
got lucky so far so upon the
recommendation<00:01:47.850> of<00:01:47.909> others<00:01:48.180> online<00:01:48.360> and<00:01:48.750> I've

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
recommendation of others online and I've

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.630 
recommendation of others online and I've
ordered<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:49.380> correct<00:01:49.649> German<00:01:50.130> oil<00:01:50.280> filter

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
ordered the correct German oil filter

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.389 
ordered the correct German oil filter
for<00:01:50.820> this<00:01:50.909> then<00:01:51.810> and<00:01:52.110> it<00:01:52.590> is<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:53.149> Molly<00:01:54.149> OC

00:01:55.389 --> 00:01:55.399 
for this then and it is the Molly OC

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:58.200 
for this then and it is the Molly OC
1:08<00:01:56.399> filter<00:01:56.850> and

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210 
1:08 filter and

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:00.780 
1:08 filter and
if<00:01:58.720> I<00:01:58.840> can<00:01:58.960> get<00:01:59.050> this<00:01:59.170> to<00:01:59.230> focus<00:01:59.560> on<00:01:59.740> this<00:02:00.340> small

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:00.790 
if I can get this to focus on this small

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:03.680 
if I can get this to focus on this small
print<00:02:01.060> here<00:02:01.330> you<00:02:01.420> can<00:02:01.540> see<00:02:01.750> the<00:02:02.130> it's<00:02:03.130> got<00:02:03.280> the

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:03.690 
print here you can see the it's got the

print here you can see the it's got the
and<00:02:04.690> maybe<00:02:05.590> I<00:02:05.740> can't<00:02:06.480> but<00:02:07.480> it's<00:02:07.750> got<00:02:07.900> the<00:02:07.990> VW

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
and maybe I can't but it's got the VW

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.950 
and maybe I can't but it's got the VW
part<00:02:08.770> number<00:02:09.130> kind<00:02:09.910> of<00:02:10.000> right<00:02:10.420> here<00:02:11.730> so<00:02:12.960> and

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:13.960 
part number kind of right here so and

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:18.780 
part number kind of right here so and
this<00:02:14.950> is<00:02:15.010> what<00:02:15.340> the<00:02:15.490> collect<00:02:16.650> filter<00:02:17.790> looks

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
this is what the collect filter looks

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.010 
this is what the collect filter looks
like<00:02:19.060> so<00:02:21.060> this<00:02:22.060> is<00:02:22.120> gonna<00:02:22.330> be<00:02:22.420> one<00:02:22.630> thing<00:02:22.870> I'm

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.020 
like so this is gonna be one thing I'm

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:24.390 
like so this is gonna be one thing I'm
installing<00:02:23.350> this<00:02:23.500> weekend<00:02:23.920> they've<00:02:24.040> had<00:02:24.190> I've

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
installing this weekend they've had I've

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.860 
installing this weekend they've had I've
got<00:02:24.520> to<00:02:24.610> drain<00:02:24.790> out<00:02:24.970> the<00:02:25.000> oil<00:02:25.240> to<00:02:25.480> do<00:02:25.600> all<00:02:25.720> this

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
got to drain out the oil to do all this

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.270 
got to drain out the oil to do all this
work<00:02:26.080> so<00:02:26.350> I<00:02:26.380> may<00:02:26.560> as<00:02:26.620> well<00:02:26.680> do<00:02:26.860> everything<00:02:27.190> all

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
work so I may as well do everything all

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.699 
work so I may as well do everything all
at<00:02:27.310> once<00:02:29.520> new<00:02:30.520> filter<00:02:31.000> quite<00:02:31.870> possibly<00:02:32.380> a<00:02:32.680> new

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
at once new filter quite possibly a new

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:35.790 
at once new filter quite possibly a new
high<00:02:33.190> pressure<00:02:33.489> sensor<00:02:33.970> and<00:02:34.500> what<00:02:35.500> I'm<00:02:35.590> also

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
high pressure sensor and what I'm also

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:41.430 
high pressure sensor and what I'm also
gonna<00:02:36.100> do<00:02:36.370> is<00:02:37.739> and<00:02:40.020> what<00:02:41.020> I'm<00:02:41.110> also<00:02:41.230> going<00:02:41.380> to

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
gonna do is and what I'm also going to

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.110 
gonna do is and what I'm also going to
do<00:02:41.560> is<00:02:41.800> actually<00:02:42.340> add<00:02:42.790> an<00:02:43.110> oil<00:02:44.110> pressure<00:02:44.410> gauge

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
do is actually add an oil pressure gauge

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.910 
do is actually add an oil pressure gauge
to<00:02:46.120> the<00:02:46.150> dashboard<00:02:46.420> because<00:02:47.290> the<00:02:47.500> monitoring

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
to the dashboard because the monitoring

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.170 
to the dashboard because the monitoring
system<00:02:48.220> doesn't<00:02:48.489> give<00:02:48.610> you<00:02:48.670> a<00:02:48.730> number<00:02:48.940> it<00:02:49.120> just

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
system doesn't give you a number it just

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:50.640 
system doesn't give you a number it just
tells<00:02:49.510> you<00:02:49.630> whether<00:02:49.810> or<00:02:49.959> not<00:02:50.140> there's<00:02:50.560> a

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
tells you whether or not there's a

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.920 
tells you whether or not there's a
problem<00:02:50.890> if<00:02:51.580> the<00:02:51.700> system<00:02:51.970> fails<00:02:52.000> it<00:02:52.630> gives<00:02:52.810> you

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
problem if the system fails it gives you

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:54.710 
problem if the system fails it gives you
a<00:02:52.959> false<00:02:53.260> reading<00:02:53.590> of<00:02:53.980> a<00:02:54.100> problem<00:02:54.459> and<00:02:54.580> that's

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
a false reading of a problem and that's

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.060 
a false reading of a problem and that's
that<00:02:55.720> may<00:02:55.959> be<00:02:56.020> what's<00:02:56.260> happening<00:02:56.380> now<00:02:56.770> but

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.070 
that may be what's happening now but

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:59.630 
that may be what's happening now but
more<00:02:57.250> likely<00:02:57.489> I<00:02:57.880> actually<00:02:58.690> have<00:02:58.989> a<00:02:59.020> problem

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
more likely I actually have a problem

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.880 
more likely I actually have a problem
once<00:03:00.640> again<00:03:00.820> most<00:03:01.000> likely<00:03:01.320> if<00:03:02.320> it's<00:03:02.470> a<00:03:02.590> problem

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
once again most likely if it's a problem

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:08.190 
once again most likely if it's a problem
it's<00:03:02.950> the<00:03:03.130> oil<00:03:03.160> filter<00:03:03.580> and<00:03:04.709> if<00:03:05.709> not<00:03:07.200> slightly

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
it's the oil filter and if not slightly

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.580 
it's the oil filter and if not slightly
less<00:03:08.650> likely<00:03:09.030> the<00:03:10.030> engine<00:03:10.450> is<00:03:10.720> just<00:03:11.140> worn<00:03:11.440> out

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
less likely the engine is just worn out

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.800 
less likely the engine is just worn out
and<00:03:11.890> past<00:03:12.160> its<00:03:12.370> prime<00:03:12.640> and<00:03:13.030> just<00:03:13.420> won't<00:03:13.600> hold

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
and past its prime and just won't hold

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.590 
and past its prime and just won't hold
oil<00:03:14.320> pressure<00:03:14.650> anymore<00:03:14.980> so<00:03:15.370> I'm<00:03:16.209> hoping

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:16.600 
oil pressure anymore so I'm hoping

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.020 
oil pressure anymore so I'm hoping
that's<00:03:16.780> not<00:03:16.930> the<00:03:17.049> case<00:03:17.760> we'll<00:03:18.760> see<00:03:18.910> what

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
that's not the case we'll see what

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.590 
that's not the case we'll see what
happens

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:19.600 
happens

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.960 
happens
wish<00:03:20.440> me<00:03:20.620> luck<00:03:20.650> I'll<00:03:21.040> do<00:03:21.220> more<00:03:21.430> video<00:03:21.700> of<00:03:21.850> all

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
wish me luck I'll do more video of all

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.449 
wish me luck I'll do more video of all
that<00:03:22.150> this<00:03:22.269> weekend<00:03:22.690> but<00:03:23.350> by<00:03:23.830> installing<00:03:24.250> a

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:24.459 
that this weekend but by installing a

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:26.250 
that this weekend but by installing a
gauge<00:03:24.670> I'll<00:03:24.910> get<00:03:25.060> an<00:03:25.150> actual<00:03:25.600> numerical

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
gauge I'll get an actual numerical

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.620 
gauge I'll get an actual numerical
reading<00:03:27.130> of<00:03:27.220> the<00:03:27.280> pressure<00:03:27.519> and<00:03:27.820> I<00:03:28.299> can<00:03:28.450> just

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
reading of the pressure and I can just

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:30.930 
reading of the pressure and I can just
compare<00:03:28.930> that<00:03:29.140> against<00:03:29.650> you<00:03:30.610> know<00:03:30.700> what<00:03:30.850> the

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
compare that against you know what the

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:32.850 
compare that against you know what the
factory<00:03:31.299> specification<00:03:31.989> is<00:03:32.110> and<00:03:32.320> if<00:03:32.709> it's

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:32.860 
factory specification is and if it's

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:35.539 
factory specification is and if it's
still<00:03:32.920> within<00:03:33.280> specification<00:03:34.060> all<00:03:34.989> is<00:03:35.290> good

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549 
still within specification all is good

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:40.740 
still within specification all is good
if<00:03:36.549> not<00:03:37.680> that<00:03:38.680> means<00:03:38.860> that<00:03:39.250> the<00:03:40.060> engine<00:03:40.450> is

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
if not that means that the engine is

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.979 
if not that means that the engine is
worn-out<00:03:41.380> and<00:03:41.970> it's<00:03:42.970> probably<00:03:43.269> time<00:03:43.720> for<00:03:43.750> me

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:43.989 
worn-out and it's probably time for me

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:46.199 
worn-out and it's probably time for me
to<00:03:44.140> park<00:03:44.410> it<00:03:44.620> take<00:03:45.220> the<00:03:45.340> blades<00:03:45.579> off<00:03:45.820> and<00:03:46.120> then

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:46.209 
to park it take the blades off and then

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:48.150 
to park it take the blades off and then
start<00:03:46.420> planning<00:03:46.750> for<00:03:47.110> my<00:03:47.200> subaru<00:03:47.590> conversion

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.160 
start planning for my subaru conversion

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:49.199 
start planning for my subaru conversion
which<00:03:48.310> is<00:03:48.459> something<00:03:48.670> I've<00:03:48.850> been<00:03:48.880> meaning<00:03:49.180> to

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
which is something I've been meaning to

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:52.020 
which is something I've been meaning to
do<00:03:49.390> for<00:03:49.690> a<00:03:49.720> long<00:03:50.049> time<00:03:50.350> but<00:03:50.560> I<00:03:50.769> didn't<00:03:51.760> want<00:03:51.910> to

have<00:04:12.140> had<00:04:12.290> a<00:04:12.320> lot<00:04:12.470> of<00:04:12.590> experience<00:04:13.040> that<00:04:13.160> then

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:13.280 
have had a lot of experience that then

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.120 
have had a lot of experience that then
we've<00:04:13.400> had<00:04:13.520> the<00:04:13.730> Vanagon<00:04:14.600> Xin<00:04:14.810> my<00:04:14.990> family<00:04:15.680> my

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
we've had the Vanagon Xin my family my

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:18.610 
we've had the Vanagon Xin my family my
parents<00:04:16.310> have<00:04:16.580> had<00:04:16.700> them<00:04:16.820> since<00:04:17.000> 1985<00:04:17.690> that<00:04:18.500> in

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620 
parents have had them since 1985 that in

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:22.150 
parents have had them since 1985 that in
mine<00:04:18.799> now<00:04:19.070> since<00:04:19.430> 2003<00:04:20.269> so<00:04:20.620> this<00:04:21.620> is<00:04:21.769> nothing

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:22.160 
mine now since 2003 so this is nothing

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:27.010 
mine now since 2003 so this is nothing
new<00:04:22.520> to<00:04:22.550> me<00:04:22.700> I'm<00:04:24.100> really<00:04:25.100> familiar<00:04:25.760> with<00:04:26.300> all

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020 
new to me I'm really familiar with all

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.520 
new to me I'm really familiar with all
their<00:04:27.290> problems<00:04:27.470> and<00:04:27.950> quirks<00:04:28.250> and<00:04:28.700> I<00:04:29.530> just

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:30.530 
their problems and quirks and I just

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:32.860 
their problems and quirks and I just
plain<00:04:30.800> don't<00:04:31.040> like<00:04:31.190> the<00:04:31.520> Volkswagen<00:04:32.210> water

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 
plain don't like the Volkswagen water

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:35.340 
plain don't like the Volkswagen water
boxer<00:04:33.290> engine

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:35.350 
boxer engine

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:38.740 
boxer engine
they<00:04:36.350> basically<00:04:37.090> you<00:04:38.090> know<00:04:38.180> air-cooled

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:38.750 
they basically you know air-cooled

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:40.510 
they basically you know air-cooled
that's<00:04:39.200> art<00:04:39.380> took<00:04:39.740> the<00:04:39.890> air-cooled<00:04:40.250> engine

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:40.520 
that's art took the air-cooled engine

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:44.530 
that's art took the air-cooled engine
they<00:04:40.610> had<00:04:40.730> at<00:04:40.850> the<00:04:40.910> end<00:04:41.030> of<00:04:41.120> the<00:04:41.210> 70s<00:04:41.630> and<00:04:43.540> kind

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:44.540 
they had at the end of the 70s and kind

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:46.720 
they had at the end of the 70s and kind
of<00:04:44.690> you<00:04:45.620> know<00:04:45.710> water-cooled<00:04:46.310> that<00:04:46.460> almost

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:46.730 
of you know water-cooled that almost

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:48.790 
of you know water-cooled that almost
doesn't<00:04:46.880> afterthought<00:04:47.390> and<00:04:47.660> there<00:04:48.590> have<00:04:48.710> been

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:48.800 
doesn't afterthought and there have been

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.460 
doesn't afterthought and there have been
and<00:04:49.250> I<00:04:50.030> don't<00:04:50.480> think<00:04:50.750> it<00:04:50.810> was<00:04:50.900> engineered

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:51.470 
and I don't think it was engineered

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:55.720 
and I don't think it was engineered
properly<00:04:52.310> and<00:04:53.080> it<00:04:54.080> just<00:04:54.290> displays<00:04:55.070> too<00:04:55.520> many

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:55.730 
properly and it just displays too many

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:58.900 
properly and it just displays too many
problems<00:04:56.260> at<00:04:57.260> too<00:04:57.590> low<00:04:57.620> a<00:04:57.950> mileage<00:04:58.490> for<00:04:58.730> me<00:04:58.820> to

00:04:58.900 --> 00:04:58.910 
problems at too low a mileage for me to

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:04.000 
problems at too low a mileage for me to
consider<00:04:59.210> it<00:04:59.330> a<00:04:59.510> really<00:04:59.750> good<00:04:59.870> engine<00:05:00.260> so<00:05:00.500> I<00:05:03.010> if

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:04.010 
consider it a really good engine so I if

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:05.950 
consider it a really good engine so I if
I<00:05:04.220> have<00:05:04.370> to<00:05:04.490> replace<00:05:04.700> it<00:05:05.030> I'm<00:05:05.240> gonna<00:05:05.420> put<00:05:05.600> in<00:05:05.690> a

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:05.960 
I have to replace it I'm gonna put in a

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:08.260 
I have to replace it I'm gonna put in a
Subaru<00:05:06.320> engine<00:05:06.680> and<00:05:07.220> there's<00:05:07.910> a<00:05:07.970> lot<00:05:08.090> of<00:05:08.180> other

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:08.270 
Subaru engine and there's a lot of other

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:10.540 
Subaru engine and there's a lot of other
engine<00:05:09.020> conversions<00:05:09.800> to<00:05:09.950> consider<00:05:10.280> I

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:10.550 
engine conversions to consider I

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:12.430 
engine conversions to consider I
actually<00:05:11.120> don't<00:05:11.390> want<00:05:11.510> another<00:05:11.780> Volkswagen

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:12.440 
actually don't want another Volkswagen

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:14.290 
actually don't want another Volkswagen

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:20.060 
engines a lot of people report problems

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:22.240

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:30.130 
good option for the conversion is the

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:35.050 
good option for the conversion is the

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:35.060 
loss TIG affords e-tec conversion and

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:37.780 
loss TIG affords e-tec conversion and
I've<00:05:35.330> seen<00:05:35.540> those<00:05:35.690> in<00:05:35.750> person<00:05:36.110> and<00:05:36.800> I've

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:37.790 
I've seen those in person and I've

they're good guys and the I mean their
hardware<00:05:46.850> is<00:05:47.000> top-notch<00:05:47.419> I<00:05:48.020> can't<00:05:48.380> fault<00:05:48.650> it

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:48.830 
hardware is top-notch I can't fault it

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:51.250 
hardware is top-notch I can't fault it
but<00:05:49.550> for<00:05:49.790> me<00:05:49.940> since<00:05:50.330> I've<00:05:50.510> had<00:05:50.660> so<00:05:50.990> much

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:51.260 
but for me since I've had so much

but for me since I've had so much
experience<00:05:51.980> now<00:05:52.760> with<00:05:53.030> the<00:05:53.180> Subaru<00:05:53.360> ej20<00:05:53.960> 2

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:54.350 
experience now with the Subaru ej20 2

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:58.000 
experience now with the Subaru ej20 2
engine<00:05:54.710> actually<00:05:55.460> in<00:05:55.850> the<00:05:56.510> Subaru<00:05:56.840> Legacy<00:05:57.050> I

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:58.010 
engine actually in the Subaru Legacy I

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:02.189 
engine actually in the Subaru Legacy I
know<00:05:58.370> that<00:05:58.700> engines<00:05:59.060> so<00:05:59.300> well<00:05:59.630> and<00:06:00.280> so

00:06:02.189 --> 00:06:02.199 
know that engines so well and so

00:06:02.199 --> 00:06:04.290 
know that engines so well and so
it's<00:06:02.740> generally<00:06:03.219> pleased<00:06:03.789> with<00:06:03.999> that<00:06:04.030> engine

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:04.300 
it's generally pleased with that engine

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:06.779 
it's generally pleased with that engine
and<00:06:04.749> how<00:06:05.680> easy<00:06:05.919> it<00:06:06.069> is<00:06:06.189> to<00:06:06.370> service<00:06:06.759> that

00:06:06.779 --> 00:06:06.789 
and how easy it is to service that

00:06:06.789 --> 00:06:09.270 
and how easy it is to service that
that's<00:06:07.569> the<00:06:07.840> engine<00:06:08.169> I'm<00:06:08.620> gonna<00:06:08.830> want<00:06:09.069> in<00:06:09.189> the

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:09.280 
that's the engine I'm gonna want in the

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:11.519 
that's the engine I'm gonna want in the
van<00:06:09.460> if<00:06:09.909> I<00:06:10.030> need<00:06:10.180> a<00:06:10.210> new<00:06:10.330> engine<00:06:10.449> so<00:06:10.840> I'm<00:06:11.379> gonna

00:06:11.519 --> 00:06:11.529 
van if I need a new engine so I'm gonna

00:06:11.529 --> 00:06:14.850 
van if I need a new engine so I'm gonna
cut<00:06:11.710> this<00:06:11.800> video<00:06:11.949> off<00:06:12.189> now<00:06:12.219> and<00:06:12.699> hopefully<00:06:13.860> you

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:14.860 
cut this video off now and hopefully you

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:17.639 
cut this video off now and hopefully you
know<00:06:14.919> everything<00:06:15.279> be<00:06:15.400> all<00:06:15.520> right
