00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:21.329 
but anyway this is cornmeal but the corn

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:23.929 
but anyway this is cornmeal but the corn
has<00:01:21.540> been<00:01:21.720> treated<00:01:22.049> with<00:01:22.079> lye<00:01:22.560> first<00:01:23.040> and<00:01:23.490> it

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
has been treated with lye first and it

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.120 
has been treated with lye first and it
breaks<00:01:24.570> it<00:01:24.720> down<00:01:24.750> in<00:01:24.990> a<00:01:25.079> different<00:01:25.200> way<00:01:25.470> I've

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
breaks it down in a different way I've

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.069 
breaks it down in a different way I've
seen<00:01:26.430> recipes<00:01:26.850> that<00:01:27.030> call<00:01:27.180> for<00:01:27.240> like<00:01:27.689> just

00:01:28.069 --> 00:01:28.079 
seen recipes that call for like just

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:30.170 
seen recipes that call for like just
regular<00:01:28.380> cornmeal<00:01:28.979> which<00:01:29.370> I<00:01:29.700> guess<00:01:29.940> you<00:01:29.970> could

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
regular cornmeal which I guess you could

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.910 
regular cornmeal which I guess you could
do<00:01:30.300> that<00:01:30.420> but<00:01:30.720> it<00:01:30.780> wouldn't<00:01:31.080> exactly<00:01:31.590> be<00:01:31.800> a

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
do that but it wouldn't exactly be a

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.770 
do that but it wouldn't exactly be a
tamale<00:01:32.250> so<00:01:32.729> let's<00:01:33.150> do<00:01:33.300> it<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.479> right<00:01:33.510> way

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
tamale so let's do it the right way

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.780 
tamale so let's do it the right way
people<00:01:34.110> huh<00:01:34.260> okay<00:01:34.830> so<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:35.130> first<00:01:35.280> thing<00:01:35.490> we<00:01:35.610> do

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
people huh okay so the first thing we do

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.469 
people huh okay so the first thing we do
is<00:01:35.850> put<00:01:36.090> some<00:01:36.360> fat<00:01:37.200> in<00:01:37.409> here<00:01:37.620> I<00:01:37.650> am<00:01:38.040> using

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
is put some fat in here I am using

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:41.570 
is put some fat in here I am using
coconut<00:01:39.479> oil<00:01:39.720> you<00:01:40.680> could<00:01:40.799> use<00:01:40.860> lard<00:01:41.250> or

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:41.580 
coconut oil you could use lard or

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.090 
coconut oil you could use lard or
shortening<00:01:42.260> but<00:01:43.260> I<00:01:43.290> like<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.770> fact<00:01:43.979> that

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
shortening but I like the fact that

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.170 
shortening but I like the fact that
coconut<00:01:44.490> oil<00:01:44.729> has<00:01:45.510> no<00:01:46.430> animal<00:01:47.430> fat<00:01:47.670> so<00:01:48.000> this

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
coconut oil has no animal fat so this

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.930 
coconut oil has no animal fat so this
could<00:01:48.390> be<00:01:48.420> vegetarian<00:01:49.049> and<00:01:49.260> also<00:01:49.920> I<00:01:50.250> like<00:01:50.909> the

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:50.940 
could be vegetarian and also I like the

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.800 
could be vegetarian and also I like the
coconut<00:01:52.040> aroma<00:01:53.040> that<00:01:53.610> it<00:01:53.909> imparts<00:01:54.270> to<00:01:54.690> the

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
coconut aroma that it imparts to the

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.890 
coconut aroma that it imparts to the
tamales<00:01:55.820> call<00:01:56.820> me<00:01:57.000> and<00:01:57.150> traditional<00:01:57.600> okay<00:01:57.840> I'm

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:57.900 
tamales call me and traditional okay I'm

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.300 
tamales call me and traditional okay I'm
going<00:01:58.080> to<00:01:58.140> just<00:01:58.260> kind<00:01:58.619> of<00:01:58.650> get<00:01:58.799> that<00:01:58.830> fluffed

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
going to just kind of get that fluffed

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.719 
going to just kind of get that fluffed
up<00:01:59.460> a<00:01:59.610> little<00:01:59.760> bit

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
up a little bit

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:05.410 
up a little bit
and<00:02:02.270> then<00:02:03.259> I'm<00:02:03.380> going<00:02:03.530> to<00:02:03.560> add<00:02:04.090> massa

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
and then I'm going to add massa

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.559 
and then I'm going to add massa
so<00:02:05.539> it's<00:02:05.719> kind<00:02:06.469> of<00:02:06.619> looks<00:02:06.770> like<00:02:06.860> cornmeal<00:02:07.569> but

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:08.569 
so it's kind of looks like cornmeal but

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:18.190

these out you can kind of feel both
sides<00:04:24.210> and<00:04:24.630> they're<00:04:25.229> both<00:04:25.350> ridged<00:04:25.770> but<00:04:26.220> one

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
sides and they're both ridged but one

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.820 
sides and they're both ridged but one
side<00:04:26.639> is<00:04:26.820> definitely<00:04:27.560> smoother<00:04:28.560> than<00:04:28.710> the

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:28.830 
side is definitely smoother than the

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:30.529 
side is definitely smoother than the
other<00:04:28.979> when<00:04:29.220> you<00:04:29.250> run<00:04:29.520> it<00:04:29.639> when<00:04:30.090> your<00:04:30.210> fingers

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:32.639 
up vertically like this you want to put

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:34.879 
up vertically like this you want to put
the<00:04:32.729> smooth<00:04:33.060> side<00:04:33.419> up<00:04:33.690> and<00:04:34.530> you<00:04:34.620> have<00:04:34.710> to<00:04:34.740> put

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:34.889 
the smooth side up and you have to put

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:38.360 
the smooth side up and you have to put
the<00:04:34.979> smaller<00:04:35.310> end<00:04:35.580> facing<00:04:36.150> you<00:04:36.270> and<00:04:36.740> then<00:04:37.740> just

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
the smaller end facing you and then just

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:42.740 
the smaller end facing you and then just
get<00:04:38.610> a<00:04:39.949> very<00:04:40.949> small<00:04:41.280> amount<00:04:41.430> of<00:04:41.789> masa<00:04:42.060> like

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750 
get a very small amount of masa like

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:46.490 
get a very small amount of masa like
maybe<00:04:43.139> a<00:04:43.410> couple<00:04:43.860> tablespoons<00:04:45.259> and<00:04:46.259> I'm

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 
maybe a couple tablespoons and I'm

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.390 
maybe a couple tablespoons and I'm
actually<00:04:46.650> going<00:04:46.949> to<00:04:47.009> can<00:04:47.550> I<00:04:47.580> use<00:04:47.789> a<00:04:47.820> knife<00:04:48.120> to

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:49.400 
actually going to can I use a knife to

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:56.210 
actually going to can I use a knife to
spread<00:04:50.400> it<00:04:50.639> out<00:04:50.759> a<00:04:50.820> little<00:04:51.000> bit<00:04:54.860> and<00:04:55.860> it<00:04:55.979> seems

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.220 
spread it out a little bit and it seems

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:57.800 
spread it out a little bit and it seems
like<00:04:56.370> it's<00:04:56.520> not<00:04:56.669> very<00:04:56.849> much<00:04:57.030> but<00:04:57.389> the<00:04:57.599> masa

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:57.810 
like it's not very much but the masa

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:02.240 
like it's not very much but the masa
kind<00:04:58.229> of<00:04:58.320> swells<00:04:58.919> as<00:04:59.220> it<00:04:59.340> cooks<00:04:59.580> so<00:05:01.130> it'll<00:05:02.130> be

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:02.250 
kind of swells as it cooks so it'll be

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:07.850 
kind of swells as it cooks so it'll be
enough<00:05:02.520> at<00:05:02.820> the<00:05:03.509> end<00:05:04.160> okay<00:05:05.900> that's<00:05:06.900> all<00:05:07.259> spread

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:07.860 
enough at the end okay that's all spread

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:10.850 
enough at the end okay that's all spread
it<00:05:08.009> out<00:05:08.130> okay<00:05:08.610> now<00:05:08.759> get<00:05:09.060> like<00:05:09.380> maybe<00:05:10.380> just<00:05:10.560> a

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:10.860 
it out okay now get like maybe just a

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:12.710 
it out okay now get like maybe just a
couple<00:05:11.009> tablespoons<00:05:11.400> of<00:05:12.000> this<00:05:12.210> and<00:05:12.479> this<00:05:12.539> has

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:12.720

been cooked and cooled off to kind of

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:18.129 
been cooked and cooled off to kind of
lay<00:05:16.320> it<00:05:16.440> right<00:05:16.470> in<00:05:16.680> the<00:05:16.889> middle<00:05:17.010> there<00:05:17.370> and
