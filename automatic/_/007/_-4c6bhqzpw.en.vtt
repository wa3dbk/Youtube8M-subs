00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.930 
one two I go over to diamonds on the
ball<00:02:09.960> so<00:02:10.289> I'm<00:02:11.160> always<00:02:11.340> starting<00:02:11.790> in<00:02:11.880> the

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
ball so I'm always starting in the

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:25.930 
ball so I'm always starting in the
center<00:02:12.150> then<00:02:12.480> I<00:02:12.540> go<00:02:12.720> over<00:02:12.840> 1<00:02:13.110> 2<00:02:19.640> there's<00:02:20.640> $2<00:02:24.110> I

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
center then I go over 1 2 there's $2 I

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.310 
center then I go over 1 2 there's $2 I
can<00:02:26.940> do<00:02:27.060> that<00:02:27.240> everywhere<00:02:27.720> ok<00:02:28.290> if<00:02:28.950> I<00:02:29.459> want<00:02:29.760> to

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:30.320 
can do that everywhere ok if I want to

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:34.900 
can do that everywhere ok if I want to
subtract<00:02:31.320> the<00:02:31.590> English<00:02:31.980> I<00:02:32.250> would<00:02:32.820> go<00:02:32.970> high<00:02:33.739> so

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
subtract the English I would go high so

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.699 
subtract the English I would go high so
when<00:02:35.910> you<00:02:36.000> go<00:02:36.150> high<00:02:36.390> it<00:02:36.450> always<00:02:36.750> subtract<00:02:37.320> half

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
when you go high it always subtract half

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:44.890 
when you go high it always subtract half
of<00:02:38.150> one<00:02:39.150> diamond<00:02:39.390> so<00:02:41.900> if<00:02:42.900> I<00:02:43.080> want<00:02:43.320> to<00:02:43.380> go<00:02:43.530> to

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
of one diamond so if I want to go to

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:52.540 
of one diamond so if I want to go to
half<00:02:45.900> of<00:02:46.050> the<00:02:46.170> diamond<00:02:46.350> I<00:02:48.530> go<00:02:49.530> over<00:02:49.739> 1<00:02:50.030> and<00:02:51.030> up<00:02:51.270> 1

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550 
half of the diamond I go over 1 and up 1

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:59.000 
half of the diamond I go over 1 and up 1
that<00:02:53.550> gives<00:02:53.790> me<00:02:53.940> 1/2<00:02:54.120> we're<00:02:54.390> done<00:02:56.660> good<00:02:57.660> I<00:02:58.010> want

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
that gives me 1/2 we're done good I want

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:05.979 
that gives me 1/2 we're done good I want
to<00:02:59.100> go<00:02:59.280> over<00:02:59.520> one<00:03:00.360> and<00:03:00.510> a<00:03:00.570> half<00:03:03.920> going<00:03:04.920> over<00:03:05.370> two

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:05.989 
to go over one and a half going over two

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:15.949 
to go over one and a half going over two
diamonds<00:03:06.989> and<00:03:07.470> I'm<00:03:07.590> going<00:03:07.769> to<00:03:07.799> subtract<00:03:08.220> 1/2

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:20.940 

Lowe<00:03:16.959> adds<00:03:17.440> a<00:03:18.190> hat<00:03:19.170> so<00:03:20.170> if<00:03:20.319> I<00:03:20.440> want<00:03:20.620> to<00:03:20.650> go<00:03:20.799> over

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
Lowe adds a hat so if I want to go over

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.199 
Lowe adds a hat so if I want to go over
one<00:03:21.190> and<00:03:21.310> a<00:03:21.400> half<00:03:23.040> I'm<00:03:24.040> going<00:03:24.220> to<00:03:24.280> go<00:03:24.400> down<00:03:24.760> I'm

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:25.209 
one and a half I'm going to go down I'm

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:29.869 
one and a half I'm going to go down I'm
down<00:03:25.269> here<00:03:26.190> and<00:03:27.190> I'm<00:03:27.400> going<00:03:27.519> to<00:03:27.610> go<00:03:27.700> over<00:03:28.049> one

00:03:29.869 --> 00:03:29.879 
down here and I'm going to go over one

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:34.080 
down here and I'm going to go over one
because<00:03:30.879> I'm<00:03:31.060> low<00:03:31.299> it's<00:03:31.690> adding<00:03:32.049> a<00:03:32.110> half<00:03:32.790> or<00:03:33.790> if

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
because I'm low it's adding a half or if

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.030 
because I'm low it's adding a half or if
I'm<00:03:34.209> up<00:03:34.420> here<00:03:34.599> I've<00:03:34.780> over<00:03:35.080> one<00:03:35.260> that's<00:03:35.530> one<00:03:35.769> I

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
I'm up here I've over one that's one I

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:43.410 
I'm up here I've over one that's one I
want<00:03:36.849> to<00:03:36.910> add<00:03:36.940> a<00:03:37.060> hat<00:03:37.299> I<00:03:37.510> go<00:03:37.660> down<00:03:37.840> one<00:03:42.420> just

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420 
want to add a hat I go down one just

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:46.890 
want to add a hat I go down one just
like<00:03:43.569> that<00:03:44.310> yeah<00:03:45.310> when<00:03:46.269> you<00:03:46.390> that's<00:03:46.690> when

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
like that yeah when you that's when

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.180 
like that yeah when you that's when
you're<00:03:47.049> doing<00:03:47.260> the<00:03:47.470> short<00:03:47.650> side<00:03:47.890> of<00:03:47.920> the<00:03:48.010> table

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
you're doing the short side of the table

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.819 
you're doing the short side of the table
if<00:03:48.400> you're<00:03:48.489> going<00:03:48.640> along<00:03:48.970> side<00:03:49.360> I'm<00:03:49.829> traveling

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:50.829 
if you're going along side I'm traveling

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:52.979 
if you're going along side I'm traveling
twice<00:03:51.160> the<00:03:51.430> distance<00:03:51.579> so<00:03:52.510> everything<00:03:52.870> would

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:52.989 
twice the distance so everything would

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:55.559 
twice the distance so everything would
be<00:03:53.109> cut<00:03:53.290> in<00:03:53.410> half<00:03:53.440> again<00:03:54.269> okay

00:03:55.559 --> 00:03:55.569 
be cut in half again okay

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:59.369 
be cut in half again okay
so<00:03:56.319> if<00:03:57.129> I<00:03:57.370> want<00:03:57.730> to<00:03:57.940> go<00:03:58.090> over<00:03:58.390> two<00:03:58.750> diamonds<00:03:59.170> and

00:03:59.369 --> 00:03:59.379 
so if I want to go over two diamonds and

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:00.270 
so if I want to go over two diamonds and
make<00:03:59.530> it<00:03:59.650> in<00:03:59.769> a<00:03:59.829> pocket

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
make it in a pocket

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.699 
make it in a pocket
one<00:04:00.970> two<00:04:01.510> I'm<00:04:02.260> hanging<00:04:02.530> the<00:04:02.650> center<00:04:02.980> diamond

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
one two I'm hanging the center diamond

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:07.530 
one two I'm hanging the center diamond
because<00:04:05.709> I'm<00:04:05.859> using<00:04:06.129> the<00:04:06.370> long<00:04:06.609> ways<00:04:06.879> it's

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
because I'm using the long ways it's

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.930 
because I'm using the long ways it's
half<00:04:07.840> so<00:04:08.829> when<00:04:08.950> I<00:04:08.980> was<00:04:09.129> going<00:04:09.280> this<00:04:09.489> way<00:04:09.670> I<00:04:09.700> was

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:09.940 
half so when I was going this way I was

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:11.250 
half so when I was going this way I was
going<00:04:10.120> over<00:04:10.209> two<00:04:10.450> diamonds<00:04:10.840> because<00:04:11.019> I<00:04:11.079> went

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:11.260 
going over two diamonds because I went

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:12.809 
going over two diamonds because I went
over<00:04:11.410> a<00:04:11.440> few<00:04:11.560> items<00:04:11.709> now<00:04:12.310> that<00:04:12.459> I'm<00:04:12.549> going<00:04:12.790> to

00:04:12.809 --> 00:04:12.819 
over a few items now that I'm going to

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:14.819 
over a few items now that I'm going to
long<00:04:13.060> ways<00:04:13.269> I'm<00:04:13.810> only<00:04:14.049> going<00:04:14.230> to<00:04:14.290> go<00:04:14.379> over<00:04:14.530> one

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:14.829 
long ways I'm only going to go over one

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:16.770 
long ways I'm only going to go over one
diamond<00:04:15.069> there's<00:04:15.940> one<00:04:16.090> diamond<00:04:16.299> this<00:04:16.600> way

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780 
diamond there's one diamond this way

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:23.760 
diamond there's one diamond this way
equals<00:04:17.620> to<00:04:18.010> it<00:04:18.190> descent<00:04:18.579> okay<00:04:22.500> so<00:04:23.500> I'll<00:04:23.620> write

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:23.770 
equals to it descent okay so I'll write

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:31.180 
equals to it descent okay so I'll write
the<00:04:23.860> center<00:04:24.190> then<00:04:24.669> go<00:04:24.849> over<00:04:24.910> one<00:04:25.389> day

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:31.190 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:33.980 

so<00:04:32.190> one<00:04:32.550> dime<00:04:32.730> going<00:04:32.940> over<00:04:33.120> probably<00:04:33.360> chew

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:33.990 
so one dime going over probably chew

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.130 
so one dime going over probably chew
over<00:04:34.200> when<00:04:34.560> I<00:04:34.590> just<00:04:34.800> want<00:04:34.950> long<00:04:35.160> legs

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:36.140 
over when I just want long legs

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:38.450 
over when I just want long legs
so<00:04:37.140> just<00:04:37.470> remember<00:04:37.620> if<00:04:37.950> you're<00:04:38.100> doing<00:04:38.370> the

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460 
so just remember if you're doing the

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:41.510 
so just remember if you're doing the
short<00:04:38.730> side<00:04:38.940> of<00:04:39.090> the<00:04:39.150> table<00:04:40.040> it's<00:04:41.040> exactly

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 
short side of the table it's exactly

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.100 
short side of the table it's exactly
what<00:04:41.790> it<00:04:41.910> is<00:04:42.030> if<00:04:42.300> you're<00:04:42.420> going<00:04:42.570> one<00:04:42.780> Diamond

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110 
what it is if you're going one Diamond

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:44.720 
what it is if you're going one Diamond
over<00:04:43.350> it's<00:04:43.500> going<00:04:43.650> to<00:04:43.740> go<00:04:43.860> one<00:04:44.160> diamond<00:04:44.400> over

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:44.730 
over it's going to go one diamond over

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:46.610 
over it's going to go one diamond over
on<00:04:44.850> the<00:04:44.970> rail<00:04:45.150> if<00:04:45.360> you're<00:04:45.810> using<00:04:45.990> the<00:04:46.290> long

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 
on the rail if you're using the long

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.610 
on the rail if you're using the long
side<00:04:47.550> of<00:04:47.580> the<00:04:47.760> pool<00:04:47.910> table<00:04:48.330> if<00:04:48.900> you<00:04:49.110> go<00:04:49.290> to<00:04:49.350> one

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620 
side of the pool table if you go to one

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:51.770 
side of the pool table if you go to one
Diamond<00:04:49.980> over<00:04:50.190> it's<00:04:50.430> going<00:04:50.640> over<00:04:50.910> to<00:04:51.390> diamonds

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:51.780 
Diamond over it's going over to diamonds

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:53.900
