unhook your water supply line that's all

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.620 
unhook your water supply line that's all
under<00:01:23.040> your<00:01:23.340> sink<00:01:23.580> obviously<00:01:24.119> and<00:01:24.240> it<00:01:24.299> has<00:01:24.479> to

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
under your sink obviously and it has to

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.630 
under your sink obviously and it has to
be<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.840> cold<00:01:25.170> water<00:01:25.560> supply<00:01:25.860> line<00:01:26.340> obviously

be the cold water supply line obviously

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.690 
be the cold water supply line obviously
and<00:01:27.479> then<00:01:28.380> what<00:01:28.829> you're<00:01:28.979> going<00:01:29.250> to<00:01:29.280> do<00:01:29.579> is

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
and then what you're going to do is

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.950 
and then what you're going to do is
in<00:01:30.850> your<00:01:31.330> kit<00:01:31.950> comes<00:01:32.950> actually<00:01:33.960> instructions

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:34.960 
in your kit comes actually instructions

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.660 
in your kit comes actually instructions
and<00:01:35.259> a<00:01:35.320> chart<00:01:35.619> and<00:01:35.830> everything<00:01:37.619> but<00:01:38.619> comes<00:01:39.130> you

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:39.670 
and a chart and everything but comes you

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:41.600 
and a chart and everything but comes you
know<00:01:39.790> your<00:01:39.970> different<00:01:40.330> parts<00:01:40.750> that<00:01:40.840> you<00:01:41.140> need

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
know your different parts that you need

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.899 
know your different parts that you need
now<00:01:43.350> you've<00:01:44.350> disconnected<00:01:44.770> the<00:01:45.220> supply<00:01:45.610> line

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:45.909 
now you've disconnected the supply line

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:47.760 
now you've disconnected the supply line
from<00:01:46.180> here<00:01:46.540> and<00:01:46.780> what<00:01:46.960> you're<00:01:47.110> going<00:01:47.320> to<00:01:47.560> do

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
from here and what you're going to do

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.740 
from here and what you're going to do
then<00:01:48.039> is<00:01:48.450> connect<00:01:49.740> this<00:01:51.149> kind<00:01:52.149> of<00:01:52.210> a<00:01:52.299> diverter

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
then is connect this kind of a diverter

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.639 
then is connect this kind of a diverter
on<00:01:53.500> to<00:01:54.100> that<00:01:54.280> spot<00:01:54.930> and<00:01:55.930> you<00:01:56.110> just<00:01:56.320> kind<00:01:56.590> of

00:01:56.639 --> 00:01:56.649 
on to that spot and you just kind of

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:06.990 
on to that spot and you just kind of
screw<00:01:56.950> it<00:01:57.039> on<00:01:59.039> and<00:02:01.800> I<00:02:04.229> mean<00:02:05.250> I'm<00:02:06.250> thinking<00:02:06.580> that

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
screw it on and I mean I'm thinking that

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.930 
screw it on and I mean I'm thinking that
you<00:02:07.119> might<00:02:08.080> not<00:02:08.380> need<00:02:08.619> to<00:02:08.679> use<00:02:09.009> pliers<00:02:09.340> or<00:02:09.789> you

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
you might not need to use pliers or you

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.559 
you might not need to use pliers or you
might<00:02:10.179> just<00:02:10.479> depending<00:02:11.260> on<00:02:11.350> once<00:02:11.950> you<00:02:12.100> do<00:02:12.569> test

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
might just depending on once you do test

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:16.470 
might just depending on once you do test
the<00:02:14.230> water<00:02:14.470> and<00:02:15.280> if<00:02:15.819> there's<00:02:16.120> a<00:02:16.209> leak

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
the water and if there's a leak

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.320 
the water and if there's a leak
obviously<00:02:17.110> you<00:02:17.200> need<00:02:17.319> to<00:02:17.380> tighten<00:02:17.799> it<00:02:17.920> more<00:02:18.330> so

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
obviously you need to tighten it more so

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.830 
obviously you need to tighten it more so
then<00:02:20.140> you<00:02:20.380> screw<00:02:20.739> this<00:02:20.920> on<00:02:21.220> and<00:02:22.090> it's<00:02:22.540> just<00:02:22.630> a

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
then you screw this on and it's just a

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.600 
then you screw this on and it's just a
little<00:02:23.080> tricky<00:02:23.500> getting<00:02:23.530> it<00:02:23.890> started<00:02:24.400> but

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
little tricky getting it started but

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.820 
little tricky getting it started but
once<00:02:25.000> you've<00:02:25.150> got<00:02:25.360> it<00:02:25.390> started<00:02:25.989> get<00:02:26.560> it<00:02:26.680> on

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
once you've got it started get it on

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:27.270 
once you've got it started get it on
there

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
there

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.280 
there
and<00:02:27.610> so<00:02:28.209> now<00:02:28.950> you<00:02:29.950> were<00:02:30.130> water<00:02:30.970> then<00:02:31.360> this

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
and so now you were water then this

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.360 
and so now you were water then this

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:46.550 
just push it in and then just kind of

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:48.160 
just push it in and then just kind of
pull<00:03:46.850> to<00:03:47.060> make<00:03:47.090> sure<00:03:47.420> it<00:03:47.510> doesn't<00:03:47.690> pull<00:03:48.020> right

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.170 
pull to make sure it doesn't pull right

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:50.850 
pull to make sure it doesn't pull right
out<00:03:48.230> but<00:03:49.040> that's<00:03:49.250> all<00:03:49.430> it's<00:03:49.820> just<00:03:50.090> in<00:03:50.240> an

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:13.940 
you can see this there's a little blue

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:16.479 
you can see this there's a little blue
label<00:04:14.300> on<00:04:14.690> the<00:04:14.810> back<00:04:14.960> your<00:04:15.680> water<00:04:15.920> ionizer<00:04:16.340> and

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:16.489 
label on the back your water ionizer and

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:20.260 
label on the back your water ionizer and
has<00:04:16.790> an<00:04:16.940> arrow<00:04:17.239> that<00:04:18.170> says<00:04:18.230> tap<00:04:18.950> water<00:04:19.310> inlet

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:20.270 
has an arrow that says tap water inlet

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:22.660 
has an arrow that says tap water inlet
so<00:04:20.959> that<00:04:21.230> you're<00:04:21.470> gonna<00:04:21.620> follow<00:04:22.040> the<00:04:22.490> arrow

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:22.670 
so that you're gonna follow the arrow

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:32.320 
so that you're gonna follow the arrow
down<00:04:27.490> and<00:04:28.600> you<00:04:29.600> know<00:04:29.720> find<00:04:30.170> that<00:04:31.330> connection

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330 
down and you know find that connection

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:36.750 
down and you know find that connection
right<00:04:33.170> there<00:04:33.230> and<00:04:34.270> push<00:04:35.270> that<00:04:35.660> black<00:04:36.200> hose

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:36.760 
right there and push that black hose

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:44.290 
right there and push that black hose
right<00:04:37.760> on<00:04:38.060> in<00:04:38.740> like<00:04:39.740> that<00:04:41.230> then<00:04:42.670> you've<00:04:43.670> got<00:04:44.030> a

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:44.300 
right on in like that then you've got a

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:49.480 
right on in like that then you've got a
red<00:04:44.690> hose<00:04:45.080> here<00:04:45.830> that<00:04:46.330> red<00:04:47.330> for<00:04:47.660> acid<00:04:48.170> and<00:04:48.490> that

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:49.490 
red hose here that red for acid and that

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:55.330 
red hose here that red for acid and that
gets<00:04:50.300> hooked<00:04:50.630> to<00:04:51.350> this<00:04:52.310> other<00:04:53.860> line<00:04:54.860> here<00:04:55.160> but

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:55.340 
gets hooked to this other line here but

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:58.780 
gets hooked to this other line here but
now<00:04:55.640> this<00:04:55.940> has<00:04:56.270> to<00:04:56.450> have<00:04:56.660> a<00:04:56.900> special<00:04:57.790> connector

00:04:58.780 --> 00:04:58.790 
now this has to have a special connector

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:03.090 
now this has to have a special connector
so<00:04:59.740> that's<00:05:00.740> this<00:05:01.400> piece<00:05:02.360> right<00:05:02.570> here<00:05:02.630> and

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:03.100 
so that's this piece right here and

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:07.090 
so that's this piece right here and
we'll<00:05:04.100> push<00:05:04.460> one<00:05:05.000> side<00:05:05.360> on<00:05:05.690> like<00:05:06.410> that<00:05:06.710> and

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:07.100 
we'll push one side on like that and

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:13.560 
we'll push one side on like that and
then<00:05:07.820> push<00:05:08.210> the<00:05:08.630> red<00:05:09.290> hose<00:05:09.620> in<00:05:11.200> and<00:05:12.200> we're<00:05:12.710> done

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:13.570 
then push the red hose in and we're done

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:18.090 
then push the red hose in and we're done
make<00:05:14.570> sure<00:05:14.600> it<00:05:15.020> doesn't<00:05:15.320> pull<00:05:15.740> right<00:05:15.890> out<00:05:16.720> and

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:18.100 
make sure it doesn't pull right out and

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:23.800 
make sure it doesn't pull right out and
the<00:05:19.100> last<00:05:19.490> thing<00:05:20.050> all<00:05:21.050> right<00:05:22.000> Travis<00:05:23.000> set<00:05:23.630> this

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:23.810 
the last thing all right Travis set this

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:27.310 
the last thing all right Travis set this
straight<00:05:24.200> up<00:05:24.260> the<00:05:25.250> last<00:05:25.490> hose<00:05:26.030> and<00:05:26.900> you<00:05:27.200> know

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:27.320

showing him where the hoses go but

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:44.380 
showing him where the hoses go but
you'll<00:05:42.860> need<00:05:43.040> a<00:05:43.100> helper<00:05:43.730> and<00:05:43.970> you'll<00:05:44.150> need<00:05:44.330> to

actually<00:05:45.260> figure<00:05:46.040> this<00:05:46.070> out<00:05:46.460> how<00:05:46.790> this<00:05:47.030> can<00:05:47.300> be

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:47.450 
actually figure this out how this can be

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:50.080 
actually figure this out how this can be
positioned<00:05:48.140> down<00:05:48.320> under<00:05:48.710> your<00:05:48.860> sink<00:05:49.250> you'll

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:52.640 
probably want the melody itself to be

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:56.380 
probably want the melody itself to be
pretty<00:05:53.210> close<00:05:53.570> to<00:05:53.870> your<00:05:54.110> cabinet<00:05:55.070> door<00:05:55.460> so

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:00.650 
setting to acidic water or something

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:02.110

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:09.500 
now this will will hook into this but we

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:13.180 
now this will will hook into this but we
need<00:06:09.710> another<00:06:10.100> like<00:06:11.050> connector<00:06:12.050> piece<00:06:12.380> that

need another like connector piece that
screws<00:06:13.760> in<00:06:14.150> and<00:06:14.630> then<00:06:15.460> once<00:06:16.460> that's<00:06:16.700> through

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:17.090 
screws in and then once that's through

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:19.180 
screws in and then once that's through
it<00:06:17.150> in<00:06:17.270> tight<00:06:17.630> then<00:06:18.020> you<00:06:18.170> will<00:06:18.320> just<00:06:18.560> push<00:06:18.890> this

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:19.190
