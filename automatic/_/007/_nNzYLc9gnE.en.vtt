your<00:00:26.310> laptop<00:00:27.050> microsoft<00:00:28.050> said<00:00:28.380> this<00:00:28.529> is<00:00:28.680> three

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
your laptop microsoft said this is three

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.769 
your laptop microsoft said this is three
years<00:00:29.220> in<00:00:29.429> the<00:00:29.490> making<00:00:29.699> so<00:00:30.210> i<00:00:30.240> guess<00:00:30.480> we<00:00:30.660> can

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
years in the making so i guess we can

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.190 
years in the making so i guess we can
consider<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.439> other<00:00:31.590> two<00:00:31.980> public<00:00:32.640> betas

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:33.200 
consider the other two public betas

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.200 
consider the other two public betas
we're<00:00:34.200> going<00:00:34.350> to<00:00:34.410> get<00:00:34.559> into<00:00:34.860> exactly<00:00:35.460> where<00:00:36.000> it

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
we're going to get into exactly where it

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.440 
we're going to get into exactly where it
meets<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.660> actual<00:00:37.410> needs<00:00:38.190> of<00:00:38.430> replacing<00:00:38.910> your

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
meets the actual needs of replacing your

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.020 
meets the actual needs of replacing your
laptop<00:00:39.930> and<00:00:39.960> where<00:00:40.379> it<00:00:40.500> falls<00:00:40.770> short<00:00:40.890> in<00:00:41.309> doing

laptop and where it falls short in doing
so<00:00:43.489> the<00:00:44.489> beauty<00:00:44.820> of<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:45.030> surface<00:00:45.440> pro<00:00:46.440> 3<00:00:46.469> is

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860

very<00:01:35.430> great<00:01:36.060> is<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:37.049> kickstand<00:01:37.500> now<00:01:38.360> previous

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
very great is the kickstand now previous

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.780 
very great is the kickstand now previous
kickstands<00:01:39.840> were<00:01:40.290> just<00:01:40.650> you<00:01:41.159> know<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.549> first

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
kickstands were just you know the first

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.429 
kickstands were just you know the first
one<00:01:41.970> just<00:01:42.000> had<00:01:42.329> to<00:01:42.630> just<00:01:42.840> kick<00:01:43.049> stand<00:01:43.229> in<00:01:43.409> one

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
one just had to just kick stand in one

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.870 
one just had to just kick stand in one
mode<00:01:43.799> and<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:45.829> second<00:01:46.829> one<00:01:46.950> it<00:01:47.130> had<00:01:47.430> like<00:01:47.610> two

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
mode and the second one it had like two

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.870 
mode and the second one it had like two
positions<00:01:48.479> this<00:01:49.439> one<00:01:49.649> uses<00:01:49.860> friction<00:01:50.220> to<00:01:50.670> hold

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
positions this one uses friction to hold

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.810 
positions this one uses friction to hold
in<00:01:51.060> place<00:01:51.299> so<00:01:51.570> you<00:01:51.600> can<00:01:51.930> go<00:01:52.140> as<00:01:52.439> low<00:01:52.860> and<00:01:53.340> as<00:01:53.460> far

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
in place so you can go as low and as far

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.740 
in place so you can go as low and as far
as<00:01:53.880> you<00:01:54.450> possibly<00:01:54.479> can<00:01:55.259> and<00:01:56.000> it'll<00:01:57.000> hold<00:01:57.210> no

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
as you possibly can and it'll hold no

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.740 
as you possibly can and it'll hold no
problem<00:01:58.170> so<00:01:59.009> definitely<00:01:59.490> kudos<00:01:59.880> to<00:02:00.210> Microsoft

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750

at<00:02:19.950> the<00:02:20.040> moment<00:02:20.990> this<00:02:21.990> isn't<00:02:22.260> just<00:02:22.410> a<00:02:22.470> regular

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
at the moment this isn't just a regular

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.070 
at the moment this isn't just a regular
HD<00:02:23.040> display<00:02:23.340> it's<00:02:23.520> actually<00:02:23.760> a<00:02:23.790> 2k<00:02:24.270> display<00:02:24.450> so

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
HD display it's actually a 2k display so

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:31.520 
HD display it's actually a 2k display so
it's<00:02:26.990> resolutions<00:02:27.990> at<00:02:28.200> 21<00:02:28.680> 40<00:02:29.190> x<00:02:29.310> 1440<00:02:30.210> so<00:02:30.840> this

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
it's resolutions at 21 40 x 1440 so this

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.370 
it's resolutions at 21 40 x 1440 so this
is<00:02:31.680> definitely<00:02:31.980> ranging<00:02:32.700> around<00:02:33.180> the<00:02:33.630> ipad

00:06:09.099 --> 00:06:11.129 
buying like for thirteen hundred dollars
keyboard<00:06:09.520> should<00:06:09.759> be<00:06:09.849> included<00:06:10.330> you<00:06:10.750> know<00:06:10.870> or

00:06:11.129 --> 00:06:11.139 
keyboard should be included you know or

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:13.200

so<00:06:13.930> I<00:06:14.259> give<00:06:14.470> it<00:06:14.590> an<00:06:14.680> a<00:06:14.800> minus<00:06:15.120> other<00:06:16.120> than<00:06:16.210> that

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:16.300 
so I give it an a minus other than that

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:17.969 
so I give it an a minus other than that
as<00:06:16.479> the<00:06:16.570> solid<00:06:16.900> ice<00:06:17.110> is<00:06:17.349> pretty<00:06:17.560> much<00:06:17.650> be<00:06:17.860> my
