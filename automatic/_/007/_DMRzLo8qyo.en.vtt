it's<00:02:25.310> not<00:02:25.490> being<00:02:25.670> used<00:02:25.790> it'll<00:02:26.240> be<00:02:26.330> turned<00:02:26.540> off

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
it's not being used it'll be turned off

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.260 
it's not being used it'll be turned off
so<00:02:26.930> here<00:02:27.620> we<00:02:27.740> have<00:02:27.950> a<00:02:28.190> basic<00:02:28.670> network<00:02:29.000> setup

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270 
so here we have a basic network setup

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:31.630 
so here we have a basic network setup
here<00:02:29.600> I<00:02:29.630> said<00:02:29.900> it<00:02:30.020> before<00:02:30.430> broadcast<00:02:31.430> name

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
here I said it before broadcast name

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.180 
here I said it before broadcast name
tech<00:02:31.940> central<00:02:32.390> password<00:02:32.900> tech<00:02:33.500> central<00:02:33.980> and

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
tech central password tech central and

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.790 
tech central password tech central and
guest<00:02:34.940> connected<00:02:35.360> zero<00:02:35.690> so<00:02:36.470> now<00:02:36.560> if<00:02:36.680> you

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
guest connected zero so now if you

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.370 
guest connected zero so now if you
wanted<00:02:37.010> to<00:02:37.100> customize<00:02:37.280> that<00:02:38.320> obviously<00:02:39.320> it

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
wanted to customize that obviously it

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:40.300 
wanted to customize that obviously it
would<00:02:39.470> be<00:02:39.560> different<00:02:39.770> if<00:02:40.010> you're<00:02:40.100> just

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
would be different if you're just

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.220 
would be different if you're just

you could change your broadcasting the

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.480 
you could change your broadcasting the
SSID<00:02:45.380> and<00:02:45.830> the<00:02:46.670> authentication<00:02:48.070> it's<00:02:49.070> good<00:02:49.340> to

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:49.490 
SSID and the authentication it's good to

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:51.580 
SSID and the authentication it's good to

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
have a password on it because someone

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.910 
have a password on it because someone
could<00:02:51.920> come<00:02:52.130> in<00:02:52.300> take<00:02:53.300> your<00:02:53.740> data<00:02:54.740> connection

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750
