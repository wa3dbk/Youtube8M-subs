look<00:01:50.939> at<00:01:51.180> your<00:01:51.329> rig<00:01:51.509> measure<00:01:51.810> it<00:01:52.049> up<00:01:52.170> make<00:01:52.890> sure

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
look at your rig measure it up make sure

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.719 
look at your rig measure it up make sure
that<00:01:53.520> that<00:01:53.729> rig<00:01:54.030> is<00:01:54.360> of<00:01:54.600> legal<00:01:55.470> dimension<00:01:55.979> so
