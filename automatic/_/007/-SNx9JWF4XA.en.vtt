good amount of time so you can you know

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.890 
good amount of time so you can you know
your<00:03:12.910> body<00:03:13.090> can<00:03:13.269> get<00:03:13.359> used<00:03:13.569> to<00:03:13.690> it<00:03:13.780> you're

your body can get used to it you're

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.569 
your body can get used to it you're
stabilized<00:03:14.319> think<00:03:14.590> the<00:03:14.650> stabilizers<00:03:15.280> can<00:03:15.459> get

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:15.579 
stabilized think the stabilizers can get

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:17.250 
stabilized think the stabilizers can get
used<00:03:15.760> to<00:03:15.880> it<00:03:15.970> and<00:03:16.090> you<00:03:16.540> can<00:03:16.720> track<00:03:17.079> your

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
used to it and you can track your

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:18.330 
used to it and you can track your
progress<00:03:17.440> guys<00:03:17.829> you<00:03:18.010> won't<00:03:18.100> have<00:03:18.250> a

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
progress guys you won't have a

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.310 
progress guys you won't have a
quantifiable<00:03:19.150> you<00:03:19.570> know<00:03:19.690> measurement<00:03:20.199> of

your

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:22.080 
your
increases<00:03:21.280> you<00:03:21.489> keep<00:03:21.640> changing<00:03:21.819> by<00:03:22.030> the

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
increases you keep changing by the

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:23.729 
increases you keep changing by the
exercises<00:03:22.569> you'll<00:03:22.719> never<00:03:22.930> know<00:03:23.140> if<00:03:23.409> you're

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
progressing you'll just be getting

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.360 
progressing you'll just be getting
marginally<00:03:26.019> stronger<00:03:26.409> because<00:03:26.590> your<00:03:26.890> overall
