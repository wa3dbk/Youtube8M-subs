00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.520
 laboratory which does some 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.770
 nuclear experiences and experience with 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.800
 animals that when we play the 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.960
 campaign ends up having a small screen in a 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.879
 the stage you play there you will have 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.800
 to stop this pipeline then I like you 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.760
 Can you see I was waiting for the crew? 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.189
 Are you going to do the same procedure? 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.360
 default will call a service 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.460
 complement the cell phone 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.250
 this service is called the service goes 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:14.460
 getting into the service will wait to get down there 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:17.070
 aa list upright service 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.979
 right and therefore you 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:23.070

 and on your xbox 360 and magically you 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.250
 will be inside the laboratory galera 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.890
 this lab is very crazy because it is 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.820
 very great very very very very 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.009

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.650
 Do you have any idea for you to explore it? 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:43.320
 I studied a little more than half of him. 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.210

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.700

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.170
 some research to itown and it is 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:12.330
 crazy 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:15.120
 It really is not worth it. 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.890
 sorry we bumped into the microphone 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.330
 this noise is not worth much 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.250
 You're entering here, but you have to 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:24.360
 enter the gallery while displaying with the 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:27.209

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:33.750
 break and if he does not break the glass to 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:37.319
 bullet proof elbowing bulletins 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:39.090
 logically then we go there for you 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:40.319
 I'm going to give a pause to the video I'm going to 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.600
 show you 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:47.010

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:48.390
 to get to the laboratory of the main street 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.720
 good guys this is the location 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:53.370
 right where I'm right then 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.650
 you will come here if you buy 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.269
 will place the heliport of trevor a 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.670
 a little bit more to the right totally 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:01.590
 right here is right here at this point. 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.269
 interest is a day that I am I think 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.010
 which already gives to you are located if I 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:07.530
 get there and let's go back there pro 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.930
 video so people here have some 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:12.120
 cages if you are going to play a mission already 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.609
 sending a spoiler the guys will have 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:17.010
 some monkeys some animals around these 

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:20.370
 cages that serves this purpose 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:22.440
 store the guinea pigs there and there 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.180
 You're seeing me lighting you there. 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.670
 but kind have nothing at this point 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.290
 because it is an area that is not used in the 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.450
 online unlikely 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.670
 so here you come in 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.680
 corridors and more and more 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:36.480
 Come in and you will see that you have 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.519
 a lot to be explored you can 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.109
 to see that the map is very long is very 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:42.720
 big is too big 

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:45.829
 So I think it's up to you to bring the 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:49.530
 everybody is your friends and the 

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:52.680
 krill partners are still not for you 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:54.569
 can actually run exploited this 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:57.209
 here cool because sometimes spend 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:59.519
 eye from one to the eye of a person passes 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:01.799
 unnoticed but the other will not pass 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:04.500
 so it's going to be really cool, well rewarding 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:06.690
 You come here and enjoy this moment. 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:09.690

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:12.150
 and experiences is where they use 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:13.500
 radiation to be able to make some 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.660
 animal experiments 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:17.400
 This part can not go, so I go. 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.620
