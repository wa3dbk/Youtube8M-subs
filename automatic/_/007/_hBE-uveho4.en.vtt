is not NFL records but that's that's a

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.319 
is not NFL records but that's that's a
hell<00:01:43.649> of<00:01:43.680> a<00:01:43.860> body<00:01:44.009> of<00:01:44.250> work<00:01:44.399> I<00:01:44.579> mean<00:01:44.790> if<00:01:45.000> he<00:01:45.119> gets

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
hell of a body of work I mean if he gets

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.030 
hell of a body of work I mean if he gets
into<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:45.810> Hall<00:01:46.079> of<00:01:46.110> Fame<00:01:46.259> great<00:01:46.740> if<00:01:46.950> he

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
into the Hall of Fame great if he

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.370 
into the Hall of Fame great if he
doesn't<00:01:47.460> I<00:01:47.610> mean<00:01:48.149> I<00:01:48.270> guess<00:01:48.420> I<00:01:48.869> understand<00:01:49.259> that

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
doesn't I mean I guess I understand that

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.389 
doesn't I mean I guess I understand that
as<00:01:49.500> well<00:01:49.649> because<00:01:49.829> he<00:01:50.009> doesn't<00:01:50.189> have<00:01:50.369> the

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
as well because he doesn't have the

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.100 
as well because he doesn't have the
Super<00:01:50.729> Bowl<00:01:50.759> to<00:01:51.000> help<00:01:51.210> I<00:01:51.360> think<00:01:51.600> if<00:01:51.689> he<00:01:51.780> had<00:01:51.810> at

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
Super Bowl to help I think if he had at

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.170 
Super Bowl to help I think if he had at
least<00:01:52.229> one<00:01:52.560> Super<00:01:52.950> Bowl<00:01:53.100> ring<00:01:53.340> I'm<00:01:53.790> not<00:01:53.939> seeing

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
least one Super Bowl ring I'm not seeing

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.990 
least one Super Bowl ring I'm not seeing
me<00:01:54.420> a<00:01:54.450> shoo-in<00:01:54.990> but<00:01:55.200> I'd<00:01:55.409> say<00:01:55.680> he<00:01:56.670> stands<00:01:56.909> a

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
me a shoo-in but I'd say he stands a

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.719 
me a shoo-in but I'd say he stands a
pretty<00:01:57.210> good<00:01:57.390> shot<00:01:57.829> he<00:01:58.829> really<00:01:59.009> does<00:01:59.280> i<00:01:59.520> mean<00:01:59.700> i

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
pretty good shot he really does i mean i

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.760 
pretty good shot he really does i mean i
think<00:01:59.850> if<00:02:00.210> you<00:02:00.420> go<00:02:00.450> back<00:02:00.810> and<00:02:00.869> you<00:02:01.140> look<00:02:01.229> at<00:02:01.560> all

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
think if you go back and you look at all

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.789 
think if you go back and you look at all
the<00:02:02.149> you<00:02:03.149> know<00:02:03.270> cubies<00:02:03.780> that<00:02:04.110> are<00:02:04.200> currently

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
the you know cubies that are currently

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.859

that you know obviously were mobile and
they<00:03:07.890> went<00:03:08.190> to<00:03:08.280> the<00:03:08.370> legs<00:03:08.580> first<00:03:08.790> in<00:03:08.970> passing

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
they went to the legs first in passing

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.199 
they went to the legs first in passing
second<00:03:09.780> McNabb<00:03:10.440> was<00:03:10.470> a<00:03:10.739> past<00:03:11.070> first<00:03:11.430> guy<00:03:11.670> then

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
second McNabb was a past first guy then

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:13.970 
second McNabb was a past first guy then
he<00:03:12.300> used<00:03:12.510> his<00:03:12.660> legs<00:03:12.840> and<00:03:13.080> not<00:03:13.350> only<00:03:13.470> that<00:03:13.590> he

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
he used his legs and not only that he

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.940 
he used his legs and not only that he
had<00:03:14.250> success<00:03:14.850> doing<00:03:15.030> it<00:03:15.180> for<00:03:15.360> a<00:03:15.390> long<00:03:15.510> time<00:03:15.950> you

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
had success doing it for a long time you

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.220 
had success doing it for a long time you
know<00:03:16.980> and<00:03:17.390> and<00:03:18.390> you<00:03:18.600> you<00:03:18.810> saw<00:03:18.989> a<00:03:19.019> lot<00:03:19.200> of

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
know and and you you saw a lot of

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:20.930 
know and and you you saw a lot of
quarterbacks<00:03:19.560> I<00:03:19.830> think<00:03:20.070> two<00:03:20.489> or<00:03:20.610> three<00:03:20.760> years

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
quarterbacks I think two or three years

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.850 
quarterbacks I think two or three years
of<00:03:21.150> success<00:03:21.510> and<00:03:21.720> he<00:03:21.780> faded<00:03:22.049> went<00:03:22.440> away<00:03:22.500> and

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
of success and he faded went away and

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:24.020 
of success and he faded went away and
they<00:03:23.010> were<00:03:23.130> tired<00:03:23.310> no<00:03:23.519> one<00:03:23.700> ever<00:03:23.850> heard

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
they were tired no one ever heard

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:25.820 
they were tired no one ever heard
anything<00:03:24.239> else<00:03:24.420> about<00:03:24.600> him<00:03:24.870> but<00:03:25.320> I<00:03:25.350> do<00:03:25.500> think

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:25.830 
anything else about him but I do think

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:27.170 
anything else about him but I do think
he's<00:03:26.040> worthy<00:03:26.250> of<00:03:26.430> being<00:03:26.640> a<00:03:26.760> Hall<00:03:26.910> of<00:03:26.940> Fame

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
he's worthy of being a Hall of Fame

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.030 
he's worthy of being a Hall of Fame
player<00:03:27.450> I<00:03:27.690> definitely<00:03:27.989> think<00:03:28.350> so<00:03:28.590> I<00:03:28.769> mean

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
player I definitely think so I mean

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.580 
player I definitely think so I mean
about<00:03:29.220> your<00:03:29.430> trip
