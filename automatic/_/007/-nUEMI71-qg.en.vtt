00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:05.020
 8 strong 

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:07.490
 That voltage amplification? 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:09.879
 Is it okay to add 

00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:12.559
 How does the guitar sound change? 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:15.799
 I want to try for a moment Tess 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:18.640
 That's the vendor Bruce Jr. 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.409
 It is here 

00:00:20.409 --> 00:00:22.150
 This is an example 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:25.150
 It is to be made with an amp 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.980
 input 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:28.930
 First 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:30.330
 On the input side 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.290
 It is a vacuum tube 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.940
 In other words, it is after input 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.220
 The people who are heading first are this new space 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:40.940
 Add this 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.690
 In other words, did you come in first to answer? 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.790
 I have a market final report promotion section, but how 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:49.910
 Will it change 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.350
 I would like to introduce this to you 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:58.950
 Round-table conference Eiichi Mr. 803 I hope you will extend 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:01.190
 The light on 8103 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.219
 It is a story that this plate is almost double, this is the policy 

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:07.960
 Though it is highly reliable 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.390
 You can get Kobe city or buy from yesterday if this is really there 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:12.270
 Followed 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.440
 1. 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.440
 Two years ago 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.090
 Related eyes also revealing 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:30.909
 There is no need to walk while watching the gulf look ahead strongly 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.890
 There is no one mentioned above 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.890
 It will be quick response 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.210
 See you again 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.470
 The most serious ones are not well suited to ringing 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:43.460
 I think 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.920
 It is long from now on 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.400
 Performance as part of that 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.170
 The horse race takes 36 minutes in 1-8-10 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.560
 If wide is 74 at 4 bases 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.380
 I wanted to be specified 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:58.240
 That's what I think
