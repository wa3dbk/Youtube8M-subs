horses so our role as innovators is to

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.700 
horses so our role as innovators is to

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.920 
imagine a future that's otherwise
unmanageable<00:01:05.489> and<00:01:05.700> so<00:01:05.939> I'll<00:01:06.119> bring<00:01:06.659> in<00:01:06.780> some

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
unmanageable and so I'll bring in some

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.120 
unmanageable and so I'll bring in some
insights<00:01:07.290> that<00:01:07.380> have<00:01:07.530> nothing<00:01:07.710> to<00:01:07.860> do<00:01:08.010> with

insights that have nothing to do with

insights that have nothing to do with
automobiles<00:01:08.580> and<00:01:08.820> then<00:01:09.360> share<00:01:10.229> that<00:01:10.260> with<00:01:10.860> the
