black and that always felt I got more

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.160 
black and that always felt I got more
strikes<00:01:23.820> with<00:01:24.030> it<00:01:24.150> pretty<00:01:24.479> much<00:01:24.689> everything

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
strikes with it pretty much everything

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.410 
strikes with it pretty much everything
you're<00:01:25.320> pitching<00:01:25.680> and<00:01:25.830> flipping<00:01:26.220> in<00:01:26.430> has<00:01:27.390> a

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
you're pitching and flipping in has a

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.840 
you're pitching and flipping in has a
dark<00:01:27.930> shock<00:01:28.290> whether<00:01:28.650> it's<00:01:28.770> wood<00:01:29.070> trees<00:01:29.520> limbs

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
dark shock whether it's wood trees limbs

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.760 
dark shock whether it's wood trees limbs
for<00:01:30.150> ass<00:01:30.240> vegetation<00:01:31.049> into<00:01:31.409> basically

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
for ass vegetation into basically

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.950 
for ass vegetation into basically
distance<00:01:32.220> disappears<00:01:32.790> blends<00:01:33.090> in<00:01:33.329> so<00:01:33.570> you<00:01:33.630> get

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
distance disappears blends in so you get

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.260 
distance disappears blends in so you get
