00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:12.630
 The weather today's video has been 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.099
 suggested by the black man with 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.059
 comments from one of the latest videos 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.770
 here on the channel 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.490
 You can also do the same at the end. 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.490
 of this video 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.500
 In case you do not know the weapons are 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.420
 present in the life of man since the 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.369
 first moments of our history 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.590
 the men of the caves and used 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.540
 stones tied and tied to branches of 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.030
 trees to pierce the skin of animals 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.500
 during the hunting with the passage of time 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.660
 and the discovery of metal 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.969
 stones and wood gave way to weapons 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.160
 made in steel as spears spears and 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:50.670
 axes came the age of calls 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:53.190
 basic weapons or white weapons teixeira 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.230
 gustavo a kind of cream railway 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.059
 German to modern creations 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.890
 humanity has never been able to live 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.989
 without them the weapons 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.940
 the sound beto olive tree and I invite you to 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.660
 know the most powerful weapons of the 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:13.650
 world 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:15.750
 check today in the journal curious 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.729
 our video starts with more powerful 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.909
 pump built and tested by man 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:23.430
 its name sabongi developed by the 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:26.549
 Russians she had the power of 57 thousand and 14 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.600
 which is equivalent to 57 million load 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.820
 dynamite 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.119
 for you to have an idea she was tested 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.670
 on October 30, 1961 on an island in the 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.770
 Arctic Ocean but has a reduction of 100 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:41.060
 megatons from your original drawing to 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.060
 minimize the scale of destruction 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:52.440
 due to its sheer size it was not 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.780
 very practical for use in wars and was 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:57.660
 created to be used as advertising on 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.190
 Cold War Collapsing Bomb Was 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:01.619
 presented the Soviets on Sunday 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:04.170
 need to adapt an airplane by removing all 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:06.570
 the fuselage to transport it some 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.789
 minutes after pump launch 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.039
 all houses and buildings located 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:14.000
 in a small abandoned village about 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:17.000
 50 km from the site of the explosion were 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
 sprayed 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.989
 our video continues with a 

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:26.799
 impressive not by the power of 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:28.780
 undoing 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:30.010
 but for the precision and technology involved 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.349
 in its construction 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.090
 when it rains is an Israeli accessory 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:35.349
 for reconnaissance missions that 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.450
 require registration 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:39.489
 its main characteristic is the fact that 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:42.099
 can be moved sideways leaving 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:44.260
 the weapon cuba a camera assists the user 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:46.470
 to look more accurately at 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.470
 movie theater 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.709
 The voter is an Israeli and a member of a 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.810
 anti-terrorist group he said that the 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:57.640
 The idea was based on the current 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:00.099
 low intensity in which they involve 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:02.170
 fighting on urban land as 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:04.540
 interior of buildings aircraft door 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.819
 cars and three and the main intention is 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.650
 protect the lives of innocents by increasing 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:10.239
 your chances of survival 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.750
 the water comes equipped with several cameras 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:16.090
 detachable zoom day night and thermal kit 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:18.370
 transmission of audio video injuries 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:21.480
 infrared tactical flashlights and 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.480
 many other accessories 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:31.239
 another area that deserves attention is theirs 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.130
 is in the single action revolver made 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:36.310
 in Austria which is considered the most 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:38.379
 powerful machine of the world the weight of six 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:40.959
 pounds and the compliance of 55 centimeters 

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:43.180
 not only scare but also require a good 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:44.889
 physical fitness of those who shoot although the 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.639
 thigh is not too violent and 

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:47.639
 uncontrollable 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:58.470
 because of its size so it stays 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:00.810
 usually supported by a 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:02.099
 the small sand bags 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:04.379
 when the shot 

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:07.739
 the young man's cartridge was developed 

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:09.720
 originally in 1899 for large 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:10.980
 hunters who will go to africa to hunt 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.989
 elephants 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.459
 today they are made to order and 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:17.910
 I can advance to you who are 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:24.060
 quite expensive about 124 reais 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:26.699
 by guys cartridge and that is to leave 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:28.410
 any fan of robocop pressed to 

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:30.750
 samsung that produces 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:32.190
 electronic devices has developed a 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:34.229
 machine gun that works 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:37.650
 automatically that neither the police 

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:40.260
 future of robocop o sgr a 1 is a combo 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:41.940
 South Korean sentinel and was developed 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:44.039
 to replace humans in the area 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:45.150
 demilitarized at the border with 

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:47.430
 North Korea 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:49.800
 the robot capable of tracking multiple targets 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:52.500
 using infrared and 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:55.139
 light camera are two high cameras 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:56.610
 range that distinguish humans 

00:04:55.139 --> 00:05:00.060
 of other objects 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:01.979
 the sgr has a five point machine gun 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:05.160
 5 mm and a grenade launcher 

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:07.680
 of 40 mm which are used 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:09.630
 command of a human operator 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:12.750
 the justification for the use of the sentinel 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:14.370
 It's quite simple human soldiers can 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:15.330
 easily fall asleep or become 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:17.460
 deconcentrate 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:19.349
 but these robots provide surveillance 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:21.210
 which leaves no room for 

00:05:19.349 --> 00:05:23.660
 anything like laziness 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:26.280
 said a spokesman for samsung 

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:28.729
 When the system was tested by the 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:28.729
 first time 

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:34.930
 on the same footprint as the previous 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:37.030
 we could not finish this video without 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:38.740
 to talk about the deaf the first robot 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:40.390
 equipped with guns and when I say 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:42.520
 guns is not an exaggeration 

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:44.710
 with only one meter it can carry the 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:46.810
 true and varied after all it still 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:48.880
 can climb stairs to dive for up 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:51.130
 five meters and has very good mobility 

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:54.070
 in the snow a kind of soldier with the 

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:56.440
 breath in 2007 for the first time 

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:59.020
 time in the history the army of the states 

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:59.680
 United States sent armed robberies to 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:01.810
 of war 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:03.760
 the equipment has been used in Iraq the 

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:06.850
 white can move at a speed 

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:08.800
 of 6.6 kilometers per hour and battery 

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:11.560
 with a four-hour 

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:18.040
 circular on sandy lands mud snow 

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:19.600
 or up to the vegetation area and try 

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:20.800
 video is running out, we can 

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:21.940
 draw some conclusions well 

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:23.740
 interesting 

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:26.050
 the incredible human being he can 

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:27.520
 to reinvent and overcome the difficulties of 

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:28.570
 intelligence and their own 

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:30.310
 needs 

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:32.260
 the negative point and maybe more 

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:34.570
 important is due to the use of 

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:36.670
 so many resources in the name of violence 

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:38.440
 if it's much cooler to use all this and 

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:40.900
 for curing diseases and other 

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:43.540
 much healthier needs 

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:45.460
 but it's good we know everything that blinds us and 

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:47.890
 that we are capable of doing 

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:50.020
 more than we do every day 

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:51.850
 do not forget to write if on the channel 

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:52.660
 Please indicate this video to your 

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:54.070
 friends 

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:56.170
 this is very important for the channel 

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:57.970
 grow the comments also for 

00:06:56.170 --> 00:07:01.230
 suggest topics for upcoming videos 

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:01.230
 We see you soon
