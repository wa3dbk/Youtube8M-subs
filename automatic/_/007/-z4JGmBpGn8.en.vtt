00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
that's what I was trying to distinguish

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.010 
that's what I was trying to distinguish
some<00:02:29.730> of<00:02:29.820> the<00:02:29.880> guys<00:02:30.030> we're<00:02:30.270> looking<00:02:30.540> for<00:02:30.720> a<00:02:30.750> car

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
some of the guys we're looking for a car

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:34.340 
some of the guys we're looking for a car
cover<00:02:31.230> on<00:02:32.030> EP<00:02:33.030> hatch<00:02:33.239> and<00:02:33.600> I<00:02:33.690> made<00:02:34.170> that

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
cover on EP hatch and I made that

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:40.160 
cover on EP hatch and I made that
distinction<00:02:34.830> before<00:02:35.610> them<00:02:37.459> car<00:02:38.459> covers<00:02:39.170> some

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
distinction before them car covers some

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.080 
distinction before them car covers some
car<00:02:40.380> covers<00:02:40.770> say<00:02:41.550> they<00:02:41.730> are<00:02:41.940> water<00:02:42.810> resistant

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
car covers say they are water resistant

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.180 
car covers say they are water resistant
not<00:02:45.090> waterproof<00:02:45.630> and<00:02:46.410> you<00:02:46.680> have<00:02:46.830> to<00:02:47.010> be

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
not waterproof and you have to be

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.509 
not waterproof and you have to be
careful<00:02:47.580> that<00:02:48.080> but<00:02:49.080> this<00:02:49.260> car<00:02:49.980> cover<00:02:50.220> is

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:50.519 
careful that but this car cover is

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:53.360 
careful that but this car cover is
pretty<00:02:51.000> much<00:02:51.120> waterproof<00:02:51.690> so<00:02:52.620> I<00:02:53.010> haven't

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
pretty much waterproof so I haven't

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.430 
pretty much waterproof so I haven't
noticed<00:02:53.730> any<00:02:53.970> water<00:02:54.239> going<00:02:54.510> through<00:02:54.660> it<00:02:54.959> so

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
noticed any water going through it so

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.860 
noticed any water going through it so
that's<00:02:56.310> because<00:02:56.489> it's<00:02:56.670> a<00:02:56.760> cover<00:02:56.970> craft<00:02:57.239> and<00:02:57.630> it

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
that's because it's a cover craft and it
