time to learn all the names along yes we
are<00:00:14.610> actually<00:00:14.990> because<00:00:15.990> there's<00:00:16.199> actually

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
are actually because there's actually

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.990

only<00:00:16.859> seven<00:00:17.520> names<00:00:17.789> for<00:00:18.150> all<00:00:18.210> these<00:00:18.420> keys<00:00:18.830> so

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:20.000 
only seven names for all these keys so

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.220 
only seven names for all these keys so
what<00:00:21.000> would<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:21.330> names<00:00:21.510> be<00:00:21.720> based<00:00:21.960> off<00:00:22.199> of

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
what would the names be based off of

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.250 
what would the names be based off of
well<00:00:22.830> it's<00:00:23.160> actually<00:00:23.340> the<00:00:23.609> English<00:00:23.939> alphabet

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:24.260 
well it's actually the English alphabet

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:30.620 
well it's actually the English alphabet
so<00:00:27.529> a-b-c-d-e-f-g

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:36.229 

that's<00:00:31.619> it<00:00:32.630> so<00:00:33.739> there<00:00:34.739> are<00:00:34.770> actually<00:00:35.190> 88<00:00:35.880> keys

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
that's it so there are actually 88 keys

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.630 
that's it so there are actually 88 keys
in<00:00:36.450> this<00:00:36.540> whole<00:00:36.750> piano<00:00:36.989> so<00:00:37.469> somehow<00:00:37.920> seven

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
in this whole piano so somehow seven

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.680 
in this whole piano so somehow seven
letters<00:00:39.030> can't<00:00:39.390> really<00:00:40.280> you<00:00:41.280> know<00:00:41.690> seven

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
letters can't really you know seven

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.410 
letters can't really you know seven
eight<00:00:43.610> there's<00:00:44.610> something<00:00:44.850> wrong<00:00:44.969> here

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
eight there's something wrong here

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.170 
eight there's something wrong here
unless<00:00:46.379> they<00:00:46.649> just<00:00:46.860> repeat<00:00:47.160> don't<00:00:47.730> die<00:00:47.910> so

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
unless they just repeat don't die so

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.049 
unless they just repeat don't die so
this<00:00:49.079> actually<00:00:49.590> repeats<00:00:49.950> from<00:00:50.219> here<00:00:50.550> to<00:00:50.730> here

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
this actually repeats from here to here

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.770 
this actually repeats from here to here
so<00:00:51.930> on<00:00:52.199> a<00:00:52.260> standard<00:00:52.860> piano<00:00:53.340> like<00:00:54.120> a<00:00:54.180> full-size

made<00:02:06.409> into<00:02:06.560> white<00:02:06.829> keys<00:02:07.099> and<00:02:07.340> then<00:02:07.429> pushed

00:02:07.779 --> 00:02:07.789 
made into white keys and then pushed

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:11.530 
made into white keys and then pushed
into<00:02:08.299> the<00:02:08.569> spaces<00:02:09.049> in<00:02:09.170> between<00:02:09.200> right<00:02:10.540> the

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
into the spaces in between right the

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.740 
into the spaces in between right the
whole<00:02:11.690> point<00:02:12.019> of<00:02:12.170> these<00:02:12.349> is<00:02:12.650> to<00:02:12.799> actually<00:02:13.750> be

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
whole point of these is to actually be

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.270 
whole point of these is to actually be
able<00:02:14.840> to<00:02:14.930> determine<00:02:15.260> where<00:02:15.650> you<00:02:15.860> are<00:02:16.010> playing

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
able to determine where you are playing

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.530 
able to determine where you are playing
because<00:02:16.489> imagine<00:02:16.940> if<00:02:17.030> someone<00:02:17.239> just<00:02:17.390> like

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
because imagine if someone just like

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.830 
because imagine if someone just like
okay<00:02:17.870> well<00:02:18.079> I'll<00:02:18.170> play<00:02:18.440> the<00:02:18.879> you<00:02:19.879> know<00:02:20.000> the<00:02:20.390> 71

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
okay well I'll play the you know the 71

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.500 
okay well I'll play the you know the 71
key<00:02:21.110> up<00:02:21.319> here<00:02:21.590> at<00:02:21.799> the<00:02:21.890> sunny<00:02:22.099> not<00:02:22.459> 71<00:02:23.030> sub<00:02:23.390> me

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
key up here at the sunny not 71 sub me

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.650 
key up here at the sunny not 71 sub me
first<00:02:23.829> semi<00:02:24.829> first<00:02:25.160> key<00:02:25.400> and<00:02:25.760> then<00:02:25.879> like<00:02:26.120> the

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
first semi first key and then like the

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.380 
first semi first key and then like the
29th<00:02:27.200> and<00:02:27.500> the<00:02:27.530> 38<00:02:28.010> together<00:02:28.640> or<00:02:29.060> something

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
29th and the 38 together or something

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.270 
29th and the 38 together or something
like<00:02:29.510> that<00:02:29.650> how<00:02:30.650> do<00:02:30.709> you<00:02:30.920> really<00:02:31.340> know<00:02:31.629> right

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
like that how do you really know right

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.680 
like that how do you really know right
because<00:02:34.280> there'd<00:02:34.459> be<00:02:34.549> no<00:02:34.700> way<00:02:34.849> to<00:02:34.879> count<00:02:35.209> that

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
because there'd be no way to count that

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.140 
because there'd be no way to count that
this<00:02:36.019> is<00:02:36.170> a<00:02:36.379> or<00:02:36.890> C<00:02:37.099> or<00:02:37.129> whatever<00:02:37.609> unless<00:02:38.000> you

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
this is a or C or whatever unless you

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:39.460 
this is a or C or whatever unless you
have<00:02:38.299> these<00:02:38.540> because<00:02:38.840> that<00:02:38.989> actually<00:02:39.170> shows

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
have these because that actually shows

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.559 
have these because that actually shows
the<00:02:39.500> shape<00:02:39.859> of<00:02:40.040> the<00:02:40.130> key<00:02:40.340> and<00:02:40.940> it<00:02:41.090> gives<00:02:41.239> you<00:02:41.389> an

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:41.569 
the shape of the key and it gives you an

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:43.720 
the shape of the key and it gives you an
idea<00:02:41.870> of<00:02:41.900> where<00:02:42.079> you<00:02:42.200> are<00:02:42.310> so<00:02:43.310> that's<00:02:43.489> actually

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
idea of where you are so that's actually

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.610 
idea of where you are so that's actually
how<00:02:44.030> you<00:02:44.090> find<00:02:44.480> the<00:02:44.720> key<00:02:44.870> you're<00:02:45.049> looking<00:02:45.349> for

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
how you find the key you're looking for

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.099 
how you find the key you're looking for
when<00:02:45.769> you're<00:02:45.859> playing<00:02:46.069> on<00:02:46.190> the<00:02:46.250> piano<00:02:47.109> now

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:48.109 
when you're playing on the piano now

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:49.210 
when you're playing on the piano now
this<00:02:48.349> is<00:02:48.500> the<00:02:48.590> easy<00:02:48.739> way

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
this is the easy way

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.780 
this is the easy way
like<00:02:49.400> the<00:02:49.579> failsafe<00:02:50.299> way<00:02:50.720> to<00:02:51.049> go<00:02:51.169> ABCD<00:02:52.010> efg<00:02:52.040> and

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
like the failsafe way to go ABCD efg and

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.940 
like the failsafe way to go ABCD efg and
then<00:02:53.630> I<00:02:53.660> have<00:02:53.840> a<00:02:53.870> couple<00:02:54.079> tricks<00:02:54.410> for<00:02:54.650> learning

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
then I have a couple tricks for learning

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.050 
then I have a couple tricks for learning
how<00:02:55.220> to<00:02:55.250> memorize<00:02:56.180> those<00:02:56.419> keys<00:02:57.489> so<00:02:58.489> to<00:02:58.579> find<00:02:58.940> a

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
how to memorize those keys so to find a

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.199 
how to memorize those keys so to find a
C<00:02:59.299> which<00:02:59.720> is<00:02:59.930> the<00:03:00.290> most<00:03:00.440> important<00:03:00.980> key

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
C which is the most important key

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:03.520 
C which is the most important key
basically<00:03:02.209> well<00:03:02.510> it's<00:03:02.599> not<00:03:02.720> really<00:03:02.900> the<00:03:03.349> most

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
basically well it's not really the most

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:05.319 
basically well it's not really the most
important<00:03:04.040> but<00:03:04.160> it's<00:03:04.340> the<00:03:04.430> most<00:03:04.609> centrally

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:05.329 
important but it's the most centrally

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:08.680 
important but it's the most centrally
used<00:03:06.639> so<00:03:07.639> there's<00:03:07.910> the<00:03:08.030> C<00:03:08.239> up<00:03:08.329> at<00:03:08.450> the<00:03:08.510> top

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
used so there's the C up at the top

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:10.659 
used so there's the C up at the top
there<00:03:09.019> at<00:03:09.139> the<00:03:09.260> bottom<00:03:09.590> now<00:03:09.739> in<00:03:09.889> the<00:03:09.980> middle<00:03:10.310> we

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:10.669 
there at the bottom now in the middle we

00:03:10.669 --> 00:03:14.500 
there at the bottom now in the middle we
have<00:03:10.700> what's<00:03:11.209> called<00:03:11.389> middle<00:03:11.900> C<00:03:12.349> and<00:03:13.510> that's

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
have what's called middle C and that's

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:15.280 
have what's called middle C and that's
what<00:03:14.690> we'll<00:03:14.780> see<00:03:14.900> you<00:03:14.989> right<00:03:15.049> there

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
what we'll see you right there

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.610 
what we'll see you right there
all<00:03:15.980> we<00:03:16.099> do<00:03:16.250> is<00:03:16.370> we<00:03:16.459> look<00:03:16.579> for<00:03:16.639> two<00:03:17.000> black<00:03:17.269> keys

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
all we do is we look for two black keys

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.230 
all we do is we look for two black keys
and<00:03:18.620> then<00:03:18.799> it's<00:03:19.099> the<00:03:19.220> left<00:03:19.430> of<00:03:19.609> that

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:22.240 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:27.840 

not<00:03:23.240> see<00:03:23.890> now<00:03:24.890> if<00:03:25.190> we're<00:03:25.790> gonna<00:03:25.850> find<00:03:26.210> a<00:03:26.510> so<00:03:27.050> a

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:27.850 
not see now if we're gonna find a so a

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:31.290 
not see now if we're gonna find a so a
would<00:03:28.850> be<00:03:28.880> you<00:03:29.270> find<00:03:29.570> three<00:03:29.960> Black<00:03:30.230> Keys<00:03:30.260> and

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:31.300 
would be you find three Black Keys and

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:33.580 
would be you find three Black Keys and
then<00:03:32.300> go<00:03:32.570> to<00:03:32.630> the<00:03:32.780> middle<00:03:33.020> one<00:03:33.140> that's<00:03:33.440> the

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
then go to the middle one that's the

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:36.280 
then go to the middle one that's the
three<00:03:33.860> and<00:03:34.400> then<00:03:34.610> go<00:03:34.730> to<00:03:34.790> the<00:03:34.910> right<00:03:35.290> three

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
three and then go to the right three

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:39.100 
three and then go to the right three
middle<00:03:37.300> now<00:03:38.300> we<00:03:38.360> go<00:03:38.540> somewhere<00:03:38.750> else

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:39.110 
middle now we go somewhere else

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:42.460 
middle now we go somewhere else
three<00:03:39.680> head<00:03:40.280> all<00:03:40.400> right<00:03:40.790> that's<00:03:41.480> an<00:03:41.600> egg<00:03:41.780> these

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:42.470 
three head all right that's an egg these

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:52.180 
three head all right that's an egg these
are<00:03:42.650> all<00:03:42.830> A's<00:03:47.830> those<00:03:48.830> are<00:03:48.980> all<00:03:49.190> A's<00:03:50.680> okay<00:03:51.680> so<00:03:51.740> a

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:52.190 
are all A's those are all A's okay so a

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:53.800 
are all A's those are all A's okay so a
stuck<00:03:52.610> that<00:03:52.850> after<00:03:53.120> you<00:03:53.180> ever<00:03:53.300> don't<00:03:53.540> want<00:03:53.660> to

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
stuck that after you ever don't want to

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:55.840 
stuck that after you ever don't want to
find<00:03:54.050> you<00:03:54.380> know<00:03:54.500> you<00:03:55.130> don't<00:03:55.250> just<00:03:55.370> count<00:03:55.700> up

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:55.850 
find you know you don't just count up

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:57.370 
find you know you don't just count up
the<00:03:55.970> letter<00:03:56.180> of<00:03:56.330> the<00:03:56.420> alphabet<00:03:56.600> you<00:03:57.020> just<00:03:57.230> go

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:57.380 
the letter of the alphabet you just go

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:59.050 
the letter of the alphabet you just go
find<00:03:57.800> those<00:03:58.040> two<00:03:58.250> black<00:03:58.460> keys<00:03:58.640> and<00:03:58.850> go<00:03:58.910> hey

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
find those two black keys and go hey

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:04.900 
find those two black keys and go hey
baby<00:04:01.209> ABCD<00:04:02.209> efg<00:04:02.980> so<00:04:03.980> that's<00:04:04.160> how<00:04:04.310> that<00:04:04.490> works

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:04.910 
baby ABCD efg so that's how that works

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:07.900 
baby ABCD efg so that's how that works
now<00:04:05.630> there's<00:04:06.620> other<00:04:06.770> ways<00:04:06.860> to<00:04:07.040> memorize<00:04:07.640> them

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:07.910 
now there's other ways to memorize them

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:10.570 
now there's other ways to memorize them
because<00:04:08.300> eventually<00:04:08.570> want<00:04:08.900> to<00:04:09.280> make<00:04:10.280> it<00:04:10.430> so

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:10.580 
because eventually want to make it so

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:11.980 
because eventually want to make it so
that<00:04:10.610> you<00:04:10.820> can<00:04:10.970> just<00:04:11.090> look<00:04:11.300> at<00:04:11.450> a<00:04:11.480> key<00:04:11.690> and<00:04:11.840> know

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:11.990 
that you can just look at a key and know

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:14.050 
that you can just look at a key and know
it's<00:04:12.200> note<00:04:12.380> name<00:04:12.620> so<00:04:13.370> I've<00:04:13.490> done<00:04:13.670> that<00:04:13.730> with

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060 
it's note name so I've done that with

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:17.020 
it's note name so I've done that with
people<00:04:14.690> in<00:04:14.990> my<00:04:15.560> lessons<00:04:15.980> like<00:04:16.280> the<00:04:16.670> first

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.030 
people in my lessons like the first

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:19.030 
people in my lessons like the first
lesson<00:04:17.540> they<00:04:17.660> know<00:04:17.870> all<00:04:18.170> the<00:04:18.470> keys<00:04:18.799> on<00:04:18.950> the

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:19.040 
lesson they know all the keys on the

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.220 
lesson they know all the keys on the
piano<00:04:19.160> and<00:04:19.430> they<00:04:19.489> can<00:04:19.670> hit<00:04:19.880> the<00:04:20.030> keys<00:04:20.269> so<00:04:21.019> it<00:04:21.109> is

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:21.230 
piano and they can hit the keys so it is

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:22.840 
piano and they can hit the keys so it is
possible<00:04:21.470> to<00:04:21.799> learn<00:04:22.010> it<00:04:22.130> very<00:04:22.280> quickly<00:04:22.520> if<00:04:22.730> you

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:22.850 
possible to learn it very quickly if you

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:25.270 
possible to learn it very quickly if you
just<00:04:22.880> want<00:04:23.240> to<00:04:23.320> the<00:04:24.320> biggest<00:04:24.650> part<00:04:24.830> of<00:04:24.860> piano

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 
just want to the biggest part of piano

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.000 
just want to the biggest part of piano
just<00:04:26.000> like<00:04:26.210> anything<00:04:26.419> else<00:04:26.660> is<00:04:26.990> the<00:04:27.650> amount<00:04:27.830> of

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:28.010 
just like anything else is the amount of

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:30.520 
just like anything else is the amount of
determination<00:04:28.340> you<00:04:28.760> have<00:04:28.880> to<00:04:29.090> learn<00:04:29.600> it<00:04:29.780> so

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:30.530 
determination you have to learn it so

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:32.050 
determination you have to learn it so
it's<00:04:30.710> mainly<00:04:30.950> up<00:04:31.190> to<00:04:31.340> you<00:04:31.520> and<00:04:31.669> how<00:04:31.790> much<00:04:31.850> you

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:32.060 
it's mainly up to you and how much you

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:33.940 
it's mainly up to you and how much you
practice<00:04:32.270> and<00:04:32.750> then<00:04:33.140> the<00:04:33.230> information<00:04:33.470> I<00:04:33.800> give

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:33.950 
practice and then the information I give

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:35.650 
practice and then the information I give
you<00:04:34.070> you<00:04:34.220> can<00:04:34.400> use<00:04:34.550> those<00:04:34.700> tools<00:04:34.940> to<00:04:35.210> speed<00:04:35.510> up

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:35.660 
you you can use those tools to speed up

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:38.170 
you you can use those tools to speed up
your<00:04:35.690> progress<00:04:37.030> okay

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.180 
your progress okay

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:42.480 
your progress okay
so<00:04:38.300> this<00:04:38.540> is<00:04:38.720> C<00:04:39.820> that's<00:04:40.820> it

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:42.490 
so this is C that's it

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.450 
so this is C that's it
so<00:04:43.090> a<00:04:43.120> is<00:04:43.389> to<00:04:43.569> the<00:04:43.690> right<00:04:43.840> of<00:04:44.440> the<00:04:44.650> middle<00:04:44.830> like

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:45.460 
so a is to the right of the middle like

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:49.559 
so a is to the right of the middle like
you<00:04:45.699> and<00:04:47.039> see<00:04:48.039> it's<00:04:48.190> a<00:04:48.340> left<00:04:48.850> of<00:04:49.090> the<00:04:49.180> two<00:04:49.360> black

00:04:49.559 --> 00:04:49.569 
you and see it's a left of the two black

00:04:49.569 --> 00:04:52.499 
you and see it's a left of the two black
kids<00:04:50.130> now<00:04:51.130> we<00:04:51.550> have<00:04:51.669> another<00:04:51.880> one<00:04:52.000> called<00:04:52.360> the

00:04:52.499 --> 00:04:52.509 
kids now we have another one called the

00:04:52.509 --> 00:04:56.219 
kids now we have another one called the
app<00:04:53.130> so<00:04:54.130> you've<00:04:54.280> got<00:04:54.400> three<00:04:54.669> Black<00:04:54.880> Keys<00:04:55.229> good

00:04:56.219 --> 00:04:56.229 
app so you've got three Black Keys good

00:04:56.229 --> 00:04:56.760 
app so you've got three Black Keys good
luck

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:56.770 
luck

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:00.600 
luck
so<00:04:57.729> look<00:04:58.030> at<00:04:58.150> this<00:04:58.289> C<00:04:59.289> and<00:04:59.500> F<00:04:59.740> look<00:05:00.190> very

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:00.610 
so look at this C and F look very

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:02.010 
so look at this C and F look very
similar<00:05:01.060> don't<00:05:01.300> that<00:05:01.419> they<00:05:01.569> almost<00:05:01.720> look<00:05:01.990> like

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:02.020 
similar don't that they almost look like

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:04.890 
similar don't that they almost look like
copy<00:05:02.590> to<00:05:02.800> each<00:05:02.830> other<00:05:03.190> if<00:05:04.180> you<00:05:04.330> only<00:05:04.539> had<00:05:04.720> two

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:04.900 
copy to each other if you only had two

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:07.260 
copy to each other if you only had two
Black<00:05:05.139> Keys<00:05:05.169> here<00:05:05.800> and<00:05:06.550> two<00:05:06.639> Black<00:05:06.819> Keys<00:05:06.849> here

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:07.270 
Black Keys here and two Black Keys here

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:10.320 
Black Keys here and two Black Keys here
they'd<00:05:07.660> look<00:05:07.870> identical<00:05:08.970> so<00:05:09.970> what<00:05:10.240> we

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:10.330 
they'd look identical so what we

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:12.809 
they'd look identical so what we
actually<00:05:10.660> have<00:05:10.750> to<00:05:10.840> do<00:05:11.050> is<00:05:11.349> we<00:05:12.340> have<00:05:12.460> to<00:05:12.610> see

00:05:12.809 --> 00:05:12.819 
actually have to do is we have to see

00:05:12.819 --> 00:05:14.490 
actually have to do is we have to see
the<00:05:12.970> difference<00:05:13.270> in<00:05:13.389> area<00:05:13.569> this<00:05:13.870> is<00:05:14.080> two<00:05:14.259> Black

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:14.500 
the difference in area this is two Black

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:17.100 
the difference in area this is two Black
Keys<00:05:14.530> and<00:05:14.770> that's<00:05:15.099> three<00:05:15.460> so<00:05:16.389> people<00:05:16.810> can<00:05:16.960> get

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:17.110 
Keys and that's three so people can get

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:18.990 
Keys and that's three so people can get
those<00:05:17.320> two<00:05:17.530> confused<00:05:17.710> so<00:05:18.490> that's<00:05:18.669> why<00:05:18.789> I<00:05:18.849> try

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:19.000 
those two confused so that's why I try

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.879 
those two confused so that's why I try
to<00:05:19.030> teach<00:05:19.240> them<00:05:19.300> at<00:05:19.539> the<00:05:19.630> same<00:05:19.810> time<00:05:19.889> to

00:05:20.879 --> 00:05:20.889 
to teach them at the same time to

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:22.560 
to teach them at the same time to
explain<00:05:21.190> the<00:05:21.430> differences<00:05:21.940> so<00:05:22.000> that<00:05:22.330> they

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:22.570 
explain the differences so that they

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:26.909 
explain the differences so that they
don't<00:05:22.840> get<00:05:23.169> confused<00:05:24.930> so<00:05:25.930> if<00:05:26.020> C<00:05:26.289> has<00:05:26.500> two<00:05:26.710> Black

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:26.919 
don't get confused so if C has two Black

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:28.890 
don't get confused so if C has two Black
Keys<00:05:26.949> and<00:05:27.190> F<00:05:27.550> has<00:05:27.789> three<00:05:28.120> that's<00:05:28.419> the<00:05:28.599> only

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:28.900 
Keys and F has three that's the only

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:30.270 
Keys and F has three that's the only
difference<00:05:29.020> because<00:05:29.530> they<00:05:29.650> look<00:05:29.800> exactly<00:05:30.099> the

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:30.280 
difference because they look exactly the

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:30.810 
difference because they look exactly the
same

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:30.820 
same

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:33.450 
same
okay<00:05:31.509> now<00:05:32.110> the<00:05:32.169> other<00:05:32.410> two<00:05:32.650> look-alikes<00:05:33.190> are

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:33.460 
okay now the other two look-alikes are

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:38.460 
okay now the other two look-alikes are
the<00:05:33.880> e<00:05:33.909> key<00:05:34.419> and<00:05:34.720> the<00:05:35.050> B<00:05:35.590> key<00:05:36.039> so<00:05:36.729> E<00:05:36.940> and<00:05:37.330> B<00:05:37.509> fun

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:38.470 
the e key and the B key so E and B fun

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:39.020 
the e key and the B key so E and B fun
man

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:39.030 
man

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:43.050 
man
so<00:05:40.169> he<00:05:41.169> has<00:05:41.470> two<00:05:41.710> and<00:05:41.979> B<00:05:42.220> has<00:05:42.460> three<00:05:42.729> that's

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:43.060 
so he has two and B has three that's

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:45.779 
so he has two and B has three that's
basically<00:05:43.449> it<00:05:43.659> he's<00:05:44.409> got<00:05:44.620> to<00:05:44.830> he's<00:05:45.280> got<00:05:45.520> three

00:05:45.779 --> 00:05:45.789 
basically it he's got to he's got three

00:05:45.789 --> 00:05:48.570 
basically it he's got to he's got three
and<00:05:46.409> that's<00:05:47.409> all<00:05:47.560> you<00:05:47.710> can<00:05:47.889> do<00:05:48.009> so<00:05:48.220> you<00:05:48.280> go<00:05:48.430> back

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:48.580 
and that's all you can do so you go back

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:50.129 
and that's all you can do so you go back
and<00:05:48.759> forth<00:05:48.820> between<00:05:49.180> those<00:05:49.509> try<00:05:49.840> testing

00:05:50.129 --> 00:05:50.139 
and forth between those try testing

00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:54.360 
and forth between those try testing
yourself<00:05:50.349> like<00:05:50.620> that<00:05:51.000> okay<00:05:52.000> now<00:05:52.030> the<00:05:52.240> next
