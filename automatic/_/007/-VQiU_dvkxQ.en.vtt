00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.150
 young people and 12 chairs the twelve objects and 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.980
 12 months 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.539

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.939
 quickly possible waters to the room and 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:33.809
 at each turn the last one is eliminated 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:35.790
 you're going to go to that moment of the 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.910
 evening there are some who have reasons to 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.910
 worry 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:48.350

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:09.390
 the car keys of the stopped dishes 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.420

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.159
 family concept disappears 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.159
 completely 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.630

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.909

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.229

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:33.329
 whatever you are no more than eight 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.590

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:40.369
