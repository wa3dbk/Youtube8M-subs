00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
gives me a full house and like a low

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:52.219 
gives me a full house and like a low
card<00:01:47.479> and<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.630> big<00:01:48.869> blind<00:01:48.990> has<00:01:50.060> aces<00:01:51.110> so<00:01:52.110> he

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
card and the big blind has aces so he

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.780 
card and the big blind has aces so he
gets<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.439> top<00:01:52.590> board<00:01:52.860> I<00:01:53.130> get<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.520> bottom

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
gets the top board I get the bottom

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.340 
gets the top board I get the bottom
board<00:01:53.909> small<00:01:54.479> blind<00:01:54.890> how<00:01:55.890> to<00:01:55.950> wrap<00:01:56.159> the<00:01:56.310> mist

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
board small blind how to wrap the mist

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.389 
board small blind how to wrap the mist
so<00:01:58.350> we<00:01:58.469> should<00:01:58.590> be<00:01:58.649> splitting<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.009> side<00:01:59.189> pot

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
so we should be splitting the side pot

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.300 
so we should be splitting the side pot
and<00:02:00.439> we<00:02:01.439> should<00:02:01.560> be<00:02:01.619> splitting<00:02:01.890> the<00:02:01.950> main<00:02:02.100> pot

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
and we should be splitting the main pot

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.190 
and we should be splitting the main pot
so<00:02:02.670> I<00:02:02.700> should<00:02:03.030> be<00:02:03.060> getting<00:02:03.180> 18<00:02:03.810> K<00:02:03.960> from<00:02:04.020> the

so I should be getting 18 K from the

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.990 
so I should be getting 18 K from the
main<00:02:04.350> pot<00:02:04.530> and<00:02:05.250> then<00:02:05.369> this<00:02:05.549> point<00:02:05.700> the<00:02:05.880> guy

at<00:02:21.830> the<00:02:21.920> casino<00:02:22.250> that<00:02:22.280> I<00:02:22.690> sort<00:02:23.690> of<00:02:23.780> like<00:02:23.840> had

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
at the casino that I sort of like had

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.110 
at the casino that I sort of like had
I'd<00:02:24.950> heard<00:02:25.220> something<00:02:25.610> about<00:02:25.760> it<00:02:25.850> I<00:02:25.910> wasn't

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
I'd heard something about it I wasn't

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.510 
I'd heard something about it I wasn't
quite<00:02:26.330> sure<00:02:26.390> because<00:02:26.930> I<00:02:27.350> thought<00:02:27.950> if<00:02:28.250> it<00:02:28.370> was<00:02:28.490> a

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520 
quite sure because I thought if it was a

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:29.500 
quite sure because I thought if it was a
three-way<00:02:28.700> pot<00:02:28.910> they<00:02:29.000> wouldn't<00:02:29.210> let<00:02:29.270> us<00:02:29.330> run

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
three-way pot they wouldn't let us run

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.540 
three-way pot they wouldn't let us run
it<00:02:29.570> twice<00:02:29.690> at<00:02:29.900> all<00:02:29.990> like<00:02:30.950> I<00:02:31.040> thought<00:02:31.220> I<00:02:31.400> didn't

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
it twice at all like I thought I didn't

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:32.950 
it twice at all like I thought I didn't
realize<00:02:31.760> that<00:02:31.910> it<00:02:31.970> was<00:02:32.060> a<00:02:32.090> side<00:02:32.360> pod<00:02:32.570> main<00:02:32.750> pod

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:32.960 
realize that it was a side pod main pod

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.630 
realize that it was a side pod main pod
thing<00:02:33.140> so<00:02:33.590> I<00:02:33.620> thought<00:02:33.920> as<00:02:34.100> long<00:02:34.160> as<00:02:34.310> once<00:02:34.550> they

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
thing so I thought as long as once they

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.040 
thing so I thought as long as once they
agreed<00:02:35.060> that<00:02:35.150> we<00:02:35.240> could<00:02:35.360> run<00:02:35.450> it<00:02:35.570> twice<00:02:35.720> then

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
agreed that we could run it twice then

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.020 
agreed that we could run it twice then
then<00:02:36.590> it<00:02:36.680> was<00:02:36.800> then<00:02:37.550> we<00:02:37.670> were<00:02:37.730> running<00:02:37.910> twice

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
then it was then we were running twice

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:43.780 
then it was then we were running twice
for<00:02:38.150> the<00:02:38.180> whole<00:02:38.300> thing<00:02:40.630> so<00:02:42.730> obviously<00:02:43.730> I

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
for the whole thing so obviously I

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.930 
for the whole thing so obviously I
protest<00:02:44.240> a<00:02:44.600> crowd<00:02:45.320> gathers<00:02:45.770> it's<00:02:46.160> like<00:02:46.460> mayhem

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940

can talk about it you know and and and
in<00:04:44.210> their<00:04:44.330> point<00:04:44.510> is<00:04:44.690> that<00:04:44.900> this<00:04:45.020> is<00:04:45.200> the<00:04:45.320> house

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:45.440 
in their point is that this is the house

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.980 
in their point is that this is the house
rule<00:04:45.770> and<00:04:46.010> that<00:04:46.370> that's<00:04:46.580> that<00:04:46.790> and<00:04:47.150> and<00:04:47.810> they

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:47.990 
rule and that that's that and and they

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:49.180 
rule and that that's that and and they
follow<00:04:48.290> the<00:04:48.350> rule<00:04:48.560> therefore<00:04:48.890> it<00:04:48.980> couldn't

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:49.190 
follow the rule therefore it couldn't

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:50.260 
follow the rule therefore it couldn't
have<00:04:49.280> been<00:04:49.310> it<00:04:49.610> couldn't<00:04:49.790> have<00:04:49.880> been<00:04:49.910> me

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:50.270 
have been it couldn't have been me

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:52.180 
have been it couldn't have been me
getting<00:04:50.510> cheated<00:04:50.660> but<00:04:51.500> the<00:04:51.560> issue<00:04:51.680> is<00:04:51.860> that<00:04:51.890> is

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:52.190 
getting cheated but the issue is that is

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:55.060 
getting cheated but the issue is that is
is<00:04:52.460> that<00:04:52.520> all<00:04:53.000> night<00:04:53.840> we<00:04:54.050> were<00:04:54.200> we<00:04:54.950> were

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:55.070 
is that all night we were we were

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:56.800 
is that all night we were we were
running<00:04:55.310> it<00:04:55.430> twice<00:04:55.520> in<00:04:55.940> multi<00:04:56.180> way<00:04:56.300> pots<00:04:56.540> and

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:56.810 
running it twice in multi way pots and

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:58.330 
running it twice in multi way pots and
the<00:04:56.990> dealer<00:04:57.260> was<00:04:57.380> not<00:04:57.560> enforcing<00:04:58.160> this<00:04:58.250> rule

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:58.340 
the dealer was not enforcing this rule

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:59.950 
the dealer was not enforcing this rule
and<00:04:58.640> so<00:04:58.910> there's<00:04:59.330> an<00:04:59.480> implicit<00:04:59.750> understanding

00:04:59.950 --> 00:04:59.960 
and so there's an implicit understanding

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:05.020 
and so there's an implicit understanding
that<00:05:00.860> running<00:05:01.400> it<00:05:01.490> twice<00:05:01.730> is<00:05:02.120> acceptable<00:05:04.030> and

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:05.030 
that running it twice is acceptable and

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:08.500 
that running it twice is acceptable and
this<00:05:05.210> is<00:05:05.330> why<00:05:05.480> when<00:05:05.810> like<00:05:06.350> floor<00:05:06.620> guys<00:05:07.510> are

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:08.510 
this is why when like floor guys are

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:10.570 
this is why when like floor guys are
applying<00:05:09.200> rulings<00:05:09.650> it's<00:05:10.190> not<00:05:10.400> about

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:10.580 
applying rulings it's not about

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:12.160 
applying rulings it's not about
literally<00:05:11.150> like<00:05:11.360> the<00:05:11.600> letter<00:05:11.780> of<00:05:11.930> the<00:05:12.020> law

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:12.170 
literally like the letter of the law

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:13.810 
literally like the letter of the law
sometimes<00:05:12.470> it's<00:05:12.830> about<00:05:12.890> interpretation<00:05:13.730> of

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:13.820 
sometimes it's about interpretation of

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:15.820 
sometimes it's about interpretation of
the<00:05:13.910> situation<00:05:14.030> and<00:05:14.660> using<00:05:15.140> discretion<00:05:15.440> to

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:15.830 
the situation and using discretion to

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:17.290 
the situation and using discretion to
figure<00:05:16.280> out<00:05:16.370> the<00:05:16.430> best<00:05:16.520> route<00:05:16.700> the<00:05:16.940> rest

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:17.300 
figure out the best route the rest

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:20.340 
figure out the best route the rest
ruling<00:05:17.630> and<00:05:17.780> given<00:05:18.140> that<00:05:18.230> we<00:05:18.380> had<00:05:18.560> you<00:05:19.400> know

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:20.350 
ruling and given that we had you know

ruling and given that we had you know
continuously<00:05:21.350> been<00:05:21.650> running<00:05:21.980> it<00:05:22.070> twice<00:05:22.160> and

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:50.690 
very common and that seemed to be the

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:51.850 
very common and that seemed to be the
situation<00:05:50.870> because<00:05:51.290> they<00:05:51.380> were<00:05:51.440> letting<00:05:51.650> us

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:51.860 
situation because they were letting us

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:54.100 
situation because they were letting us
run<00:05:52.190> run<00:05:52.790> through<00:05:53.180> times<00:05:53.390> but<00:05:53.570> then<00:05:53.720> the

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:54.110 
run run through times but then the

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:56.710 
run run through times but then the
moment<00:05:54.440> that<00:05:54.530> it<00:05:54.770> just<00:05:55.310> got<00:05:55.430> has<00:05:55.550> a<00:05:55.580> an<00:05:56.060> edge<00:05:56.300> by

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:56.720 
moment that it just got has a an edge by

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:01.180 
moment that it just got has a an edge by
by<00:05:58.570> enforcing<00:05:59.570> that<00:05:59.600> rule<00:05:59.720> it<00:06:00.470> kind<00:06:00.710> of<00:06:00.740> screws

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:01.190 
by enforcing that rule it kind of screws

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:03.100
