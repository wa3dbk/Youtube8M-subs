00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:17.750 
and quickly the the differences between

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:20.929

grand theft auto san andreas ps2 Xbox
and<00:00:21.240> PC<00:00:21.480> versions<00:00:22.019> the<00:00:22.829> big<00:00:23.039> difference<00:00:23.369> is<00:00:23.519> I

00:00:23.749 --> 00:00:23.759 
and PC versions the big difference is I

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:26.509 
and PC versions the big difference is I
think<00:00:24.169> over<00:00:25.169> the<00:00:25.259> ps2<00:00:25.619> version<00:00:25.650> on<00:00:26.070> the<00:00:26.189> Xbox

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
think over the ps2 version on the Xbox

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.729 
think over the ps2 version on the Xbox
and<00:00:26.640> PC<00:00:26.820> are<00:00:27.210> that<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:28.169> game<00:00:28.320> is<00:00:28.529> that<00:00:28.560> the

00:00:28.729 --> 00:00:28.739 
and PC are that the game is that the

00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:29.599 
and PC are that the game is that the
game<00:00:28.769> looks<00:00:29.159> better

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
game looks better

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.279 
game looks better
first<00:00:29.939> of<00:00:30.060> all<00:00:30.150> visually<00:00:30.539> it<00:00:30.630> looks<00:00:30.779> better<00:00:30.929> it

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
first of all visually it looks better it

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.740 
first of all visually it looks better it
looks<00:00:31.470> a<00:00:31.560> lot<00:00:31.710> better<00:00:31.890> the<00:00:32.820> ps2<00:00:33.239> version<00:00:33.270> never

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
looks a lot better the ps2 version never

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
looks fantastic and that you know a

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.690 
looks fantastic and that you know a
comparative<00:00:36.630> to<00:00:37.140> other<00:00:37.290> games<00:00:37.560> on<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.340> PC<00:00:38.520> in

the xbox neither these versions look
particularly<00:00:40.560> good<00:00:41.010> either<00:00:41.340> but<00:00:41.900> but<00:00:42.900> it

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
particularly good either but but it

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.330 
particularly good either but but it
definitely<00:00:43.470> looks<00:00:43.710> better<00:00:43.860> than<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.190> people

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
definitely looks better than the people

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.430 
definitely looks better than the people
in<00:00:44.490> the<00:00:44.580> ps2<00:00:45.030> version<00:00:45.060> yeah<00:00:45.750> and<00:00:46.050> I<00:00:46.140> would<00:00:46.290> say

in the ps2 version yeah and I would say

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.010 
in the ps2 version yeah and I would say
that<00:00:46.680> in<00:00:46.890> terms<00:00:47.520> of<00:00:47.670> visual<00:00:47.910> quality<00:00:48.030> Lois's

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
that in terms of visual quality Lois's

that in terms of visual quality Lois's
ps2<00:00:49.470> xbox<00:00:50.430> is<00:00:50.580> just<00:00:50.730> slightly<00:00:51.030> higher<00:00:51.180> you

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110

still aliasing it doesn't it's not a
great<00:00:58.200> looking<00:00:58.440> game<00:00:58.620> and<00:00:59.130> then<00:00:59.730> after<00:01:00.420> that

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
to PC games so the PC and the Xbox

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.990 
to PC games so the PC and the Xbox
versions<00:01:16.140> if<00:01:16.500> you<00:01:16.740> look<00:01:16.920> carefully<00:01:17.159> you<00:01:17.490> know

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
versions if you look carefully you know

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.740 
versions if you look carefully you know
you<00:01:18.120> can<00:01:18.450> read<00:01:18.690> things<00:01:19.020> that<00:01:19.140> are<00:01:19.380> like<00:01:19.560> ads<00:01:19.830> an

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
you can read things that are like ads an

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.630 
you can read things that are like ads an
Xbox<00:01:21.750> version<00:01:22.020> it<00:01:22.110> really<00:01:22.350> is<00:01:22.500> this<00:01:22.680> little

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
Xbox version it really is this little

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.149 
Xbox version it really is this little
bit<00:01:23.729> different<00:01:24.120> it's<00:01:24.330> not<00:01:24.420> like<00:01:24.780> wow<00:01:25.620> you<00:01:26.130> know

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
bit different it's not like wow you know

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.510 
bit different it's not like wow you know
it's<00:01:26.430> not<00:01:26.820> like<00:01:26.880> I'm<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:28.010> Grand<00:01:29.010> Theft<00:01:29.100> Auto<00:01:29.220> 3

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
it's not like I'm the Grand Theft Auto 3

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:30.890 
it's not like I'm the Grand Theft Auto 3
and<00:01:29.729> grand<00:01:29.909> theft<00:01:30.030> auto<00:01:30.210> vice<00:01:30.360> city<00:01:30.420> when<00:01:30.810> they

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
and grand theft auto vice city when they

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.360 
and grand theft auto vice city when they
came<00:01:31.020> to<00:01:31.140> Xbox<00:01:31.530> I<00:01:31.680> think<00:01:31.890> that<00:01:32.010> was<00:01:32.100> a<00:01:32.130> big

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:32.370 
came to Xbox I think that was a big

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:34.550 
came to Xbox I think that was a big
significant<00:01:33.060> change<00:01:33.360> in<00:01:33.870> terms<00:01:34.080> of<00:01:34.229> graphic

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
significant change in terms of graphic

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.430 
significant change in terms of graphic
quality<00:01:34.950> over<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:35.970> ps2<00:01:36.420> it's<00:01:36.720> not<00:01:36.990> like<00:01:37.200> that

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:37.440 
quality over the ps2 it's not like that

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.550 
quality over the ps2 it's not like that
big<00:01:37.590> of<00:01:37.710> a<00:01:37.770> jump<00:01:38.700> it's<00:01:39.090> a<00:01:39.420> lot<00:01:39.630> less<00:01:39.840> but<00:01:40.350> the

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
big of a jump it's a lot less but the

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.410 
big of a jump it's a lot less but the
the<00:01:40.799> big<00:01:40.950> difference<00:01:41.490> I<00:01:41.640> think<00:01:41.880> for<00:01:42.060> both<00:01:42.090> of

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
the big difference I think for both of

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.840 
the big difference I think for both of
them<00:01:42.570> as<00:01:42.900> far<00:01:43.140> as<00:01:43.229> graphics<00:01:43.650> goes<00:01:43.890> is<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.670> load

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
them as far as graphics goes is the load

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.910 
them as far as graphics goes is the load
times<00:01:45.120> because<00:01:45.479> they're<00:01:45.920> significantly

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
times because they're significantly

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.219 
times because they're significantly
faster<00:01:47.220> than<00:01:47.640> they<00:01:47.729> are<00:01:47.760> on<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.150> PC<00:01:48.330> yeah<00:01:48.930> I

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
faster than they are on the PC yeah I

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.140 
faster than they are on the PC yeah I
mean<00:01:49.440> on<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:49.650> ps2<00:01:49.920> sorry<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.610> PC<00:01:50.880> is<00:01:51.000> though

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:51.150 
mean on the ps2 sorry the PC is though

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:53.719 
mean on the ps2 sorry the PC is though
is<00:01:51.330> the<00:01:51.450> fastest<00:01:51.869> Xbox<00:01:52.260> is<00:01:52.470> right<00:01:53.130> behind<00:01:53.310> it

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
is the fastest Xbox is right behind it

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.010 
is the fastest Xbox is right behind it
but<00:01:53.909> I<00:01:53.940> mean<00:01:54.119> it's<00:01:54.240> it's<00:01:54.420> really<00:01:54.630> just<00:01:54.720> a<00:01:54.840> blink

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
but I mean it's it's really just a blink

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.539 
but I mean it's it's really just a blink
of<00:01:55.140> an<00:01:55.229> eye<00:01:55.290> on<00:01:55.500> how<00:01:55.590> fast<00:01:55.799> it<00:01:56.010> loads<00:01:56.220> indoor

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
of an eye on how fast it loads indoor

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:57.590 
of an eye on how fast it loads indoor
and<00:01:56.670> outdoor<00:01:56.909> environment<00:01:57.420> and<00:01:57.540> that's

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
and outdoor environment and that's

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.030 
and outdoor environment and that's
pretty<00:01:57.780> impressive<00:01:58.110> considering<00:01:58.560> how<00:01:58.740> huge

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
pretty impressive considering how huge

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.039 
pretty impressive considering how huge
that<00:01:59.250> is<00:01:59.400> the<00:01:59.940> biggest<00:02:00.150> difference<00:02:00.330> for<00:02:00.960> the

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
that is the biggest difference for the

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.390 
that is the biggest difference for the
Xbox<00:02:01.439> version<00:02:01.770> of<00:02:01.860> grand<00:02:02.040> theft<00:02:02.100> auto<00:02:02.310> san

occasionally randomly show up in your

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.509 
occasionally randomly show up in your
soundtrack<00:02:31.560> to<00:02:31.769> make<00:02:31.920> it<00:02:32.040> a<00:02:32.099> little<00:02:32.190> bit<00:02:32.340> more

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:32.519 
soundtrack to make it a little bit more

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:34.940 
soundtrack to make it a little bit more
interesting<00:02:32.970> same<00:02:33.659> on<00:02:33.810> the<00:02:33.900> PC<00:02:34.200> all<00:02:34.500> all<00:02:34.860> the

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
interesting same on the PC all all the

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.170 
interesting same on the PC all all the
same<00:02:35.099> stuff<00:02:35.310> obviously<00:02:35.700> I<00:02:35.730> think<00:02:35.909> it's<00:02:36.150> a

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
same stuff obviously I think it's a

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.600 
same stuff obviously I think it's a
little<00:02:36.390> easier<00:02:36.659> to<00:02:36.690> get<00:02:36.900> to<00:02:37.079> get<00:02:37.799> new<00:02:38.370> songs

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
little easier to get to get new songs

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:39.979 
little easier to get to get new songs
into<00:02:38.879> the<00:02:39.000> PC<00:02:39.269> version<00:02:39.569> because<00:02:39.720> all<00:02:39.840> you<00:02:39.900> have

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
into the PC version because all you have

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:42.170 
into the PC version because all you have
to<00:02:40.049> do<00:02:40.170> is<00:02:40.260> drag<00:02:40.440> and<00:02:40.500> drop<00:02:40.769> into<00:02:41.010> a<00:02:41.069> folder<00:02:41.430> the

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
to do is drag and drop into a folder the

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.330 
to do is drag and drop into a folder the
easiness<00:02:42.450> of<00:02:42.750> dealing<00:02:43.379> with<00:02:43.409> a<00:02:43.500> PC<00:02:43.739> in<00:02:43.950> this<00:02:44.099> in

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
easiness of dealing with a PC in this in

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.190 
easiness of dealing with a PC in this in
this<00:02:44.430> particular<00:02:44.610> case<00:02:45.120> that's<00:02:45.450> faster<00:02:45.930> here

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
this particular case that's faster here

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.839 
this particular case that's faster here
yeah<00:02:46.440> and<00:02:46.739> and<00:02:47.129> that's<00:02:47.310> pretty<00:02:47.519> much<00:02:47.640> the<00:02:47.790> only

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:47.849 
yeah and and that's pretty much the only

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:50.089 
yeah and and that's pretty much the only
difference<00:02:48.239> there<00:02:48.390> I<00:02:48.739> think<00:02:49.739> the<00:02:49.920> biggest

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:50.099 
difference there I think the biggest

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:51.619 
difference there I think the biggest
difference<00:02:50.310> between<00:02:50.640> all<00:02:51.180> three<00:02:51.209> versions

00:02:51.619 --> 00:02:51.629 
difference between all three versions

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:54.380 
difference between all three versions
probably<00:02:52.319> for<00:02:53.099> the<00:02:53.160> PC<00:02:53.549> are<00:02:53.879> the<00:02:53.970> controls

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
probably for the PC are the controls

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.809 
probably for the PC are the controls
obviously<00:02:55.290> for<00:02:56.069> you<00:02:56.280> can<00:02:56.430> plug<00:02:56.670> in<00:02:56.790> a

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 
obviously for you can plug in a

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:59.420 
obviously for you can plug in a
controller<00:02:57.209> if<00:02:57.390> you<00:02:57.480> wish<00:02:57.690> but<00:02:58.560> there's

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
controller if you wish but there's

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:00.920 
controller if you wish but there's
there's<00:02:59.910> definitely<00:03:00.030> some<00:03:00.420> advantages<00:03:00.870> and

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
there's definitely some advantages and

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.479 
there's definitely some advantages and
disadvantages<00:03:01.890> to<00:03:02.010> using<00:03:02.069> the<00:03:02.310> mouse<00:03:02.459> and

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
disadvantages to using the mouse and

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:04.640 
disadvantages to using the mouse and
keyboard<00:03:02.790> you<00:03:03.480> know<00:03:03.540> on<00:03:03.720> the<00:03:03.840> on<00:03:04.140> the<00:03:04.230> consoles

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
keyboard you know on the on the consoles

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.050 
keyboard you know on the on the consoles
you<00:03:04.739> get<00:03:04.859> the<00:03:04.950> lock-on<00:03:05.280> future<00:03:05.640> so<00:03:05.790> you<00:03:05.879> pretty

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
you get the lock-on future so you pretty

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.990 
you get the lock-on future so you pretty
much<00:03:06.150> are<00:03:06.420> automatically<00:03:07.019> hit<00:03:07.290> anybody<00:03:07.709> and<00:03:08.000> I

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
much are automatically hit anybody and I

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.509 
much are automatically hit anybody and I
think<00:03:09.239> the<00:03:09.599> the<00:03:09.769> weapons<00:03:10.769> you<00:03:10.920> go<00:03:11.250> up<00:03:11.370> and

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
think the the weapons you go up and

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:13.160 
think the the weapons you go up and
skill<00:03:11.760> so<00:03:12.030> I<00:03:12.060> actually<00:03:12.329> get<00:03:12.569> more<00:03:12.720> accurate

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
skill so I actually get more accurate

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.309 
skill so I actually get more accurate
over<00:03:13.349> time<00:03:13.560> using<00:03:14.519> that<00:03:14.640> lock-on<00:03:15.000> feature<00:03:15.319> but

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319 
over time using that lock-on feature but

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:17.839 
over time using that lock-on feature but
the<00:03:16.409> PC<00:03:16.739> you<00:03:16.859> can<00:03:16.890> pretty<00:03:17.159> much<00:03:17.250> just<00:03:17.519> target

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:17.849 
the PC you can pretty much just target

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:19.670 
the PC you can pretty much just target
someone<00:03:18.060> in<00:03:18.209> a<00:03:18.269> head<00:03:18.450> almost<00:03:19.019> instantaneous

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
someone in a head almost instantaneous

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:20.949 
someone in a head almost instantaneous
if<00:03:19.829> you've<00:03:19.950> if<00:03:20.220> you've<00:03:20.370> ever<00:03:20.549> played<00:03:20.700> a

shooter<00:03:21.959> with<00:03:22.079> a<00:03:22.109> mouse<00:03:22.319> or<00:03:22.530> anything<00:03:22.739> before

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
shooter with a mouse or anything before

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.569 
shooter with a mouse or anything before
and<00:03:23.450> target<00:03:24.450> blow<00:03:24.660> somebody<00:03:24.959> up<00:03:25.019> or<00:03:25.410> not<00:03:26.370> their

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:26.579 
and target blow somebody up or not their

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:28.009 
and target blow somebody up or not their
head<00:03:26.700> off<00:03:26.819> or<00:03:27.000> whatever<00:03:27.269> extremely

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
head off or whatever extremely

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:33.500 
head off or whatever extremely
efficiently<00:03:29.870> but<00:03:30.870> like<00:03:31.769> the<00:03:32.010> downfall<00:03:32.669> is<00:03:32.970> is

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
efficiently but like the downfall is is

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.349 
efficiently but like the downfall is is
the<00:03:34.019> fact<00:03:34.200> that<00:03:34.730> you<00:03:35.730> have<00:03:35.910> to<00:03:36.030> control<00:03:36.299> the

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:36.359 
the fact that you have to control the

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:38.150 
the fact that you have to control the
car<00:03:36.629> with<00:03:36.810> the<00:03:36.900> Kamau<00:03:37.200> some<00:03:37.410> keyboard<00:03:37.739> as<00:03:37.919> well

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
car with the Kamau some keyboard as well

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.039 
car with the Kamau some keyboard as well
and<00:03:38.700> while<00:03:39.060> it's<00:03:39.209> not<00:03:39.269> bad<00:03:39.569> it's<00:03:39.840> certainly

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:40.049 
and while it's not bad it's certainly

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:41.390 
and while it's not bad it's certainly
not<00:03:40.230> bad<00:03:40.470> and<00:03:40.680> I<00:03:40.769> think<00:03:40.950> it's<00:03:41.069> better<00:03:41.250> than

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
not bad and I think it's better than

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:42.830 
not bad and I think it's better than
Vice<00:03:41.609> City<00:03:41.790> was<00:03:42.060> actually<00:03:42.419> it's<00:03:42.540> a<00:03:42.599> little<00:03:42.810> a

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
Vice City was actually it's a little a

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.869 
Vice City was actually it's a little a
little<00:03:43.049> a<00:03:43.530> little<00:03:43.859> more<00:03:44.010> controlled<00:03:44.459> than<00:03:44.790> it

00:03:44.869 --> 00:03:44.879 
little a little more controlled than it

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:47.030 
little a little more controlled than it
was<00:03:45.060> it's<00:03:46.019> still<00:03:46.199> a<00:03:46.230> lot<00:03:46.440> more<00:03:46.590> difficult<00:03:46.980> than

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
was it's still a lot more difficult than

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.369 
was it's still a lot more difficult than
using<00:03:47.340> the<00:03:47.430> controller<00:03:47.819> so<00:03:48.090> are<00:03:49.079> you<00:03:49.169> saying

00:03:49.369 --> 00:03:49.379 
using the controller so are you saying

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:50.539 
using the controller so are you saying
that<00:03:49.440> you<00:03:49.530> would<00:03:49.650> have<00:03:49.739> prefered<00:03:50.040> having<00:03:50.430> it

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:50.549 
that you would have prefered having it

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:52.909 
that you would have prefered having it
like<00:03:50.699> the<00:03:50.879> controller<00:03:51.269> I<00:03:51.540> think<00:03:52.470> driving<00:03:52.739> I

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:52.919 
like the controller I think driving I

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:54.050 
like the controller I think driving I
would<00:03:53.040> have<00:03:53.129> preferred<00:03:53.400> having<00:03:53.699> it<00:03:53.819> like<00:03:53.940> the

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
would have preferred having it like the

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.089 
would have preferred having it like the
controller<00:03:54.419> but<00:03:54.750> as<00:03:55.199> far<00:03:55.410> as<00:03:55.440> targeting<00:03:55.980> and

00:03:56.089 --> 00:03:56.099 
controller but as far as targeting and

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:57.379 
controller but as far as targeting and
aiming<00:03:56.340> goes<00:03:56.489> I<00:03:56.639> think<00:03:56.819> it's<00:03:56.970> you've<00:03:57.180> got<00:03:57.359> a

00:03:57.379 --> 00:03:57.389 
aiming goes I think it's you've got a

00:03:57.389 --> 00:04:00.650 
aiming goes I think it's you've got a
way<00:03:57.810> better<00:03:58.099> amount<00:03:59.099> of<00:03:59.190> freedom<00:03:59.579> with<00:03:59.970> with

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
way better amount of freedom with with

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:02.780 
way better amount of freedom with with
using<00:04:00.989> the<00:04:01.049> mouse<00:04:01.199> of<00:04:01.379> keyboard<00:04:01.709> yeah<00:04:02.579> the

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
using the mouse of keyboard yeah the

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.000 
using the mouse of keyboard yeah the
last<00:04:03.150> last<00:04:03.540> difference<00:04:04.410> for<00:04:04.590> the<00:04:04.650> PC<00:04:04.980> version
