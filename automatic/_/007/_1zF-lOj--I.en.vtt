then I'm going to go into a little bit
of<00:00:24.249> a<00:00:24.369> close-up<00:00:24.579> so<00:00:24.820> you<00:00:24.880> can<00:00:25.060> see<00:00:25.239> my<00:00:25.449> eye<00:00:25.480> hole

of a close-up so you can see my eye hole
better<00:00:26.380> so<00:00:26.919> for<00:00:27.099> starters<00:00:27.279> the<00:00:27.609> price<00:00:27.819> of<00:00:27.999> this

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:28.119 
better so for starters the price of this

better so for starters the price of this
is<00:00:28.269> three<00:00:28.569> dollars<00:00:28.929> and<00:00:29.289> I<00:00:29.409> think<00:00:29.619> it<00:00:29.710> came<00:00:29.859> out

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:30.039 
is three dollars and I think it came out

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:31.829 
is three dollars and I think it came out
like<00:00:30.189> a<00:00:30.249> month<00:00:30.579> or<00:00:30.789> maybe<00:00:30.939> two<00:00:31.149> months<00:00:31.300> ago<00:00:31.659> now

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:31.839 
like a month or maybe two months ago now

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:35.759 
like a month or maybe two months ago now
and<00:00:32.140> um<00:00:33.100> it<00:00:33.520> looks<00:00:33.790> like<00:00:33.880> this<00:00:34.470> so<00:00:35.470> it's<00:00:35.680> like

00:00:35.759 --> 00:00:35.769 
and um it looks like this so it's like

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:38.189 
and um it looks like this so it's like
about<00:00:36.280> the<00:00:36.430> size<00:00:36.579> of<00:00:36.760> my<00:00:36.910> hand<00:00:37.210> and<00:00:37.840> it's<00:00:38.050> got<00:00:38.170> a

00:00:38.189 --> 00:00:38.199 
about the size of my hand and it's got a

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:42.299 
about the size of my hand and it's got a
very<00:00:38.289> fine<00:00:39.359> tip<00:00:40.359> a<00:00:40.660> very<00:00:41.019> long<00:00:41.289> fine<00:00:41.769> tip<00:00:42.039> but<00:00:42.280> I

00:00:42.299 --> 00:00:42.309 
very fine tip a very long fine tip but I

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:44.040 
very fine tip a very long fine tip but I
don't<00:00:42.489> know<00:00:42.550> if<00:00:42.609> you<00:00:42.699> can<00:00:42.789> see<00:00:43.000> it<00:00:43.120> there<00:00:43.300> I'm

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.439 
don't know if you can see it there I'm
hoping<00:00:44.230> you<00:00:44.469> can<00:00:44.500> see<00:00:45.039> it<00:00:45.160> there<00:00:45.640> is<00:00:45.910> a<00:00:45.940> little

00:00:46.439 --> 00:00:46.449 
hoping you can see it there is a little

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:49.319 
hoping you can see it there is a little
fuzz<00:00:47.140> at<00:00:47.530> the<00:00:47.649> end<00:00:47.800> that<00:00:48.160> I<00:00:48.250> can't<00:00:48.550> get<00:00:48.760> off<00:00:49.000> and

00:00:49.319 --> 00:00:49.329 
fuzz at the end that I can't get off and

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:53.490 
fuzz at the end that I can't get off and
it<00:00:49.690> kind<00:00:49.960> of<00:00:49.989> sucks<00:00:50.199> because<00:00:50.379> it<00:00:50.739> is<00:00:51.420> it<00:00:52.500> makes

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:53.500 
it kind of sucks because it is it makes

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.599 
it kind of sucks because it is it makes
so<00:00:53.679> it's<00:00:53.859> not<00:00:53.980> a<00:00:54.010> very<00:00:54.219> sharp<00:00:54.399> point<00:00:55.050> so<00:00:56.609> the

00:00:57.599 --> 00:00:57.609 
so it's not a very sharp point so the

00:00:57.609 --> 00:01:00.529 
so it's not a very sharp point so the
other<00:00:57.730> thing<00:00:57.999> is<00:00:58.300> that<00:00:58.629> it<00:00:59.019> just<00:00:59.170> doesn't<00:00:59.260> dumb

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539

little bit of black on my hand but it

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.990 
little bit of black on my hand but it
doesn't<00:02:01.550> look<00:02:01.640> very<00:02:01.670> smudgy<00:02:03.520> so<00:02:04.520> that's<00:02:04.700> good

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
doesn't look very smudgy so that's good

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.550 
doesn't look very smudgy so that's good

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:12.970 
and then I'm going to go over the swatch
again<00:02:07.450> and<00:02:08.450> see<00:02:08.960> if<00:02:08.990> it<00:02:10.720> brick<00:02:11.720> falls<00:02:12.590> up<00:02:12.830> or

the<00:02:42.110> very<00:02:42.350> very<00:02:42.620> tip<00:02:42.950> of<00:02:43.010> it<00:02:43.250> just<00:02:43.520> doesn't

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
the very very tip of it just doesn't

with<00:02:47.090> the<00:02:47.240> very<00:02:47.450> great<00:02:47.690> tip<00:02:47.959> and<00:02:48.350> when<00:02:48.709> you<00:02:48.800> do

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
with the very great tip and when you do

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.030 
with the very great tip and when you do
it's<00:02:49.190> a<00:02:49.280> pretty<00:02:49.520> thick<00:02:49.730> line<00:02:50.680> so<00:02:51.680> I'm<00:02:51.740> going<00:02:51.950> to

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
it's a pretty thick line so I'm going to

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.360 
it's a pretty thick line so I'm going to
pull<00:02:52.220> my<00:02:52.490> mirror<00:02:52.730> closer<00:02:53.860> and<00:02:54.860> hopefully<00:02:55.220> not

and trying to show you see it's just

and trying to show you see it's just
it's<00:03:06.290> just<00:03:06.380> it's<00:03:06.620> not<00:03:06.980> a<00:03:07.040> smooth<00:03:07.580> straight

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
it's just it's not a smooth straight

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.810 
it's just it's not a smooth straight
line<00:03:11.230> it's<00:03:12.230> almost<00:03:12.440> like<00:03:12.650> I'm<00:03:13.010> pushing<00:03:13.459> on<00:03:13.700> the

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:13.820 
line it's almost like I'm pushing on the

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:18.280 
line it's almost like I'm pushing on the
tip<00:03:14.030> but<00:03:14.870> the<00:03:15.340> tip<00:03:16.340> bends<00:03:16.730> and<00:03:17.360> then<00:03:18.140> it's

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
tip but the tip bends and then it's

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.880 
tip but the tip bends and then it's
applying<00:03:18.590> product<00:03:19.720> where<00:03:20.720> it<00:03:20.750> bends<00:03:21.350> and<00:03:21.650> not

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:21.890 
applying product where it bends and not

applying product where it bends and not
the<00:03:22.250> tip<00:03:22.489> does<00:03:23.090> that<00:03:23.209> make<00:03:23.390> sense

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
better than that but they said it has a

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.229 
better than that but they said it has a
different<00:04:00.319> tip<00:04:00.610> and<00:04:01.610> I<00:04:01.700> like<00:04:01.849> the<00:04:02.000> formula

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:02.239
