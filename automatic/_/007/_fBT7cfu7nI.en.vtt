00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:05.580
 or for growers let's replicate today 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.830
 the cayena you remember the cayena that 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.480
 pepper variety we sow will 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.269
 put the first program well then 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:15.780
 today we are going to replicate it, we separate the 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:18.900
 seedling with the most root 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.369
 possible it's worth and from here it's going to go to a 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.560
 seedbed the seedbeds can be 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.779
 plastic of porexpÃ¡n of what you have to 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.300
 hand of other crops here you have to 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.010
 receive everything you can and in this 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.590
 what we have is a hotbed of 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.360
 Porexpan trimmed so it does not occupy 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:37.649
 so much space since we do not have so many 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:39.630
 streets we fill it well with a 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.820
 substrate that can be a mixture of a 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:45.660
 universal substrate with a bit of 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.520
 mulch go this taco this this 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.649
 Porexpan tray is a bit small 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.540
 but hey we can use to go out 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.129
 of the step what we will do is then 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:57.230
 transplant the definitely to the 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.230
 planter a little before 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:02.020
 fill in the corners well 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:03.320
 they are usually the most conflictive because 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:06.890
 are 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:09.050
 those that emptier stay for once 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.360
 done this what we do is with a 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:13.440
 knife a stick 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.800
 we make a little hole 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:19.250
 and we began to put the seedlings with 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.250
 little care 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:24.350
 it is getting the seedlings 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:28.549
 with the help of Pablo we put him well 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:31.250
 root and well with this explained I think 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:33.110
 that we can already get 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.080
 if we have a little bit left, he does it to the 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:39.790
 seen it covered it said that with this already 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:43.160
 we can get an economic service 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:45.729
 made from fact with us from the 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.729
 seed 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:54.270
 and we will collect the falls then from here to 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.330
 a couple of months we will start to see how 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:01.370
 produces this this plant in the streets 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:03.730
 so spicy good I will continue 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:03.730
 ah
