00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
for at least the first year I mean it

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.530

should be fairly I wouldn't say easy but
it<00:02:49.750> you<00:02:49.810> should<00:02:50.020> be<00:02:50.140> possible<00:02:50.350> to<00:02:50.650> disguise

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220

this<00:02:51.490> because<00:02:51.880> usually<00:02:52.780> you<00:02:53.080> want<00:02:53.200> to

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.320 
this because usually you want to

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.670 
this because usually you want to

they'll<00:03:08.350> be<00:03:08.470> going<00:03:08.710> this<00:03:08.860> way<00:03:09.100> they're<00:03:09.790> quite

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
they'll be going this way they're quite

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.910

happy no units are in there to further

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.430 
happy no units are in there to further
this<00:03:15.190> if<00:03:15.520> you<00:03:15.670> can<00:03:15.790> have<00:03:15.910> Italy<00:03:16.440> fighting

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
this if you can have Italy fighting

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.960 
this if you can have Italy fighting
France<00:03:20.310> it<00:03:21.310> doesn't<00:03:21.580> look<00:03:21.670> like<00:03:21.700> they're

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970

fighting fat but just that universe

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:25.620 
fighting fat but just that universe
causes<00:03:24.490> a<00:03:24.520> bit<00:03:24.700> of<00:03:24.790> confusion<00:03:24.940> in<00:03:25.330> the<00:03:25.390> French

Austria myself I've never had one I
don't<00:04:19.510> think<00:04:19.840> I<00:04:20.459> would<00:04:21.459> imagine<00:04:21.790> you're<00:04:22.720> going

don't think I would imagine you're going
to<00:04:22.900> have<00:04:23.020> to<00:04:23.140> do<00:04:23.260> something<00:04:23.710> fancy<00:04:24.040> and

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 
to have to do something fancy and

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:29.760 
to have to do something fancy and
towards<00:04:25.720> the<00:04:25.900> end<00:04:26.080> of<00:04:27.780> the<00:04:28.780> first<00:04:29.020> move<00:04:29.260> second

move

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:33.780 
move
and<00:04:30.750> maybe<00:04:32.010> that<00:04:33.010> into<00:04:33.340> there

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:33.790 
and maybe that into there

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:36.420 
and maybe that into there
I<00:04:34.290> don't<00:04:35.290> know<00:04:35.380> build<00:04:35.620> a<00:04:35.710> fleet<00:04:35.920> there<00:04:36.100> I<00:04:36.130> still

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.430 
I don't know build a fleet there I still

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:37.950 
I don't know build a fleet there I still
don't<00:04:36.580> see<00:04:36.670> how<00:04:36.790> it<00:04:37.030> happens<00:04:37.360> actually<00:04:37.510> Here<00:04:37.930> I

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:37.960 
don't see how it happens actually Here I

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:39.480 
don't see how it happens actually Here I
am<00:04:38.050> talking<00:04:38.470> about<00:04:38.500> it<00:04:38.800> but<00:04:38.890> I<00:04:38.950> don't<00:04:39.010> play<00:04:39.310> it

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:39.490 
am talking about it but I don't play it

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:41.250 
am talking about it but I don't play it
I'm<00:04:39.580> just<00:04:39.760> following<00:04:40.390> other<00:04:40.510> people's<00:04:40.870> theory

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:41.260 
I'm just following other people's theory

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.910 
I'm just following other people's theory
I<00:04:42.540> suppose<00:04:43.540> the<00:04:43.690> point<00:04:43.840> is<00:04:44.170> that's<00:04:44.500> with

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:44.920 
I suppose the point is that's with

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:48.030 
I suppose the point is that's with
Austria<00:04:45.310> having<00:04:45.550> a<00:04:45.640> freer<00:04:45.940> hand<00:04:46.620> they<00:04:47.620> can

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:48.040 
Austria having a freer hand they can

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.910 
Austria having a freer hand they can
build<00:04:48.880> and<00:04:49.210> start<00:04:49.960> to<00:04:50.140> threaten<00:04:50.380> Turkey

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:50.920 
build and start to threaten Turkey

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:52.770 
build and start to threaten Turkey
you've<00:04:51.160> got<00:04:51.370> a<00:04:51.400> two-front<00:04:51.850> war<00:04:51.970> against<00:04:52.630> the

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:52.780 
you've got a two-front war against the

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:55.350 
you've got a two-front war against the
turkey<00:04:53.290> and<00:04:53.350> especially<00:04:54.000> following<00:04:55.000> on<00:04:55.240> from

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:55.360 
turkey and especially following on from

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.000 
turkey and especially following on from
what<00:04:55.450> I<00:04:55.600> said<00:04:55.810> earlier<00:04:56.140> of<00:04:56.200> Italy's<00:04:56.620> gone<00:04:56.830> this

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:57.010 
what I said earlier of Italy's gone this

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:58.560 
what I said earlier of Italy's gone this
way<00:04:57.250> and<00:04:57.430> these<00:04:57.520> guys<00:04:57.760> are<00:04:57.790> going<00:04:58.030> to<00:04:58.090> be<00:04:58.240> happy

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:58.570 
way and these guys are going to be happy

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:01.680 
way and these guys are going to be happy
and<00:04:59.320> turkeys<00:04:59.950> looking<00:05:00.370> very<00:05:00.640> alone<00:05:01.090> I<00:05:01.390> guess

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:01.690 
and turkeys looking very alone I guess

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:10.519 
and turkeys looking very alone I guess
that's<00:05:01.960> how<00:05:02.050> you<00:05:02.200> do<00:05:02.410> it

00:05:10.519 --> 00:05:10.529 

00:05:10.529 --> 00:05:12.589
