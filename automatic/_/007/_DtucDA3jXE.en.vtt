00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.920 
because it's really when I heard that as
a<00:01:42.030> kid<00:01:42.299> I<00:01:42.509> am<00:01:43.170> I<00:01:43.820> was<00:01:44.820> shocked<00:01:45.030> me<00:01:45.119> too<00:01:45.270> as<00:01:45.360> a<00:01:45.659> kid

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
a kid I am I was shocked me too as a kid

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.780 
a kid I am I was shocked me too as a kid
when<00:01:46.110> they<00:01:46.470> looked<00:01:46.649> at<00:01:46.680> identical<00:01:47.100> twins<00:01:47.490> and

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
when they looked at identical twins and

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.789 
when they looked at identical twins and
how<00:01:47.909> they<00:01:48.149> changed<00:01:48.570> every<00:01:48.750> seven<00:01:48.990> years<00:01:49.020> it

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
how they changed every seven years it

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:50.929 
how they changed every seven years it
was<00:01:49.979> like<00:01:50.100> a<00:01:50.130> massive<00:01:50.430> study<00:01:50.790> and

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
was like a massive study and

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.340 
was like a massive study and
documentaries<00:01:51.540> released<00:01:51.810> on<00:01:51.930> and<00:01:52.110> all<00:01:52.200> that

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
documentaries released on and all that

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.440 
documentaries released on and all that
so<00:01:52.979> every<00:01:53.640> when<00:01:53.729> I<00:01:53.759> saw<00:01:53.970> that<00:01:54.119> when<00:01:54.299> I<00:01:54.360> was

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
so every when I saw that when I was

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.870 
so every when I saw that when I was
younger<00:01:54.750> I<00:01:54.899> always<00:01:55.350> thought<00:01:55.890> every<00:01:56.460> seven

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
younger I always thought every seven

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.969 
younger I always thought every seven
years<00:01:56.909> I<00:01:57.180> have<00:01:57.479> to<00:01:57.659> make<00:01:57.840> a<00:01:58.049> difference<00:01:58.439> i<00:01:58.829> have

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
years I have to make a difference i have

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.730 
years I have to make a difference i have
to<00:01:59.159> do<00:01:59.399> something<00:01:59.759> to<00:02:00.329> myself<00:02:00.479> or<00:02:01.140> to<00:02:01.200> others

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
to do something to myself or to others

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.700 
to do something to myself or to others
or<00:02:02.159> a<00:02:02.520> positive<00:02:03.450> difference<00:02:03.719> and<00:02:04.229> it's<00:02:04.469> really

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
or a positive difference and it's really

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.920 
or a positive difference and it's really
strange<00:02:05.130> that<00:02:05.909> she's<00:02:06.090> not<00:02:06.180> that<00:02:06.360> strange<00:02:06.630> it

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
strange that she's not that strange it

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.790 
strange that she's not that strange it
seems<00:02:07.439> like<00:02:07.560> a<00:02:07.649> very<00:02:07.680> normal<00:02:08.220> thing<00:02:08.369> to<00:02:08.580> want

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
seems like a very normal thing to want

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.240 
seems like a very normal thing to want
