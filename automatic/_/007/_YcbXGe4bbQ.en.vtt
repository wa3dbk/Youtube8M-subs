00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
our in our weapons and I thought that

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.429 
our in our weapons and I thought that
this<00:02:24.209> would<00:02:24.359> be<00:02:24.480> an<00:02:24.599> awesome<00:02:24.810> way<00:02:25.139> they<00:02:25.290> kind

00:02:25.429 --> 00:02:25.439 
this would be an awesome way they kind

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:26.660 
this would be an awesome way they kind
of<00:02:25.499> show<00:02:25.650> you<00:02:25.680> guys<00:02:25.859> what<00:02:26.189> it<00:02:26.280> would<00:02:26.400> look<00:02:26.609> like

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
of show you guys what it would look like

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.119 
of show you guys what it would look like
if<00:02:27.090> we<00:02:27.269> could<00:02:27.480> get<00:02:27.659> different<00:02:28.129> particular

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:29.129 
if we could get different particular

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:32.030 
if we could get different particular
skins<00:02:29.909> and<00:02:30.239> different<00:02:30.989> camos<00:02:31.319> for<00:02:31.769> our

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
skins and different camos for our

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.379 
skins and different camos for our
weapons<00:02:32.579> I<00:02:32.670> think<00:02:32.849> it<00:02:32.909> would<00:02:33.030> be<00:02:33.120> an<00:02:33.239> awesome

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:33.389 
weapons I think it would be an awesome

00:02:33.389 --> 00:02:35.990 
weapons I think it would be an awesome
idea<00:02:33.920> rockstar<00:02:34.920> would<00:02:35.040> probably<00:02:35.459> make<00:02:35.609> us<00:02:35.790> pay

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
for if you really think about it they

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:39.409 
for if you really think about it they
could<00:02:37.889> probably<00:02:38.069> charge<00:02:38.400> you<00:02:38.489> like<00:02:38.700> so<00:02:39.269> like
