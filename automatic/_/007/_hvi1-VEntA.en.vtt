00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:33.110 
to set up the bottom bar here you can

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:35.200 
to set up the bottom bar here you can
see<00:00:33.230> the<00:00:33.320> way<00:00:33.440> I<00:00:33.469> have<00:00:33.710> laid<00:00:33.950> out<00:00:33.980> this<00:00:34.399> base<00:00:34.640> so

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:35.210 
see the way I have laid out this base so

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:36.970 
see the way I have laid out this base so
that<00:00:35.239> you<00:00:35.450> can<00:00:35.660> have<00:00:35.870> your<00:00:36.050> left<00:00:36.260> hand<00:00:36.440> resting

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:36.980 
that you can have your left hand resting

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.200 
that you can have your left hand resting
on<00:00:37.449> where<00:00:38.449> you're<00:00:38.629> walking<00:00:38.780> the<00:00:39.289> WASD<00:00:40.010> and<00:00:40.310> you

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:41.210 
on where you're walking the WASD and you

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:44.860 
on where you're walking the WASD and you
can<00:00:41.390> quickly<00:00:41.630> access<00:00:42.460> your<00:00:43.460> weapons<00:00:43.880> so<00:00:44.570> if

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 
can quickly access your weapons so if

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:46.690 
can quickly access your weapons so if
anything<00:00:44.960> jumps<00:00:45.590> you<00:00:45.829> you<00:00:45.980> can<00:00:46.160> quickly<00:00:46.370> hit

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:46.700 
anything jumps you you can quickly hit

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.970 
anything jumps you you can quickly hit
the<00:00:46.820> one<00:00:47.030> and<00:00:47.300> still<00:00:47.540> maneuver<00:00:48.050> with<00:00:48.829> your

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:48.980 
the one and still maneuver with your

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.000 
the one and still maneuver with your
other<00:00:49.070> hand<00:00:49.160> as<00:00:49.520> well<00:00:50.170> then<00:00:51.170> any<00:00:51.350> tools<00:00:51.680> going

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.010 
other hand as well then any tools going

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.069 
other hand as well then any tools going
to<00:00:52.070> be<00:00:52.130> set<00:00:52.280> to<00:00:52.309> 5<00:00:52.670> that's<00:00:53.059> usually<00:00:53.630> right<00:00:53.840> put

00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:54.079 
to be set to 5 that's usually right put

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:59.160 
to be set to 5 that's usually right put
them<00:00:54.610> so<00:00:55.610> i<00:00:55.640> keep<00:00:55.850> basically<00:00:56.750> 528<00:00:57.680> as<00:00:58.190> my

00:00:59.160 --> 00:00:59.170 
them so i keep basically 528 as my

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:01.720 
them so i keep basically 528 as my
working<00:01:00.170> tools<00:01:00.739> so<00:01:01.010> you<00:01:01.070> can't<00:01:01.340> have<00:01:01.489> like<00:01:01.700> a

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:01.730 
working tools so you can't have like a

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.600 
working tools so you can't have like a
shovel<00:01:02.180> or<00:01:02.420> pickaxe<00:01:02.899> and<00:01:03.200> then<00:01:03.380> blocks<00:01:03.739> here

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610 
shovel or pickaxe and then blocks here

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.830 
shovel or pickaxe and then blocks here
and<00:01:05.449> on<00:01:05.689> the<00:01:05.990> idea<00:01:06.500> is<00:01:06.860> that<00:01:06.920> number<00:01:07.549> one<00:01:07.840> will

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
and on the idea is that number one will

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.879 
and on the idea is that number one will
be<00:01:08.960> the<00:01:09.200> quickest<00:01:09.590> from<00:01:10.390> w<00:01:11.409> aside<00:01:12.409> from<00:01:12.560> to

00:01:12.879 --> 00:01:12.889 
be the quickest from w aside from to

00:01:12.889 --> 00:01:14.739 
be the quickest from w aside from to
which<00:01:13.579> is<00:01:13.789> the<00:01:13.939> fastest<00:01:14.329> way<00:01:14.389> to<00:01:14.479> heal

00:01:14.739 --> 00:01:14.749 
which is the fastest way to heal

00:01:14.749 --> 00:01:17.080 
which is the fastest way to heal
yourself<00:01:14.869> so<00:01:15.709> if<00:01:15.920> a<00:01:16.009> creeper<00:01:16.369> jumps<00:01:16.729> you<00:01:16.880> you

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
yourself so if a creeper jumps you you

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:18.699 
yourself so if a creeper jumps you you
can<00:01:17.299> quickly<00:01:17.630> hit<00:01:17.929> yourself<00:01:18.079> just<00:01:18.439> by<00:01:18.560> hitting

00:01:18.699 --> 00:01:18.709 
can quickly hit yourself just by hitting

00:01:18.709 --> 00:01:26.139 
can quickly hit yourself just by hitting
to<00:01:19.990> turn<00:01:20.990> that<00:01:21.229> music<00:01:21.560> down<00:01:23.020> and<00:01:24.909> let's<00:01:25.909> see

00:01:26.139 --> 00:01:26.149 
to turn that music down and let's see

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:28.209 
to turn that music down and let's see
here<00:01:26.329> now<00:01:26.689> this<00:01:26.899> is<00:01:27.020> for<00:01:27.170> later<00:01:27.409> no<00:01:28.100> one

00:01:28.209 --> 00:01:28.219 
here now this is for later no one

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:29.440 
here now this is for later no one
wouldn't<00:01:28.490> normally<00:01:28.609> have<00:01:28.880> this<00:01:29.090> out<00:01:29.209> unless
