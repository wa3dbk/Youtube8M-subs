you

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:26.200 

starting<00:03:24.560> off<00:03:24.650> the<00:03:24.770> top<00:03:24.980> I<00:03:25.190> did<00:03:25.340> an<00:03:25.460> X<00:03:25.730> and<00:03:26.060> this

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:26.210 
starting off the top I did an X and this

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:28.210 
starting off the top I did an X and this
helps<00:03:26.570> create<00:03:26.750> your<00:03:27.230> Cupid's<00:03:27.650> bow<00:03:27.890> which<00:03:28.100> is

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
helps create your Cupid's bow which is

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.100 
helps create your Cupid's bow which is
like<00:03:28.370> the<00:03:28.610> M<00:03:28.760> shape<00:03:29.270> at<00:03:29.480> the<00:03:29.570> top<00:03:29.750> of<00:03:29.870> your<00:03:29.930> lip

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:30.110 
like the M shape at the top of your lip

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:32.020 
like the M shape at the top of your lip
some<00:03:30.710> people<00:03:30.950> have<00:03:31.070> it<00:03:31.220> some<00:03:31.250> people<00:03:31.490> don't<00:03:31.670> I

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
some people have it some people don't I

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:33.730 
some people have it some people don't I
really<00:03:32.330> don't<00:03:32.480> have<00:03:32.750> much<00:03:33.050> of<00:03:33.080> a<00:03:33.230> Cupid's<00:03:33.590> bow

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:33.740 
really don't have much of a Cupid's bow

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:35.890 
really don't have much of a Cupid's bow
so<00:03:33.950> I<00:03:33.980> like<00:03:34.220> to<00:03:34.340> exaggerate<00:03:34.880> it<00:03:35.000> a<00:03:35.210> little<00:03:35.720> bit

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
so I like to exaggerate it a little bit

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.170 
so I like to exaggerate it a little bit
by<00:03:36.050> doing<00:03:36.080> the<00:03:36.530> X<00:03:36.740> first<00:03:37.070> and<00:03:37.370> then<00:03:37.850> you'll<00:03:38.030> see

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
by doing the X first and then you'll see

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.120 
by doing the X first and then you'll see
I<00:03:38.210> continue<00:03:38.810> the<00:03:38.930> lines<00:03:39.140> and<00:03:39.410> it<00:03:39.620> helps<00:03:39.950> make

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.130 
I continue the lines and it helps make

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:41.530 
I continue the lines and it helps make
it<00:03:40.280> more<00:03:40.430> defined<00:03:40.760> if<00:03:40.910> you<00:03:41.030> don't<00:03:41.300> want

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
it more defined if you don't want

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.660 
it more defined if you don't want
