 clouds and have a good sky hook for 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:05.979
 moving around the skyline is fundamental 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:10.330

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:13.900

 protected with plastic pieces and 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:31.340
 well here we have I think 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:34.190

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.550

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:55.290
 The arm has different measures for 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:59.590
