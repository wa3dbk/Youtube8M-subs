its<00:04:00.770> class<00:04:00.830> to<00:04:01.670> have<00:04:01.850> this<00:04:02.060> safety<00:04:02.360> feature<00:04:17.170> hi

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:20.080 
its class to have this safety feature hi
and<00:04:18.350> I<00:04:18.530> say<00:04:18.920> that<00:04:19.130> they've<00:04:19.250> had<00:04:19.459> help<00:04:19.790> from<00:04:20.000> the

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.090 
and I say that they've had help from the

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:22.030 
and I say that they've had help from the
engineers<00:04:20.570> at<00:04:20.690> Lotus<00:04:21.140> in<00:04:21.380> developing<00:04:21.860> the

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:22.040 
engineers at Lotus in developing the

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:24.100 
engineers at Lotus in developing the
suspension<00:04:22.700> and<00:04:22.850> ride<00:04:23.210> of<00:04:23.450> the<00:04:23.570> accent

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.110 
suspension and ride of the accent

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:26.200 
suspension and ride of the accent
although<00:04:24.740> to<00:04:24.920> be<00:04:25.100> honest<00:04:25.400> we<00:04:25.580> found<00:04:25.880> after

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:26.210 
although to be honest we found after

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:27.700 
although to be honest we found after
driving<00:04:26.480> on<00:04:26.690> the<00:04:26.780> roads<00:04:26.990> of<00:04:27.170> Scotland<00:04:27.620> the

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:27.710 
driving on the roads of Scotland the

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:29.950 
driving on the roads of Scotland the
ride<00:04:27.890> to<00:04:28.130> be<00:04:28.250> very<00:04:28.610> wallowy<00:04:29.030> and<00:04:29.360> soft<00:04:29.690> and

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 
ride to be very wallowy and soft and

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:44.110 
ride to be very wallowy and soft and
needed<00:04:30.590> to<00:04:30.680> be<00:04:30.800> a<00:04:30.830> lot<00:04:31.160> firmer

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.120 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:47.000 

so<00:04:45.120> although<00:04:45.450> the<00:04:45.750> accent<00:04:46.140> has<00:04:46.290> changed<00:04:46.860> it

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:47.010 
so although the accent has changed it

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:49.010 
so although the accent has changed it
hasn't<00:04:47.400> really<00:04:47.760> altered<00:04:48.210> that<00:04:48.420> much<00:04:48.720> if

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.020 
hasn't really altered that much if

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.530 
hasn't really altered that much if
