00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.379
 the new era games playstation games 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:09.120
 3 playstation 4 and xbox one in media 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:10.740
 digital 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.240
 And you guys , youtube is very well. 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.849
 There is already a video of the visual here in the 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.379
 channel and it was not the video for me today. 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.160
 talk about few subjects here that I 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.539
 I separated 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.330
 You saw that I stayed a while without 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.310
 matter is that I was kind of 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.320
 will without subject to visit here 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.050
 so I preferred not to do what to do 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.029
 You know what I mean? 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.160
 of notes that I placed in my area 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.230
 type of work with the suggestions that 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.630
 You always give me know in the comments. 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.129
 You think I do not see but I always do. 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.260
 Write down what you want 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.440
 and then I came here that a lot of people were 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.120
 asking to do a rc in the strategy of 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.680
 talk about sensitivity 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.210
 so you look like you came here to talk 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.160
 on these two topics 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.750
 then before you think that 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.030
 find something nothing happened 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.430
 simply because I was not 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.770
 asking from the way thrashed that Brazil 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.750
 took 17 Jan to play because 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.449
 I did not feel like bringing 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.739
 videos so I'm back here and I 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.020
 I'll try to bring more in the measure of 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.570
 possible, who are we then let's see how 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.510
 I'm here talking about sensitivity 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:16.290
 that use in the code time explains to you 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:18.659
 Why is it all so let's go is good 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.000
 you know that in the code 41 modern 2 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.970
 instability ranges from 1 to 10 and 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.130
 almost there are advanced or the youngest 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.920
 goes from 11 to 15 and most probably the 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:32.490
 advanced refers also goes from 11 to 15 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:34.320
 but the fact is that the sensitivity of more 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.210
 high does not mean to play better 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.659
 means to have a little reflex time 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.070
 greater then yes what is time reflex is for 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.570
 example if a guy behind you and you 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.570
 can give a tournament with more 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.369
 ease and this is a fact is easier 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.920
 you become a guy when you have a 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.990
 sensitivity but it's a lot 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.880
 people confuse with high sensitivity with 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.740
 play better and there are people who, for example 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.600
 plays in the always there to whom it directs 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.070
 once you do not face you have to stop 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.770
 from his head and played with the 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:04.200
 activity that is most comfortable for you 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.360
 know no use not suffer her to stay 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.979
 dying gets negative all the time only 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.840
 by the fact that Vitor saw youtube is 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:12.180
 played in the sensibility such that to play 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.470
 same sensitivity he will not do 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.590
 It's just you. 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:19.260
 playing is fine with your sensitivity because 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.570
 you feel so comfortable that the 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.930
 trailers play with sensitivity three 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:26.580
 four and up to five so it is a 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.290
 The more sensitivity you have 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.140
 stability in the sights 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.980
 they play with regular organs then it is 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.050
 obvious that they have to have a 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:37.710
 stability and visibility in the media 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:39.000
 is lower and the risk of closing down 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:41.130
 the shots 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.810
 the risk of 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.430
 put your finger on the lord, do not you think 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.630
 your family however on the other hand knows 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.070
 Why do you have to hit one? 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.850
 large sequence of shots to kill the 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:50.070
 enemy 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:51.510
 so everything has an explanation for us 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:53.790
 We're on the dam, we play with the 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:56.820
 feeling a bit higher because 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.770
 because we need to give sorry 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.840
 low sensitivity coopcom drags 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:03.630
 It just does not work, it 's difficult. 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:06.000
 and so I think yes you have to 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:08.060
 play as much as possible is for you 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.550
 is playing well because people play 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:13.050
 For example, the sensitivity is six 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:15.750
 You're not going to play well because you do not. 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:17.550
 You will be able to cope with 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.650
 accuracy in Brazil will need a lot of 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:20.880
 precision snow has to give a scope 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.459
 accurate in the face 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:27.120
 so the advice you play through 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:29.940
 least one of the youngest bodies of 10 to 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:34.140
 and the older codices is almost 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:35.850
 40 227 Up, there you go. 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.410
 to give a training for example the enemy 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:40.560
 if you have back you can turn around 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:42.150
 everything and if you have andrÃ© sorry no 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.530
 will influence so much of course that you 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.650
 will have to adapt to the time of your 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:48.030
 gun but of course this is for those who play in the 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.160
 team is normal so now who gives 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:52.080
 shock and about another 500 eu 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.570
 I advise you to play in the most sensitive 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:57.299
 high because the focus of your 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:59.310
 gameplay is spinning do not do a few pirouettes 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:01.470
 so I think you have to play 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:04.620
 reality a little higher now 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:05.519
 Let's talk about the sc that is the team that 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:09.810
 I own 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:12.090
 we opened a rc last week and 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:13.320
 receive this until August 1 because 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:14.280
 Do not know that you constantly receive 

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:16.470
 chances 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.780
 So we had and made a challenge to 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:20.729
 who wants to join the team at a 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:22.890
 good opportunity for you is I go 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:24.330
 leave the video here in the description I was going 

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:25.680
 make a video talking about this 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.200
 subject but I think it's a very 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.000
 little 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:29.680
 do not stop giving just one 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.130
 Citadin anyway 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:35.200
 As I said then I left the application 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:37.870
 for more information you have 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:40.360
 It's only you who doubts that you 're here. 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:42.490
 Any questions on this one on my channel on this 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:45.220
 My video because there I respond directly 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:47.740
 Why are you there cats? 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:50.020
 a routine there then it's not every day that 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:51.640
 I'm getting in there and I'm not active there. 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:53.290
 How much I am here on the channel are very 

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:55.060
 more active then if you have 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:56.980
 Do you have any questions? 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:58.720
 I wanted to ask is it just you to go there in my 

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:00.250
 twitter next to subscription too 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.960
 they asked here on campus 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:03.520
 even comments you know 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:06.340
 So I answer all the comments. 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:08.320
 world and this is it people are not 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:11.320
 forget, do not forget, sorry for 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:13.570
 leave suggestions here it is hard for me 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:15.550
 This is very important because there I know 

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:18.670
 What do you want to know, for example? 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:20.530
 you asked for the noodle shop tip 23 

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:23.050
 almost nude region from here the two asked 

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:24.940
 mintegi spin live comment ask for one 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:26.860
 video with my girlfriend and all that 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:29.800
 come on the channel are things that you 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:32.920
 ask the participants to speak with 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:35.320
 on face and these things know is everything 

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:37.960
 You ask me, then I would like you 

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:39.490
 do not give up so you know if this 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:41.590
 Suggested stop because it is very much 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:44.680
 Good for me and I really like 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:46.080
 interact with you and I wanted to ask 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:49.210
 also for you follow me on twitter 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:51.100
 because this week 

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:54.220
 I do not know if you remember I made a video 

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:56.200
 of anpad with the registrants and to 

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:59.130
 this video ask you to leave the 

00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:01.750
 gamers tags there in the comment such and such 

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:03.190
 both people quite let and it happens 

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:05.380
 Last week I went to do another one. 

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:06.910
 episode of that and I went to call the 

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:09.700
 people who were in a comment 

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:10.840
 only that many were to the fla and such then 

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:12.310
 I wanted to ask you to follow me on 

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:14.380
 twitter can happen if I want 

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:17.620
 make video with you subscribed 

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:19.360
 both are already aware of right and type in 

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:22.060
 is an easier thing to do than to 

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:23.530
 I live, yes, I know, it kind of posted, if you already 

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:26.110
 they saw nothing like youtube you have to 

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:27.940
 there in my video, and it's not the same 

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:29.710
 thing they did then if you have 

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:32.440
 opportunity not twitter if you have not 

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:34.630
 also creates real quick and come after me there is 

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:36.490
 also sign up and visit the stores 

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:37.020
 also video code discount the image of 

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:38.910
 control 

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:41.039
 James, I'm going to stay here a hug 

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:41.490

00:06:41.039 --> 00:06:43.879
 video 

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:43.879
 went
