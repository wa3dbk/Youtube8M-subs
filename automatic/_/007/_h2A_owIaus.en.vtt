 help colleague he pushed off the curb 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:08.430

 there was nobody but the attraction was 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.900
 non-dangerous considers the author of this venture 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:33.480
 because it happened on a flat 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.250
 somewhere in the desert roller already 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.530

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.040
 saying 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:43.410
 and in Russian our compatriots 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:48.209
 note that this tractor is not exactly 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:50.819
 Belarusian unusual accident happened in 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:53.130

 they say that animals crossed the road 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.930
 on red light and no one whether to harass 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:03.600
 managed to slow down 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:06.150
 us nomads on a passenger car mare fell but 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:08.819

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.680
 ran away and no one was hurt on the door 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:12.900
 car left a deep dent 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:15.780
 similar happens in other cities 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:18.120
 Russia recently in Perm horse which 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:20.280

 passersby as a result of one of the women 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:25.890
 turned loophole 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:28.350
 this is an australian cyclist who 

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:30.780
 filmed my trip is unlikely 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:31.800
 suspected that in the end she would fix 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:36.560
 own accident 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:36.560
 yes even a woman shot down a kangaroo 

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:46.510
 the cyclist flew off to another 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:48.970
 side of the road and could not even get up 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:51.160
 independently helped her passing 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:53.110
 by the drivers as the woman wrote in 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:56.230
 comments on the video on her foot imposed 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:59.920
 8 stitches but the culprit left the accident 

00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:02.230
 place of the accident one of the most popular 

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:04.570
 beaches on the south coast of australia 

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:06.850
 had to close after in 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:09.220
 the Internet has got this video by its author 

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:11.380
 and fishermen who went fishing 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:13.750
 saw a great white shark in the water 

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:15.970
 very close to those places where often 

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:18.430
 people have a rest 5 meter sea 

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:20.650
 the predator did not attack the boat but with 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:23.020
 swimmers or scuba divers such 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:25.180
 fishes usually behave very 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:26.920
 aggressively until local authorities have not 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:28.900
 there will be confidence that the shark 

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:31.600
 moved to another place the beach 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:33.940
 will remain closed but it happens like this 

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:35.740
 even closer contact with the shark for 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:37.800
 the guy who shot this video by the way 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:40.360
 too in australia it was all over 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:42.010
 painful bite true bloggers 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:45.070
 believe that he himself is to blame 

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:48.630
 harpoon finger predator for underwater 

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:48.630
