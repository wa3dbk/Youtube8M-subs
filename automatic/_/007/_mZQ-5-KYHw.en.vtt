00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.769
 If you look at the night sky in any direction, beyond the stars and other stars and galaxies 

00:00:04.769 --> 00:00:09.180
 and galaxy superclusters ... you will see a light that has been traveling for 13.7 thousand 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:13.780
 Millions of years before reaching Earth. It is the oldest and most fundamental light of the Universe, one 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:19.060
 The image of our cosmos in its younger and hotter years, and called the "Radiation of funds." 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.970
 In fact, you can not see this light in the naked eye, why it is 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:27.199
 to the microwave band of the electromagnetic spectrum. But it is visible to radios and radio telescopes, 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:31.050
 and even resonable from the "snow" of an analog TV. 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.109
 Where does this light background come from? Well, just after the Big Bang, everything 

00:00:35.109 --> 00:00:39.399
 The Universe was still so small that it had to be very dense, hot-tempered, and how 

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:44.059
 He had not had enough time to be grumpy and not uniform, he had to be deliciously gentle. 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:47.760
 For a moment, everything had been so suffocating, that the electrons had not settled as part 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.760
 of atoms or molecules, otherwise they would freely wander in a sort of hot soup. In this soup 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.899
 There was a lot of light bouncing in it, dispersed by electrons and protons 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:58.869
 such as in a room of mirrors or in the interior of the Sun. 

00:00:58.869 --> 00:01:02.309
 But, as the Universe expanded, there was less and less energy available to anybody 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.440
 place And when everything had cooled just below the sun's temperature, the pairs of 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.000
 Protons and electrons no longer had enough energy to avoid each other and fell 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.310
 In the electromagnetic embrace we call the hydrogen atom. These electrons were so stuck 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.500
 for his love of the protons that began to ignore the whole light 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.110
 which spun around her. Therefore, with less free electrons to interact with light, 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.120
 suddenly the universe became transparent, and all the trapped light left in the direction 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:29.740
 in which he went after his last dispersion, condemned to travel alone and inadvertently 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.530
 for the cosmos Until he stumbles on a solid thing ... 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.960
 When we finally see her here on Earth, this light has been stretched so much by the expansion of space 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:43.770
 For thirteen thousand million years, what, like a slow recording, its frequency and color had shifted 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.240
 from original solar white to cold microwaves. That is why it is often called 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.090
 the "Radiation of microwave backgrounds", or CMB. And in the same way they can know the temperature 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.320
 from a red or white to red red in its brightness, this light tells us the temperature of space 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:02.600
 Empty: currently around 2,725 Kelvin degrees, or less 270 degrees Celcius. 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:08.289
 But the universe is not exactly 2,725 Kelvin in all directions ... if we look at it better, 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:12.379
 There are small bumps, seemingly random but detectable, everywhere, a bit like in milk 

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:16.859
 which begins to crawl. Our best explanation is that these cosmic lumps were formed as fluctuations 

00:02:16.859 --> 00:02:21.129
 Quantum in a young, otherwise creamy universe, which began to coagulate while 

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:25.239
 the universe cooled and expanded. It is difficult to exaggerate how small, or 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:29.409
 Not rough, these fluctuations of temperature and density were at the beginning - the zones 

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:33.529
 Hot or cold were hotter or colder than their surroundings in a factor of one part each 

00:02:33.529 --> 00:02:37.599
 One hundred-thousand - this is equivalent to realizing that a bacterium makes a larger beach ball. 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:41.480
 While these initial groupings of the Universe give rise to small variations like those 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.889
 we see at the WBC, later the grunts of the main soup are drawn gravitely among them, 

00:02:46.889 --> 00:02:50.549
 and finally they will be coagulated and will be united to give rise to all the structures with mass of 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:55.239
 The universe we see today, such as planets, stars, galaxies and galaxy superclusters. 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:58.680
 Therefore, when we look at the night sky beyond the galaxies and see the ancient light of 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.129
 The radiation of mircoon bottoms, literally we saw the starting point, the cream 

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:07.810
 proverbial, if you want, from which the qualls of the Universe coagulate. Or more 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:13.040
 simple, it shows that the Moon is really made of cheese. 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.909
 To give you a more complete experience of how incredible is background radiation 

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:21.650
 We have made an ADVENTURE map! Representing it as if it were the non-terrestrial geography of one of the worlds 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.909
 of your favorite series - except it really is the first photograph of our Universe 

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:30.309
 when i was a child We have added to the map images of constellations and galaxies, and we have overlay it 

00:03:30.309 --> 00:03:34.049
 how is the sky in the infrared? And if you are an imperial being, you can help give name 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:38.689
 to the oceans and mountains of our map. Go to bigbangregistry.com to start exploring!
