00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:12.780
 Hello and welcome here 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.859
 are includes hardware and software 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.940
 Driving today before driving in the 

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:21.150
 tutorial series how do I build a home 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.580
 server itself or a pc in general with 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:27.930
 installing a cpu cooler for 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:32.790
 the CPU in the case of an instinct 860 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:35.940
 for the 11 55 sock comes in this case 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.399
 We are intensively involved with the city 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.219
 use for it was all the more so now 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:44.640
 For example, no york rock per 2 or so 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.260
 of feed, the second all the 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.340
 system somewhat quieter but contributes 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:53.520
 this cpu with 65 watts is the first 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:56.520
 relevant here then we have the 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:01:00.350
 appropriate cooling with a fit 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:04.019
 pwm connection and already applied 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:06.180
 thermally conductive paste as you this cpu or 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.939
 at the same time it is up to you 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.760
 I think that's very nice with his 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:15.060
 is better if you now the intel 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.320
 logo align so that the whole thing 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.549
 looks like if you're on top of it now 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:22.380
 so would have the 2 and then have 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.270
 Here are these push pins four pieces and 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.850
 here are the holes over there 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:31.170
 here and there and now judge now 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:34.439
 just so we push the four 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.780
 Align pins a few holes and then 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:40.820
 from the top of that just push down 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:43.350
 I would have turned the whole mainzers 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.990
 and most importantly always about it 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.820
 Cross suppress these push pins 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.340
 so that does not drive away the whole and 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.810
 Although clearly the first and you 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.930
 you heard it all clicked 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.930
 made 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:04.880
 lift up so that's already done 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:09.020
 that also the on and now we have 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:10.790
 here still the fourth air connection the 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.820
 of course also need to install 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:16.130
 and we have the back here then the 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:18.410
 4 pin connection for this fan him 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:21.200
 we just stick to it and just have to 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:24.080
 still note that the fan cable is here 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.700
 not sticking out in your fan 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.130
 and then there is already installation 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:31.640
 a cpu cooler are also the in 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:33.740
 the box set cooler closed and 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.260
 then, in that case, this should be for this 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:37.940
 have been part I thank you for 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.070
 I would like to comment on that 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:43.100
 evaluation and looking forward to the newsletter 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:45.140
 Of course, even if you are next time 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:51.160
 Again, be the next part 4 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:51.160
 then and yes then stop in today around
