00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:30.980 
zombies or on transit modes get addendum

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.010 
zombies or on transit modes get addendum
to<00:00:31.160> follow<00:00:31.399> you<00:00:31.579> to<00:00:31.849> a<00:00:31.880> turned<00:00:32.210> on<00:00:32.419> one<00:00:32.660> post

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:33.020 
to follow you to a turned on one post

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:35.610 
to follow you to a turned on one post
and<00:00:33.350> it<00:00:34.220> will<00:00:34.310> put<00:00:34.460> it<00:00:34.579> into<00:00:34.760> the<00:00:35.000> ground<00:00:35.180> and

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:35.620 
and it will put it into the ground and

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.900 
and it will put it into the ground and
Mirka<00:00:36.620> teleporter<00:00:37.220> because<00:00:37.430> I'll<00:00:37.550> just<00:00:37.579> jump

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:37.910 
Mirka teleporter because I'll just jump

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:39.780 
Mirka teleporter because I'll just jump
off<00:00:38.090> your<00:00:38.239> head<00:00:38.390> and<00:00:38.540> bury<00:00:38.899> into<00:00:39.079> the<00:00:39.260> ground

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:39.790 
off your head and bury into the ground

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:42.310 
off your head and bury into the ground
basically<00:00:40.790> you<00:00:41.180> do<00:00:41.329> this<00:00:41.510> by<00:00:41.750> turning<00:00:41.809> on<00:00:42.290> the

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:42.320 
basically you do this by turning on the

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.110 
basically you do this by turning on the
electricity<00:00:42.829> usually<00:00:43.520> but<00:00:43.760> this<00:00:43.790> is<00:00:44.090> a

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:44.120 
electricity usually but this is a

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.900 
electricity usually but this is a
tutorial<00:00:44.570> on<00:00:44.780> how<00:00:44.899> to<00:00:45.079> do<00:00:45.290> it<00:00:45.320> differently<00:00:45.910> so

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:46.910 
tutorial on how to do it differently so

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:48.580 
tutorial on how to do it differently so
what<00:00:47.210> you<00:00:47.300> want<00:00:47.420> to<00:00:47.450> do<00:00:47.600> is<00:00:47.780> make<00:00:47.990> a<00:00:48.020> turbine

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:48.590 
what you want to do is make a turbine

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:50.830 
what you want to do is make a turbine
push<00:00:49.040> it<00:00:49.220> down<00:00:49.460> next<00:00:49.700> to<00:00:49.850> the<00:00:50.000> a<00:00:50.240> ramp<00:00:50.600> or

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:50.840 
push it down next to the a ramp or

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.230 
push it down next to the a ramp or
stinger<00:00:51.320> you<00:00:51.530> get<00:00:52.100> a<00:00:52.130> dungeon<00:00:52.550> a<00:00:52.700> jump<00:00:52.940> on<00:00:53.090> your

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:53.240 
stinger you get a dungeon a jump on your

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.770 
stinger you get a dungeon a jump on your
head<00:00:53.390> and<00:00:53.690> then<00:00:53.780> go<00:00:54.350> to<00:00:54.410> a<00:00:54.950> lamppost<00:00:55.940> it'll

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:56.780 
head and then go to a lamppost it'll

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.510 
head and then go to a lamppost it'll
jump<00:00:56.960> off<00:00:57.140> your<00:00:57.260> head<00:00:57.410> burn<00:00:57.800> into<00:00:57.950> ground<00:00:58.310> and

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:58.520 
jump off your head burn into ground and

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.250 
jump off your head burn into ground and
make<00:00:58.610> a<00:00:58.640> teleporter<00:00:59.270> and<00:00:59.810> you<00:00:59.960> just<00:01:00.050> wanna

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 
make a teleporter and you just wanna

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:01.960 
make a teleporter and you just wanna
pick<00:01:00.380> up<00:01:00.530> to<00:01:00.740> a<00:01:00.770> bearing<00:01:01.190> jump<00:01:01.460> into<00:01:01.820> the

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:01.970 
pick up to a bearing jump into the

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:03.880 
pick up to a bearing jump into the
teleporter<00:01:02.470> teleport<00:01:03.470> you<00:01:03.590> somewhere

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:03.890 
teleporter teleport you somewhere

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.850 
teleporter teleport you somewhere
randomly<00:01:04.460> which<00:01:04.640> has<00:01:04.879> a<00:01:04.909> lamppost<00:01:05.509> is<00:01:06.470> keep

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 
randomly which has a lamppost is keep

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.859 
randomly which has a lamppost is keep
repeating<00:01:07.159> this<00:01:07.430> process<00:01:07.490> until<00:01:08.270> you<00:01:08.420> get<00:01:08.720> to

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:08.869 
repeating this process until you get to

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:12.069 
repeating this process until you get to
the<00:01:08.990> place<00:01:09.799> where<00:01:09.829> the<00:01:10.340> town<00:01:10.549> is<00:01:10.720> well<00:01:11.720> this<00:01:11.900> is

00:01:12.069 --> 00:01:12.079 
the place where the town is well this is

00:01:12.079 --> 00:01:13.810 
the place where the town is well this is
a<00:01:12.110> recommended<00:01:12.710> strategy<00:01:13.159> anyway<00:01:13.430> for<00:01:13.640> round

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820 
a recommended strategy anyway for round

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.200 
a recommended strategy anyway for round
one<00:01:14.090> so<00:01:14.810> what<00:01:15.350> this<00:01:15.829> strategy<00:01:16.310> is<00:01:16.520> is<00:01:16.820> keep

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
one so what this strategy is is keep

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.210 
one so what this strategy is is keep
teleporting<00:01:18.020> until<00:01:18.470> you<00:01:18.590> get<00:01:18.770> to<00:01:18.890> the<00:01:18.979> town

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 
teleporting until you get to the town

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.149 
teleporting until you get to the town
area<00:01:19.490> run<00:01:20.180> into<00:01:20.450> the<00:01:20.570> town<00:01:20.810> running<00:01:21.800> to<00:01:22.040> the

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:22.159 
area run into the town running to the

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:24.280 
area run into the town running to the
bank<00:01:22.340> open<00:01:23.000> the<00:01:23.090> barrel<00:01:23.510> and<00:01:23.720> then<00:01:23.840> withdraw

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.290 
bank open the barrel and then withdraw

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.590 
bank open the barrel and then withdraw
whatever<00:01:24.650> points<00:01:25.130> you<00:01:25.250> have<00:01:25.370> stored<00:01:25.760> in<00:01:26.330> this

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
whatever points you have stored in this

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.580 
whatever points you have stored in this
video<00:01:26.990> I<00:01:27.380> had<00:01:27.740> to<00:01:27.920> store<00:01:28.190> like<00:01:29.409> 10,000<00:01:30.409> or

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
video I had to store like 10,000 or

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.219 
video I had to store like 10,000 or
11,000<00:01:31.490> points<00:01:31.880> which<00:01:32.450> is<00:01:32.479> pretty<00:01:32.900> sick<00:01:33.200> to

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229 
11,000 points which is pretty sick to

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:35.500 
11,000 points which is pretty sick to
start<00:01:33.620> off<00:01:33.740> with<00:01:33.979> one<00:01:34.130> on<00:01:34.340> one<00:01:34.610> you<00:01:34.850> know<00:01:35.299> what

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:35.510 
start off with one on one you know what

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:37.450

you<00:01:35.600> want<00:01:35.750> to<00:01:35.840> do<00:01:35.960> is<00:01:36.260> you<00:01:36.470> can<00:01:36.620> either<00:01:36.710> run<00:01:37.130> to

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
you want to do is you can either run to

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.539 
you want to do is you can either run to
electricity<00:01:38.390> turn<00:01:38.990> it<00:01:39.170> on<00:01:39.320> and<00:01:39.620> then<00:01:39.979> so<00:01:40.340> it's

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:40.549 
electricity turn it on and then so it's

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:42.460 
electricity turn it on and then so it's
not<00:01:40.670> hassle<00:01:41.090> about<00:01:41.240> putting<00:01:41.840> down<00:01:41.960> you<00:01:42.049> to<00:01:42.229> buy

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
recommend doing is setting up the

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.840 
recommend doing is setting up the

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
electricity and then set it up the
