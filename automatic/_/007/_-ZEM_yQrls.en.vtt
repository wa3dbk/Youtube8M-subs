00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 and how are these sections going to be 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.790
 a new section if they like it and 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.410
 Here I will teach you how to recycle your 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.269
 clothes or things they have for 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.309
 reuse them in more modern things or 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.559
 more beautiful in this first video I'm going 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:16.859
 to teach how to transform a shirt 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:19.470
 in a bag and everything we need 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:22.109
 It is a beach that no longer use a 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.480
 scissors a safety first thing we go 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:37.200
 to do is cut the sleeves just 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:39.180
 at the height of the seams of that 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.040
 T-shirt is going to stay like this now to make 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.719
 the opening we are going to cut on the 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.120
 line of the neck that is on this side 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.559
 so that it is couples we are also going to 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:56.579
 cut this culture so you do not 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:58.350
 downloaded and now you're going to locate the 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.260
 hem on the bottom of your 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:04.070
 shirt and you're going to cut an opening without 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.350
 get to the seam 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.240
 now let's cut out a strip of cloth 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.850
 of which we have left has to be 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.340
 a long strip since we have it we are going to 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.440
 put the clip on one end and then 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:18.710
 let's put it through the hem that 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:20.479
 we open and we will continue carrying it 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:28.369
 inwards pushing the fabric of the 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:30.200
 shirt for back we keep doing 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:32.990
 taste until we get my clip out 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.729
 on the other side of the hem once 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.560
 we have done it we are going to push the web 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:38.460
 back to make it down as 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.560
 wrinkled 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.119
 we are going to try that the two strips that 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.890
 give the same size for the case 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.900
 next now you are going to make a new 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.750
 triple to ensure all the part of 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.909
 below your bag you will not get a 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.040
 Once you are done, you will have two 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.960
 strips through the middle part of the ojito 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.780
 below and you're going to do a 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.580
 knot since you finished with this you can 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.710
 make a little bow on the inside so that 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.360
 look cuter you can cut both 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.360
 keels so you do not have receipt and 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.759

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.800
 a shirt if they fit all are 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.390
 super parents and it's a super father way 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.519
