00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
needn't we've been on our past defense

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.160 
needn't we've been on our past defense
or<00:02:49.700> on<00:02:49.850> you<00:02:50.390> know<00:02:50.480> I<00:02:50.510> thought<00:02:50.660> we'd<00:02:50.870> be<00:02:50.959> a<00:02:50.989> lot

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
or on you know I thought we'd be a lot

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:52.900 
or on you know I thought we'd be a lot
better<00:02:51.230> we<00:02:51.680> gave<00:02:51.830> up<00:02:51.980> quite<00:02:52.190> a<00:02:52.220> few<00:02:52.459> yards

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
better we gave up quite a few yards

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.270 
better we gave up quite a few yards
didn't<00:02:53.150> give<00:02:53.239> them<00:02:53.330> any<00:02:53.480> rushing<00:02:53.840> yards<00:02:54.280> but

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
didn't give them any rushing yards but

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.490 
didn't give them any rushing yards but
we<00:02:55.459> gave<00:02:55.640> up<00:02:55.670> a<00:02:55.820> good<00:02:56.090> bit<00:02:56.239> on<00:02:56.390> on<00:02:56.630> past<00:02:57.050> offense

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
we gave up a good bit on on past offense

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.590 
we gave up a good bit on on past offense
so<00:02:57.709> I'm<00:02:58.160> a<00:02:58.220> little<00:02:58.340> concerned<00:02:58.580> with<00:02:58.910> that<00:02:59.090> and

00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.600 
so I'm a little concerned with that and

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.210 
so I'm a little concerned with that and
then<00:02:59.810> we've<00:02:59.989> got<00:03:00.110> to<00:03:00.230> clean<00:03:00.410> up<00:03:00.440> some<00:03:00.560> blocking

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
then we've got to clean up some blocking

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.130 
then we've got to clean up some blocking
schemes<00:03:01.489> and<00:03:01.850> if<00:03:02.180> we<00:03:02.270> can<00:03:02.420> do<00:03:02.540> that<00:03:02.720> I'll<00:03:03.020> be

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
schemes and if we can do that I'll be

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:04.600 
schemes and if we can do that I'll be
pleased<00:03:03.350> with<00:03:03.470> what<00:03:03.650> we're<00:03:03.800> doing<00:03:03.830> one<00:03:04.430> row

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:04.610 
pleased with what we're doing one row

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:06.430 
pleased with what we're doing one row
has<00:03:05.000> an<00:03:05.180> exceptional<00:03:05.780> quarterback<00:03:06.200> throws

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
has an exceptional quarterback throws

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.680 
has an exceptional quarterback throws
the<00:03:06.560> ball<00:03:06.680> extremely<00:03:06.950> well<00:03:07.250> and<00:03:07.940> they've<00:03:08.480> got

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
the ball extremely well and they've got

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:10.090 
the ball extremely well and they've got
a<00:03:08.720> couple<00:03:08.959> of<00:03:09.140> receivers<00:03:09.680> that<00:03:09.830> I<00:03:09.890> thought

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.100 
a couple of receivers that I thought

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.190 
a couple of receivers that I thought
were<00:03:10.250> very<00:03:10.280> skillful

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
were very skillful

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.380 
were very skillful
so<00:03:12.800> we<00:03:12.980> have<00:03:13.250> some<00:03:13.730> different<00:03:13.850> things<00:03:14.150> on

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
so we have some different things on

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:16.210 
so we have some different things on
defense<00:03:14.810> to<00:03:14.900> contain<00:03:15.200> those<00:03:15.350> three<00:03:15.620> guys<00:03:15.770> I

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
defense to contain those three guys I

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:17.500 
defense to contain those three guys I
thought<00:03:16.430> we<00:03:16.580> were<00:03:16.730> much<00:03:16.940> better<00:03:17.240> with<00:03:17.420> the

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
thought we were much better with the

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.540 
thought we were much better with the
pass<00:03:17.690> rest<00:03:18.020> and<00:03:18.230> they<00:03:18.290> could<00:03:18.470> pass<00:03:18.650> block<00:03:18.980> but

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:19.550 
pass rest and they could pass block but

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:21.220 
pass rest and they could pass block but
I<00:03:19.640> thought<00:03:19.850> that<00:03:19.910> quarterback<00:03:20.780> and<00:03:21.140> those

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
I thought that quarterback and those

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:22.390 
I thought that quarterback and those
four<00:03:21.380> singles<00:03:21.680> had<00:03:21.800> a<00:03:21.830> great<00:03:22.160> relationship

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
four singles had a great relationship

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.530 
four singles had a great relationship
and<00:03:23.209> they<00:03:24.170> complete<00:03:24.709> Lexi<00:03:25.100> passes<00:03:25.520> let's<00:03:26.390> keep

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
and they complete Lexi passes let's keep

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.090 
and they complete Lexi passes let's keep
come<00:03:26.720> on<00:03:26.810> we<00:03:27.080> finally<00:03:27.410> figured<00:03:27.680> out<00:03:27.770> what<00:03:28.010> to

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:28.100 
come on we finally figured out what to

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.220 
come on we finally figured out what to
do<00:03:28.220> on<00:03:28.370> defense<00:03:28.870> we<00:03:29.870> have<00:03:29.959> some<00:03:30.080> major

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
do on defense we have some major

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.620 
do on defense we have some major
breakdowns<00:03:30.709> get<00:03:31.010> 14<00:03:31.459> I<00:03:31.760> think<00:03:32.090> we<00:03:32.360> kind<00:03:32.510> of

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.630 
breakdowns get 14 I think we kind of

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:34.270 
breakdowns get 14 I think we kind of
figured<00:03:32.870> it<00:03:32.930> out<00:03:33.050> and<00:03:33.590> we<00:03:33.709> just<00:03:33.860> keep<00:03:33.980> going

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
figured it out and we just keep going

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.640 
figured it out and we just keep going
keep<00:03:34.580> keep<00:03:34.880> rotating<00:03:35.360> that<00:03:35.780> thing<00:03:35.959> keep<00:03:36.530> it

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
keep keep rotating that thing keep it

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:38.110 
keep keep rotating that thing keep it
going<00:03:36.890> with<00:03:36.980> the<00:03:37.100> covers<00:03:37.370> we<00:03:37.520> have<00:03:37.670> a<00:03:37.880> few

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
going with the covers we have a few

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.479

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.390

thought we played well and I thought we

00:04:47.869 --> 00:04:49.540

pretty<00:04:48.139> aggressive<00:04:48.589> put<00:04:48.770> up<00:04:48.860> a<00:04:48.949> lot<00:04:49.069> of<00:04:49.099> points

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:49.550 
pretty aggressive put up a lot of points

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:51.399 
pretty aggressive put up a lot of points
play<00:04:49.999> to<00:04:50.059> get<00:04:50.300> strong<00:04:50.599> second<00:04:51.080> quarter<00:04:51.289> in

third<00:04:51.619> quarter<00:04:51.979> and<00:04:52.039> then<00:04:52.219> we've<00:04:52.369> got<00:04:52.490> JD<00:04:52.759> in

00:04:52.989 --> 00:04:52.999 
third quarter and then we've got JD in

00:04:52.999 --> 00:04:55.600 
third quarter and then we've got JD in
real<00:04:53.300> early<00:04:53.689> so<00:04:54.169> I<00:04:54.199> was<00:04:54.979> fairly<00:04:55.219> pleased<00:04:55.580> I

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:55.610

00:04:59.439 --> 00:04:59.449 
and we were fairly strong on defense so

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:02.800
