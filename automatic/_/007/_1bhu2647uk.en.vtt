00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:13.610
 Run jump, run right 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:20.690
 pause open inventory 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.710
 Oh, you shit 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.800
 Nine people and welcome to 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.879
 a new motto review 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:49.699
 Today shows you the voice kreft mod and 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:52.940
 With this murder you can minecraft 

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:56.089
 Game was talking about what knows power 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:58.519
 actually, but already says me 

00:00:56.089 --> 00:01:03.019
 then show you the whole time 

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:04.129
 the installation the night is running now 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:07.610
 he already here although I do not care 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:12.069
 said one has to stop so it is 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:14.060
 stopped now but I run myself 

00:01:12.069 --> 00:01:18.830
 I'll just do it first 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:20.630
 speech recognition speech recognition so then 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:23.030
 it says that it is over now I can 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.399
 say everything I want to run eg under 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.679
 does not matter if I am now 

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:31.100
 Re- enable speech recognition 

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:34.250
 and now, for example, say, then run 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.810
 he starts to run and now opens 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.369
 He makes a list and makes a lot 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.869
 Commands because I'm talking 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:41.890
 that's a bit weird at the time 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:44.109
 audrey view the sun but to have 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.070
 stop 

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:48.259
 So he stops again 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:51.729
 and then there is a whole list of 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:55.509
 commands you can do eg fly 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:02:03.729
 I said fly 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:02:05.630
 maintain they do not run kathrin gutmann 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:07.429
 cook, that's a little bit more 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.869
 magic but that is now on course 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:12.380
 motto degree worked just fine 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:15.880
 is always like that again now 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:22.690
 Stop going right 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:33.109
 go forward stop go left 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:34.430
 Stop jumping forward now 

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:36.850
 I take the mountains and he slowly 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:42.579
 then it jumps up automatically 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:42.579
 Now I'm on the mountain 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:50.890
 Throwing away item is far from how it is 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:50.890
 actually 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:03:00.650
 throw away item to throw away so ran 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:05.850
 We now come to chat to open 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.080
 can namely chat open on 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:09.270
 hottest if you were still 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.459
 could dictate that you have to do that 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:13.650
 motto creator write that when full 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:16.459
 cool and the list I show you 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:24.200
 then now if I say so now 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:24.200
 Show list and then you see wait 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:32.450
 cancel 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:37.430
 Undo Undo 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:37.430
 undo undo 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:48.270
 undo pressure do not care because 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:52.190
 For example, you can only do five 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:52.190
 wait seconds then add 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:04:03.019
 undo so jump fly 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:06.269
 stop 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:07.640
 wait five seconds now it was me 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:10.220
 has said he does it twice 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:16.430
 cancel 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:18.870
 go backwards with the throw away 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:20.989
 and now I can finish ge 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:25.169
 shut down 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:31.919
 oh yes that's the list so now 

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:36.450
 can i say a list then work off 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:41.850
 the six seconds is flying higher 

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:45.180
 to fly on runs on hold 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:46.650
 backwards and includes one now 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:53.040
 I stop forgetting and the list too 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:58.760
 make list open we stop now 

00:04:53.040 --> 00:05:01.970
 already recognized stop pause 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:01.970
 to work off the list 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:05.610
 now the six seconds is waiting white 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:08.010
 that such have caused what is 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:10.850
 then worked the command list from that 

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:13.820
 actually, I also think it's cool and cool 

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:16.190
 that is actually the mod and 

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:18.390
 now you can do that 

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:20.850
 Speech recognition is what makes you do it 

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:25.039
 I have speech recognition all over the world 

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:31.440
 intended speech recognition speech recognition 

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:33.090
 jump and now you jump and look 

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:35.000
 that is now stopped again 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:37.800
 understand is that you understand that it 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.720
 strong find these models 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:41.729
 Kurth you can see what works so well 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:44.490
 So only I think so right 

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:46.259
 can play minecraft to the course 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:50.550
 can you play right with me 

00:05:46.259 --> 00:05:53.270
 I'm even independent again 

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:57.319
 become or what here what do you do 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:57.319
 No matter I just finish 

00:05:57.979 --> 00:06:02.819
 I wanted to say that right 

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:04.050
 You can play minecraft with it now 

00:06:02.819 --> 00:06:05.669
 probably not that is such a 

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:06.629
 bauble because so run and turn and 

00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:08.250
 so you can do it all bad 

00:06:06.629 --> 00:06:09.419
 but cool if i still have that 

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:12.210
 could dictate chat 

00:06:09.419 --> 00:06:14.159
 and for all who do not know that 

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:15.900
 with that now here with the minecraft that 

00:06:14.159 --> 00:06:17.879
 of course, that was not the case 

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:19.050
 built in place is so true 

00:06:17.879 --> 00:06:19.710
 It's clear, but I'll just say it 

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:21.780
 anyway 

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:24.680
 I hope this time you liked 

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:24.680
 and ciao
