wait out somewhere Milan scales before

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.730 
wait out somewhere Milan scales before
it's<00:00:22.050> easy<00:00:22.260> to<00:00:22.560> work<00:00:22.680> out<00:00:22.859> the<00:00:23.010> macros<00:00:23.460> and<00:00:24.740> and

it's easy to work out the macros and and

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.000 
it's easy to work out the macros and and
then<00:00:26.699> basis<00:00:27.150> divide<00:00:27.689> the<00:00:27.869> number<00:00:28.199> when<00:00:28.859> it's

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
then basis divide the number when it's

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.910 
then basis divide the number when it's
cooked<00:00:29.369> the<00:00:30.359> weight<00:00:31.219> by<00:00:32.219> how<00:00:32.669> many<00:00:32.730> males<00:00:33.059> have
