can you tell if a playstation 4 game

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.740 
can you tell if a playstation 4 game
supports<00:02:25.920> 1080p<00:02:26.430> just<00:02:26.880> turn<00:02:27.060> the<00:02:27.180> case<00:02:27.390> around

supports 1080p just turn the case around

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.670 
supports 1080p just turn the case around
but<00:02:28.620> that<00:02:29.069> is<00:02:29.220> not<00:02:29.400> the<00:02:29.640> case<00:02:29.880> for<00:02:30.540> the<00:02:31.230> Xbox

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
but that is not the case for the Xbox

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.400 
but that is not the case for the Xbox
one<00:02:32.010> it<00:02:32.519> seems<00:02:32.820> that<00:02:32.910> Microsoft<00:02:33.690> has<00:02:33.750> opted

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
one it seems that Microsoft has opted

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.770 
one it seems that Microsoft has opted
not<00:02:34.440> to<00:02:35.370> showcase<00:02:35.850> their<00:02:36.090> resolutions

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
not to showcase their resolutions

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.140 
not to showcase their resolutions
anymore<00:02:37.200> most<00:02:37.709> likely<00:02:37.950> due<00:02:38.340> to<00:02:38.370> the<00:02:38.610> increased

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
anymore most likely due to the increased

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.810 
anymore most likely due to the increased

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
now if you take a look at the main cases

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.550 
now if you take a look at the main cases
like<00:02:57.770> for<00:02:57.980> instance<00:02:58.040> if<00:02:58.490> you<00:02:58.580> take<00:02:58.790> a<00:02:58.820> look<00:02:58.910> at

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
like for instance if you take a look at

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.770 
like for instance if you take a look at
killzone<00:03:00.560> shadow<00:03:00.950> fall<00:03:01.070> on<00:03:01.610> the<00:03:02.180> back<00:03:02.420> it

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
killzone shadow fall on the back it

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.410 
killzone shadow fall on the back it
definitely<00:03:03.440> has<00:03:03.680> what<00:03:04.150> resolution<00:03:05.150> that<00:03:05.270> the
