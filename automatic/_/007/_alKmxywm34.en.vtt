for<00:02:33.380> Bishop<00:02:34.250> g7<00:02:36.430> I've<00:02:37.430> just<00:02:37.610> highlighted<00:02:37.850> here

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
for Bishop g7 I've just highlighted here

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.530 
for Bishop g7 I've just highlighted here
for<00:02:39.200> white<00:02:39.470> there<00:02:39.770> a<00:02:40.040> lot<00:02:40.700> of<00:02:40.730> different<00:02:40.970> moves

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
for white there a lot of different moves

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.570 
for white there a lot of different moves
that<00:02:42.110> white<00:02:42.320> could<00:02:42.560> play<00:02:42.740> y<00:02:43.100> could<00:02:43.280> play<00:02:43.430> any

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
that white could play y could play any

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.600 
that white could play y could play any
of<00:02:43.730> these<00:02:43.820> three<00:02:44.150> moves<00:02:44.500> then<00:02:45.500> black<00:02:46.430> will

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
of these three moves then black will

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.120 
of these three moves then black will
play<00:02:46.640> a<00:02:46.760> c5<00:02:47.270> and<00:02:47.540> then<00:02:47.930> we<00:02:48.080> have<00:02:48.350> what<00:02:48.980> is

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
play a c5 and then we have what is

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:53.500 
play a c5 and then we have what is
called<00:02:49.570> the<00:02:50.570> sniper<00:02:51.970> now<00:02:52.970> I'll<00:02:53.120> just<00:02:53.150> let<00:02:53.420> them

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
called the sniper now I'll just let them

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.850 
called the sniper now I'll just let them
make<00:02:53.600> a<00:02:53.660> quick<00:02:53.840> definition<00:02:54.440> here<00:02:54.709> the<00:02:55.190> sniper

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
make a quick definition here the sniper

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.100 
make a quick definition here the sniper
was<00:02:57.860> originally<00:02:58.370> for<00:02:58.520> black<00:02:58.720> it<00:02:59.720> is<00:02:59.900> only

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
was originally for black it is only

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:02.080 
was originally for black it is only
recently<00:03:00.440> that<00:03:00.800> I've<00:03:00.950> decided<00:03:01.340> to<00:03:01.550> set<00:03:01.790> up<00:03:01.910> a

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
recently that I've decided to set up a

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.080 
recently that I've decided to set up a
white<00:03:02.300> sniper<00:03:02.660> and<00:03:02.930> thus<00:03:03.920> to<00:03:04.580> differentiate

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
white sniper and thus to differentiate

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:10.360 
white sniper and thus to differentiate
between<00:03:05.270> the<00:03:05.630> two<00:03:05.660> the<00:03:06.500> sniper<00:03:06.860> is<00:03:08.470> for<00:03:09.470> the

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
between the two the sniper is for the

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.520 
between the two the sniper is for the
black<00:03:10.580> sniper<00:03:10.910> and<00:03:11.420> to<00:03:12.140> differentiate

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
black sniper and to differentiate

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.390 
black sniper and to differentiate
clearly<00:03:13.160> the<00:03:14.000> whites<00:03:14.239> neighbor<00:03:14.570> is<00:03:14.900> for<00:03:15.440> when

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
clearly the whites neighbor is for when

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.560 
clearly the whites neighbor is for when
we're<00:03:16.850> playing<00:03:17.769> basically<00:03:18.769> a<00:03:18.890> reverse<00:03:19.220> sniper

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:19.570 
we're playing basically a reverse sniper

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:21.820 
we're playing basically a reverse sniper
so<00:03:20.570> normally<00:03:20.959> it<00:03:21.019> might<00:03:21.170> come<00:03:21.410> about<00:03:21.530> the

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:21.830 
so normally it might come about the

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:23.830 
so normally it might come about the
other<00:03:21.950> way<00:03:22.160> whereas<00:03:22.910> you<00:03:23.120> would<00:03:23.269> have<00:03:23.420> had<00:03:23.600> the

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
other way whereas you would have had the

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.660 
other way whereas you would have had the
sniper<00:03:24.080> then<00:03:24.440> the<00:03:24.620> blacks<00:03:24.860> neighbor<00:03:25.130> but

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
sniper then the blacks neighbor but

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:26.530 
sniper then the blacks neighbor but
that's<00:03:25.880> not<00:03:26.060> the<00:03:26.150> way<00:03:26.239> I'm<00:03:26.330> going<00:03:26.450> to

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
that's not the way I'm going to

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.390 
that's not the way I'm going to
reference<00:03:26.690> material<00:03:27.440> because<00:03:27.920> the<00:03:28.190> black

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
reference material because the black

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:29.770 
reference material because the black
snake<00:03:28.610> over<00:03:28.910> came<00:03:29.090> first

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
snake over came first

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:32.290 
snake over came first
that<00:03:30.470> is<00:03:30.650> going<00:03:30.800> to<00:03:30.920> get<00:03:31.100> priority<00:03:31.580> there<00:03:32.030> for

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:32.300 
that is going to get priority there for

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.870 
that is going to get priority there for
the<00:03:33.110> sniper<00:03:33.410> is<00:03:33.709> for<00:03:33.920> black<00:03:34.100> and<00:03:34.400> the<00:03:34.610> white

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:34.880 
the sniper is for black and the white

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.479 
the sniper is for black and the white

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:44.269 
of these moves now any one of these

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:47.110 
of these moves now any one of these
moves<00:03:44.720> on<00:03:45.110> move<00:03:45.380> three<00:03:45.709> and<00:03:45.920> then<00:03:46.430> if<00:03:46.700> black

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
moves on move three and then if black

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.870 
moves on move three and then if black
then<00:03:47.390> plays<00:03:47.750> as<00:03:48.170> what<00:03:48.650> is<00:03:48.980> the<00:03:49.100> main<00:03:49.280> line<00:03:49.519> here

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:49.880 
then plays as what is the main line here

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:52.840 
then plays as what is the main line here
if<00:03:50.269> you<00:03:50.390> then<00:03:50.510> place<00:03:50.810> three<00:03:51.290> c5<00:03:51.800> then<00:03:52.430> we<00:03:52.670> have

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:52.850 
if you then place three c5 then we have

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:56.130 
if you then place three c5 then we have
what<00:03:53.330> we<00:03:53.420> call<00:03:53.570> a<00:03:53.630> pure<00:03:54.019> sniper<00:03:54.500> in<00:03:54.920> position

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:56.140 
what we call a pure sniper in position

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:58.630 
what we call a pure sniper in position
now<00:03:57.140> the<00:03:57.200> reason<00:03:57.650> I've<00:03:57.769> showed<00:03:57.980> you<00:03:58.160> this<00:03:58.340> is

00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:58.640 
now the reason I've showed you this is

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:02.460 
now the reason I've showed you this is
that<00:03:59.209> the<00:03:59.660> white<00:03:59.870> sniper<00:04:00.230> as<00:04:00.830> you<00:04:01.010> will<00:04:01.160> see<00:04:01.370> is

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 
that the white sniper as you will see is

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:07.270 
that the white sniper as you will see is
exactly<00:04:03.580> blacks<00:04:04.580> moves<00:04:04.880> in<00:04:05.150> Reverse<00:04:06.160> and<00:04:07.160> this

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
exactly blacks moves in Reverse and this

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.770 
exactly blacks moves in Reverse and this
brings<00:04:07.519> about<00:04:07.610> some<00:04:07.790> interesting<00:04:08.330> new

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:08.780 
brings about some interesting new

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:09.789 
brings about some interesting new
possibilities

00:04:09.789 --> 00:04:09.799 
possibilities

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:13.390 
possibilities
if<00:04:10.190> white<00:04:10.519> players<00:04:10.850> this<00:04:11.090> way<00:04:11.330> and

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.400 
if white players this way and

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.810 
if white players this way and
I<00:04:14.590> will<00:04:15.590> just<00:04:15.799> show<00:04:15.980> you<00:04:16.009> a<00:04:16.190> couple<00:04:16.519> of<00:04:16.669> more
