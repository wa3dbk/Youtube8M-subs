00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:13.110
 the youtube staff only had technicians 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.670
 They'll bring more people to you. 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.279

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.779
 essential for your android is a 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.220
 output doing my channel 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.960
 I'll try to change that name because it already has 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.420
 the channels that make that name 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.359
 in the era of $ 16 puts with applications 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.070
 important the guys let's meet the 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.590
 first applications or spoken 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.020
 show them flashlight because the flashlight is 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.809
 necessary to give solution 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.489
 It happens a lot in Brazil, the blackout 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.140
 near the world cup is able to have a 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.870
 blackout there in the world cup 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.840
 this would be even controversial because Brazil 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.270
 lagged but the issue is the antenna 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.149
 It's important because it was apocalypse. 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:55.199
 tactical zombie in the massacre 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:57.360
 the guy went into a movie people exchange 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.550
 these basic and common things of life 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.910
 everyday you need a flashlight 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:05.510
 with the power of this card the power 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:10.080
 this is too big 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:11.850
 Yes, of course people are very powerful. 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.159
 police do not advise to put 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.380
 anyone it as a joke that is okay 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.570
 have people with myopia more likely to 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.909
 stay with vision problems so I 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.100
 I do not advise I have my piano if 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.240
 put this to play with this flashlight 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.860
 in nobody's eye 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.380
 This may not be the only problem. 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:32.640
 alerting the children on duty there 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:35.100
 what's up whatsapp is important because it's 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.729
 a way for you to send messages 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:41.040
 It's good to send messages in a way. 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:44.040
 free only using the internet 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.420
 meaning you will only pay for the internet 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.119
 there are plans for certain 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.909
 operators that the internet is free 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:53.610
 so you end up not liking anything with 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.350
 the sap then the athlete is very good 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.140

 have to pay a fee of $ 99 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.240
 this is very good because it is cheap on 12 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.799
 hey guys 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.990
 that we have to help the 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:06.369
 developers because an application is 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.789
 really really good he does not talk to 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:12.250
 ads in the field is just too annoying 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:14.290
 so they do not sell it to us only 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:17.470
 ask if you start a payment 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.670
 legal amount of $ 99 which is a 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.650
 very low 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.660
 I want other apps for you 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.830
