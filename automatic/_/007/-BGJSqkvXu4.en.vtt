the<00:00:11.709> idea<00:00:12.099> of<00:00:12.309> this<00:00:12.400> experiment<00:00:13.120> is<00:00:13.269> to<00:00:13.480> prove

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:13.780 
the idea of this experiment is to prove

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:16.700 
the idea of this experiment is to prove
that<00:00:14.079> wouldn't<00:00:14.320> is<00:00:14.619> not<00:00:14.829> dissolve<00:00:15.280> everything

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
that wouldn't is not dissolve everything

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.230 
that wouldn't is not dissolve everything
the<00:00:17.710> materials<00:00:18.220> we'll<00:00:18.460> be<00:00:18.490> using<00:00:18.609> for<00:00:19.000> this

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:43.020 
oil and tables and four of the five
glasses<00:00:41.140> are<00:00:41.680> filled<00:00:41.949> 3/4<00:00:42.460> of<00:00:42.489> the<00:00:42.699> way<00:00:42.850> with

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:43.030 
glasses are filled 3/4 of the way with

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:47.010 
glasses are filled 3/4 of the way with
water<00:00:43.469> so<00:00:44.469> let's<00:00:44.680> get<00:00:44.829> started<00:00:45.539> but<00:00:46.539> we

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:47.020 
water so let's get started but we

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:49.110 
water so let's get started but we
already<00:00:47.379> think<00:00:47.649> filled<00:00:48.280> up<00:00:48.579> our<00:00:48.820> water

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.120 
already think filled up our water

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.689 
already think filled up our water
previously<00:00:50.079> so<00:00:50.649> what<00:00:50.890> we're<00:00:51.010> going<00:00:51.160> to<00:00:51.190> do<00:00:51.399> is

00:00:51.689 --> 00:00:51.699 
previously so what we're going to do is

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:54.299 
previously so what we're going to do is
take<00:00:51.969> 1/2<00:00:52.449> a<00:00:52.600> teaspoon<00:00:53.199> of<00:00:53.350> sugar<00:00:53.410> and<00:00:53.949> pour<00:00:54.160> it

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:05.440 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:08.620 

this<00:05:06.440> doesn't<00:05:06.920> seem<00:05:07.100> to<00:05:07.160> be<00:05:07.310> absorbing<00:05:07.550> as<00:05:08.450> you

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:08.630 
this doesn't seem to be absorbing as you

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:12.460 
this doesn't seem to be absorbing as you
can<00:05:08.780> see<00:05:08.990> yeah<00:05:10.030> the<00:05:11.030> olive<00:05:11.450> oil<00:05:11.630> stands<00:05:12.200> out

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:12.470 
can see yeah the olive oil stands out

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:14.260 
can see yeah the olive oil stands out
from<00:05:12.680> where<00:05:13.250> it's<00:05:13.580> just<00:05:13.700> rising<00:05:14.060> to<00:05:14.180> the

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:14.270 
from where it's just rising to the

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:16.330 
from where it's just rising to the
constant<00:05:14.660> separate<00:05:15.080> yeah<00:05:15.800> it<00:05:16.010> doesn't<00:05:16.220> even

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:16.340 
constant separate yeah it doesn't even

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:18.040 
constant separate yeah it doesn't even
sink<00:05:16.730> down<00:05:16.910> to<00:05:16.940> the<00:05:17.120> bottom<00:05:17.210> as<00:05:17.600> you<00:05:17.630> can<00:05:17.810> see

oops
that<00:06:25.970> was<00:06:26.150> a<00:06:26.180> mission<00:06:26.720> experiment<00:06:27.470> except<00:06:27.800> yes

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:39.700 

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:52.150 

mix<00:06:40.700> a<00:06:40.790> little<00:06:41.000> bit

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:52.160 

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:55.850 

it<00:06:53.160> appears<00:06:53.520> that<00:06:53.610> this<00:06:53.880> one<00:06:54.120> is<00:06:54.860> dissolve

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:55.860 
it appears that this one is dissolve

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:58.249 
it appears that this one is dissolve
more<00:06:56.250> than<00:06:56.669> the<00:06:56.820> water<00:06:57.060> and<00:06:57.389> the<00:06:57.690> other<00:06:57.720> climb

00:06:58.249 --> 00:06:58.259 
more than the water and the other climb

00:06:58.259 --> 00:07:00.800 
more than the water and the other climb
then<00:06:59.070> all<00:06:59.370> of<00:06:59.430> the<00:07:00.060> oil<00:07:00.270> and<00:07:00.509> the<00:07:00.660> other

then all of the oil and the other
glasses<00:07:01.669> of<00:07:02.669> water<00:07:03.090> as<00:07:03.680> you<00:07:04.680> can<00:07:04.830> see<00:07:04.979> there

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:05.220 
glasses of water as you can see there

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:08.719 
glasses of water as you can see there
are<00:07:05.370> bubbles<00:07:06.169> which<00:07:07.169> might<00:07:07.470> be<00:07:07.800> the<00:07:08.190> oil

00:07:08.719 --> 00:07:08.729 
are bubbles which might be the oil

00:07:08.729 --> 00:07:15.800 
are bubbles which might be the oil
separating<00:07:09.539> yeah<00:07:12.800> so<00:07:13.800> just<00:07:14.400> include<00:07:14.759> what<00:07:15.660> it

00:07:19.159 --> 00:07:19.169 
did not dissolve all solid all science

00:07:19.169 --> 00:07:23.060 
did not dissolve all solid all science
and<00:07:19.380> solids<00:07:21.199> and<00:07:22.199> thank<00:07:22.440> you<00:07:22.530> for<00:07:22.680> coming<00:07:22.979> to

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:23.070 
and solids and thank you for coming to

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:28.070 
and solids and thank you for coming to
