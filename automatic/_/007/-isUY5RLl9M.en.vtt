00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:13.170
 and even as every week with us 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.430
 luce garcía that you are not welcome to 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.170
 the jolie how are you good afternoon what 

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:18.330
 I'd like to say hello to all of our 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.330
 friends today today today we talk about an animal 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.490
 which precisely Jacques Cousteau did 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.650
 very much for people to have this 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.810
 bad image of the stingray not the people 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.880
 I thought it was an evil animal 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.770
 animal that hurt the human being but 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.030
 and with all your studies well 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:35.850
 showed that there is not one of the 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.040
 more friendly and friendly animals I say 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.900
 of dangerous care and clear for its 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.339
 size were for its size but it is a 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.290
 animal that is not aggressive with being 

00:00:41.339 --> 00:00:46.309
 human or with other animals we are going to 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.309
 watch him enjoy it 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:08.430
 his peculiar figure causes fear and fear 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:11.460
 but it's really just a fake 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.950
 appearance because the giant stingray does not 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.110
 it's an aggressive fish although its nine 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.880
 meters in size as well as its 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.040
 ton and a half of weight that can 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.580
 reach to reach could cause a serious 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.840
 damage to the human being in case of an attack 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:27.420
 just like the giant shark 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.220
 whale the giant stingray is a 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.260
 colossus that swims peacefully by the 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.510
 warm waters of the planet's oceans 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:36.810
 just in search of your principal 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:38.940
 food the plankton its enormous size and 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.460
 the lack of a poisonous sting in the 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.830
 tail the differences of his sisters the 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.140
 berries that usually inhabit the bottom of the 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:48.780
 seabed or in rivers where it 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.119
 they bury or use their color to 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.610
 camouflaged in the sand their 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.680
 features front fins form 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.650
 a kind of upper lips of his 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:01.020
 huge mouth that lacks teeth and for 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:03.450
 where they absorb with a vacuum the 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.950
 plankton to feed themselves although to 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.710
 simple view all the stingrays 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:10.020
 They look the same, it's not like that 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.360
 on its back the characteristic 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.940
 black color but on his white tooth 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.520
 they all have small spots 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:20.490
 unique blacks as if it were 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.670
 fingerprints that identify them their 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:24.739
 aerodynamic shape allows you to perform 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.750
 spectacular jumps out of the water 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:30.420
 some scientists who do it for 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.940
 communicate or as part of a cocktail 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.400
 with the male towards the female at the time of 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:38.640
 mating to escape from a 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:41.100
 predator like the orca or the shark the 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.590
 climate change contamination 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:45.660
 seas and indiscriminate hunting have 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.070
 reduced the population of the giant of the 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.250
 oceans 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:52.620
 even so the black-winged angel follows 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.870
 Waving its wings to sail the seas 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:58.790
 in search of large plankton banks 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.790
 as it has done for centuries 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:09.690
 of bcn and looked garcía strange 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:12.090
 I already highly recommend that this 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:14.040
 type of notes and videos share them 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.989
 especially with small children or if 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.569
 they have myths about their primitive milestones 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:20.670
 etcetera must be on their walls to 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:22.080
 that they can also enjoy it and 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.580
 especially learn a lot of thanks 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.959
 they are super well armed this 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.580
 material thank you not only in the next 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:30.200
 not next week I next 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:30.200
 Christmas no bye
