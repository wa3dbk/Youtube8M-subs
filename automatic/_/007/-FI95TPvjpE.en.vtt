00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:04.150
 I have chickens and you have a 

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:06.740
 garden with tomatoes and I want tomatoes and 

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:09.440
 you ask for eggs that we make 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:12.170
 an exchange a simple exchange for 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:14.629
 example a new for each tomato well 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:16.160
 were the things at the beginning but of course 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:18.320
 times their tomatoes were better and arts 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.789
 worse or maybe you do not want to buy a 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.890
 horse and do not have very clear how many 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:23.689
 eggs I need but if we use as 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:26.270
 reference for example is a simple 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:28.730
 example a little bit of gold 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:31.430
 but it's nice to shine and there's 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:34.110
 too much is valuable so we can 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:35.820
 make a conversion table 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.470
 if a dozen eggs are worth the same 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.720
 that a gold nugget and a horse 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:42.410
 slope without seeds is easy to know in a 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:44.690
 horse is as good as 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:47.210
 what if in dozens of simple eggs 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.860
 true gold thus becomes currency 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.640
 change 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.640
 or simplification 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.400
 that you can not buy a horse with 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.450
 eggs change eggs for coins and 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.450
 one approaches to leave it 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.830
 nice truth 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:22.960
 that is the first step everything is more or 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:24.670
 less like the beginning except that 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:30.780
 now we need only to buy the 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:30.780
 things that we do not produce milk meat clothes 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.160
 the person who invented the system has 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.930
 an establishment a place where 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:40.440
 store the gold and we can 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.440
 get 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.120
 man is a clear altruist not 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.490
 wants to sell us the gold, it's enough 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:52.350
 lend us for example to me give me 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:56.210
 ten coins for me leaves them in 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.210
 loan for a period of 12 months 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.640
 just ask me for a reasonable logical interest 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:06.590
 let's say that 10% of that does risk 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.149
 her and I did not risk anything so 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.860
 You need a guarantee to cover the 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:11.840
 possibility that I do not fulfill my part 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.989
 of the deal 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:17.410
 would you mind hitting those oranges more 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:17.410
 they are for juice 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.810
 in your case if you also want gold 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.330
 mortgage your garden so man 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.570
 he lends ten coins in exchange for his 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.570
 earnings 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:37.730
 you follow with your tomatoes and your 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.860
 canaries do not have to get rid of 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.840
 nothing and can continue trading alone 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.370
 have to return to the bank of coins 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:47.230
 after one year the ten that you 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:49.599
 they lent more interest as they give 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.340
 well I have a garden I can sell my 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:53.650
 products and have you a whole year 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:57.819
 only if he does not comply the bank will stay 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:03:00.390
 with the garden according to the problem not 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:00.390
 there is a problem 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:09.350
 let's imagine that the bank has a 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:11.590
 total amount of say 100 currency 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:11.590
 tion 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:19.280
 what is the total amount of gold that 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:19.280
 There are 100 coins and one more 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:25.690
 besides the good man we exist other 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:30.269
 ten people you me such a blacksmith 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:30.269
 once a couple of ranchers a seamstress 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:36.170
 ten people in total we all need 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.900
 gold to buy and we've all asked for a 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:41.950
 loan ten coins for each one a 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.950
 total of 100 coins 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:06.980
 it is lost 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:13.870
 late not the banker has not surrendered 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:17.139
 all your gold with absolute generosity and 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:21.170
 change that a simple 10% 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:24.950
 One coin per person is fair 

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:26.360
 but that's it but according to Pythagoras we have 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:28.789
 a problem 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:31.660
 if after 12 months we have to pay 11 

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:34.870
 coins each 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:36.790
 15 coins each are 110 coins 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:40.800
 that means there are 10 coins in 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:40.800
 interests that can never be paid 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:44.100
 whatever happens 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:51.060
 no problem the bank was invented 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:53.340
 to facilitate things not for 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:56.250
 complicate there is a reasonable solution 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:58.740
 do not worry stir me only those 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:02.160
 interest a coin each 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:05.120
 I will wait next year and they will return me 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:09.000
 the amount initially borrowed 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:10.740
 the first ten currencies in short 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.190
 Really 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:18.249
 however, if we return a 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:22.230
 currency will be 99 each 

00:05:18.249 --> 00:05:23.820
 so if we still owe 10 coins 

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:26.200
 as a year we will continue with the same 

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:29.320
 problem and also 

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:31.360
 we will have less money right one 

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:32.950
 currency less than the previous year if 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:35.230
 we repeat the operation for ten years 

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:38.140
 and that whenever they let us pay only 

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:42.010
 the interest in that time we will stay 

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:44.140
 without anything, all the money will disappear without 

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:46.720
 However, we will continue to have a loan 

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:50.200
 initial the bank will have recovered everything 

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:51.610
 gold we will not have anything and still 

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:54.520
 we will pay what they lent us 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:56.170
 principle 100 coins among all that 

00:05:54.520 --> 00:06:00.390
 we can never return because 

00:05:56.170 --> 00:06:00.390
 they simply do not exist 

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:10.470
 so we will lose the lands the 

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:12.830
 animals and the food that we mortgage 

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:15.510
 as a guarantee of the principle 10 years ago 

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:17.430
 in 10 years the bank will have what it had 

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:19.970
 at the beginning plus all our 

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:22.410
 possessions and we will not have anything 

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:24.360
 absolutely nothing with what in the 

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:28.780
 practice we will have made us 

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:32.160
 bank slaves and because for nothing 

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:32.160
 and for nothing
