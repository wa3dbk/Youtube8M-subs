which<00:03:00.319> is<00:03:00.470> absolutely<00:03:01.190> critical<00:03:01.510> but<00:03:02.510> you<00:03:02.599> can

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
which is absolutely critical but you can

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.690 
which is absolutely critical but you can
see<00:03:02.900> here<00:03:03.110> the<00:03:03.260> edge<00:03:03.950> of<00:03:04.099> design<00:03:04.370> is<00:03:04.519> just

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
see here the edge of design is just

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.850 
see here the edge of design is just
immaculate<00:03:04.970> and<00:03:05.390> from<00:03:06.290> an<00:03:06.379> installation

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
immaculate and from an installation

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:08.050 
immaculate and from an installation
standpoint<00:03:07.310> it's<00:03:07.459> one<00:03:07.580> of<00:03:07.670> the<00:03:07.730> lightest

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
standpoint it's one of the lightest

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:09.580 
standpoint it's one of the lightest
engines<00:03:08.390> in<00:03:08.480> the<00:03:08.569> field<00:03:08.810> so<00:03:09.050> that<00:03:09.080> gives<00:03:09.349> us<00:03:09.470> a

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
engines in the field so that gives us a

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.589 
engines in the field so that gives us a
little<00:03:09.739> bit<00:03:09.860> more<00:03:10.010> freedom<00:03:10.280> concerning<00:03:11.239> setup

00:03:11.589 --> 00:03:11.599 
little bit more freedom concerning setup

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:13.600 
little bit more freedom concerning setup
than<00:03:11.780> you<00:03:11.870> would<00:03:12.019> with<00:03:12.050> a<00:03:12.200> heavier<00:03:12.560> engine<00:03:12.920> so

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610 
than you would with a heavier engine so

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:14.860 
than you would with a heavier engine so
it's<00:03:14.030> definitely<00:03:14.360> pushing<00:03:14.720> all<00:03:14.840> the
