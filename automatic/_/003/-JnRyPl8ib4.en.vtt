00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
for me I think is a good idea because I

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.750 
for me I think is a good idea because I
didn't<00:00:33.300> play<00:00:33.420> too<00:00:33.480> much<00:00:33.809> cheese<00:00:34.309> this<00:00:35.309> morning

are back and crossbow is going to be a
little<00:00:56.100> bit<00:00:56.219> more<00:00:56.520> futuristic<00:00:56.820> and<00:00:57.480> for<00:00:58.379> the

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
little bit more futuristic and for the

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.860 
little bit more futuristic and for the
list<00:00:59.160> for<00:00:59.910> me<00:01:00.059> I<00:01:00.090> think<00:01:00.300> it's<00:01:00.600> going<00:01:00.660> to<00:01:00.780> be

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
list for me I think it's going to be

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.900 
list for me I think it's going to be
pretty<00:01:01.079> cool<00:01:01.379> ballistic<00:01:01.890> knife<00:01:02.100> I<00:01:02.370> don't

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
pretty cool ballistic knife I don't

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.520 
pretty cool ballistic knife I don't
really<00:01:03.059> know<00:01:03.300> I<00:01:03.539> think<00:01:04.049> it's<00:01:04.140> going<00:01:04.229> to<00:01:04.350> be<00:01:04.439> the

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
really know I think it's going to be the

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.010 
really know I think it's going to be the

players can rank up from level 1 to
level<00:01:16.380> 10<00:01:16.890> basically<00:01:17.820> that's<00:01:18.090> what<00:01:18.330> it<00:01:18.630> is<00:01:18.750> in

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
level 10 basically that's what it is in

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.100 
level 10 basically that's what it is in
boot<00:01:19.110> camp<00:01:19.670> objective<00:01:20.670> you<00:01:20.880> can<00:01:21.150> pass<00:01:21.570> the

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
boot camp objective you can pass the

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.700 
boot camp objective you can pass the
level<00:01:22.350> 10<00:01:22.740> that's<00:01:23.640> pretty<00:01:24.180> much<00:01:24.299> it<00:01:24.509> and<00:01:25.110> both

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
level 10 that's pretty much it and both

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.810 
level 10 that's pretty much it and both
stomp<00:01:26.280> you<00:01:26.939> don't<00:01:27.119> worry<00:01:27.270> no<00:01:27.750> XP<00:01:28.439> and

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.820 
stomp you don't worry no XP and

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.760 
stomp you don't worry no XP and
basically<00:01:29.820> it's<00:01:30.240> a<00:01:30.479> team<00:01:30.689> of<00:01:30.840> humans<00:01:31.229> against

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
basically it's a team of humans against

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.580 
basically it's a team of humans against
assume<00:01:32.130> a<00:01:32.340> team<00:01:32.549> of<00:01:32.729> bots<00:01:33.049> that's<00:01:34.049> pretty<00:01:34.470> much

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
assume a team of bots that's pretty much

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.399 
assume a team of bots that's pretty much
it<00:01:34.650> of<00:01:34.979> optical<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:36.119> combat<00:01:36.840> training<00:01:37.110> I

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
it of optical the combat training I

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.039 
it of optical the combat training I
didn't<00:01:38.159> like<00:01:38.759> too<00:01:38.970> much<00:01:39.119> combat<00:01:39.479> training<00:01:39.810> in

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
didn't like too much combat training in

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.020 
didn't like too much combat training in
black<00:01:40.350> ops<00:01:40.619> I<00:01:40.890> think<00:01:41.070> it<00:01:41.130> was<00:01:41.280> a<00:01:41.310> good<00:01:41.579> idea<00:01:41.700> but

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
black ops I think it was a good idea but

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.200 
black ops I think it was a good idea but
it's<00:01:42.899> not<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.110> best<00:01:43.820> customization<00:01:44.820> this

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
it's not the best customization this

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.330 
it's not the best customization this
brand<00:01:45.540> new<00:01:45.630> and<00:01:45.990> basically<00:01:46.380> if<00:01:46.740> you<00:01:46.890> are<00:01:46.979> in<00:01:47.310> a

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
brand new and basically if you are in a

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.399 
brand new and basically if you are in a
match<00:01:47.790> and<00:01:48.119> you<00:01:48.270> connect<00:01:48.659> cannot<00:01:49.110> actually

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
match and you connect cannot actually

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.399 
match and you connect cannot actually
find<00:01:49.950> more<00:01:50.159> players<00:01:50.840> they<00:01:51.840> are<00:01:52.110> going<00:01:52.290> to

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
find more players they are going to

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:53.730 
find more players they are going to
replace<00:01:52.560> them<00:01:53.220> with

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740 
replace them with

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.550 
replace them with
but<00:01:54.490> I<00:01:54.520> think<00:01:55.000> if<00:01:55.210> someone<00:01:55.810> is<00:01:55.990> trying<00:01:56.140> to<00:01:56.259> join

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
but I think if someone is trying to join

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.039 
but I think if someone is trying to join
they<00:01:57.130> are<00:01:57.220> going<00:01:57.310> to<00:01:57.460> replace<00:01:57.520> the<00:01:58.060> box<00:01:58.270> so

00:01:59.039 --> 00:01:59.049 
they are going to replace the box so

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:01.319 
they are going to replace the box so
these<00:01:59.500> brand-new<00:01:59.950> I<00:02:00.310> think<00:02:00.579> for<00:02:00.729> call<00:02:00.970> of<00:02:01.000> duty

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:01.329 
these brand-new I think for call of duty

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:04.859 
these brand-new I think for call of duty
and<00:02:01.360> i<00:02:01.659> think<00:02:01.899> is<00:02:01.990> pretty<00:02:02.170> cool<00:02:02.700> and<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:04.750> last

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:04.869 
and i think is pretty cool and the last

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:07.830 
and i think is pretty cool and the last
thing<00:02:05.049> player<00:02:05.500> cards<00:02:06.119> playa<00:02:07.119> basically<00:02:07.630> the

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
thing player cards playa basically the

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.710 
thing player cards playa basically the
