 zorinu because you are who he lost but 

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:02.430
 he was laying something and 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:04.740
 in general, we are not responsible for doing nothing 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:10.820
 or maybe he just walked away once 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:16.970
 now happy zor collects with and burns everything 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:20.640
 will start 5 who is a vampire 4 and Vlad some 

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:23.220
 21 all drove they will be on the lighters 

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:27.300

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:33.360
 kindle can't they just divide 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:38.310
 lighter she enchanted well well 

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:41.490

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:00.900
 generally out 

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:06.820
 so now everything is as per the rules only 

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:09.220
 if happy zor loses it will not work 

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:11.920
 because he didn't lose in the stage 

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:14.290
