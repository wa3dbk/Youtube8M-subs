00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:03.840
 very good guys that as they are 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.870
 children to another video today we are with the 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:09.060
 sixth chapter 6 chapter of minecraft and 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.580
 I return the boys 

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:13.380
 and see the amount of obsidian that 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.200
 killed 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.880
 to withdraw from there and then you can see 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.500
 that I have a diamond peak that was what 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.750
 I needed to remove the obsidian 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.360
 and well, you guys can see 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.460
 very much out there and right here 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:31.020
 I found in just above these rocks 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:33.329
 I found diamond ok thanks to that 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:36.989
 I could build how I could make my 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:40.079
 peak for guys and I went to get through 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.670
 true that I already went to put yes 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.760
 I think we should lower the sensitivity 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.310
 I went to put guys but it was a frame 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.850
 because first I did it with a command 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:53.610
 of playstation although I'm going to upload I'm going to 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:57.010
 climb to the top and you see that 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.510
 there is also had gold and red zone 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:02.490
 I tried to do it with a command 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:05.730
 playstation but good I went wrong 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:09.020
 since I could not find the button to 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:10.980
 jump and then I had to change to the 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.440
 touch controls to these to the 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:16.040
 touch controls and well also 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.040
 I tried 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:22.600
 good also also it was as for the 

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:24.789
 microphone moved me guys did not I had 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.880
 realized it moved me and then I was not 

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:29.950
 recording the audio well so I said that 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.719
 because it is very very bad because it only 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:35.049
 is showing the recordings of what 's 

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:36.880
 what of what I went to put and so 

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:39.950
 guys team of loops that passes the 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:42.890
 security phrases is very very 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:45.530
 very proud I do not think I think so 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:48.799
 then I'm going to change it because these guys 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:52.969
 you see what the portal says to me here 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:56.090
 put and well I also brought the room 

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:57.470
 footage that luminous glass 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:02.979
 ok so let's try to go 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:02.979
 again I will go after more 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:12.920
 I'm going to leave my diamond peak guys 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:15.730
 because they see no, I do not have many 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.730
 diamonds only 2 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:25.160
 the lighter I think if I have 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:29.920
 lighter or not 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.920
 we are not going to take away the stench 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:36.760
 I do not think I did have to anyway 

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:36.760
 we are going 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:43.060
 ok asia is done well let's go 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:43.060
 our guys 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.800
 good friends the reason why I came to 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:53.480
 subway was to get some 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:55.050
 materials that are not in the 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.940
 real world 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:59.580
 and you can only find it here 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.860
 like as the luminous stone these 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:04.860
 guys also the quartz I do not know for 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:07.200
 I'm going to serve the quartz and the 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.190
 why I came and then yesterday I was 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:12.490
 doing research 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:14.830
 was to get me or to find the 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:17.050
 place 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:19.180
 and then you can not find it guys you know 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:21.430
 that the blazer like that if you put it in it gives you a 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:24.490
 blaze bar which is useful for 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:26.740
 make potions support and then for 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:31.860
 that we can do the positions ok but 

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:31.860
 guys, I could not find the place 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:39.549
 ok so I just took this from 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:42.310
 here the luminous stone bring me the 

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:45.209
 quartz I took this red earth that did not 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.209
 I know what I'm going to serve 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:52.180
 and those guys nothing more so, well, 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:52.180
 already 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:04:01.280
 kava kava that happens to end in 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:02.959
 obsidian footage guys and well something that 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:08.740
 I thought you could do me here 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:11.460
 a portal if to another portal apart from 

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:14.370
 of which I already have up there 

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:18.500
 another portal already see that being close to 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:18.500
 the volcano takes her much the game 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:23.270
 and that's the idea, guys, I do not know how 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:25.039
 I'm going to go I want to see where I'm going 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:27.860
 send if it was able to make another portal 

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:29.690
 and on the beige guys comment mail by 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:35.990
 true the difficulty I have it to the maximum 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:41.990
 so comment because I can not 1 2 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:41.990
 34 I think I do think it's enough 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:49.940
 or what 

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:53.270
 almost there we have 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:56.050
 our portal and then we comment on 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:59.560
 him about blaze as I can find it or 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:02.220
 you are not yet 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:05.810
 not available 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:05.810
 are not available for 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:11.410
 for the wings maybe maybe in the 

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:13.600
 final version let's see 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:16.000
 so guys do not pass the truth is that 

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:18.040
 I do not understand why he is there with the 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.620
 lighter we just activated it on 

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:21.100
 portal and then let's see here where I 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:22.600
 send 

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:25.419
 it is assumed that she sends me my cave 

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:26.550
 and then this new one I do not know where I'm going to 

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:29.210
 send 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:29.210
 okay 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:44.120
 you 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:44.120
 or that I already see video 

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:51.000
 I see, he put me in the cave, it seems that 

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:51.000
 yes he was going to appear on the outside 

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:58.760
 and we go back 

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:07.620
 I think it occurred to me that it seemed like 

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:09.830
 I'm doing well but guys, tell me why 

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:09.830

00:06:45.009 --> 00:06:57.310
