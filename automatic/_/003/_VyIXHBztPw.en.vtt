they're there feeling settled and healed
in<00:02:41.850> their<00:02:41.970> body<00:02:42.180> so<00:02:42.510> we<00:02:43.230> we<00:02:43.709> modified

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
in their body so we we modified

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.070 
in their body so we we modified
treatments<00:02:44.700> we<00:02:44.850> work<00:02:45.120> with<00:02:45.299> the<00:02:45.810> Western

treatments we work with the Western
medical<00:02:46.380> system<00:02:46.680> as<00:02:46.799> much<00:02:46.920> as<00:02:47.100> we<00:02:47.220> can<00:02:47.430> to

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
medical system as much as we can to

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.539 
medical system as much as we can to

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
we deal what makes us unique is that

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.720 
we deal what makes us unique is that
we're<00:02:54.630> able<00:02:54.750> to<00:02:55.019> use<00:02:55.170> a<00:02:55.440> vidiq<00:02:55.860> approach<00:02:56.310> and

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
we're able to use a vidiq approach and

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.520 
we're able to use a vidiq approach and
all<00:02:57.209> the<00:02:57.330> other<00:02:57.480> tools<00:02:57.690> we<00:02:57.900> have<00:02:58.080> to<00:02:58.320> really

modalities are quite varied especially
in<00:03:13.950> the<00:03:14.040> scope<00:03:14.250> of<00:03:14.400> naturopathic<00:03:14.670> medicine

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:15.320 
in the scope of naturopathic medicine

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.300 
in the scope of naturopathic medicine
specifically<00:03:16.320> this<00:03:16.380> clinic<00:03:16.739> we<00:03:16.829> focus<00:03:17.190> a<00:03:17.250> lot

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
specifically this clinic we focus a lot

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.640 
specifically this clinic we focus a lot
on<00:03:17.430> intravenous<00:03:18.420> injections<00:03:18.900> and<00:03:19.290> vitamin

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
on intravenous injections and vitamin

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.350 
on intravenous injections and vitamin
drips<00:03:19.860> do<00:03:20.310> a<00:03:20.340> lot<00:03:20.519> of<00:03:20.549> something<00:03:20.790> called

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
drips do a lot of something called

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:22.970 
drips do a lot of something called
neural<00:03:21.630> pole<00:03:21.810> therapy<00:03:22.320> which<00:03:22.530> is<00:03:22.560> a<00:03:22.680> pain

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
neural pole therapy which is a pain

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.640 
neural pole therapy which is a pain
treatment<00:03:23.700> technique<00:03:24.090> involving<00:03:24.650> multiple

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
treatment technique involving multiple

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.410 
treatment technique involving multiple
superficial<00:03:26.280> injections<00:03:26.970> much<00:03:27.239> like

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
superficial injections much like

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.890 
superficial injections much like
acupuncture<00:03:28.110> but<00:03:28.290> with<00:03:28.470> a<00:03:28.890> solution<00:03:29.780> we<00:03:30.780> also

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
acupuncture but with a solution we also

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.390 
acupuncture but with a solution we also
do<00:03:31.140> something<00:03:31.410> called<00:03:31.500> neural<00:03:31.829> therapy<00:03:31.860> which

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
do something called neural therapy which

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.100 
do something called neural therapy which
is<00:03:32.549> very<00:03:32.730> similar<00:03:32.940> to<00:03:33.060> neural<00:03:33.420> pillow<00:03:33.660> therapy

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110 
is very similar to neural pillow therapy

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:37.190 
is very similar to neural pillow therapy
again<00:03:34.590> for<00:03:35.220> pain<00:03:35.430> treatments<00:03:36.030> for<00:03:36.269> endocrine

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
again for pain treatments for endocrine

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.330 
again for pain treatments for endocrine
dysfunction<00:03:37.410> for

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
dysfunction for

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.820 
dysfunction for
regulation<00:03:39.080> so<00:03:40.080> those<00:03:40.260> are<00:03:40.379> that's<00:03:40.530> more<00:03:40.709> of

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:40.830 
regulation so those are that's more of

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:42.650 
regulation so those are that's more of
my<00:03:40.950> passion<00:03:41.129> for<00:03:41.610> the<00:03:41.790> treatment<00:03:42.209> is<00:03:42.360> getting

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
my passion for the treatment is getting

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.990 
my passion for the treatment is getting
to<00:03:42.810> bringing<00:03:43.709> these<00:03:43.860> tools<00:03:44.220> that<00:03:44.400> we<00:03:44.730> can<00:03:44.849> see

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
to bringing these tools that we can see

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.970 
to bringing these tools that we can see
some<00:03:45.120> profound<00:03:45.450> effects<00:03:45.840> from<00:03:46.080> treating<00:03:46.800> the

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
some profound effects from treating the

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:48.410 
some profound effects from treating the
root<00:03:47.129> cause<00:03:47.370> of<00:03:47.400> why<00:03:47.670> things<00:03:47.910> are<00:03:48.060> coming<00:03:48.239> out

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
root cause of why things are coming out

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:51.199 
root cause of why things are coming out
so<00:03:49.080> the<00:03:49.739> core<00:03:50.099> of<00:03:50.129> our<00:03:50.400> principle<00:03:50.849> is<00:03:50.970> always

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
so the core of our principle is always

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:54.320 
so the core of our principle is always
to<00:03:51.569> work<00:03:52.019> on<00:03:52.730> nutritional<00:03:53.730> and<00:03:53.910> lifestyle

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.330 
to work on nutritional and lifestyle

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:56.750 
to work on nutritional and lifestyle
factors<00:03:54.510> first<00:03:55.069> than<00:03:56.069> addressing<00:03:56.370> stress

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
factors first than addressing stress

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.220 
factors first than addressing stress
components<00:03:57.330> and<00:03:57.480> how<00:03:57.540> we<00:03:57.599> relate<00:03:57.900> to<00:03:57.959> stress

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
components and how we relate to stress

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:01.280 
components and how we relate to stress
and<00:03:58.590> then<00:03:59.280> tying<00:03:59.549> that<00:03:59.700> together<00:03:59.879> with<00:04:00.360> these

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
and then tying that together with these

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.400 
and then tying that together with these
more<00:04:01.860> practical<00:04:02.670> application<00:04:03.180> treatments<00:04:03.660> to

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.410 
more practical application treatments to
