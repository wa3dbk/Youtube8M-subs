00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.330 
catastrophe cosmetic but I like the
consistency<00:02:06.090> of<00:02:06.479> this<00:02:06.780> better<00:02:07.140> this<00:02:07.649> one<00:02:07.950> has

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
consistency of this better this one has

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.249 
consistency of this better this one has
a<00:02:08.369> similar<00:02:08.910> formula<00:02:09.360> with<00:02:09.509> calamine<00:02:09.959> being

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
a similar formula with calamine being

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.220 
a similar formula with calamine being
the<00:02:10.440> main<00:02:10.619> ingredient<00:02:11.360> but<00:02:12.360> it's<00:02:12.959> a<00:02:13.110> much

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
the main ingredient but it's a much

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.260 
the main ingredient but it's a much
creamier<00:02:13.709> consistency<00:02:13.740> with<00:02:14.610> the<00:02:14.640> rose<00:02:14.940> clay

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
creamier consistency with the rose clay

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.660 
creamier consistency with the rose clay
in<00:02:15.330> the<00:02:15.510> rose<00:02:15.720> oil<00:02:16.020> and<00:02:16.440> so<00:02:16.980> it<00:02:17.099> sticks<00:02:17.400> to<00:02:17.610> your

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
in the rose oil and so it sticks to your

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.760 
in the rose oil and so it sticks to your
skin<00:02:17.760> very<00:02:18.270> nicely<00:02:18.599> there's<00:02:18.990> no<00:02:19.260> problem<00:02:19.680> at
