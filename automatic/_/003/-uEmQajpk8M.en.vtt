 hi to all the boys here in joseph 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:07.830
 gamer we're here on assassin's creed or 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.710
 best in the multiplayer of this game and 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.400
 we will immediately make a quick game then 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:15.150
 we are looking for a session 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.359
 let's hope it doesn't take too long 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.730
 attempt to connect to the session 

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:24.510
 guys I played multiplayer on 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:26.519
 this game only once for that though 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.080
 we play because when I wanted to start 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.810
 the single player 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.640
 so I was wrong and the second months 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.980
 he says okay I find myself doing one 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:39.510
 game and then I didn't play then 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.790
 I also have to review the keys a little better 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.520
 I think they are the usual single 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.710
 player good or bad let's see if in the 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.260
 meanwhile waiting for player choice but 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.930
 we are 8 out of 8 where I had to 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:01:00.660
 choose the player there is the 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:01:05.010
 character I think about how we are children fi 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:07.340
 b 10 the session is about to begin 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.350
 hopefully because we can't stay here 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:13.560
 thousand thousand hours and where we are here 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:17.460
 of the animus own find you kill the 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:20.159
 first got this here with the Cappelluzzo 7 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:24.630
 current kids or I don't remember 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:29.659
 just then everything should go if 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:34.110

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:37.400

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:42.720
 how close but I know we are close 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:46.890

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:50.030

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:54.600

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:58.799
 is the new pursuer and where it is 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:01.860
 this other salt too you go run 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:05.820
 majesty matteo I don't understand her anyway 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:12.060
 sincerely because it then dematerializes 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:15.060
 does not run, does he dematerialize, no wait 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:21.060
 here it is he is he or I'm telling you that 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:23.160

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.349

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.810
 head that killed a hundred points 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:30.720
 oh well they were that I know 500 points went 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:34.620
 also good but a little and a hundred points 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:37.560
 nothing so killing was 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.209
 completely useless what is that a 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:44.160
 the one that killed me very well there 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:46.680
 revenge ok launched no but okay 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:50.730

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:55.730
 here it is not here the mannaggia salis ali 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:59.670
 fast move you have to move fast 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.840
 fast we throw the daggers the dagger the 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.930
 fist 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.790
 damn the shame but how 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:09.060
 fuck you throw the dagger go go 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:11.550

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:15.409

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:29.330

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:31.820
 if not, here it is 6 million but revenge here 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:36.260
 basic killing plus 100 ab and revenge 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:38.630
 in all 150 abc rq but what a name 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.260
 this now we have a 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:42.910
 captain 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:48.830
 apparently a sea wolf 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:52.120
 apparently contract lost because who 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:59.260
 that's what you want 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:04:04.580
 I can't believe it but shut up 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:07.640
 fool risus abundat ore stultorum e 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:15.609

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:22.940
 courtly levels that has been what is over 

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:25.460
 is already sought after are last guys are 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:27.890
 last you can not do this video are 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:30.620
 last he feels so pigo because he is 

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:38.000
 was the first I imagine ranking 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:40.640
 titles but because session events that do not 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.370
 also reaches level 2 well points 

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:49.070
 I abstergo in all 116 plus 16 that it wants 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:49.700
 say progress counts a vote you want 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:53.620
 say a void 

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:55.640

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:57.350
 guys I don't know we do another one 

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:59.360
 maybe this is the first video that lasts 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:00.500
 about 5 minutes I don't want it to last 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:04.220
