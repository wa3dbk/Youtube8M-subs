00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:13.620
 hello to all and welcome 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.690
 in the first video first to a 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.000
 three-dimensional mission of mastitis 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.529
 wink always with what they have 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.369
 faithful of the site that goes this time 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:26.130
 get out of his TV hardly see anything 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.260
 that's fine we decided to make you a 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.730
 this video just the goods for 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.969
 to laugh for his musette to make a 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.110
 small three-dimensional video so for 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.730
 watch the video 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.980
 simply it is enough for you 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.329
 equip with three-dimensional glasses 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.200
 it's special granny glasses from 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.850
 ycc provide 4d equip you with 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.410
 three-dimensional glasses so this is the 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.730
 leaving that red blue glasses 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.660
 kellogg's packages can only 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:54.809
 largely enough not need 3d screen 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.940
 at 1500 2000 euros the simple glasses 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.280
 plastic that can be found anywhere 1 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.890
 euro will suffice to appreciate the three 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:08.850
 dimensions of this video the good video 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:09.960
 to all so it is true that it makes 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.729
 for a long time we had not done 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.220
 videos on youtube this is entirely 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:17.580
 the fault that confided to be lucid 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:20.670
 who boycotted who boycotted the 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:25.140
 emissions and that always tells me nothing 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:27.090
 very good so we continue well 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.439
 obviously unnecessary shipments before 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.790
 to come on this because we have a 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.400
 announces to its important to do at this 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.650
 subject we will talk about the unreal 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.710

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:40.630

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:47.500
 seeing that it kisses our ills these 

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:49.960

 with my son is there the checkbooks 

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:58.960
