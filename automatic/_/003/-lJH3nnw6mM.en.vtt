00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:29.960 
times to get all the dirt out like I
said<00:04:28.289> this<00:04:28.440> bike<00:04:28.680> is<00:04:28.890> not<00:04:28.919> leaking<00:04:29.400> at<00:04:29.550> all<00:04:29.669> so

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:29.970 
said this bike is not leaking at all so

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:32.660 
said this bike is not leaking at all so
it<00:04:30.870> doesn't<00:04:31.140> have<00:04:31.260> any<00:04:31.470> dirt<00:04:31.680> so

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:32.670 
it doesn't have any dirt so

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:35.570 
it doesn't have any dirt so
there<00:04:32.760> you<00:04:32.850> go<00:04:33.170> that's<00:04:34.170> pretty<00:04:34.380> much<00:04:34.590> it<00:04:34.800> and

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580 
there you go that's pretty much it and

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:36.770 
there you go that's pretty much it and
then<00:04:35.700> what<00:04:35.850> you're<00:04:35.970> going<00:04:36.120> to<00:04:36.210> do<00:04:36.360> is<00:04:36.510> take

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:36.780 
then what you're going to do is take

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:40.430 
then what you're going to do is take
your<00:04:36.960> rag<00:04:37.770> wipe<00:04:38.640> any<00:04:39.030> excess<00:04:39.360> oil<00:04:39.900> that<00:04:40.170> might

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:40.440 
your rag wipe any excess oil that might

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:45.260 
your rag wipe any excess oil that might
have<00:04:40.680> come<00:04:40.950> out<00:04:41.130> over<00:04:41.370> here<00:04:41.900> and<00:04:44.270> you're

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.270 
have come out over here and you're

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.110 
have come out over here and you're
almost<00:04:45.600> done

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.120 
almost done

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:51.050 
almost done
next<00:04:48.120> what<00:04:48.270> you're<00:04:48.390> going<00:04:48.570> to<00:04:48.600> do<00:04:48.780> is<00:04:49.910> get<00:04:50.910> the

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
next what you're going to do is get the

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:54.500 
next what you're going to do is get the
bike<00:04:51.210> off<00:04:51.420> the<00:04:51.570> stand<00:04:53.000> walk<00:04:54.000> it<00:04:54.180> back<00:04:54.300> and

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:54.510 
bike off the stand walk it back and

00:04:54.510 --> 00:05:04.760 
bike off the stand walk it back and
forth<00:04:54.750> a<00:04:54.870> little<00:04:54.900> bit<00:05:03.080> give<00:05:04.080> the<00:05:04.200> suspension<00:05:04.710> a

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:04.770 
forth a little bit give the suspension a

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:20.030 
forth a little bit give the suspension a
good<00:05:04.950> die<00:05:05.160> couple<00:05:05.790> times<00:05:18.050> and<00:05:19.050> then<00:05:19.290> check<00:05:19.860> for

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:20.040 
good die couple times and then check for

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:22.790 
good die couple times and then check for
any<00:05:20.220> leaks<00:05:20.690> usually<00:05:21.690> a<00:05:21.840> little<00:05:22.380> a<00:05:22.470> small

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:22.800 
any leaks usually a little a small

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.400 
any leaks usually a little a small
amount<00:05:23.040> of<00:05:23.130> oil<00:05:23.370> over<00:05:24.240> here<00:05:24.420> is<00:05:24.660> fine<00:05:24.990> because

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:25.410 
amount of oil over here is fine because

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:27.580 
amount of oil over here is fine because
when<00:05:26.040> you<00:05:26.160> inserted<00:05:26.640> that<00:05:26.760> piece<00:05:27.000> of<00:05:27.150> plastic

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:27.590 
when you inserted that piece of plastic

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:30.410 
when you inserted that piece of plastic
in<00:05:28.590> between<00:05:28.620> the<00:05:29.130> seal<00:05:29.340> and<00:05:29.640> the<00:05:29.940> fork<00:05:30.300> like

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:30.420 
in between the seal and the fork like

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:33.410 
in between the seal and the fork like
you<00:05:31.110> broke<00:05:31.410> the<00:05:31.590> seal<00:05:31.800> so<00:05:32.490> a<00:05:32.520> small<00:05:33.090> amount<00:05:33.120> of

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:33.420 
you broke the seal so a small amount of

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:37.370 
you broke the seal so a small amount of
oil<00:05:33.720> here<00:05:34.170> is<00:05:34.380> okay<00:05:35.090> it'll<00:05:36.090> take<00:05:36.330> the<00:05:36.840> seal<00:05:37.050> to

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:37.380 
oil here is okay it'll take the seal to

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:41.150 
oil here is okay it'll take the seal to
seal<00:05:37.920> up<00:05:38.400> a<00:05:38.880> few<00:05:39.360> minutes<00:05:39.920> what<00:05:40.920> I<00:05:40.950> usually

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:41.160 
seal up a few minutes what I usually

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.820 
seal up a few minutes what I usually
like<00:05:41.340> to<00:05:41.550> do<00:05:41.640> is<00:05:41.790> I<00:05:41.880> like<00:05:42.000> to<00:05:42.030> do<00:05:42.510> this<00:05:42.740> put<00:05:43.740> the

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:43.830 
like to do is I like to do this put the

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:49.730 
like to do is I like to do this put the
seal<00:05:44.070> back<00:05:44.280> on<00:05:47.690> put<00:05:48.690> this<00:05:48.810> cover<00:05:49.020> back<00:05:49.260> on<00:05:49.560> the

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:49.740 
seal back on put this cover back on the

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:51.860 
seal back on put this cover back on the
bike<00:05:49.920> and<00:05:50.340> then<00:05:50.760> you<00:05:51.000> know<00:05:51.120> take<00:05:51.360> the<00:05:51.390> bike<00:05:51.660> out

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:51.870 
bike and then you know take the bike out

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:53.180 
bike and then you know take the bike out
for<00:05:52.200> a<00:05:52.230> spin

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:53.190 
for a spin

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:56.480 
for a spin
or<00:05:53.700> take<00:05:54.030> it<00:05:54.150> for<00:05:54.300> like<00:05:54.480> a<00:05:54.510> 15<00:05:55.410> 15<00:05:56.040> 20<00:05:56.280> minute

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:56.490 
or take it for like a 15 15 20 minute

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:59.630 
or take it for like a 15 15 20 minute
ride<00:05:56.670> and<00:05:57.020> by<00:05:58.020> the<00:05:58.080> time<00:05:58.440> you<00:05:58.740> you're<00:05:59.460> done

00:05:59.630 --> 00:05:59.640 
ride and by the time you you're done

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:01.670 
ride and by the time you you're done
with<00:05:59.790> your<00:05:59.910> ride<00:06:00.150> the<00:06:01.020> seal<00:06:01.260> would<00:06:01.470> have

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:01.680 
with your ride the seal would have

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:04.340 
with your ride the seal would have
sealed<00:06:02.310> up<00:06:02.490> really<00:06:02.820> well<00:06:03.000> and<00:06:03.180> nine<00:06:04.110> out<00:06:04.320> of

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:04.350 
sealed up really well and nine out of

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:08.660 
sealed up really well and nine out of
ten<00:06:04.620> times<00:06:05.300> this<00:06:06.300> will<00:06:06.890> resolve<00:06:07.890> your<00:06:08.160> leaky

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:08.670 
ten times this will resolve your leaky

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:12.790 
ten times this will resolve your leaky
fork<00:06:09.330> seals<00:06:09.680> this<00:06:10.680> procedure<00:06:11.580> works<00:06:11.910> on

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:12.800 
fork seals this procedure works on

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:15.860 
fork seals this procedure works on
upside<00:06:13.800> down<00:06:13.980> forks<00:06:14.460> or<00:06:14.730> traditional<00:06:15.510> forks

upside down forks or traditional forks

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:19.370 
upside down forks or traditional forks
and<00:06:16.110> it's<00:06:16.860> really<00:06:17.220> simple<00:06:17.430> to<00:06:17.640> do<00:06:17.820> so<00:06:18.380> if
