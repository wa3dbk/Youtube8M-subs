and tuck it inside and make a small knot

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.729 
and tuck it inside and make a small knot
so<00:02:33.370> it<00:02:33.489> doesn't<00:02:33.730> come<00:02:33.819> out<00:02:34.080> and<00:02:35.080> that<00:02:35.380> is<00:02:35.590> how

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739 
so it doesn't come out and that is how

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:41.100 
so it doesn't come out and that is how
you<00:02:35.799> make<00:02:36.099> the<00:02:36.370> toe<00:02:36.549> of<00:02:36.880> the<00:02:36.940> sock<00:02:40.110> there's

you make the toe of the sock there's
different<00:02:41.500> ways<00:02:41.620> this<00:02:42.010> this<00:02:42.880> technique<00:02:43.269> will

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
different ways this this technique will

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.610 
different ways this this technique will
give<00:02:43.480> you<00:02:43.720> a<00:02:43.920> point<00:02:44.920> dear<00:02:45.220> kind<00:02:45.549> of<00:02:45.670> tell<00:02:46.620> the
