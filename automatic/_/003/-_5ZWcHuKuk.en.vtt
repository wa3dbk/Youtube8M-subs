and<00:00:10.679> you've<00:00:10.830> been<00:00:11.040> able<00:00:11.160> to<00:00:11.309> do<00:00:11.490> it<00:00:11.639> since<00:00:11.880> you

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
and you've been able to do it since you

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.450 
and you've been able to do it since you
were<00:00:12.120> a<00:00:12.179> little<00:00:12.240> guy<00:00:12.719> or<00:00:13.049> a<00:00:13.110> little<00:00:13.500> girl

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
were a little guy or a little girl

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.439 
were a little guy or a little girl
however<00:00:15.500> there<00:00:16.500> are<00:00:16.529> some<00:00:16.890> shoelaces<00:00:17.580> that

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
however there are some shoelaces that

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.570 
however there are some shoelaces that
are<00:00:18.810> really<00:00:19.230> kind<00:00:19.470> of<00:00:19.590> tough<00:00:19.830> to<00:00:20.010> keep<00:00:20.160> tied

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
are really kind of tough to keep tied

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.029 
are really kind of tough to keep tied
and<00:00:20.880> I'm<00:00:20.970> not<00:00:21.180> sure<00:00:21.420> why<00:00:21.600> but<00:00:22.050> on<00:00:22.380> my<00:00:22.800> work

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
and I'm not sure why but on my work

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:23.660 
and I'm not sure why but on my work
boots

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
boots

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.359 
boots
I<00:00:23.699> had<00:00:24.600> one<00:00:25.050> heck<00:00:25.500> of<00:00:25.529> a<00:00:25.740> time<00:00:26.010> actually

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
I had one heck of a time actually

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.609 
I had one heck of a time actually
keeping<00:00:27.060> these<00:00:27.449> shoelaces<00:00:27.960> tied<00:00:28.380> they

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
keeping these shoelaces tied they

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.919 
keeping these shoelaces tied they
constantly<00:00:29.039> come<00:00:29.310> undone<00:00:29.640> so<00:00:30.359> I<00:00:30.390> did<00:00:30.779> the

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
constantly come undone so I did the

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:37.250 
constantly come undone so I did the
traditional<00:00:31.700> knot<00:00:32.700> in<00:00:33.180> which<00:00:33.960> you<00:00:35.149> tie<00:00:36.260> the

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
traditional knot in which you tie the

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:44.479 
traditional knot in which you tie the
knot<00:00:39.110> like<00:00:40.110> this<00:00:41.510> and<00:00:42.530> then<00:00:43.530> you<00:00:43.739> simply<00:00:44.040> go

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
knot like this and then you simply go

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.279 
knot like this and then you simply go
here<00:00:44.520> and<00:00:45.059> you<00:00:45.120> tie<00:00:45.420> a<00:00:45.450> second<00:00:46.170> overhand<00:00:46.649> knot

00:00:48.279 --> 00:00:48.289 
here and you tie a second overhand knot

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:53.389 
here and you tie a second overhand knot
like<00:00:49.289> that<00:00:49.350> and<00:00:50.449> while<00:00:51.449> that<00:00:51.629> does<00:00:51.870> work<00:00:52.399> it

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
like that and while that does work it

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:54.770 
like that and while that does work it
makes<00:00:53.879> for<00:00:54.030> an<00:00:54.149> app<00:00:54.300> that's<00:00:54.539> almost

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
makes for an app that's almost

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.569 
makes for an app that's almost
impossible<00:00:54.989> to<00:00:55.590> get<00:00:55.710> out<00:00:55.890> once<00:00:56.160> it<00:00:56.340> really

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
impossible to get out once it really

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.010 
impossible to get out once it really
gets<00:00:56.760> tightened<00:00:57.149> down<00:00:57.210> so<00:00:58.520> instead<00:00:59.520> of<00:00:59.579> that

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:00.020 
gets tightened down so instead of that

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.619 
gets tightened down so instead of that
I'm<00:01:01.020> gonna<00:01:01.199> show<00:01:01.559> you<00:01:01.910> first<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.090> traditional

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
I'm gonna show you first the traditional

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.530 
I'm gonna show you first the traditional
way<00:01:03.809> you<00:01:04.199> normally<00:01:04.650> have<00:01:04.890> knots<00:01:05.790> tied<00:01:06.210> and

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
way you normally have knots tied and

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.030 
way you normally have knots tied and
then<00:01:07.110> I'm<00:01:07.229> going<00:01:07.380> to<00:01:07.439> show<00:01:07.590> you<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.860> way<00:01:08.010> that

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
then I'm going to show you the way that

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.840 
then I'm going to show you the way that
I<00:01:08.580> saw<00:01:09.060> on<00:01:09.330> another<00:01:10.049> person's<00:01:10.470> video<00:01:10.799> on<00:01:11.700> the

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
I saw on another person's video on the

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.600 
I saw on another person's video on the
way<00:01:11.970> that<00:01:12.150> they<00:01:12.240> tie<00:01:12.510> their<00:01:12.750> knot<00:01:12.960> so<00:01:13.610> first

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
way that they tie their knot so first

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.160 
way that they tie their knot so first
thing<00:01:14.850> you<00:01:14.939> do<00:01:15.060> is<00:01:15.240> you<00:01:15.360> tie<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.600> overhand

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
thing you do is you tie the overhand

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.469 
thing you do is you tie the overhand
knot<00:01:16.439> then<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.340> second<00:01:17.729> thing<00:01:17.880> you<00:01:18.060> do<00:01:18.180> is<00:01:18.360> you

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
knot then the second thing you do is you

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.410 
knot then the second thing you do is you
take<00:01:18.659> a<00:01:18.720> loop<00:01:19.049> now<00:01:19.950> traditionally<00:01:20.909> you're

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
take a loop now traditionally you're

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.550 
take a loop now traditionally you're
going<00:01:21.720> to<00:01:21.869> go<00:01:22.110> clockwise<00:01:22.979> around<00:01:24.229> when<00:01:25.229> you

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
going to go clockwise around when you

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.780 
going to go clockwise around when you
tie<00:01:26.549> this<00:01:26.610> knot<00:01:27.170> back<00:01:28.170> through<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.680> loop<00:01:28.890> and

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
tie this knot back through the loop and

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.060 
tie this knot back through the loop and
then<00:01:29.850> you're<00:01:30.060> going<00:01:30.150> to<00:01:30.210> pull<00:01:30.509> tight<00:01:30.829> that's<00:01:31.829> a

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
then you're going to pull tight that's a

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.210 
then you're going to pull tight that's a
traditional<00:01:32.610> knot<00:01:32.820> that's<00:01:33.750> not<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.409> way<00:01:34.560> that

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
traditional knot that's not the way that

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.300 
traditional knot that's not the way that
I'm<00:01:35.579> gonna<00:01:35.759> do<00:01:35.939> it<00:01:36.030> for<00:01:36.210> you<00:01:36.329> today<00:01:36.950> I've<00:01:37.950> tried

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
I'm gonna do it for you today I've tried

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.520 
I'm gonna do it for you today I've tried
it<00:01:38.520> and<00:01:38.759> it<00:01:38.909> just<00:01:38.939> plain<00:01:39.390> comes<00:01:39.720> untied<00:01:40.170> every

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
it and it just plain comes untied every

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.899 
it and it just plain comes untied every
single<00:01:40.890> time<00:01:41.100> I<00:01:41.130> use<00:01:41.460> it<00:01:43.430> the<00:01:44.430> way<00:01:44.579> that<00:01:44.759> I'm

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
single time I use it the way that I'm

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.120 
single time I use it the way that I'm
going<00:01:45.090> to<00:01:45.149> do<00:01:45.299> it<00:01:45.450> is<00:01:45.689> you<00:01:45.930> take<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.350> loop<00:01:46.590> but

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
going to do it is you take the loop but

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.639 
going to do it is you take the loop but
instead<00:01:47.460> of<00:01:47.610> going<00:01:47.880> clockwise<00:01:48.509> you<00:01:49.470> go

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
instead of going clockwise you go

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.999 
instead of going clockwise you go
counterclockwise<00:01:50.360> and<00:01:51.360> then<00:01:52.110> back<00:01:52.710> through

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
counterclockwise and then back through

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.190 
counterclockwise and then back through
the<00:01:53.189> loop<00:01:53.399> here<00:01:53.939> you're<00:01:54.540> actually<00:01:54.960> making

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
the loop here you're actually making

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.560 
the loop here you're actually making
more<00:01:55.619> of<00:01:55.649> a<00:01:55.770> figure<00:01:56.130> eight<00:01:56.340> knot<00:01:56.399> instead<00:01:57.329> of

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
more of a figure eight knot instead of

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.389 
more of a figure eight knot instead of
just<00:01:57.750> an<00:01:57.869> overhand<00:01:58.320> knot<00:01:58.439> and<00:01:58.590> then<00:01:58.979> you<00:01:59.130> pull

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
just an overhand knot and then you pull

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:04.749 
just an overhand knot and then you pull
it<00:01:59.549> tight<00:01:59.990> this<00:02:00.990> knot<00:02:01.380> stays<00:02:02.340> tied<00:02:02.820> and<00:02:03.270> it

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:04.759 
it tight this knot stays tied and it

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:07.789 
it tight this knot stays tied and it
stays<00:02:05.759> tied<00:02:06.119> so<00:02:06.390> effectively<00:02:07.079> I<00:02:07.110> almost<00:02:07.409> never

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
stays tied so effectively I almost never

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.710 
stays tied so effectively I almost never
untie<00:02:08.280> these<00:02:08.340> boots<00:02:08.789> because<00:02:09.270> I've<00:02:09.479> got

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
untie these boots because I've got

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.559 
untie these boots because I've got
zippers<00:02:10.349> on<00:02:10.500> the<00:02:10.530> sides<00:02:10.830> of<00:02:11.039> them<00:02:11.190> but<00:02:12.060> this

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
zippers on the sides of them but this

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.340
