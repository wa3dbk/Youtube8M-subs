 anyway and I ridicule a lipstick 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.560
 k 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:09.690
 from little gave a little can you 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.640
 precisely pronounce and then becoming the 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.250
 you insert it so you see the logo 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.920

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.240
 find him really super nice I will in the 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.040
 lift swatching 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:23.430
 I have it your bearers very often 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:26.070
 really praise the beautiful brown leather 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:29.810
 new color is really great and me 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:32.640
 wear it really super often and it came 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.140
 twice for 39 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.220
 and then I have a little less 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.490
 interestingly purchased 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:40.350
 kleenex too soft white handkerchiefs on my 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:42.090
 school with low vocals we have bags 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:49.410
 needed and my goal so proud 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:51.750
 bought a new one and it came to 79 cents 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:54.630
 then move on to the lima that is the 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.100
 I bought something for him and hasselter and 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.680
 so first of all that this one 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:00.600
 blending brush I actually live 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:03.510
 buy it on Saturday and the hema with me 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:06.120
 but all those eight were really bad 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:09.060
 skewed and if or yes she will put them whole 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:11.040
 very wrong so we would rather not 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.690
 and I think I looked something and like 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.060
 that if they have a decent one there 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:17.760
 because I had advice from you and 3 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.350
 op en limburg and we are going how we go 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.570
 you sex with my eye shadow i had to 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:22.950
 blending out and actually really true yes 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:25.290
 and that video is also a bit more intense 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.610
 but I don't really have one yet 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.770
 good fluffy blending brush 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:30.420
 so I bought it from the hema and 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:33.239
 I think it's very nice 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:36.930
 the hairs still well together 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:38.610
 and this I paid the three euros then 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.830
 I am still in the jug stand and hasselt 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:43.380
 and first of all I have is essence 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:45.360
 So lipstick from the regular range 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:47.520

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:59.070
 few soft color with super many small ones 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:01.670
 that glitters is in fact just different 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:01.670

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:07.170
 this is him i think he is super beautiful 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:08.610
 I also got him a bit harder yesterday 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:11.970
 I bought it 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:13.380

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:14.960

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:17.960
