00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:05.580 
but it's better than buying you know
spending<00:02:04.390> ten<00:02:04.570> bucks<00:02:04.780> on<00:02:04.930> batteries<00:02:05.350> every

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
spending ten bucks on batteries every

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.920 
spending ten bucks on batteries every
two<00:02:05.770> months<00:02:05.950> so<00:02:06.280> go<00:02:06.700> ahead<00:02:06.910> and<00:02:07.150> spent<00:02:07.840> the

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:07.930 
two months so go ahead and spent the

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:10.920 
two months so go ahead and spent the
money<00:02:08.110> on<00:02:08.290> it<00:02:08.320> basically<00:02:09.390> so<00:02:10.390> here's<00:02:10.570> how<00:02:10.750> its

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:10.930 
money on it basically so here's how its

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:12.660 
money on it basically so here's how its
works<00:02:11.200> so<00:02:11.470> you<00:02:11.530> only<00:02:11.800> have<00:02:11.980> four<00:02:12.220> buttons<00:02:12.550> on

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
works so you only have four buttons on

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.600 
works so you only have four buttons on
here<00:02:13.060> this<00:02:13.840> is<00:02:13.900> your<00:02:14.080> on/off<00:02:14.230> button

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
here this is your on/off button

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.650 
here this is your on/off button
you<00:02:16.000> have<00:02:16.180> your<00:02:16.420> calibration<00:02:18.360> this<00:02:19.360> is<00:02:19.540> the

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
you have your calibration this is the

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.860 
you have your calibration this is the
zero<00:02:19.960> of<00:02:20.020> the<00:02:20.110> scale<00:02:20.440> and<00:02:20.770> this<00:02:21.220> is<00:02:21.340> your<00:02:21.460> units

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
zero of the scale and this is your units

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.670 
zero of the scale and this is your units
you<00:02:22.870> have<00:02:22.900> carrots<00:02:24.480> Alice's<00:02:25.480> grams<00:02:26.320> and

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
you have carrots Alice's grams and

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.090 
you have carrots Alice's grams and
greens<00:02:27.840> probably<00:02:28.840> 99%<00:02:29.380> of<00:02:29.620> people<00:02:29.740> buying

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
greens probably 99% of people buying

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.090 
greens probably 99% of people buying
this<00:02:30.280> you're<00:02:30.460> using<00:02:30.610> it<00:02:30.760> for<00:02:30.940> gunpowder<00:02:31.120> so

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
this you're using it for gunpowder so

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.360 
this you're using it for gunpowder so
you<00:02:33.100> switch<00:02:33.370> this<00:02:33.520> to<00:02:33.730> two<00:02:34.120> GN<00:02:35.070> G<00:02:36.070> and<00:02:36.250> his

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
you switch this to two GN G and his

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.830 
you switch this to two GN G and his
greens<00:02:36.700> so<00:02:38.670> you<00:02:39.670> switch<00:02:39.910> that<00:02:40.120> right<00:02:40.330> here<00:02:40.570> so

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
greens so you switch that right here so

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.240 
greens so you switch that right here so
right<00:02:40.990> now<00:02:41.140> it's<00:02:41.320> on<00:02:41.410> G<00:02:41.710> n<00:02:41.800> don't<00:02:42.040> know<00:02:42.130> if<00:02:42.190> you

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
right now it's on G n don't know if you

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.650 
right now it's on G n don't know if you
can<00:02:42.370> read<00:02:42.610> it<00:02:42.760> but<00:02:42.790> that's<00:02:43.480> G<00:02:43.870> in<00:02:44.110> for<00:02:44.440> greens

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
can read it but that's G in for greens

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.460 
can read it but that's G in for greens
now<00:02:46.660> the<00:02:46.720> other<00:02:46.930> one<00:02:47.140> is<00:02:47.260> grams<00:02:49.140> if<00:02:50.140> you<00:02:50.320> have<00:02:50.440> a

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
now the other one is grams if you have a

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:51.900 
now the other one is grams if you have a
little<00:02:50.680> G<00:02:50.950> right<00:02:51.160> there<00:02:51.400> and<00:02:51.490> if<00:02:51.580> you<00:02:51.670> can<00:02:51.760> see

you go so that's how long it takes to do

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:28.330 
you go so that's how long it takes to do
a<00:06:26.210> powder<00:06:26.480> charge<00:06:26.830> which<00:06:27.830> I<00:06:27.980> thought<00:06:28.220> is

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:28.340 
a powder charge which I thought is

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:29.980 
a powder charge which I thought is
really<00:06:28.460> nice<00:06:28.790> but<00:06:29.120> you<00:06:29.180> got<00:06:29.390> to<00:06:29.510> have<00:06:29.600> a<00:06:29.630> scale

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:29.990 
really nice but you got to have a scale
