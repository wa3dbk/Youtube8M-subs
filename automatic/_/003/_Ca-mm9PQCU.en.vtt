00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.470
 contributing to the flooding of the 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.170
 mainly the alligator river that 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.099
 overflowed the banks by 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.469
 kilometers 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.719
 and on Monday the waters arrived 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:19.020
 to flood the highway commander joão 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:21.990
 bar of spades to sp 255 that connects 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.820
 araraquara the good hope of the south in 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.730
 Yesterday late afternoon the flooding 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.920
 blocked the roadway police 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.609
 was on site to organize the 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.470
 Traffic 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.570
 due to heavy rains 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.870
 now is a time of caution one 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.969
 shift in the air a little sad 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:43.100
 due to a flood point in the 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:47.550
 highway and being cautious has to obey 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:49.050
 wait to reduce the rain 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.480
 flooding point is to follow 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.250
 car trip or think car not 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.320
 it was like passing by the 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.430
 way is not worth risking 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.530
 it can be worse 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.079
 how many people did not know the stretch 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.120
 congestion was flooding in the 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.949
 two senses was formed 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.290
 at the edge of the highway simply 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.560
 disappeared, making it difficult to identify 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:13.790
 where it began and where it ended 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:16.680
 it was all one thing 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:19.470
 according to the road police it is 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.909
 common to extend this stretch of sp 255 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.759
 between araraquara and good hope 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:26.369
 especially with heavy rains 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:29.490
 the trucks continue to cross 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.950
 cars prefer not to risk 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.290
 many gave up and began to return 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.930
 after all it was risky for the cars 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.810
 many motorists were caught 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.579

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:46.470

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:48.000
 to return from the trip has to cross 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.490
 I think it was crossed that the 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.409
 police is also holding to 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.299

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:59.939
 all flooded can not get back to 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.610
 House 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:04.950
 I was hoping to get home, I do not know 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.930
 another way we handle was also 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.989
 surprise we are here to give 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.790
 some 40 minutes already some drivers 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.770
 vehicles came down and became 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.620
 watching the flood 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:19.080
 the business was waiting to see if 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.240
 the situation improved, allowing 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:26.820
 everyone could return home in 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:29.310
 security where I was is the point 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:32.250
 most critical of the flooding the water is 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.970
 the thighs and the volume does not stop 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.220
 to increase 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.290
 rain also caused disruption in the 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.650
 washington luis highway at the time of 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.430

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.650
 capital city 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:46.650
 the driver of this cart could not 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.120
 to lose her control and ended 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.880
 in the central bed 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:54.770
 however no one was injured however a 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.770
