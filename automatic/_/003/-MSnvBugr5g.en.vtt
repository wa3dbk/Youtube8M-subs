00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
separate views and I'm also gonna figure

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.440 
separate views and I'm also gonna figure
out<00:00:33.300> which<00:00:34.160> camera<00:00:35.160> either<00:00:35.309> my<00:00:35.610> good

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
out which camera either my good

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.920 
out which camera either my good
powershot<00:00:37.320> camera<00:00:38.190> or<00:00:38.700> my<00:00:38.940> iPhone<00:00:39.090> 5s<00:00:39.750> is

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
powershot camera or my iPhone 5s is

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.110 
powershot camera or my iPhone 5s is
better<00:00:40.230> at<00:00:40.469> slo-mo<00:00:40.890> and<00:00:41.070> that<00:00:41.460> will<00:00:41.670> be

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
better at slo-mo and that will be

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.260 
better at slo-mo and that will be
helpful<00:00:42.960> in<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.350> future<00:00:43.649> but<00:00:44.280> anyway<00:00:44.640> today<00:00:45.210> I

the vendors are so yeah this set

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.229 
the vendors are so yeah this set
actually<00:02:41.890> did<00:02:42.370> a<00:02:42.400> lot<00:02:42.579> worse<00:02:42.790> than<00:02:42.819> I<00:02:43.060> thought

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:43.239 
actually did a lot worse than I thought

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:44.610 
actually did a lot worse than I thought
it<00:02:43.390> would<00:02:43.450> I<00:02:43.510> thought<00:02:43.750> this<00:02:43.930> set<00:02:44.170> was<00:02:44.290> a<00:02:44.319> lot

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
it would I thought this set was a lot

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.210 
it would I thought this set was a lot
stronger<00:02:44.950> but<00:02:45.340> apparently<00:02:46.329> not<00:02:46.540> so<00:02:47.500> anyway

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
stronger but apparently not so anyway
