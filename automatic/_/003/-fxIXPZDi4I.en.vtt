00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
system for a second now there's going to

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.660 
system for a second now there's going to
be<00:00:35.340> two<00:00:35.700> iterations<00:00:35.969> of<00:00:36.660> this<00:00:36.870> new<00:00:37.170> 3ds<00:00:37.680> you're

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
be two iterations of this new 3ds you're

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.000

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
the system so you'll no longer have to

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.210 
the system so you'll no longer have to
use<00:01:11.549> that<00:01:11.580> accessory<00:01:12.390> that<00:01:12.659> makes<00:01:13.320> your<00:01:13.740> 3ds

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
hand side it's kind of placed awkwardly

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.440 
hand side it's kind of placed awkwardly
if<00:01:22.140> you<00:01:22.350> ask<00:01:22.560> me<00:01:22.920> and<00:01:23.220> it<00:01:23.340> looks<00:01:23.490> rather<00:01:23.939> small

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
if you ask me and it looks rather small

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.499 
if you ask me and it looks rather small

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
but again it's cool that it's actually

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.300 
but again it's cool that it's actually
on<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.720> system<00:01:28.290> now<00:01:28.439> and<00:01:28.710> it's<00:01:28.860> supposed<00:01:29.159> to

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
on the system now and it's supposed to

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.210 
on the system now and it's supposed to
be<00:01:29.490> used<00:01:29.820> for<00:01:30.299> camera<00:01:31.290> control<00:01:31.650> so<00:01:31.829> that'll<00:01:32.130> be

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
be used for camera control so that'll be

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.520

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
and I can kind of understand why in a

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:51.800 
and I can kind of understand why in a
sense<00:03:50.250> that<00:03:50.370> does<00:03:50.730> split<00:03:51.090> the<00:03:51.209> market<00:03:51.660> all

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
sense that does split the market all

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.380 
sense that does split the market all
right<00:03:52.230> it<00:03:52.380> splits<00:03:52.709> the<00:03:52.890> market<00:03:53.220> between

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:53.390 
right it splits the market between

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:56.270 
right it splits the market between
people<00:03:54.390> that<00:03:54.420> currently<00:03:55.410> have<00:03:55.799> three<00:03:55.829> two

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
people that currently have three two

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.150 
people that currently have three two
guesses<00:03:56.459> and<00:03:56.970> then<00:03:57.780> this<00:03:58.230> new<00:03:58.500> market<00:03:58.769> over

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
guesses and then this new market over

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.289 
guesses and then this new market over
here<00:03:59.549> with<00:03:59.940> the<00:04:00.120> new<00:04:00.299> 3ds<00:04:00.630> all<00:04:01.230> right<00:04:02.180> but<00:04:03.180> I

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:03.299 
here with the new 3ds all right but I

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:04.819 
here with the new 3ds all right but I
gotta<00:04:03.480> be<00:04:03.660> honest<00:04:04.019> this<00:04:04.350> shouldn't<00:04:04.680> be<00:04:04.739> a
