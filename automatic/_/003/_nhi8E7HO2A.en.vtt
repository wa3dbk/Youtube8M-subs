00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.910 

so<00:00:00.659> at<00:00:00.780> this<00:00:00.810> point<00:00:01.020> I<00:00:01.170> would<00:00:01.230> be<00:00:01.410> fairly<00:00:01.650> well

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:01.920 
so at this point I would be fairly well

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.280 
so at this point I would be fairly well
done<00:00:02.100> with<00:00:02.280> things<00:00:02.750> the<00:00:03.750> only<00:00:03.929> other<00:00:04.049> thing<00:00:04.140> I

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:04.290 
done with things the only other thing I

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.240 
done with things the only other thing I
might<00:00:04.529> do<00:00:04.859> is<00:00:05.069> I<00:00:05.549> might<00:00:05.730> experiment<00:00:06.150> with

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:07.250 
might do is I might experiment with

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:09.259 
might do is I might experiment with
instead<00:00:08.250> of<00:00:08.340> trying<00:00:08.519> to<00:00:08.550> do<00:00:08.670> all<00:00:08.820> the<00:00:08.940> limiting

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
instead of trying to do all the limiting

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.060 
instead of trying to do all the limiting
with<00:00:09.420> one<00:00:09.630> limiting<00:00:10.019> plug-in<00:00:10.380> I<00:00:10.559> might

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
with one limiting plug-in I might

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.790 
with one limiting plug-in I might
actually<00:00:11.389> pop<00:00:12.389> all<00:00:12.630> these<00:00:12.840> up<00:00:15.619> take<00:00:16.619> this

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
actually pop all these up take this

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:27.140 
actually pop all these up take this
limiter<00:00:17.220> drop<00:00:17.880> it<00:00:18.060> back<00:00:18.240> to<00:00:18.510> say<00:00:18.690> 6<00:00:19.230> dB<00:00:26.150> there

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
limiter drop it back to say 6 dB there

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.120 
limiter drop it back to say 6 dB there
we<00:00:27.269> go<00:00:27.420> and<00:00:28.400> add<00:00:29.400> a<00:00:29.460> second<00:00:29.970> limiter<00:00:31.130> sometimes

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
we go and add a second limiter sometimes

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.819 
we go and add a second limiter sometimes
doing<00:00:32.340> things<00:00:32.520> in<00:00:32.640> stages<00:00:33.120> like<00:00:33.270> this<00:00:33.510> can<00:00:34.290> can

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
doing things in stages like this can can

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.500 
doing things in stages like this can can
be<00:00:34.950> more<00:00:35.100> effective<00:00:35.610> than<00:00:36.059> trying<00:00:36.300> to<00:00:36.360> do

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
be more effective than trying to do

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.020 
be more effective than trying to do
everything<00:00:36.630> with<00:00:36.960> one<00:00:37.170> plugin<00:00:37.640> so<00:00:38.640> if<00:00:38.730> we<00:00:38.790> pull

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
everything with one plugin so if we pull

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.150 
everything with one plugin so if we pull
this<00:00:39.059> down<00:00:39.390> to<00:00:39.600> 6<00:00:39.840> DB<00:00:40.200> and<00:00:40.379> I<00:00:40.500> might<00:00:40.680> just<00:00:40.829> a<00:00:40.950> be

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
this down to 6 DB and I might just a be

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.040 
this down to 6 DB and I might just a be
back<00:00:41.820> and<00:00:42.000> forth<00:00:42.210> and<00:00:42.390> hear<00:00:42.510> what<00:00:42.660> that<00:00:42.690> sounds

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
back and forth and hear what that sounds

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.930 
back and forth and hear what that sounds
like<00:00:43.530> we're<00:00:43.710> still<00:00:43.890> getting<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.250> same<00:00:44.280> 12<00:00:44.760> DB

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
like we're still getting the same 12 DB

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.940 
like we're still getting the same 12 DB
of<00:00:45.180> boost<00:00:45.390> but<00:00:46.140> neither<00:00:46.260> limiter<00:00:46.649> is<00:00:46.680> having

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
of boost but neither limiter is having

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.200 
of boost but neither limiter is having
to<00:00:47.039> work<00:00:47.190> quite<00:00:47.399> as<00:00:47.460> hard<00:00:47.700> and<00:00:47.820> neither<00:00:48.030> one<00:00:48.180> is

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
to work quite as hard and neither one is

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.240 
to work quite as hard and neither one is
catching<00:00:48.629> quite<00:00:48.809> as<00:00:48.899> much<00:00:49.050> and<00:00:49.320> so<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:50.100> sound

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
catching quite as much and so the sound

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.529 
catching quite as much and so the sound
can<00:00:50.430> sometimes<00:00:50.760> be<00:00:50.850> a<00:00:50.879> little<00:00:51.000> bit<00:00:51.180> smoother

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
can sometimes be a little bit smoother

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:52.970 
can sometimes be a little bit smoother
when<00:00:51.629> we<00:00:51.750> when<00:00:51.989> we<00:00:52.020> do<00:00:52.199> that<00:00:52.350> let's<00:00:52.680> listen<00:00:52.920> to

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
when we when we do that let's listen to

00:00:52.980 --> 00:01:05.780 
when we when we do that let's listen to
this<00:00:53.070> and<00:00:53.219> see<00:00:53.309> what<00:00:53.430> it<00:00:53.520> sounds<00:00:53.730> like

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.460 

it's<00:01:06.330> our<00:01:06.450> first<00:01:06.690> limiter<00:01:06.990> isn't<00:01:07.260> really

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
it's our first limiter isn't really

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.350 
it's our first limiter isn't really
reducing<00:01:07.860> level<00:01:08.130> at<00:01:08.250> all<00:01:08.370> it's<00:01:08.940> just<00:01:09.150> being

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
reducing level at all it's just being

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.820 
reducing level at all it's just being
used<00:01:09.600> to<00:01:09.720> crank<00:01:09.960> things<00:01:10.110> up<00:01:10.350> and<00:01:10.500> we<00:01:10.740> might

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
used to crank things up and we might

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.010 
used to crank things up and we might
push<00:01:11.070> that<00:01:11.190> a<00:01:11.250> little<00:01:11.280> bit<00:01:11.460> so<00:01:11.610> it's<00:01:11.730> just<00:01:12.020> you

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
push that a little bit so it's just you

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.310 
push that a little bit so it's just you
know<00:01:13.110> just<00:01:13.350> starting<00:01:13.800> to<00:01:14.930> catch<00:01:15.930> some<00:01:16.170> of<00:01:16.200> the

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
know just starting to catch some of the

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.310 
know just starting to catch some of the
peaks<00:01:17.420> and<00:01:18.420> we<00:01:18.570> will<00:01:18.810> I<00:01:18.960> think<00:01:19.140> we<00:01:19.230> were

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
peaks and we will I think we were

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.830 
peaks and we will I think we were
somewhere<00:01:19.680> in<00:01:19.800> that<00:01:19.830> range<00:01:19.950> there<00:01:20.460> and<00:01:20.670> we<00:01:21.630> pop

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
somewhere in that range there and we pop

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.930 
somewhere in that range there and we pop
over<00:01:21.990> to<00:01:22.110> this<00:01:22.290> one<00:01:22.530> and<00:01:22.830> we<00:01:23.370> could<00:01:23.520> maybe<00:01:23.670> drop

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:23.940 
over to this one and we could maybe drop

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:25.219 
over to this one and we could maybe drop
that<00:01:24.090> back<00:01:24.360> just<00:01:24.600> a<00:01:24.690> bit<00:01:24.720> so<00:01:24.990> it's<00:01:25.140> not

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
that back just a bit so it's not

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.410 
that back just a bit so it's not
catching<00:01:25.530> quite<00:01:25.860> as<00:01:25.979> much<00:01:26.130> and<00:01:26.460> again<00:01:27.270> we're

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
catching quite as much and again we're

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.090 
catching quite as much and again we're
getting<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.690> same<00:01:27.870> volume<00:01:28.080> level<00:01:28.560> but

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
getting the same volume level but

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.350 
getting the same volume level but
nothing's<00:01:29.400> having<00:01:29.640> to<00:01:29.700> work<00:01:29.850> quite<00:01:30.030> as<00:01:30.090> hard

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
nothing's having to work quite as hard

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.280 
nothing's having to work quite as hard
and<00:01:30.510> things<00:01:30.660> where<00:01:30.780> maybe<00:01:30.930> we<00:01:31.020> won't<00:01:31.080> sound

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
and things where maybe we won't sound

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.990 
and things where maybe we won't sound
quite<00:01:31.530> as<00:01:31.560> strained<00:01:32.010> as<00:01:32.010> they<00:01:32.370> can<00:01:32.580> sometimes

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
quite as strained as they can sometimes

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.550 
quite as strained as they can sometimes
when<00:01:33.479> you<00:01:33.540> try<00:01:33.660> to<00:01:33.690> do<00:01:33.870> too<00:01:33.900> much<00:01:34.050> with<00:01:34.350> one

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
when you try to do too much with one

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:44.020 
when you try to do too much with one
plug<00:01:34.770> in

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.760 

this<00:01:44.540> is<00:01:44.690> for<00:01:44.930> the<00:01:44.960> true

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.960 

you<00:02:27.770> can<00:02:27.890> experiment<00:02:28.160> with<00:02:28.370> that<00:02:28.550> with<00:02:28.670> using

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
you can experiment with that with using

you can experiment with that with using
you<00:02:29.300> can<00:02:29.420> do<00:02:29.510> the<00:02:29.600> same<00:02:29.750> thing<00:02:30.020> with

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
you can do the same thing with

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.530 
you can do the same thing with
compressors<00:02:30.680> to<00:02:31.310> try<00:02:31.550> to<00:02:31.610> smooth<00:02:32.240> things<00:02:32.360> out

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
compressors to try to smooth things out

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.930 
compressors to try to smooth things out
and<00:02:32.840> a<00:02:33.290> lot<00:02:34.040> of<00:02:34.070> mastering<00:02:34.370> engineers<00:02:34.730> will<00:02:34.850> do

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
and a lot of mastering engineers will do

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:35.980 
and a lot of mastering engineers will do
that<00:02:35.090> as<00:02:35.180> well<00:02:35.210> especially<00:02:35.570> when<00:02:35.870> you're

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:35.990 
that as well especially when you're

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:37.720 
that as well especially when you're
working<00:02:36.080> with<00:02:36.320> hardware<00:02:36.680> pieces<00:02:36.890> you<00:02:37.490> know<00:02:37.610> as

working with hardware pieces you know as
you<00:02:37.790> push<00:02:38.030> those<00:02:38.210> harder<00:02:38.510> the<00:02:38.630> sound<00:02:38.810> is<00:02:38.900> going

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.050 
you push those harder the sound is going

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:40.390 
you push those harder the sound is going
to<00:02:39.110> change<00:02:39.290> more<00:02:39.560> and<00:02:39.680> more<00:02:39.860> and<00:02:39.980> so<00:02:40.100> it<00:02:40.190> can<00:02:40.310> be

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
to change more and more and so it can be

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.670 
to change more and more and so it can be
useful<00:02:40.550> to<00:02:40.940> cascade<00:02:41.840> different<00:02:42.260> stages<00:02:42.500> of

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
useful to cascade different stages of

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.590 
useful to cascade different stages of
dynamic<00:02:43.130> control<00:02:43.430> so<00:02:43.970> that's<00:02:44.150> something<00:02:44.390> you

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
dynamic control so that's something you

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.350 
dynamic control so that's something you
can<00:02:44.840> you<00:02:45.200> can<00:02:45.350> experiment<00:02:45.680> with<00:02:45.890> as<00:02:46.070> well<00:02:46.360> but

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
can you can experiment with as well but

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:48.820 
can you can experiment with as well but
again<00:02:47.570> using<00:02:47.840> these<00:02:47.930> two<00:02:48.140> limiters<00:02:48.620> neither

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
again using these two limiters neither

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:50.650 
again using these two limiters neither
one's<00:02:48.980> had<00:02:49.130> to<00:02:49.220> work<00:02:49.340> very<00:02:49.370> hard<00:02:49.640> and<00:02:49.970> yet

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
one's had to work very hard and yet

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.930 
one's had to work very hard and yet
we've<00:02:50.840> still<00:02:51.050> got<00:02:51.200> our<00:02:51.350> level<00:02:51.620> up<00:02:51.770> to<00:02:52.040> you<00:02:52.850> know

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
we've still got our level up to you know

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.370 
we've still got our level up to you know
we're<00:02:53.090> certainly<00:02:53.420> we're<00:02:53.930> certainly<00:02:54.230> getting

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380 
we're certainly we're certainly getting

00:02:54.380 --> 00:03:00.510 
we're certainly we're certainly getting
the<00:02:54.530> zero<00:02:54.710> point

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:00.520 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:13.520 

you

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.630 

so<00:03:14.530> now<00:03:14.680> at<00:03:14.800> this<00:03:14.860> point<00:03:15.099> I've<00:03:15.310> kind<00:03:15.489> of<00:03:15.519> got

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
so now at this point I've kind of got

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:16.979 
so now at this point I've kind of got
things<00:03:15.819> that<00:03:16.090> like<00:03:16.239> I<00:03:16.330> said<00:03:16.510> where<00:03:16.660> I<00:03:16.690> where<00:03:16.930> I

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:16.989 
things that like I said where I where I

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:17.940 
things that like I said where I where I
want<00:03:17.170> them<00:03:17.260> at<00:03:17.379> I'd<00:03:17.500> have<00:03:17.590> listened<00:03:17.890> on

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
want them at I'd have listened on

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:19.290 
want them at I'd have listened on
headphones<00:03:18.400> I'd<00:03:18.670> have<00:03:18.760> tweaked<00:03:19.000> things<00:03:19.269> a

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:19.300 
headphones I'd have tweaked things a

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:20.520 
headphones I'd have tweaked things a
little<00:03:19.390> bit<00:03:19.510> more<00:03:19.690> maybe<00:03:19.870> I'd<00:03:20.050> have<00:03:20.080> gone<00:03:20.290> back

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
little bit more maybe I'd have gone back

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.890 
little bit more maybe I'd have gone back
and<00:03:20.739> work<00:03:20.890> with<00:03:20.920> the<00:03:21.130> EQ<00:03:21.459> after<00:03:22.420> listening<00:03:22.630> on

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
and work with the EQ after listening on

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.020 
and work with the EQ after listening on
some<00:03:23.080> different<00:03:23.310> some<00:03:24.310> different<00:03:24.640> systems

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
some different some different systems

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.509 
some different some different systems
then<00:03:25.750> I<00:03:25.810> would<00:03:25.959> do<00:03:26.319> my<00:03:26.349> final<00:03:26.680> save<00:03:27.010> maybe<00:03:27.340> I'd

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:27.519 
then I would do my final save maybe I'd

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:31.080 
then I would do my final save maybe I'd
call<00:03:27.730> this<00:03:27.940> because<00:03:28.239> I<00:03:28.360> pop
