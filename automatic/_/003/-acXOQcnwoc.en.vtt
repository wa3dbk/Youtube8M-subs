00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.970
 hello everyone today was going to teach how 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:08.189
 make croquettes of rings when you have 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.650
 the leftovers of rice and you do not know what to do 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.670
 with her I have a very good recipe 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:17.300
 to use it 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:21.260
 and these are the ingredients 2 cups of 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:24.369
 cooked rice half a cup of milk 1 egg 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:27.710
 half a cup of grated parmesan cheese 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:31.970

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:37.700
 necessary 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.700
 and sunflower oil 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:42.310
 the first thing to do is to heat the 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.980
 oil 

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:47.980
 and now let's prepare the dough here 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:50.400
 I have 2 cups of rice I'm going to put a 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.400
 egg 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.770
 half a cup of milk 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:02.130
 Parmesan cheese 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:05.810
 a spoonful of the yeast 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:05.810
 and now mix everything 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:13.570
 and I 'm going to put 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.570

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:22.659
 I'm going to put a little bit of the flour and 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.659
 Mix 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.390

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.200
 extra 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.460
 and now the rest of the flour 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:51.620
 I'm going to put half of the 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:55.900
 teaspoon of salt 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:55.900
 and a teaspoon of the parsley 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.890

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.590
 all right 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:07.040
 and the dough is already ready and now I'm going to 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:09.800
 fry the croquettes take a bit of the 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:15.130
 dough with a spoonful and with the help of 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:15.130
 another spoon put in the oil 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:30.560
 and now leave the croquettes to fry in 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:33.110
 not too hot oil that is for 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.990
 cooking good inside until they are 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:38.780
 a little golden and when they are ready 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:40.050
 put on paper to absorb the 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.450
 oil 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:46.320
 and micro that from rings are ready 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.850
