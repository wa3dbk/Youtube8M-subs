00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
and it took off and we watched it

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.270 
and it took off and we watched it
you<00:02:36.810> know<00:02:36.990> you<00:02:37.050> know<00:02:37.410> with<00:02:37.530> a<00:02:37.590> flare<00:02:37.890> how<00:02:38.130> it

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
you know you know with a flare how it

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.430 
you know you know with a flare how it
shoots<00:02:38.640> up<00:02:38.910> real<00:02:39.150> fast<00:02:39.390> and<00:02:39.840> then<00:02:39.900> just<00:02:40.170> like

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
shoots up real fast and then just like

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.540 
shoots up real fast and then just like
it<00:02:41.160> slows<00:02:41.700> and<00:02:42.150> fades<00:02:42.210> and<00:02:42.810> drops<00:02:43.220> this<00:02:44.220> thing

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
it slows and fades and drops this thing

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.990 
it slows and fades and drops this thing
maintained<00:02:45.390> a<00:02:45.540> constant<00:02:45.780> speed<00:02:46.820> the<00:02:47.820> whole

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
maintained a constant speed the whole

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.040 
maintained a constant speed the whole
time<00:02:48.350> it<00:02:49.350> didn't<00:02:49.680> accelerate<00:02:50.300> it<00:02:51.300> didn't<00:02:51.660> slow

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
time it didn't accelerate it didn't slow

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.470 
time it didn't accelerate it didn't slow
down<00:02:52.080> it<00:02:52.680> just<00:02:52.920> maintain<00:02:53.670> the<00:02:53.880> same<00:02:54.120> speed

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
down it just maintain the same speed

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.420 
down it just maintain the same speed
have<00:02:54.630> always<00:02:54.900> had<00:02:55.080> which<00:02:55.320> was<00:02:55.470> much<00:02:56.130> much

00:05:06.519 --> 00:05:06.529 
onyx flying

00:05:06.529 --> 00:05:08.619

00:05:08.619 --> 00:05:08.629 
it just it just it's beyond explanation

00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:12.159 
it just it just it's beyond explanation
at<00:05:09.319> that<00:05:09.529> point<00:05:09.799> they<00:05:10.189> just<00:05:10.369> go<00:05:10.459> oh<00:05:11.169> so--but

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:12.169 
at that point they just go oh so--but

at that point they just go oh so--but
can't<00:05:13.009> explain<00:05:13.369> it<00:05:13.989> move<00:05:14.989> on<00:05:15.489> and<00:05:16.489> that's

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:17.590
