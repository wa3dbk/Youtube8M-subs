diameter heavy aluminum fry pan with a
MOAB<00:00:16.020> and<00:00:16.560> I<00:00:17.390> left<00:00:18.390> us<00:00:18.630> preheat<00:00:19.410> about<00:00:19.710> three

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
MOAB and I left us preheat about three

MOAB and I left us preheat about three
maybe<00:00:20.730> four<00:00:21.180> minutes<00:00:21.660> before<00:00:22.080> i<00:00:22.109> put<00:00:22.410> my

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
maybe four minutes before i put my

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:29.990 
maybe four minutes before i put my
pancake<00:00:23.400> batter<00:00:23.609> in<00:00:25.250> and<00:00:28.070> the<00:00:29.070> test<00:00:29.369> is<00:00:29.609> to<00:00:29.970> see

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
pancake batter in and the test is to see

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.280 
pancake batter in and the test is to see
if<00:00:30.740> the<00:00:31.740> Moab<00:00:32.099> is<00:00:32.520> up<00:00:32.759> to<00:00:32.940> handling<00:00:33.420> an<00:00:33.690> 8<00:00:34.020> inch

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
if the Moab is up to handling an 8 inch

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:40.040 
if the Moab is up to handling an 8 inch
fry<00:00:34.350> pan<00:00:36.170> so<00:00:37.850> the<00:00:38.850> first<00:00:39.059> indication<00:00:39.420> that<00:00:39.899> it

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
fry pan so the first indication that it

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.459 
fry pan so the first indication that it
has<00:00:40.230> enough<00:00:40.620> heat<00:00:40.890> to<00:00:41.510> cook<00:00:42.510> pancakes<00:00:42.809> is<00:00:43.290> at

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
has enough heat to cook pancakes is at

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.279 
has enough heat to cook pancakes is at
that<00:00:43.980> side<00:00:44.250> to<00:00:44.489> bubble<00:00:44.789> up<00:00:44.910> yeah<00:00:45.660> and<00:00:45.930> they<00:00:46.110> are

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
that side to bubble up yeah and they are

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.229 
that side to bubble up yeah and they are
so<00:00:47.160> I<00:00:47.190> think<00:00:48.000> we'll<00:00:48.899> see<00:00:49.260> proof<00:00:49.710> is<00:00:49.890> in<00:00:49.920> the

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:50.239 
so I think we'll see proof is in the

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:53.750 
so I think we'll see proof is in the
pancakes<00:00:51.239> I<00:00:51.949> think<00:00:52.949> we've<00:00:53.160> got<00:00:53.309> enough<00:00:53.340> here

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
pancakes I think we've got enough here

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.900 
pancakes I think we've got enough here
to<00:00:53.969> fried<00:00:54.510> pancakes<00:00:55.070> with<00:00:56.070> an<00:00:56.190> 80-inch<00:00:56.520> heavy

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
fry pan in this thing weighs like a

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.310 
fry pan in this thing weighs like a
pound<00:00:59.609> a<00:00:59.789> half<00:00:59.940> two<00:01:00.239> pounds<00:01:00.660> it's<00:01:00.780> it's<00:01:01.109> a<00:01:01.170> good

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
pound a half two pounds it's it's a good

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.369 
pound a half two pounds it's it's a good
heavy<00:01:01.500> one<00:01:01.680> I<00:01:01.800> I<00:01:02.010> just<00:01:02.520> bought<00:01:02.730> it<00:01:02.760> at<00:01:02.969> walmart

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:03.379

heavy one I I just bought it at walmart
now<00:01:04.379> I<00:01:04.409> was<00:01:04.769> looking<00:01:05.479> for<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:07.080> next<00:01:07.290> big

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
now I was looking for the next big

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.800 
now I was looking for the next big
brother<00:01:08.610> of<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.570> 1812<00:01:10.170> mighty<00:01:10.470> fell<00:01:10.890> but<00:01:11.810> they

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
brother of the 1812 mighty fell but they

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.740 
brother of the 1812 mighty fell but they
didn't<00:01:13.110> have<00:01:13.260> it<00:01:13.290> so<00:01:13.680> this<00:01:13.830> is<00:01:13.890> me<00:01:14.280> by<00:01:14.549> I<00:01:14.850> don't

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
didn't have it so this is me by I don't

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.539 
didn't have it so this is me by I don't
know<00:01:15.810> somebody<00:01:16.259> else<00:01:16.320> but<00:01:17.100> it's<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.310> same

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
know somebody else but it's the same

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.780 
know somebody else but it's the same
basic<00:01:17.970> fry<00:01:18.180> pan<00:01:18.450> it's<00:01:18.600> about<00:01:18.930> 3<00:01:19.890> 16<00:01:20.369> minutes

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
basic fry pan it's about 3 16 minutes

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.940 
basic fry pan it's about 3 16 minutes
thick<00:01:21.060> and<00:01:21.240> it's<00:01:21.360> got<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.780> rings<00:01:22.590> on<00:01:22.830> the

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
thick and it's got the rings on the

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.399 
thick and it's got the rings on the
bottom<00:01:23.280> and<00:01:24.150> it<00:01:24.360> seems<00:01:24.630> to<00:01:24.689> distribute<00:01:25.200> heat

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
bottom and it seems to distribute heat

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.050 
bottom and it seems to distribute heat
pretty<00:01:26.009> evenly<00:01:26.570> so<00:01:27.570> I<00:01:27.869> think<00:01:28.290> this<00:01:28.439> is<00:01:28.500> a<00:01:28.650> good

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 
pretty evenly so I think this is a good

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.920 
pretty evenly so I think this is a good
substitute<00:01:30.060> for<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.720> teeth<00:01:30.930> out<00:01:31.170> pan<00:01:32.420> now<00:01:33.420> I

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
substitute for the teeth out pan now I

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.899 
substitute for the teeth out pan now I
think<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.950> biggest<00:01:35.100> problem<00:01:35.310> I'm<00:01:35.700> going<00:01:35.850> to

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
think the biggest problem I'm going to

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.719 
think the biggest problem I'm going to
have<00:01:36.060> you<00:01:36.090> here<00:01:36.570> is<00:01:36.720> number<00:01:37.710> one<00:01:37.950> I'll<00:01:38.460> have<00:01:38.700> a

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
have you here is number one I'll have a

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.260 
have you here is number one I'll have a
big<00:01:38.939> enough<00:01:39.150> spatula<00:01:39.810> so<00:01:40.880> I'm<00:01:41.880> going<00:01:42.090> to<00:01:42.119> let

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
big enough spatula so I'm going to let

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.469 
big enough spatula so I'm going to let
this<00:01:42.450> cook<00:01:42.780> a<00:01:42.990> little<00:01:43.350> bit<00:01:43.590> extra<00:01:44.009> to<00:01:44.700> make

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
this cook a little bit extra to make

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.120 
this cook a little bit extra to make
sure<00:01:45.630> it's<00:01:45.960> good<00:01:45.990> to<00:01:46.200> sit<00:01:46.439> and<00:01:46.590> I'm<00:01:46.680> still<00:01:46.979> not

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
sure it's good to sit and I'm still not

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.280 
sure it's good to sit and I'm still not
sure<00:01:47.189> I<00:01:47.430> can<00:01:47.670> flip<00:01:47.909> it<00:01:47.939> with<00:01:48.210> my<00:01:48.689> tiny<00:01:48.930> little

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
sure I can flip it with my tiny little

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.910 
sure I can flip it with my tiny little
spatula<00:01:49.619> may<00:01:50.070> not<00:01:50.250> be<00:01:50.430> real<00:01:50.670> pretty<00:01:50.909> but<00:01:51.000> I

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
spatula may not be real pretty but I

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.469 
spatula may not be real pretty but I
think<00:01:52.920> we'll<00:01:53.070> get<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.579> job<00:01:53.790> done<00:01:53.820> one<00:01:54.270> way<00:01:54.450> or

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
think we'll get the job done one way or

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:00.830 
think we'll get the job done one way or
another<00:01:56.659> ok<00:01:57.659> as<00:01:57.719> you<00:01:57.810> can<00:01:57.899> see<00:01:58.820> that's<00:01:59.840> pretty

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
another ok as you can see that's pretty

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.679 
another ok as you can see that's pretty
much<00:02:00.990> done<00:02:01.259> bubbling<00:02:02.149> it's<00:02:03.149> starting<00:02:03.570> to<00:02:03.659> look

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
much done bubbling it's starting to look

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:11.310 
much done bubbling it's starting to look
a<00:02:03.840> little<00:02:03.960> dry<00:02:04.380> on<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:04.770> edges<00:02:07.520> as<00:02:08.520> spacers

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:11.320 
a little dry on the edges as spacers

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:16.080 
a little dry on the edges as spacers
there<00:02:12.320> we<00:02:12.500> go<00:02:12.850> kinney<00:02:13.930> how<00:02:14.930> about<00:02:15.110> that<00:02:15.320> huh

I've<00:02:23.330> been<00:02:23.420> cooking<00:02:23.690> these<00:02:23.900> about<00:02:24.290> a<00:02:26.020> minute

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.020 
I've been cooking these about a minute

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.440 
I've been cooking these about a minute
and<00:02:27.080> a<00:02:27.140> half<00:02:27.170> on<00:02:27.590> the<00:02:27.740> side<00:02:28.010> on<00:02:28.220> each<00:02:28.400> side<00:02:28.730> that

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
and a half on the side on each side that

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.420 
and a half on the side on each side that
seems<00:02:29.780> to<00:02:29.960> work<00:02:30.140> quite<00:02:30.170> well<00:02:30.470> you<00:02:31.010> get<00:02:31.190> a<00:02:31.220> paper

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
seems to work quite well you get a paper

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:38.680 
seems to work quite well you get a paper
plate<00:02:36.460> ironically<00:02:37.460> that's<00:02:37.730> basically<00:02:38.330> I

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
plate ironically that's basically I

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.780 
plate ironically that's basically I
think<00:02:39.470> exactly<00:02:39.830> the<00:02:40.130> same<00:02:40.340> amount<00:02:40.490> of<00:02:40.730> time

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
think exactly the same amount of time

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.380 
think exactly the same amount of time
but<00:02:41.180> I<00:02:41.360> was<00:02:41.600> cooking<00:02:42.050> the<00:02:43.210> little<00:02:44.210> tiny

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
but I was cooking the little tiny

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.020 
but I was cooking the little tiny
pancakes<00:02:44.960> in<00:02:45.080> the<00:02:45.110> 1812<00:02:45.680> weather<00:02:46.370> turbo<00:02:46.760> top

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
pancakes in the 1812 weather turbo top

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.820 
pancakes in the 1812 weather turbo top
was<00:02:47.270> a<00:02:47.300> minute<00:02:47.630> and<00:02:47.690> a<00:02:47.750> half<00:02:47.780> per<00:02:48.200> aside<00:02:48.560> so

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
was a minute and a half per aside so

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.440 
was a minute and a half per aside so
proportionately<00:02:51.830> I<00:02:51.980> think<00:02:52.370> the<00:02:52.580> the<00:02:53.060> heat<00:02:53.270> is

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
proportionately I think the the heat is

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.800 
proportionately I think the the heat is
the<00:02:53.480> same<00:02:53.840> with<00:02:54.020> this<00:02:54.200> Moab<00:02:54.650> top<00:02:55.480> and<00:02:56.480> about

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
the same with this Moab top and about

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.370 
the same with this Moab top and about
every<00:02:57.110> two<00:02:57.350> pancakes<00:02:57.650> I'm<00:02:58.220> refuel<00:02:59.170> so<00:03:00.170> that's

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380 
every two pancakes I'm refuel so that's

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.610 
every two pancakes I'm refuel so that's
about<00:03:00.530> every<00:03:01.209> five<00:03:02.209> minutes<00:03:02.510> or<00:03:02.780> so<00:03:02.959> and<00:03:03.140> it's

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
about every five minutes or so and it's

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.380 
about every five minutes or so and it's
not<00:03:03.830> really<00:03:04.340> low<00:03:04.490> then<00:03:04.730> it's<00:03:04.940> just<00:03:05.090> time<00:03:05.360> to

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
not really low then it's just time to

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:07.570 
not really low then it's just time to
look<00:03:05.690> a<00:03:05.840> little<00:03:05.959> bit<00:03:06.200> red<00:03:06.440> on<00:03:06.620> the<00:03:06.770> edges<00:03:07.070> so<00:03:07.550> I

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:07.580 
look a little bit red on the edges so I

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.920 
look a little bit red on the edges so I
refuel<00:03:08.300> about<00:03:08.510> every<00:03:08.720> five<00:03:08.930> minutes<00:03:09.970> so<00:03:10.970> how

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
refuel about every five minutes so how

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:13.690 
refuel about every five minutes so how
about<00:03:11.990> another<00:03:12.320> 30<00:03:12.650> seconds<00:03:13.190> this<00:03:13.310> should<00:03:13.550> be

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
about another 30 seconds this should be

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.300 
about another 30 seconds this should be
ready<00:03:13.850> to<00:03:13.880> come<00:03:14.060> out<00:03:14.290> now<00:03:15.290> some<00:03:15.980> of<00:03:16.040> the<00:03:16.130> other

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
ready to come out now some of the other

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:17.710 
ready to come out now some of the other
things<00:03:16.610> that<00:03:16.670> I'm<00:03:16.850> going<00:03:17.120> to<00:03:17.209> try<00:03:17.420> to<00:03:17.450> cook

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
things that I'm going to try to cook

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.710 
things that I'm going to try to cook
with<00:03:17.930> us<00:03:18.110> with<00:03:18.470> this<00:03:18.709> huge<00:03:19.160> Moab<00:03:19.700> top<00:03:20.060> which

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
with us with this huge Moab top which

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.920 
with us with this huge Moab top which
for<00:03:20.959> an<00:03:21.019> alcohol<00:03:21.500> soaked<00:03:21.890> is<00:03:22.780> getting<00:03:23.780> up

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
for an alcohol soaked is getting up

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:25.600 
for an alcohol soaked is getting up
about<00:03:24.320> as<00:03:24.470> high<00:03:24.620> as<00:03:24.680> you<00:03:24.890> know<00:03:25.040> I<00:03:25.070> don't<00:03:25.430> think

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.610 
about as high as you know I don't think

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:28.630 
about as high as you know I don't think
you<00:03:25.700> wanna<00:03:25.910> a<00:03:26.690> wick<00:03:27.440> alcohol<00:03:27.890> so<00:03:28.190> any<00:03:28.370> bigger

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640 
you wanna a wick alcohol so any bigger

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.430 
you wanna a wick alcohol so any bigger
than<00:03:28.730> this<00:03:28.820> this<00:03:29.090> is<00:03:29.300> it<00:03:29.480> a<00:03:29.630> bit<00:03:29.989> of<00:03:30.080> insanity

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
than this this is it a bit of insanity

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.979 
than this this is it a bit of insanity
in<00:03:30.800> itself<00:03:31.190> and<00:03:31.519> it<00:03:32.209> really<00:03:32.480> heats<00:03:32.750> up<00:03:32.959> the

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:32.989 
in itself and it really heats up the

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:36.970 
in itself and it really heats up the
scroll<00:03:33.350> cage<00:03:33.590> but<00:03:33.860> I<00:03:35.350> think<00:03:36.350> it's<00:03:36.470> feasible<00:03:36.650> to

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
scroll cage but I think it's feasible to

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:40.420 
scroll cage but I think it's feasible to
use<00:03:38.590> another<00:03:39.590> thing<00:03:39.769> I<00:03:39.860> want<00:03:40.010> to<00:03:40.100> try<00:03:40.220> cooking

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
use another thing I want to try cooking

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:44.380 
use another thing I want to try cooking
is<00:03:40.730> bacon<00:03:41.480> and<00:03:42.250> maybe<00:03:43.250> price<00:03:43.580> of<00:03:43.790> eggs<00:03:43.970> so

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:44.390 
is bacon and maybe price of eggs so

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:46.600 
is bacon and maybe price of eggs so
we'll<00:03:45.080> try<00:03:45.320> that<00:03:45.350> after<00:03:45.890> we<00:03:45.980> get<00:03:46.100> this<00:03:46.280> pancake

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:46.610 
we'll try that after we get this pancake

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:48.420 
we'll try that after we get this pancake
out<00:03:47.030> of<00:03:47.120> here<00:03:47.239> which<00:03:47.420> should<00:03:47.690> be<00:03:47.840> coming<00:03:48.170> out

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
out of here which should be coming out

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.890 
out of here which should be coming out
you<00:03:49.430> know<00:03:49.580> I'm<00:03:49.880> hurrying<00:03:50.390> it<00:03:50.510> a<00:03:50.540> little<00:03:50.690> bit

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
you know I'm hurrying it a little bit

00:03:50.900 --> 00:04:00.370 
you know I'm hurrying it a little bit

what I got ok there's the first side and

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:07.270 
what I got ok there's the first side and
there's<00:04:05.180> the<00:04:05.300> second<00:04:05.720> side<00:04:05.930> so<00:04:06.799> I<00:04:06.830> think<00:04:06.980> we'll

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.150 
there's the second side so I think we'll
all<00:04:07.430> agree<00:04:07.489> that<00:04:08.230> cooking<00:04:09.230> pancakes<00:04:09.500> and<00:04:10.010> this

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:24.610 
it's cooking nicely so I'll let that

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:26.460

cook<00:05:24.849> for<00:05:24.909> a<00:05:25.120> little<00:05:25.270> while<00:05:25.510> then<00:05:25.840> I'll<00:05:26.020> give

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:26.470 
cook for a little while then I'll give

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:28.620 
cook for a little while then I'll give
it<00:05:26.500> a<00:05:26.650> flip<00:05:26.889> well<00:05:27.729> it<00:05:27.880> turns<00:05:27.909> out<00:05:28.270> that<00:05:28.330> the

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:28.630 
it a flip well it turns out that the

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:30.300 
it a flip well it turns out that the
heat<00:05:28.810> on<00:05:28.990> this<00:05:29.139> is<00:05:29.320> almost<00:05:29.590> perfect<00:05:29.919> for

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:30.310 
heat on this is almost perfect for

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:35.210 
heat on this is almost perfect for
cooking<00:05:30.490> bacon<00:05:31.030> not<00:05:31.180> too<00:05:31.210> hot<00:05:31.570> not<00:05:31.810> too<00:05:32.139> cool

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:35.220 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:37.950 

cooking<00:05:36.220> up<00:05:36.370> fine<00:05:36.789> I'll<00:05:37.090> ground<00:05:37.360> up<00:05:37.539> on<00:05:37.690> mobile

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:22.250

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:26.620 
oh I think it's fair to say that we have
enough<00:06:22.460> heat<00:06:22.700> here<00:06:22.970> for<00:06:24.310> bacon<00:06:25.310> and<00:06:25.460> eggs<00:06:25.640> and
