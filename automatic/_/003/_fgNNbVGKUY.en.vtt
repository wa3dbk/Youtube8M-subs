00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:18.330
 you are used to playing online and you want to 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.369
 adapt to the game of hiv 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:29.550
 listen to these three tips he has from 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:31.050
 give you max fishers between tips though 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.420
 you want to play live tournaments 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.030
 the first was played in a non-casino 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.670
 bring too much money because classic 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.710
 what one does when he goes to play a 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.500
 tournament and ski and then want to go to 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.230
 roulette to do the same thing that you should not 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.399
 that is, to play at the casino 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.620
 absolutely a beautiful thing 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.960
 I do, however, speak with words 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.920
 so play to have fun not for 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.920
 go hand in hand with the tournament 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:02.960
 when you play live the second advantage 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:05.000
 is the fact that since you are there 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.040
 in front of players you can watch it 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.350
 so you can see how they handle 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:12.410
 chips cards and accordingly 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:14.900
 you will benefit from how to play 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:17.780
 a hand against them that is obvious that 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:20.090
 if one arrives, one begins to do the 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.160
 chips shuffle probably a 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.990
 quite an expert player at least 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.310
 that plays so live so stay a while 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:31.790
 more careful than one who fails to 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:33.229
 handle it and chips the third board 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:35.090
 which I give myself is to see a little in the 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:37.220
 our game what can favor b 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.750
 that is, for example, I am a player 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.960
 that having played so much I do 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:44.479
 professional for over 15 years 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.070
 something that bothers me a little 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:50.210
 to play at the beginning of the tournaments therefore me 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:52.040
 I bring my ipad or my music 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.380
 therefore in moments it is difficult 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.180
 tournament that especially at the beginning that me 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.550
 I listen to some music and I can 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:00.920
 remain focused however not 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:03.140
 get bored then that you allow yourself octs 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:06.160
 made from the problem of playing too many 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.160
 hello hands
