00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
obviously a few more CCS

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.390 
obviously a few more CCS
but<00:03:11.090> the<00:03:11.209> 800<00:03:11.629> is<00:03:11.810> fuel<00:03:12.200> injected<00:03:12.290> so<00:03:12.920> throttle

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
but the 800 is fuel injected so throttle

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.610 
but the 800 is fuel injected so throttle
response<00:03:13.519> is<00:03:13.879> a<00:03:13.940> little<00:03:14.239> bit<00:03:14.390> better<00:03:14.629> although

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
response is a little bit better although

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:16.750 
response is a little bit better although
I<00:03:15.650> have<00:03:15.799> to<00:03:15.829> say<00:03:15.980> on<00:03:16.220> this<00:03:16.370> one<00:03:16.430> there's

really I think it's fear of the unknown
all<00:03:28.430> it<00:03:28.640> means<00:03:28.760> is<00:03:28.970> that<00:03:29.030> when<00:03:29.239> you<00:03:29.269> press<00:03:29.540> the

all it means is that when you press the

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:31.960 
all it means is that when you press the
front<00:03:29.870> brake<00:03:30.049> it<00:03:31.010> breaks<00:03:31.280> the<00:03:31.459> back<00:03:31.609> as<00:03:31.790> well

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
front brake it breaks the back as well

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:33.970

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.650 
and when you press the rear brake lever
it<00:03:34.250> breaks<00:03:34.579> the<00:03:34.730> front<00:03:34.940> as<00:03:35.060> well<00:03:35.209> it<00:03:35.359> means<00:03:35.480> the

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
it breaks the front as well it means the

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:37.390 
it breaks the front as well it means the
