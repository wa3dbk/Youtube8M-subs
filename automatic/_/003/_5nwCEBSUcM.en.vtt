Mikasa

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.359 

I<00:01:19.880> think<00:01:20.869> that<00:01:21.110> stands<00:01:21.469> for<00:01:21.619> National

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:22.369 
I think that stands for National

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:26.889 
I think that stands for National
Federation<00:01:24.880> high<00:01:25.880> school<00:01:26.360> or<00:01:26.570> something<00:01:26.600> like

00:01:26.889 --> 00:01:26.899 
Federation high school or something like

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:28.779 
Federation high school or something like
that<00:01:26.960> but<00:01:27.350> either<00:01:28.100> way<00:01:28.310> it's<00:01:28.460> the<00:01:28.579> official

00:01:28.779 --> 00:01:28.789 
that but either way it's the official

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:31.510 
that but either way it's the official
ball<00:01:29.380> and<00:01:30.380> I've<00:01:30.740> never<00:01:30.890> played<00:01:31.159> water<00:01:31.399> polo

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520

before<00:01:32.119> but<00:01:32.649> it's<00:01:33.649> definitely<00:01:33.829> something<00:01:34.219> I

00:01:34.419 --> 00:01:34.429 
before but it's definitely something I

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:35.350 
before but it's definitely something I
want<00:01:34.610> to<00:01:34.670> try<00:01:34.909> out
