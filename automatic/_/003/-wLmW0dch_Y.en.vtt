paid 161 k for this card which was a
little<00:02:38.790> too<00:02:39.060> much<00:02:39.330> after<00:02:40.320> looking<00:02:40.590> at<00:02:40.860> those

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
little too much after looking at those

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.430 
little too much after looking at those
averages<00:02:41.670> i<00:02:41.820> definitely<00:02:42.300> overpaid<00:02:42.810> on<00:02:43.020> it<00:02:43.200> so

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
averages i definitely overpaid on it so

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.500 
averages i definitely overpaid on it so
i'm<00:02:43.950> going<00:02:44.160> to<00:02:44.250> stay<00:02:44.520> it<00:02:44.670> right<00:02:44.910> off<00:02:45.090> the<00:02:45.270> bat

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
i'm going to stay it right off the bat

if<00:02:45.780> you're<00:02:46.230> able<00:02:46.380> to<00:02:46.650> get<00:02:46.830> this<00:02:47.010> card<00:02:47.310> you<00:02:48.120> know

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 
if you're able to get this card you know

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.780 
if you're able to get this card you know
for<00:02:48.450> a<00:02:48.480> hundred<00:02:48.870> to<00:02:49.020> 115<00:02:49.830> k<00:02:50.040> it<00:02:50.280> may<00:02:50.460> be<00:02:50.520> worth

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
for a hundred to 115 k it may be worth

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.090 
for a hundred to 115 k it may be worth
it<00:02:51.030> with<00:02:51.720> the<00:02:51.840> current<00:02:52.080> auction<00:02:52.590> house<00:02:52.710> prices

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
it with the current auction house prices

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.730 
it with the current auction house prices
so<00:02:53.340> it's<00:02:53.520> definitely<00:02:54.030> not<00:02:54.390> worth<00:02:54.750> that<00:02:55.500> much

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:55.740 
so it's definitely not worth that much

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:57.200 
so it's definitely not worth that much
coin<00:02:55.980> i<00:02:56.040> think<00:02:56.370> there's<00:02:56.520> a<00:02:56.610> lot<00:02:56.820> of<00:02:56.880> other

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:57.210 
coin i think there's a lot of other

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:59.300 
coin i think there's a lot of other

throwing<00:03:08.670> type<00:03:09.090> guy<00:03:09.360> that's<00:03:09.630> just<00:03:09.840> not<00:03:10.020> how<00:03:10.170> my

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
throwing type guy that's just not how my

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.530 
throwing type guy that's just not how my
offense<00:03:10.800> is<00:03:11.040> I<00:03:11.250> don't<00:03:11.640> run<00:03:11.850> a<00:03:11.910> lot<00:03:11.970> of<00:03:12.240> streaks

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
and things like that so I don't think I

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.900 
and things like that so I don't think I
was<00:03:14.820> fully<00:03:15.120> able<00:03:15.420> to<00:03:15.810> utilize<00:03:16.350> the<00:03:16.980> 97<00:03:17.610> speed

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
was fully able to utilize the 97 speed

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.150 
was fully able to utilize the 97 speed
but<00:03:18.210> I<00:03:18.240> was<00:03:18.540> able<00:03:18.780> to<00:03:19.020> get<00:03:19.140> him<00:03:19.350> open<00:03:19.590> and<00:03:19.860> once

the catch as well but I was mostly
impressed<00:03:50.730> with<00:03:50.970> him<00:03:51.120> hanging<00:03:51.360> onto<00:03:51.690> the<00:03:51.840> ball

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:51.960 
impressed with him hanging onto the ball

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:54.770 
impressed with him hanging onto the ball
in<00:03:52.320> traffic<00:03:52.830> several<00:03:53.340> examples<00:03:54.210> you've<00:03:54.570> seen

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
in traffic several examples you've seen

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.720 
in traffic several examples you've seen
on<00:03:54.990> your<00:03:55.110> screen<00:03:55.320> so<00:03:55.590> far<00:03:55.830> so<00:03:56.070> again<00:03:56.310> all<00:03:56.550> in

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730

on your screen so far so again all in
all<00:03:56.910> I<00:03:57.180> think<00:03:57.540> there's<00:03:57.900> a<00:03:57.960> lot<00:03:58.140> of<00:03:58.200> other

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
all I think there's a lot of other

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.560 
all I think there's a lot of other
receivers<00:03:59.100> out<00:03:59.250> there<00:03:59.490> that<00:03:59.670> does<00:04:00.090> what<00:04:00.420> he

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:00.570 
receivers out there that does what he

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:02.780 
receivers out there that does what he
can<00:04:00.600> do<00:04:00.960> as<00:04:01.140> well<00:04:01.380> and<00:04:01.710> I<00:04:02.100> wouldn't<00:04:02.460> recommend

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
can do as well and I wouldn't recommend

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.520 
can do as well and I wouldn't recommend
spending<00:04:03.210> this<00:04:03.510> much<00:04:03.750> coin<00:04:03.960> but<00:04:04.200> if<00:04:04.290> you're<00:04:04.470> a
