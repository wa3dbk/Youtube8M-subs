and now we've done that two years in a
row<00:01:14.220> now<00:01:14.369> and<00:01:15.920> certainly<00:01:16.920> we'd<00:01:17.250> like<00:01:17.369> to<00:01:17.460> be

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
and moving on didn't happen but you know

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.060 
and moving on didn't happen but you know
if<00:01:24.270> you<00:01:24.299> talk<00:01:24.780> by<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:24.960> season<00:01:25.350> overall<00:01:25.619> one<00:01:25.950> in

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
if you talk by the season overall one in

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.780 
if you talk by the season overall one in
51<00:01:26.520> games<00:01:27.229> with<00:01:28.229> with<00:01:28.680> you<00:01:29.340> know<00:01:29.460> being

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
51 games with with you know being

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.390 
51 games with with you know being
short-handed<00:01:30.150> a<00:01:30.450> lot<00:01:30.600> of<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:30.750> time<00:01:31.369> overall<00:01:32.369> I

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
short-handed a lot of the time overall I

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.069 
short-handed a lot of the time overall I
think<00:01:32.579> it<00:01:32.850> was<00:01:33.000> it<00:01:33.329> was<00:01:33.479> under<00:01:33.689> step<00:01:33.900> in<00:01:34.020> the

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
think it was it was under step in the

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.679 
think it was it was under step in the
right<00:01:34.200> direction<00:01:34.229> I<00:01:34.710> think<00:01:34.950> we<00:01:35.040> have<00:01:35.070> a<00:01:35.189> very

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:35.689 
right direction I think we have a very

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:38.649 
right direction I think we have a very
very<00:01:36.689> good<00:01:36.900> core<00:01:37.170> and<00:01:37.380> a<00:01:37.680> very<00:01:37.890> bright<00:01:38.280> future

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:38.659 
very good core and a very bright future

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:42.740 
very good core and a very bright future
you<00:01:39.659> know<00:01:39.780> we'll<00:01:40.110> see<00:01:40.140> what<00:01:41.270> role<00:01:42.270> players<00:01:42.540> and

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
you know we'll see what role players and

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:43.880 
you know we'll see what role players and
what<00:01:42.840> decisions<00:01:43.320> are<00:01:43.409> made<00:01:43.560> in<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:43.740> offseason

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890
