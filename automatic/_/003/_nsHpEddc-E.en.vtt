 Barack Obama clear on Friday 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.670
 smallest I'm not cut off that 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.030
 No money needed Kleinfelds successor Peter Frey Frey 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.030
 Municipal team man exceeded expectations 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.190
 make here 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:58.689
 he read the writing is that's good for the little ones 

00:01:58.689 --> 00:01:59.770
 recognize very badly 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.770
 at what age market is Switzerland had come 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.720
 how do you see that we have 

00:02:08.339 --> 00:02:13.509
 Yartey 82 as the second leading role for this film his own offspring 

00:02:13.509 --> 00:02:15.420
 just like his daughter Emma 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.340
 that is also in the movie his 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.209
 her daughter Magdalena 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:21.479
 from the first time knows nothing 

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:23.429
 he plays 

00:02:23.429 --> 00:02:28.299
 Scriptwriter named Henry who does not really succeed 

00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:32.369
 the sales would be the third-rate television series then too 

00:02:32.369 --> 00:02:34.869
 sometimes it is sold because of bad odds 

00:02:34.869 --> 00:02:38.109
 and that is pretty frustrated and without prospects 

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:41.840
 and then his ex-girlfriend comes to him played by Jasmin Gerat 

00:02:42.469 --> 00:02:47.409
 So who is a successful author and who can offer him that 

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:51.529
 Screenplay for the filming percent of their last Western Australia should be for him 

00:02:51.529 --> 00:02:56.789
 The crisis is a great opportunity and Dr, as with a lot of fuss in this creative work 

00:02:56.789 --> 00:02:57.739
 support 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:02:59.289
 yes and then suddenly 

00:02:59.289 --> 00:03:01.569
 a little girl with him at the door 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:04.690
 and that's a physical daughter and I have a letter with me 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.679
 and there is in there percent 

00:03:06.679 --> 00:03:10.689
 a year here and I have to go to America so that is the mother of the child 

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:14.019
 and I do not know where to go with the kid that's a kid by the way bus 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:16.599
 sired at that time must now take care of it but I can not 

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:17.549
 I have to say 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:19.199
 Percent to America 

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:21.589
 yes and then he stands there 

00:03:21.589 --> 00:03:25.709
 From a distance saw with the child should start percent then comes to that 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:29.790
 even the one who believes that he is the father of his body, that is, the one who 

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:33.659
 the partner of this 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:37.639
 BMW must know that he is not just the biological father and there too 

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:39.039
 Percent and love 

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:41.689
 in a deep 

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:43.859
 Yes and then 

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:48.260
 we are essentially making it somehow very much between the game 

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:51.259
 So father and daughter goes so she lives with him in the apartment 

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:57.479
 and percent lay there an unholy and rising after the enduring 

00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:59.929
 wants to work in this script 

00:03:59.929 --> 00:04:01.429
 and percent 

00:04:01.429 --> 00:04:04.659
 yes, he's keeping his scriptwriter away from us 

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:07.659
 Ex-girlfriend is also that he is the biological daughter 

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:12.889
 then there is sometime impact duration and percent and percent 

00:04:12.889 --> 00:04:16.090
 so ver di do not continue to work on this script so the opportunity 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:18.309
 are taken, so to speak first 

00:04:18.309 --> 00:04:21.669
 even then this child 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:25.590
 under the salvina 10s where the child is alone in the apartment until the game 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:29.710
 wave delivered and flatten half the apartment the fire department must come 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:33.509
 yes and these are moments 

00:04:33.509 --> 00:04:38.050
 I somehow unrealistic found Til Schweiger always very calm 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:39.009
 and and 

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:43.439
 and how much the apathetic often everything reacts I tell the child betrays 

00:04:43.439 --> 00:04:44.919
 his half points off 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:49.330
 and he even sort of order is now happening nervous 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:50.900
 keep kids like that 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:53.090
 that's not unrealistic 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:55.719
 I do not know how this kid 

00:04:55.719 --> 00:04:56.810
 now actually 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:01.370
 and there come spectators so the kid is supposed to be nice and different 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:02.409
 be sympathetic 

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:05.080
 So it is rather unpleasant for me, I say 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:06.309
 I find this 

00:05:06.309 --> 00:05:09.699
 will they be this child a child is somehow 

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:11.949
 Sinsheim will stand in the future and 

00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:14.050
 RH so I know that 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:17.370
 you do not have to think about this kid from advertising in it 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:19.089
 Membership is 

00:05:19.089 --> 00:05:23.669
 11 Fukuda pointed out that this with vinegar and advertising Knapps that was also one 

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:26.959
 terrible child so in the direction of the team is Werner Schweiger too 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.069
 around 

00:05:29.069 --> 00:05:33.419
 I think the movie is for a credit round 21 minutes so two hours I 

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:35.229
 I'm one of those 

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:36.819
 be quiet 

00:05:36.819 --> 00:05:40.939
 Community can not go longer than 90 minutes it's just too sprawling 

00:05:41.599 --> 00:05:44.599
 and around 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:48.919
 I'm in that I'm too bad I generally have a problem with this 

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:53.690
 Table because he has for me I could also with the sea of ​​1 no goal Köppen 

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:54.770
 and 2 o'clock 

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:57.199
 the rabbit 9 3 percent 

00:05:57.199 --> 00:06:00.439
 for displeasure the loser list at the beginning does not care for any films either 

00:06:00.439 --> 00:06:03.300
 started to be particularly enthusiastic 

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:06.300
 so far this movie is not necessarily my thing 

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:11.349
 but I recognize the movies we had great success in the cinemas many 

00:06:11.349 --> 00:06:13.050
 People could fire and 

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:16.190
 yes, there is nothing that can hurt anyone either so far as well as nothing 

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:17.680
 bad about it except 

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:20.770
 that you are interested in such type of film "fly" proportionally as it is 

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:22.990
 waving to them is the case with me 

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:27.860
 inasmuch as they like Tel Til Schweiger relationship comedies when they go to 

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:28.689
 example 

00:06:28.689 --> 00:06:31.139
 No-ear bunnies and two-eared chicks liked it 

00:06:31.139 --> 00:06:34.029
 then you will surely like this movie too soon 

00:06:34.029 --> 00:06:36.759
 my case was said as that 

00:06:36.759 --> 00:06:39.789
 the film therefore defame five points 

00:06:39.789 --> 00:06:43.349
 the extras is a very nice type Nautile commentary by Til Schweiger 

00:06:43.349 --> 00:06:46.400
 together with daughter Emma 

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:49.509
 there's a look behind the scenes there's a partial confession see 

00:06:50.099 --> 00:06:52.880
 and there is music video and dumb 

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:54.910
 we have a few things left 

00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:58.040
 that's a whole lot i give it 7
