00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:19.890

 a certain liter to tell about the whole 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.990

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:29.490
 so 65 plus here is this line 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:34.950
 issued in the following stained glass 40 45 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:36.770
 50 55 60 65 75 liters + 10 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:41.640

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:45.539
 4010 50 60 plus 10 is marked and sat 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:47.489
 it means that this is a female backpack also 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.969
 This backpack may be suitable for a person with 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.559
 fragile physique still note that 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.070

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:18.380
 tezhu and medium and heavy load and 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:22.580
 therefore, in this model, the maximum 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:26.390
 attention is paid to the suspension 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:30.020
 deuter aircontact suspension it allows 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:32.660
 adjust back for any height 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:37.369
 human by what you poke out 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:39.410
 these straps and rearrange them below also 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:41.690
 in this one in this backpack 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:44.960
 development is used aunt ir and in 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:45.500
 lap belt area this system is vari 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.910
 flex 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:52.340
 which tightly wraps around in the belt and in 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:54.759
 while hiking she moves a little and 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:57.440
 therefore, such a system allows 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:02:02.270
 Well, you less tired during 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:05.450
 carrying a heavy backpack is also very 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:09.709
 children pay much attention as always 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:13.070
 back ventilation here this one can 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:16.489
 see the mesh material under it 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:19.010
 here is a sponge hidden here 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:21.590
 here right on or onion there is a small 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:24.230
 fragment strap and you can see that here 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:27.430
 are under the grid very porous 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:30.260
 sponge and so when a person 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:33.019
 he is in motion with his body 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:35.209
 pushes on the sponge and thus inside 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:39.409
 air circulates and thereby allows 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:41.580
 you don't breathe besides 

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:44.580
 ventilation is carried out by 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:47.970
 special special channels which 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:51.269
 you can see here Well 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:53.720
 back to the pockets there are pockets already 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:56.819
 classic as as many say under 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:03:00.409
 a bottle of water but it is also convenient 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:04.049
 let's say if you fix it here again 

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:07.340
 racks from the tent it is convenient that they are not 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:09.450
 fell out of here very well what 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.910
 the producers namely aunt started 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:15.000
 move away from the classic mesh 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:19.129
 pockets which is well at the expense of his 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:22.049
 locations with a bottom edge they are constant 

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:24.870
 rubbed during a hike and in this way 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:27.569
 rushed now it changed put 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:31.489
 the same durable material as on all 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:33.780
 the rest of the backpack food pockets 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:38.519
 pocket is very convenient for small things 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:41.540
 there is directly on the belt here in 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:47.880
 principle pocket secret which is available 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:50.569
 inside the flap and pocket on top 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.569
 valve 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:04:00.780
 Of course there is still a mount for 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:05.020
 trekking poles nonsense located 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:09.220
 raincoat wind is famous for its 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:11.530
 raincoats then there are many people buying in 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:14.019
 backpacks of other companies to buy exactly 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:18.040
 they wear raincoats because they are very 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:20.620
 good quality with taped mesh by you 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:23.530
 that is, in fact it is like a piece of awning from 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:27.729
 tents in the model range of a liter is 40 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:29.800
 plus 10 50 and 60 thousand 10 they go with 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:33.190
 marked with el i mean it means that 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:37.240
 there is a woman's back and now I tell you 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:41.169
 tell you what the differences have a female 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:47.470
 backpack from backpacks usual series 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:49.660
 so here we got 6010 slsr either 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:52.389
 here is this flower we are told about 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:54.220
 that this female model is different too 

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:55.169
 many then there are no differences in 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:58.720
 materials 

00:04:55.169 --> 00:05:01.680
 accessories snake all at the highest 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:05.229
 level as in the entire line of contact games 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:08.289
 here here here it differs only in this, and 

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:11.020
 here this part here these shoulder straps they 

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:14.050
 first themselves already compared to 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:16.600
 ordinary and contacts and they are located 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:19.590
 closer to each other that is it is calculated 

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:25.420
 on thin shoulders on narrow neck that is on 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:28.610
 female anatomical structure and here 

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:31.460
 lap belts they are also a little bit 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:33.440
 differ from the usual ones in the usual 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:35.870
 her VKontakte they are exactly 

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:37.640
 parallel to each other then here they are 

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:38.420
 slightly tilted at the top 

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:41.360
 inside 

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:43.010
 This is done to not sit under 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:47.900
 on women's waist 

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:49.790
 In principle, this and all the differences are also air 

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:55.520
 contact is very well thought out 

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:58.630
 functionally it has primary access to 

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:58.630
 backpack on top 

00:05:59.879 --> 00:06:07.770
 he also has very low access 

00:06:03.069 --> 00:06:13.120
 comfortable inside there is a special 

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:16.210
 support that can pull up and 

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:18.279
 make the lower compartment separate so you 

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:23.770
 could get something quickly from below and 

00:06:18.279 --> 00:06:26.469
 on top of you nothing fell also they with 

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:28.449
 last year, if not mistaken, we started 

00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:32.279
 do here is such a very convenient 

00:06:28.449 --> 00:06:35.169
 access right in the middle of the backpack 

00:06:32.279 --> 00:06:37.839
 that is, if you need to get something 

00:06:35.169 --> 00:06:39.270
 even from the center it is done very 

00:06:37.839 --> 00:06:42.310
 easy and fast 

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:44.889
 I will immediately say that on this valve 

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:48.999
 the covers they made such very beautiful 

00:06:44.889 --> 00:06:50.560
 stylized semi useful loops where 

00:06:48.999 --> 00:06:52.509
 you can use something with the carbine 

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:54.419
 fasten either do here 

00:06:52.509 --> 00:07:02.139
 lacing and also something to fasten 

00:06:54.419 --> 00:07:05.649
 naturally side pockets have very 

00:07:02.139 --> 00:07:08.250
 convenient location snake made 

00:07:05.649 --> 00:07:12.310
 In the way that 

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:17.560
 if you insert karemat here or 

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:19.779
 let's stick to the tent you always 

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:22.300
 had access a backpack that is right here 

00:07:19.779 --> 00:07:26.169
 there is a karemat but you can always 

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:31.149
 zalez in this pocket and get something in 

00:07:26.169 --> 00:07:35.949
 past past seasons the downside was 

00:07:31.149 --> 00:07:39.639
 the fact that he's here, these side braces they 

00:07:35.949 --> 00:07:42.849
 fairly short and our standard 

00:07:39.639 --> 00:07:44.409
 karemata they just did not fit here 

00:07:42.849 --> 00:07:46.599
 but firm children 

00:07:44.409 --> 00:07:49.529
 quickly responded to this and 

00:07:46.599 --> 00:07:52.869
 Now she additionally delivers 

00:07:49.529 --> 00:07:55.569
 extension cords for these screeds 

00:07:52.869 --> 00:07:58.689
 having come a gnome shop and buy a backpack you 

00:07:55.569 --> 00:08:00.449
 You can also purchase additional 

00:07:58.689 --> 00:08:03.639
 expand or in order to do 

00:08:00.449 --> 00:08:06.099
 more and you were able to consolidate all that 

00:08:03.639 --> 00:08:08.949
