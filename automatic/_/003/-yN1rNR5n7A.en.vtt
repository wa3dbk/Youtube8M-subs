tripod here but it'll hold it in place
nice<00:01:57.060> and<00:01:57.240> nice<00:01:57.390> and<00:01:57.600> firm<00:01:57.780> once<00:01:58.590> you<00:01:58.710> do<00:01:58.860> this

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
nice and nice and firm once you do this

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.760 
nice and nice and firm once you do this
though<00:02:00.140> essentially<00:02:01.140> you're<00:02:01.320> rewriting<00:02:01.680> the

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
though essentially you're rewriting the

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.139 
though essentially you're rewriting the
electricity<00:02:02.310> into<00:02:02.610> this<00:02:02.700> little<00:02:02.820> bottom

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
electricity into this little bottom

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.760 
electricity into this little bottom
compartment<00:02:03.450> this<00:02:04.320> little<00:02:04.560> bottom

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
compartment this little bottom

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.469 
compartment this little bottom
compartment<00:02:05.070> can<00:02:05.430> take<00:02:05.610> two<00:02:05.820> batteries<00:02:06.270> which

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
compartment can take two batteries which

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:06.920 
compartment can take two batteries which
is<00:02:06.630> fan

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
is fan

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.540 
is fan
because<00:02:07.350> now<00:02:07.500> you've<00:02:07.680> increased<00:02:08.070> the<00:02:08.399> amount

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
because now you've increased the amount

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.030 
because now you've increased the amount
of<00:02:08.670> time<00:02:08.910> you<00:02:09.149> can<00:02:09.180> shoot<00:02:09.680> so<00:02:10.680> we'll<00:02:10.800> put<00:02:10.950> those

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:11.040 
of time you can shoot so we'll put those

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:15.710 
of time you can shoot so we'll put those
two<00:02:11.220> batteries<00:02:11.580> in<00:02:12.620> close<00:02:13.620> it<00:02:13.770> up<00:02:13.860> and<00:02:14.480> we<00:02:15.480> are

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
two batteries in close it up and we are

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.960 
two batteries in close it up and we are
good<00:02:16.380> to<00:02:16.410> go<00:02:18.140> okay<00:02:19.340> my<00:02:20.340> memory<00:02:20.580> card<00:02:20.730> Wow

this the almost assembled battery packs
with<00:02:25.770> 5100<00:02:26.460> if<00:02:26.790> the<00:02:27.090> problem<00:02:27.570> is<00:02:27.720> that<00:02:27.960> there's

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
with 5100 if the problem is that there's

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.560 
with 5100 if the problem is that there's
no<00:02:28.440> intelligent<00:02:28.980> communication<00:02:29.280> between<00:02:29.730> the

the<00:02:33.090> way<00:02:33.330> that<00:02:33.750> you<00:02:33.960> would<00:02:34.110> trigger<00:02:34.940> if<00:02:35.940> you're

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
the way that you would trigger if you're

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.610 
the way that you would trigger if you're
shooting<00:02:36.240> vertically<00:02:36.810> so<00:02:37.260> you<00:02:37.290> have<00:02:37.500> the

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
shooting vertically so you have the

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.020 
shooting vertically so you have the
button<00:02:37.860> here<00:02:38.100> it's<00:02:38.580> not<00:02:38.730> going<00:02:38.850> to<00:02:38.940> do

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
button here it's not going to do

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.370 
button here it's not going to do
anything<00:02:39.390> there's<00:02:39.750> two<00:02:39.900> different<00:02:40.140> types<00:02:40.290> of

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
anything there's two different types of

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.150 
anything there's two different types of
battery<00:02:40.620> packs<00:02:40.860> one<00:02:41.459> of<00:02:41.640> them<00:02:43.010> will<00:02:44.010> have<00:02:44.100> a

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
battery packs one of them will have a

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.570 
battery packs one of them will have a
little<00:02:44.370> I<00:02:44.550> infrared<00:02:45.620> transmitter<00:02:46.620> here<00:02:46.890> that

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
little I infrared transmitter here that

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.120 
little I infrared transmitter here that
sends<00:02:47.850> out<00:02:47.940> the<00:02:48.030> signal<00:02:48.420> like<00:02:48.570> your<00:02:48.720> ml<00:02:49.709> 11

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
sends out the signal like your ml 11

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.610 
sends out the signal like your ml 11
remote<00:02:50.310> control<00:02:50.640> will<00:02:50.850> okay<00:02:51.390> the<00:02:52.380> problem

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
remote control will okay the problem

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.770 
remote control will okay the problem
with<00:02:52.890> that<00:02:52.920> is<00:02:53.190> that<00:02:53.220> you<00:02:54.120> have<00:02:54.150> to<00:02:54.480> have<00:02:54.660> the

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
with that is that you have to have the

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.600 
with that is that you have to have the
camera<00:02:55.170> in<00:02:55.350> remote<00:02:55.830> mode<00:02:55.860> in<00:02:56.220> order<00:02:56.280> for<00:02:56.550> that

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
camera in remote mode in order for that

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.240 
camera in remote mode in order for that
to<00:02:56.670> work<00:02:57.020> now<00:02:58.020> the<00:02:58.080> other<00:02:58.350> way<00:02:58.560> to<00:02:58.620> do<00:02:58.800> it<00:02:58.830> is<00:02:59.100> to

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
to work now the other way to do it is to

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.400 
to work now the other way to do it is to
get<00:02:59.400> one<00:03:00.060> of<00:03:00.180> these<00:03:00.270> bottom<00:03:00.720> units<00:03:01.020> that

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
get one of these bottom units that

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.530 
get one of these bottom units that
doesn't<00:03:01.950> have<00:03:02.100> that<00:03:02.130> little<00:03:02.340> infrared<00:03:03.000> sensor

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
doesn't have that little infrared sensor

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.610 
doesn't have that little infrared sensor
instead<00:03:04.500> it<00:03:04.920> has<00:03:05.430> this<00:03:05.670> little<00:03:06.440> outlet<00:03:07.440> on<00:03:07.530> the

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
instead it has this little outlet on the

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.550 
instead it has this little outlet on the
side<00:03:07.860> this<00:03:08.670> outlet<00:03:09.120> on<00:03:09.240> the<00:03:09.270> side<00:03:09.560> is

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
side this outlet on the side is

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.310 
side this outlet on the side is
definitely<00:03:11.400> the<00:03:11.670> way<00:03:11.760> to<00:03:11.790> go<00:03:11.989> they<00:03:12.989> come<00:03:13.170> with

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
definitely the way to go they come with

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:14.990 
definitely the way to go they come with
a<00:03:13.410> small<00:03:13.709> little<00:03:13.920> cable<00:03:14.250> right<00:03:14.370> here<00:03:14.610> that

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
a small little cable right here that

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.750 
a small little cable right here that
plugs<00:03:15.209> into<00:03:15.390> the<00:03:15.570> GPS<00:03:16.050> on<00:03:16.290> one<00:03:16.680> end<00:03:16.890> and<00:03:17.130> to<00:03:17.730> the

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
plugs into the GPS on one end and to the

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.050 
plugs into the GPS on one end and to the
bottom<00:03:18.090> compartment<00:03:18.300> on<00:03:18.570> the<00:03:18.690> other<00:03:18.840> like<00:03:19.440> so

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
bottom compartment on the other like so

okay<00:03:26.100> is<00:03:26.370> it<00:03:26.580> beautiful<00:03:27.000> no<00:03:27.420> does<00:03:27.870> it<00:03:28.020> work<00:03:28.200> yes

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:28.770 
okay is it beautiful no does it work yes

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:31.550 
okay is it beautiful no does it work yes
now<00:03:29.550> that<00:03:29.700> this<00:03:29.790> is<00:03:29.970> in<00:03:30.000> this<00:03:30.180> position<00:03:30.330> I<00:03:30.840> can

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
now that this is in this position I can

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.350 
now that this is in this position I can
shoot<00:03:31.950> vertically<00:03:32.430> and<00:03:32.670> it'll<00:03:33.060> know<00:03:33.180> that

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
shoot vertically and it'll know that

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.870 
shoot vertically and it'll know that
it's<00:03:33.480> you<00:03:33.960> know<00:03:33.990> it's<00:03:34.230> triggering<00:03:34.800> off<00:03:35.040> okay

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
it's you know it's triggering off okay

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:36.740 
it's you know it's triggering off okay
as<00:03:36.000> you<00:03:36.120> can<00:03:36.180> see<00:03:36.270> now<00:03:36.450> this<00:03:36.510> is<00:03:36.660> this

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
as you can see now this is this

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.090 
as you can see now this is this
disciplining<00:03:37.350> because<00:03:37.680> of<00:03:37.770> the<00:03:37.830> fact<00:03:38.010> that

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
disciplining because of the fact that

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.250 
disciplining because of the fact that
I'm<00:03:38.160> doing<00:03:38.250> the<00:03:38.460> tricks<00:03:38.730> so<00:03:39.450> this<00:03:39.900> is<00:03:40.020> a<00:03:40.080> great

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
I'm doing the tricks so this is a great

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.949 
I'm doing the tricks so this is a great
thing<00:03:40.380> to<00:03:40.410> have<00:03:40.940> disadvantages<00:03:41.940> is<00:03:42.540> that<00:03:42.870> they

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
thing to have disadvantages is that they

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:45.890 
thing to have disadvantages is that they
are<00:03:43.290> the<00:03:43.410> fact<00:03:43.590> that<00:03:43.770> a<00:03:44.100> yeah<00:03:44.910> this<00:03:45.120> huge<00:03:45.540> bulky

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
are the fact that a yeah this huge bulky

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.060 
are the fact that a yeah this huge bulky
water<00:03:46.080> come<00:03:46.290> has<00:03:46.440> a<00:03:46.530> side<00:03:46.709> of<00:03:46.800> your<00:03:46.890> camera

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:47.070 
water come has a side of your camera

sure<00:05:26.960> it's<00:05:27.110> completely<00:05:27.590> tight<00:05:29.380> and<00:05:30.380> once<00:05:31.370> it

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:31.460 
sure it's completely tight and once it

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:32.470 
sure it's completely tight and once it
sitting<00:05:31.640> up<00:05:31.700> see<00:05:31.820> little<00:05:32.030> green<00:05:32.090> indicator

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:32.480 
sitting up see little green indicator

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:34.930 
sitting up see little green indicator
come<00:05:32.630> on<00:05:32.780> okay<00:05:33.620> now<00:05:34.400> how<00:05:34.550> do<00:05:34.610> you<00:05:34.670> change<00:05:34.850> the

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:34.940 
come on okay now how do you change the

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:36.700 
come on okay now how do you change the
battery<00:05:35.150> sure<00:05:35.540> you<00:05:35.660> have<00:05:35.780> battery<00:05:36.110> inside

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:36.710 
battery sure you have battery inside

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:38.620 
battery sure you have battery inside
I<00:05:36.740> usually<00:05:37.160> don't<00:05:37.580> work<00:05:38.090> with<00:05:38.270> a<00:05:38.300> battery<00:05:38.540> on

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:38.630 
I usually don't work with a battery on

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:40.420 
I usually don't work with a battery on
the<00:05:38.720> inside<00:05:38.990> I<00:05:39.260> usually<00:05:39.860> just<00:05:39.980> use<00:05:40.040> the<00:05:40.130> one

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:40.430 
the inside I usually just use the one

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:46.240 
the inside I usually just use the one
battery<00:05:42.220> on<00:05:43.220> the<00:05:43.700> tray<00:05:43.940> and<00:05:44.650> and<00:05:45.650> that's<00:05:45.890> it

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:46.250 
battery on the tray and and that's it

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:49.300 
battery on the tray and and that's it
these<00:05:46.670> batteries<00:05:47.090> on<00:05:47.180> the<00:05:47.210> Nikon<00:05:48.250> d7000<00:05:49.250> as

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:49.310 
these batteries on the Nikon d7000 as

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:51.700 
these batteries on the Nikon d7000 as
well<00:05:49.430> as<00:05:49.490> on<00:05:49.580> the<00:05:49.640> 3300<00:05:50.450> lasts<00:05:50.930> a<00:05:51.140> lot<00:05:51.650> longer

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:51.710 
well as on the 3300 lasts a lot longer

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:54.370 
well as on the 3300 lasts a lot longer
than<00:05:52.130> they<00:05:52.310> do<00:05:52.490> on<00:05:52.730> the<00:05:53.270> lower<00:05:53.450> series<00:05:53.900> so<00:05:54.350> I

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:54.380 
than they do on the lower series so I

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:56.290 
than they do on the lower series so I
really<00:05:54.710> don't<00:05:54.830> need<00:05:55.190> to<00:05:55.340> have<00:05:55.490> two<00:05:55.970> batteries

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:56.300 
really don't need to have two batteries

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:59.050 
really don't need to have two batteries
in<00:05:56.540> here<00:05:56.570> but<00:05:57.260> you<00:05:57.590> can<00:05:57.830> so<00:05:58.580> once<00:05:58.790> you<00:05:58.880> have<00:05:58.940> the

00:05:59.050 --> 00:05:59.060 
in here but you can so once you have the

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:00.790 
in here but you can so once you have the
battery<00:05:59.330> in<00:05:59.390> place<00:05:59.450> I'll<00:06:00.230> show<00:06:00.500> you<00:06:00.620> how<00:06:00.740> to

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:00.800 
battery in place I'll show you how to

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:04.180 
battery in place I'll show you how to
move<00:06:01.040> them<00:06:01.190> okay<00:06:01.940> you<00:06:02.000> push<00:06:02.420> down<00:06:02.920> drop<00:06:03.920> it<00:06:04.070> out

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:04.190 
move them okay you push down drop it out

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:08.190 
move them okay you push down drop it out
okay<00:06:05.500> once<00:06:06.500> it<00:06:06.620> clicks<00:06:06.770> the<00:06:07.130> desert<00:06:07.430> then

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:08.200 
okay once it clicks the desert then

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:12.130 
okay once it clicks the desert then
slide<00:06:09.200> it<00:06:09.320> in<00:06:09.760> rock<00:06:10.760> it<00:06:10.940> and<00:06:11.060> you're<00:06:11.930> good<00:06:12.050> to

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:12.140 
slide it in rock it and you're good to

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:12.280 
slide it in rock it and you're good to
go

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:12.290 
go

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:16.360 
go
you<00:06:12.920> start<00:06:13.130> firing<00:06:13.310> away<00:06:14.590> okay<00:06:15.590> so<00:06:16.190> that's

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:16.370 
you start firing away okay so that's

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:17.500 
you start firing away okay so that's
basically<00:06:16.610> the<00:06:16.700> difference<00:06:16.820> between<00:06:17.120> having

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:17.510 
basically the difference between having

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:19.090 
basically the difference between having
an<00:06:17.690> intelligent<00:06:17.930> battery<00:06:18.470> grip<00:06:18.680> and<00:06:18.830> having<00:06:19.070> a

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:19.100 
an intelligent battery grip and having a

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:20.560 
an intelligent battery grip and having a
non<00:06:19.280> intuitive<00:06:19.580> battery<00:06:19.940> grip<00:06:20.060> like<00:06:20.210> a<00:06:20.240> 50<00:06:20.450> 50

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:20.570 
non intuitive battery grip like a 50 50

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:23.350 
non intuitive battery grip like a 50 50
100<00:06:21.170> I<00:06:21.890> know<00:06:22.220> that<00:06:22.640> I<00:06:22.700> was<00:06:22.820> very<00:06:22.970> much<00:06:23.150> confused

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:23.360 
100 I know that I was very much confused

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:25.030 
100 I know that I was very much confused
about<00:06:23.600> this<00:06:23.810> before<00:06:24.170> I<00:06:24.200> actually<00:06:24.500> owned<00:06:24.770> both

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:25.040 
about this before I actually owned both

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:26.680 
about this before I actually owned both
and<00:06:25.820> hopefully<00:06:26.090> this<00:06:26.210> will<00:06:26.300> give<00:06:26.450> you<00:06:26.510> some

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:26.690 
and hopefully this will give you some

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:29.200 
and hopefully this will give you some
idea<00:06:26.960> of<00:06:27.080> how<00:06:27.470> they<00:06:27.620> work<00:06:27.860> now<00:06:28.580> again<00:06:28.940> with

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:29.210 
idea of how they work now again with

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:32.500 
idea of how they work now again with
this<00:06:29.570> this<00:06:30.200> battery<00:06:30.610> 27000<00:06:31.670> another<00:06:32.030> huge

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:32.510 
this this battery 27000 another huge

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:34.240 
this this battery 27000 another huge
advantage<00:06:32.630> of<00:06:32.930> having<00:06:33.080> this<00:06:33.320> is<00:06:33.530> the<00:06:34.010> fact

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:34.250 
advantage of having this is the fact

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:35.500 
advantage of having this is the fact
that<00:06:34.340> I<00:06:34.460> can<00:06:34.760> shoot<00:06:34.910> in<00:06:35.000> the<00:06:35.090> vertical<00:06:35.390> there's

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:35.510 
that I can shoot in the vertical there's

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:37.600 
that I can shoot in the vertical there's

focus point here I have everything that

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:52.980 
focus point here I have everything that
I<00:06:48.710> have<00:06:49.630> when<00:06:50.630> I<00:06:50.660> shoot<00:06:50.960> in<00:06:51.200> the<00:06:51.350> horizontal<00:06:51.640> so

I have when I shoot in the horizontal so

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:54.910 
I have when I shoot in the horizontal so
this<00:06:53.990> is<00:06:54.080> one<00:06:54.170> of<00:06:54.260> those<00:06:54.350> huge<00:06:54.500> differences

00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:54.920 
this is one of those huge differences

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:57.250 
this is one of those huge differences
between<00:06:55.070> the<00:06:55.250> 50<00:06:55.750> 187,000<00:06:56.750> yes<00:06:56.990> they<00:06:57.140> have<00:06:57.230> the

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:57.260 
between the 50 187,000 yes they have the

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:58.870 
between the 50 187,000 yes they have the
same<00:06:57.320> sensor<00:06:57.890> but<00:06:58.310> when<00:06:58.490> you<00:06:58.550> start<00:06:58.730> adding

00:06:58.870 --> 00:06:58.880 
same sensor but when you start adding

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:00.370 
same sensor but when you start adding
frills<00:06:59.300> on<00:06:59.480> there<00:06:59.690> in<00:06:59.870> terms<00:07:00.020> of<00:07:00.170> battery

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:00.380 
frills on there in terms of battery

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:03.010 
frills on there in terms of battery
clips<00:07:00.770> GPS<00:07:01.310> everything<00:07:01.730> else<00:07:01.880> they<00:07:02.630> all

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:03.020 
clips GPS everything else they all

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:05.980 
clips GPS everything else they all
worked<00:07:03.470> a<00:07:03.650> lot<00:07:03.770> better<00:07:03.980> for<00:07:04.190> the<00:07:04.280> 7000<00:07:04.880> and<00:07:05.030> you

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:05.990 
worked a lot better for the 7000 and you

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:07.060 
worked a lot better for the 7000 and you
can<00:07:06.140> see<00:07:06.290> it<00:07:06.410> obviously<00:07:06.470> looked<00:07:06.830> a<00:07:06.860> lot<00:07:07.010> more

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:07.070 
can see it obviously looked a lot more

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:09.460 
can see it obviously looked a lot more
professional<00:07:07.370> and<00:07:07.820> it<00:07:08.540> functions<00:07:09.080> a<00:07:09.230> lot<00:07:09.350> more

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:09.470 
professional and it functions a lot more

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:10.630 
professional and it functions a lot more
professional<00:07:09.590> because<00:07:10.070> you<00:07:10.160> can<00:07:10.280> get<00:07:10.490> your

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:10.640 
professional because you can get your

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:12.790 
professional because you can get your
options<00:07:11.030> in<00:07:11.840> terms<00:07:12.020> of<00:07:12.230> aperture<00:07:12.740> and

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:12.800 
options in terms of aperture and

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:15.790 
options in terms of aperture and
everything<00:07:13.100> else<00:07:13.250> a<00:07:13.580> lot<00:07:14.030> more<00:07:14.530> rapidly<00:07:15.530> than
