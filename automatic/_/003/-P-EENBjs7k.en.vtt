00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
traffic right here we have a table and

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.170 
traffic right here we have a table and
basically<00:00:48.899> it<00:00:49.320> is<00:00:49.440> an<00:00:49.590> electric<00:00:49.980> table<00:00:50.399> you

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
basically it is an electric table you

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.630 
basically it is an electric table you
know<00:00:51.420> it'll<00:00:51.719> go<00:00:51.960> down<00:00:52.170> pretty<00:00:53.070> much<00:00:53.280> to<00:00:53.460> about

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
know it'll go down pretty much to about

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.130 
know it'll go down pretty much to about
18

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:58.660

now<00:02:30.190> what<00:02:30.460> we<00:02:30.550> can<00:02:30.760> move<00:02:30.910> into<00:02:31.120> I'm<00:02:31.600> going<00:02:31.750> to

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
now what we can move into I'm going to

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.870 
now what we can move into I'm going to
see<00:02:32.080> I<00:02:32.290> want<00:02:32.470> to<00:02:32.500> show<00:02:32.650> you<00:02:32.710> how<00:02:32.950> air

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
see I want to show you how air

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.670 
see I want to show you how air
conditioning<00:02:34.450> works<00:02:34.960> I<00:02:35.170> would<00:02:35.230> tell<00:02:35.470> you<00:02:35.500> it's

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
conditioning works I would tell you it's

conditioning works I would tell you it's
going<00:02:35.800> to<00:02:35.860> be<00:02:35.920> very<00:02:36.070> comfortable

00:02:40.839 --> 00:02:40.849 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:42.759 

so<00:02:41.329> there's<00:02:41.510> your<00:02:41.599> air-conditioning<00:02:42.349> unit

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:42.769 
so there's your air-conditioning unit

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:44.920 
so there's your air-conditioning unit
there<00:02:43.310> are<00:02:43.340> the<00:02:43.549> two<00:02:43.760> that<00:02:43.969> he<00:02:44.030> was<00:02:44.239> talking

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
there are the two that he was talking

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.020 
there are the two that he was talking
about<00:02:45.019> one<00:02:45.920> towards<00:02:46.340> the<00:02:46.400> front<00:02:46.670> of<00:02:46.730> the<00:02:46.849> van

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
about one towards the front of the van

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.089 
about one towards the front of the van
and<00:02:47.359> one<00:02:47.989> towards<00:02:48.349> the<00:02:48.409> back<00:02:48.650> of<00:02:48.680> the<00:02:48.889> van

00:02:49.089 --> 00:02:49.099 
and one towards the back of the van

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:50.830 
and one towards the back of the van
comes<00:02:49.549> in<00:02:49.700> handy<00:02:49.909> when<00:02:50.269> you<00:02:50.420> have<00:02:50.450> some

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
comes in handy when you have some

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.360 
comes in handy when you have some
humidity<00:02:51.379> in<00:02:51.469> here<00:02:51.680> so<00:02:51.829> that<00:02:51.980> will<00:02:52.040> just<00:02:52.219> suck

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
humidity in here so that will just suck

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.030 
humidity in here so that will just suck
up<00:02:52.519> the<00:02:52.730> air<00:02:53.439> they<00:02:54.439> were<00:02:54.499> here

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
up the air they were here

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.679 
up the air they were here
we<00:02:55.760> have<00:02:55.969> the<00:02:56.389> control<00:02:57.700> all<00:02:58.700> the<00:02:59.150> workings<00:02:59.569> of

00:02:59.679 --> 00:02:59.689 
we have the control all the workings of

00:02:59.689 --> 00:03:02.280 
we have the control all the workings of
the<00:02:59.840> van<00:03:00.049> we<00:03:00.560> have<00:03:00.889> actually<00:03:01.609> at<00:03:01.670> your<00:03:01.819> yard

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
the van we have actually at your yard

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.410 
the van we have actually at your yard
your<00:03:03.290> generator<00:03:03.739> right<00:03:03.980> here<00:03:04.310> and<00:03:04.549> just<00:03:05.269> push

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
your generator right here and just push

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.009 
your generator right here and just push
the<00:03:05.540> button<00:03:05.840> it<00:03:06.290> has<00:03:07.069> a<00:03:07.459> basic<00:03:08.329> I<00:03:08.419> might<00:03:08.599> let

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:09.019 
the button it has a basic I might let

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:10.479 
the button it has a basic I might let
you<00:03:09.049> know<00:03:09.260> when<00:03:09.439> it's<00:03:09.560> time<00:03:09.620> for<00:03:09.950> servicing

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489 
you know when it's time for servicing

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:13.030 
you know when it's time for servicing
and<00:03:10.900> then<00:03:11.900> we<00:03:11.989> have<00:03:12.230> control<00:03:12.499> kind<00:03:12.739> of<00:03:12.859> here

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
and then we have control kind of here

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.300 
and then we have control kind of here
basically<00:03:13.340> it<00:03:13.879> shows<00:03:14.180> you<00:03:15.010> push<00:03:16.010> this<00:03:16.159> how

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
basically it shows you push this how

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.009 
basically it shows you push this how
