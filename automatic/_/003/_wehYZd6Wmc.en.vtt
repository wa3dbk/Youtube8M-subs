00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 in February the actor a prize for 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.569
 innovative energy solutions was 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.440
 granted to the company suisse clÃ©ston 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:09.620
 energy 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.300
 the company developed a solar cell 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:14.040
 sensitized by dye 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.850
 what these solar panels have to 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.920
 different from traditional models 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:22.830
 honeyman dumont they produce less 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.420
 energy but work during a period of 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.090
 much longer than the day 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.550
 begin at first light at 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.369
 six in the morning and generate energy to the 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.440
 eight o'clock at night 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:36.270
 technology was invented developed 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.040
 by Professor Richard Gray, he told the 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.629
 over 20 years 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.090
 its particularity is that it works 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.550
 such as plant photosynthesis 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.469
 such as chlorophyll in leaves the cell 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.940
 large it uses a special dye 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:52.320
 which absorb light and generate electrons 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:56.010
 worry not forget that 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.449
 photosynthesis has worked well at 3.5 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.859
 billion years 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.980
 is a principle that has been shown 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.899
 efficient in comparison to the 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.210
 the current version of the strike 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.220
 cheaper to produce as soon as it 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:12.409
 produced in large quantities 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.409
 will be cheaper available to all 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:18.430
 several Japanese companies accompany the 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:21.380
 greece cell development 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:23.540
 the company that won the godoy award 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.450
 currently employs 17 people and should 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:28.370
 contracting more than 50 cells are 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.110
 transparent and has a shelf life of 25 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:32.510
 years as opposed to cells 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:35.300
 traditional they are not installed in 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:37.160
 roofs but on walls walls up 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:39.890
 even used as decorative elements 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.690
 Tone intended to cells 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.450
 function with light and can be 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:46.729
 installed inside already exist 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.460
 some from geneva airport 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:51.670
 the idea is to capture the energy wherever 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.670
 she is
