00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:09.889 
like to start out a nice tuning video on

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:12.259 
like to start out a nice tuning video on
how<00:00:10.889> well<00:00:11.160> you<00:00:11.370> know<00:00:11.550> if<00:00:11.730> it's<00:00:11.880> tuned<00:00:12.150> you're

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
how well you know if it's tuned you're

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.259 
how well you know if it's tuned you're
not<00:00:12.300> by<00:00:12.929> when<00:00:13.110> you<00:00:13.200> start<00:00:13.590> it<00:00:13.730> when<00:00:14.730> you<00:00:14.849> start

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
not by when you start it when you start

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:27.560 
not by when you start it when you start
it<00:00:24.949> if<00:00:25.949> you<00:00:26.279> hear<00:00:26.519> that<00:00:26.670> but<00:00:26.880> if<00:00:26.970> it<00:00:27.119> cuts<00:00:27.359> off

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
it if you hear that but if it cuts off

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.439 
it if you hear that but if it cuts off
then<00:00:28.380> you're<00:00:28.710> probably<00:00:29.429> running<00:00:29.849> too<00:00:30.210> weak

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
then you're probably running too weak

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.380 
then you're probably running too weak
this<00:00:31.320> engine<00:00:31.769> is<00:00:31.920> heated<00:00:32.189> up<00:00:32.489> so<00:00:32.820> it<00:00:32.969> should<00:00:33.239> be

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
this engine is heated up so it should be

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:52.280 
this engine is heated up so it should be
running<00:00:33.780> fine<00:00:33.989> my<00:00:34.290> person

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:52.290

when I guess it which I already got the

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.420 
when I guess it which I already got the
idle<00:01:01.650> screw<00:01:01.770> at<00:01:02.579> a<00:01:03.030> good<00:01:03.390> pace<00:01:03.600> right<00:01:03.900> now<00:01:04.430> so

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
idle screw at a good pace right now so

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:06.950 
idle screw at a good pace right now so
I'm<00:01:05.760> gonna<00:01:06.000> start<00:01:06.270> messing<00:01:06.600> with<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.780> other

I'm gonna start messing with the other
screws<00:01:07.260> I'm<00:01:07.470> not<00:01:07.800> gonna<00:01:07.950> mess<00:01:08.130> with<00:01:08.250> that

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
screws I'm not gonna mess with that

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.240 
screws I'm not gonna mess with that
obscure<00:01:08.670> anymore<00:01:09.000> so<00:01:09.270> I'm<00:01:09.360> gonna<00:01:09.509> mess<00:01:09.780> with

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.250 
obscure anymore so I'm gonna mess with

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:16.490 
obscure anymore so I'm gonna mess with
the<00:01:12.080> lisby<00:01:13.080> needle<00:01:13.350> and<00:01:14.810> top<00:01:15.810> carbonate<00:01:16.259> over

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
the lisby needle and top carbonate over

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.680 
the lisby needle and top carbonate over
here<00:01:16.970> we're<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.060> field<00:01:20.000> I'm<00:01:21.000> gonna<00:01:21.180> start<00:01:21.450> up

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:21.690 
here we're the field I'm gonna start up

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.320 
here we're the field I'm gonna start up
again<00:01:21.840> I<00:01:22.520> want<00:01:23.520> you<00:01:23.580> to<00:01:23.670> pay<00:01:23.850> attention<00:01:24.090> to

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
when I guess it where it's going to

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.380 
when I guess it where it's going to
kinda<00:01:28.020> like<00:01:28.110> bog<00:01:28.410> down<00:01:28.770> and<00:01:29.190> start<00:01:30.119> catching

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
kinda like bog down and start catching

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:39.020 
kinda like bog down and start catching
rpms

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.530 

like<00:01:40.030> that<00:01:40.860> so<00:01:41.860> in<00:01:42.040> case<00:01:42.220> you<00:01:42.520> need<00:01:43.270> to<00:01:43.300> know

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:43.540 
like that so in case you need to know

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.530 
like that so in case you need to know
that<00:01:44.140> when<00:01:45.100> you're<00:01:45.220> doing<00:01:45.370> that<00:01:45.670> you're

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:46.540 
that when you're doing that you're

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.420 
that when you're doing that you're
pretty<00:01:46.780> much<00:01:46.990> when<00:01:47.530> you're<00:01:47.680> having<00:01:47.890> fuel<00:01:48.280> in

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:48.430 
pretty much when you're having fuel in

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:51.990 
pretty much when you're having fuel in
here<00:01:48.930> to<00:01:49.930> see<00:01:50.110> they're<00:01:50.260> starving<00:01:50.710> her<00:01:51.000> it

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 
here to see they're starving her it

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:58.120 
needs one so I'm gonna start with my

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:05.160 
needs one so I'm gonna start with my
cart<00:01:58.450> needle<00:01:59.400> right<00:02:00.400> here<00:02:03.840> and<00:02:04.840> I'm<00:02:04.960> going<00:02:05.110> to

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
cart needle right here and I'm going to

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:15.560 
cart needle right here and I'm going to
lean<00:02:05.350> it<00:02:06.090> 1/8<00:02:07.090> turn<00:02:07.890> now<00:02:08.890> start<00:02:09.190> it<00:02:09.250> again

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:21.620 

still<00:02:16.570> no<00:02:16.690> effect<00:02:19.650> one<00:02:20.650> more<00:02:20.890> one<00:02:21.040> eight<00:02:21.160> turn

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
still no effect one more one eight turn

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:49.849 
still no effect one more one eight turn
start<00:02:22.630> it<00:02:22.720> again

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:49.859 

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:53.309 

okay<00:02:50.859> that<00:02:51.189> sounds<00:02:51.519> great<00:02:51.670> but<00:02:52.049> it's<00:02:53.049> still

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:53.319 
okay that sounds great but it's still

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:53.940 
okay that sounds great but it's still
bogging

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
bogging

00:02:53.950 --> 00:03:00.149 
bogging
so<00:02:54.459> I'm<00:02:54.819> gonna<00:02:55.060> lean<00:02:55.329> it<00:02:55.450> out<00:02:55.599> one<00:02:56.439> more<00:02:59.159> one

00:03:00.149 --> 00:03:00.159 
so I'm gonna lean it out one more one

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:29.910 
so I'm gonna lean it out one more one
more<00:03:00.189> 1/8<00:03:00.640> turn

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.060 

okay

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:31.070 
okay

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:36.490 
okay
so<00:03:31.250> now<00:03:31.430> I<00:03:32.260> do<00:03:33.260> think<00:03:33.560> that<00:03:34.960> the<00:03:35.960> low-speed<00:03:36.350> he

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
so now I do think that the low-speed he

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.440 
so now I do think that the low-speed he
was<00:03:36.710> fine<00:03:36.920> with<00:03:37.430> a<00:03:37.520> carb<00:03:37.700> needle<00:03:37.850> great<00:03:38.330> down

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.450 
was fine with a carb needle great down

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.080 
was fine with a carb needle great down
here<00:03:38.480> even<00:03:39.050> the<00:03:39.230> idle<00:03:39.470> screws<00:03:39.680> fine<00:03:39.920> so<00:03:40.910> now

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
here even the idle screws fine so now

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:44.320 
here even the idle screws fine so now
what<00:03:41.270> I'm<00:03:41.360> gonna<00:03:41.450> mess<00:03:41.660> with<00:03:41.800> is<00:03:42.970> this<00:03:43.970> needle

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:44.330 
what I'm gonna mess with is this needle

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:47.080 
what I'm gonna mess with is this needle
this<00:03:45.020> one<00:03:45.230> is<00:03:45.350> set<00:03:45.500> to<00:03:45.710> rich<00:03:45.920> because<00:03:46.310> I<00:03:46.670> can

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
this one is set to rich because I can

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:50.740 
this one is set to rich because I can
just<00:03:47.650> hear<00:03:48.650> it<00:03:48.940> at<00:03:49.940> the<00:03:50.060> low<00:03:50.210> speed<00:03:50.450> obviously

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750 
just hear it at the low speed obviously

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:55.120 
just hear it at the low speed obviously
it's<00:03:51.470> two-lane<00:03:51.950> too<00:03:52.910> much<00:03:53.090> fuel<00:03:54.080> is<00:03:54.680> going<00:03:55.010> in

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:55.130 
it's two-lane too much fuel is going in

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:57.820 
it's two-lane too much fuel is going in
at<00:03:55.250> once<00:03:55.460> so<00:03:55.970> I'm<00:03:56.060> gonna<00:03:56.210> lean<00:03:56.420> it<00:03:56.570> out<00:03:56.830> 1/8

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:57.830 
at once so I'm gonna lean it out 1/8

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:28.939 
at once so I'm gonna lean it out 1/8
turn<00:03:58.160> just<00:03:58.610> like<00:03:58.700> so<00:04:00.400> I'm<00:04:01.400> gonna<00:04:01.580> start<00:04:01.880> it

00:04:28.939 --> 00:04:28.949 

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:32.790 

great<00:04:29.949> and<00:04:30.669> if<00:04:30.940> you<00:04:31.060> notice<00:04:31.449> I'm<00:04:32.350> kind<00:04:32.650> of

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:32.800 
great and if you notice I'm kind of

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.890 
great and if you notice I'm kind of
setting<00:04:33.070> the<00:04:33.340> fuel<00:04:33.639> using<00:04:34.330> this<00:04:34.570> compression

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
setting the fuel using this compression

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.040 
setting the fuel using this compression
hose<00:04:35.229> out<00:04:35.889> of<00:04:36.340> the<00:04:36.490> carburetor<00:04:36.970> so<00:04:37.780> it<00:04:37.900> would

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.050 
hose out of the carburetor so it would

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:40.260 
hose out of the carburetor so it would
stop<00:04:38.289> so<00:04:38.620> I<00:04:38.650> don't<00:04:38.919> burn<00:04:39.370> my<00:04:39.610> finger<00:04:39.940> or

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.270 
stop so I don't burn my finger or

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:42.570 
stop so I don't burn my finger or
pinching<00:04:40.750> that<00:04:40.900> fuel<00:04:41.110> line<00:04:41.169> would<00:04:41.500> also<00:04:42.220> I<00:04:42.400> can

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:42.580 
pinching that fuel line would also I can

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.370 
pinching that fuel line would also I can
pinch<00:04:42.759> my<00:04:42.910> finger<00:04:43.210> there<00:04:43.690> burn<00:04:44.020> my<00:04:44.139> finger

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:44.380 
pinch my finger there burn my finger

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:49.170 
pinch my finger there burn my finger
sorry<00:04:44.590> II<00:04:45.810> that<00:04:46.810> works<00:04:47.139> also<00:04:47.590> effectively<00:04:48.180> and

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:49.180 
sorry II that works also effectively and

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:50.490 
sorry II that works also effectively and
as<00:04:49.389> you<00:04:49.509> see<00:04:49.690> when<00:04:49.840> I'm<00:04:49.930> doing<00:04:50.229> that<00:04:50.350> it's

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:50.500 
as you see when I'm doing that it's

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.439 
as you see when I'm doing that it's
starting<00:04:50.830> to<00:04:50.889> shut<00:04:51.070> off<00:04:51.190> a<00:04:51.220> lot<00:04:51.460> quicker<00:04:51.669> more

00:04:52.439 --> 00:04:52.449 
starting to shut off a lot quicker more

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:54.719 
starting to shut off a lot quicker more
efficiently<00:04:52.919> so<00:04:53.919> what<00:04:54.130> I'm<00:04:54.190> gonna<00:04:54.310> do

00:04:54.719 --> 00:04:54.729 
efficiently so what I'm gonna do

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:58.980 
efficiently so what I'm gonna do
see<00:04:55.090> if<00:04:55.210> I<00:04:55.330> can<00:04:55.600> tune<00:04:56.020> that<00:04:56.229> one<00:04:57.960> e21<00:04:58.960> a

00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:58.990 
see if I can tune that one e21 a

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:07.140 
see if I can tune that one e21 a
clockwise<00:04:59.590> once<00:05:00.130> more<00:05:04.169> so<00:05:05.169> to<00:05:05.349> get<00:05:05.470> stuck<00:05:06.150> one

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:07.150 
clockwise once more so to get stuck one

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:43.520 
clockwise once more so to get stuck one
more<00:05:07.330> eighth<00:05:07.740> turn<00:05:09.030> and<00:05:10.030> then<00:05:10.360> what<00:05:10.509> started

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:43.530 

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:47.130 

great<00:05:44.530> it's<00:05:45.310> starting<00:05:45.610> to<00:05:45.670> look<00:05:46.000> very<00:05:46.060> fine<00:05:46.780> so

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:47.140 
great it's starting to look very fine so

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:48.480 
great it's starting to look very fine so
that's<00:05:47.260> how<00:05:47.500> your<00:05:47.710> engine<00:05:47.950> should<00:05:48.100> start<00:05:48.160> to

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:48.490 
that's how your engine should start to

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:49.620 
that's how your engine should start to
look<00:05:48.640> now

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:49.630 
look now

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:53.900 
look now
lean<00:05:50.110> it<00:05:50.230> out<00:05:50.880> one<00:05:51.880> more<00:05:51.910> eighth<00:05:52.560> clockwise

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:53.910 
lean it out one more eighth clockwise

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:58.500 
lean it out one more eighth clockwise
see<00:05:55.020> if<00:05:56.020> you<00:05:56.230> get<00:05:56.470> any<00:05:56.680> more<00:05:57.270> any<00:05:58.270> better

00:05:58.500 --> 00:05:58.510 
see if you get any more any better

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:00.690 
see if you get any more any better
performance<00:05:59.050> don't<00:06:00.010> mess<00:06:00.160> with<00:06:00.190> any<00:06:00.490> of<00:06:00.610> these

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:00.700 
performance don't mess with any of these

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:02.430 
performance don't mess with any of these
needles<00:06:01.090> because<00:06:01.180> if<00:06:01.450> you<00:06:01.570> start<00:06:01.810> seeing<00:06:02.110> more

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:02.440 
needles because if you start seeing more

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:04.740 
needles because if you start seeing more
and<00:06:02.650> more<00:06:02.710> improvement<00:06:03.460> if<00:06:03.640> you<00:06:03.880> turn<00:06:04.150> out<00:06:04.390> one

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:04.750 
and more improvement if you turn out one

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:07.260 
and more improvement if you turn out one
of<00:06:04.780> the<00:06:04.990> other<00:06:05.020> needles<00:06:05.760> then<00:06:06.760> keep<00:06:07.000> doing

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:07.270 
of the other needles then keep doing

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:33.630 
of the other needles then keep doing
that<00:06:07.450> one<00:06:07.600> until<00:06:07.950> pretty<00:06:08.950> much

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:33.640 

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:36.640 

and<00:06:34.640> it<00:06:35.330> turns<00:06:35.540> off<00:06:35.690> nice<00:06:35.960> and<00:06:35.990> quick<00:06:36.290> okay

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:36.650 
and it turns off nice and quick okay

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:38.560 
and it turns off nice and quick okay
back<00:06:36.950> it's<00:06:37.250> pretty<00:06:37.490> much<00:06:37.580> the<00:06:37.820> end<00:06:37.970> of<00:06:38.120> part<00:06:38.360> 1

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:38.570 
back it's pretty much the end of part 1

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:42.010 
back it's pretty much the end of part 1
I'm<00:06:38.750> tuning<00:06:39.230> your<00:06:39.860> nitro<00:06:40.250> RC<00:06:40.700> the<00:06:41.300> next<00:06:41.600> one<00:06:41.780> is

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:42.020 
I'm tuning your nitro RC the next one is

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:44.440 
I'm tuning your nitro RC the next one is
going<00:06:42.200> to<00:06:42.260> be<00:06:42.350> the<00:06:42.440> road<00:06:42.680> test<00:06:42.950> and<00:06:43.610> see<00:06:44.060> if<00:06:44.090> it

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:44.450 
going to be the road test and see if it

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:46.780 
going to be the road test and see if it
you<00:06:44.900> know<00:06:44.930> it's<00:06:45.170> a<00:06:45.260> two-speed<00:06:45.800> gear<00:06:46.100> so<00:06:46.760> it

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:46.790 
you know it's a two-speed gear so it

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:49.320 
you know it's a two-speed gear so it
needs<00:06:47.180> to<00:06:47.390> be<00:06:47.480> able<00:06:47.570> to<00:06:47.690> shift<00:06:47.990> properly<00:06:48.680> so

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:49.330 
needs to be able to shift properly so

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:54.040 
needs to be able to shift properly so
the<00:06:50.330> next<00:06:50.510> video<00:06:50.780> will<00:06:51.440> be<00:06:51.470> part<00:06:51.830> 2<00:06:52.040> on<00:06:53.050> Road
