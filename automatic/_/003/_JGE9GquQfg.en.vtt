think<00:01:04.170> i<00:01:04.320> was<00:01:04.409> really<00:01:04.530> engaging<00:01:04.860> as<00:01:05.070> at<00:01:05.220> all<00:01:05.369> my

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
think i was really engaging as at all my

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.310 
think i was really engaging as at all my
my<00:01:06.360> glutes<00:01:06.600> are<00:01:06.720> i<00:01:06.780> was<00:01:06.900> really<00:01:07.020> engaging

i'm<00:01:09.869> also<00:01:10.049> trying<00:01:10.740> to<00:01:11.070> kind<00:01:11.280> of<00:01:11.340> put<00:01:11.610> my<00:01:11.760> knees

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
i'm also trying to kind of put my knees

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.390 
i'm also trying to kind of put my knees
over<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.630> bar<00:01:12.780> a<00:01:12.810> little<00:01:12.960> bit<00:01:13.350> um<00:01:13.590> a<00:01:13.920> while

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
over the bar a little bit um a while

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.399 
over the bar a little bit um a while
back<00:01:14.640> I've<00:01:14.939> changed<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.750> barb<00:01:15.960> dish<00:01:16.229> and<00:01:16.380> I

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
back I've changed the barb dish and I

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:17.960 
back I've changed the barb dish and I
put<00:01:16.590> it<00:01:16.680> a<00:01:16.740> little<00:01:16.920> bit<00:01:17.159> further<00:01:17.369> out<00:01:17.640> over<00:01:17.850> my

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
put it a little bit further out over my

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.570 
put it a little bit further out over my
feet<00:01:18.350> obviously<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.680> theory<00:01:20.130> there<00:01:20.310> is<00:01:20.340> that

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
feet obviously the theory there is that

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:21.980 
feet obviously the theory there is that
it<00:01:20.670> allows<00:01:20.759> you<00:01:21.030> to<00:01:21.119> engage<00:01:21.270> your<00:01:21.540> quads<00:01:21.780> a<00:01:21.869> bit

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
it allows you to engage your quads a bit

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.469 
it allows you to engage your quads a bit
more<00:01:22.280> but<00:01:23.280> I<00:01:23.460> wasn't<00:01:23.820> you're<00:01:24.090> doing<00:01:24.299> that<00:01:24.390> I

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
more but I wasn't you're doing that I

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.149 
more but I wasn't you're doing that I
was<00:01:24.630> still<00:01:24.840> kind<00:01:24.869> of<00:01:25.170> sitting<00:01:25.409> quite<00:01:25.740> far<00:01:25.979> back

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
was still kind of sitting quite far back

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.280 
was still kind of sitting quite far back
from<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.430> bart<00:01:26.610> and<00:01:26.850> now<00:01:27.000> I'm<00:01:27.869> keeping<00:01:28.080> the

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
from the bart and now I'm keeping the

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.170 
from the bart and now I'm keeping the
ball<00:01:28.439> where<00:01:28.650> it<00:01:28.680> is<00:01:28.860> but<00:01:29.130> I'm<00:01:29.280> trying<00:01:29.820> to<00:01:29.909> push

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
ball where it is but I'm trying to push

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.330 
ball where it is but I'm trying to push
my<00:01:30.360> knees<00:01:30.570> forwards<00:01:31.049> over<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.409> bar<00:01:31.619> so<00:01:32.220> my

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
my knees forwards over the bar so my

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.620 
my knees forwards over the bar so my
shins<00:01:32.579> are<00:01:32.670> on<00:01:32.790> it<00:01:32.880> which<00:01:33.000> is<00:01:33.119> obviously<00:01:33.390> going

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
shins are on it which is obviously going

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.960 
shins are on it which is obviously going
to<00:01:33.689> allow<00:01:33.900> me<00:01:34.079> to<00:01:34.200> use<00:01:34.350> my<00:01:34.380> to<00:01:35.040> use<00:01:35.369> my<00:01:35.670> quads

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
to allow me to use my to use my quads

happy and I then did my deficit work and
what<00:03:32.220> I'm<00:03:32.340> thinking<00:03:32.670> at<00:03:32.760> the<00:03:32.819> moment<00:03:32.880> whereas

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
what I'm thinking at the moment whereas

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.210 
what I'm thinking at the moment whereas
previously<00:03:33.959> I've<00:03:34.079> been<00:03:34.230> alternating<00:03:34.590> deficit

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
previously I've been alternating deficit

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.479 
previously I've been alternating deficit
work<00:03:35.430> with<00:03:36.049> stiff-legged<00:03:37.049> deadlift<00:03:37.620> I<00:03:37.890> feel

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
work with stiff-legged deadlift I feel

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:39.559 
work with stiff-legged deadlift I feel
like<00:03:38.579> the<00:03:38.670> deficit<00:03:39.060> work<00:03:39.209> is<00:03:39.299> going<00:03:39.420> to<00:03:39.480> be

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:39.569 
like the deficit work is going to be

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:40.970 
like the deficit work is going to be
more<00:03:39.720> beneficial<00:03:39.900> for<00:03:40.410> me<00:03:40.440> so<00:03:40.620> at<00:03:40.739> the<00:03:40.799> moment

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
more beneficial for me so at the moment

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.039 
more beneficial for me so at the moment
I'm<00:03:41.250> just<00:03:41.489> going<00:03:41.670> to<00:03:41.700> do<00:03:41.850> that<00:03:42.030> so<00:03:42.329> my<00:03:42.840> only

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:45.170 
I'm just going to do that so my only
dead<00:03:43.350> leaf<00:03:43.500> accessory<00:03:43.950> will<00:03:44.220> be<00:03:44.400> deficit<00:03:45.000> work

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180
