00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.049
 Hello dear friends with you 

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:09.059
 gameplay this is a review on the game on 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.010
 something like this game is called let's 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.049
 let's see why it is called 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.509
 so first of all I want to note that 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.539
 the missions here are really very much i 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:21.240
 I didn’t even count how many here you are 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:24.119
 necessary hasbro unlock by the teeth 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.609
 it's very interesting and teeth you can 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.320
 earn successfully flying this or 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:32.099
 another mission attacked this mission you 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:35.370
 get 500 teeth for this 400 and here for 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.170
 this whole 600 on unlocking mission 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.870
 I do not have enough money so let's 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.510
 try to go through one of them to 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.899
 earn enough teeth to open 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:48.809
 the next missions and so on 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:51.449
 you must click on the screen and we click 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.910
 take a jump from somewhere with a very 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.910
 high places can be the stratosphere 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.789
 or even from space I don’t know for sure 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:03.650
 we have to fall for a very long time and what 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:06.540
 farther we will go out the higher will 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:08.820
 our point from where we are going to commit 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.320
 This jump control as you understand 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.430
 carried out only by 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.950
 accelerometer 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:17.340
 you can adjust its sensitivity in 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.439
 I'm worth a medium she is not this 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.259
 sensitivity, in principle, enough but 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.420
 I think if we fly all of 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.790
 stratosphere we will have such a speed 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.759
 then the sensitivity medium to us is just 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.189
 will be missed and we want this 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.210
 or not have to put 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:36.119
 sensitivity to extreme to 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.340
 have time to dodge all these 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.710
 here are the walls of the blocks that are here 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:44.070
 attend completely incomprehensible 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:46.350
 buildings but fly them very hard in 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.600
 the end of the mission is waiting for you like this 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.390
 the platform you need to open 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.850
 parachute and land after what you 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.820
 congratulate you get your teeth and 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.259
 you can already open the following cards 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.409
 how let's say this 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:03.420
 we press unlock it opened we spend two 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.979
 and a half thousand teeth but let's 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.300
 let's see what it is 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:09.210
 given 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:11.400
 for now no obstacles i see she 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:13.760
 what is the bonus here 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.350
 very many points let's be 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:19.290
 collect them while you can 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:22.920
 maybe we will earn more amount 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:25.440
 teeth and this will allow us to buy everything 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.390
 steeper, more challenging tracks 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.740
 Here is such a toy with at least 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.250
 original name 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:34.440
 but for some reason our character shouts a 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:37.590
 only if we bump into 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:40.590
 somewhere else and die in other cases 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:43.950
 our character is just quiet and cool 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:46.920
 flying down and trying to collect as much as possible 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:52.350
 more points and land successfully 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:54.240
 I repeat the game is called but I do not know 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:56.970
 how many of these letters are there exactly 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:03:00.090
 original but I think you understand the meaning of the game 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:02.790
 and you can do quite well 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:05.750
 time and have fun jumping them with such 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.750
 incredible heights
