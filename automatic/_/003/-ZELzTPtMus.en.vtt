 The answer comes from the moment the agents arrive and I think 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.539
 my children learn 

00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:14.570
 I have a recognition that people viewed 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:15.949
 collaboration 

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:18.960
 the investigations into the previous communications 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.359
 I thought I was dead 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.810
 so simple 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.189
 on the spot 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:27.140
 he had 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.169
 normal 

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:31.519
 carpenter trains 

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:34.830
 one should have 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:37.350
 putting margins under pressure than doing 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.840
 they think 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.840
 being seated in the beginning 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:44.749
 that reports on the club website 

00:00:44.749 --> 00:00:47.749

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:50.660

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.320

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.680

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:58.470
 walk 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:59.789
 the winning goal 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:00.850
 according to the book 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.379
 I am a personal but in a child's seat 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:06.379
 players must do the plan you think 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.830
 we have a strong team like 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.140
 it becomes a goal they want to see tip 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:20.050
 the ns gonna do the rest i'm commands but they don't need that much 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.100
 the 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.100
 we must enter a beautiful city and participate 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.650
 it back faster 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.650

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.480
 our country counts 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.040
 it was stronger once again 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.300

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.650
 annually it must be normal 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:02.650
 it's about a little playing children 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.370

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:08.499
