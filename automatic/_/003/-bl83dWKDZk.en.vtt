00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:21.520
 hi bros here your idol and raul 03 and mp y 

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:23.470
 this time I bring you a file that 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:26.110
 will modify the appearance of the sky in its 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:28.360
 gta san andreas this file is called 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:30.369
 team esic point that if they have 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:32.080
 asked what is it for or what is it 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:34.090
 what does he do according to what I have 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:36.340
 researched the team exit defines the 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:38.470
 time of day in the game also 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.900
 affects the viewing distance and its 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:42.280
 fuzziness of the map and can also 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.680
 change the color of the sky 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:47.199
 I bring you a team esic that changes the 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:49.269
 color of the sky good enough of 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:52.150
 babble and I'll better teach you how to 

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:54.909
 go in the game but before I'll show you 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:57.670
 how to install it the truth is that it is very 

00:00:54.909 --> 00:00:59.739
 easy but good 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:02.260
 they download the rar file from the 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:06.540
 description after you right click 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.540
 over and then in extract here 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:12.409
 they will extract a folder and open it 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.630
 inside it will come the mod file 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:16.880
 it's called active sync and it's in format 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.189
 of and must move the file to 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.969
 directory of your gta san andreas in the 

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:21.969
 data folder 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:35.320
 when they move him he will tell them that if 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:38.470
 they want to replace the file they have 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:41.440
 you are given to move and replace and ready 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:43.240
 will be installed this mod I recommend 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:47.370
 make a backup of your 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:50.790
 original file now let's go to the game 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:54.260
 What a tranza I am, today I will show you how 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:56.690
 you can see the sky here in san andreas 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:59.600
 the net looks very good to me I like it 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:01.260
 much the sky is changing according to 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.630
 the hour of the day 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:06.300
 and the distance and opacity of the map 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.660
 they see very well not like in other times of 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.660
 shit 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:16.100
 if they are fixed they can also see that the 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.100
 light reflects on me and other objects 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:24.790
 now I will show you how to change the 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.790
 hour changes the tone of the sky 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.620
 every hour of the day has its own color 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:36.560
 of heaven and it looks much better than the 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.750
 original also this mode does not have 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.190
 errors or is incompatible with others 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.680
 ways 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:45.320
 and as I said the sky light 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:48.490
 reflects on me and on other objects too 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.490
 depending on the time 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:56.710
 and something else also has an effect on lnb 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.710
 service 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:11.710
 how can you see the reflection of the car 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.710
 the same changes according to heaven 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:34.480
 ok sc j the snout xd and the 

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:36.850
 video is over but before I will tell you 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.980
 that he has a sign is mine no longer 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:40.780
 agreement where I got it and there's also 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.690
 several people who have doubts about 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:46.450
 what is the mesic tee and good this mode is 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:48.460
 little seen so that's why I made the video 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:51.280
 and also because he had nothing to do 

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:53.140
 xc and another thing I created a menu 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.390
 final for my videos on youtube 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:57.250
 I would like you to comment on what 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:02.280
 it seems but good 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:02.280
 I am chau and raul 03 and mp 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:13.780
 already from the mud in that event bluffing 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:14.380
 no great hollow skeleton talents 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.420
 succeed 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:18.720
 would help the ghetto try again 

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:18.720
 to break
