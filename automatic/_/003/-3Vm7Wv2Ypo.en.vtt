now<00:00:11.220> I'm<00:00:11.340> going<00:00:11.490> to<00:00:11.550> give<00:00:11.730> you<00:00:11.850> a<00:00:11.910> few<00:00:12.120> tips<00:00:12.150> on

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:12.510 
now I'm going to give you a few tips on

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:17.720 
now I'm going to give you a few tips on
good<00:00:13.470> tone<00:00:14.510> okay<00:00:15.510> the<00:00:15.660> first<00:00:15.809> part<00:00:16.170> is<00:00:16.730> finger

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
good tone okay the first part is finger

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.630 
good tone okay the first part is finger
placement<00:00:18.439> when<00:00:19.439> you<00:00:19.529> play<00:00:19.710> a<00:00:19.740> note<00:00:20.010> on<00:00:20.279> the

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
placement when you play a note on the

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.609 
placement when you play a note on the
instrument<00:00:21.119> you<00:00:21.660> want<00:00:21.779> to<00:00:21.930> concentrate<00:00:22.350> on

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
instrument you want to concentrate on

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.660 
instrument you want to concentrate on
tapping<00:00:23.490> about<00:00:24.500> between<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:25.650> fret<00:00:25.950> and<00:00:26.280> the

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
tapping about between the fret and the

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.300 
tapping about between the fret and the
halfway<00:00:26.910> point<00:00:27.320> so<00:00:28.320> for<00:00:28.530> example<00:00:29.010> if<00:00:29.100> you<00:00:29.220> were

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
halfway point so for example if you were

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.939 
halfway point so for example if you were
to<00:00:29.430> divide<00:00:29.640> right<00:00:30.390> here<00:00:30.900> the<00:00:31.170> string<00:00:31.560> between

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
to divide right here the string between

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.950 
to divide right here the string between
the<00:00:32.070> two<00:00:32.250> frets<00:00:32.520> I<00:00:32.790> would<00:00:33.390> aim<00:00:33.570> right<00:00:33.930> between

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
the two frets I would aim right between

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.500 
the two frets I would aim right between
the<00:00:34.680> middle<00:00:34.949> Point<00:00:35.160> and<00:00:35.400> the<00:00:35.489> fret<00:00:35.730> just<00:00:36.330> like

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
the middle Point and the fret just like

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.229 
the middle Point and the fret just like
that<00:00:37.040> so<00:00:38.040> if<00:00:38.160> I<00:00:38.280> were<00:00:38.370> to<00:00:38.460> play<00:00:38.580> a<00:00:38.610> scale<00:00:38.970> for

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
that so if I were to play a scale for

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.890 
that so if I were to play a scale for
example<00:00:39.300> each<00:00:39.900> note

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:43.900 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:47.610 

we'll<00:00:44.410> be<00:00:44.530> placed<00:00:44.830> in<00:00:45.040> that<00:00:45.070> manner<00:00:46.470> now<00:00:47.470> of

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:47.620 
we'll be placed in that manner now of

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:48.870 
we'll be placed in that manner now of
course<00:00:47.800> a<00:00:47.980> lot<00:00:48.130> of<00:00:48.160> times<00:00:48.430> when<00:00:48.610> you<00:00:48.700> play<00:00:48.850> a

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:48.880 
course a lot of times when you play a

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.360 
course a lot of times when you play a
scale<00:00:49.240> fast<00:00:49.630> or<00:00:50.020> you're<00:00:50.110> doing<00:00:50.260> songs<00:00:50.650> you're

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:51.370 
scale fast or you're doing songs you're

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:52.800 
scale fast or you're doing songs you're
not<00:00:51.520> always<00:00:51.790> going<00:00:52.120> to<00:00:52.180> get<00:00:52.270> the<00:00:52.330> finger<00:00:52.720> in

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:52.810 
not always going to get the finger in

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:55.250 
not always going to get the finger in
that<00:00:52.930> exact<00:00:53.320> position<00:00:53.800> and<00:00:53.950> that's<00:00:54.100> okay<00:00:54.670> as

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
that exact position and that's okay as

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.660 
that exact position and that's okay as
you<00:00:56.260> know<00:00:56.440> you<00:00:56.500> could<00:00:56.770> probably<00:00:56.950> tap<00:00:57.280> a<00:00:57.340> little

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:57.670 
you know you could probably tap a little

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.150 
you know you could probably tap a little
further<00:00:57.850> back<00:00:58.210> and<00:00:58.690> still<00:00:59.500> get<00:00:59.650> good<00:00:59.830> sound

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:00.160 
further back and still get good sound

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.680 
further back and still get good sound
but<00:01:00.400> what<00:01:00.580> this<00:01:00.730> does<00:01:00.790> is<00:01:01.150> it<00:01:01.270> optimizes<00:01:03.690> the

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:04.690 
but what this does is it optimizes the

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:06.810 
but what this does is it optimizes the
tone<00:01:04.960> and<00:01:05.350> plus<00:01:05.619> it<00:01:05.740> allows<00:01:05.979> you<00:01:06.130> to<00:01:06.190> feel<00:01:06.520> the

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:06.820 
tone and plus it allows you to feel the

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.520 
tone and plus it allows you to feel the
Fred<00:01:07.119> a<00:01:07.150> little<00:01:07.479> bit<00:01:07.660> so<00:01:07.900> you<00:01:08.050> get<00:01:08.229> a<00:01:08.290> better

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:08.530 
Fred a little bit so you get a better

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.580 
Fred a little bit so you get a better
sense<00:01:08.920> of<00:01:09.100> where<00:01:09.250> you<00:01:09.400> locate<00:01:09.820> it<00:01:10.470> okay<00:01:11.470> the

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.590 
sense of where you locate it okay the

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.730 
sense of where you locate it okay the
next<00:01:11.800> part<00:01:11.890> is<00:01:12.810> sustaining<00:01:13.810> the<00:01:14.020> next<00:01:14.380> string

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:14.740 
next part is sustaining the next string

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.219 
next part is sustaining the next string
and<00:01:14.920> this<00:01:15.040> is<00:01:15.190> something<00:01:15.400> that<00:01:15.570> I<00:01:16.570> work<00:01:17.020> on<00:01:17.200> a

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:17.229 
and this is something that I work on a

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:19.440 
and this is something that I work on a
lot<00:01:17.530> I've<00:01:17.710> discovered<00:01:18.130> is<00:01:18.820> when<00:01:19.119> you<00:01:19.240> play<00:01:19.420> a

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 
lot I've discovered is when you play a

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.050 
lot I've discovered is when you play a
scale<00:01:19.660> for<00:01:20.110> example<00:01:20.250> ascending<00:01:21.250> I<00:01:21.460> play<00:01:21.910> the

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060 
scale for example ascending I play the

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
scale for example ascending I play the
notes<00:01:22.290> and<00:01:23.399> then<00:01:24.399> I<00:01:24.550> leave<00:01:24.790> this<00:01:25.119> note<00:01:25.450> down

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.080 
notes and then I leave this note down

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.789 
notes and then I leave this note down
and<00:01:26.619> play<00:01:26.860> the<00:01:26.890> next<00:01:27.160> two

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
and play the next two

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.410 
and play the next two
and<00:01:29.250> then<00:01:29.400> I<00:01:29.430> move<00:01:29.670> this<00:01:29.790> finger<00:01:30.000> over<00:01:30.329> and

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
and then I move this finger over and

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.410 
and then I move this finger over and
play<00:01:30.540> that<00:01:30.720> one<00:01:30.979> now<00:01:31.979> generally<00:01:32.700> this<00:01:32.880> finger

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
play that one now generally this finger

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.420 
play that one now generally this finger
will<00:01:33.659> move<00:01:34.020> right<00:01:34.560> about<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:34.979> time<00:01:35.189> this

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
will move right about the time this

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.429 
will move right about the time this
finger<00:01:35.790> is<00:01:35.909> going<00:01:36.270> down<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.869> second<00:01:37.290> one

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
finger is going down the second one

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.120 
finger is going down the second one
there<00:01:37.970> for<00:01:38.970> strength<00:01:39.270> purposes<00:01:39.930> what<00:01:40.920> this

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
there for strength purposes what this

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.249 
there for strength purposes what this
does<00:01:41.430> is<00:01:41.909> it<00:01:42.119> gives<00:01:42.240> you<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.539> effect<00:01:42.930> of<00:01:43.080> like

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
does is it gives you the effect of like

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.139 
does is it gives you the effect of like
on<00:01:43.409> a<00:01:43.439> piano<00:01:43.950> when<00:01:44.340> you<00:01:44.460> push<00:01:44.700> down<00:01:44.729> the

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
on a piano when you push down the

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.749 
on a piano when you push down the
sustain<00:01:45.570> pedal<00:01:45.990> it<00:01:46.710> gives<00:01:46.979> you<00:01:47.100> more<00:01:47.310> over

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
sustain pedal it gives you more over

here's<00:01:48.539> an<00:01:48.689> example<00:01:48.810> I'll<00:01:49.320> stop<00:01:49.619> on<00:01:49.799> the

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
here's an example I'll stop on the

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.990 
here's an example I'll stop on the
fourth<00:01:50.220> note

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.970 

now<00:01:53.480> you<00:01:53.540> hear<00:01:53.750> both<00:01:54.020> of<00:01:54.200> those<00:01:54.320> notes<00:01:54.590> on<00:01:54.920> my

now you hear both of those notes on my

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:58.120 
now you hear both of those notes on my
major<00:01:55.550> second<00:01:56.060> together<00:01:56.960> now<00:01:57.830> I'm<00:01:57.920> going<00:01:58.070> to

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
major second together now I'm going to

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.840 
major second together now I'm going to
stop<00:01:58.310> on<00:01:58.490> the<00:01:58.610> fifth<00:01:58.820> note

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.300 

now<00:02:02.390> you'll<00:02:02.930> hear<00:02:03.110> that<00:02:03.320> major<00:02:03.590> third<00:02:03.950> sound

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
now you'll hear that major third sound

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.350 
now you'll hear that major third sound
in<00:02:04.580> there<00:02:05.200> sustaining<00:02:06.460> now<00:02:07.460> play<00:02:07.850> a<00:02:07.880> piece<00:02:08.179> of

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
in there sustaining now play a piece of

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.610 
in there sustaining now play a piece of
the<00:02:08.450> scale

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.820 

so<00:02:13.620> you<00:02:13.710> can<00:02:13.920> hear<00:02:14.100> each<00:02:14.340> note<00:02:14.670> overlap<00:02:15.830> the

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
so you can hear each note overlap the

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.370 
so you can hear each note overlap the
highest<00:02:17.490> note<00:02:17.700> on<00:02:17.910> the<00:02:18.030> previous<00:02:18.480> string<00:02:18.870> you

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
highest note on the previous string you

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.170 
highest note on the previous string you
can<00:02:19.410> do<00:02:19.650> the<00:02:19.770> same<00:02:19.980> thing<00:02:20.250> descending<00:02:20.880> if<00:02:21.060> I

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
can do the same thing descending if I

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.140 
can do the same thing descending if I
play<00:02:21.390> the<00:02:21.510> highest<00:02:21.660> note<00:02:22.020> here<00:02:22.850> I'm<00:02:23.850> coming

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
play the highest note here I'm coming

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.230 
play the highest note here I'm coming
down<00:02:24.360> I'll<00:02:24.990> leave<00:02:25.260> that<00:02:25.290> finger<00:02:25.890> down<00:02:26.240> and

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
down I'll leave that finger down and

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.730 
down I'll leave that finger down and
then<00:02:27.360> I<00:02:27.390> play<00:02:27.600> that<00:02:27.750> one<00:02:27.990> and<00:02:28.260> then<00:02:28.500> this<00:02:28.680> one

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
then I play that one and then this one

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.949 
then I play that one and then this one
and<00:02:29.190> then<00:02:29.490> lift<00:02:29.790> this<00:02:29.940> off<00:02:30.150> and<00:02:30.420> play<00:02:30.540> that<00:02:30.720> one

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
and then lift this off and play that one

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.680 
and then lift this off and play that one
again<00:02:31.740> generally<00:02:32.370> speaking<00:02:32.820> when<00:02:33.600> you're

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
again generally speaking when you're

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.410 
again generally speaking when you're
coming<00:02:33.930> down<00:02:34.340> right<00:02:35.340> about<00:02:35.640> that<00:02:35.850> point<00:02:36.209> was

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
coming down right about that point was

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.630 
coming down right about that point was
when<00:02:36.600> this<00:02:36.690> finger<00:02:36.900> will<00:02:37.140> come<00:02:37.320> up<00:02:37.640> especially

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
when this finger will come up especially

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:39.949 
when this finger will come up especially
when<00:02:38.760> you're<00:02:38.880> playing<00:02:39.060> faster<00:02:39.660> you'll<00:02:39.810> need

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
when you're playing faster you'll need

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:42.290 
when you're playing faster you'll need
the<00:02:40.080> extra<00:02:40.350> time<00:02:40.470> but<00:02:41.430> again<00:02:41.670> you<00:02:42.060> want<00:02:42.180> to

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
the extra time but again you want to

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.320 
the extra time but again you want to
practice<00:02:42.980> trying<00:02:43.980> to<00:02:44.280> sustain<00:02:44.700> the<00:02:44.850> notes<00:02:45.060> as

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
practice trying to sustain the notes as

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:51.790 
practice trying to sustain the notes as
long<00:02:45.570> as<00:02:45.750> you<00:02:45.870> can<00:02:46.170> so<00:02:46.500> you're<00:02:46.620> going<00:02:46.830> down

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.559 

see<00:02:52.800> here<00:02:52.980> each<00:02:53.160> note<00:02:53.490> as<00:02:53.730> I'm<00:02:53.970> going<00:02:54.150> in<00:02:54.450> a

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:54.569 
see here each note as I'm going in a

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:59.420 
see here each note as I'm going in a
descending<00:02:54.930> pattern<00:02:55.260> so<00:02:55.590> now<00:02:55.739> up<00:02:56.040> and<00:02:56.310> down

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:10.620 

and<00:03:00.430> back<00:03:07.530> ok<00:03:08.530> you<00:03:09.130> can<00:03:09.280> also<00:03:09.490> play<00:03:09.940> these<00:03:10.180> in<00:03:10.570> a

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
and back ok you can also play these in a

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:12.390 
and back ok you can also play these in a
pentatonic<00:03:10.930> pattern<00:03:11.260> in<00:03:11.740> the<00:03:11.920> same<00:03:12.130> way

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
pentatonic pattern in the same way

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:17.900 
pentatonic pattern in the same way
sustaining<00:03:13.300> one<00:03:13.690> note<00:03:14.670> and<00:03:15.670> then<00:03:15.850> moving<00:03:16.120> over

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
sustaining one note and then moving over

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:25.330 
sustaining one note and then moving over
and<00:03:18.000> over<00:03:19.340> so<00:03:20.340> that<00:03:20.370> gives<00:03:20.700> you<00:03:20.790> this<00:03:20.940> effect

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.240 

now<00:03:26.340> the<00:03:26.400> other<00:03:26.670> part<00:03:27.000> of<00:03:27.090> this<00:03:27.209> is<00:03:27.420> vibrato

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
now the other part of this is vibrato

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.740 
now the other part of this is vibrato
when<00:03:29.250> you<00:03:29.340> play<00:03:29.519> vibrato<00:03:30.000> there's<00:03:30.360> of<00:03:30.510> course

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
when you play vibrato there's of course

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.179 
when you play vibrato there's of course
different<00:03:31.019> ways<00:03:31.290> you<00:03:31.470> can<00:03:31.650> do<00:03:31.769> that<00:03:31.920> you<00:03:32.040> can

00:03:32.179 --> 00:03:32.189 
different ways you can do that you can

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:35.569 
different ways you can do that you can
twist<00:03:32.430> the<00:03:32.700> strength<00:03:33.000> this<00:03:34.010> or<00:03:35.010> you<00:03:35.250> can<00:03:35.400> pull

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:35.579 
twist the strength this or you can pull

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:39.199 
twist the strength this or you can pull
on<00:03:35.610> the<00:03:35.790> string<00:03:36.120> you<00:03:36.930> can<00:03:36.989> push<00:03:37.260> on<00:03:37.470> it<00:03:38.209> the

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
on the string you can push on it the

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:41.509 
on the string you can push on it the
main<00:03:39.420> thing<00:03:39.450> is<00:03:40.110> the<00:03:40.709> speed<00:03:41.040> of<00:03:41.069> the<00:03:41.400> vibrato

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
main thing is the speed of the vibrato

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:43.849 
main thing is the speed of the vibrato
if<00:03:41.970> you<00:03:42.060> go<00:03:42.180> really<00:03:42.420> fast

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:43.859 
if you go really fast

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:45.740 
if you go really fast
sounds<00:03:44.579> a<00:03:44.640> little<00:03:44.909> nervous<00:03:45.299> and<00:03:45.510> too

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
sounds a little nervous and too

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.610 
sounds a little nervous and too
intentional<00:03:46.590> if<00:03:46.890> you<00:03:47.069> go<00:03:47.220> slow<00:03:48.260> it<00:03:49.260> doesn't

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
intentional if you go slow it doesn't

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.130 
intentional if you go slow it doesn't
have<00:03:49.739> much<00:03:49.920> effect<00:03:50.450> now<00:03:51.450> what<00:03:51.629> you<00:03:51.750> want<00:03:51.930> to<00:03:52.019> do

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
have much effect now what you want to do

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.339 
have much effect now what you want to do
is<00:03:52.260> come<00:03:52.439> up<00:03:52.470> with<00:03:52.590> a<00:03:52.709> nice<00:03:53.040> medium<00:03:53.670> paced

00:03:54.339 --> 00:03:54.349 
is come up with a nice medium paced

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:57.050 
is come up with a nice medium paced
vibrato<00:03:55.349> that<00:03:56.189> you<00:03:56.340> end<00:03:56.549> a<00:03:56.700> lot<00:03:56.849> of<00:03:56.970> your

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
vibrato that you end a lot of your

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:05.980 
vibrato that you end a lot of your
phrasing<00:03:57.510> with<00:03:57.690> for<00:03:58.109> example

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:05.990 

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:07.700 

that<00:04:06.990> kind<00:04:07.200> of<00:04:07.230> a<00:04:07.320> thing

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:07.710 
that kind of a thing

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:10.010 
that kind of a thing
also<00:04:08.550> vibrato<00:04:09.000> allows<00:04:09.390> you<00:04:09.570> to<00:04:09.690> keep<00:04:09.840> the

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:10.020 
also vibrato allows you to keep the

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:11.990 
also vibrato allows you to keep the
instrument<00:04:10.500> a<00:04:10.620> little<00:04:10.860> more<00:04:11.010> in<00:04:11.160> tune<00:04:11.430> because

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
instrument a little more in tune because

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.360 
instrument a little more in tune because
if<00:04:12.690> the<00:04:13.020> instrument<00:04:13.500> if<00:04:13.710> the<00:04:13.860> notes<00:04:14.070> pretty

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
if the instrument if the notes pretty

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.220 
if the instrument if the notes pretty
much<00:04:14.550> right<00:04:14.790> on<00:04:14.820> the<00:04:15.330> vibrato<00:04:15.600> goes<00:04:15.870> slightly

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:16.230 
much right on the vibrato goes slightly

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:17.780 
much right on the vibrato goes slightly
above<00:04:16.500> and<00:04:16.710> slightly<00:04:16.890> below<00:04:17.160> the<00:04:17.430> actual

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:17.790 
above and slightly below the actual

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:20.930 
above and slightly below the actual
pitch<00:04:18.210> which<00:04:19.160> tricks<00:04:20.160> the<00:04:20.310> ear<00:04:20.460> a<00:04:20.489> little<00:04:20.610> bit

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
pitch which tricks the ear a little bit

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:22.520 
pitch which tricks the ear a little bit
into<00:04:21.270> making<00:04:21.600> it<00:04:21.690> sound<00:04:21.870> a<00:04:22.020> little<00:04:22.050> more<00:04:22.380> in

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.530 
into making it sound a little more in

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:24.410 
into making it sound a little more in
tune<00:04:22.800> you<00:04:23.070> can<00:04:23.220> do<00:04:23.460> this<00:04:23.670> with<00:04:23.820> a<00:04:23.850> chord<00:04:24.240> as

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:24.420 
tune you can do this with a chord as

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:28.390 
tune you can do this with a chord as
well<00:04:24.890> so<00:04:25.890> I<00:04:25.950> do<00:04:26.010> that<00:04:26.310> off<00:04:26.460> and<00:04:26.670> I'll<00:04:26.790> forward

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 
well so I do that off and I'll forward

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:34.719 
well so I do that off and I'll forward
and<00:04:29.400> you<00:04:29.520> can<00:04:29.670> do<00:04:29.760> it<00:04:29.790> in<00:04:29.970> the<00:04:30.060> bass<00:04:30.240> side

00:04:34.719 --> 00:04:34.729 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:37.850 

and<00:04:35.930> I've<00:04:36.930> noticed<00:04:37.260> a<00:04:37.320> lot<00:04:37.350> of<00:04:37.500> times<00:04:37.740> the

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
and I've noticed a lot of times the

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.610 
and I've noticed a lot of times the
Bayside<00:04:38.220> gets<00:04:38.490> ignored<00:04:38.990> okay<00:04:39.990> so<00:04:40.050> look<00:04:40.440> for

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:40.620 
Bayside gets ignored okay so look for

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:41.810 
Bayside gets ignored okay so look for
those<00:04:40.740> elements<00:04:41.190> I'm<00:04:41.490> going<00:04:41.610> to<00:04:41.669> play<00:04:41.790> a

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:41.820
