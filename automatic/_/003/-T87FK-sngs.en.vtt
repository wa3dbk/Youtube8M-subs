00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
you can do fakie big flips it's really

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.520 
you can do fakie big flips it's really
just<00:00:50.969> a<00:00:51.180> variation<00:00:51.449> on<00:00:51.719> a<00:00:51.809> fakie<00:00:52.079> big<00:00:52.260> spin

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
just a variation on a fakie big spin

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.130 
just a variation on a fakie big spin
flip<00:00:52.610> you<00:00:53.610> just<00:00:53.789> do<00:00:53.910> that<00:00:54.090> plus<00:00:54.390> an<00:00:54.600> extra<00:00:54.780> 180

flip you just do that plus an extra 180

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.240 
flip you just do that plus an extra 180
in<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.410> end<00:00:56.000> alright<00:00:57.000> so<00:00:57.320> for<00:00:58.320> me<00:00:58.440> I<00:00:58.469> approach

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
in the end alright so for me I approach

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.500 
in the end alright so for me I approach
the<00:00:59.399> trick<00:00:59.609> usually<00:01:00.000> at<00:01:00.090> about<00:01:00.270> a<00:01:00.300> medium

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
the trick usually at about a medium

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.439 
the trick usually at about a medium
speed<00:01:01.010> but<00:01:02.010> depends<00:01:02.879> depends<00:01:03.180> where<00:01:03.359> you're

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
speed but depends depends where you're

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:04.759 
speed but depends depends where you're
trying<00:01:03.600> it<00:01:03.750> you<00:01:03.870> can<00:01:03.989> go<00:01:04.110> fast<00:01:04.350> you<00:01:04.559> can<00:01:04.650> go

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
trying it you can go fast you can go

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.590 
trying it you can go fast you can go
slow<00:01:05.060> definitely<00:01:06.060> have<00:01:06.150> to<00:01:06.210> be<00:01:06.240> rolling<00:01:06.540> a

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
slow definitely have to be rolling a

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.630 
slow definitely have to be rolling a
little<00:01:06.689> bit<00:01:06.900> in<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.290> switch<00:01:07.619> position<00:01:07.799> or

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
little bit in the switch position or

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.260 
little bit in the switch position or
fakie<00:01:08.970> position<00:01:09.350> for<00:01:10.350> me<00:01:10.790> my<00:01:11.790> feet<00:01:12.060> are

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
fakie position for me my feet are

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.630 
fakie position for me my feet are
positioned<00:01:12.390> like<00:01:12.750> this<00:01:13.010> this<00:01:14.010> foot<00:01:14.250> back<00:01:14.400> here

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
positioned like this this foot back here

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.820 
positioned like this this foot back here

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
and then roll back fakie thank you pop

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.060 
and then roll back fakie thank you pop
and<00:01:32.960> at<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.049> same<00:01:34.200> time<00:01:34.439> your<00:01:34.619> body's<00:01:34.890> just

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
and at the same time your body's just

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.819 
and at the same time your body's just
starting<00:01:35.700> to<00:01:35.790> turn<00:01:36.720> to<00:01:36.930> really<00:01:37.140> twist<00:01:37.380> and

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
starting to turn to really twist and

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.530 
starting to turn to really twist and
that's<00:01:38.430> what<00:01:38.610> makes<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:38.850> board<00:01:39.030> flip<00:01:39.240> all<00:01:39.509> the

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
that's what makes the board flip all the

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:45.560 
that's what makes the board flip all the
way<00:01:41.750> like<00:01:42.750> that<00:01:43.640> after<00:01:44.640> your<00:01:44.759> body<00:01:44.880> spin<00:01:45.360> as

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570
