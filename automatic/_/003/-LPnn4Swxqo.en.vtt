00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:20.540
 start picking up more books from the library 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:23.460
 It was a job for us. 

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:26.370
 Car pick up a book. 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:29.730
 Everybody starts to pick it up every week. 

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:35.190
 now she works at home to pick up a book she reads 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:38.100
 friend to mig and despite the area that did 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:42.110
 love the people remembering the cheetahs wrap 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:46.530
 the name of a cup and a half I will order 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:48.930
 first I took a parked middle and came 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:52.379
 of the 1 cup 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.479
 Then I was kind of hurt, I guess. 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.870
 what edition of chicago 

00:00:54.479 --> 00:01:02.790
 there after the launch of the jumbo aki da 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:08.940
 trash legs in the project learning everything 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:14.100
 about samba as well as old ones 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:21.890
 they should have children who ate what they 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:26.070
 wanted not to go to theatrical techniques 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:28.619
 which had been on stage when as you know and 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.810
 even today I'm using it day by day 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:35.579
 I did not know that the clown is the 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:37.859
 main course is there now 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.990
 day in the Brazilian circuit most of 

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:42.000
 acronym takes the name of the clown 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:45.179
 then in case the part fails is a phase 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.280
 important and I decided to be a clown for 

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:49.280
 influence of manoel and to this day I have 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:55.999
 what to learn 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:55.999
 Aymara Things 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:07.880
 I liked it because it teaches many things. 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:10.880
 for us we can do this in 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:14.900
 home and can learn how we 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:19.100
 grow that making sculpture is much more 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:21.500
 cool is a putting things together is much more 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:25.160
 Cool to invent things to do 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:27.590
 but is much more ice think we 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:30.830
 but with much more things than the people 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:34.330
 imagine what these things I think 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.330
 more magnetic person now 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:41.300
 the drawing until tomorrow and I liked 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.840
 math but now I'm more I do not 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.540
 wise 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.970
 and so we for those most 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.780
 difficulty will learn more about the 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.849
 houses 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.879
 when the lady of ours but who goes 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:56.069
 export knowledge right now and 

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:58.470
 everybody only serves me before I 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:01.590
 I was thinking of natural disasters for me and 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:04.980
 not only those of those more 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:08.010
 powerful plus known type by adding 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:11.040
 earthquakes volcanic eruptions and I 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:13.290
 I learned that not now I know that I 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.720
 a hundred leaders and affect the 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:18.630
 population can be a natural wear and 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:25.370
 I like it to stay there when it takes 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:25.370
 people at the time to say it with us 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:31.990
 when it's filling us up to do the 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:37.660
 things 

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:43.620
 She takes people and I think she's through 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:43.620
 a reserve which leads and create b 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:51.530
 in the vein, it's for us and it's us 

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:55.280
 play this little house 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:59.660
 she said I always spoke more personal 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:05.180
 good care to improve every time 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:08.900
 it is the pride of his to know how to produce 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:12.770
 these things so not the score that the 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:14.959
 text has to be clear a lot of 

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:17.510
 thing that I know you 'll have to 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:21.260
 think about the can that will lead favors him 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:24.980
 will understand where it produced 3 that it had 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:29.900
 before write there then we produced 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:34.190
 are missing something here Trading 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:36.700
 text to see if the year okay is fine 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:36.700
 bad
