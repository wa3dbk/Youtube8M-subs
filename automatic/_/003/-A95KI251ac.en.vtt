00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.299
 once the tests have been passed 

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:15.129
 we have almost got the longed for motorcycle license in the absence of just 

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:17.829
 prove our worth is the network 

00:00:17.829 --> 00:00:19.480
 roads open to traffic 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.480
 logically 

00:00:23.989 --> 00:00:27.359
 a valuable experience 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.359
 the first thing is safety first 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:35.710
 The applicant must also use all types of compulsory helmet 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.420
 protections in hand without pregnancies and think 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.540
 as well as a reflective vest approved to be seen note 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.780
 on the other hand equally mandatory will equip an intercom 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.890
 bidirectional microphone equipped with a microphone for which the examiner 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.890
 will indicate the path to follow 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:03.940
 This test was not previously required for applicants who already had the 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:05.970
 license to a car pool 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.540
 but with the current regulation they apply to all 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.300
 that there is no way to save ourselves 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:21.030
 we have to convince them we do not go out as in the maneuvers test the aspirant 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.140
 will have two opportunities to overcome this test 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:25.900
 although yes 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.240
 it's much longer 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.740
 since there are 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.220
 the climax of 25 thousand people 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.140
 during the course of the journey the applicant must show that he knows 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.390
 handle the vehicle wisely by changing the direction lane 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.150
 respecting pedestrian crossings entering and leaving roundabouts 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:50.649
 cent even circulating on highways with the sme but as we are all human 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:54.730
 and so certain faults for faults 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.340
 They are classified into three types 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:05.140
 the elimination foul will be the one that supposes a danger for the aspirant with 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.500
 more users of this route the deficient one will be with the breach of some 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.570
 norm that hinders the circulation of other users without its little 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:14.739
 dangerousness 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:20.469
 And finally, it is understood as a slight fault, incorrect handling of controls today 

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:26.509
 from the past 

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:30.739
 in the test of circulation will not be declared not pointed the applicant is 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:31.809
 inconvenient 

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:37.649
 an eliminatory foul oviedo two deficient faults one deficient lack and five 

00:02:37.649 --> 00:02:40.529
 slight as if not ten mild 

00:02:40.529 --> 00:02:41.960
 criteria of the examiner 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:45.229
 will be the one who decides the quality of each fan 

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:48.479
 passed this exam you can already say that of 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:49.860
 the city of seville
