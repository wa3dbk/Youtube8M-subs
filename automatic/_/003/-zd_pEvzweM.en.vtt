he said it always always a good fight so
it's<00:01:21.720> now<00:01:22.170> criticism<00:01:22.799> but<00:01:22.890> he<00:01:22.979> has<00:01:23.100> I'd<00:01:23.250> it<00:01:23.369> all

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
it's now criticism but he has I'd it all

his own way so there's the situations

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.440

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:35.660 
now stand to me in the fight because you
know<00:01:34.740> it's<00:01:34.860> going<00:01:34.950> to<00:01:35.009> be<00:01:35.130> a<00:01:35.159> hell<00:01:35.280> of<00:01:35.340> a<00:01:35.460> fight

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
know it's going to be a hell of a fight

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.630 
know it's going to be a hell of a fight
but<00:01:35.939> it's<00:01:36.600> going<00:01:36.810> to<00:01:36.869> be<00:01:37.340> probably<00:01:38.340> going<00:01:38.549> to

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
but it's going to be probably going to

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.219 
but it's going to be probably going to
turn<00:01:38.790> into<00:01:38.939> a<00:01:39.030> bit<00:01:39.180> of<00:01:39.210> a<00:01:39.329> war<00:01:39.540> in<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:39.780> end<00:01:39.930> and

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
turn into a bit of a war in the end and

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.380

then you know I think that I'm going to
be<00:01:42.540> very<00:01:43.079> suited<00:01:43.439> to<00:01:43.560> that<00:01:43.710> for<00:01:44.369> someone<00:01:44.549> who

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
be very suited to that for someone who

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.190 
be very suited to that for someone who
doesn't<00:01:44.759> know<00:01:45.149> how<00:01:45.329> did<00:01:45.479> that<00:01:45.600> last<00:01:45.810> meeting

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
was a welterweight

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.260 
was a welterweight
you<00:02:12.680> know<00:02:12.800> I<00:02:12.830> seen<00:02:13.130> him<00:02:13.280> you<00:02:13.460> know<00:02:13.550> the

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270 
you know I seen him you know the

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:16.030 
you know I seen him you know the
tournament<00:02:14.780> you<00:02:15.110> see<00:02:15.260> lots<00:02:15.500> of<00:02:15.590> fights<00:02:15.770> fight

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
tournament you see lots of fights fight

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.350 
tournament you see lots of fights fight
and<00:02:16.190> then<00:02:16.250> he<00:02:16.310> was<00:02:16.580> one<00:02:16.730> that<00:02:16.850> caught<00:02:17.060> my<00:02:17.210> own

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
and then he was one that caught my own

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.360 
and then he was one that caught my own
so<00:02:17.900> I<00:02:17.930> thought<00:02:18.170> he's<00:02:18.710> going<00:02:18.860> to<00:02:18.920> keep<00:02:19.010> winning

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
so I thought he's going to keep winning

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:20.890 
so I thought he's going to keep winning
and<00:02:19.490> you<00:02:19.850> know<00:02:19.940> i<00:02:19.970> believe<00:02:20.450> that<00:02:20.600> i<00:02:20.630> was<00:02:20.780> going

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
and you know i believe that i was going

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.360 
and you know i believe that i was going
to<00:02:20.960> keep<00:02:21.110> winning<00:02:21.380> so<00:02:21.770> i<00:02:21.800> think<00:02:21.890> one<00:02:22.100> day<00:02:22.130> our

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
to keep winning so i think one day our

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:23.860 
to keep winning so i think one day our
paths<00:02:22.580> will<00:02:22.700> cross<00:02:22.760> and<00:02:23.240> you<00:02:23.570> know<00:02:23.660> i<00:02:23.690> thought

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
paths will cross and you know i thought

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.630 
paths will cross and you know i thought
it<00:02:23.990> would<00:02:24.110> be<00:02:24.230> in<00:02:24.290> as<00:02:24.380> amateurs<00:02:24.800> but<00:02:24.980> you<00:02:25.520> know

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
it would be in as amateurs but you know

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.150 
it would be in as amateurs but you know
it's<00:02:25.850> it's<00:02:26.480> what<00:02:26.720> 13<00:02:27.140> years<00:02:27.170> later<00:02:27.440> so<00:02:27.920> but

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
it's it's what 13 years later so but

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.620 
it's it's what 13 years later so but
that's<00:02:28.280> the<00:02:28.400> way<00:02:28.490> it<00:02:28.520> goes<00:02:28.580> that's<00:02:28.910> boxing<00:02:29.330> and

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
that's the way it goes that's boxing and

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:34.120 
that's the way it goes that's boxing and
here<00:02:30.080> you<00:02:30.170> are<00:02:30.290> now<00:02:31.150> he<00:02:32.150> was<00:02:33.080> I<00:02:33.440> don't<00:02:33.800> he
