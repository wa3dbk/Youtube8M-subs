with<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:22.770> trial<00:01:23.040> pack<00:01:23.250> so<00:01:23.430> this<00:01:23.580> means<00:01:23.790> if<00:01:23.939> you

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
with the trial pack so this means if you

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.340 
with the trial pack so this means if you
wanted<00:01:24.180> to<00:01:24.270> start<00:01:24.479> up<00:01:24.570> a<00:01:24.630> brand<00:01:24.840> new<00:01:24.930> world<00:01:25.110> and

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
use a trial texture pack you wouldn't be

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.660 
use a trial texture pack you wouldn't be

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
able to save any of your progress so

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.789 
able to save any of your progress so
that's<00:01:30.150> a<00:01:30.270> little<00:01:30.420> bit<00:01:30.600> of<00:01:30.689> a<00:01:30.780> downer<00:01:31.049> but<00:01:31.650> on

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
that's a little bit of a downer but on

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.830 
that's a little bit of a downer but on
the<00:01:31.979> plus<00:01:32.340> side<00:01:32.640> of<00:01:32.670> that<00:01:32.939> you<00:01:33.240> could<00:01:33.689> actually

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
the plus side of that you could actually

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.569 
the plus side of that you could actually
use<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.290> trial<00:01:34.560> pack<00:01:34.770> as<00:01:35.009> long<00:01:35.130> as<00:01:35.250> you<00:01:35.369> didn't

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579

hunger games map where you don't save
your<00:01:49.049> progress<00:01:49.380> you<00:01:50.100> could<00:01:50.280> use<00:01:50.430> the<00:01:50.579> trial

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
your progress you could use the trial

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.280 
your progress you could use the trial
version<00:01:51.270> and<00:01:51.420> you<00:01:51.810> would<00:01:51.899> never<00:01:52.020> actually

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
version and you would never actually

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.499 
version and you would never actually
have<00:01:52.560> to<00:01:52.680> buy<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:52.920> full<00:01:53.340> texture<00:01:53.820> pack<00:01:54.000> which

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
have to buy the full texture pack which

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.149 
have to buy the full texture pack which
is<00:01:54.659> kind<00:01:54.869> of<00:01:54.930> a<00:01:55.049> plus<00:01:55.350> side<00:01:55.560> to<00:01:55.590> this<00:01:55.829> texture

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
is kind of a plus side to this texture

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.100 
is kind of a plus side to this texture
pack<00:01:56.189> stuff<00:01:56.579> so<00:01:56.850> there<00:01:57.299> will<00:01:57.360> be<00:01:57.420> there<00:01:58.079> will

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
pack stuff so there will be there will

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.109 
pack stuff so there will be there will
be<00:01:58.320> workarounds<00:01:59.189> to<00:01:59.219> not<00:01:59.460> having<00:01:59.670> to<00:01:59.790> buy<00:02:00.060> the

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
be workarounds to not having to buy the

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.389 
be workarounds to not having to buy the
whole<00:02:00.329> texture<00:02:00.600> pack<00:02:00.869> so<00:02:01.350> you<00:02:01.409> guys<00:02:01.770> can<00:02:02.009> rest

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
whole texture pack so you guys can rest

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.120 
whole texture pack so you guys can rest
easy<00:02:02.610> about<00:02:02.759> that<00:02:02.880> also<00:02:03.509> this<00:02:04.020> guy<00:02:04.259> um<00:02:04.560> where

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
did this tweet really wrong I read it so

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.119 
did this tweet really wrong I read it so
many<00:02:06.930> times<00:02:07.020> but<00:02:07.439> he<00:02:07.530> basically<00:02:07.740> wanted<00:02:08.039> to

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
many times but he basically wanted to

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.279 
many times but he basically wanted to
know<00:02:08.220> is<00:02:08.520> if<00:02:09.179> your<00:02:09.539> friend<00:02:09.810> is<00:02:09.959> using<00:02:10.229> a

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
know is if your friend is using a

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:11.809 
know is if your friend is using a
texture<00:02:10.590> pack<00:02:10.739> on<00:02:10.950> his<00:02:11.099> own<00:02:11.280> world<00:02:11.520> and<00:02:11.760> you

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
texture pack on his own world and you

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:12.790 
texture pack on his own world and you
join<00:02:12.090> him

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
join him

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.380 
join him
do<00:02:12.920> you<00:02:13.010> need<00:02:13.190> to<00:02:13.370> have<00:02:13.550> to<00:02:13.730> have<00:02:14.000> to<00:02:14.150> buy<00:02:14.360> that

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
do you need to have to have to buy that

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.600 
do you need to have to have to buy that
texturepack<00:02:15.170> and<00:02:15.410> the<00:02:15.770> answer<00:02:15.980> is<00:02:16.070> no<00:02:16.250> all<00:02:16.490> you

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
texturepack and the answer is no all you

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.340 
texturepack and the answer is no all you
need<00:02:16.760> is<00:02:16.880> a<00:02:16.910> trial<00:02:17.300> so<00:02:17.540> you'll<00:02:17.720> join<00:02:17.960> his<00:02:18.110> world

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350 
need is a trial so you'll join his world

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:20.500 
need is a trial so you'll join his world
to<00:02:18.440> probably<00:02:18.710> pop<00:02:18.920> prompt<00:02:19.490> you<00:02:19.640> to<00:02:19.670> download

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
the trial and you can plan his world on

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.060 
the trial and you can plan his world on
his<00:02:22.940> world<00:02:23.180> save<00:02:23.480> with<00:02:24.170> the<00:02:24.560> trial<00:02:24.980> version

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.070 
his world save with the trial version

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:27.730 
his world save with the trial version
and<00:02:25.610> see<00:02:25.850> the<00:02:26.330> whole<00:02:26.540> texture<00:02:26.870> pack<00:02:27.140> again<00:02:27.560> if

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:27.740 
and see the whole texture pack again if

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:29.860 
and see the whole texture pack again if
you're<00:02:28.130> not<00:02:28.310> the<00:02:28.460> one<00:02:28.610> saving<00:02:28.940> you're<00:02:29.540> not<00:02:29.690> the

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
you're not the one saving you're not the

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.360 
you're not the one saving you're not the
one<00:02:30.020> that<00:02:30.140> needs<00:02:30.200> to<00:02:30.410> have<00:02:30.560> to<00:02:30.740> pay<00:02:30.980> to<00:02:31.040> buy<00:02:31.340> the
