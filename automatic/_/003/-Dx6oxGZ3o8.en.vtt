gammy there is involvement of two flash

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.130 
gammy there is involvement of two flash
for<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.590> pollination<00:01:11.240> but<00:01:12.240> these<00:01:12.420> two<00:01:12.720> sloths

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
for the pollination but these two sloths

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.249 
for the pollination but these two sloths
they<00:01:13.470> are<00:01:13.560> present<00:01:14.010> on<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.430> same<00:01:14.760> plant<00:01:15.299> in

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
they are present on the same plant in

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.380 
they are present on the same plant in
the<00:01:16.530> jitna<00:01:16.860> gammy<00:01:17.159> there<00:01:17.520> is<00:01:17.640> transfer<00:01:18.360> of

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
the jitna gammy there is transfer of

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.550 
the jitna gammy there is transfer of
pollen<00:01:19.020> green<00:01:19.520> from<00:01:20.520> anther<00:01:21.509> to<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.140> stigma

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
pollen green from anther to the stigma

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.550 
pollen green from anther to the stigma
of<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.610> different<00:01:24.390> class<00:01:24.720> which<00:01:25.170> belong<00:01:25.500> to

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
of the different class which belong to

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.060 
of the different class which belong to
the<00:01:25.920> same<00:01:25.950> plant<00:01:27.140> so<00:01:28.140> you<00:01:28.170> know<00:01:28.470> that<00:01:28.740> for<00:01:28.979> the

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
the same plant so you know that for the

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.120 
the same plant so you know that for the
transfer<00:01:29.670> of<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:29.939> pollen<00:01:30.329> grain<00:01:30.630> there<00:01:31.500> would

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
transfer of the pollen grain there would

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.780 
transfer of the pollen grain there would
be<00:01:32.240> requirement<00:01:33.240> of<00:01:33.479> pollinators<00:01:34.790> ecological

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
be requirement of pollinators ecological

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.960 
be requirement of pollinators ecological
agencies<00:01:36.479> but<00:01:37.350> both<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:38.009> flaws<00:01:38.310> they<00:01:38.700> belong

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
agencies but both the flaws they belong

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.910 
agencies but both the flaws they belong
to<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.390> same<00:01:39.659> plant<00:01:40.110> so<00:01:40.650> they<00:01:40.799> are

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
to the same plant so they are

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.630 
to the same plant so they are
genetically<00:01:41.520> similar<00:01:42.590> so<00:01:43.590> pollinators<00:01:44.340> they

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
genetically similar so pollinators they

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.810 
genetically similar so pollinators they
are<00:01:44.729> required<00:01:45.180> but<00:01:46.079> genetically<00:01:46.770> it<00:01:47.100> is<00:01:47.340> self

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
are required but genetically it is self

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.840 
are required but genetically it is self
pollination<00:01:48.450> so<00:01:49.350> we<00:01:49.649> will<00:01:49.770> say<00:01:50.009> this<00:01:50.340> is<00:01:50.549> right

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
pollination so we will say this is right

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.550 
pollination so we will say this is right
option<00:01:51.659> here<00:01:52.280> now<00:01:53.280> coming<00:01:53.490> to<00:01:53.759> Xena<00:01:54.240> gammy<00:01:54.560> now

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
option here now coming to Xena gammy now

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.230 
option here now coming to Xena gammy now
in<00:01:55.920> zero<00:01:56.399> Yami<00:01:58.100> again<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.399> pollination<00:01:59.850> is

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
in zero Yami again the pollination is

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.990 
in zero Yami again the pollination is
between<00:02:00.659> two<00:02:01.140> different<00:02:01.469> flowers<00:02:02.130> but<00:02:02.640> now

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
between two different flowers but now

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.100 
between two different flowers but now
they<00:02:03.299> belong<00:02:03.570> to<00:02:03.960> two<00:02:03.990> different<00:02:04.170> plants<00:02:06.110> so

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
they belong to two different plants so

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.080 
they belong to two different plants so
surely<00:02:07.799> there<00:02:08.099> is<00:02:08.190> requirement<00:02:08.459> of

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
surely there is requirement of

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.930 
surely there is requirement of
pollinators<00:02:10.340> along<00:02:11.340> with<00:02:11.640> that<00:02:11.879> the<00:02:12.150> two<00:02:12.360> flaw

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
pollinators along with that the two flaw

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.000 
pollinators along with that the two flaw
they<00:02:13.030> belong<00:02:13.300> to<00:02:13.360> different<00:02:13.690> plants<00:02:14.680> so<00:02:14.800> now

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
they belong to different plants so now

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.940 
they belong to different plants so now
they<00:02:15.280> are<00:02:15.310> not<00:02:15.640> genetically<00:02:16.420> same<00:02:16.990> so<00:02:17.830> it's

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
they are not genetically same so it's

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
they are not genetically same so it's
genetically<00:02:19.020> cross-pollination<00:02:20.670> now<00:02:21.670> a

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
genetically cross-pollination now a

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.320 
genetically cross-pollination now a
Pagani<00:02:22.770> what<00:02:23.770> do<00:02:23.830> you<00:02:23.890> mean<00:02:24.010> by<00:02:24.190> Apple<00:02:24.790> Apple

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
Pagani what do you mean by Apple Apple

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.520 
Pagani what do you mean by Apple Apple
means<00:02:25.540> without<00:02:26.490> gammy<00:02:27.490> is<00:02:27.910> a<00:02:28.530> fertilization

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
means without gammy is a fertilization

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.750 
means without gammy is a fertilization
fusion<00:02:30.430> so<00:02:31.390> a<00:02:31.600> Pagani<00:02:32.110> is<00:02:32.550> formation<00:02:33.550> of

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
fusion so a Pagani is formation of

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.620 
fusion so a Pagani is formation of
embryo<00:02:34.750> without<00:02:35.440> fusion<00:02:36.160> so<00:02:36.970> again<00:02:37.240> this<00:02:37.480> is

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
embryo without fusion so again this is

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.840 
embryo without fusion so again this is
not<00:02:37.660> the<00:02:37.960> right<00:02:38.110> option<00:02:38.650> here<00:02:38.890> so<00:02:39.100> for

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
not the right option here so for

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:43.200 
not the right option here so for
question<00:02:40.360> number<00:02:40.410> 21<00:02:41.410> the<00:02:42.250> right<00:02:42.430> option<00:02:43.060> is
