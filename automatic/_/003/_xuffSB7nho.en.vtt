00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:02.166
- THERE HAS BEEN
SOME CONTROVERSY AT FACEBOOK.

00:00:02.166 --> 00:00:03.500
HAVE YOU HEARD ABOUT THIS?

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.966
THEY HAD A POLICY THAT
IF YOU WANTED A FACEBOOK PAGE,

00:00:05.966 --> 00:00:07.866
YOU HAD TO USE
YOUR REAL NAME,

00:00:07.866 --> 00:00:09.066
AND--THIS IS TRUE.

00:00:09.066 --> 00:00:10.500
AND PEOPLE WERE UPSET
ABOUT THIS.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:11.866
AND THIS IS TRUE ALSO.

00:00:11.866 --> 00:00:13.800
THE PEOPLE WHO WERE
THE MOST UPSET

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.633
WERE DRAG QUEENS.

00:00:15.633 --> 00:00:17.700
AND I'M HAPPY TO SAY
THAT LAST WEEK,

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.333
FACEBOOK CHANGED THEIR RULES,

00:00:19.333 --> 00:00:21.066
AND THEY SAID
THAT THEY WANTED TO APOLOGIZE

00:00:21.066 --> 00:00:22.600
TO THE DRAG QUEEN COMMUNITY.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.200
WE INVITED MARK ZUCKERBERG
TO BE ON THE SHOW TODAY,

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.333
BUT HE COULDN'T MAKE IT,
SO...

00:00:28.333 --> 00:00:30.400
WE DID HAVE SOMEONE.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.366
THEY LET US TALK
TO THEIR VICE PRESIDENT,

00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:35.000
AND HE'S JOINING US NOW
VIA SATELLITE.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.033
PLEASE WELCOME JOSH BLACKENSHIP.

00:00:38.033 --> 00:00:39.033
JOSH?

00:00:39.033 --> 00:00:40.033
[props rattling]

00:00:40.033 --> 00:00:41.866

00:00:41.866 --> 00:00:43.166

00:00:43.166 --> 00:00:45.266

00:00:49.433 --> 00:00:50.433

00:00:50.433 --> 00:00:51.566
- LOOK AT ELLEN.
- OKAY, HI.

00:00:51.566 --> 00:00:53.133
- NO, YOU CAN LOOK
STRAIGHT AHEAD OF YOU.

00:00:53.133 --> 00:00:54.733
YOU'RE ON THE SATELLITE.
I CAN'T SEE YOU.

00:00:54.733 --> 00:00:57.733
[laughter]

00:00:58.933 --> 00:01:00.466
- OKAY.

00:01:00.466 --> 00:01:01.766

00:01:02.766 --> 00:01:04.966

00:01:08.533 --> 00:01:10.566

00:01:17.233 --> 00:01:20.233

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.633
- I THINK YOU SHOULD
ZIP UP YOUR SWEATSHIRT

00:01:32.633 --> 00:01:34.766
SO YOU LOOK LIKE
YOU'RE THE VICE PRESIDENT.

00:01:36.766 --> 00:01:39.766
[laughter]

00:02:09.066 --> 00:02:10.333
AND WILMA FINGERDOO.

00:02:10.333 --> 00:02:12.233
