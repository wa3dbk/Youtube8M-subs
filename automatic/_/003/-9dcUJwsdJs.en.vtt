00:00:01.599 --> 00:00:44.999
 When I write it is tabula rasa This is Trash friend, and I send them on like the 

00:00:44.999 --> 00:00:47.609
 NASA These Gangsta Raps make Caba-Raps locked in 

00:00:47.609 --> 00:00:49.979
 home, while I pass the first step among the rappers 

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:50.979
 of Italy. 

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:55.280
 Ahhh..Qua seems GTA, Everyone already has 3 stars just because he was born 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:56.899
 here, Sfreccio in CityCar, 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:59.249
 in the city with my brah, screaming to god that we're here, 

00:00:59.249 --> 00:01:00.300
 hoping he will save us 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.560
 Hi..Hi..Non talk that whoever is silent wins, zero prada, only nike and Vintage lenses, 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.100
 among those infamous those who smile and the first who pretends 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.119
 and after this it remains mute like the sphinx. 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:15.790
 I'm the director of a scene like David Fincher, you make the big ones but you powder in my greender, 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.340
 turning from pitbull to pincer, with my gang ... the one that wins 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.259
 I'm still here, alongside my brah .. Nothing will stop us 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.270
 I'm still here, alongside my brah .. Nothing will stop us 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.710
 Party from here down, ready to get on, I continue my way, 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:40.929
 alongside my brah, nothing will stop me ... Nothing will change me. 

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:46.009
 Look at us now that we have grown, the face remains the same but the contents change, 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:50.020
 we have gone from strangers to more followers, making sacrifices in reaching ours 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.020
 goals. 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.770
 Come on ... we are goals, you don't exist like the contraceptives for pornodivi, 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.649
 just like Rocky does not exist without Mickie and Trash does not exist without his friends. 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:05.090
 Under ste clouds of black smoke, I write 16 of them most sacred of the gospel, 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.310
 but if I look back, I have a negro on my heels, 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.640
 but it's just biggie that baptizes me as a real rapper. 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.060
 And now you know who they are and you know who they are, we are the ones at the last counter with the face 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.280
 tired and the rosette of gold and it is with them that the flight will stand out, 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.640
 and will ascend the throne, leaving the subsoil. 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.250
 I'm still here, alongside my brah .. Nothing will stop us 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:30.280
 I'm still here, alongside my brah .. Nothing will stop us 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.720
 Party from here down, ready to get on, I continue my way, 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:40.460
 alongside my brah, nothing will stop me ... Nothing will change me.
