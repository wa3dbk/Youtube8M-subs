00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:08.670
 so my you should be phantom there 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.500
 compass that was a bit disturbed 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.500
 I watched a movie from DJ 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.400
 innovations were resetting the 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.279
 campus 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.900
 oh the chair phantom ben calibration 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.570
 a lot of 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.970
 I looked at that, yes, then I myself 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.369
 the driver installed 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:30.179
 to the nasa thing i have a new one 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:33.090
 training and there you see the murder that 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.440
 stood at 6,000 was first at 8,000 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.420
 So you had to bring it back and then 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.739
 come calibrate again and go to the 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.770
 crack 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.570
 feature that was seventeen hundred something like that 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.280
 so I have to calibrate it 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.950
 of the close look how much the 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:51.480
 values ​​are now connected and the 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:54.500
 values ​​that sit to the finish it 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.500
 rather something like that 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:02.050
 and the 1617 100 after that is ideal 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.950
 so i go out so nice to go 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:07.840

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:14.200

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.369

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.320
