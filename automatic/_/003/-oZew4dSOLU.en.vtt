talked with the engineers see just

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.389 
talked with the engineers see just
exactly<00:01:16.659> what<00:01:17.200> their<00:01:17.409> problem<00:01:17.829> was<00:01:17.860> how<00:01:18.340> we

00:01:18.389 --> 00:01:18.399 
exactly what their problem was how we

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:20.700 
exactly what their problem was how we
could<00:01:18.640> help<00:01:18.670> support<00:01:19.149> the<00:01:19.360> project<00:01:19.750> I<00:01:20.320> went

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:20.710 
could help support the project I went

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:22.950 
could help support the project I went
and<00:01:20.920> saw<00:01:20.979> what<00:01:21.939> they<00:01:22.060> needed<00:01:22.299> they<00:01:22.570> explained

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:22.960 
and saw what they needed they explained

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.380 
and saw what they needed they explained
what<00:01:23.170> they<00:01:23.290> needed<00:01:23.530> in<00:01:23.829> detail<00:01:24.340> and<00:01:24.579> I<00:01:25.180> had<00:01:25.360> a

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:25.390 
what they needed in detail and I had a

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.330 
what they needed in detail and I had a
pretty<00:01:25.930> good<00:01:26.049> understanding<00:01:26.170> of<00:01:26.770> a<00:01:27.009> way<00:01:27.280> to

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
pretty good understanding of a way to

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.609 
pretty good understanding of a way to
solve<00:01:27.579> their<00:01:27.820> problem<00:01:28.210> and<00:01:28.420> I<00:01:29.049> came<00:01:29.259> up<00:01:29.290> with<00:01:29.590> a

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:29.619 
solve their problem and I came up with a

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:32.520 
solve their problem and I came up with a
concept<00:01:29.710> of<00:01:30.430> a<00:01:30.700> tool<00:01:30.939> that<00:01:31.210> could<00:01:32.110> interface

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 
concept of a tool that could interface

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.399 
concept of a tool that could interface
with<00:01:32.799> their<00:01:33.549> their<00:01:34.390> part<00:01:34.659> on<00:01:34.840> the<00:01:34.960> aircraft

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:35.409 
with their their part on the aircraft

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:37.980 
with their their part on the aircraft
and<00:01:35.590> a<00:01:35.680> universal<00:01:36.490> Jack<00:01:36.880> they<00:01:37.479> used<00:01:37.719> in<00:01:37.899> the

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
and a universal Jack they used in the

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.279 
and a universal Jack they used in the
hangar<00:01:38.320> if<00:01:38.890> it's<00:01:39.070> taking<00:01:39.460> days<00:01:39.700> to<00:01:40.570> run

00:01:41.279 --> 00:01:41.289 
hangar if it's taking days to run

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:43.469 
hangar if it's taking days to run
through<00:01:41.469> a<00:01:41.530> process<00:01:41.979> with<00:01:42.159> jsf<00:01:42.670> and<00:01:43.000> we<00:01:43.329> could

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:43.479 
through a process with jsf and we could

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:45.660 
through a process with jsf and we could
come<00:01:43.630> up<00:01:43.750> with<00:01:43.869> a<00:01:43.930> method<00:01:44.380> to<00:01:44.710> save<00:01:44.740> time<00:01:45.310> and

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
come up with a method to save time and

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.420 
come up with a method to save time and
money<00:01:45.719> then<00:01:46.719> we're<00:01:47.049> all<00:01:47.170> for<00:01:47.439> that<00:01:47.469> we<00:01:48.130> proved

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:48.430 
money then we're all for that we proved

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:51.330 
money then we're all for that we proved
it<00:01:48.520> already<00:01:48.850> on<00:01:49.149> VF<00:01:49.930> one<00:01:50.170> they<00:01:50.770> change<00:01:51.070> out

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340 
it already on VF one they change out

it already on VF one they change out
from<00:01:52.030> my<00:01:52.149> understanding<00:01:52.350> took<00:01:53.350> approximately

00:01:55.529 --> 00:01:55.539 
three hours to d install the actuator

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 
and to reinstall the new actuator if

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.990 
and to reinstall the new actuator if
they<00:01:58.450> predict<00:01:58.840> free<00:01:59.740> actuator<00:02:00.159> changes<00:02:00.700> it's

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000
