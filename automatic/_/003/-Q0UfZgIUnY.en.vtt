 let's prepare now I don't remember if 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.150
 these are I write the sprints anyway 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.510
 from how they write in height to 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:24.990
 oven are already already pinned then 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:27.930
 fillets made on a bed of vegetables 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.970
 what is a simone recipe 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.120
 in short, of the family of simone during the years 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.800
 I hope he will do it as usual 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.500
 can return to profit in short for 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.820
 prepare something for sure 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.210
 and let's see what we need 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:45.719
 how yes no we clearly need the 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:48.300
 little fish these were two chosen 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:51.239
 which have been gently filed 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:55.260
 from the cylinder since he liked driving 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:57.359
 clean did then you can also take i 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.100
 even whole fish with a head 

00:00:57.359 --> 00:01:01.079
 when very well what I tried to 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.120
 do it even with frozen customers 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.880
 and it's ok anyway 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:10.170
 then the vegetables we need are the 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:13.830
 karate tomatoes a bit of leek and le 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:17.130
 potatoes then to flavor komaromi and 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:19.830
 we use the marjoram pepper the 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:23.610
 thyme , thyme, lemon and fish 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.810
 really great and then the rosemary e 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.400
 then we need it 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.610
 the oil and the 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.050
 the coarse salt I first of all already 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.910
 lit the oven so that 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.830
 while preparing bed of vegetables e mi 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:38.310
 never in temperature because we do it first 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:40.830
 some vegetables and then the small fish mi 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.630
 I am taking this theme which is in the 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:44.310
 ours these fabulous because it is 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.930
 very little oil is enough that 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:51.470
 we have discovered that they are fabulous 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:51.470
 then the first house and oil trick here 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:00.090
 and I begin to cut the vegetables 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.770
 then let's start with the potatoes and 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:06.979
 I try to make potatoes at least there 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.979
 I try all the same in the same thickness 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:19.280
 in the dispongo on the bottom park a little 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:19.280
 the oil here we do this first straten 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.790
 now let's put some hair 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.480
 with a little salt 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.510
 let's put some horrors 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:48.300
 possibly if you smell it 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:48.300
 fresh are well ideal 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.880
 now let's do the second layer of 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:56.350
 vegetables then cut it all now if 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.270
 on the subject also for these vegetables 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:10.540
 here and we try to cut them more or less 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:12.130
 more for with the same thickness for i 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.590
 tomatoes would be better to have i 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:16.750
 cherry tomatoes this morning I went to 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:19.660
 to buy very well, he bought me 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:23.310
 the tomatoes and instead I was so I do 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.310
 with these tomatoes with reds 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:29.220
 let's do the other layers 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:46.490
 let's put ciboldi carrots 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:50.760
 when more or less we have finished 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:55.370
 with the waste we make them we put them 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.370
 marine odors 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:05.150
 he wants me 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:08.170
 is 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:11.159
 the salt 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:21.889
 we end up with tomatoes with the latter 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.889
 pairs 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:25.680
 always as before 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:30.430
 henry 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:35.840
 here it is the crib and products 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.180
 I had in June and another a little 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:40.520
 porn because we think it was little e 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:43.070
 now we put it in the oven 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:46.639
 let the vegetables cook at 220 degrees 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:51.680
 for 20 minutes then we take it out and there 

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:55.840
 let's put it on instead now I put i 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:55.840
 customers on the vegetable bed 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:09.830
 then as before we move on to flavoring them if 

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:12.770
 you have the whole fish and of course 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:15.770
 nice okay that thinks poniate too 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:17.569
 even inside so I 'm out with the 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:20.900
 smell or go put one for the 

00:05:17.569 --> 00:05:22.900
 lemon slice where there were 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:26.419
 interior that takes away some of the flavor 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:29.360
 bitter is clearly the one that changes 

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:31.789
 it is the degree of cooking because these 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:34.280
 I think ten minutes of maximum 

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:37.520
 maximum a quarter of an hour I am faced with 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:41.379
 the whole fish time increases by 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:43.310
 you can also usually adjust with with 

00:05:41.379 --> 00:05:48.909
 when the eye turns white 

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:48.909
 obviously as before and it is 

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:55.200
 emilio 

00:05:57.569 --> 00:06:02.490
 so now we put it in 

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:05.399
 oven for another 10 minutes I told you 

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:07.139
 maximum maximum then then these here 

00:06:05.399 --> 00:06:09.539
 they are the edges in the ends that end 

00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:11.189
 we found that the sea bass anyway 

00:06:09.539 --> 00:06:15.419
 if the prepared sea ​​bass is fine 

00:06:11.189 --> 00:06:17.399
 and now we publish on the plate got them 

00:06:15.419 --> 00:06:20.399
 we eat this usually always do 

00:06:17.399 --> 00:06:21.929
 so much scene because it seems that who knows 

00:06:20.399 --> 00:06:23.729
 as prepared instead you have seen 

00:06:21.929 --> 00:06:26.399
 rather it was rather 

00:06:23.729 --> 00:06:27.659
 simple and then clearly there is also the 

00:06:26.399 --> 00:06:31.469
 value that you start the vegetables 

00:06:27.659 --> 00:06:33.509
 simultaneously with al tc in the sand 

00:06:31.469 --> 00:06:37.069
 momentaccio a kiss 

00:06:33.509 --> 00:06:37.069
 hello and see you soon
