00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.649 

now<00:01:20.220> let's<00:01:20.430> add<00:01:20.580> in<00:01:20.790> our<00:01:20.880> sugars

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.480 

and<00:01:25.170> it's<00:01:25.289> always<00:01:25.560> a<00:01:25.590> good<00:01:25.799> idea<00:01:25.859> when<00:01:26.369> you're

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
and it's always a good idea when you're

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.309 
and it's always a good idea when you're
introducing<00:01:26.729> some<00:01:27.299> sort<00:01:27.569> of<00:01:27.630> sugar<00:01:27.960> or<00:01:28.229> a

00:01:28.309 --> 00:01:28.319 
introducing some sort of sugar or a

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:32.209 
introducing some sort of sugar or a
powder<00:01:28.909> to<00:01:29.990> you<00:01:30.990> know<00:01:31.109> a<00:01:31.140> liquid<00:01:31.619> or<00:01:31.649> a<00:01:31.950> fat

00:01:32.209 --> 00:01:32.219 
powder to you know a liquid or a fat

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:34.340 
powder to you know a liquid or a fat
like<00:01:32.429> this<00:01:32.729> that<00:01:33.179> you<00:01:33.270> introduce<00:01:33.689> it<00:01:33.869> slowly

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
like this that you introduce it slowly

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.169 
like this that you introduce it slowly
so<00:01:34.710> it<00:01:34.770> has<00:01:34.979> time<00:01:35.219> to<00:01:35.399> absorb<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:35.880> it<00:01:35.939> doesn't

00:01:36.169 --> 00:01:36.179 
so it has time to absorb and it doesn't

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:41.300 
so it has time to absorb and it doesn't
get<00:01:36.240> overwhelmed<00:01:38.749> and<00:01:39.749> the<00:01:40.619> granulated<00:01:41.280> sugar

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
get overwhelmed and the granulated sugar

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:51.820 
get overwhelmed and the granulated sugar
now

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:51.830 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:02:00.290

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
that it's not mixing well just do it

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.589
