00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:00.439 
to start reproducing when I do that what

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:02.620 
to start reproducing when I do that what
happens<00:02:00.470> is<00:02:01.069> you<00:02:01.310> start<00:02:01.340> producing<00:02:02.030> more<00:02:02.390> baby

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
happens is you start producing more baby
