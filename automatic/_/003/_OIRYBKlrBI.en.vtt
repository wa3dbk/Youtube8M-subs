00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:03.320
 and I endesa and talking about the aid 

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:08.210
 single-parent eliases although the pear of the single-parent family mind is that 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:11.499
 which is formed by a single member and the children that can be 

00:00:11.499 --> 00:00:15.509
 if that goes from 2 70 as long as it is compatible as expected family 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:16.150
 numerous 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:21.369
 there are deductions in the irpf there is an aid per child in charge of 50 euros per month and 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:24.740
 then after point to the daycare center that in some cases you can 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.169
 apply also to the person who are divorced 

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:30.800
 I will basically do the single-parent family also of the models of 

00:00:30.799 --> 00:00:31.470
 family 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.170
 It is very clear that they are changing completely, it has gone from 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:38.610
 family structure where the father was the mother and the children 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.870
 there to see a diversity where the single-parent family is in today's theme 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.200
 the homoparental family to a person of the same sex 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.650
 family rebuilt after separations from cÃ©tera 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:54.250
 so what we have to do ep see all this family diversity as something 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:55.280
 normal 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:56.829
 as a situation 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:00.020
 which is derived from the reality of the society of evolution 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.550
 expo and in day if you download a class from a school 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:05.489
 loves her more than half 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.480
 of the children that in that class 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.010
 his parents are separated 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.560
 with which it is something that before could be granted another reason and there we have to 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.180
 see it as a normal situation what happens that does not exempt from difficulties like 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.700
 now for that reason I think we can see what mothers did and do also 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.030
 It is also clear that it is born only because the number of these has quadrupled 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.049
 single-parent pathways of this case formed 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:28.939
 zapopan sport women 

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:32.670
 89% of the single-parent family are women 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.690
 and in 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:38.260
 It also covers the single mother's range but can also be applied 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:42.250
 to the divorced mother to which the husbands do not pay tension and tomorrow 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.390
 for the children and willis moments that the crisis also influences and 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.010
 mclaren is suitable at home is sending from cala major the progenitor has 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:50.490
 recognized the son 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.130
 but then, as it were, it has been removed from the middle, not for the attention of 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.390
 no guy is absolutely responsible for anything and who 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.360
 fall all the responsibility is so much economic 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.259
 as sentimental 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:06.139
 in the mother and in that case that's why by a hundred we understand that family by a point 

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:09.369
 would not do well an important fact in the past and poverty of families 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:12.920
 monoparentales and and only that because we have a data that I would like 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.659
 give them and is that one in three single-parent homes have to spend the year 

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:22.909
 with a lower income and attention to 750 euros per month is to be fixed 

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:26.839
 for these cases the andalusian junta if it has specific help that's why I 

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:29.089
 and I recommend getting in touch with what 

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:30.719
 e counseling 

00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:36.519
 ok but with the telephone 900 200 999 because they exist for cases in which the 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:39.670
 sica a special economic difficulty in single-parent families 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.280
 they have special aids chain of one of the few autonomous communities in 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.309
 Spain that has it 

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:47.389
 get in touch with the board of Andalusia in that is very important to 

00:02:47.389 --> 00:02:51.119
 the amounts that betrays them passing very bad moody's if it meant that 

00:02:51.119 --> 00:02:53.379
 I've been working for several years with a 

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:56.050
 of women who exercise motherhood alone 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:00.640
 so frost and how the group is named and the main problem answers women 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.489
 They come truly is your problem 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:04.699
 economic 

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:06.249
 unreal because why 

00:03:06.249 --> 00:03:10.949
 it is a single-parent cradle not chosen here to differentiate is not the same 

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:15.219
 woman who chooses a life project where she wants to be a mother without a partner 

00:03:15.219 --> 00:03:19.150
 he has everything in fact the world with faith or face to next and throws cetra to 

00:03:19.149 --> 00:03:21.610
 a woman who in a moment of his life 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:25.530
 that the husband leaves the house stays alone you have to change your life 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:30.760
 radically and for this type of person it is essential that networks of 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.670
 social support among them is to say that they can meet other women in their 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.670
 same situation i be aware 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:41.029
 they will have to be able to appeal 

00:03:41.029 --> 00:03:43.150
 ap oviedo month and leisure characters 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.500
 or to the extended family because it is to reconcile work life and 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.540
 staff for these cases of course he says mom that for the rest of nothing and in the 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.579
 average of children but minus two children of satan mind what it is about 

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:56.589
 equal to what the large family 

00:03:56.589 --> 00:03:58.419
 single-parent family with two children 

00:03:58.419 --> 00:04:02.129
 percent and equal ab normal family with three that is done what congress 

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:06.129
 has has approved and is awaiting the coming into force soon 

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:07.739
 I fulfilled influences 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:10.169
 in a child how it influences 

00:04:10.169 --> 00:04:15.529
 the absence of the father or the mother in the situation as we are living and 

00:04:15.529 --> 00:04:19.729
 we are seeing from the family bosom may the main mind 

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:22.220
 ed influences if the emptiness 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:24.659
 to leave that father for his mother 

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:27.789
 north is filled in by the other spouse 

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:29.260
 The extended family 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:34.010
 or some outside figure can be truly traumatic because for you 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:38.070
 child who needs needs protection needs love needs education 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:41.520
 needs that celeste adm needs authority 

00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:47.430
 if the person who leaves that is not covered by the person who stays then yes 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:51.379
 there may be problems but if the person who remains exercises the paternal function 

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:55.969
 of the maternal function and knows how to delegate to another person and I felt supported not 

00:04:55.969 --> 00:05:00.150
 it has to be traumatic for him, no one is allowed to say hello. 

00:05:00.149 --> 00:05:04.050
 let yourself be helped and keep in mind that the girl needs support 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:08.650
 wide one person for everything is very complicated data both at the level 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:13.360
 work as all school failure clan of 5% higher school failure 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.059
 apparently in family 

00:05:16.059 --> 00:05:20.240
 in the sight of the felling and where there is a clear but why this happens because 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:23.669
 if you need to work to cover part of the expenses 

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:27.340
 yes the pri you do not have time if you do not have time they can not take care of your son 

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:28.720
 duly with which 

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:33.280
 the children that was a bit there in a void where, of course, they abandon their 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:34.789
 studies in germany 

00:05:34.789 --> 00:05:38.599
 you have to be on top of it then it is a totally common sense data 

00:05:38.599 --> 00:05:41.919
 for a working mother try to take him to school activities 

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:45.479
 take him to school echoes that do not have time that is completely impossible 

00:05:45.479 --> 00:05:49.610
 a particular class these cetaceans world and that impacts on 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:50.910
 in the exit training 

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:53.500
 the weakness of the Christmas of the formation of the minors that the family 

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:57.040
 Numerous of those who have many help to the catalog of family help 

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:00.100
 numerous is very broad because of what the congress has approved 

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:03.950
 this modification so that a single-parent family with two children 

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:08.270
 is equated to a family with two parents who have three children 

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:10.139
 school are the help palos to concretize 

00:06:10.139 --> 00:06:13.580
 which idea would be housing aids irpf deductions 

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:18.539
 help for transport point for the school this is a catalog of help 

00:06:18.539 --> 00:06:19.669
 very spacious 

00:06:19.669 --> 00:06:22.660
 both at the state and regional level I recommend always 

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:25.780
 to go to the community social services so that they give you the 

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:27.939
 catalog of everything that corresponds to you 

00:06:27.939 --> 00:06:30.650
 of a person that the need for another boat 

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:34.480
 it opens of course to union and bangladesh one lived what happens that its 

00:06:34.479 --> 00:06:37.469
 Hellenic be enough because for more help you get 

00:06:37.469 --> 00:06:40.480
