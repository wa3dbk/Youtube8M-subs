00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.890
 up my room 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.500
 so what is the setup of my 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.470
 bass room is so a video where I 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.360
 will show you a little what finally 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.489
 what do I have that a 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.110
 material to make my videos and you 

00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:31.290
 prefer to introduce yourself to the bat passage 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:33.090
 exactly where I play so bah we are beautiful 

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:34.620
 and well in my room so I have 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.530
 a lot of small panels are going to this 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.269
 interesting point so lie alba the box 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.719
 of my bits that's my lenses because 

00:00:39.269 --> 00:00:45.649
 that I denied now so bah ma 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:48.749
 room simply autofocus here 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:50.730
 So here I am, I'm going first 

00:00:48.749 --> 00:00:53.579
 spend 20 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:58.079
 pc side because I'm still 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:59.609
 pretty well equipped I think so we'll 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.289
 so start with my microphone to make 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.690
 my videos so I have already done in 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.040
 principle a disappointed video but for those 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.770
 that it would interest kind of makes a 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.409
 finally I speak again so kroell aut 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:13.020
 namik 900 b or should it be found at 55 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.280
 euros on amazon it's a very very good 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.009
 microphone but must absolutely use 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:20.009
 audacity and not fraps because he 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:22.020
 do not record hyper strong so that's it 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:25.259
 it's a little thing that needs to be clarified 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.890
 all the same there my mouse which I made 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.740
 a boxing eye so that is the cyborg 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:33.570
 mmo 7 for those who want to see 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:37.079
 dedicated by autofocus so it's fine 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.649
 that I have that I have here what you 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.590
 want to use it 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:42.329
 here is my gaming mouse very very good 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.219
 mouse that you can find at the price 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.259
 of 110 euros so yes I would say all 

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:47.130
 price pretty much just because 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.280
 that when we see what you want 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:53.850
 equip you then good the keyboard I 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:57.000
 could not get better planet but it 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:02:00.060
 is enough so it's cyborg v5 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.700
 gobeil pay 50 euros 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.649
 everywhere a little bit everywhere 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.240
 its backlit that of course I can 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.140
 turn it off but I prefer good to him 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:12.180
 but I think it gives a little bit of 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:15.630
 class then the fagot carpet of 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:18.209
 steelseries mouse good that 5 euros so 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.280
 Then I have you like traveling 2 lot 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:23.730
 of speakers a bass down are 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.920
 down so I was going through that so there 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.239
 it's still the one and 2c 2.1 so 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.370
 they are both branches and on 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:33.840
 my pc to reach his little bit more 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:36.630
 powerful so that's philips 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:39.540
 I have more reference pretty much they 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:42.630
 make cold blood 100 watts 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.430
 close with the with the base of course 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.599
 so there the beats to a misstep to do 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.760
 thanks to me that sticking stickers 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:50.220
 so you can find it pretty much at 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.980
 price of 100 euros just about it's 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.660
 really very good material 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.610
 you will hear very well and afterwards by 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.530
 example me when I do not look for 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.640

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.459

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:08.640
 so given essential b kits in 2.1 

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:10.650
 that you can find at the price of 40 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.239
 euros and who are pretty much good they 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.310
 do 40 watts and that are really 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:15.540

 my pc we will sit down 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:04.470

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:21.150
 intel core i5 2300 20 years old sees the map 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:24.660
 chart amd radeon hd 7000 350000 24

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:32.940

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.270
 put usb keys for it to move a 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:36.270

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:44.880
 Then we will move on to this 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:47.160
 place there so not to the cheeks while 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:51.210
 simply call to around my console 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:53.699
 what so jumped autofocus so my TV 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:57.590
 it's a nasser 82 cm so I do not know 

00:04:53.699 --> 00:05:00.320
 exactly the references it's a no 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:03.900
 main hdl is the best quality 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:05.370
 cd hdf in the genre but good as long as 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.979
 expects that in hd me I do not care 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:09.570
 completely 

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:11.639
 here is my wired controller son son 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:14.460
 at the same time good my microphone to talk 

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:15.690
 on xbox so that's done by the way 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:18.510
 a transition in order to recharge the 

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:21.030
 bank just goes from the xbox 360 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:22.139
 slim is there as you can see 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:24.449
 wait, we do not see very well but 

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:27.389
 it does not matter my avermedia game 

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:29.699
 capture hd so it's the soul knows it 281 

00:05:27.389 --> 00:05:32.669
 you prove that you can find at 

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:35.720
 price of 120 euros on amazon too 

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:41.070
 he thinks you're so youth she 

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:42.300
 believe that finally ceded the cdu 1090 cdu 

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:44.220
 and not 1080p 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:46.970
 so it's not the best quality but 

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:50.400
 this is the h2 wolf or sees his pass 

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:54.389
 after all that is so there towards 

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:56.280
 louisiana and so ordered for the front 

00:05:54.389 --> 00:06:01.169
 media so I like hard drive a brush 

00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:03.389
 320 gigas good after my games I have 

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:05.009
 very little but there I do not have them all so 

00:06:03.389 --> 00:06:07.229
 at the base of the far cry May 3 that I 

00:06:05.009 --> 00:06:09.139
 loaned blackhawks 2 for the horizon and 

00:06:07.229 --> 00:06:10.590
 bf3 yes I really have very few games 

00:06:09.139 --> 00:06:11.880
 in box measurement 

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:14.090
 knowing that 

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:19.170
 that I sold them actually some 

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:22.440
 I sold a lot so my headphones I 

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:24.270
 do not know where they have a fair use by the 

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:26.010
 cyborg but as I do not use it anymore 

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:27.140
 down I will not make it appear in 

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:29.820
 this video 

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:33.230
 so there so there you can see a little 

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:35.940
 but goody so the little big planet the 

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:38.400
 so selva that of far cry 3 by three 

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:39.870
 Missions me quickly what is 

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:41.760
 inside so I already made a donkey 

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:42.300
 boxing that you could see at the beginning 

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:45.090
 video 

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:47.010
 so that can be explained as it can be 

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:48.690
 have my phone marked for those 

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:50.150
 who want to know so that's yes I 

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:54.780

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:20.820
