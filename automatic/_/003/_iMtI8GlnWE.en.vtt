00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:04.249 

now<00:00:03.330> what<00:00:03.480> do<00:00:03.600> you<00:00:03.629> think<00:00:03.689> about<00:00:03.840> we<00:00:04.020> start

00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:04.259 
now what do you think about we start

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:06.019 
now what do you think about we start
with<00:00:04.290> this<00:00:04.470> one<00:00:04.710> sure<00:00:04.980> okay<00:00:05.549> there's<00:00:05.850> three

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
with this one sure okay there's three

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:07.909 
with this one sure okay there's three
things<00:00:06.240> I<00:00:06.420> look<00:00:06.600> for<00:00:06.629> before<00:00:07.140> I<00:00:07.200> drop<00:00:07.560> a<00:00:07.589> tree

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
things I look for before I drop a tree

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.220 
things I look for before I drop a tree
number<00:00:08.189> one<00:00:08.490> obstacles<00:00:09.269> is<00:00:09.420> it<00:00:09.870> going<00:00:10.050> to<00:00:10.110> get

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
number one obstacles is it going to get

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.860 
number one obstacles is it going to get
hung<00:00:10.440> up<00:00:10.590> in<00:00:10.769> another<00:00:11.099> tree<00:00:11.400> to<00:00:11.639> weather<00:00:12.540> any

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
hung up in another tree to weather any

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.780 
hung up in another tree to weather any
overhead<00:00:13.349> why<00:00:13.650> is<00:00:13.710> it<00:00:14.099> could<00:00:14.250> get<00:00:14.400> caught<00:00:14.610> up

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
overhead why is it could get caught up

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.779 
overhead why is it could get caught up
in<00:00:14.940> third<00:00:15.509> is<00:00:15.780> there<00:00:16.080> an<00:00:16.170> escape<00:00:16.500> route<00:00:16.949> now

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
in third is there an escape route now

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.099 
in third is there an escape route now
escape<00:00:17.940> route<00:00:18.270> is<00:00:18.359> very<00:00:18.539> important<00:00:19.020> because

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
escape route is very important because

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.529 
escape route is very important because
when<00:00:19.380> this<00:00:19.500> tree<00:00:19.710> starts<00:00:20.039> to<00:00:20.189> move<00:00:20.369> or<00:00:21.029> brushes

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
when this tree starts to move or brushes

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.300 
when this tree starts to move or brushes
another<00:00:21.810> tree<00:00:22.140> that's<00:00:22.380> where<00:00:22.590> the<00:00:22.740> limbs<00:00:23.070> and

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
another tree that's where the limbs and

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.370 
another tree that's where the limbs and
debris<00:00:23.400> start<00:00:23.939> to<00:00:24.060> fall<00:00:24.269> so<00:00:24.869> we<00:00:24.990> want<00:00:25.140> to<00:00:25.230> make

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
debris start to fall so we want to make

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.650 
debris start to fall so we want to make
sure<00:00:25.410> we<00:00:25.769> get<00:00:25.920> back<00:00:25.980> 15<00:00:26.609> to<00:00:26.730> 20<00:00:27.029> feet<00:00:27.210> back<00:00:27.449> in

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
sure we get back 15 to 20 feet back in

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.259 
sure we get back 15 to 20 feet back in
this<00:00:27.779> position<00:00:28.019> over<00:00:28.470> here<00:00:28.670> so<00:00:29.670> this<00:00:30.029> will<00:00:30.179> be

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
this position over here so this will be

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.160 
this position over here so this will be
our<00:00:30.300> escape<00:00:30.779> route<00:00:30.990> that<00:00:31.019> we<00:00:31.289> use<00:00:31.730> got<00:00:32.730> it<00:00:33.170> okay

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
our escape route that we use got it okay

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.600 
our escape route that we use got it okay
next<00:00:34.410> what<00:00:34.649> we're<00:00:34.770> going<00:00:34.860> to<00:00:34.920> take<00:00:35.100> a<00:00:35.160> look<00:00:35.370> at

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
next what we're going to take a look at

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.549 
next what we're going to take a look at
is<00:00:35.820> and<00:00:36.030> Roger<00:00:36.180> maybe<00:00:36.420> you<00:00:36.540> can<00:00:36.719> help<00:00:36.840> we'll

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
is and Roger maybe you can help we'll

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.310 
is and Roger maybe you can help we'll
take<00:00:37.770> a<00:00:37.820> look<00:00:38.820> at<00:00:38.969> our<00:00:39.120> target<00:00:39.690> that<00:00:40.050> we<00:00:40.140> plan

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
take a look at our target that we plan

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.459 
take a look at our target that we plan
to<00:00:40.350> place<00:00:40.710> the<00:00:40.890> tree<00:00:41.129> so<00:00:42.000> get<00:00:42.989> out<00:00:43.140> in<00:00:43.320> this

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
to place the tree so get out in this

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.950 
to place the tree so get out in this
position<00:00:44.010> here<00:00:44.430> just<00:00:45.270> at<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.510> edge<00:00:45.629> of<00:00:45.840> the

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
position here just at the edge of the

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.119 
position here just at the edge of the
brush<00:00:46.730> and<00:00:47.809> so<00:00:48.809> here<00:00:49.110> now<00:00:49.320> we<00:00:49.350> want<00:00:49.680> to<00:00:49.800> look<00:00:49.920> at

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
brush and so here now we want to look at

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.369 
brush and so here now we want to look at
two<00:00:50.340> leads<00:00:50.640> we<00:00:51.360> want<00:00:51.539> to<00:00:51.629> look<00:00:51.750> at<00:00:51.899> side<00:00:52.140> to

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
two leads we want to look at side to

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.350 
two leads we want to look at side to
side<00:00:52.620> for<00:00:52.890> this<00:00:52.980> position<00:00:53.219> and<00:00:53.640> so<00:00:54.120> if<00:00:54.270> you

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
side for this position and so if you

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.850 
side for this position and so if you
look<00:00:54.510> at<00:00:54.570> this<00:00:54.750> tree<00:00:55.020> there's<00:00:55.260> very<00:00:55.559> little

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
look at this tree there's very little

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.010 
look at this tree there's very little
lean<00:00:56.129> it<00:00:56.309> almost<00:00:56.640> comes<00:00:56.910> down<00:00:57.149> straight<00:00:57.629> right

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
lean it almost comes down straight right

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.869 
lean it almost comes down straight right
if<00:00:58.289> you<00:00:58.379> take<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.770> crown<00:00:58.980> width<00:00:59.250> and<00:00:59.399> then

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
if you take the crown width and then

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.479 
if you take the crown width and then
over<00:01:00.329> to<00:01:00.480> this<00:01:00.660> side<00:01:00.960> we<00:01:01.590> look<00:01:01.770> at<00:01:01.890> forward<00:01:02.340> to

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
over to this side we look at forward to

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.640 
over to this side we look at forward to
back<00:01:02.699> and<00:01:03.120> you<00:01:03.149> can<00:01:03.750> see<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:04.110> limbs<00:01:04.320> are<00:01:04.530> out

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
back and you can see the limbs are out

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.530 
back and you can see the limbs are out
forward<00:01:05.159> here<00:01:05.339> so<00:01:05.489> it<00:01:05.580> comes<00:01:05.790> down<00:01:05.939> probably<00:01:06.510> a

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
forward here so it comes down probably a

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.399 
forward here so it comes down probably a
foot<00:01:06.780> or<00:01:06.900> two<00:01:07.049> of<00:01:07.080> forward<00:01:07.590> lean<00:01:07.770> okay<00:01:08.430> okay<00:01:09.409> we

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
foot or two of forward lean okay okay we

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.620 
foot or two of forward lean okay okay we
already<00:01:10.560> talked<00:01:10.920> about<00:01:11.040> our<00:01:11.220> scape<00:01:11.729> route<00:01:12.000> so

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
already talked about our scape route so

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.330 
already talked about our scape route so
all<00:01:12.990> we<00:01:13.140> really<00:01:13.170> need<00:01:13.530> to<00:01:13.619> do<00:01:13.740> now<00:01:13.950> is<00:01:14.189> think

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
all we really need to do now is think

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.840 
all we really need to do now is think
about<00:01:14.490> our<00:01:15.000> cutting<00:01:15.720> plan<00:01:15.930> okay<00:01:16.560> and<00:01:16.860> so<00:01:17.670> on

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
about our cutting plan okay and so on

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.640 
about our cutting plan okay and so on
this<00:01:18.000> particular<00:01:18.180> tree<00:01:18.720> we're<00:01:19.259> going<00:01:19.409> to<00:01:19.470> use

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
this particular tree we're going to use

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.130 
this particular tree we're going to use
our<00:01:19.860> sights<00:01:20.369> on<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:20.759> saw<00:01:20.939> line<00:01:21.540> it<00:01:21.720> up<00:01:21.810> to<00:01:22.020> our

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
our sights on the saw line it up to our

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.330 
our sights on the saw line it up to our
target<00:01:22.409> okay

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
target okay

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.520 
target okay
the<00:01:23.520> next<00:01:23.850> we'll<00:01:24.000> take<00:01:24.180> do<00:01:24.540> our<00:01:24.659> top<00:01:24.930> cut<00:01:25.229> first

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
the next we'll take do our top cut first

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.550 
the next we'll take do our top cut first
down<00:01:25.830> into<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.280> tree<00:01:26.520> and<00:01:26.780> then<00:01:27.780> turn<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.380> saw

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
down into the tree and then turn the saw

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.410 
down into the tree and then turn the saw
start<00:01:29.340> on<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.549> corner<00:01:29.880> of<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.060> knotch

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
start on the corner of the knotch

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.390 
start on the corner of the knotch
come<00:01:30.689> around<00:01:30.960> here<00:01:31.439> and<00:01:31.590> we<00:01:31.979> take<00:01:32.189> out<00:01:32.369> our

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
come around here and we take out our

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.450 
come around here and we take out our
open<00:01:32.790> face<00:01:32.970> notch<00:01:33.290> okay<00:01:34.290> we<00:01:34.860> ready<00:01:35.009> ready

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
open face notch okay we ready ready

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.460 
open face notch okay we ready ready
now<00:01:37.970> he's<00:01:38.150> making<00:01:38.510> the<00:01:38.630> front<00:01:38.870> cut<00:01:39.200> he's

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.470 
now he's making the front cut he's

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.200 
now he's making the front cut he's
coming<00:01:39.800> down<00:01:39.980> at<00:01:40.190> an<00:01:40.310> angle

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
coming down at an angle

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.980 
coming down at an angle
and<00:01:42.570> then<00:01:42.660> once<00:01:43.050> the<00:01:43.230> front<00:01:43.500> cut<00:01:43.680> is<00:01:43.830> complete

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
and then once the front cut is complete

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.540 
and then once the front cut is complete
first<00:01:45.990> part<00:01:46.260> of<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.440> front<00:01:46.650> cut<00:01:46.860> is<00:01:46.980> an<00:01:47.160> angle

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:47.550 
first part of the front cut is an angle

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:50.150 
first part of the front cut is an angle
cut<00:01:47.790> now<00:01:48.060> he's<00:01:48.240> making<00:01:48.420> his<00:01:48.720> bottom<00:01:49.140> cut<00:01:49.380> take

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:50.160 
cut now he's making his bottom cut take

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.810 
cut now he's making his bottom cut take
out<00:01:50.340> a<00:01:50.370> piece<00:01:51.830> now<00:01:52.830> he's<00:01:53.070> finished<00:01:53.400> the<00:01:53.550> front

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
out a piece now he's finished the front

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.460 
out a piece now he's finished the front
cut<00:01:54.030> and<00:01:54.180> he's<00:01:54.300> going<00:01:54.450> to<00:01:54.540> make<00:01:54.690> his<00:01:54.840> back<00:01:55.170> cut

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
cut and he's going to make his back cut

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.740 
cut and he's going to make his back cut
when<00:01:55.950> he<00:01:56.040> makes<00:01:56.250> it<00:01:56.460> back<00:01:56.700> out<00:01:56.970> it<00:01:57.150> is<00:01:57.270> slightly

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
when he makes it back out it is slightly

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.290 
when he makes it back out it is slightly
above<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.680> front<00:01:58.920> cut<00:01:59.220> and<00:01:59.550> as<00:01:59.940> he<00:02:00.060> cuts

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:00.300 
above the front cut and as he cuts

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.270 
above the front cut and as he cuts
through<00:02:00.450> he's<00:02:00.750> going<00:02:00.930> to<00:02:00.990> leave<00:02:01.229> one<00:02:01.770> inch<00:02:02.100> of

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
through he's going to leave one inch of

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.580 
through he's going to leave one inch of
wood<00:02:02.460> and<00:02:03.270> that's<00:02:03.479> going<00:02:03.720> to<00:02:03.810> make<00:02:04.110> a<00:02:04.140> hinge

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
wood and that's going to make a hinge

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:14.110 
wood and that's going to make a hinge
that<00:02:05.220> hinge<00:02:05.610> controls<00:02:06.300> how<00:02:06.780> the<00:02:06.840> tree<00:02:07.170> Falls

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.199 

now<00:02:15.110> it's<00:02:15.290> time<00:02:15.470> for<00:02:15.530> cleanup<00:02:15.970> and<00:02:16.970> you're

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
now it's time for cleanup and you're

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:18.640 
now it's time for cleanup and you're
right<00:02:17.420> Roger<00:02:17.720> a<00:02:17.900> lot<00:02:18.140> of<00:02:18.260> times<00:02:18.440> people

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
right Roger a lot of times people

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.680 
right Roger a lot of times people
overlook<00:02:19.069> this<00:02:19.430> part<00:02:19.730> but<00:02:19.910> you<00:02:20.330> know<00:02:20.450> a<00:02:20.480> lot<00:02:20.660> of

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
overlook this part but you know a lot of

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:22.270 
overlook this part but you know a lot of
accidents<00:02:21.080> and<00:02:21.319> injuries<00:02:21.680> happen<00:02:22.099> in<00:02:22.190> the

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
accidents and injuries happen in the

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.670 
accidents and injuries happen in the
cleanup<00:02:22.489> process<00:02:22.879> why<00:02:23.569> is<00:02:23.629> that<00:02:23.720> well<00:02:24.440> there's

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
cleanup process why is that well there's

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.740 
cleanup process why is that well there's
a<00:02:24.739> lot<00:02:24.890> of<00:02:25.040> weight<00:02:25.220> down<00:02:25.580> here<00:02:26.060> in<00:02:26.330> the<00:02:26.450> trunk

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
a lot of weight down here in the trunk

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.530 
a lot of weight down here in the trunk
that's<00:02:27.319> causing<00:02:27.590> pressures<00:02:28.220> in<00:02:28.400> the<00:02:28.430> top<00:02:28.760> so

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
that's causing pressures in the top so

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.119 
that's causing pressures in the top so
we<00:02:29.660> want<00:02:29.840> to<00:02:29.930> kind<00:02:30.110> of<00:02:30.170> work<00:02:30.349> our<00:02:30.530> way<00:02:30.680> up<00:02:30.709> and

00:02:31.119 --> 00:02:31.129 
we want to kind of work our way up and

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:33.160 
we want to kind of work our way up and
see<00:02:31.459> if<00:02:31.519> we<00:02:31.580> can't<00:02:31.849> reduce<00:02:32.150> that<00:02:32.450> so<00:02:32.959> I'm<00:02:33.080> going

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
see if we can't reduce that so I'm going

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.440 
see if we can't reduce that so I'm going
to<00:02:33.290> take<00:02:33.440> start<00:02:34.160> in<00:02:34.250> this<00:02:34.400> area<00:02:34.700> here<00:02:35.120> I'm

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
to take start in this area here I'm

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.420 
to take start in this area here I'm
going<00:02:35.660> to<00:02:35.720> put<00:02:35.900> a<00:02:35.930> wedge<00:02:36.170> underneath<00:02:36.590> just<00:02:37.340> so

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
going to put a wedge underneath just so

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.910 
going to put a wedge underneath just so
I<00:02:37.489> don't<00:02:37.580> get<00:02:37.879> into<00:02:38.180> the<00:02:38.299> ground<00:02:38.540> start<00:02:39.470> up<00:02:39.650> and

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
I don't get into the ground start up and

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.240 
I don't get into the ground start up and
start<00:02:40.430> a<00:02:40.489> cut<00:02:40.670> from<00:02:40.879> the<00:02:41.030> top<00:02:41.239> here

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
start a cut from the top here

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.500 
start a cut from the top here
nice<00:02:44.250> todson<00:02:44.790> cut<00:02:45.060> on<00:02:45.180> the<00:02:45.300> top<00:02:45.540> of<00:02:45.750> the<00:02:45.810> log

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
nice todson cut on the top of the log

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.920 
nice todson cut on the top of the log
he's<00:02:47.810> going<00:02:48.020> to<00:02:48.080> stop<00:02:48.410> now<00:02:49.690> he's<00:02:50.690> going<00:02:50.870> to

keep<00:02:55.730> the<00:02:55.910> blog<00:02:56.360> from<00:02:56.750> pinching<00:02:57.260> his<00:02:57.410> saw<00:02:57.910> he

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
keep the blog from pinching his saw he

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:01.210 
keep the blog from pinching his saw he
makes<00:02:59.120> his<00:02:59.239> cut<00:02:59.450> all<00:02:59.569> the<00:02:59.690> way<00:02:59.810> through<00:03:00.220> now

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
makes his cut all the way through now

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:02.890 
makes his cut all the way through now
we're<00:03:01.430> ready<00:03:01.610> to<00:03:01.700> limb<00:03:01.970> the<00:03:02.120> tree<00:03:02.330> we<00:03:02.690> have<00:03:02.870> a

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
we're ready to limb the tree we have a

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.690 
we're ready to limb the tree we have a
branch<00:03:03.260> here<00:03:03.560> that's<00:03:03.800> suspended<00:03:04.400> above<00:03:04.519> the

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
branch here that's suspended above the

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.430 
branch here that's suspended above the
rest<00:03:05.000> of<00:03:05.120> the<00:03:05.239> tree<00:03:05.450> so<00:03:05.930> we're<00:03:06.050> going<00:03:06.170> to<00:03:06.260> take

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
rest of the tree so we're going to take

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.559 
rest of the tree so we're going to take
that<00:03:06.590> off<00:03:06.830> for<00:03:07.099> us<00:03:07.130> he's<00:03:07.880> going<00:03:08.060> to<00:03:08.120> take<00:03:08.300> off<00:03:08.540> a

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:08.569 
that off for us he's going to take off a

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:10.300 
that off for us he's going to take off a
small<00:03:08.989> branch<00:03:09.290> and<00:03:09.530> get<00:03:09.620> that<00:03:09.830> out<00:03:09.890> of<00:03:10.130> the<00:03:10.190> way

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
small branch and get that out of the way

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:11.890 
small branch and get that out of the way
now<00:03:10.550> he's<00:03:10.730> cutting<00:03:11.000> right<00:03:11.300> through<00:03:11.599> the<00:03:11.750> limb

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
now he's cutting right through the limb

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:18.600 
now he's cutting right through the limb
and<00:03:12.319> we'll<00:03:12.440> drag<00:03:12.739> it<00:03:12.920> out<00:03:13.010> of<00:03:13.040> the<00:03:13.190> way<00:03:15.370> got<00:03:16.370> it

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:18.610 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:20.830 

okay<00:03:19.610> bill<00:03:19.790> this<00:03:20.000> diameter<00:03:20.360> is<00:03:20.569> a<00:03:20.630> little

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
okay bill this diameter is a little

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.140 
okay bill this diameter is a little
small<00:03:21.140> for<00:03:21.380> us<00:03:21.410> to<00:03:21.500> use<00:03:21.709> a<00:03:21.739> wedge<00:03:22.040> on<00:03:22.310> so<00:03:22.819> what

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
small for us to use a wedge on so what

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:24.550 
small for us to use a wedge on so what
I'm<00:03:23.239> going<00:03:23.390> to<00:03:23.450> suggest<00:03:23.569> here<00:03:24.019> is<00:03:24.110> we<00:03:24.260> do<00:03:24.440> an

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
I'm going to suggest here is we do an

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.920 
I'm going to suggest here is we do an
offset<00:03:24.799> cut<00:03:25.370> in<00:03:25.579> this<00:03:26.060> case<00:03:26.269> right<00:03:26.510> here<00:03:26.569> we'll

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
offset cut in this case right here we'll

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:29.289 
offset cut in this case right here we'll
cut<00:03:27.170> down<00:03:27.440> and<00:03:27.769> then<00:03:28.130> slightly<00:03:28.489> out<00:03:28.819> and<00:03:29.150> up

00:03:29.289 --> 00:03:29.299 
cut down and then slightly out and up

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:31.449 
cut down and then slightly out and up
under<00:03:29.630> until<00:03:30.049> those<00:03:30.290> two<00:03:30.530> or<00:03:30.680> mismatch<00:03:31.099> the

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:31.459 
under until those two or mismatch the

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:38.270 
under until those two or mismatch the
piece<00:03:31.670> just<00:03:31.849> falls<00:03:32.150> away<00:03:32.329> okay

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.830 

two<00:03:39.280> thirds<00:03:39.550> of<00:03:39.730> the<00:03:39.820> way<00:03:39.970> through<00:03:40.000> now

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
two thirds of the way through now

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:56.610 
two thirds of the way through now
