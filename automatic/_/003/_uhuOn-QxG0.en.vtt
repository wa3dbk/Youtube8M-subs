00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
within the game and we go ahead and we

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.550 
within the game and we go ahead and we
go<00:01:38.040> out<00:01:38.220> and<00:01:38.490> we<00:01:38.880> try<00:01:39.720> to<00:01:39.780> destroy<00:01:40.290> those

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
go out and we try to destroy those

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.649 
go out and we try to destroy those
people<00:01:40.950> try<00:01:41.159> to<00:01:41.189> destroy<00:01:41.700> those<00:01:41.939> zombies<00:01:42.479> and

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
people try to destroy those zombies and

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:43.969 
people try to destroy those zombies and
it<00:01:42.750> works<00:01:42.960> really<00:01:43.259> well<00:01:43.409> and<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.710> reason<00:01:43.860> why

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
it works really well and the reason why

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.289 
it works really well and the reason why
I<00:01:44.009> call<00:01:44.189> it<00:01:44.220> frenemies<00:01:44.640> is<00:01:44.820> because<00:01:45.149> I

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
I call it frenemies is because I

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.440 
I call it frenemies is because I
wouldn't<00:01:45.810> say<00:01:45.899> I<00:01:45.930> use<00:01:46.290> these<00:01:46.530> characters<00:01:47.159> as

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
wouldn't say I use these characters as

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.490 
wouldn't say I use these characters as
characters<00:01:48.450> that<00:01:48.659> I<00:01:48.810> don't<00:01:48.990> care<00:01:49.320> about

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
characters that I don't care about

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.160 
characters that I don't care about
however<00:01:50.369> in<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:51.149> long<00:01:51.299> run<00:01:51.630> they<00:01:52.140> are

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
however in the long run they are

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.010 
however in the long run they are
characters<00:01:52.829> that<00:01:52.860> over<00:01:53.759> time<00:01:53.970> they<00:01:54.659> matter<00:01:54.930> a

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
characters that over time they matter a

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.690 
characters that over time they matter a
little<00:01:55.259> bit<00:01:55.350> less<00:01:55.530> than<00:01:55.680> if<00:01:55.799> they<00:01:55.950> die<00:01:56.159> I<00:01:56.189> don't

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
little bit less than if they die I don't

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.910 
little bit less than if they die I don't
lose<00:01:56.909> any<00:01:57.240> sleep<00:01:57.479> over<00:01:57.780> now<00:01:58.380> one<00:01:58.590> of<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:58.799> nice

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
lose any sleep over now one of the nice

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.499 
lose any sleep over now one of the nice
things<00:01:58.979> would<00:01:59.430> use<00:01:59.549> in<00:01:59.700> frenemies<00:02:00.119> is<00:02:00.360> you

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
things would use in frenemies is you

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.389 
things would use in frenemies is you
have<00:02:00.659> situations<00:02:01.229> like<00:02:01.380> that<00:02:01.439> the<00:02:01.770> AI<00:02:01.950> in<00:02:02.280> this

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
have situations like that the AI in this

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.580 
have situations like that the AI in this
game<00:02:02.460> is<00:02:02.759> actually<00:02:02.909> fairly<00:02:03.450> good<00:02:03.930> and<00:02:04.170> fairly

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
game is actually fairly good and fairly

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.029 
game is actually fairly good and fairly
aggressive<00:02:05.219> towards<00:02:05.490> enemies<00:02:05.909> leaving<00:02:06.719> you

00:02:07.029 --> 00:02:07.039 
aggressive towards enemies leaving you

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:10.219 
aggressive towards enemies leaving you
with<00:02:08.039> a<00:02:08.250> little<00:02:08.550> bit<00:02:08.670> of<00:02:08.789> leeway<00:02:09.179> compared<00:02:09.989> to

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
with a little bit of leeway compared to

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.390 
with a little bit of leeway compared to
past<00:02:10.500> games<00:02:10.800> where<00:02:11.220> maybe<00:02:11.340> the<00:02:11.550> AI<00:02:11.700> just

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
past games where maybe the AI just

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.920 
past games where maybe the AI just
continually<00:02:12.910> gets<00:02:13.090> its<00:02:13.210> ass<00:02:13.420> kicked<00:02:13.750> that

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
continually gets its ass kicked that

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.900 
continually gets its ass kicked that

in a different strategy I'm gonna cover
the<00:02:28.900> skills<00:02:29.290> and<00:02:29.740> how<00:02:30.550> those<00:02:30.880> skills<00:02:31.090> affect

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
the skills and how those skills affect

of<00:02:39.670> course<00:02:39.880> everybody's<00:02:40.330> game<00:02:40.570> is<00:02:40.690> gonna<00:02:40.810> be

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
of course everybody's game is gonna be

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.420 
of course everybody's game is gonna be
slightly<00:02:41.140> different<00:02:41.410> because<00:02:41.620> the<00:02:41.950> game<00:02:42.190> is

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
slightly different because the game is

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.940 
slightly different because the game is
randomized<00:02:43.090> but<00:02:43.600> again<00:02:43.930> if<00:02:44.170> you<00:02:44.410> find<00:02:44.650> a<00:02:44.800> spot

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
randomized but again if you find a spot

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:46.620 
randomized but again if you find a spot
that's<00:02:45.280> really<00:02:45.520> difficult<00:02:46.000> if<00:02:46.150> you<00:02:46.240> want<00:02:46.510> to

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
that's really difficult if you want to

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:47.940 
that's really difficult if you want to
do<00:02:46.720> something<00:02:47.170> but<00:02:47.260> you're<00:02:47.470> a<00:02:47.500> little<00:02:47.680> nervous

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
do something but you're a little nervous

me<00:04:17.169> you<00:04:17.320> know<00:04:17.440> state<00:04:17.709> of<00:04:17.859> decay<00:04:18.100> has<00:04:18.340> an

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489 
me you know state of decay has an

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:20.909 
me you know state of decay has an
incredible<00:04:19.330> number<00:04:19.630> of<00:04:19.959> systems<00:04:20.560> and<00:04:20.739> things

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:20.919 
incredible number of systems and things

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:22.469 
incredible number of systems and things
going<00:04:21.220> on<00:04:21.400> in<00:04:21.549> the<00:04:21.609> background<00:04:22.000> I<00:04:22.090> think<00:04:22.120> it's

00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:22.479 
going on in the background I think it's

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:24.360 
going on in the background I think it's
vital<00:04:22.780> for<00:04:22.960> people<00:04:23.380> to<00:04:23.470> understand<00:04:24.070> those

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370 
vital for people to understand those

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:25.470 
vital for people to understand those
things<00:04:24.400> because<00:04:24.850> it<00:04:24.970> can<00:04:25.090> take<00:04:25.210> a

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:25.480 
things because it can take a

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:28.020 
things because it can take a
long<00:04:25.630> time<00:04:25.990> for<00:04:26.560> you<00:04:26.650> to<00:04:26.740> pick<00:04:26.890> up<00:04:26.950> the<00:04:27.580> various

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.030 
long time for you to pick up the various

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:30.660 
long time for you to pick up the various
idiosyncrasies<00:04:28.930> that<00:04:28.960> the<00:04:29.230> game<00:04:29.500> has<00:04:29.860> and<00:04:30.220> I

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:30.670 
idiosyncrasies that the game has and I

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:32.700 
idiosyncrasies that the game has and I
don't<00:04:30.700> mean<00:04:31.090> that<00:04:31.270> as<00:04:31.420> a<00:04:31.450> negative<00:04:32.020> in<00:04:32.200> fact<00:04:32.470> I

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710 
don't mean that as a negative in fact I

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:34.170 
don't mean that as a negative in fact I
think<00:04:32.920> the<00:04:33.010> game<00:04:33.190> is<00:04:33.220> phenomenal<00:04:33.940> when<00:04:34.090> it

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.180 
think the game is phenomenal when it

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:35.790 
think the game is phenomenal when it
comes<00:04:34.390> to<00:04:34.510> all<00:04:34.750> the<00:04:34.930> systems<00:04:35.350> and<00:04:35.530> all<00:04:35.620> the

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:35.800 
comes to all the systems and all the

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.980 
comes to all the systems and all the
things<00:04:36.010> you<00:04:36.160> can<00:04:36.400> do<00:04:36.610> but<00:04:37.210> it<00:04:37.360> does<00:04:37.570> require<00:04:37.780> a

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:37.990 
things you can do but it does require a

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:40.140 
things you can do but it does require a
little<00:04:38.500> thinking<00:04:38.830> out<00:04:39.010> of<00:04:39.040> the<00:04:39.190> box<00:04:39.250> at<00:04:39.760> times

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
little thinking out of the box at times

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:42.240 
little thinking out of the box at times
and<00:04:40.510> I<00:04:40.810> just<00:04:40.840> figured<00:04:41.320> that<00:04:41.350> these<00:04:41.710> strategy

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:42.250 
and I just figured that these strategy

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:44.010 
and I just figured that these strategy
sessions<00:04:42.730> would<00:04:42.940> help<00:04:43.210> a<00:04:43.300> lot<00:04:43.330> for<00:04:43.750> some<00:04:43.930> of
