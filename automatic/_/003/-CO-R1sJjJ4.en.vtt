teleport<00:05:00.510> a<00:05:00.600> certain<00:05:00.810> number<00:05:00.900> of<00:05:01.050> players<00:05:01.229> you

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:01.410 
teleport a certain number of players you

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:05.450 
teleport a certain number of players you
could<00:05:01.530> use<00:05:01.710> that<00:05:01.950> and<00:05:04.100> defaults<00:05:05.100> to<00:05:05.160> all

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:05.460 
could use that and defaults to all

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:09.830 
could use that and defaults to all
players<00:05:05.700> via<00:05:06.419> this<00:05:06.630> at<00:05:06.900> a<00:05:06.930> here<00:05:08.660> there's<00:05:09.660> also

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:09.840 
players via this at a here there's also

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.620 
players via this at a here there's also
the<00:05:10.410> at<00:05:10.710> F<00:05:11.190> command<00:05:11.729> which<00:05:11.970> targets<00:05:12.390> players

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:12.630 
the at F command which targets players

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:15.230 
the at F command which targets players
which<00:05:13.110> are<00:05:13.260> the<00:05:13.350> farthest<00:05:13.740> away<00:05:13.860> and<00:05:14.250> then<00:05:15.150> you

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:15.240 
which are the farthest away and then you

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.250 
which are the farthest away and then you
can<00:05:15.360> teleport<00:05:15.690> them<00:05:15.840> to<00:05:15.960> an<00:05:16.080> XYZ<00:05:16.620> location<00:05:17.240> and

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:18.260 
can teleport them to an XYZ location and

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.540 
can teleport them to an XYZ location and
finally<00:05:19.260> guys<00:05:19.410> another<00:05:19.680> new<00:05:19.860> cool<00:05:20.220> feature<00:05:20.430> of

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:20.550 
finally guys another new cool feature of

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:23.450 
finally guys another new cool feature of
the<00:05:20.640> command<00:05:20.910> block<00:05:21.120> is<00:05:21.419> the<00:05:21.720> ability<00:05:21.960> of<00:05:22.460> the

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:23.460 
the command block is the ability of the

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:25.969 
the command block is the ability of the
selectors<00:05:23.970> to<00:05:24.210> have<00:05:24.419> arguments<00:05:24.810> so<00:05:25.650> for

00:05:25.969 --> 00:05:25.979 
selectors to have arguments so for

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:28.130 
selectors to have arguments so for
instance<00:05:26.010> the<00:05:26.490> FP<00:05:26.940> command<00:05:27.360> which<00:05:27.780> selects

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:28.140 
instance the FP command which selects

the<00:05:28.410> nearest<00:05:28.740> player<00:05:29.030> can<00:05:30.030> now<00:05:30.120> have

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:30.360 
the nearest player can now have

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.690 
the nearest player can now have
arguments<00:05:30.780> in<00:05:31.200> these<00:05:31.410> these<00:05:32.160> brackets<00:05:32.430> here

and here first of all it's a /t p so a
little<00:05:51.540> teleport<00:05:52.140> the<00:05:52.950> nearest<00:05:53.280> player<00:05:54.410> of

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:55.410 
little teleport the nearest player of

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:58.550 
little teleport the nearest player of
the<00:05:55.620> cordon<00:05:55.980> at<00:05:56.130> the<00:05:56.640> coordinates<00:05:57.060> for<00:05:57.560> 6850

00:05:58.550 --> 00:05:58.560 
the cordon at the coordinates for 6850

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:00.950 
the cordon at the coordinates for 6850
and<00:05:58.770> within<00:05:59.430> the<00:05:59.670> range<00:05:59.910> of<00:06:00.120> 10<00:06:00.360> blocks<00:06:00.600> of

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:00.960 
and within the range of 10 blocks of

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:05.350 
and within the range of 10 blocks of
those<00:06:01.410> coordinates<00:06:02.690> to<00:06:03.690> the<00:06:04.200> coordinates<00:06:04.860> for

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:05.360 
those coordinates to the coordinates for

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.700 
those coordinates to the coordinates for
6825<00:06:06.360> so<00:06:06.720> let<00:06:06.840> me<00:06:06.930> just<00:06:07.080> demonstrate<00:06:07.200> exactly

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:07.710 
6825 so let me just demonstrate exactly

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:10.490 
6825 so let me just demonstrate exactly
what<00:06:08.190> this<00:06:08.310> will<00:06:08.490> do<00:06:08.610> here<00:06:08.910> so<00:06:09.840> if<00:06:09.990> I<00:06:10.110> come<00:06:10.470> over

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:10.500 
what this will do here so if I come over

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:14.810 
what this will do here so if I come over
here<00:06:11.160> and<00:06:11.810> I<00:06:12.810> first<00:06:13.140> follow<00:06:13.350> me<00:06:13.580> let<00:06:14.580> me<00:06:14.670> go

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:14.820 
here and I first follow me let me go

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:20.330 
here and I first follow me let me go
this<00:06:15.060> way<00:06:16.280> I<00:06:18.350> hit<00:06:19.350> this<00:06:19.530> letter<00:06:19.830> and<00:06:20.010> turn<00:06:20.220> on

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:20.340 
this way I hit this letter and turn on

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:24.140 
this way I hit this letter and turn on
the<00:06:20.370> command<00:06:20.730> block<00:06:20.850> nothing<00:06:21.450> happens<00:06:23.150> same

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:24.150 
the command block nothing happens same

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:27.020 
the command block nothing happens same
thing<00:06:24.390> if<00:06:24.540> I<00:06:24.630> hit<00:06:24.810> it<00:06:24.900> here<00:06:25.610> nothing<00:06:26.610> happens

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:27.030 
thing if I hit it here nothing happens

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:29.090 
thing if I hit it here nothing happens
and<00:06:27.300> that's<00:06:27.450> because<00:06:27.630> my<00:06:28.230> coordinates<00:06:28.770> are

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:29.100 
and that's because my coordinates are

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:33.830 
and that's because my coordinates are
too<00:06:29.430> far<00:06:29.610> away<00:06:29.790> from<00:06:30.140> the<00:06:31.160> 468<00:06:32.600> what<00:06:33.600> was<00:06:33.720> it

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:33.840 
too far away from the 468 what was it

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:39.020 
too far away from the 468 what was it
for<00:06:34.020> 6850<00:06:34.920> but<00:06:35.640> if<00:06:35.730> I<00:06:35.820> go<00:06:36.110> this<00:06:37.110> way<00:06:37.970> you'll<00:06:38.970> see

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:39.030 
for 6850 but if I go this way you'll see

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:43.610 
for 6850 but if I go this way you'll see
i'm<00:06:39.240> now<00:06:39.420> at<00:06:40.130> z's<00:06:41.130> 45<00:06:42.080> so<00:06:43.080> now<00:06:43.200> if<00:06:43.320> I<00:06:43.380> hit<00:06:43.530> this

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:43.620 
i'm now at z's 45 so now if I hit this

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:46.220 
i'm now at z's 45 so now if I hit this
lever<00:06:44.210> it<00:06:45.210> will<00:06:45.360> teleport<00:06:45.600> me<00:06:45.900> to<00:06:45.930> the

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:46.230 
lever it will teleport me to the

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:49.880 
lever it will teleport me to the
coordinates<00:06:46.500> I<00:06:46.770> specified<00:06:48.320> and<00:06:49.320> another

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:49.890 
coordinates I specified and another

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:51.620 
coordinates I specified and another
change<00:06:50.100> in<00:06:50.220> this<00:06:50.340> week<00:06:50.490> snapshot<00:06:51.000> is<00:06:51.180> that

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:51.630 
change in this week snapshot is that

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:53.690 
change in this week snapshot is that
wood<00:06:51.870> blocks<00:06:52.170> now<00:06:52.440> rotate<00:06:52.830> based<00:06:53.070> on<00:06:53.370> what

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:53.700 
wood blocks now rotate based on what

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:54.980 
wood blocks now rotate based on what
face<00:06:53.910> you<00:06:54.120> put<00:06:54.240> it<00:06:54.360> on<00:06:54.450> rather<00:06:54.720> than<00:06:54.840> the

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:54.990 
face you put it on rather than the

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:57.860 
face you put it on rather than the
players<00:06:55.200> position<00:06:55.580> so<00:06:56.580> beforehand<00:06:57.240> when<00:06:57.780> it

00:06:57.860 --> 00:06:57.870 
players position so beforehand when it

00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:00.470 
players position so beforehand when it
was<00:06:57.960> position<00:06:58.410> based<00:06:58.820> placing<00:06:59.820> a<00:06:59.910> block<00:07:00.240> on

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:00.480 
was position based placing a block on

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:02.780 
was position based placing a block on
this<00:07:00.930> face<00:07:01.170> of<00:07:01.530> the<00:07:01.770> sandstone<00:07:02.220> block<00:07:02.460> would

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:02.790 
this face of the sandstone block would

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:04.720 
this face of the sandstone block would
definitely<00:07:03.270> place<00:07:03.450> a<00:07:03.480> wood<00:07:03.840> block<00:07:03.990> vertically

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:04.730 
definitely place a wood block vertically

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:07.130 
definitely place a wood block vertically
but<00:07:05.730> now<00:07:05.910> as<00:07:06.150> you<00:07:06.270> can<00:07:06.360> see<00:07:06.420> it<00:07:06.720> places<00:07:07.080> it

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:07.140 
but now as you can see it places it

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:10.580 
but now as you can see it places it
horizontally<00:07:08.900> so<00:07:09.900> yeah<00:07:10.110> the<00:07:10.290> place<00:07:10.560> is

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:10.590 
horizontally so yeah the place is

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:12.500 
horizontally so yeah the place is
horizontally<00:07:11.190> there<00:07:11.340> too<00:07:11.640> but<00:07:12.120> if<00:07:12.180> we<00:07:12.240> place

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:12.510 
horizontally there too but if we place

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:15.950 
horizontally there too but if we place
it<00:07:12.540> on<00:07:12.870> the<00:07:12.900> bottom<00:07:13.170> side<00:07:13.500> here<00:07:14.160> it<00:07:14.930> should<00:07:15.930> be

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:15.960 
it on the bottom side here it should be

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:18.290 
it on the bottom side here it should be
