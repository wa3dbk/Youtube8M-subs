00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:07.620
 and good to all and welcome to a 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.940
 new head- to- head race 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.580
 and about the grand prize of britain 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.740
 of formula 1 a career that has been born 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.540
 right after the accident of kimi 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.400
 raikkonen that luckily he did not go to 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.240
 older by those reflexes that had mass 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.240
 for once in your life 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.790
 dodge the king's car with him and we've 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:28.220
 said the older ones what with the 

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:31.400
 sacred not only the insult and 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:34.220
 after an hour of waiting for 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:36.350
 they will repair the guardrail 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:37.730
 resumed the race and we met that 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:41.150
 news of five seconds of 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:43.670
 penalty for use because it had 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:45.140
 in advance of your drawer but 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.780
 when final intended because he 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.309
 tried to back down and surely 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:53.030
 because as he said at the end of the race 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:54.190
 that did not see his dorsal well to say it 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.289
 so in 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.730
 in that position that corresponds and 

00:00:56.289 --> 00:01:02.110
 thought it was a later 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.110
 has been a penalty is excessive 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:06.400
 maybe those five seconds in the part 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.920
 end of the race they would have come 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.800
 pretty good but good nothing can be 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.690
 do 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:16.010
 and well the race started dominating the 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:20.480
 roberts in these last races 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:23.540
 meanwhile on Saturdays and today he had bad 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:25.880
 luck so far the mercedes are 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.560
 having enough problems of 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.050
 reliability 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.530
 at the moment they are alternating 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:34.260
 both pilots 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.479
 hamilton saves a little the last 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:38.159
 racing but now also with this 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.380
 problem you experienced Rosberg 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.479
 they put back to four points so 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.369
 we are again like at the beginning and 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.900
 good before here at the end of the season 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.300
 while these are alternating 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:51.030
 problems maybe we see equality but 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:53.610
 how they focus on 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.520
 at the end of the championship it is going to 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:02:00.130
 distance and good counting on that 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.880
 last race that will be 50 points 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:05.159
 double uve 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.869
 we will see we will see why they have any of 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.929
 the two and are matched by lehman 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:12.750
 this last race you can decide the 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:15.569
 world may be the last in abu dhabi 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.480
 and good on the other hand valtteri bottas 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:20.790
 second position at the end is over 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:23.280
 Finnish great race driver 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.410
 departure very back touched more to alonso 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.940
 raikkonen and in the end has gone all the 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.190
 race with shot and has managed to stay 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:32.220
 in that second place ricciardo that 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:34.500
 he started eighth and finished third of 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.440
 new the best red bull vettel came out 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.840
 second and it's over 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:41.480
 so I cast again has 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:44.080
 again overcome fourth has been 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.080
 jenson button 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:49.959
 good on your part and good mclaren for 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:52.599
 the least saying is a bit in your house 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:55.209
 because I was super drawing the 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:57.519
 last races I think here has 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:58.810
 refloated a bit though perhaps with the 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:01.840
 peculiarities that I had the career 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:02.569
 has been reaching that position but what 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.810
 is 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:07.180
 I would have also been much more 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.430
 behind 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.769
 fifth position for vettel and sixth 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:14.829
 alonso the two who have given us or 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:17.500
 a final battle wand in the last 

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:19.359
 third of career and good in the end it has 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.620
 decided by b would have to alonso then 

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:22.870
 has recognized at the end of the race 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.659
 that has not been even battle because he 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:28.040
 I was trying to hold on track and 

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:31.849
 that period the team well 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:33.439
 do not be fast in the corners because 

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:36.109
 had a problem with the rear wing 

00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:38.359
 and also had some said a problem 

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:41.780
 in batteries or so even two 

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:43.159
 stop laps before Vettel 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.680
 I had asked on the radio that if 

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:47.150
 I left because I had enough 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.760
 problems and I was also saving 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:52.510
 gasoline so too much says to the 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:55.670
 finish the race that he has endured 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:57.330
 and well I repeat you from outside we have 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.580
 seen a battalion 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:02.820
 and good even though it was not a 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:04.380
 battle as such as Alonso said 

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:06.690
 for the spectators have been quite 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:09.540
 nice and good then you have seen 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:11.280
 clearly that when it has happened to the 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.680
 she has lost a lot of the rhythm because she 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:16.410
 I wanted to keep the mechanics facing the 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:19.530
 end of the race seventh position 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:23.640
 for magnus in eighth hÃ¼lkenberg ninth 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:25.620
 and tenth the bull rosso and dibbern and the 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:28.650
 two of the point is pretty good there 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:30.570
 strained between the two indian force and 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:32.400
 Well it has been a race as I have 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:36.240
 Pretty peculiar saying 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:38.070
 Alonso has practically occupied 50% 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:40.200
 of the relay of the race since 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:41.850
 has been the one that has given more show 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:44.240
 with that series of overtaking 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:44.240
 Start 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:50.590
 nice battle with competitions in which 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:52.450
 sparks have jumped and good almost always 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:54.390
 to the breath the show to the 

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:56.590
 race since for the part of above 

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:59.350
 the mercedes continue to dominate 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:01.810
 amply and we'll see in the next 

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:06.100
 great prize that is in germany 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:08.470
 who falls that luck if Rosberg 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:10.450
 hamilton because if we see a battle 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:11.620
 between the two without problems so nothing 

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:14.580
 I hope you liked the movie one 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:14.580
 greeting and until next time 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.040
 O well
