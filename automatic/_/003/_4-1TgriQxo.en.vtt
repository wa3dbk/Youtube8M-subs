00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:15.000
 Good day to you all 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.820
 Hadith Satan and I want to say in advance 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.750
 guys if you are an experienced player or more 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.060
 less experienced player 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.820
 there this video will simply be uninteresting 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.539
 so do not kill your time 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.300
 watched 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.220
 what is this movie about slang and 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.869
 shorthand for clash of clans why 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.180
 he decided to gash and at work 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.730
 met a man who too 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.340
 playing taste punch texas and when i 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.950
 tried to talk to him about 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.629
 development all i burned all sangi 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.450
 cuts he just didn't understand them 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.730
 warmed it that this is some kind of why but 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:51.570
 not hanging out in the global little hanging out in 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:54.270
 chat clan so as something decided 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.280
 gash this video start with the fact that 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.199
 initially there was no end to the game 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.210
 Russian language as such, even say 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.579
 moreover he was not even Russian 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.070
 keyboards so we wrote translit 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.500
 and therefore almost all cuts 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:11.040
 send us exactly from English 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.770
 Well let's start the most important hope nothing 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.979
 I do not forget in the first place and that 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:21.060
 so this is the town hall respectively 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:24.960
 further contrast he is like he is cc all 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:27.390
 it is differently called which rd also 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.820
 you calls more from because of the abbreviated 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.270
 because of the abbreviated first letters air 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.119
 defense 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.369
 from also call it anti-aircraft 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:38.939
 defense well wizard is understandable wizard 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:42.930
 cannon cannon the so-called archery tower 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:46.470
 so will we have a tower to improve the barracks 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:49.830
 understandable dark huts understood 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:55.380
 About your resources, gold is it 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:58.020

 bonfire or camp is simply reduced 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:14.070
 sewer mines are also often called 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:18.300
 by mines so you can often hear 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:21.840
 if you write mine probably can 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:24.570
 have and elixir collector also call 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.930

 You migrated to the Russian language and the apartment 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:16.230
