beat<00:03:39.300> by<00:03:40.019> that<00:03:41.060> so<00:03:42.060> I'm<00:03:42.180> gonna<00:03:42.300> play<00:03:42.510> it<00:03:42.600> all

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
beat by that so I'm gonna play it all

00:03:42.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
beat by that so I'm gonna play it all
again

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:08.710 

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:12.090 

then<00:04:09.710> that<00:04:10.250> just<00:04:10.490> repeats<00:04:10.640> one<00:04:11.450> octave<00:04:11.780> lower

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:12.100 
then that just repeats one octave lower

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:14.230 
then that just repeats one octave lower
all<00:04:13.100> that<00:04:13.310> just<00:04:13.490> repeats<00:04:13.610> an<00:04:13.910> octave<00:04:14.210> lower

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:14.240 
all that just repeats an octave lower

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:18.760 
all that just repeats an octave lower
down<00:04:14.630> here<00:04:15.370> think<00:04:16.370> that<00:04:16.550> is<00:04:17.650> raining<00:04:18.650> through

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:18.770 
down here think that is raining through

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:21.699 
down here think that is raining through
the<00:04:18.920> camera<00:04:19.280> so<00:04:19.820> just<00:04:20.300> just<00:04:21.080> repeat<00:04:21.380> that<00:04:21.410> bit

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:21.709 
the camera so just just repeat that bit

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:23.980 
the camera so just just repeat that bit
an<00:04:21.800> octave<00:04:22.070> lower<00:04:22.300> anyway<00:04:23.300> that's<00:04:23.630> the<00:04:23.810> first

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:23.990 
an octave lower anyway that's the first

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:27.430 
an octave lower anyway that's the first
part<00:04:24.290> the<00:04:24.530> intro<00:04:24.800> and<00:04:25.070> the<00:04:25.160> verses<00:04:25.670> so<00:04:26.440> learn
