hard shell case and it protects it way

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.580 
hard shell case and it protects it way
better<00:01:36.920> now<00:01:37.820> portability<00:01:38.509> why's<00:01:38.720> that<00:01:38.750> beats

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
better now portability why's that beats

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:41.469 
better now portability why's that beats
so<00:01:40.009> is<00:01:40.220> win<00:01:40.430> because<00:01:40.729> they're<00:01:40.940> just<00:01:41.180> a<00:01:41.299> lot

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 
so is win because they're just a lot

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:45.160 
so is win because they're just a lot
more<00:01:41.630> compact<00:01:42.140> and<00:01:42.380> smaller<00:01:43.360> ok<00:01:44.360> now<00:01:44.539> the

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
more compact and smaller ok now the

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.630 
more compact and smaller ok now the
sound<00:01:45.470> isolation<00:01:46.720> yeah<00:01:47.720> these<00:01:48.190> beats<00:01:49.190> they
