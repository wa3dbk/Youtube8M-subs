and put that one in my pocket as well
and<00:03:27.870> we<00:03:28.020> have<00:03:28.170> one<00:03:28.470> more<00:03:28.710> here<00:03:29.070> to<00:03:29.100> contend

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
and we have one more here to contend

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:43.390 
and we have one more here to contend
with

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:49.000 

that's<00:03:44.060> in<00:03:44.299> my<00:03:44.450> pocket<00:03:47.470> once<00:03:48.470> we<00:03:48.650> got<00:03:48.769> this

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 
that's in my pocket once we got this

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:50.890 
that's in my pocket once we got this
bracket<00:03:49.430> loose<00:03:49.640> it's<00:03:50.209> going<00:03:50.360> to<00:03:50.420> allow<00:03:50.569> us<00:03:50.599> to

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
bracket loose it's going to allow us to

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.199 
bracket loose it's going to allow us to
manipulate<00:03:50.989> these<00:03:51.650> cables<00:03:52.190> so<00:03:52.819> we<00:03:52.909> can<00:03:53.030> gain

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:53.209 
manipulate these cables so we can gain

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:55.660 
manipulate these cables so we can gain
access<00:03:53.390> to<00:03:53.720> the<00:03:53.959> clips<00:03:54.379> on<00:03:54.650> the<00:03:55.129> back<00:03:55.340> of<00:03:55.580> the
