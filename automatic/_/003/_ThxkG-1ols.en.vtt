00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:04.110
 so now on the subject we want 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.300
 of course, the hottest boxes 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:09.740
 actually look at the biggest freaks 

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:12.580
 right or wrong 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:12.580
 kassel on 

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:30.980
 the 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:38.420
 more powerful a monstertruck heard of 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:40.460
 alone in the peace category because 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:43.040
 he like a magnet also such special 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:45.019
 how to pull them by the way of the grave 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.329
 digger here the right one known 

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:50.030
 celebrity in the us since ages 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:51.769
 For decades he has been in the monster truck 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.050
 challenges with doing the right gold 

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:55.489
 championships and this monster truck 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.829
 paper of the grave digger is standing there behind 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:59.809
 Even the look ford are right stars 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:01.729
 because they are personified 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:03.589
 drivers almost no matter these cars 

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:04.879
 class against each other 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:07.119
 bread and games but you know that 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:07.119
 mean 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.610
 look at me purple blue green we goldener 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.410
 These colors can all be 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.790
 choose for this gorgeous car and 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:19.650
 that's a nice example of that 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.240
 you really put a car in everything 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.910
 and run can put whatever you want to 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.810
 example here is a convenient 26 back 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:26.850
 You can also go over the Cantine 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.530
 you do not even notice ne and when we go in 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.600
 we are sure we can find 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.740
 even usb connection and cupholder that 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.780
 best thing is when you complete the 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.340
 filling in an extra list then you get 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.590
 here is a must say let such furniture 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.630
 and which you also use as a car jack 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.890
 no present by the way very much for the 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.660
 lodge a small one for christmas 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.880
 Attention would be enough 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:46.260
 small monster truck that not only fits 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:53.880
 the nursery but also desired titles 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:55.440
 are you with 40,000 down at Vienna that 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.700
 everything was a bit too weak-breasted 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.840
 what we have seen so far has 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.800
 probably right here for that 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.270
 Please 36 liters capacity 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:06.420
 composed of four chrysler hemmi 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.010
 big block in total laps 10,000 ps 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.720
 probably the most ps we do 

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:11.040
 get together here and actually 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.690
 this is the right choice for you 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:14.730
 globalized farmers of today 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.380
 there you can go to 5 hectares big 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.690
 order potato field in five minutes 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.350
 and maybe more 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.700
 Ministry of Agriculture you ask 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.060
 are definite subsidies only has 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.060
 everyone what about it 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.900
 Here there stands here they come, therefore, 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:34.460
 and watch the first car and camaro 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:37.470
 Incidentally, the 34-inch wheels 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:39.300
 the question is how much car is this 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.160
 actually the thing can drive up and 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.930
 if how fast the manufacturer of the 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:46.050
 By the way , he set up the wall 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.520
 say yes to 55 miles fast and 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:50.190
 you can also steer well and 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.780
 But so we are the turning circle so and 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.910
 pokÃ©mon summer closer to i believe 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:56.630
 rather that when shopping already apart 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:59.540
 falls here 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:01.280
 look at her 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.870
 A work too shock than that 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.659
 necessarily and here it looks rather than 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.340
 if the mother with the fingernail naked 

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:09.069
 because it has gone over it and so 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.209
 gap dimensions and it is actually a 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:12.590
 a little bit of fear that stinks 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:20.659
 falling apart actually he is the 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:22.579
 first from box to 34 euros also the 

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:24.379
 Car should actually be in my peace 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:25.579
 list but I do not dare that 

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:27.409
 to call a lot anyway because somehow 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:37.609
 the hottest thing I've seen so far 

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:40.069
 and look what has the insulation 40th 

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:41.329
 man too and if it is too loud 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:43.599
 then you can also the whole 

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:45.889
 communicate world 

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:48.859
 the most beautiful for the 

00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:51.079
 romantic beautiful music by shrek 

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:52.430
 So the cassettes mold down like that 

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:54.560
 you can visit us in germany europe 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:56.769
 do you know the usa was completely exec 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:59.659
 the keyword simply described her here 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:02.599
 In the middle I should only measured weeks 

00:03:59.659 --> 00:04:04.609
 on what you have seen so far 

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:05.389
 you almost bother my son car everybody 

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:07.970
 not at all 

00:04:05.389 --> 00:04:09.409
 but also this car is a flight why 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:11.000
 because in the middle of the printer 

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:12.889
 pulled out now does not come out 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.049
 his boring inkjet printer 

00:04:12.889 --> 00:04:17.419
 here came here it is his thick 

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:20.180
 Take out plastic cubes and build from them 

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:21.799
 just such a nice car together 440 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.150
 For hours and hours this falls out of the 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:25.070
 Printer just out lotter again 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:27.409
 a stroke and everything is assembled 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:29.810
 big disadvantage should be on the car 

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:32.150
 Of course that's an ink cartridge 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:33.110
 this always extremely expensive and wise 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:35.030
 modern printers have the most 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:36.860
 Manufacturer warranty fixed to this 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:39.440
 small computer chips that they say 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:43.000
 here 10,000 expressly broken and then 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:43.000
 If you buy such a big broker 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:50.639
 What kind of car is it you know exactly 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:52.979
 I also write there directly 

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:54.300
 seen and at this pace is a for 

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:57.539
 always clean up 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:05:00.120
 it was with the sat so customized 

00:04:57.539 --> 00:05:04.099
 was discreetly reworked that 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:06.360
 which are actually useful we have 

00:05:04.099 --> 00:05:07.169
 always the when impractical but is 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.629
 not like this 

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:11.039
 I can brake my brakes directly like that 

00:05:09.629 --> 00:05:12.720
 change or even a dead cat 

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:14.729
 out of there without bringing again to remove 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:17.280
 so you have to say it is practical 

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:18.690
 also with the luggage compartment one has exactly the same 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:20.909
 Consumers laughed over the front 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:21.990
 Report here, for example, you can see it 

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:24.120
 can load the whole lot 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:25.919
 handwritten reporters are whole 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:28.069
 made that guests weekend purchases 

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:32.840
 just pure again had to, you can now 

00:05:28.069 --> 00:05:32.840
 at home directly 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:37.380
 Here, too, one sees consistently that became 

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:39.240
 omitted what you do not need 

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:40.850
 the third slices of the surface 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:43.380
 also mean a third less 

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:46.350
 washing washes and also a third 

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:48.630
 less fish like you on this vehicle 

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:50.550
 with us in this rundgang also like 

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:52.289
 ours the category speaks 

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:54.460
 everything works 

00:05:52.289 --> 00:05:58.110
 because how can I find 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:58.110
 the cars do a lot together
