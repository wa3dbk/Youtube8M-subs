having it overreact
you<00:03:54.090> can<00:03:54.209> see<00:03:54.329> this<00:03:54.509> ball<00:03:54.720> is<00:03:54.870> starting<00:03:55.109> to

00:03:55.339 --> 00:03:55.349 
you can see this ball is starting to

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:57.319 
you can see this ball is starting to
react<00:03:55.680> at<00:03:55.949> the<00:03:56.040> end<00:03:56.220> of<00:03:56.489> the<00:03:56.579> first<00:03:56.939> cheater

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:57.329 
react at the end of the first cheater

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:00.199 
react at the end of the first cheater
yeah<00:03:57.780> on<00:03:58.290> Brunswick<00:03:58.739> Prineville<00:03:59.220> lanes<00:03:59.430> so

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
yeah on Brunswick Prineville lanes so

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:02.749 
yeah on Brunswick Prineville lanes so
it's<00:04:00.449> actually<00:04:01.079> where<00:04:01.919> the<00:04:02.069> oil<00:04:02.220> we<00:04:02.430> have<00:04:02.579> on

00:04:02.749 --> 00:04:02.759 
it's actually where the oil we have on

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:04.520 
it's actually where the oil we have on
this<00:04:02.879> it's<00:04:03.209> actually<00:04:03.449> starting<00:04:03.870> to<00:04:04.139> roll<00:04:04.319> up

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
this it's actually starting to roll up

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.439 
this it's actually starting to roll up
just<00:04:04.560> before<00:04:04.949> the<00:04:05.220> end<00:04:05.459> of<00:04:05.519> the<00:04:05.609> batter<00:04:05.849> so<00:04:06.389> you

00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:06.449 
just before the end of the batter so you

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:08.599 
just before the end of the batter so you
can<00:04:06.629> tell<00:04:06.840> exactly<00:04:07.079> how<00:04:07.439> smooth<00:04:08.400> it<00:04:08.519> is

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:08.609 
can tell exactly how smooth it is

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:11.929 
can tell exactly how smooth it is
obviously<00:04:09.269> and<00:04:09.599> yeah<00:04:10.430> which<00:04:11.430> I'll<00:04:11.579> help<00:04:11.759> you

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:13.919 
figure out how long the pattern is and

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:17.270 
figure out how long the pattern is and
where<00:04:14.099> you<00:04:14.189> need<00:04:14.280> to<00:04:14.400> play<00:04:16.009> yeah<00:04:17.009> and<00:04:17.130> it'll

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
much sometimes you get to angular off

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:21.979 
much sometimes you get to angular off
there

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
there

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:25.520

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430 
to the roll roll part and then into the

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:50.510 
to the roll roll part and then into the
hook<00:04:47.639> you<00:04:48.330> can<00:04:48.539> see<00:04:48.900> that<00:04:49.410> it's<00:04:49.590> a<00:04:49.830> very<00:04:49.889> strong

hook you can see that it's a very strong
forward<00:04:51.030> motion<00:04:51.509> it's<00:04:52.169> not<00:04:52.349> giving<00:04:52.680> up<00:04:52.770> any

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:52.919 
forward motion it's not giving up any

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:55.820 
forward motion it's not giving up any
carry<00:04:53.220> it's<00:04:53.430> not<00:04:53.550> rolling<00:04:53.729> out<00:04:53.970> yeah<00:04:54.710> you<00:04:55.710> get

carry it's not rolling out yeah you get
to<00:04:55.979> play<00:04:56.190> really<00:04:56.490> off<00:04:56.759> the<00:04:56.789> back<00:04:57.060> of<00:04:57.090> the<00:04:57.210> ball

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 
to play really off the back of the ball

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.320 
to play really off the back of the ball
and<00:04:57.509> get<00:04:57.599> it<00:04:57.630> forward<00:04:58.050> roll<00:04:58.849> yeah<00:04:59.849> now<00:05:00.120> that's

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 
and get it forward roll yeah now that's

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:01.520 
and get it forward roll yeah now that's
you<00:05:00.599> can<00:05:00.720> see<00:05:00.870> there<00:05:01.020> I<00:05:01.050> put<00:05:01.229> a<00:05:01.289> little<00:05:01.440> bit

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:01.530 
you can see there I put a little bit

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:03.350 
you can see there I put a little bit
farther<00:05:01.740> off<00:05:01.949> the<00:05:02.069> side<00:05:02.250> of<00:05:02.280> it<00:05:02.520> trying<00:05:03.180> to<00:05:03.270> get

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:03.360 
farther off the side of it trying to get

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.420 
farther off the side of it trying to get
old<00:05:03.479> stronger<00:05:03.780> reaction<00:05:03.900> yep<00:05:04.560> one<00:05:05.280> of<00:05:05.340> the

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:05.430 
old stronger reaction yep one of the

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:06.770 
old stronger reaction yep one of the
things<00:05:05.550> I<00:05:05.669> liked<00:05:05.940> as<00:05:06.090> I'm<00:05:06.240> getting<00:05:06.330> ready<00:05:06.599> for

off<00:05:11.430> the<00:05:11.460> side<00:05:11.789> creating<00:05:12.599> angle<00:05:13.080> or<00:05:13.380> cutting

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:13.650 
off the side creating angle or cutting

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:16.159 
off the side creating angle or cutting
down<00:05:13.800> angle<00:05:14.069> and<00:05:14.400> this<00:05:14.970> ball<00:05:15.210> very<00:05:15.840> easily

00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:16.169 
down angle and this ball very easily

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:18.140 
down angle and this ball very easily
allowed<00:05:16.590> me<00:05:16.740> to<00:05:16.770> switch<00:05:17.039> between<00:05:17.280> without<00:05:17.699> Inc

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:18.150
