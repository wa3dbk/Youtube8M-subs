look at quite frankly one of the most

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.020 
look at quite frankly one of the most
important<00:00:07.620> systems<00:00:08.040> that<00:00:08.220> you<00:00:08.280> can<00:00:08.309> find<00:00:08.760> in

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
important systems that you can find in

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:27.580 
important systems that you can find in
any<00:00:09.599> car<00:00:09.929> it's<00:00:10.559> the<00:00:10.710> air<00:00:10.860> conditioning<00:00:10.889> system

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:27.590 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:29.599 

I'm<00:00:28.590> actually<00:00:28.769> going<00:00:28.980> to<00:00:29.070> attempt<00:00:29.279> to<00:00:29.310> explain

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
I'm actually going to attempt to explain

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.460 
I'm actually going to attempt to explain
how<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:29.939> air<00:00:30.179> conditioning<00:00:30.570> system<00:00:30.869> works<00:00:31.109> by

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
how the air conditioning system works by

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.860 
how the air conditioning system works by
using<00:00:31.500> one<00:00:31.949> of<00:00:31.980> these<00:00:32.130> body<00:00:32.910> sprays<00:00:33.270> okay<00:00:33.600> no

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
using one of these body sprays okay no

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.049 
using one of these body sprays okay no
it's<00:00:34.079> not<00:00:34.140> a<00:00:34.260> commercial<00:00:34.500> for<00:00:35.059> Casablanca

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
it's not a commercial for Casablanca

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.880 
it's not a commercial for Casablanca
whom<00:00:36.360> nothing<00:00:36.660> like<00:00:36.899> that<00:00:37.050> if<00:00:37.350> you<00:00:37.649> were<00:00:37.770> to

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
whom nothing like that if you were to

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.970 
whom nothing like that if you were to
take<00:00:38.129> a<00:00:38.600> compressed<00:00:39.600> or<00:00:40.050> rather<00:00:40.230> a<00:00:40.350> can<00:00:40.680> of

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
take a compressed or rather a can of

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.310 
take a compressed or rather a can of
liquid<00:00:41.670> spray<00:00:41.969> like<00:00:42.420> this<00:00:42.600> and<00:00:42.840> if<00:00:43.200> you're

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
liquid spray like this and if you're

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.590 
liquid spray like this and if you're
gonna<00:00:43.410> spray<00:00:43.649> it<00:00:43.739> out<00:00:43.890> all<00:00:44.820> right<00:00:44.879> and<00:00:45.360> just

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
gonna spray it out all right and just

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.569 
gonna spray it out all right and just
leave<00:00:45.750> it<00:00:45.840> there<00:00:46.020> as<00:00:46.200> you<00:00:46.800> can<00:00:46.920> see<00:00:47.039> all<00:00:47.250> the

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
leave it there as you can see all the

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.130 
leave it there as you can see all the
liquid<00:00:47.910> over<00:00:48.120> here<00:00:48.300> is<00:00:48.420> not<00:00:48.539> changing<00:00:48.989> to<00:00:49.050> a

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
liquid over here is not changing to a

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:49.639 
liquid over here is not changing to a
guess

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
guess

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.090 
guess
alright<00:00:49.950> it's<00:00:50.280> a<00:00:50.370> new<00:00:50.640> business<00:00:51.090> and<00:00:51.920> as<00:00:52.920> the

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
alright it's a new business and as the

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.520 
alright it's a new business and as the
liquid<00:00:53.460> changes<00:00:53.789> into<00:00:54.360> a<00:00:54.390> gas<00:00:54.719> and<00:00:55.079> it<00:00:55.289> leaves

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
liquid changes into a gas and it leaves

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.229 
liquid changes into a gas and it leaves
the<00:00:55.739> can<00:00:55.949> you<00:00:56.100> got<00:00:56.250> to<00:00:56.370> touch<00:00:56.520> this<00:00:56.699> you<00:00:57.090> can

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
the can you got to touch this you can

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.450 
the can you got to touch this you can
feel<00:00:57.420> it's<00:00:57.870> really<00:00:58.320> really<00:00:58.649> cool<00:00:58.920> and<00:00:59.160> it's

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
feel it's really really cool and it's

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:00.979 
feel it's really really cool and it's
pretty<00:00:59.670> much<00:00:59.789> how<00:00:59.850> a<00:01:00.390> car<00:01:00.780> air<00:01:00.960> conditioning

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
pretty much how a car air conditioning

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.959 
pretty much how a car air conditioning
system<00:01:01.710> looks<00:01:01.890> actually<00:01:02.399> I'm<00:01:02.609> killing<00:01:02.850> two

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
system looks actually I'm killing two

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:03.680 
system looks actually I'm killing two
birds<00:01:03.000> with<00:01:03.239> one<00:01:03.329> stone

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
birds with one stone

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.299 
birds with one stone
I'm<00:01:04.170> explaining<00:01:04.500> to<00:01:04.680> you<00:01:04.769> how<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:05.010> air

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
I'm explaining to you how the air

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.730 
I'm explaining to you how the air
conditioning<00:01:05.760> system<00:01:05.850> works<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:06.500> this<00:01:07.500> place

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
conditioning system works and this place

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.039 
conditioning system works and this place
stinks

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:09.049 
stinks

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:11.750 
stinks
so<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.229> air<00:01:10.409> conditioning<00:01:10.920> system<00:01:11.310> is<00:01:11.520> pretty

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
so the air conditioning system is pretty

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.550 
so the air conditioning system is pretty
much<00:01:11.909> a<00:01:12.119> closed<00:01:12.570> system<00:01:13.229> so<00:01:13.260> I'm<00:01:13.409> going<00:01:13.530> to

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
much a closed system so I'm going to

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.289 
much a closed system so I'm going to
start<00:01:13.770> off<00:01:13.830> with<00:01:14.070> this<00:01:14.250> thing<00:01:14.520> right<00:01:14.549> this<00:01:15.030> is

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
start off with this thing right this is

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.330 
start off with this thing right this is
the<00:01:15.479> compressor<00:01:16.020> this<00:01:16.560> is<00:01:16.710> what<00:01:16.860> got<00:01:17.040> blown

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
the compressor this is what got blown

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.969 
the compressor this is what got blown
and<00:01:17.640> we<00:01:17.820> just<00:01:18.030> took<00:01:18.090> this<00:01:18.240> out<00:01:18.420> of<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.960> of<00:01:19.470> the

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
and we just took this out of the of the

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.640 
and we just took this out of the of the
lenser<00:01:20.310> and<00:01:20.659> of<00:01:21.659> course<00:01:21.869> as<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.170> name<00:01:22.200> speaks

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
lenser and of course as the name speaks

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:23.270 
lenser and of course as the name speaks
for<00:01:22.740> itself

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
for itself

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.030 
for itself
it's<00:01:23.430> job<00:01:23.759> is<00:01:23.939> to<00:01:24.000> compress<00:01:24.540> your<00:01:25.439> refrigerant

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
it's job is to compress your refrigerant

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.210 
it's job is to compress your refrigerant
from<00:01:26.490> a<00:01:26.759> low<00:01:27.270> pressure<00:01:27.540> placing<00:01:28.259> state<00:01:28.560> to<00:01:29.009> a

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
from a low pressure placing state to a

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.510 
from a low pressure placing state to a
high<00:01:29.579> pressure<00:01:29.909> liquid<00:01:30.540> state<00:01:31.159> now<00:01:32.159> once<00:01:32.340> it's

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
high pressure liquid state now once it's

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.890 
high pressure liquid state now once it's
a<00:01:32.579> high<00:01:32.700> pressure<00:01:32.939> liquid<00:01:33.150> it's<00:01:33.509> gonna<00:01:33.720> get

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
a high pressure liquid it's gonna get

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.440 
a high pressure liquid it's gonna get
fed<00:01:34.200> through<00:01:34.560> this<00:01:34.979> thing<00:01:35.310> now<00:01:35.520> this<00:01:35.790> is<00:01:36.060> what

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
fed through this thing now this is what

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.080 
fed through this thing now this is what
we<00:01:36.630> call<00:01:36.900> a<00:01:37.220> condenser<00:01:38.220> and<00:01:38.400> you<00:01:38.790> can<00:01:38.970> usually

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
we call a condenser and you can usually

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.940 
we call a condenser and you can usually
find<00:01:39.240> this<00:01:39.570> at<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:40.140> front<00:01:40.439> of<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.740> car

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
find this at the front of the car

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.219 
find this at the front of the car
together<00:01:41.310> with<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:42.180> radiator<00:01:42.540> right<00:01:42.990> now

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
together with the radiator right now

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.810 
together with the radiator right now
sometimes<00:01:43.680> it's<00:01:43.890> got<00:01:44.009> a<00:01:44.040> fan<00:01:44.280> of<00:01:44.430> its<00:01:44.579> own

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
sometimes it's got a fan of its own

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.300 
sometimes it's got a fan of its own
sometimes<00:01:45.329> it's<00:01:45.810> sharing<00:01:46.350> a<00:01:46.470> fan<00:01:46.740> with<00:01:47.220> the

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
sometimes it's sharing a fan with the

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.069 
sometimes it's sharing a fan with the
radiator<00:01:47.579> that<00:01:48.060> depends<00:01:48.390> on<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.720> model<00:01:48.869> of

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
radiator that depends on the model of

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.289 
radiator that depends on the model of
your<00:01:49.110> car<00:01:49.229> now<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:49.890> job<00:01:50.220> of<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.850> condenser<00:01:51.090> is

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
your car now the job of the condenser is

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.270 
your car now the job of the condenser is
to<00:01:51.570> reduce<00:01:51.930> the<00:01:52.110> temperature<00:01:52.409> of<00:01:52.920> the

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
to reduce the temperature of the

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.149 
to reduce the temperature of the
refrigerant<00:01:53.729> after<00:01:54.659> it<00:01:55.350> has<00:01:55.500> left<00:01:55.710> the

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
refrigerant after it has left the

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.249 
refrigerant after it has left the
condenser<00:01:56.939> it<00:01:57.240> goes<00:01:57.420> through<00:01:57.600> a<00:01:57.630> dryer<00:01:57.930> the

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
condenser it goes through a dryer the

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.080 
condenser it goes through a dryer the
receiver<00:01:58.649> dryer<00:01:58.890> okay<00:01:59.159> that's<00:01:59.369> really<00:01:59.820> deep

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
receiver dryer okay that's really deep

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.420 
receiver dryer okay that's really deep
inside<00:02:00.390> so<00:02:01.350> I<00:02:01.380> can<00:02:01.920> show<00:02:02.040> it<00:02:02.100> to<00:02:02.189> you<00:02:02.280> but<00:02:02.369> I

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
inside so I can show it to you but I

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.789 
inside so I can show it to you but I
have<00:02:02.670> a<00:02:02.700> sample<00:02:03.090> of<00:02:03.420> a<00:02:03.840> receiver<00:02:04.200> dryer<00:02:04.530> and

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
have a sample of a receiver dryer and

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.200 
have a sample of a receiver dryer and
this<00:02:04.890> is<00:02:05.070> kind<00:02:05.280> of<00:02:05.310> what<00:02:05.490> it<00:02:05.579> looks<00:02:05.790> like<00:02:05.939> right

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
this is kind of what it looks like right

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.900 
this is kind of what it looks like right
so<00:02:06.719> basically<00:02:06.990> the<00:02:07.380> job<00:02:07.710> of<00:02:07.890> this<00:02:08.160> little

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
so basically the job of this little

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.880 
so basically the job of this little
buddy<00:02:09.119> over<00:02:09.270> here<00:02:09.390> is<00:02:09.750> to<00:02:10.560> get<00:02:10.709> the

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
buddy over here is to get the

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.220 
buddy over here is to get the
refrigerant<00:02:11.459> to<00:02:11.580> flow<00:02:11.610> through<00:02:12.180> it<00:02:12.330> but<00:02:12.930> at

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
refrigerant to flow through it but at

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.770 
refrigerant to flow through it but at
the<00:02:13.319> same<00:02:13.500> time

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
the same time

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.630 
the same time
is<00:02:13.840> gonna<00:02:13.990> remove<00:02:14.350> any<00:02:14.620> moisture<00:02:14.830> after<00:02:15.520> the

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
is gonna remove any moisture after the

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.550 
is gonna remove any moisture after the
high<00:02:15.910> pressure<00:02:16.209> refrigerant<00:02:16.480> comes<00:02:17.080> out<00:02:17.350> of

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
high pressure refrigerant comes out of

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.180 
high pressure refrigerant comes out of
the<00:02:18.130> receiver<00:02:18.640> drier<00:02:18.790> it's<00:02:19.360> gonna<00:02:19.660> be<00:02:19.810> forced

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
the receiver drier it's gonna be forced

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.800 
the receiver drier it's gonna be forced
right<00:02:21.190> out<00:02:21.370> of<00:02:21.520> the<00:02:21.610> engine<00:02:21.940> being<00:02:22.180> underneath

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
right out of the engine being underneath

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.470 
right out of the engine being underneath
your<00:02:23.590> dashboard<00:02:24.130> and<00:02:24.280> through<00:02:24.850> one<00:02:25.240> of<00:02:25.330> these

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
your dashboard and through one of these

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.960 
your dashboard and through one of these
this<00:02:25.780> is<00:02:25.930> what<00:02:26.110> we<00:02:26.200> call<00:02:26.440> the<00:02:27.040> cooling<00:02:27.670> coil

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
this is what we call the cooling coil

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.330 
this is what we call the cooling coil
okay<00:02:28.060> now<00:02:28.720> just<00:02:29.140> like<00:02:29.319> how<00:02:29.500> I<00:02:29.680> was<00:02:29.920> spraying

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
okay now just like how I was spraying

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.430 
okay now just like how I was spraying
the<00:02:30.459> different<00:02:31.000> is<00:02:31.180> now<00:02:31.330> the<00:02:31.900> refrigerant<00:02:32.350> is

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
the different is now the refrigerant is

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.160 
the different is now the refrigerant is
gonna<00:02:32.620> get<00:02:32.739> sprayed<00:02:33.250> into<00:02:33.850> this<00:02:34.630> cooling<00:02:34.959> coil

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
gonna get sprayed into this cooling coil

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.320 
gonna get sprayed into this cooling coil
and<00:02:35.470> you<00:02:35.890> can<00:02:36.160> see<00:02:36.400> all<00:02:36.760> right<00:02:36.880> what<00:02:37.030> happens

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
and you can see all right what happens

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.290 
and you can see all right what happens
is<00:02:37.480> a<00:02:38.160> after<00:02:39.160> its<00:02:39.310> passed<00:02:39.550> through<00:02:39.760> a<00:02:39.790> filter

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
is a after its passed through a filter

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.080 
is a after its passed through a filter
gets<00:02:40.690> forced<00:02:41.260> through<00:02:41.860> this<00:02:42.430> cooling<00:02:42.850> coil

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
gets forced through this cooling coil

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:44.760 
gets forced through this cooling coil
alright<00:02:43.870> and<00:02:43.989> when<00:02:44.080> it<00:02:44.170> comes<00:02:44.350> out<00:02:44.500> on<00:02:44.680> the

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:44.770 
alright and when it comes out on the

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:49.650 
alright and when it comes out on the
other<00:02:44.800> end<00:02:44.980> you<00:02:45.280> get<00:02:45.910> cold<00:02:46.180> air<00:02:48.540> after<00:02:49.540> the

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
other end you get cold air after the

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.360 
other end you get cold air after the
refrigerant<00:02:50.140> gets<00:02:50.290> sprayed<00:02:50.800> into<00:02:51.070> the

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
refrigerant gets sprayed into the

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.670 
refrigerant gets sprayed into the
cooling<00:02:51.940> coil<00:02:52.120> it<00:02:52.360> becomes<00:02:52.630> a<00:02:52.750> guess<00:02:52.930> so<00:02:53.500> your

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
cooling coil it becomes a guess so your

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.500 
cooling coil it becomes a guess so your
next<00:02:53.920> step<00:02:54.010> will<00:02:54.400> be<00:02:54.430> to<00:02:54.550> convert<00:02:54.970> it<00:02:55.330> back

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
next step will be to convert it back

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.140 
next step will be to convert it back
into<00:02:56.320> a<00:02:56.560> high-pressure<00:02:57.040> liquid<00:02:57.310> what<00:02:58.030> do<00:02:58.090> you

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
into a high-pressure liquid what do you

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.870 
into a high-pressure liquid what do you
need<00:02:58.269> back<00:02:59.260> to<00:02:59.500> the<00:02:59.590> compressor<00:02:59.830> and<00:03:00.250> the

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
need back to the compressor and the

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:12.059 
need back to the compressor and the
cycle<00:03:01.180> goes<00:03:01.330> on<00:03:10.470> what<00:03:11.470> you're<00:03:11.620> looking<00:03:11.709> at<00:03:11.920> my

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:12.069 
cycle goes on what you're looking at my

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:15.360 
cycle goes on what you're looking at my
friends<00:03:12.459> is<00:03:12.660> the<00:03:13.660> fresco<00:03:14.350> one<00:03:14.739> three<00:03:14.980> four<00:03:15.220> a

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
friends is the fresco one three four a

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.250 
friends is the fresco one three four a
refrigerant<00:03:15.880> now<00:03:16.090> that<00:03:16.450> is<00:03:16.630> what<00:03:16.989> gets

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
refrigerant now that is what gets

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.979 
refrigerant now that is what gets
changed<00:03:17.860> from<00:03:18.370> the<00:03:18.940> pressurized<00:03:19.420> liquid

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:19.989 
changed from the pressurized liquid

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:22.530 
changed from the pressurized liquid
state<00:03:20.440> into<00:03:21.100> a<00:03:21.130> gaseous<00:03:21.730> state<00:03:21.910> and<00:03:22.239> then<00:03:22.450> you

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
state into a gaseous state and then you

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:23.850 
state into a gaseous state and then you
know<00:03:22.660> it<00:03:22.780> takes<00:03:22.930> all<00:03:23.079> the<00:03:23.110> heat<00:03:23.350> away<00:03:23.440> then

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:23.860 
know it takes all the heat away then

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:26.430 
know it takes all the heat away then
that's<00:03:24.040> how<00:03:24.220> it<00:03:24.250> gets<00:03:24.489> cold<00:03:24.790> and<00:03:25.150> you<00:03:25.840> know<00:03:25.959> you

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
that's how it gets cold and you know you

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.740 
that's how it gets cold and you know you
get<00:03:26.560> your<00:03:26.680> cold<00:03:26.920> air<00:03:27.299> so<00:03:28.299> what<00:03:28.420> you<00:03:28.540> see<00:03:28.720> right

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
get your cold air so what you see right

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.300 
get your cold air so what you see right
here<00:03:28.930> is<00:03:29.200> the<00:03:29.350> gauge<00:03:29.560> that's<00:03:29.860> connected<00:03:30.280> to

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
here is the gauge that's connected to

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.210 
here is the gauge that's connected to
the<00:03:30.549> high-pressure<00:03:31.120> pipe<00:03:31.540> okay<00:03:31.750> so<00:03:31.900> of<00:03:32.049> course

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
the high-pressure pipe okay so of course

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.590 
the high-pressure pipe okay so of course
two<00:03:33.220> gauges<00:03:33.430> one<00:03:33.850> to<00:03:33.970> the<00:03:34.060> high<00:03:34.180> one<00:03:34.420> to<00:03:34.540> the

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:34.600 
two gauges one to the high one to the

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.150 
two gauges one to the high one to the
law<00:03:34.720> and<00:03:34.930> you<00:03:35.230> suppose<00:03:35.470> to<00:03:35.530> get<00:03:35.680> a<00:03:35.739> difference

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
law and you suppose to get a difference

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:37.770 
law and you suppose to get a difference
the<00:03:36.579> moment<00:03:36.880> you<00:03:36.940> don't<00:03:37.150> get<00:03:37.390> a<00:03:37.450> difference

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
the moment you don't get a difference

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:38.819 
the moment you don't get a difference
between<00:03:37.900> the<00:03:38.110> high<00:03:38.230> and<00:03:38.260> low<00:03:38.410> pressure

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:22.600 
check the cap system first okay because

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.150 
check the cap system first okay because
this<00:04:23.230> is<00:04:23.380> something<00:04:23.650> that<00:04:23.680> usually<00:04:23.950> spells

very easily this is something that's

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:29.970

with<00:04:31.420> sugar<00:04:31.600> anyway<00:04:31.870> this<00:04:32.560> is<00:04:32.830> a<00:04:32.890> very<00:04:33.340> very

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
with sugar anyway this is a very very

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.570 
with sugar anyway this is a very very
important<00:04:34.540> component<00:04:34.750> to<00:04:35.350> add<00:04:35.860> into<00:04:36.550> your

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:36.580 
important component to add into your

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:38.010 
important component to add into your
refrigerant<00:04:37.120> we<00:04:37.300> can<00:04:37.450> see<00:04:37.600> right<00:04:37.780> there<00:04:37.810> it's

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
refrigerant we can see right there it's

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.050 
refrigerant we can see right there it's
called<00:04:38.170> the<00:04:38.260> compressor<00:04:38.770> oil<00:04:38.800> now<00:04:39.460> the<00:04:39.520> job<00:04:39.910> of

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:40.060 
called the compressor oil now the job of

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:42.540 
called the compressor oil now the job of
this<00:04:40.300> oil<00:04:41.230> is<00:04:41.500> actually<00:04:41.650> to<00:04:41.950> lubricate<00:04:42.490> the

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:42.550 
this oil is actually to lubricate the

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:44.940 
this oil is actually to lubricate the
compressor<00:04:43.240> as<00:04:43.420> the<00:04:43.960> refrigerant<00:04:44.410> you<00:04:44.830> know

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:44.950 
compressor as the refrigerant you know

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:46.380 
compressor as the refrigerant you know
flows<00:04:45.220> through<00:04:45.430> it<00:04:45.520> so<00:04:45.790> you<00:04:46.000> can<00:04:46.180> kind<00:04:46.360> of

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:46.390 
flows through it so you can kind of

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:49.590 
flows through it so you can kind of
think<00:04:46.450> of<00:04:46.630> it<00:04:46.720> as<00:04:46.930> a<00:04:47.040> engine<00:04:48.040> oil<00:04:48.450> for<00:04:49.450> your

seal off any leaks and stuff like that
you<00:05:44.500> might<00:05:44.710> want<00:05:44.980> to<00:05:45.040> ask<00:05:45.280> your<00:05:45.580> mechanic<00:05:45.700> to

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:46.090 
you might want to ask your mechanic to

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:48.150 
you might want to ask your mechanic to
add<00:05:46.240> a<00:05:46.270> dye<00:05:46.660> to<00:05:47.080> the<00:05:47.200> infusion<00:05:47.440> this<00:05:47.920> can<00:05:48.100> be

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:48.160 
add a dye to the infusion this can be

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:49.800 
add a dye to the infusion this can be
very<00:05:48.340> useful<00:05:48.370> why<00:05:48.730> because<00:05:49.120> if<00:05:49.300> there<00:05:49.630> is<00:05:49.780> a

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:49.810 
very useful why because if there is a

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:52.170 
very useful why because if there is a
leak<00:05:50.080> it's<00:05:50.860> gonna<00:05:51.040> be<00:05:51.160> very<00:05:51.400> easy<00:05:51.730> for<00:05:52.000> you<00:05:52.150> to

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:52.180 
leak it's gonna be very easy for you to

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:54.270 
leak it's gonna be very easy for you to
detect<00:05:52.660> it<00:05:52.810> and<00:05:52.930> to<00:05:53.410> detect<00:05:53.680> exactly<00:05:53.860> where

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:54.280 
detect it and to detect exactly where

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:55.920 
detect it and to detect exactly where
this<00:05:54.400> and<00:05:54.640> just<00:05:55.000> go<00:05:55.150> straight<00:05:55.180> to<00:05:55.510> the<00:05:55.630> problem

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:55.930 
this and just go straight to the problem

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:57.870 
this and just go straight to the problem
the<00:05:56.110> last<00:05:56.290> but<00:05:56.440> not<00:05:56.500> least<00:05:56.740> don't<00:05:57.160> forget<00:05:57.580> your

the last but not least don't forget your

compressor is powered by your engine

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:02.880 
compressor is powered by your engine
which<00:06:01.090> means<00:06:01.300> if<00:06:01.660> there's<00:06:01.900> a<00:06:01.960> problem<00:06:02.200> with<00:06:02.710> an
