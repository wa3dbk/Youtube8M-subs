00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:07.210

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:11.200
 this movie guarantees that you will laugh for being the best movie and 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.069

 thanks to the fox too

 tuenti century fox 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.359
 if you have something precious from your childhood 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.359
 we turn it into shit 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.900
 past 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.900
 yes 

00:02:13.779 --> 00:02:15.139
 Hi all 

00:02:15.139 --> 00:02:17.709
 I am very excited this time 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:21.599
 I'm more than normal because today I'm going to give you the withdrawal of the budokai game 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:23.929
 tenkaichi two for ps2 

00:02:23.929 --> 00:02:28.269
 the question is the following in my life I have only played three dragon games 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:28.709
 boalo 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:30.590
 dragon bolt gt faín alba utc 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.329
 that was a very big crap 

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:34.189
 you could not move nimbly 

00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:38.519
 the special powers were executed under a combination of long buttons 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:40.679
 and it's just very boring 

00:02:40.679 --> 00:02:42.530
 after that great disappointment 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.130
 I decided not to play another game since the compose until I played well 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.770
 you will know which is a bic tempo where you control several characters and advance 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:53.069
 killing saint-amans and androids 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:57.589
 I liked this game a lot but it did not show enough 

00:02:57.589 --> 00:03:02.209
 the fact is that one day I was looking for good games on the internet and I noticed 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:06.199
 that the curfew game and circuses had good scores on all 

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:08.789
 sites so I decided to download 

00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:11.529
 finally the game criticize him 

00:03:11.529 --> 00:03:15.829
 It should be noted that this game is not normal is the modified Latin version 

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:19.159
 by chapman to which I want to send a greeting and thanks 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:24.410
 this game has remarkably motherfucker graphics because it uses the 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:28.840
 date 5 using the appearance of the characters are much more similar to 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.569
 the originals in the series 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:35.069
 the music is spectacular especially because they did not start inventing blowjob 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:39.529
 taken from the ass but they are melodies taken from the original series which 

00:03:39.529 --> 00:03:42.629
 Makes you feel more inside the universe of dragon ball 

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:46.709
 probably this is the most complete dragon game to date 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:51.189
 since it contains all the areas itself from the saga shrek Latin to the saga 

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:55.809
 boss plus three alternative stories that although they are a bit futures we 

00:03:55.809 --> 00:03:59.189
 will award more than 80 different levels and battles 

00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:03.089
 unlike most of the fighting games the tombola z budokai 

00:04:03.089 --> 00:04:07.409
 Tenkaichi 2 shows a third person view from the perspective of behind 

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:11.540
 of the character that you control which makes you feel more within the universe of 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:12.489
 dragon ball 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:17.029
 the attacks are simple but they are very powerful and enjoyable at every moment 

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:22.009
 of the game we can teleport, we can send kicks and blows between 

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:26.169
 other things by pressing the buttons square triangle disciple 

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:29.660
 something more remarkable is that you no longer need to make a super mega 

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:33.840
 combination of buttons to launch a canejo canejo but we can run 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.660
 not in a fairly simple and comfortable way 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:41.640
 during the battle below the life bar there is a dye meter we will 

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:44.760
 fill in all the time if we want to make special attacks 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:49.010
 teleport or simply block certain attacks from our 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.939
 enemies 

00:04:49.939 --> 00:04:54.550
 something quite useful unlike other fighting games is that there is a 

00:04:54.549 --> 00:04:57.990
 training session where they teach you how to use the basic techniques 

00:04:57.989 --> 00:05:00.999
 to know how to play during the game 

00:05:00.999 --> 00:05:05.209
 something that we have tried some overcame the piece of shit car slaughtered 

00:05:05.209 --> 00:05:09.489
 is that the super sayayin characters can be transformed in real time 

00:05:09.489 --> 00:05:14.729
 during the battle I explain myself in auto tasks the four phases of baquba see 

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:16.979
 as four different characters 

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:20.330
 try and success transformations are all in 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:24.210
 the same character can not transform it when we want and we have 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:26.110
 the transformation has 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:30.430
 apart from the story mode in the game we can use the arts tournament mode 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:35.349
 martial by street z in the martial arts tournament the ingesa a character 

00:05:35.349 --> 00:05:38.720
 that you want to compete and take it to the end so they see you 

00:05:38.719 --> 00:05:43.039
 prize with which we can buy improvements for our characters from 

00:05:43.039 --> 00:05:46.160
 increase the power of the attack the fifth the speed 

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.069
 the defense hello health 

00:05:48.069 --> 00:05:52.669
 in zeta battle mode we must pass through ten opponents and if we 

00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:56.369
 we center under the specifications of the game we will raise of level 

00:05:56.369 --> 00:06:00.469
 automatically to a certain character depending of course who you're 

00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:01.300
 chosen one 

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:05.599
 as an alternative mission during the battles we will have to destroy the 

00:06:05.599 --> 00:06:08.599
 scenarios to find the hidden spheres of the dragon 

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:13.380
 if we get them all if the melon will appear and offer us an improvement 

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:15.529
 among the ten that you have available 

00:06:15.529 --> 00:06:19.789
 something admirable of the game is also the list of characters which is wide 

00:06:19.789 --> 00:06:23.769
 extensive and quite striking unlike the piece of shit works 

00:06:23.769 --> 00:06:26.969
 something although it only has the most powerful characters 

00:06:26.969 --> 00:06:30.990
 that the 85 won the useless dispersed so fight in this game 

00:06:31.879 --> 00:06:33.069
 we see play concluded 

00:06:33.069 --> 00:06:34.669
 tell it 

00:06:34.669 --> 00:06:38.180
 with bojan with master roshi with soap with dad 

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:42.270
 with frizer in bad weather with cm cohn-bendit with a prolific noticed 

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:46.050
 josé to you can play with one of the best screens and selection of 

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:48.020
 characters that have been seen 

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:51.759
 this game is not only played alone but also we can 

00:06:51.759 --> 00:06:56.430
 play in versus mode to split mother to our friends bastards 

00:06:56.430 --> 00:07:00.060
 The last thing I can point out is the excellent work that has created its 

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:03.930
 weekly change all dialogs of the characters to make it look like 

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:07.189
 authentic to the series and remind us of our childhood 

00:07:07.189 --> 00:07:11.860
 congratulations I look forward to the cosmocaixa in carichí three latinos 

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:16.020
 in my opinion it is one of the best fighting games I have played in my 

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:20.370
 life and of course not only is it good as a game but it respects all 

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:24.120
 essence that must have a game from the make up angel control with a lot 

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:26.400
 dynamism excellent practices 

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:28.860
 impeccable gameplay great music 

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:31.969
 fuck is a game that is really worth playing 

00:07:31.969 --> 00:07:35.080
 my final note for the game is 9 points 5 of the day 

00:07:35.649 --> 00:07:38.919
 I'm not going to put it right because it's too difficult 

00:07:38.919 --> 00:07:42.759
 a recommendation before playing this game those who have not 

00:07:42.759 --> 00:07:45.050
 prepare your hands and wrists 

00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:48.860
 preferably look for gloves because this game is going to leave you 

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:50.999
 hands made a shit 

00:07:50.999 --> 00:07:54.169
 up to here comes the criticism I hope you liked it 

00:07:54.169 --> 00:07:57.169
 video so I say goodbye saying goodbye but until next time 

00:07:57.889 --> 00:08:01.149
 please leave comments and stars that cost nothing
