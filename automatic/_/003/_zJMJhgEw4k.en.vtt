00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:27.500
 Hi everybody, I'm going to teach you how to do it today. 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:32.300
 this heart subsidies to the heart in 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:35.090
 technique that this heart serves to 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:37.340
 you decorate Valentine's Cards 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.770
 mothers day fathers day 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:45.140
 anyway this is special of the day 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:47.590
 Valentines a super simple pectin you 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.590
 you can use 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.149
 to decorate the house 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.210
 to make furniture look at that pipe 

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:09.909
 will also teach this piece from here 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:13.030
 and sbt 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:19.119
 good hope you all spent 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:24.359
 make far to the next block I go 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:27.359
 explain how material in the s 

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:27.359
 ef 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.710
 this here and 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.840
 so we will use materials to 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:45.470
 make as much heart as this piece 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:48.530
 stay on the call and if there are strips 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:52.280
 from paper to this one is a strip of 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:56.869
 paper and has a width of light incentive 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:02:00.320
 May be but confirm finer school 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:02.750
 thicker to say it will determine 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.149
 then you will also use the 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:09.649
 tool 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:13.970
 he is the one from here where you put the 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:16.670
 paper law and you will also use 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:20.170
 white glue next block I go 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.170
 explain the easy step 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:25.190
 So to make this heart. 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:35.380
 learn not going to make the next catch 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.380
 a strip of paper 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:55.420
 will fold to half after middle grade 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.420
 It will catch no time. 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:09.340
 What's going to roll to God? 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:12.870
 saw knows 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.870
 you go in colombo 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:30.510
 until you get twice as loose 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:30.510
 and now made a decision again 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:53.810
 weld 

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:59.390
 and now you will model with hand 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:04:02.140
 fold we made here you pull and 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:02.140
 fit here 

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:06.010
 in English 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:13.450
 You get white glue pass here. 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:28.150
 the piece itself just waiting to dry 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:38.400
 now we're going to do this other piece 

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:38.400
 from here and the completion of the module 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:45.750
 so to make only one piece you go 

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:45.750
 fold in half again 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:59.000
 after cedral middle of senai 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:05:06.889
 in the tool the game follow and ol 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:06.889
 and you will talk until the double line has doubled. 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:19.069
 done that the trophy is now this 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:22.370
 dogmas or judgments will come in and you 

00:05:19.069 --> 00:05:32.500
 Are you going to do it now? Are you going to roll it out? 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:32.500
 You get that other ball art. 

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:47.220
 bush 

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:50.540
 and then you will notice 

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:54.970
 There you go and do what? 

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:54.970
 justice just a little bit 

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:06.660
 and there you are ready from the terminal to your door 

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:06.660
 on here 

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:18.560
 a beautiful and 

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:25.810
 there are no guards here 

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:36.090
 this other one and you will do so 

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:36.090
 Usda Double the Medium 

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:44.610
 together the forms 

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:51.550
 I find it here 

00:06:55.550 --> 00:07:01.240
 and then the 

00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:03.690
 When you leave, he's already on the way. 

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:03.690
 soul 

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:19.450
 already in mauÃ¡ it is almost getting there at home 

00:07:21.169 --> 00:07:25.659
 then he would just let go 

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:29.730
 That's when the thesis is ready. 

00:07:31.969 --> 00:07:39.009
 good this first video but the nature 

00:07:34.999 --> 00:07:41.929
 to make the pieces to create an egg 

00:07:39.009 --> 00:07:44.119
 I hope you will be tanned in the next 

00:07:41.929 --> 00:07:48.789
 block known in the next video I go 

00:07:44.119 --> 00:07:48.789
 teach how to assemble the module 

00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:54.110
 to the next 

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:54.110
 O
