00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
klove fable of and i guess i've put it

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.939 
klove fable of and i guess i've put it
on<00:00:29.010> for<00:00:29.160> a<00:00:29.220> substitute<00:00:29.730> but<00:00:30.060> i<00:00:30.710> decided<00:00:31.710> to<00:00:31.920> go

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
on for a substitute but i decided to go

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.930 
on for a substitute but i decided to go
for<00:00:32.430> it<00:00:32.489> on<00:00:32.579> the<00:00:32.700> second<00:00:33.059> turn<00:00:33.180> instead<00:00:33.450> and

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:34.940 
for it on the second turn instead and

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.450 
for it on the second turn instead and
luckily<00:00:35.940> that<00:00:36.710> clefable<00:00:37.710> did<00:00:38.040> not<00:00:38.190> have<00:00:38.430> a

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
luckily that clefable did not have a

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.950 
luckily that clefable did not have a
lung<00:00:38.700> Barry<00:00:38.910> I<00:00:39.000> think<00:00:39.300> quite<00:00:39.420> a<00:00:39.480> few<00:00:39.660> with<00:00:39.809> that

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
lung Barry I think quite a few with that

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.139 
lung Barry I think quite a few with that
item<00:00:40.230> but<00:00:41.190> this<00:00:41.340> one<00:00:41.550> must<00:00:41.730> have<00:00:41.850> something

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
item but this one must have something

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.930 
item but this one must have something
else<00:00:42.450> like<00:00:42.629> leftovers<00:00:43.260> or<00:00:43.440> something<00:00:43.940> alright

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
else like leftovers or something alright

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.970 
else like leftovers or something alright
so<00:00:45.059> he<00:00:45.270> sends<00:00:45.510> in<00:00:45.629> as<00:00:45.809> flareon<00:00:46.530> and<00:00:46.710> that<00:00:46.829> is<00:00:46.950> a

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
so he sends in as flareon and that is a

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.340 
so he sends in as flareon and that is a
very<00:00:47.340> good<00:00:47.820> switch<00:00:48.570> it<00:00:48.750> right<00:00:48.989> there<00:00:49.140> because

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
very good switch it right there because

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.430 
very good switch it right there because
my<00:00:50.160> only<00:00:50.370> attacking<00:00:51.030> move<00:00:51.360> is<00:00:51.600> giga<00:00:51.899> drain<00:00:52.020> and

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
my only attacking move is giga drain and

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.950 
my only attacking move is giga drain and
at<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.460> base<00:00:53.610> power<00:00:53.879> of<00:00:54.090> 60<00:00:54.480> it's<00:00:54.660> not<00:00:54.750> going

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
at the base power of 60 it's not going

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.650 
at the base power of 60 it's not going
to<00:00:55.050> do<00:00:55.170> a<00:00:55.199> lot<00:00:55.379> of<00:00:55.440> damage<00:00:55.710> to<00:00:55.860> a<00:00:56.570> lot<00:00:57.570> of

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
to do a lot of damage to a lot of

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.770 
to do a lot of damage to a lot of
pokemon<00:00:58.050> especially<00:00:58.620> a<00:00:59.090> fire-type<00:01:00.090> ok<00:01:00.719> so

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
pokemon especially a fire-type ok so

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.009 
pokemon especially a fire-type ok so
then<00:01:01.079> he<00:01:01.109> switches<00:01:01.469> out<00:01:01.710> as<00:01:01.859> flareon<00:01:02.640> and<00:01:03.019> that

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
then he switches out as flareon and that

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.109 
then he switches out as flareon and that
was<00:01:04.140> very<00:01:04.470> weird<00:01:04.799> because<00:01:05.100> that<00:01:05.489> didn't<00:01:06.000> make

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
was very weird because that didn't make

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.520 
was very weird because that didn't make
sense<00:01:06.180> at<00:01:06.479> all<00:01:06.540> I<00:01:06.630> mean<00:01:06.750> why<00:01:07.049> would<00:01:07.260> you<00:01:07.380> do

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
sense at all I mean why would you do

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.359 
sense at all I mean why would you do
that<00:01:07.560> he<00:01:08.240> basically<00:01:09.240> had<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.200> advantage<00:01:10.770> but

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
that he basically had the advantage but

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.390 
that he basically had the advantage but
it<00:01:11.580> I<00:01:12.080> know<00:01:13.080> that<00:01:13.320> was<00:01:13.439> no<00:01:13.619> miss<00:01:13.860> click<00:01:14.189> because

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
it I know that was no miss click because

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.490 
it I know that was no miss click because
how<00:01:15.000> could<00:01:15.180> you<00:01:15.299> make<00:01:15.630> that<00:01:15.689> huge<00:01:16.290> of<00:01:16.409> a

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
how could you make that huge of a

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.060 
how could you make that huge of a
mistake<00:01:17.689> so<00:01:18.689> yeah<00:01:18.840> I<00:01:18.869> use<00:01:19.140> growth<00:01:19.500> and<00:01:19.890> I

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
mistake so yeah I use growth and I

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.700 
mistake so yeah I use growth and I
multiply<00:01:20.580> my<00:01:20.729> special<00:01:21.150> attack<00:01:21.390> power<00:01:21.600> by<00:01:21.720> 1.5

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
multiply my special attack power by 1.5

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.100 
multiply my special attack power by 1.5
and<00:01:23.040> I<00:01:23.820> am<00:01:23.939> going<00:01:24.150> to<00:01:24.240> go<00:01:24.330> for<00:01:24.479> my<00:01:24.600> second<00:01:24.990> one

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
and I am going to go for my second one

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.710 
and I am going to go for my second one
to<00:01:25.890> multiply<00:01:26.340> it<00:01:26.400> even<00:01:26.790> higher<00:01:27.060> so<00:01:27.420> now<00:01:27.540> my

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
to multiply it even higher so now my

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.580 
to multiply it even higher so now my
rose<00:01:28.020> rate<00:01:28.290> is<00:01:28.530> and<00:01:28.920> sweeping<00:01:29.909> mode<00:01:30.180> right<00:01:30.390> now

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
rose rate is and sweeping mode right now

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.499 
rose rate is and sweeping mode right now
and<00:01:31.590> that<00:01:31.650> conf<00:01:31.950> able<00:01:32.280> is<00:01:32.430> endangered<00:01:33.150> if<00:01:33.329> it

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
and that conf able is endangered if it

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.550 
and that conf able is endangered if it
doesn't<00:01:33.950> wake<00:01:34.950> up<00:01:35.070> any<00:01:35.250> time<00:01:35.430> soon<00:01:36.380> so<00:01:37.380> yeah

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
doesn't wake up any time soon so yeah

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.190 
doesn't wake up any time soon so yeah
wake<00:01:38.130> up<00:01:38.460> clefable<00:01:38.880> so<00:01:39.659> yeah<00:01:39.780> this<00:01:39.960> is<00:01:40.079> my

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
wake up clefable so yeah this is my

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.050 
wake up clefable so yeah this is my
third<00:01:40.439> growth<00:01:40.770> I<00:01:40.920> think<00:01:40.950> alright<00:01:41.820> wasn't

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
third growth I think alright wasn't

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.380 
third growth I think alright wasn't
paying<00:01:42.360> attention<00:01:43.159> yeah<00:01:44.159> ok<00:01:44.460> so<00:01:44.520> it<00:01:44.939> wakes<00:01:45.119> up

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
paying attention yeah ok so it wakes up

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.749 
paying attention yeah ok so it wakes up
and<00:01:45.570> it<00:01:45.659> goes<00:01:45.810> for<00:01:45.990> a<00:01:46.020> soft-boiled<00:01:46.500> and<00:01:46.860> it

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
and it goes for a soft-boiled and it

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.910 
and it goes for a soft-boiled and it
gets<00:01:48.030> burned<00:01:48.360> from<00:01:48.659> that<00:01:48.930> flame<00:01:49.290> war<00:01:49.530> it<00:01:49.799> was

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
gets burned from that flame war it was

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.460 
gets burned from that flame war it was
holding<00:01:50.450> so<00:01:51.450> at<00:01:51.570> this<00:01:51.600> point<00:01:51.960> I'm<00:01:52.170> not<00:01:52.320> really

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
holding so at this point I'm not really

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.230 
holding so at this point I'm not really
sure<00:01:52.560> what<00:01:52.950> that<00:01:52.979> fable<00:01:53.490> is<00:01:53.579> up<00:01:53.729> to<00:01:53.880> it<00:01:54.090> could

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
sure what that fable is up to it could

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.360 
sure what that fable is up to it could
be<00:01:54.390> a<00:01:54.439> special<00:01:55.439> attacker<00:01:55.710> physical<00:01:56.600> attacker

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:58.370 
be a special attacker physical attacker

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:01.000 
be a special attacker physical attacker
with<00:01:58.970> that<00:01:59.150> facade<00:01:59.660> strategy<00:02:00.320> or<00:02:00.590> it<00:02:00.860> could<00:02:00.980> be

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:01.010 
with that facade strategy or it could be

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:03.490 
with that facade strategy or it could be
a<00:02:01.160> wall<00:02:01.640> or<00:02:01.670> something<00:02:02.120> I<00:02:02.510> don't<00:02:03.170> really<00:02:03.290> know

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
a wall or something I don't really know

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.060 
a wall or something I don't really know
it's<00:02:04.010> confusing<00:02:04.220> me<00:02:05.320> but<00:02:06.320> it's<00:02:06.530> gonna<00:02:06.710> go<00:02:06.890> down

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.070 
it's confusing me but it's gonna go down

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.460 
it's confusing me but it's gonna go down
anyways<00:02:08.170> so<00:02:09.170> I<00:02:09.200> go<00:02:09.590> for<00:02:09.800> a<00:02:09.830> giga<00:02:10.100> drain<00:02:10.310> and

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
anyways so I go for a giga drain and

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.430 
anyways so I go for a giga drain and
it's<00:02:12.470> going<00:02:12.650> to<00:02:12.710> do<00:02:12.800> severe<00:02:13.700> amount<00:02:13.880> of<00:02:14.030> damage

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
it's going to do severe amount of damage

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.290 
it's going to do severe amount of damage
so<00:02:15.440> I<00:02:15.650> used<00:02:16.220> growth<00:02:16.520> so<00:02:16.730> many<00:02:16.910> times<00:02:17.060> by<00:02:17.270> now

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
so I used growth so many times by now

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.100 
so I used growth so many times by now
and<00:02:17.930> it<00:02:18.050> does<00:02:18.080> about<00:02:18.380> it<00:02:19.190> does<00:02:19.340> over<00:02:19.730> half<00:02:20.110> and

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
and it does about it does over half and

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:22.510 
and it does about it does over half and
then<00:02:21.170> it<00:02:21.290> goes<00:02:21.380> for<00:02:21.560> another<00:02:21.740> cosmic<00:02:21.980> power

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 
then it goes for another cosmic power

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:27.310 
then it goes for another cosmic power
and<00:02:23.090> it's<00:02:23.330> still<00:02:23.660> not<00:02:23.720> attacking<00:02:24.410> so<00:02:24.970> yeah<00:02:26.320> so

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:27.320 
and it's still not attacking so yeah so

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:28.450 
and it's still not attacking so yeah so
right<00:02:27.470> here<00:02:27.650> I'm<00:02:27.740> going<00:02:27.860> to<00:02:27.950> go<00:02:28.040> for<00:02:28.220> a<00:02:28.280> giga

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:28.460 
right here I'm going to go for a giga

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:30.160 
right here I'm going to go for a giga
drain<00:02:28.670> because<00:02:29.000> if<00:02:29.540> I<00:02:29.600> would<00:02:29.750> have<00:02:29.840> gone<00:02:29.930> for<00:02:29.990> a

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
drain because if I would have gone for a

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:31.860 
drain because if I would have gone for a
growth<00:02:30.440> this<00:02:30.710> battle<00:02:31.040> would<00:02:31.130> have<00:02:31.250> dragged<00:02:31.490> on

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
growth this battle would have dragged on

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.890 
growth this battle would have dragged on
even<00:02:32.870> longer<00:02:33.200> and<00:02:33.380> I<00:02:33.620> do<00:02:33.680> not<00:02:34.100> want<00:02:34.160> that

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
even longer and I do not want that

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.320 
even longer and I do not want that
because<00:02:35.900> I<00:02:36.620> just<00:02:37.100> wanted<00:02:37.340> to<00:02:37.430> take<00:02:37.760> the<00:02:37.850> sample

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
because I just wanted to take the sample

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:39.940 
because I just wanted to take the sample
out<00:02:38.420> once<00:02:38.660> and<00:02:38.810> for<00:02:38.870> all<00:02:39.050> and<00:02:39.110> it<00:02:39.410> finally<00:02:39.680> goes

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
out once and for all and it finally goes

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.760 
out once and for all and it finally goes
down<00:02:40.130> in<00:02:40.580> this<00:02:40.730> turn<00:02:40.970> so<00:02:41.750> he's<00:02:41.990> left<00:02:42.320> with<00:02:42.440> two

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:42.770 
down in this turn so he's left with two

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:44.260 
down in this turn so he's left with two
pokemon<00:02:43.160> left<00:02:43.310> and<00:02:43.550> he's<00:02:43.670> gonna<00:02:43.850> send<00:02:44.120> his

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:44.270 
pokemon left and he's gonna send his

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:46.660 
pokemon left and he's gonna send his
send<00:02:44.900> in<00:02:45.050> his<00:02:45.290> flareon<00:02:45.830> obviously<00:02:46.310> so<00:02:46.490> that's

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
send in his flareon obviously so that's

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.270 
send in his flareon obviously so that's
the<00:02:46.760> best<00:02:46.910> choice<00:02:47.210> and<00:02:47.950> right<00:02:48.950> here<00:02:49.070> I'm<00:02:49.130> gonna

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
the best choice and right here I'm gonna

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.830 
the best choice and right here I'm gonna
go<00:02:49.400> straight<00:02:49.910> for<00:02:50.030> an<00:02:50.150> attack<00:02:50.360> because<00:02:50.660> if<00:02:50.780> I

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
go straight for an attack because if I

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.180 
go straight for an attack because if I
would<00:02:51.020> have<00:02:51.110> gone<00:02:51.260> for<00:02:51.320> a<00:02:51.530> sleep<00:02:51.740> powder<00:02:51.920> that

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
would have gone for a sleep powder that

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.130 
would have gone for a sleep powder that
would<00:02:52.340> have<00:02:52.430> been<00:02:52.520> way<00:02:52.730> too<00:02:52.760> cheap<00:02:53.120> I<00:02:53.390> don't

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140
