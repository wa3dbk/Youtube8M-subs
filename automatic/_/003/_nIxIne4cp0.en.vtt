00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.400 
that even though you hear the note from
time<00:03:08.400> to<00:03:08.550> time<00:03:08.580> it<00:03:08.940> really<00:03:09.209> doesn't<00:03:09.930> cause<00:03:10.140> any

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
time to time it really doesn't cause any

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.890 
time to time it really doesn't cause any
problems<00:03:11.090> so<00:03:12.090> coming<00:03:12.390> off<00:03:12.480> the<00:03:12.660> end<00:03:12.780> of<00:03:12.840> the

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
problems so coming off the end of the

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:57.559 
problems so coming off the end of the
sole

00:03:57.559 --> 00:03:57.569 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:01.530 

and<00:03:58.569> so<00:03:59.260> these<00:03:59.409> are<00:03:59.470> just<00:03:59.739> some<00:03:59.859> ideas<00:04:00.370> to<00:04:01.299> show

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
and so these are just some ideas to show

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.119 
and so these are just some ideas to show
you<00:04:01.599> where<00:04:01.870> you<00:04:01.989> can<00:04:02.169> use<00:04:02.349> the<00:04:02.560> ever<00:04:02.829> popular

00:04:03.119 --> 00:04:03.129 
you where you can use the ever popular

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:05.309 
you where you can use the ever popular
Eddie<00:04:03.819> Collins<00:04:04.150> perhaps<00:04:04.689> you<00:04:04.930> manage<00:04:05.230> a

00:04:05.309 --> 00:04:05.319 
Eddie Collins perhaps you manage a

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:07.919 
Eddie Collins perhaps you manage a
rhythm<00:04:05.590> stone
