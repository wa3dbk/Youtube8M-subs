release the iphone if stevis jobs is not
there<00:01:51.869> I<00:01:51.899> would<00:01:52.200> assume<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.710> rise<00:01:52.920> my<00:01:53.189> phone

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430

there I would assume the rise my phone
may<00:01:54.030> not<00:01:54.270> be<00:01:54.479> released<00:01:54.810> um<00:01:55.189> but<00:01:56.189> I<00:01:56.250> think<00:01:56.640> that

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
may not be released um but I think that

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.580 
may not be released um but I think that
Steve<00:01:57.090> will<00:01:57.390> be<00:01:57.509> there<00:01:57.689> and<00:01:57.930> I<00:01:57.990> do<00:01:58.049> think<00:01:58.439> it's

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
Steve will be there and I do think it's

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.889 
Steve will be there and I do think it's
going<00:01:58.740> to<00:01:58.860> be<00:01:58.950> released<00:01:59.399> in<00:01:59.670> terms<00:02:00.360> of<00:02:00.509> design

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
have the exact same design as the iphone

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.339 
have the exact same design as the iphone
4<00:02:07.079> does<00:02:07.320> now<00:02:07.640> except<00:02:08.640> they<00:02:09.569> will<00:02:09.810> have

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
4 does now except they will have

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.900 
4 does now except they will have
eliminated<00:02:10.950> the<00:02:11.069> antenna<00:02:11.700> issues

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
eliminated the antenna issues

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:14.970 
eliminated the antenna issues

causing all of apples and 10 issues with

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
the iphone earlier in 2010 will probably

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.850 
the iphone earlier in 2010 will probably
be<00:02:27.340> eliminated<00:02:27.940> because<00:02:28.120> Apple<00:02:28.780> wants<00:02:28.960> to<00:02:29.200> fix

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
be eliminated because Apple wants to fix

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.770 
be eliminated because Apple wants to fix
those<00:02:30.160> issues<00:02:30.190> and<00:02:30.970> also<00:02:31.150> they're<00:02:31.420> making<00:02:31.690> a

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
those issues and also they're making a

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.360 
those issues and also they're making a
different<00:02:32.140> type<00:02:32.350> of<00:02:32.380> antenna<00:02:32.950> for<00:02:33.310> the

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
different type of antenna for the

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:34.860 
different type of antenna for the
verizon<00:02:33.940> iphone<00:02:34.030> because<00:02:34.510> it's<00:02:34.660> a<00:02:34.750> different

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
verizon iphone because it's a different

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.180 
verizon iphone because it's a different
type<00:02:35.140> of<00:02:35.200> carrier<00:02:37.620> so<00:02:38.620> that's<00:02:38.860> pretty<00:02:39.070> much

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
type of carrier so that's pretty much

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:40.770 
type of carrier so that's pretty much
the<00:02:39.310> design<00:02:39.700> i<00:02:39.730> would<00:02:40.000> expect<00:02:40.150> literally<00:02:40.660> the

the design i would expect literally the

the design i would expect literally the

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:43.240 
exact same thing with just a new antenna

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:44.880 
exact same thing with just a new antenna
