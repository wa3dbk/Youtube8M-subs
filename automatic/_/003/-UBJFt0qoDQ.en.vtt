have<00:03:27.770> been<00:03:27.920> that<00:03:28.160> okay<00:03:28.970> so<00:03:29.030> it's<00:03:29.209> case<00:03:29.390> of

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
have been that okay so it's case of

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.990 
have been that okay so it's case of
walking<00:03:29.810> around<00:03:29.870> and<00:03:30.110> finding<00:03:30.800> the<00:03:30.920> fish<00:03:31.129> in

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
walking around and finding the fish in

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.350 
walking around and finding the fish in
the<00:03:32.120> last<00:03:32.269> few<00:03:32.390> seconds<00:03:34.000> central<00:03:35.000> sort<00:03:35.150> part

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:35.360 
the last few seconds central sort part

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:36.130 
the last few seconds central sort part
of<00:03:35.450> the<00:03:35.510> lake<00:03:35.629> and<00:03:35.720> that's<00:03:35.870> why<00:03:35.989> I've<00:03:36.080> been

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:36.140 
of the lake and that's why I've been

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.830 
of the lake and that's why I've been
catching<00:03:36.500> book<00:03:36.650> no<00:03:37.459> bends<00:03:37.670> of<00:03:37.819> talked<00:03:38.569> about<00:03:38.810> a

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
catching book no bends of talked about a

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.420 
catching book no bends of talked about a
quarter<00:03:39.170> the<00:03:39.200> lake<00:03:39.379> stop<00:03:39.680> from<00:03:39.980> from<00:03:40.400> that

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
quarter the lake stop from from that

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:42.610 
quarter the lake stop from from that
sort<00:03:40.790> of<00:03:40.819> area<00:03:41.239> I<00:03:41.390> think<00:03:41.959> it's<00:03:42.080> fish<00:03:42.440> off<00:03:42.590> a

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
sort of area I think it's fish off a

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:43.780 
sort of area I think it's fish off a
little<00:03:42.800> bit<00:03:42.980> and<00:03:43.069> I<00:03:43.099> think<00:03:43.160> they're<00:03:43.550> moving

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
little bit and I think they're moving

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:44.830 
little bit and I think they're moving
around<00:03:43.849> the<00:03:44.000> lake<00:03:44.150> a<00:03:44.180> bit<00:03:44.360> more<00:03:44.450> freely<00:03:44.720> now

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
around the lake a bit more freely now

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.309 
around the lake a bit more freely now
and<00:03:45.080> that's<00:03:45.680> why<00:03:45.800> there<00:03:45.950> was<00:03:46.010> at<00:03:46.099> this<00:03:46.220> top<00:03:46.370> end

00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:47.319 
and that's why there was at this top end

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:49.839 
and that's why there was at this top end
but<00:03:48.319> I<00:03:48.349> think<00:03:48.440> I've<00:03:48.709> spoke<00:03:49.130> a<00:03:49.370> few<00:03:49.640> fish

00:03:49.839 --> 00:03:49.849 
but I think I've spoke a few fish

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:52.839 
but I think I've spoke a few fish
getting<00:03:50.090> the<00:03:50.150> rod<00:03:50.269> set<00:03:50.480> out<00:03:51.310> but<00:03:52.310> they<00:03:52.430> still

00:03:52.839 --> 00:03:52.849 
getting the rod set out but they still

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:54.670 
getting the rod set out but they still
want<00:03:53.000> to<00:03:53.060> take<00:03:53.180> your<00:03:53.450> hand<00:03:53.720> and<00:03:53.840> you<00:03:54.110> know

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 
want to take your hand and you know

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.059 
want to take your hand and you know
that's<00:03:55.069> what<00:03:55.220> caught<00:03:56.319> one<00:03:57.319> of<00:03:57.379> the<00:03:57.470> reasons<00:03:57.739> I

00:03:58.059 --> 00:03:58.069 
that's what caught one of the reasons I

00:03:58.069 --> 00:03:59.800 
that's what caught one of the reasons I
did<00:03:58.459> drop<00:03:58.610> in<00:03:58.760> here<00:03:58.849> I<00:03:58.910> saw<00:03:59.090> a<00:03:59.120> big<00:03:59.390> big<00:03:59.569> fish

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
did drop in here I saw a big big fish

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:01.539 
did drop in here I saw a big big fish

there for a bit even though it was 170

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:19.710 
there for a bit even though it was 170
yards<00:04:10.010> away<00:04:10.190> from<00:04:10.280> where<00:04:10.430> I'm<00:04:10.610> standing<00:04:10.700> then

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720

there's a baby right down the bottom

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:27.909 
there's a baby right down the bottom
there<00:04:22.940> that's<00:04:23.120> about<00:04:23.300> two<00:04:23.600> acres<00:04:26.919> that's

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:27.919 
there that's about two acres that's

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:29.379 
there that's about two acres that's
where<00:04:28.070> I<00:04:28.100> saw<00:04:28.250> the<00:04:28.310> big<00:04:28.460> fish<00:04:28.639> turn<00:04:29.150> the<00:04:29.300> other

00:04:29.379 --> 00:04:29.389 
where I saw the big fish turn the other

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:31.570 
where I saw the big fish turn the other
day<00:04:29.510> there's<00:04:30.470> a<00:04:30.530> little<00:04:30.800> bass<00:04:30.979> this<00:04:31.160> side<00:04:31.400> here

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:31.580 
day there's a little bass this side here

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:37.779 
day there's a little bass this side here
and<00:04:34.960> then<00:04:35.960> this<00:04:36.050> is<00:04:36.350> the<00:04:36.530> finger<00:04:36.889> Bay<00:04:37.039> which

00:04:37.779 --> 00:04:37.789 
and then this is the finger Bay which

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:39.070 
and then this is the finger Bay which
stretches<00:04:38.090> down<00:04:38.360> there<00:04:38.600> it's<00:04:38.780> pretty<00:04:38.900> about

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.080 
stretches down there it's pretty about

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.080 
stretches down there it's pretty about
three<00:04:39.289> quarts<00:04:39.470> of<00:04:39.590> an<00:04:39.680> 8<00:04:39.770> year<00:04:39.979> and<00:04:40.940> that's

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.090 
three quarts of an 8 year and that's

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:41.680 
three quarts of an 8 year and that's
where<00:04:41.210> I've<00:04:41.270> got<00:04:41.419> me

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:41.690 
where I've got me

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:45.159 
where I've got me
third<00:04:42.289> rot<00:04:42.880> part<00:04:43.880> of<00:04:43.940> the<00:04:44.060> led<00:04:44.389> ran<00:04:44.630> basically

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:45.169 
third rot part of the led ran basically

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:46.719 
third rot part of the led ran basically
well<00:04:45.800> not<00:04:45.950> the<00:04:46.010> base<00:04:46.190> of<00:04:46.340> the<00:04:46.400> finger<00:04:46.580> Weber

00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:46.729 
well not the base of the finger Weber

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:48.310 
well not the base of the finger Weber
off<00:04:46.970> way<00:04:47.180> down<00:04:47.360> in<00:04:47.570> the<00:04:47.630> day<00:04:47.750> class<00:04:47.930> or<00:04:48.110> a<00:04:48.139> few

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:48.320 
off way down in the day class or a few

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:49.270 
off way down in the day class or a few
fish<00:04:48.500> when<00:04:48.650> I<00:04:48.680> was<00:04:48.800> in<00:04:48.919> the<00:04:48.979> feature<00:04:49.130> with

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.280 
fish when I was in the feature with

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:52.690 
fish when I was in the feature with
advance<00:04:49.810> just<00:04:50.810> showing<00:04:51.310> which<00:04:52.310> was<00:04:52.430> probably

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:52.700 
advance just showing which was probably

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:54.969 
advance just showing which was probably
major<00:04:53.060> mistake<00:04:53.450> because<00:04:54.080> then<00:04:54.289> I'm<00:04:54.440> about<00:04:54.889> an

00:04:54.969 --> 00:04:54.979 
major mistake because then I'm about an

00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:57.279 
major mistake because then I'm about an
hour<00:04:55.100> later<00:04:55.340> I<00:04:55.460> got<00:04:55.580> a<00:04:55.639> few<00:04:55.789> line<00:04:55.970> is<00:04:56.180> on<00:04:56.300> on

00:04:57.279 --> 00:04:57.289 
hour later I got a few line is on on

00:04:57.289 --> 00:04:59.400 
hour later I got a few line is on on
this<00:04:57.470> rod<00:04:57.650> as<00:04:57.770> the<00:04:57.860> fish<00:04:58.010> make<00:04:58.220> their<00:04:58.340> way<00:04:58.430> out

00:04:59.400 --> 00:04:59.410 
this rod as the fish make their way out

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:01.840 
this rod as the fish make their way out
so<00:05:00.410> I<00:05:00.470> probably<00:05:00.650> probably<00:05:01.220> made<00:05:01.490> a<00:05:01.520> bit<00:05:01.700> of<00:05:01.729> an

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:01.850 
so I probably probably made a bit of an

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:04.600 
so I probably probably made a bit of an
error<00:05:01.970> on<00:05:02.120> that<00:05:02.150> one<00:05:03.100> but<00:05:04.100> I've<00:05:04.190> got<00:05:04.310> one<00:05:04.400> night

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:04.610 
error on that one but I've got one night

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:08.320 
error on that one but I've got one night
left<00:05:04.820> and<00:05:05.860> cific<00:05:06.860> and<00:05:06.979> make<00:05:07.070> amends<00:05:07.370> I<00:05:07.639> don't

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:08.330 
left and cific and make amends I don't

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:09.719 
left and cific and make amends I don't
know<00:05:08.389> if<00:05:08.450> I'm<00:05:08.539> going<00:05:08.630> to<00:05:08.690> catch<00:05:08.810> or<00:05:09.020> not<00:05:09.139> but

00:05:09.719 --> 00:05:09.729 
know if I'm going to catch or not but

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:13.030 
know if I'm going to catch or not but
we'll<00:05:10.729> see<00:05:10.910> what<00:05:10.970> happens
