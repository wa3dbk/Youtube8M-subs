does<00:00:57.690> it<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.020> QAM<00:00:58.410> tuner<00:00:58.440> basically<00:00:59.399> lets<00:00:59.579> you

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
does it the QAM tuner basically lets you

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.639 
does it the QAM tuner basically lets you
have<00:01:00.359> a<00:01:00.390> cable<00:01:00.809> and<00:01:00.930> put<00:01:01.050> it<00:01:01.140> right<00:01:01.260> in<00:01:01.410> you<00:01:01.500> can

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
have a cable and put it right in you can

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:02.540 
have a cable and put it right in you can
change<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:01.890> channels<00:01:02.190> and<00:01:02.280> you<00:01:02.340> don't<00:01:02.460> have

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
change the channels and you don't have

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.910 
change the channels and you don't have
to<00:01:02.640> worry<00:01:02.789> about<00:01:02.969> having<00:01:03.480> a<00:01:03.539> cable<00:01:03.809> box<00:01:04.110> now

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
to worry about having a cable box now

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.399 
to worry about having a cable box now
this<00:01:05.220> has<00:01:05.489> a<00:01:05.519> very<00:01:06.030> cool<00:01:06.450> system<00:01:06.930> and<00:01:07.229> it's

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
this has a very cool system and it's

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.260 
this has a very cool system and it's
called<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.890> Dynalite<00:01:08.400> dynamic<00:01:09.060> backlight

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
called the Dynalite dynamic backlight

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.240 
called the Dynalite dynamic backlight
control<00:01:09.990> basically<00:01:10.560> what<00:01:10.770> that<00:01:10.799> does<00:01:10.920> is<00:01:11.220> that

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
control basically what that does is that

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.520 
control basically what that does is that
rather<00:01:11.520> than<00:01:11.700> giving<00:01:11.909> you<00:01:11.970> a<00:01:12.000> set<00:01:12.420> contrast<00:01:13.170> it

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
rather than giving you a set contrast it

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.140 
rather than giving you a set contrast it
automatically<00:01:14.310> changes<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:14.790> levels<00:01:15.030> of

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
automatically changes the levels of

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.789 
automatically changes the levels of
brightness<00:01:15.509> and<00:01:15.540> of<00:01:15.689> contrast<00:01:16.170> depending<00:01:16.680> on

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
brightness and of contrast depending on

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.499 
brightness and of contrast depending on
what<00:01:17.400> type<00:01:17.549> of<00:01:17.580> video<00:01:17.880> is<00:01:17.939> coming<00:01:18.299> in<00:01:18.420> it

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
what type of video is coming in it

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.510 
what type of video is coming in it
actually<00:01:18.900> monitors<00:01:19.350> each<00:01:19.500> individual<00:01:20.310> frame

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
actually monitors each individual frame

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.030 
actually monitors each individual frame
of<00:01:20.670> video<00:01:20.759> as<00:01:21.060> it<00:01:21.270> comes<00:01:21.420> into<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.689> television

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:22.040 
of video as it comes into the television

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.560 
of video as it comes into the television
judges<00:01:23.040> it<00:01:23.159> and<00:01:23.310> says<00:01:23.670> well<00:01:24.000> this<00:01:24.119> is<00:01:24.270> a<00:01:24.299> dark

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
judges it and says well this is a dark

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:25.580 
judges it and says well this is a dark
image<00:01:24.840> I'm<00:01:24.960> gonna<00:01:25.080> increase<00:01:25.259> the<00:01:25.439> brightness

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
image I'm gonna increase the brightness

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:26.630 
image I'm gonna increase the brightness
a<00:01:25.770> little<00:01:25.830> bit<00:01:26.040> to<00:01:26.130> make<00:01:26.250> it<00:01:26.280> look<00:01:26.460> a<00:01:26.520> little

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
a little bit to make it look a little

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.010 
a little bit to make it look a little
nicer<00:01:26.820> and<00:01:27.119> that's<00:01:27.450> going<00:01:27.540> to<00:01:27.600> give<00:01:27.750> you<00:01:27.840> an

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
nicer and that's going to give you an

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.050 
nicer and that's going to give you an
incredible<00:01:28.710> picture<00:01:29.100> quality<00:01:29.610> now<00:01:29.700> on<00:01:29.820> top<00:01:29.939> of

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
incredible picture quality now on top of

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.910 
incredible picture quality now on top of
that<00:01:30.150> it<00:01:30.299> has<00:01:30.329> a<00:01:30.450> synesthete<00:01:31.020> LCD<00:01:31.590> panel

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
that it has a synesthete LCD panel

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.620 
that it has a synesthete LCD panel
that's<00:01:32.369> going<00:01:32.490> to<00:01:32.549> get<00:01:32.880> rid<00:01:33.030> of<00:01:33.060> all<00:01:33.390> the

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
that's going to get rid of all the

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.960 
that's going to get rid of all the
motion<00:01:33.990> blur<00:01:34.079> in<00:01:34.740> your<00:01:34.950> fast-moving<00:01:35.430> sports

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
motion blur in your fast-moving sports

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.030 
motion blur in your fast-moving sports
and<00:01:36.210> action<00:01:36.570> video<00:01:37.079> so<00:01:37.229> basically<00:01:37.590> you're

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
and action video so basically you're

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.859 
and action video so basically you're
watching<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.400> football<00:01:38.579> game<00:01:38.729> somebody<00:01:39.450> goes

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
watching the football game somebody goes

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.330 
watching the football game somebody goes
across<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.200> screen<00:01:40.290> really<00:01:40.590> fast<00:01:40.799> you<00:01:41.130> lose

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
across the screen really fast you lose

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.980 
across the screen really fast you lose
all<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:41.670> detail<00:01:42.150> you<00:01:42.180> get<00:01:42.360> motion<00:01:42.750> blur<00:01:42.869> with
