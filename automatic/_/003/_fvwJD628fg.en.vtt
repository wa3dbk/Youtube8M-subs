00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
snow good is it no need to let loads of

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.370 
snow good is it no need to let loads of
them<00:00:17.160> off<00:00:17.340> so<00:00:18.210> with<00:00:18.359> that<00:00:18.480> in<00:00:18.630> mind<00:00:18.660> I'm<00:00:19.230> gonna

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
them off so with that in mind I'm gonna

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.080 
them off so with that in mind I'm gonna
round<00:00:19.740> the<00:00:19.890> back<00:00:20.070> and<00:00:20.100> white<00:00:20.369> Toyota<00:00:20.699> Hilux

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
round the back and white Toyota Hilux

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.240 
round the back and white Toyota Hilux
first<00:00:21.600> bad<00:00:22.080> boys<00:00:22.320> and<00:00:22.590> let<00:00:22.680> them<00:00:22.800> all<00:00:22.949> off<00:00:23.100> at

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
first bad boys and let them all off at

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.550 
first bad boys and let them all off at
once<00:00:23.279> which<00:00:24.240> means<00:00:24.269> we<00:00:24.689> need<00:00:24.779> a<00:00:24.840> system<00:00:25.199> to

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
once which means we need a system to

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.830 
once which means we need a system to
simultaneously<00:00:26.550> long<00:00:26.789> make<00:00:26.939> nearly<00:00:27.210> 300

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
simultaneously long make nearly 300

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.319 
simultaneously long make nearly 300

rockets all at the same time oh oh
the<00:00:33.329> original<00:00:33.690> idea<00:00:33.750> add<00:00:34.170> row<00:00:34.620> of<00:00:34.770> little<00:00:34.980> tiny

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
the original idea add row of little tiny

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.770 
the original idea add row of little tiny
flames<00:00:35.550> ticking<00:00:35.910> out<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.149> five<00:00:36.360> low<00:00:36.510> right

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
flames ticking out the five low right

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.380 
flames ticking out the five low right
angles<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:37.290> fireworks<00:00:37.800> turn<00:00:38.340> a<00:00:38.370> lever<00:00:38.670> goes

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
angles the fireworks turn a lever goes

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.110 
angles the fireworks turn a lever goes
onto<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.719> fuses<00:00:40.219> they<00:00:41.219> all<00:00:41.370> go<00:00:41.520> off<00:00:41.670> now<00:00:41.850> when

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
onto the fuses they all go off now when

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.819 
onto the fuses they all go off now when
you<00:00:42.210> do<00:00:42.329> five<00:00:42.600> individually<00:00:43.290> it<00:00:43.620> works

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
you do five individually it works

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.529 
you do five individually it works
brilliantly<00:00:44.010> as<00:00:44.399> you<00:00:44.579> can<00:00:44.760> see<00:00:44.940> but<00:00:45.270> when<00:00:45.480> you

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
brilliantly as you can see but when you

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.299 
brilliantly as you can see but when you
try<00:00:45.750> and<00:00:45.870> do<00:00:45.930> loads<00:00:46.170> of<00:00:46.289> them<00:00:46.469> in<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:47.010> back<00:00:47.160> of

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
try and do loads of them in the back of

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:48.830 
try and do loads of them in the back of
the<00:00:47.370> pickup<00:00:47.700> truck<00:00:47.760> with<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.270> sides<00:00:48.480> to<00:00:48.780> stop

the<00:00:49.079> wind<00:00:49.289> you<00:00:50.219> have<00:00:50.250> all<00:00:50.460> sorts<00:00:50.700> of<00:00:50.760> problem

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
the wind you have all sorts of problem

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.910 
the wind you have all sorts of problem
with<00:00:51.149> air<00:00:51.300> supply<00:00:51.690> wandering<00:00:52.289> flames<00:00:52.590> and<00:00:52.860> all

with air supply wandering flames and all
sorts<00:00:53.219> of<00:00:53.280> bits<00:00:53.430> and<00:00:53.579> bobs<00:00:53.820> basically<00:00:54.449> it<00:00:54.660> was

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
sorts of bits and bobs basically it was

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.990 
sorts of bits and bobs basically it was
just<00:00:54.930> a<00:00:55.020> no-go<00:00:55.410> so<00:00:55.890> not<00:00:56.699> going<00:00:56.820> to<00:00:56.910> use

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
just a no-go so not going to use

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.240 
just a no-go so not going to use
electronic<00:00:57.420> matches<00:00:57.930> too<00:00:58.199> expensive<00:00:58.559> and<00:00:58.980> you

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
electronic matches too expensive and you

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.760 
electronic matches too expensive and you
only<00:00:59.370> get<00:00:59.579> one<00:00:59.760> hit<00:01:00.000> let's<00:01:00.989> stir<00:01:01.230> let's<00:01:01.530> lower

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
only get one hit let's stir let's lower

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.460 
only get one hit let's stir let's lower
the<00:01:01.980> bar<00:01:02.190> even<00:01:03.090> more<00:01:03.390> with<00:01:03.809> how<00:01:03.930> low<00:01:04.140> fire

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
the bar even more with how low fire

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.410 
the bar even more with how low fire

regulator<00:01:18.810> in<00:01:19.049> so<00:01:19.200> we<00:01:19.290> can<00:01:19.380> get<00:01:19.470> like<00:01:19.590> a<00:01:19.650> little

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
regulator in so we can get like a little

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.490 
regulator in so we can get like a little
pilot<00:01:20.280> light<00:01:20.990> if<00:01:21.990> I<00:01:22.110> put<00:01:22.350> there

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
pilot light if I put there

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:30.069 
pilot light if I put there
then<00:01:25.500> push<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:26.009> switch<00:01:26.280> and<00:01:27.000> then<00:01:27.150> you<00:01:27.270> get<00:01:27.420> it
