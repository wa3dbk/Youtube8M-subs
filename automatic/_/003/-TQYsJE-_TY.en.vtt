00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
can see one one piece up there is being

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.070 
can see one one piece up there is being
supported<00:01:32.740> by<00:01:32.770> a<00:01:32.890> crane<00:01:33.130> right<00:01:33.310> now<00:01:34.080> because

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:35.080 
supported by a crane right now because

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.840 
supported by a crane right now because
they<00:01:35.380> were<00:01:35.440> planning<00:01:36.040> on<00:01:36.280> getting<00:01:36.460> that<00:01:36.640> done

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:36.850 
they were planning on getting that done

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:38.240 
they were planning on getting that done
today

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
today

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.650 
today
the<00:01:39.250> other<00:01:39.399> piece<00:01:39.670> they<00:01:39.910> have<00:01:40.060> a<00:01:40.090> new<00:01:40.270> piece<00:01:40.479> on

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:40.660 
the other piece they have a new piece on

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:46.800 
the other piece they have a new piece on
top<00:01:40.869> of<00:01:40.990> that<00:01:41.080> one<00:01:41.259> there<00:01:41.470> too

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.440 

and<00:01:47.110> I<00:01:47.950> think<00:01:48.040> they<00:01:48.340> have<00:01:48.490> a<00:01:48.520> few<00:01:48.820> more<00:01:48.940> support

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
and I think they have a few more support

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:50.760 
and I think they have a few more support
something<00:01:49.720> about<00:01:50.020> it<00:01:50.110> looks<00:01:50.290> like<00:01:50.440> there's<00:01:50.740> a

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770 
something about it looks like there's a

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.010 
something about it looks like there's a
lot<00:01:50.950> more<00:01:51.130> sports<00:01:51.520> over<00:01:51.850> there<00:01:52.000> I<00:01:52.180> could<00:01:52.720> be

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
lot more sports over there I could be

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.760 
lot more sports over there I could be
wrong<00:01:53.200> the<00:01:53.500> figures<00:01:53.799> of<00:01:53.890> the<00:01:54.010> angle<00:01:54.369> but<00:01:54.520> you

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
wrong the figures of the angle but you

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.020 
wrong the figures of the angle but you
can<00:01:56.770> see<00:01:57.070> through<00:01:57.250> the<00:01:57.340> trees<00:01:57.610> that<00:01:57.909> there<00:01:58.119> are

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
can see through the trees that there are

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.120 
can see through the trees that there are
several<00:02:01.030> supports<00:02:01.840> out<00:02:02.020> there<00:02:02.259> there's<00:02:02.979> some

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
several supports out there there's some
