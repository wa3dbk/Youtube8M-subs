00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
so what I've noticed right away was that

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.470 
so what I've noticed right away was that
the<00:00:42.629> no<00:00:42.809> three<00:00:43.170> images<00:00:43.410> actually<00:00:44.070> is<00:00:44.879> a<00:00:44.910> lot

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
the no three images actually is a lot

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.200 
the no three images actually is a lot
brighter<00:00:45.780> or<00:00:46.289> more<00:00:46.320> exposed<00:00:47.129> compared<00:00:48.000> to<00:00:48.120> the

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
brighter or more exposed compared to the

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.529 
brighter or more exposed compared to the
5s<00:00:48.660> by<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.500> way<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.890> 5s<00:00:50.309> has<00:00:50.610> an<00:00:50.969> 8<00:00:51.239> megapixel

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
5s by the way the 5s has an 8 megapixel

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.430 
5s by the way the 5s has an 8 megapixel
camera<00:00:52.170> while<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:53.070> note<00:00:53.460> 3<00:00:53.699> has<00:00:53.730> a<00:00:53.940> higher<00:00:54.449> 13

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
camera while the note 3 has a higher 13

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:05.690 
camera while the note 3 has a higher 13
megapixel<00:00:56.070> camera<00:01:03.979> in<00:01:04.979> this<00:01:05.309> comparison

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
megapixel camera in this comparison

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.140 
megapixel camera in this comparison
image<00:01:06.210> is<00:01:06.479> clear<00:01:06.900> that<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.350> 5s<00:01:08.010> has<00:01:08.610> a<00:01:08.670> more

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
image is clear that the 5s has a more

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.320 
image is clear that the 5s has a more
saturated<00:01:09.450> or<00:01:10.140> colorful<00:01:10.740> image<00:01:11.490> compared<00:01:12.240> to

saturated or colorful image compared to

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.480 
saturated or colorful image compared to
the<00:01:12.450> no.3<00:01:12.900> but<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:13.590> note<00:01:13.770> 3<00:01:13.979> does<00:01:14.220> have<00:01:14.460> a

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
the no.3 but the note 3 does have a

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.580 
the no.3 but the note 3 does have a
sharper<00:01:15.210> video<00:01:15.479> because<00:01:15.990> of<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.380> higher

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
sharper video because of the higher

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:32.260 
sharper video because of the higher
resolution

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270

pictures taken on both devices as you

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.779 
pictures taken on both devices as you
can<00:01:42.959> see<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.259> 5s<00:01:43.740> does<00:01:44.310> take<00:01:44.610> some

00:01:44.779 --> 00:01:44.789 
can see the 5s does take some

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:47.809 
can see the 5s does take some
high-quality<00:01:45.229> panoramic<00:01:46.229> photos<00:01:46.649> but<00:01:47.399> it<00:01:47.610> is

00:01:47.809 --> 00:01:47.819 
high-quality panoramic photos but it is

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:50.690 
high-quality panoramic photos but it is
a<00:01:47.850> bit<00:01:48.209> smaller<00:01:48.539> compared<00:01:49.079> to<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.560> note<00:01:50.189> 3<00:01:50.489> on

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
a bit smaller compared to the note 3 on

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.089 
a bit smaller compared to the note 3 on
the<00:01:51.209> samsung<00:01:51.569> galaxy<00:01:51.599> note<00:01:51.989> 3<00:01:52.170> you<00:01:52.649> actually

00:01:53.089 --> 00:01:53.099 
the samsung galaxy note 3 you actually

00:01:53.099 --> 00:01:55.399 
the samsung galaxy note 3 you actually
do<00:01:53.250> a<00:01:53.280> full<00:01:53.610> spin<00:01:53.970> when<00:01:54.299> you<00:01:54.390> take<00:01:54.630> a<00:01:54.659> panoramic

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
do a full spin when you take a panoramic

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.309 
do a full spin when you take a panoramic
picture<00:01:55.729> so<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:56.909> area<00:01:57.270> of<00:01:57.509> the<00:01:57.720> image<00:01:57.899> is

00:01:58.309 --> 00:01:58.319 
picture so the area of the image is

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:01.639 
picture so the area of the image is
bigger<00:01:59.009> and<00:01:59.369> it's<00:01:59.819> actually<00:02:00.689> longer<00:02:00.899> than<00:02:01.140> the

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
bigger and it's actually longer than the

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.669 
bigger and it's actually longer than the
5s<00:02:01.920> and<00:02:02.459> here's<00:02:03.360> a<00:02:03.420> picture<00:02:03.659> I<00:02:03.780> took<00:02:03.840> using<00:02:04.500> the

00:02:04.669 --> 00:02:04.679 
5s and here's a picture I took using the

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:07.669 
5s and here's a picture I took using the
note<00:02:04.860> 3<00:02:05.159> surround<00:02:05.729> shot<00:02:06.239> feature<00:02:06.569> in<00:02:06.959> the

00:02:07.669 --> 00:02:07.679 
note 3 surround shot feature in the

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:08.839 
note 3 surround shot feature in the
camera<00:02:08.130> application

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
camera application

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.500 
camera application
so<00:02:09.360> it<00:02:09.479> basically<00:02:09.599> takes<00:02:10.110> a<00:02:10.400> 360-degree

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
so it basically takes a 360-degree

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.330 
so it basically takes a 360-degree
panoramic<00:02:12.510> photo<00:02:12.750> alright<00:02:13.590> here<00:02:13.829> are<00:02:13.860> some

panoramic photo alright here are some
video<00:02:14.730> footage<00:02:15.000> it's<00:02:15.840> quite<00:02:16.349> difficult<00:02:16.560> to

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
video footage it's quite difficult to

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.949 
video footage it's quite difficult to
say<00:02:17.160> which<00:02:17.400> one<00:02:17.610> is<00:02:17.640> better<00:02:18.030> it's<00:02:18.420> all<00:02:18.629> up<00:02:18.780> to

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
say which one is better it's all up to

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:22.190

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:45.520 

if<00:03:44.330> you<00:03:44.480> guys<00:03:44.600> don't<00:03:44.930> know<00:03:45.020> yet

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
if you guys don't know yet

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:49.300 
if you guys don't know yet
the<00:03:45.650> no.3<00:03:46.190> also<00:03:46.610> takes<00:03:46.910> 4k<00:03:47.690> videos<00:03:48.140> so<00:03:48.830> this<00:03:49.010> is

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
the no.3 also takes 4k videos so this is

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:53.320 
the no.3 also takes 4k videos so this is
at<00:03:49.700> a<00:03:49.760> resolution<00:03:50.270> which<00:03:50.720> is<00:03:51.160> 2160p<00:03:52.160> so<00:03:53.060> it's

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:53.330 
at a resolution which is 2160p so it's

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:57.340 
at a resolution which is 2160p so it's
double<00:03:53.810> 1080p<00:03:54.760> but<00:03:55.760> of<00:03:56.000> course<00:03:56.570> you<00:03:57.020> probably

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:57.350 
double 1080p but of course you probably

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:00.580 
double 1080p but of course you probably
don't<00:03:57.890> have<00:03:57.950> a<00:03:58.100> 4k<00:03:58.700> monitor<00:03:58.910> or<00:03:59.570> a<00:03:59.630> 4k<00:04:00.200> TV<00:04:00.560> to

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590 
don't have a 4k monitor or a 4k TV to

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:03.790 
don't have a 4k monitor or a 4k TV to
display<00:04:01.220> this<00:04:01.550> on<00:04:01.790> but<00:04:02.600> you<00:04:02.810> can<00:04:03.050> crop<00:04:03.350> this

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:03.800 
display this on but you can crop this

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:07.449 
display this on but you can crop this
down<00:04:04.160> to<00:04:04.490> a<00:04:04.520> 1080p<00:04:05.240> HD<00:04:05.930> size<00:04:06.200> so<00:04:06.950> you<00:04:07.010> can<00:04:07.250> zoom

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:07.459 
down to a 1080p HD size so you can zoom

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:09.520 
down to a 1080p HD size so you can zoom
in<00:04:07.640> and<00:04:07.850> you<00:04:08.180> can<00:04:08.390> still<00:04:08.630> maintain<00:04:08.840> that<00:04:09.290> high

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 
in and you can still maintain that high

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:17.260

doesn't have image stabilization so it's

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:22.420
