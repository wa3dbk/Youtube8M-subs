00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
tragedy to have a student you know come

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.450 
tragedy to have a student you know come
to<00:00:17.550> college<00:00:18.590> say<00:00:19.590> I<00:00:19.620> want<00:00:19.860> to<00:00:19.890> be<00:00:19.980> a<00:00:20.010> biology

to college say I want to be a biology
major<00:00:20.490> for<00:00:20.970> whatever<00:00:21.210> reason<00:00:21.510> I<00:00:21.600> want<00:00:21.780> to<00:00:21.810> be<00:00:21.930> a

science major and not find out until

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.540 
science major and not find out until
maybe<00:00:24.540> their<00:00:24.780> senior<00:00:25.230> year<00:00:25.680> that<00:00:26.130> actually

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
maybe their senior year that actually

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.190 
maybe their senior year that actually
the<00:00:26.790> thing<00:00:26.940> that<00:00:27.120> biologists<00:00:27.720> really<00:00:27.990> do

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:28.200 
the thing that biologists really do

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.100 
the thing that biologists really do
isn't<00:00:29.100> very<00:00:29.460> appealing<00:00:29.580> to<00:00:30.120> them<00:00:30.360> they<00:00:31.050> were

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:31.110 
isn't very appealing to them they were

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:32.959 
isn't very appealing to them they were
attracted<00:00:31.770> to<00:00:31.800> biology<00:00:32.369> because<00:00:32.550> they<00:00:32.910> were

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
attracted to biology because they were

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.529 
attracted to biology because they were
really<00:00:33.210> good<00:00:33.510> at<00:00:33.780> doing<00:00:34.670> biology<00:00:35.670> and<00:00:36.179> in<00:00:36.449> a

00:00:36.529 --> 00:00:36.539 
really good at doing biology and in a

00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:38.720 
really good at doing biology and in a
course<00:00:36.870> structure<00:00:37.469> but<00:00:37.739> throw<00:00:38.399> them<00:00:38.519> into<00:00:38.609> a

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
course structure but throw them into a

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.009 
course structure but throw them into a
laboratory<00:00:38.969> where<00:00:39.570> there's<00:00:39.719> a<00:00:39.809> lot<00:00:39.989> more

open-endedness to the problems you have

00:00:42.839 --> 00:00:44.119 
open-endedness to the problems you have
these<00:00:42.899> a<00:00:42.989> lot<00:00:43.109> more<00:00:43.260> creativity<00:00:43.679> to<00:00:43.980> solve

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
these a lot more creativity to solve

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.950 
these a lot more creativity to solve
your<00:00:44.339> problems<00:00:44.640> you<00:00:45.359> know<00:00:45.449> they're<00:00:45.600> just<00:00:45.629> lost

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
your problems you know they're just lost

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.360 
your problems you know they're just lost
and<00:00:46.230> they<00:00:46.289> don't<00:00:46.379> really<00:00:46.679> like<00:00:46.890> it<00:00:47.070> and<00:00:47.190> so<00:00:47.309> to

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
and they don't really like it and so to

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.090 
and they don't really like it and so to
me<00:00:47.550> it<00:00:47.640> seems<00:00:47.850> almost<00:00:48.120> like<00:00:48.679> you<00:00:49.679> know<00:00:49.800> false

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
me it seems almost like you know false

them<00:00:56.010> really<00:00:56.249> do<00:00:56.550> it<00:00:56.730> until<00:00:57.719> made<00:00:57.989> either

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
them really do it until made either

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.599 
them really do it until made either
senior<00:00:58.679> year<00:00:58.920> and<00:00:59.069> they<00:00:59.159> do<00:00:59.219> an<00:00:59.429> independent

senior year and they do an independent

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.610 
senior year and they do an independent
research<00:01:00.179> project<00:01:00.690> and<00:01:00.839> actually<00:01:01.199> get<00:01:01.350> to<00:01:01.379> do

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
research project and actually get to do

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:02.599 
research project and actually get to do
something<00:01:01.890> similar<00:01:02.219> to<00:01:02.339> what<00:01:02.399> we're<00:01:02.579> doing

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
something similar to what we're doing

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:07.040 
something similar to what we're doing
and<00:01:02.819> violent<00:01:03.149> to<00:01:03.210> diesel<00:01:05.420> the<00:01:06.420> thing<00:01:06.630> I<00:01:06.780> like

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:07.050 
and violent to diesel the thing I like

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:09.080 
and violent to diesel the thing I like
about<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.380> one<00:01:07.500> fifties<00:01:07.830> is<00:01:08.010> that<00:01:08.250> that<00:01:09.060> I

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
about the one fifties is that that I

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.630 
about the one fifties is that that I
think<00:01:09.180> is<00:01:09.450> special<00:01:09.600> is<00:01:10.280> you<00:01:11.280> learn<00:01:11.460> to<00:01:11.580> work

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
think is special is you learn to work

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.820 
think is special is you learn to work
with<00:01:11.850> people<00:01:12.180> and<00:01:12.720> science<00:01:13.350> doesn't<00:01:13.530> just

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
with people and science doesn't just

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.280 
with people and science doesn't just
happen<00:01:14.240> one<00:01:15.240> person<00:01:15.660> looking<00:01:16.110> in<00:01:16.200> a

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
happen one person looking in a

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.870 
happen one person looking in a
microscope<00:01:16.770> discovering<00:01:17.250> things<00:01:17.430> but<00:01:17.790> it

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
microscope discovering things but it

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.090 
microscope discovering things but it
happens<00:01:18.240> with<00:01:18.420> people<00:01:18.630> there's<00:01:19.380> like<00:01:19.620> 10<00:01:19.920> or

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
happens with people there's like 10 or

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:28.899 
happens with people there's like 10 or
12<00:01:20.400> different<00:01:20.730> 150s

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:28.909 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:32.030 

so<00:01:29.909> students<00:01:30.360> can<00:01:30.509> pick<00:01:30.869> the<00:01:31.229> 150<00:01:31.710> that<00:01:31.890> they

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
so students can pick the 150 that they

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.190 
so students can pick the 150 that they
feel<00:01:32.310> that<00:01:33.000> they<00:01:33.210> identify<00:01:33.750> with<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:34.049> most

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
feel that they identify with the most

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.539 
feel that they identify with the most
and<00:01:34.500> then<00:01:35.310> they<00:01:35.549> buy<00:01:36.119> into<00:01:36.360> it<00:01:36.659> right<00:01:36.810> away<00:01:37.549> so-

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
and then they buy into it right away so-

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.749 
and then they buy into it right away so-
called<00:01:38.759> language<00:01:39.330> of<00:01:39.450> neurons<00:01:39.810> and<00:01:40.460> the<00:01:41.460> sort

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
called language of neurons and the sort

how cells talk to each other in this way
they<00:02:05.310> use<00:02:05.429> a<00:02:05.460> chemical<00:02:05.729> message<00:02:06.450> that<00:02:06.990> gets

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
they use a chemical message that gets

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.660 
they use a chemical message that gets
transmitted<00:02:07.679> from<00:02:07.799> one<00:02:07.860> cell<00:02:08.220> to<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.429> other

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
transmitted from one cell to the other

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.639 
transmitted from one cell to the other
and<00:02:09.060> basically<00:02:09.509> tells<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:10.019> receiving<00:02:10.440> cell

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
and basically tells the receiving cell

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.220 
and basically tells the receiving cell
what<00:02:11.250> to<00:02:11.400> do<00:02:11.549> whether<00:02:11.760> to<00:02:12.000> become<00:02:12.840> more<00:02:13.019> active

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
what to do whether to become more active

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.470 
what to do whether to become more active
or<00:02:13.650> to<00:02:13.739> become<00:02:13.890> less<00:02:14.250> active<00:02:14.489> and<00:02:15.330> that's

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
or to become less active and that's

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.150 
or to become less active and that's
happening<00:02:15.870> all<00:02:15.989> the<00:02:16.019> time<00:02:16.230> in<00:02:16.680> fact<00:02:16.890> in<00:02:17.100> the

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
happening all the time in fact in the

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.759 
happening all the time in fact in the
human<00:02:17.459> brain<00:02:17.610> that's<00:02:17.970> happening<00:02:18.420> at

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:18.769 
human brain that's happening at

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:22.220 
human brain that's happening at
trillions<00:02:19.769> of<00:02:20.069> synapses<00:02:20.640> in<00:02:21.299> the<00:02:21.630> brain<00:02:21.750> sort

trillions of synapses in the brain sort
of<00:02:22.380> simultaneously

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.380 

as<00:02:48.620> usual<00:02:49.280> it's<00:02:49.550> it's<00:02:49.850> it's<00:02:50.210> really

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
as usual it's it's it's really

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.650 
as usual it's it's it's really
impressive<00:02:50.720> I<00:02:51.230> mean<00:02:51.590> it<00:02:51.710> you<00:02:51.890> have<00:02:52.040> to<00:02:52.190> kind<00:02:52.310> of

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
impressive I mean it you have to kind of

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.150 
impressive I mean it you have to kind of
keep<00:02:53.660> pinching<00:02:53.960> yourself<00:02:54.200> and<00:02:54.680> saying<00:02:54.860> you

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
keep pinching yourself and saying you

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.160 
keep pinching yourself and saying you
know<00:02:55.220> these<00:02:55.400> really<00:02:55.760> are<00:02:55.790> kids<00:02:56.240> who<00:02:56.510> prior<00:02:56.900> to

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
know these really are kids who prior to

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:59.500 
know these really are kids who prior to
this<00:02:57.290> semester<00:02:57.830> had<00:02:58.070> done<00:02:58.340> nothing<00:02:59.060> like<00:02:59.450> this

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
this semester had done nothing like this

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.990 
this semester had done nothing like this
before<00:02:59.840> had<00:03:00.290> really<00:03:00.830> taken<00:03:00.950> any<00:03:01.250> college

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
before had really taken any college

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.450 
before had really taken any college
level<00:03:02.360> science<00:03:03.230> classes<00:03:03.590> biology<00:03:04.220> classes

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:04.460 
level science classes biology classes

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:06.580 
level science classes biology classes
and<00:03:04.850> then<00:03:04.970> you<00:03:05.690> see<00:03:05.840> something<00:03:06.110> that's<00:03:06.380> not

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
and then you see something that's not

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.350 
and then you see something that's not
that<00:03:06.860> much<00:03:06.920> different<00:03:07.610> than<00:03:07.790> what<00:03:08.060> you<00:03:08.150> see

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360 
that much different than what you see

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:09.880 
that much different than what you see
when<00:03:08.540> you<00:03:08.690> go<00:03:08.810> off<00:03:08.960> to<00:03:08.990> your<00:03:09.380> professional

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890 
when you go off to your professional

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:15.370 
when you go off to your professional
meetings<00:03:10.250> and<00:03:10.630> and<00:03:11.630> do<00:03:11.870> this<00:03:14.110> one<00:03:15.110> of<00:03:15.170> the<00:03:15.260> cool

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
meetings and and do this one of the cool

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.290 
meetings and and do this one of the cool
things<00:03:15.590> is<00:03:15.680> that<00:03:15.830> we've<00:03:15.920> all<00:03:16.130> been<00:03:16.340> working<00:03:17.090> on

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:17.300 
things is that we've all been working on

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:18.340 
things is that we've all been working on

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:18.350 
the same things like how to write an

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:20.890 
the same things like how to write an
abstract<00:03:18.500> how<00:03:19.190> to<00:03:19.250> ask<00:03:19.850> scientific<00:03:20.480> questions

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
abstract how to ask scientific questions

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.480 
abstract how to ask scientific questions
how<00:03:21.530> to<00:03:21.590> create<00:03:21.800> a<00:03:21.830> high<00:03:21.920> pot<00:03:22.130> a<00:03:22.160> working

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:22.490 
how to create a high pot a working

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:24.370 
how to create a high pot a working
hypothesis<00:03:23.120> and<00:03:23.360> create<00:03:23.750> an<00:03:23.810> experiment<00:03:24.290> that

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:24.380 
hypothesis and create an experiment that

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:26.860 
hypothesis and create an experiment that
helps<00:03:25.310> us<00:03:25.400> prove<00:03:25.580> the<00:03:25.670> apophysis<00:03:26.120> or<00:03:26.390> disprove

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
helps us prove the apophysis or disprove

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.500 
helps us prove the apophysis or disprove
the<00:03:26.990> hypothesis<00:03:27.470> I'm<00:03:28.070> hopefully<00:03:28.490> not<00:03:28.640> but<00:03:29.330> um

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
the hypothesis I'm hopefully not but um

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.300 
the hypothesis I'm hopefully not but um
so<00:03:29.870> all<00:03:30.140> the<00:03:30.290> people<00:03:30.500> have<00:03:30.590> the<00:03:30.680> same<00:03:30.920> like

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
so all the people have the same like

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.700 
so all the people have the same like
tools<00:03:31.610> in<00:03:31.880> the<00:03:31.970> same<00:03:32.120> structure<00:03:32.480> but<00:03:32.870> are<00:03:33.530> all

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:33.710 
tools in the same structure but are all

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:34.780 
tools in the same structure but are all
coming<00:03:33.920> at<00:03:34.040> it<00:03:34.100> from<00:03:34.220> really<00:03:34.490> different

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
coming at it from really different

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:36.610 
coming at it from really different
places<00:03:35.000> so<00:03:35.420> it's<00:03:35.600> been<00:03:35.990> really<00:03:36.140> cool<00:03:36.380> like

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
places so it's been really cool like

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.320 
places so it's been really cool like
there's<00:03:37.100> people<00:03:37.190> working<00:03:37.550> on<00:03:37.610> like<00:03:37.820> sunscreen

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:38.330 
there's people working on like sunscreen

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:41.080 
there's people working on like sunscreen
and<00:03:38.600> radiation<00:03:39.080> or<00:03:39.440> like<00:03:40.160> how<00:03:40.370> hermit<00:03:40.910> crabs

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
and radiation or like how hermit crabs

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.030 
and radiation or like how hermit crabs
walk<00:03:41.330> up<00:03:41.480> hills<00:03:41.720> and<00:03:42.260> I<00:03:42.560> don't<00:03:42.770> know<00:03:42.830> so<00:03:42.980> that's

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
walk up hills and I don't know so that's

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.870 
walk up hills and I don't know so that's
been<00:03:43.220> really<00:03:43.280> cool<00:03:44.710> it<00:03:45.710> looks<00:03:45.980> good<00:03:46.370> right<00:03:46.670> now

how they're trying to think like a

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:07.090 
how they're trying to think like a
scientist<00:04:04.340> because<00:04:04.489> I<00:04:04.850> remember<00:04:05.420> back<00:04:06.080> in<00:04:06.110> 150

scientist because I remember back in 150
days<00:04:07.130> and<00:04:07.640> we're<00:04:08.209> all<00:04:08.270> trying<00:04:09.080> to<00:04:09.200> wrap<00:04:09.500> our

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:11.630 
heads around how to do a project and

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:13.690 
heads around how to do a project and
actually<00:04:12.530> seeing<00:04:12.709> it<00:04:12.830> come<00:04:13.010> to<00:04:13.130> fruition<00:04:13.340> is

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:13.700 
actually seeing it come to fruition is

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.599 
actually seeing it come to fruition is
really<00:04:14.000> a<00:04:14.209> cool<00:04:14.780> thing<00:04:14.840> to<00:04:15.020> do<00:04:15.340> if<00:04:16.340> they<00:04:16.549> see

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:16.609 
really a cool thing to do if they see

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:18.670 
really a cool thing to do if they see
somebody<00:04:17.060> who<00:04:17.390> get<00:04:17.540> a<00:04:17.570> project<00:04:18.109> looking<00:04:18.530> at

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:18.680 
somebody who get a project looking at

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.699 
somebody who get a project looking at
let's<00:04:19.340> say<00:04:19.519> joint<00:04:19.880> angles<00:04:20.330> in<00:04:20.540> goats<00:04:20.870> and<00:04:21.230> they

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:21.709 
let's say joint angles in goats and they

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:23.680 
let's say joint angles in goats and they
did<00:04:21.859> a<00:04:21.890> project<00:04:22.130> on<00:04:22.460> sheep<00:04:22.820> last<00:04:23.120> year<00:04:23.390> they're

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
did a project on sheep last year they're

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:27.550 
did a project on sheep last year they're
so<00:04:24.020> excited<00:04:25.720> and<00:04:26.720> they<00:04:26.900> know<00:04:27.050> what<00:04:27.080> to<00:04:27.260> ask

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:27.560 
so excited and they know what to ask

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.790 
so excited and they know what to ask
because<00:04:27.860> they<00:04:28.100> know<00:04:28.250> the<00:04:28.400> morphology<00:04:29.090> so

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
because they know the morphology so

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.999 
because they know the morphology so
it's<00:04:30.550> good<00:04:31.229> obviously<00:04:32.229> this<00:04:32.349> represents<00:04:32.949> a

00:04:32.999 --> 00:04:33.009 
it's good obviously this represents a

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:37.660 
it's good obviously this represents a
lot<00:04:33.190> of<00:04:33.340> hard<00:04:33.550> work<00:04:33.639> and

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:37.670 

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:39.850 

commitment<00:04:38.630> to<00:04:38.870> having<00:04:39.230> you<00:04:39.410> know<00:04:39.530> it<00:04:39.590> sort<00:04:39.800> of

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:39.860 
commitment to having you know it sort of

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:41.080 
commitment to having you know it sort of
done<00:04:40.010> this<00:04:40.190> during<00:04:40.340> the<00:04:40.490> semester<00:04:40.880> but<00:04:40.970> I'm

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.090

done this during the semester but I'm
also<00:04:41.270> I<00:04:41.420> really<00:04:42.160> it's<00:04:43.160> really<00:04:43.370> fun<00:04:43.730> to<00:04:43.880> see<00:04:44.090> how

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:48.820 
also I really it's really fun to see how
much<00:04:46.130> this<00:04:46.430> event<00:04:46.850> itself<00:04:47.240> means<00:04:47.690> to<00:04:47.870> them<00:04:47.990> you

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:48.830 
much this event itself means to them you

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:50.650 
much this event itself means to them you
know<00:04:48.950> they're<00:04:49.190> you<00:04:49.940> know<00:04:49.970> they're<00:04:50.060> taking

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:50.660 
know they're you know they're taking

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:52.030 
know they're you know they're taking
this<00:04:50.720> very<00:04:50.900> seriously<00:04:51.320> it's<00:04:51.500> very<00:04:51.680> important

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:52.040 
this very seriously it's very important

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:55.150 
this very seriously it's very important
and<00:04:52.130> that's<00:04:52.220> that's<00:04:53.060> a<00:04:53.240> feature<00:04:53.450> of<00:04:53.930> of<00:04:54.560> this

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:55.160 
and that's that's a feature of of this

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:56.860 
and that's that's a feature of of this
way<00:04:55.460> of<00:04:55.580> teaching<00:04:55.790> that<00:04:56.210> you<00:04:56.360> don't<00:04:56.600> it's

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:56.870 
way of teaching that you don't it's

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:00.100 
way of teaching that you don't it's
really<00:04:57.050> hard<00:04:57.350> to<00:04:57.470> get<00:04:57.590> any<00:04:57.830> other<00:04:58.010> way<00:04:58.990> so<00:04:59.990> the

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:00.110 
really hard to get any other way so the

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:02.500 
really hard to get any other way so the
students<00:05:00.440> really<00:05:00.770> own<00:05:01.040> it<00:05:01.070> I<00:05:01.460> mean<00:05:02.210> this<00:05:02.330> isn't

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:02.510 
students really own it I mean this isn't

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:03.670 
students really own it I mean this isn't
just<00:05:02.810> something<00:05:02.990> that<00:05:03.260> they're<00:05:03.410> doing

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:03.680 
just something that they're doing

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.290 
just something that they're doing
because<00:05:03.830> we<00:05:04.070> tell<00:05:04.490> them<00:05:04.610> they<00:05:04.700> have<00:05:04.730> to<00:05:04.880> do<00:05:05.120> it

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:05.300 
because we tell them they have to do it

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:07.540 
because we tell them they have to do it
they<00:05:05.870> really<00:05:06.230> want<00:05:06.440> to<00:05:06.620> do<00:05:06.770> this<00:05:06.950> because<00:05:07.220> at

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:07.550 
they really want to do this because at

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:09.220 
they really want to do this because at
some<00:05:07.760> point<00:05:07.820> along<00:05:08.120> the<00:05:08.390> way<00:05:08.570> after<00:05:09.110> they

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:09.230 
some point along the way after they

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:11.020 
some point along the way after they
spend<00:05:09.500> enough<00:05:09.710> time<00:05:09.740> on<00:05:09.980> these<00:05:10.280> projects<00:05:10.850> they

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:11.030 
spend enough time on these projects they

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:12.910 
spend enough time on these projects they
really<00:05:11.270> become<00:05:11.480> their<00:05:11.780> projects<00:05:12.500> and<00:05:12.740> that's

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:12.920 
really become their projects and that's

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:15.420 
really become their projects and that's
that's<00:05:13.310> just<00:05:13.580> a<00:05:13.670> whole<00:05:13.790> different<00:05:13.960> way<00:05:14.960> of

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:15.430 
that's just a whole different way of

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:18.040 
that's just a whole different way of
looking<00:05:16.430> at<00:05:16.730> what<00:05:17.210> whatever<00:05:17.360> you're<00:05:17.660> doing<00:05:17.930> if

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:18.050 
looking at what whatever you're doing if

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:19.390 
looking at what whatever you're doing if
it's<00:05:18.200> something<00:05:18.350> you<00:05:18.590> really<00:05:18.620> want<00:05:19.070> and<00:05:19.280> you

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:19.400 
it's something you really want and you

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.280 
it's something you really want and you
think<00:05:19.610> it's<00:05:19.730> important<00:05:20.210> you're<00:05:20.900> going<00:05:21.050> to<00:05:21.110> own

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:21.290 
think it's important you're going to own

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:23.650 
think it's important you're going to own
it<00:05:21.500> and<00:05:21.730> contribute<00:05:22.730> in<00:05:22.850> a<00:05:22.910> way<00:05:23.060> that<00:05:23.270> you<00:05:23.540> know
