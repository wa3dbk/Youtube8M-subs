 three months or three months in my mind 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:43.540
 has been taken with a lot of 70's and 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:45.370
 a lot of feeling because because most 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.570

 the project had the idea of ​​breaststroke a 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.080
 Many years ago, I and my brother

 we had the idea of ​​multilevel but 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:15.910
 very difficult 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.760
 because it's a pretty ambitious project 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:20.650
 and quite a large version of complex 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:22.450
