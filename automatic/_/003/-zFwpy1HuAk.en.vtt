I'm<00:02:42.980> just<00:02:43.370> using<00:02:43.610> a<00:02:44.090> food<00:02:44.480> processor<00:02:44.510> this<00:02:45.380> is

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
I'm just using a food processor this is

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.949 
I'm just using a food processor this is
just<00:02:45.740> a<00:02:45.860> mini<00:02:46.250> Cuisinart<00:02:47.090> which<00:02:47.360> is<00:02:47.540> perfect

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
just a mini Cuisinart which is perfect

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:49.990 
just a mini Cuisinart which is perfect
because<00:02:48.020> it<00:02:48.290> is<00:02:48.410> a<00:02:48.650> rather<00:02:48.980> small<00:02:49.250> amount<00:02:49.730> that

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
because it is a rather small amount that

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.640 
because it is a rather small amount that
you're<00:02:50.150> doing<00:02:50.450> if<00:02:50.780> you<00:02:50.900> have<00:02:51.050> a<00:02:51.080> larger<00:02:51.470> food

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
you're doing if you have a larger food

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.620 
you're doing if you have a larger food
processor<00:02:52.280> or<00:02:52.310> even<00:02:52.670> a<00:02:52.730> blender<00:02:53.120> either<00:02:53.390> one

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
processor or even a blender either one

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.470 
processor or even a blender either one
will<00:02:53.900> work<00:02:54.340> so<00:02:55.340> the<00:02:55.700> first<00:02:55.910> thing<00:02:56.120> you<00:02:56.209> want<00:02:56.420> to

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
will work so the first thing you want to

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.920 
will work so the first thing you want to
do<00:02:56.660> is<00:02:57.400> put<00:02:58.400> the<00:02:58.580> pecans<00:02:58.970> in<00:02:59.450> the<00:02:59.780> food

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
do is put the pecans in the food

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.830 
do is put the pecans in the food
processor<00:03:00.590> and<00:03:00.800> grind<00:03:01.700> the<00:03:02.000> nuts<00:03:02.030> until

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
processor and grind the nuts until

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.840 
processor and grind the nuts until
they're<00:03:03.080> finely<00:03:03.350> ground<00:03:03.740> but<00:03:04.100> not<00:03:04.280> into<00:03:04.820> a

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
they're finely ground but not into a

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:22.800 
they're finely ground but not into a
complete<00:03:05.330> powder

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:24.900 

next<00:03:23.590> we're<00:03:23.740> going<00:03:23.890> to<00:03:24.010> go<00:03:24.100> ahead<00:03:24.250> and<00:03:24.640> add<00:03:24.730> the

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910 
next we're going to go ahead and add the

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.150 
next we're going to go ahead and add the
coconut<00:03:25.150> flour<00:03:25.569> and<00:03:25.959> the<00:03:26.260> salt<00:03:26.290> and<00:03:26.860> then

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
coconut flour and the salt and then

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:42.470 
coconut flour and the salt and then
pulse<00:03:27.760> it<00:03:28.030> to<00:03:28.330> combine<00:03:28.750> those<00:03:28.930> ingredients

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.840 

this<00:03:43.480> is<00:03:43.630> just<00:03:43.840> a<00:03:43.930> little<00:03:44.200> bit<00:03:44.350> fun<00:03:44.650> but<00:03:45.160> as<00:03:45.730> you

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:45.850 
this is just a little bit fun but as you

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:51.930 
this is just a little bit fun but as you
can<00:03:46.000> see<00:03:46.209> it<00:03:46.840> works<00:03:47.050> just<00:03:47.319> fine<00:03:50.700> now<00:03:51.700> that

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
can see it works just fine now that

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:53.640 
can see it works just fine now that
that's<00:03:52.030> combined<00:03:52.510> we'll<00:03:52.720> go<00:03:52.840> ahead<00:03:52.959> and<00:03:53.140> add

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
that's combined we'll go ahead and add

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.949 
that's combined we'll go ahead and add
the<00:03:54.069> maple<00:03:54.489> syrup<00:03:54.700> and<00:03:55.090> we're<00:03:55.690> just<00:03:55.750> gonna

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:55.959 
the maple syrup and we're just gonna

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:58.259 
the maple syrup and we're just gonna
pulse<00:03:56.200> this<00:03:56.380> until<00:03:56.800> the<00:03:57.489> dough<00:03:57.700> sort<00:03:58.150> of

00:03:58.259 --> 00:03:58.269 
pulse this until the dough sort of

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:01.710 
pulse this until the dough sort of
sticks<00:03:58.600> together<00:03:59.790> so<00:04:00.790> we<00:04:00.910> might<00:04:01.090> add<00:04:01.239> this<00:04:01.510> in

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:01.720 
sticks together so we might add this in

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:32.999 
sticks together so we might add this in
a<00:04:01.959> little<00:04:02.140> bit<00:04:02.260> at<00:04:02.470> a<00:04:02.500> time

00:04:32.999 --> 00:04:33.009 

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:35.739 

so<00:04:34.009> the<00:04:34.159> next<00:04:34.339> thing<00:04:34.519> we're<00:04:34.669> gonna<00:04:34.729> do<00:04:35.029> is<00:04:35.059> to

00:04:35.739 --> 00:04:35.749 
so the next thing we're gonna do is to

00:04:35.749 --> 00:04:39.879 
so the next thing we're gonna do is to
take<00:04:35.989> the<00:04:36.229> dough<00:04:36.469> here<00:04:37.069> and<00:04:38.169> place<00:04:39.169> it<00:04:39.379> on<00:04:39.559> a

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:39.889 
take the dough here and place it on a

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:42.009 
take the dough here and place it on a
cookie<00:04:40.369> sheet<00:04:40.399> I'd<00:04:40.909> like<00:04:41.329> to<00:04:41.479> use<00:04:41.629> a<00:04:41.659> metal

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:42.019

but you can find these pretty much

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:05.139 
but you can find these pretty much
anywhere<00:05:00.799> now<00:05:02.619> so<00:05:03.619> as<00:05:03.709> you<00:05:03.829> can<00:05:03.949> see<00:05:04.009> the<00:05:04.969> dough

anywhere now so as you can see the dough

00:05:05.149 --> 00:05:08.439 
anywhere now so as you can see the dough
is<00:05:05.179> kind<00:05:05.749> of<00:05:05.809> like<00:05:05.929> a<00:05:05.959> nice<00:05:07.029> still<00:05:08.029> has<00:05:08.209> the

00:05:12.459 --> 00:05:12.469 
nice sticky consistency I find this the

00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:14.319 
nice sticky consistency I find this the
easiest<00:05:12.919> way<00:05:13.189> to<00:05:13.219> make<00:05:13.579> these<00:05:13.789> into<00:05:14.209> the

00:05:14.319 --> 00:05:14.329 
easiest way to make these into the

00:05:14.329 --> 00:05:16.869 
easiest way to make these into the
little<00:05:14.569> cookie<00:05:14.719> balls<00:05:15.079> is<00:05:15.379> to<00:05:16.099> take<00:05:16.339> like<00:05:16.639> two
