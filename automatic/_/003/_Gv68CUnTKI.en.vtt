on the back of the lens yeah just uh

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.240 
on the back of the lens yeah just uh
my<00:01:35.909> problem<00:01:36.299> is<00:01:36.450> was<00:01:36.689> I<00:01:37.020> had<00:01:37.680> to<00:01:37.799> turn<00:01:37.979> him<00:01:38.130> to

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
my problem is was I had to turn him to

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:38.690 
my problem is was I had to turn him to
the<00:01:38.340> left

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
the left

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:39.770 
the left
when<00:01:38.880> I<00:01:38.909> turned<00:01:39.150> in<00:01:39.240> to<00:01:39.329> the<00:01:39.420> right<00:01:39.600> my

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
when I turned in to the right my

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.190 
when I turned in to the right my
distance<00:01:40.259> pin<00:01:40.619> at<00:01:40.799> all<00:01:41.060> so<00:01:42.060> unless<00:01:42.720> yours<00:01:43.049> is

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
distance pin at all so unless yours is

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.620 
distance pin at all so unless yours is
the<00:01:43.320> opposite<00:01:43.890> then<00:01:44.159> whatever<00:01:45.030> works<00:01:45.299> just

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
the opposite then whatever works just

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:46.819 
the opposite then whatever works just
keep<00:01:45.810> fiddling<00:01:46.229> around<00:01:46.350> with<00:01:46.590> those<00:01:46.770> two

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
keep fiddling around with those two

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.200 
keep fiddling around with those two
screws<00:01:47.189> and<00:01:47.700> eventually<00:01:48.270> it<00:01:48.450> will<00:01:48.479> work<00:01:49.020> as

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
screws and eventually it will work as

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.450 
screws and eventually it will work as
you<00:01:51.210> will<00:01:51.450> see<00:01:51.780> for<00:01:52.079> me<00:01:52.290> I<00:01:52.500> should<00:01:53.220> have<00:01:53.340> made<00:01:53.430> a

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
you will see for me I should have made a

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.249 
you will see for me I should have made a
video<00:01:53.610> where<00:01:53.909> it<00:01:54.060> showed<00:01:54.570> can't<00:01:54.899> read<00:01:55.140> the
