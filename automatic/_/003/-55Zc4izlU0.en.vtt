00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
you can see that there's quite a bit of

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.359 
you can see that there's quite a bit of
differences<00:00:15.269> so<00:00:15.389> they<00:00:15.509> really<00:00:15.719> went<00:00:15.990> all<00:00:16.199> out

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:16.369 
differences so they really went all out

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:18.800 
differences so they really went all out
and<00:00:17.369> i've<00:00:17.699> been<00:00:17.850> waiting<00:00:18.180> to<00:00:18.270> see<00:00:18.420> these<00:00:18.539> in

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
and i've been waiting to see these in

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.630 
and i've been waiting to see these in
person<00:00:19.080> face-to-face<00:00:19.529> next<00:00:20.310> to<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:20.490> other

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
person face-to-face next to the other

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.910 
person face-to-face next to the other
LeBrons<00:00:21.060> they<00:00:21.869> went<00:00:22.050> all<00:00:22.199> out<00:00:22.230> on<00:00:22.410> these<00:00:22.710> guys

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
LeBrons they went all out on these guys

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.269 
LeBrons they went all out on these guys
in<00:00:23.580> my<00:00:23.760> opinion<00:00:24.090> there's<00:00:25.080> nothing<00:00:25.529> that<00:00:26.130> it's

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
in my opinion there's nothing that it's

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.490 
in my opinion there's nothing that it's
like<00:00:26.400> a<00:00:26.519> remnants<00:00:27.269> of<00:00:27.449> the<00:00:27.689> Kobe<00:00:27.960> nines<00:00:28.199> but

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
like a remnants of the Kobe nines but

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.160 
like a remnants of the Kobe nines but
everything<00:00:29.369> is<00:00:29.490> like<00:00:29.699> to<00:00:30.510> the<00:00:30.599> next<00:00:30.840> level<00:00:31.109> on

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
everything is like to the next level on

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.819 
everything is like to the next level on
on<00:00:31.380> on<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:32.099> elites<00:00:32.369> and<00:00:32.930> so<00:00:33.930> you<00:00:33.989> can<00:00:34.350> see<00:00:34.500> just

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
on on the elites and so you can see just

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.819 
on on the elites and so you can see just
from<00:00:34.920> the<00:00:35.070> beginning<00:00:35.219> if<00:00:35.940> you<00:00:36.120> look<00:00:36.300> here<00:00:36.829> you

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
from the beginning if you look here you

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.470 
from the beginning if you look here you
can<00:00:37.860> see<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.100> pattern<00:00:38.520> right<00:00:38.850> here<00:00:39.180> along

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
can see the pattern right here along

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.500 
can see the pattern right here along
this<00:00:39.989> area<00:00:40.610> is<00:00:41.610> a<00:00:42.120> big<00:00:42.329> cut<00:00:42.510> out<00:00:42.660> on<00:00:43.020> this<00:00:43.890> pair

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:44.510 
this area is a big cut out on this pair

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.000 
this area is a big cut out on this pair
this<00:00:45.510> is<00:00:45.719> all<00:00:45.840> carbon<00:00:46.050> fiber<00:00:46.230> or<00:00:46.620> along<00:00:46.829> the

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
this is all carbon fiber or along the

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.360 
this is all carbon fiber or along the
bottom<00:00:47.190> half<00:00:47.520> and<00:00:47.850> then<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:49.410> top<00:00:49.590> half<00:00:49.860> has<00:00:50.340> a

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
bottom half and then the top half has a

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.430 
bottom half and then the top half has a
mesh<00:00:50.670> screen<00:00:51.120> on<00:00:51.270> it<00:00:51.390> so<00:00:51.539> you<00:00:51.780> have<00:00:52.199> a<00:00:52.230> mesh

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
mesh screen on it so you have a mesh

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.330 
mesh screen on it so you have a mesh
screen<00:00:52.890> right<00:00:53.100> there<00:00:53.270> instead<00:00:54.270> of<00:00:54.510> this<00:00:55.440> for

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
screen right there instead of this for

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.010 
screen right there instead of this for
the<00:00:56.399> top<00:00:56.579> part<00:00:56.820> I<00:00:56.910> personally<00:00:57.329> I<00:00:57.570> think<00:00:57.660> it's<00:00:57.899> a

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
the top part I personally I think it's a

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.170 
the top part I personally I think it's a
downgrade<00:00:58.469> because<00:00:59.129> this<00:00:59.340> material<00:01:00.000> hat

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
downgrade because this material hat

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.209 
downgrade because this material hat
unless<00:01:00.480> this<00:01:01.050> material<00:01:01.260> is<00:01:01.620> extremely

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
unless this material is extremely

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.889 
unless this material is extremely
durable<00:01:02.760> because<00:01:03.090> it<00:01:03.329> looks<00:01:03.510> like<00:01:03.690> it's<00:01:03.840> just

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
durable because it looks like it's just

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.950 
durable because it looks like it's just
sewn<00:01:04.229> in<00:01:04.409> there<00:01:04.559> a<00:01:05.630> potentially<00:01:06.630> you<00:01:06.750> can<00:01:06.869> have

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
sewn in there a potentially you can have

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.630 
sewn in there a potentially you can have
a<00:01:07.020> blowout<00:01:07.260> on<00:01:07.650> that<00:01:07.770> side<00:01:08.040> which<00:01:08.250> would<00:01:08.520> be

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
a blowout on that side which would be

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.390 
a blowout on that side which would be
pretty<00:01:08.880> bad<00:01:09.500> but<00:01:10.500> that's<00:01:10.680> one<00:01:10.890> one<00:01:11.189> of<00:01:11.340> the

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
pretty bad but that's one one of the

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.670 
pretty bad but that's one one of the
biggest<00:01:11.750> difference<00:01:12.750> is<00:01:12.990> I<00:01:13.080> see<00:01:13.229> obviously

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
biggest difference is I see obviously

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.980 
biggest difference is I see obviously
other<00:01:13.830> than<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.130> carbon<00:01:14.430> fiber<00:01:14.750> and<00:01:15.750> then<00:01:15.900> the

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
other than the carbon fiber and then the

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.510 
other than the carbon fiber and then the
regular<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.860> other<00:01:17.009> thing<00:01:17.159> is<00:01:17.189> you<00:01:17.369> can<00:01:17.490> see

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
regular the other thing is you can see

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.010 
regular the other thing is you can see
right<00:01:17.670> here<00:01:17.909> they<00:01:18.119> cut<00:01:18.299> off<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.600> Nike<00:01:18.840> swoosh

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
right here they cut off the Nike swoosh

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.060 
right here they cut off the Nike swoosh
as<00:01:19.200> I<00:01:19.259> mentioned<00:01:19.560> in<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:19.680> previous<00:01:19.830> video

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
as I mentioned in the previous video

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.340 
as I mentioned in the previous video
that<00:01:20.790> comes<00:01:21.180> up<00:01:21.360> here<00:01:21.570> versus<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:21.990> other<00:01:22.110> one

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
that comes up here versus the other one

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.929 
that comes up here versus the other one
where<00:01:22.500> it<00:01:22.619> just<00:01:22.830> goes<00:01:23.810> all<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:24.840> way<00:01:24.990> up<00:01:25.369> I<00:01:26.369> like

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
where it just goes all the way up I like

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.120 
where it just goes all the way up I like
the<00:01:27.090> fact<00:01:27.270> that<00:01:27.420> they<00:01:27.570> did<00:01:27.720> all<00:01:28.020> black<00:01:28.320> insole

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
the fact that they did all black insole

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.100 
the fact that they did all black insole
right<00:01:29.310> here<00:01:29.490> or<00:01:29.640> not<00:01:29.939> insulated<00:01:30.479> so<00:01:30.720> that<00:01:30.840> the

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
right here or not insulated so that the

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.760 
right here or not insulated so that the
air<00:01:31.229> pocket<00:01:32.570> the<00:01:33.570> like<00:01:34.020> it's<00:01:34.229> you<00:01:34.560> can't

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
air pocket the like it's you can't

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.260 
air pocket the like it's you can't
really<00:01:34.890> see<00:01:34.979> it<00:01:35.250> which<00:01:35.400> is<00:01:35.520> pretty<00:01:35.759> dope<00:01:36.000> and

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
really see it which is pretty dope and

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.670 
really see it which is pretty dope and
it's<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.630> same<00:01:36.840> as<00:01:37.020> that<00:01:37.200> one<00:01:37.350> right<00:01:37.500> there

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
it's the same as that one right there

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.630 
it's the same as that one right there
obviously<00:01:37.829> anyway<00:01:38.390> they<00:01:39.390> changed<00:01:39.900> let's<00:01:40.380> see

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 
obviously anyway they changed let's see

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.639 
obviously anyway they changed let's see
they<00:01:41.640> they<00:01:42.479> change<00:01:42.689> the<00:01:42.840> back<00:01:42.990> tab<00:01:43.200> so<00:01:43.530> let's

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
they they change the back tab so let's

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.639 
they they change the back tab so let's
look<00:01:43.770> at<00:01:43.890> those<00:01:43.979> real<00:01:44.220> quick<00:01:45.350> so<00:01:46.350> this<00:01:46.470> one<00:01:46.590> has

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
look at those real quick so this one has

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.399 
look at those real quick so this one has
a<00:01:46.740> pool<00:01:46.950> tab<00:01:47.130> on<00:01:47.310> it<00:01:47.430> and<00:01:47.579> maybe<00:01:47.790> I<00:01:47.909> can<00:01:48.350> get<00:01:49.350> a

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
a pool tab on it and maybe I can get a

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.200 
a pool tab on it and maybe I can get a
little<00:01:49.500> bit<00:01:49.649> better<00:01:49.770> we'll<00:01:50.009> look<00:01:50.280> here<00:01:50.579> that

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
little bit better we'll look here that

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.969 
little bit better we'll look here that
one<00:01:51.299> has<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.540> pull<00:01:51.689> tab<00:01:51.869> I<00:01:52.200> like<00:01:52.770> this<00:01:52.920> one

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
one has the pull tab I like this one

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.359 
one has the pull tab I like this one
actually<00:01:53.280> quite<00:01:53.640> a<00:01:53.670> bit<00:01:55.009> this<00:01:56.009> one<00:01:56.159> they<00:01:56.250> had

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
actually quite a bit this one they had

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.340 
actually quite a bit this one they had
to<00:01:56.430> change<00:01:56.670> though<00:01:56.850> because<00:01:57.030> you<00:01:57.329> can<00:01:57.479> see<00:01:57.689> the

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
to change though because you can see the

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.709 
to change though because you can see the
other<00:01:58.469> big<00:01:58.740> difference<00:01:59.369> is<00:01:59.670> the<00:02:00.030> sock<00:02:00.479> liner

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
other big difference is the sock liner

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.830 
other big difference is the sock liner
so<00:02:01.020> they<00:02:01.140> did<00:02:01.200> a<00:02:01.530> like<00:02:02.009> her<00:02:02.159> achi<00:02:02.310> style<00:02:02.840> liner

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
so they did a like her achi style liner

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.980 
so they did a like her achi style liner
and<00:02:04.140> on<00:02:04.829> the<00:02:05.189> elites<00:02:05.670> and<00:02:05.909> just<00:02:06.659> has<00:02:06.750> a<00:02:06.780> regular

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
and on the elites and just has a regular

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.369 
and on the elites and just has a regular
back<00:02:07.320> back<00:02:08.099> tab<00:02:08.310> area<00:02:08.640> on<00:02:08.879> the<00:02:09.599> the<00:02:10.080> regular

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
back back tab area on the the regular

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.750 
back back tab area on the the regular
nines<00:02:10.610> but<00:02:11.610> look<00:02:12.060> at<00:02:12.150> that<00:02:12.270> that's<00:02:12.390> pretty

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
nines but look at that that's pretty

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.179 
nines but look at that that's pretty
I<00:02:12.819> mean<00:02:13.599> I'm<00:02:13.689> assuming<00:02:13.959> that<00:02:14.319> would<00:02:14.409> be<00:02:14.530> pretty

00:02:15.179 --> 00:02:15.189 
I mean I'm assuming that would be pretty

00:02:15.189 --> 00:02:18.600 
I mean I'm assuming that would be pretty
good<00:02:16.230> cushioning<00:02:17.230> and<00:02:17.349> an<00:02:17.950> added<00:02:18.220> support<00:02:18.340> for

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
good cushioning and an added support for

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.559 
good cushioning and an added support for
for<00:02:19.180> the<00:02:19.269> people<00:02:19.510> I<00:02:19.720> ball<00:02:20.379> on<00:02:20.530> these<00:02:21.450> the<00:02:22.450> other

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:22.569 
for the people I ball on these the other

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:25.259 
for the people I ball on these the other
big<00:02:22.840> difference<00:02:23.230> let's<00:02:23.709> see<00:02:23.799> toe<00:02:24.010> boxes<00:02:24.459> they

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:25.269 
big difference let's see toe boxes they

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:28.350 
big difference let's see toe boxes they
had<00:02:25.450> some<00:02:25.720> more<00:02:26.230> visible<00:02:26.650> of<00:02:26.920> the<00:02:27.159> cutouts<00:02:27.459> it

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
had some more visible of the cutouts it

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.750 
had some more visible of the cutouts it
looks<00:02:29.079> like<00:02:29.230> they<00:02:29.379> have<00:02:29.409> some<00:02:29.799> no<00:02:30.459> actually

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
looks like they have some no actually

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.270 
looks like they have some no actually
they're<00:02:30.909> not<00:02:31.030> even<00:02:31.209> on<00:02:31.329> this<00:02:31.420> one's<00:02:32.159> so<00:02:33.159> they

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
they're not even on this one's so they

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.949 
they're not even on this one's so they
added<00:02:33.549> some<00:02:33.670> more<00:02:33.790> cutouts<00:02:34.120> in<00:02:34.360> this<00:02:34.510> area<00:02:34.810> and

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
added some more cutouts in this area and

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:37.289 
added some more cutouts in this area and
that's<00:02:35.500> will<00:02:36.069> be<00:02:36.190> probably<00:02:36.640> really<00:02:37.000> good<00:02:37.030> for

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:37.299 
that's will be probably really good for

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:39.990 
that's will be probably really good for
ventilation<00:02:37.709> and<00:02:38.709> comparison<00:02:39.280> to<00:02:39.579> these<00:02:39.730> ones

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
ventilation and comparison to these ones

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.009 
ventilation and comparison to these ones
on<00:02:40.090> this<00:02:40.180> side<00:02:40.390> well<00:02:40.510> there's<00:02:40.629> nothing<00:02:40.750> but

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:41.019 
on this side well there's nothing but

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:42.500 
on this side well there's nothing but
you<00:02:41.079> can<00:02:41.200> see<00:02:41.290> the<00:02:41.379> fly<00:02:41.530> wire<00:02:41.709> underneath<00:02:42.040> it

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
you can see the fly wire underneath it

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.800 
you can see the fly wire underneath it
the<00:02:43.510> the<00:02:43.930> laces<00:02:44.319> are<00:02:44.879> the<00:02:45.879> same<00:02:46.120> on<00:02:46.359> each

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
the the laces are the same on each

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.119 
the the laces are the same on each
separate<00:02:47.319> these<00:02:47.409> ones<00:02:47.620> have<00:02:47.680> the<00:02:47.829> Kevlar

00:02:48.119 --> 00:02:48.129 
separate these ones have the Kevlar

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:51.569 
separate these ones have the Kevlar
laces<00:02:48.840> and<00:02:49.840> you<00:02:50.079> can<00:02:50.200> see<00:02:50.319> on<00:02:50.409> the<00:02:50.500> tips<00:02:50.709> all

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:51.579 
laces and you can see on the tips all

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:57.660 
laces and you can see on the tips all
right<00:02:53.129> there<00:02:54.129> it<00:02:54.489> says<00:02:54.519> Kevlar<00:02:55.239> and<00:02:56.370> then<00:02:57.370> on

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
right there it says Kevlar and then on

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.800 
right there it says Kevlar and then on
these<00:02:58.450> ones<00:02:58.870> I<00:02:59.549> believe<00:03:00.549> it<00:03:00.700> just<00:03:00.940> says<00:03:01.150> mango

that's that and then the the biggest

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:14.910 
that's that and then the the biggest
change<00:03:13.540> that<00:03:13.690> I<00:03:13.780> probably<00:03:14.170> am<00:03:14.530> most

LeBron<00:03:20.709> because<00:03:20.889> the<00:03:21.370> way<00:03:21.489> just<00:03:21.730> hangs<00:03:21.940> down

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
LeBron because the way just hangs down

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:23.729 
LeBron because the way just hangs down
and<00:03:22.449> it<00:03:22.540> looks<00:03:22.780> just<00:03:22.840> like<00:03:23.019> it's<00:03:23.260> ripped<00:03:23.530> right

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:23.739

angle on these with the camera
considering<00:03:40.870> they're<00:03:41.230> all<00:03:41.319> black<00:03:41.650> but<00:03:41.919> you

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
considering they're all black but you

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.189 
considering they're all black but you
can<00:03:42.459> see<00:03:42.609> that<00:03:42.639> it's<00:03:42.879> a<00:03:42.940> sock<00:03:43.180> liner<00:03:43.449> kind<00:03:44.109> of

00:03:44.189 --> 00:03:44.199 
can see that it's a sock liner kind of

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:45.569 
can see that it's a sock liner kind of
like<00:03:44.349> the<00:03:44.769> Karachi<00:03:45.010> style<00:03:45.340> or<00:03:45.489> whatever

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:45.579 
like the Karachi style or whatever

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:49.319 
like the Karachi style or whatever
really<00:03:46.569> dig<00:03:46.810> that<00:03:46.959> versus<00:03:47.410> these<00:03:47.560> ones<00:03:48.329> now

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:49.329 
really dig that versus these ones now

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:51.809 
really dig that versus these ones now
you<00:03:49.389> can<00:03:49.540> see<00:03:49.690> on<00:03:49.840> this<00:03:49.959> the<00:03:50.290> padding<00:03:50.650> from<00:03:51.040> the

00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:51.819 
you can see on this the padding from the

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:55.140 
you can see on this the padding from the
inner<00:03:52.919> area<00:03:53.919> and<00:03:54.400> then<00:03:54.669> this<00:03:54.790> one<00:03:54.849> doesn't

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
inner area and then this one doesn't

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:56.220 
inner area and then this one doesn't
have<00:03:55.180> any<00:03:55.389> obviously<00:03:55.690> because<00:03:55.840> it<00:03:55.870> has<00:03:56.049> that

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 
have any obviously because it has that

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:57.960 
have any obviously because it has that
mesh<00:03:56.440> screen<00:03:56.769> that's<00:03:57.220> my<00:03:57.340> biggest<00:03:57.519> concern<00:03:57.940> is

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
mesh screen that's my biggest concern is

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.689 
mesh screen that's my biggest concern is
that<00:03:58.150> that<00:03:58.510> mesh<00:03:58.720> screen<00:03:59.409> like<00:03:59.799> I<00:04:00.099> don't<00:04:00.489> know

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:00.699 
that that mesh screen like I don't know

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:02.300 
that that mesh screen like I don't know
if<00:04:00.790> that's<00:04:00.970> going<00:04:01.090> to<00:04:01.180> hold<00:04:01.299> up<00:04:01.480> or<00:04:01.629> not<00:04:01.690> but

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
if that's going to hold up or not but

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:04.379 
if that's going to hold up or not but
all-in-all<00:04:03.310> what<00:04:03.699> do<00:04:03.760> you<00:04:03.819> guys<00:04:03.879> think<00:04:03.970> man

all-in-all what do you guys think man

00:04:04.389 --> 00:04:06.420 
all-in-all what do you guys think man
you<00:04:04.510> guys<00:04:04.629> think<00:04:04.959> it's<00:04:05.079> worth<00:04:05.560> checking<00:04:05.859> out

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430 
you guys think it's worth checking out

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:08.610 
you guys think it's worth checking out
these<00:04:06.609> elites<00:04:07.329> do<00:04:07.690> you<00:04:07.750> think<00:04:08.079> that<00:04:08.260> the

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
these elites do you think that the

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.339 
these elites do you think that the
quality<00:04:09.040> is<00:04:09.220> that<00:04:09.669> much<00:04:10.180> of<00:04:10.209> a<00:04:10.449> improvement

00:04:11.339 --> 00:04:11.349 
quality is that much of a improvement

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:14.750 
quality is that much of a improvement
from<00:04:11.560> the<00:04:11.620> original<00:04:12.040> ones<00:04:12.220> that<00:04:12.690> it<00:04:13.690> justifies

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 
from the original ones that it justifies

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.099 
from the original ones that it justifies
you<00:04:15.760> guys<00:04:15.909> paying<00:04:16.150> extra<00:04:16.479> for<00:04:16.510> the<00:04:16.720> shoe<00:04:16.930> I

they're going to charge extra because
they<00:04:24.370> had<00:04:24.550> to<00:04:24.639> redo<00:04:25.120> everything<00:04:25.479> to<00:04:25.870> make<00:04:25.990> the

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:26.170 
they had to redo everything to make the

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:31.890 
mean the machining for this the souls
and<00:04:30.010> stuff<00:04:30.190> have<00:04:30.310> to<00:04:30.460> be<00:04:30.550> done<00:04:30.730> you<00:04:31.660> can<00:04:31.780> see

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:31.900 
and stuff have to be done you can see

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.560 
and stuff have to be done you can see
right<00:04:31.930> here<00:04:32.110> there's<00:04:32.260> a<00:04:32.380> visible<00:04:32.710> zoom<00:04:33.570> slot

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:34.570 
right here there's a visible zoom slot

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:37.260 
right here there's a visible zoom slot
slot<00:04:34.930> right<00:04:35.110> there<00:04:35.290> now<00:04:35.470> versus<00:04:36.040> a<00:04:36.150> the<00:04:37.150> other

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.270 
slot right there now versus a the other

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:40.920 
slot right there now versus a the other
ones<00:04:37.450> don't<00:04:37.630> have<00:04:37.840> any<00:04:38.340> and<00:04:39.420> maybe<00:04:40.420> i<00:04:40.540> turn<00:04:40.900> on

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:40.930 
ones don't have any and maybe i turn on

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:42.830 
ones don't have any and maybe i turn on
my<00:04:41.020> flash<00:04:41.440> let's<00:04:41.680> see<00:04:41.770> if<00:04:41.830> that<00:04:41.950> works<00:04:42.130> a

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 
my flash let's see if that works a

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.330 
my flash let's see if that works a
little<00:04:43.840> bit<00:04:44.020> better<00:04:44.230> so<00:04:44.860> you<00:04:44.890> can<00:04:45.100> see<00:04:45.190> no

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:45.340 
little bit better so you can see no

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:48.870 
little bit better so you can see no
visible<00:04:45.670> zoom<00:04:45.820> slot<00:04:46.090> here<00:04:46.530> visible<00:04:47.530> zoom<00:04:47.880> then

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:48.880 
visible zoom slot here visible zoom then

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:50.580 
visible zoom slot here visible zoom then
you<00:04:48.970> can<00:04:49.090> see<00:04:49.240> the<00:04:49.480> little<00:04:49.960> shank<00:04:50.230> plate<00:04:50.440> right

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:50.590 
you can see the little shank plate right

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:52.800 
you can see the little shank plate right
here<00:04:50.620> you<00:04:51.550> can<00:04:51.670> see<00:04:51.820> it's<00:04:51.970> like<00:04:52.120> it's<00:04:52.570> kind<00:04:52.780> of

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:52.810 
here you can see it's like it's kind of

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:56.220 
here you can see it's like it's kind of
inset<00:04:53.410> now<00:04:53.850> into<00:04:54.850> that<00:04:54.880> and<00:04:55.270> it's<00:04:55.900> separate

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:56.230 
inset now into that and it's separate

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:59.190 
inset now into that and it's separate
from<00:04:56.620> the<00:04:57.280> other<00:04:57.400> half<00:04:57.610> so<00:04:57.940> you<00:04:58.750> can<00:04:58.870> see<00:04:59.020> that

00:04:59.190 --> 00:04:59.200 
from the other half so you can see that

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:02.250 
from the other half so you can see that
they<00:04:59.290> added<00:04:59.530> this<00:04:59.620> into<00:05:00.040> it<00:05:00.160> on<00:05:00.760> this<00:05:01.030> one<00:05:01.270> it's

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:02.260 
they added this into it on this one it's

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.710 
they added this into it on this one it's
just<00:05:02.470> one<00:05:02.650> piece<00:05:02.890> so<00:05:03.430> kind<00:05:04.240> of<00:05:04.300> another<00:05:04.480> big

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:04.720 
just one piece so kind of another big

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:07.380 
just one piece so kind of another big
difference<00:05:05.110> that<00:05:05.890> they<00:05:05.980> added<00:05:06.250> in<00:05:06.340> there<00:05:06.520> even

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:07.390 
difference that they added in there even

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:09.090 
difference that they added in there even
the<00:05:07.480> pattern<00:05:08.140> down<00:05:08.290> at<00:05:08.440> the<00:05:08.530> bottom<00:05:08.680> half<00:05:08.950> and

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:09.100 
the pattern down at the bottom half and

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:10.800 
the pattern down at the bottom half and
I<00:05:09.160> apologize<00:05:09.520> it's<00:05:09.700> really<00:05:09.910> bright<00:05:10.120> even<00:05:10.720> the

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:10.810 
I apologize it's really bright even the

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:12.330 
I apologize it's really bright even the
pattern<00:05:11.050> down<00:05:11.140> this<00:05:11.350> f<00:05:11.560> this<00:05:11.800> this<00:05:12.100> little

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:12.340 
pattern down this f this this little

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:14.100 
pattern down this f this this little
diamond<00:05:12.730> area<00:05:12.910> back<00:05:13.060> here<00:05:13.090> or<00:05:13.540> the<00:05:13.750> triangle

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:14.110 
diamond area back here or the triangle

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:16.080 
diamond area back here or the triangle
area<00:05:14.230> is<00:05:14.380> actually<00:05:14.650> a<00:05:14.680> bit<00:05:14.920> bigger<00:05:15.190> and<00:05:15.520> it's

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:16.090 
area is actually a bit bigger and it's

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:17.790 
area is actually a bit bigger and it's
in<00:05:16.210> a<00:05:16.270> different<00:05:16.390> pattern<00:05:16.990> as<00:05:17.260> this<00:05:17.560> one<00:05:17.710> this

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:17.800 
in a different pattern as this one this

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.530 
in a different pattern as this one this
one<00:05:17.950> is<00:05:17.980> just<00:05:18.040> in<00:05:18.250> a<00:05:18.310> little<00:05:18.550> this<00:05:19.150> is<00:05:19.300> more<00:05:19.510> of

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:19.540

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:24.670 
triangle the traction is even a little

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:26.790 
triangle the traction is even a little
bit<00:05:24.760> different<00:05:25.200> all<00:05:26.200> in<00:05:26.350> all<00:05:26.470> I<00:05:26.500> mean<00:05:26.680> they

bit different all in all I mean they
really<00:05:26.950> just<00:05:27.070> they<00:05:27.520> just<00:05:27.550> gave<00:05:27.820> the<00:05:28.030> whole

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:28.180 
really just they just gave the whole

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:29.820 
really just they just gave the whole
shoe<00:05:28.390> of<00:05:28.480> facebook<00:05:28.840> it's<00:05:29.110> literally<00:05:29.500> just<00:05:29.740> a

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:29.830
