00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
the figure of the Virgin we tend to

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.140 
the figure of the Virgin we tend to
think<00:01:09.299> about<00:01:09.450> drawing<00:01:10.250> for<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.310> most<00:01:11.549> part<00:01:11.939> of

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
think about drawing for the most part of

think about drawing for the most part of
the<00:01:12.390> standard<00:01:12.960> idea<00:01:13.290> is<00:01:13.380> to<00:01:13.530> think<00:01:13.770> of<00:01:13.860> it<00:01:13.979> as<00:01:14.159> a

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
the standard idea is to think of it as a

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.730 
the standard idea is to think of it as a
linear<00:01:14.610> meeting<00:01:15.210> a<00:01:15.390> medium<00:01:15.900> drawings<00:01:16.590> are

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
linear meeting a medium drawings are

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.810 
linear meeting a medium drawings are
equated<00:01:17.460> with<00:01:17.640> line<00:01:18.060> but<00:01:18.780> there<00:01:18.960> are<00:01:19.049> other

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820 
equated with line but there are other

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.820 
equated with line but there are other
aspects<00:01:20.820> of<00:01:21.119> a<00:01:21.420> work<00:01:21.630> of<00:01:21.780> art<00:01:21.960> that<00:01:22.110> draw<00:01:22.560> that

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
aspects of a work of art that draw that

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.460 
aspects of a work of art that draw that
artists<00:01:23.220> can<00:01:23.340> explore<00:01:23.820> and<00:01:24.210> drawing<00:01:24.570> for

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
artists can explore and drawing for

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.310 
artists can explore and drawing for
example<00:01:25.920> how<00:01:26.340> they<00:01:26.610> actually<00:01:26.909> lay<00:01:27.689> on<00:01:27.930> the

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
example how they actually lay on the

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.880 
example how they actually lay on the
paint<00:01:28.680> and<00:01:28.979> I<00:01:29.610> think<00:01:29.880> this<00:01:30.030> was<00:01:30.240> a<00:01:30.890> primary

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
paint and I think this was a primary

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.910 
paint and I think this was a primary
goal<00:01:32.250> for<00:01:32.549> Gainsborough<00:01:33.420> in<00:01:33.810> this<00:01:34.320> drawing<00:01:34.710> of

the chalk is laid down in a very very

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
textures we can see the gestures with

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.880 
textures we can see the gestures with
which<00:01:47.180> Gainsborough<00:01:48.180> has<00:01:48.720> applied<00:01:49.140> them<00:01:49.500> but
