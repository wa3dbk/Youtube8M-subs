to<00:01:06.770> do<00:01:07.770> that<00:01:08.510> and<00:01:09.860> then<00:01:10.860> I<00:01:11.250> will<00:01:11.549> be<00:01:11.880> doing<00:01:12.180> a

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
to do that and then I will be doing a

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.859

review<00:01:12.479> on<00:01:12.780> this<00:01:13.049> but<00:01:13.650> I<00:01:13.680> got<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.570> Coast<00:01:15.570> Guard

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
review on this but I got the Coast Guard

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.800 
review on this but I got the Coast Guard
helicopter<00:01:16.520> it's<00:01:17.520> a<00:01:17.549> little<00:01:17.820> bit<00:01:17.970> expensive

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
helicopter it's a little bit expensive

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.840 
helicopter it's a little bit expensive
but<00:01:19.700> I<00:01:20.700> think<00:01:21.000> it's<00:01:21.090> worth<00:01:21.270> it<00:01:21.450> I<00:01:22.640> just<00:01:23.640> have

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.490 
but I think it's worth it I just have
some<00:01:24.090> police<00:01:24.479> officers<00:01:24.900> here<00:01:26.240> but<00:01:27.290> here's<00:01:28.290> the

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.730 
boat and then you just pull it out into
the<00:01:38.220> water<00:01:40.040> and<00:01:41.040> I'm<00:01:41.430> using<00:01:41.670> that<00:01:42.030> little<00:01:42.740> fire

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740
