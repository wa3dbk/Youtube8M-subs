00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:46.219
 web applications 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:48.579

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:48.579
 your 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.430
 Y 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:57.660
 that if he does the work also 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.660
 is for that investigation 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:08.610
 I remember the procedures to catch 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.610
 to players and teams 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:30.180
 I obviously my tournaments appear here 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:30.180
 they do not have advanced search options 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:39.509
 the type of problem I know what 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.509
 tell and we give you look 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:44.260
 and in any case a light will appear 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:46.060
 I wanted it not to be found there's no 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:48.310
 search results continue 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.580
 trying until everything appears 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.230
 this 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:54.050
 this is what I did in colors 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:56.350
 far 100 84 there are more options than 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.350
 your 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.670
 over the mud 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:04.610
 and then here we have the option 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.790
 so 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:09.550

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:12.240

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:12.240
 distances 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:23.750
 and it will disappear and add to favorites and 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:25.470
 this is all we do here a 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.680

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.209
 what is system settings 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:04:02.310

 the entrance to our children good 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:14.180
 we go back to work with the whole system 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:15.780
 in English and you can see then that all the 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:18.930

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:58.100
 seasons 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:05:00.020
 and then I have all of them in my 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:03.620
 user I have selected all the 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:05.540
 teams in which this could be 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:11.060
 download but not 

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:12.560
 let's go up here distinction r1 l1 us 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:15.170
 responds to players and already what we 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:17.540
 interest in the tournaments that can be given 

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:21.410
 here I already have the tournament selected and 

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:23.360
 have a little green check and stay there 

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:25.010
 a triangle this triangle that tells us 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:28.070
 and below where the information there is a 

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:30.020
 new update because it seems to me 

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:34.370
 well because I had already downloaded 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:37.990
 before the tournament and I finish it 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:39.820
 to update right now with the new 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:41.590
 I put on the creams with their new 

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:44.530
 uniform in the tournaments why I 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:46.960
 it seems that picture now well only the 

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:48.819
 selection 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:50.830
 they select it and they start it 

00:05:48.819 --> 00:05:53.370
 to download 

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:53.370
 I 

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:57.330
 and so you can 

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:03.450
 they start to download 

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:04.890
 and expect to download depending on the 

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:05.340
 internet speed you have like this is going to 

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:07.560
 be 

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:10.260
 the time it took and that's all 

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:14.400
 who can do what is necessary to perform 

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:16.229
 after the terminal or download can 

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:19.930
 look again at system settings and 

00:06:16.229 --> 00:06:21.520
 convert into the Spanish system 

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:25.740
 and it 's all the same we appear 

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:25.740
 Spaniards will be able to play is this ?
