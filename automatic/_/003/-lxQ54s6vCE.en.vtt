hello in this video tutorial I'm gonna

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:04.789 
hello in this video tutorial I'm gonna
show<00:00:03.060> you<00:00:03.240> the<00:00:03.389> basics<00:00:03.540> of<00:00:03.899> navigations<00:00:04.529> and

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799 
show you the basics of navigations and

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.210 
show you the basics of navigations and
orbiting<00:00:05.279> around<00:00:05.400> objects<00:00:06.740> I'm<00:00:07.740> gonna<00:00:07.980> open

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
orbiting around objects I'm gonna open

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.610 
orbiting around objects I'm gonna open
any<00:00:08.610> scene<00:00:09.330> that<00:00:09.360> I<00:00:09.599> already<00:00:10.019> prepared<00:00:10.469> for

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
any scene that I already prepared for

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.299 
any scene that I already prepared for
this<00:00:10.920> tutorial<00:00:12.349> it<00:00:13.349> just<00:00:13.500> takes<00:00:13.679> a<00:00:13.799> few

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
this tutorial it just takes a few

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.510 
this tutorial it just takes a few
seconds<00:00:14.849> and<00:00:15.000> you<00:00:15.509> see<00:00:15.750> it's<00:00:15.900> gonna<00:00:16.020> show<00:00:16.199> up

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:16.520 
seconds and you see it's gonna show up

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.300 
seconds and you see it's gonna show up
so<00:00:17.520> by<00:00:18.270> default<00:00:18.420> whenever<00:00:19.109> you<00:00:19.320> select<00:00:19.560> an

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
so by default whenever you select an

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.210 
so by default whenever you select an
object<00:00:20.510> you<00:00:21.510> have<00:00:21.539> a<00:00:21.720> pivot<00:00:21.990> points<00:00:22.439> which<00:00:22.980> you

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
object you have a pivot points which you

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.730 
object you have a pivot points which you
always<00:00:23.490> orbit<00:00:24.119> around<00:00:24.240> it<00:00:24.600> and<00:00:24.810> if<00:00:25.199> you<00:00:25.350> have

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
always orbit around it and if you have

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.509 
always orbit around it and if you have
multiple<00:00:26.310> selections<00:00:27.140> your<00:00:28.140> orbit<00:00:29.039> is<00:00:29.250> going

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
multiple selections your orbit is going

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.920 
multiple selections your orbit is going
to<00:00:29.580> be<00:00:29.699> around<00:00:30.830> center<00:00:31.830> of<00:00:31.949> your<00:00:32.160> selection

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:34.930 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:37.510 

whenever<00:00:35.930> you're<00:00:36.199> in<00:00:36.230> the<00:00:36.500> sub-object<00:00:37.370> mode

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:37.520 
whenever you're in the sub-object mode

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.479 
whenever you're in the sub-object mode
which<00:00:37.730> we<00:00:37.969> can<00:00:38.149> call<00:00:38.360> modeling<00:00:39.019> mode<00:00:39.320> if<00:00:40.280> you

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:40.489 
which we can call modeling mode if you

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:44.380 
which we can call modeling mode if you
select<00:00:40.879> face<00:00:41.480> edge<00:00:41.809> or<00:00:42.140> vertex<00:00:42.309> and<00:00:43.390> select

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:44.390 
select face edge or vertex and select

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.200 
select face edge or vertex and select
one<00:00:44.629> of<00:00:44.660> the<00:00:44.870> vertices<00:00:45.199> of<00:00:45.379> the<00:00:45.710> object<00:00:46.219> by

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.210 
one of the vertices of the object by

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:52.329 
one of the vertices of the object by
pressing<00:00:47.239> F<00:00:47.839> or<00:00:49.809> going<00:00:50.809> to<00:00:51.500> this<00:00:51.620> menu<00:00:52.010> and

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:52.339 
pressing F or going to this menu and

00:00:52.339 --> 00:00:54.819 
pressing F or going to this menu and
clicking<00:00:52.729> on<00:00:52.940> frame<00:00:53.239> selection<00:00:53.629> you<00:00:54.409> can<00:00:54.559> zoom

00:00:54.819 --> 00:00:54.829 
clicking on frame selection you can zoom

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:59.740 
clicking on frame selection you can zoom
in<00:00:55.040> and<00:00:55.360> then<00:00:56.360> you<00:00:56.479> always<00:00:56.719> orbit<00:00:57.589> around<00:00:58.750> some

00:00:59.740 --> 00:00:59.750 
in and then you always orbit around some

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.049 
in and then you always orbit around some
objects<00:01:00.440> that<00:01:00.530> you<00:01:00.949> currently<00:01:01.190> selected<00:01:01.610> so

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:02.059 
objects that you currently selected so

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:04.329 
objects that you currently selected so
you<00:01:02.120> can<00:01:02.299> zoom<00:01:02.479> out<00:01:02.659> and<00:01:03.079> still<00:01:03.860> you're<00:01:04.100> always

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
you can zoom out and still you're always

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:06.999 
you can zoom out and still you're always
round<00:01:04.790> this<00:01:04.970> some<00:01:05.930> people<00:01:06.200> prefer<00:01:06.560> the<00:01:06.830> other

00:01:06.999 --> 00:01:07.009 
round this some people prefer the other

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:09.730 
round this some people prefer the other
style<00:01:07.610> which<00:01:07.970> means<00:01:08.020> no<00:01:09.020> matter<00:01:09.229> what<00:01:09.470> is<00:01:09.590> your

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
style which means no matter what is your

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.700 
style which means no matter what is your
current<00:01:10.190> self<00:01:10.580> selection<00:01:10.910> you<00:01:11.690> always<00:01:12.110> want

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
current self selection you always want

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:14.499 
current self selection you always want
to<00:01:12.830> orbit<00:01:13.460> around<00:01:13.670> the<00:01:13.909> center<00:01:14.119> of<00:01:14.360> the

00:01:14.499 --> 00:01:14.509 
to orbit around the center of the

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:16.810 
to orbit around the center of the
objects<00:01:15.020> in<00:01:15.170> this<00:01:15.470> case<00:01:15.710> you<00:01:16.280> have<00:01:16.490> to<00:01:16.640> select

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
objects in this case you have to select

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.260 
objects in this case you have to select
the<00:01:17.030> object<00:01:17.509> so<00:01:18.289> you<00:01:18.619> can<00:01:18.800> deselect<00:01:19.310> anything

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
the object so you can deselect anything

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.980 
the object so you can deselect anything
from<00:01:20.630> the<00:01:20.780> scene<00:01:21.130> when<00:01:22.130> you<00:01:22.220> dislike<00:01:22.550> anything

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:22.990 
from the scene when you dislike anything

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.540 
from the scene when you dislike anything
you're<00:01:23.990> going<00:01:24.140> to<00:01:24.200> see<00:01:24.380> the<00:01:24.679> options<00:01:24.979> and

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:25.550 
you're going to see the options and

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:30.100 
you're going to see the options and
plots<00:01:26.450> which<00:01:26.810> are<00:01:28.060> for<00:01:29.060> the<00:01:29.210> scene<00:01:29.479> like

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.110 
plots which are for the scene like

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.010 
plots which are for the scene like
environment<00:01:30.610> timeline<00:01:31.610> and<00:01:31.899> viewport<00:01:32.899> and

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
environment timeline and viewport and

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.270 
environment timeline and viewport and
players<00:01:33.380> the<00:01:33.740> viewport<00:01:34.190> has<00:01:34.369> some<00:01:36.280> default

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
players the viewport has some default

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.340 
players the viewport has some default
options<00:01:37.729> like<00:01:37.909> orbiting<00:01:38.390> around<00:01:38.479> some<00:01:38.930> object

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 
options like orbiting around some object

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.200 
options like orbiting around some object
by<00:01:39.530> default<00:01:39.920> so<00:01:40.490> you<00:01:40.520> can<00:01:40.700> change<00:01:40.909> it<00:01:41.030> back<00:01:41.149> to

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210 
by default so you can change it back to

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.760 
by default so you can change it back to
selection<00:01:41.930> so<00:01:42.469> when<00:01:42.619> you<00:01:42.710> select<00:01:43.100> object

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
selection so when you select object

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.910 
selection so when you select object
select<00:01:45.770> a<00:01:45.829> vertex<00:01:47.170> press<00:01:48.170> F<00:01:48.439> key

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
select a vertex press F key

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.490 
select a vertex press F key
now<00:01:49.729> if<00:01:50.000> you<00:01:50.119> orbit<00:01:50.539> you<00:01:50.960> see<00:01:51.170> you're<00:01:51.469> not

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
now if you orbit you see you're not

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.609 
now if you orbit you see you're not
orbiting<00:01:52.280> around<00:01:52.420> this<00:01:53.420> vertex<00:01:53.840> so<00:01:54.200> if<00:01:54.350> you<00:01:54.439> go

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:54.619 
orbiting around this vertex so if you go

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:57.700 
orbiting around this vertex so if you go
back<00:01:54.890> you<00:01:55.219> always<00:01:55.399> always<00:01:55.909> round<00:01:56.590> center<00:01:57.590> of

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710 
back you always always round center of

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.950 
back you always always round center of
your<00:01:59.320> model<00:02:00.320> which<00:02:00.860> is<00:02:01.250> the<00:02:02.090> pivot<00:02:02.299> point<00:02:02.689> of

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
your model which is the pivot point of

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.730 
your model which is the pivot point of

use<00:02:07.750> whenever<00:02:08.750> you<00:02:08.989> have<00:02:10.690> several<00:02:11.690> objects<00:02:12.109> in

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
use whenever you have several objects in

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.210 
use whenever you have several objects in
your<00:02:12.380> scene<00:02:12.440> let<00:02:13.340> me<00:02:13.519> add<00:02:13.700> one<00:02:13.730> more<00:02:14.980> I'm<00:02:15.980> going
