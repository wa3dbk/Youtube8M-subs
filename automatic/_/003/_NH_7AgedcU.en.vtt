00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:00.940
 the withdrawal you want requires that 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:04.590
 we can get married in the church 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:08.220

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:10.649

 I hope I can talk a little bit about that and 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:27.570
 for this week we will be trying 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:29.550
 to share most of the time and 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.980
 take those seven days to the fullest 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.270

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.840

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.840
 so 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.220
 I will take advantage so share with the 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:44.160
 family also I think that's all 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:45.630
 I had to tell them 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.480
 and then to see if they have any 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:50.310
 particular request about the subject of 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.550

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:57.060

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:59.610

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.390

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:05.090
