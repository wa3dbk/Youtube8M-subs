truck and then it's going to go through

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.400 
truck and then it's going to go through
the<00:02:50.650> check<00:02:50.950> valve<00:02:50.980> too<00:02:51.720> so<00:02:52.720> this<00:02:52.989> is<00:02:53.140> just<00:02:53.290> a

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
the check valve too so this is just a

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:54.690 
the check valve too so this is just a
little<00:02:53.590> project<00:02:53.739> I<00:02:54.010> forgot<00:02:54.280> to<00:02:54.340> show<00:02:54.430> you<00:02:54.459> guys

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
little project I forgot to show you guys

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.470 
little project I forgot to show you guys
I'm<00:02:54.819> doing<00:02:54.849> um<00:02:55.780> I<00:02:56.579> don't<00:02:57.579> see<00:02:57.849> why<00:02:58.000> not

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
I'm doing um I don't see why not

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.479 
I'm doing um I don't see why not
simply<00:02:58.989> because<00:02:59.140> this<00:02:59.739> is<00:02:59.920> just<00:03:00.069> a<00:03:00.280> pump

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489 
simply because this is just a pump

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:01.830 
simply because this is just a pump
that's<00:03:00.700> sitting<00:03:01.180> under<00:03:01.390> the<00:03:01.510> hood<00:03:01.629> of<00:03:01.750> my

that's sitting under the hood of my
truck<00:03:02.069> borders<00:03:03.069> can<00:03:03.220> be<00:03:03.250> not<00:03:04.000> doing<00:03:04.269> anything

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
truck borders can be not doing anything
