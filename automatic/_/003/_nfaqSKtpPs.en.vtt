delivery vehicles that have got a floor
at<00:01:23.560> Rand<00:01:24.560> about<00:01:24.799> 1100<00:01:25.579> they<00:01:25.700> do<00:01:25.850> vary<00:01:26.119> the

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479 
at Rand about 1100 they do vary the

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:28.870 
at Rand about 1100 they do vary the
vehicle<00:01:27.049> floor<00:01:27.259> is<00:01:27.380> very<00:01:27.619> from<00:01:27.920> a<00:01:28.159> meter<00:01:28.579> to

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
vehicle floor is very from a meter to

1200<00:01:29.570> we<00:01:30.049> put<00:01:30.289> a<00:01:30.320> floor<00:01:30.560> in<00:01:30.740> it's<00:01:30.890> about<00:01:31.100> eleven

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
1200 we put a floor in it's about eleven

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.279 
1200 we put a floor in it's about eleven
hundred<00:01:31.549> millimeters<00:01:32.299> above<00:01:32.420> above<00:01:32.780> ground

hundred millimeters above above ground

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:36.219 
hundred millimeters above above ground
level<00:01:34.060> so<00:01:35.060> the<00:01:35.179> unusual<00:01:35.600> thing<00:01:35.630> it's<00:01:35.929> a<00:01:36.049> very

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
flexible certainly in the types of

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.490 
flexible certainly in the types of
variations<00:02:20.090> that<00:02:20.180> we<00:02:20.420> often<00:02:21.020> come<00:02:21.170> up<00:02:21.290> with

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
variations that we often come up with

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.330 
variations that we often come up with
and<00:02:22.540> they've<00:02:23.540> been<00:02:23.690> very<00:02:23.870> very<00:02:24.830> good<00:02:24.980> they
