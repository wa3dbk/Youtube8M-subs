was one of the people that I loved it at
first<00:00:31.769> sight<00:00:32.189> I<00:00:32.430> think<00:00:32.940> some<00:00:33.120> people<00:00:33.420> you<00:00:33.719> know

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780

first sight I think some people you know
it's<00:00:33.989> came<00:00:34.140> around<00:00:34.380> to<00:00:34.530> it<00:00:34.770> but<00:00:35.190> it's<00:00:35.340> still

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
it's came around to it but it's still

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.250 
it's came around to it but it's still
some<00:00:35.730> people<00:00:35.850> out<00:00:36.120> here<00:00:36.329> that<00:00:36.540> just<00:00:36.840> hate<00:00:37.110> this

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
some people out here that just hate this

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.810 
some people out here that just hate this
shoot<00:00:37.559> I<00:00:37.770> think<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.309> reason<00:00:38.430> why<00:00:38.610> people

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
shoot I think the reason why people

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.520 
shoot I think the reason why people
don't<00:00:39.030> like<00:00:39.210> it<00:00:39.420> one<00:00:39.750> of<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:39.899> reasons<00:00:40.140> I<00:00:40.260> think

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
don't like it one of the reasons I think

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.410 
don't like it one of the reasons I think
it's<00:00:41.040> because<00:00:41.190> of<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.520> backward<00:00:41.820> swoosh<00:00:42.120> and

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
it's because of the backward swoosh and

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.060 
it's because of the backward swoosh and
another<00:00:42.870> reason<00:00:43.079> is<00:00:43.230> because<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:43.649> shoot<00:00:43.890> is

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
another reason is because the shoot is

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.240 
another reason is because the shoot is
kind<00:00:44.340> of<00:00:44.430> bulky<00:00:44.610> but<00:00:45.329> uh<00:00:45.360> I<00:00:45.960> still<00:00:46.739> like<00:00:46.950> it<00:00:46.980> I
