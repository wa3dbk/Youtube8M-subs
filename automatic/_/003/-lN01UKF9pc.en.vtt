00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:52.860 
consoles I won't see it spreading out to

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.550 
consoles I won't see it spreading out to
computers<00:04:53.669> I<00:04:53.879> mean<00:04:54.360> we<00:04:54.539> got<00:04:54.690> computer<00:04:55.110> gamers

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:55.560 
computers I mean we got computer gamers

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.460 
computers I mean we got computer gamers
but<00:04:55.770> um<00:04:56.300> they<00:04:57.300> they<00:04:57.509> not<00:04:57.720> carrying<00:04:58.259> the<00:04:58.349> whole
