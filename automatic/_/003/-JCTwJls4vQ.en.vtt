00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:08.300
 Hello, good friends, we are here 

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:12.310
 power supply d 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:12.310
 and a videoconsole in particular 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.039
 from the source of esla 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:27.240
 to ps 270 voucher has a fault this 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.840
 console that turns on I do not know if there will be 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.390
 past will pass 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:36.650
 It is a ruling that is our source 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:39.200
 the console the pilot of the pilot 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:41.510
 red is perfectly when 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.610
 make turns on makes a start but 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.230
 does not end up booting the console it 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:48.470
 turn off objective 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:53.750
 Well, that's a problem 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:57.680
 that by these these issues 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:01:00.410
 adjustable resistors are worth going 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.210
 the measure that has this is what 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.720
 He answered in a measure of science 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.720
 is 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.690
 power supply 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.340
 everyone has to have a measure this 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:15.280
 we have measured it from 1 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:20.109
 which is well worth we have already proven that 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:25.659
 works the first primer measurement 

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:27.360
 potentiometer is 33 gas worth more or 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:31.110
 less 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:33.600
 and make it possible if you pass is through 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:37.100
 below it is 80 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.100
 the second side 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:46.970
 a little good to do it 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:49.119
 the reference is the psc that you have 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.119
 here 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:57.840
 ok now we're going to measure it if it's okay 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:02:02.149
 and the other one is the pp that is 80 a wall 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.149
 what will be this is that here 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:11.030
 so now, guiding us with this 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:13.390
 and with the metro in scale we are going to 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.390
 to size 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.519
 To measure 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.819
 inside your tablets 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:24.450
 this is very simple where from the 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:26.810
 as it has three pins one does not 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.810
 is going to be used 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:29.760
 and we see there 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:37.000
 you have seen that it is wrong 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.000
 the time 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.780
 and let's measure the other notice is fine 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.410
 you have to download it from person to download 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.970
 baby 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:54.970
 you have to lower the scale 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:02.459
 and this marks us 7 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:05.290
 good up to the scale of 20 houses 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:09.490
 legitimate to the scale of mine but 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:13.890
 why but but how 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:17.500
 67 that are 70 thousand 77 so it's fine 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:19.780
 if the one that had to be modified is that 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.040
 ok there are some that do move 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.890
 for what we have been seeing and 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:27.340
 noting that according to all the 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:30.750
 let's play vital because it seems that this one 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:34.240
 It is very sensitive to manipulation 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:38.530
 then let's take a little with the 

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:41.180
 pistol with a pistol d 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:43.969
 of these plastic 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.739
 a flexible topic we are going to throw a 

00:03:43.969 --> 00:03:49.260
 droplet so it does not move again and 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:52.670
 this failure does not come back 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:54.830
 we proceed to read 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:57.430
 to lower it a little I think there was 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:57.430
 what to upload 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:02.760
 we see that moving him a little bit 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:18.329
 ok there would be fine 3 2 whatever it is not 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:21.549
 nothing happens 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:25.030
 we would see each other a little 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:27.599
 and to solve it we are going to throw a 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:27.599
 droplet 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:35.620
 but very little 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:35.620
 jose maybe we had a good time 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:46.470
 The mission of Sant foto 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:49.840
 And for what 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:53.639
 we could not so that they are not new 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:53.639
 by the heat or whatever 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:59.870
 we wait for you to get a little bit and we're going to 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:01.580
 do another reading just in case 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:04.340
 changed the value 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:07.210
 that surely has changed 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:07.210
 followed a little 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:11.810
 and something will have gone up 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:24.720
 you have seen that it changes with a respect 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:29.740
 a little 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:36.850
 there would be perfect 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:45.810
 you have seen that with nothing and that has 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:48.650
 modified or supposedly it would be 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:48.650
 replace it 

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:54.700
 Perez, you have one thing, it takes you away from 

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:58.030
 little glue nothing 

00:05:54.700 --> 00:06:00.660
 now we proceed to cut it and another 

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:00.660
 we will have 

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:08.290
 well let's do now the 

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:08.290
 causes the console to boot 

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:17.840
 perfectly 

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:17.840
 the green fault that is my country 

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:27.630
 that is the controlled as you see trying 

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:29.670
 perfectly 

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:32.940
 we need to try to start a 

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:36.560
 white console on the train but you have 

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:36.560
 seen perfectly 

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:44.930
 I will be a simple repair already 

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:47.830
 zero euros 

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:47.830
 see you later
