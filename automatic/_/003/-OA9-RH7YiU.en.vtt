00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 hello and a warm welcome here 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:09.179
 to a new edition of helpful 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:11.099
 tips to cars 2 on news.de I want 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.769
 today with a new tip 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.839
 make the happy 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.119
 probably most of them already 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.380
 but is planned perhaps the 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.260
 one way or another, the live one 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:25.140
 could ease a bit and that 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:28.080
 it's about crafting materials 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.970
 So the materials like iron metro in 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.040
 lime or wood or whatever 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.930
 always go to a field of 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.700
 to look at the way 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.430
 that means you have one on the way 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:41.280
 insight into your own bank gets 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.870
 So how do you get into the crafting camp or 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.480
 that the collective camp 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.520
 the special thing is that actually 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.050
 It's not that special just for many 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.879
 Just keep this idea 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.640
 did not come is assumed you are 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.430
 on the way and rejoice in my 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.230
 farming video presented 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:00.840
 collect iron and one of the 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.460
 imaginable powers and you are 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.650
 just has a bit of iron in it 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.840
 the town thinks hey how much 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.850
 I'm still missing iron until I get it 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.799
 me finally the devil tomorrow 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.510
 can and then stood up for it now 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.390
 Also Lionstone to travel in this in 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.280
 collective camp to look and see hey 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.020
 How much iron do I have? 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.790
 Doing the whole thing on the way 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.220
 the only thing you need is 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.080
 your cellphone menu and the area craft 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.900
 and if you then on the appropriate 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.119
 range cross you see how many 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.820
 materials you actually in your bank 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.860
 For example, I had six hardened ones 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.409
 leather pieces i can see how much 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.939
 wood planks I like how much rent 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.549
 much but also for the small strong 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:43.530
 matter materials such as copper tin 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.780
 Brocken or whatever I am 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.759
 so he only needs the search 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.210
 appropriate matching occupation and 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.200
 can see how much jute on the way 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.299
 want leather rest but whatever 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.100
 you just in the bank have no 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.860
 particularly imaginative or none 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.210
 especially difficult for many people 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.979
 will probably be self 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.420
 thought but one or the other 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.710
 Maybe it did not know that yet 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.990
 that he can see that on the way too 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.729
 can I make on a detail 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.890
