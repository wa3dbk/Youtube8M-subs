00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
what the lights hitting directly what

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.270 
what the lights hitting directly what
where<00:02:58.120> as<00:02:58.300> head<00:02:58.810> is<00:02:58.930> tilted<00:02:59.140> toward<00:02:59.709> you<00:03:00.099> want

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
where as head is tilted toward you want

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.830 
where as head is tilted toward you want
to<00:03:00.430> work<00:03:00.940> it<00:03:01.090> up<00:03:01.180> in<00:03:01.450> that<00:03:01.750> direction<00:03:02.020> and

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
to work it up in that direction and

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.570 
to work it up in that direction and
don't<00:03:04.840> cover<00:03:05.230> up<00:03:05.380> all<00:03:05.709> the<00:03:05.920> base<00:03:06.099> coating<00:03:06.459> that

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:06.580 
don't cover up all the base coating that

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.240 
don't cover up all the base coating that
you<00:03:06.760> did<00:03:06.970> I<00:03:07.180> mean<00:03:07.510> if<00:03:07.720> it's<00:03:07.930> a<00:03:08.170> broad<00:03:08.530> area<00:03:08.830> try

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
you did I mean if it's a broad area try

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.190 
you did I mean if it's a broad area try
to<00:03:09.310> leave<00:03:09.730> at<00:03:09.910> least<00:03:10.090> 50%<00:03:10.480> of<00:03:10.959> what<00:03:11.170> you

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
to leave at least 50% of what you

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.559 
to leave at least 50% of what you
painted<00:03:11.709> before<00:03:11.860> still<00:03:12.819> showing<00:03:13.090> through<00:03:13.360> so

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:13.569 
painted before still showing through so

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:15.570 
painted before still showing through so
that<00:03:13.720> way<00:03:13.900> you<00:03:13.959> get<00:03:14.170> that<00:03:14.230> nice<00:03:14.650> transition

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.580 
that way you get that nice transition

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:18.330 
that way you get that nice transition
with<00:03:15.790> skin<00:03:16.060> and<00:03:16.769> you<00:03:17.769> can<00:03:17.890> take<00:03:18.040> a<00:03:18.069> little<00:03:18.250> bit

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
with skin and you can take a little bit

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.100 
with skin and you can take a little bit
more<00:03:18.519> time<00:03:18.790> thin<00:03:19.150> your<00:03:19.269> paints<00:03:19.599> down<00:03:19.750> because

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.110 
more time thin your paints down because

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:21.660 
more time thin your paints down because
as<00:03:20.290> you<00:03:20.410> know<00:03:20.500> skin<00:03:20.860> doesn't<00:03:21.099> really<00:03:21.370> have

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 
as you know skin doesn't really have

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.580 
as you know skin doesn't really have
sharp<00:03:22.150> color<00:03:22.480> changes<00:03:22.989> everything's<00:03:23.350> pretty

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
sharp color changes everything's pretty

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.850 
sharp color changes everything's pretty
diffuse<00:03:24.130> so<00:03:25.000> keep<00:03:25.360> that<00:03:25.510> in<00:03:25.569> mind<00:03:25.709> when<00:03:26.709> you're

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:26.860 
diffuse so keep that in mind when you're

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:35.340 
diffuse so keep that in mind when you're
practicing<00:03:27.489> your<00:03:27.610> skin<00:03:27.819> tones<00:03:34.019> then<00:03:35.019> we<00:03:35.140> work

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.350 
practicing your skin tones then we work

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:37.350 
practicing your skin tones then we work
into<00:03:35.890> doing<00:03:36.340> the<00:03:36.459> second<00:03:36.790> highlight<00:03:36.940> using

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.360 
into doing the second highlight using

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.110 
into doing the second highlight using
bleach<00:03:37.540> bone<00:03:37.840> and<00:03:38.260> I<00:03:38.890> use<00:03:39.069> this<00:03:39.310> actually<00:03:39.700> for

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
bleach bone and I use this actually for

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.190 
bleach bone and I use this actually for
the<00:03:40.209> teeth<00:03:40.510> and<00:03:40.840> doing<00:03:41.739> basically<00:03:42.640> the

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
the teeth and doing basically the

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:48.300 
the teeth and doing basically the
glimpse<00:03:44.200> on<00:03:44.290> the<00:03:44.440> skin<00:03:44.739> whereas<00:03:46.680> I<00:03:47.680> see<00:03:48.040> people

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
glimpse on the skin whereas I see people

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:49.800 
glimpse on the skin whereas I see people
that<00:03:48.400> use<00:03:48.549> white<00:03:48.880> but<00:03:49.120> I<00:03:49.180> don't<00:03:49.330> believe<00:03:49.780> that

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
that use white but I don't believe that

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:51.930 
that use white but I don't believe that
Space<00:03:50.380> Marines<00:03:50.709> use<00:03:51.010> you<00:03:51.190> know<00:03:51.310> tooth

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
Space Marines use you know tooth

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.360 
Space Marines use you know tooth

00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:30.479 
quick job goes now we get into the

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:32.950 
quick job goes now we get into the
stubble<00:04:30.840> effect<00:04:31.290> and<00:04:31.560> this<00:04:31.860> I<00:04:32.040> learned<00:04:32.280> from

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960 
stubble effect and this I learned from

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.420 
stubble effect and this I learned from
reading<00:04:33.960> things<00:04:34.229> and<00:04:34.500> trying<00:04:34.740> it<00:04:34.889> out<00:04:35.010> and

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
reading things and trying it out and

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.670 
reading things and trying it out and
what<00:04:35.790> I<00:04:35.820> found<00:04:36.240> that<00:04:36.510> works<00:04:36.840> the<00:04:37.050> best<00:04:37.080> is

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
what I found that works the best is

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.500 
what I found that works the best is
taking<00:04:38.310> the<00:04:38.460> final<00:04:38.729> highlight<00:04:39.180> color<00:04:39.419> and

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:39.510 
taking the final highlight color and

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:41.240 
taking the final highlight color and
mixing<00:04:40.080> it<00:04:40.199> with<00:04:40.350> a<00:04:40.410> particular<00:04:40.800> color

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.250 
mixing it with a particular color

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:43.730 
mixing it with a particular color
depending<00:04:42.060> on<00:04:42.150> what<00:04:42.360> color<00:04:43.080> your<00:04:43.320> guy's<00:04:43.470> hair

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 
depending on what color your guy's hair

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:45.140 
depending on what color your guy's hair
would<00:04:43.860> be<00:04:43.889> if<00:04:44.070> it<00:04:44.190> was<00:04:44.280> longer<00:04:44.639> if<00:04:44.970> he<00:04:45.030> has

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150

black<00:04:45.449> hair<00:04:45.660> you<00:04:45.690> mix<00:04:45.960> it<00:04:46.080> with<00:04:46.110> Codex<00:04:46.470> grey<00:04:46.770> if

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:47.160 
black hair you mix it with Codex grey if

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.400
