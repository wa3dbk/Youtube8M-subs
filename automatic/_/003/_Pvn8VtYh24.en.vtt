has<00:00:18.990> a<00:00:19.020> sword<00:00:19.500> thing<00:00:19.770> I<00:00:19.890> guess<00:00:20.039> he<00:00:20.160> learned<00:00:20.279> the

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
has a sword thing I guess he learned the

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.179 
has a sword thing I guess he learned the
Incarnate<00:00:21.029> system<00:00:21.240> or<00:00:21.570> whatever<00:00:21.810> so<00:00:22.410> now<00:00:23.130> he

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
Incarnate system or whatever so now he

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.670 
Incarnate system or whatever so now he
can<00:00:23.400> fight<00:00:23.820> him<00:00:23.970> back<00:00:24.119> in<00:00:24.300> a<00:00:24.359> sense<00:00:24.570> um<00:00:24.779> he

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
can fight him back in a sense um he

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.800 
can fight him back in a sense um he
couldn't<00:00:25.949> like<00:00:26.699> Nomi<00:00:27.210> couldn't<00:00:27.480> steal<00:00:27.660> the

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
couldn't like Nomi couldn't steal the

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.540 
couldn't like Nomi couldn't steal the
sword<00:00:28.080> because<00:00:28.560> I<00:00:28.710> guess<00:00:28.859> it<00:00:29.010> was<00:00:29.099> just<00:00:29.130> an

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
sword because I guess it was just an

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.609 
sword because I guess it was just an
incarnate<00:00:30.150> thing<00:00:30.449> or<00:00:30.660> maybe<00:00:30.689> it<00:00:31.080> was<00:00:31.320> some

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
incarnate thing or maybe it was some

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.549

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
like that's I don't know it's a

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.499 
like that's I don't know it's a
ridiculous<00:01:39.960> power<00:01:40.500> um<00:01:41.009> and<00:01:42.000> even<00:01:42.240> then<00:01:42.360> his

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
ridiculous power um and even then his

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.149 
ridiculous power um and even then his
character<00:01:42.899> looks<00:01:43.110> a<00:01:43.200> little<00:01:43.590> ridiculous<00:01:43.860> but

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
character looks a little ridiculous but

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.550 
character looks a little ridiculous but
them<00:01:44.460> whatever<00:01:45.149> I<00:01:45.390> guess<00:01:45.689> it<00:01:45.960> doesn't<00:01:46.170> have<00:01:46.409> to

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
them whatever I guess it doesn't have to

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.499 
them whatever I guess it doesn't have to
be<00:01:46.590> a<00:01:46.920> physical<00:01:47.700> body<00:01:47.820> whatever<00:01:48.149> um<00:01:48.540> and<00:01:49.430> then

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:50.509 
be a physical body whatever um and then

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:54.289 
be a physical body whatever um and then

much it I thought Haru was going to use

00:05:56.879 --> 00:05:59.240 
much it I thought Haru was going to use
his<00:05:57.210> armor<00:05:57.659> like<00:05:57.990> trip<00:05:58.560> the<00:05:58.710> hell<00:05:58.860> out<00:05:59.009> and<00:05:59.189> go

00:05:59.240 --> 00:05:59.250 
his armor like trip the hell out and go

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:00.890 
his armor like trip the hell out and go
into<00:05:59.370> read<00:05:59.610> mode<00:05:59.819> again<00:05:59.969> and<00:06:00.389> that's<00:06:00.569> how<00:06:00.750> he'd

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:00.900 
into read mode again and that's how he'd

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:02.629 
into read mode again and that's how he'd
break<00:06:01.080> free<00:06:01.379> but<00:06:01.589> no<00:06:01.770> he<00:06:01.949> did<00:06:02.129> something<00:06:02.370> else

00:06:02.629 --> 00:06:02.639 
break free but no he did something else

00:06:02.639 --> 00:06:05.929 
break free but no he did something else
um<00:06:02.939> I<00:06:03.900> thought<00:06:04.560> she<00:06:04.979> was<00:06:05.460> probably<00:06:05.669> going<00:06:05.819> to

um I thought she was probably going to
use<00:06:06.060> her<00:06:06.240> healing<00:06:06.509> ability<00:06:06.990> at<00:06:07.080> the<00:06:07.199> last

00:06:07.429 --> 00:06:07.439 
use her healing ability at the last

00:06:07.439 --> 00:06:10.249 
use her healing ability at the last
second<00:06:07.979> and<00:06:08.069> like<00:06:08.310> save<00:06:09.089> someone<00:06:09.629> cuz<00:06:09.870> hell

00:06:10.249 --> 00:06:10.259 
second and like save someone cuz hell
