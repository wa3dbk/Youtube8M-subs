00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:22.360 
actually has molded in the back of his

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.930 
actually has molded in the back of his
head<00:05:22.620> the<00:05:23.620> camera<00:05:24.040> is<00:05:24.190> like<00:05:24.340> at<00:05:24.550> the<00:05:24.760> same

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:24.940 
head the camera is like at the same

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:26.700 
head the camera is like at the same
height<00:05:25.240> of<00:05:25.540> them<00:05:25.780> but<00:05:25.990> yet<00:05:26.110> Harry<00:05:26.380> is<00:05:26.560> way

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:26.710 
height of them but yet Harry is way

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:28.560 
height of them but yet Harry is way
shorter<00:05:27.250> so<00:05:27.520> it<00:05:27.669> made<00:05:27.910> that<00:05:28.210> was<00:05:28.300> just<00:05:28.480> like

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:28.570 
shorter so it made that was just like

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:30.420 
shorter so it made that was just like
one<00:05:28.690> of<00:05:28.750> those<00:05:28.840> moments<00:05:29.080> like<00:05:29.350> and<00:05:30.040> it'll<00:05:30.340> look

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:30.430 
one of those moments like and it'll look

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:31.620 
one of those moments like and it'll look
better<00:05:30.669> for<00:05:30.820> the<00:05:30.910> same<00:05:31.180> height<00:05:31.360> because<00:05:31.450> if

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:31.630 
better for the same height because if

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:33.930 
better for the same height because if
it's<00:05:31.780> like<00:05:32.020> looking<00:05:32.320> up<00:05:32.560> like<00:05:33.100> that<00:05:33.310> it's

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:33.940 
it's like looking up like that it's

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:35.580 
it's like looking up like that it's
gonna<00:05:34.120> look<00:05:34.360> weird<00:05:34.600> if<00:05:35.050> you<00:05:35.169> know<00:05:35.290> you're<00:05:35.470> just

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:35.590 
gonna look weird if you know you're just

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:36.840 
gonna look weird if you know you're just
like<00:05:35.740> you<00:05:35.860> see<00:05:36.070> the<00:05:36.190> camera<00:05:36.460> angle<00:05:36.700> like

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:36.850 
like you see the camera angle like

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:38.520 
like you see the camera angle like
looking<00:05:37.150> up<00:05:37.330> at<00:05:37.660> them<00:05:37.900> and<00:05:37.990> not<00:05:38.140> on<00:05:38.260> the<00:05:38.380> same

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:38.530 
looking up at them and not on the same

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:41.610 
looking up at them and not on the same
level<00:05:38.830> so<00:05:39.360> still<00:05:40.360> it<00:05:40.540> makes<00:05:41.020> no<00:05:41.169> sense<00:05:41.230> cuz

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:41.620 
level so still it makes no sense cuz

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:43.140 
level so still it makes no sense cuz
he's<00:05:41.710> not<00:05:41.800> that<00:05:41.980> height<00:05:42.190> but<00:05:42.550> anyways<00:05:42.910> would

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:43.150 
he's not that height but anyways would

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:44.550 
he's not that height but anyways would
