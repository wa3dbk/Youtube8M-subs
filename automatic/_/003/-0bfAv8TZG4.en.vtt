off<00:00:35.610> like<00:00:35.850> that

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:44.980 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:52.369 

I<00:00:45.040> one<00:00:46.470> 34.1<00:00:47.700> which<00:00:48.700> means<00:00:49.270> i<00:00:49.870> begin<00:00:50.800> about

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
I one 34.1 which means i begin about

00:00:52.379 --> 00:01:01.110 
I one 34.1 which means i begin about
roughly<00:00:55.710> 70<00:00:56.710> pounds<00:00:57.280> of<00:00:57.370> muscle<00:00:58.050> since<00:01:00.120> the

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:01.120 
roughly 70 pounds of muscle since the

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.729 
roughly 70 pounds of muscle since the
beginning<00:01:01.510> of<00:01:01.600> last<00:01:01.839> month<00:01:02.170> so<00:01:02.500> I<00:01:02.530> think

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:02.739 
beginning of last month so I think

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:03.930 
beginning of last month so I think
that's<00:01:02.949> actually<00:01:03.129> a<00:01:03.280> pretty<00:01:03.309> good<00:01:03.580> progress

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:03.940 
that's actually a pretty good progress

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.359 
that's actually a pretty good progress
and<00:01:04.300> the<00:01:04.360> fishings<00:01:04.869> and<00:01:05.259> then<00:01:05.560> extech<00:01:06.130> least

00:01:06.359 --> 00:01:06.369 
and the fishings and then extech least

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:09.330 
and the fishings and then extech least
our<00:01:06.520> bolts<00:01:07.090> and<00:01:07.420> that's<00:01:08.170> all<00:01:08.350> about<00:01:08.890> two<00:01:09.190> weeks

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:09.340 
our bolts and that's all about two weeks

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
our bolts and that's all about two weeks
ago<00:01:10.140> so<00:01:11.190> eight<00:01:12.190> pounds<00:01:12.520> of<00:01:12.580> muscle<00:01:12.970> think<00:01:13.240> it

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:13.360 
ago so eight pounds of muscle think it

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:19.200 
ago so eight pounds of muscle think it
