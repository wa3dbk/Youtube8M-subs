this parking lot to turn around the bird

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.930 
this parking lot to turn around the bird
would<00:02:57.940> have<00:02:58.030> died<00:02:59.250> especially<00:03:00.250> since<00:03:00.400> this<00:03:00.760> is

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
would have died especially since this is

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:02.670 
would have died especially since this is
a<00:03:00.970> parking<00:03:01.300> lot<00:03:01.360> with<00:03:01.570> this<00:03:01.660> place<00:03:01.960> and<00:03:02.230> not

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
a parking lot with this place and not

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:04.270 
open today so it would have been there

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:18.820

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
then even if I do it's probably going to

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:25.470 
then even if I do it's probably going to
be<00:03:23.380> you<00:03:24.190> know<00:03:24.310> have<00:03:24.640> something<00:03:24.970> broken<00:03:25.240> or
