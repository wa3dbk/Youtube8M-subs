00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:14.130 
see how the water repellency is of this

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:15.650 
see how the water repellency is of this
tent<00:05:14.430> now<00:05:14.580> remember<00:05:15.030> it's<00:05:15.210> a<00:05:15.270> forty<00:05:15.570> dollar

and<00:05:20.360> plan<00:05:21.360> on<00:05:21.540> carrying<00:05:21.810> this<00:05:22.139> is<00:05:22.320> like<00:05:22.650> a

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:22.680 
and plan on carrying this is like a

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.490 
and plan on carrying this is like a
backup<00:05:22.979> shelter<00:05:23.520> instead<00:05:23.850> of<00:05:23.940> a<00:05:24.000> tarp<00:05:24.300> or<00:05:25.290> down

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:27.630 
here in Florida so this is a third

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:30.620
