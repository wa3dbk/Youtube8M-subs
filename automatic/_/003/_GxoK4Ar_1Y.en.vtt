00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:20.390
 as a result, remove the adhesive layer from 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:22.729

 two or three weeks 

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:30.979
 I will try this way or not in the end 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:33.440
 As a result, the manicure should be removed with a special 

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:34.850
 Remuver as recommended or acetone 

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:37.550
