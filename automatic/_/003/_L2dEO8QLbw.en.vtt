they can't figure out barometric
pressure<00:05:52.930> they<00:05:53.230> don't<00:05:53.380> know<00:05:53.440> what<00:05:53.560> that<00:05:53.680> means

would<00:05:54.100> have<00:05:54.220> win<00:05:54.460> some<00:05:54.790> days<00:05:55.200> that's<00:05:56.200> a<00:05:56.410> wind

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:56.700 
would have win some days that's a wind

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:59.160 
would have win some days that's a wind
there's<00:05:57.700> there's<00:05:58.000> no<00:05:58.270> here's<00:05:58.750> the<00:05:58.810> problem
