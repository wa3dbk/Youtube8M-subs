absolutely no interest in putting them
in<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:05.880> way<00:02:06.000> I<00:02:06.030> felt<00:02:06.299> about<00:02:06.450> what<00:02:06.960> he<00:02:07.020> said<00:02:07.259> I

in the way I felt about what he said I
agreed<00:02:08.009> with<00:02:08.190> them<00:02:08.310> because<00:02:08.670> how<00:02:09.270> do<00:02:09.330> you<00:02:09.479> put

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
agreed with them because how do you put

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.590 
agreed with them because how do you put
something<00:02:10.259> like<00:02:10.440> that<00:02:11.039> it<00:02:11.190> that<00:02:11.610> is<00:02:11.700> organic

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
something like that it that is organic

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.410 
something like that it that is organic
like<00:02:12.690> a<00:02:12.720> dinosaur<00:02:13.320> into<00:02:14.280> Michael<00:02:15.240> Bay's

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
like a dinosaur into Michael Bay's

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.870 
like a dinosaur into Michael Bay's
universe<00:02:15.900> because<00:02:16.290> although<00:02:16.560> we<00:02:17.310> are<00:02:17.490> talking

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
universe because although we are talking

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.510 
universe because although we are talking
about<00:02:18.060> science<00:02:18.450> fiction<00:02:19.020> you<00:02:19.740> know<00:02:19.830> uh<00:02:19.860> you

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
about science fiction you know uh you

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.540 
about science fiction you know uh you
know<00:02:20.580> fantasy<00:02:21.180> but<00:02:22.110> in<00:02:22.380> a<00:02:22.470> way<00:02:22.650> he's<00:02:23.070> trying<00:02:23.460> to

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
know fantasy but in a way he's trying to

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.780 
know fantasy but in a way he's trying to
implement<00:02:24.210> it<00:02:24.510> into<00:02:24.720> a<00:02:25.170> lake<00:02:25.620> as<00:02:25.770> realistic<00:02:26.460> as

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
implement it into a lake as realistic as

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.300 
implement it into a lake as realistic as
possible<00:02:27.140> so<00:02:28.140> this<00:02:28.380> is<00:02:28.530> the<00:02:28.650> most<00:02:28.800> realistic

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
possible so this is the most realistic

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.360 
possible so this is the most realistic
version<00:02:29.730> of<00:02:30.120> a<00:02:30.480> science<00:02:31.140> fiction<00:02:31.200> scenario<00:02:32.040> it

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
version of a science fiction scenario it

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:33.980 
version of a science fiction scenario it
just<00:02:32.580> wouldn't<00:02:32.730> work<00:02:32.850> but<00:02:33.390> there<00:02:33.720> are<00:02:33.780> three

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
just wouldn't work but there are three

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.740 
just wouldn't work but there are three
ways<00:02:34.140> to<00:02:34.290> do<00:02:34.410> it<00:02:34.560> and<00:02:34.710> that<00:02:35.160> is<00:02:35.310> a<00:02:35.570> they<00:02:36.570> could

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
ways to do it and that is a they could

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.380 
ways to do it and that is a they could
have<00:02:36.990> like<00:02:37.770> a<00:02:37.800> pro<00:02:38.040> to<00:02:38.100> form<00:02:38.400> crash<00:02:38.790> into<00:02:39.180> a

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
have like a pro to form crash into a

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.540 
have like a pro to form crash into a
museum<00:02:39.900> where<00:02:40.350> they<00:02:40.470> hold<00:02:40.770> dinosaur<00:02:41.340> bones

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
museum where they hold dinosaur bones

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.370 
museum where they hold dinosaur bones
and<00:02:41.850> then<00:02:42.240> they<00:02:42.360> could<00:02:42.480> scan<00:02:42.870> that<00:02:43.140> and

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
and then they could scan that and

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.230 
and then they could scan that and
somehow<00:02:43.650> they<00:02:44.010> would<00:02:44.040> somehow<00:02:44.790> figure<00:02:45.180> out

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
somehow they would somehow figure out

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.240 
somehow they would somehow figure out
what<00:02:45.570> that<00:02:45.780> dinosaur<00:02:46.410> actually<00:02:46.590> looks<00:02:47.070> like

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
what that dinosaur actually looks like

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.540 
what that dinosaur actually looks like
and<00:02:47.460> they<00:02:47.640> could<00:02:47.880> morph<00:02:48.270> into<00:02:48.660> an<00:02:49.260> actual

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.550 
and they could morph into an actual

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:52.460 
and they could morph into an actual
dinosaur<00:02:50.550> like<00:02:50.730> a<00:02:50.760> t-rex<00:02:51.030> or<00:02:51.480> brontosaurus

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
dinosaur like a t-rex or brontosaurus

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.290 
dinosaur like a t-rex or brontosaurus
and<00:02:52.650> then<00:02:53.010> when<00:02:53.160> it<00:02:53.250> transforms<00:02:53.760> into<00:02:53.880> robot

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
and then when it transforms into robot

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.570 
and then when it transforms into robot
mode<00:02:54.540> it<00:02:54.750> opens<00:02:55.170> up<00:02:55.320> and<00:02:55.650> then<00:02:55.800> it<00:02:56.280> reveals

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
mode it opens up and then it reveals

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.510 
mode it opens up and then it reveals
it's<00:02:56.880> at<00:02:57.030> it's<00:02:57.300> an<00:02:57.480> actual<00:02:57.780> mechanical<00:02:58.680> being

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
it's at it's an actual mechanical being

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.340 
it's at it's an actual mechanical being
like<00:02:59.970> like<00:03:00.330> an<00:03:00.420> Autobot<00:03:00.780> you<00:03:00.990> could<00:03:01.110> do<00:03:01.200> like

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
like like an Autobot you could do like

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:04.610 
like like an Autobot you could do like
that<00:03:01.530> or<00:03:01.830> B<00:03:02.460> you<00:03:03.330> can<00:03:03.450> actually<00:03:03.660> have<00:03:04.110> the

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
that or B you can actually have the

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.760 
that or B you can actually have the
dinosaur<00:03:05.400> mode<00:03:05.760> is<00:03:06.060> actually<00:03:06.930> there

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.770 
dinosaur mode is actually there

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:09.950 
dinosaur mode is actually there
Cybertronian<00:03:08.760> mode<00:03:09.000> you<00:03:09.600> see<00:03:09.780> what<00:03:09.900> I'm

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:09.960 
Cybertronian mode you see what I'm

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:11.270 
Cybertronian mode you see what I'm
saying<00:03:10.020> that's<00:03:10.320> their<00:03:10.590> beast<00:03:10.860> mode<00:03:11.100> like

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
saying that's their beast mode like

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.340 
saying that's their beast mode like

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:18.230 
mode is a scorpion so it can mean that
the<00:03:16.530> beast<00:03:16.950> mode<00:03:17.220> the<00:03:17.400> dinosaur<00:03:17.850> mode<00:03:18.030> is

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:18.240 
the beast mode the dinosaur mode is

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:21.050 
the beast mode the dinosaur mode is
actually<00:03:18.720> there<00:03:19.530> what<00:03:20.100> they<00:03:20.310> are<00:03:20.520> when

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
actually there what they are when

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.390 
actually there what they are when
they're<00:03:21.210> in<00:03:21.360> Cybertron<00:03:22.050> and<00:03:22.380> when<00:03:23.130> they're<00:03:23.370> on

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
they're in Cybertron and when they're on

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.060 
they're in Cybertron and when they're on
earth<00:03:23.940> they<00:03:24.570> transform<00:03:25.170> from<00:03:25.260> a<00:03:25.410> mechanical

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
earth they transform from a mechanical

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:27.770 
earth they transform from a mechanical
robot<00:03:26.460> and<00:03:26.700> I'm<00:03:26.820> talking<00:03:27.120> about<00:03:27.180> like

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
robot and I'm talking about like

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.800 
robot and I'm talking about like
Mechagodzilla<00:03:28.560> like<00:03:28.820> into<00:03:29.820> a<00:03:29.850> car<00:03:30.270> you<00:03:30.690> see

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
Mechagodzilla like into a car you see

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.570 
Mechagodzilla like into a car you see
what<00:03:30.990> I'm<00:03:31.080> saying<00:03:31.110> that's<00:03:31.740> the<00:03:31.950> other<00:03:32.310> way<00:03:32.550> I

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580 
what I'm saying that's the other way I

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.370 
what I'm saying that's the other way I
would<00:03:32.700> think<00:03:33.270> it<00:03:33.390> would<00:03:33.540> work<00:03:33.570> and<00:03:33.990> that's

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
would think it would work and that's

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:35.990 
would think it would work and that's
actually<00:03:34.710> the<00:03:35.010> more<00:03:35.190> realistic<00:03:35.610> way<00:03:35.940> so

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
actually the more realistic way so

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.180 
actually the more realistic way so
actually<00:03:36.870> they<00:03:36.990> wouldn't<00:03:37.320> even<00:03:37.500> have<00:03:37.680> a<00:03:37.710> robot

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
actually they wouldn't even have a robot

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.190 
actually they wouldn't even have a robot
mode<00:03:38.430> they'd<00:03:38.700> have<00:03:38.880> a<00:03:39.150> t-rex<00:03:39.810> mode<00:03:40.050> of

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
mode they'd have a t-rex mode of

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.050 
mode they'd have a t-rex mode of
mechanical<00:03:40.650> t-rex<00:03:41.010> like<00:03:41.370> like<00:03:41.580> Grimlock

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
mechanical t-rex like like Grimlock

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.450 
mechanical t-rex like like Grimlock
transform<00:03:42.990> straight<00:03:43.350> into<00:03:43.680> a<00:03:43.710> vehicle<00:03:44.160> and

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:44.460 
transform straight into a vehicle and

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:46.610 
transform straight into a vehicle and
that's<00:03:44.940> how<00:03:45.120> I<00:03:45.150> think<00:03:45.480> that<00:03:45.870> would<00:03:46.050> work<00:03:46.110> I'm

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
that's how I think that would work I'm

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.400 
that's how I think that would work I'm
actually<00:03:46.920> all<00:03:47.220> for<00:03:47.520> that<00:03:47.730> version<00:03:48.030> better

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:48.410 
actually all for that version better

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:50.540 
actually all for that version better
because<00:03:49.410> I<00:03:49.680> think<00:03:49.920> that's<00:03:50.250> the<00:03:50.400> most

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:50.550 
because I think that's the most

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:52.430 
because I think that's the most
realistic<00:03:50.970> form<00:03:51.450> of<00:03:51.630> how<00:03:51.840> Dinobots<00:03:52.350> would

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
realistic form of how Dinobots would

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.070 
realistic form of how Dinobots would
work<00:03:52.680> the<00:03:53.220> other<00:03:53.460> way<00:03:53.730> would<00:03:54.570> be<00:03:54.630> that

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:55.080 
work the other way would be that

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.800 
work the other way would be that
Autobots<00:03:55.920> were<00:03:56.220> on<00:03:56.400> earth<00:03:56.610> 65<00:03:57.060> million<00:03:57.570> years

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
Autobots were on earth 65 million years

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.540 
Autobots were on earth 65 million years
ago<00:03:57.930> and<00:03:58.320> they've<00:03:58.470> just<00:03:58.500> been<00:03:58.830> buried<00:03:59.310> and

00:03:59.540 --> 00:03:59.550 
ago and they've just been buried and

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:02.030 
ago and they've just been buried and
it's<00:03:59.760> just<00:03:59.940> like<00:04:00.000> g<00:04:00.330> one<00:04:00.570> where<00:04:01.110> they<00:04:01.590> just<00:04:01.860> dig

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
it's just like g one where they just dig

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.380 
it's just like g one where they just dig
them<00:04:02.190> up<00:04:02.310> out<00:04:02.490> of<00:04:02.520> the<00:04:02.730> ground<00:04:02.940> and<00:04:03.360> that

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 
them up out of the ground and that

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:05.510 
them up out of the ground and that
they've<00:04:04.200> always<00:04:04.380> been<00:04:04.560> like<00:04:04.860> that<00:04:04.920> to<00:04:05.370> begin

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:05.520 
they've always been like that to begin

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.430 
they've always been like that to begin
with<00:04:05.700> that's<00:04:06.360> the<00:04:06.480> only<00:04:06.690> other<00:04:06.840> way<00:04:07.050> i<00:04:07.080> would

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
with that's the only other way i would

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.380 
with that's the only other way i would
think<00:04:07.590> it<00:04:07.770> would<00:04:07.890> work<00:04:07.920> so<00:04:08.250> a<00:04:08.430> they<00:04:08.880> crash-land

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:09.390 
think it would work so a they crash-land

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:11.630 
think it would work so a they crash-land
to<00:04:09.570> a<00:04:09.600> museum<00:04:09.960> and<00:04:10.410> then<00:04:10.590> scan<00:04:11.160> these

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
to a museum and then scan these

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.190 
to a museum and then scan these
dinosaurs<00:04:12.180> and<00:04:12.330> because<00:04:12.600> they<00:04:12.750> have<00:04:12.870> robot

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 
dinosaurs and because they have robot

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.530 
dinosaurs and because they have robot
modes<00:04:13.410> or<00:04:13.590> be<00:04:14.160> they<00:04:14.730> have<00:04:14.850> beasts<00:04:15.120> modes<00:04:15.390> from

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
modes or be they have beasts modes from

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.840 
modes or be they have beasts modes from
Cybertron<00:04:16.020> which<00:04:16.350> transform<00:04:16.890> into<00:04:17.010> a<00:04:17.130> car<00:04:17.489> or

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:17.850 
Cybertron which transform into a car or

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:20.960 
Cybertron which transform into a car or
see<00:04:18.540> they<00:04:19.320> crash-landed<00:04:19.950> 65<00:04:20.460> million<00:04:20.729> years

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
see they crash-landed 65 million years

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.060 
see they crash-landed 65 million years
ago<00:04:21.090> and<00:04:21.540> they<00:04:22.049> dug<00:04:22.500> them<00:04:22.650> up<00:04:22.710> out<00:04:22.890> of<00:04:22.919> the

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
ago and they dug them up out of the

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:24.980 
ago and they dug them up out of the
ground<00:04:23.250> and<00:04:23.550> there<00:04:23.820> they<00:04:23.970> are<00:04:24.000> dinosaurs<00:04:24.840> that

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
ground and there they are dinosaurs that

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.950 
ground and there they are dinosaurs that
transform<00:04:25.470> into<00:04:25.590> roll

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960

what<00:04:26.620> do<00:04:26.680> you<00:04:26.740> think<00:04:26.830> how<00:04:27.130> do<00:04:27.190> you<00:04:27.340> think

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.610 
what do you think how do you think

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:29.700 
what do you think how do you think
Dinobots<00:04:28.150> could<00:04:28.449> work<00:04:28.660> in<00:04:28.960> live<00:04:29.440> action

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
Dinobots could work in live action

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.480 
Dinobots could work in live action
because<00:04:30.490> I<00:04:30.729> don't<00:04:31.449> really<00:04:31.569> agree<00:04:31.900> with<00:04:32.020> a

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 
because I don't really agree with a

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.430 
because I don't really agree with a

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:35.440 
which is them crash lining into a museum

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.170 
which is them crash lining into a museum
because<00:04:35.710> it's<00:04:36.460> just<00:04:36.580> gonna<00:04:36.819> look<00:04:36.910> like

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:37.180 
because it's just gonna look like

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.570 
because it's just gonna look like

Jurassic Park we've seen this already

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:41.740 
think about it do we want dinosaurs

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:44.460 
think about it do we want dinosaurs

look<00:04:47.319> exactly<00:04:47.470> like<00:04:48.009> the<00:04:48.460> dinosaurs<00:04:48.759> in

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:49.060 
look exactly like the dinosaurs in

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.510 
look exactly like the dinosaurs in
Jurassic<00:04:49.330> Park<00:04:49.479> but<00:04:50.199> the<00:04:50.860> only<00:04:50.979> difference<00:04:51.220> is

Jurassic Park but the only difference is

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.550 
Jurassic Park but the only difference is

that they transform into robots imagine

that they transform into robots imagine

how huge sludge would be after he

how huge sludge would be after he

a<00:04:58.660> giant<00:04:59.380> brontosaurus<00:05:00.310> he<00:05:00.550> would<00:05:00.669> just<00:05:00.820> be

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:00.940 
a giant brontosaurus he would just be

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:04.980 
a giant brontosaurus he would just be
this<00:05:01.210> huge<00:05:01.800> towering<00:05:02.800> robot<00:05:03.699> and<00:05:04.000> he's<00:05:04.750> just

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:04.990 
this huge towering robot and he's just

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:07.080 
this huge towering robot and he's just
gonna<00:05:05.199> take<00:05:05.500> over<00:05:05.710> the<00:05:05.889> streets<00:05:06.639> of<00:05:06.970> the<00:05:07.060> city

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:07.090 
gonna take over the streets of the city

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:09.540 
gonna take over the streets of the city
so<00:05:07.720> I<00:05:07.990> think<00:05:08.139> that<00:05:08.440> wouldn't<00:05:08.800> work<00:05:08.919> at<00:05:09.130> all<00:05:09.250> I

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:09.550 
so I think that wouldn't work at all I

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:11.219 
so I think that wouldn't work at all I
would<00:05:09.880> go<00:05:10.000> with<00:05:10.180> the<00:05:10.300> beast<00:05:10.539> mode<00:05:10.780> version

00:05:11.219 --> 00:05:11.229 
would go with the beast mode version

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:13.290 
would go with the beast mode version
where<00:05:11.410> there<00:05:11.800> where<00:05:12.759> they<00:05:12.880> don't<00:05:13.090> have<00:05:13.270> a

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:13.300 
where there where they don't have a

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.719 
where there where they don't have a
robot<00:05:13.780> mode<00:05:14.050> they<00:05:14.500> only<00:05:14.650> have<00:05:14.860> a<00:05:14.889> car<00:05:15.190> mode<00:05:15.430> and

00:05:15.719 --> 00:05:15.729 
robot mode they only have a car mode and

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:17.850 
robot mode they only have a car mode and
their<00:05:16.060> dinosaur<00:05:16.570> mode<00:05:16.810> but<00:05:17.289> the<00:05:17.409> dinosaur

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:17.860 
their dinosaur mode but the dinosaur

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:20.460 
their dinosaur mode but the dinosaur
looks<00:05:18.070> like<00:05:18.220> a<00:05:18.250> mecha<00:05:19.000> version<00:05:19.479> of<00:05:19.599> itself<00:05:19.930> not

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:20.470 
looks like a mecha version of itself not

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:23.730 
looks like a mecha version of itself not
an<00:05:20.620> actual<00:05:21.159> like<00:05:21.880> dinosaur<00:05:22.659> skin<00:05:23.169> what<00:05:23.620> do<00:05:23.680> you

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:23.740 
an actual like dinosaur skin what do you

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:25.409 
an actual like dinosaur skin what do you
think<00:05:23.800> about<00:05:24.039> all<00:05:24.280> of<00:05:24.460> this<00:05:24.669> how<00:05:25.120> would<00:05:25.389> you

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:25.419 
think about all of this how would you

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:27.450 
think about all of this how would you
make<00:05:25.810> it<00:05:26.020> work<00:05:26.259> if<00:05:26.590> for<00:05:26.919> a<00:05:26.949> live-action

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:27.460 
make it work if for a live-action

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:30.600 
make it work if for a live-action
version<00:05:27.909> of<00:05:28.270> Dinobots<00:05:29.050> because<00:05:29.919> I<00:05:29.949> still

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:30.610 
version of Dinobots because I still

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:33.570 
version of Dinobots because I still
don't<00:05:30.970> think<00:05:31.090> it's<00:05:31.479> a<00:05:31.570> good<00:05:31.599> idea<00:05:32.070> but<00:05:33.070> if<00:05:33.430> they

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:33.580 
don't think it's a good idea but if they

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:35.790 
don't think it's a good idea but if they
had<00:05:33.759> to<00:05:33.909> make<00:05:34.030> it<00:05:34.180> work<00:05:34.360> in<00:05:34.570> any<00:05:34.720> way<00:05:34.960> I<00:05:35.259> think

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:35.800 
had to make it work in any way I think

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.040 
had to make it work in any way I think
the<00:05:36.009> second<00:05:36.430> choice<00:05:36.610> would<00:05:37.120> be<00:05:37.150> the<00:05:37.599> only<00:05:37.780> way

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:38.050 
the second choice would be the only way

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:39.600 
the second choice would be the only way
and<00:05:38.320> that's<00:05:38.620> not<00:05:38.770> having<00:05:39.070> robot<00:05:39.400> modes

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:39.610 
and that's not having robot modes

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:41.370 
and that's not having robot modes
anyways<00:05:40.180> that's<00:05:40.300> all<00:05:40.449> i<00:05:40.539> have<00:05:40.659> to<00:05:40.720> say<00:05:40.870> i'm

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:41.380 
anyways that's all i have to say i'm

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:42.899 
anyways that's all i have to say i'm
just<00:05:41.440> gonna<00:05:41.680> leave<00:05:41.889> you<00:05:42.009> with<00:05:42.250> some<00:05:42.460> Dinobot

00:05:42.899 --> 00:05:42.909
