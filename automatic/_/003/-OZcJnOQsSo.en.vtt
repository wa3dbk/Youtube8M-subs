that<00:00:54.270> approach<00:00:54.770> so<00:00:55.770> just<00:00:55.980> gonna<00:00:56.129> give<00:00:56.250> a<00:00:56.309> quick

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
that approach so just gonna give a quick

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.130 
that approach so just gonna give a quick
tour<00:00:56.730> of<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:56.910> Wi-Fi<00:00:57.270> beta<00:00:57.539> here

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
tour of the Wi-Fi beta here

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.840 
tour of the Wi-Fi beta here
first<00:00:58.590> of<00:00:58.710> all<00:00:58.829> stand<00:00:59.190> up<00:00:59.340> and<00:00:59.579> think<00:00:59.730> it<00:00:59.789> will

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
first of all stand up and think it will

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.689 
first of all stand up and think it will
get<00:00:59.969> a<00:01:00.000> keyboard<00:01:00.859> it<00:01:01.859> does<00:01:02.070> have<00:01:02.250> a<00:01:02.280> backlight

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
get a keyboard it does have a backlight

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.579 
get a keyboard it does have a backlight
on<00:01:02.730> it<00:01:03.000> so<00:01:03.149> if<00:01:03.329> I<00:01:03.420> actually<00:01:03.629> go<00:01:03.989> turn<00:01:04.260> off<00:01:04.290> the

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
on it so if I actually go turn off the

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.679 
on it so if I actually go turn off the
lights<00:01:04.799> I<00:01:04.979> can<00:01:05.189> demonstrate<00:01:05.850> that<00:01:06.299> which

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
lights I can demonstrate that which

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.109 
lights I can demonstrate that which
requires<00:01:07.200> me<00:01:07.409> to<00:01:07.439> you<00:01:08.250> steps<00:01:08.549> off<00:01:08.790> to<00:01:09.030> the

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
requires me to you steps off to the

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.899 
requires me to you steps off to the
right<00:01:09.299> here<00:01:10.130> so<00:01:11.130> as<00:01:11.189> we're<00:01:11.430> plunged<00:01:11.790> into

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
right here so as we're plunged into

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.910 
right here so as we're plunged into
darkness<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.659> way<00:01:13.140> you<00:01:13.200> turn<00:01:13.560> on<00:01:13.710> the

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
for around the sides of the Wi-Fi baby

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.920 
for around the sides of the Wi-Fi baby
so<00:01:37.380> we<00:01:37.470> can<00:01:37.619> see<00:01:38.040> what<00:01:38.189> ports<00:01:38.490> we<00:01:38.640> get<00:01:38.820> here<00:01:39.030> so

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
so we can see what ports we get here so

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.469 
so we can see what ports we get here so
on<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.229> left<00:01:40.380> side<00:01:40.799> you<00:01:41.100> have<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.579> VGA

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
on the left side you have the VGA

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.010 
on the left side you have the VGA
monitor<00:01:42.899> out<00:01:43.100> Ethernet<00:01:44.100> jack<00:01:44.630> HDMI<00:01:45.630> and<00:01:45.869> then

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
monitor out Ethernet jack HDMI and then

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.310 
monitor out Ethernet jack HDMI and then
a<00:01:46.079> couple<00:01:46.320> USB<00:01:46.860> 3.0<00:01:47.460> ports<00:01:47.850> over<00:01:48.750> here<00:01:49.110> you'll

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
a couple USB 3.0 ports over here you'll

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.289 
a couple USB 3.0 ports over here you'll
also<00:01:49.530> see<00:01:49.890> there's<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.340> heat<00:01:50.549> pen<00:01:50.820> has<00:01:51.090> rather

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
also see there's the heat pen has rather

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.719 
also see there's the heat pen has rather
giant<00:01:52.049> it's<00:01:52.860> a<00:01:52.979> little<00:01:53.159> hard<00:01:53.310> to<00:01:53.399> see<00:01:53.670> since

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
giant it's a little hard to see since
