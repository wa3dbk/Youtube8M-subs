00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 in seconds 

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:07.310
 Karrer pretty impressive 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:09.219
 Dr 

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:10.509
 and very high 

00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:11.639
 r 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.570
 namely 275 meters above Las Vegas 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:17.099
 around 

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:19.320
 which, among other things, raises the question 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.160
 how to drive on so crazy the project can be without the floor under the floor 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.859
 To lose your feet 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:30.480
 In this case, RR LASK are always looking forward to a special challenge 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.370
 in that we could not strain the spire limitlessly 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.040
 Of course, safety was the top priority so there is more here 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.580
 Safety precautions are the largest of any system on the ground 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:46.880
 Problem was to cope with the conditions of the site for example 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:51.400
 Wind gusts of up to 130 kilometers per hour are not uncommon here 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.270
 its stars in Asia 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.540
 but what does it matter if sometimes the stratosphere disappeared 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.290
 After all, you can not see what you do not see while driving 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:04.350
 Close no view enjoy the peerless 

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:09.490
 I hear the SPD is - for Vettel's teammates greatest possible success 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.530
 to generate is that I have my first grade of 32 degrees 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.569
 Passengers the impression that it is equal to 300 meters in depth as well 

00:01:17.569 --> 00:01:18.429
 given away 

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:19.550
 the tennis star 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:21.820
 said the insurer 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.450
 Dr we were allowed to return to normal Las Vegas is probably obvious 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.560
 ca 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.700
 no idea 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.300
 invest a few euros and played the first bet 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:40.250
 in this case it is suggested with his life while in the industry 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.250
 include the spire Rudolph 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:47.560
 Dr 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.560
 Dr 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:01.080
 if that is not enough 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.570
 Vechta 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.150
 he can strap on his way for a high-altitude flight 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.869
 another 48 meters further into the sky leads 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:11.869
 in just three seconds 

00:02:12.859 --> 00:02:15.859
 he is on it 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:26.319
 and then down again Aachen 

00:02:33.139 --> 00:02:35.849
 comes to a standstill and it is important to me 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:40.310
 should only make it invisible some 300 feet above the ground 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.769
 is down 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:47.669
 the compressed air driven pulley system with nine coaches that the 

00:02:47.669 --> 00:02:51.590
 Passengers catapulted into the air also acts as the brake system 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.590
 Super soft landing guaranteed 

00:02:58.669 --> 00:03:01.939
 Who stops 

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:03.919
 May 

00:03:03.919 --> 00:03:06.149
