00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:07.840
 hello people we are just for you 

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:10.780
 on the way at the mobile world congress 

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:12.249
 2010 in barcelona we are currently at 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:15.129
 sony stood and have the new here 

00:00:12.249 --> 00:00:16.750
 flagship of sony the xperia z2 on 

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:18.820
 At first glance it looks like the z1 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:20.859
 and in fact, the changes are stuck 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:23.859
 especially in detail the camera takes 

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:25.210
 now videos in 4k resolution on and before 

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:27.730
 all the display is much better 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:29.859
 what exactly happened in the 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.680
 compared to the predecessor z1 that look 

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:33.940
 Let's take a closer look first 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.280
 But let's take another look at that 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.899
 2 1 that changes on the display what 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.550
 you only see the second one 

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:42.550
 but it is slightly larger 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:44.050
 and by 0.1 should be striking 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.579
 is especially that the edges are left and 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.370
 on the right are much narrower than the 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:50.289
 z1 is the presentation quality 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.370
 be excellent colors and contrasts 

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:53.620
 presented very well 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:55.870
 Compared to the z1 is especially noticeable 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:58.629
 that the viewing angle stability significantly 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:00.730
 has become better in the design of the z2 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:02.710
 sony stays true to his line and follows 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:04.570
 the only balance design that with the 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.640
 xperia z was introduced 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:08.710
 instead of the loudspeaker grills at the 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.390
 bottom of the device is at the z2 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:13.479
 but only three points through 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:15.310
 the sound comes from the hardware 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:16.869
 Camera has not changed the 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.150
 front camera still has two 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:22.119
 megapixel resolution the back camera triggers 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:23.799
 with 20.7 megapixels on it though 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:25.509
 sony screwed to the software 

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:27.720
 most important new feature is the 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:30.640
 possibility videos with 4k resolution 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.340
 that's four times as much as 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:36.490
 the hitherto usual full hd resolutions 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:38.200
 how 4k videos look in practice 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.270
 Let's see at this example that on 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.399
 beach of barcelona 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.020
 especially when you zoom into the picture into 

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:46.210
 you can see how high the detail drawing 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.409
 is even to be small particles of sand 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.360
 still sharp 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:50.770
 that does not like on the smartphone display 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.899
 necessarily be particularly useful but 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.270
 at the latest when you send the video to a 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:56.439
 4k tv gives out makes the 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.630
 difference noticeable 

00:01:56.439 --> 00:02:01.149
 a direct comparison between full 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.570
 hd and 4k we could stand on the sony 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:03.640
 rotate 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.049
 Here we see the video with normal 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.390
 full hd resolution 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:10.509
 then comes the same recording 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:12.070
 with 4k resolution as I said on one 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.480
 normal computer screens are the ones 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:16.240
 probably hardly different 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.100
 recognize therefore worth 4k also only 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.510
 if you have the appropriate 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.400
 output devices should consider one 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.470
 also that 4k videos about three to 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.530
 take away four times as much space 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.000
 like videos with full hd resolution 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:31.330
 Who now asks if the changed 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.070
 from xperia z1 to z2 worth having for 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:35.430
 we once again the direct comparison 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:37.360
 on the left you see the z2 on the right the z1 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:41.020
 Clear is the viewing angle stability 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:42.700
 the z2 is better than the z1 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:45.190
 otherwise, both devices are alike 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:47.920
 but almost as one to the other 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.120
 the z2 is slightly thinner than the z1 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.010
 for a little longer 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.600
 The edges around the display are something 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.060
 the width has become narrower 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:57.040
 loudspeaker grill at the z1 is one 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.120
 minimalist three points design at 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.800
 gave way to z2 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.480
 that 's it but then with the 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.800
 otherwise you have a difference 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.200
 the same thing 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.660
 So who has 1 z 1 can confidently when 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.400
 z1 who stay now for one of the 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:12.610
 Both devices should decide 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:15.660
 but the z2 grab the c2 is that 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.660
 better z 1
