00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 so you want this master of celery 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:04.770
 rave 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.990
 you do not know how to do it 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.929
 very easy to start working 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:15.000
 your land I have already made a 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:17.420
 beforehand then made two small signals 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:22.140
 one next to the other 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:24.510
 so for letting the laughs be good ah 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.430
 they can be made directly in the ground 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.010
 or we can put them in the ground 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.230
 then the deputies he received them in 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.149
 earth eventually I'm going 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.890
 directly land is faster and 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.890
 then like that 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:48.750
 gp2 sion here you are taking your seeds 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.000
 so you'll see if the little ones 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.930
 grains so be careful to put 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.260
 too much otherwise you will end up 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:02.160
 with a lot of thumb in one place 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:09.360
 put them in the hand here we would not have 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:14.010
 not too much and have masters like 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:17.450
 that then if really there is too much for 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:23.040
 nothing will stop you from 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:24.299
 remove or sow it also a 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.540
 will blow MPs then earth this 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.540
 shirt 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:38.030
 that's the dream of seeds for 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:41.170
 recovers for the next year the 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:44.659
 seeds keeps very very well then 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:49.250
 with your hands you come to cover the 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:53.240
 seeds of the earth and finally 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:56.899
 always with your - taste enough 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:02:03.860
 start again on that side and 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:04.939
 here are your seedlings of celery root is over 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.399
 you just have to water and 

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:09.470
 wait for that push I repeat if you 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:13.010
 have too much nothing prevents you from 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:17.079
 help him stitched then re puts himself 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:21.280
 elsewhere by 2 to the bonmort edition a 

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:21.280
 sail to a +
