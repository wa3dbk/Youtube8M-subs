 and the canons with you are talking I'm sure 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:01:00.149
 that none of your politicians and

 citizens there is not a single fact to 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.049
 blame me or belarus on 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.140
 insincerity we have always been very 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:09.380
 sincere we are always with the greatest 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.450
 respected the Serbian people 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:15.299
 because the Serbian people are our people 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:18.180
 Belarusian is a long-suffering this 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:20.670
 the victorious people need it gone 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:24.650
 people who made a huge contribution to 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:27.780
 liberation of europe from brown plague 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.890
 the most difficult moments of your story we 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.619
 always been near 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.630
 as much as they could and mister president so 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.850
 will continue to be so forever 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.340
 Why am I talking about this ? I will tell you. 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:42.470
 frankly on the eve of my visit here i 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:46.110
 just wondered a covariance 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:48.600
 European Community neighbors like 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.720
 minimum of united states of america in 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.570
 America what is their reaction to my visit 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:57.810
 you all know I took off long ago 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:00.570
 you are the glasses but the one that struck me no less 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.700
 surprised their position they were ready 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.760
 do everything to break 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:09.330
 this visit or make it absolutely 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:12.720
 invisible serbia we drive alongside like people 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:15.209
 Goodwill Copper to our brothers we want 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.910
 help as much as we can 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:20.160
 today do for our brothers and what 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:23.280
 if as a result of this visit the service 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:26.490
 will be at least a little stronger maybe 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.590
 richer reason against this act and 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:31.860
 the question is what are the goals when 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:35.070
 pursue your western partners with 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:37.680
 by which you conduct a dialogue in the negotiations 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:40.560
 with you they want to weaken even more 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.040
 Serbia and they want a blessing for Serbian 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.680
 of the people 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:47.700
 if you want the benefit of something that hinders 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:53.070
 we came here not against anyone we 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:55.650
 have come to make the maximum in our 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:58.519
 bilateral relations but not to the detriment 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:01.290

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:11.549
 million dollars one of the promising 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.930
 areas of increased cooperation 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:15.360
