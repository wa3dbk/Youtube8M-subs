00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:15.240
 And then people here are the kowalski and 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.599
 I'm here first video of the series 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:21.119
 of weak channel and me pc games 

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:25.529
 I bring here Batman sells ans which is one 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:28.650
 very good game he is 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:32.640
 has children's graphics but it's a game 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:35.670
 good and good, he's cool because he's good 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.070
 faithful to the batman comic book in 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.949
 a very low limit of 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.190
 comics but I think it 's very faithful 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:45.930
 because he has a lot of equipment like that 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.850
 I 'll show you one by 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.900
 stay here 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.130
 face 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:55.460
 these guys here are not so weak 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:57.260
 so not a nice guy 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:02.990
 have to fasten them with the handcuffs 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:05.660
 after teachings back takes to lift 

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:07.490
 so I'm going to show here he has several 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:10.430
 equipment here you can see the 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.510
 bataan and beat this lipstick amid 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.060
 different 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.310
 this stuff here I do not know which is the 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.540
 handcuffs 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.010
 these other equipment that until now 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:27.320
 I did not use it 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:35.060
 so there are several people here 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:38.720
 well now I'm going to play my age is 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:40.430
 More or less because good you can not 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:47.330
 only operate the camera when you are in 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:51.670
 First person first mode wants 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.670
 attack the beckham indy already paid there 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:59.050
 Well, this is just a disadvantage. 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:01.580
 so the game is cool, cool 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:05.440
 Only finish this level for you to see. 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.440
 More or less, what's the game like? 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:10.040
 good the cast of the game is not it is not there 

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:12.020
 Big Deal 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:15.190
 I mean, I do not know, it would not be the game. 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.190
 You still can not say that. 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:27.170
 it looks like a children's game but it's in 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:32.240
 True, it's a rather childish game. 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:32.240
 but not so much it's a cool game 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:43.680
 the graphics and characters characters 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:47.930
 e infant medium itself such , but so 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.930
 not as childish as it seems not 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:57.960
 I'll go and do it here 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:03:01.200
 I'll leave it and I'll let it in 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:05.160
 description of the video the channel of the 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:09.240
 man I saw him doing this guinea 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:14.730
 It was a guy I do not remember now with the 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:17.370
 name of the channel since I never remember the name 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.500
 of the guy's channel but it looks like a 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.060
 Northeastern, something like this has been 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.500
 quite prominent 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:27.030
 do not have anything against northeasterners 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:29.160
 It's but it 's a good one anyway. 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:32.690
 channel he has recorded several various games 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.690
 so I 've been recording 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:37.500
 games so weak 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:45.370
 including the boot he has recorded and 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:49.590
 recorded hulk and spider man it seems that 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.590
 He recorded it too I 'm not remembered. 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:04:07.000
 will it fall some it ended up even twins 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:09.660
 died today the nursery stays here moves 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.660
 this was already 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:22.889
 good controls this game 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:26.930
 They are more or less, not like I said no 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:29.760
 Can you move the camera? 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:36.210
 the configuration buttons you use to 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:40.710
 to move in the residence ws is general is 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:46.350
 as a rule less so than the 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:49.110
 games to jump is the right button to the 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:51.900
 better that's what I think is better in 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:54.630
 right button on the left but the 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:05:04.260
 How much is fighting the right click gives 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:05:09.540
 a kick you have to use yours to guide 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:13.229
 that would be to put the gifts and 

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:18.700
 those he equips them all 

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:20.479
 It's good to rain 

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:24.860
 ah 

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:24.860
 so the shift is to defend itself 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:35.500
 And, what do you think, this is the game? 

00:05:33.789 --> 00:05:37.930
 It is a bit difficult to have a part that 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:41.939
 I'm very difficult here, not even 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:41.939
 I recorded her, not in the bar, right? 

00:05:42.689 --> 00:05:52.689
 I think cool but good, it was the video 

00:05:50.979 --> 00:05:58.030
 I hope you enjoyed signing up for the 

00:05:52.689 --> 00:06:01.690
 channel and talked until the next session only 

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:04.870
 to spend if you just want to see you here 

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:07.680
 To be bored , just to finish. 

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:07.680
 doing so a thing 

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:18.630
 obama that touches the eye in the decade and 

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:24.410
 occurs in eye shows 

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:24.410
 who knows about her but she will include 2005 

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:31.599
 traders holding the ball rolling 

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:36.740
 It's soon Batman, so stay here. 

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:40.930

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:40.930
