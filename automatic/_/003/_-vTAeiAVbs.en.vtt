best way to send pressure from dying
that's<00:00:09.150> way<00:00:09.360> too<00:00:09.420> well<00:00:09.960> one<00:00:10.230> of<00:00:10.290> the<00:00:10.349> best<00:00:10.469> way

from<00:00:31.410> an<00:00:31.560> e4<00:00:31.830> down<00:00:31.980> line<00:00:32.219> which<00:00:32.790> is<00:00:32.969> pretty

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
from an e4 down line which is pretty

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.569 
from an e4 down line which is pretty
pretty<00:00:34.290> important<00:00:34.710> in<00:00:34.890> terms<00:00:35.160> if<00:00:35.340> you<00:00:35.430> want

downline it's the same style way you can

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.030 
downline it's the same style way you can
get<00:00:39.210> pressure<00:00:39.450> but<00:00:39.719> wrap<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.410> get-go<00:00:40.710> I<00:00:40.829> mean

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
get pressure but wrap the get-go I mean

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.819 
get pressure but wrap the get-go I mean
we<00:00:41.309> can<00:00:41.460> run<00:00:41.579> a<00:00:41.610> man<00:00:42.329> in<00:00:42.570> zone<00:00:42.780> style<00:00:43.200> let<00:00:43.590> me<00:00:43.680> go

have a sewn version so we'll show you
here<00:00:48.629> there's<00:00:49.020> his<00:00:49.170> own<00:00:49.350> version<00:00:50.059> which

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:52.630 
here there's his own version which

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:55.500 
here there's his own version which
is<00:00:52.750> DB<00:00:53.680> blitz<00:00:53.920> too<00:00:54.100> so<00:00:54.880> I<00:00:54.910> come<00:00:55.150> out<00:00:55.240> in<00:00:55.330> DV

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:55.510 
is DB blitz too so I come out in DV

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:56.970 
is DB blitz too so I come out in DV
blitz<00:00:55.720> to<00:00:55.870> this<00:00:56.110> could<00:00:56.350> be<00:00:56.440> a<00:00:56.470> little<00:00:56.710> scheme

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:56.980 
blitz to this could be a little scheme

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.760 
blitz to this could be a little scheme
that<00:00:57.100> you<00:00:57.220> were<00:00:57.610> to<00:00:57.730> run<00:00:58.230> so<00:00:59.230> files<00:00:59.410> comes<00:00:59.620> out

00:00:59.760 --> 00:00:59.770 
that you were to run so files comes out

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:05.280 
that you were to run so files comes out
and<00:00:59.890> empty<00:01:00.270> and<00:01:02.040> picks<00:01:03.040> any<00:01:03.220> play<00:01:03.930> so<00:01:04.930> all<00:01:05.199> you

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:05.290 
and empty and picks any play so all you

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:07.500 
and empty and picks any play so all you
really<00:01:05.500> need<00:01:05.860> to<00:01:05.890> do<00:01:06.040> is<00:01:06.070> press<00:01:06.970> coverage<00:01:07.030> I

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:07.510 
really need to do is press coverage I

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:08.850 
really need to do is press coverage I
like<00:01:07.660> the<00:01:07.750> price<00:01:07.930> in<00:01:08.110> this<00:01:08.170> situation<00:01:08.440> slide

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:08.860 
like the price in this situation slide

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.690 
like the price in this situation slide
the<00:01:09.190> blitzing<00:01:09.930> corners<00:01:10.930> in<00:01:11.110> and<00:01:11.350> then<00:01:12.340> I<00:01:12.370> would

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:12.700 
the blitzing corners in and then I would

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:17.550 
the blitzing corners in and then I would
say<00:01:12.940> to<00:01:13.600> crash<00:01:14.320> your<00:01:14.500> line<00:01:14.650> out<00:01:16.080> like<00:01:17.080> so<00:01:17.320> and

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:17.560 
say to crash your line out like so and

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.770 
say to crash your line out like so and
then<00:01:17.590> you<00:01:18.250> should<00:01:18.640> be<00:01:18.729> able<00:01:18.760> to<00:01:18.970> generate<00:01:19.300> some

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 
then you should be able to generate some

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.030 
then you should be able to generate some
pretty<00:01:19.990> quick<00:01:20.200> pressure<00:01:20.440> off<00:01:20.650> the<00:01:20.770> edge<00:01:20.890> on

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:21.040 
pretty quick pressure off the edge on

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.700 
pretty quick pressure off the edge on
both<00:01:21.100> edges<00:01:21.460> so<00:01:21.820> snapping<00:01:22.180> the<00:01:22.240> ball<00:01:22.710> files

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710 
both edges so snapping the ball files

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:24.810 
both edges so snapping the ball files
ghost<00:01:23.950> what<00:01:24.340> we're<00:01:24.460> doing<00:01:24.610> is<00:01:24.670> we're

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:24.820 
ghost what we're doing is we're

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:26.690 
ghost what we're doing is we're
isolating<00:01:25.150> the<00:01:25.450> center<00:01:25.780> in<00:01:25.869> this<00:01:25.990> situation

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
isolating the center in this situation

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.760 
isolating the center in this situation
sending<00:01:27.700> six<00:01:28.000> and<00:01:28.300> we're<00:01:28.660> isolating<00:01:29.530> the

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770 
sending six and we're isolating the

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:31.440 
sending six and we're isolating the
center<00:01:29.979> so<00:01:30.130> he<00:01:30.310> can't<00:01:30.550> recover<00:01:30.820> and<00:01:31.180> pick<00:01:31.330> any

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:31.450 
center so he can't recover and pick any

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.120 
center so he can't recover and pick any
one<00:01:31.540> of<00:01:31.660> us<00:01:31.780> up<00:01:32.020> so<00:01:32.650> now<00:01:32.740> we're<00:01:32.860> going<00:01:32.950> to<00:01:33.009> get

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
one of us up so now we're going to get

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.090 
one of us up so now we're going to get
two<00:01:33.369> guys<00:01:33.640> free<00:01:34.030> off<00:01:34.210> both<00:01:34.509> edges<00:01:35.200> and<00:01:35.470> as<00:01:35.950> you

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
two guys free off both edges and as you

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.749 
two guys free off both edges and as you
can<00:01:36.250> see<00:01:36.280> the<00:01:36.610> pressure<00:01:36.850> is<00:01:37.119> pretty<00:01:37.500> intense

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
can see the pressure is pretty intense

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.100 
can see the pressure is pretty intense
and<00:01:39.759> we're<00:01:39.970> able<00:01:40.119> to<00:01:40.210> get<00:01:40.390> that<00:01:40.600> pressure<00:01:40.900> off

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110 
and we're able to get that pressure off

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.109 
and we're able to get that pressure off
the<00:01:41.259> edge<00:01:41.380> now<00:01:41.920> you<00:01:42.460> can<00:01:42.580> do<00:01:42.759> the<00:01:42.880> quick<00:01:43.030> eye

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:43.119 
the edge now you can do the quick eye

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:45.150 
the edge now you can do the quick eye
level<00:01:43.240> down<00:01:43.570> which<00:01:44.470> is<00:01:44.619> going<00:01:44.740> to<00:01:44.800> be<00:01:44.920> your

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:45.160 
level down which is going to be your

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:46.830 
level down which is going to be your
your<00:01:45.460> man<00:01:45.670> blitz<00:01:45.970> to<00:01:46.119> call<00:01:46.300> press<00:01:46.540> coverage

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
your man blitz to call press coverage

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.999 
your man blitz to call press coverage
again<00:01:47.940> slide<00:01:48.940> your<00:01:48.970> Seabees<00:01:49.960> in<00:01:49.990> crash<00:01:50.830> your

you're<00:01:53.680> going<00:01:53.890> to<00:01:53.950> change<00:01:54.190> out<00:01:54.340> the<00:01:54.610> coverage

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:54.910 
you're going to change out the coverage

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:57.510 
you're going to change out the coverage
behind<00:01:55.150> it<00:01:55.330> you're<00:01:55.690> going<00:01:55.810> to<00:01:55.869> send<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:57.280> line

slid a little bit there and pick the
pressure<00:01:59.110> up<00:01:59.319> but<00:01:59.530> the<00:01:59.679> idea<00:01:59.950> is<00:02:00.009> the<00:02:00.490> same<00:02:00.520> you

00:02:00.809 --> 00:02:00.819 
pressure up but the idea is the same you

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:02.309 
pressure up but the idea is the same you
want<00:02:01.030> to<00:02:01.090> try<00:02:01.240> and<00:02:01.390> change<00:02:01.600> the<00:02:01.720> coverage

00:02:04.169 --> 00:02:04.179 
behind it keep the pressure the same so

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:06.660 
behind it keep the pressure the same so
you're<00:02:04.300> going<00:02:04.390> to<00:02:04.450> send<00:02:04.630> his<00:02:04.720> own<00:02:04.840> and<00:02:05.080> man<00:02:05.670> lot

there's guys lined up over people so so

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:33.400 
there's guys lined up over people so so
there<00:03:31.760> now<00:03:31.940> that<00:03:32.120> this<00:03:32.300> time<00:03:32.540> I<00:03:32.570> sent<00:03:32.960> only<00:03:33.140> 5

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410 
there now that this time I sent only 5

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:35.710 
there now that this time I sent only 5
i'm<00:03:33.830> sending<00:03:34.070> five<00:03:34.310> there's<00:03:35.240> definitely

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:35.720 
i'm sending five there's definitely

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.450 
i'm sending five there's definitely
there's<00:03:35.780> ways<00:03:36.080> you<00:03:36.290> can<00:03:36.440> configure<00:03:36.980> that<00:03:37.250> so

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:37.460 
there's ways you can configure that so

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:38.830 
there's ways you can configure that so
then<00:03:37.610> you<00:03:37.820> can<00:03:37.940> check<00:03:38.210> it<00:03:38.330> down<00:03:38.480> to<00:03:38.630> sending

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
then you can check it down to sending

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.010 
then you can check it down to sending
for<00:03:39.140> and<00:03:39.820> you're<00:03:40.820> sending<00:03:41.060> for<00:03:41.240> one<00:03:41.480> edge<00:03:41.660> for

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:42.020 
for and you're sending for one edge for

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:43.510 
for and you're sending for one edge for
the<00:03:42.200> other<00:03:42.320> edge<00:03:42.530> and<00:03:42.890> then<00:03:43.130> you<00:03:43.220> make<00:03:43.340> up<00:03:43.460> the

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:43.520 
the other edge and then you make up the

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.220 
the other edge and then you make up the
coverage<00:03:43.790> is<00:03:43.940> so<00:03:44.480> now<00:03:44.720> you're<00:03:44.900> going<00:03:45.020> to<00:03:45.080> send

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230 
coverage is so now you're going to send

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:47.200 
coverage is so now you're going to send
one<00:03:45.440> guys<00:03:45.680> and<00:03:46.100> send<00:03:46.250> two<00:03:46.400> guys<00:03:46.610> and<00:03:46.970> you<00:03:47.060> can

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:47.210 
one guys and send two guys and you can

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:48.970 
one guys and send two guys and you can
play<00:03:47.390> coverage<00:03:47.870> max<00:03:48.170> coverage<00:03:48.500> two<00:03:48.710> min<00:03:48.860> under

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:48.980 
play coverage max coverage two min under

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:50.770 
play coverage max coverage two min under
so<00:03:49.430> you<00:03:49.490> can<00:03:49.730> see<00:03:49.850> how<00:03:49.880> complex<00:03:50.420> is<00:03:50.570> going<00:03:50.720> to

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
so you can see how complex is going to

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.480 
so you can see how complex is going to
start<00:03:50.930> to<00:03:51.050> get<00:03:51.260> as<00:03:51.650> you<00:03:51.890> learn<00:03:52.040> more<00:03:52.070> blitzes

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:52.490 
start to get as you learn more blitzes

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:55.150 
start to get as you learn more blitzes
how<00:03:53.270> to<00:03:53.330> say<00:03:53.510> I<00:03:53.750> mean<00:03:53.990> the<00:03:54.080> key<00:03:54.230> is<00:03:54.380> to<00:03:54.410> have<00:03:54.560> the

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:55.160 
how to say I mean the key is to have the

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.640 
how to say I mean the key is to have the
ability<00:03:55.550> to<00:03:55.580> send<00:03:55.880> one<00:03:56.150> guy<00:03:56.180> one<00:03:56.570> edge<00:03:56.750> then

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 
ability to send one guy one edge then

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:59.020 
ability to send one guy one edge then
send<00:03:57.980> the<00:03:58.070> guy<00:03:58.190> another<00:03:58.490> guy<00:03:58.580> off<00:03:58.790> the<00:03:58.880> other

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030 
send the guy another guy off the other

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:00.490 
send the guy another guy off the other
edge<00:03:59.180> and<00:03:59.450> then<00:03:59.900> be<00:03:59.990> able<00:04:00.020> to<00:04:00.140> send<00:04:00.290> them<00:04:00.380> both

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500 
edge and then be able to send them both

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.140 
edge and then be able to send them both
the<00:04:00.710> same<00:04:00.770> time<00:04:01.100> this<00:04:01.280> is<00:04:01.340> that's<00:04:01.640> the<00:04:01.760> key<00:04:01.970> to

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.150 
the same time this is that's the key to

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:04.570 
the same time this is that's the key to
any<00:04:02.330> formation<00:04:02.810> this<00:04:03.470> question<00:04:04.010> this<00:04:04.310> is<00:04:04.490> the

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:04.580 
any formation this question this is the

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:07.120 
any formation this question this is the
reason<00:04:04.700> the<00:04:04.940> guide<00:04:05.210> the<00:04:05.990> both<00:04:06.590> guides<00:04:06.860> are

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:07.130 
reason the guide the both guides are

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:08.980 
reason the guide the both guides are
over<00:04:07.550> hour<00:04:07.880> and<00:04:08.150> half<00:04:08.240> long<00:04:08.480> some<00:04:08.750> are<00:04:08.780> two

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:08.990 
over hour and half long some are two

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:10.810 
over hour and half long some are two
hours<00:04:09.290> long<00:04:09.470> because<00:04:10.160> we<00:04:10.250> go<00:04:10.370> through<00:04:10.580> all<00:04:10.700> the

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:10.820 
hours long because we go through all the

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:12.850 
hours long because we go through all the
stuff<00:04:11.050> Amy<00:04:12.050> just<00:04:12.170> get<00:04:12.320> you<00:04:12.410> the<00:04:12.470> mind<00:04:12.650> games

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:12.860 
stuff Amy just get you the mind games

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:13.900 
stuff Amy just get you the mind games
when<00:04:13.040> running<00:04:13.190> against<00:04:13.459> some<00:04:13.610> sample

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:13.910 
when running against some sample

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:14.980 
when running against some sample
formations<00:04:14.360> because<00:04:14.540> we<00:04:14.600> want<00:04:14.750> to<00:04:14.810> show<00:04:14.930> you

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:14.990 
formations because we want to show you

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:16.690 
formations because we want to show you
here's<00:04:15.650> how<00:04:15.740> it<00:04:15.800> looks<00:04:15.830> against<00:04:16.220> this<00:04:16.340> and<00:04:16.580> it

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:16.700 
here's how it looks against this and it

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:19.390 
here's how it looks against this and it
against<00:04:17.000> that<00:04:17.950> definitely<00:04:18.950> something<00:04:19.040> that's

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 
against that definitely something that's

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:20.920 
against that definitely something that's
pretty<00:04:19.700> good<00:04:19.850> especially<00:04:20.239> some<00:04:20.660> of<00:04:20.690> the<00:04:20.780> blitz

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:20.930 
pretty good especially some of the blitz

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:22.510 
pretty good especially some of the blitz
is<00:04:20.989> out<00:04:21.109> a<00:04:21.140> two-man<00:04:21.470> under<00:04:21.770> which<00:04:22.220> as<00:04:22.370> you<00:04:22.490> know

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:22.520 
is out a two-man under which as you know

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:23.560 
is out a two-man under which as you know
is<00:04:22.610> the<00:04:22.730> best<00:04:22.940> coverage<00:04:23.150> in<00:04:23.270> the<00:04:23.330> game<00:04:23.480> and

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:23.570 
is the best coverage in the game and

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:24.820 
is the best coverage in the game and
they<00:04:23.660> don't<00:04:23.750> get<00:04:23.990> a<00:04:24.050> guy<00:04:24.140> forgot<00:04:24.380> the<00:04:24.530> edgewood

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:24.830 
they don't get a guy forgot the edgewood

my concern is that they're not going to

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:43.150 
my concern is that they're not going to
