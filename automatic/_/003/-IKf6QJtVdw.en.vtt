that's a dinosaur it's dirty they got

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.480 
that's a dinosaur it's dirty they got
away<00:01:32.360> with<00:01:32.689> it<00:01:32.720> for<00:01:32.840> a<00:01:33.049> while<00:01:33.200> but<00:01:34.159> all

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
away with it for a while but all

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.819 
away with it for a while but all
industry<00:01:35.450> today<00:01:35.720> has<00:01:36.259> to<00:01:36.409> deal<00:01:36.560> with<00:01:36.680> its

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:36.829 
industry today has to deal with its

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:39.069 
industry today has to deal with its
waste<00:01:37.070> and<00:01:37.430> so<00:01:38.000> if<00:01:38.119> you're<00:01:38.240> gonna<00:01:38.420> farm<00:01:38.810> fish

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:39.079 
waste and so if you're gonna farm fish

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:41.050 
waste and so if you're gonna farm fish
in<00:01:39.259> the<00:01:39.350> ocean<00:01:39.740> that<00:01:39.770> would<00:01:40.159> seem<00:01:40.399> the<00:01:40.850> way<00:01:41.000> to

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
in the ocean that would seem the way to

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.649 
in the ocean that would seem the way to
go<00:01:41.439> if<00:01:42.439> different<00:01:43.040> countries<00:01:43.670> were<00:01:44.060> all

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:44.659 
go if different countries were all

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:48.850 
go if different countries were all
saying<00:01:45.290> at<00:01:45.439> the<00:01:45.530> same<00:01:45.740> time<00:01:46.180> that<00:01:47.380> we<00:01:48.380> we<00:01:48.710> don't

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 
saying at the same time that we we don't

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.130 
saying at the same time that we we don't
want<00:01:49.310> our<00:01:49.490> waters<00:01:49.880> to<00:01:50.000> be<00:01:50.030> polluted<00:01:50.600> this

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
want our waters to be polluted this

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.219 
want our waters to be polluted this
stuff<00:01:51.409> belongs<00:01:51.770> into

stuff belongs into

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:57.169

then<00:01:53.799> the<00:01:54.729> price<00:01:54.939> would<00:01:55.149> go<00:01:55.479> up<00:01:55.960> a<00:01:56.259> little<00:01:56.469> bit

00:01:57.169 --> 00:01:57.179 
then the price would go up a little bit

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:00.599 
then the price would go up a little bit
but<00:01:58.179> it<00:01:58.299> wouldn't<00:01:58.539> matter<00:01:58.829> because<00:01:59.829> again

00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:00.609 
but it wouldn't matter because again

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:04.109 
but it wouldn't matter because again
