chapter<00:00:12.360> Toby's<00:00:12.690> mass<00:00:12.870> cracked<00:00:13.380> leading<00:00:14.250> up

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
chapter Toby's mass cracked leading up

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.220 
chapter Toby's mass cracked leading up
to<00:00:14.460> him<00:00:14.610> finally<00:00:15.089> being<00:00:15.240> revealed<00:00:15.450> in<00:00:15.929> just<00:00:16.139> a

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
to him finally being revealed in just a

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.010 
to him finally being revealed in just a
few<00:00:16.410> weeks<00:00:16.470> I<00:00:17.070> cannot<00:00:17.730> wait<00:00:17.970> for<00:00:18.150> that<00:00:18.300> and<00:00:18.570> at

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
few weeks I cannot wait for that and at

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.050 
few weeks I cannot wait for that and at
first<00:00:19.050> I<00:00:19.380> thought<00:00:19.650> that<00:00:20.310> his<00:00:20.400> mask<00:00:20.640> cracked

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
first I thought that his mask cracked

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.450 
first I thought that his mask cracked
just<00:00:21.480> because<00:00:21.779> Naruto's<00:00:22.320> chakra<00:00:22.590> was<00:00:23.310> so

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
just because Naruto's chakra was so

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.120 
just because Naruto's chakra was so
strong<00:00:23.760> I<00:00:24.000> thought<00:00:24.240> maybe<00:00:25.109> if<00:00:25.560> the<00:00:25.859> attacks

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
strong I thought maybe if the attacks

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.640 
strong I thought maybe if the attacks
powerful<00:00:26.609> enough<00:00:26.849> he<00:00:27.029> can't<00:00:27.300> fully<00:00:27.779> you

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
powerful enough he can't fully you

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.230 
powerful enough he can't fully you
protect<00:00:29.099> himself<00:00:29.250> from<00:00:29.490> it<00:00:29.760> maybe<00:00:29.939> you<00:00:30.090> can

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
protect himself from it maybe you can

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.269 
protect himself from it maybe you can
hit<00:00:30.330> him<00:00:30.480> a<00:00:30.510> little<00:00:30.689> bit<00:00:30.750> anyway<00:00:31.109> but<00:00:32.099> that's

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
hit him a little bit anyway but that's

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.790 
hit him a little bit anyway but that's
not<00:00:32.460> true<00:00:32.759> Kakashi<00:00:33.630> kind<00:00:34.050> of<00:00:34.140> gets<00:00:34.290> a<00:00:34.350> theory

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
not true Kakashi kind of gets a theory

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.380 
not true Kakashi kind of gets a theory
that<00:00:35.809> his<00:00:36.809> kunai<00:00:37.590> that<00:00:38.010> he<00:00:38.219> threw<00:00:38.579> is<00:00:38.790> what

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
that his kunai that he threw is what

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:40.790 
that his kunai that he threw is what
caused<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:39.809> crack<00:00:39.989> in<00:00:40.110> his<00:00:40.200> mask<00:00:40.440> because<00:00:40.620> he

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
caused the crack in his mask because he

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.220 
caused the crack in his mask because he
realized<00:00:41.190> that<00:00:41.340> Toby<00:00:41.760> did<00:00:42.030> stop<00:00:42.390> his<00:00:42.690> coma<00:00:42.960> we

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
realized that Toby did stop his coma we

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.319 
realized that Toby did stop his coma we
but<00:00:44.040> no<00:00:44.340> one<00:00:44.460> should<00:00:44.610> be<00:00:44.730> able<00:00:44.789> to<00:00:44.969> do<00:00:45.090> that<00:00:45.270> and

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
but no one should be able to do that and

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.010 
but no one should be able to do that and
he<00:00:45.539> starts<00:00:45.840> thinking<00:00:46.050> exactly<00:00:46.800> how<00:00:47.430> Toby's

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:48.020 
he starts thinking exactly how Toby's

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.350 
he starts thinking exactly how Toby's
jutsu<00:00:49.020> works<00:00:49.320> and<00:00:49.680> it's<00:00:50.280> not<00:00:50.430> fully<00:00:50.820> explained

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
jutsu works and it's not fully explained

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.479 
jutsu works and it's not fully explained
in<00:00:51.510> this<00:00:51.600> chapter<00:00:51.899> but<00:00:52.770> I'm<00:00:52.920> sure<00:00:53.100> it<00:00:53.190> will<00:00:53.309> be

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
in this chapter but I'm sure it will be

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.600 
in this chapter but I'm sure it will be
and<00:00:53.699> we<00:00:53.789> kind<00:00:54.030> of<00:00:54.120> get<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.360> gist<00:00:54.660> of<00:00:54.840> it<00:00:54.989> and<00:00:55.610> so

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
and we kind of get the gist of it and so

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.970 
and we kind of get the gist of it and so
they<00:00:56.730> do<00:00:56.820> a<00:00:56.850> combo<00:00:57.300> attack<00:00:57.600> be<00:00:57.870> throws<00:00:58.320> them

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
they do a combo attack be throws them

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.250 
they do a combo attack be throws them
guy<00:00:59.730> attacks<00:01:00.270> with<00:01:00.420> some<00:01:00.570> nunchucks<00:01:00.989> gets

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
guy attacks with some nunchucks gets

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.590 
guy attacks with some nunchucks gets
behind<00:01:01.410> him<00:01:01.710> distracts<00:01:02.309> them<00:01:02.430> Naruto<00:01:03.420> comes

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
behind him distracts them Naruto comes

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.179 
behind him distracts them Naruto comes
out<00:01:03.719> and<00:01:03.840> with<00:01:03.930> a<00:01:03.960> rasengan<00:01:04.320> but<00:01:04.769> it<00:01:04.830> doesn't

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
out and with a rasengan but it doesn't

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.179 
out and with a rasengan but it doesn't
hit<00:01:05.339> it<00:01:05.489> misses<00:01:05.880> but<00:01:06.420> Kakashi<00:01:06.750> uses<00:01:07.140> kamui<00:01:07.619> to

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
hit it misses but Kakashi uses kamui to

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
make the Rasengan go away but Toby just

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.410 
make the Rasengan go away but Toby just
thinks<00:01:10.439> that<00:01:10.470> Naruto<00:01:11.070> ended<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:11.939> Russian<00:01:12.240> gun

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
thinks that Naruto ended the Russian gun

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.330 
thinks that Naruto ended the Russian gun
because<00:01:12.689> it<00:01:12.840> missed<00:01:13.110> but<00:01:13.770> then<00:01:13.920> Kakashi

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
because it missed but then Kakashi

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.120 
because it missed but then Kakashi
brings<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.909> Rasengan<00:01:15.420> back<00:01:15.780> and<00:01:16.049> hits<00:01:16.650> Toby

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259

Toby<00:01:19.560> of<00:01:19.650> his<00:01:20.130> arm<00:01:20.430> just<00:01:20.549> boom<00:01:21.330> it<00:01:22.020> doesn't

hit they can figure out a way I didn't
know<00:01:40.560> that<00:01:40.590> Kakashi<00:01:41.119> using<00:01:42.119> that<00:01:42.210> technique

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
know that Kakashi using that technique

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.480 
know that Kakashi using that technique
could<00:01:42.930> bring<00:01:43.229> things<00:01:43.560> back<00:01:43.710> from<00:01:44.280> that

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
could bring things back from that

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:45.800 
could bring things back from that
dimension<00:01:44.970> because<00:01:45.180> I<00:01:45.390> don't<00:01:45.540> know<00:01:45.570> if<00:01:45.659> we'd

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
dimension because I don't know if we'd

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:46.940 
dimension because I don't know if we'd
ever<00:01:45.899> really<00:01:46.170> seen<00:01:46.320> that<00:01:46.470> happen<00:01:46.649> but

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
ever really seen that happen but

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.560 
ever really seen that happen but
apparently<00:01:47.399> he<00:01:47.490> can<00:01:47.520> and<00:01:47.970> it<00:01:48.149> kind<00:01:48.360> of<00:01:48.420> makes

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
apparently he can and it kind of makes

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.760 
apparently he can and it kind of makes
sense<00:01:48.780> so<00:01:49.880> that<00:01:50.880> kind<00:01:51.240> of<00:01:51.420> further<00:01:52.200> leads<00:01:52.530> into

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
sense so that kind of further leads into

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
sense so that kind of further leads into
the<00:01:52.860> theory<00:01:53.220> that<00:01:53.250> tobi<00:01:53.670> is<00:01:53.700> obito<00:01:53.850> or<00:01:55.790> obito's

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
the theory that tobi is obito or obito's

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.690 
the theory that tobi is obito or obito's
relative<00:01:57.719> like<00:01:58.049> his<00:01:58.229> father<00:01:58.469> because<00:01:59.399> it's

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
relative like his father because it's

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.609 
relative like his father because it's
basically<00:01:59.880> confirmed<00:02:00.479> that<00:02:00.659> he<00:02:00.780> is<00:02:00.869> using<00:02:01.140> the

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
basically confirmed that he is using the

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.510 
basically confirmed that he is using the
same<00:02:01.950> jutsu<00:02:02.579> or<00:02:03.060> an<00:02:03.479> advanced<00:02:04.140> version<00:02:04.560> of<00:02:05.009> the

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
same jutsu or an advanced version of the

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.150 
same jutsu or an advanced version of the
jutsu<00:02:05.820> that<00:02:05.850> Kakashi<00:02:06.390> uses<00:02:06.869> which<00:02:07.710> comes<00:02:07.979> from

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
jutsu that Kakashi uses which comes from

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.760 
jutsu that Kakashi uses which comes from
obito's<00:02:08.910> I<00:02:09.149> so<00:02:09.750> really<00:02:10.080> at<00:02:10.200> this<00:02:10.319> point<00:02:10.410> I

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
obito's I so really at this point I

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.380 
obito's I so really at this point I
don't<00:02:10.950> see<00:02:11.160> how<00:02:11.340> you<00:02:11.400> could<00:02:11.760> think<00:02:11.819> it's<00:02:12.120> not

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
don't see how you could think it's not

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.640 
don't see how you could think it's not
obito<00:02:13.050> or<00:02:13.319> OB

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
obito or OB

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.759 
obito or OB
father<00:02:14.010> or<00:02:14.640> someone<00:02:15.540> like<00:02:15.840> that<00:02:15.900> so<00:02:16.590> it<00:02:16.650> was

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:16.769 
father or someone like that so it was

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:18.229 
father or someone like that so it was
really<00:02:16.890> cool<00:02:17.099> to<00:02:17.159> see<00:02:17.310> Toby<00:02:17.670> get<00:02:17.790> a<00:02:17.819> hit<00:02:18.030> there

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239 
really cool to see Toby get a hit there

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:19.580 
really cool to see Toby get a hit there
finally<00:02:18.569> making<00:02:18.720> progress<00:02:18.840> on<00:02:19.230> this<00:02:19.379> guy<00:02:19.560> I

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
finally making progress on this guy I

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.899 
finally making progress on this guy I
think<00:02:19.950> it's<00:02:20.069> just<00:02:20.129> gonna<00:02:20.400> focus<00:02:20.670> on<00:02:20.909> this<00:02:21.470> for

00:02:22.899 --> 00:02:22.909 
think it's just gonna focus on this for

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:25.699 
think it's just gonna focus on this for
pretty<00:02:23.909> much<00:02:23.939> until<00:02:24.390> toby<00:02:24.959> is<00:02:25.079> revealed<00:02:25.500> I

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
pretty much until toby is revealed I

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:26.929 
pretty much until toby is revealed I
don't<00:02:26.159> think<00:02:26.280> it's<00:02:26.370> going<00:02:26.459> to<00:02:26.549> cut<00:02:26.730> back<00:02:26.909> to

00:02:26.929 --> 00:02:26.939 
don't think it's going to cut back to

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:30.020 
don't think it's going to cut back to
Sasuke<00:02:27.569> or<00:02:27.840> to<00:02:28.829> the<00:02:28.860> kages<00:02:29.370> maybe<00:02:29.610> it'll<00:02:29.819> cut

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
Sasuke or to the kages maybe it'll cut

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.599 
Sasuke or to the kages maybe it'll cut
to<00:02:30.269> Sasuke<00:02:30.900> learning<00:02:31.739> about<00:02:31.980> what's<00:02:32.220> going<00:02:32.400> on

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:32.609 
to Sasuke learning about what's going on

00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:34.670 
to Sasuke learning about what's going on
and<00:02:32.879> they'll<00:02:33.030> explain<00:02:33.450> who<00:02:33.840> toby<00:02:34.230> is<00:02:34.379> at<00:02:34.590> the

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
and they'll explain who toby is at the

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:35.839 
and they'll explain who toby is at the
same<00:02:34.799> time<00:02:35.010> that<00:02:35.189> they<00:02:35.280> show<00:02:35.430> it<00:02:35.459> but<00:02:35.670> I<00:02:35.730> don't

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:35.849 
same time that they show it but I don't

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:37.130 
same time that they show it but I don't
think<00:02:36.030> so<00:02:36.209> i<00:02:36.239> think<00:02:36.299> it's<00:02:36.510> just<00:02:36.599> gonna<00:02:36.900> focus

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
think so i think it's just gonna focus

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.890 
think so i think it's just gonna focus
on<00:02:37.379> this<00:02:37.909> which<00:02:38.909> is<00:02:39.060> great<00:02:39.299> that's<00:02:39.689> what<00:02:39.870> i

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
on this which is great that's what i

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.089 
on this which is great that's what i
want<00:02:40.079> to<00:02:40.140> see<00:02:40.260> right<00:02:40.409> now<00:02:40.439> I<00:02:40.530> wanted<00:02:40.950> to<00:02:41.010> get

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099 
want to see right now I wanted to get

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:42.949 
want to see right now I wanted to get
the<00:02:41.220> answer<00:02:41.340> from<00:02:41.549> Sasuke<00:02:42.180> but<00:02:42.569> now<00:02:42.689> that<00:02:42.870> we

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
the answer from Sasuke but now that we

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:44.240 
the answer from Sasuke but now that we
know<00:02:42.989> that<00:02:43.140> Toby's<00:02:43.590> identity<00:02:43.950> is<00:02:44.010> going<00:02:44.129> to<00:02:44.189> be

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
know that Toby's identity is going to be

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:45.949 
know that Toby's identity is going to be
revealed<00:02:44.489> soon<00:02:44.579> I<00:02:44.939> really<00:02:45.540> want<00:02:45.720> to<00:02:45.750> see<00:02:45.930> that

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
revealed soon I really want to see that

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:47.509 
revealed soon I really want to see that
and<00:02:46.349> one<00:02:46.799> other<00:02:46.829> interesting<00:02:47.129> thing<00:02:47.489> that

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 
and one other interesting thing that

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:49.699 
and one other interesting thing that
happened<00:02:47.639> in<00:02:47.940> this<00:02:48.060> chapter<00:02:48.379> Toby<00:02:49.379> used<00:02:49.590> a

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
happened in this chapter Toby used a

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.559 
happened in this chapter Toby used a
technique<00:02:49.920> is<00:02:50.280> a<00:02:50.400> barrier<00:02:50.639> technique<00:02:51.269> of<00:02:51.389> fire

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:51.569 
technique is a barrier technique of fire

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:55.009 
technique is a barrier technique of fire
jutsu<00:02:52.049> called<00:02:52.349> coochie<00:02:52.680> ha<00:02:53.010> chi<00:02:53.310> engine<00:02:54.019> so

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
jutsu called coochie ha chi engine so

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:57.349 
jutsu called coochie ha chi engine so
that's<00:02:55.709> an<00:02:55.799> Uchiha<00:02:56.220> technique<00:02:56.609> obviously<00:02:57.180> has

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:57.359 
that's an Uchiha technique obviously has

00:02:57.359 --> 00:02:59.899 
that's an Uchiha technique obviously has
a<00:02:57.389> cheetah<00:02:57.720> in<00:02:57.840> the<00:02:57.930> name<00:02:58.079> so<00:02:58.829> does<00:02:59.579> that<00:02:59.639> mean

00:02:59.899 --> 00:02:59.909 
a cheetah in the name so does that mean

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:02.420 
a cheetah in the name so does that mean
that<00:02:59.970> he<00:03:00.090> is<00:03:00.180> an<00:03:00.689> Uchiha<00:03:01.200> I<00:03:01.439> suppose<00:03:02.159> it's

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
that he is an Uchiha I suppose it's

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.190 
that he is an Uchiha I suppose it's
possible<00:03:02.459> for<00:03:02.760> nan<00:03:03.000> og<00:03:03.239> else<00:03:03.359> to<00:03:03.480> use<00:03:03.629> it<00:03:03.810> but<00:03:03.959> I

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
possible for nan og else to use it but I

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.800 
possible for nan og else to use it but I
mean<00:03:04.400> she<00:03:05.400> Hawkeye<00:03:05.879> and<00:03:06.060> didn't<00:03:06.269> you<00:03:06.329> think<00:03:06.569> so

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
mean she Hawkeye and didn't you think so

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.649 
mean she Hawkeye and didn't you think so
again<00:03:07.439> maybe<00:03:07.920> he<00:03:08.099> really<00:03:08.310> is<00:03:08.340> an<00:03:08.519> Uchiha<00:03:08.879> but

00:03:09.649 --> 00:03:09.659 
again maybe he really is an Uchiha but

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:11.179 
again maybe he really is an Uchiha but
that's<00:03:09.810> pretty<00:03:09.930> much<00:03:10.049> it<00:03:10.170> they<00:03:10.709> got<00:03:10.950> a<00:03:10.980> good

00:03:11.179 --> 00:03:11.189 
that's pretty much it they got a good

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:12.259 
that's pretty much it they got a good
clean<00:03:11.370> hit<00:03:11.519> on<00:03:11.609> Toby<00:03:11.909> that<00:03:12.030> was<00:03:12.120> pretty

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
clean hit on Toby that was pretty

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:14.330 
clean hit on Toby that was pretty
awesome<00:03:12.359> we<00:03:13.139> don't<00:03:13.290> really<00:03:13.470> fully<00:03:13.769> understand

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
awesome we don't really fully understand

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.339 
awesome we don't really fully understand
I<00:03:14.609> don't<00:03:14.670> understand<00:03:15.120> how<00:03:15.180> he<00:03:15.299> could<00:03:15.750> make<00:03:16.019> the

00:03:16.339 --> 00:03:16.349 
I don't understand how he could make the

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:17.750 
I don't understand how he could make the
kunai<00:03:16.739> disappear<00:03:17.310> and<00:03:17.459> that's<00:03:17.579> somehow

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
kunai disappear and that's somehow

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.619 
kunai disappear and that's somehow
cracks<00:03:18.120> his<00:03:18.269> mask<00:03:18.540> but<00:03:19.260> it<00:03:19.349> seems<00:03:19.680> like<00:03:20.629> since

00:03:21.619 --> 00:03:21.629 
cracks his mask but it seems like since

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:25.250 
cracks his mask but it seems like since
it's<00:03:21.930> one<00:03:22.169> jutsu<00:03:22.470> to<00:03:23.190> make<00:03:23.400> you<00:03:24.150> know<00:03:24.269> things

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
it's one jutsu to make you know things

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:26.780 
it's one jutsu to make you know things
appear<00:03:25.709> and<00:03:25.829> disappear<00:03:25.859> with<00:03:26.340> their<00:03:26.519> was<00:03:26.609> I

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
appear and disappear with their was I

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.330 
appear and disappear with their was I
and<00:03:27.180> to<00:03:27.690> dematerialize<00:03:28.079> his<00:03:28.620> body<00:03:28.829> it<00:03:29.129> seems

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
and to dematerialize his body it seems

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.129 
and to dematerialize his body it seems
like<00:03:29.519> he<00:03:29.669> sends<00:03:30.030> parts<00:03:30.299> of<00:03:30.419> his<00:03:30.540> body<00:03:30.690> to<00:03:31.019> that

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:31.139 
like he sends parts of his body to that

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:32.599 
like he sends parts of his body to that
other<00:03:31.319> dimension<00:03:31.859> that's<00:03:32.040> how<00:03:32.220> it's<00:03:32.400> one

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:32.609 
other dimension that's how it's one

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:34.309 
other dimension that's how it's one
jutsu<00:03:32.819> but<00:03:33.510> I<00:03:33.569> still<00:03:33.720> don't<00:03:33.900> understand<00:03:34.230> how

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:34.319 
jutsu but I still don't understand how

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:36.530 
jutsu but I still don't understand how
the<00:03:34.440> kunai<00:03:34.919> could<00:03:35.280> have<00:03:35.370> I<00:03:35.579> don't<00:03:36.090> get<00:03:36.389> that

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
the kunai could have I don't get that

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.119 
the kunai could have I don't get that
part<00:03:36.780> but<00:03:37.139> I'm<00:03:37.290> sure<00:03:37.440> that<00:03:37.470> will<00:03:37.680> be<00:03:37.709> explained

00:03:38.119 --> 00:03:38.129 
part but I'm sure that will be explained

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:41.119 
part but I'm sure that will be explained
in<00:03:38.159> the<00:03:38.340> next<00:03:38.370> chapter<00:03:39.079> so<00:03:40.079> that's<00:03:40.590> pretty
