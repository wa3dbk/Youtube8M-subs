00:02:06.809 --> 00:02:06.819 
money then just look right here I can't

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:08.609 
money then just look right here I can't
afford<00:02:06.969> a<00:02:07.299> one<00:02:07.509> ounce<00:02:07.659> coin<00:02:08.050> with<00:02:08.229> all<00:02:08.410> this

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
afford a one ounce coin with all this

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:11.700 
afford a one ounce coin with all this
but<00:02:09.580> guess<00:02:09.729> what<00:02:09.940> I<00:02:10.060> can<00:02:10.240> afford<00:02:10.410> five<00:02:11.410> gold

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:11.710 
but guess what I can afford five gold

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:14.399 
but guess what I can afford five gold
coins<00:02:12.069> for<00:02:13.060> four<00:02:13.450> gold<00:02:13.629> coins<00:02:13.750> in<00:02:14.110> one<00:02:14.260> little

00:02:14.399 --> 00:02:14.409 
coins for four gold coins in one little

00:02:14.409 --> 00:02:16.800 
coins for four gold coins in one little
bar<00:02:14.680> to<00:02:15.040> be<00:02:15.159> right<00:02:15.340> and<00:02:15.670> I<00:02:16.450> think<00:02:16.510> it's<00:02:16.720> a

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
bar to be right and I think it's a

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.140 
bar to be right and I think it's a
little<00:02:16.930> collection

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
little collection

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.500 
little collection
in<00:02:18.330> the<00:02:19.170> past<00:02:19.440> I<00:02:19.769> used<00:02:20.040> to<00:02:20.190> have<00:02:20.400> a<00:02:20.790> couple<00:02:21.269> gold

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
in the past I used to have a couple gold

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.600 
in the past I used to have a couple gold
one<00:02:21.810> ounce<00:02:21.930> coins<00:02:22.349> in<00:02:22.680> a<00:02:22.800> quarter<00:02:23.099> ounce<00:02:23.250> coin

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
one ounce coins in a quarter ounce coin

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.910 
one ounce coins in a quarter ounce coin
but<00:02:23.970> I<00:02:24.209> ended<00:02:24.840> up<00:02:24.989> studying<00:02:25.290> more<00:02:25.739> into

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
but I ended up studying more into

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.160 
but I ended up studying more into
precious<00:02:26.250> metals<00:02:26.640> and<00:02:26.790> I<00:02:26.879> found<00:02:27.150> out<00:02:27.330> how<00:02:28.050> much

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
precious metals and I found out how much

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.410 
precious metals and I found out how much
better<00:02:28.440> of<00:02:28.650> investment<00:02:29.190> silver<00:02:29.519> is<00:02:29.700> so<00:02:30.390> I

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
better of investment silver is so I

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.240 
better of investment silver is so I
ended<00:02:30.690> up<00:02:30.810> switching<00:02:31.019> most<00:02:31.500> of<00:02:31.620> my<00:02:31.709> gold<00:02:31.950> over

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
ended up switching most of my gold over

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.760 
ended up switching most of my gold over
to<00:02:32.340> silver
