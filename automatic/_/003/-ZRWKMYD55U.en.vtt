sort like it's just a ton of trees um
this<00:01:26.220> is<00:01:26.369> way<00:01:26.549> faster<00:01:26.759> than<00:01:27.030> individually

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
this is way faster than individually

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.330 
this is way faster than individually
destroying<00:01:28.380> all<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.530> trees<00:01:28.829> you<00:01:28.979> just<00:01:29.189> send
