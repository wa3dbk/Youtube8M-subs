 Well. this is the NLvissers channel. So this is our first video. 

00:00:15.956 --> 00:00:19.378
 And today we are going fishing with the fixed pole. Let's just explain the method 

00:00:19.546 --> 00:00:28.730
 We slide a tube onto this. We do this at the top of the rod. 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:36.873
 You do that on it 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:43.276
 You have to pull the thread between here. And then you throw it out. 

00:01:04.716 --> 00:01:06.716
 Then you get this. 

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:14.821
 Well, I'll just put it on the standard 

00:01:44.434 --> 00:01:51.430
 Now we are going to take a look. 

00:02:03.325 --> 00:02:07.270
 And then we throw it in the water. 

00:02:13.536 --> 00:02:21.880
 You can see that it is on the water, so that is not good. He needs something down. 

00:02:39.494 --> 00:02:44.320
 Slightly down, there is a lot of junk in the water! 

00:02:55.108 --> 00:02:58.920
 So that the tip is just above the surface. 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:03.570
 Well that's how good he is. 

00:03:04.571 --> 00:03:14.920
 Well, now we're going to put on the maggots. 2 maggots, they always do well. 

00:03:22.611 --> 00:03:31.730
 You now grab the hook, and you puncture the maad through the (tough) sheet. 

00:03:33.035 --> 00:03:40.000
 So. Another one. 

00:03:41.313 --> 00:03:44.440
 So beautiful in the skin, and so you can go fishing. 

00:03:44.437 --> 00:03:53.580
 Okay, now we go fishing. I throw it in the water and put it down. 

00:03:54.201 --> 00:03:55.790
 And now it's waiting. 

00:03:56.565 --> 00:04:03.400
 This is our bait food, it is a bit lumpy. But if you have a sieve you have to sift it. 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.740
 We have corn in between. 

00:04:10.475 --> 00:04:13.330
 And maggots too. 

00:04:14.152 --> 00:04:24.480
 Mix well, mix with water. Not too wet, nor too dry. So that you can make a ball in 1 pinch movement. 

00:04:24.481 --> 00:04:32.360
 And then it's just right. Then with the fixed rod 2-3 balls in it (per hour) 

00:04:33.716 --> 00:04:40.920
 Now we are going to throw one by the rod. So. And now wait! 

00:04:47.582 --> 00:04:58.390
 Well we have just gone to another place, the other place was not a good place. So now we have gone somewhere else, and we hope that we will have a bit 

00:04:59.332 --> 00:05:09.620
 Here we are now, it is a beautiful place. Can you show me? 

00:05:11.418 --> 00:05:12.770
 Well that was the place! 

00:05:13.145 --> 00:05:17.560
 We changed bait, first we used maggots and now bread. 

00:05:18.788 --> 00:05:27.030
 You grab the hook like this. You make a scoop of your bread, not too big. Then you put it on in no time. 

00:05:32.995 --> 00:05:37.620
 So that the tip protrudes like this. And now you can go fishing. 

00:05:53.704 --> 00:05:57.920
 No big fish. -We have a bite! 

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:06.130
 I think a roach. Now we are going to take it off. 

00:06:18.882 --> 00:06:23.060
 -Let him see it. Well this is him. 

00:06:24.311 --> 00:06:28.420
 Now we are going to release him. 

00:06:33.744 --> 00:06:38.340
 And there he goes again! On to the next! 

00:06:45.424 --> 00:06:49.650
 Not a big one, but always nice! 

00:06:49.653 --> 00:06:53.760
 We are going to release him again. 

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:17.350
 -Let me see! 

00:07:28.797 --> 00:07:31.240
 The fourth. 

00:07:45.983 --> 00:07:49.860
 We release him again. -Good idea! 

00:07:55.214 --> 00:07:58.880
 And there he goes! 

00:08:00.417 --> 00:16:06.700
 - And is the catch going well today? Yes we already have 5 so it is going well.
