00:00:01.619 --> 00:00:03.499 

the<00:00:02.250> biggest<00:00:02.730> thing<00:00:02.940> that<00:00:02.969> you<00:00:03.270> need<00:00:03.480> to

00:00:03.499 --> 00:00:03.509 
the biggest thing that you need to

00:00:03.509 --> 00:00:05.990 
the biggest thing that you need to
master<00:00:03.810> is<00:00:04.290> which<00:00:04.710> stabilizer<00:00:05.399> goes<00:00:05.759> with

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
master is which stabilizer goes with

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.449 
master is which stabilizer goes with
which<00:00:06.270> fabric<00:00:06.870> once<00:00:07.379> you<00:00:07.560> have<00:00:07.740> the<00:00:07.859> basics

00:00:08.449 --> 00:00:08.459 
which fabric once you have the basics

00:00:08.459 --> 00:00:11.359 
which fabric once you have the basics
then<00:00:08.850> you<00:00:09.360> can<00:00:09.660> start<00:00:09.990> to<00:00:10.139> experiment<00:00:10.799> here's

00:00:11.359 --> 00:00:11.369 
then you can start to experiment here's

00:00:11.369 --> 00:00:13.010 
then you can start to experiment here's
the<00:00:11.549> thing<00:00:11.730> with<00:00:11.879> stabilizer<00:00:12.420> you<00:00:12.809> get

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:13.020 
the thing with stabilizer you get

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:16.189 
the thing with stabilizer you get
strength<00:00:13.469> with<00:00:13.949> layers<00:00:14.459> so<00:00:15.209> I<00:00:15.510> always<00:00:15.959> use<00:00:16.170> a

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
strength with layers so I always use a

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.769 
strength with layers so I always use a
minimum<00:00:16.770> of<00:00:16.949> two<00:00:17.220> layers<00:00:17.490> of<00:00:17.699> stabilizer<00:00:18.000> now

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
minimum of two layers of stabilizer now

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.659 
minimum of two layers of stabilizer now
if<00:00:19.080> you're<00:00:19.259> going<00:00:19.410> to<00:00:19.529> just<00:00:19.710> use<00:00:19.859> one<00:00:19.890> you

00:00:20.659 --> 00:00:20.669 
if you're going to just use one you

00:00:20.669 --> 00:00:21.950 
if you're going to just use one you
might<00:00:20.910> not<00:00:21.089> get<00:00:21.240> the<00:00:21.390> results<00:00:21.810> you're<00:00:21.900> looking

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
might not get the results you're looking

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.540 
might not get the results you're looking
for<00:00:22.259> and<00:00:22.560> that's<00:00:22.679> going<00:00:22.859> to<00:00:22.919> depend<00:00:23.189> on<00:00:23.339> how

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
for and that's going to depend on how

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.849 
for and that's going to depend on how
many<00:00:23.609> stitches<00:00:24.509> are<00:00:24.839> in<00:00:24.869> a<00:00:25.050> design<00:00:25.349> if<00:00:25.560> it's<00:00:25.740> a

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
many stitches are in a design if it's a

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.679 
many stitches are in a design if it's a
very<00:00:26.160> heavily<00:00:26.730> stitch<00:00:27.119> design<00:00:27.480> like<00:00:27.659> a

tiger's face you're going to need more
stabilizer<00:00:30.390> two<00:00:31.050> maybe<00:00:31.679> three<00:00:32.220> depending<00:00:32.970> on

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
stabilizer two maybe three depending on

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.700 
stabilizer two maybe three depending on
the<00:00:33.239> fabric<00:00:33.450> that<00:00:33.810> you're<00:00:33.960> working<00:00:34.140> with<00:00:34.350> so

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
the fabric that you're working with so

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.160 
the fabric that you're working with so
let<00:00:35.520> me<00:00:35.610> kind<00:00:35.730> of<00:00:35.850> go<00:00:35.970> down<00:00:36.000> a<00:00:36.450> quick<00:00:36.810> little

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
let me kind of go down a quick little

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.380 
let me kind of go down a quick little
way<00:00:37.410> to<00:00:37.440> remember<00:00:37.890> so<00:00:38.400> if<00:00:38.640> your<00:00:38.910> fabric

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
way to remember so if your fabric

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.800 
way to remember so if your fabric
stretches<00:00:40.020> so<00:00:40.590> you<00:00:40.680> have<00:00:41.010> t-shirts

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:41.810 
stretches so you have t-shirts

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:44.900 
stretches so you have t-shirts
sweatshirts<00:00:42.810> that<00:00:43.500> type<00:00:44.070> of<00:00:44.190> thing<00:00:44.370> you<00:00:44.610> need

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
sweatshirts that type of thing you need

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.300 
sweatshirts that type of thing you need
to<00:00:45.090> use<00:00:45.330> a<00:00:45.360> cutaway<00:00:46.020> stabilizer<00:00:46.310> this

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:47.310 
to use a cutaway stabilizer this

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:50.090 
to use a cutaway stabilizer this
stabilizer<00:00:47.910> is<00:00:48.210> literally<00:00:48.810> cutaway<00:00:49.500> around

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
stabilizer is literally cutaway around

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.310 
stabilizer is literally cutaway around
the<00:00:50.220> outside<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.820> design<00:00:51.120> and<00:00:51.360> left<00:00:51.750> to

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
the outside the design and left to

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.430 
the outside the design and left to
support<00:00:52.560> to<00:00:53.190> be<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.520> foundation<00:00:54.410> inside<00:00:55.410> a

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
support to be the foundation inside a

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.920 
support to be the foundation inside a
project<00:00:55.830> for<00:00:56.580> example<00:00:57.150> on<00:00:57.360> this<00:00:57.600> sweatshirt

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
project for example on this sweatshirt

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.880 
project for example on this sweatshirt
you<00:00:58.620> will<00:00:58.770> see<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.550> stabilizer<00:01:00.180> still<00:01:01.020> inside

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
you will see the stabilizer still inside

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.530 
you will see the stabilizer still inside
so<00:01:02.460> if<00:01:02.520> you've<00:01:02.670> ever<00:01:02.760> had<00:01:03.030> a<00:01:03.090> swatch<00:01:03.390> and

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:03.540 
so if you've ever had a swatch and

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:04.880 
so if you've ever had a swatch and
you're<00:01:03.690> like<00:01:03.840> gosh<00:01:04.019> why<00:01:04.259> did<00:01:04.439> they<00:01:04.559> leave<00:01:04.739> the

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
you're like gosh why did they leave the

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.940 
you're like gosh why did they leave the
stabilizer<00:01:05.400> in<00:01:05.609> there<00:01:05.789> it's<00:01:06.210> just<00:01:06.950> purport

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
stabilizer in there it's just purport

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.889 
stabilizer in there it's just purport
the<00:01:08.159> stitches<00:01:08.549> that<00:01:08.999> means<00:01:09.240> I<00:01:09.390> can<00:01:09.570> actually

00:01:09.889 --> 00:01:09.899 
the stitches that means I can actually

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:11.569 
the stitches that means I can actually
pull<00:01:10.200> on<00:01:10.380> these<00:01:10.560> stitches<00:01:10.770> and<00:01:11.100> they<00:01:11.280> don't

00:01:11.569 --> 00:01:11.579 
pull on these stitches and they don't

00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:14.690 
pull on these stitches and they don't
pop<00:01:11.999> if<00:01:12.329> I<00:01:12.780> had<00:01:13.020> tearaway<00:01:13.530> stabilizer<00:01:13.560> on<00:01:14.460> that

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
pop if I had tearaway stabilizer on that

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.510 
pop if I had tearaway stabilizer on that
and<00:01:14.939> I<00:01:15.659> pulled<00:01:15.960> those<00:01:16.380> stitches<00:01:16.679> we'll<00:01:17.310> all

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
and I pulled those stitches we'll all

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.899 
and I pulled those stitches we'll all
start<00:01:18.030> to<00:01:18.240> break<00:01:18.600> so<00:01:19.229> cutaway<00:01:20.130> stabilizer<00:01:20.159> on

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
start to break so cutaway stabilizer on

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
this has been washed a couple times so

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.330 
this has been washed a couple times so
we<00:01:56.700> really<00:01:57.060> see<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.420> results<00:01:57.749> a<00:01:58.020> good<00:01:58.649> quality

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
we really see the results a good quality

is<00:02:09.629> silk<00:02:10.049> so<00:02:10.530> we<00:02:10.679> just<00:02:10.860> went<00:02:11.009> ahead<00:02:11.129> and<00:02:11.310> used<00:02:11.610> a

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
is silk so we just went ahead and used a

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.490 
is silk so we just went ahead and used a
tearaway<00:02:12.420> stabilizer<00:02:12.590> so<00:02:13.590> if<00:02:13.860> your<00:02:14.069> fab

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
tearaway stabilizer so if your fab

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.770 
tearaway stabilizer so if your fab
is<00:02:14.680> a<00:02:14.710> woven<00:02:15.370> you<00:02:15.550> can<00:02:15.850> use<00:02:16.090> tearaway

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
is a woven you can use tearaway

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.200 
is a woven you can use tearaway
stabilizer<00:02:16.830> that<00:02:17.830> will<00:02:18.520> allow<00:02:18.670> you<00:02:18.730> to<00:02:18.850> tear

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:19.210 
stabilizer that will allow you to tear

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:21.570 
stabilizer that will allow you to tear
it<00:02:19.390> away<00:02:19.480> nicely<00:02:20.200> from<00:02:20.410> back<00:02:20.680> behind<00:02:20.920> it<00:02:21.370> and

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
it away nicely from back behind it and

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.150 
it away nicely from back behind it and
then<00:02:21.970> be<00:02:22.090> able<00:02:22.180> to<00:02:22.300> quilt<00:02:22.780> it<00:02:22.990> or<00:02:23.290> not<00:02:23.680> see<00:02:24.010> it

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
then be able to quilt it or not see it

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.500 
then be able to quilt it or not see it
if<00:02:24.280> it<00:02:24.400> is<00:02:24.550> going<00:02:24.670> to<00:02:24.760> be<00:02:24.880> seen<00:02:25.150> on<00:02:25.390> the

quilted<00:02:28.030> in<00:02:28.210> that<00:02:29.020> is<00:02:29.230> a<00:02:29.260> nice<00:02:29.680> stabilizer<00:02:30.250> but

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.520 
quilted in that is a nice stabilizer but

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.670 
quilted in that is a nice stabilizer but
remember<00:02:30.970> just<00:02:31.209> because<00:02:31.420> you<00:02:31.660> want<00:02:32.350> to<00:02:32.440> not

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
remember just because you want to not

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.320 
remember just because you want to not
see<00:02:32.709> it<00:02:33.100> doesn't<00:02:33.520> mean<00:02:33.640> you<00:02:33.760> want<00:02:33.940> to<00:02:34.060> change

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
see it doesn't mean you want to change

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
that is a terry cloth people always ask

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.260 
that is a terry cloth people always ask
well<00:02:41.380> is<00:02:41.500> that<00:02:41.680> a<00:02:41.709> woven<00:02:42.010> or<00:02:42.370> stretch<00:02:42.700> well

well is that a woven or stretch well

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:45.480 
well is that a woven or stretch well
technically<00:02:43.840> all<00:02:44.140> fabric<00:02:44.980> is<00:02:45.160> stretched

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:45.490 
technically all fabric is stretched

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:47.010 
technically all fabric is stretched
because<00:02:45.910> I<00:02:46.030> don't<00:02:46.150> know<00:02:46.209> about<00:02:46.300> you<00:02:46.570> but<00:02:46.600> last

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.020 
because I don't know about you but last

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:48.960 
because I don't know about you but last
time<00:02:47.200> I<00:02:47.260> tried<00:02:47.620> to<00:02:47.739> sew<00:02:47.920> on<00:02:48.070> the<00:02:48.100> diagonal<00:02:48.760> it

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
time I tried to sew on the diagonal it

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.330 
time I tried to sew on the diagonal it
was<00:02:49.510> a<00:02:49.540> little<00:02:49.959> wavy<00:02:50.230> because<00:02:50.739> it<00:02:50.920> stretches

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
was a little wavy because it stretches

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.810 
was a little wavy because it stretches
from<00:02:51.610> by<00:02:52.150> on<00:02:52.420> that<00:02:52.630> bias<00:02:53.080> edge<00:02:53.350> so<00:02:53.950> all<00:02:54.220> fabric

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:54.820 
from by on that bias edge so all fabric

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:56.460 
from by on that bias edge so all fabric
has<00:02:55.060> stretched<00:02:55.450> to<00:02:55.600> it<00:02:55.690> so<00:02:55.930> if<00:02:55.989> you're<00:02:56.080> going

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
has stretched to it so if you're going

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.979 
has stretched to it so if you're going
to<00:02:56.620> run<00:02:57.250> out<00:02:57.489> of<00:02:57.550> stabilizer<00:02:58.180> don't<00:02:58.810> run<00:02:58.959> out

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 
to run out of stabilizer don't run out

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:00.510 
to run out of stabilizer don't run out
of<00:02:59.170> the<00:02:59.350> cutaway<00:02:59.650> because<00:02:59.920> you<00:03:00.010> can<00:03:00.130> always

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:00.520 
of the cutaway because you can always

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.690 
of the cutaway because you can always
use<00:03:00.700> cutaway<00:03:01.180> stabilizer<00:03:01.209> on<00:03:02.140> the<00:03:02.709> back<00:03:02.950> of<00:03:03.190> a

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
use cutaway stabilizer on the back of a

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.930 
use cutaway stabilizer on the back of a
woven<00:03:04.630> fabric<00:03:04.709> but<00:03:05.709> you<00:03:06.280> know<00:03:06.340> it's<00:03:06.760> kind<00:03:06.910> of

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
woven fabric but you know it's kind of

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:08.729 
woven fabric but you know it's kind of
like<00:03:07.060> the<00:03:07.209> universal<00:03:07.750> stabilizer<00:03:08.140> maybe<00:03:08.530> not

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:08.739 
like the universal stabilizer maybe not

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:10.410 
like the universal stabilizer maybe not
the<00:03:08.860> best<00:03:09.100> one<00:03:09.400> for<00:03:09.700> the<00:03:09.760> final<00:03:10.090> result

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
the best one for the final result

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.300 
the best one for the final result
because<00:03:11.020> would<00:03:11.170> you<00:03:11.290> want<00:03:11.500> a<00:03:11.800> cutaway

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
because would you want a cutaway

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:13.890 
because would you want a cutaway
stabilizer<00:03:12.400> on<00:03:12.970> the<00:03:13.239> back<00:03:13.420> of<00:03:13.570> a<00:03:13.630> towel

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
stabilizer on the back of a towel

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.320 
stabilizer on the back of a towel
probably<00:03:14.709> not<00:03:14.980> you'll<00:03:15.550> probably<00:03:15.880> want<00:03:16.239> to<00:03:16.270> use

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.330 
probably not you'll probably want to use

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.960 
probably not you'll probably want to use
a<00:03:16.690> tearaway<00:03:17.380> stabilizer<00:03:17.430> you<00:03:18.430> want<00:03:18.580> to<00:03:18.640> remove

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
a tearaway stabilizer you want to remove

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.090 
a tearaway stabilizer you want to remove
it<00:03:19.209> so<00:03:19.360> nobody<00:03:19.720> sees<00:03:20.019> it<00:03:20.049> on<00:03:20.320> the<00:03:20.380> back<00:03:20.650> side

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100 
it so nobody sees it on the back side

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.370 
it so nobody sees it on the back side
now<00:03:21.700> there's<00:03:21.880> also<00:03:22.120> stabilizer<00:03:22.840> that<00:03:22.959> we<00:03:23.200> use

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
now there's also stabilizer that we use

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.460 
now there's also stabilizer that we use
on<00:03:23.620> the<00:03:23.799> top<00:03:24.120> for<00:03:25.120> fabrics<00:03:25.780> like<00:03:26.049> a<00:03:26.080> towel

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
on the top for fabrics like a towel

terry cloth fleece things with a nap

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.650 
terry cloth fleece things with a nap
because<00:03:29.950> if<00:03:30.100> you<00:03:30.220> don't<00:03:30.459> put<00:03:31.060> a<00:03:31.090> little<00:03:31.360> water

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 
because if you don't put a little water

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.590 
because if you don't put a little water
soluble<00:03:32.080> stabilizer<00:03:32.410> on<00:03:33.130> top<00:03:33.459> the<00:03:33.910> loops<00:03:34.150> come

soluble stabilizer on top the loops come

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.660 
soluble stabilizer on top the loops come
showing<00:03:35.320> through<00:03:35.530> your<00:03:35.590> stitches<00:03:36.160> and<00:03:36.340> that

showing through your stitches and that

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:38.729 
showing through your stitches and that
does<00:03:36.940> not<00:03:37.120> look<00:03:37.330> good<00:03:37.390> at<00:03:37.570> all<00:03:37.840> so<00:03:38.140> what<00:03:38.560> you

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:38.739 
does not look good at all so what you

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:40.620 
does not look good at all so what you
want<00:03:38.890> to<00:03:38.980> do<00:03:39.130> is<00:03:39.370> you'll<00:03:39.610> hoop<00:03:39.910> up<00:03:40.090> your<00:03:40.269> fabric

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:40.630 
want to do is you'll hoop up your fabric

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:43.710 
want to do is you'll hoop up your fabric
with<00:03:40.989> your<00:03:41.530> stabilizer<00:03:42.130> two<00:03:42.519> layers<00:03:42.820> and<00:03:43.239> then

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
with your stabilizer two layers and then

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.300 
with your stabilizer two layers and then
right<00:03:43.900> before<00:03:44.230> you<00:03:44.350> embroider<00:03:44.680> you<00:03:44.950> can<00:03:45.100> just

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
right before you embroider you can just

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.000 
right before you embroider you can just
put<00:03:45.610> a<00:03:45.790> small<00:03:46.510> piece<00:03:46.930> of<00:03:47.170> stabilizer<00:03:47.650> just

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
put a small piece of stabilizer just

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.610 
put a small piece of stabilizer just
over<00:03:48.400> the<00:03:48.549> area<00:03:49.060> right<00:03:49.750> on<00:03:49.930> top<00:03:50.140> of<00:03:50.290> the<00:03:50.380> fabric

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
over the area right on top of the fabric

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.979 
over the area right on top of the fabric
and<00:03:51.100> once<00:03:51.370> that<00:03:51.519> stitching<00:03:51.850> that<00:03:52.209> starts<00:03:52.690> it

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:52.989 
and once that stitching that starts it

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:54.630 
and once that stitching that starts it
will<00:03:53.140> kind<00:03:53.350> of<00:03:53.440> hold<00:03:53.709> it<00:03:53.860> in<00:03:53.980> place<00:03:54.340> now

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:54.640 
will kind of hold it in place now

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.370 
will kind of hold it in place now

to spray the secondary labor layer not
your<00:04:29.830> project<00:04:30.760> you<00:04:30.970> want<00:04:31.120> to<00:04:31.150> spray<00:04:31.390> the

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:31.540 
your project you want to spray the

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:33.810 
your project you want to spray the
stabilizer<00:04:32.080> and<00:04:32.440> then<00:04:32.770> that<00:04:33.070> stick<00:04:33.460> will<00:04:33.670> not

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:33.820 
stabilizer and then that stick will not

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:36.330 
stabilizer and then that stick will not
transfer<00:04:34.360> to<00:04:34.510> your<00:04:34.690> fabric<00:04:34.990> and<00:04:35.410> that<00:04:35.860> is<00:04:36.100> of

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:36.340 
transfer to your fabric and that is of

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.850 
transfer to your fabric and that is of
course<00:04:36.550> what<00:04:36.760> you<00:04:36.910> want<00:04:37.120> but<00:04:37.810> also<00:04:38.050> just<00:04:38.500> it's

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 
course what you want but also just it's

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:40.380 
course what you want but also just it's
just<00:04:38.950> temporary<00:04:39.490> so<00:04:39.700> once<00:04:39.850> you<00:04:39.940> start<00:04:40.000> to<00:04:40.180> wash

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:40.390 
just temporary so once you start to wash

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:42.660 
just temporary so once you start to wash
it<00:04:40.630> it<00:04:40.750> goes<00:04:40.900> away<00:04:40.930> even<00:04:41.830> in<00:04:41.980> the<00:04:42.100> air<00:04:42.280> it<00:04:42.550> will

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:42.670 
it it goes away even in the air it will

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:44.850 
it it goes away even in the air it will
dissipate<00:04:43.240> and<00:04:43.540> completely<00:04:44.260> come<00:04:44.560> off<00:04:44.710> your

spraying and spraying you might get to

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.810 
spraying and spraying you might get to
gummy<00:04:50.470> and<00:04:50.560> it<00:04:50.680> might<00:04:50.860> take<00:04:51.100> more<00:04:51.370> to<00:04:51.580> get<00:04:51.760> it

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:36.790 
apples fresh from the orchard but this

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:38.220 
apples fresh from the orchard but this
would<00:05:37.000> be<00:05:37.030> something<00:05:37.270> where<00:05:37.540> I<00:05:37.600> would<00:05:37.960> use<00:05:37.990> a

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:38.230 
would be something where I would use a

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:40.410 
would be something where I would use a
water<00:05:38.590> soluble<00:05:38.890> stabilizer<00:05:39.280> on<00:05:39.940> the<00:05:40.240> back

water soluble stabilizer on the back

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:42.000 
water soluble stabilizer on the back
then<00:05:40.870> I<00:05:40.960> don't<00:05:41.170> have<00:05:41.260> to<00:05:41.320> pick<00:05:41.590> out<00:05:41.770> that

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:42.010 
then I don't have to pick out that

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:43.800 
then I don't have to pick out that
tearaway<00:05:42.340> stabilizer<00:05:42.460> from<00:05:43.300> every<00:05:43.630> little

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:43.810 
tearaway stabilizer from every little

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:46.110 
tearaway stabilizer from every little
letter<00:05:44.200> in<00:05:44.470> there<00:05:44.680> and<00:05:44.920> it<00:05:45.250> really<00:05:45.610> makes<00:05:45.940> a

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:46.120 
letter in there and it really makes a

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.120 
letter in there and it really makes a
difference<00:05:46.180> so<00:05:47.050> that's<00:05:47.350> one<00:05:47.650> place<00:05:47.830> I

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:48.130 
difference so that's one place I

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:49.770 
difference so that's one place I
sometimes<00:05:48.640> will<00:05:49.000> use<00:05:49.180> water<00:05:49.510> soluble

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:49.780 
sometimes will use water soluble

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:51.810 
sometimes will use water soluble
stabilizer<00:05:50.110> on<00:05:50.770> the<00:05:50.890> top<00:05:51.130> of<00:05:51.370> something<00:05:51.610> that

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:51.820 
stabilizer on the top of something that

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:53.190 
stabilizer on the top of something that
probably<00:05:52.180> doesn't<00:05:52.510> need<00:05:52.840> it

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:53.200 
probably doesn't need it

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:55.200 
probably doesn't need it
because<00:05:53.890> it<00:05:54.130> actually<00:05:54.370> helps<00:05:54.820> keep<00:05:55.030> your

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:55.210 
because it actually helps keep your

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:57.890 
because it actually helps keep your
stitches<00:05:55.780> a<00:05:55.900> little<00:05:56.320> bit<00:05:56.470> more<00:05:56.710> raised<00:05:57.070> and

00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:57.900 
stitches a little bit more raised and

00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:59.880 
stitches a little bit more raised and
professional-looking<00:05:58.900> so<00:05:59.560> if<00:05:59.620> you<00:05:59.740> really

00:05:59.880 --> 00:05:59.890 
professional-looking so if you really

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:01.860 
professional-looking so if you really
want<00:06:00.190> to<00:06:00.280> look<00:06:00.460> good<00:06:00.640> you<00:06:00.940> can<00:06:01.480> add<00:06:01.660> that

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:01.870 
want to look good you can add that

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:04.200 
want to look good you can add that
little<00:06:02.080> extra<00:06:02.380> layer<00:06:02.590> on<00:06:02.710> top<00:06:03.210> everything

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:04.210 
little extra layer on top everything

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:06.030 
little extra layer on top everything
washes<00:06:04.570> away<00:06:04.690> when<00:06:04.990> it's<00:06:05.170> done<00:06:05.380> but<00:06:05.860> those

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:06.040 
washes away when it's done but those

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:08.400 
washes away when it's done but those
stitches<00:06:06.340> really<00:06:06.850> show<00:06:07.300> up<00:06:07.510> a<00:06:07.690> little<00:06:08.170> bit

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:08.410 
stitches really show up a little bit

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:10.470 
stitches really show up a little bit
taller<00:06:08.650> and<00:06:08.860> a<00:06:09.070> little<00:06:09.370> bit<00:06:09.520> fuller<00:06:09.820> when

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:10.480

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:02.810 
will actually stitched the design out
because<00:07:01.770> by<00:07:01.950> the<00:07:02.010> time<00:07:02.280> you<00:07:02.370> get<00:07:02.490> it<00:07:02.610> hooked

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:02.820 
because by the time you get it hooked

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:04.730 
because by the time you get it hooked
and<00:07:03.090> on<00:07:03.180> the<00:07:03.300> machine<00:07:03.600> and<00:07:03.900> fabric<00:07:04.560> moved

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:04.740 
and on the machine and fabric moved

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:08.300 
and on the machine and fabric moved
around<00:07:05.130> and<00:07:05.460> that<00:07:06.770> designs<00:07:07.770> stitches<00:07:08.220> out

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:08.310 
around and that designs stitches out

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:10.040 
around and that designs stitches out
super<00:07:08.729> quick<00:07:08.970> so<00:07:09.330> that's<00:07:09.540> just<00:07:09.690> kind<00:07:09.900> of<00:07:09.930> a

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:10.050 
super quick so that's just kind of a

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:11.990 
super quick so that's just kind of a
quick<00:07:10.229> rundown<00:07:10.590> with<00:07:10.950> stabilizer<00:07:11.520> you<00:07:11.790> heard

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:12.000 
quick rundown with stabilizer you heard

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.790 
quick rundown with stabilizer you heard
me<00:07:12.150> talk<00:07:12.330> about<00:07:12.360> hooping<00:07:13.110> the<00:07:13.260> stabilizer

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:13.800 
me talk about hooping the stabilizer

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:15.680 
me talk about hooping the stabilizer
with<00:07:14.250> your<00:07:14.520> fabric<00:07:14.760> you're<00:07:15.360> going<00:07:15.479> to<00:07:15.540> have<00:07:15.660> a

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:15.690 
with your fabric you're going to have a

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:18.379 
with your fabric you're going to have a
much<00:07:15.900> better<00:07:16.229> success<00:07:16.680> if<00:07:17.310> you<00:07:17.460> do<00:07:17.669> that<00:07:17.880> so

00:07:18.379 --> 00:07:18.389 
much better success if you do that so

00:07:18.389 --> 00:07:20.870 
much better success if you do that so
when<00:07:18.960> all<00:07:19.200> the<00:07:19.350> fabric<00:07:19.740> stabilizer<00:07:19.950> is<00:07:20.580> all

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:20.880 
when all the fabric stabilizer is all

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:22.460 
when all the fabric stabilizer is all
together<00:07:21.180> in<00:07:21.540> the<00:07:21.630> hoop<00:07:21.810> now<00:07:22.050> there's<00:07:22.229> times

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:22.470 
together in the hoop now there's times

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:24.200 
together in the hoop now there's times
where<00:07:22.650> you<00:07:22.680> can't<00:07:22.979> hoop<00:07:23.220> something<00:07:23.669> so<00:07:24.120> you

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:24.210 
where you can't hoop something so you

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:26.810 
where you can't hoop something so you
can<00:07:24.300> use<00:07:24.450> the<00:07:24.630> stabilizer<00:07:24.870> and<00:07:25.590> just<00:07:26.490> hook<00:07:26.669> the

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:26.820 
can use the stabilizer and just hook the

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:28.280 
can use the stabilizer and just hook the
stabilizer<00:07:27.240> you<00:07:27.419> can<00:07:27.570> use<00:07:27.690> some<00:07:27.870> temporaries

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:28.290 
stabilizer you can use some temporaries

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:29.870 
stabilizer you can use some temporaries
for<00:07:28.530> adhesive<00:07:29.040> spray<00:07:29.220> the<00:07:29.460> middle<00:07:29.760> of<00:07:29.820> the

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:29.880 
for adhesive spray the middle of the

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:31.730 
for adhesive spray the middle of the
hoop<00:07:30.030> and<00:07:30.210> stick<00:07:30.720> it<00:07:30.870> down<00:07:30.900> some<00:07:31.530> of<00:07:31.560> the

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:31.740 
hoop and stick it down some of the

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:33.379 
hoop and stick it down some of the
stabilizers<00:07:32.400> are<00:07:32.550> actually<00:07:32.940> a<00:07:32.970> sticky

00:07:33.379 --> 00:07:33.389 
stabilizers are actually a sticky

00:07:33.389 --> 00:07:35.090 
stabilizers are actually a sticky
stabilizer<00:07:34.169> where<00:07:34.500> they<00:07:34.590> actually<00:07:34.770> have<00:07:35.070> a

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:35.100 
stabilizer where they actually have a

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:37.640 
stabilizer where they actually have a
peel<00:07:35.820> away<00:07:36.030> and<00:07:36.210> you<00:07:36.660> stick<00:07:37.110> your<00:07:37.260> projects

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:37.650 
peel away and you stick your projects

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:39.590 
peel away and you stick your projects
down<00:07:37.800> and<00:07:38.070> it<00:07:38.310> doesn't<00:07:38.789> go<00:07:38.910> anywhere<00:07:39.300> while

00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:39.600 
down and it doesn't go anywhere while

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:40.940 
down and it doesn't go anywhere while
it's<00:07:39.840> embroidering<00:07:40.350> it's<00:07:40.620> usually<00:07:40.740> a

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:40.950 
it's embroidering it's usually a

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:42.830 
it's embroidering it's usually a
tearaway<00:07:41.550> and<00:07:41.820> then<00:07:42.090> you<00:07:42.180> tear<00:07:42.390> that<00:07:42.510> all<00:07:42.690> away

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:42.840 
tearaway and then you tear that all away

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:44.779 
tearaway and then you tear that all away
from<00:07:43.260> your<00:07:43.410> project<00:07:43.620> and<00:07:43.979> really<00:07:44.370> hold<00:07:44.610> it

00:07:44.779 --> 00:07:44.789 
from your project and really hold it

00:07:44.789 --> 00:07:47.659 
from your project and really hold it
very<00:07:45.419> nice<00:07:45.720> also<00:07:46.470> stabilizers<00:07:47.310> come<00:07:47.520> in

00:07:47.659 --> 00:07:47.669 
very nice also stabilizers come in

00:07:47.669 --> 00:07:49.760 
very nice also stabilizers come in
usually<00:07:47.820> a<00:07:48.030> couple<00:07:48.330> different<00:07:48.630> sizes<00:07:49.110> so<00:07:49.530> if

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:49.770 
usually a couple different sizes so if

00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:52.070 
usually a couple different sizes so if
you're<00:07:49.919> working<00:07:50.130> with<00:07:50.310> your<00:07:51.060> smaller<00:07:51.750> hoop

00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:52.080 
you're working with your smaller hoop

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:54.440 
you're working with your smaller hoop
for<00:07:52.350> a<00:07:52.410> project<00:07:52.620> why<00:07:53.490> waste<00:07:53.850> the<00:07:54.060> extra

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:54.450 
for a project why waste the extra

00:07:54.450 --> 00:07:57.440 
for a project why waste the extra
stabilizer<00:07:54.960> from<00:07:55.860> a<00:07:56.160> taller<00:07:56.400> roll<00:07:56.729> spend<00:07:57.360> the

00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:57.450 
stabilizer from a taller roll spend the

00:07:57.450 --> 00:08:00.140 
stabilizer from a taller roll spend the
extra<00:07:57.570> money<00:07:57.810> get<00:07:58.410> a<00:07:58.440> small<00:07:58.800> roll<00:07:59.310> you'll<00:07:59.910> use

00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:00.150 
extra money get a small roll you'll use

00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:02.750 
extra money get a small roll you'll use
it<00:08:00.419> up<00:08:00.570> and<00:08:00.780> then<00:08:01.350> that<00:08:01.560> way<00:08:01.800> it's<00:08:02.100> just<00:08:02.460> right

00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:02.760 
it up and then that way it's just right

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:04.730 
it up and then that way it's just right
for<00:08:02.970> the<00:08:03.660> hoops<00:08:03.870> that<00:08:04.020> you're<00:08:04.289> working<00:08:04.470> with

00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:04.740 
for the hoops that you're working with

00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:06.710 
for the hoops that you're working with
alright<00:08:05.729> we're<00:08:05.940> going<00:08:06.060> to<00:08:06.180> get<00:08:06.270> into<00:08:06.479> a<00:08:06.539> little

00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:06.720 
alright we're going to get into a little

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:09.350 
alright we're going to get into a little
bit<00:08:06.990> more<00:08:07.020> detail<00:08:07.770> on<00:08:07.950> hooping<00:08:08.580> and<00:08:08.700> take<00:08:09.330> a

00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:09.360 
bit more detail on hooping and take a

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:11.150 
bit more detail on hooping and take a
look<00:08:09.600> at<00:08:09.720> all<00:08:09.930> the<00:08:10.050> other<00:08:10.169> videos<00:08:10.650> that<00:08:10.950> we've

00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:11.160 
look at all the other videos that we've

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:14.510 
look at all the other videos that we've
been<00:08:11.310> doing<00:08:11.760> for<00:08:11.910> this<00:08:12.270> machine
