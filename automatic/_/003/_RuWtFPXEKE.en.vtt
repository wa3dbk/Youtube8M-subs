00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.870
 so much good in general 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:09.269
 but as I was saying, we did not stop 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:12.030
 be the same ones that have nothing good basis 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:15.750
 good habits that we all know and there 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.130
 we are making small adjustments but in 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.980
 general terms I think we're doing well 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.330
 because we arrived 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:30.170
 fairly good 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:30.170
 to date one does not reach 100% 

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:43.260
 america you would like a face of that 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.940
 way a football of that style to 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.430
 to be able to put it, we do not have to go to 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.470
 step never first created us to be 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:53.610
 solids and gaining a structure to have 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:57.380
 a line of play and then next 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:59.610
 being offensive having a need 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:01.790
 offensive in general terms all 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:03.930
 technicians we want we look for a balance 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:08.370
 then if we find out for you 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:11.390
 trying to be more offensive in agreement 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:11.390
 to the quality 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:26.670
 what I have seen for a long time 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.710
 has played this guy I adapt to 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.600
 make everyone 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.850
 in your best position to look for the 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:36.720
 scheme that is best for you 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:39.030
 to the players that we have and then little 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.040
 little by little each technician wants to print his 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.610
 seal to the whole team but respecting 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:47.070
 a base respecting a form of play and 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.870
 no sudden changes 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.090
 if we were in the summer with more 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:54.380
 Our preparation time and 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.380
 we cover next Saturday 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:01.860
 with lobster mobiles 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:01.860
 they do not necessarily adapt 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:06.660
 they are gaining a position like all 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:10.110
 and let's go 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:18.239
 how do you want to tell me the other 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:20.909
 but there are some doubts there is a good 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:22.739
 base, I insist that the team of the 

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:26.330
 previous tournament and then there will be 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:26.330
 make good use of this week to do 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:32.280
 one of the adjustments is not there either 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:34.190
 there is a base we reviewed the adaptation of 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.860
 the memories 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:40.120
 However, the group general has 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:44.909
 received very well 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:49.750
 They are players who were here pinto 

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:52.000
 they are alive and frame they know what 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:55.299
 is what all this is and all three 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:59.409
 players that come from the bml will be a 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:03:01.940
 little slower because we are going 

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:05.770
 physically well 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.770
 tropea is a terrorist of the 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:12.910
 d 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:16.860
 Allison kind easy or inside a 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.860
 request for the title 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:29.020
 we have a strong staff that we can 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:32.860
 fight with any team in any 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:37.020
 court then that's what what 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:37.020
 let's do and we have clear 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:47.480
 or water we are very conscious 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:51.730
 of what this team is and very 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.730
 aware of the strength they have 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:59.810
 deliver complemente we will be 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:02.860
 professionals do with these will leave 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.860
 always everything in every workout 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:15.810
 I think we're leaving the team is 

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:18.690
 well let's get shared is very 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:20.250
 strong with monterrey in his house but the 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.040
 team will force very well that we do not have 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:24.840
 you doubt because we have just seen it 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:27.140
 long ago that the team and a good 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.140
 structure 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:37.710
 submit 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:45.270
 there are people 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.530
 address 

00:04:51.659 --> 00:05:02.490
 I think it's going to be the tournament 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:02.490
 it's always a very even level 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:12.400
 I think there is a greater expectation in 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:14.229
 all senses if we are going to see a 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.800
 great tournament because there are also many 

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:16.800
 very strong teams 

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:24.770
 Thank you 

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:24.770
 and now I'm not going to tell you now 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:33.020
 and this rehabilitation continues and 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:35.880
 at the same time doing a physical job 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:38.180
 because he missed many days 

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:41.330
 of work 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:45.720
 but still with the muscular discomfort that 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:47.790
 I had and I hope that already 

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:50.190
 next week you can do a job 

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:53.130
 strongest to the best red of the group is 

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:54.780
 because he has to work with axel a 

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:57.830
 time to physically reach the team 

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:57.830
 how many changes 

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:04.250
 to search is we wanted 

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:08.400
 do not 

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:14.450
 today we are mediating the course 

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:14.450
 classic we will see
