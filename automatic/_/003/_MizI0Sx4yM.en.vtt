little<00:00:52.770> purple<00:00:53.190> dots<00:00:53.550> that<00:00:53.789> you<00:00:53.850> see<00:00:54.149> back

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
little purple dots that you see back

little purple dots that you see back
there<00:00:54.600> it's<00:00:54.719> sort<00:00:55.199> of<00:00:55.230> hard<00:00:55.350> to<00:00:55.500> see<00:00:55.680> at<00:00:55.800> that

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
there it's sort of hard to see at that

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.220 
there it's sort of hard to see at that
angle<00:00:56.160> but<00:00:56.460> and<00:00:57.180> those<00:00:57.329> are<00:00:57.570> basically<00:00:57.960> used

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
angle but and those are basically used

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.950 
angle but and those are basically used
as<00:00:58.379> bearings<00:00:58.920> and<00:00:59.579> then<00:00:59.699> you<00:00:59.850> got<00:01:00.000> your<00:01:00.629> thing

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
as bearings and then you got your thing

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.599 
as bearings and then you got your thing
that<00:01:01.170> moves<00:01:01.739> back<00:01:01.949> and<00:01:02.190> forth<00:01:02.399> with<00:01:02.579> a

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
that moves back and forth with a

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.100 
that moves back and forth with a
movement<00:01:02.879> of<00:01:03.000> your<00:01:03.120> body<00:01:03.300> and<00:01:03.570> it<00:01:03.660> wines<00:01:03.870> it

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
movement of your body and it wines it

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.080 
movement of your body and it wines it
mints<00:01:04.290> it's<00:01:04.830> a<00:01:04.920> really<00:01:05.129> cool<00:01:05.309> mechanism<00:01:06.000> the

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
mints it's a really cool mechanism the

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.630 
mints it's a really cool mechanism the
only<00:01:06.360> downfall<00:01:06.600> to<00:01:07.110> it<00:01:07.200> is<00:01:07.320> is<00:01:07.590> it'll<00:01:07.830> run<00:01:08.610> out

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
only downfall to it is is it'll run out

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.030 
only downfall to it is is it'll run out
of<00:01:08.760> juice<00:01:09.090> and<00:01:09.270> about<00:01:09.510> a<00:01:09.750> 2<00:01:10.229> to<00:01:10.350> 3<00:01:10.380> days<00:01:10.799> if

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
of juice and about a 2 to 3 days if

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.280 
of juice and about a 2 to 3 days if
you're<00:01:11.130> not<00:01:11.220> wearing<00:01:11.729> it<00:01:11.850> so<00:01:12.119> it's<00:01:12.960> definitely

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
you're not wearing it so it's definitely

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.170 
you're not wearing it so it's definitely
something<00:01:13.500> you<00:01:13.680> either<00:01:14.040> have<00:01:14.310> to<00:01:14.369> set<00:01:14.760> quite

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
something you either have to set quite

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.609 
something you either have to set quite
often<00:01:15.390> or<00:01:15.689> you<00:01:15.720> need<00:01:15.869> to<00:01:15.900> wear<00:01:16.140> it<00:01:16.229> frequently

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
often or you need to wear it frequently

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.480 
often or you need to wear it frequently
um<00:01:16.970> so<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.780> glass<00:01:19.020> is<00:01:19.259> a<00:01:19.290> mineral<00:01:19.710> crystal

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
um so the glass is a mineral crystal

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.780 
um so the glass is a mineral crystal
glass<00:01:20.810> the<00:01:21.810> case<00:01:22.140> diameter<00:01:22.590> is<00:01:22.920> 40<00:01:23.430> and<00:01:23.460> a<00:01:23.580> half

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
glass the case diameter is 40 and a half

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.910 
glass the case diameter is 40 and a half
millimeters<00:01:24.479> that's<00:01:24.659> to<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.020> outside<00:01:25.560> of

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
millimeters that's to the outside of

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.310 
millimeters that's to the outside of
this<00:01:26.250> -<00:01:26.939> that<00:01:27.119> right<00:01:27.360> there<00:01:27.390> a<00:01:27.840> lot<00:01:28.110> of<00:01:28.140> people

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
this - that right there a lot of people

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.289 
this - that right there a lot of people
get<00:01:28.590> that<00:01:28.619> confused<00:01:28.799> and<00:01:29.460> think<00:01:29.670> it's<00:01:29.850> you

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
get that confused and think it's you

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.969 
get that confused and think it's you
know<00:01:30.329> here<00:01:30.659> to<00:01:30.780> here<00:01:30.990> so<00:01:31.259> it's<00:01:31.470> actually<00:01:31.799> from

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
know here to here so it's actually from

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.440 
know here to here so it's actually from
there<00:01:32.189> they're<00:01:32.400> at<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.610> widest<00:01:32.970> point<00:01:33.180> I

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
there they're at the widest point I

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.630 
there they're at the widest point I
believe<00:01:34.380> that<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.740> width<00:01:34.920> of<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.130> band<00:01:35.369> on

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
believe that the width of the band on

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.190 
believe that the width of the band on
this<00:01:35.790> one<00:01:36.000> is<00:01:36.119> 22<00:01:37.070> yet<00:01:38.070> 22<00:01:38.549> millimeters<00:01:39.200> and

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
this one is 22 yet 22 millimeters and

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.080 
this one is 22 yet 22 millimeters and
then<00:01:40.320> like<00:01:40.860> I<00:01:40.890> said<00:01:40.979> this<00:01:41.250> is<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:41.520> shiny<00:01:41.820> the

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
then like I said this is the shiny the

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.929 
then like I said this is the shiny the
pilot<00:01:42.540> polished<00:01:42.990> stainless<00:01:43.610> it's<00:01:44.610> held<00:01:44.820> up

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
pilot polished stainless it's held up

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.120 
pilot polished stainless it's held up
really<00:01:45.149> well<00:01:45.299> a<00:01:45.479> very<00:01:45.960> very<00:01:46.259> few<00:01:46.470> scratches<00:01:46.799> on

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
really well a very very few scratches on

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.800 
really well a very very few scratches on
it<00:01:47.310> I<00:01:47.369> wear<00:01:47.549> it<00:01:47.640> quite<00:01:47.820> frequently<00:01:48.329> like<00:01:48.750> I

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
it I wear it quite frequently like I

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.120 
it I wear it quite frequently like I
said<00:01:48.990> it's<00:01:49.110> been<00:01:49.170> roughly<00:01:49.530> a<00:01:49.619> year<00:01:49.710> and<00:01:49.950> a<00:01:49.979> half

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
said it's been roughly a year and a half

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.609 
said it's been roughly a year and a half
maybe<00:01:50.310> maybe<00:01:50.759> closer<00:01:51.030> to<00:01:51.149> two<00:01:51.390> years<00:01:51.659> now<00:01:51.869> so

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
maybe maybe closer to two years now so

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:53.870 
maybe maybe closer to two years now so
it's<00:01:52.649> been<00:01:52.860> a<00:01:52.890> real<00:01:53.040> good<00:01:53.189> watch<00:01:53.340> it's<00:01:53.579> a<00:01:53.640> very

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
it's been a real good watch it's a very

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.749 
it's been a real good watch it's a very
heavy<00:01:54.119> watch<00:01:55.100> this<00:01:56.100> has<00:01:56.310> a<00:01:56.340> lot<00:01:56.520> of<00:01:56.549> weight

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
heavy watch this has a lot of weight

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.130 
heavy watch this has a lot of weight
because<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.119> automatic<00:01:57.270> movement<00:01:57.990> and<00:01:58.079> all

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
because the automatic movement and all

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.510 
because the automatic movement and all
the<00:01:58.259> parts<00:01:58.560> of<00:01:58.680> it<00:01:58.770> and<00:01:58.860> then<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.040> band<00:01:59.280> is

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
the parts of it and then the band is

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.819 
the parts of it and then the band is
solid<00:01:59.969> it's<00:02:00.090> not<00:02:00.240> a<00:02:00.270> hollow<00:02:00.540> band<00:02:00.930> so<00:02:01.560> if

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
solid it's not a hollow band so if

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.319 
solid it's not a hollow band so if
you're<00:02:02.009> a<00:02:02.040> fan<00:02:02.219> of<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.490> heavier<00:02:02.790> watches

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
you're a fan of the heavier watches

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:04.580 
you're a fan of the heavier watches
you'll<00:02:03.479> really<00:02:03.750> like<00:02:03.960> this<00:02:04.170> because<00:02:04.380> it<00:02:04.469> does

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
you'll really like this because it does

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:05.090 
you'll really like this because it does
have

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
have

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.859 
have
it<00:02:05.220> also<00:02:05.460> substantial<00:02:06.360> weight<00:02:06.510> to<00:02:06.540> what<00:02:06.810> I

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
it also substantial weight to what I

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.169 
it also substantial weight to what I
think<00:02:07.080> it<00:02:07.170> comes<00:02:07.350> in<00:02:07.560> right<00:02:07.680> about<00:02:08.000> 16<00:02:09.000> ounces

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
think it comes in right about 16 ounces

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.500 
think it comes in right about 16 ounces
to<00:02:09.600> be<00:02:09.720> exact<00:02:10.110> so<00:02:10.459> it<00:02:11.459> is<00:02:11.580> water-resistant<00:02:12.420> up

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
to be exact so it is water-resistant up

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.400 
to be exact so it is water-resistant up
to<00:02:12.810> 99<00:02:13.680> feet<00:02:13.980> they<00:02:14.220> say<00:02:14.489> so<00:02:15.050> I've<00:02:16.050> had<00:02:16.230> it<00:02:16.380> in

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
to 99 feet they say so I've had it in

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.380 
to 99 feet they say so I've had it in
water<00:02:16.680> never<00:02:17.280> never<00:02:17.700> went<00:02:17.880> to<00:02:17.940> pool<00:02:18.209> or

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
water never never went to pool or

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:19.490 
water never never went to pool or
anything<00:02:18.569> with<00:02:18.840> it<00:02:19.020> but<00:02:19.110> I've<00:02:19.260> you<00:02:19.470> know

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
anything with it but I've you know

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.370 
anything with it but I've you know
rinsed<00:02:19.980> off<00:02:20.130> and<00:02:20.540> got<00:02:21.540> it<00:02:21.660> wet<00:02:21.810> being<00:02:22.050> outside

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
rinsed off and got it wet being outside

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:23.900 
rinsed off and got it wet being outside
and<00:02:22.590> stuff<00:02:22.739> never<00:02:22.980> had<00:02:23.190> any<00:02:23.340> problems<00:02:23.670> with<00:02:23.730> it

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
and stuff never had any problems with it

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.350 
and stuff never had any problems with it
as<00:02:24.000> far<00:02:24.180> as<00:02:24.300> that<00:02:24.450> goes<00:02:24.510> so<00:02:25.050> um<00:02:26.030> like<00:02:27.030> I<00:02:27.120> said<00:02:27.270> it

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
as far as that goes so um like I said it

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:28.670 
as far as that goes so um like I said it
does<00:02:27.480> have<00:02:27.600> the<00:02:27.690> automatic<00:02:28.140> movement<00:02:28.470> or<00:02:28.560> you

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
does have the automatic movement or you

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.670 
does have the automatic movement or you
wind<00:02:29.010> it<00:02:29.190> and<00:02:29.430> by<00:02:29.850> winding<00:02:30.150> it<00:02:30.390> you<00:02:31.200> pull<00:02:31.530> this

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
wind it and by winding it you pull this

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.979 
wind it and by winding it you pull this
pull<00:02:32.670> your<00:02:32.850> thing<00:02:33.030> out<00:02:33.150> right<00:02:33.390> there<00:02:33.600> and<00:02:33.780> you

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
pull your thing out right there and you

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:38.509 
pull your thing out right there and you
just<00:02:34.020> don't<00:02:37.010> actually<00:02:38.010> I'm<00:02:38.069> sorry<00:02:38.280> you<00:02:38.370> don't

keep spinning it until it starts to get

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:44.509 
keep spinning it until it starts to get
tight<00:02:43.319> and<00:02:43.350> that'll<00:02:43.769> that'll<00:02:43.980> keep<00:02:44.220> you<00:02:44.370> home
