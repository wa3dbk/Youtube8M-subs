00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:12.170
 a winter the beach may seem to 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:15.480
 simple view a light story 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:16.740
 simple a quiet comedy but a 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.360
 As you watch the movie, you hit 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.790
 account that it encloses a world of 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:23.040
 contradictions speaks very well of two 

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:26.279
 young people who see with their father my father 

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:29.090
 he wants writers to become and she 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:32.150
 he starts to outdo his father and he 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:34.570
 forced by his father wants to know 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.570
 the life 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.450
 Well, I think spices write for 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:46.910
 the same reason why I started reading 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:49.910
 because one day I realized that I wanted to 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:51.590
 other pounds than those that do not 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.310
 could access but lava by 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.680
 imagination 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:57.890
 and so I think that writing at the end 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:01.160
 it is a complement to reading 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:04.270
 and I think that's what writing is about 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.270
 listen to our heart 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:09.860
 to think 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:23.470
 Y 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:28.690
 one 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:34.780
 actually hiding the tears 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.930
 hopefully 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.930
 it's over 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.930
 look 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:48.570
 the first time I felt the need to 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:52.340
 writing was at 9 I was 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.340
 in love with my class 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:55.940
 I could not think of a better way to 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:58.100
 declare me that 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:01.100
 I will write a poem so that for me 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:04.300
 at the end writing is like a 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.300
 declaration of love 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.720
 towards life towards people 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:13.970
 and that is being renewed 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.970
 and every time I write a new
