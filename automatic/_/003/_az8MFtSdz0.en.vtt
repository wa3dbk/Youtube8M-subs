I'll show you later on tonight when it
gets<00:01:35.410> dark<00:01:35.740> but<00:01:36.069> the<00:01:36.220> back<00:01:36.490> light<00:01:36.819> comes<00:01:37.750> on

00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:37.899 
gets dark but the back light comes on

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:40.440 
gets dark but the back light comes on
for<00:01:38.229> about<00:01:38.319> ten<00:01:38.800> seconds<00:01:39.340> and<00:01:39.550> then<00:01:39.729> turns<00:01:40.149> off

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
for about ten seconds and then turns off

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:42.840 
for about ten seconds and then turns off
so<00:01:41.259> every<00:01:41.440> time<00:01:41.590> you<00:01:41.770> push<00:01:42.009> this<00:01:42.190> button<00:01:42.250> it's

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:42.850 
so every time you push this button it's

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:44.520 
so every time you push this button it's
just<00:01:43.030> going<00:01:43.149> to<00:01:43.240> turn<00:01:43.479> it<00:01:43.539> right<00:01:43.690> back<00:01:43.869> on<00:01:44.050> and

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 
just going to turn it right back on and

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.190 
just going to turn it right back on and
then<00:01:45.069> the<00:01:45.250> actual<00:01:45.369> display<00:01:46.209> automatically

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 
then the actual display automatically

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.080 
then the actual display automatically
turns<00:01:47.500> off<00:01:47.740> in<00:01:47.979> ten<00:01:48.340> minutes

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
turns off in ten minutes

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.410 
turns off in ten minutes
so<00:01:49.720> they<00:01:50.470> claim<00:01:50.770> here<00:01:51.130> that<00:01:51.160> the<00:01:51.880> battery<00:01:52.270> is

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
so they claim here that the battery is

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.779 
so they claim here that the battery is
going<00:01:52.479> to<00:01:52.660> last<00:01:52.899> you<00:01:53.200> up<00:01:53.410> to<00:01:53.920> five<00:01:54.220> thousand

00:01:54.779 --> 00:01:54.789 
going to last you up to five thousand

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:56.790 
going to last you up to five thousand
hours<00:01:54.970> so<00:01:55.869> that's<00:01:55.990> obviously<00:01:56.229> going<00:01:56.649> to<00:01:56.709> be

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:56.800 
hours so that's obviously going to be

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.590 
hours so that's obviously going to be
dependent<00:01:57.490> on<00:01:57.580> how<00:01:57.850> much<00:01:58.030> you're<00:01:58.209> using<00:01:58.240> the

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
dependent on how much you're using the

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.020 
dependent on how much you're using the
back<00:01:58.780> light<00:01:59.069> so<00:02:00.069> then<00:02:00.310> on<00:02:00.429> the<00:02:00.550> back<00:02:00.729> you've

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
back light so then on the back you've

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.020 
back light so then on the back you've
got<00:02:01.060> a<00:02:01.509> little<00:02:02.289> button<00:02:02.500> here<00:02:02.649> that<00:02:03.009> allows<00:02:03.850> you

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
got a little button here that allows you

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.570 
got a little button here that allows you
to<00:02:04.119> switch<00:02:04.360> from<00:02:04.690> Celsius<00:02:05.590> to<00:02:05.770> Fahrenheit<00:02:05.800> and

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:06.580 
to switch from Celsius to Fahrenheit and

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.210 
to switch from Celsius to Fahrenheit and

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
display is rotating 90 degrees every

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.059 
display is rotating 90 degrees every
time<00:02:20.650> I<00:02:20.819> push<00:02:21.819> that<00:02:22.060> rotate<00:02:22.599> button<00:02:22.959> so<00:02:23.890> what

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 
time I push that rotate button so what

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:27.839 
time I push that rotate button so what
that<00:02:24.220> lets<00:02:24.400> you<00:02:24.550> do<00:02:24.760> is<00:02:25.890> depending<00:02:26.890> on<00:02:27.130> you

here<00:03:24.280> that<00:03:24.459> have<00:03:24.579> been<00:03:24.730> cooking<00:03:24.940> overnight

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
here that have been cooking overnight

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:27.170 
here that have been cooking overnight
they're<00:03:25.690> getting<00:03:25.930> close<00:03:26.230> to<00:03:26.410> being<00:03:26.440> done<00:03:26.769> and

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
they're getting close to being done and

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.979 
they're getting close to being done and
just<00:03:28.180> put<00:03:28.660> the<00:03:28.750> thermal<00:03:28.989> pop<00:03:29.290> in<00:03:29.530> it's<00:03:30.220> reading

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
just put the thermal pop in it's reading

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:34.259 
just put the thermal pop in it's reading
179<00:03:31.989> one<00:03:32.380> thing<00:03:32.560> I<00:03:32.680> meant<00:03:32.920> to<00:03:33.099> mention<00:03:33.340> was

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:34.269 
179 one thing I meant to mention was

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:36.809 
179 one thing I meant to mention was
that<00:03:34.299> the<00:03:34.840> thermo<00:03:35.349> pop<00:03:35.590> has<00:03:35.860> a<00:03:35.890> temperature

00:03:36.809 --> 00:03:36.819 
that the thermo pop has a temperature

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:42.240 
that the thermo pop has a temperature
range<00:03:37.090> of<00:03:37.860> minus<00:03:38.860> 58<00:03:39.750> to<00:03:41.220> 572<00:03:42.220> degrees

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
range of minus 58 to 572 degrees

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.590 
range of minus 58 to 572 degrees
Fahrenheit<00:03:43.180> or<00:03:43.420> minus<00:03:43.900> 50<00:03:44.350> to<00:03:44.560> 300<00:03:44.980> degrees

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
Fahrenheit or minus 50 to 300 degrees

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:50.930 
Fahrenheit or minus 50 to 300 degrees
Celsius<00:03:46.600> and<00:03:48.000> it<00:03:49.000> also<00:03:49.180> has<00:03:49.630> a<00:03:49.660> plus<00:03:50.620> or<00:03:50.829> minus

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
Celsius and it also has a plus or minus

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:56.280 
Celsius and it also has a plus or minus
2<00:03:51.940> degree<00:03:53.190> accuracy<00:03:54.190> a<00:03:54.400> 2<00:03:55.389> degree<00:03:55.540> Fahrenheit

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
2 degree accuracy a 2 degree Fahrenheit

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.430 
2 degree accuracy a 2 degree Fahrenheit
of<00:03:56.500> accuracy<00:03:56.980> up<00:03:57.310> to<00:03:57.489> 248<00:03:58.450> degrees<00:03:58.630> Fahrenheit

00:03:59.430 --> 00:03:59.440 
of accuracy up to 248 degrees Fahrenheit

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:04.080 
of accuracy up to 248 degrees Fahrenheit
so<00:04:00.480> super<00:04:01.480> accurate<00:04:01.720> again<00:04:02.380> it<00:04:02.530> reads<00:04:02.829> in<00:04:03.220> five

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 
so super accurate again it reads in five

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.319 
so super accurate again it reads in five
to<00:04:04.329> five<00:04:04.840> to<00:04:05.079> six<00:04:05.290> seconds<00:04:05.769> so<00:04:06.459> I<00:04:06.760> wanted<00:04:07.269> to

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:07.329 
to five to six seconds so I wanted to

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:10.020 
to five to six seconds so I wanted to
show<00:04:07.569> you<00:04:07.630> just<00:04:08.590> like<00:04:09.040> I'll<00:04:09.549> show<00:04:09.760> needs<00:04:09.970> a

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
show you just like I'll show needs a

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:13.289 
show you just like I'll show needs a
second<00:04:10.389> ago<00:04:10.540> how<00:04:10.780> the<00:04:10.840> the<00:04:12.000> display<00:04:13.000> can

00:04:13.289 --> 00:04:13.299 
second ago how the the display can

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:16.229 
second ago how the the display can
rotate<00:04:13.540> so<00:04:14.079> obviously<00:04:14.500> it's<00:04:14.709> kind<00:04:15.010> of<00:04:15.160> kind<00:04:16.090> of

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239 
rotate so obviously it's kind of kind of

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:18.629 
rotate so obviously it's kind of kind of
rotated<00:04:16.900> 90<00:04:17.320> degrees<00:04:17.350> so<00:04:17.739> if<00:04:18.280> I<00:04:18.400> want<00:04:18.579> to

00:04:18.629 --> 00:04:18.639 
rotated 90 degrees so if I want to

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:20.219 
rotated 90 degrees so if I want to
rotate<00:04:18.789> it<00:04:19.060> or<00:04:19.329> read<00:04:19.479> it<00:04:19.510> better<00:04:19.810> at<00:04:20.139> a

00:04:20.219 --> 00:04:20.229 
rotate it or read it better at a

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:22.529 
rotate it or read it better at a
horizontal<00:04:20.919> angle<00:04:21.099> I'll<00:04:21.910> just<00:04:22.150> come<00:04:22.389> over

00:04:22.529 --> 00:04:22.539

multiple<00:05:43.720> times<00:05:43.780> a<00:05:44.169> week<00:05:44.910> it's<00:05:45.910> obviously<00:05:46.330> a

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:46.419 
multiple times a week it's obviously a

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:48.659 
multiple times a week it's obviously a
lot<00:05:46.660> more<00:05:46.900> expensive<00:05:47.260> than<00:05:47.530> this<00:05:47.889> thermal<00:05:48.490> pop

00:05:48.659 --> 00:05:48.669
