 olympics of Paraguay a good day for 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:04.740
 you ricardo here the concern 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.080
 journalistic leads us to consult 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.519
 on the topic renzo revoredo player who 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.160
 it sounds a lot for the barcelona of 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:14.030
 guayaquil there is this possibility sir 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.030
 tavarelli good morning 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:22.619
 But first good morning to 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:25.130
 great audience the people of always us 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.600
 have tried and I feel a 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.789
 Ecuadorian more when I go there because 

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:32.950
 I have a long way 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:35.860
 and good doing well I come 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:39.010
 we do not have anything official or if 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:41.109
 was his agent javier should not 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:44.219
 if we are seeing see here we 

00:00:41.109 --> 00:00:46.630
 we have the first foreigner in Paraguay 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.270
 surely they are 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:52.300
 we can only have four love 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:55.480
 then that situation so we 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:57.760
 we have to eradicate players 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:01.960
 and those kind of things go through those a 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:06.670
 side player national team 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:09.820
 unbeatable conditions I do not want the 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:12.220
 technician then decided that situation 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:15.490
 so that we have in this case to want 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:18.970
 see where to reposition our players and 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:21.670
 I know him but surely 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:23.430
 surely surely javier or see that 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.640
 your agent 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.170
 could give you better ones 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.050
 details was also running with 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:34.440
 these with lace still had also 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:39.450
 Argentine proposals had answers 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:43.920
 also from brazil so we were 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:47.490
 we draw it and now we go but 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:50.100
 just as he sent them running it was clear 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.900
 ricardo is that the reboredo contract 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.140
 with a with olympia for how long 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:56.550
 is because here the weight and the decision 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.750
 Olimpia is going to take it, which is the 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:59.780
 owner of the sports rights of the 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.780
 player 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.210
 with him he has a contract with us until 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:06.880
 on December 31 with an option to 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:09.250
 buy us economic and 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:12.190
 federative so everything in that sense 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.989
 we do not have any problems 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.390
 and you are willing to negotiate at 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:18.069
 player before an offer that is the most 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:23.230
 Suitable for all are pearls with 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:28.150
 minimum conditions for the 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:32.950
 can go and by chance I can be happy 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:35.500
 with him also close the numbers 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:39.600
 surely that was correct then 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.600
 it's a possibility and there's nothing official
