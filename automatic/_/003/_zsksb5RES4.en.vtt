00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
for those of you that don't know this is

for those of you that don't know this is
the<00:00:57.870> church<00:00:58.109> key<00:00:59.930> has<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.170> same<00:01:01.379> kind<00:01:01.649> of

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
the church key has the same kind of

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.090 
the church key has the same kind of
shape<00:01:01.800> on<00:01:02.250> it<00:01:02.399> that<00:01:02.579> puncher<00:01:03.059> thing<00:01:03.860> but<00:01:04.860> the

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
shape on it that puncher thing but the

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.929 
shape on it that puncher thing but the
bit<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.519> problem<00:01:05.970> is<00:01:07.280> the<00:01:08.280> crotchet<00:01:08.729> tool

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
bit the problem is the crotchet tool

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.700 
bit the problem is the crotchet tool
punches<00:01:09.390> holes<00:01:09.540> on<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:09.960> top<00:01:09.990> because<00:01:10.560> it

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
punches holes on the top because it

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.910 
punches holes on the top because it
screws<00:01:11.130> into<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.729> outlet<00:01:12.689> valve<00:01:12.920> which

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
screws into the outlet valve which

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.890 
screws into the outlet valve which
that's<00:01:14.159> another<00:01:14.430> whole<00:01:14.670> thing<00:01:14.909> but<00:01:15.090> there's

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
that's another whole thing but there's

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.749 
that's another whole thing but there's
nothing<00:01:16.350> for<00:01:16.530> this<00:01:16.650> to<00:01:16.830> grip<00:01:17.040> onto

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
nothing for this to grip onto

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.499 
nothing for this to grip onto
now<00:01:18.600> you<00:01:18.689> could<00:01:19.340> possibly<00:01:20.340> grip<00:01:20.670> on<00:01:20.850> here<00:01:21.360> and

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
now you could possibly grip on here and

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.679 
now you could possibly grip on here and
punch<00:01:22.500> into<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:22.979> side<00:01:23.220> or<00:01:23.580> on<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.030> bottom<00:01:24.509> and

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
punch into the side or on the bottom and

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.499 
punch into the side or on the bottom and
punch<00:01:24.900> into<00:01:25.140> it<00:01:25.549> but<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:26.909> problem<00:01:27.090> that<00:01:27.270> comes

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
punch into it but the problem that comes

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.060 
punch into it but the problem that comes
in<00:01:27.689> with<00:01:27.810> that<00:01:27.840> is<00:01:28.200> I<00:01:28.350> think<00:01:28.590> when<00:01:28.770> they<00:01:28.890> want

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
in with that is I think when they want

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.789 
in with that is I think when they want
to<00:01:29.159> see<00:01:29.310> this<00:01:29.490> recycled<00:01:30.329> they<00:01:31.229> want<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.590> holes

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
to see this recycled they want the holes

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.910 
to see this recycled they want the holes
on<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.159> top<00:01:32.780> where<00:01:33.780> it<00:01:33.869> can<00:01:34.049> easily<00:01:34.290> be<00:01:34.680> seen

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
on the top where it can easily be seen

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.219 
on the top where it can easily be seen
by<00:01:35.100> anybody<00:01:35.430> not<00:01:36.210> have<00:01:36.420> to<00:01:36.540> go<00:01:36.689> searching<00:01:37.020> for

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
by anybody not have to go searching for

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.850 
by anybody not have to go searching for

oops might help to take the cover off
there's<00:04:48.730> a<00:04:48.850> protective<00:04:49.510> cover<00:04:50.280> for<00:04:51.280> the<00:04:51.400> point

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:52.680 
there's a protective cover for the point

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.580 
there's a protective cover for the point
so<00:04:53.680> you<00:04:54.040> just<00:04:54.220> stick<00:04:54.430> it<00:04:54.490> there<00:04:55.260> and<00:04:56.260> it<00:04:56.560> just

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:56.590 
so you just stick it there and it just

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:58.440 
so you just stick it there and it just
goes<00:04:56.830> right<00:04:56.950> in<00:04:57.220> much<00:04:57.460> easier<00:04:57.880> than<00:04:58.060> it<00:04:58.210> sit<00:04:58.360> on

00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:58.450 
goes right in much easier than it sit on

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:03.150 
goes right in much easier than it sit on
the<00:04:58.570> side<00:04:59.070> turn<00:05:00.070> it<00:05:00.220> a<00:05:00.250> little<00:05:00.430> bit<00:05:02.040> and<00:05:03.040> it

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:03.160 
the side turn it a little bit and it

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.430 
the side turn it a little bit and it
just<00:05:03.340> goes<00:05:03.490> right<00:05:03.700> in<00:05:03.840> so<00:05:04.840> this<00:05:04.960> acts<00:05:05.200> like<00:05:05.320> a

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:05.440 
just goes right in so this acts like a

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.440 
just goes right in so this acts like a
fulcrum<00:05:05.919> up<00:05:06.100> here<00:05:06.340> it's<00:05:06.520> a<00:05:06.580> bigger<00:05:06.790> fulcrum<00:05:07.330> I

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:07.450 
fulcrum up here it's a bigger fulcrum I

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:10.290 
fulcrum up here it's a bigger fulcrum I
guess<00:05:07.690> then<00:05:08.560> what<00:05:08.770> you<00:05:08.890> have<00:05:08.919> on<00:05:09.880> a<00:05:09.940> small

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:10.300 
guess then what you have on a small

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:16.680 
guess then what you have on a small
church<00:05:10.600> key<00:05:12.330> so<00:05:14.700> as<00:05:15.700> far<00:05:15.940> as<00:05:16.090> I'm<00:05:16.210> concerned

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:19.180 
and my buddies too they only use this

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:20.430 
and my buddies too they only use this

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:20.440 
one until they can get their own I

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:21.900 
one until they can get their own I
should<00:05:20.620> have<00:05:20.890> picked<00:05:21.070> up<00:05:21.190> a<00:05:21.280> pile<00:05:21.580> of<00:05:21.610> them

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:21.910 
should have picked up a pile of them

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:25.740 
should have picked up a pile of them
when<00:05:22.060> I<00:05:22.090> was<00:05:22.270> at<00:05:22.419> Cabela's<00:05:24.240> for<00:05:25.240> under<00:05:25.510> six

when I was at Cabela's for under six

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:28.830 
when I was at Cabela's for under six
dollars<00:05:26.260> if<00:05:27.250> you<00:05:28.150> go<00:05:28.300> through<00:05:28.480> a<00:05:28.570> lot<00:05:28.810> of

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:28.840 
dollars if you go through a lot of

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:33.240 
dollars if you go through a lot of
canisters<00:05:29.560> I<00:05:30.960> say<00:05:31.960> get<00:05:32.230> it<00:05:32.260> if<00:05:32.620> you<00:05:32.860> can<00:05:32.890> find

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:33.250 
canisters I say get it if you can find

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:37.110 
canisters I say get it if you can find
one<00:05:33.460> somewhere<00:05:35.130> like<00:05:36.130> I<00:05:36.220> said<00:05:36.400> this<00:05:36.610> cost<00:05:36.940> me

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:37.120 
one somewhere like I said this cost me

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.840 
one somewhere like I said this cost me
six<00:05:37.390> bucks<00:05:37.450> I<00:05:37.810> think<00:05:37.870> it's<00:05:38.200> only<00:05:38.380> like<00:05:39.370> six<00:05:39.700> or

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:39.850 
six bucks I think it's only like six or

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:44.370 
six bucks I think it's only like six or
seven<00:05:39.880> dollars<00:05:40.540> for<00:05:40.570> the<00:05:40.990> list<00:05:41.320> price<00:05:41.650> but<00:05:43.380> I

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:44.380 
seven dollars for the list price but I

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:47.250 
seven dollars for the list price but I
think<00:05:45.370> this<00:05:45.490> is<00:05:45.669> worth<00:05:45.880> it<00:05:46.090> especially<00:05:46.930> if<00:05:47.169> you

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:47.260 
think this is worth it especially if you

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.400 
think this is worth it especially if you
go<00:05:47.380> through<00:05:47.560> a<00:05:47.620> lot<00:05:47.770> of<00:05:47.830> canisters<00:05:48.370> I<00:05:48.520> don't

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:49.410
