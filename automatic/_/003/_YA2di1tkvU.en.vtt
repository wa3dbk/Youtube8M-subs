00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.970

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:17.230

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:18.880
 poinsettia good but thank God that 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.580

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:43.270
 the night and sleep peacefully I go 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.750
 to be in the room that is there 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:49.730

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:54.070
 arranging there for him to rest 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:58.000
 Have a good night thanks to 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.000
