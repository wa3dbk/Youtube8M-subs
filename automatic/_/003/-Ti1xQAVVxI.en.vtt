Liberation<00:00:40.230> Army<00:00:40.860> Marine<00:00:41.460> Corps<00:00:41.730> it's<00:00:42.239> got

Liberation Army Marine Corps it's got

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.250 
Liberation Army Marine Corps it's got
some<00:00:43.500> general<00:00:44.340> similarities<00:00:45.059> to<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.360> ak-47

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
some general similarities to the ak-47

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.639 
some general similarities to the ak-47
doing<00:00:47.190> its<00:00:47.340> general<00:00:47.700> general<00:00:48.239> looks<00:00:48.510> I<00:00:48.780> think

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
doing its general general looks I think

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.950 
doing its general general looks I think
that's<00:00:50.129> probably<00:00:50.309> why<00:00:50.550> it's<00:00:50.940> often<00:00:51.270> referred

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
that's probably why it's often referred

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.799 
that's probably why it's often referred
to<00:00:52.199> as<00:00:52.590> it<00:00:52.770> as<00:00:52.890> a<00:00:52.920> neck<00:00:53.160> a<00:00:53.370> variant<00:00:53.910> by<00:00:54.120> yeah<00:00:54.510> a

to as it as a neck a variant by yeah a

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.260 
to as it as a neck a variant by yeah a

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
like the overall profile of it looks

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.270 
like the overall profile of it looks
looks<00:00:59.940> pretty<00:01:00.270> similar<00:01:00.629> but<00:01:00.920> it's<00:01:01.920> actually

let's take a look at the stats in
homefront<00:01:25.140> so<00:01:25.470> we're<00:01:25.770> like<00:01:26.280> with<00:01:26.430> most<00:01:26.670> of<00:01:26.790> the

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
homefront so we're like with most of the

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
t3a k has a high damage it actually

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.819 
t3a k has a high damage it actually
kills<00:01:34.710> in<00:01:35.100> one<00:01:35.130> less<00:01:35.640> shot<00:01:36.240> at<00:01:37.020> medium<00:01:37.590> range

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
kills in one less shot at medium range

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.490

this slow rate of fire and the high

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:12.810 
out and like I mentioned we've got the

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:15.409 
out and like I mentioned we've got the
high<00:05:13.020> recoil<00:05:13.440> with<00:05:14.010> bt3<00:05:14.370> okay<00:05:14.910> with<00:05:15.150> burst

high recoil with bt3 okay with burst
firing<00:05:15.690> being<00:05:16.050> necessary<00:05:16.560> so<00:05:17.130> the<00:05:17.370> the<00:05:17.940> sodium

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:18.330

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.930 
firing being necessary so the the sodium
ability<00:05:19.169> just<00:05:19.320> helps<00:05:19.710> reduce<00:05:20.460> that<00:05:20.610> recoil

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:20.940 
ability just helps reduce that recoil

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:23.510 
ability just helps reduce that recoil
when<00:05:21.180> aiming<00:05:21.419> down<00:05:21.570> sights<00:05:21.990> so<00:05:22.380> you<00:05:22.520> more

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520 
when aiming down sights so you more

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.159 
when aiming down sights so you more
likely<00:05:23.790> to<00:05:23.970> get<00:05:24.180> those<00:05:24.330> longer<00:05:24.690> range<00:05:24.900> shots
