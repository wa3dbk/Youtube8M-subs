00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
the side when the two cuts meet you'll

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.030 
the side when the two cuts meet you'll
have<00:00:36.540> an<00:00:36.660> apple<00:00:37.020> wedge<00:00:37.170> that<00:00:37.440> pops<00:00:37.710> right<00:00:37.860> out

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
have an apple wedge that pops right out

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.069 
have an apple wedge that pops right out
and<00:00:38.489> while<00:00:39.090> we're<00:00:39.210> here<00:00:39.239> let's<00:00:39.570> cut<00:00:39.870> a<00:00:39.899> piece

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
and while we're here let's cut a piece

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.619 
and while we're here let's cut a piece
from<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.410> other<00:00:40.440> side<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:41.040> same<00:00:41.250> way<00:00:41.480> now<00:00:42.480> our

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
from the other side the same way now our

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.360 
from the other side the same way now our
goal<00:00:42.840> with<00:00:42.989> these<00:00:43.140> is<00:00:43.379> to<00:00:43.410> cut<00:00:43.680> out<00:00:43.800> three<00:00:44.190> more

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
goal with these is to cut out three more

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.400 
goal with these is to cut out three more
l-shaped<00:00:44.940> wedges<00:00:45.450> about<00:00:45.899> a<00:00:45.930> quarter<00:00:46.260> inch

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410

thick<00:00:46.680> and<00:00:47.010> this<00:00:47.399> time<00:00:47.610> rather<00:00:47.910> than<00:00:48.030> cutting

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
thick and this time rather than cutting

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.510 
thick and this time rather than cutting
in<00:00:48.570> sideways<00:00:49.079> toward<00:00:49.410> your<00:00:49.590> fingers<00:00:49.950> try

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.040 
in sideways toward your fingers try
turning<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:50.879> piece<00:00:51.120> over<00:00:51.329> so<00:00:51.629> you<00:00:51.719> can<00:00:51.870> cut

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
turning the piece over so you can cut

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.840 
turning the piece over so you can cut
downward<00:00:52.379> and<00:00:52.800> meet<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.190> first<00:00:53.399> cut<00:00:53.640> at<00:00:53.760> the

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
downward and meet the first cut at the

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.029 
downward and meet the first cut at the
bottom<00:00:53.969> now<00:00:54.870> with<00:00:55.020> a<00:00:55.050> little<00:00:55.260> wiggle<00:00:55.500> a<00:00:55.739> new

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039
