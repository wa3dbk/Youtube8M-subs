00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
of the best ones you can get which is

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.590 
of the best ones you can get which is
called<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:05.040> Silver<00:01:05.430> Bullet<00:01:05.610> this<00:01:05.909> has<00:01:06.150> a<00:01:06.180> less

fire<00:01:07.380> rate<00:01:07.560> unless<00:01:07.710> handling<00:01:08.340> and<00:01:08.549> the

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
fire rate unless handling and the

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.640 
fire rate unless handling and the
compromise<00:01:09.360> for<00:01:09.510> that<00:01:09.630> is<00:01:09.750> increased<00:01:10.320> damage

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
compromise for that is increased damage

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.440 
compromise for that is increased damage
and<00:01:10.860> increased<00:01:11.400> accuracy<00:01:11.790> and<00:01:12.060> I<00:01:12.119> really<00:01:12.360> like

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
and increased accuracy and I really like

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.270 
and increased accuracy and I really like
that<00:01:12.570> trade-off<00:01:12.869> it's<00:01:13.320> a<00:01:13.470> very<00:01:13.680> very<00:01:13.890> cool<00:01:14.070> one

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
that trade-off it's a very very cool one

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.310 
that trade-off it's a very very cool one
and<00:01:14.549> it's<00:01:14.880> got<00:01:14.970> this<00:01:15.090> really<00:01:15.299> cool<00:01:15.479> silver<00:01:16.020> and

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320

red<00:01:16.590> theme<00:01:16.920> on<00:01:17.100> it<00:01:17.189> that's<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.460> kind<00:01:17.610> of

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
red theme on it that's the kind of

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.160 
red theme on it that's the kind of
camera<00:01:17.970> that<00:01:18.090> comes<00:01:18.330> with<00:01:18.750> a<00:01:18.780> Supply<00:01:19.110> Drop

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
camera that comes with a Supply Drop

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.080 
camera that comes with a Supply Drop
weapon<00:01:19.740> I've<00:01:19.920> also<00:01:20.070> got<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.340> gold<00:01:20.580> camera<00:01:20.939> on

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
weapon I've also got the gold camera on

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.880 
weapon I've also got the gold camera on
the<00:01:21.180> weapon<00:01:21.450> on<00:01:21.600> top<00:01:21.869> of<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.170> normal<00:01:22.560> one<00:01:22.710> so

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
the weapon on top of the normal one so

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.649 
the weapon on top of the normal one so
that's<00:01:23.460> why<00:01:23.640> it's<00:01:23.790> kind<00:01:23.939> of<00:01:23.970> this<00:01:24.119> mix<00:01:24.450> between

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
that's why it's kind of this mix between

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.179 
that's why it's kind of this mix between
gold<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:25.320> red<00:01:25.590> in<00:01:25.740> case<00:01:25.890> you're<00:01:26.070> wondering

what kind of camera this is or like why
it<00:01:28.350> looks<00:01:28.619> like<00:01:28.829> that<00:01:29.009> it's<00:01:29.130> a<00:01:29.159> very<00:01:29.369> strange

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
this weapon I've gone to choose first

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.999 
this weapon I've gone to choose first
one<00:01:39.329> is<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.659> ballistic<00:01:40.110> CPU<00:01:40.350> and<00:01:40.770> this<00:01:40.860> is

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
one is the ballistic CPU and this is

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.289 
one is the ballistic CPU and this is
pretty<00:01:41.189> much<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.340> only<00:01:41.490> essential<00:01:42.000> one<00:01:42.270> I

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
pretty much the only essential one I

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.060 
pretty much the only essential one I
would<00:01:42.570> recommend<00:01:42.780> for<00:01:43.259> any<00:01:43.380> normal<00:01:43.710> scope<00:01:43.920> it

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
would recommend for any normal scope it

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.039 
would recommend for any normal scope it
reduce<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.610> sway<00:01:44.880> when<00:01:45.299> aiming<00:01:45.540> down<00:01:45.689> sights

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
reduce the sway when aiming down sights

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.810 
reduce the sway when aiming down sights
is<00:01:46.229> less<00:01:46.439> idle<00:01:46.829> sway<00:01:46.950> or<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.610> actual

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
is less idle sway or the actual

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.399 
is less idle sway or the actual
crosshairs<00:01:48.329> I<00:01:48.450> would<00:01:48.570> massively<00:01:49.049> massively

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
crosshairs I would massively massively

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.020 
crosshairs I would massively massively
recommend<00:01:50.130> this<00:01:50.310> can't<00:01:50.549> recommend<00:01:50.790> enough

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
recommend this can't recommend enough

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.429 
recommend this can't recommend enough
it's<00:01:51.450> definitely<00:01:51.930> one<00:01:52.020> of<00:01:52.049> those<00:01:52.170> essential

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
it's definitely one of those essential

it's definitely one of those essential

00:04:06.679 --> 00:04:06.689 
one I've gone for is cloak which I found

00:04:06.689 --> 00:04:08.479 
one I've gone for is cloak which I found
to<00:04:06.810> be<00:04:06.840> surprisingly<00:04:07.590> good<00:04:07.889> often<00:04:08.310> I'll<00:04:08.400> be

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489 
to be surprisingly good often I'll be

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:10.069 
to be surprisingly good often I'll be
looking<00:04:08.819> down<00:04:08.970> very<00:04:09.269> long<00:04:09.449> lines<00:04:09.659> of<00:04:09.840> sight

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:10.079 
looking down very long lines of sight

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:12.499 
looking down very long lines of sight
and<00:04:10.290> the<00:04:10.859> enemies<00:04:11.250> won't<00:04:11.579> be<00:04:11.790> able<00:04:11.970> to<00:04:12.150> see<00:04:12.329> me

00:04:12.499 --> 00:04:12.509 
and the enemies won't be able to see me

00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:13.759 
and the enemies won't be able to see me
because<00:04:12.780> I'm<00:04:12.930> cloak<00:04:13.139> time<00:04:13.349> it<00:04:13.470> is<00:04:13.560> what

find it very difficult to actually see

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:29.940 
find it very difficult to actually see
you<00:04:28.780> and<00:04:28.870> it<00:04:28.930> might<00:04:29.050> gain<00:04:29.350> you<00:04:29.530> an<00:04:29.650> extra

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:29.950 
you and it might gain you an extra

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:31.830 
you and it might gain you an extra
second<00:04:30.370> which<00:04:30.730> is<00:04:30.880> just<00:04:31.120> enough<00:04:31.330> time<00:04:31.570> for<00:04:31.750> you

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 
second which is just enough time for you

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:32.970 
second which is just enough time for you
to<00:04:31.930> be<00:04:31.990> able<00:04:32.050> to<00:04:32.140> take<00:04:32.290> the<00:04:32.410> shot<00:04:32.620> for<00:04:32.770> them<00:04:32.860> to

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:32.980 
to be able to take the shot for them to

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:34.530 
to be able to take the shot for them to
actually<00:04:33.220> notice<00:04:33.580> there's<00:04:33.790> an<00:04:33.910> invisible<00:04:34.390> guy
