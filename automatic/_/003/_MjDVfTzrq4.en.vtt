00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:27.320 
really play mario 64 with just up down

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:29.920 
really play mario 64 with just up down
left<00:06:28.070> and<00:06:28.220> right<00:06:28.310> there<00:06:28.760> were<00:06:28.850> 360<00:06:29.570> degrees<00:06:29.900> so

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:29.930 
left and right there were 360 degrees so

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:32.110 
left and right there were 360 degrees so
it<00:06:30.260> needed<00:06:30.410> a<00:06:30.590> greater<00:06:30.979> range<00:06:31.340> of<00:06:31.550> control<00:06:31.820> and

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:32.120 
it needed a greater range of control and

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:34.000 
it needed a greater range of control and
that's<00:06:32.300> where<00:06:32.690> the<00:06:32.780> analog<00:06:33.110> pad<00:06:33.380> came<00:06:33.620> in<00:06:33.770> the

that's where the analog pad came in the

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:36.310 
that's where the analog pad came in the
rules<00:06:34.220> of<00:06:34.400> 2d<00:06:34.790> are<00:06:35.030> very<00:06:35.540> very<00:06:35.870> different<00:06:36.110> than
