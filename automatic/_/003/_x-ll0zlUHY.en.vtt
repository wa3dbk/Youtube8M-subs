to park store and it goes in here and
then<00:01:10.290> I<00:01:10.590> found<00:01:11.310> out<00:01:11.490> these<00:01:12.180> a<00:01:12.210> little

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
then I found out these a little

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.080 
then I found out these a little
screwdriver<00:01:12.990> back<00:01:13.290> behind<00:01:13.500> it<00:01:13.770> works<00:01:14.090> really

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
screwdriver back behind it works really

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.780 
screwdriver back behind it works really
easily<00:01:15.240> among<00:01:15.689> us<00:01:15.840> which<00:01:15.990> hands<00:01:16.229> here<00:01:19.790> I'm

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
easily among us which hands here I'm

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.469 
easily among us which hands here I'm
just<00:01:21.030> run<00:01:21.360> it<00:01:22.340> run<00:01:23.340> it<00:01:23.400> along<00:01:23.580> there<00:01:23.970> if<00:01:24.210> it's

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
just run it run it along there if it's

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.649 
just run it run it along there if it's
warmer<00:01:24.990> it<00:01:25.170> supposedly<00:01:25.860> supposed<00:01:26.280> to<00:01:26.520> work<00:01:27.509> a

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
warmer it supposedly supposed to work a

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:33.330 
warmer it supposedly supposed to work a
little<00:01:27.750> better

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:39.430 

there<00:01:34.340> we<00:01:34.430> go<00:01:34.580> that's<00:01:34.940> about<00:01:35.240> it<00:01:36.220> no<00:01:37.220> I<00:01:38.320> cut<00:01:39.320> it

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:39.440 
there we go that's about it no I cut it

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.590 
there we go that's about it no I cut it
off<00:01:39.560> my<00:01:40.520> strip<00:01:40.850> and<00:01:40.970> then<00:01:41.060> I'll<00:01:41.150> tuck<00:01:41.360> it<00:01:41.480> in

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
off my strip and then I'll tuck it in

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.800 
off my strip and then I'll tuck it in
there<00:01:41.780> and<00:01:41.900> that'll<00:01:42.080> be<00:01:42.200> it<00:01:42.290> so<00:01:43.600> it's<00:01:44.600> a<00:01:44.690> lot

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
there and that'll be it so it's a lot

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.290 
there and that'll be it so it's a lot
easier<00:01:45.380> than<00:01:45.590> I<00:01:45.710> thought<00:01:45.890> it<00:01:46.070> would<00:01:46.130> be<00:01:46.340> but

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:47.300 
easier than I thought it would be but

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.960 
easier than I thought it would be but
without<00:01:47.570> that<00:01:47.840> tool<00:01:48.250> it's<00:01:49.250> a<00:01:49.340> pain<00:01:49.580> in<00:01:49.700> the<00:01:49.730> ass

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 
without that tool it's a pain in the ass

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.840 
without that tool it's a pain in the ass
so<00:01:50.710> pick<00:01:51.710> up<00:01:51.860> one<00:01:52.010> of<00:01:52.070> them<00:01:52.160> tools<00:01:52.400> and<00:01:52.640> it<00:01:52.700> goes

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
so pick up one of them tools and it goes

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:54.490 
so pick up one of them tools and it goes
like<00:01:52.910> 15<00:01:53.420> bucks<00:01:53.660> at<00:01:53.900> the<00:01:54.020> auto<00:01:54.140> parts<00:01:54.230> store

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
like 15 bucks at the auto parts store

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.890 
like 15 bucks at the auto parts store
and<00:01:54.770> they<00:01:54.830> come<00:01:56.290> for<00:01:57.290> different<00:01:57.440> size<00:01:57.860> of

00:01:58.890 --> 00:01:58.900 
and they come for different size of

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:03.360 
and they come for different size of
walking<00:01:59.900> strips<00:02:00.280> so<00:02:01.280> that<00:02:02.180> went<00:02:02.360> pretty<00:02:02.480> good

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:03.370 
walking strips so that went pretty good

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:05.980
