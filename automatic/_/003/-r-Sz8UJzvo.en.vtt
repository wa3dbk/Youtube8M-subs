00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
bit like this they break right off so

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.760 
bit like this they break right off so
you're<00:02:06.119> applying<00:02:06.540> light<00:02:07.020> pressure<00:02:07.049> you're

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
lining and then the tip just breaks

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.470 
lining and then the tip just breaks
right<00:02:10.229> off<00:02:10.440> so<00:02:11.099> I<00:02:11.129> don't<00:02:11.580> like<00:02:11.910> that<00:02:11.970> about

have<00:04:57.180> retracted<00:04:58.180> up<00:04:58.360> or<00:04:58.599> whatever<00:04:59.020> you<00:04:59.080> want

00:04:59.189 --> 00:04:59.199 
have retracted up or whatever you want

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:02.969 
have retracted up or whatever you want
to<00:04:59.259> call<00:04:59.410> it<00:05:00.090> turned<00:05:01.090> up<00:05:01.330> like<00:05:01.740> even<00:05:02.740> if<00:05:02.830> it's

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:02.979 
to call it turned up like even if it's

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:05.790 
to call it turned up like even if it's
the<00:05:03.130> smallest<00:05:03.400> amount<00:05:04.300> it<00:05:04.720> still<00:05:05.139> breaks

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:05.800 
the smallest amount it still breaks

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:09.120 
the smallest amount it still breaks
right<00:05:06.160> off<00:05:06.310> so<00:05:07.150> anyways<00:05:07.630> those<00:05:08.229> are<00:05:08.289> those<00:05:08.680> I

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:09.130 
right off so anyways those are those I

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:12.810 
right off so anyways those are those I
would<00:05:09.729> probably<00:05:10.180> give<00:05:10.780> these<00:05:11.289> to<00:05:11.620> like<00:05:12.460> a<00:05:12.550> 1

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:12.820 
would probably give these to like a 1

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:15.779 
would probably give these to like a 1
out<00:05:12.970> of<00:05:13.030> 5<00:05:13.270> and<00:05:13.780> these<00:05:14.650> I<00:05:15.009> would<00:05:15.160> probably<00:05:15.460> give

00:05:15.779 --> 00:05:15.789 
out of 5 and these I would probably give

00:05:15.789 --> 00:05:19.409 
out of 5 and these I would probably give
about<00:05:16.000> a<00:05:16.030> 4<00:05:16.539> out<00:05:16.660> of<00:05:16.720> 5<00:05:17.250> but<00:05:18.250> definitely<00:05:18.820> if<00:05:19.090> I

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:19.419 
about a 4 out of 5 but definitely if I

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:21.659 
about a 4 out of 5 but definitely if I
had<00:05:19.570> to<00:05:19.659> choose<00:05:19.900> between<00:05:19.930> this<00:05:20.620> and<00:05:20.919> cream<00:05:21.520> all

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:21.669 
had to choose between this and cream all

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:23.670 
had to choose between this and cream all
on<00:05:21.789> my<00:05:21.880> Mac<00:05:22.060> I<00:05:22.300> would<00:05:22.449> choose<00:05:22.599> cream<00:05:23.050> Ola<00:05:23.349> only

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:23.680 
on my Mac I would choose cream Ola only

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.500 
on my Mac I would choose cream Ola only
because<00:05:23.979> it<00:05:24.099> doesn't<00:05:24.370> break<00:05:24.550> as<00:05:24.580> easy<00:05:24.880> and<00:05:25.150> the

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:25.510 
because it doesn't break as easy and the

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:28.200 
because it doesn't break as easy and the
color<00:05:25.720> is<00:05:25.870> perfect<00:05:26.220> but<00:05:27.220> this<00:05:27.460> price<00:05:27.699> point<00:05:28.060> is

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:28.210 
color is perfect but this price point is

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:31.580 
color is perfect but this price point is
a<00:05:28.240> lot<00:05:28.599> better<00:05:28.840> so<00:05:29.620> you<00:05:30.039> kind<00:05:30.250> of<00:05:30.310> just<00:05:30.370> have<00:05:30.610> to

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:31.590 
a lot better so you kind of just have to

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:34.080 
a lot better so you kind of just have to
go<00:05:32.590> with<00:05:32.800> what<00:05:32.979> you're<00:05:33.130> going<00:05:33.340> to<00:05:33.370> go<00:05:33.580> with<00:05:33.760> so

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:34.090 
go with what you're going to go with so

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:35.969 
go with what you're going to go with so
you<00:05:34.150> can<00:05:34.570> pay<00:05:34.780> a<00:05:34.810> little<00:05:34.900> bit<00:05:35.199> more<00:05:35.500> and<00:05:35.770> get

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:35.979 
you can pay a little bit more and get

00:05:35.979 --> 00:05:37.560 
you can pay a little bit more and get
the<00:05:36.130> stuff<00:05:36.340> that's<00:05:36.520> not<00:05:36.639> going<00:05:36.820> to<00:05:36.880> break<00:05:37.060> you

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:37.570 
the stuff that's not going to break you

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:39.060 
the stuff that's not going to break you
can<00:05:37.690> pay<00:05:37.960> a<00:05:37.990> little<00:05:38.080> bit<00:05:38.289> less<00:05:38.409> and<00:05:38.740> deal<00:05:39.039> with

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:39.070 
can pay a little bit less and deal with

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:41.490 
can pay a little bit less and deal with
him<00:05:39.340> but<00:05:40.030> anyways<00:05:40.330> that's<00:05:40.659> my<00:05:40.840> take<00:05:41.199> on<00:05:41.320> those

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:41.500 
him but anyways that's my take on those

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:43.110 
him but anyways that's my take on those
