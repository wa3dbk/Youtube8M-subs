okay<00:00:00.480> so<00:00:00.539> this<00:00:00.870> game<00:00:01.140> has<00:00:01.380> a<00:00:01.410> bonkers<00:00:01.890> name<00:00:02.190> but

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:02.490 
okay so this game has a bonkers name but

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:04.579 
okay so this game has a bonkers name but
I<00:00:02.580> guess<00:00:02.790> by<00:00:03.030> rights<00:00:03.330> it<00:00:03.540> should<00:00:03.600> do<00:00:04.080> as<00:00:04.350> its

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
I guess by rights it should do as its

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:06.349 
I guess by rights it should do as its
developed<00:00:04.740> by<00:00:05.100> Platinum<00:00:05.640> Games<00:00:05.879> the<00:00:06.330> same

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
developed by Platinum Games the same

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:08.480 
developed by Platinum Games the same
people<00:00:06.930> that<00:00:06.960> made<00:00:07.080> the<00:00:07.379> out<00:00:07.560> there<00:00:07.859> Bayonetta

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
people that made the out there Bayonetta

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.669 
people that made the out there Bayonetta
it's<00:00:08.970> actually<00:00:09.450> a<00:00:09.510> rather<00:00:09.690> odd<00:00:10.019> fusion

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
it's actually a rather odd fusion

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:12.410 
it's actually a rather odd fusion
because<00:00:10.980> it<00:00:11.070> mixes<00:00:11.400> frantic<00:00:11.880> action<00:00:12.120> you

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
because it mixes frantic action you

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.180 
because it mixes frantic action you
wouldn't<00:00:12.780> expect<00:00:13.170> to<00:00:13.259> see<00:00:13.500> in<00:00:13.590> a<00:00:13.650> metal<00:00:13.980> gear

wouldn't expect to see in a metal gear
game<00:00:14.219> with<00:00:14.700> stuff<00:00:15.000> you<00:00:15.179> would<00:00:15.420> expect<00:00:15.780> to<00:00:15.900> see
