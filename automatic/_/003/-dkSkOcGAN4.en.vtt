00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.600
Humans began farming roughly 12,000
years ago by domesticating animals

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.590
and cultivating the
soil to produce crops.

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.020
Prior to that, people were
hunters and gatherers.

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:18.160
As we discussed last week, agriculture
provided an abundance of food

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.800
that lead to exponential
growth of the human population.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.340
Agriculture gave people time
to pursue other activities.

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.050
Agriculture also lead to
environmental degradation.

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:32.970
A long time ago, farming was done
exclusively with human labor.

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:37.240
Then animals assisted with
plowing the soil and other tasks.

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.750
Eventually, machinery was
introduced to the farm.

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:45.980
Over time, agriculture became dependent
on mechanization, chemical fertilizers,

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:47.780
and chemical pesticides.

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.810
All of these processes relied on fossil
fuel energy as fuel for the machinery

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:56.360
and as the source of the
fertilizer and the pesticides.

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.220
In the last 100 years
in developed countries,

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:02.520
fewer and fewer people have
been needed as more and more

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.830
fossil fuel energy replaced
human energy on the farm.

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.500
I am standing here alongside an
organic farm in Fairlee, Vermont,

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.570
in the United States named "Your Farm."

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.920
The farm is adjacent to
the Connecticut River,

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.940
and before hydro dams changed the
flooding patterns along the river,

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.720
sediments would frequently wash
up onto the farmland providing

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.170
silts and clays that enriched the soil.

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.750
So what is organic agriculture?

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.770
Organic agriculture is
the production of crops

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.540
without the use of synthetic
pesticides or fertilizers.

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.330
Organic agriculture, similar
to conventional agriculture,

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.590
does utilize fossil
fuels and mechanization.

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.290
It does plow the soil,
exposing it to erosion.

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:55.830
Organic agriculture can still be
detrimental to the natural environment.

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.260
Typically, a given area
of land will produce more,

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.550
at least in the short
term, if it is being

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:04.530
farmed with intensive
commercial techniques

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.340
than if it is under organic agriculture.

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.970
However, over time,
commercial agriculture

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.910
will deplete the soil of nutrients and
organic matter, lower biodiversity,

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.430
and may eventually result in
lower productivity of the land.

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.460
Ultimately, commercial agriculture
reduces ecosystem services

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:25.960
of our terrestrial systems,
while organic agriculture

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.250
enhances those ecosystem services.

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.280
This may be better
for the natural world,

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:37.250
but can we feed the 7.2 billion people
on the planet while farming this way?

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.660
These are some of the
questions we need to consider

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.250
from an environmental
science perspective.

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.720
Let's talk about present day status
of human nutrition in the world.

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.460
Undernutrition, or
chronic hunger, means not

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:52.200
consuming enough calories to be healthy.

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.750
Undernutrition can lead to
higher susceptibility to disease,

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.920
and in children can lead to lower IQ.

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.930
Malnutrition means regardless of the
number of calories a person consumes,

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.700
their diet lacks the correct balance of
carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:08.860
and minerals.

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.020
The World Health
Organization, WHO, estimates

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:16.360
that three billion people
are malnourished worldwide.

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.050
Large scale malnourishment
and undernourishment

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:22.910
are often results of food
insecurity and/or famine.

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:26.170
Food insecurity refers to the
condition in which people do not

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.560
have adequate access to food.

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.240
Famine is a condition in which
food insecurity is so extreme

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.550
that large numbers of
deaths occur in a given

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:39.530
area over a relatively
short period of time.

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:44.390
Overnutrition is the ingestion of
too many calories and improper foods

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:47.730
and causes a person
to become overweight.

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.660
Overnutrition has become more
prevalent in recent decades,

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:52.870
especially in the developed world.

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.890
The WHO estimates that
there are one billion people

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:57.800
in the world who are overweight.

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:03.220
300 million of these billion people are
obese, meaning they are more than 20%

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:05.400
above their ideal weight.

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.990
Overnutrition can lead to increased
risk of type 2 diabetes, hypertension,

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:12.170
heart disease, and stroke.

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:16.160
Overnutrition tends to be more common in
developed countries such as the United

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:21.170
States, but unfortunately, it is
increasing in many parts of the world.
