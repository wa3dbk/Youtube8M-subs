 50 minutes 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.479
 the opening of the score in this

 diminished well adapted they are in 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.580

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.710
 bulldoze the Fijian koyamaibole who 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:02.930

 of rugby just a point of 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.490
 fixing with the relay of the third 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.140
 pejoine line and who will fix the defense 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:14.450

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.330
 we will alternate after going through 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.770

 takes the advantage 12 to 3 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:38.000

 do not appreciate the excitement 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.930
 posted by bayonne and especially that 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.730

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.860
 they are always taken away by incredible 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.450
 calf and drop that will allow and 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:03.320

 in the point of the defensive bonus they go 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:23.810
 so rely on a game a little bit 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:26.510
 restrictive but they will still 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:28.370
