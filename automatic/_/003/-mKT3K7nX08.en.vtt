00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:10.490
 I hate what fly the snakes the 

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:11.990
 the lateness of me that 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:20.720
 somehow always fallen six hours 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:23.050
 in a place undisturbed actually the 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.050
 the whole time 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:52.850
 someone threatened every 20 minutes 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.160
 to kill the passenger on this flight 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:58.730
 unless it will be 150 million dollars 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:00.590
 atlantic transferred to this account 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:03.130
 how busy is he with it 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.130
 get through 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.490
 i have to ask him all hands over 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:19.850
 to take the head is not a good one 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.850
 suggestion 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:25.650
 that could have called us 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.870
 runs on her name that results 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.760
 no sense 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:31.690
 something can not be right there 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.690
 something else in front of him 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.230
 the fbi the white house and interpol 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.790
 confirm that reports 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:46.400
 International flight from an air 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.510
 Marshal has been abducted 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.040
 his fighter jet of the skater she has in 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:51.480
 Visors can not understand them and 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.570
 Although they can do that for the time being 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.570
 understand 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.550
 I do not run this plane 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:06.640
 I want to save it
