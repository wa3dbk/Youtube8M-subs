00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:17.140
 enjoyed they just stood for me and 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:19.000
 the statute of this summer natalya Viktorovna 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.890
 celebrated the fiftieth anniversary 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.849
 the slow cooker was an expensive gift from 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.610
 loving husband 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:26.869
 hoped to make it easier for his wife 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:31.660
 it could be 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:35.920
 she turned it on and went to study 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:37.840
 household because there everything 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.100
 automatically work 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.719
 however claim a woman by 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.000
 donated device could not 

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:46.789
 elementary cook rice porridge not 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.160
 to mention the exquisite dishes of meaning 

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:49.730
 Xia in the book that came with household 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.789
 technology 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:55.339
 I also buy a little I have here 

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:57.800
 electric stove i have a steamer 

00:00:55.339 --> 00:01:00.350
 but I needed her since I was sick 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.030
 I needed and that after all porridge and already porridge 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.670
 Harry has already started to burn 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:07.430
 we waited more than an hour for her 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.320
 automation worked but it didn't work 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.420
 not yet turned off and generally strike a 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.820
 annoying trouble that happened 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.510
 husband Nikolai Vasilievich told the goods 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.060
 the seller 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:18.290
 and the one instead of the expected male replacement 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.630
 goods on the same 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:23.470
 or refund could only offer 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:28.480
 buyer repair first first time i 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:31.790
 tried to cook rice porridge all as 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:35.090
 instructions did it all I 'm waiting passes 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:38.120
 half an hour passes more now 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:41.090
 passes already went 1:05 she doesn't 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:43.850
 turns off she fell asleep all the recipe 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.870
 According to the instructions for ten times its read 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.690
 this instruction 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:49.790
 before the new machine after all a 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.430
 then you can shower time but I think shush 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:54.410
 so it does not turn off an hour passes 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:57.710
 1:05 it doesnâ€™t turn off I'm already on 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:59.720
 stop button because of reggae and burn 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.880
 porridge and burned multicooker 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.530
 This should not be claimed by Natalia 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.870
 Viktorovna according to her after finishing 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.119
 cooking until tender stage device 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:11.269
 should automatically switch to mode 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:14.000
 heating of food which allegedly did not happen 

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:15.540
 because the woman made a clear conclusion 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.090
 It does not work 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.629
 frustration knew no bounds 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.879
 woman 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:24.299
 After all, the neighbors with a similar device have everything 

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:26.519
 getting ready and she hasn't come shop 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:28.650
 I say so and so here the automation is not 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:30.950
 works right there is written in the instructions 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.329
 shell 11 automatic programs 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.849
 buyers had to write a statement 

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:40.200
 in which they asked to repair the goods 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:42.510
 they organics argued that it 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.069
 then we were used to you 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.700
 return money not her husband she was in 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:47.219
 used 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:50.060
 such were the words well and we had to 

00:02:47.219 --> 00:02:52.189
 agree to repair 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:55.290
 hand over her service center 

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:57.239
 lawyer elena ancestors explains in what 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:00.389
 cases you can hope for replacement goods 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:04.379
 or refund the goods proper 

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:07.319
 quality may be the buyer has 

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:08.900
 right to return within 14 days for 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:11.669
 this item should not be in 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:14.689
 consuming it should be 

00:03:11.669 --> 00:03:16.620
 acquisition documents in this case 

00:03:14.689 --> 00:03:18.989
 the buyer has the right to return this 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.790
 goods requests equipment exactly eliminate 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:22.859
 the disadvantage that about the technique 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.720
 used come in 14 days 

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:29.129
 they say we cook u. 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:32.370
 this is the most to write off as it is because 

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:34.799
 that it doesn't work smoothly us anything 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:37.199
 return money like you or money or 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:40.049
 and the exact same slow cooker 

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:41.790
 Perhaps these words were the reason for 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:44.190
 development of the conflict because otherwise 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:46.470
 case, buyers would not hope for 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:48.540
 other outcome and believed that their device 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.519
 really will be renovated 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.729
 Comes to us son look for this likely 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:54.900
 in a week comes smska come 

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:58.500
 take the slow cooker now he already 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:01.949
 starts talking differently that she 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:04.709
 serviceable take it away she is serviceable she 

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:06.599
 should work like this from what said 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:08.669
 the family manager somehow made a conclusion 

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:10.979
 the floor of the device has not been repaired as 

00:04:08.669 --> 00:04:13.740
 the seller began to assure them that he should 

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:15.870
 so work that is in the understanding of Natalia 

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:17.670
 bor must turn off porridge itself 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.770
 will burn and this is at a time when a woman 

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:21.480
 waiting for automatic shutdown after 

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:23.580
 cooking and switching to mode 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:25.080
 heating and did not apply for a refund 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:27.330
 cash made a request 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:29.610
 repair and fix the flaw 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:32.550
 This technique we gladly accepted 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:36.270
 This a well and eliminate the disadvantage 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:37.860
 which was in this case to handle 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:40.110
 claim for damages 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.880
 can not be because the seller act in 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:43.590
 within the law, the multicooker is located 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:46.710
 the store and I'm not going at all 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:48.750
 pick up from the store so she doesn't give me 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:51.230
 I need such a non-working well why should I 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:53.430
 need we will not stand by dead weight 

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:56.040
 buyers have a few about the war and 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:59.670
 duties so the buyer is obliged 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:02.910
 pick up the goods that was eliminated it 

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:05.040
 to lack if he is not for peace in time 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:07.350
 then the seller to the extent that he can 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:10.110
 make demands to the buyer 

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:10.650
 reimbursement of the storage cost of this 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:12.780
 goods 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:15.150
 before you take the goods the buyer is always 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:15.630
 must check its serviceability if in 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:17.760
 the store 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:18.690
 can not be welded to confirm the working 

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:21.390
 product condition 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:23.880
 can check the visible signs of it 

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:25.660
 health it just works 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:28.060
 at least she 

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:30.010
 Does it even turn on and then, as it were, 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:33.340
 we assume that all her some 

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:35.200
 modes will work if home appliances 

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:37.060
 everything has already crashed everyone just speak in 

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:38.830
 inspection needs to come to the seller 

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:40.900
 leave goods take a receipt stating that 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:43.210
 he was accepted for testing or repair 

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:46.240
 if you have not accepted any statements not goods 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:47.440
 you direct road to the inspection have 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:50.110
 some product groups which 

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:52.750
 really impossible to check in 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:55.390
 store conditions but nevertheless 

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:58.030
 return documents are left to the buyer 

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:59.200
 goods from repair moreover in each 

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:01.480
 warranty booklet 

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:04.540
 and there is a tear-off coupon that is about what 

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:06.430
 This replacement was made and just 

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:08.580
 each following from equal he will 

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:11.890
 testify that the goods 

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:13.600
 repeatedly subjected to repair if 

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:15.010
 the product you purchased broke down 

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:17.140
 second and third time lawyer says 

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:19.060
 Elena ancestor in this case, you can 

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:21.520
 talk about significant flaws 

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:24.340
 product and therefore require its replacement or 

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:27.070
 money back if the disadvantages 

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:29.590
 essentially tests them impossible 

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:32.980
 eliminate or this flaw 

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:36.010
 repeats repeatedly well let's say two 

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:37.420
 three times 1 floor slider that is possible 

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:38.980
 already how to raise the question of what 

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:40.780
 lack of goods and 

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:44.200
 is essential to require 

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:46.480
 termination of the contract and or return 

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:48.900
 cash or replacement of goods on 

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:48.900
 similar
