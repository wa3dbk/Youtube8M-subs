there's a simple way you can extend this

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.790 
there's a simple way you can extend this
elevator<00:00:47.489> if<00:00:47.789> you<00:00:48.360> want<00:00:48.690> you<00:00:48.960> know<00:00:49.079> have<00:00:49.500> air

elevator if you want you know have air

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.700 
elevator if you want you know have air
in<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:51.180> middle<00:00:51.390> of<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.510> elevator<00:00:52.020> you<00:00:52.559> can

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
in the middle of the elevator you can

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.270 
in the middle of the elevator you can
have<00:00:52.949> a<00:00:53.190> water<00:00:53.520> block<00:00:53.820> here<00:00:54.410> instead<00:00:55.410> okay<00:00:56.100> let

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
have a water block here instead okay let

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.529 
have a water block here instead okay let
me<00:00:56.399> show<00:00:56.699> you<00:00:58.430> have<00:00:59.430> it<00:00:59.609> like<00:00:59.789> this<00:01:00.239> normally

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
me show you have it like this normally

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.640 
me show you have it like this normally
and<00:01:00.989> just<00:01:01.680> add<00:01:01.890> more<00:01:02.160> water<00:01:02.390> of<00:01:03.390> course<00:01:03.809> if<00:01:04.080> you

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
and just add more water of course if you

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.530 
and just add more water of course if you
start<00:01:04.920> to<00:01:04.979> run<00:01:05.189> out<00:01:05.220> of<00:01:05.369> air<00:01:05.700> you're<00:01:06.299> going<00:01:06.479> to

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
start to run out of air you're going to

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.289 
start to run out of air you're going to
have<00:01:06.600> a<00:01:06.659> solution<00:01:07.049> and<00:01:07.500> that<00:01:07.530> is<00:01:07.979> to<00:01:08.310> put<00:01:08.549> to

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
have a solution and that is to put to

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:15.910 
have a solution and that is to put to
put<00:01:09.570> a<00:01:09.869> sign<00:01:10.439> here<00:01:10.710> and<00:01:11.960> put<00:01:12.960> encasement<00:01:14.240> and

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
put a sign here and put encasement and

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.520 
put a sign here and put encasement and
put<00:01:16.920> a<00:01:17.220> water<00:01:17.670> source<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:18.390> that<00:01:18.530> will

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
put a water source and that will

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.460 
put a water source and that will
continue<00:01:19.650> to<00:01:20.580> bring<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.150> elevator<00:01:21.840> up<00:01:22.049> I

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
continue to bring the elevator up I

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:28.359 
continue to bring the elevator up I
believe<00:01:23.009> and<00:01:23.490> you<00:01:24.979> can<00:01:25.979> still

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:28.369 
believe and you can still

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:31.760 
believe and you can still
you<00:01:29.369> put<00:01:29.610> it<00:01:29.729> there<00:01:30.030> and<00:01:30.570> you<00:01:30.630> can<00:01:31.380> still

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
you put it there and you can still

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.800 
you put it there and you can still
continue<00:01:32.310> your<00:01:32.759> elevator<00:01:33.180> straight<00:01:33.539> up

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
continue your elevator straight up

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.609 
continue your elevator straight up
without<00:01:34.229> any<00:01:34.619> interference<00:01:35.780> basically<00:01:36.780> so

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
without any interference basically so

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.160 
without any interference basically so
let's<00:01:37.890> go<00:01:38.100> up<00:01:39.200> see<00:01:40.200> no<00:01:40.590> problems<00:01:41.009> because<00:01:41.429> uh

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
let's go up see no problems because uh

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.109 
let's go up see no problems because uh
boats<00:01:43.170> are<00:01:43.500> actually<00:01:44.159> bigger<00:01:44.429> than<00:01:44.549> one<00:01:44.880> block

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
boats are actually bigger than one block

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.710 
boats are actually bigger than one block
so<00:01:45.509> it's<00:01:46.200> fine<00:01:46.560> when<00:01:46.799> you<00:01:46.920> actually<00:01:47.130> do<00:01:47.429> this

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
so it's fine when you actually do this

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.020 
so it's fine when you actually do this
and<00:01:48.720> that<00:01:48.750> could<00:01:49.710> be<00:01:49.829> an<00:01:49.950> easy<00:01:50.280> way<00:01:50.490> to<00:01:50.520> get<00:01:50.880> out

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
and that could be an easy way to get out

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.270 
and that could be an easy way to get out
if<00:01:51.299> you're<00:01:51.600> going<00:01:52.170> straight<00:01:52.319> down<00:01:52.530> on<00:01:52.710> it<00:01:53.130> as

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
if you're going straight down on it as

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.020 
if you're going straight down on it as
well<00:01:53.549> and<00:01:54.170> this<00:01:55.170> is<00:01:55.380> how<00:01:55.530> it<00:01:55.649> works<00:01:55.890> I<00:01:56.159> mean

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
well and this is how it works I mean

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.279 
well and this is how it works I mean
time<00:01:57.420> so<00:01:58.219> these<00:01:59.219> first<00:01:59.640> three<00:01:59.969> blocks<00:02:00.569> have<00:02:01.110> to

00:02:01.279 --> 00:02:01.289 
time so these first three blocks have to

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:03.139 
time so these first three blocks have to
be<00:02:01.380> for<00:02:01.740> all<00:02:01.950> these<00:02:02.399> actually<00:02:02.849> have<00:02:02.939> to<00:02:03.030> be

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
be for all these actually have to be

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.419 
be for all these actually have to be
full<00:02:03.390> water<00:02:03.630> source<00:02:03.929> but<00:02:04.619> on<00:02:04.799> the<00:02:04.950> third<00:02:04.979> block

00:02:05.419 --> 00:02:05.429 
full water source but on the third block

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:06.919 
full water source but on the third block
here<00:02:05.700> i<00:02:05.729> have<00:02:06.030> an<00:02:06.179> opening<00:02:06.360> with<00:02:06.780> an

00:02:06.919 --> 00:02:06.929 
here i have an opening with an

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:09.979 
here i have an opening with an
encasement<00:02:07.319> like<00:02:07.740> up<00:02:07.979> here<00:02:08.280> but<00:02:09.090> instead<00:02:09.539> of<00:02:09.780> a

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
encasement like up here but instead of a

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.900 
encasement like up here but instead of a
full<00:02:10.200> block<00:02:10.500> i<00:02:10.530> have<00:02:10.799> running<00:02:11.130> water<00:02:11.160> in<00:02:11.640> here

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
full block i have running water in here

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.210 
full block i have running water in here
so<00:02:12.540> when<00:02:13.049> i<00:02:13.079> get<00:02:13.319> in<00:02:13.410> the<00:02:13.440> boat<00:02:13.709> it<00:02:13.920> will<00:02:13.980> update

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
so when i get in the boat it will update

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.440 
so when i get in the boat it will update
the<00:02:14.579> boat<00:02:14.760> and<00:02:15.110> the<00:02:16.110> boat<00:02:16.260> will<00:02:16.560> be<00:02:16.620> moved<00:02:16.980> into

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
the boat and the boat will be moved into
