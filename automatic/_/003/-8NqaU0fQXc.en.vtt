00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:06.660
 Well, today began welding 

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:07.769
 small start with such small 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:13.440
 little fools 

00:00:07.769 --> 00:00:15.920
 quietly here so here I am galvanized 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:21.119
 there is 055 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:23.430
 here and here I am trying to her it is me so 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:31.430
 put here such diris great and 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:35.780
 He she on the general now neatly 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:38.639
 boil u on too poured out 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:44.609
 now put this swallow boil 

00:00:38.639 --> 00:00:48.629
 and good about knocking in general start 

00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:51.929
 welding work start with this hole 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.879
 just wanna fit the seat a 

00:00:51.929 --> 00:00:57.679
 seats are not for not adjusting until 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:59.450
 brewed that all well sat down 

00:00:57.679 --> 00:01:03.110
 neatly 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:03.110
 continue to cook typewriter 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.309
 here you go 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.509
 and hell sharpness 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:23.640
 Well, welded to the car I do not know how she 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:30.090
 will keep galvanizing not cooked 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:32.090
 very good here is plus here of course iron 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:38.670
 already thinned 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:42.630
 so it had to come from the old new not 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:45.270
 so you make a little brewed here 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.520
 Dot literally as began to boil 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:51.360
 the point will be brewed in the end he is a penny 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:53.850
 a whole brewed well, now we are analyzing 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:57.210
 here it should be thick iron 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.979
 handle the bottom after all so here 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.750
 I will cut a whole piece and 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:04.259
 insert day fuck poltorashki not 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.570
 less can be twos not poltorashki on and 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:09.140
 is it enough 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:12.300
 sometimes unscrew the mount to the frame 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:17.900
 here she is doing it now 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:17.900
 I twist the attachment somewhere to secure to 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:59.220
 how shorter now was just the mass 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:03:17.819
 would be better broke than learn 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:22.579
 so much popped up the news annealing 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:04:01.319
 psycho rain starts 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:04:06.680
 we shoot a year a little shorter here's a bolt 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:06.680
 body mounts shorter he replaced 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.910
 ended at all 

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:17.590
 the crow stands rotten here 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:28.820
 Itself is known that Gadget around everything there 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:32.090
 real and even pillows then no there 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:33.830
 some piece of gum is lying ok 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:36.710
 now shorter probably completely here 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:39.940
 I cut everything out and cook completely from good 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:43.580
 steel and a half 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:49.240
 completely new pocket and so be it 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:49.240
 will be safer tighter so go on like this 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.740
 choose sharpness 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:05:03.830
 so well, finally cut out a wheelbarrow with sides 

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:06.860
 here is such a side made here 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:11.600
 here a little bit does not fit now I will 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:14.630
 customize them from the likeness so that she in general 

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:16.460
 here so the hole is true a little bit 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:20.360
 it will be necessary to do more but now 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:21.950
 let's do a little bit more 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:24.740
 here will be a corner here was some 

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:26.300
 fastener semicircle such as for tape 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:27.850
 which one I don't know for what could be 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:31.820
 seat probably what that fastened 

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:35.390
 shorter deleted this fixture i need 

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:37.400
 the seat will be audi stand therefore here 

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:41.740
 this car right now and boil show 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:47.740
 as she will already sit here brewed 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:47.740
 damn present the scope of work
