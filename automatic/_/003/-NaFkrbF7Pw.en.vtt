00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
 very many people asked if I have one 

00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:04.279
 Preview games for the next month 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:06.569
 can make 

00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:08.130
 maybe in advance maybe again 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:09.480
 very briefly I will not over here 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.700
 every game is talking about it comes about 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.500
 40 50 players out this month 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.700
 but I'm off to you 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.220
 especially worth mentioning 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.900
 First of all there is a game called rain 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.609
 Rain comes for the playstation 3 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.289
 a pure download title will be and is 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.439
 a title where you with a small 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.180
 boys through rainy city ​​run the 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.769
 clou is the thing that you the 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.960
 But boys can never see because he 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.910
 invisible rain is the little one 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.950
 Only symbolize boys by that 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.079
 For example, one sees footsteps that 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.149
 the rain rattles off on him so is 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.800
 a very funny game rain demands 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.480
 but also of your head because it is one 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.219
 bad game is you and there are different 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.329
 solve the puzzle with the problem 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.489
 Game is a bit that is relative 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.079
 it is short four hours longer 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.719
 not what a download title but 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.010
 actually is back to normal 

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:54.690
 but it is more problematic that you 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.340
 this gimmick so the boy the 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.140
 invisible is that the relative 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.210
 you should get started quickly 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.800
 So decide if that's exciting 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.309
 enough to actually find this game 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.309
 to buy 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:13.610
 nothing is baked in it 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.870
 on the 8th it continues with one of the 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.490
 year highlights beyond tools I am 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:23.470
 been a huge fan of heavy rain 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.690
 david cage did that and before 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:27.340
 also fahrenheit has that now 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:29.950
 project at the start and I've already 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.610
 allowed to play and was totally out of it before 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.160
 the cottage 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.720
 after that I have to say the control 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.250
 gave me quite nicely, I fucked up 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.180
 have now heard from many colleagues 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.940
 that they said 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.770
 This control when you take the body from 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:42.580
 ellen page you play the main role 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.040
 can leave 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:47.500
 that's mega spongy that's why I am 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.390
 honestly curious if the story that 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.040
 keeps what she promises otherwise 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.110
 could that and maybe even one 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.970
 small flop are waiting there necessarily 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.590
 on the first reviews I 'll do that 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:59.020
 play the days and play with you 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.970
 of course also say how it was on 12 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.050
 october then comes the game where he 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.330
 bad most of you this 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:06.820
 month wait for pokémon xy 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:08.890
 I say so frankly I have never 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.869
 a pokémon game played for that 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.400
 But I'm really happy about it all the more 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:13.870
 more because I would have loved it too 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.180
 I have a view now 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.840
 at home and gave me that to customers 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:21.130
 is the quasi my first pokémon and 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.840
 I'm curious what I then as 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:23.800
 gonna take first starter pokémon 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.630
 and he 'll probably tell you 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.160
 who has but a bright the game I weighed 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:30.280
 not this month with the most on it 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:32.050
 regret is lego marvel super hero i am 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.730
 a great fan of lego play and me 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:34.390
 have already seen that in action on the 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.330
 gamescom 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.620
 it's bad school again I had 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.540
 actually thought that this time 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.070
 so re-enacting the story of the avengers 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.260
 But it is not the case you can 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:46.450
 in fact all marvel characters 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.120
 even cable characters take the no 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:51.100
 pig knows more than had us 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.170
 heard of that before that is short 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:54.640
 so that you can even unlock stanley 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.650
 can the then then has all 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.720
 skills so half of captain 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.190
 America etc I stand on this 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.630
 It's such an open game again 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.390
 world game with its own story 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:06.519
 That's why I already know red for me 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.260
 Thumbs up for the 3ds and the view 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:09.519
 there is a game with that probably 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.280
 no one would have expected of you with 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:13.410
 sonic blogs worlds and 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.850
 that's actually better of 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.170
 I can hear it from some sources 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:18.870
 not yet allowed to play 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.550
 actually really good and sunny 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.290
 that would be the first time since 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:24.740
 long long time that this series 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:29.520
 Sonic generations was cool again 

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:32.280
 okay and this episode to episode 4 yes 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:33.750
 unfortunately not so that would be with 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.209
 lost world finally a title again 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:38.310
 because the aggressive becomes mario 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:49.560
 I am also curious what the tests 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:53.880
 so say city ​​hesse braven freaks 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:57.000
 and then I believe the biggest title 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:59.519
 batman arkham origins this month 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.560
 I also played it honestly 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:04.650
 said the same as batman arkham 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:07.140
 asylum and beck batman arkham city but 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:09.060
 who cares the two games were 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:10.800
 pretty cool I'll take it completely open 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.910
 That's not all that many now 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.260
 will give changes on the 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:14.610
 gamescom was already there 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.459
 feature showed that a bit 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:19.260
 Looked like this backlash feature 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:21.090
 So remember me you can now 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.320
 detective mode a bit more 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:24.720
 make cooler things 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.890
 but basically it stays the same game 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.360
 I'm still looking forward to it because the 

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:29.010
 batman player has a great 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.380
 soundtrack a great mood 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:33.090
 great fighting system and that will 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:34.680
 most likely so stay on the 25th 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:36.150
 October is the time, then I do 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:38.700
 probably even the test for giger 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:40.919
 So look forward to it on 25 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:42.360
 comes a game for roleplay fans and 

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:43.350
 I want to put you here 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.850
 already caution 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:47.520
 I already have that about one 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:49.050
 half a year not seen but me 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:51.810
 I have already been allowed to look twice 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:53.370
 demo nikon the black eye becomes one 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:56.640
 roleplaying by the german publisher 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:58.380
 kalypso that looked so far catastrophic 

00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:01.169
 it did not work, it was one 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:02.610
 absolute back hell and who the last 

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:05.070
 title of kalypso has played 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:06.870
 thanks to that knows that is probable 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:09.510
 at least as cheap and at least that way 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:10.590
 I will break it, I know I live 

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:11.969
 me at this point far out of the 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:13.949
 window though 

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:16.379
 I have the years in which I do that 

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:18.089
 Now do not ever experience that play the 

00:05:16.379 --> 00:05:19.709
 in advance so broken that the 

00:05:18.089 --> 00:05:21.659
 That's why one got better 

00:05:19.709 --> 00:05:23.189
 haunting warning will catch you up 

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:24.479
 no case on the first day of the monitor 

00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:25.679
 Wait a minute I'll get that 

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:29.119
 Watch the game in any case and say 

00:05:25.679 --> 00:05:29.119
 I'll tell you how it is 

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:41.630
 i finally said to batman 

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:43.010
 arkham origins that's the biggest title 

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:45.200
 Of course I forgot 

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:47.450
 that assassin's creed 4 and battlefield 

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:50.270
 4 come this month, both come 

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:52.010
 on the 29th of october and to assassin's creed 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:54.139
 I think you need four as well 

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:56.240
 say little how to battlefield 4 too 

00:05:54.139 --> 00:05:58.250
 Battlefield I'll fabian these days 

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:00.320
 ask again anonymous how he because the 

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:02.600
 beta is graphically that is anyway 

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:03.889
 above all doubt and at 

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:06.860
 Assassin's creed I can say a lot 

00:06:03.889 --> 00:06:08.720
 that the normal version is correct 

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:10.730
 look really nice that the nextgen 

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:12.440
 I saw it at gamescom 

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:13.850
 but actually not that way 

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:15.860
 pretty is how it would have expected 

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:17.330
 so if you have an old console 

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:19.220
 should own there such a playstation 3 

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:21.169
 then get that quiet already now 

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:22.970
 because so big is the graphic 

00:06:21.169 --> 00:06:25.460
 Did not make a difference and this pirate 

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:28.430
 Setting, I just loved being alone 

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:30.830
 this diving mission wonderful yet no 

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:33.500
 Incidentally, the wolf has start date 

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:34.760
 month it was announced for october 

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:36.320
 whether that actually comes is not yet 

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:38.660
 Of course this is the new game by tell 

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:41.090
 tale and if you remember that 

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:43.490
 like last year the great the 

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:44.990
 Walking dead people have also done 

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:46.160
 The cube mangas will be back in 

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:47.750
 divisions come form 

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:50.240
 and probably now the end of october 

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:51.200
 you should definitely start that 

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:52.970
 then keep in mind 

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:55.490
 probably back in the psn network 

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:56.780
 or at xbox live or just at steam 

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:58.100
 I have to be and I actually have 

00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:02.000
 forget game 

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:04.280
 goodbye landfill is on 15 October and 

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.900
 already has the first reviews course 

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:07.190
 I got the version already so 

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:08.630
 At home , but honestly said 

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:10.340
 not yet able to play 

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:12.200
 but how to read any of these 

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:13.820
 the colleagues of gamestar should that one 

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:15.340
 really worthy graduation for 

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:17.750
 Be the row
