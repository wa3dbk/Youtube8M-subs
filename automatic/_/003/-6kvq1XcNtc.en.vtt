00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.930
 it was only a minute before he was 

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:07.100
 he turned 90 when mario gÃ³mez was 

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:08.840
 the second for the bayern 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:11.330
 the truth that has been a play already 

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:13.700
 we knew that I handled it that always 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:16.190
 had the health center the stick and good 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.480
 then we must also bear in mind that 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:19.730
 they also have some of players and 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.990
 the bet of Seattle on the line the 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:22.250
 last play of the game has already 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:24.650
 happened quite a few times so far 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.090
 champions but well we're not going to 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:29.660
 give him more accounts now he was already 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:32.119
 past no longer to be done is that it is 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:36.670
 important to us but good 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:38.960
 knowing that if it's like a 100 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:41.210
 we would have to do 10 to pass that 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.670
 if it's in the same story of being 21 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:46.159
 which is 00 that if we have nothing to be 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:48.979
 calm and know that we can do this 

00:00:46.159 --> 00:00:52.039
 reverse and more obviously after 

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:54.229
 a defeat is normal what the team 

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:55.819
 be a little crestfallen after the 

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:57.859
 result obviously we would have 

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:59.269
 liked to take us another result but 

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:01.069
 it is clear that the tie is still 

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:02.929
 open and we have a very factor 

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:04.909
 important to play at home with a 

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:07.430
 hobby that is going to capsize and they 're going to 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:10.670
 everything, I do not think that many decide 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:12.229
 big match a classic of europe me 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.070
 I think we were good debate 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:16.040
 very good to the team 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.479
 go also I think that they will suffer in 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.540
 the last minute 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:22.310
 sad but we also left 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:28.460
 here with a good feeling that we have 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:30.110
 marked that is the feeling of a 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.500
 stencil that broke the 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:37.979
 development of the Munich party 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:40.920
 against with a quick goal and then I 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.270
 I think we've both had chances yes 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.970
 it is true that we remove the second 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.350
 part of us have handled more the 11th and the 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.720
 final the bayern has to keep more 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.520
 for madrid I think the whole game 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.409
 we did the same 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.330
 we try to run with if you have to 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.909
 run and try to play we knew that 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:59.100
 it was going to be easy mini minichi and they 're 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.320
 semifinals that if the rule that is going to be 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.479
 a very difficult game and we try to 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.820
 do your best and it would be what you 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.850
 gave you work to be able to reverse 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:11.459
 this nobody doubts that you only need a 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.830
 goal to win the round and I think that 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:16.920
 the scenario is unique to play at home with 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:19.110
 a result that obviously as you 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:22.320
 I said I think we have been worthy 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.880
 maybe of the draw despite all the 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.530
 effort that the team has made but in 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.940
 the reality is there and we have to continue 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.510
 palante the tie is totally 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.510
 open 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.409
 in the initial goal that of ribÃ©ry with a 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:37.019
 footballer in front of him on outside 

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:39.299
 game always yes that bothers you clear 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:41.819
 then you realize they do not tell you in the 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:43.379
 rest that is that out of the game there 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:44.640
 it's true that the play stops me 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:47.879
 see the ball prevents me from seeing clearly 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:50.750
 where does the ball come from I can see a little 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:53.300
 ribÃ©ry of many legs in front of me 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:58.750
 the nearest horizon can do the 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:03:01.100
 league and well then in six days 7 we have 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:03.370
 practically all the work of a 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:06.819
 very long season 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:08.709
 and it is true that we have to press 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:10.420
 we have to train very well we have 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:12.610
 than to stop two games with the seriousness 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.230
 it deserves but well now it's true 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.970
 that after match of the champions 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.069
 a little bit remains to be channeled you have to think 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:20.860
 already on Saturday in the domestic competition 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:22.930
 in the Spanish league and he's got three 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.549
 very vital points for us the 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.920
 Saturday at 8 o'clock in the nou camp 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:28.420
 before the second classified the first 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.629
 of the five league matches that 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:33.459
 the whites are left 

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:35.200
 we have also played matches there that 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:36.280
 we played very well it has been a 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.220
 always match a tremendous rivalry 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.379
 for one and for another but we are a 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.510
 league game that we will try to win 

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:46.079
 We will try to do our best to 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:46.079
 Our interests
