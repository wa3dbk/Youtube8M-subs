00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:23.019 
released it well yeah I think this

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:24.750 
released it well yeah I think this
process<00:02:23.470> you<00:02:23.860> know<00:02:23.950> part<00:02:24.159> of<00:02:24.250> it<00:02:24.370> does<00:02:24.519> have<00:02:24.670> to

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
process you know part of it does have to

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.160 
process you know part of it does have to
be<00:02:24.790> rigorous<00:02:25.030> that<00:02:25.360> the<00:02:25.480> structure<00:02:25.840> of<00:02:25.900> it<00:02:26.019> is

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
be rigorous that the structure of it is

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:27.869 
be rigorous that the structure of it is
competition<00:02:26.709> and<00:02:27.099> there<00:02:27.190> will<00:02:27.400> be<00:02:27.430> a<00:02:27.670> winner

00:02:27.869 --> 00:02:27.879 
competition and there will be a winner

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:29.610 
competition and there will be a winner
but<00:02:27.970> along<00:02:28.390> the<00:02:28.569> way<00:02:28.599> I<00:02:28.720> think<00:02:28.959> it's<00:02:29.200> important

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
but along the way I think it's important

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.350 
but along the way I think it's important
to<00:02:29.680> remember<00:02:29.890> that<00:02:30.160> making<00:02:30.760> something<00:02:31.030> for

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
to remember that making something for

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.000 
to remember that making something for
somebody<00:02:31.510> is<00:02:31.930> an<00:02:32.049> act<00:02:32.200> of<00:02:32.290> love<00:02:32.530> and<00:02:32.799> it's<00:02:32.890> an

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
somebody is an act of love and it's an

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:34.890 
somebody is an act of love and it's an
