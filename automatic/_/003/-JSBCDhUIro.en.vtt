allowing<00:03:32.860> only<00:03:33.040> the<00:03:33.310> person<00:03:33.790> directly<00:03:34.150> in

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750

allowing only the person directly in
front<00:03:34.780> of<00:03:35.200> the<00:03:35.320> display<00:03:35.500> to<00:03:35.770> see<00:03:36.070> this<00:03:36.220> content

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:36.460 
front of the display to see this content

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:38.700 
front of the display to see this content
basically<00:03:37.360> there<00:03:37.990> would<00:03:38.080> be<00:03:38.110> a<00:03:38.230> dedicated

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:38.710 
basically there would be a dedicated

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:40.200 
basically there would be a dedicated
part<00:03:39.040> of<00:03:39.160> the<00:03:39.250> screen<00:03:39.520> that<00:03:39.700> the<00:03:39.850> user<00:03:40.000> would

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:40.210 
part of the screen that the user would

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:41.820 
part of the screen that the user would
be<00:03:40.360> able<00:03:40.570> to<00:03:40.690> touch<00:03:40.870> or<00:03:41.200> a<00:03:41.230> menu<00:03:41.560> that<00:03:41.590> they

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:41.830 
be able to touch or a menu that they

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:43.320 
be able to touch or a menu that they
could<00:03:42.010> bring<00:03:42.160> up<00:03:42.430> that<00:03:42.700> would<00:03:42.880> then<00:03:43.120> allow

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:43.330 
could bring up that would then allow

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:45.750 
could bring up that would then allow
them<00:03:43.690> to<00:03:43.900> access<00:03:43.930> the<00:03:44.560> controls<00:03:45.040> so<00:03:45.490> they<00:03:45.610> can

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
them to access the controls so they can

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.300 
them to access the controls so they can
actually<00:03:45.880> turn<00:03:46.330> it<00:03:46.510> on<00:03:46.690> or<00:03:46.930> off<00:03:46.960> and<00:03:47.500> basically

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
actually turn it on or off and basically

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.510 
actually turn it on or off and basically
a<00:03:48.430> software<00:03:49.420> switch<00:03:49.930> would<00:03:50.140> flip<00:03:50.500> on<00:03:50.710> and<00:03:50.980> then

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:51.520 
a software switch would flip on and then

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:54.060 
a software switch would flip on and then
it<00:03:51.790> would<00:03:51.910> apply<00:03:52.150> the<00:03:52.630> necessary<00:03:53.410> hardware

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:54.070 
it would apply the necessary hardware

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:56.430 
it would apply the necessary hardware
adjustments<00:03:54.790> to<00:03:55.210> actually<00:03:55.750> block<00:03:56.110> out

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440 
adjustments to actually block out

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.130 
adjustments to actually block out
different<00:03:57.340> viewing<00:03:57.760> angles<00:03:58.240> so<00:03:58.630> I<00:03:58.660> found<00:03:59.020> that

00:03:59.130 --> 00:03:59.140 
different viewing angles so I found that

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:01.110 
different viewing angles so I found that
this<00:03:59.260> is<00:03:59.440> pretty<00:03:59.800> interesting<00:04:00.190> and<00:04:00.730> it<00:04:01.000> would

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 
this is pretty interesting and it would

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.300 
this is pretty interesting and it would
really<00:04:01.420> be<00:04:01.540> a<00:04:01.660> nice<00:04:01.810> addition<00:04:01.840> to<00:04:02.530> future<00:04:03.280> I

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.310 
really be a nice addition to future I

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.160 
really be a nice addition to future I
