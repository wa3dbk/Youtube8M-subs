I'm<00:00:12.420> still<00:00:12.840> testing<00:00:13.200> this<00:00:14.540> DC<00:00:16.070> do-it-yourself

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
I'm still testing this DC do-it-yourself

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.830 
I'm still testing this DC do-it-yourself
ceiling<00:00:17.520> fan<00:00:17.760> is<00:00:18.750> running<00:00:19.170> very<00:00:19.619> well<00:00:19.740> on<00:00:20.840> USB

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
ceiling fan is running very well on USB

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.320 
ceiling fan is running very well on USB
power<00:00:22.520> especially<00:00:23.990> when<00:00:24.990> I<00:00:25.020> added<00:00:25.410> the<00:00:26.330> USB

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
power especially when I added the USB

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.630 
power especially when I added the USB
voltage<00:00:27.810> booster<00:00:29.359> it<00:00:30.440> boosts<00:00:31.440> the<00:00:31.680> voltage<00:00:32.369> to

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
voltage booster it boosts the voltage to

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.759 
voltage booster it boosts the voltage to
about<00:00:32.910> 11<00:00:33.629> volts<00:00:34.080> and<00:00:34.879> it<00:00:35.879> runs<00:00:36.170> pretty<00:00:37.170> well<00:00:37.320> I

00:00:37.759 --> 00:00:37.769 
about 11 volts and it runs pretty well I

00:00:37.769 --> 00:00:41.869 
about 11 volts and it runs pretty well I
would<00:00:38.370> say<00:00:38.580> and<00:00:39.530> I'm<00:00:40.530> still<00:00:41.129> testing<00:00:41.370> it<00:00:41.730> on

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
would say and I'm still testing it on

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.100 
would say and I'm still testing it on
solar<00:00:42.360> on<00:00:42.750> solar<00:00:43.140> power<00:00:43.970> right<00:00:44.970> now<00:00:45.600> it<00:00:45.989> is

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
solar on solar power right now it is

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.649 
solar on solar power right now it is
running<00:00:46.409> on<00:00:46.680> solar<00:00:46.949> power<00:00:47.309> I<00:00:47.790> have<00:00:48.479> the

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:48.659 
running on solar power I have the

00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:52.430 
running on solar power I have the
afternoon<00:00:49.290> Sun<00:00:49.650> and<00:00:50.870> it<00:00:51.870> was<00:00:52.080> kind<00:00:52.350> of

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
afternoon Sun and it was kind of

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.829 
afternoon Sun and it was kind of
lethargic<00:00:53.280> when<00:00:53.309> I<00:00:53.549> only<00:00:53.850> have<00:00:54.210> one<00:00:54.510> solar

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:54.839 
lethargic when I only have one solar

00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:59.990 
lethargic when I only have one solar
panel<00:00:56.210> attached<00:00:57.210> to<00:00:57.540> it<00:00:58.430> these<00:00:59.430> are<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.670> solar

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
panel attached to it these are the solar

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.380 
panel attached to it these are the solar
panels<00:01:00.540> that<00:01:00.629> I<00:01:00.750> have<00:01:01.699> this<00:01:02.699> one<00:01:02.970> is<00:01:03.180> just

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
panels that I have this one is just

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.490 
panels that I have this one is just
attached<00:01:03.960> to<00:01:04.170> a<00:01:04.710> different<00:01:05.400> setup<00:01:06.170> these<00:01:07.170> two

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
attached to a different setup these two

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.789 
attached to a different setup these two
panels<00:01:08.130> here<00:01:08.670> each<00:01:09.390> of<00:01:09.690> them<00:01:09.900> are<00:01:11.360> 0.5<00:01:12.360> amp<00:01:12.799> 5

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
panels here each of them are 0.5 amp 5

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.679 
panels here each of them are 0.5 amp 5
volt<00:01:14.159> and<00:01:16.250> two-and-a-half<00:01:17.250> watts<00:01:17.549> each<00:01:17.850> so<00:01:18.659> I

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
volt and two-and-a-half watts each so I

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:24.529 
volt and two-and-a-half watts each so I
parallel<00:01:19.560> them<00:01:19.829> together<00:01:20.130> I<00:01:22.729> guess<00:01:23.729> you<00:01:24.240> can

00:01:24.529 --> 00:01:24.539 
parallel them together I guess you can

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:33.039 
parallel them together I guess you can
have<00:01:24.719> 5<00:01:25.070> watts<00:01:27.890> altogether<00:01:29.570> but<00:01:30.570> since<00:01:30.840> I<00:01:31.310> am

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:33.049 
have 5 watts altogether but since I am

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:37.880 
have 5 watts altogether but since I am
boosting<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.170> voltage<00:01:35.240> to<00:01:36.240> about<00:01:37.049> 11<00:01:37.649> volt

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
boosting the voltage to about 11 volt

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.910 
boosting the voltage to about 11 volt
with<00:01:38.310> this<00:01:38.490> adapter<00:01:39.090> here<00:01:39.479> I<00:01:39.719> was<00:01:40.649> trying<00:01:40.770> to

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
with this adapter here I was trying to

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.179 
with this adapter here I was trying to
see<00:01:41.100> if<00:01:41.249> that<00:01:41.429> would<00:01:41.700> make<00:01:42.030> any<00:01:42.210> difference

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:43.189 
see if that would make any difference

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:46.340 
see if that would make any difference
apparently<00:01:44.189> doesn't<00:01:45.090> make<00:01:45.390> that<00:01:45.570> much<00:01:45.630> of<00:01:46.170> a

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
apparently doesn't make that much of a

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.179 
apparently doesn't make that much of a
difference<00:01:47.060> probably<00:01:48.060> because<00:01:48.509> of<00:01:48.890> a<00:01:49.890> small

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
difference probably because of a small

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.620 
difference probably because of a small
output<00:01:50.759> of<00:01:50.939> the<00:01:51.060> solar<00:01:51.299> panels<00:01:51.899> when<00:01:52.829> I<00:01:52.859> plug

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
output of the solar panels when I plug

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.690 
output of the solar panels when I plug
when<00:01:54.630> I<00:01:54.659> plug<00:01:55.079> the<00:01:55.289> USB<00:01:55.530> into<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:56.700> AC<00:01:57.030> power

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
when I plug the USB into the AC power

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:06.380 
when I plug the USB into the AC power
USB<00:01:59.700> port<00:02:00.049> it<00:02:01.049> draws<00:02:01.499> on<00:02:03.259> almost<00:02:04.640> 1<00:02:05.640> to<00:02:05.969> 2<00:02:06.210> amps

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
USB port it draws on almost 1 to 2 amps

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.990 
USB port it draws on almost 1 to 2 amps
of<00:02:06.840> power<00:02:06.869> so<00:02:07.710> it<00:02:07.979> can<00:02:09.619> move<00:02:10.619> the<00:02:11.130> fantastic

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
of power so it can move the fantastic

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.090 
of power so it can move the fantastic
because<00:02:12.210> it<00:02:12.510> runs<00:02:12.690> at<00:02:12.840> a<00:02:12.930> high<00:02:13.140> voltage<00:02:13.500> and

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
because it runs at a high voltage and

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
because it runs at a high voltage and
also<00:02:14.910> higher<00:02:15.720> amperage<00:02:16.550> but<00:02:17.550> right<00:02:17.760> now<00:02:17.940> is

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
also higher amperage but right now is

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.449 
also higher amperage but right now is
just<00:02:18.330> running<00:02:18.600> on<00:02:19.640> solar<00:02:20.640> power<00:02:21.049> at<00:02:22.049> about<00:02:22.709> 500

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
just running on solar power at about 500

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:24.090 
just running on solar power at about 500

eeee and<00:02:26.130> 11<00:02:27.130> volts<00:02:27.970> or<00:02:28.090> so<00:02:28.530> so<00:02:29.530> this<00:02:29.740> is<00:02:29.800> about

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
eeee and 11 volts or so so this is about

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.240 
eeee and 11 volts or so so this is about
the<00:02:30.400> speed<00:02:30.670> that<00:02:30.850> it<00:02:31.090> would<00:02:31.480> run<00:02:31.750> this<00:02:32.590> Deason

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
the speed that it would run this Deason

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.620 
the speed that it would run this Deason
and<00:02:34.950> when<00:02:35.950> it<00:02:36.100> is<00:02:36.220> running<00:02:36.550> in<00:02:36.970> the<00:02:37.120> afternoon

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
and when it is running in the afternoon

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:43.910 
and when it is running in the afternoon
I<00:02:37.900> just<00:02:38.230> load<00:02:38.500> the<00:02:38.740> shade<00:02:39.600> and<00:02:41.790> then<00:02:42.790> I<00:02:42.970> get<00:02:43.240> the

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
I just load the shade and then I get the

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.820 
I just load the shade and then I get the
fan<00:02:44.920> running<00:02:45.960> entirely<00:02:46.960> on<00:02:47.290> solar<00:02:47.560> power

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
fan running entirely on solar power

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:51.420 
fan running entirely on solar power
alone<00:02:48.310> for<00:02:48.550> free<00:02:49.320> at<00:02:50.320> night<00:02:50.620> of<00:02:50.800> course<00:02:51.070> and

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
alone for free at night of course and

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.650 
alone for free at night of course and
there<00:02:51.820> would<00:02:51.940> be<00:02:51.970> no<00:02:52.240> power<00:02:52.680> and<00:02:54.390> what<00:02:55.390> I<00:02:55.420> have

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
there would be no power and what I have

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.500 
there would be no power and what I have
to<00:02:55.810> do<00:02:55.990> is<00:02:56.170> just<00:02:56.380> unplug<00:02:57.310> the<00:02:57.970> pluck<00:02:58.240> and<00:02:58.480> pluck

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
to do is just unplug the pluck and pluck

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:06.750 
to do is just unplug the pluck and pluck
this<00:02:58.930> into<00:03:00.810> USB<00:03:01.810> power<00:03:02.380> port<00:03:02.800> and<00:03:03.870> then<00:03:05.760> this

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
this into USB power port and then this

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.950 
this into USB power port and then this
thing<00:03:07.030> would<00:03:07.210> run<00:03:07.420> again<00:03:08.370> I'm<00:03:09.630> pretty<00:03:10.630> happy

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:10.960 
thing would run again I'm pretty happy

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:15.600 
thing would run again I'm pretty happy
with<00:03:11.290> this<00:03:13.020> it's<00:03:14.020> very<00:03:14.290> lightweight<00:03:14.610> the

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:15.610 
with this it's very lightweight the

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:18.180 
with this it's very lightweight the
blades<00:03:15.940> are<00:03:16.210> made<00:03:16.240> of<00:03:16.710> corrugated<00:03:17.710> plastic

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
blades are made of corrugated plastic

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.500 
blades are made of corrugated plastic
and<00:03:19.860> you<00:03:20.860> see<00:03:21.040> the<00:03:21.190> zip<00:03:21.460> tied<00:03:21.760> here<00:03:22.090> what<00:03:22.360> I<00:03:22.390> did

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
and you see the zip tied here what I did

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.850 
and you see the zip tied here what I did
was<00:03:23.110> a<00:03:23.410> tie<00:03:24.100> each<00:03:24.370> end<00:03:24.670> of<00:03:25.150> the<00:03:25.600> blade<00:03:26.050> with<00:03:26.530> a

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:26.860 
was a tie each end of the blade with a

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:31.430 
was a tie each end of the blade with a
fishing<00:03:27.370> line<00:03:27.520> and<00:03:28.180> I<00:03:28.840> used<00:03:29.350> to<00:03:29.860> zip<00:03:30.730> tie<00:03:30.760> to

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
fishing line and I used to zip tie to

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.820 
fishing line and I used to zip tie to
pull<00:03:32.440> the<00:03:33.570> fishing<00:03:34.570> line<00:03:34.750> together

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:35.830 
pull the fishing line together

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:39.870 
pull the fishing line together
so<00:03:36.340> it<00:03:36.730> keeps<00:03:37.570> that<00:03:37.930> would<00:03:38.230> keep<00:03:38.380> the<00:03:39.010> fan

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:39.880 
so it keeps that would keep the fan

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:44.790 
so it keeps that would keep the fan
blade<00:03:40.270> from<00:03:40.630> sagging<00:03:42.930> so<00:03:43.930> that's<00:03:44.170> what<00:03:44.590> that

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:44.800 
blade from sagging so that's what that

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.000 
blade from sagging so that's what that
zip<00:03:45.040> tie<00:03:45.280> or<00:03:45.610> actually<00:03:46.060> that<00:03:46.240> to<00:03:46.510> zip<00:03:46.780> tie

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
zip tie or actually that to zip tie

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:53.730 
zip tie or actually that to zip tie
that's<00:03:48.010> that's<00:03:48.910> why<00:03:49.150> they're<00:03:49.390> there<00:03:49.690> so<00:03:52.740> the

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:53.740 
that's that's why they're there so the

00:03:53.740 --> 00:04:01.890 
that's that's why they're there so the
solar<00:03:54.010> fan<00:03:55.500> and<00:03:58.170> what's<00:03:59.170> next<00:03:59.820> well<00:04:00.820> the<00:04:01.600> next

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900
