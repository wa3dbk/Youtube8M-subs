00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:06.970
 hello today we are going to look at the pressure of the 

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:06.970
 tires 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:12.590
 here 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.650
 here we have several steps forward 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:18.320
 the wheel in front of the rear wheels 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:22.820
 with three baggage occupants and five 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:24.510
 occupiers and more occupies g worth in our 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.120
 stress 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.250
 three occupants and little that image 

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:32.760
 we have two with six kilos of pressure 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:35.480
 forward and two with four back we're going to 

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:35.480
 look at the rules 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.800
 the valve and we remove the plug 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:52.969
 the barometer this barometer indicates in 

00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:55.219
 psi in the red red scale and 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:57.920
 in bars that is the pressure per kilos in 

00:00:55.219 --> 00:01:00.289
 the black scale as we said in the 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:04.030
 rear wheels 

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:07.939
 we have two with four kilos of pressure 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:12.200
 we press the ritual rite and introduce it 

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:14.840
 in the valve is worth today we would be 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.150
 well two with three although give a little 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.490
 plus 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:21.420
 a little more 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:24.520
 there would be 2.4 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:27.000
 and there it would be fine 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:31.520
 we were the plug 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.520
 the valve and we're going to the front 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:41.810
 we are in the valve plug 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:43.830
 and we check with him 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:49.700
 manometer 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:49.700
 here would be 2 with 6 would also be worth 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.200
 we have the plug 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:04.350
 we turn off the compressor because it does not 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:04.350
 noise we put the plug 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.259
 if you want to catch 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:14.459
 and the pressure is very important that it be 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:16.040
 the right one so that you will not take the 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:18.569
 covered neither inside nor outside 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:21.260
 it is worth to another next video 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:21.260
 see you later
