00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:21.480
 the originality of the reduced to 5 is that it 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.480
 can be practiced everywhere 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:25.020
 we 

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:33.090
 five years little by little it gets bigger every 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:35.490
 year new people come 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.290
 practice and then especially what is 

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:39.270
 interesting is that it attracts a 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.320
 new audience new people 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.320
 who was already confiding in rugby 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:47.230
 big as a quality even between 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:47.770
 teams of players of different 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:49.960
 teams 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:54.000
 we enjoy meeting together 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:54.000
 we are having a party 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.790
 So I am not the head we realize 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.710
 not seriously it's really very 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:02.040
 playful like the 15 and like rugby to 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.199
 7 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:07.229
 we especially favor it is to keep a 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:12.030
 festive spirit that was missing here is the good 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.750
 snowy spirit today people 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.280
 have come disguised 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.080
 because it's my last day of 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.119
 life then offensive crashing on the 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.590
 playful at five-a-side rugby based on 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.790
 cardio also we do a lot 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.090
 many pass exercises 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.860
 quick game drills that are on 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.800
 based on the two races on a 30 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.750
 blue attacked and make 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:33.000
 quick relay hello have developed the 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.440
 the phases of game attack and after one 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.050
 do the same thing containers in defense 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:39.270
 and it's interesting that there is no 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:41.250
 contact for people who like it 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.960
 rugby lost contact 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.520
 finally if you can not find everyone 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.289
 can play you'll and have played little 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.539
 because there is no tackles and 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:51.420
 even beginners we manage to make 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:53.580
 nice things 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.229
 and what I liked was the fact of 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.299
 to make this religious is closed 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.860
 look at this spirit there compared to 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.850
 rugby is that after every tournament we 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.770
 can see them a leader on our desires 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:06.210
 who have according to continue on the buddies 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.210
 at 5 rugby 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:13.209
 when clubs have to open the 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:14.709
 door and not to consider that it is a 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:15.700
 danger for the practice 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:17.560
 traditional cad 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.360
 on the contrary it is in the village and the river 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.010
 towards other horizons towards the world of 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.900
 business 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.400
 the future in my opinion it is considerable 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.810
 if I believe the rate of growth 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.450
 we have in Ile de France compared to 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:30.010
 last season we did more 90% on 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.190
 the number of licensees there is a 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.569
 huge development 35 clubs out of 170 in 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.350
 Ile de France have developed a section 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:37.750
 rugby 5 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:39.190
 it really took so there we talk for 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.140
 the next season to double the dates 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:44.310
 to allow even more teams 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.310
 of people coming to 5
