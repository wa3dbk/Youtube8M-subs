00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
know it's a 10 amps although what I

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.050 
know it's a 10 amps although what I
liked<00:01:52.650> about<00:01:52.740> it<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.160> most<00:01:53.370> with<00:01:53.550> the<00:01:53.640> balance

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
liked about it the most with the balance

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.940 
liked about it the most with the balance
and<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.300> control<00:01:54.690> weird<00:01:55.170> little<00:01:55.440> vibrations

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
and the control weird little vibrations

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.500 
and the control weird little vibrations
in<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.100> hand<00:01:56.370> and<00:01:56.610> it<00:01:56.910> was<00:01:56.970> just<00:01:57.120> really<00:01:57.330> easy

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:57.510 
in the hand and it was just really easy

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:59.630 
in the hand and it was just really easy
something<00:01:58.260> about<00:01:58.530> that<00:01:58.710> design<00:01:59.070> I<00:01:59.370> mean<00:01:59.490> it's

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
something about that design I mean it's

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.910 
something about that design I mean it's
just<00:01:59.700> like<00:01:59.820> really<00:02:00.360> rugged<00:02:00.810> and<00:02:01.170> compact<00:02:01.710> and

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
just like really rugged and compact and

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:02.990 
just like really rugged and compact and
it's<00:02:02.220> just<00:02:02.370> easily

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
it's just easily

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.230 
it's just easily
I<00:02:03.270> thought<00:02:04.170> yeah<00:02:04.650> it's<00:02:05.010> got<00:02:05.160> a<00:02:05.190> good<00:02:05.340> balance

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
I thought yeah it's got a good balance

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.969 
I thought yeah it's got a good balance
to<00:02:06.360> it<00:02:06.630> you<00:02:06.810> know<00:02:06.930> it's<00:02:07.320> only<00:02:07.410> six<00:02:07.680> point<00:02:07.920> eight

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
to it you know it's only six point eight

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.400 
to it you know it's only six point eight
pounds<00:02:08.490> the<00:02:09.240> vibrations<00:02:09.840> when<00:02:09.990> I<00:02:10.080> was<00:02:10.200> cutting

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
pounds the vibrations when I was cutting

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.140 
pounds the vibrations when I was cutting
through<00:02:10.530> is<00:02:10.860> uh<00:02:12.320> effective<00:02:13.880> but<00:02:14.880> I'll<00:02:14.970> cut

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
through is uh effective but I'll cut

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.000 
through is uh effective but I'll cut
through<00:02:15.240> the<00:02:15.360> work<00:02:15.510> print<00:02:15.750> the<00:02:16.110> vibrations<00:02:16.770> I

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
through the work print the vibrations I

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.220 
through the work print the vibrations I
mean<00:02:17.250> there<00:02:17.430> I<00:02:17.730> mean<00:02:18.330> you<00:02:18.360> can<00:02:18.510> obviously<00:02:18.840> feel

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
mean there I mean you can obviously feel

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:20.510 
mean there I mean you can obviously feel
them<00:02:19.440> but<00:02:19.560> it's<00:02:19.740> not<00:02:19.890> like<00:02:20.040> some<00:02:20.190> of<00:02:20.220> the<00:02:20.340> other

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520

reciprocate<00:02:21.500> it's<00:02:22.500> a<00:02:22.590> 10<00:02:22.800> amp<00:02:22.980> so<00:02:23.190> it's<00:02:23.340> not<00:02:23.430> 15

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
reciprocate it's a 10 amp so it's not 15

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.580 
reciprocate it's a 10 amp so it's not 15
amps<00:02:24.209> also<00:02:24.720> you're<00:02:24.810> not<00:02:24.930> even<00:02:25.140> tearing<00:02:25.410> down<00:02:25.530> a

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
amps also you're not even tearing down a
