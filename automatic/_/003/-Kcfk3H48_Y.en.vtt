i<00:07:42.630> think<00:07:42.870> i<00:07:43.580> reckon<00:07:44.580> of<00:07:44.760> all<00:07:44.880> the<00:07:45.030> ones<00:07:45.210> i

00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:45.360 
i think i reckon of all the ones i

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:47.210 
i think i reckon of all the ones i
played

00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:47.220 
played

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:49.490 
played
on<00:07:47.280> the<00:07:47.730> sauce<00:07:47.940> a<00:07:48.150> go<00:07:48.210> at<00:07:48.420> least<00:07:48.600> I<00:07:49.080> think<00:07:49.410> this

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:49.500 
on the sauce a go at least I think this

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:51.620 
on the sauce a go at least I think this
game<00:07:49.740> had<00:07:49.920> more<00:07:50.160> potential<00:07:51.120> than<00:07:51.180> a<00:07:51.390> lot<00:07:51.540> of

00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:51.630
