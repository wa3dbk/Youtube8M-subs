extremist Iron Man figure which is right
over<00:03:34.410> here<00:03:35.150> and<00:03:36.150> um<00:03:36.299> it's<00:03:37.049> very<00:03:37.319> evident<00:03:37.799> that

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
over here and um it's very evident that

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:39.680 
over here and um it's very evident that
these<00:03:38.340> are<00:03:38.489> both<00:03:38.579> repaints<00:03:39.239> of<00:03:39.389> each<00:03:39.510> other

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
these are both repaints of each other

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:43.159 
these are both repaints of each other
with<00:03:40.200> them<00:03:40.819> he's<00:03:41.819> got<00:03:42.060> the<00:03:42.239> triangle<00:03:42.989> arc

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:43.169 
with them he's got the triangle arc

00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:46.819 
with them he's got the triangle arc
reactor<00:03:43.590> while<00:03:43.769> Norma<00:03:44.099> has<00:03:44.250> the<00:03:44.400> star<00:03:45.829> well

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:46.829 
reactor while Norma has the star well

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:51.860 
reactor while Norma has the star well
honestly<00:03:47.480> these<00:03:48.480> two<00:03:48.660> figures<00:03:49.069> are<00:03:50.150> very<00:03:51.150> much

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
honestly these two figures are very much

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.830 
honestly these two figures are very much
different<00:03:52.530> for<00:03:52.620> me<00:03:52.739> um<00:03:53.030> I<00:03:54.030> think<00:03:54.510> that<00:03:54.690> the

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
different for me um I think that the

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.420 
different for me um I think that the
repaint<00:03:55.260> is<00:03:55.379> no<00:03:55.500> big<00:03:55.680> deal<00:03:55.799> and<00:03:56.010> I<00:03:56.069> think<00:03:56.310> the

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
repaint is no big deal and I think the

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.580 
repaint is no big deal and I think the
iron<00:03:56.819> patriot<00:03:57.209> I'd<00:03:57.840> actually<00:03:58.109> say<00:03:58.260> he<00:03:58.470> has<00:03:58.560> a

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
iron patriot I'd actually say he has a

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.170 
iron patriot I'd actually say he has a
much<00:03:58.769> better<00:03:58.980> presentation<00:03:59.579> that<00:03:59.669> extremist

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
much better presentation that extremist

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.360 
much better presentation that extremist
iron<00:04:00.389> man<00:04:00.569> on<00:04:00.750> I<00:04:00.989> just<00:04:01.859> think<00:04:02.010> the<00:04:02.069> paint

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
iron man on I just think the paint

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:05.000 
iron man on I just think the paint
really<00:04:02.579> makes<00:04:02.760> them<00:04:02.910> stand<00:04:03.090> out<00:04:03.620> so<00:04:04.620> with<00:04:04.859> that

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
really makes them stand out so with that

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:06.559 
really makes them stand out so with that
being<00:04:05.220> said<00:04:05.340> let's<00:04:05.730> actually<00:04:05.849> go<00:04:06.150> on<00:04:06.269> to<00:04:06.389> them

00:04:06.559 --> 00:04:06.569 
being said let's actually go on to them

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:09.439 
being said let's actually go on to them
