a<00:00:37.850> good<00:00:37.940> idea<00:00:38.000> right<00:00:38.570> well<00:00:38.809> you<00:00:39.140> have<00:00:39.170> to<00:00:39.320> be

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:39.440 
a good idea right well you have to be

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.049 
a good idea right well you have to be
skeptical<00:00:39.739> of<00:00:39.920> any<00:00:40.100> two-for-one<00:00:40.640> medical

00:00:41.049 --> 00:00:41.059 
skeptical of any two-for-one medical

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:42.580 
skeptical of any two-for-one medical
procedures<00:00:41.480> you<00:00:41.570> start<00:00:41.840> out<00:00:41.989> but<00:00:42.440> basically

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:42.590 
procedures you start out but basically

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:44.920 
procedures you start out but basically
it<00:00:43.070> raises<00:00:43.460> several<00:00:43.670> concerns<00:00:44.210> the<00:00:44.510> first<00:00:44.660> of

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:44.930 
it raises several concerns the first of

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.200 
it raises several concerns the first of
which<00:00:45.050> fat<00:00:45.410> may<00:00:45.620> reabsorb<00:00:46.309> so<00:00:46.850> you<00:00:46.910> may<00:00:47.149> be

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.210 
which fat may reabsorb so you may be

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.389 
which fat may reabsorb so you may be
left<00:00:47.480> without<00:00:47.600> a<00:00:47.840> result<00:00:48.559> two<00:00:48.860> or<00:00:48.980> three<00:00:49.190> years

00:00:49.389 --> 00:00:49.399 
left without a result two or three years

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:51.700 
left without a result two or three years
later<00:00:49.460> but<00:00:50.149> the<00:00:50.270> most<00:00:50.480> concerning<00:00:51.020> factor<00:00:51.350> is

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710 
later but the most concerning factor is

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.440 
later but the most concerning factor is
we<00:00:52.100> don't<00:00:52.250> have<00:00:52.370> any<00:00:52.489> long<00:00:52.879> term<00:00:53.120> clinical

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:53.450 
we don't have any long term clinical

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:55.959 
we don't have any long term clinical
trials<00:00:54.079> to<00:00:54.230> show<00:00:54.410> that<00:00:54.590> fat<00:00:55.250> injected<00:00:55.670> into

00:00:55.959 --> 00:00:55.969 
trials to show that fat injected into

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:58.029 
trials to show that fat injected into
the<00:00:56.059> breast<00:00:56.329> doesn't<00:00:56.809> hinder<00:00:57.050> or<00:00:57.379> mimic<00:00:57.710> the

00:00:58.029 --> 00:00:58.039 
the breast doesn't hinder or mimic the

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:00.639 
the breast doesn't hinder or mimic the
detection<00:00:58.399> of<00:00:58.789> breast<00:00:58.850> cancer<00:00:59.719> sure<00:01:00.200> okay<00:01:00.469> and

00:01:00.639 --> 00:01:00.649 
detection of breast cancer sure okay and

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:01.540 
detection of breast cancer sure okay and
that<00:01:00.739> would<00:01:00.860> be<00:01:00.980> of<00:01:01.070> course<00:01:01.250> extremely

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:01.550 
that would be of course extremely

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:02.979 
that would be of course extremely
important<00:01:02.120> obviously<00:01:02.270> because<00:01:02.780> you<00:01:02.870> would

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:02.989 
important obviously because you would

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:04.749 
important obviously because you would
never<00:01:03.170> want<00:01:03.500> to<00:01:03.559> do<00:01:03.680> a<00:01:03.710> medical<00:01:04.070> procedure<00:01:04.339> for

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979 
any reason that would then lead you to

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:08.290

four<00:01:42.170> or<00:01:42.259> five<00:01:42.410> years<00:01:42.590> but<00:01:42.740> they<00:01:42.860> need<00:01:43.009> to

00:01:43.029 --> 00:01:43.039 
four or five years but they need to

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:44.559 
four or five years but they need to
publish<00:01:43.490> their<00:01:43.759> research<00:01:44.179> and<00:01:44.330> peer-reviewed

publish their research and peer-reviewed

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:46.990 
publish their research and peer-reviewed
literature<00:01:45.050> too<00:01:45.830> and<00:01:46.220> they<00:01:46.369> have<00:01:46.550> to<00:01:46.700> have

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
literature too and they have to have

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.300 
literature too and they have to have
multi-centered<00:01:47.660> studies<00:01:48.020> not<00:01:48.170> just<00:01:48.310> one

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
multi-centered studies not just one

good<00:01:53.810> after<00:01:53.989> one<00:01:54.289> year<00:01:54.590> you<00:01:54.860> started<00:01:55.130> out<00:01:55.220> by

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
good after one year you started out by

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.889 
good after one year you started out by
saying<00:01:55.580> that<00:01:55.789> the<00:01:55.880> two-for-one<00:01:56.330> is<00:01:56.690> not

00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:56.899 
saying that the two-for-one is not

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:58.449 
saying that the two-for-one is not
always<00:01:57.080> a<00:01:57.229> good<00:01:57.349> deal<00:01:57.830> but<00:01:58.009> there's<00:01:58.190> a<00:01:58.250> lot<00:01:58.369> of

00:01:58.449 --> 00:01:58.459 
always a good deal but there's a lot of

00:01:58.459 --> 00:02:00.370 
always a good deal but there's a lot of

would say well wow I can get rid of the

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:04.240 
would say well wow I can get rid of the
fat<00:02:02.119> here<00:02:02.569> and<00:02:02.780> I<00:02:03.170> well<00:02:03.500> why<00:02:03.619> not<00:02:03.649> I<00:02:03.860> mean<00:02:04.220> I

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
fat here and I well why not I mean I

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:05.620 
fat here and I well why not I mean I
don't<00:02:04.489> want<00:02:04.700> to<00:02:04.729> do<00:02:04.819> implants<00:02:05.300> but<00:02:05.450> that

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
don't want to do implants but that

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.449 
don't want to do implants but that
sounds<00:02:05.869> like<00:02:05.929> maybe<00:02:06.319> a<00:02:06.500> good<00:02:06.679> idea<00:02:07.039> well<00:02:07.340> it

00:02:07.449 --> 00:02:07.459 
sounds like maybe a good idea well it

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:09.249 
sounds like maybe a good idea well it
sounds<00:02:07.729> great<00:02:07.940> at<00:02:08.270> face<00:02:08.509> value<00:02:08.539> it<00:02:08.989> sounds

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
sounds great at face value it sounds

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.350 
sounds great at face value it sounds
wonderful<00:02:09.440> but<00:02:10.250> the<00:02:10.340> problem<00:02:10.700> is<00:02:10.880> is<00:02:11.060> we<00:02:11.209> are

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
wonderful but the problem is is we are

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.660 
wonderful but the problem is is we are
taking<00:02:11.720> only<00:02:11.870> a<00:02:11.989> small<00:02:12.380> amount<00:02:12.410> of<00:02:12.770> fat<00:02:13.069> we<00:02:13.489> can

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
taking only a small amount of fat we can

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.550 
taking only a small amount of fat we can
only<00:02:13.819> increase<00:02:14.239> a<00:02:14.510> cup<00:02:14.810> size<00:02:15.049> with<00:02:15.349> fat

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
only increase a cup size with fat

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.920 
only increase a cup size with fat
injections<00:02:16.159> and<00:02:16.340> so<00:02:16.879> basically<00:02:17.329> it's<00:02:17.569> a<00:02:17.659> very

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
injections and so basically it's a very

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:18.340 
injections and so basically it's a very
long

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350 
long

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:19.780 
long
procedure<00:02:18.680> that<00:02:18.980> people<00:02:19.370> are<00:02:19.460> doing<00:02:19.580> this

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
procedure that people are doing this

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.160 
procedure that people are doing this
over<00:02:20.000> six<00:02:20.330> or<00:02:20.480> eight<00:02:20.600> hours<00:02:20.930> in<00:02:21.080> the<00:02:21.140> operating

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
over six or eight hours in the operating

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.680 
over six or eight hours in the operating
room<00:02:21.830> which<00:02:22.340> can<00:02:22.760> increase<00:02:23.210> the<00:02:23.390> risk<00:02:23.510> of

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
room which can increase the risk of

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.350 
room which can increase the risk of
complications<00:02:24.410> from<00:02:24.560> anesthesia<00:02:24.950> is<00:02:25.820> the<00:02:26.120> fat

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
complications from anesthesia is the fat

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.690 
complications from anesthesia is the fat
in<00:02:26.570> your<00:02:26.600> body<00:02:26.840> is<00:02:27.410> it<00:02:27.620> like<00:02:27.770> a<00:02:27.800> stuffing<00:02:28.370> in<00:02:28.610> a

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
in your body is it like a stuffing in a

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.640 
in your body is it like a stuffing in a
doll<00:02:28.940> can<00:02:29.210> you<00:02:29.300> take<00:02:29.510> it<00:02:29.630> out<00:02:29.720> of<00:02:29.750> one<00:02:29.990> part<00:02:30.350> and

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
doll can you take it out of one part and

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.710 
doll can you take it out of one part and
put<00:02:30.980> it<00:02:31.100> in<00:02:31.220> another<00:02:31.520> without<00:02:31.820> complication

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
put it in another without complication

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.050 
put it in another without complication
you<00:02:33.140> can<00:02:33.350> you<00:02:33.590> can<00:02:33.740> take<00:02:33.890> it<00:02:34.070> out<00:02:34.160> of<00:02:34.190> one<00:02:34.490> place

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
you can you can take it out of one place

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.460 
you can you can take it out of one place
and<00:02:35.420> put<00:02:35.540> it<00:02:35.630> in<00:02:35.750> another<00:02:35.810> but<00:02:36.140> it's<00:02:36.290> very

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
and put it in another but it's very

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.500 
and put it in another but it's very
technique<00:02:37.040> dependent<00:02:37.700> meaning<00:02:38.000> we<00:02:38.360> have

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
technique dependent meaning we have

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.390 
technique dependent meaning we have
refined<00:02:38.900> techniques<00:02:39.440> and<00:02:39.680> instrumentation

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
refined techniques and instrumentation

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.340 
refined techniques and instrumentation
for<00:02:40.580> this<00:02:40.730> procedure<00:02:41.120> but<00:02:41.810> it<00:02:41.900> does<00:02:42.080> involve

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
for this procedure but it does involve

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.140 
for this procedure but it does involve
taking<00:02:42.710> out<00:02:42.830> and<00:02:42.980> putting<00:02:43.160> in<00:02:43.250> small<00:02:43.610> syringes

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
taking out and putting in small syringes

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.750 
taking out and putting in small syringes
with<00:02:44.360> small<00:02:44.690> cannulas<00:02:45.470> and<00:02:45.680> then<00:02:46.190> placing<00:02:46.640> it

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
with small cannulas and then placing it

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.370 
with small cannulas and then placing it
at<00:02:46.910> multiple<00:02:47.450> sites<00:02:47.720> around<00:02:47.870> the<00:02:48.050> breast<00:02:48.290> so

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
at multiple sites around the breast so

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.410 
at multiple sites around the breast so
it<00:02:48.470> can<00:02:48.620> be<00:02:48.740> painful<00:02:49.010> to<00:02:49.460> indicate<00:02:50.240> cause

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
it can be painful to indicate cause

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.420 
it can be painful to indicate cause
distortion<00:02:50.960> and<00:02:51.110> complications<00:02:51.560> as<00:02:52.040> well<00:02:52.190> as

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
distortion and complications as well as

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.430 
distortion and complications as well as
infection<00:02:52.880> well<00:02:53.690> it's<00:02:53.810> a<00:02:53.870> fascinating<00:02:54.080> topic

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
infection well it's a fascinating topic

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:55.990 
infection well it's a fascinating topic
but<00:02:54.950> obviously<00:02:55.250> we<00:02:55.430> need<00:02:55.580> more<00:02:55.700> time<00:02:55.940> and

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
but obviously we need more time and

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.210 
but obviously we need more time and
