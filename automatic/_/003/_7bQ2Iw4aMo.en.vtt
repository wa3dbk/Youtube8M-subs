00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:33.330 

I<00:00:29.140> think<00:00:30.140> climbing<00:00:31.000> made<00:00:32.000> the<00:00:32.360> most<00:00:32.599> of<00:00:32.840> my

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:33.340 
I think climbing made the most of my

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.670 
I think climbing made the most of my
friends<00:00:34.340> is<00:00:34.550> it's<00:00:35.510> about<00:00:35.690> the<00:00:35.840> movement<00:00:36.380> over

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:36.680 
friends is it's about the movement over

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.110 
friends is it's about the movement over
the<00:00:36.860> rock<00:00:37.450> so<00:00:38.450> that<00:00:38.480> that<00:00:39.020> single<00:00:39.380> thing<00:00:39.860> of

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:40.120 
the rock so that that single thing of

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.820 
the rock so that that single thing of
actually<00:00:41.120> moving<00:00:41.600> and<00:00:41.960> flowing<00:00:42.200> over<00:00:42.710> the

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:42.830 
actually moving and flowing over the

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:45.610 
actually moving and flowing over the
rock<00:00:43.040> is<00:00:43.309> the<00:00:43.610> thing<00:00:43.820> that<00:00:44.000> we<00:00:44.150> kind<00:00:44.780> of<00:00:44.960> love

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 
rock is the thing that we kind of love

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.950 
rock is the thing that we kind of love
about<00:00:45.739> it<00:00:46.160> really<00:00:46.340> it's<00:00:46.790> like<00:00:46.879> being<00:00:47.270> in

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.960 
about it really it's like being in

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.200 
about it really it's like being in
control<00:00:48.020> but<00:00:48.920> in<00:00:49.129> what<00:00:49.520> seems<00:00:49.850> like<00:00:50.059> an

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210 
control but in what seems like an

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.119 
control but in what seems like an
out-of-control<00:00:50.840> situation<00:00:51.140> so<00:00:51.890> it's<00:00:52.010> not

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:52.129 
out-of-control situation so it's not

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:54.040 
out-of-control situation so it's not
really<00:00:52.400> in<00:00:52.489> the<00:00:52.610> adrenaline<00:00:53.150> sport<00:00:53.540> I<00:00:53.750> think

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.050 
really in the adrenaline sport I think

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.830 
really in the adrenaline sport I think
if<00:00:54.170> you<00:00:54.320> let<00:00:54.500> their<00:00:54.739> adrenaline<00:00:55.720> get<00:00:56.720> the

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:56.840 
if you let their adrenaline get the

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.100 
if you let their adrenaline get the
better<00:00:57.019> of<00:00:57.199> you<00:00:58.149> might<00:00:59.149> affect<00:00:59.540> how<00:00:59.720> you<00:00:59.780> climb

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:00.110 
better of you might affect how you climb

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:02.500 
better of you might affect how you climb
so<00:01:00.380> you've<00:01:00.500> got<00:01:00.620> to<00:01:00.739> try<00:01:01.040> and<00:01:01.100> be<00:01:01.340> cool<00:01:01.610> in<00:01:01.970> not

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 
so you've got to try and be cool in not

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.070 
so you've got to try and be cool in not
very<00:01:02.930> cool<00:01:03.140> places<00:01:03.440> that's<00:01:04.309> a<00:01:04.520> good<00:01:05.080> challenge

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.080 
very cool places that's a good challenge

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.380 
very cool places that's a good challenge
really<00:01:06.500> for<00:01:06.920> me<00:01:07.070> that's<00:01:07.250> the<00:01:07.940> thing<00:01:08.180> that<00:01:08.330> you

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 
really for me that's the thing that you

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.930 
really for me that's the thing that you
try<00:01:08.630> and<00:01:08.660> control<00:01:08.930> the<00:01:09.170> most<00:01:09.530> I<00:01:09.800> think<00:01:12.940> when

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:13.940 
try and control the most I think when

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.889 
try and control the most I think when
you<00:01:14.030> get<00:01:14.149> to<00:01:14.210> the<00:01:14.390> top<00:01:14.690> of<00:01:14.930> a<00:01:15.229> climb<00:01:16.899> it's

00:01:17.889 --> 00:01:17.899 
you get to the top of a climb it's

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:21.130 
you get to the top of a climb it's
exhilarating<00:01:18.670> in<00:01:19.670> that<00:01:19.940> you've<00:01:20.090> done<00:01:20.300> it<00:01:20.509> all

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
exhilarating in that you've done it all

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.620 
exhilarating in that you've done it all
so<00:01:21.440> you<00:01:21.470> need<00:01:21.920> to<00:01:22.130> with<00:01:22.640> rock<00:01:22.880> climbing<00:01:22.910> anyway

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
so you need to with rock climbing anyway

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.540 
so you need to with rock climbing anyway
as<00:01:23.869> opposed<00:01:24.170> to<00:01:24.259> mountaineering<00:01:24.860> you<00:01:25.160> want<00:01:25.460> to

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:25.550 
as opposed to mountaineering you want to

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:27.279 
as opposed to mountaineering you want to
get<00:01:25.670> back<00:01:25.850> down<00:01:26.030> and<00:01:26.060> do<00:01:26.330> another<00:01:26.570> room<00:01:26.810> so<00:01:27.170> the

00:01:27.279 --> 00:01:27.289 
get back down and do another room so the

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:29.590 
get back down and do another room so the
thing<00:01:27.470> you're<00:01:27.680> doing<00:01:27.710> between<00:01:28.450> getting<00:01:29.450> to

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
thing you're doing between getting to

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.070 
thing you're doing between getting to
the<00:01:29.750> top<00:01:29.990> is<00:01:30.729> is<00:01:31.729> almost<00:01:32.119> more<00:01:32.360> important<00:01:32.929> than

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:33.080 
the top is is almost more important than

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.160 
the top is is almost more important than
getting<00:01:33.410> to<00:01:33.440> the<00:01:33.679> top<00:01:34.509> when<00:01:35.509> you've<00:01:35.720> done

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
getting to the top when you've done

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.020 
getting to the top when you've done
something<00:01:36.229> particularly<00:01:37.100> harrowing<00:01:37.550> it's

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
something particularly harrowing it's

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.230 
something particularly harrowing it's
it's<00:01:39.020> a<00:01:39.170> good<00:01:39.319> feeling<00:01:39.590> not<00:01:40.459> in<00:01:40.610> a<00:01:40.670> life-death

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
it's a good feeling not in a life-death

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.050 
it's a good feeling not in a life-death
way<00:01:41.630> to<00:01:41.690> register<00:01:42.349> just<00:01:42.759> gray<00:01:43.759> really

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
way to register just gray really

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.070 
way to register just gray really
occasionally<00:01:45.050> you<00:01:45.170> fall<00:01:46.030> but<00:01:47.030> a<00:01:47.300> lot<00:01:47.929> of<00:01:47.959> the

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:48.080 
occasionally you fall but a lot of the

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.529 
occasionally you fall but a lot of the
routes<00:01:48.289> are<00:01:48.649> fairly<00:01:49.340> well<00:01:49.459> protected<00:01:49.640> unless

00:01:50.529 --> 00:01:50.539 
routes are fairly well protected unless

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:53.699 
routes are fairly well protected unless
you<00:01:50.800> be<00:01:51.800> pushing<00:01:52.039> your<00:01:52.310> grades<00:01:52.640> and<00:01:52.970> then<00:01:53.149> you

00:01:53.699 --> 00:01:53.709 
you be pushing your grades and then you

00:01:53.709 --> 00:01:56.230 
you be pushing your grades and then you
then<00:01:54.709> you<00:01:54.830> get<00:01:54.950> into<00:01:55.160> the<00:01:55.310> realms<00:01:55.640> of<00:01:55.789> taking

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
then you get into the realms of taking

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.779 
then you get into the realms of taking
big<00:01:56.450> Falls<00:01:56.950> I've<00:01:57.950> heard<00:01:58.160> myself<00:01:58.340> more<00:01:58.729> in

00:01:58.779 --> 00:01:58.789 
big Falls I've heard myself more in

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:00.760 
big Falls I've heard myself more in
climbing<00:01:59.360> walls<00:01:59.599> really<00:01:59.990> just<00:02:00.229> falling<00:02:00.560> down

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
climbing walls really just falling down

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.969 
climbing walls really just falling down
and<00:02:01.190> dislocating<00:02:02.119> ankles<00:02:02.750> and<00:02:02.990> things<00:02:03.200> it's

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
and dislocating ankles and things it's

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:05.620 
and dislocating ankles and things it's
not<00:02:04.160> really<00:02:04.459> a<00:02:04.490> hobby<00:02:04.670> it's<00:02:05.030> more<00:02:05.179> of<00:02:05.270> a<00:02:05.330> way<00:02:05.479> of

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
not really a hobby it's more of a way of

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.040 
not really a hobby it's more of a way of
life<00:02:05.840> it's<00:02:06.470> there<00:02:07.360> it's<00:02:08.360> great<00:02:08.660> there's<00:02:08.929> no

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
life it's there it's great there's no

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:10.960 
life it's there it's great there's no
rules<00:02:09.319> you<00:02:09.500> do<00:02:09.830> what<00:02:09.950> you<00:02:10.039> like<00:02:10.190> and<00:02:10.550> it's<00:02:10.700> just
