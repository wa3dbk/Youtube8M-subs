00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.670 

okay<00:00:00.240> we're<00:00:00.420> down<00:00:00.570> in<00:00:00.599> the<00:00:00.870> in<00:00:01.079> the<00:00:01.199> basement

00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:01.680 
okay we're down in the in the basement

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.460 
okay we're down in the in the basement
and<00:00:02.240> we're<00:00:03.240> actually<00:00:03.419> in<00:00:03.689> one<00:00:03.899> of<00:00:03.929> the<00:00:04.080> little

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:04.470 
and we're actually in one of the little

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.110 
and we're actually in one of the little
rooms<00:00:04.680> in<00:00:04.859> the<00:00:04.980> back<00:00:05.160> and<00:00:05.520> we<00:00:05.609> can<00:00:05.640> see<00:00:05.940> the

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
rooms in the back and we can see the

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.270 
rooms in the back and we can see the
wall<00:00:06.330> up<00:00:06.600> here<00:00:06.899> has<00:00:07.440> no<00:00:07.680> insulation<00:00:07.980> on<00:00:08.460> it<00:00:10.280> so

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
wall up here has no insulation on it so

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.100 
wall up here has no insulation on it so
there's<00:00:12.030> a<00:00:12.090> lot<00:00:12.240> of<00:00:12.389> different<00:00:12.690> options<00:00:12.840> for

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
there's a lot of different options for

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.049 
there's a lot of different options for
there<00:00:13.410> I<00:00:13.440> think<00:00:13.740> some<00:00:14.130> kind<00:00:14.370> of<00:00:14.460> a<00:00:14.549> styrofoam

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
there I think some kind of a styrofoam

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.189 
there I think some kind of a styrofoam
insulation<00:00:16.130> would<00:00:17.130> be<00:00:17.580> good<00:00:17.840> the<00:00:18.840> fiberglass

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
insulation would be good the fiberglass

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.980 
insulation would be good the fiberglass
insulation<00:00:20.119> like<00:00:21.119> you<00:00:21.240> see<00:00:21.420> up<00:00:21.570> in<00:00:21.720> the<00:00:21.750> rim

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
insulation like you see up in the rim

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.910 
insulation like you see up in the rim
joist<00:00:22.350> here<00:00:23.000> that's<00:00:24.000> all<00:00:24.210> done<00:00:24.449> but<00:00:24.750> that<00:00:25.019> can

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
joist here that's all done but that can

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.560 
joist here that's all done but that can
cause<00:00:26.189> some<00:00:26.460> problems<00:00:26.939> with<00:00:27.090> moisture<00:00:27.269> you

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
cause some problems with moisture you

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.900 
cause some problems with moisture you
know<00:00:27.660> if<00:00:27.960> you're<00:00:28.140> in<00:00:28.230> a<00:00:28.289> wet<00:00:28.500> environment<00:00:28.910> you

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
know if you're in a wet environment you

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.339 
know if you're in a wet environment you
want<00:00:30.029> to<00:00:30.150> be<00:00:30.300> real<00:00:30.480> careful<00:00:30.779> with<00:00:31.019> that<00:00:31.140> stuff

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
want to be real careful with that stuff

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.010 
want to be real careful with that stuff
so<00:00:31.769> the<00:00:32.520> fiberglass<00:00:32.880> will<00:00:33.270> work<00:00:33.540> but<00:00:33.809> just

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
so the fiberglass will work but just

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.840 
so the fiberglass will work but just
make<00:00:34.710> sure<00:00:34.890> that<00:00:34.920> it's<00:00:35.280> it's<00:00:35.460> a<00:00:35.579> dry

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
make sure that it's it's a dry

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.080 
make sure that it's it's a dry
environment<00:00:36.440> the<00:00:37.440> other<00:00:37.590> thing<00:00:37.890> this<00:00:38.090> this

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
environment the other thing this this

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.420 
environment the other thing this this
little<00:00:39.300> room<00:00:39.600> here<00:00:39.870> also<00:00:40.770> is<00:00:40.920> connected<00:00:41.399> to

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
little room here also is connected to

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.100 
little room here also is connected to
the<00:00:41.579> bathroom<00:00:42.030> and<00:00:42.149> there's<00:00:42.300> a<00:00:42.360> big<00:00:42.540> gap<00:00:42.570> in

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
the bathroom and there's a big gap in

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.279 
the bathroom and there's a big gap in
there<00:00:44.059> which<00:00:45.059> is<00:00:45.090> gonna<00:00:45.390> allow<00:00:45.690> moisture<00:00:45.930> from

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
there which is gonna allow moisture from

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.270 
there which is gonna allow moisture from
the<00:00:46.440> bathroom<00:00:46.950> to<00:00:47.820> get<00:00:47.969> into<00:00:48.270> this<00:00:48.390> area<00:00:48.840> and

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:49.280 
the bathroom to get into this area and

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.700 
the bathroom to get into this area and
it's<00:00:50.300> probably<00:00:51.300> since<00:00:51.539> it's<00:00:51.780> isolated<00:00:52.440> from

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
it's probably since it's isolated from

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.439 
it's probably since it's isolated from
the<00:00:52.829> heating<00:00:53.129> system<00:00:53.579> it's<00:00:54.059> going<00:00:54.210> to<00:00:54.329> be

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
the heating system it's going to be

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.660 
the heating system it's going to be
colder<00:00:54.870> in<00:00:54.989> this<00:00:55.140> area<00:00:55.500> and<00:00:55.739> it's<00:00:56.219> gonna<00:00:56.370> cause

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
colder in this area and it's gonna cause

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.779 
colder in this area and it's gonna cause
condensation<00:00:57.600> so<00:00:57.780> that<00:00:58.739> that's<00:00:59.309> not<00:00:59.520> a<00:00:59.579> good

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
condensation so that that's not a good

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.130 
condensation so that that's not a good
thing<00:01:00.000> either<00:01:00.149> that<00:01:00.390> should<00:01:00.570> be<00:01:00.660> sealed<00:01:00.960> up

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
thing either that should be sealed up

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.380 
thing either that should be sealed up
it's<00:01:01.949> lady<00:01:02.190> basements<00:01:02.699> it's<00:01:02.820> such<00:01:02.969> a<00:01:03.000> big<00:01:03.210> area

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
it's lady basements it's such a big area

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.090 
it's lady basements it's such a big area
for<00:01:03.510> heat<00:01:03.750> loss<00:01:03.960> we<00:01:04.530> wanted<00:01:04.739> to<00:01:04.799> come<00:01:04.949> outside

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
for heat loss we wanted to come outside

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.740 
for heat loss we wanted to come outside
on<00:01:05.489> a<00:01:05.519> different<00:01:05.880> house<00:01:05.970> and<00:01:06.210> point<00:01:06.390> out<00:01:06.479> a<00:01:06.510> few

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
on a different house and point out a few

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.750 
on a different house and point out a few
things<00:01:06.930> about<00:01:07.250> insulating<00:01:08.250> basements<00:01:08.670> this

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
things about insulating basements this

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.420 
things about insulating basements this
might<00:01:08.970> be<00:01:09.119> noticeable<00:01:09.920> on<00:01:10.920> this<00:01:11.100> house<00:01:11.280> you

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
might be noticeable on this house you

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.010 
might be noticeable on this house you
can<00:01:11.580> see<00:01:11.790> where<00:01:11.909> they've<00:01:12.030> actually<00:01:12.060> taken<00:01:12.570> a

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
can see where they've actually taken a

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.870 
can see where they've actually taken a
half<00:01:13.350> inch<00:01:13.590> of<00:01:13.770> rigid<00:01:14.100> insulation<00:01:14.340> and

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
half inch of rigid insulation and

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.789 
half inch of rigid insulation and
covered<00:01:15.479> up<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.659> concrete<00:01:16.049> foundation<00:01:16.619> try

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
covered up the concrete foundation try

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.140 
covered up the concrete foundation try
to<00:01:16.860> keep<00:01:17.070> some<00:01:17.250> of<00:01:17.280> that<00:01:17.369> heat<00:01:17.610> inside<00:01:18.030> the

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
to keep some of that heat inside the

to keep some of that heat inside the
house<00:01:18.590> basements<00:01:19.590> are<00:01:20.040> a<00:01:20.100> huge<00:01:20.520> area<00:01:20.759> for<00:01:20.909> heat

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
house basements are a huge area for heat

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.910 
house basements are a huge area for heat
loss<00:01:21.240> because<00:01:21.750> concrete<00:01:22.229> walls<00:01:22.409> are

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
loss because concrete walls are

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.890 
loss because concrete walls are
extremely<00:01:23.460> inefficient<00:01:23.640> it's<00:01:24.119> keeping<00:01:24.659> heat

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
extremely inefficient it's keeping heat

here's<00:01:37.020> they<00:01:37.170> occurred<00:01:37.350> it<00:01:37.500> with<00:01:37.619> concrete

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
here's they occurred it with concrete

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.429 
here's they occurred it with concrete
type<00:01:39.030> of<00:01:39.150> materials<00:01:39.689> so<00:01:39.840> you<00:01:39.869> can't<00:01:40.200> see<00:01:40.350> the

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
type of materials so you can't see the

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:41.810 
type of materials so you can't see the
rigid<00:01:40.710> insulation<00:01:40.950> and<00:01:41.340> it<00:01:41.460> doesn't<00:01:41.729> break

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
rigid insulation and it doesn't break

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.639 
rigid insulation and it doesn't break
down<00:01:42.030> but<00:01:42.600> over<00:01:42.750> time<00:01:43.049> you<00:01:43.229> can<00:01:43.380> see<00:01:43.530> where

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
down but over time you can see where

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.679 
down but over time you can see where
this<00:01:43.740> insulation<00:01:44.729> is<00:01:45.000> settled<00:01:45.329> because<00:01:45.570> they

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
this insulation is settled because they

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.330 
this insulation is settled because they
only<00:01:45.810> have<00:01:46.020> it<00:01:46.140> right<00:01:46.259> below<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:46.680> surface<00:01:47.070> of

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
only have it right below the surface of

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.069 
only have it right below the surface of
the<00:01:47.399> ground<00:01:47.549> so<00:01:48.329> it's<00:01:48.450> some<00:01:48.630> of<00:01:48.720> them<00:01:48.869> that

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
the ground so it's some of them that

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.810 
the ground so it's some of them that
there's<00:01:49.320> this<00:01:49.680> is<00:01:49.860> an<00:01:49.950> obvious<00:01:50.100> area<00:01:50.549> for<00:01:50.729> heat

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
there's this is an obvious area for heat

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:51.929 
there's this is an obvious area for heat
loss<00:01:50.880> here

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:51.939 
loss here

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:53.520 
loss here
and<00:01:52.119> if<00:01:52.299> we<00:01:52.420> step<00:01:52.659> back<00:01:52.689> a<00:01:52.869> bit<00:01:53.020> you<00:01:53.350> can<00:01:53.380> see

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
and if we step back a bit you can see

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.590 
and if we step back a bit you can see
where<00:01:53.979> this<00:01:54.340> entire<00:01:54.700> piece<00:01:55.000> has<00:01:55.210> been<00:01:55.240> lost

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:55.600 
where this entire piece has been lost

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.569 
where this entire piece has been lost
and<00:01:55.810> it's<00:01:55.930> been<00:01:56.110> good<00:01:56.259> it's<00:01:56.560> it's<00:01:57.219> no<00:01:57.430> longer

00:01:57.569 --> 00:01:57.579 
and it's been good it's it's no longer

00:01:57.579 --> 00:01:59.880 
and it's been good it's it's no longer
there<00:01:57.850> so<00:01:58.090> this<00:01:58.509> concrete<00:01:58.840> wall<00:01:59.049> here<00:01:59.380> we<00:01:59.740> can

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
there so this concrete wall here we can

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:01.200 
there so this concrete wall here we can
see<00:02:00.039> plain<00:02:00.250> as<00:02:00.430> day<00:02:00.579> with<00:02:00.759> our<00:02:00.880> infrared

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210 
see plain as day with our infrared

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.149 
see plain as day with our infrared
camera<00:02:01.600> where<00:02:02.200> this<00:02:02.320> heat<00:02:02.530> loss<00:02:02.710> is<00:02:02.920> going

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:03.159 
camera where this heat loss is going

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:04.469 
camera where this heat loss is going
right<00:02:03.340> through<00:02:03.549> this<00:02:03.670> wall<00:02:03.880> here<00:02:04.119> so<00:02:04.360> it's

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:04.479 
right through this wall here so it's

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:06.270 
right through this wall here so it's
absolutely<00:02:04.960> vital<00:02:05.590> that<00:02:05.799> we<00:02:05.950> insulate

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
absolutely vital that we insulate

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.350 
absolutely vital that we insulate
basements<00:02:06.759> properly

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
basements properly

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.089 
basements properly
we're<00:02:07.990> down<00:02:08.110> inside<00:02:08.410> the<00:02:08.500> basement<00:02:08.649> now<00:02:08.950> of

we're down inside the basement now of

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:10.139 
we're down inside the basement now of
this<00:02:09.250> house<00:02:09.399> and<00:02:09.640> we're<00:02:09.729> going<00:02:09.880> to<00:02:09.910> talk<00:02:10.119> about

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
this house and we're going to talk about

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:11.339 
this house and we're going to talk about
some<00:02:10.569> of<00:02:10.660> the<00:02:10.720> things<00:02:10.929> that<00:02:11.050> you<00:02:11.170> need<00:02:11.319> to

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:11.349 
some of the things that you need to

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:13.199 
some of the things that you need to
concentrate<00:02:12.099> on<00:02:12.190> and<00:02:12.370> you<00:02:12.519> need<00:02:12.610> to<00:02:12.730> focus<00:02:12.910> on

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:13.209 
concentrate on and you need to focus on

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:15.479 
concentrate on and you need to focus on
when<00:02:13.720> it<00:02:13.840> comes<00:02:13.989> to<00:02:14.140> looking<00:02:14.410> at<00:02:14.500> insulating

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:15.489 
when it comes to looking at insulating

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:16.949 
when it comes to looking at insulating
basement<00:02:15.880> walls<00:02:16.030> and<00:02:16.239> some<00:02:16.330> issues<00:02:16.480> that<00:02:16.690> are

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959 
basement walls and some issues that are

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:19.320 
basement walls and some issues that are
involved<00:02:17.230> with<00:02:17.440> that<00:02:17.680> the<00:02:18.310> the<00:02:18.790> big<00:02:18.940> thing<00:02:18.970> is

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
involved with that the the big thing is

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.660 
involved with that the the big thing is
moisture<00:02:19.959> health<00:02:20.500> and<00:02:20.709> safety<00:02:21.130> because<00:02:21.519> that

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
moisture health and safety because that

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:22.860 
moisture health and safety because that
moisture<00:02:22.000> can<00:02:22.150> really<00:02:22.360> affect<00:02:22.599> your<00:02:22.690> health

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
moisture can really affect your health

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.330 
moisture can really affect your health
and<00:02:22.989> safety<00:02:23.290> we<00:02:23.709> certainly<00:02:24.040> want<00:02:24.220> to<00:02:24.280> be

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
and safety we certainly want to be

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:25.890 
and safety we certainly want to be
concerned<00:02:24.700> with<00:02:24.790> the<00:02:24.940> energy<00:02:25.269> aspects<00:02:25.780> of

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
concerned with the energy aspects of

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.140 
concerned with the energy aspects of
these<00:02:26.019> basement<00:02:26.440> walls<00:02:26.590> but<00:02:27.370> health<00:02:27.970> and

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
these basement walls but health and

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.000 
these basement walls but health and
safety<00:02:28.420> always<00:02:28.569> comes<00:02:28.720> first<00:02:28.989> but<00:02:29.769> the<00:02:29.890> thing

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
safety always comes first but the thing

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:31.710 
safety always comes first but the thing
to<00:02:30.040> remember<00:02:30.160> is<00:02:30.489> that<00:02:30.700> concrete<00:02:31.569> is<00:02:31.690> a

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
to remember is that concrete is a

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.470 
to remember is that concrete is a
terrible<00:02:32.110> insulator<00:02:32.590> that<00:02:33.060> heat<00:02:34.060> can<00:02:34.269> pass

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
terrible insulator that heat can pass

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.000 
terrible insulator that heat can pass
right<00:02:34.510> through<00:02:34.810> this<00:02:35.230> and<00:02:35.470> right<00:02:35.590> out<00:02:35.739> to<00:02:35.769> your

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
right through this and right out to your

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.100 
right through this and right out to your
house<00:02:36.190> and<00:02:36.459> if<00:02:36.910> it's<00:02:37.090> not<00:02:37.180> insulated<00:02:37.690> it's

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
house and if it's not insulated it's

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:39.420 
house and if it's not insulated it's
going<00:02:38.319> to<00:02:38.380> cost<00:02:38.560> you<00:02:38.709> a<00:02:38.739> lot<00:02:38.920> of<00:02:38.980> money<00:02:39.160> a

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
going to cost you a lot of money a

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:40.860 
going to cost you a lot of money a
couple<00:02:39.970> of<00:02:40.120> different<00:02:40.360> things<00:02:40.390> to<00:02:40.660> think

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
couple of different things to think

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.509 
couple of different things to think
about<00:02:40.930> those<00:02:41.230> we<00:02:41.440> can<00:02:41.590> see<00:02:41.769> where<00:02:41.980> this

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:42.519 
about those we can see where this

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:45.210 
about those we can see where this
homeowner<00:02:42.940> has<00:02:43.420> taken<00:02:43.720> some<00:02:43.870> expanding<00:02:44.769> spray

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
homeowner has taken some expanding spray

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:46.800 
homeowner has taken some expanding spray
foam<00:02:45.430> insulation<00:02:45.459> obviously<00:02:46.390> they<00:02:46.480> had<00:02:46.660> some

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
foam insulation obviously they had some

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.240 
foam insulation obviously they had some
cracks<00:02:47.049> in<00:02:47.230> the<00:02:47.349> foundation<00:02:47.470> here<00:02:48.040> so<00:02:48.160> they

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
cracks in the foundation here so they

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:49.559 
cracks in the foundation here so they
tried<00:02:48.459> to<00:02:48.489> fill<00:02:48.730> those<00:02:48.849> up<00:02:48.910> to<00:02:49.209> try<00:02:49.360> and<00:02:49.450> keep

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:49.569 
tried to fill those up to try and keep

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:51.240 
tried to fill those up to try and keep
some<00:02:49.630> of<00:02:49.900> that<00:02:49.959> heat<00:02:50.260> in<00:02:50.410> there<00:02:50.620> but<00:02:51.160> this

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
some of that heat in there but this

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.039 
some of that heat in there but this
basement<00:02:51.730> here<00:02:52.060> this<00:02:52.540> portion<00:02:52.900> of<00:02:52.989> the

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:53.049 
basement here this portion of the

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:54.990 
basement here this portion of the
basement<00:02:53.200> it's<00:02:53.530> not<00:02:53.650> even<00:02:53.860> insulated<00:02:54.370> so<00:02:54.880> that

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
basement it's not even insulated so that

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.099 
basement it's not even insulated so that
he's<00:02:55.209> going<00:02:55.420> to<00:02:55.480> be<00:02:55.540> going<00:02:55.630> right<00:02:55.870> through<00:02:55.900> the

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:56.109 
he's going to be going right through the

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:58.530 
he's going to be going right through the
actual<00:02:56.590> solid<00:02:56.829> concrete<00:02:57.130> and<00:02:58.000> these<00:02:58.239> cracks

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
actual solid concrete and these cracks

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.449 
actual solid concrete and these cracks
are<00:02:58.750> going<00:02:58.930> to<00:02:58.989> be<00:02:59.140> a<00:02:59.350> little<00:02:59.829> you<00:03:00.160> know<00:03:00.190> a<00:03:00.280> big

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
are going to be a little you know a big

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:01.970 
are going to be a little you know a big
issue<00:03:00.609> because<00:03:00.970> it's<00:03:01.120> passing<00:03:01.510> air<00:03:01.690> through

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
issue because it's passing air through

issue because it's passing air through
the<00:03:02.980> other<00:03:03.130> thing<00:03:03.370> is<00:03:03.549> the<00:03:03.730> type<00:03:03.940> of

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
the other thing is the type of

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:05.580 
the other thing is the type of
insulation<00:03:04.540> if<00:03:04.810> you're<00:03:04.930> looking<00:03:05.200> to<00:03:05.260> insulate

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
insulation if you're looking to insulate

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.830 
insulation if you're looking to insulate
this<00:03:05.829> you<00:03:06.489> need<00:03:06.640> to<00:03:06.730> think<00:03:06.940> about<00:03:07.030> that<00:03:07.329> we

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
this you need to think about that we

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.000 
this you need to think about that we
pulled<00:03:08.079> this<00:03:08.170> piece<00:03:08.380> of<00:03:08.560> fiberglass

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
pulled this piece of fiberglass

insulation that was jammed up in this
rim<00:03:11.319> joist<00:03:11.590> here<00:03:11.859> and<00:03:12.190> you<00:03:12.340> can<00:03:12.519> see<00:03:12.730> how<00:03:13.000> dirty

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:13.269 
rim joist here and you can see how dirty

this<00:03:13.450> insulation<00:03:14.139> is<00:03:14.319> how<00:03:14.920> black<00:03:15.190> that<00:03:15.459> is

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:15.609 
this insulation is how black that is

this insulation is how black that is
fiberglass<00:03:16.540> is<00:03:16.720> a<00:03:16.810> good<00:03:16.989> insulator<00:03:17.440> but<00:03:17.650> it's

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:17.799 
fiberglass is a good insulator but it's

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:19.559

issues inside of the insulation and then

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:44.940 
issues inside of the insulation and then
if<00:03:43.150> I<00:03:43.269> cover<00:03:43.510> it<00:03:43.690> up<00:03:43.780> if<00:03:44.260> I<00:03:44.440> finish<00:03:44.799> this

if I cover it up if I finish this
basement<00:03:45.220> up<00:03:45.549> that's<00:03:46.030> creating<00:03:46.420> even<00:03:46.660> more

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
basement up that's creating even more

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:48.539 
basement up that's creating even more
problems<00:03:47.290> because<00:03:47.739> if<00:03:47.859> I<00:03:47.950> see<00:03:48.160> these<00:03:48.310> cracks

00:03:48.539 --> 00:03:48.549 
problems because if I see these cracks

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:50.640 
problems because if I see these cracks
here<00:03:48.849> I<00:03:48.880> know<00:03:49.000> moisture<00:03:49.569> is<00:03:49.780> leaking<00:03:50.500> through

here I know moisture is leaking through
these<00:03:50.829> cracks<00:03:51.040> and<00:03:51.310> I<00:03:51.370> can<00:03:51.519> see<00:03:51.700> that<00:03:51.880> in<00:03:52.000> some

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:52.209 
these cracks and I can see that in some

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:54.390 
these cracks and I can see that in some
spots<00:03:52.510> and<00:03:52.840> if<00:03:53.230> that's<00:03:53.410> covered<00:03:53.739> up<00:03:53.859> with

can't<00:03:57.430> see<00:03:57.639> those<00:03:57.790> problems<00:03:58.239> going<00:03:58.959> on<00:03:59.170> behind

00:03:59.339 --> 00:03:59.349 
can't see those problems going on behind

can't see those problems going on behind
there<00:03:59.680> the<00:04:00.280> idea<00:04:00.609> is<00:04:00.850> I<00:04:01.060> want<00:04:01.509> to<00:04:01.570> make<00:04:01.690> sure

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:01.720 
there the idea is I want to make sure

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.530 
there the idea is I want to make sure
that<00:04:02.019> any<00:04:02.259> wood<00:04:02.530> any

foundation wall are treated wood the

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.399 
foundation wall are treated wood the
other<00:04:08.010> thing<00:04:08.400> is<00:04:08.579> if<00:04:09.120> it's<00:04:09.359> something<00:04:09.689> that<00:04:09.719> is

00:04:10.399 --> 00:04:10.409 
other thing is if it's something that is

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:12.979 
other thing is if it's something that is
