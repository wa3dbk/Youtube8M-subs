00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.300 
roll them up and then you have the
mostly<00:04:25.960> but<00:04:26.169> when<00:04:26.470> it's<00:04:26.620> raining<00:04:27.010> the<00:04:27.160> rain

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
mostly but when it's raining the rain

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:30.840 
mostly but when it's raining the rain
comes<00:04:27.580> in<00:04:27.790> so<00:04:28.270> this<00:04:28.449> one<00:04:28.660> has<00:04:28.840> a<00:04:28.870> small<00:04:29.850> metal

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:30.850 
comes in so this one has a small metal

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:34.920 
comes in so this one has a small metal
part<00:04:31.590> to<00:04:32.590> keep<00:04:32.800> it<00:04:33.699> open<00:04:33.970> here<00:04:34.600> underneath

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:34.930 
part to keep it open here underneath

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:37.620 
part to keep it open here underneath
there's<00:04:35.350> a<00:04:35.380> Mosley<00:04:35.860> mesh<00:04:36.040> so<00:04:36.370> air<00:04:37.030> can<00:04:37.330> come<00:04:37.449> in

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:37.630 
there's a Mosley mesh so air can come in

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:40.800 
there's a Mosley mesh so air can come in
keeps<00:04:38.199> you<00:04:38.320> ventilated<00:04:38.979> but<00:04:39.280> if<00:04:40.150> it's<00:04:40.419> raining

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:40.810 
keeps you ventilated but if it's raining

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:45.000 
keeps you ventilated but if it's raining
the<00:04:41.229> rain<00:04:41.380> counts<00:04:41.800> enter<00:04:42.490> the<00:04:42.610> BV<00:04:43.800> so<00:04:44.800> that's

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.010 
the rain counts enter the BV so that's

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:47.940 
the rain counts enter the BV so that's
for<00:04:45.250> the<00:04:45.460> cocoon<00:04:45.729> dome
