00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.509
 hi to all ten of spacesgames I am 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.879
 dottor weiter here we are with a 9 pitt 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.619
 aldes which fun to use 

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:18.630
 today I have decided to bring you a 3 5 2 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.539
 of the major league soccer league 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.710
 american far below online we start 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.360
 immediately by the carlo goalkeeper cudicini 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.220
 old acquaintances of English football 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.529
 cudicini has a very good opinion 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.240
 suffers like all silver doors 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.790
 against gold attackers then 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.589
 be careful when dealing with gold team 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.100
 passes in the first defender defense 

00:00:34.589 --> 00:00:39.720
 marvel win first thing we notice 93 of 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.760
 speed that makes him the defender 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:43.110
 central fastest of the game i 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.879
 program this player that is little 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.430
 so another terrorist is not that great 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.870
 in defense other defender jamie are 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.809
 ship this is a real player 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.820
 complete is not in fact so slow but of the 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.649
 75 speed but a great header 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.870
 it's really good defensive values 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.210
 recommended the third and indie think 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.129
 never that a parà and bronze but it is a lot 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.199
 fast has good test values and if 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.820
 not even one meter high and 88 leaves 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.500
 really want regarding 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.330
 shooting pass before from the defender 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.770
 this but accepted by switching to 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.700
 midfield the first outside on the right e 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.259
 very fast Jamaican richards 94 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.940
 so lightning on the band has the 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.420
 tendency to centralize like the other 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:19.979
 external 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.580
 so I recommend you use it either 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:25.590
 throwing at the bottom then using a lot 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.300
 counterattack tactics or maybe 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.250
 to focus on one game more 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:31.440
 reason you are left and steve 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.590
 zakuani 87 speed therefore not 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:37.500
 so fast but still excellent values 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.880
 basic a good dribbling pecks slightly 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.410
 family both this I chose the two 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.090
 externally very offensive that states 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:44.459
 be careful that if I do you could be 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:48.630
 discovered by passing the first to the CDCs 

00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:51.119
 eric baican 64 a bronze then 84 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.619
 illicit good defensive values ​​66 that 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.709
 anyway for a ready and they are not bad 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:58.200
 still manages to behave 

00:01:55.709 --> 00:02:00.780
 very well on defense 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.069
 his companion is osvaldo alonso this 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.459
 time now a player really 

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:08.429
 exceptional it costs very little 850 credits 

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:10.080
 but really really strong 4 star end 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.060
 weak also no withdrawal cylinders 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.230
 let yourself be fooled 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:17.510
 61 excellent defensive and offensive values 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.770
 then coc landon donovan in his 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.830
 t9 season version 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:23.599
 Mons consists a lot of 65,000 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.430
 believe if you can't afford it 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:27.800
 take one beckham quietly 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.810
 Botox is also very strong as their 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.989
 a year chosen because for me it is a c 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.760
 crazy 90 in a state of shooting then 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:36.470
 a player is fast but that anyway 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.540
 manages to pull also manages to put 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.530
 in front of the attackers in front of the 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.110
 door 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.239
 Dominic strikers I hate the first 94 of 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.950
 speed a very suitable player for the 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:48.560
 speed play in fact will be enough to 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:50.420
 launch it and it will easily jump everyone 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.519
 Opponents defenders really recommended 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.920
 from the rennes mattox completes the department 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:57.739
 offensive too fast 92 of 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.930
 one meter speed and 83 never crazy 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:02.330
 elevations values indeed I taught 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.500
 often head goals with this player 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:06.110
 then a pair of attackers 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:08.209
 very suitable for speed play and 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.560
 however also for the physical game points 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:11.180
 of strength of this team 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.980
 speed first of all that this is 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.989
 its real strength in fact in 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:17.239
 every department has very fast players 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:19.700
 and this is very useful especially if 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:21.470
 you play a lot online in division 1 in 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.730
 In fact, this is a time for me 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.400
 team you can win with 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:26.989
 quietly division 1 online 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.739
 because it is really complete in every 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:30.170
 Department 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:32.269
 on top of that it is only there was 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:34.280
 practically no one then network 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:35.030
 definitely with players who may not 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.910
 know 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:40.579
 another strength is the cost is not 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:43.160
 very high if we exclude the defenders e 

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:44.720
 donum defenders are the dispensaries then 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.859
 you have to spend for that forgiveness 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:49.790
 again said you can safely 

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:50.959
 use on mini or bns basic versions not me 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:53.150
 like about this team 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:56.989
 the skills there is no skill then 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:58.670
 only four stars the maximum and the 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:00.980
 goalkeeper who is not the top against the 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:02.569
 gold teams however this is common to all 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:04.190
 the silver goalkeepers who suffer a lot 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:06.019
 shoot from the distance at the intersection that 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:07.579
 they are unlikely to succeed if 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:09.109
 you are nostalgic you can 

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:11.079
 quietly use of vaio in attack 

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:13.160
 which is really strong and nesta in defense 

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:14.630
 well guys for years we have concluded 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:16.310
 if the idea of ​​liked a bowl with 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:17.989
 written comments happens 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:19.350
 we will see each other soon with another 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:22.880
 school episode for you 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:22.880
 use hi everyone
