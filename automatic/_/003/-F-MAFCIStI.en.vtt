00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 we come to the appropriate 

00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:05.700
 training form the training forms we 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.319
 yes have a reason 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.300
 this is the first basic form that will become 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.450
 keep coming up in different ways 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.490
 Options in rounds with a gate finish 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.929
 there you can find many variations and 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.150
 Surely you can also go home 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.340
 many more reactions developed 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.500
 It is important to me from this first 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.160
 Training a few principles too 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.140
 understand 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.199
 to show a few principles too 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.810
 We look at ourselves first to build on 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:32.399
 we have three players off and c the 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.079
 About 30 meters man can do that 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.360
 I would like to operate longer passports 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.219
 I would like to have shorter passes longer 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.140
 walkways frame conditional aspect there 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.340
 Can I do the field or the 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.079
 distances, of course, even bigger or 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.539
 choose smaller I have 30 now 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.809
 taken meter then you put two 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.730
 Dummys not only play on as possible 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.530
 a little hat but really big 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.320
 dummy can be pressed on 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.059
 and then different ones 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.739
 Combinations played through the player 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.550
 a middle would be in this variation in 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.469
 stay in the middle 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.350
 you could change it after 23 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.510
 minutes after 56 actions depending on how 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.909
 one conditionally plans depending on how 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.500
 It is important to install this 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.909
 Here and there I would also like to 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.549
 animation come here so stands 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.170
 technical detail coaching but also 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.200
 note the timing we will come soon 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.610
 to look at the appropriate animation 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.040
 I let the first run 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.500
 and then who in the second pass 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.450
 couple things to explain so the first 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.670
 player will always dribble to flu 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.619
 is always the state of the central player 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.150
 just in the picture was player b solves 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.150
 to get out of the central position 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.920
 is played with this trigger with 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.840
 the player dissolves the assumption c 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.979
 up and then becomes further in the further 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.049
 course played on then the 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.640
 basic situation restored here 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.290
 I stopped here for a short time 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.329
 he inserts a counterpart in the 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.380
 Exercise just was not there but 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.899
 should show 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.579
 what it's about in the game context 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.930
 So, do not be surprised that 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.189
 because now is at a time opponent 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.439
 of course, a variation 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:01.649
 Possibility for practice should be here 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.850
 but only certain contexts also show 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:06.390
 Here again exactly the same principle 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:08.399
 others bothered out and here one 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.929
 third pass exactly the same the 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.670
 I'll tell you the arrows and the circles right away 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.950
 in the second, I explain in the second 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.870
 passing 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:18.140
 In this case, the opponent is tight 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:24.530
 and then we look for another one 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:26.450
 Solution and let's have a look at the animation 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:29.870
 as I said again at the beginning of 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:32.030
 stop here with the dribbling and 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:35.660
 there we are with the topic timing with the 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:37.220
 dribbling must be the solution from tens to 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.799
 example in this game in this free 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:42.680
 player b take place he has me out 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:44.480
 solve fast fast in fast powerful 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.610
 a half-open, maybe even open 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.959
 the player comes here if he does 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.519
 he knows he wants the game to the right 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:51.620
 can continue the same with the left 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:53.150
 foot on tremmel has the advantage that he 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.489
 clean the ball with left then also in 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.819
 to play the game of the second player 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:58.099
 can 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:59.810
 that's here with so demonstrated 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:00.519
 dribble and while there are other bands 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.380
 he comes out 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:04.810
 Now the ball is just like 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:08.299
 said with left optimally 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:10.430
 it is played and optimally 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:12.860
 also in the right foot of the fellow player 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:15.349
 played here that has the advantage that 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:17.660
 the right foot takes the ball and then 

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:19.730
 the ball in normal case shortly before 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.560
 another leg of the just mentioned 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.970
 and then it is the same 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.440
 can be played with left the 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:26.900
 means with a good fast 2 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:29.480
 contact game can be played 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:31.220
 also the advantage that one from it others 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.660
 could also have the advantage in the game 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:34.340
 that out of the situation 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:36.410
 can withdraw ball again 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.299
 that means not presenting the ball as far as possible 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:40.220
 but not too close do not stop dead 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:41.239
 not that he is close to the foot because then 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:44.420
 you would not be in the next one either 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:47.780
 action that means here happens 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:48.920
 Now the pass is important too 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.920
 have that a few of them 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:54.139
 foreseen to get out and before 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.639
 he stops or with the 

00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:57.170
 the ball will come too 

00:03:55.639 --> 00:03:59.420
 that means he gets the ball 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:01.400
 not until he has been there for five minutes 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:02.829
 stands and the opponent again 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.359
 pushed there but again 

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:06.950
 dimensions think timing think 

00:04:05.359 --> 00:04:08.630
 the ball has to arrive when it does 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:10.150
 has thus dissolved the opponent 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:12.349
 can not immediately intervene again 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:14.180
 this one is right they believed 

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:15.859
 also indicated and then left 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:18.739
 played on again here too 

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:20.750
 Timing with the reaction to 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:22.760
 to become clear for the game context 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:24.890
 which will play in the deep can be 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:26.110
 even the top player already on his 

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:34.240
 position and made 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:36.729
 to action and we alluded 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:39.789
 had previously addressed as dimension 

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:42.250
 where it comes to coaching where it is 

00:04:39.789 --> 00:04:43.569
 is going to orient yourself and that 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:46.780
 is now here in the second pass 

00:04:43.569 --> 00:04:48.159
 that means the ball is up 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:51.370
 the second pass and there comes now 

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:53.379
 the opponent in the game again 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:54.719
 the top player is dribbling and now 

00:04:53.379 --> 00:04:57.039
 is this player in the duty 

00:04:54.719 --> 00:04:58.569
 during the running movement during the 

00:04:57.039 --> 00:04:59.289
 Freewheel move briefly 

00:04:58.569 --> 00:05:00.879
 orientate 

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:02.199
 to look over her shoulder and 

00:05:00.879 --> 00:05:02.860
 this should be the opponent once 

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:04.270
 demonstrate 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:06.580
 in this case, the opponent is 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:08.379
 relatively far away he can be right in one 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:10.539
 half-open position maybe one 

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:11.409
 open position then the ball 

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:13.270
 hand off 

00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:14.830
 we 'll take another look at that 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:19.300
 means he is now oriented that should 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:20.729
 turns up being turned on 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:24.069
 alluded 

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:25.629
 The blue player comes to light 

00:05:24.069 --> 00:05:27.610
 print out or that of both in this 

00:05:25.629 --> 00:05:29.020
 if we have to play directly what we need 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:30.460
 just have seen if the 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:32.110
 slight pressure on it 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:33.969
 here too this player must be a 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:35.319
 back early enough to solve the 

00:05:33.969 --> 00:05:38.620
 Pass also open so that we too 

00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:40.389
 can play out so much on the subject before 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:42.599
 orientation short look over the 

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:44.740
 shoulder in this second example 

00:05:42.599 --> 00:05:46.569
 is the player again b 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:47.819
 however, now is the opponent 

00:05:46.569 --> 00:05:50.800
 very close 

00:05:47.819 --> 00:05:52.539
 that means we learned to be recommended 

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.830
 that one then the ball in the optimal case 

00:05:52.539 --> 00:05:56.889
 I can also clap that in 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:06:00.400
 this training form briefly picture that 

00:05:56.889 --> 00:06:02.740
 means the ball will be like this 

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:05.259
 hinted at briefly clapping 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:07.539
 now I know if the opponent if 

00:06:05.259 --> 00:06:09.189
 can be solved out of the opposite player 

00:06:07.539 --> 00:06:11.319
 and a give and a player of mine 

00:06:09.189 --> 00:06:13.810
 keep track of the pass away in the deep 

00:06:11.319 --> 00:06:15.550
 it opens up and it is successful 

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:17.529
 implied that means really 

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:18.819
 plays player and dissolves again 

00:06:17.529 --> 00:06:19.870
 back so that also clearly played 

00:06:18.819 --> 00:06:21.219
 Maybe he has too 

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:21.759
 on the other hand somebody plays here too 

00:06:21.219 --> 00:06:23.919
 competed 

00:06:21.759 --> 00:06:25.210
 he pulls back briefly, maybe one 

00:06:23.919 --> 00:06:27.339
 move of a defender himself 

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:27.729
 short who settle there gets the 

00:06:27.339 --> 00:06:29.770
 ball 

00:06:27.729 --> 00:06:31.449
 and now it is clear the pass because of 

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:34.419
 depth is open but that means now 

00:06:31.449 --> 00:06:35.790
 Also that the new game is context itself 

00:06:34.419 --> 00:06:37.830
 also early enough 

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:39.750
 and then can be played here 

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:40.500
 that means it is now direct 

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:42.630
 can clap 

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:46.650
 also there maybe another small 

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:49.110
 detail to when I already see 

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:50.670
 player that my opponent here 

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:51.840
 under pressure then I play them 

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:53.670
 maybe in this case also in the 

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:55.500
 left foot on the other hand in the opponent 

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:56.970
 Foot on so that he is less under pressure 

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:58.680
 still gets his body in between 

00:06:56.970 --> 00:06:59.700
 ball and opponent has and the ball sure 

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:01.260
 can play back 

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:02.790
 that is, while he is played 

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:04.710
 played out and now we have the 

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:06.720
 situation that we are then directly 

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:09.650
 yes as soon as possible the ball in 

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:09.650
 can carry the deep
