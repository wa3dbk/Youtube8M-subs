you can you're in full manual mode you

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.069 
you can you're in full manual mode you
can<00:01:56.219> change<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:56.700> aperture<00:01:56.909> by<00:01:57.299> use<00:01:57.719> of<00:01:57.750> the

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
can change the aperture by use of the

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:02.389 
can change the aperture by use of the
aperture<00:01:58.890> wheel<00:01:59.570> just<00:02:00.570> like<00:02:00.719> that<00:02:01.250> which<00:02:02.250> was

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
aperture wheel just like that which was

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.999 
aperture wheel just like that which was
a<00:02:02.430> lot<00:02:02.610> easier<00:02:02.640> on<00:02:02.939> the<00:02:03.149> on<00:02:03.390> the<00:02:03.479> 550d<00:02:04.110> what<00:02:04.920> you

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
a lot easier on the on the 550d what you

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.399 
a lot easier on the on the 550d what you
have<00:02:05.159> to<00:02:05.280> do<00:02:05.430> is<00:02:05.909> hold<00:02:06.509> down<00:02:06.630> the<00:02:06.899> AV<00:02:07.200> button

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
have to do is hold down the AV button

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.779 
have to do is hold down the AV button
right<00:02:07.560> there<00:02:07.619> above<00:02:07.950> the<00:02:08.069> key<00:02:08.250> hold<00:02:08.610> it<00:02:08.729> down

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:09.789 
right there above the key hold it down

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:12.119 
right there above the key hold it down
and<00:02:09.849> then<00:02:09.969> use<00:02:10.209> this<00:02:10.420> to<00:02:10.719> scroll<00:02:11.140> change<00:02:11.980> the

00:02:12.119 --> 00:02:12.129 
and then use this to scroll change the

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:15.809 
and then use this to scroll change the
aperture<00:02:13.920> so<00:02:14.920> it's<00:02:15.040> a<00:02:15.069> little<00:02:15.219> bit<00:02:15.400> easier<00:02:15.489> on

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:15.819 
aperture so it's a little bit easier on

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:20.039 
aperture so it's a little bit easier on
the<00:02:15.909> 70<00:02:16.269> on<00:02:16.900> the<00:02:17.379> 7d<00:02:18.040> switching<00:02:18.609> from<00:02:19.049> picture

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:20.049 
the 70 on the 7d switching from picture

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:22.589 
the 70 on the 7d switching from picture
mode<00:02:20.230> to<00:02:20.530> movie<00:02:21.250> mode<00:02:21.280> there's<00:02:22.239> a<00:02:22.269> little<00:02:22.480> bit

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:22.599 
mode to movie mode there's a little bit

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:24.390 
mode to movie mode there's a little bit
simpler<00:02:22.930> than<00:02:23.200> it<00:02:23.409> is<00:02:23.500> on<00:02:23.530> the<00:02:23.680> 550d<00:02:24.129> it's<00:02:24.250> just

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
simpler than it is on the 550d it's just

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.670 
simpler than it is on the 550d it's just
that<00:02:24.489> little<00:02:24.640> switch<00:02:24.760> there<00:02:25.000> on<00:02:25.989> the<00:02:26.109> 550d

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
that little switch there on the 550d

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.420 
that little switch there on the 550d
it's<00:02:27.189> you<00:02:28.030> turn<00:02:28.930> the<00:02:29.079> top<00:02:29.290> on<00:02:29.470> here<00:02:29.680> all<00:02:30.189> the

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
it's you turn the top on here all the

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.460 
it's you turn the top on here all the
way<00:02:30.519> around<00:02:30.790> to<00:02:30.970> movie<00:02:31.239> mode<00:02:31.290> so<00:02:32.290> it<00:02:32.349> is<00:02:32.439> a

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
way around to movie mode so it is a

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.500 
way around to movie mode so it is a
little<00:02:32.590> bit<00:02:32.769> easier<00:02:32.920> on<00:02:32.950> the<00:02:33.040> 7d<00:02:33.430> okay<00:02:34.329> on<00:02:34.420> the

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
little bit easier on the 7d okay on the

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.250 
little bit easier on the 7d okay on the
7d<00:02:35.579> when<00:02:36.579> you<00:02:36.849> want<00:02:37.420> to<00:02:37.480> record<00:02:37.720> in<00:02:37.870> manual

the<00:05:06.500> features<00:05:06.800> that<00:05:06.830> we<00:05:07.310> can<00:05:07.460> find<00:05:07.729> difference

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:08.450 
the features that we can find difference

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:10.120 
the features that we can find difference
between<00:05:08.690> the<00:05:08.810> two<00:05:08.930> cameras<00:05:09.350> I'm<00:05:09.590> sure<00:05:09.830> there's

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:10.130 
between the two cameras I'm sure there's

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:11.500 
between the two cameras I'm sure there's
a<00:05:10.340> couple<00:05:10.640> more<00:05:10.760> that<00:05:10.910> we<00:05:11.000> missed<00:05:11.240> but

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:11.510 
a couple more that we missed but

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:15.340 
a couple more that we missed but
basically<00:05:12.070> the<00:05:13.070> 550d<00:05:13.640> and<00:05:14.030> the<00:05:14.180> 7d<00:05:14.690> both<00:05:14.990> shoot

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:15.350 
basically the 550d and the 7d both shoot

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:17.920 
basically the 550d and the 7d both shoot
the<00:05:15.530> same<00:05:15.740> quality<00:05:16.280> of<00:05:16.310> video<00:05:16.760> and<00:05:17.060> they<00:05:17.720> shoot

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:17.930 
the same quality of video and they shoot

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:20.170 
the same quality of video and they shoot
the<00:05:18.050> same<00:05:18.200> quality<00:05:18.560> of<00:05:18.590> photographs<00:05:19.130> so<00:05:19.460> if

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:20.180 
the same quality of photographs so if

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:23.110 
the same quality of photographs so if
you<00:05:20.479> just<00:05:20.750> want<00:05:20.930> a<00:05:20.990> DSLR<00:05:21.560> for<00:05:21.800> video<00:05:22.190> only<00:05:22.760> the

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:23.120 
you just want a DSLR for video only the

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:24.610 
you just want a DSLR for video only the
550d<00:05:23.660> would<00:05:23.900> probably<00:05:24.169> be<00:05:24.289> the<00:05:24.380> better<00:05:24.530> choice

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:24.620 
550d would probably be the better choice

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:28.029 
550d would probably be the better choice
because<00:05:25.180> the<00:05:26.180> same<00:05:26.479> quality<00:05:26.750> as<00:05:26.810> a<00:05:26.870> 7d<00:05:27.320> but<00:05:27.860> if

00:05:28.029 --> 00:05:28.039 
because the same quality as a 7d but if

00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:29.500 
because the same quality as a 7d but if
you're<00:05:28.190> more<00:05:28.340> of<00:05:28.430> a<00:05:28.490> photographer<00:05:29.060> definitely

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:29.510 
you're more of a photographer definitely

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:31.420 
you're more of a photographer definitely
go<00:05:29.600> with<00:05:29.660> the<00:05:29.750> 7b<00:05:30.200> as<00:05:30.440> it<00:05:30.560> has<00:05:30.680> quite<00:05:31.190> a<00:05:31.250> few

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:31.430
