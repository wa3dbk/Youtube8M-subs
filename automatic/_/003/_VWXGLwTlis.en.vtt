00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
the dough in a kneading machine and we

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.320 
the dough in a kneading machine and we
let<00:01:13.710> it<00:01:13.740> cool<00:01:14.070> down<00:01:16.490> then<00:01:17.490> we<00:01:17.729> switch<00:01:18.000> on<00:01:18.299> the

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
machine at a medium speed and we start

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:29.780 
machine at a medium speed and we start
combining<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.690> eggs<00:01:27.320> we<00:01:28.320> make<00:01:28.650> them<00:01:28.890> mix<00:01:29.490> well

combining the eggs we make them mix well
one<00:01:30.060> by<00:01:30.240> one<00:01:32.270> now<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.330> dough<00:01:33.689> is<00:01:33.720> ready<00:01:33.900> so<00:01:34.500> we

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
one by one now the dough is ready so we

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.130 
one by one now the dough is ready so we
can<00:01:34.799> switch<00:01:35.010> off<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.340> kneading<00:01:35.640> machine<00:01:36.140> we

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
can switch off the kneading machine we

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.390 
can switch off the kneading machine we
have<00:01:37.260> to<00:01:37.409> obtain<00:01:37.680> a<00:01:37.710> doubt<00:01:38.040> of<00:01:38.250> his

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
have to obtain a doubt of his

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.820 
have to obtain a doubt of his
consistency<00:01:39.180> at<00:01:39.750> this<00:01:39.960> point<00:01:40.260> we<00:01:40.500> can<00:01:40.710> start

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:40.830 
consistency at this point we can start

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:42.800 
consistency at this point we can start
cooking<00:01:41.130> as<00:01:41.460> I<00:01:41.610> play<00:01:41.909> using<00:01:42.150> a<00:01:42.360> couple<00:01:42.600> of
