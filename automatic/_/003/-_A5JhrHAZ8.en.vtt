00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
pretty cheap and pretty crappy but it

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.540 
pretty cheap and pretty crappy but it
works<00:00:45.600> out<00:00:45.809> pretty<00:00:45.960> well<00:00:46.250> not<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.399> most

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
works out pretty well not the most

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.830 
works out pretty well not the most
nicest<00:00:47.789> but<00:00:49.250> anyway<00:00:50.250> here's<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.360> main<00:00:51.510> part

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
nicest but anyway here's the main part

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.080 
nicest but anyway here's the main part
this<00:00:52.170> is<00:00:52.440> where<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:52.710> camera<00:00:53.070> gets<00:00:53.489> mounted<00:00:53.969> on

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
this is where the camera gets mounted on

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.869 
this is where the camera gets mounted on
to<00:00:54.500> it's<00:00:55.500> got<00:00:55.680> some<00:00:55.890> stands<00:00:56.160> right<00:00:56.370> there<00:00:56.460> made

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
to it's got some stands right there made

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.450 
to it's got some stands right there made
it<00:00:57.000> our<00:00:57.120> channel<00:00:57.570> aluminum<00:00:58.079> and<00:00:58.320> that's<00:00:59.190> where

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
it our channel aluminum and that's where

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.660 
it our channel aluminum and that's where
it's<00:00:59.640> mounted<00:01:00.030> up<00:01:00.149> from<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.390> base<00:01:00.570> of<00:01:01.020> a

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
it's mounted up from the base of a

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.479 
it's mounted up from the base of a
quarter<00:01:02.670> quarter<00:01:03.420> bolt<00:01:03.690> mounting<00:01:04.650> it

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
quarter quarter bolt mounting it

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.109 
quarter quarter bolt mounting it
actually<00:01:05.850> goes<00:01:06.000> up<00:01:06.270> this<00:01:06.630> way<00:01:06.900> and<00:01:07.200> this

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:08.119 
actually goes up this way and this

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:12.950 
actually goes up this way and this
whoops<00:01:10.130> it<00:01:11.130> goes<00:01:11.400> like<00:01:11.490> that<00:01:11.790> that<00:01:12.150> goes<00:01:12.390> under

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
whoops it goes like that that goes under

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.320 
whoops it goes like that that goes under
and<00:01:13.140> this<00:01:13.979> sits<00:01:14.700> up<00:01:14.850> a<00:01:14.909> little<00:01:15.090> bit<00:01:15.180> more

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
and this sits up a little bit more

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.890 
and this sits up a little bit more
because<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:16.369> screen<00:01:17.369> would<00:01:18.299> right<00:01:18.450> into<00:01:18.750> that

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
because the screen would right into that

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.590 
because the screen would right into that
and<00:01:19.229> then<00:01:20.130> right<00:01:20.400> there<00:01:20.670> there's<00:01:21.090> another

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.190 

like<00:01:24.600> connecting<00:01:25.500> nut<00:01:25.880> which<00:01:26.930> goes<00:01:27.930> to<00:01:28.110> the

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
like connecting nut which goes to the

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.640 
like connecting nut which goes to the
tripod<00:01:29.299> but<00:01:30.299> nice<00:01:30.630> made<00:01:31.079> out<00:01:31.200> of<00:01:31.320> really<00:01:31.470> nice

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
tripod but nice made out of really nice

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.090 
tripod but nice made out of really nice
aluminum<00:01:31.920> stuff<00:01:32.689> and<00:01:33.689> then<00:01:33.960> PVC<00:01:34.590> which<00:01:34.860> this

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
aluminum stuff and then PVC which this

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.740 
aluminum stuff and then PVC which this
is<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.340> handle<00:01:35.670> there<00:01:35.850> that<00:01:36.210> goes<00:01:36.450> on<00:01:36.600> to

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
is the handle there that goes on to

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.760 
is the handle there that goes on to
their<00:01:36.900> you<00:01:37.500> can<00:01:37.650> hold<00:01:37.799> it<00:01:38.009> above<00:01:39.320> and<00:01:40.320> from

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
their you can hold it above and from

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.440 
their you can hold it above and from
these<00:01:41.400> two<00:01:41.640> pieces<00:01:41.850> right<00:01:42.150> there<00:01:42.360> and

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
these two pieces right there and

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.510 
these two pieces right there and
stifling<00:01:42.810> it<00:01:43.049> on<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.799> side<00:01:44.009> which<00:01:44.189> I'm<00:01:44.369> doing

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
stifling it on the side which I'm doing

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.550 
stifling it on the side which I'm doing
right<00:01:44.640> now<00:01:44.880> it's<00:01:45.540> kind<00:01:45.659> of<00:01:45.840> hard<00:01:46.020> to<00:01:46.079> get<00:01:46.290> like

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
right now it's kind of hard to get like

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.770 
right now it's kind of hard to get like
you<00:01:46.590> know<00:01:46.770> of<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.399> rear<00:01:47.579> dangles<00:01:47.970> so<00:01:48.570> this

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
you know of the rear dangles so this

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.270 
you know of the rear dangles so this
works<00:01:48.990> a<00:01:49.049> little<00:01:49.110> bit<00:01:49.259> better<00:01:49.409> and<00:01:49.740> I<00:01:50.040> here<00:01:50.250> i

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
works a little bit better and I here i

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.149 
works a little bit better and I here i
have<00:01:50.579> a<00:01:50.790> matte<00:01:51.030> box<00:01:51.270> which<00:01:51.509> i<00:01:51.659> made<00:01:51.869> i<00:01:52.140> just<00:01:53.040> got

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
have a matte box which i made i just got

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.160 
have a matte box which i made i just got
to<00:01:53.189> spray<00:01:53.460> paint<00:01:53.520> it<00:01:53.759> black<00:01:53.909> man<00:01:54.780> out<00:01:54.869> of<00:01:54.960> sheet

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
to spray paint it black man out of sheet

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.370 
to spray paint it black man out of sheet
metal<00:01:55.320> and<00:01:55.880> so<00:01:56.880> i<00:01:56.909> think<00:01:57.509> that's<00:01:57.780> a<00:01:57.960> teflon

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
metal and so i think that's a teflon

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.819 
metal and so i think that's a teflon
tape<00:01:58.409> roll<00:01:59.479> and<00:02:00.479> it's<00:02:01.079> all<00:02:01.259> riveted<00:02:01.680> together

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
tape roll and it's all riveted together

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.850 
tape roll and it's all riveted together
and<00:02:02.310> such<00:02:02.700> and<00:02:03.149> spray<00:02:04.110> painted<00:02:04.380> black<00:02:04.590> and

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
then that goes mounted that gets mounted

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.280 
then that goes mounted that gets mounted
like<00:02:10.440> that<00:02:10.709> and

like that and
karrimor<00:02:11.709> just<00:02:11.860> imagine<00:02:12.219> that<00:02:12.370> right<00:02:12.579> there

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
karrimor just imagine that right there

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.030 
karrimor just imagine that right there
and<00:02:13.840> makes<00:02:14.500> it<00:02:14.650> look<00:02:14.680> a<00:02:14.860> lot<00:02:14.980> more

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
and makes it look a lot more

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:23.610 
and makes it look a lot more
professional<00:02:19.019> bad<00:02:20.019> in<00:02:20.200> there<00:02:22.079> and<00:02:23.079> then<00:02:23.260> here

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
professional bad in there and then here

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.800 
professional bad in there and then here

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
i have this so it goes over the screen

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.809 
i have this so it goes over the screen
so<00:02:26.260> I<00:02:26.290> can<00:02:26.349> see<00:02:26.739> when<00:02:26.890> I<00:02:26.920> filming<00:02:27.310> it's<00:02:27.430> in<00:02:27.700> the
