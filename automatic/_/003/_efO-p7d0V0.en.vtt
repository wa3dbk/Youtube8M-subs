00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
much identical to the personal travel

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:21.170 
much identical to the personal travel
food<00:04:20.040> system<00:04:20.489> where<00:04:20.669> it's<00:04:20.790> meats<00:04:21.000> and

vegetables<00:04:21.410> any<00:04:22.410> processed<00:04:22.950> starch<00:04:23.220> is<00:04:23.430> even

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:23.850 
vegetables any processed starch is even

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:25.460 
vegetables any processed starch is even
any<00:04:24.000> whole<00:04:24.180> grains<00:04:24.510> will<00:04:24.810> spike<00:04:25.080> the<00:04:25.260> blood

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
any whole grains will spike the blood

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:28.490 
any whole grains will spike the blood
sugar<00:04:25.500> and<00:04:26.070> the<00:04:26.160> child<00:04:26.910> will<00:04:27.240> have<00:04:27.450> to<00:04:27.690> take<00:04:28.350> an

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
sugar and the child will have to take an

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.490 
sugar and the child will have to take an
insulin<00:04:28.890> shot<00:04:28.919> and<00:04:29.400> so<00:04:30.210> I<00:04:30.480> got<00:04:30.990> to<00:04:31.140> thinking

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 
insulin shot and so I got to thinking

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.170
