it wasn't hard to take time off college

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:46.420 
it wasn't hard to take time off college
because<00:01:45.200> I<00:01:45.380> didn't<00:01:45.740> have<00:01:45.890> any<00:01:45.980> student<00:01:46.280> loans

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 
because I didn't have any student loans

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.010 
because I didn't have any student loans
or<00:01:46.580> anything<00:01:46.730> that<00:01:47.240> I<00:01:47.270> have<00:01:47.390> to<00:01:47.480> pay<00:01:47.600> back<00:01:47.810> yet

or anything that I have to pay back yet

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.080 
or anything that I have to pay back yet

lots of research before your phone
interview<00:02:44.390> because<00:02:44.959> that's<00:02:45.140> how<00:02:45.290> you<00:02:45.350> have<00:02:45.500> to

get<00:02:45.739> to<00:02:45.860> the<00:02:45.950> program<00:02:46.580> in<00:02:46.670> the<00:02:46.700> first<00:02:46.880> place<00:02:47.120> I

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.270 
get to the program in the first place I

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:49.000 
get to the program in the first place I

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
the roles and just knowing what each

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.350 
the roles and just knowing what each
role<00:02:54.709> entails<00:02:55.010> I<00:02:55.370> agree<00:02:55.760> with<00:02:55.910> what<00:02:55.940> Amy's

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:49.670 
then the cons to working on attractions

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:51.850 
then the cons to working on attractions
is<00:03:49.850> also<00:03:50.240> all<00:03:50.360> the<00:03:50.510> guest<00:03:50.690> interaction<00:03:50.990> these

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:51.860 
is also all the guest interaction these

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:53.890 
is also all the guest interaction these
guys<00:03:52.160> if<00:03:52.370> something<00:03:52.670> happens<00:03:53.000> at<00:03:53.090> the<00:03:53.210> ride<00:03:53.360> or

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900 
guys if something happens at the ride or

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.350 
guys if something happens at the ride or
breaks<00:03:54.290> down<00:03:54.560> or<00:03:55.160> I<00:03:55.190> guess<00:03:55.760> this<00:03:55.940> having<00:03:56.210> issue

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:56.360 
breaks down or I guess this having issue

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.210 
breaks down or I guess this having issue
with<00:03:56.600> something<00:03:57.020> it<00:03:57.410> can<00:03:57.650> be<00:03:57.890> really

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220 
with something it can be really

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:02.410 
with something it can be really
difficult<00:03:58.460> to<00:03:59.560> kind<00:04:00.560> of<00:04:00.740> solve<00:04:01.400> those<00:04:01.730> guests

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:02.420 
difficult to kind of solve those guests

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:05.320 
difficult to kind of solve those guests
problems<00:04:03.020> I<00:04:03.290> learned<00:04:03.680> a<00:04:03.770> lot<00:04:03.890> by<00:04:04.040> doing<00:04:04.070> it<00:04:04.550> so

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:05.330 
problems I learned a lot by doing it so

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:06.790 
problems I learned a lot by doing it so
that's<00:04:05.510> definitely<00:04:05.660> probably<00:04:06.080> the<00:04:06.380> gun<00:04:06.590> I

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:06.800 
that's definitely probably the gun I

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:08.560 
that's definitely probably the gun I
would<00:04:07.070> say<00:04:07.100> my<00:04:07.430> pro<00:04:07.730> is<00:04:07.790> definitely<00:04:08.360> guest

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:08.570 
would say my pro is definitely guest

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:10.240 
would say my pro is definitely guest
interaction<00:04:09.170> also<00:04:09.350> because<00:04:10.070> with

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:47.680 
think that working there takes the magic

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:50.159

out<00:06:47.889> of<00:06:48.039> visiting<00:06:48.580> the<00:06:48.699> parks<00:06:49.120> I<00:06:49.360> don't<00:06:49.990> think

out of visiting the parks I don't think

00:06:50.169 --> 00:06:51.809 
out of visiting the parks I don't think
that<00:06:50.289> working<00:06:50.650> here<00:06:51.009> takes<00:06:51.220> the<00:06:51.340> magic<00:06:51.520> out

00:06:51.809 --> 00:06:51.819 
that working here takes the magic out

00:06:51.819 --> 00:06:53.700 
that working here takes the magic out
when<00:06:52.210> I<00:06:52.240> come<00:06:52.449> in<00:06:52.569> as<00:06:52.660> a<00:06:52.690> guest<00:06:52.870> I<00:06:53.050> still<00:06:53.380> feel
