00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.060
 hello i want to be a main course with 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.910
 We make you quickly have to now 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:25.770
 on all sides 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:30.670
 and it should give it today roast meat 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:33.100
 you can find it now both in this 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:36.309
 guide in the new the headscarf 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:39.610
 or still in the red 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:41.140
 reason cookbook many requests came that 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:44.769
 the people are afraid now that you have the 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:46.059
 stuff from the tm 31 was not anymore 

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:49.120
 can do in the new 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:51.370
 but of course that's just upside down 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:56.469
 Not always so you can not 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:59.260
 all the recipes of the tm 35 do most of it 

00:00:56.469 --> 00:01:01.539
 of course a part but not synonymous 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:06.160
 because here simply the capacity 

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:08.229
 krÃ¶ger is and that is partly in 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:11.619
 the tm 31 not easy 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:21.030
