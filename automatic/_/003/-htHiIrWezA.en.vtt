00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:01.670
 on the courts 

00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:03.200
 not for RTL 

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:04.930
 Come on 

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:10.430
 or better curtain on for the new attraction in Sea Life Constance 10 

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:15.840
 From now on, these penguins have their new home Senesie here on Lake Constance 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:17.250
 Singer getting more and more 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.220
 The first in a German winner Center Wersten penguins was on the 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:22.949
 first level Spang Rena 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.130
 throughout Styria 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.590
 and for us here on site the first animals little 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.339
 That's what triggers are 

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:33.449
 for the largest conversion in Constance Sealife since he 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.460
 you have put a lot of effort into the new area was built so that 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.100
 the penguins feel good 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.980
 Everything you need to live in the Antarctic is also available to the animals here 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:44.860
 necessary 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:50.010
 Temperature summer cold and food are tailored to the needs 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.610
 and that the penguins feel good every kid really shines 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:58.890
 Children's eyes admire the action behind the disc and that of each one 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.570
 perspective 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.710
 the upright walk very human-like quite the label 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.720
 efficient as can imagine as the ice run as it is and 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.140
 it gets a bit tight when you get there or you can take advantage of it 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.590
 Percent of ours is that makes that attractive 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.460
 from who of course last in the victories in the series 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.690
 have seen in poles 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.500
 that is completely different animals 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.030
 flying underwater it is quite fascinating 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.750
 and who they chose for the broadcast 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.960
 Not flying in the air but the same movement is already in the water 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.840
 I really look like I'm flying 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.630
 they jump out of the water a bit when they are in a hurry 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.940
 simply so that I have very water resistance 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.550
 This almost looks like the dolphins 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:42.150
 and all that visitors can observe here is a very active animal 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.750
 means one can actually always if one refuses her 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:46.220
 something special 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.509
 The penguins are not just watching 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.239
 but also to hear a special experience for all visitors 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.260
 you sit for hours or forums watch the penguins 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.410
 Percent also sees that they probably make noises because they are in Stade 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:01.149
 Place your head upwards 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:04.670
 but we hear that we do not know that the killer becomes his way 

00:02:04.669 --> 00:02:07.700
 the situation in addition or that we have to have that too 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:12.109
 "When he turns on Messi our Wednesday will be in front of our auspreche facility 

00:02:12.109 --> 00:02:14.919
 and suddenly you get what's going on there you hear like that 

00:02:14.919 --> 00:02:18.089
 Penguins with their feet on the wet 

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:21.299
 Bathing on the wet land surface you can hear them entering the water 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:22.879
 the world will jump 

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:26.629
 from a crisis, the Kiesel winner plant wants to have it in run percent and has 

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:28.489
 a son so clicked so you can actually 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:31.700
 one is way of shape no longer has the feeling that a glass pane 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:32.560
 in between 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.449
 at that time opened 

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:36.929
 very close to the life of the penguins 

00:02:36.929 --> 00:02:40.599
 but also the living space of these animals is caused by climate change 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:43.699
 The land also threatens the visitors here 

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:46.639
 At Sea Life Konstanz you can experience first-hand 

00:02:46.639 --> 00:02:49.229
 why environmental protection is becoming increasingly important 

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:54.629
 And by the way you dive into the fascinating world of these penguins
