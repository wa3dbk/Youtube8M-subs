00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:14.240
 general hello here finally legs ready 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:19.670
 for sharpening i.e. externally everything is produced 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:24.029
 filled the hole with a mixture 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:30.150
 epoxy and toner and the camera is bad 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:35.399
 conveys color but looks like 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:40.950
 Tomato juice is very frozen for a long time. 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:45.950
 pondered on the subject of my own 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:50.219
 sharpen a knife so that it is more or less 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:52.620
 versatile and yet performed tasks 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:57.030
 I uncovered the potential laid down and became in 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:01:02.670
 form rolled form 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:05.659
 man of this market will only build the blade 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.320
 it is most likely either that is 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:11.070
 specialized knife for cutting 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:13.020
 large fish are not too often in my 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.020
 happens to carve big fish 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:21.200
 so you want all the same so that the knife was 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.200
 suitable for other more 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:27.020
 common everyday tasks 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:30.600
 nastrogat twigs chop sticks 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:35.850
 make the pegs cut the bread well and 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:42.979
 so on so on so on shovel 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:47.299
 I will think about the form after thinking 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:50.630
 not in a classic chisel like here 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:53.270
 where would sharpen 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:57.509
 exclusively here from this side and 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:59.060
 flat i don't like it 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.640
 really case 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:05.149
 highly specialized blade will turn out 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.270
 so there will be a so-called 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:11.780
 combined 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:15.680
 they are symmetrical behind. this side 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:22.620
 the cutting edge will be more canopy 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:27.410
 at an angle of 20 degrees to the axis of the blade with 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.410
 this side is more cool for. 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:40.650
 in English double there was enough space 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:43.010
 what are we going to the point of continuing 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.010
 follows 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:52.290
 we start sharpening 2 sub i don't 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:58.739
 electronic angle exhibiting 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:03:05.790
 accordingly in ancient angles 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:13.069
 article of modern production knife 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:13.069
 kicking that self-made apex 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:15.579
 so as not to be unfounded 

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:21.090
 sharpening is done like this 

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:21.090
 the bar still Polevsky plant 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:27.039
 guitars 

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:32.259
 gustowski and the club I have not found not 

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:35.430
 there was this 160 micron electrocorundum on 

00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:35.430
 medium hard ligament 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:02.260
 I'm 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:11.050
