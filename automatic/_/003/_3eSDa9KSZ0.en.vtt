 we are also going to search among the topics 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.320
 the one we like the most is that we 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.030
 make us relax and feel that passion is 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.969
 the sensuality that logically we are going to 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:06.619
 bring love the positivity and the 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:09.720
 modified that already happened 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:11.940

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:29.700
 also some sheets here can see 

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:31.920
 here petals of the roses a mixture of 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.789
 herbs that can be dried as 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.789
 chamomile 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:41.240
 everything that is I do months and so many 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:44.180
 we will also occupy the following the 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.619
 band the band is to give our 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:49.250
 relationship a little more tranquility 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:51.110
 and above all to gather that always 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.610
 we have standards has a pressure 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.920
 actions that we ourselves and is very 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:58.490
 important the magic of a world that 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:00.140
 has is to love and lean on the 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:03.240
 next way what we're going to do 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:06.250
 let's put the water 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.380
 is that as you see the purified water 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.690
