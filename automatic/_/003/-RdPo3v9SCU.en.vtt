00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:04.720

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:09.150
 the council says scoop many questions then send us and left behind 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.819
 videos on her blog 

00:00:11.819 --> 00:00:14.079
 is there at the request of the tsar on it 

00:00:14.079 --> 00:00:18.470
 and what do I get so often that I don't think I'm going to treat that regions 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:19.300
 everybody 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.659
 can watch this video and 

00:00:21.659 --> 00:00:24.619
 yes what more value can come to know about me 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:28.000
 I'm not going to make it more than ten years because then it won't be a bit 

00:00:27.999 --> 00:00:29.289
 look boring cards 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:32.180
 so i'm going there a few months 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.630
 shorter soon in other branches with a tsunami 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:36.680
 the sqaure 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.820
 data is about to start, they also immediately ask the most frequently asked question 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:46.260
 and that in years ago from the start I already have qaida to beat me 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.030
 fifteen years it's my birthday on October 12 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:52.830
 Question 2 is in which country are you and you make that mistake 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:58.800
 i get sitting in a tv studio and one of the time that is exam ing 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.260
 the cbl requested there is back window together 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.090
 but now the last place is because of the fog 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:12.240
 fz48 and i have had this for a while now i am very happy news i did 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.010
 I have been sick for a while 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:19.250
 he is not too complicated but integral it not once and 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.790
 nv was super and then the last question from others to ask this question 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.810
 says marina come and ask what other problems 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:30.280
 and that is 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.790
 that is use it anyway yes and I always start using with guess that we are in 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:39.010
 ekehaar and but that worked really well not such an auction 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:43.480
 I don't get along too much and neither does his father hurt me the way 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.770
 of a building that just look what you think look what you think 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.480
 whether you can work with it 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.480
 and I say that five times already 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.540
 the work of a super small and 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.370
 so it no longer fun to be spectacular perfect bending cell or that nothing 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:00.470
 deficit environment 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.650
 making complicated music videos is only going to make matters worse 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:06.490
 to cut immediately 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.490
 it speed up flushing things like that 

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:13.680
 and sometimes a bit of work on a message in the ad 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.949
 it can't be all that I hope so 

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:18.949
 super nice program it is not free though 

00:02:19.529 --> 00:02:21.579
 yes if you do this no more than a year earlier 

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:23.159
 then welcome 

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:24.549
 that actually is 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:26.479
 that is in one 

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:29.669
 and after if you look at the wardrobe something like that 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:31.020
 to 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:36.360
 I just neatly listed last week and I think as a tourist 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.019
 industry at nijmegen 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:41.659
 he had a unique Saturday and doesn't read the whole story now 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:46.189
 That said he had a store with a lot 

00:02:46.189 --> 00:02:49.189
 nice things that are not satisfied 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:53.200
 we think annie mg rover myself I am also very nice 

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:59.109
 and I think it's really a guy here what about individuals who you see 

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:02.409
 not so very often back to my other stores too 

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:06.259
 and there was also Independence Church for the Target Church 

00:03:06.839 --> 00:03:08.110
 marijn 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:13.040
 Japan first won Twente Monday a few weeks later or what kind of profession 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.169
 and which training itself 

00:03:15.169 --> 00:03:19.389
 I thought he still had an exam that would have to know a bit which way 

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:20.199
 it goes on 

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:24.949
 but whether I get going is down to what can get some space and focus 

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:28.659
 to a smaller package of subjects that said that there should also be a market this year 

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:30.169
 become and will do 

00:03:30.169 --> 00:03:31.049
 nyon 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:36.939
 yes I do not want communication sit trumpet and very nice to the 

00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:39.639
 editorial staff working hoffenheim 

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:41.640
 this tactic has its plan 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.679
 pd designs about he and his family making a declaration 

00:03:45.679 --> 00:03:49.759
 and he probably goes the name exam years to the graphic school 

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:54.209
 have noticed that they are doing new employee training 

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:59.369
 and per a sign of where I look at it, but that will not work 

00:03:59.369 --> 00:04:01.299
 on my honors list 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:04.299
 apparently not that it is a very nice education and you 

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:06.559
 and actually a school too 

00:04:06.559 --> 00:04:08.399
 start working in the last question 

00:04:08.399 --> 00:04:12.669
 easyjet can go a minute later also i think i'm going to where his parents are 

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:14.229
 go first 

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:17.349
 that is a difficult question what he could do to people only once 

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:20.239
 americans again a lot but i have not been able to go that much 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:24.000
 of course there would be things going on like mascara on the line 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.319
 But eye pencil the body soon runs out 

00:04:26.319 --> 00:04:27.379
 and 

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:30.699
 or it would choose some really nice products but not that fast 

00:04:31.219 --> 00:04:34.489
 yes you are a knife so you can do it yourself 

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:38.690
 he thinks care 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:41.310
 I've always gone to buy a good Chris 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:42.219
 get it now 

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:43.120
 I'm going to have candles 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:47.360
 I love that, I really can't get enough of investors 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.120
 initially and let go 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.129
 install 

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:55.079
 that he got favorite programs and then 10 cm afterwards jan 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:58.710
 as first it is not the first time last week every day 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:03.440
 and certainly not at all I had just kept watching every day 

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:09.069
 yes and 4 companies choose less it is a bit very predictable and 

00:05:09.069 --> 00:05:13.559
 traders turkey that is needed by the program so the chance of a place 

00:05:13.559 --> 00:05:16.029
 must get up and see for yourself then flying 

00:05:16.029 --> 00:05:17.409
 and a name 

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:23.729
 all programs if they already have qaida antwerp prof and then watch and me 

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:25.570
 have a snack that needs it 

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:28.949
 all this is the mole explicitly mad 

00:05:28.949 --> 00:05:32.300
 I have always acknowledged that I think I am 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:36.270
 much in the province has to read an article and 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:41.439
 watch a movie on youtube so yes I think I don't like you so much 

00:05:41.439 --> 00:05:45.360
 I am also not one of the favorite films, it is really not mine 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:49.659
 thing done that leaves the question author of people in need she doesn't complain 

00:05:49.659 --> 00:05:52.659
 not to say we just wait for our area 

00:05:53.259 --> 00:05:55.689
 when the attacker returned 

00:05:55.689 --> 00:05:59.889
 Ask about the role and if it continues like this then the Hoekse gets it anyway 

00:05:59.889 --> 00:06:02.349
 in I can go to that place for next time
