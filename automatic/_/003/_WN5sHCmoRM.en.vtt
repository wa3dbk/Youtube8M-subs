00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350 
is the brain from the top view boy in

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.789 
is the brain from the top view boy in
the<00:00:04.560> front<00:00:04.680> is<00:00:05.460> the<00:00:05.940> frontal<00:00:06.660> lobe<00:00:06.810> who<00:00:07.649> would

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
the front is the frontal lobe who would

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:13.249 
the front is the frontal lobe who would
it<00:00:07.919> gets<00:00:08.069> them<00:00:08.750> and<00:00:09.750> on<00:00:10.019> the<00:00:10.200> sides<00:00:11.990> and<00:00:12.990> at<00:00:13.139> the

true okay I was so sauce okay there are
a<00:00:48.629> few<00:00:48.899> major<00:00:49.410> ones<00:00:49.829> right<00:00:50.070> on<00:00:50.280> this<00:00:51.180> one<00:00:51.449> that

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
a few major ones right on this one that

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:53.959 
a few major ones right on this one that
separates<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:52.980> brain<00:00:53.160> of<00:00:53.280> two<00:00:53.520> lobes

that's<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.629> longitudinal<00:00:55.350> soldier

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
that's the longitudinal soldier

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.779 
that's the longitudinal soldier
the<00:00:56.670> shadow<00:00:57.230> Fisher<00:00:58.230> whatever<00:00:58.789> longitudinal

shit<00:01:01.519> telling<00:01:02.519> you<00:01:02.670> what<00:01:03.510> you<00:01:03.600> think<00:01:03.870> shit

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.580 

it's<00:01:11.820> not<00:01:12.060> around<00:01:12.630> this<00:01:13.080> general<00:01:13.890> area<00:01:14.310> here

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
it's not around this general area here

it's not around this general area here
and<00:01:16.590> just<00:01:16.920> a<00:01:17.070> central<00:01:17.520> switch<00:01:17.640> it<00:01:18.119> divided<00:01:18.539> the

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
and just a central switch it divided the

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.310 
and just a central switch it divided the
frontal<00:01:19.320> and<00:01:19.560> parietal<00:01:19.740> lobes<00:01:20.399> okay<00:01:21.320> familiar

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
at all man the lateral so it's on which

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.320 
at all man the lateral so it's on which
divides<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:26.100> parietal

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:28.330 
divides the parietal

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:32.190 
divides the parietal

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
okay okay okay and on the human brain

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.720 
okay okay okay and on the human brain
which<00:01:32.710> you<00:01:32.800> can't<00:01:33.010> see<00:01:33.100> here<00:01:33.220> we<00:01:33.580> have

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:35.970 
which you can't see here we have
something<00:01:34.090> fifth<00:01:34.690> lobe<00:01:34.930> known<00:01:35.170> as<00:01:35.320> the<00:01:35.470> insula

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:35.980 
something fifth lobe known as the insula

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:39.150 
something fifth lobe known as the insula
which<00:01:36.130> is<00:01:36.370> between<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:38.170> inside<00:01:38.590> and<00:01:38.860> they're

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:39.160 
which is between the inside and they're

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:44.370

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:10.680 
and here would be the pineal gland but

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.400 
and here would be the pineal gland but
you<00:02:10.830> can't<00:02:11.070> see<00:02:11.430> in<00:02:11.490> this<00:02:11.610> camera<00:02:11.880> not<00:02:12.410> visible

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
you can't see in this camera not visible

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.470 
you can't see in this camera not visible
but<00:02:13.620> it'll<00:02:14.010> be<00:02:14.100> it<00:02:14.520> take<00:02:14.820> my<00:02:14.940> word<00:02:15.120> for<00:02:15.150> it<00:02:15.330> it's

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
but it'll be it take my word for it it's

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.480 
but it'll be it take my word for it it's
there<00:02:15.720> like<00:02:16.140> in<00:02:16.290> the<00:02:16.320> absolute<00:02:16.800> it's<00:02:17.040> in<00:02:17.310> the

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
there like in the absolute it's in the

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.230 
there like in the absolute it's in the
bear<00:02:17.730> the<00:02:18.240> pineal<00:02:18.600> gland<00:02:18.930> I<00:02:19.020> just<00:02:19.260> poked<00:02:19.500> it

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.240 
bear the pineal gland I just poked it

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.590 
bear the pineal gland I just poked it
then<00:02:21.240> you<00:02:21.360> also<00:02:21.570> have<00:02:21.870> the<00:02:22.080> superior

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 
then you also have the superior

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.170 
then you also have the superior
colliculi<00:02:24.600> and<00:02:24.930> the<00:02:25.680> inferior<00:02:26.310> colliculi<00:02:26.850> you

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
colliculi and the inferior colliculi you

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:32.000 
colliculi and the inferior colliculi you
look<00:02:27.390> like<00:02:27.570> a<00:02:27.600> blood<00:02:30.170> superior<00:02:31.170> on<00:02:31.350> top<00:02:31.740> in

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
look like a blood superior on top in

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:37.280 
look like a blood superior on top in
favorite<00:02:32.430> Akbar<00:02:34.910> and<00:02:35.910> thus<00:02:36.330> rubella<00:02:36.870> has

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
favorite Akbar and thus rubella has

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:38.810 
favorite Akbar and thus rubella has
three<00:02:37.650> hemispheres<00:02:37.800> even<00:02:38.460> though<00:02:38.550> that<00:02:38.670> this

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
three hemispheres even though that this

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:43.490 
three hemispheres even though that this
make<00:02:39.570> sense<00:02:40.520> look<00:02:41.520> at<00:02:41.640> centre-back<00:02:41.820> these<00:02:42.630> on

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
make sense look at centre-back these on

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.560 
make sense look at centre-back these on
the<00:02:43.650> side<00:02:43.860> and<00:02:44.100> the<00:02:44.280> one<00:02:44.400> in<00:02:44.550> the<00:02:44.610> middle<00:02:44.850> is

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
the side and the one in the middle is

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:49.220
