00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
like wondering what was going to be the

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.930 
like wondering what was going to be the
best<00:00:12.090> spike<00:00:12.630> since<00:00:13.019> 4.3<00:00:14.009> was<00:00:14.219> arms<00:00:14.730> all<00:00:14.910> the

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
best spike since 4.3 was arms all the

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.260 
best spike since 4.3 was arms all the
way<00:00:15.740> so<00:00:16.740> i<00:00:16.770> did<00:00:17.039> some<00:00:17.070> dummy<00:00:17.580> tests<00:00:18.060> and

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
way so i did some dummy tests and

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.450 
way so i did some dummy tests and
figured<00:00:18.630> out<00:00:18.720> which<00:00:19.140> back<00:00:19.500> is<00:00:19.680> better<00:00:19.920> and<00:00:20.279> the

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
figured out which back is better and the

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.310 
figured out which back is better and the
reason<00:00:20.880> why<00:00:21.090> it<00:00:21.449> is<00:00:21.630> better<00:00:21.900> than<00:00:22.140> the<00:00:22.289> other

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
reason why it is better than the other

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.340 
reason why it is better than the other
spy<00:00:22.850> so<00:00:23.850> I'm<00:00:23.939> just<00:00:24.150> going<00:00:24.449> to<00:00:24.570> go<00:00:24.689> ahead<00:00:24.960> and

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
spy so I'm just going to go ahead and

spoil the ending for you and say fury

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.009 
spoil the ending for you and say fury
will<00:00:28.140> be<00:00:28.349> better<00:00:28.560> than<00:00:28.890> arms<00:00:29.689> even<00:00:30.689> with<00:00:30.869> the

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
will be better than arms even with the

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.920 
will be better than arms even with the
one<00:00:31.199> percent<00:00:32.070> crit<00:00:32.399> bonus<00:00:32.880> wardens<00:00:33.390> get<00:00:33.660> from

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
one percent crit bonus wardens get from

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.709 
one percent crit bonus wardens get from
the<00:00:34.079> ratio<00:00:34.469> my<00:00:34.800> arms<00:00:35.160> warrior<00:00:35.540> couldn't<00:00:36.540> beat

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
the ratio my arms warrior couldn't beat

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.410 
the ratio my arms warrior couldn't beat
the<00:00:36.899> fury<00:00:37.230> and<00:00:37.469> the<00:00:38.340> reason<00:00:38.760> for<00:00:38.790> this<00:00:39.120> is<00:00:39.180> the

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
the fury and the reason for this is the

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.680 
the fury and the reason for this is the
following<00:00:39.770> so<00:00:40.770> arms<00:00:41.280> is<00:00:41.430> still<00:00:41.670> a<00:00:41.700> really<00:00:42.090> good

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
following so arms is still a really good

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.440 
following so arms is still a really good
spike<00:00:43.140> but<00:00:43.620> really<00:00:44.070> dependable<00:00:44.610> on<00:00:44.850> prox<00:00:45.180> if

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
spike but really dependable on prox if

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.420 
spike but really dependable on prox if
you<00:00:45.570> don't<00:00:45.780> pro<00:00:46.079> can<00:00:46.289> overpower<00:00:46.620> when<00:00:47.280> you

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
you don't pro can overpower when you

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.459 
you don't pro can overpower when you
don't<00:00:47.670> have<00:00:47.789> rage<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.420> gaff<00:00:48.600> like<00:00:48.870> three

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
don't have rage the gaff like three

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.860 
don't have rage the gaff like three
slams<00:00:49.920> or<00:00:50.160> two<00:00:50.370> slams<00:00:50.730> in<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.030> Colossus<00:00:51.570> mash

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
slams or two slams in the Colossus mash

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.920 
slams or two slams in the Colossus mash
you<00:00:52.800> will<00:00:52.949> find<00:00:53.250> yourself<00:00:53.670> just<00:00:54.270> sitting

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
you will find yourself just sitting

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.040 
you will find yourself just sitting
there<00:00:55.070> since<00:00:56.070> mortal<00:00:56.730> strike<00:00:57.030> is<00:00:57.270> like<00:00:57.480> a<00:00:57.510> six

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
there since mortal strike is like a six

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.720 
there since mortal strike is like a six
second<00:00:58.500> cooldown<00:01:00.320> so<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.649> thing<00:01:01.920> with<00:01:02.340> arms

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
second cooldown so the thing with arms

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.479 
second cooldown so the thing with arms
is<00:01:02.910> in<00:01:03.300> my<00:01:03.570> opinion<00:01:03.719> that<00:01:04.229> it<00:01:05.100> isn't

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
is in my opinion that it isn't

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.969 
is in my opinion that it isn't
guaranteed<00:01:05.729> to<00:01:06.299> give<00:01:06.479> you<00:01:06.630> solid<00:01:07.320> numbers

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
guaranteed to give you solid numbers

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.700 
guaranteed to give you solid numbers
sometimes<00:01:08.520> you<00:01:08.939> can<00:01:09.119> pull<00:01:09.360> like<00:01:09.479> 50k<00:01:10.170> and

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
sometimes you can pull like 50k and

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.070 
sometimes you can pull like 50k and
sometimes<00:01:11.340> people<00:01:11.700> 30k<00:01:12.360> and<00:01:12.600> it's<00:01:12.750> all

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
sometimes people 30k and it's all

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.410 
sometimes people 30k and it's all
because<00:01:13.110> of<00:01:13.590> brock's<00:01:14.100> which<00:01:14.369> would<00:01:14.610> just

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
because of brock's which would just

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.320 
because of brock's which would just
simply<00:01:15.659> do<00:01:16.020> not<00:01:16.049> have<00:01:16.320> any<00:01:16.590> control<00:01:16.830> over<00:01:17.330> fury

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
simply do not have any control over fury

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.230 
simply do not have any control over fury
is<00:01:18.450> better<00:01:18.840> in<00:01:19.080> this<00:01:19.320> since<00:01:19.860> you<00:01:20.580> have<00:01:20.939> an
