00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:05.910
 had we commented on this a little video 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:10.519
 to show these kitchens sound 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.519
 for the kind of how to see 

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:18.900
 they are the same ones that I put in me 

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:18.900
 on a journey 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.390
 ah 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:29.210
 they have 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:32.050
 very good seen 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.050
 They are beautiful 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.340
 lemon 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.859
 60 watts rms 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:49.540
 Really 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:54.960
 They sound pretty good pretty sound 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:54.960
 it's pretty clean to write as they say 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:58.520
 well 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:04.260
 they are a very good option 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.470
 I found them approximately 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.470
 by 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:12.550
 50 dollars up probably to the 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:15.610
 60 dollars you find on ebay amazon 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:18.070
 all these places 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:21.540
 in sonic electronics you do not find 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:24.470
 $ 58 approximately 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.470
 and because these 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.390
 I want to take them hold 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:35.610
 for $ 45 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:39.170
 90 dollars the pair forgive the two sets 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.170
 that come with four speakers 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:45.660
 a good price good quality 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.640
 you will not find it I doubt that 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.390
 find a better speaker for that 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.420
 price 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:54.960
 of course there are enough speakers but 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:58.799
 of higher quality than these but with 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.799
 also higher price 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.540
 Well this is a good option for 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.539
 to improve your system for example if 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.900
 you have all the horns of your car 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:15.360
 originals this is a good option for 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:17.700
 add really you will love the 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.410
 productions are heard pretty clean 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.750
 sound 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.950
 after 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.849
 or he 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.849
 they bring their 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.579
 protective 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.579
 because they do not go to bathe 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:38.080
 do not scratch or anything 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.080
 they are going to stick 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:44.440
 quite 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:46.510
 pretty good looking in acb 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.270
 and for the price I repeat, I do not think 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.850
 find some better and if you find 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:54.400
 some better because you also let me know 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:56.710
 I would normally like to know what type 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.200
 speaker and personally if you and 

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:02.440
 callas dismisses the listening test 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:05.440
 you hear it better then we could 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:08.670
 share a little ideas and then this 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:12.630
 it's one of the speakers that I've had 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.630
 they really sound pretty good 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:21.060
 because I liked everything 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:23.750
 listen listen very well 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.750
 but 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:29.040
 If you want to buy a 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:32.110
 of very good quality in those if you 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.700
 it's going to cost a good job 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:38.430
 are a little expensive these are the 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.430
 of the prime edition 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:44.420
 it really sounds very good are the 

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:48.590
 same the same walsh that has 60 60 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:51.099
 of nc 120 the most that really does not 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:51.099
 it means nothing 

00:03:53.020 --> 00:04:00.650
 just have a good view you see 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:03.930
 well, but I was 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:06.130
 he withdraws from me 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:10.170
 of my car because wells 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:14.040
 and it's going to be a project for this kind of 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:17.820
 horns because these are 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:21.239
 I tried to do everything for this but 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:24.139
 they are really very big and they look 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:27.460
 really horrible 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:32.210
 and then I decided to buy some smaller ones 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:36.770
 and well, really, they sound good 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:38.810
 they have quite low they are heard in the 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:40.129
 country and you hear more better in this that 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:43.789
 in that 

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:46.759
 but the voice and the jumps are heard 

00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:48.910
 better in that one you hear clearer 

00:04:46.759 --> 00:04:51.690
 in this 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:51.690
 Really 

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:57.400
 It is also a good kitchen 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:59.249
 this I will occupy for my next 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:01.430
 draft 

00:04:59.249 --> 00:05:04.070
 and then for now 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:06.490
 so I leave this video because 

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:10.409
 it seemed today as he comments 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:13.100
 How about you if you have them 

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:14.930
 this one was in your car 

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:18.860
 Well I would like to know what is your 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:23.409
 opinion if they are bad 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:27.050
 now it sounded pretty good enough 

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:29.000
 clean sound peter paul and well then 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:32.030
 an experience because I have 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.340
 installed now the 619 in the part 

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:37.520
 in front and I have them in the part 

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:40.639
 rear of the vehicle are the 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:43.009
 doors and I really like more how it 

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:45.650
 listen you're in the back that 

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:48.889
 the others the others swim quite low 

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:51.520
 but this average news under and everything 

00:05:48.889 --> 00:05:51.520
 completely
