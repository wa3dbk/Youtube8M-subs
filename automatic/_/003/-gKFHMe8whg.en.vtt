00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
you're going to fold it back up so it's

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.940 
you're going to fold it back up so it's
kind<00:03:48.209> of<00:03:48.270> starting<00:03:48.780> to<00:03:48.810> roll<00:03:49.170> what<00:03:49.830> you're

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
kind of starting to roll what you're

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:50.930 
kind of starting to roll what you're
going<00:03:50.070> to<00:03:50.100> do<00:03:50.250> is<00:03:50.340> you're<00:03:50.459> going<00:03:50.550> to<00:03:50.610> take<00:03:50.820> this

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
going to do is you're going to take this

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.000 
material material and you're going to
roll<00:03:53.340> it<00:03:53.550> around<00:03:53.790> the<00:03:54.150> center<00:03:54.630> so<00:03:55.440> then<00:03:55.680> you

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
roll it around the center so then you

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.670 
roll it around the center so then you
just<00:03:56.220> twist<00:03:56.400> the<00:03:56.970> material<00:03:57.480> and<00:03:57.720> about<00:03:58.230> every

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
just twist the material and about every

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.370 
just twist the material and about every
half<00:03:58.950> of<00:03:59.489> a<00:03:59.850> rotation<00:04:00.030> you<00:04:00.630> put<00:04:00.840> a<00:04:00.870> little<00:04:01.170> dab

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.380 
half of a rotation you put a little dab

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:08.420 
half of a rotation you put a little dab
of<00:04:01.590> glue<00:04:02.600> on<00:04:03.600> your<00:04:06.140> material<00:04:07.140> and<00:04:07.400> then<00:04:08.400> you

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
of glue on your material and then you

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:12.229 
of glue on your material and then you
keep<00:04:08.670> rolling<00:04:09.600> and<00:04:10.610> be<00:04:11.610> really<00:04:11.850> careful

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 
keep rolling and be really careful

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:14.900 
keep rolling and be really careful
because<00:04:12.440> it's<00:04:13.440> really<00:04:13.680> easy<00:04:13.860> to<00:04:14.010> get<00:04:14.280> burnt

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
because it's really easy to get burnt

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:17.060 
because it's really easy to get burnt
doing<00:04:15.239> this<00:04:15.440> so<00:04:16.440> you<00:04:16.530> just<00:04:16.709> want<00:04:16.890> to<00:04:16.919> use<00:04:17.040> a

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:06.180 
fold the rosette onto the back so that

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:08.750 
fold the rosette onto the back so that
kind<00:05:07.050> of<00:05:07.080> finishes<00:05:07.560> it<00:05:07.680> off<00:05:07.800> a<00:05:08.160> little<00:05:08.220> bit<00:05:08.490> and

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:13.610 
it gives your glue a little bit of

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:16.280 
it gives your glue a little bit of
backing<00:05:14.610> so<00:05:14.910> that<00:05:15.090> it<00:05:15.240> will<00:05:15.360> stick<00:05:15.960> onto<00:05:16.110> the

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:16.290 
backing so that it will stick onto the

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:18.710 
backing so that it will stick onto the
board<00:05:16.500> a<00:05:16.680> little<00:05:16.889> bit<00:05:17.010> better<00:05:17.479> so<00:05:18.479> it<00:05:18.570> looks
