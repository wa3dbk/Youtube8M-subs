00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:14.030
 it is better to consume whole grains for 

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:17.539
 many reasons 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:19.760
 then one of these is for example that i 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:22.640
 cereals and refined I take as an example 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:25.099
 white rice has a glycemic index 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:28.070
 higher then to this capacity of 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:32.300
 raise blood sugar levels in 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:35.000
 faster and does not do 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:37.370
 absolutely fine to the body for that 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.200
 busts completely this work 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:42.200
 insulin no of this hormone which 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:44.630
 then he will have to go to lower the level 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.340
 of blood glucose to bring back 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:48.670
 the balance 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:51.440
 another reason is what 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:53.660
 first of all mother nature gave us a 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.250
 cereal gave it to us intact for which 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.380
 I don't see why the man then 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:01.220
 should go and deprive him of those 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:03.980
 substances that we basically need 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:06.920
 to enjoy good health 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.840
 second then in recent years in the 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.840
 our power supply having eliminated 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.880
 almost all the fibers we went to 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.550
 encounter with intestinal diseases or 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:20.570
 intestinal also very serious as for 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:23.630
 example colon cancer where some 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:28.220
 studies have found that just for 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:30.770
 lack of these let's call them activities 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.360
 of sweepers don't actually what they do 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.190
 the fibers do not actually come 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:38.630
 assimilated are not digested but 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:40.940
 act as scavengers for ours 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.070
 intestine and therefore actually serve but 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:45.580
 serve in them taken in their 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:48.140
 integrity these fibers do not have to be 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:50.080
 extrapolated extracted from the food 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.310
 because then I hear so many people that 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.320
 in the morning take for example the 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.360
 oat bran or wheat bran 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.000
 but not good the food must be 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:02.720
 consumed cereal cereal means 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.450
 the grain is not kellogg's not things 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:09.110
 commercial that other is about goes 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:11.390
 consumed in its entirety because 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:14.420
 contains all the all nutrients 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:17.360
 of which we need there are elements that 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.700
 we are going to take away with the process 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.560
 of refining which are trace elements and 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.050
 the fibers 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.330
 minerals and what remains is the 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.700
 core of this cereal of this 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.680
 grain that contains predominantly 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.170
 starches and therefore we deprive ourselves of 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.739
 really essential nutrients for the 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.739
 our well-being
