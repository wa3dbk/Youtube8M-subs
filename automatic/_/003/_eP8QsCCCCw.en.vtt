00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:06.029
 hi to all youtube friends here at 97 and 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.740
 as I promised you the next video 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.620
 it would have been the mockery of the satellite 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.219
 light and type of hard and satin the great 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:16.020
 food 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:18.420
 I premise I do n't have the oases e 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.460
 probably the 2 oasis 2 will play 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.519
 in this version, however, I am alone 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.099
 three with and then call to talk and 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:29.699
 let's move on to the dec 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:32.399
 we have triple darkness obviously motor 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:35.010
 of the deck the best start ie part of 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:39.239
 of the interior you have to leave only this 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:42.629
 bunch slow he marks you a bus a 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.640
 tyler knight from the former sum would be 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.050
 nice that it also marked the truck spello 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.440
 fashions 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.840
 then three altair this here the wolfpack 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:56.250
 of the deck and why not when it comes 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.899
 summoned summoned from the satellite graveyard 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.780
 in defense and therefore also the effect starts 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.609
 of the satellite then I play double nape 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.210
 you have it not for three because the third 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:08.670
 heavy and never let flaw 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:12.630
 foolish practically evoked and sick 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:14.310
 etc. sati frank in March is a 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.890
 excellent to start also with a nucleus 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:20.090
 today or in any case a calai call of the 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:24.630
 hunter like last monsters game 2 vega 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:25.979
 because I don't play on the east or other cards 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.380
 so simply because I don't 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.540
 like and if you see it without it 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.220
 monsters and a very ugly card then 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.310
 I want to play for this 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:38.060
 spa version never lacking a way 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.140
 ndoci in alta will therefore show 10 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:43.229
 the vega effect that when it comes 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.700
 summoned could additional 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.970
 the special we are additional of a 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:52.500
 satellite from the dead pobega proxies e 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:55.200
 sure but then spell triple rota xkè la 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:58.049
 konami let us play 3 good I would say 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:04.020
 the best if chino and then the globe 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:06.270
 start the 1000 not only this much from 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.770
 giving to the opponent, however, is essential 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.269
 to enjoy 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:13.459
 en v other cards then triple typhoon 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:16.220
 essentially for clifford who killed 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:19.150
 with whom you have a match for those not a little 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:21.290
 very positive and double pod 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.700
 now I'll explain why double pod 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:27.680
 then you can strong and I like it very much 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:30.500
 but not 3 because this deck if not 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:33.769
 does the special loses because if you lose then 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:36.590
 turlo so I always decide but it is a 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:39.730
 excellent start and anyway like cards that 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:42.769
 giacomo the social and jackie game copies 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:45.680
 and jackie because it's the card I like 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:48.560
 a lot later in everybody crazy and social 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.180
 because all the effects of the 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.579
 monsters because they say when they come 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:57.170
 evoked so it's really strong 

00:02:52.579 --> 00:03:00.349
 so this is behind traps 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:03.260
 we have the triple camper that is left 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:05.660
 to the new very strong alpha alloy 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:09.940
 anything paying a sister 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:14.660
 claire and fishing even one so cool 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:16.459
 the pussy is there but then the triple with the solo 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:20.090
 because a cassano will not play 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:23.989
 probably the joke is very strong 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:27.950
 why and if you used the alpha e 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:32.480
 with you can bet triple again 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:34.940
 fiemme says why it is ennis because of 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.620
 this character here the why is of 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:39.230
 this character here the thriller 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:42.200
 because if you bounce proud of the drain 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:45.549
 crimes after the first set was the 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:49.940
 then continues to too strong then play 

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:50.630
 double bug and it's double prison though 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:53.269
 there is a though 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:56.630
 probably if I had the dare I would take it off 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:04:00.560
 a bug is probably a call 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:02.870
 to put two oases and the third is the 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:05.630
 prison meteor meteor star 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:07.609
 probably then the moment 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:09.120
 the stop so hectic pretty good then 

00:04:07.609 --> 00:04:11.700
 when I have the oases 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:15.169
 text different way then game 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:19.500
 let 's say the staples that are compulsive 

00:04:15.169 --> 00:04:23.910
 bottoms warning and soul drenthe mail 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:28.320
 because you have to start with something more 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:31.850
 of shadow and trouble of if not I am otherwise 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:35.340
 Somali to lomazzo stronger here 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:38.190
 let's move on to the extra xtrac we have 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:41.190
 double-free in a temple drain boats 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:45.330
 never exaggerated 2 is fine is a tea 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:47.460
 roscoe méxes really know the approach 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:51.419
 walking the schalke and the diamond 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:54.389
 we'll see then a double castle 

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:56.729
 but with the funds ruin there you do more 

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:57.270
 often this deck we say together with 

00:04:56.729 --> 00:05:02.310
 river 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:06.600
 2 l then excalibur which is the only out that 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:10.889
 to this deck achille then cowboy that 

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:14.580
 sails to exito 101 to the cultured area 

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:18.510
 clifford 85 subscribe enough 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:20.970
 vuolo and with the ground and the better draco 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:22.849
 nice is the paper 

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:25.950
 good so that's ok 

00:05:22.849 --> 00:05:27.330
 here this is the give then file of 

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:29.669
 satellite 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:35.990
 I hope you enjoyed it if there is 

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:38.340
 liked to ask 250 250 like and 

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:42.260
 new Year New Life 

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:44.820
 so we hope to do a lot of tops 

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:47.669
 weak back even with this deck that 

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:49.490
 I absolutely forgot it myself 

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:53.220
 really like to play this deck 

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:56.820
 even if it is not drained, however, there is 

00:05:53.220 --> 00:06:00.440
 there is and has omitted 2 to the suit and not 

00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:04.349
 it was therefore the fucking thing that lives with it 

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:05.340
 He knows where duty here are you 

00:06:04.349 --> 00:06:08.010
 angry 

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:09.810
 I don't like media too much 

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:11.160
 the old ones in fact don't play either 

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:14.190
 one 

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:16.500
 and the strong deck with the excess of Milan 

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:19.320
 there have been a lot of it has not been messed 

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:21.389
 but it is a very valid deck with sylvie 

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:26.310
 also fit for the price enough 

00:06:21.389 --> 00:06:29.729
 therefore reduced here from 97 we know if the 

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:33.620
 video you liked 250 300 likes and us 

00:06:29.729 --> 00:06:33.620
 let's see with a nice video next
