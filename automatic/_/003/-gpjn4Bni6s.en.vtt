00:00:59.770 --> 00:00:59.780 
charge it but I'm assuming some people

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:01.330 
charge it but I'm assuming some people
with<00:00:59.899> Android<00:01:00.260> would<00:01:00.410> like<00:01:00.620> this<00:01:00.829> option<00:01:01.219> as

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:43.940 
adjustments or swap cables and it

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:45.790 
adjustments or swap cables and it
reveals<00:01:44.240> below<00:01:44.660> the<00:01:44.840> cable<00:01:45.140> management<00:01:45.290> which

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:45.800 
reveals below the cable management which

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.770 
reveals below the cable management which
does<00:01:46.130> a<00:01:46.340> very<00:01:46.580> nice<00:01:46.760> job<00:01:46.820> of<00:01:47.180> keeping<00:01:47.330> this<00:01:47.600> all

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
does a very nice job of keeping this all

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.230 
does a very nice job of keeping this all
contained<00:01:48.230> so<00:01:49.220> we<00:01:49.370> slide<00:01:49.610> the<00:01:49.790> cable<00:01:49.970> up

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
contained so we slide the cable up

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.700 
contained so we slide the cable up
inside<00:01:50.600> and<00:01:50.900> you<00:01:50.960> just<00:01:51.110> want<00:01:51.290> to<00:01:51.350> seat<00:01:51.500> it<00:01:51.620> out

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:51.710 
inside and you just want to seat it out

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:53.260 
inside and you just want to seat it out
a<00:01:51.740> little<00:01:52.010> ways<00:01:52.250> and<00:01:52.520> then<00:01:52.580> you're<00:01:53.090> going<00:01:53.180> to

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
a little ways and then you're going to

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.020 
a little ways and then you're going to
locate<00:01:53.630> your<00:01:53.780> clip<00:01:54.140> either<00:01:54.440> a<00:01:54.530> 0<00:01:54.920> 2<00:01:55.040> or<00:01:55.580> 5<00:01:55.820> which

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
locate your clip either a 0 2 or 5 which

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:57.730 
locate your clip either a 0 2 or 5 which
indicates<00:01:56.510> the<00:01:56.660> millimeters<00:01:57.140> that<00:01:57.410> it<00:01:57.500> allows

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
indicates the millimeters that it allows

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.800 
indicates the millimeters that it allows
the<00:01:57.770> cable<00:01:58.310> to<00:01:58.400> slip<00:01:58.640> through<00:01:58.910> so<00:01:59.450> that<00:01:59.600> it<00:01:59.690> can

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
the cable to slip through so that it can

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.840 
the cable to slip through so that it can
adapt<00:02:00.080> to<00:02:00.320> fit<00:02:00.710> any<00:02:00.980> kind<00:02:01.160> of<00:02:01.280> case<00:02:01.520> or<00:02:01.730> any

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
adapt to fit any kind of case or any

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.360 
adapt to fit any kind of case or any
situation<00:02:02.420> that<00:02:02.450> you<00:02:02.630> need<00:02:03.070> depending<00:02:04.070> on<00:02:04.160> how

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:04.370 
situation that you need depending on how

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:06.010 
situation that you need depending on how
far<00:02:04.550> you<00:02:04.610> need<00:02:04.880> the<00:02:05.030> cable<00:02:05.360> actually<00:02:05.630> to<00:02:05.870> reach

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
far you need the cable actually to reach

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.800 
far you need the cable actually to reach
out<00:02:06.610> so<00:02:07.610> we<00:02:07.760> just<00:02:07.970> slide<00:02:08.149> this<00:02:08.330> little<00:02:08.479> clip

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
out so we just slide this little clip

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:10.570 
out so we just slide this little clip
over<00:02:09.140> the<00:02:09.229> edge<00:02:09.380> of<00:02:09.560> your<00:02:09.619> Lightning<00:02:10.039> cord<00:02:10.340> and

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
over the edge of your Lightning cord and

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.700 
over the edge of your Lightning cord and
slide<00:02:11.150> it<00:02:11.330> up<00:02:11.510> towards<00:02:11.870> the<00:02:12.050> tip<00:02:12.260> and<00:02:12.470> you<00:02:12.590> will

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:12.710 
slide it up towards the tip and you will

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:14.230 
slide it up towards the tip and you will
see<00:02:12.890> it<00:02:13.010> just<00:02:13.190> reveals<00:02:13.370> just<00:02:13.730> a<00:02:13.880> little<00:02:14.060> tiny

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:14.240 
see it just reveals just a little tiny

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.010 
see it just reveals just a little tiny
bit

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
bit

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.110 
bit
and<00:02:15.110> we<00:02:15.950> will<00:02:16.070> go<00:02:16.220> ahead<00:02:16.310> and<00:02:16.430> try<00:02:16.670> it<00:02:16.700> with<00:02:16.820> our

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
and we will go ahead and try it with our

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.210 
and we will go ahead and try it with our
case<00:02:17.330> on<00:02:17.570> to<00:02:17.810> make<00:02:17.990> sure<00:02:18.020> that<00:02:18.530> it<00:02:18.740> does<00:02:18.950> fit

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
case on to make sure that it does fit

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.250 
case on to make sure that it does fit
nicely<00:02:19.460> I<00:02:19.820> did<00:02:20.120> do<00:02:20.270> this<00:02:20.450> while<00:02:20.600> plugged<00:02:20.900> in<00:02:21.110> to

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
nicely I did do this while plugged in to

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:22.630 
nicely I did do this while plugged in to
make<00:02:21.410> sure<00:02:21.560> it<00:02:21.680> did<00:02:21.830> make<00:02:21.980> a<00:02:22.160> good<00:02:22.370> connection

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
make sure it did make a good connection

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.610 
make sure it did make a good connection
and<00:02:23.060> the<00:02:23.480> thing<00:02:23.660> was<00:02:23.750> actually<00:02:23.990> charging

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
and the thing was actually charging

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.730 
and the thing was actually charging
before<00:02:24.740> I<00:02:24.920> put<00:02:25.160> this<00:02:25.280> all<00:02:25.490> back<00:02:25.700> in<00:02:25.880> together

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:26.740 
before I put this all back in together

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.110 
before I put this all back in together
so<00:02:27.740> now<00:02:27.950> that<00:02:28.010> we<00:02:28.250> see<00:02:28.460> that<00:02:28.640> we<00:02:28.790> have<00:02:28.940> the

little wobble in the stand and I had to

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.470 
little wobble in the stand and I had to
start<00:02:54.380> over<00:02:54.530> again<00:02:54.910> so<00:02:55.910> then<00:02:56.060> we'll<00:02:56.270> go<00:02:56.300> ahead

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
start over again so then we'll go ahead

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.060 
start over again so then we'll go ahead
and<00:02:56.600> put<00:02:56.870> this<00:02:57.020> little<00:02:57.080> piece<00:02:57.410> of<00:02:57.650> plastic

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:58.070 
and put this little piece of plastic

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:00.220 
and put this little piece of plastic
over<00:02:58.310> the<00:02:58.430> top<00:02:58.460> here<00:02:58.970> that<00:02:59.000> closes<00:02:59.750> it<00:02:59.930> all<00:03:00.050> and

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
over the top here that closes it all and
