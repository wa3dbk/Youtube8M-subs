this is the mashing in of the grain you

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.190 
this is the mashing in of the grain you
make<00:01:47.190> a<00:01:47.220> big<00:01:47.490> pot<00:01:47.729> of<00:01:47.789> oatmeal<00:01:48.149> pretty<00:01:49.049> much<00:01:49.170> a

consistency of oatmeal with your

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.109 
consistency of oatmeal with your
watering<00:01:51.299> your<00:01:51.479> grains<00:01:51.780> and<00:01:52.250> then<00:01:53.250> you<00:01:53.429> run

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
watering your grains and then you run

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.449 
watering your grains and then you run
hot<00:01:54.420> water<00:01:54.450> across<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.500> top<00:01:55.860> of<00:01:56.039> that<00:01:56.220> which

00:01:56.449 --> 00:01:56.459 
hot water across the top of that which

00:01:56.459 --> 00:01:59.779 
hot water across the top of that which
would<00:01:56.670> be<00:01:56.880> and<00:01:57.090> 168<00:01:58.049> degree<00:01:58.500> range<00:01:58.789> generally

00:01:59.779 --> 00:01:59.789 
would be and 168 degree range generally

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:02.960 
would be and 168 degree range generally
have<00:02:00.000> a<00:02:00.030> false<00:02:00.539> bottom<00:02:00.810> and<00:02:01.259> your<00:02:02.250> mash<00:02:02.580> tun

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 
have a false bottom and your mash tun

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.660 
have a false bottom and your mash tun
and<00:02:03.240> that's<00:02:03.959> where<00:02:04.200> you<00:02:04.229> get<00:02:04.439> the<00:02:04.679> liquid<00:02:05.429> work

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
and that's where you get the liquid work

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.320 
and that's where you get the liquid work
looking<00:02:06.450> pretty<00:02:06.479> nice<00:02:06.899> now

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
looking pretty nice now

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.410 
looking pretty nice now
you<00:02:09.170> run<00:02:09.500> that<00:02:09.650> over<00:02:09.680> to<00:02:09.979> a<00:02:10.009> kettle<00:02:10.400> you<00:02:11.060> boil

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
you run that over to a kettle you boil

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.480 
you run that over to a kettle you boil
that<00:02:11.720> and<00:02:12.020> add<00:02:12.200> hops<00:02:12.470> at<00:02:12.800> various<00:02:13.250> stages

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 
that and add hops at various stages

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:15.700 
that and add hops at various stages
today<00:02:14.210> we're<00:02:14.390> making<00:02:14.480> an<00:02:14.720> IPA<00:02:15.080> so<00:02:15.200> there's

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:15.710 
today we're making an IPA so there's

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:19.180 
today we're making an IPA so there's
lots<00:02:15.950> of<00:02:16.280> flavor<00:02:16.700> hops<00:02:17.090> and<00:02:17.450> aroma<00:02:18.050> hops<00:02:18.320> this
