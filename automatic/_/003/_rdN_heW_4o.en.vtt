00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:11.400
 saw another budget 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:15.629
 the diet decided to share how to do it 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:20.779
 just for minimal money and so that 

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:24.419
 it was not a pity if others are a threat 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:25.220
 so hardly sure that they know all the piece 

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:28.410
 tubules 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:31.940
 wound sharply piece of rubber 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:35.360
 which or notch which fixes 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:38.700
 the depth we need 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.980
 here the usual shelf is attached well 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.720
 have this option learn many not 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:51.860
 I will talk about him for a long time because 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:56.340
 This is a famous variant of the winter wife sector. 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:01:00.540
 out of the situation when you need to leave 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:05.149
 for the night on 2 pike sterns and so 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:10.829
 it was not a pity if suddenly they snagged 

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:14.130
 need a piece of plastic wood 

00:01:10.829 --> 00:01:16.260
 unacceptable for the reason that she will 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.010
 float and you just need the flow of plastic 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:22.620
 no matter what 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:24.600
 a piece of any thickness is the only thing 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:27.020
 need this tree to drill here 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.380
 this hole and so what we do 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:35.930
 cut from a piece of plastic 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:38.610
 rectangle when we rectangle 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:42.170
 naturally he will have to sink in 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.409
 well, so we need a piece 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:48.450
 strings 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:52.500
 durable desirable silk we his 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:55.130
 just tying a knot we just do 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.130
 ring 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:04.110
 ordinary ring 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:09.530
 ring method loop in loop we 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.530
 We attach this to our plate 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:21.110
 later we fixed it 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.110
 prune personal 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.530
 You can melt down here so that it does not 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.530
 fell down 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:40.320
 such a question later flu 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:43.580
 by preparing in advance or cutting out the usual 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:47.490
 wand length slightly wider than the hole 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:50.310
 from any bush just as we do 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:52.260
 loop we pass a stick here which 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:03:01.370
 we will lay down for the magazine 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:03:01.370
 we take the line for the concert loop and 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:11.280
 same hole exactly the same 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:17.010
 fasten it to our piece of plastic 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:19.760
 there is a loop through the reel here 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.760
 noose 

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:32.730
 so we fixed our flash drive she 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:36.690
 It turns out next to the rope is not 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:38.810
 makes no difference and so here's the beginning 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:41.580
 our stupid person 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.900
 the length of dependence we need 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:45.690
 reservoir depths 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.590
 if the pond there up to three to five meters 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:50.190
 that 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:52.890
 7 meters of fishing line is absolutely enough 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:55.200
 if we mean depths more 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:58.200
 five with we give three four five meters 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:00.140
 plus to come here when sleepy 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:03.210
 lies down a little 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:09.960
 quietly pay him not feel 

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:13.200
 tension and being caught now before 

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:22.880
 than we begin to wind the risks we take 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:22.880
 either a regular match toothpick 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:31.170
 match is likely to be more simple 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:34.280
 option and reel we need 

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:37.440
 the amount of leaf on our future home 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:43.040
 I have not measured now just showing 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:43.040
 so we match our match to 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:05:04.850
 plastic base here we reeled 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:04.850
 the amount we needed was cut off 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:21.660
 here we pour our friend do a loop 

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:23.400
 under the leash I already told it all 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:25.710
 their rollers so repeat not 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:29.880
 I will have our eyelet to 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:33.960
 Rate here leash pages 2 dichkov 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:38.009
 This I already told important interesting 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:42.690
 and an important point now when we measured 

00:05:38.009 --> 00:05:45.860
 the depth we need is just that 

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:52.080
 match which she will take here 

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:55.470
 pass through the rest of the news which 

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:57.030
 to which the depth is measured and we lower 

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:59.849
 why am I saying that this thing should 

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:02.270
 fit because we're just 

00:05:59.849 --> 00:06:08.150
 we drop the hole 

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:08.150
 here through the loop is better through the loop 

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:13.050
 we hang our 

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:17.750
 cut out the stick omit this case 

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:17.750
 well it lies on top of our taxes 

00:06:19.039 --> 00:06:26.310
 the system is very simple 

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:31.860
 bite pike pulls fishing line 

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:36.930
 from under the matches and pike walk so much 

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:43.889
 how much and give me back a very option 

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:46.490
 what is the minimum cost if there are not many 

00:06:43.889 --> 00:06:49.470
 time for the riser to follow the flags 

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:54.889
 such a zherlitsu not sorry that all costs 

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:58.460
 this is a leaf leash and double or tee 

00:06:54.889 --> 00:07:00.300
 actually here's an option 

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:03.169
 winter night 

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:06.919
 imitation check ipad match 

00:07:03.169 --> 00:07:08.460
 fixed we need to depth 

00:07:06.919 --> 00:07:12.720
 hand style 

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:15.270
 glands floats when biting pulls off 

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:18.740
 she's worth it so itâ€™s collected 

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:18.740
 and uncoiling the fishing line 

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:27.340
 we came checked everything in place 

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:32.129
 a place if you eat there is such an option 

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:32.129
 budget winter fry
