00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:32.090 
us the belt routing it may have been on

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:33.580 
us the belt routing it may have been on
here<00:00:32.300> at<00:00:32.390> some<00:00:32.570> point<00:00:32.840> maybe<00:00:33.079> on<00:00:33.260> this<00:00:33.350> inner

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:33.590 
here at some point maybe on this inner

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.790 
here at some point maybe on this inner
box<00:00:33.770> but<00:00:34.129> it's<00:00:34.969> not<00:00:35.180> here<00:00:35.500> most<00:00:36.500> of<00:00:36.590> you<00:00:36.680> have

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:36.800 
box but it's not here most of you have

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.889 
box but it's not here most of you have
cell<00:00:37.010> phones<00:00:37.280> or<00:00:37.489> small<00:00:38.120> digital<00:00:38.329> cameras

00:00:38.889 --> 00:00:38.899 
cell phones or small digital cameras

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:42.310 
cell phones or small digital cameras
just<00:00:39.499> take<00:00:39.739> a<00:00:39.769> shot<00:00:40.160> of<00:00:40.879> how<00:00:41.480> the<00:00:41.539> belts<00:00:41.929> routed

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:42.320 
just take a shot of how the belts routed

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.889 
just take a shot of how the belts routed
and<00:00:42.410> be<00:00:42.559> very<00:00:42.710> easy<00:00:42.980> to<00:00:43.100> put<00:00:43.370> back<00:00:43.550> on<00:00:43.820> so<00:00:44.809> the

00:00:44.889 --> 00:00:44.899 
and be very easy to put back on so the

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:48.549 
and be very easy to put back on so the
first<00:00:45.140> thing<00:00:45.379> we<00:00:45.530> do<00:00:46.719> get<00:00:47.719> our<00:00:47.839> tool<00:00:48.140> with<00:00:48.530> a

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:48.559 
first thing we do get our tool with a

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:50.649 
first thing we do get our tool with a
small<00:00:48.859> extension<00:00:49.249> and<00:00:50.059> there's<00:00:50.239> a<00:00:50.300> square

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:50.659 
small extension and there's a square

00:00:50.659 --> 00:00:55.509 
small extension and there's a square
hole<00:00:53.050> inside<00:00:54.050> this<00:00:54.260> tensioner<00:00:54.769> just<00:00:55.339> like

00:00:55.509 --> 00:00:55.519 
hole inside this tensioner just like

00:00:55.519 --> 00:01:00.309 
hole inside this tensioner just like
that<00:00:57.460> okay<00:00:58.460> so<00:00:58.850> we<00:00:59.239> pulled<00:00:59.539> the<00:00:59.749> tensioner

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:00.319 
that okay so we pulled the tensioner

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:01.689 
that okay so we pulled the tensioner
away<00:01:00.559> from<00:01:00.739> the<00:01:00.859> belts<00:01:01.159> we're<00:01:01.280> gonna<00:01:01.370> go<00:01:01.519> this

00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:01.699 
away from the belts we're gonna go this

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:05.290 
away from the belts we're gonna go this
way<00:01:01.870> see<00:01:02.870> how<00:01:02.899> it<00:01:03.109> loosens<00:01:03.440> up<00:01:03.970> easiest<00:01:04.970> one<00:01:05.150> is

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:05.300 
way see how it loosens up easiest one is

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.649 
way see how it loosens up easiest one is
the<00:01:05.420> alternator<00:01:05.810> you<00:01:05.960> can<00:01:06.110> pull<00:01:06.260> it<00:01:06.350> off<00:01:06.470> there

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:07.659 
the alternator you can pull it off there

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:10.120 
the alternator you can pull it off there
I'll<00:01:08.659> get<00:01:08.840> it<00:01:08.930> off<00:01:09.080> the<00:01:09.229> idler<00:01:09.590> now<00:01:10.010> we're

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
I'll get it off the idler now we're

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:17.440 
I'll get it off the idler now we're
gonna<00:01:10.220> release<00:01:10.430> that<00:01:10.640> tensioner

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.610 

get<00:01:18.140> it<00:01:18.260> around<00:01:18.380> all<00:01:18.710> the<00:01:18.860> pulleys<00:01:20.409> just<00:01:21.409> like

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:21.620 
get it around all the pulleys just like

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:23.770 
get it around all the pulleys just like
so<00:01:21.860> and<00:01:22.100> she's<00:01:22.250> out<00:01:22.460> now<00:01:22.970> I<00:01:23.000> will<00:01:23.270> tell<00:01:23.510> you<00:01:23.600> one

this<00:01:31.600> still<00:01:32.600> says<00:01:32.840> motor<00:01:33.110> craft<00:01:33.410> right<00:01:33.710> here<00:01:33.920> I

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
this still says motor craft right here I

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:34.900 
this still says motor craft right here I
don't<00:01:34.100> know<00:01:34.220> if<00:01:34.310> you<00:01:34.369> can<00:01:34.430> see<00:01:34.580> it<00:01:34.670> on<00:01:34.790> the

when you go around the AC compressor

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
when you go around the AC compressor
first<00:02:00.800> they're<00:02:01.800> gonna<00:02:02.010> go<00:02:02.280> around<00:02:02.670> that
