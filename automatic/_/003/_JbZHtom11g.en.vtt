00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:08.020
 rock and roll 20 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:08.020
 today 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:14.440
 36 

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:22.029
 you know 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:25.680
 but I just find destiny 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:25.680
 we are the rappers 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:32.419
 but if you are 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:35.530
 hello how about here rumian 23 commenting 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:38.720
 again and today I bring you another fashion 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:40.790
 because another fad and we talked yesterday I was going 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:43.280
 to start uploading files rescued from 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:45.260
 cinema mode then is another video that 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.660
 rescued from cinema mode I have like 12 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:54.020
 videos and 12 we are 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:58.710
 I do not lie I have 13 videos and a new one and 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:01:00.330
 nothing has happened to always talk 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.790
 I will also talk about the weapon that I am 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:05.690
 using that he used the penalty worth 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:07.860
 mention a fairly fast sub - machine gun 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.630
 arrived fairly because there are two 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.350
 Faster years 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:15.149
 and for my taste, the father wants us not to 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.820
 right but it's because I had the weapon without 

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:20.700
 kick or anything then for that 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.789
 arrived at the nba 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.950
 then the p 98 always gives me this 

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:27.659
 I did not have it on because I had it 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.030
 of 0 the weapon is what you see that does not have 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:35.039
 camouflage or anything I wear it with 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:37.640
 recoil rapid fire or accessories 

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:41.030
 kick and half red dot 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:44.390
 because recoil there are no people who do not 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:46.580
 it says because it says it's not necessary 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:50.060
 put him back because he already has 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:53.930
 a lot of cadence but it seems to me 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:56.119
 that this weapon can also be 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:58.670
 empower by killing from afar then 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:01.790
 powerful recoil what is the scope 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:04.700
 it improves a lot because 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:06.500
 shoot from afar and the bullets go almost 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.899
 all to the same place also without 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:11.229
 recoil to kill from a distance is a 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:11.229
 torture 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.460
 nothing also wanted to talk about the mp 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:20.130
 9 the mp 9 to me it seems a secondary 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:23.790
 not indispensable but I like it is 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:27.360
 pretty good because it's fast kills 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:30.030
 but that are five bullets is a lot 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.630
 but for a high school it's nothing 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.430
 why 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:36.310
 because look for example we have the 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.960
 scorpion that is not worth even for a stapler 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:43.130
 I do not like it 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:44.780
 We last fm 9 But as people 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.770
 it makes it punctual I've already picked up a lot more 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.680
 stories 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:51.430
 I use them 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.810
 and we also have the pistolitas but 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.510
 the stories that I'm not from 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:03:00.459
 pistolitas not 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:02.920
 sometimes I put my hand because the 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:06.040
 true that is also fast these are 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:10.000
 all fast but kill a bullet well 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:11.980
 given and two in in the body from one 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.830
 distance 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.770
 and long 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:19.200
 and you are seeing that I have said it as 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:22.500
 before he edged the maps from time to time 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:24.530
 I put in but it's because I'm little 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.910
 crazy 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:30.040
 first inside 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:34.050
 Kiss the time rectified and I become another 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:34.050
 once by the lips 

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:39.920
 she is ready 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.810
 Y 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:44.210
 I've seen nothing that any person 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:46.640
 your comments on the channel 

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:50.650
 good luck 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:53.310
 thank you very much any 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:56.370
 and any encouragement is 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:59.370
 I received my and I get out of fashion 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:02.530
 and as you see now I put as I already touched 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:05.069
 the model as is already making the change 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:06.740
 It is logical 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:10.280
 here 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:11.840
 it's not like I'm left like a flip hop 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.700
 is that I ran out of battery in charge 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:16.010
 the image of my battery running out 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:19.330
 of command just before killing to the beat 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:19.330
 that has been a little 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:26.590
 I hold the command hold 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:30.910
 and nothing this time I'm this video is 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:33.070
 almost almost ready to finish because 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:35.500
 from this from now on the 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:37.810
 what 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:40.390
 those who call it the fashion as well as 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:44.470
 they got a little pissed I started to be more 

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:47.440
 bad that before I do not know if it's not 13 is 14 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:49.960
 sometimes the genre but then we're going to 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:53.470
 leave until the end and so two for just 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:55.060
 a little bit of the hairs by judgments like 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:59.250
 I've told you the next videos too 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:05:01.780
 they will not be all but they will be enough more 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:03.820
 the videos you rescued from the movie mode 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:05.460
 I'm going to take advantage of those videos that 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:08.270
 I have 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:08.270
 There is in the 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:15.130
 in the mail for not to fill the 

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:17.760
 channel but for me to have videos 

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:20.020
 as initiation to the channel is that no 

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:21.880
 I will start now from the first moment 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:25.710
 here to compare weapons and that first thing 

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:27.390
 that you know me that is all 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:30.960
 the tics 

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:32.660
 and you know that this line was already 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:35.180
 nothing, I'm going to 

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:37.569
 I'm going to terminate it 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:40.089
 and nothing next video 

00:05:37.569 --> 00:05:41.870
 I promise you that it will not be a fashion will be a 

00:05:40.089 --> 00:05:46.670
 video 

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:50.510
 low or video with another weapon to 

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:52.250
 to explain you another sacas nothing you know 

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:55.490
 thank you very much for the support you know 

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:57.349
