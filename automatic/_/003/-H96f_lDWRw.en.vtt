took a reprieve from that and decided to
do<00:00:42.390> some<00:00:42.629> design<00:00:42.750> engineering<00:00:43.350> work<00:00:43.559> but<00:00:43.770> I

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
do some design engineering work but I

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.440 
do some design engineering work but I
needed<00:00:44.010> to<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.399> credentials<00:00:44.969> to<00:00:45.090> do<00:00:45.210> some<00:00:45.420> of

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
needed to the credentials to do some of

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.150 
needed to the credentials to do some of
that<00:00:45.539> particular<00:00:46.350> with<00:00:46.710> respect<00:00:46.860> to

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
that particular with respect to

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.310 
that particular with respect to
environmental<00:00:47.610> engineering<00:00:48.110> so<00:00:49.110> I<00:00:49.140> actually

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
environmental engineering so I actually

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.100 
environmental engineering so I actually
enrolled<00:00:49.739> at<00:00:49.860> columbia<00:00:50.190> Southern<00:00:50.430> in<00:00:51.239> 2001

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
enrolled at columbia Southern in 2001

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.479 
enrolled at columbia Southern in 2001
and<00:00:53.570> got<00:00:54.570> a<00:00:54.600> duel<00:00:54.870> masters<00:00:55.649> of<00:00:55.920> environmental

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
and got a duel masters of environmental

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.150 
and got a duel masters of environmental
as<00:00:56.670> well<00:00:57.510> as<00:00:57.660> safety<00:00:58.109> engineering<00:00:58.800> management

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
as well as safety engineering management

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.720 
as well as safety engineering management
at<00:00:59.399> the<00:00:59.430> time<00:00:59.699> and<00:01:00.739> ultimately<00:01:01.739> designed<00:01:02.460> a

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
at the time and ultimately designed a

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.570 
at the time and ultimately designed a
hazardous<00:01:03.390> treatment<00:01:04.199> facility<00:01:04.799> that<00:01:05.430> I

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
hazardous treatment facility that I

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.280 
hazardous treatment facility that I
operated<00:01:06.210> for<00:01:06.900> rail<00:01:07.080> car<00:01:07.260> cleaning

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
operated for rail car cleaning

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.950 
operated for rail car cleaning
facilities<00:01:08.159> which<00:01:08.970> led<00:01:09.210> me<00:01:09.330> into<00:01:09.479> a<00:01:09.630> lot<00:01:09.869> of

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
facilities which led me into a lot of

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.830 
facilities which led me into a lot of
mobile<00:01:10.320> chemistry<00:01:10.799> work<00:01:10.979> I<00:01:11.479> was<00:01:12.479> combining

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
mobile chemistry work I was combining

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.320 
mobile chemistry work I was combining
safety<00:01:13.380> as<00:01:13.470> well<00:01:13.500> as<00:01:13.830> environmental<00:01:14.330> so

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
safety as well as environmental so

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.609 
safety as well as environmental so
currently<00:01:15.659> I've<00:01:15.810> got<00:01:16.020> two<00:01:16.470> different

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
currently I've got two different

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.880 
currently I've got two different
businesses<00:01:17.100> that<00:01:17.250> I<00:01:17.369> that<00:01:17.729> operate<00:01:18.270> one<00:01:18.570> is<00:01:18.780> a

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
businesses that I that operate one is a

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.410 
businesses that I that operate one is a
rather<00:01:19.890> large<00:01:20.130> laboratories<00:01:20.820> I've<00:01:20.970> got<00:01:21.090> seven

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
rather large laboratories I've got seven

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.300 
rather large laboratories I've got seven
different<00:01:21.540> environmental<00:01:22.350> laboratories<00:01:23.070> I

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
different environmental laboratories I

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.749 
different environmental laboratories I
did<00:01:24.210> a<00:01:24.270> lot<00:01:24.390> of<00:01:24.450> guest<00:01:24.780> lecturing<00:01:25.520> but<00:01:26.520> i<00:01:26.549> also

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
did a lot of guest lecturing but i also

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.310 
did a lot of guest lecturing but i also
have<00:01:26.909> a<00:01:26.970> biotech<00:01:27.390> consulting<00:01:27.509> company<00:01:28.170> where

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
have a biotech consulting company where

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.080 
have a biotech consulting company where
i<00:01:28.350> do<00:01:28.439> a<00:01:28.560> lot<00:01:28.770> of<00:01:28.799> data<00:01:29.040> analysis<00:01:29.729> with<00:01:30.060> respect

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
i do a lot of data analysis with respect

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.719 
i do a lot of data analysis with respect
to<00:01:30.600> a<00:01:30.630> chemistry<00:01:31.229> of<00:01:31.350> biotech<00:01:31.860> and<00:01:32.100> markets<00:01:32.460> I

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
to a chemistry of biotech and markets I

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.390 
to a chemistry of biotech and markets I
think<00:01:33.210> CSU<00:01:33.840> is<00:01:33.990> is<00:01:34.229> really<00:01:34.650> a<00:01:34.680> portal<00:01:35.220> of

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
think CSU is is really a portal of

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.690 
think CSU is is really a portal of
opportunity<00:01:36.590> it<00:01:37.590> was<00:01:37.770> for<00:01:38.009> me<00:01:38.130> anyway<00:01:38.670> I

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
opportunity it was for me anyway I

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.080 
opportunity it was for me anyway I
family<00:01:39.060> I<00:01:39.299> see<00:01:39.630> CSU<00:01:40.350> as<00:01:40.470> an<00:01:40.590> opportunity<00:01:41.100> to<00:01:41.189> to

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
family I see CSU as an opportunity to to

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.840 
family I see CSU as an opportunity to to
funnel<00:01:42.450> interest<00:01:42.960> and<00:01:43.229> previous<00:01:43.920> experiences

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
funnel interest and previous experiences

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.420 
funnel interest and previous experiences
into<00:01:45.149> a<00:01:45.390> program<00:01:45.780> can<00:01:46.350> be<00:01:46.380> tribulation<00:01:46.979> and

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
into a program can be tribulation and

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.120 
into a program can be tribulation and
actually<00:01:48.030> culminate<00:01:48.540> into<00:01:48.810> a<00:01:49.500> well

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
actually culminate into a well

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.670 
actually culminate into a well
accredited<00:01:50.729> degree<00:01:50.880> that<00:01:51.810> can<00:01:51.960> be<00:01:52.049> used<00:01:52.380> to

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
accredited degree that can be used to

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.280 
accredited degree that can be used to
become<00:01:53.369> a<00:01:53.399> scholar<00:01:53.759> practitioner<00:01:54.090> in<00:01:55.049> what's
