00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:59.090
 well I want to ride a coastal tree 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:02.480
 with the abdomen in deer hair 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:05.780
 good treaty thirty-two I've jumped 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:07.940
 turned back and jumped with the wing 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.650
 the roof in deer hair also 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:13.760
 the roe deer 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:16.610
 and the blond check in parachute good 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:20.050
 let's use a hook a time 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:23.270
 100 ml time without death of the number 12 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:25.910
 so it looks good and the size can 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.060
 vary can be mounted much smaller 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:29.640
 Y 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:33.360
 We start by putting the thread that is going to 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.760
 serve to jump the abdomen color 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.580
 roof tile 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:41.600
 the abdomen we are going to use a hair of 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:43.670
 golden colored deer and this color 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.700
 we use it a lot in the river 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:50.900
 tormes at the time of May that starts at 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:53.380
 to leave a cosmopolitan river or a rich river 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.380
 coffee law 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:02:00.690
 and it is this color and well the secret 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:05.000
 is to place it at that distance more or less 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:07.470
 as you see I'm putting it back 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.660
 here I hold it a little bit more with a couple 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:13.110
 of laps and now I'm going to form the 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:16.600
 abdomen jumping while moving the hair 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:19.120
 forward and jumping what 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:22.360
 forming the turns 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:25.330
 that the insect naturally has in the 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:27.770
 abdomen is an insect as I said 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:31.250
 before big enough 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:34.250
 the large wings also will 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.740
 do with hair say short in this 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:39.570
 case 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.570
 a roe of natural color 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:47.750
 what would this be 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:50.600
 with this phito inn would be enough 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:53.900
 some less we equate it with a 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:55.970
 equalizer that everyone knows 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.970
 in this case it is wide for hair of 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:01.239
 deer we tap it so that 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.239
 equal 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:07.310
 and we look for a pen in this case as 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:12.200
 What we want is to set up a 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:14.540
 parachute on the hair fibers of 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.900
 roe in this case that will form the 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.900
 cover 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:23.280
 What is convenient is to make them 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:26.620
 a length that does not exceed much 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:29.290
 much further back in this case this model 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:31.510
 of imitation does not have the roof 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.370
 excessively long covers a little bit the 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.740
 thorax from the back but it's not 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:39.640
 excessively long 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:42.000
 now we will see how we put it fix the 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.000
 lock 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:50.079
 forming a kind of post but of 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:55.709
 deer by its nature opens and now 

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:55.709
 it will close with the turns of the check 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:03.130
 that will resemble the legs of the insect 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:03.130
 in a very natural position 

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:10.280
 flat to the water now we hold it 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:13.250
 in the back with a few laps 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:16.329
 We cut the rest of the pen now 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:19.169
 we put a little turing 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:19.169
 blond 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:29.670
 we form with a little the thorax 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:32.850
 and another little softer thinner 

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:37.520
 We are going to form the roof as you see 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:37.520
 we beat the hair of deer back 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:45.960
 we mount it above and fix the thread 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:48.220
 in the head in the eye of the hook and 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:50.290
 then with a 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:54.590
 with an element of an invention 

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:57.020
 personal not to catch the fibers 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:05:00.140
 we pull back all the hairs 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:03.280
 is free to be able to do the head 

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:07.530
 with all ease 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:07.530
 no need to catch any hair 

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:13.340
 we cut the leftovers 

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:21.199
 there is always some fiber 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:29.490
 It is a fiber if it is bad because it is 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:31.770
 Well, this wheat, but 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:34.250
 in the river tormes works that is a 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:34.250
 wonder
