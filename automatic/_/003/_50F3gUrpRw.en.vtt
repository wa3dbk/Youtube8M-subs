I've<00:00:18.270> had<00:00:18.510> these<00:00:18.690> for<00:00:18.900> like<00:00:19.050> a<00:00:19.289> month<00:00:19.470> now<00:00:19.619> and

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
I've had these for like a month now and

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.429 
I've had these for like a month now and
I<00:00:20.359> mean<00:00:21.359> like<00:00:21.539> I<00:00:21.750> don't<00:00:21.840> I<00:00:22.109> didn't<00:00:22.289> really

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
I mean like I don't I didn't really

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.880 
I mean like I don't I didn't really
skate<00:00:22.830> every<00:00:23.070> day<00:00:23.340> for<00:00:23.670> these<00:00:23.760> so<00:00:24.119> on<00:00:24.810> a<00:00:24.840> in<00:00:25.680> my

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
skate every day for these so on a in my

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.189 
skate every day for these so on a in my
opinion<00:00:26.310> they<00:00:26.460> do<00:00:26.519> kind<00:00:27.119> of<00:00:27.210> a<00:00:27.330> fast<00:00:27.630> but<00:00:27.960> I

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
opinion they do kind of a fast but I

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.950 
opinion they do kind of a fast but I
think<00:00:28.769> it<00:00:29.160> depends<00:00:29.609> on<00:00:29.760> how<00:00:30.000> good<00:00:30.300> you<00:00:30.720> are<00:00:30.779> and

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
think it depends on how good you are and

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.299 
think it depends on how good you are and
how<00:00:31.109> much<00:00:31.230> flip<00:00:31.529> tricks<00:00:31.830> you<00:00:32.790> do<00:00:32.940> so<00:00:34.010> yeah<00:00:35.010> um

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
how much flip tricks you do so yeah um

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.970 
how much flip tricks you do so yeah um
so<00:00:35.880> to<00:00:36.450> me<00:00:36.570> I<00:00:36.600> think<00:00:36.840> I'll<00:00:37.170> be<00:00:37.290> like<00:00:37.440> kind<00:00:37.890> of

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
so to me I think I'll be like kind of

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.920 
so to me I think I'll be like kind of
like<00:00:38.040> middle<00:00:38.489> I'm<00:00:38.579> not<00:00:38.760> like<00:00:38.940> too<00:00:39.329> good<00:00:39.360> but

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
like middle I'm not like too good but

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.880 
like middle I'm not like too good but
not<00:00:40.050> like<00:00:40.379> a<00:00:40.620> beginner<00:00:41.399> level<00:00:41.730> so<00:00:42.270> I<00:00:42.540> for<00:00:43.320> me<00:00:43.559> if

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
not like a beginner level so I for me if

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.000 
not like a beginner level so I for me if
I<00:00:44.600> count<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:45.780> amount<00:00:45.840> of<00:00:46.079> days<00:00:46.350> it<00:00:46.590> took<00:00:46.739> me<00:00:46.920> to

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
I count the amount of days it took me to

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.440 
I count the amount of days it took me to
make<00:00:47.160> a<00:00:47.190> whole<00:00:47.399> like<00:00:47.579> you<00:00:47.910> can<00:00:48.059> see<00:00:48.239> that<00:00:48.420> I

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
make a whole like you can see that I

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.880 
make a whole like you can see that I
ditch<00:00:48.960> you<00:00:49.260> goo<00:00:49.440> um<00:00:49.620> so<00:00:50.250> I<00:00:50.520> think<00:00:51.890> you're

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.670 
probably I probably got a hole in five
days<00:00:55.489> so<00:00:56.489> I<00:00:56.520> I<00:00:57.059> mean<00:00:57.690> you<00:00:57.989> can<00:00:58.199> probably<00:00:58.440> like

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.660 
grip there are a I think like I I used
to<00:02:26.990> not<00:02:27.170> work<00:02:27.350> down<00:02:27.560> like<00:02:27.920> the<00:02:28.250> grip<00:02:28.460> of<00:02:28.610> the

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
to not work down like the grip of the

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.410 
to not work down like the grip of the
shoes<00:02:28.940> as<00:02:29.210> much<00:02:29.570> but<00:02:30.640> I've<00:02:31.640> been<00:02:31.910> doing<00:02:32.270> that

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
shoes as much but I've been doing that

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.260 
shoes as much but I've been doing that
lately<00:02:32.660> so<00:02:33.110> I<00:02:33.440> mean<00:02:33.950> I<00:02:34.070> say<00:02:34.310> they're<00:02:34.520> okay<00:02:34.760> and

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.270 
lately so I mean I say they're okay and

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:37.110 
lately so I mean I say they're okay and
then<00:02:35.420> they<00:02:35.540> also<00:02:35.660> got<00:02:35.930> the<00:02:36.110> dirt<00:02:36.440> cap<00:02:36.710> feature

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
then they also got the dirt cap feature

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.300 
then they also got the dirt cap feature
right<00:02:38.120> there<00:02:38.330> so<00:02:38.660> it's<00:02:38.990> just<00:02:39.320> an<00:02:39.530> extra<00:02:40.070> like

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
right there so it's just an extra like

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.670 
right there so it's just an extra like
piece<00:02:40.970> of<00:02:41.150> rubber<00:02:41.360> right<00:02:41.570> here<00:02:41.810> so<00:02:42.110> like<00:02:42.410> last

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
piece of rubber right here so like last

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:48.210 
piece of rubber right here so like last
longer<00:02:43.070> and<00:02:44.410> that's<00:02:45.410> a<00:02:45.620> good<00:02:45.980> feature<00:02:46.160> I<00:02:46.340> guess

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
longer and that's a good feature I guess

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.770 
longer and that's a good feature I guess
yeah<00:02:49.220> you<00:02:49.280> can<00:02:49.550> just<00:02:49.580> another<00:02:50.240> difference<00:02:50.690> I

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
yeah you can just another difference I

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.870 
yeah you can just another difference I
guess<00:02:50.990> it<00:02:51.200> used<00:02:51.380> to<00:02:51.500> tell<00:02:51.740> is<00:02:52.040> used<00:02:52.310> to<00:02:52.400> say<00:02:52.580> Pro

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.170 
guess it used to tell is used to say Pro
right<00:02:53.090> here<00:02:53.360> and<00:02:54.140> it<00:02:54.230> does<00:02:54.410> say<00:02:54.620> Pro<00:02:55.180> right

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
these out I'd say I found it if you

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:30.850 
these out I'd say I found it if you
could<00:03:29.240> get<00:03:29.480> a<00:03:29.510> discount<00:03:29.690> getting<00:03:30.200> cheap<00:03:30.560> like

could get a discount getting cheap like

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:33.370 
could get a discount getting cheap like
I<00:03:31.180> think<00:03:32.180> you<00:03:32.330> should<00:03:32.480> do<00:03:32.600> that<00:03:32.750> and<00:03:33.020> if<00:03:33.200> you're

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
I think you should do that and if you're

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:34.720 
I think you should do that and if you're
not<00:03:33.590> like<00:03:33.890> if<00:03:34.070> you<00:03:34.160> don't<00:03:34.310> care<00:03:34.520> too<00:03:34.700> much

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
not like if you don't care too much

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:37.630 
not like if you don't care too much
about<00:03:34.910> insulin<00:03:35.570> stuff<00:03:36.040> you<00:03:37.040> could<00:03:37.310> get<00:03:37.520> the

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:37.640 
about insulin stuff you could get the

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.390 
about insulin stuff you could get the
suede<00:03:37.940> classics<00:03:38.540> the<00:03:39.380> classic<00:03:39.830> slip<00:03:40.070> ons<00:03:40.250> that

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
suede classics the classic slip ons that

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:41.920 
suede classics the classic slip ons that
are<00:03:40.580> suede<00:03:40.820> I<00:03:40.850> think<00:03:41.210> they<00:03:41.330> probably<00:03:41.540> skate

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:43.660 
are suede I think they probably skate
almost<00:03:42.320> the<00:03:42.380> same<00:03:42.560> I<00:03:42.920> mean<00:03:43.220> these<00:03:43.370> are<00:03:43.580> my
