00:00:01.449 --> 00:00:05.630
 mr. maybe a day in luck 

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:09.440
 comes to the second part of a comparison 

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:11.300
 between the samsung galaxy xcover and 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:13.219
 the sony xperia co 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:15.530
 we'll take a look now 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:17.300
 how are the menus in comparison like that 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:19.760
 the construction which surface sees 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.710
 maybe send it out and which one 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:24.100
 may react faster 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:26.390
 we'll just take a look at the menu 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:30.199
 I can already do that with a child 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.550
 like it here at sony is better 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:33.920
 but I really a matter of taste so 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:36.559
 he might do something better with it 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.750
 You can see four times here 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:40.700
 three applications and here four times four 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.480
 means here we have a whole line 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.329
 worth more 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:48.640
 a whole line or a splitter 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:48.640
 as it would like more to applikation 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:54.559
 Of course it's more fun than that 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.539
 that you have to scroll less if 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:58.640
 but here we go out again I think 

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:00.289
 I already like that the cinema technical 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.359
 problem that works for both and mine 

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:05.510
 We'll take a look at the settings 

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:07.390
 see little like that with the fast 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:10.070
 and scrolling works like that with the 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.750
 speed is something jerky 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:15.170
 or not for comparison 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:17.740
 android version 2.3 like the sony co 2 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:20.920
 366 carats 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:32.590
 we'll take a quick look at the browser 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:32.590
 internet we did not visit 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:43.970
 I have seen it take a while 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.970
 The keyboard at the galaxy came 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:55.590
 welt.de so and god we look briefly how 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:58.320
 The loading times are in comparison sees 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.939
 pretty much just looking straight out 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:04.140
 We where the first result comes from here 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:05.490
 it comes first result and yes about it 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.800
 I would argue that 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.750
 Samsung Galaxy Note a little faster 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:12.269
 But what you see here while scrolling 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.519
 I think so very much 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:18.090
 liquid at the galaxy 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:20.910
 that speaks when at the xcover 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.650
 pretty much always hears from sometime in the 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.970
 middle to scroll not the whole time 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.970
 I'll show you that again 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:33.190
 I think what I mean 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.630
 Let's load an article above that 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.390
 you can also see the colors nicely 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:39.010
 Comparison will be under a third 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:43.690
 to have a closer look at the display 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:46.650
 Check here is the article already 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:49.480
 loaded here he comes let's go 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:56.050
 I look the whole way in 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:58.450
 size comparison of course beats 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:59.800
 Both were on the mobile version 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.560
 Let's change briefly 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:04.890
 go down times you have to change there 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.890
 can 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:11.130
 classic website and co 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:22.590
 at the bar is faster and go 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:25.730
 Here is the first thing to look good 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.730
 we zoom with the zoom 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:32.550
 so the size of the gate in the 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:36.030
 Comparison from one sees map 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:38.850
 the colors the white works for me 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:43.920
 galaxy a little better natural here 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:48.450
 Does it work if we are not yellow yet? 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:55.440
 comes just past youtube the 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:58.530
 preview and look which one 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:00.420
 both continue a video faster and load 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:03.810
 the loading of the page goes in any case 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:06.350
 at xperia co faster of course, of course 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:13.430
 connected in the same wlan network 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:16.880
 logical bavaria very well look what 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.880
 and Co 

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:33.060
 okay you've seen it faster 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:36.919
 Again, this looks like 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:36.919
 it would have been the nose in front 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:44.520
 at least in my opinion in matters 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:46.680
 performance and beauty of the 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.090
 surface is at metascore front 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.310
 Of course, that's both 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:52.949
 matter of taste is what makes you feel better 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:54.600
 like you can tell me 

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:57.120
 Let's go over the news for a moment 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:05:01.350
 so it looks like the on keyboards 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:09.120
 in comparison as already briefly the calendar 

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:10.440
 Sun calendar and calendar so see 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:15.060
 these compare in comparison, of course 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:16.949
 crime in the months stimulates sony 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:21.180
 that old little fancier if you are 

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:22.530
 the telephone application asks me for 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:27.330
 she still has a little here again 

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:29.990
 hesitated the collection we open the times 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:29.990
 contacts 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:42.789
 but here the sony really flutters 

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:48.910
 divide by two still we can open 

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:50.889
 the camera and here that is so ever 

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:58.919
 again we solve it faster 

00:05:50.889 --> 00:05:58.919
 that's how you see it 

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.719
 and 

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:17.030
 yes, I would say it was here too 

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:20.910
 sony forward go away go to the menu 

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:22.009
 out the test is a really hard one 

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:29.850
 to show 

00:06:22.009 --> 00:06:32.009
 But let's just do it that way 

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:39.840
 relatively fast and if we have this here 

00:06:32.009 --> 00:06:41.600
 ok too without great 

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:47.720
 jerk 

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:52.370
 Last but not least to the gallery 

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:52.370
 they have here and 

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:08.220
 yes, both are very smoothly okay 

00:07:06.539 --> 00:07:09.930
 should only be a very small impression 

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:12.300
 how the two devices in direct 

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:13.740
 We get a look in the comparison 

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:14.729
 next part in the third part one 

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:16.440
 compare display 

00:07:14.729 --> 00:07:17.910
 I'll make it dark and that 

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:18.960
 two displays with the same pictures 

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:20.639
 test exactly 

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:23.180
 Turns back on your time 

00:07:20.639 --> 00:07:23.180
 makes it good
