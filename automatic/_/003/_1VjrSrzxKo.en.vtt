00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.829
 electricity of a communication 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.770
 while you are a lot a look 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.430

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:29.860
 people have come from very long and enough 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:38.130
 dancers who have shown to have 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:43.009

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.820
 years at auditions 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:03.870
 it must be that you have an example 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.580
 the other people who did not win have to 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:08.190
 feel that he missed it because you 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:10.080

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.040

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.260
 electronic things that in an orchestra 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:37.940
 normal are not used then we are 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.250
