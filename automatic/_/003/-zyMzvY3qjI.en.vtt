00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
them he's easiest to do the time

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:15.919 
them he's easiest to do the time
challenge<00:00:14.610> with<00:00:14.969> because<00:00:15.509> he<00:00:15.719> can<00:00:15.809> go

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929

underground as you can see and kind of

00:00:18.180 --> 00:02:00.660 
underground as you can see and kind of
not<00:00:18.840> slide<00:00:19.289> as<00:00:19.470> much<00:00:19.619> in<00:00:19.770> the<00:00:19.859> ice

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:22.550 

I

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:46.009 

you<00:02:23.560> need<00:02:23.830> an<00:02:24.069> undead<00:02:24.730> skyline

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:46.019 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:48.000 

pretty<00:02:47.019> much<00:02:47.140> what<00:02:47.379> you<00:02:47.500> did<00:02:47.650> here<00:02:47.829> was<00:02:47.890> just

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
pretty much what you did here was just

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.789 
pretty much what you did here was just
slide<00:02:48.370> around<00:02:48.640> collecting<00:02:49.360> skulls<00:02:50.319> get<00:02:50.590> to<00:02:50.680> do

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:50.799 
slide around collecting skulls get to do

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:52.679 
slide around collecting skulls get to do
it<00:02:50.920> in<00:02:50.980> under<00:02:51.040> a<00:02:51.220> minute<00:02:51.459> and<00:02:51.670> a<00:02:52.150> half<00:02:52.299> I<00:02:52.659> think

00:02:52.679 --> 00:02:52.689 
it in under a minute and a half I think

00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:55.289 
it in under a minute and a half I think
I<00:02:53.110> cut<00:02:53.739> it<00:02:53.829> out<00:02:53.920> of<00:02:54.040> the<00:02:54.099> video<00:02:54.340> so<00:02:54.370> it<00:02:54.879> wasn't

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:55.299 
I cut it out of the video so it wasn't

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:57.240 
I cut it out of the video so it wasn't
wasting<00:02:55.689> that<00:02:55.989> time<00:02:56.260> showing<00:02:56.799> you<00:02:56.950> just<00:02:56.980> me

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
before but that's a ability everything

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.170 
before but that's a ability everything
gets<00:03:28.829> when<00:03:29.040> you<00:03:29.099> put<00:03:29.250> the<00:03:29.340> pirate<00:03:29.609> seas<00:03:29.790> on<00:03:30.060> the
