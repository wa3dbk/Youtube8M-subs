00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:09.860
 you like beans but do not know 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:11.719
 new ideas to cook with 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:14.840
 the baby habitas of today you are going to suck 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:17.360
 the fingers you will see, these are the 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:20.060
 ingredients we need 50 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:22.910
 milliliters of olive oil 400 grams 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:25.519
 of baby habitas frozen a butifarra 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:29.060
 chopped a package of chopped bacon 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:30.800
 an onion 200 grams of mushrooms a 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.840
 medium tomato peeled and cut into 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.630
 four pieces three or four teeth 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.820
 garlic medium glass of white wine half glass 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:41.270
 of muscatel half a glass of chicken broth 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:43.790
 salt black pepper a chilli pepper 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:45.530
 We started by chopping the onion and cutting 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:48.910
 the mushrooms in pieces not very large 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.910
 so that they are done well in the bucket 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.570
 then we put the oil of the chef plus 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:01:05.220
 and we fry it in the open lid menu 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:07.050
 with power 3 remember that in this 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.510
 option of the menu you have to turn the knob of 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:11.880
 the lid to the closed position when 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.100
 the ingredients are stir-fried we add 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.700
 the bacon we cook everything about two 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.700
 more minutes 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.260
 yes 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:26.590
 and we add the rest of the ingredients 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:33.190
 you inhabit the tomato the white wine the 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:35.470
 Muscat salt and pepper 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:37.210
 also unpeeled garlic is enough 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:39.760
 give them a blow before putting them 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.800
 in the bucket and if you like a touch 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:44.320
 spicy add a chilli pepper 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:47.550
 then we program the menu 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.550
 I press nine minutes 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.530
 when the chef plus ends we put in the 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.870
 bucket the botifarra cut into pieces 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.030
 medium and to give it a little more 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:02.820
 consistency add the chicken broth 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:05.870
 the last thing will be to program the pressure menu 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.870
 another three minutes 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:14.150
 in just a quarter of an hour and already 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.150
 we will have the food ready
