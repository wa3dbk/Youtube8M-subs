00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
it's turned into fresh compost when it

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.050 
it's turned into fresh compost when it

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
comes to the compost that we do with our

worms we only like to use fruits and

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:27.099 
worms we only like to use fruits and
vegetables<00:02:25.190> because<00:02:25.370> worms<00:02:25.910> don't<00:02:26.389> like<00:02:26.630> the

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:27.109 
vegetables because worms don't like the

00:02:27.109 --> 00:02:29.620 
vegetables because worms don't like the
animal<00:02:27.769> products<00:02:28.280> like<00:02:28.430> milk<00:02:28.669> cheese<00:02:29.329> and

00:02:34.539 --> 00:02:34.549 
vegetables we like to feed our worms

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:36.190 
vegetables we like to feed our worms
because<00:02:34.730> that's<00:02:35.060> what<00:02:35.209> they<00:02:35.329> like<00:02:35.569> so<00:02:35.840> let's

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
because that's what they like so let's

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.229 
because that's what they like so let's
go<00:02:36.319> check<00:02:36.470> out<00:02:36.590> our<00:02:36.709> rooms<00:02:36.889> so<00:02:37.220> the<00:02:37.730> art<00:02:37.970> of

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:38.239 
go check out our rooms so the art of

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:40.390 
go check out our rooms so the art of
composting<00:02:38.989> how<00:02:39.319> do<00:02:39.380> you<00:02:39.590> come<00:02:39.859> to<00:02:39.889> us<00:02:40.099> well

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
composting how do you come to us well

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.460 
composting how do you come to us well
first<00:02:40.669> you<00:02:40.849> have<00:02:40.880> to<00:02:41.000> save<00:02:41.269> all<00:02:41.569> the<00:02:41.630> food<00:02:42.049> from

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
first you have to save all the food from

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.240 
first you have to save all the food from
the<00:02:42.500> ground<00:02:42.829> all<00:02:43.400> of<00:02:43.790> the<00:02:43.910> vegetables<00:02:44.120> great

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
the ground all of the vegetables great

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.979 
the ground all of the vegetables great
and<00:02:46.250> then<00:02:46.400> you<00:02:46.459> have<00:02:46.609> chocolate<00:02:47.030> up<00:02:47.389> with<00:02:47.780> like

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:47.989 
and then you have chocolate up with like

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:49.569 
and then you have chocolate up with like
a<00:02:48.019> shovel<00:02:48.380> or<00:02:48.530> something<00:02:49.040> to<00:02:49.099> break<00:02:49.310> it<00:02:49.459> down

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:49.579 
a shovel or something to break it down

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:50.680 
a shovel or something to break it down
into<00:02:49.819> a<00:02:49.970> nice

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
into a nice

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:53.170 
into a nice
smoothie<00:02:51.230> so<00:02:52.040> it's<00:02:52.310> easier<00:02:52.640> for<00:02:52.670> the<00:02:52.850> worms<00:02:53.030> to

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
smoothie so it's easier for the worms to

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.020 
smoothie so it's easier for the worms to
break<00:02:53.480> it<00:02:53.630> down<00:02:53.800> then<00:02:54.800> you<00:02:55.280> have<00:02:55.490> to<00:02:55.640> feed<00:02:55.880> the

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
break it down then you have to feed the

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:57.880 
break it down then you have to feed the
worms<00:02:56.210> but<00:02:56.660> you're<00:02:56.840> just<00:02:57.050> putting<00:02:57.260> it<00:02:57.440> in<00:02:57.590> and

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
worms but you're just putting it in and

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:59.380 
worms but you're just putting it in and
makes<00:02:58.070> you<00:02:58.250> some<00:02:58.490> of<00:02:58.610> it<00:02:58.760> up<00:02:58.880> with<00:02:59.030> the<00:02:59.150> worms

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
makes you some of it up with the worms

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:00.910 
makes you some of it up with the worms
but<00:02:59.750> not<00:02:59.870> too<00:03:00.080> much<00:03:00.260> so<00:03:00.440> you<00:03:00.500> don't<00:03:00.680> feel<00:03:00.860> the

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
but not too much so you don't feel the

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.060 
but not too much so you don't feel the
work<00:03:01.180> then<00:03:02.180> you<00:03:02.420> have<00:03:02.600> to<00:03:02.720> mix<00:03:02.900> it<00:03:03.020> carbon<00:03:03.530> and

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:04.070 
work then you have to mix it carbon and

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:07.990 
work then you have to mix it carbon and
nitrogen<00:03:04.460> nitrogen<00:03:05.290> carbon<00:03:06.290> paper<00:03:07.070> cardboard

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
nitrogen nitrogen carbon paper cardboard

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.480 
nitrogen nitrogen carbon paper cardboard
and<00:03:08.510> this<00:03:09.020> way<00:03:09.230> it<00:03:09.380> keeps<00:03:09.560> it<00:03:09.770> balanced<00:03:10.190> so<00:03:10.370> it

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:10.490 
and this way it keeps it balanced so it

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:13.600 
and this way it keeps it balanced so it
doesn't<00:03:10.790> stink<00:03:11.450> too<00:03:11.750> bad<00:03:12.040> and<00:03:13.040> then<00:03:13.250> you<00:03:13.280> have

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610 
doesn't stink too bad and then you have

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.040 
doesn't stink too bad and then you have
to<00:03:13.760> wait<00:03:13.940> for<00:03:14.120> a<00:03:14.180> while<00:03:14.300> to<00:03:14.570> let<00:03:14.690> the<00:03:14.870> worms

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:15.050 
to wait for a while to let the worms

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:17.440 
to wait for a while to let the worms
just<00:03:15.380> eat<00:03:15.620> and<00:03:15.920> relax<00:03:16.310> and<00:03:16.760> you<00:03:16.880> know<00:03:17.000> get<00:03:17.330> it

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
just eat and relax and you know get it

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:19.690 
just eat and relax and you know get it
all<00:03:17.510> in<00:03:17.750> this<00:03:17.840> system<00:03:18.050> then<00:03:18.860> you<00:03:18.980> harvest<00:03:19.310> it

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
all in this system then you harvest it

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.860 
all in this system then you harvest it
and<00:03:19.880> voila<00:03:20.510> you've<00:03:21.290> got<00:03:21.910> compost<00:03:22.910> here<00:03:23.690> so

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
and voila you've got compost here so

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.290 
and voila you've got compost here so
