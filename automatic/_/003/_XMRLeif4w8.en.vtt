00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.940 
with my mp5 k and the spec ops mode
early<00:04:49.950> on<00:04:51.419> one<00:04:52.419> thing<00:04:52.630> I<00:04:52.780> noticed<00:04:53.050> about<00:04:53.350> it<00:04:53.710> is

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:53.950 
early on one thing I noticed about it is

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:57.630 
early on one thing I noticed about it is
that<00:04:54.600> it<00:04:55.600> doesn't<00:04:55.960> kick<00:04:56.230> nearly<00:04:56.919> as<00:04:57.040> much<00:04:57.250> as

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:57.640 
that it doesn't kick nearly as much as

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:59.580 
that it doesn't kick nearly as much as
the<00:04:58.120> old<00:04:58.270> one<00:04:58.510> I<00:04:58.660> mean<00:04:58.870> clearly<00:04:58.990> it<00:04:59.350> looks

00:04:59.580 --> 00:04:59.590 
the old one I mean clearly it looks

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:01.590 
the old one I mean clearly it looks
completely<00:05:00.010> different<00:05:00.340> all<00:05:00.669> the<00:05:00.940> guns<00:05:01.210> are

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:01.600

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:07.270 
they're all gonna look different even

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:11.450
