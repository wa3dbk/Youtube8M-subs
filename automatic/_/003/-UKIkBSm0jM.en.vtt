00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:07.990 
far very simply we go a rest so we put

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.959 
far very simply we go a rest so we put

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:16.390 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:24.390 

so<00:01:17.140> all<00:01:17.290> together<00:01:21.870> then<00:01:22.870> we<00:01:23.650> want<00:01:23.890> to<00:01:24.010> go<00:01:24.250> back

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:24.400 
so all together then we want to go back

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.770
