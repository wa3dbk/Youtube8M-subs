00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
you guys didn't get all that just go

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.399 
you guys didn't get all that just go
ahead<00:01:38.970> and<00:01:39.060> rewind<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.720> video<00:01:39.840> a<00:01:40.020> little<00:01:40.290> bit

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
ahead and rewind the video a little bit

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.620 
ahead and rewind the video a little bit
and<00:01:40.500> then<00:01:40.560> pause<00:01:40.920> and<00:01:41.189> play<00:01:41.310> it<00:01:41.579> you'll<00:01:42.210> get<00:01:42.509> it

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
and then pause and play it you'll get it

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.350 
and then pause and play it you'll get it
eventually<00:01:42.689> I<00:01:43.460> know<00:01:44.460> it's<00:01:44.670> kind<00:01:44.850> of<00:01:44.880> tricky<00:01:45.090> so

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
eventually I know it's kind of tricky so

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.399 
eventually I know it's kind of tricky so
if<00:01:45.450> you<00:01:45.509> guys<00:01:45.630> don't<00:01:45.810> get<00:01:45.960> it<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.110> first<00:01:46.290> time

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
if you guys don't get it the first time

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.139 
if you guys don't get it the first time
it'll<00:01:46.770> tell<00:01:47.040> you<00:01:47.130> that<00:01:47.250> you<00:01:47.310> did<00:01:47.670> not<00:01:47.820> enter

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
it'll tell you that you did not enter

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.660 
it'll tell you that you did not enter
DFU<00:01:48.840> mode<00:01:49.049> directly<00:01:49.890> and<00:01:50.159> you<00:01:50.310> didn't<00:01:50.520> do<00:01:50.579> it

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
DFU mode directly and you didn't do it

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:51.920 
DFU mode directly and you didn't do it
correctly<00:01:50.880> so<00:01:51.240> you're<00:01:51.390> gonna<00:01:51.479> have<00:01:51.630> to<00:01:51.689> do<00:01:51.810> it

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
correctly so you're gonna have to do it

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.719 
correctly so you're gonna have to do it
again<00:01:52.020> don't<00:01:52.439> worry<00:01:52.619> about<00:01:52.710> that<00:01:53.009> just<00:01:53.040> go

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
again don't worry about that just go

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.460 
again don't worry about that just go
back<00:01:54.270> to<00:01:54.299> the<00:01:54.479> last<00:01:54.689> step<00:01:54.990> and<00:01:55.140> just<00:01:55.320> keep

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
back to the last step and just keep

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.649 
back to the last step and just keep
trying<00:01:55.710> it<00:01:55.890> until<00:01:56.159> you<00:01:56.280> get<00:01:56.430> it<00:01:56.490> into<00:01:56.759> dfu<00:01:57.149> mode

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
trying it until you get it into dfu mode

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.030 
trying it until you get it into dfu mode
and<00:01:57.960> you<00:01:58.020> see<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.229> little<00:01:58.350> blue<00:01:58.619> bar<00:01:58.829> go

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
and you see the little blue bar go

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.410 
and you see the little blue bar go
across<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.549> actual<00:01:59.850> program<00:02:00.240> on<00:02:00.390> your

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
across the actual program on your

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.929 
across the actual program on your
computer<00:02:01.189> so<00:02:02.189> now<00:02:02.280> let's<00:02:02.399> get<00:02:02.490> actually<00:02:02.759> start

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
the first being on this jailbreak is

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:11.900 
the first being on this jailbreak is
untethered<00:02:11.009> which<00:02:11.250> means<00:02:11.459> you<00:02:11.550> do<00:02:11.640> not<00:02:11.670> have

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
untethered which means you do not have

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.850 
untethered which means you do not have
to<00:02:12.030> run<00:02:12.209> redsnow<00:02:12.810> on<00:02:13.200> your<00:02:13.290> computer<00:02:13.620> and<00:02:13.650> plug
