00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:04.890
 or friends today we are going to try to discover 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.530
 in what real life cars has 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.780
 inspired rock star to do these 

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:12.450
 cars that will bring us in the second 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.559
 part of dirty money and then let's start 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.770
 with the first one that is this 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.960
 superdeportivo project 20 and then 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:22.320
 it is clearly seen that they were inspired by the 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.450
 mclaren f1 let's say that most say 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.330
 what is this car about and I think that 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:29.040
 there is a data there is a very 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:31.350
 characteristic of this car but we can 

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:33.690
 see in the front and well 

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:35.880
 save as a figure with a 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.220
 circumference as a circle this 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.260
 front is very characteristic of mclaren 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:43.170
 p 1 and let's say that is the most 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:46.500
 highlighted that makes it seem almost 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.760
 let's say that identical go makes it be 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.770
 almost equal 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.570
 obvious change the headlights change some 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.630
 parts however also the part of 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:57.059
 behind the bubble this cabin for the 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:58.649
 driver is also very similar to this 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.600
 passenger compartment is let's say that very 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.969
 characteristic of pp 1 and we can almost 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.519
 assure that this is about this car the 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.950
 which they took as a base and for the pocket 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:11.490
 Latin we clearly see that they took 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.710
 reference to the 1956 corvette these 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.060
 headlights that are too characteristic 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.219
 of this model 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.289
 they highlight too much in the model 

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:21.899
 that they took in the car already from the game of 

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:23.970
 gta we see it quite similar the 

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:25.610
 grille also very similar although the 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.439
 grille of the original corvette 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:30.630
 It looks more rectangular with a little 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.909
 let's say that rounded the edges without 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.549
 But grille is more flirtatious 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.350
 oval however it is a great 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.719
 difference because it keeps appearing 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.970
 too much now let's go with the 

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:45.780
 windshield the windshield this let's say 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.759
 that is in a location let's say that 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.189
 the supports not the contours are very 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.770
 similar and almost make us think that 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:55.530
 It can be convertible or it can come 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.929
 version that is totally convertible 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.509
 we will have to wait and see if there are these 

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:03.989
 two versions now we go with the yacht 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:06.209
 this yacht is going to be called lamp ty bull 

00:02:03.989 --> 00:02:09.090
 it's a yacht that's totally made of 

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:12.600
 very beautiful wood very luxurious and then 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:14.220
 we see the inspiration part the real is 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.310
 a lamborghini is a 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:19.800
 ya lamborghini what good to start 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:24.090
 I think that the power that this has 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:26.760
 thing is bestial then much of 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.950
 the inspiration because it was this yacht that 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.410
 one of its great features are 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.390
 the benefits it has are these 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:36.870
 engines that have horsepower 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:39.060
 but demonized and this image by the 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.610
 back side go here you can appreciate 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.950
 the part of the engine that you see 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:45.600
 awesome now let's go with this 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:49.640
 auto off-road that is called code 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:53.430
 brouwer and clearly they were inspired by 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:56.220
 this car called rally fighter that 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:59.790
 most likely they saw it in the 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:03.030
 transformers 4 this movie that in the 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:05.910
 which this car appears, let's say that 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.800
 is part of the inspiration to do 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:10.890
 This brand off-road vehicle 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:13.350
 colt and then here again the 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.700
 things to put us in speculation is 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:17.520
 the brand that makes it vehicles 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.470
 electric sidewalk electric 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.700
 we're going to talk until the 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.340
 next is 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:25.980
 many diet the vindicator line this 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:28.319
 motorcycle I really like 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:31.769
 too much if it is clearly seen that 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:34.050
 they took it from the nm 4 probe and it has 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:36.930
 futuristic traits and I think it has 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:38.970
 Unrivaled performance, check if 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.980
 Has the acceleration and speed 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.140
 maximum 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:46.019
 let's say it rivals the 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:48.360
 motorcycles that currently have a 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:51.239
 good performance as is the coma then 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:53.880
 let's see if he has let's say the sizes 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:56.430
 to be in the first places this 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:58.680
 I liked too much motorcycle 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:01.920
 some good lines and if I'm going to 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:04.860
 buy and we go with him he predicted this 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:07.019
 let's say it's the bronx a vehicle 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:09.299
 classic now that we have the inspiration 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:12.360
 the inspiration I think it's about 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:16.829
 a continental lincoln many say that 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:19.739
 maybe it's a ford ltd can 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:22.740
 be also the lcd however the trait 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:25.229
 of the headlights the feature of the grill is 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:26.730
 it looks a lot more like this lincoln 

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:28.890
 continental is a 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:31.080
 actually I started to like nothing 

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:33.330
 more to see what is inspired and I 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:35.940
 He started to like me even though I'm not 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:38.280
 of imply that I like in this type 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:40.590
 of cars but this lincoln and sexy 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:42.840
 they took as inspiration that car and 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:44.970
 speak began to like and maybe yes what 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.380
 go buy well good friends this 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:48.030
 it was a video to see what it was 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:50.460
 they inspired those of rockstar to attract 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:53.870
 these new dirty money cars 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.870
 part 2 goodbye friends
