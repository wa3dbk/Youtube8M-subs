00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.130 
how to make this simple paper airplane
it<00:00:04.620> is<00:00:05.009> a<00:00:05.040> pretty<00:00:05.549> good<00:00:05.790> looking<00:00:06.180> paper

airplane flies pretty well and it's not

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.700 
airplane flies pretty well and it's not
really<00:00:10.950> that<00:00:11.070> difficult<00:00:11.340> to<00:00:11.670> make<00:00:12.469> so<00:00:13.469> here's

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
really that difficult to make so here's

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.320 
really that difficult to make so here's
what<00:00:13.860> we<00:00:13.980> need<00:00:14.130> we<00:00:14.370> need<00:00:14.400> one<00:00:14.880> sheet<00:00:15.299> of

what we need we need one sheet of
regular<00:00:15.839> a4<00:00:16.379> american<00:00:17.039> printer<00:00:17.400> paper<00:00:18.289> so

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
regular a4 american printer paper so

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:20.920 
regular a4 american printer paper so
we're<00:00:19.410> gonna<00:00:19.500> fold<00:00:19.830> the<00:00:20.039> paper<00:00:20.279> in<00:00:20.640> half

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:20.930 
we're gonna fold the paper in half

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:27.500 
we're gonna fold the paper in half
quarter<00:00:21.930> to<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:22.260> corners<00:00:22.830> line<00:00:23.010> up<00:00:26.269> just<00:00:27.269> like

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
quarter to the corners line up just like

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.529 
quarter to the corners line up just like
so<00:00:28.160> to<00:00:29.160> get<00:00:29.340> those<00:00:29.550> lined<00:00:29.849> up<00:00:30.029> we'll<00:00:30.269> put<00:00:30.330> a

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
so to get those lined up we'll put a

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.290 
so to get those lined up we'll put a
good<00:00:30.689> crease<00:00:31.019> down<00:00:31.320> here<00:00:31.679> and<00:00:31.890> this<00:00:32.880> crease

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
good crease down here and this crease

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.200 
good crease down here and this crease
like<00:00:33.690> many<00:00:34.050> other<00:00:34.320> paper<00:00:35.309> airplanes<00:00:35.760> is<00:00:35.969> just

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
like many other paper airplanes is just

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.630 
like many other paper airplanes is just
gonna<00:00:36.329> be<00:00:36.540> a<00:00:36.570> reference<00:00:37.110> line<00:00:37.469> so<00:00:38.399> we're<00:00:38.520> gonna

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
gonna be a reference line so we're gonna

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.950 
gonna be a reference line so we're gonna
open<00:00:38.969> this<00:00:39.270> up<00:00:39.950> and<00:00:40.950> then<00:00:41.100> we're<00:00:41.280> going<00:00:41.610> to

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:41.960 
open this up and then we're going to

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.979 
open this up and then we're going to
fold<00:00:42.960> this<00:00:43.290> top<00:00:43.680> line<00:00:44.040> in<00:00:44.489> this<00:00:44.910> corner<00:00:45.450> down

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
fold this top line in this corner down

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.190 
fold this top line in this corner down
the<00:00:46.320> center<00:00:46.739> crease<00:00:47.450> so<00:00:48.450> we're<00:00:48.600> gonna<00:00:48.719> fold<00:00:49.020> it

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
the center crease so we're gonna fold it

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.049 
the center crease so we're gonna fold it
like<00:00:49.379> so

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:53.059 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:56.090 

so<00:00:54.059> you<00:00:54.149> can<00:00:54.239> get<00:00:54.360> that<00:00:54.510> lined<00:00:54.809> up<00:00:55.020> crease<00:00:55.770> down

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
so you can get that lined up crease down

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.170 
so you can get that lined up crease down
the<00:00:56.480> same<00:00:57.480> to<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:57.809> other<00:00:57.930> side<00:00:58.280> and<00:00:59.280> with<00:00:59.879> this

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
the same to the other side and with this

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.029 
the same to the other side and with this
model<00:01:00.780> though<00:01:00.989> we<00:01:01.230> want<00:01:01.440> to<00:01:01.530> make<00:01:01.680> sure<00:01:01.710> that

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
model though we want to make sure that

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.920 
model though we want to make sure that
we<00:01:02.190> fold<00:01:02.520> these<00:01:02.699> goods<00:01:03.030> so<00:01:03.300> these<00:01:03.570> lines

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
we fold these goods so these lines

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.770 
we fold these goods so these lines
should<00:01:04.350> really<00:01:04.769> line<00:01:05.040> up<00:01:05.070> together<00:01:05.780> because

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
should really line up together because

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.539 
should really line up together because
our<00:01:07.049> next<00:01:07.590> step<00:01:07.830> is<00:01:08.130> to<00:01:08.700> fold<00:01:09.510> these<00:01:09.780> back<00:01:10.549> so

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
our next step is to fold these back so

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.460 
our next step is to fold these back so
if<00:01:11.670> these<00:01:11.880> are<00:01:11.939> uneven<00:01:12.810> it's<00:01:12.990> not<00:01:13.170> going<00:01:13.409> to

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
if these are uneven it's not going to

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.050 
if these are uneven it's not going to
fold<00:01:13.680> quite<00:01:14.100> right<00:01:14.340> so<00:01:14.520> you're<00:01:14.700> gonna<00:01:14.820> get<00:01:15.000> a

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
fold quite right so you're gonna get a

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.960 
fold quite right so you're gonna get a
crooked<00:01:15.570> line<00:01:15.750> cricket<00:01:16.590> fold<00:01:16.860> we<00:01:17.610> don't<00:01:17.790> want

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
crooked line cricket fold we don't want

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.719 
crooked line cricket fold we don't want
that<00:01:18.150> so<00:01:18.390> let's<00:01:18.600> make<00:01:18.750> sure<00:01:18.780> these<00:01:19.140> are<00:01:19.350> good

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:19.729 
that so let's make sure these are good

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:24.649 
that so let's make sure these are good
we'll<00:01:20.729> fold<00:01:21.210> this<00:01:21.450> back<00:01:23.000> stay<00:01:24.000> right<00:01:24.360> on<00:01:24.420> the

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
we'll fold this back stay right on the

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.690 
we'll fold this back stay right on the
center<00:01:25.200> crease<00:01:25.500> there<00:01:25.830> so<00:01:26.220> we<00:01:26.310> can<00:01:26.460> line<00:01:26.670> up

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
center crease there so we can line up

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.719 
center crease there so we can line up
our<00:01:26.970> point<00:01:27.299> with<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:27.659> center<00:01:27.960> crease<00:01:28.729> fold

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
our point with the center crease fold

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.330 
our point with the center crease fold
these<00:01:30.030> down<00:01:30.360> and<00:01:30.900> that<00:01:31.619> goes<00:01:31.829> right<00:01:32.040> to<00:01:32.100> the

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
these down and that goes right to the

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.620 
these down and that goes right to the
corner<00:01:34.220> okay<00:01:35.220> it<00:01:36.000> kind<00:01:36.180> of<00:01:36.210> looks<00:01:36.360> like<00:01:36.509> an

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
corner okay it kind of looks like an

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.200 
corner okay it kind of looks like an
envelope<00:01:36.750> at<00:01:37.140> this<00:01:37.290> point<00:01:37.880> now<00:01:38.880> what<00:01:39.060> we're

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
envelope at this point now what we're

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.160 
envelope at this point now what we're
gonna<00:01:39.329> do<00:01:39.509> is<00:01:39.570> we're<00:01:39.720> gonna<00:01:39.780> go<00:01:39.990> ahead<00:01:40.049> and

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
gonna do is we're gonna go ahead and

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.889 
gonna do is we're gonna go ahead and
flip<00:01:40.590> this<00:01:40.799> over<00:01:41.329> we're<00:01:42.329> gonna<00:01:42.420> do<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.720> same

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
flip this over we're gonna do the same

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.289 
flip this over we're gonna do the same
thing<00:01:42.960> so<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:43.680> top<00:01:43.950> lines<00:01:44.340> and<00:01:44.700> these<00:01:44.790> corners

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
thing so the top lines and these corners

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.660 
thing so the top lines and these corners
are<00:01:45.390> gonna<00:01:45.509> be<00:01:45.659> folded<00:01:46.140> in<00:01:46.290> along<00:01:47.070> this<00:01:47.310> center

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
are gonna be folded in along this center

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:57.209 
are gonna be folded in along this center
line<00:01:53.000> so<00:01:54.740> that<00:01:55.740> a<00:01:55.770> crease

00:01:57.209 --> 00:01:57.219 
line so that a crease

00:01:57.219 --> 00:02:04.499 
line so that a crease
same<00:01:58.119> thing<00:01:58.390> over<00:01:58.570> here<00:01:58.719> and<00:02:03.210> crease<00:02:04.210> that

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:04.509 
same thing over here and crease that

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:09.839 
same thing over here and crease that
down<00:02:04.899> just<00:02:05.229> like<00:02:06.069> so<00:02:07.049> okay<00:02:08.049> now<00:02:08.340> at<00:02:09.340> this<00:02:09.459> point

00:02:09.839 --> 00:02:09.849 
down just like so okay now at this point

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:11.309 
down just like so okay now at this point

a little bit off the nose but it'll be

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:55.570 
a little bit off the nose but it'll be
straight<00:04:52.460> across<00:04:53.590> okay<00:04:54.590> so<00:04:54.650> we're<00:04:55.100> gonna<00:04:55.250> fold

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:55.580 
straight across okay so we're gonna fold

this top wing line up right with that
bottom<00:05:21.350> wing<00:05:22.570> because<00:05:23.570> it's<00:05:23.870> better<00:05:24.140> that

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:24.290

00:06:06.909 --> 00:06:06.919 
much a straight line and we will flip

00:06:06.919 --> 00:06:10.089 
much a straight line and we will flip
this<00:06:07.129> over<00:06:08.199> then<00:06:09.199> we're<00:06:09.289> gonna<00:06:09.409> match<00:06:09.740> this

00:06:10.089 --> 00:06:10.099 
this over then we're gonna match this

00:06:10.099 --> 00:06:14.259 
this over then we're gonna match this
wing<00:06:10.429> with<00:06:11.089> the<00:06:11.209> other<00:06:11.360> wing<00:06:12.699> see<00:06:13.699> there's<00:06:14.119> the

this and we're gonna fold this down just
like<00:06:26.179> before<00:06:26.509> I<00:06:27.139> like<00:06:27.649> to<00:06:27.769> go<00:06:27.919> right<00:06:28.159> to<00:06:28.369> this

00:06:28.509 --> 00:06:28.519 
like before I like to go right to this

00:06:28.519 --> 00:06:32.399 
like before I like to go right to this
corner<00:06:29.439> so<00:06:30.439> I<00:06:30.499> go<00:06:30.649> right<00:06:30.860> to<00:06:31.009> that<00:06:31.039> corner<00:06:31.490> and

00:06:32.399 --> 00:06:32.409 
corner so I go right to that corner and

00:06:32.409 --> 00:06:35.829 
corner so I go right to that corner and
I'm<00:06:33.409> going<00:06:33.649> to<00:06:33.829> flip<00:06:34.219> this<00:06:34.430> over<00:06:34.669> and<00:06:35.089> I'm

00:06:35.829 --> 00:06:35.839 
I'm going to flip this over and I'm

00:06:35.839 --> 00:06:39.850 
I'm going to flip this over and I'm
going<00:06:36.139> to<00:06:36.199> match<00:06:36.680> these<00:06:38.289> make<00:06:39.289> sure<00:06:39.499> we<00:06:39.649> line

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:39.860 
going to match these make sure we line

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:45.639 
going to match these make sure we line
these<00:06:40.069> up<00:06:42.309> it's<00:06:43.309> like<00:06:43.490> so<00:06:44.499> hmm

00:06:45.639 --> 00:06:45.649 
these up it's like so hmm

00:06:45.649 --> 00:06:47.980 
these up it's like so hmm
so<00:06:46.279> now<00:06:46.459> if<00:06:46.579> we<00:06:46.639> open<00:06:46.819> it<00:06:47.119> up<00:06:47.269> we're<00:06:47.749> almost

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:47.990 
so now if we open it up we're almost

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:54.730 
so now if we open it up we're almost
there<00:06:49.389> straighten<00:06:50.389> these<00:06:50.479> out<00:06:53.229> but<00:06:54.229> we<00:06:54.559> have

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:54.740 
there straighten these out but we have

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:57.219 
there straighten these out but we have
one<00:06:55.009> more<00:06:55.189> step<00:06:55.519> so<00:06:56.449> now<00:06:56.659> we're<00:06:56.809> gonna<00:06:56.899> flip

00:06:57.219 --> 00:06:57.229 
one more step so now we're gonna flip

00:06:57.229 --> 00:06:59.499 
one more step so now we're gonna flip
the<00:06:57.409> plane<00:06:57.649> over<00:06:58.029> then<00:06:59.029> we're<00:06:59.149> gonna<00:06:59.240> take

00:06:59.499 --> 00:06:59.509 
the plane over then we're gonna take

00:06:59.509 --> 00:07:01.119 
the plane over then we're gonna take
these<00:06:59.779> corners<00:07:00.169> and<00:07:00.289> we're<00:07:00.499> gonna<00:07:00.619> fold<00:07:00.979> them

00:07:01.119 --> 00:07:01.129 
these corners and we're gonna fold them

00:07:01.129 --> 00:07:02.889 
these corners and we're gonna fold them
in<00:07:01.279> but<00:07:01.490> we're<00:07:01.610> gonna<00:07:01.699> fold<00:07:02.059> them<00:07:02.179> straight<00:07:02.689> in

00:07:02.889 --> 00:07:02.899 
in but we're gonna fold them straight in

00:07:02.899 --> 00:07:04.899 
in but we're gonna fold them straight in
so<00:07:03.289> we're<00:07:03.409> gonna<00:07:03.499> point<00:07:03.889> this<00:07:04.099> one<00:07:04.369> towards

00:07:04.899 --> 00:07:04.909 
so we're gonna point this one towards

00:07:04.909 --> 00:07:07.329
