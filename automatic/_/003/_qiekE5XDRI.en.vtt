00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 here there was a black and naked no 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.160
 we were in the review of the will 13 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.660
 which is in a small correction 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.300
 of mistakes some little things were added 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.849
 that you asked for but I am already in the 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.349
 in the blog launcher in the of the wheel 26 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.420
 works well for me except the textures 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.160
 names to put textures in the agÃ¼il 12 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.170
 but let me use some modes 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.970
 also if I leave the world the blog 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.350
 launcher closes me the spot so it's 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.269
 another another case so we have to 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.939
 wait for the blog launcher to come out 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:30.390
 his version of 13 or beta days me 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.969
 it seems more and well something that I noticed is that 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.260
 the worlds charge me instantly 

00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:35.280
 they see they no longer charge or anything simply 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.129
 the world is charging me 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.660
 the teacher we will load all and ready 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:40.950
 of project I say to you with the blogger 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.140
 and its version will work 12 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.910
 perfectly the mods that already 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.559
 we had good not so perfectly but 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.420
 with some landlords but now it's 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.670
 good to test them 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.710
 and they added the tools in creative 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.940
 which it saved both because for 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.170
 the only good thing that I see this is for 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.149
 take a picture with a sword of 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.379
 diamond and for I no longer find a case in 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.000
 times they had added the click 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.339
 wineries that is already there but then it is not 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.449
 they add for some reason that is supposed 

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:04.860
 that they added it because they had 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.110
 added in version they had added 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.789
 in the list of changes or in the list of 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.259
 change look from previous versions 

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:12.509
 of minecraft also corrected 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:15.090
 some things in regards to fishing that 

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:16.680
 they had problems some of me the truth is not 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.110
 I've had more mistakes since the flight 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.399
 11 I think or think they did have 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.080
 as many details but nothing 

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:23.520
 out of the weird they think that 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.929
 with this you can leave the most 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.179
 stable wrong approach editing 

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:28.619
 It would be maybe the last buil if it's not 

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:32.159
 which is some other error or mistake out there 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.840
 and they already know like those of ios and 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.220
 windows phone I think they are waiting 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.440
 and at 0.11 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.789
 although the audio is not that we do not 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.310
 they give us crap and that's why we 

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:43.200
 We tried the wilds to just us 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.670
 they give stable things and blah blah blah blah blah 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.709
 we know that they are also dying to play 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.299
 the suite but then there is little to 

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:51.000
 that comes out the established and they can 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:53.820
 have in their pinches iphone 10 and their 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.530
 pinches windowsphone 9.500 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.090
 and then you can try it too 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.530
 although we already know that even if the 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.710
 stable always bring wook and finish 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.840
 taking more versions the 0.11 point 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.280
 10.2 and things like that but not good 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.240
 little things and little things guys and the truth 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.940
 I would have preferred that they will add the 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.140
 click but you say this because 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.760
 also said that they have added it and not 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.670
 no no just does not appear from the 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.230
 build I do not know how much and a victory to 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.420
 I'm doing well the blog lunchbox more or 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.650
 less and they can try the mods they let 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.820
 stop the entire video description 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.620
 download link in the description of 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:24.000
 shine and everything is in the description not 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.130
 they added a lot so there's no more 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.080
 talk and well I hope that the 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.550
 errors and have been solved I am 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.830
 direct me but see you in the next 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:36.830
 video until next time 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.830
 bye
