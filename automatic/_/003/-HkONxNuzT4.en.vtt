these two the health bars also be

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:55.440 
these two the health bars also be
separated<00:01:54.250> so<00:01:54.340> you<00:01:54.430> can<00:01:54.580> take<00:01:54.760> one<00:01:55.300> down

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
separated so you can take one down

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.380 
separated so you can take one down
individually<00:01:55.830> and<00:01:56.940> with<00:01:57.940> that<00:01:58.090> we<00:01:58.300> already
