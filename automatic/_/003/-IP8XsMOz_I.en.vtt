00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.259
 Hello, I want to tell you how I do 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:11.460
 tomato juice taste so familiar to everyone with 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:15.920
 childhood and who grows tomatoes that 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:19.880
 knows what a certain percentage 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:25.289
 non-standard we what we need tomatoes 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:31.619
 clean washed mixer pan of the desired 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:38.120
 I do the size of a knife so I make tomatoes 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:38.120
 cut into slices and cut out the middle 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:48.020
 accordingly all this is a food processor 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:08.119
 accordingly, it all turns into 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:21.380
 homogeneous mass further this whole mass 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:23.450
 poured podrelyu pot put on 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:31.100
 very weak moment so far all 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:34.250
 made but here after all my 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:38.149
 action I got this here 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:41.500
 saucepan juice with pulp that is 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:46.460
 of this mass and so much 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:51.950
 scraps of any wormhole folders and so 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:55.729
 further now this pot we put on 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:02:00.709
 weak weak fire in her volume 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:03.860
 approximately 8 liters to 

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:08.899
 he kept salt better just needed 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:15.440
 and more per liter 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:17.980
 I make a spoon of tea sugar and it tastes 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.959
 actually will not change but 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:28.160
 helps to preserve the color of the 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:32.709
 juice should be brewed periodically stirring 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.709
 so that it does not burn below 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:43.560
 after the boil can be minutes 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:51.060
 Fifteen-twenty more precisely it is not possible 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:55.530
 need to boil constantly stirring still 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:59.580
 for piquancy you can add per liter 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:01.410
 a couple of black peppercorns but I don't 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.630
 I do it once I tried for some reason 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:08.970
 I like the classics 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:14.940
 let's say here 20 minutes have passed since 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:18.630
 after boiling my juice he fell 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:21.209
 now you need to turn off and let it cool 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:27.920
 then you will need all this mass 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:27.920
 strain through cheesecloth or sieve 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:34.940
 got cold 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:38.540
 filtering I'm already here 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:42.860
 began to plant why he chews two stages 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:45.380
 because the juice should be removed if the same 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:46.370
 someone does not like copious amounts 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:51.320
 locality 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:56.240
 just need to strain through a sieve I already 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:59.380
 once through a sieve and then what remains 

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:02.270
 already surviving through gauze 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:05.900
 firstly there will be a lot more pulp 

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:08.890
 and secondly the output quantity of the finished 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:12.520
 product will naturally increase 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:12.520
 20 percent 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:18.320
 at the end of the process turned out 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:22.390
 the next result is the amount 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:27.680
 juice and that amount of jim 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:35.570
 Well, this is without taking into account 3 drunk me 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:43.310
 Glasses start Butlerova her so 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:48.800
 say the juice I boiled for 2 minutes 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:51.130
 by boiling spill here now here such 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.130
 bottles
