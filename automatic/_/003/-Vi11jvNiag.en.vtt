00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
I wanted to try a liquid foundation

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.450 
I wanted to try a liquid foundation
because<00:00:16.920> I<00:00:17.039> felt<00:00:17.369> like<00:00:17.520> my<00:00:17.580> studio<00:00:18.359> fix<00:00:19.320> powder

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:19.460

because I felt like my studio fix powder
foundation<00:00:20.460> which<00:00:20.580> I<00:00:20.760> absolutely<00:00:20.939> love<00:00:21.689> but

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
foundation which I absolutely love but

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.170 
foundation which I absolutely love but
it<00:00:22.529> just<00:00:22.560> wasn't<00:00:22.830> lasting<00:00:23.580> me<00:00:23.730> as<00:00:23.820> long<00:00:23.970> as<00:00:24.119> I

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
it just wasn't lasting me as long as I

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.109 
it just wasn't lasting me as long as I
as<00:00:24.359> I<00:00:24.779> liked<00:00:25.019> um<00:00:25.350> I<00:00:25.830> wanted<00:00:26.460> to<00:00:26.519> class<00:00:26.849> all<00:00:27.090> the

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
as I liked um I wanted to class all the

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.460 
as I liked um I wanted to class all the
way<00:00:27.210> through<00:00:27.480> dance<00:00:27.720> practice<00:00:28.230> and

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
way through dance practice and

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:29.900 
way through dance practice and
everything<00:00:29.039> and<00:00:29.189> so<00:00:29.279> I<00:00:29.340> thought<00:00:29.490> maybe<00:00:29.550> you

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
everything and so I thought maybe you

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.339 
everything and so I thought maybe you
know<00:00:30.000> a<00:00:30.029> liquid<00:00:30.449> foundation<00:00:30.900> would<00:00:31.050> do<00:00:31.199> that

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
know a liquid foundation would do that

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.440 
know a liquid foundation would do that
so<00:00:31.590> I<00:00:31.619> went<00:00:32.009> on<00:00:32.189> neck<00:00:32.460> and<00:00:32.790> I<00:00:32.969> did<00:00:33.270> a<00:00:33.300> whole

so I went on neck and I did a whole

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:34.850 
so I went on neck and I did a whole
bunch<00:00:33.660> of<00:00:33.750> things<00:00:33.809> and<00:00:34.230> I<00:00:34.290> didn't<00:00:34.530> buy<00:00:34.649> for
