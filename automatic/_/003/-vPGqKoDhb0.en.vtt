thought was perfect
and<00:00:42.239> wonderful<00:00:43.079> and<00:00:43.260> thought<00:00:43.739> it<00:00:43.890> was<00:00:44.010> just<00:00:44.070> so

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:44.960

beautifully<00:00:45.960> done<00:00:46.170> and<00:00:46.500> then<00:00:46.680> there's<00:00:46.980> a

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
beautifully done and then there's a

beautifully done and then there's a
romance<00:00:47.430> pit<00:00:47.700> which<00:00:47.940> I<00:00:48.120> would<00:00:48.660> like<00:00:48.780> to<00:00:48.899> split

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
romance pit which I would like to split

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.410 
romance pit which I would like to split
in<00:00:49.440> half<00:00:49.649> half<00:00:50.129> of<00:00:50.309> it<00:00:50.460> I<00:00:50.550> thought<00:00:50.789> was<00:00:50.940> really

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
in half half of it I thought was really

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.600 
in half half of it I thought was really
really<00:00:51.719> well<00:00:51.960> done<00:00:52.260> and<00:00:52.289> so<00:00:52.800> lovely<00:00:53.070> and<00:00:53.489> the

really well done and so lovely and the

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.549 
really well done and so lovely and the
other<00:00:53.789> half<00:00:54.120> of<00:00:54.239> that<00:00:54.420> was<00:00:54.840> just<00:00:55.110> kind<00:00:55.289> of<00:00:55.440> oh

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
other half of that was just kind of oh

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.770 
other half of that was just kind of oh
really<00:00:55.949> cheesy<00:00:56.520> and<00:00:56.910> I<00:00:57.000> didn't<00:00:57.329> think<00:00:57.570> it

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
really cheesy and I didn't think it

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.930 
really cheesy and I didn't think it
worked<00:00:58.020> that<00:00:58.320> well<00:00:58.500> but<00:00:58.859> overall<00:00:59.309> as<00:00:59.489> a<00:00:59.520> movie

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
worked that well but overall as a movie

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.060 
worked that well but overall as a movie
I<00:00:59.969> still<00:01:00.359> really<00:01:00.809> really<00:01:01.050> enjoyed<00:01:01.530> it<00:01:01.739> so

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
I thought didn't really work in the

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.760 
I thought didn't really work in the
movie<00:01:05.549> Augustus<00:01:06.330> staring<00:01:06.900> at<00:01:07.049> hazel<00:01:07.500> when<00:01:07.650> he

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
you know gave me a bit of a flashback to

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.340 
you know gave me a bit of a flashback to
Twilight<00:01:12.030> I<00:01:12.510> just<00:01:12.720> thought<00:01:12.840> it<00:01:12.960> was<00:01:13.020> a<00:01:13.140> little

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
Twilight I just thought it was a little

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.440 
Twilight I just thought it was a little
bit<00:01:13.470> too<00:01:13.830> much<00:01:14.010> and<00:01:14.520> then<00:01:14.670> of<00:01:14.790> course<00:01:15.030> we<00:01:15.240> have

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
bit too much and then of course we have

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.630 
bit too much and then of course we have
the<00:01:15.780> cigarette<00:01:16.290> metaphor<00:01:16.830> a<00:01:17.100> thing<00:01:17.400> that<00:01:17.610> I

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
the cigarette metaphor a thing that I

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.330 
the cigarette metaphor a thing that I
thought<00:01:18.000> worked<00:01:18.570> really<00:01:18.930> well<00:01:19.080> in<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:20.070> book

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
thought worked really well in the book

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.149 
thought worked really well in the book
just<00:01:20.580> didn't<00:01:21.180> translate<00:01:21.689> to<00:01:22.350> screen<00:01:22.740> that

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
just didn't translate to screen that

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.100 
just didn't translate to screen that
well<00:01:23.400> just<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:23.939> image<00:01:24.150> of<00:01:24.270> him<00:01:24.420> with<00:01:24.630> unlit

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
well just the image of him with unlit

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.830 
well just the image of him with unlit
cigarette<00:01:25.650> in<00:01:25.830> his<00:01:25.920> mouth<00:01:25.979> I<00:01:26.549> just<00:01:26.939> found<00:01:27.420> very

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
cigarette in his mouth I just found very

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.600 
cigarette in his mouth I just found very
strange<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.770> only<00:01:28.950> time<00:01:29.280> I<00:01:29.310> thought<00:01:29.549> it

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
strange the only time I thought it

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:30.830 
strange the only time I thought it
worked<00:01:29.820> was<00:01:30.060> when<00:01:30.210> they<00:01:30.299> were<00:01:30.390> on<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.600> plane

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
worked was when they were on the plane

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.149 
worked was when they were on the plane
and<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.140> air<00:01:31.259> hostess<00:01:31.409> was<00:01:31.680> telling<00:01:32.009> him<00:01:32.130> that

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
and the air hostess was telling him that

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.190 
and the air hostess was telling him that
that<00:01:32.670> metaphor<00:01:33.090> wasn't<00:01:33.540> allowed<00:01:33.840> on<00:01:34.110> the

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
that metaphor wasn't allowed on the

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.600 
that metaphor wasn't allowed on the
plane<00:01:34.439> and<00:01:34.770> then<00:01:34.860> of<00:01:35.040> course<00:01:35.220> there<00:01:35.369> is<00:01:35.490> the

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
plane and then of course there is the

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.100 
plane and then of course there is the
kiss<00:01:35.880> in<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.180> end<00:01:36.329> Frank<00:01:36.659> house<00:01:36.869> now<00:01:37.079> I

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
kiss in the end Frank house now I

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.810 
kiss in the end Frank house now I
thought<00:01:37.380> that<00:01:37.619> at<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:37.920> beginning<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.490> kiss

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
thought that at the beginning the kiss

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.060 
thought that at the beginning the kiss
was<00:01:39.090> fine<00:01:39.420> and<00:01:39.750> then<00:01:39.960> they<00:01:40.049> kind<00:01:40.290> of<00:01:40.409> continue

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
was fine and then they kind of continue

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.249 
was fine and then they kind of continue
kissing<00:01:41.549> and<00:01:41.759> then<00:01:42.030> there<00:01:42.509> was<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:42.899> applause

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
kissing and then there was the applause

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.230 
kissing and then there was the applause
once<00:01:43.710> again<00:01:43.829> worked<00:01:44.549> really<00:01:44.759> well<00:01:44.880> in<00:01:45.030> the

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
once again worked really well in the

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.760 
once again worked really well in the
book<00:01:45.270> and<00:01:45.689> seeing<00:01:45.899> it<00:01:46.020> translated<00:01:46.470> into<00:01:46.619> the

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
book and seeing it translated into the

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.230 
book and seeing it translated into the
movie<00:01:47.040> just<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.490> thought<00:01:47.670> was<00:01:47.820> really<00:01:48.119> odd

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
movie just the thought was really odd

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.690 
movie just the thought was really odd
and<00:01:48.600> then<00:01:48.810> finally<00:01:49.170> there<00:01:49.409> just<00:01:49.710> some<00:01:50.250> quotes

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
and then finally there just some quotes

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.120 
and then finally there just some quotes
that<00:01:51.180> I<00:01:51.450> just<00:01:51.780> wish<00:01:52.079> I<00:01:52.350> could<00:01:52.530> go<00:01:52.710> in<00:01:52.890> and

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
that I just wish I could go in and

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.179 
that I just wish I could go in and
slightly<00:01:53.700> tweak<00:01:54.360> a<00:01:54.600> lot<00:01:54.899> of<00:01:55.049> it<00:01:55.200> does<00:01:55.619> work

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
slightly tweak a lot of it does work

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.770 
slightly tweak a lot of it does work
when<00:01:56.490> it<00:01:56.610> said<00:01:56.850> out<00:01:56.969> loud<00:01:57.180> and<00:01:57.360> some<00:01:57.570> of<00:01:57.659> it

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
when it said out loud and some of it

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.690 
when it said out loud and some of it
just<00:01:57.810> needs<00:01:58.110> to<00:01:58.229> be<00:01:58.409> changed<00:01:58.920> slightly<00:01:59.399> I

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
just needs to be changed slightly I

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.789 
just needs to be changed slightly I
think<00:02:00.210> for<00:02:00.570> example<00:02:00.659> the<00:02:01.110> I'm<00:02:01.350> on<00:02:01.380> a<00:02:01.560> roller

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
think for example the I'm on a roller

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.230 
think for example the I'm on a roller
coaster<00:02:01.890> that<00:02:02.430> only<00:02:02.490> goes<00:02:02.729> up<00:02:02.880> my<00:02:03.090> friend

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
coaster that only goes up my friend

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.240 
coaster that only goes up my friend
quote<00:02:03.930> I<00:02:04.110> feel<00:02:04.350> would<00:02:04.710> have<00:02:04.829> worked<00:02:05.040> a<00:02:05.130> lot

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
quote I feel would have worked a lot

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.399 
quote I feel would have worked a lot
better<00:02:05.399> if<00:02:05.700> the<00:02:05.969> my<00:02:06.149> friend<00:02:06.509> bit<00:02:06.840> at<00:02:07.079> the<00:02:07.259> end

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
better if the my friend bit at the end

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.080 
better if the my friend bit at the end
would<00:02:07.770> have<00:02:07.890> been<00:02:08.039> taken<00:02:08.399> out<00:02:08.520> cuz<00:02:08.940> I<00:02:08.970> feel

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
would have been taken out cuz I feel

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.339 
would have been taken out cuz I feel
like<00:02:09.270> that<00:02:09.539> in<00:02:09.780> a<00:02:09.959> move

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
like that in a move

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:11.630 
like that in a move
it's<00:02:10.560> kind<00:02:10.739> of<00:02:10.769> what<00:02:10.920> pushes<00:02:11.129> it<00:02:11.370> over<00:02:11.430> the

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
it's kind of what pushes it over the

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.190 
it's kind of what pushes it over the
edge<00:02:11.760> okay<00:02:12.180> so<00:02:12.239> that<00:02:12.540> was<00:02:12.659> kind<00:02:12.780> of<00:02:12.810> my<00:02:12.959> main

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
edge okay so that was kind of my main

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.229 
edge okay so that was kind of my main
criticism<00:02:13.920> of<00:02:14.099> the<00:02:14.249> movie<00:02:14.549> and<00:02:14.670> let's<00:02:14.849> move<00:02:15.030> on

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
criticism of the movie and let's move on

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:17.119 
criticism of the movie and let's move on
to<00:02:15.359> all<00:02:15.569> the<00:02:15.780> parts<00:02:16.079> I<00:02:16.200> absolutely<00:02:16.620> loved

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:17.129 
to all the parts I absolutely loved

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:19.039 
to all the parts I absolutely loved
first<00:02:17.609> of<00:02:17.700> all<00:02:17.760> the<00:02:17.849> actors<00:02:18.180> really<00:02:18.629> really

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:19.049 
first of all the actors really really

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:21.229 
first of all the actors really really
looked<00:02:19.319> like<00:02:19.439> teenagers<00:02:20.010> and<00:02:20.370> not<00:02:20.459> like<00:02:20.609> 25

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
looked like teenagers and not like 25

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.149 
looked like teenagers and not like 25
year<00:02:21.510> olds<00:02:21.719> trying<00:02:21.989> to<00:02:22.079> play<00:02:22.230> teenagers

00:02:23.149 --> 00:02:23.159 
year olds trying to play teenagers

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:25.009 
year olds trying to play teenagers
I<00:02:23.189> thought<00:02:23.400> she<00:02:23.670> leaned<00:02:23.879> in<00:02:24.030> particular<00:02:24.749> was

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:25.019 
I thought she leaned in particular was

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:28.610 
I thought she leaned in particular was
absolutely<00:02:25.980> fantastic<00:02:26.569> as<00:02:27.569> hazel<00:02:27.900> a<00:02:28.319> lot<00:02:28.500> of

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
absolutely fantastic as hazel a lot of

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.280 
absolutely fantastic as hazel a lot of
movies<00:02:29.040> can't<00:02:29.760> really<00:02:30.060> pull<00:02:30.329> off<00:02:30.510> the<00:02:30.840> oh<00:02:31.079> I'm

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
movies can't really pull off the oh I'm

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.199 
movies can't really pull off the oh I'm
not<00:02:31.439> wearing<00:02:31.769> any<00:02:31.950> makeup<00:02:32.069> look<00:02:32.849> so<00:02:32.879> they

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
not wearing any makeup look so they

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:34.759 
not wearing any makeup look so they
still<00:02:33.569> put<00:02:33.750> loads<00:02:33.900> and<00:02:34.049> loads<00:02:34.079> of<00:02:34.260> makeup<00:02:34.379> on<00:02:34.739> a

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:34.769 
still put loads and loads of makeup on a

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:36.050 
still put loads and loads of makeup on a
character<00:02:35.099> who's<00:02:35.340> not<00:02:35.519> supposed<00:02:35.879> to<00:02:35.939> be

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
character who's not supposed to be

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.699 
character who's not supposed to be
wearing<00:02:36.269> makeup<00:02:36.510> so<00:02:36.780> I<00:02:36.810> thought<00:02:37.109> that<00:02:37.379> the<00:02:37.620> way

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
wearing makeup so I thought that the way

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:40.250 
wearing makeup so I thought that the way
hazel<00:02:38.159> looked<00:02:38.519> clothes<00:02:39.030> and<00:02:39.389> everything<00:02:39.870> was

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
hazel looked clothes and everything was

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.619 
hazel looked clothes and everything was
absolutely<00:02:40.739> spot-on<00:02:41.459> I<00:02:41.879> love<00:02:42.150> from<00:02:42.329> the<00:02:42.480> first

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:42.629 
absolutely spot-on I love from the first

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:44.209

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:44.219 
scenes between hazel and Gus but they

00:02:44.219 --> 00:02:45.740 
scenes between hazel and Gus but they
were<00:02:44.340> talking<00:02:44.519> about<00:02:44.819> their<00:02:45.180> favorite<00:02:45.359> books

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
were talking about their favorite books

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.390 
were talking about their favorite books
I<00:02:45.870> thought<00:02:46.019> it<00:02:46.169> was<00:02:46.260> really<00:02:46.620> funny<00:02:46.980> and<00:02:47.189> this

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
I thought it was really funny and this

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.339 
I thought it was really funny and this
movie<00:02:47.669> had<00:02:47.819> so<00:02:48.239> many<00:02:48.480> laugh-out-loud<00:02:49.079> moments

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:49.349

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:51.199 
movie had so many laugh-out-loud moments
I've<00:02:49.949> not<00:02:50.129> seen<00:02:50.310> it<00:02:50.400> with<00:02:50.519> two<00:02:50.790> different

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:53.839 
I've not seen it with two different
audiences<00:02:51.900> and<00:02:52.139> everyone<00:02:53.010> was<00:02:53.219> just<00:02:53.400> laughing

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:53.849 
audiences and everyone was just laughing

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:55.339 
audiences and everyone was just laughing
all<00:02:54.030> the<00:02:54.209> time<00:02:54.389> you<00:02:54.719> know<00:02:54.810> when<00:02:54.989> they<00:02:55.109> weren't

sludge<00:03:45.629> a<00:03:45.870> good<00:03:46.199> job<00:03:46.500> of<00:03:46.799> showing<00:03:46.859> Amsterdam

sludge a good job of showing Amsterdam

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:49.219 
sludge a good job of showing Amsterdam

00:03:49.219 --> 00:03:49.229 
cuz I didn't really film on sunny days

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:51.559 
cuz I didn't really film on sunny days
and<00:03:49.739> sunny<00:03:50.069> days<00:03:50.310> is<00:03:50.459> what<00:03:50.579> Amsterdam<00:03:51.090> is<00:03:51.329> at

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:51.569 
and sunny days is what Amsterdam is at

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:53.509 
and sunny days is what Amsterdam is at
its<00:03:51.780> ultimate<00:03:52.019> best<00:03:52.709> but<00:03:53.189> they<00:03:53.280> still<00:03:53.489> just

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 
its ultimate best but they still just

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:55.219 
its ultimate best but they still just
managed<00:03:54.060> to<00:03:54.209> convey<00:03:54.569> kind<00:03:54.810> of<00:03:54.900> the<00:03:54.989> realness

00:03:55.219 --> 00:03:55.229 
managed to convey kind of the realness

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:56.809 
managed to convey kind of the realness
of<00:03:55.620> it<00:03:55.680> it<00:03:55.799> didn't<00:03:56.040> look<00:03:56.189> like<00:03:56.459> a<00:03:56.489> Hollywood

00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:56.819 
of it it didn't look like a Hollywood

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:58.969 
of it it didn't look like a Hollywood
version<00:03:57.239> of<00:03:57.659> Amsterdam<00:03:58.290> which<00:03:58.500> I<00:03:58.590> really

00:03:58.969 --> 00:03:58.979 
version of Amsterdam which I really
