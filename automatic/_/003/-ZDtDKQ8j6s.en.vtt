of walk you through some features right

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.389 
of walk you through some features right
now

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
now

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.880 
now
one<00:00:56.940> of<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.120> neatest<00:00:57.329> things<00:00:57.930> that<00:00:58.260> is<00:00:58.530> not<00:00:58.710> on

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
one of the neatest things that is not on

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.729 
one of the neatest things that is not on
here<00:00:58.920> is<00:00:59.370> with<00:00:59.699> this<00:00:59.910> Emacs<00:01:00.510> pumper<00:01:01.350> design

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
here is with this Emacs pumper design

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.560 
here is with this Emacs pumper design
the<00:01:02.370> benefit<00:01:02.850> of<00:01:02.879> it<00:01:05.090> and<00:01:06.090> I'll<00:01:06.270> show<00:01:06.299> you

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
the benefit of it and I'll show you

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.499 
the benefit of it and I'll show you
right<00:01:06.810> now<00:01:06.869> that<00:01:07.650> this<00:01:07.799> is<00:01:07.860> an<00:01:08.190> e-1<00:01:08.670> pump<00:01:09.030> it

00:01:09.499 --> 00:01:09.509 
right now that this is an e-1 pump it

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:12.469 
right now that this is an e-1 pump it
has<00:01:09.659> a<00:01:09.690> 1500<00:01:10.619> GPM<00:01:11.159> pump<00:01:11.520> and<00:01:12.000> as<00:01:12.119> you<00:01:12.270> can<00:01:12.420> tell

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
has a 1500 GPM pump and as you can tell

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.830 
has a 1500 GPM pump and as you can tell
this<00:01:13.470> is<00:01:13.530> a<00:01:13.740> new<00:01:14.009> concept<00:01:14.280> in<00:01:14.790> design<00:01:15.149> and<00:01:15.720> we

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
this is a new concept in design and we

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.310 
this is a new concept in design and we
have<00:01:15.869> several<00:01:16.530> of<00:01:16.680> these<00:01:17.869> apparatus<00:01:18.869> out<00:01:18.990> in

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
have several of these apparatus out in

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.859 
have several of these apparatus out in
the<00:01:19.409> field<00:01:19.649> now<00:01:19.860> with<00:01:20.550> this<00:01:20.790> design<00:01:21.180> with<00:01:21.750> the

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
the field now with this design with the

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.249 
the field now with this design with the
Emacs<00:01:22.290> pumper<00:01:22.860> it<00:01:23.310> allows<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:24.119> pump<00:01:24.360> housing

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
Emacs pumper it allows the pump housing

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.249 
Emacs pumper it allows the pump housing
to<00:01:25.560> be<00:01:25.740> extremely<00:01:26.340> packaged<00:01:27.030> and<00:01:27.240> short<00:01:27.600> so

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
to be extremely packaged and short so

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:29.870 
to be extremely packaged and short so
it's<00:01:28.410> going<00:01:28.530> to<00:01:28.590> allow<00:01:28.649> for<00:01:29.160> an<00:01:29.220> extremely

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
it's going to allow for an extremely

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.450 
it's going to allow for an extremely
tight<00:01:30.179> will<00:01:30.600> base<00:01:30.810> more<00:01:31.619> maneuverable<00:01:32.310> out

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
tight will base more maneuverable out

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.960 
tight will base more maneuverable out
there

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
there

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.660 
there
it<00:01:33.179> also<00:01:33.330> gives<00:01:33.750> options<00:01:34.050> here<00:01:34.679> or<00:01:35.250> there<00:01:35.550> are

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
it also gives options here or there are

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.969 
it also gives options here or there are
speed<00:01:35.970> lay<00:01:36.149> options<00:01:36.660> and<00:01:36.899> their<00:01:37.410> cross<00:01:37.649> legs

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
speed lay options and their cross legs

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.010 
speed lay options and their cross legs
so<00:01:38.220> right<00:01:38.429> here<00:01:38.670> you're<00:01:39.090> seeing<00:01:39.539> the<00:01:39.780> speed

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
so right here you're seeing the speed

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.139 
so right here you're seeing the speed
lays<00:01:40.289> below<00:01:41.009> that<00:01:41.340> they<00:01:41.429> can<00:01:41.610> be<00:01:41.700> pulled<00:01:41.940> out

00:01:42.139 --> 00:01:42.149 
lays below that they can be pulled out

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:44.090 
lays below that they can be pulled out
firefighters<00:01:42.780> can<00:01:42.960> load<00:01:43.140> their<00:01:43.320> hose<00:01:43.470> easily

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
firefighters can load their hose easily

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.130 
firefighters can load their hose easily
and<00:01:44.490> just<00:01:44.700> put<00:01:44.970> it<00:01:45.090> straight<00:01:45.179> in<00:01:45.479> there<00:01:45.659> then

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
and just put it straight in there then

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.990 
and just put it straight in there then
it<00:01:46.259> also<00:01:46.380> has<00:01:46.679> their<00:01:46.950> speed<00:01:47.190> lay<00:01:47.369> up<00:01:47.520> here<00:01:47.789> and

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
it also has their speed lay up here and

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.419 
it also has their speed lay up here and
then<00:01:48.119> back<00:01:48.300> board<00:01:48.569> storage<00:01:49.050> so<00:01:49.679> you<00:01:49.740> can<00:01:50.250> see

00:01:50.419 --> 00:01:50.429 
then back board storage so you can see

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:53.090 
then back board storage so you can see
again<00:01:50.700> how<00:01:50.970> compact<00:01:51.600> it<00:01:51.810> is<00:01:51.869> but<00:01:52.860> you're<00:01:52.979> not

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
again how compact it is but you're not

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.309 
again how compact it is but you're not
losing<00:01:53.399> any<00:01:53.789> type<00:01:54.060> of<00:01:54.090> performance<00:01:54.569> it's<00:01:55.110> also

00:01:55.309 --> 00:01:55.319 
losing any type of performance it's also
