 the clothes to buy from whom you bought 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:50.650

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:55.690
 I wanted clothes like this every day. 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:57.550
 basic clothes and cold to use 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.430
 At home, they are not bad things. 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:02.590
 but with a very high quality 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:03.970
 good price and also because so 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:06.820
 usually here for us to find 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:08.560
 thick things of good quality to us 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.659
 you have to pay much more 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.130
 we pay less for things 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:13.840
 legal quality 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.450
 I'll show you some little things that 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:19.420
 brought because he brought enough stuff 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:21.219
 It's really little, nothing much. 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.380
 interesting but only for you to know 

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:26.920
 the mark with this one is a 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:29.170
 Little monkey to put by 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:32.170
 dress up not only has one 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:39.130
 button that is not forrÃ³ dinho is 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:46.240
 a super cute little kitchen type line 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:49.270
 of pullovers in 1-1 of pozinho or 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:52.060
 cylinders in line 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:55.749
 concluding basic but so were 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:58.119
 clothes of good basic even of 

00:01:55.749 --> 00:02:00.789
 cold basics I asked him for 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:02.920
 with this path of wool has the 

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:04.420
 neighboring buttons here everything is lost 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.479
 for one year 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:10.360
 That's because now a year is going to be July. 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:12.159
 so it will be cold, he will go 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:16.100
 Being able to use Ezekiel is going to buy 

00:02:12.159 --> 00:02:19.220
 different a very good shirt 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:21.380
 to leave even more warmth a 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:24.470
 different shirt that he found there 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:27.290
 liked then he brought this from here 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.910
 Momentum wear normal even that 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.710
 sweatshirt we use is much more 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:34.600
 thicker than those who give letters that 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:42.050
 showed it to you is a year you too 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:43.400
 1218 is very warm and much warmer 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.560
 than those of the letter 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.500
 He already is but already a clothes much more 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.970
 full bodied even a thing that I like 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.580
 that they have enough in the United States 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:55.340
 in europe in june 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:03:05.480
 So, sleeping is very cool. 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:08.060
 it's not a super toasty put it 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:11.840
 It was there, in 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:13.310
 if it is from 9 to 12 months it is huge and 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.500
 I think a baby for nine months between 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:19.460
 here imagine the book is eight 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:22.750
 animals and take quite a lot 

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:26.510
 cute little my husband also bought 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:32.270
 with people so hot for her 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:33.140
 There is a nice 

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:35.570
 option 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:44.480
 Something else he bought basic more 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:47.660
 lines so the knife screws the line 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:50.870
 in the face that nilsinho is to put with boris 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:54.170
 long sleeve underneath 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:57.470
 so is this has been a ke ha and 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:04:04.060
 continue the suede understands cambuci 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:12.070
 velvet and this caused and velvet 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:17.020
 He pretends to go there too, he has too. 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:19.940
 one more little gimmick 

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:24.760
 paper that is also thin 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:28.630
 there's also a hottest bar 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:31.140
 It's not bad, but I'm not there yet. 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:31.140
 wind 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:40.000
 I do not know right as well as in relation 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:42.790
 to wear but the fabric looks good 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.670
 delicious that of human clean 

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:48.130
 So this is personal, these were the 

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:50.140
 most basic little pieces that he 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:52.120
 I bought it, I fucking liked it because 

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:54.820
 things to stay at home then to 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:56.320
 Who has to do the lay-out there and pass 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:58.450
 in front and um, I think it's worth 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:01.060
 worth entering because the price is good and the 

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:03.040
 Quality is cool, too. 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:05.640
 I was one more tip for you kisses 

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:05.640
