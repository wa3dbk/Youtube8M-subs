00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:11.670
 hello world knew that there are people who 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:16.590
 they are fond of old objects like 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:21.600
 for example this dkv manufactured in 1956 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:26.609
 stl manufactured in 1972 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:29.359
 look only this eats manufactured in 1965 and 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:33.300
 this one is flÃ¡vio men made in 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:35.750
 1964 owner of these three and more others 33 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.750
 cars 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:44.730
 you started your collection in 1988 is this 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.410
 I was 23 years old and bought my 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.660
 career first, and when do you 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.280
 Do you think that you will stop buying a car? 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.260
 my collection ended another 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.930
 one side of this brand but until today 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.270
 VW bug or a bullock standing right knob the 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.640
 also when a car stops moving. 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.609
 be old and happens to be an old car 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.189
 It's a good question, is it in Brazil, the car? 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:08.250
 considered classic old time car 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.420
 which has more than 30 years of production 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.530
 have car with more than 30 years by 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.530
 example is not necessarily a 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.640
 classic captured the chevette cuiabÃ¡ 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.560
 but you can have a chevette and a 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.570
 classic chevette today on various models 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.610
 I had a classic so I guess what 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.619
 it happens here some cars they will get 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.439
 making classics over time 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:28.080
 that old saying goes, not just 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.880
 collection live the man but the whole 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.810
 adrenaline that your powerful 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.810
 to provide 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.829
 why did you start competing with a car? 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:43.310
 old face I had the dream of having a 

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:45.350
 replica of the racing dkv and it was 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.179
 famous in the 60's run in sÃ£o paulo to 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.740
 Maggie's team had like in Brazil 

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:50.810
 whole the czech team the whites 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:54.890
 black number and then I made a 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:56.469
 replica and made a preliminary parade 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.429
 the brazilian grand prize spoke to her 

00:01:56.469 --> 00:02:01.579
 looking like several cars of the two 

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:04.789
 racing and inaction championship exists until 

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:06.530
 today and I dkv stopped running I already changed 

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:07.700
 by car but he was a great pioneer 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.360
 of this championship of old cars that 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:13.280
 sees today acts more adrenaline was to run 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.829
 in an old car or see that a car 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.120
 old still runs in the car 

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:18.799
 ancient as incredible as it may seem 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.750
 people think that old car running 

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:23.379
 is car is driving car old car 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.379
 slow is not 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:37.770
 It's more expensive to buy a car today. 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:39.930
 old one liter of gas almost 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:42.150
 tying the time that the old car 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:45.090
 so the team has no table 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:47.520
 then the type car is worth what the 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.590
 face that wants to buy have to spend of 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.600
 an old commercial of the fusca began 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:54.300
 I remember what happened in the 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:59.430
 college days it is or not seeing the 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:03:02.340
 phenomenon is not common sense which of all 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.870
 your 36 cars you do not sell yourself 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.990
 I was selling see I never go 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.430
 to sell none is totally hypothetical is 

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:10.950
 because if we say so, we'll just want 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:13.350
 children and can leave the car hurt but 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.910
 I have a special car I only saw the 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:16.380
 my job is a cart that 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.330
 it fell in the eastern zone that the car 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:20.970
 especially if you went through Uruguay with this 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:23.340
 committee has already come to make horse type 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:27.230
 of dick trip of crazy things of estate 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.230
 with a view to helping to do this does not 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:34.350
 but life is so some fell in love 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:36.900
 by the other novices by susana vieira 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:40.170
 some fell in love with other eyes 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:42.870
 by Remix but you what is the thing 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:45.290
