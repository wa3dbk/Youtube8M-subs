at a spider no not that kind of spider
the<00:00:15.170> atom<00:00:15.590> is<00:00:15.709> spider<00:00:15.949> which<00:00:16.190> is<00:00:16.309> actually<00:00:16.730> a

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:16.760 
the atom is spider which is actually a

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.120 
the atom is spider which is actually a
color<00:00:17.090> calibration<00:00:17.360> tool<00:00:17.990> used<00:00:18.380> for<00:00:18.500> the<00:00:18.770> atom

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:19.130 
color calibration tool used for the atom

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:21.310 
color calibration tool used for the atom
of<00:00:19.250> samurai<00:00:19.610> blade<00:00:19.880> or<00:00:20.360> the<00:00:20.449> atom<00:00:20.750> is<00:00:20.840> Shogun

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:21.320

in this video I'll be using it

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:24.460 
in this video I'll be using it
specifically<00:00:23.420> with<00:00:23.570> the<00:00:23.690> Shogun<00:00:24.110> as<00:00:24.260> that's

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:24.470 
specifically with the Shogun as that's

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:26.230 
specifically with the Shogun as that's
the<00:00:24.620> only<00:00:24.860> one<00:00:24.980> that<00:00:25.160> I<00:00:25.190> have<00:00:25.490> but<00:00:26.000> what<00:00:26.120> it

the only one that I have but what it
does<00:00:26.420> is<00:00:26.630> it<00:00:26.750> keeps<00:00:26.900> your<00:00:27.080> display<00:00:27.440> at<00:00:27.830> the

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:28.010 
does is it keeps your display at the

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:29.920 
does is it keeps your display at the
most<00:00:28.190> accurate<00:00:28.400> color<00:00:28.940> gamut<00:00:29.210> possible

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:29.930

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:20.869 
the device itself so the construction of

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:22.389 
the device itself so the construction of
the<00:01:20.990> Animus<00:01:21.350> fighter<00:01:21.590> really<00:01:21.829> isn't<00:01:22.100> that

00:01:22.389 --> 00:01:22.399 
the Animus fighter really isn't that

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:24.219 
the Animus fighter really isn't that
cheap<00:01:22.670> it's<00:01:22.880> actually<00:01:23.179> built<00:01:23.389> quite<00:01:23.630> solid<00:01:24.109> on

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229 
cheap it's actually built quite solid on

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:25.749 
cheap it's actually built quite solid on
the<00:01:24.319> front<00:01:24.590> you're<00:01:24.740> gonna<00:01:24.859> find<00:01:25.189> some<00:01:25.520> matte

00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:25.759 
the front you're gonna find some matte

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:27.459 
the front you're gonna find some matte
plastic<00:01:26.270> with<00:01:26.389> the<00:01:26.479> Animus<00:01:26.929> branding<00:01:27.319> right

there on the front and then you have a

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.459 
there on the front and then you have a
light<00:01:29.149> right<00:01:29.359> above<00:01:29.569> that<00:01:29.810> and<00:01:30.049> I<00:01:30.109> could<00:01:30.350> not

00:01:30.459 --> 00:01:30.469 
light right above that and I could not

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:31.929 
light right above that and I could not
for<00:01:30.619> the<00:01:30.679> life<00:01:30.770> of<00:01:31.130> me<00:01:31.249> get<00:01:31.369> too<00:01:31.490> light<00:01:31.670> to<00:01:31.789> work

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:31.939 
for the life of me get too light to work

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:33.129 
for the life of me get too light to work
I'm<00:01:32.149> not<00:01:32.179> sure<00:01:32.420> if<00:01:32.539> I<00:01:32.600> was<00:01:32.719> doing<00:01:32.929> something

I'm not sure if I was doing something

00:01:33.139 --> 00:01:34.989 
I'm not sure if I was doing something
wrong<00:01:33.409> or<00:01:33.859> if<00:01:34.009> the<00:01:34.100> light<00:01:34.249> only<00:01:34.399> comes<00:01:34.700> on<00:01:34.849> when

00:01:34.989 --> 00:01:34.999 
wrong or if the light only comes on when

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.919 
wrong or if the light only comes on when
you<00:01:35.090> do<00:01:35.240> something<00:01:35.569> wrong

00:01:37.059 --> 00:01:37.069 
but if you take a look at the website

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:38.679 
but if you take a look at the website
you<00:01:37.099> can<00:01:37.310> see<00:01:37.490> that<00:01:37.639> the<00:01:37.729> light<00:01:37.909> does<00:01:38.270> turn<00:01:38.539> on

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:38.689 
you can see that the light does turn on

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:40.179 
you can see that the light does turn on
I<00:01:38.719> just<00:01:39.020> could<00:01:39.229> not<00:01:39.349> for<00:01:39.649> the<00:01:39.679> life<00:01:39.740> of<00:01:39.979> me<00:01:40.099> get

00:01:41.739 --> 00:01:41.749 
it to work on this side you're gonna

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:43.690 
it to work on this side you're gonna
find<00:01:41.990> some<00:01:42.229> glossy<00:01:42.439> plastic<00:01:42.799> and<00:01:43.399> you<00:01:43.459> can<00:01:43.579> see

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
find some glossy plastic and you can see

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.309 
find some glossy plastic and you can see
a<00:01:43.729> few<00:01:43.939> scuffs<00:01:44.270> there<00:01:44.479> as<00:01:44.599> this<00:01:44.749> is<00:01:44.929> a<00:01:44.959> used

00:01:45.309 --> 00:01:45.319 
a few scuffs there as this is a used

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:47.260 
a few scuffs there as this is a used
item<00:01:45.439> like<00:01:45.770> I<00:01:45.859> previously<00:01:46.130> said<00:01:46.520> but<00:01:47.090> the

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
item like I previously said but the

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.419 
item like I previously said but the
glossy<00:01:47.779> plastic<00:01:47.929> is<00:01:48.289> very<00:01:48.709> susceptible<00:01:49.130> to

00:01:49.419 --> 00:01:49.429 
glossy plastic is very susceptible to

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:51.609 
glossy plastic is very susceptible to
fingerprints<00:01:49.999> so<00:01:50.119> keep<00:01:50.359> that<00:01:50.539> in<00:01:50.659> mind<00:01:50.899> so<00:01:51.499> the

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:51.619 
fingerprints so keep that in mind so the

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:53.169 
fingerprints so keep that in mind so the
spider<00:01:51.859> consists<00:01:52.279> of<00:01:52.399> three<00:01:52.669> feet<00:01:52.880> on<00:01:52.999> the

spider consists of three feet on the
bottom<00:01:53.450> of<00:01:53.509> those<00:01:53.630> feet<00:01:53.929> or<00:01:54.109> pieces<00:01:54.380> of<00:01:54.649> foam

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:54.829 
bottom of those feet or pieces of foam

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:56.260 
bottom of those feet or pieces of foam
and<00:01:55.039> that's<00:01:55.219> to<00:01:55.340> prevent<00:01:55.579> scratching<00:01:56.149> when

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
and that's to prevent scratching when

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.029 
and that's to prevent scratching when

setting this on your display or monitor

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:59.919 
setting this on your display or monitor
you<00:01:58.399> also<00:01:58.579> have<00:01:58.849> a<00:01:58.880> circular<00:01:59.419> piece<00:01:59.599> of<00:01:59.630> foam

00:01:59.919 --> 00:01:59.929 
you also have a circular piece of foam

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:01.480 
you also have a circular piece of foam
which<00:02:00.079> I<00:02:00.200> will<00:02:00.380> cover<00:02:00.619> in<00:02:00.740> just<00:02:01.159> a<00:02:01.249> little<00:02:01.279> bit

blade<00:02:20.720> the<00:02:20.900> steps<00:02:21.170> may<00:02:21.350> be<00:02:21.410> a<00:02:21.500> little<00:02:21.680> bit

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
blade the steps may be a little bit

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.230 
blade the steps may be a little bit
different<00:02:22.280> depending<00:02:22.400> on<00:02:22.670> which<00:02:22.850> one<00:02:23.090> you're
