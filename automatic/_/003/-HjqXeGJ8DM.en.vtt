00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.359
 Good morning, folks today, I'll talk about the 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.250
 change of the yen electrodes to pain 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:14.190
 worse brand 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:17.609
 this equipment here ok and it's a moment 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.949
 very good very easy to handle 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:23.130
 Let's say let's say setup for 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:27.470
 treatment in the pool and easily 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:32.910
 this flag it was installed in 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:35.670
 2010 and August and it really is the electrodes 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.219
 basically lasted three years in a life 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.120
 last very interesting for this 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.460
 equipment 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.290
 I think it's going to vary a lot 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.629
 indicate the person workshop you 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.489
 piscineiro because you have to leave 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.730
 entity the ideal 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:54.390
 if you leave the city won the copper is 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.949
 The biggest logical ho spend of readers is 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.870
 the earliest 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:04.170
 then I would be dismantling this guilt 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:06.180
 here I'll be putting the 8 in the new is from 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:10.140
 continuity in the exchange of electrodes 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:14.490
 the worst brand to have to drive is worse 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:18.360
 Look how the cell was in the middle already 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:20.970
 all been spent already has some in 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:24.330
 even more here from over 12 16 and 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.490
 10 months since there would realize why 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.920
 a book in copper city was 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.860
 decreased because dealing with service that 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:36.659
 in the panel then it indicates that it has 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:40.159
 everyone's cause but it's still a 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:43.049
 honor that lasts a long time 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:45.030
 as I think Brazilians have 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.640
 to set up cute little part of 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.159
 intensity of the equipment so as to 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:53.040
 if you do not wear early 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:58.619
 this is all new here 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:02:01.490
 the difference is glaring right what is 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.490
 the pool water 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:08.299
 now this new 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.470
 if you 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.459
 had even bought these 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.129
 the electrodes may contact the 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:24.000
 people and calling this one from here to you 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:30.170
 no problem, I'll show you soon 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:33.510
 her panel functioning as ok but up 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:37.170
 Montana in the continuity al in 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:40.950
 installation of electrodes and has now been 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:42.870
 was established for the operation of the 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.849
 equipment can see that formerly 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.890
 here they did not stay and the 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:49.319
 flashing was with service because each 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:53.280
 one means all were all spent 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:58.640
 electrode was exchanged with the 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:03:00.930
 new rock and has now been reinstated in 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.959
 How does this pool work? 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:09.079
 people I make an attention on it makes a 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:09.079
 time as well as cleaning the pool 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:14.579
 do equipment maintenance 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.560
 right then this moment here is the 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:19.650
 pilot currency is a very practical event 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:22.169
 very easy to handle is difficult to give 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.849
 problem was born I've already lived something 

00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:26.669
 Look, it's a very difficult problem. 

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:28.310
 Wow, I never remembered the truth and 

00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:31.730
 other brands is 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:33.560
 really it is one of the problems is that it is 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.489
 pilot is a well- reputed brand in the 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:39.200
 Marketplace 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:41.959
 So I either trust this one or 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.400
 also indicates if you 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:45.620
 want to buy this equipment has 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.959
 our website our online store and is 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:52.040
 arrangement of events to ask questions 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:54.410
 it is as if an installation there was at your 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:04:00.250
 there you have to respond to 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:04:05.569
 These questions are not good for us today. 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:06.769
 this was today to this maintenance of the 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:09.680
 equipment 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:12.650
 this is no doubt contact me there 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:16.729
 with our environment that is there on the 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:19.299
 You there and that's it, there's people even more 

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:19.299
 and hugs
