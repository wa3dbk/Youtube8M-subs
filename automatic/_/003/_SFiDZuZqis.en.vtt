00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
for example this machine here which is

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.240 
for example this machine here which is
called<00:00:42.090> an<00:00:42.210> extruder<00:00:42.570> it's<00:00:43.350> quite<00:00:43.649> commonly

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
called an extruder it's quite commonly

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.090 
called an extruder it's quite commonly
used<00:00:44.489> to<00:00:44.760> make<00:00:44.879> products<00:00:45.450> such<00:00:45.989> as<00:00:46.170> this<00:00:46.379> so

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
used to make products such as this so

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.220 
used to make products such as this so
what<00:00:47.280> we<00:00:47.430> started<00:00:47.850> with<00:00:48.030> was<00:00:48.090> cornmeal<00:00:48.930> or

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
what we started with was cornmeal or

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.529 
what we started with was cornmeal or
corn<00:00:49.559> flour<00:00:49.620> which<00:00:50.610> was<00:00:50.820> put<00:00:51.030> in<00:00:51.239> the<00:00:51.360> backend

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
corn flour which was put in the backend

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.450 
corn flour which was put in the backend
of<00:00:51.840> this<00:00:51.960> machine<00:00:52.320> and<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:53.160> Machine

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
of this machine and the Machine

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.459 
of this machine and the Machine
processed<00:00:54.030> it<00:00:54.210> processed<00:00:54.750> it<00:00:54.870> in<00:00:55.050> a<00:00:55.140> matter<00:00:55.320> of

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
processed it processed it in a matter of

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.250 
processed it processed it in a matter of
one<00:00:55.980> minute<00:00:56.309> or<00:00:56.489> two<00:00:56.520> minutes<00:00:56.670> in<00:00:57.629> doing<00:00:57.989> so<00:00:58.140> it

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
one minute or two minutes in doing so it

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.319 
one minute or two minutes in doing so it
also<00:00:58.440> cooked<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:58.980> product<00:00:59.340> and<00:00:59.520> it<00:00:59.879> came<00:01:00.120> out

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
also cooked the product and it came out

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.930 
also cooked the product and it came out
of<00:01:00.359> this<00:01:00.660> small<00:01:00.960> dye<00:01:01.890> as<00:01:02.219> it<00:01:02.340> is<00:01:02.489> called<00:01:02.760> which

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
of this small dye as it is called which

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.549 
of this small dye as it is called which
has<00:01:03.059> a<00:01:03.090> tiny<00:01:03.329> hole<00:01:03.690> which<00:01:03.960> is<00:01:03.989> about<00:01:04.290> three

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
has a tiny hole which is about three

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.050 
has a tiny hole which is about three
millimeters<00:01:04.739> but<00:01:05.280> when<00:01:05.430> it<00:01:05.519> came<00:01:05.700> out<00:01:05.880> it

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
millimeters but when it came out it

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.899 
millimeters but when it came out it
expanded<00:01:06.750> into<00:01:07.380> this<00:01:07.500> giant<00:01:08.220> piece<00:01:08.580> which<00:01:08.880> is

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
expanded into this giant piece which is

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.270 
expanded into this giant piece which is
about<00:01:09.180> ten<00:01:09.659> millimeters<00:01:10.140> in<00:01:10.290> diameter<00:01:10.470> and<00:01:10.770> it

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
about ten millimeters in diameter and it

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.859 
about ten millimeters in diameter and it
was<00:01:11.460> cut<00:01:11.700> into<00:01:11.939> pieces<00:01:12.119> to<00:01:12.390> get<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:12.659> shape

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
was cut into pieces to get the shape

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.539 
was cut into pieces to get the shape
that<00:01:12.900> you<00:01:13.229> see<00:01:13.439> here<00:01:13.680> they<00:01:13.830> look<00:01:14.010> like<00:01:14.130> Cheetos

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
that you see here they look like Cheetos

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.380 
that you see here they look like Cheetos
or<00:01:14.610> corn<00:01:15.240> curls<00:01:15.540> so<00:01:16.350> how<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.189> material<00:01:17.939> was

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
or corn curls so how the material was

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.690 
or corn curls so how the material was
processed<00:01:18.930> in<00:01:19.080> this<00:01:19.259> machine<00:01:19.500> what<00:01:20.490> the

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
processed in this machine what the

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.030 
processed in this machine what the
Machine<00:01:21.000> did<00:01:21.240> to<00:01:21.450> it<00:01:21.600> and<00:01:21.780> what<00:01:22.409> we<00:01:22.560> can<00:01:22.740> change

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
Machine did to it and what we can change

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.310 
Machine did to it and what we can change
to<00:01:23.310> improve<00:01:23.460> and<00:01:24.000> maintain<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.720> quality<00:01:25.140> is

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
to improve and maintain the quality is

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.130 
to improve and maintain the quality is
what<00:01:25.590> poor<00:01:26.369> manufacturing<00:01:27.030> is<00:01:27.150> all<00:01:27.299> about<00:01:27.600> now

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
what poor manufacturing is all about now

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.899 
what poor manufacturing is all about now
let's<00:01:28.350> talk<00:01:28.560> about<00:01:28.619> what's<00:01:29.280> involved<00:01:29.549> in<00:01:29.759> food

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
let's talk about what's involved in food

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.749 
let's talk about what's involved in food
processing<00:01:30.479> so<00:01:31.409> in<00:01:31.650> food<00:01:31.920> processing<00:01:32.430> we'll

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
processing so in food processing we'll

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.850 
processing so in food processing we'll
primarily<00:01:33.299> talk<00:01:33.659> about<00:01:33.960> processes<00:01:34.650> and

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
primarily talk about processes and

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.859 
primarily talk about processes and
technologies<00:01:35.490> that<00:01:35.670> are<00:01:35.880> used<00:01:36.180> to<00:01:36.450> preserve

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
technologies that are used to preserve

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.950 
technologies that are used to preserve
food<00:01:37.200> by<00:01:37.920> that<00:01:38.100> I<00:01:38.310> mean<00:01:38.700> killing<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.600> harmful

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
food by that I mean killing the harmful

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.260 
food by that I mean killing the harmful
bacteria<00:01:40.110> and<00:01:40.680> food<00:01:40.920> so<00:01:41.490> they<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.939> food<00:01:42.119> is

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
bacteria and food so they the food is

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.960 
bacteria and food so they the food is
safer<00:01:42.570> to<00:01:42.600> consume<00:01:43.310> traditionally<00:01:44.310> heat<00:01:44.759> has

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
safer to consume traditionally heat has

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.450 
safer to consume traditionally heat has
been<00:01:45.000> used<00:01:45.420> to<00:01:45.780> do<00:01:45.990> this<00:01:46.200> what<00:01:46.860> he<00:01:47.070> does<00:01:47.310> is

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
been used to do this what he does is

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.160 
been used to do this what he does is
kill<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:47.850> bacteria<00:01:48.299> in<00:01:48.450> products<00:01:48.899> such<00:01:48.990> as

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
kill the bacteria in products such as

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.310 
kill the bacteria in products such as
this<00:01:50.009> a<00:01:50.340> canned<00:01:50.670> product<00:01:51.119> or<00:01:51.240> products<00:01:52.200> such
