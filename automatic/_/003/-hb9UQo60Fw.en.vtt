00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:08.330
 and on this sample we will look at you 

00:00:05.979 --> 00:00:12.950
 features knitting stripes 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:15.950
 on gum 2 by 2 3 by 3 of big ideas 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:18.650
 or with more loops when 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:21.650
 knitting stripes on gum arises 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:24.680
 such a problem in seamy areas 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:27.949
 smooths appear such touches after 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:31.100
 tying the thread of a new color and i 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:34.300
 I'll show you how to knit elastic strips. 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:37.160
 to avoid such strokes 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:40.989
 let's say we tied a strip of yellow 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:44.630
 colors and should switch to blue 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:54.890
 take the blue thread first 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:59.120
 knit the edge loop and then the whole 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:03.500
 a series of knit facial and facial loops 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:10.209
 gum and purl loops gum so 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:10.209
 we knit all the loops in the row 

00:01:13.209 --> 00:01:19.819
 the next row from the wrong side we 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.599
 already knit by drawing our gum like 

00:01:19.819 --> 00:01:24.679
 we knit 

00:01:20.599 --> 00:01:31.749
 before this in our case it is 3 purl 

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:31.749
 and 3 facial 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.079
 3 purl 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:51.820
 and 3 facial and then we continue to knit 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:54.500
 strip on the right number of rows and 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:57.079
 after we knit right 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:00.200
 number of rows thread blue 

00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:03.350
 take the thread of a new color for example here 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.819
 yellow and knit strip similarly 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:09.679
 starting from a number 

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:12.440
 facial loops here we tied two 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:13.310
 stripes and see that they turned out 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.040
 even 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:20.420
 there is no color transition together 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:23.630
 strokes and found a whole series imperceptible and 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:26.500
 you can see it if you just pull 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.500
 knitting 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:36.519
 but I want to draw your attention that 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:40.340
 gum at the same time ceases to be 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:44.140
 bilateral and from seamy she 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.140
 looks like this
