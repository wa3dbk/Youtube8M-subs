bit about this product this is something

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.250 
bit about this product this is something
that<00:02:40.640> I<00:02:40.970> actually<00:02:41.480> used<00:02:42.760> competing<00:02:43.760> this<00:02:43.910> past

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
that I actually used competing this past

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.949 
that I actually used competing this past
competition<00:02:45.260> season<00:02:45.799> I<00:02:46.329> did<00:02:47.329> come<00:02:47.599> from<00:02:47.930> a

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
competition season I did come from a

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:50.740 
competition season I did come from a
history<00:02:48.290> of<00:02:48.670> competition<00:02:49.670> training<00:02:50.239> with<00:02:50.480> no

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
history of competition training with no

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.960 
history of competition training with no
fat<00:02:51.079> in<00:02:51.230> my<00:02:51.380> diet<00:02:51.410> so<00:02:52.310> it<00:02:52.459> was<00:02:52.610> nice<00:02:52.910> to

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
fat in my diet so it was nice to

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:56.350 
fat in my diet so it was nice to
actually<00:02:54.040> incorporate<00:02:55.040> some<00:02:55.489> fat<00:02:55.790> in<00:02:55.819> my<00:02:56.120> diet

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
actually incorporate some fat in my diet

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.870 
actually incorporate some fat in my diet
this<00:02:56.510> time<00:02:57.130> definitely<00:02:58.130> helps<00:02:58.610> with<00:02:58.730> your

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
this time definitely helps with your

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.640 
this time definitely helps with your
energy<00:02:59.380> in<00:03:00.380> my<00:03:00.950> source<00:03:01.220> with<00:03:01.400> MCT<00:03:02.000> oil<00:03:02.030> um<00:03:02.900> for

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
energy in my source with MCT oil um for

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
energy in my source with MCT oil um for
those<00:03:03.739> of<00:03:03.920> you<00:03:04.010> that<00:03:04.099> don't<00:03:04.280> know<00:03:04.459> much<00:03:04.640> about

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
those of you that don't know much about

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:07.479 
those of you that don't know much about
MCT<00:03:05.599> oil<00:03:05.629> is<00:03:06.079> a<00:03:06.140> little<00:03:06.799> bit<00:03:06.950> different<00:03:07.340> than

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:07.489 
MCT oil is a little bit different than

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:10.979 
MCT oil is a little bit different than
say<00:03:07.670> consuming<00:03:08.299> peanut<00:03:08.900> butter<00:03:09.049> avocado<00:03:09.440> um

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:10.989 
say consuming peanut butter avocado um

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:14.800 
say consuming peanut butter avocado um
or<00:03:11.989> other<00:03:12.650> animal<00:03:13.160> fats<00:03:13.459> this<00:03:14.120> is<00:03:14.299> a<00:03:14.329> medium

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
or other animal fats this is a medium

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.110 
or other animal fats this is a medium
chain<00:03:15.200> fatty<00:03:15.440> acid<00:03:16.220> so<00:03:16.459> there's<00:03:16.670> different

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
chain fatty acid so there's different

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.330 
chain fatty acid so there's different
types<00:03:17.359> of<00:03:17.630> fats<00:03:17.900> and<00:03:18.230> when<00:03:18.680> I<00:03:18.709> say<00:03:18.980> that<00:03:19.160> that's

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
types of fats and when I say that that's

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.099 
types of fats and when I say that that's
the<00:03:19.519> chemical<00:03:19.730> structure<00:03:20.510> of<00:03:20.690> it

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:21.109 
the chemical structure of it

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:24.509 
the chemical structure of it
so<00:03:21.620> this<00:03:21.769> is<00:03:21.920> a<00:03:21.950> medium<00:03:22.370> chain<00:03:22.670> fatty<00:03:22.700> acid

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:24.519 
so this is a medium chain fatty acid

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:27.160 
so this is a medium chain fatty acid
compared<00:03:25.519> to<00:03:25.790> say<00:03:26.120> olive<00:03:26.600> oil<00:03:26.780> which<00:03:27.019> is<00:03:27.049> a

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
compared to say olive oil which is a

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.229 
compared to say olive oil which is a
long-chain<00:03:27.739> fatty<00:03:28.069> acid<00:03:28.549> so<00:03:28.760> what<00:03:28.910> that<00:03:29.030> means

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:29.239 
long-chain fatty acid so what that means

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:31.720 
long-chain fatty acid so what that means
is<00:03:29.359> there's<00:03:29.569> not<00:03:29.720> as<00:03:29.930> many<00:03:30.139> carbon<00:03:30.730> molecules

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
is there's not as many carbon molecules

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.420 
is there's not as many carbon molecules
in<00:03:32.120> this<00:03:32.480> chemical<00:03:33.019> structure<00:03:33.560> so<00:03:34.220> when<00:03:34.370> you

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
in this chemical structure so when you

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.580 
in this chemical structure so when you
actually<00:03:34.579> take<00:03:35.030> it<00:03:35.180> in<00:03:35.329> your<00:03:35.480> diet<00:03:35.840> you<00:03:36.470> don't

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
actually take it in your diet you don't

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:38.440 
actually take it in your diet you don't
have<00:03:36.769> to<00:03:36.889> break<00:03:37.130> it<00:03:37.310> down<00:03:37.340> into<00:03:37.849> single<00:03:38.060> fatty

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.450 
have to break it down into single fatty

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:40.690 
have to break it down into single fatty
acids<00:03:38.989> whereas<00:03:39.680> your<00:03:39.829> body<00:03:40.010> has<00:03:40.250> to<00:03:40.400> do<00:03:40.549> that

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
acids whereas your body has to do that

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:42.640 
acids whereas your body has to do that
if<00:03:40.849> you<00:03:40.970> have<00:03:41.180> any<00:03:41.480> other<00:03:41.690> type<00:03:41.930> of<00:03:41.959> fat<00:03:42.290> coming

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
if you have any other type of fat coming

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:44.890 
if you have any other type of fat coming
in<00:03:42.739> your<00:03:42.889> diet<00:03:43.190> this<00:03:43.639> is<00:03:43.700> actually<00:03:44.239> rapidly

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
in your diet this is actually rapidly

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.080 
in your diet this is actually rapidly
absorbed<00:03:45.500> into<00:03:45.650> your<00:03:45.799> body<00:03:46.040> and<00:03:46.430> you<00:03:46.489> don't

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
absorbed into your body and you don't

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:48.699 
absorbed into your body and you don't
have<00:03:47.239> to<00:03:47.389> use<00:03:47.510> the<00:03:47.660> same<00:03:47.870> type<00:03:48.200> of<00:03:48.230> fat

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:48.709 
have to use the same type of fat

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:51.849 
have to use the same type of fat
digestive<00:03:49.750> system<00:03:50.750> that<00:03:51.049> you<00:03:51.169> would<00:03:51.290> use<00:03:51.560> for

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:51.859 
digestive system that you would use for

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:54.370 
digestive system that you would use for
eating<00:03:52.040> other<00:03:52.310> foods<00:03:52.700> with<00:03:52.940> fat<00:03:53.380> it's

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:54.380 
eating other foods with fat it's

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:57.220 
eating other foods with fat it's
actually<00:03:54.709> very<00:03:54.889> rapidly<00:03:55.609> absorbed<00:03:56.359> your<00:03:57.049> body

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
actually very rapidly absorbed your body

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:59.080 
actually very rapidly absorbed your body
doesn't<00:03:57.530> even<00:03:57.680> have<00:03:57.859> to<00:03:58.040> secrete<00:03:58.370> bile<00:03:58.760> to

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.090 
doesn't even have to secrete bile to

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:02.319 
doesn't even have to secrete bile to
help<00:03:59.269> absorb<00:03:59.660> it<00:04:00.849> goes<00:04:01.849> right<00:04:02.060> into<00:04:02.209> your

help absorb it goes right into your
portal<00:04:02.780> vein<00:04:02.959> for<00:04:03.260> your<00:04:03.349> bloodstream<00:04:03.560> so<00:04:04.160> this

portal vein for your bloodstream so this

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:08.020 
portal vein for your bloodstream so this
is<00:04:04.910> something<00:04:05.150> that<00:04:05.919> you<00:04:06.919> burn<00:04:07.609> it<00:04:07.819> more

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
is something that you burn it more

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:10.960 
is something that you burn it more
quickly<00:04:08.269> for<00:04:08.660> energy<00:04:09.459> where<00:04:10.459> when<00:04:10.669> we<00:04:10.760> talk

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:10.970 
quickly for energy where when we talk

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:12.789 
quickly for energy where when we talk
about<00:04:11.000> fat<00:04:11.510> you<00:04:11.690> usually<00:04:11.840> hear<00:04:12.230> of<00:04:12.410> all<00:04:12.620> the

00:04:12.789 --> 00:04:12.799 
about fat you usually hear of all the

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:14.229 
about fat you usually hear of all the
second<00:04:13.099> you<00:04:13.190> eat<00:04:13.310> fat<00:04:13.549> it's<00:04:13.790> just<00:04:14.000> stored<00:04:14.209> in

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:14.239 
second you eat fat it's just stored in

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:16.470 
second you eat fat it's just stored in
your<00:04:14.359> fat<00:04:14.540> cells<00:04:14.870> well<00:04:15.620> this<00:04:15.769> is<00:04:15.919> a<00:04:15.949> type<00:04:16.220> of

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:16.480 
your fat cells well this is a type of

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:18.930 
your fat cells well this is a type of
product<00:04:16.780> that<00:04:16.930> it's<00:04:17.110> actually<00:04:17.590> you<00:04:18.130> it's<00:04:18.430> more

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
product that it's actually you it's more

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:20.820 
product that it's actually you it's more
readily<00:04:19.120> used<00:04:19.600> for<00:04:19.900> energy<00:04:20.050> and<00:04:20.470> it's<00:04:20.620> not

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:20.830 
readily used for energy and it's not

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:23.700 
readily used for energy and it's not
stored<00:04:21.190> as<00:04:21.340> fat<00:04:21.370> as<00:04:21.910> quickly<00:04:22.240> so<00:04:23.200> this<00:04:23.560> is

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:23.710 
stored as fat as quickly so this is

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:26.250 
stored as fat as quickly so this is
actually<00:04:24.100> great<00:04:24.370> for<00:04:24.400> competitors<00:04:25.270> great<00:04:26.050> for

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:26.260 
actually great for competitors great for

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.560 
actually great for competitors great for
anyone<00:04:26.560> trying<00:04:26.800> to<00:04:26.950> lose<00:04:27.130> weight<00:04:27.420> and<00:04:28.420> is

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:28.570 
anyone trying to lose weight and is

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:30.420 
anyone trying to lose weight and is
nervous<00:04:28.960> about<00:04:29.080> what<00:04:29.410> types<00:04:29.650> of<00:04:29.830> fats<00:04:30.070> they're

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:30.430 
nervous about what types of fats they're

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:34.920 
nervous about what types of fats they're
eating<00:04:32.220> MCT<00:04:33.220> oil<00:04:33.250> is<00:04:33.640> also<00:04:33.970> similar<00:04:34.360> to<00:04:34.390> things

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:34.930 
eating MCT oil is also similar to things

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:37.020 
eating MCT oil is also similar to things
like<00:04:35.200> coconut<00:04:35.470> oil<00:04:35.860> a<00:04:36.310> lot<00:04:36.550> of<00:04:36.670> people<00:04:36.940> are

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.030 
like coconut oil a lot of people are

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:38.730 
like coconut oil a lot of people are
using<00:04:37.210> coconut<00:04:37.510> right<00:04:37.930> now<00:04:38.080> I<00:04:38.110> hear<00:04:38.500> a<00:04:38.530> lot<00:04:38.680> of

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:38.740 
using coconut right now I hear a lot of

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:41.280 
using coconut right now I hear a lot of
people<00:04:39.100> are<00:04:39.250> huge<00:04:39.610> in<00:04:39.820> their<00:04:39.940> paleo<00:04:40.420> diets<00:04:40.960> um

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:41.290 
people are huge in their paleo diets um

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:44.550 
people are huge in their paleo diets um
I<00:04:42.160> don't<00:04:42.580> really<00:04:42.790> like<00:04:43.060> to<00:04:43.270> label<00:04:43.510> my<00:04:43.900> diet<00:04:44.140> but

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 
I don't really like to label my diet but

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.560 
I don't really like to label my diet but
kudos<00:04:45.130> to<00:04:45.310> people<00:04:45.550> doing<00:04:45.700> paleo<00:04:46.150> but<00:04:46.420> that's

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:46.570 
kudos to people doing paleo but that's

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:49.020 
kudos to people doing paleo but that's
huge<00:04:46.840> right<00:04:46.900> now<00:04:47.080> coconut<00:04:47.740> oil<00:04:47.950> um<00:04:48.220> and

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.030 
huge right now coconut oil um and

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:50.490 
huge right now coconut oil um and
there's<00:04:49.210> actually<00:04:49.540> a<00:04:49.570> lot<00:04:49.720> of<00:04:49.840> benefits<00:04:50.320> to

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:50.500 
there's actually a lot of benefits to

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.790 
there's actually a lot of benefits to
coconut<00:04:51.040> oil<00:04:51.250> um<00:04:52.180> wow<00:04:52.810> that<00:04:53.110> actually<00:04:53.410> not

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:53.800 
coconut oil um wow that actually not

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.470 
coconut oil um wow that actually not
even<00:04:53.950> that<00:04:54.160> long<00:04:54.370> ago<00:04:54.430> when<00:04:54.880> I<00:04:54.910> was<00:04:55.120> in<00:04:55.270> school

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:55.480 
even that long ago when I was in school

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:58.530 
even that long ago when I was in school
you<00:04:56.410> know<00:04:56.560> it<00:04:56.590> was<00:04:56.950> recommended<00:04:57.250> to<00:04:57.550> stay<00:04:58.300> away

00:04:58.530 --> 00:04:58.540 
you know it was recommended to stay away

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:00.930 
you know it was recommended to stay away
from<00:04:58.750> a<00:04:58.810> lot<00:04:58.960> of<00:04:58.990> saturated<00:04:59.710> fats<00:05:00.010> which<00:05:00.610> still

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:00.940 
from a lot of saturated fats which still

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:02.400 
from a lot of saturated fats which still
you<00:05:01.120> want<00:05:01.300> to<00:05:01.420> watch<00:05:01.570> what<00:05:01.840> kinds<00:05:02.140> of<00:05:02.200> fats

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:02.410 
you want to watch what kinds of fats

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:04.830 
you want to watch what kinds of fats
you're<00:05:02.650> having<00:05:02.920> in<00:05:03.010> your<00:05:03.160> diet<00:05:03.430> um<00:05:03.790> there's<00:05:04.780> a

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:04.840 
you're having in your diet um there's a

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:06.030 
you're having in your diet um there's a
lot<00:05:04.990> of<00:05:05.080> new<00:05:05.230> research<00:05:05.590> right<00:05:05.860> now

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:06.040 
lot of new research right now

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:07.860 
lot of new research right now
specifically<00:05:06.670> with<00:05:06.910> coconut<00:05:07.390> oil<00:05:07.600> which<00:05:07.840> is

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:07.870 
specifically with coconut oil which is

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:10.160 
specifically with coconut oil which is
fairly<00:05:08.380> high<00:05:08.560> in<00:05:08.590> saturated<00:05:08.920> fat

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:10.170 
fairly high in saturated fat

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:12.660 
fairly high in saturated fat
but<00:05:11.170> there's<00:05:11.380> more<00:05:11.560> benefits<00:05:12.070> to<00:05:12.310> it<00:05:12.490> than

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:12.670 
but there's more benefits to it than

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:15.270 
but there's more benefits to it than
what<00:05:12.820> we<00:05:13.180> were<00:05:13.390> once<00:05:13.630> told<00:05:14.050> as<00:05:14.290> dietitians<00:05:15.040> you

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:15.280 
what we were once told as dietitians you

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:17.220 
what we were once told as dietitians you
know<00:05:15.370> there's<00:05:15.580> new<00:05:15.790> science<00:05:16.180> emerging<00:05:16.660> it

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:17.230 
know there's new science emerging it

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:20.220 
know there's new science emerging it
actually<00:05:17.680> shows<00:05:18.070> that<00:05:18.690> highest<00:05:19.690> saturated

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:20.230 
actually shows that highest saturated

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:23.550 
actually shows that highest saturated
fat<00:05:20.470> in<00:05:20.650> takes<00:05:20.890> are<00:05:21.250> no<00:05:22.090> longer<00:05:22.420> linked<00:05:23.410> to

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:23.560 
fat in takes are no longer linked to

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:26.130 
fat in takes are no longer linked to
cardiovascular<00:05:24.280> disease<00:05:24.760> which<00:05:25.090> to<00:05:25.960> me<00:05:26.050> is

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:26.140 
cardiovascular disease which to me is

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:28.200 
cardiovascular disease which to me is
crazy<00:05:26.380> because<00:05:26.680> that's<00:05:26.980> exactly<00:05:27.670> opposite<00:05:28.120> of

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:28.210 
crazy because that's exactly opposite of

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:29.730 
crazy because that's exactly opposite of
what<00:05:28.270> I<00:05:28.420> learned<00:05:28.690> in<00:05:28.840> college<00:05:29.200> you<00:05:29.380> know<00:05:29.410> it

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:29.740 
what I learned in college you know it

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:32.070 
what I learned in college you know it
was<00:05:29.890> if<00:05:30.220> you<00:05:30.700> had<00:05:30.880> too<00:05:31.030> much<00:05:31.180> saturated<00:05:31.420> fat<00:05:31.990> in

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:32.080 
was if you had too much saturated fat in

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:34.350 
was if you had too much saturated fat in
your<00:05:32.110> diet<00:05:32.200> risk<00:05:33.160> of<00:05:33.340> heart<00:05:33.730> disease<00:05:33.790> and

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:34.360 
your diet risk of heart disease and

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:36.350 
your diet risk of heart disease and
cardiovascular<00:05:35.020> disease<00:05:35.470> were<00:05:35.620> very<00:05:35.830> high

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:36.360 
cardiovascular disease were very high

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:38.880 
cardiovascular disease were very high
now<00:05:37.360> there's<00:05:37.600> a<00:05:37.660> lot<00:05:37.810> of<00:05:37.930> research<00:05:38.260> supporting

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:38.890 
now there's a lot of research supporting

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:41.580 
now there's a lot of research supporting
that<00:05:39.520> that's<00:05:39.880> not<00:05:40.030> actually<00:05:40.240> the<00:05:40.570> case

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:41.590 
that that's not actually the case

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:43.650 
that that's not actually the case
higher<00:05:41.980> saturated<00:05:42.730> fat<00:05:42.940> intake<00:05:43.120> don't

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:43.660 
higher saturated fat intake don't

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:46.800 
higher saturated fat intake don't
necessarily<00:05:44.670> land<00:05:45.670> you<00:05:45.880> with<00:05:46.060> cardiovascular

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:46.810 
necessarily land you with cardiovascular

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:48.480 
necessarily land you with cardiovascular
disease<00:05:47.140> and<00:05:47.410> heart<00:05:47.680> attacks<00:05:48.010> and<00:05:48.280> things

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:48.490 
disease and heart attacks and things

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:51.840 
disease and heart attacks and things
like<00:05:48.700> that<00:05:50.100> so<00:05:51.100> it's<00:05:51.250> not<00:05:51.310> to<00:05:51.520> say<00:05:51.640> you<00:05:51.730> don't

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:51.850 
like that so it's not to say you don't

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:17.950 
oil so that medium chain fatty acid

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:19.860 
oil so that medium chain fatty acid
compared<00:06:18.340> to<00:06:18.430> the<00:06:18.520> long-chain<00:06:18.970> fatty<00:06:19.330> acids

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:19.870 
compared to the long-chain fatty acids

and those that use coconut oil actually
lost<00:06:22.540> more<00:06:22.840> weight<00:06:22.870> than<00:06:23.170> the<00:06:23.290> olive<00:06:23.560> oil
