I've never I've never noticed a loss of

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.429 
I've never I've never noticed a loss of
power<00:00:17.850> it's<00:00:18.480> got<00:00:18.779> plenty<00:00:18.960> of<00:00:19.109> power<00:00:21.410> but<00:00:22.410> I

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
power it's got plenty of power but I

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:23.779 
power it's got plenty of power but I
can't<00:00:22.710> say<00:00:22.859> much<00:00:23.039> because<00:00:23.220> I've<00:00:23.400> never<00:00:23.519> win

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.650 
can't say much because I've never win
them<00:00:24.590> 944

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.779 

what<00:00:28.170> if<00:00:28.260> she's<00:00:28.440> got<00:00:28.470> this<00:00:28.800> strange<00:00:29.190> clicking

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
what if she's got this strange clicking

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.020 
what if she's got this strange clicking
noise<00:00:30.000> I<00:00:30.890> got<00:00:31.890> the<00:00:32.040> bounce<00:00:32.189> check<00:00:32.610> they're<00:00:32.880> all

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
noise I got the bounce check they're all

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.390 
noise I got the bounce check they're all
inspect<00:00:34.280> those<00:00:35.280> are<00:00:35.460> good<00:00:35.550> to<00:00:35.640> go<00:00:35.790> but

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:37.400 
inspect those are good to go but

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:41.770 
inspect those are good to go but
mechanic<00:00:38.400> seems<00:00:38.640> to<00:00:38.790> think<00:00:38.970> it's<00:00:39.210> the

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:41.780 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.010 

it's<00:00:42.530> here

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:45.020 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.690 

something<00:00:45.770> to<00:00:45.830> do<00:00:45.980> with<00:00:46.100> the<00:00:46.220> exhaust

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:48.700 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.910 

but<00:00:49.300> it<00:00:49.390> looks<00:00:49.570> like<00:00:49.690> it's<00:00:49.990> coming<00:00:50.140> from<00:00:50.830> right

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:50.920 
but it looks like it's coming from right

00:00:50.920 --> 00:01:18.240 
but it looks like it's coming from right
here<00:00:52.320> right<00:00:53.320> up<00:00:53.440> in<00:00:53.590> this<00:00:53.680> area

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.250 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.540 

and<00:01:18.760> in<00:01:18.910> a<00:01:19.590> it<00:01:20.590> actually<00:01:20.950> starts<00:01:21.250> clicking

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:21.550 
and in a it actually starts clicking

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:25.290 
and in a it actually starts clicking
faster<00:01:22.110> as<00:01:23.110> I<00:01:23.320> read<00:01:23.530> it<00:01:23.740> I<00:01:24.060> don't<00:01:25.060> know<00:01:25.180> if<00:01:25.240> you

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:25.300 
faster as I read it I don't know if you

00:01:25.300 --> 00:02:11.180 
faster as I read it I don't know if you
can<00:01:25.450> hear<00:01:25.600> it<00:01:25.690> on<00:01:25.750> camera

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:16.860 

so<00:02:12.930> you're<00:02:13.930> making<00:02:14.050> that<00:02:14.320> noise<00:02:14.500> ever<00:02:15.600> since<00:02:16.600> I

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
so you're making that noise ever since I

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:23.060 
so you're making that noise ever since I
got<00:02:17.050> it<00:02:18.000> and<00:02:19.000> I<00:02:19.860> don't<00:02:20.860> know<00:02:21.040> what<00:02:21.190> it<00:02:21.280> is

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
got it and I don't know what it is

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:30.870 
got it and I don't know what it is
so<00:02:24.070> any<00:02:24.370> hope<00:02:24.730> could<00:02:25.350> help<00:02:29.459> it's<00:02:30.459> pretty<00:02:30.670> loud

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
so any hope could help it's pretty loud

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:31.470 
so any hope could help it's pretty loud
actually

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
actually

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:36.330 
actually
and<00:02:33.870> without<00:02:34.870> the<00:02:35.140> fairings<00:02:35.560> on<00:02:35.709> I<00:02:35.740> haven't

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
and without the fairings on I haven't

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:37.860 
and without the fairings on I haven't
tested<00:02:36.459> it<00:02:36.670> with<00:02:36.760> that<00:02:36.940> with<00:02:37.209> the<00:02:37.330> fangs<00:02:37.510> on

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
tested it with that with the fangs on

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.170 
tested it with that with the fangs on
but<00:02:38.230> I'm<00:02:38.320> pretty<00:02:38.560> sure<00:02:38.740> you<00:02:38.890> can<00:02:39.070> in<00:02:39.910> here

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
but I'm pretty sure you can in here

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.420 
but I'm pretty sure you can in here
while<00:02:40.420> you're<00:02:40.540> driving<00:02:41.050> under<00:02:41.739> like<00:02:41.950> probably

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
while you're driving under like probably

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.750 
while you're driving under like probably
going<00:02:42.700> like<00:02:42.850> 30<00:02:43.090> or<00:02:43.239> 40<00:02:43.860> well<00:02:44.860> no<00:02:45.160> I<00:02:45.400> took<00:02:45.670> the

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
going like 30 or 40 well no I took the

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.729 
going like 30 or 40 well no I took the
back<00:02:45.940> probably<00:02:46.270> like<00:02:46.510> 20<00:02:46.840> or<00:02:46.959> 30<00:02:47.170> you<00:02:47.350> can<00:02:47.410> hear

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:47.739 
back probably like 20 or 30 you can hear

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:52.050 
back probably like 20 or 30 you can hear
it<00:02:47.830> and<00:02:48.550> it<00:02:48.910> goes<00:02:49.480> faster<00:02:50.080> the<00:02:51.070> faster<00:02:51.550> you<00:02:51.880> go

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
it and it goes faster the faster you go

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.620 
it and it goes faster the faster you go
or<00:02:52.300> the<00:02:52.420> higher<00:02:52.630> you<00:02:52.810> rev<00:02:52.989> it<00:02:53.820> and<00:02:54.820> then<00:02:55.480> it

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
or the higher you rev it and then it

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.180 
or the higher you rev it and then it
slows<00:02:55.870> back<00:02:56.110> down<00:02:56.350> north<00:02:56.680> and<00:02:56.950> you<00:02:57.010> know<00:02:57.160> I

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
slows back down north and you know I

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:58.890 
slows back down north and you know I
don't<00:02:57.580> know<00:02:57.700> that<00:02:57.910> could<00:02:58.060> be<00:02:58.090> just<00:02:58.420> their<00:02:58.600> bike

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
don't know that could be just their bike

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.410 
don't know that could be just their bike
itself<00:02:59.459> making<00:03:00.459> the<00:03:00.550> noise<00:03:00.760> but<00:03:00.970> the<00:03:01.090> clicking

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
itself making the noise but the clicking

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:08.340 
itself making the noise but the clicking
noise<00:03:01.450> is<00:03:01.840> definitely<00:03:02.380> not<00:03:04.440> good<00:03:06.239> so<00:03:07.290> let<00:03:08.290> me

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350 
noise is definitely not good so let me

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:10.470 
noise is definitely not good so let me
know
