quick tutorial for you guys so it looks
like<00:00:08.790> with<00:00:09.059> the<00:00:09.179> new<00:00:09.389> 1.7<00:00:10.380> point<00:00:10.590> to<00:00:10.769> update<00:00:11.219> it

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
like with the new 1.7 point to update it

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:12.650 
like with the new 1.7 point to update it
was<00:00:11.490> a<00:00:11.519> bit<00:00:11.670> of<00:00:11.759> a<00:00:11.849> glitch<00:00:12.090> involving

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
was a bit of a glitch involving

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.440 
was a bit of a glitch involving
flowerpots<00:00:13.610> so<00:00:14.610> we<00:00:14.730> all<00:00:14.820> know<00:00:14.849> normally<00:00:15.269> can

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
flowerpots so we all know normally can

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.650 
flowerpots so we all know normally can
stick<00:00:15.660> quite<00:00:16.500> a<00:00:16.529> few<00:00:16.619> different<00:00:17.539> types<00:00:18.539> of

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
stick quite a few different types of

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.660 
stick quite a few different types of
flowers<00:00:18.900> and<00:00:19.289> cacti<00:00:19.680> into<00:00:19.920> these<00:00:20.039> pots<00:00:20.340> and

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
flowers and cacti into these pots and

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.490 
flowers and cacti into these pots and
when<00:00:21.480> you<00:00:21.570> break<00:00:21.750> them<00:00:21.990> you<00:00:22.020> just<00:00:22.140> get<00:00:22.410> the

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
when you break them you just get the

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.990 
when you break them you just get the
same<00:00:22.710> amount<00:00:22.740> back<00:00:23.160> as<00:00:23.400> you<00:00:23.490> originally<00:00:23.640> put

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
same amount back as you originally put

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.599 
same amount back as you originally put
in<00:00:24.500> it<00:00:25.500> turns<00:00:25.769> out<00:00:25.980> though<00:00:26.220> with<00:00:26.369> the<00:00:26.400> new

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
in it turns out though with the new

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.980 
in it turns out though with the new
updates<00:00:27.060> you<00:00:27.720> can<00:00:27.750> put<00:00:28.550> any<00:00:29.550> type<00:00:29.760> of<00:00:29.869> item<00:00:30.869> you

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
updates you can put any type of item you

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.350 
updates you can put any type of item you
can<00:00:31.109> put<00:00:31.289> in<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.439> flower<00:00:31.650> pots<00:00:31.980> you<00:00:32.940> can<00:00:33.120> place

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
can put in the flower pots you can place

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.709 
can put in the flower pots you can place
them<00:00:33.570> in<00:00:33.800> we<00:00:34.800> used<00:00:35.040> to<00:00:35.190> use<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.579> choose<00:00:36.570> to

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
them in we used to use the choose to

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.090 
them in we used to use the choose to
break<00:00:36.870> them<00:00:37.050> to<00:00:37.140> be<00:00:37.200> a<00:00:37.230> different<00:00:37.620> source<00:00:37.860> for

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
break them to be a different source for

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.330 
break them to be a different source for
example<00:00:38.579> if<00:00:38.670> you<00:00:39.800> break<00:00:40.800> out<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.129> block

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
example if you break out the block

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.160 
example if you break out the block
underneath<00:00:41.670> it<00:00:42.360> will<00:00:42.510> give<00:00:42.629> you<00:00:42.719> two<00:00:42.870> items

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
underneath it will give you two items

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.979 
underneath it will give you two items
backs<00:00:43.350> about<00:00:43.590> 31<00:00:44.040> my<00:00:44.190> inventory<00:00:46.250> 33<00:00:47.660> so<00:00:48.660> as<00:00:48.899> you

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
backs about 31 my inventory 33 so as you

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.240 
backs about 31 my inventory 33 so as you
guys<00:00:49.170> can<00:00:49.379> see<00:00:49.440> if<00:00:49.710> you<00:00:49.829> break<00:00:50.039> it<00:00:50.190> with

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
guys can see if you break it with

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.799 
guys can see if you break it with
anything<00:00:50.489> apart<00:00:50.910> from<00:00:50.940> your<00:00:51.180> first<00:00:51.420> so<00:00:51.690> I'll

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
anything apart from your first so I'll

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.360 
anything apart from your first so I'll
just<00:00:51.840> break<00:00:52.110> it<00:00:52.320> with<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.710> block<00:00:52.920> so<00:00:53.129> we<00:00:53.219> can

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
just break it with the block so we can

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.639 
just break it with the block so we can
break<00:00:53.520> it<00:00:53.550> with<00:00:53.760> water<00:00:53.969> as<00:00:54.239> well<00:00:54.420> it<00:00:54.899> will<00:00:55.469> give

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
break it with water as well it will give

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:56.869 
break it with water as well it will give
you<00:00:55.739> back<00:00:55.920> to<00:00:56.129> of<00:00:56.280> whatever<00:00:56.579> is<00:00:56.699> in<00:00:56.789> the

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
you back to of whatever is in the

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.630 
you back to of whatever is in the
flowerpot<00:00:57.440> so<00:00:58.440> it's<00:00:58.559> going<00:00:58.649> pretty<00:00:58.949> easy<00:00:59.309> way

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
flowerpot so it's going pretty easy way

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.299 
flowerpot so it's going pretty easy way
of<00:00:59.670> getting<00:01:00.180> a<00:01:00.210> lot<00:01:00.750> of<00:01:00.780> saplings<00:01:01.379> and<00:01:01.859> cactuar

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
of getting a lot of saplings and cactuar

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.310 
of getting a lot of saplings and cactuar
anything<00:01:02.640> like<00:01:02.730> that<00:01:02.899> works<00:01:03.899> with<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.170> new

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
anything like that works with the new

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.280 
anything like that works with the new
saplings<00:01:04.559> as<00:01:05.010> well<00:01:05.750> so<00:01:06.750> yeah<00:01:06.960> it's<00:01:07.080> pretty

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
saplings as well so yeah it's pretty

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.710 
saplings as well so yeah it's pretty
simple<00:01:07.619> works<00:01:08.369> with<00:01:08.549> pistons<00:01:09.000> even<00:01:09.450> up<00:01:09.570> to

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
simple works with pistons even up to

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.530 
simple works with pistons even up to
tested<00:01:10.080> that<00:01:10.200> out<00:01:10.409> and<00:01:10.909> so<00:01:11.909> we've<00:01:12.030> got<00:01:12.270> to<00:01:12.390> do

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
tested that out and so we've got to do

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.710 
tested that out and so we've got to do
is<00:01:12.720> just<00:01:12.960> place<00:01:13.710> down<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.130> items<00:01:14.600> and<00:01:15.600> the

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
is just place down the items and the

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.480 
is just place down the items and the
flower<00:01:15.930> pots<00:01:16.259> and<00:01:16.530> break<00:01:16.799> it<00:01:17.009> with<00:01:17.130> anything

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
flower pots and break it with anything

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.899 
flower pots and break it with anything
about<00:01:17.790> fear<00:01:18.030> fest<00:01:18.270> and<00:01:18.869> c<00:01:19.860> 2<00:01:19.890> t<00:01:20.130> 2<00:01:20.310> kak<00:01:20.700> day

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
about fear fest and c 2 t 2 kak day

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.870 
about fear fest and c 2 t 2 kak day
there<00:01:21.119> as<00:01:21.240> well<00:01:22.280> particularly<00:01:23.280> useful<00:01:23.640> for

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
there as well particularly useful for

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.830 
there as well particularly useful for
getting<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.630> dead<00:01:24.960> bush<00:01:25.369> sapling<00:01:26.369> things

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
getting the dead bush sapling things

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.030 
getting the dead bush sapling things
simply<00:01:27.840> because<00:01:28.110> you<00:01:28.140> can't<00:01:28.470> grow<00:01:28.680> them<00:01:28.920> with

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
simply because you can't grow them with

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.859 
simply because you can't grow them with
bone<00:01:29.250> meal<00:01:29.520> so<00:01:29.970> it's<00:01:30.150> a<00:01:30.240> really<00:01:30.420> good<00:01:30.570> way<00:01:30.840> of

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
bone meal so it's a really good way of

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.609 
bone meal so it's a really good way of
getting<00:01:31.340> quite<00:01:32.340> a<00:01:32.369> few<00:01:32.610> of<00:01:32.729> those<00:01:33.619> sorry

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
getting quite a few of those sorry

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.440 
getting quite a few of those sorry
that's<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.009> main<00:01:35.340> benefit<00:01:36.030> holder<00:01:36.299> if<00:01:36.390> you

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
that's the main benefit holder if you

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.819 
that's the main benefit holder if you
want<00:01:36.630> to<00:01:36.750> stock<00:01:36.960> up<00:01:36.990> on<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.470> new<00:01:37.590> saplings

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
want to stock up on the new saplings

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.649 
want to stock up on the new saplings
this<00:01:38.460> is<00:01:38.549> probably<00:01:38.759> a<00:01:38.880> good<00:01:38.909> method<00:01:39.150> for<00:01:39.479> it<00:01:39.570> as

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
this is probably a good method for it as

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.830 
this is probably a good method for it as
well<00:01:39.840> and<00:01:40.700> yeah<00:01:41.700> just<00:01:41.939> to<00:01:42.090> back<00:01:42.299> for<00:01:42.479> everyone

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840
