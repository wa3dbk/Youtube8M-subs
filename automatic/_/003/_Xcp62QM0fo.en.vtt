we make for better or worse really based
on<00:00:49.200> our<00:00:49.550> ideology<00:00:51.559> what<00:00:52.559> that<00:00:52.770> means

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
on our ideology what that means

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:59.330 
on our ideology what that means
is<00:00:54.870> that<00:00:55.140> what<00:00:55.649> is<00:00:55.829> good<00:00:56.280> for<00:00:56.879> somebody<00:00:58.340> is

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
is that what is good for somebody is

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:10.370 
is that what is good for somebody is
first<00:01:00.260> determined<00:01:01.260> by<00:01:02.780> how<00:01:03.780> they<00:01:04.170> perceive<00:01:04.710> it

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.660 

and<00:01:10.469> then<00:01:11.159> what<00:01:11.369> makes<00:01:11.670> it<00:01:11.880> a<00:01:12.119> serious<00:01:13.020> matter

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 
and then what makes it a serious matter

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:22.700 
and then what makes it a serious matter
is<00:01:14.780> that<00:01:15.780> how<00:01:16.530> with<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:17.039> safe<00:01:17.340> things<00:01:21.710> they

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
is that how with the safe things they

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.190 
is that how with the safe things they
say<00:01:22.979> concept<00:01:24.409> that<00:01:25.409> is<00:01:25.679> not<00:01:26.539> developed<00:01:27.539> on<00:01:27.960> our

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
say concept that is not developed on our

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:35.889 
say concept that is not developed on our
own<00:01:29.119> what<00:01:30.119> I<00:01:30.149> mean<00:01:30.509> with<00:01:30.720> that<00:01:30.750> is<00:01:31.319> based<00:01:32.310> on

00:01:35.889 --> 00:01:35.899 

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:41.770 

what<00:01:36.899> we<00:01:36.929> have<00:01:37.409> been<00:01:37.649> exposed<00:01:38.220> to<00:01:39.920> so<00:01:40.920> you<00:01:40.979> see

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 
what we have been exposed to so you see

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.969 
what we have been exposed to so you see
on<00:01:42.780> one<00:01:43.110> moment<00:01:43.939> what<00:01:44.939> you<00:01:45.240> think<00:01:45.689> oh<00:01:45.990> that<00:01:46.799> is

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
on one moment what you think oh that is

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.600 
on one moment what you think oh that is
your<00:01:47.689> knowledge<00:01:48.689> your<00:01:49.200> search<00:01:49.590> your<00:01:50.220> finds

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
your knowledge your search your finds

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.070 
your knowledge your search your finds
and<00:01:51.030> life<00:01:51.209> is<00:01:51.709> its<00:01:52.709> first<00:01:53.009> determined<00:01:53.819> by<00:01:54.599> who

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.080 
and life is its first determined by who

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.419 
and life is its first determined by who
put<00:01:55.380> it<00:01:55.560> there<00:01:55.979> for<00:01:56.280> you<00:01:56.399> to<00:01:56.729> find<00:01:57.060> it<00:01:58.369> so<00:01:59.369> you

00:01:59.419 --> 00:01:59.429 
put it there for you to find it so you

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:05.870 
put it there for you to find it so you
see<00:01:59.759> so<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.270> human<00:02:00.869> being<00:02:04.640> entering<00:02:05.640> this

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
see so the human being entering this

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:13.539 
see so the human being entering this
world<00:02:06.079> is<00:02:07.079> really<00:02:07.829> I<00:02:09.829> use<00:02:10.829> the<00:02:10.979> term

00:02:13.539 --> 00:02:13.549 

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:18.199 

disadvantaged<00:02:15.739> he<00:02:16.739> is<00:02:16.950> disadvantaged<00:02:17.880> by<00:02:18.150> the

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
disadvantaged he is disadvantaged by the

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:21.500 
disadvantaged he is disadvantaged by the
fact<00:02:18.600> that<00:02:19.069> maybe<00:02:20.069> those<00:02:20.459> who<00:02:20.940> were<00:02:21.180> there

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
fact that maybe those who were there

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:26.990 
fact that maybe those who were there
before<00:02:22.079> him<00:02:24.140> could<00:02:25.140> purposely<00:02:26.040> put<00:02:26.639> some

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
before him could purposely put some

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.830 
before him could purposely put some
things<00:02:27.389> on<00:02:27.870> take<00:02:28.560> some<00:02:28.889> things<00:02:29.160> out<00:02:29.840> depending

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
things on take some things out depending

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:36.099 
things on take some things out depending
on<00:02:31.079> how<00:02:31.470> they<00:02:31.920> want<00:02:32.220> you<00:02:32.730> to<00:02:33.180> live<00:02:33.389> your<00:02:33.420> life

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:36.109 

00:02:36.109 --> 00:02:44.140 

so<00:02:37.109> that's<00:02:37.440> why<00:02:39.350> politics<00:02:40.350> hurts<00:02:41.389> humanity

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
so that's why politics hurts humanity

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.500 
so that's why politics hurts humanity
politics<00:02:45.150> hurt<00:02:45.510> humanity<00:02:46.970> just<00:02:47.970> like<00:02:48.180> how

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
politics hurt humanity just like how

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.020 
politics hurt humanity just like how

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
them to become you start setting them up

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.750 
them to become you start setting them up
when<00:02:56.700> they<00:02:56.880> are<00:02:57.150> young<00:02:57.480> and<00:02:58.160> then<00:02:59.160> later<00:02:59.370> on
