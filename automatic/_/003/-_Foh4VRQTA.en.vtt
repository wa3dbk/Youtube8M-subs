I just want to tag along fish from the
bank<00:00:46.219> right<00:00:47.219> now<00:00:47.280> I'm<00:00:47.520> fishing<00:00:47.879> under<00:00:48.000> the

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
bank right now I'm fishing under the

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.119 
bank right now I'm fishing under the
bridge<00:00:48.450> they<00:00:48.809> got<00:00:48.930> a<00:00:48.960> lot<00:00:49.140> of<00:00:49.170> lay<00:00:49.350> downs<00:00:49.620> and<00:00:50.010> a

bridge they got a lot of lay downs and a

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.889 
bridge they got a lot of lay downs and a
lot<00:00:50.280> of<00:00:50.399> rocks<00:00:50.610> so<00:00:51.000> therefore<00:00:51.329> I<00:00:51.360> wanted<00:00:51.840> to

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
lot of rocks so therefore I wanted to

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.840 
lot of rocks so therefore I wanted to
throw<00:00:52.079> a<00:00:52.110> square<00:00:52.410> build<00:00:52.620> crank<00:00:52.860> bait<00:00:53.039> I'm

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
throw a square build crank bait I'm

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.939 
throw a square build crank bait I'm
throwing<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.420> crawl<00:00:54.930> fish<00:00:55.140> pattern<00:00:55.590> because

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
throwing the crawl fish pattern because

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.950 
throwing the crawl fish pattern because
it's<00:00:56.100> a<00:00:56.190> variety<00:00:56.550> color<00:00:56.850> and<00:00:57.090> it's<00:00:57.600> stained

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
it's a variety color and it's stained

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.139 
it's a variety color and it's stained
water<00:00:58.289> so<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:58.829> bait<00:00:59.370> will<00:00:59.520> stick<00:00:59.730> out<00:00:59.879> more

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
water so the bait will stick out more

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.790 
water so the bait will stick out more
the<00:01:00.480> bass<00:01:00.660> will<00:01:00.870> be<00:01:00.960> more<00:01:01.140> inclined<00:01:01.440> to<00:01:01.530> see<00:01:01.710> it

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
the bass will be more inclined to see it

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.740 
the bass will be more inclined to see it
and<00:01:02.010> more<00:01:02.579> inclined<00:01:02.820> to<00:01:02.850> strike<00:01:03.210> it<00:01:03.390> the

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
and more inclined to strike it the

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.329 
and more inclined to strike it the
reason<00:01:04.019> I'm<00:01:04.110> doing<00:01:04.199> a<00:01:04.320> crawfish<00:01:04.559> pattern<00:01:05.010> also

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
reason I'm doing a crawfish pattern also

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.070 
reason I'm doing a crawfish pattern also
is<00:01:05.460> because<00:01:05.700> I'm<00:01:05.820> fishing<00:01:06.000> along<00:01:06.330> a<00:01:06.689> lot<00:01:06.960> of

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
is because I'm fishing along a lot of

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.120 
is because I'm fishing along a lot of
rocks<00:01:07.350> I<00:01:08.310> like<00:01:09.000> to<00:01:09.090> fish<00:01:09.619> each<00:01:10.619> side<00:01:10.950> of<00:01:11.070> the

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
rocks I like to fish each side of the

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.160 
rocks I like to fish each side of the
pillar<00:01:11.340> I<00:01:11.549> like<00:01:11.700> to<00:01:11.790> criss<00:01:12.030> cross<00:01:12.299> different

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
pillar I like to criss cross different

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.050 
pillar I like to criss cross different
angles<00:01:13.560> I'll<00:01:13.799> throw<00:01:14.280> in<00:01:14.430> between<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.850> pillars

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
angles I'll throw in between the pillars

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.359 
angles I'll throw in between the pillars
along<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.689> pillars<00:01:16.020> I'll<00:01:16.229> throw<00:01:16.500> over<00:01:17.189> the

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
along the pillars I'll throw over the

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.539 
along the pillars I'll throw over the
branches<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:18.299> come<00:01:18.509> work<00:01:18.689> over<00:01:19.049> it<00:01:19.549> I'll

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
branches and come work over it I'll

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.280 
branches and come work over it I'll
throw<00:01:20.729> a<00:01:20.820> parallel<00:01:21.240> to<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.479> bank<00:01:21.720> I'll<00:01:22.020> also

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
throw a parallel to the bank I'll also

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.780 
throw a parallel to the bank I'll also
throw<00:01:22.409> out<00:01:22.710> to<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:22.920> deep<00:01:23.100> and<00:01:23.250> work<00:01:23.369> my<00:01:23.549> way<00:01:23.670> in

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
throw out to the deep and work my way in

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.789 
throw out to the deep and work my way in
shallow<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.900> reason<00:01:25.140> I<00:01:25.200> like<00:01:25.350> square<00:01:25.590> build

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
shallow the reason I like square build

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.070 
shallow the reason I like square build
crankbait<00:01:26.130> is<00:01:26.520> because<00:01:26.880> it<00:01:27.000> deflects<00:01:27.509> it's<00:01:28.020> a

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
crankbait is because it deflects it's a

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.330 
crankbait is because it deflects it's a
shallow<00:01:28.320> running<00:01:28.710> crankbait<00:01:29.100> and<00:01:29.280> it

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
shallow running crankbait and it

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.240 
shallow running crankbait and it
deflects<00:01:29.759> off<00:01:29.880> rocks

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
deflects off rocks

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.970 
deflects off rocks
when<00:01:31.940> I<00:01:31.970> say<00:01:32.210> to<00:01:32.270> flex<00:01:32.570> off<00:01:32.720> rocks<00:01:32.990> this<00:01:33.830> is

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:33.980 
when I say to flex off rocks this is

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:35.890 
when I say to flex off rocks this is
what<00:01:34.100> I<00:01:34.130> mean<00:01:34.400> right<00:01:34.700> here<00:01:34.880> watch<00:01:35.090> other<00:01:35.780> was

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:35.900 
what I mean right here watch other was

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.720 
what I mean right here watch other was
going<00:01:35.990> to<00:01:36.080> come<00:01:36.200> up<00:01:36.350> that<00:01:36.830> rock<00:01:37.010> boom<00:01:37.460> just

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:37.730 
going to come up that rock boom just

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:39.760 
going to come up that rock boom just
bounces<00:01:38.090> off<00:01:38.240> of<00:01:38.390> it<00:01:38.480> that<00:01:38.720> doesn't<00:01:39.650> really

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
bounces off of it that doesn't really

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.920 
bounces off of it that doesn't really
get<00:01:39.890> snagged<00:01:40.220> it'll<00:01:40.520> just<00:01:40.670> bounce<00:01:40.790> off<00:01:41.060> rocks

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:41.930 
get snagged it'll just bounce off rocks

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.710 
get snagged it'll just bounce off rocks
and<00:01:42.140> show<00:01:42.260> you<00:01:42.320> more<00:01:42.500> time<00:01:42.710> here<00:01:43.700> I've<00:01:44.480> come

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 
and show you more time here I've come

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:45.520 
and show you more time here I've come
along<00:01:44.960> rocks

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
along rocks

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.380 
along rocks
it'll<00:01:46.100> just<00:01:46.280> hit<00:01:46.580> the<00:01:46.700> rock<00:01:46.880> and<00:01:47.120> it'll<00:01:47.240> just

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
it'll just hit the rock and it'll just

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.270 
it'll just hit the rock and it'll just
bounce<00:01:47.480> off<00:01:47.750> won't<00:01:48.470> won't<00:01:48.950> really<00:01:49.160> get

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
bounce off won't won't really get

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.220 
bounce off won't won't really get
snagged<00:01:49.580> and<00:01:49.790> if<00:01:49.850> you<00:01:49.940> do<00:01:50.150> get<00:01:50.270> snagged<00:01:50.600> you

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:51.230 
snagged and if you do get snagged you

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:53.050 
snagged and if you do get snagged you
just<00:01:51.410> walk<00:01:51.590> opposite<00:01:52.340> direction<00:01:52.610> of<00:01:52.760> the<00:01:52.820> bank

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
just walk opposite direction of the bank

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:54.820 
just walk opposite direction of the bank
and<00:01:53.300> it<00:01:53.600> usually<00:01:53.930> would<00:01:54.020> come<00:01:54.230> right<00:01:54.440> off

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:54.830 
and it usually would come right off

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:57.460 
and it usually would come right off
going<00:01:55.310> into<00:01:55.400> opposite<00:01:55.820> direction<00:01:56.350> like<00:01:57.350> I

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:57.470 
going into opposite direction like I

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:58.690 
going into opposite direction like I
said<00:01:57.620> I'd<00:01:57.710> like<00:01:57.740> to<00:01:57.830> throw<00:01:58.070> a<00:01:58.100> parallel<00:01:58.460> to<00:01:58.610> the

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
said I'd like to throw a parallel to the

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.610 
said I'd like to throw a parallel to the
bank<00:01:58.940> because<00:01:59.810> it's<00:02:00.020> shallow<00:02:00.200> running

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:00.620 
bank because it's shallow running

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:02.590 
bank because it's shallow running
crankbait<00:02:01.040> and<00:02:01.760> it's<00:02:01.880> just<00:02:02.090> going<00:02:02.180> to<00:02:02.270> deflect

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
crankbait and it's just going to deflect

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.090 
crankbait and it's just going to deflect
off<00:02:02.840> these<00:02:03.080> these<00:02:03.410> rocks<00:02:03.710> and<00:02:03.920> when<00:02:04.010> it

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
off these these rocks and when it

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.469 
off these these rocks and when it
deflects<00:02:04.490> off<00:02:04.640> is<00:02:04.850> usually<00:02:05.119> when<00:02:05.240> you<00:02:05.330> get<00:02:05.420> a

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
deflects off is usually when you get a

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:07.570 
deflects off is usually when you get a
bite<00:02:05.720> or<00:02:05.900> a<00:02:05.960> strike<00:02:06.229> from<00:02:06.380> these<00:02:06.560> bass<00:02:06.770> that

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
bite or a strike from these bass that

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.230 
bite or a strike from these bass that
deflection<00:02:08.050> it'll<00:02:09.250> trigger<00:02:10.250> that<00:02:10.490> that<00:02:11.209> a

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:11.240 
deflection it'll trigger that that a

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.449 
deflection it'll trigger that that a
reaction<00:02:11.750> bike<00:02:12.080> but<00:02:12.830> as<00:02:12.920> you<00:02:13.010> saw<00:02:13.160> that<00:02:13.340> bait

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
reaction bike but as you saw that bait

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:15.610 
reaction bike but as you saw that bait
right<00:02:13.490> there<00:02:13.840> this<00:02:14.840> is<00:02:14.990> coming<00:02:15.200> from<00:02:15.230> the<00:02:15.410> deep

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
right there this is coming from the deep

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.530 
right there this is coming from the deep
I'm<00:02:16.520> gonna<00:02:16.640> show<00:02:16.730> you<00:02:16.820> on<00:02:16.910> this<00:02:16.970> big<00:02:17.180> rock<00:02:17.330> one

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
I'm gonna show you on this big rock one

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.410 
I'm gonna show you on this big rock one
more<00:02:17.660> time<00:02:18.100> as<00:02:19.100> it<00:02:19.490> comes<00:02:19.700> from<00:02:19.880> as<00:02:20.120> it's

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
more time as it comes from as it's

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:21.970 
more time as it comes from as it's
coming<00:02:20.660> it<00:02:20.840> along<00:02:21.110> it'll<00:02:21.350> just<00:02:21.560> bounce<00:02:21.740> off

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
coming it along it'll just bounce off

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.460 
coming it along it'll just bounce off
rocks<00:02:22.430> bounce<00:02:23.270> off<00:02:23.510> debris<00:02:23.840> it<00:02:24.080> doesn't

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
rocks bounce off debris it doesn't

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.199 
rocks bounce off debris it doesn't
really<00:02:24.560> get<00:02:24.740> snagged<00:02:25.040> too<00:02:25.190> much<00:02:25.370> it<00:02:26.060> just

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:26.209 
really get snagged too much it just

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:28.300 
really get snagged too much it just
bounces<00:02:26.600> off<00:02:26.780> folks<00:02:27.080> that's<00:02:27.860> what<00:02:27.980> you<00:02:28.100> want

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
bounces off folks that's what you want

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.070 
bounces off folks that's what you want
you<00:02:28.459> want<00:02:28.640> to<00:02:28.670> have<00:02:28.820> that<00:02:28.970> deflection<00:02:29.540> will

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
you want to have that deflection will

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.510 
you want to have that deflection will
cause<00:02:30.290> a<00:02:30.320> reaction<00:02:30.680> bite<00:02:31.160> from<00:02:31.280> that<00:02:31.370> fish

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.520 
cause a reaction bite from that fish

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.770 
cause a reaction bite from that fish
