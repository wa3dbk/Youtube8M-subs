we do that I want to talk about a couple

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.830 
we do that I want to talk about a couple
of<00:00:37.260> stats<00:00:37.559> okay<00:00:38.100> so<00:00:38.520> on<00:00:38.760> average<00:00:39.000> ten<00:00:39.660> people

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
of stats okay so on average ten people

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.690 
of stats okay so on average ten people
drown<00:00:40.170> every<00:00:40.770> day<00:00:40.950> in<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.340> United<00:00:41.640> States

drown every day in the United States

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.880 
drown every day in the United States
this<00:00:42.090> is<00:00:42.210> pretty<00:00:42.390> staggering<00:00:42.750> and<00:00:43.200> then<00:00:43.680> four

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
this is pretty staggering and then four

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.369 
this is pretty staggering and then four
children<00:00:44.840> drowning<00:00:45.840> is<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:45.960> leading<00:00:46.079> cause

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
children drowning is the leading cause

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.110 
children drowning is the leading cause
of<00:00:46.530> accidental<00:00:46.800> death<00:00:47.160> among<00:00:47.640> children<00:00:47.670> ages

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
of accidental death among children ages

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.630 
of accidental death among children ages
1<00:00:48.510> to<00:00:48.539> 4<00:00:49.020> so<00:00:49.320> this<00:00:49.440> is<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.770> problem<00:00:50.070> that<00:00:50.489> this

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
1 to 4 so this is the problem that this

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.639 
1 to 4 so this is the problem that this
product<00:00:50.940> is<00:00:51.270> trying<00:00:51.960> to<00:00:52.110> solve<00:00:52.289> and<00:00:52.530> that's

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
product is trying to solve and that's

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.770 
product is trying to solve and that's
their<00:00:52.860> mission<00:00:53.039> is<00:00:53.399> to<00:00:54.059> is<00:00:54.480> to<00:00:54.539> actually

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
their mission is to is to actually

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.840 
their mission is to is to actually
reduce<00:00:55.079> those<00:00:55.500> numbers<00:00:55.980> and<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.550> way<00:00:56.699> that

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
reduce those numbers and the way that

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.459 
reduce those numbers and the way that
this<00:00:57.000> works<00:00:57.180> and<00:00:57.449> I<00:00:57.510> tested<00:00:57.899> this<00:00:57.989> Adam<00:00:58.350> over

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
this works and I tested this Adam over

00:00:58.469 --> 00:00:59.959 
this works and I tested this Adam over
at<00:00:58.620> a<00:00:58.680> friend's<00:00:58.980> house<00:00:59.100> testing<00:00:59.579> this<00:00:59.699> in<00:00:59.879> her

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
at a friend's house testing this in her

pool and her son if we're going to

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.579 
pool and her son if we're going to
actually<00:01:03.539> see<00:01:03.870> if<00:01:03.930> we<00:01:03.989> can<00:01:04.080> get<00:01:04.140> this<00:01:04.260> to<00:01:04.409> play

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
actually see if we can get this to play

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.950 
actually see if we can get this to play
okay<00:01:05.159> he's<00:01:05.339> got<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.610> headband<00:01:06.030> on<00:01:06.210> and<00:01:06.630> he

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.910 
it a second then it goes off ok so it's
test<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.479> pressure<00:01:27.720> underwater<00:01:28.320> realizes

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
test the pressure underwater realizes

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:29.960 
test the pressure underwater realizes
they're<00:01:29.040> underwater<00:01:29.340> for<00:01:29.640> a<00:01:29.670> certain<00:01:29.939> amount
