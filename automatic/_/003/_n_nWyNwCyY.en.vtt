00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:07.830
 it is to him to his advances 8 today 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.290
 I 'll talk to you about new motorcycle break-in 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:22.529
 engine and all that can go 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:25.310
 whether or not to have your license 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.710
 you buy a new motorcycle brief 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:30.599
 lots of little things that make that 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:32.070
 thank you buddy you saw me full of 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.570
 little things you need that you have 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.110
 may be faced with having a life 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.809
 calm that will require a break-in for 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.160
 the break-in in bulk we are listening to you and the 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.730
 guy who opens me the bike to do it and 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:47.700
 then you apply yourself apply yourself 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.750
 to ally the the the instructions now me 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.110
 I would like to add a new 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.629
 dimension often to these guides 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.449
 of use it is the use of the 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:01.320
 handle we're going to say something here which 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.480
 serves accelerated so for well-honed the 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:08.369
 bike 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:12.060
 because rolling at levels of 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:14.430
 successive rhythms on a beach of 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.900
 well- defined diet I feel 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:20.580
 for me it's because she more 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:23.729
 optimal so already their buying this to 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.970
 what their swimming is simple 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:29.340
 a period of driving the engine 1.9 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:32.040
 where we go the used gradually for 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.710
 that they can a posteriori given his 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:39.870
 greater yield than this 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:43.470
 either in consumption performance 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:44.480
 in short, it is to optimize the future potential 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.000
 of the motor 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:49.350
 so when break-in usually we have 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.600
 several levels were said we have 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.880
 kilometers that go by step it's 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.430
 not me on the surface if I had a thousand 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.400
 or two children or your band to 4000 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.920
 afterwards it was 5000 6000 8000 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:06.870
 here I am going to show you an example 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:11.340
 a trick not do wholesale when 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:12.600
 tells you to ride at 4000 laps it's not 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:17.390
 to roll anyway up to 4000 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:20.690
 tours because if we want pretty perfect 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.690
 but that's not all 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:29.110
 good it's a little over 4000 laps but 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.230
 in the idea it is if we look 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:35.950
 past all speeds like a hog 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:39.640
 handle in the corner so basically their e 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.900
 dan it's not that the account turns it's 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.310
 also the handle 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.260
 latapie it's okay 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.660
 that we put handle of the angel but when 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.680
 after it is broken in at 6000 turns it is a 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.489
 turn when my wrists in the shadows 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.819
 does it still a little bit 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:53.620
 wrong so I'm talking about engine load so 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:56.349
 the idea is what is it that you have 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:59.849
 your wrist right you look at 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:03:03.640
 stop how far you can keep it 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:05.079
 and basically during your age the 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.720
 first part of the roll is not 

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:08.200
 far east the first 200 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.819
 kilometers 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.769
 well you only 30% of the handle in 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:14.379
 over this year we do the counting tours 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:17.730
 more than 30% of the handle like that you 

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:17.730
 use the engine gradually 

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:31.540
 and after little by little you make 50% 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:36.010
 go on then go after we made 50 % and 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:39.040
 after 60 % until the end our lady ben 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:41.740
 it's not about me one-eyed almost 6 and 6 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.970
 5 thousand five hundred terminals good after one 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:46.300
 can go normally but until the 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:48.030
 review what so that's basically this 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:51.300
 concept I wanted to give you more 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:54.130
 good when I talk to you about running in too 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:58.720
 there's not that engine to rode on a 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:04:02.530
 motorcycle and in the box the tires there are 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:03.490
 the plates is so for her for the 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:04.720
 wholesale pads when you take 

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:06.850
 you brake hard and relax in 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.470
 big and not long like that because 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:09.790
 otherwise it's going to ice and make 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:11.560
 watch out eh do not brake 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:13.530
 a long child over long periods 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:16.090
 if not the plate they go 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:17.260
 drag and after that's why you 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:19.150
 have lent small queen by the way when 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.260
 you want if that's what it is that these 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:23.830
 classes and so basically have to remove them 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:26.560
 to scrub a bit what with a paper to 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:28.300
 sand things like that for oil 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:30.940
 box for the box for the info 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:32.020
 just pass all the speeds keep 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:34.870
 well in mind that their buying a 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:38.320
 training what your motorcycle so in 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:42.810
 big these first seconds 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:46.410
 wazemmes include 2nd first 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:48.880
 so here is the motorcycle 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:50.320
 the habit of using it all his 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.540
 reports to the skin that one two three 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:53.710
 speeds where the sixth woman to 1000 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:54.330
 kilometers on the highway it serves to that 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:57.010
 slab 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:59.430
 so here we go first 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:59.430
 second third 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:06.190
 the tires just like that nothing to do 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:07.330
 zigzags on the road to what we are 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:09.370
 did some zigzags fail you put 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:12.400
 not necessarily in the EU you do not have to 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:14.920
 imagine that things either so 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:17.980
 have to wait gradually from his 

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:19.060
 board did we say for them adhere 

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:21.370
 well anyway on his band of 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:22.540
 rolling that is to say in the middle and 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:25.540
 little by little you put a little more 

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:29.890
 angle you do not take the bike after 

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:30.600
 noon you go to casey stoner a good 

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:34.300
 marc mark 

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:37.870
 you are young and binoculars in hand 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:38.950
 like crazy elsewhere to heat 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:44.700
 tires have the best way that's 

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:44.700
 accelerate brake accelerate brake 

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:55.970
 so we saw well warm up the bike 

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:56.620
 go on all diets and all 

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:59.480
 speeds 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:01.400
 so basically a donation and dallas running in 

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:03.500
 city ​​or urban railway 

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:06.170
 is better than a village road 

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:07.420
 campaign and highways especially to 

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:11.960
 prohibit the streets of highways 

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:15.560
 and 4th think about the handle is at the door 

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:19.940
 engine because it's not because we 

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:22.070
 rolls a low regime that is asked 

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:24.980
 we do not ask too much for lifeguards 

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:27.710
 then for the tires we said wait 

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:30.590
 100 kilometers to be sure to have 

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:32.510
 unique tires she went 

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:35.150
 gradually on the angle for the 

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:38.050
 pads will do long braking 

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:41.420
 better take the brake is released 

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:46.870
 to adapt his vista and his speed that 

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:46.870
 the hall and on long braking 

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:55.860
 a new bike is like a woman 9.6 

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:59.000
 in you shoot like a goret to 

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:59.000
 paws and exams ceni
