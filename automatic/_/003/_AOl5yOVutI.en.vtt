make it after we're going to go ahead

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.670

and fire it like so and you'll see it

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.529 
and fire it like so and you'll see it
working<00:01:01.890> in<00:01:02.129> just<00:01:02.309> a<00:01:02.430> sec<00:01:02.640> so<00:01:02.850> boom<00:01:03.090> it<00:01:03.300> blows

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
working in just a sec so boom it blows

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.329 
working in just a sec so boom it blows
it<00:01:03.719> up<00:01:03.799> obviously<00:01:04.799> you're<00:01:05.070> not<00:01:05.159> gonna

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
it up obviously you're not gonna

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.370 
it up obviously you're not gonna
probably<00:01:05.729> not<00:01:06.030> gonna<00:01:06.150> be<00:01:06.270> using<00:01:06.450> this<00:01:06.689> on<00:01:06.990> like

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
probably not gonna be using this on like

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.340 
probably not gonna be using this on like
a<00:01:07.490> cobblestone<00:01:08.490> non<00:01:09.299> watered<00:01:09.689> base<00:01:09.869> I<00:01:10.110> guess

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350

stuff<00:01:24.930> like<00:01:25.080> that<00:01:25.140> especially<00:01:25.560> after<00:01:26.009> my<00:01:26.220> one

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
stuff like that especially after my one

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.789 
stuff like that especially after my one
and<00:01:26.939> guide<00:01:27.150> video<00:01:27.509> then<00:01:28.080> got<00:01:28.350> in<00:01:28.470> particular

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
and guide video then got in particular

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.310 
and guide video then got in particular
learn<00:01:29.340> so<00:01:29.729> we<00:01:30.240> can<00:01:30.390> go<00:01:30.509> ahead<00:01:30.600> and<00:01:30.750> water<00:01:31.049> and

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
learn so we can go ahead and water and

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.960 
learn so we can go ahead and water and
as<00:01:31.680> you<00:01:31.860> can<00:01:32.009> see<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.400> corners<00:01:32.790> aren't

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
as you can see the corners aren't

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.700 
as you can see the corners aren't
watered<00:01:33.360> so<00:01:33.600> you<00:01:34.079> guys<00:01:34.229> don't<00:01:34.409> know<00:01:34.560> already

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
watered so you guys don't know already

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.920 
watered so you guys don't know already
you<00:01:34.920> can<00:01:35.070> scatter<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.790> corner<00:01:36.180> if<00:01:36.420> they<00:01:36.659> don't

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
you can scatter the corner if they don't

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.630 
you can scatter the corner if they don't
have<00:01:37.020> their<00:01:37.200> corners<00:01:37.500> protected<00:01:38.070> so<00:01:38.549> we're

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
have their corners protected so we're

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.340 
have their corners protected so we're
going<00:01:38.729> to<00:01:38.820> go<00:01:38.939> ahead<00:01:38.970> and<00:01:39.240> tell<00:01:39.990> just<00:01:40.170> going<00:01:40.290> to

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
going to go ahead and tell just going to

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.230 
going to go ahead and tell just going to
wait<00:01:40.470> for<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.650> water<00:01:40.890> flow<00:01:41.159> down<00:01:41.400> and<00:01:41.970> then

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
wait for the water flow down and then

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.940 
wait for the water flow down and then
we'll<00:01:42.390> go<00:01:42.509> ahead<00:01:42.630> and<00:01:42.810> fire<00:01:43.350> and<00:01:43.649> I'll<00:01:43.770> show

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
we'll go ahead and fire and I'll show

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.560 
we'll go ahead and fire and I'll show
you<00:01:43.979> guys<00:01:44.159> what<00:01:44.430> exactly<00:01:44.880> this<00:01:45.030> thing<00:01:45.240> is<00:01:45.390> for

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
you guys what exactly this thing is for

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.510 
you guys what exactly this thing is for
so<00:01:45.750> I'm<00:01:45.840> actually<00:01:45.960> going<00:01:46.140> to<00:01:46.290> take<00:01:46.470> some<00:01:47.159> ticks

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
so I'm actually going to take some ticks

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
so I'm actually going to take some ticks
off<00:01:47.729> this<00:01:48.860> like<00:01:49.860> so<00:01:50.070> there<00:01:50.430> we<00:01:50.520> go<00:01:50.549> so<00:01:51.360> it's

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
off this like so there we go so it's

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.060 
off this like so there we go so it's
going<00:01:51.630> to<00:01:51.689> wait<00:01:51.899> another<00:01:52.110> second<00:01:52.560> or<00:01:52.619> so<00:01:52.829> and

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
going to wait another second or so and

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.760 
going to wait another second or so and
let's<00:01:53.520> fire<00:01:54.049> so<00:01:55.049> it's<00:01:55.200> going<00:01:55.320> to<00:01:55.380> go<00:01:55.530> ahead<00:01:55.649> and

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
let's fire so it's going to go ahead and

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.450 
let's fire so it's going to go ahead and
file<00:01:56.070> like<00:01:56.310> so

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:57.460 
file like so

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.719 
file like so
and<00:01:57.580> about<00:01:58.150> three<00:01:58.510> two<00:01:58.780> one<00:01:59.110> and<00:01:59.409> we<00:01:59.770> are<00:01:59.950> in<00:02:00.159> so

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:00.729 
and about three two one and we are in so

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:02.070 
and about three two one and we are in so
now<00:02:00.850> we're<00:02:01.030> just<00:02:01.060> going<00:02:01.210> to<00:02:01.330> add<00:02:01.540> probably

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.080 
now we're just going to add probably

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.080 
now we're just going to add probably
just<00:02:03.040> another<00:02:03.220> shot<00:02:03.549> we<00:02:03.700> don't<00:02:03.850> really<00:02:03.940> need

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
just another shot we don't really need

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.300 
just another shot we don't really need
to<00:02:04.210> add<00:02:04.360> another<00:02:04.390> delay<00:02:04.960> once<00:02:05.500> we<00:02:05.680> get<00:02:05.800> in<00:02:05.950> it<00:02:06.130> I

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
to add another delay once we get in it I

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:07.380 
to add another delay once we get in it I
guess<00:02:06.490> we<00:02:06.640> could<00:02:06.790> add<00:02:06.880> a<00:02:06.909> little<00:02:07.119> bit<00:02:07.240> more

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
guess we could add a little bit more

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.469 
guess we could add a little bit more
delay<00:02:07.720> and<00:02:08.310> starts<00:02:09.310> growing<00:02:09.550> with<00:02:09.759> things<00:02:09.970> so

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
delay and starts growing with things so

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.750 
delay and starts growing with things so
as<00:02:10.600> you<00:02:10.750> can<00:02:10.869> see<00:02:11.140> we're<00:02:11.530> in<00:02:11.560> i<00:02:12.040> may<00:02:12.550> add<00:02:12.730> a

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
as you can see we're in i may add a

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.309 
as you can see we're in i may add a
little<00:02:12.940> bit<00:02:13.090> more<00:02:13.240> delay<00:02:13.540> so<00:02:13.600> it<00:02:13.930> will<00:02:14.110> like

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:14.319 
little bit more delay so it will like

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:16.290 
little bit more delay so it will like
fling<00:02:15.130> around<00:02:15.250> stuff<00:02:15.730> like<00:02:15.880> that<00:02:15.910> but<00:02:16.209> you

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
fling around stuff like that but you

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.360 
fling around stuff like that but you
guys<00:02:16.420> get<00:02:16.600> the<00:02:16.780> point<00:02:17.050> this<00:02:17.890> thing<00:02:18.160> is

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
guys get the point this thing is

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.600 
guys get the point this thing is
probably<00:02:19.030> the<00:02:19.300> best<00:02:19.510> you<00:02:20.230> can<00:02:20.440> probably<00:02:20.860> use<00:02:21.069> i

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
probably the best you can probably use i

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.270 
probably the best you can probably use i
guess<00:02:21.819> when<00:02:22.150> it<00:02:22.239> comes<00:02:22.450> to<00:02:22.770> corner<00:02:23.770> accounting

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
guess when it comes to corner accounting

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.430 
guess when it comes to corner accounting
say<00:02:24.790> rip<00:02:25.120> just<00:02:25.450> look<00:02:25.600> at<00:02:25.720> that<00:02:25.750> you<00:02:26.170> could<00:02:26.319> have

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
say rip just look at that you could have

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.080 
say rip just look at that you could have
gotten<00:02:26.590> pretty<00:02:27.040> much<00:02:27.160> older<00:02:27.520> loot<00:02:27.730> from<00:02:27.880> that

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
gotten pretty much older loot from that

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.180 
gotten pretty much older loot from that
but<00:02:28.720> we're<00:02:29.020> going<00:02:29.170> to<00:02:29.230> go<00:02:29.319> ahead<00:02:29.440> and<00:02:29.590> show<00:02:30.160> you

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
but we're going to go ahead and show you

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:31.770 
but we're going to go ahead and show you

going to make it for high because that's

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.050 
going to make it for high because that's
kind<00:03:04.780> of<00:03:04.930> the<00:03:05.079> standard<00:03:05.739> I<00:03:06.160> like<00:03:06.370> to<00:03:06.549> do<00:03:06.730> and

like so just have them cut them in front
like<00:03:15.100> this<00:03:15.340> and<00:03:15.670> let<00:03:16.299> me<00:03:16.390> get<00:03:16.540> some<00:03:16.720> sexy<00:03:17.290> gloss

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
like this and let me get some sexy gloss

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.140 
like this and let me get some sexy gloss
just<00:03:17.920> to<00:03:18.010> make<00:03:18.160> this<00:03:18.310> thing<00:03:18.610> look<00:03:18.670> nice

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
just to make this thing look nice

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.350 
just to make this thing look nice
actually<00:03:20.079> I<00:03:20.110> want<00:03:20.320> gray<00:03:20.829> there<00:03:21.280> we<00:03:21.370> go<00:03:21.549> so<00:03:22.150> once

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:22.360 
actually I want gray there we go so once

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:23.400 
actually I want gray there we go so once
you<00:03:22.450> have<00:03:22.510> your<00:03:22.660> dispensers<00:03:23.170> in<00:03:23.200> this

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
you have your dispensers in this

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:25.680 
you have your dispensers in this
formation<00:03:23.739> usually<00:03:24.700> want<00:03:24.880> to<00:03:24.970> go<00:03:25.120> ahead<00:03:25.239> and

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
formation usually want to go ahead and

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:27.539 
formation usually want to go ahead and
you<00:03:25.810> want<00:03:25.989> to<00:03:26.079> put<00:03:26.260> some<00:03:26.530> just<00:03:27.100> some<00:03:27.190> glass

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:27.549 
you want to put some just some glass

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:29.640 
you want to put some just some glass
here<00:03:27.910> I<00:03:27.970> doesn't<00:03:28.299> have<00:03:28.329> to<00:03:28.720> be<00:03:28.870> glass<00:03:29.230> but<00:03:29.560> it

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
here I doesn't have to be glass but it

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.130 
here I doesn't have to be glass but it
can<00:03:29.769> be<00:03:29.860> like<00:03:30.070> any<00:03:30.250> block<00:03:30.579> I'm<00:03:31.540> not<00:03:31.690> I<00:03:31.900> usually

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.140 
can be like any block I'm not I usually

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.229 
can be like any block I'm not I usually
put<00:03:32.470> slabs<00:03:32.799> like<00:03:33.070> this<00:03:33.250> as<00:03:33.489> well<00:03:33.670> I'm<00:03:33.970> not<00:03:34.180> sure

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 
put slabs like this as well I'm not sure

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:36.030 
put slabs like this as well I'm not sure
if<00:03:34.630> that<00:03:34.660> is<00:03:34.959> a<00:03:35.019> hundred<00:03:35.410> percent<00:03:35.470> needed<00:03:35.890> but

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
if that is a hundred percent needed but

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.460 
if that is a hundred percent needed but
I<00:03:36.220> just<00:03:36.640> do<00:03:36.880> it<00:03:36.910> like<00:03:37.060> that<00:03:37.239> someone<00:03:38.200> chewed<00:03:38.350> on

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
I just do it like that someone chewed on

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.470 
I just do it like that someone chewed on
that<00:03:38.650> you<00:03:38.950> want<00:03:39.130> to<00:03:39.190> go<00:03:39.310> ahead<00:03:39.459> and<00:03:39.880> you<00:03:40.209> want

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
that you want to go ahead and you want

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.960 
that you want to go ahead and you want
to<00:03:40.690> start<00:03:40.989> wiring<00:03:41.380> up<00:03:41.739> your<00:03:41.980> propulsion<00:03:42.400> say

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
to start wiring up your propulsion say

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:45.210 
to start wiring up your propulsion say
you<00:03:43.390> want<00:03:43.510> to<00:03:43.570> place<00:03:43.720> the<00:03:43.799> quartz<00:03:44.799> blocks<00:03:45.040> and

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
you want to place the quartz blocks and

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:46.440 
you want to place the quartz blocks and
whatever<00:03:45.430> the<00:03:45.519> type<00:03:45.760> of<00:03:45.820> blocks<00:03:46.150> you're<00:03:46.299> using

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
whatever the type of blocks you're using

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:48.900 
whatever the type of blocks you're using
like<00:03:46.600> so<00:03:47.019> and<00:03:47.320> you<00:03:48.010> want<00:03:48.160> to<00:03:48.220> go<00:03:48.310> ahead<00:03:48.459> and

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
like so and you want to go ahead and

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:51.120 
like so and you want to go ahead and
place<00:03:49.299> a<00:03:49.329> repeater<00:03:49.600> here<00:03:49.870> and<00:03:50.320> a<00:03:50.799> repeater

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.130 
place a repeater here and a repeater

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.340 
place a repeater here and a repeater
here<00:03:51.250> of<00:03:51.640> course<00:03:52.120> you<00:03:52.299> can<00:03:52.480> actually<00:03:52.900> use

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:53.350 
here of course you can actually use

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:55.740 
here of course you can actually use
redstone<00:03:54.040> torch<00:03:54.340> method<00:03:54.790> but<00:03:55.030> I<00:03:55.239> just<00:03:55.540> didn't

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
redstone torch method but I just didn't

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:58.440 
redstone torch method but I just didn't
make<00:03:55.840> it<00:03:55.989> like<00:03:56.140> this<00:03:56.320> so<00:03:56.459> if<00:03:57.459> you<00:03:57.609> guys<00:03:57.760> know

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:58.450 
make it like this so if you guys know

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:00.150 
make it like this so if you guys know
how<00:03:58.600> to<00:03:58.630> use<00:03:58.780> redstone<00:03:59.290> torches<00:03:59.799> and<00:03:59.980> stuff

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160 
how to use redstone torches and stuff

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.220 
how to use redstone torches and stuff
like<00:04:00.280> that<00:04:00.340> go<00:04:00.700> ahead<00:04:00.910> and<00:04:01.090> use<00:04:01.269> them<00:04:01.510> because

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.230 
like that go ahead and use them because

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:03.420 
like that go ahead and use them because
this<00:04:02.440> kind<00:04:02.590> of<00:04:02.680> all<00:04:02.829> works<00:04:03.040> pretty<00:04:03.220> much<00:04:03.340> the

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
this kind of all works pretty much the

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.759 
this kind of all works pretty much the
same<00:04:03.760> with<00:04:04.030> redstone<00:04:04.299> torches<00:04:04.780> I'll<00:04:05.410> show<00:04:05.709> you

00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:05.769 
same with redstone torches I'll show you

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:07.970 
same with redstone torches I'll show you
guys<00:04:05.949> like<00:04:06.190> another<00:04:06.430> version<00:04:06.760> after

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
guys like another version after

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:09.979 
guys like another version after
but<00:04:08.940> once<00:04:09.239> you've<00:04:09.390> done<00:04:09.480> that<00:04:09.540> you<00:04:09.810> want<00:04:09.959> to

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
but once you've done that you want to

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:12.199 
but once you've done that you want to
just<00:04:10.170> keep<00:04:10.620> hooking<00:04:10.890> all<00:04:11.159> this<00:04:11.310> up<00:04:11.519> doesn't

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 
just keep hooking all this up doesn't

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:13.880 
just keep hooking all this up doesn't
really<00:04:12.299> matter<00:04:12.450> how<00:04:12.780> it's<00:04:12.989> hooked<00:04:13.080> up<00:04:13.349> then<00:04:13.769> go

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:13.890 
really matter how it's hooked up then go

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:16.280 
really matter how it's hooked up then go
ahead<00:04:13.980> put<00:04:14.250> a<00:04:14.280> button<00:04:14.519> there<00:04:14.849> and<00:04:15.180> that<00:04:16.019> is<00:04:16.139> the

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:16.290 
ahead put a button there and that is the

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:17.509 
ahead put a button there and that is the
propulsion<00:04:16.709> so<00:04:17.070> once<00:04:17.220> you've<00:04:17.340> done<00:04:17.430> the

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 
propulsion so once you've done the

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:19.189 
propulsion so once you've done the
propulsion<00:04:17.880> you<00:04:18.389> want<00:04:18.540> to<00:04:18.600> kind<00:04:18.690> of<00:04:18.810> go<00:04:18.930> ahead

00:04:19.189 --> 00:04:19.199 
propulsion you want to kind of go ahead

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:22.640 
propulsion you want to kind of go ahead
make<00:04:19.829> your<00:04:19.859> way<00:04:20.190> and<00:04:20.959> did<00:04:21.959> not<00:04:22.169> mean<00:04:22.350> to<00:04:22.500> break

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
make your way and did not mean to break

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.230 
make your way and did not mean to break
that<00:04:22.949> I<00:04:23.190> was<00:04:23.490> leave<00:04:23.699> it's<00:04:23.880> not<00:04:24.060> really

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
that I was leave it's not really

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.939 
that I was leave it's not really
affecting<00:04:24.600> anything<00:04:24.810> you<00:04:25.500> want<00:04:25.650> to<00:04:25.710> make<00:04:25.830> your

00:04:25.939 --> 00:04:25.949 
affecting anything you want to make your

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:27.469 
affecting anything you want to make your
way<00:04:26.100> kind<00:04:26.400> of<00:04:26.490> kind<00:04:27.000> of<00:04:27.150> like<00:04:27.300> a<00:04:27.330> little

00:04:27.469 --> 00:04:27.479 
way kind of kind of like a little

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:29.240 
way kind of kind of like a little
staircase<00:04:27.840> just<00:04:28.110> to<00:04:28.500> go<00:04:28.590> out<00:04:28.740> there<00:04:28.770> and<00:04:29.010> you

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.250 
staircase just to go out there and you

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:31.700 
staircase just to go out there and you
want<00:04:29.790> to<00:04:29.880> wrap<00:04:30.060> it<00:04:30.210> around<00:04:30.300> and<00:04:30.810> connect<00:04:31.380> it<00:04:31.500> to

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710 
want to wrap it around and connect it to

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:33.409 
want to wrap it around and connect it to
this<00:04:31.830> thing<00:04:32.070> here<00:04:32.310> so<00:04:32.490> we<00:04:33.030> want<00:04:33.210> to<00:04:33.240> go<00:04:33.389> ahead

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:33.419 
this thing here so we want to go ahead

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:35.570 
this thing here so we want to go ahead
and<00:04:33.810> place<00:04:33.960> one<00:04:34.139> repeater<00:04:34.470> to<00:04:34.830> repeater<00:04:35.190> three

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580 
and place one repeater to repeater three

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:38.270 
and place one repeater to repeater three
repeaters<00:04:36.150> and<00:04:36.270> the<00:04:36.900> comparator<00:04:37.560> you<00:04:37.919> can<00:04:38.100> add

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 
repeaters and the comparator you can add

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:39.800 
repeaters and the comparator you can add
a<00:04:38.310> little<00:04:38.520> bit<00:04:38.699> more<00:04:38.880> delay<00:04:39.210> by<00:04:39.449> just

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:39.810 
a little bit more delay by just

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:41.779 
a little bit more delay by just
extending<00:04:40.410> the<00:04:40.530> pathway<00:04:41.010> i<00:04:41.039> guess<00:04:41.310> but<00:04:41.580> this

00:04:41.779 --> 00:04:41.789 
extending the pathway i guess but this

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:44.210 
extending the pathway i guess but this
thing<00:04:42.000> doesn't<00:04:42.270> have<00:04:42.479> the<00:04:43.199> biggest<00:04:43.500> room<00:04:43.949> to

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:44.220 
thing doesn't have the biggest room to

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:45.770 
thing doesn't have the biggest room to
put<00:04:44.430> a<00:04:44.460> lot<00:04:44.729> of<00:04:44.760> repeaters<00:04:45.180> and<00:04:45.330> stuff<00:04:45.660> like

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780 
put a lot of repeaters and stuff like

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:47.990 
put a lot of repeaters and stuff like
that<00:04:45.840> so<00:04:46.020> I'm<00:04:46.410> kind<00:04:46.620> of<00:04:46.680> just<00:04:46.919> making<00:04:47.550> it<00:04:47.820> nice

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000 
that so I'm kind of just making it nice

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.420 
that so I'm kind of just making it nice
and<00:04:48.270> small<00:04:48.510> and<00:04:48.720> compact<00:04:48.840> for<00:04:49.320> now<00:04:49.470> and<00:04:49.680> if<00:04:50.310> you

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430 
and small and compact for now and if you

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:51.980 
and small and compact for now and if you
call<00:04:50.610> it<00:04:50.760> coming<00:04:51.000> you<00:04:51.180> shouldn't<00:04:51.510> need<00:04:51.660> more

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:51.990 
call it coming you shouldn't need more

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:55.040 
call it coming you shouldn't need more
than<00:04:52.139> 34<00:04:52.590> repeaters<00:04:53.160> it<00:04:54.060> usually<00:04:54.900> not

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.050 
than 34 repeaters it usually not

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:57.439 
than 34 repeaters it usually not
shooting<00:04:55.410> in<00:04:55.500> exactly<00:04:55.919> the<00:04:56.160> most<00:04:56.449> far

00:04:57.439 --> 00:04:57.449 
shooting in exactly the most far

00:04:57.449 --> 00:04:58.790 
shooting in exactly the most far
distance<00:04:57.960> I<00:04:58.080> guess<00:04:58.260> you<00:04:58.380> could<00:04:58.530> say<00:04:58.740> so

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 
distance I guess you could say so

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.159 
distance I guess you could say so
shouldn't<00:04:59.669> be<00:04:59.729> too<00:04:59.760> much<00:04:59.970> of<00:05:00.030> a<00:05:00.180> big<00:05:00.360> deal<00:05:00.389> so

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:01.169 
shouldn't be too much of a big deal so

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:02.480 
shouldn't be too much of a big deal so
now<00:05:01.380> you<00:05:01.440> just<00:05:01.530> want<00:05:01.710> to<00:05:01.770> go<00:05:01.889> ahead<00:05:02.100> like<00:05:02.250> that

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:02.490 
now you just want to go ahead like that

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:05.930 
now you just want to go ahead like that
and<00:05:02.840> hook<00:05:03.840> this<00:05:04.020> up<00:05:04.199> to<00:05:04.260> here<00:05:04.590> and<00:05:04.800> water<00:05:05.639> and

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:05.940 
and hook this up to here and water and

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:07.670 
and hook this up to here and water and
you're<00:05:06.180> pretty<00:05:06.449> much<00:05:06.570> done<00:05:06.990> like<00:05:07.289> it<00:05:07.470> is

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:07.680 
you're pretty much done like it is

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.219 
you're pretty much done like it is
honestly<00:05:07.860> one<00:05:08.400> of<00:05:08.880> the<00:05:08.970> simplest<00:05:09.570> cannons<00:05:10.020> to

00:05:10.219 --> 00:05:10.229 
honestly one of the simplest cannons to

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:12.920 
honestly one of the simplest cannons to
make<00:05:10.380> it<00:05:10.620> is<00:05:10.740> not<00:05:10.949> a<00:05:10.979> hard<00:05:11.250> cannon<00:05:11.580> at<00:05:11.820> all<00:05:12.000> it's

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:12.930 
make it is not a hard cannon at all it's

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:15.290 
make it is not a hard cannon at all it's
really<00:05:13.500> freaking<00:05:13.979> simple<00:05:14.340> actually<00:05:14.550> so<00:05:15.000> let

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:15.300 
really freaking simple actually so let

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.409 
really freaking simple actually so let
me<00:05:15.389> just<00:05:15.570> quickly<00:05:15.720> break<00:05:16.200> that<00:05:16.440> first<00:05:16.830> and

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:17.419 
me just quickly break that first and

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:23.810 
me just quickly break that first and
there<00:05:18.419> we<00:05:18.539> go<00:05:18.720> so<00:05:19.410> just<00:05:19.680> go<00:05:19.830> dt<00:05:20.450> 20<00:05:21.919> t1000<00:05:22.919> let

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:23.820 
there we go so just go dt 20 t1000 let

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:27.560 
there we go so just go dt 20 t1000 let
me<00:05:23.910> take<00:05:24.090> some<00:05:24.120> of<00:05:24.389> this<00:05:24.450> to<00:05:24.630> lay<00:05:24.840> off<00:05:25.020> and<00:05:26.570> the

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:27.570 
me take some of this to lay off and the

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:29.629 
me take some of this to lay off and the
water<00:05:27.840> did<00:05:28.080> I<00:05:28.139> water<00:05:28.380> no<00:05:28.800> I<00:05:29.039> did<00:05:29.280> not<00:05:29.310> water
