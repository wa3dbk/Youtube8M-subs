00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:09.079 

00:02:09.079 --> 00:02:14.410 

never<00:02:10.079> awake<00:02:10.950> victory

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.800 

should<00:02:15.420> die<00:02:15.629> on<00:02:15.810> their<00:02:15.959> own<00:02:17.360> drink<00:02:18.360> one<00:02:18.510> last

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
should die on their own drink one last

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:32.630 
should die on their own drink one last
pot<00:02:21.079> one<00:02:30.110> go<00:02:31.110> three<00:02:31.590> minutes<00:02:31.769> and<00:02:31.950> 50<00:02:32.250> seconds

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
pot one go three minutes and 50 seconds

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.640 
pot one go three minutes and 50 seconds
that<00:02:32.879> is<00:02:33.090> I<00:02:33.209> think<00:02:33.420> tighter<00:02:33.959> than<00:02:34.260> a<00:02:34.349> movement

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
that is I think tighter than a movement

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.319 
that is I think tighter than a movement
