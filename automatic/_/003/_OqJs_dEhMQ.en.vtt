00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
season and you know kind of when I came

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.390 
season and you know kind of when I came
in<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.350> spring<00:01:52.560> out<00:01:52.680> still<00:01:52.890> having<00:01:53.370> that

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:53.400 
in the spring out still having that

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.670

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
shoulder and so rehab from that I think

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.290 
shoulder and so rehab from that I think
I<00:01:55.710> was<00:01:55.830> a<00:01:55.860> little<00:01:56.070> bit<00:01:56.580> out<00:01:56.730> of<00:01:56.760> shape<00:01:56.910> from

importantly<00:04:32.640> you<00:04:32.790> know<00:04:32.880> coming<00:04:33.300> from<00:04:33.330> high

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020 
importantly you know coming from high

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:35.840 
importantly you know coming from high
school<00:04:34.320> to<00:04:34.440> college<00:04:34.470> you<00:04:34.860> you<00:04:35.490> really<00:04:35.700> don't

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:35.850 
school to college you you really don't

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:37.010 
school to college you you really don't
see<00:04:36.030> that<00:04:36.150> much<00:04:36.330> in<00:04:36.479> high<00:04:36.600> school<00:04:36.750> and<00:04:36.810> you<00:04:36.900> got

see that much in high school and you got
to<00:04:37.110> focus<00:04:37.260> on<00:04:37.500> that<00:04:37.590> in<00:04:37.710> college<00:04:37.860> so<00:04:38.160> that's<00:04:38.700> a

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:38.760 
to focus on that in college so that's a

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.310 
to focus on that in college so that's a
lot<00:04:38.940> do<00:04:39.240> you<00:04:39.330> think<00:04:39.510> the<00:04:39.630> running<00:04:39.960> backs<00:04:40.140> have

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320 
lot do you think the running backs have

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:41.629 
lot do you think the running backs have
a<00:04:40.380> good<00:04:40.530> chemistry<00:04:40.650> with<00:04:40.950> the<00:04:41.160> offensive<00:04:41.490> line

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:41.639 
a good chemistry with the offensive line

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:43.280 
a good chemistry with the offensive line
and<00:04:42.060> then<00:04:42.150> knowing<00:04:42.570> what<00:04:42.780> they're<00:04:42.960> doing

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:43.290 
and then knowing what they're doing

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:45.260 
and then knowing what they're doing
especially<00:04:43.919> because<00:04:44.100> they<00:04:44.250> have<00:04:44.340> so<00:04:44.760> that<00:04:45.060> so

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.270 
especially because they have so that so

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.060 
especially because they have so that so
much<00:04:45.419> turnover<00:04:45.690> we<00:04:46.560> have<00:04:46.680> a<00:04:46.710> great<00:04:46.770> chemistry

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.070 
much turnover we have a great chemistry

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:49.520 
much turnover we have a great chemistry
and<00:04:47.400> you<00:04:48.240> know<00:04:48.360> we<00:04:48.479> put<00:04:48.840> ourselves<00:04:48.960> on<00:04:49.290> that

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:49.530 
and you know we put ourselves on that

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:51.620 
and you know we put ourselves on that
because<00:04:49.770> code<00:04:50.400> we<00:04:50.580> say<00:04:50.790> to<00:04:50.850> each<00:04:51.030> other<00:04:51.180> every

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:51.630 
because code we say to each other every

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:52.820 
because code we say to each other every
day<00:04:51.660> you<00:04:51.810> know<00:04:51.900> the<00:04:52.050> linemen<00:04:52.380> are<00:04:52.530> the<00:04:52.620> running

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:52.830 
day you know the linemen are the running
