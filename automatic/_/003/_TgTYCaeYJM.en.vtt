00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:56.710
 this facts game what is it about 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:01:01.149
 That's what friends are about. That's what 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:05.830
 activision operates is actually pure 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:08.410
 marketing thing let's say everyone like that 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:10.030
 every choir comes with the game 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:12.670
 a bit apart and the one 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:15.550
 Everyone understands the game a bit 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:17.710
 one of which plays this game and excites 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:20.590
 I'll say my friend 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.790
 electric sa manfred tricks has the 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:25.600
 biggest problems 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:29.800
 that has even existed and more for 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:31.030
 players who play along and so you 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.770
 must be honest already the 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.990
 words already understand something from the game yes 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:37.180
 the games have been call of 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.560
 Duty and around know each other and also 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.180
 elektrik the siag a bad player 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.560
 that he is my friend my favorite 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.390
 Friend is another thing 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.440
 but I already understand the game yes 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.670
 So you have to be so honest and 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:52.660
 but still experience 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:54.220
 but it's just that I mean 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:56.260
 you have to have live streams on me 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.970
 a friend turns out to be easy too 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:02.110
 I even took something from me 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:04.120
 beatrix and it is not like that 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05.620
 people are just cussing it is 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:08.530
 which means cuss 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:11.290
 they would rather know that now 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:14.250
 German pension or real means 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:20.470
 cry the crybabies 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:21.070
 the road is really destroyed so it is 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.640
 is sick 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:26.650
 it is really sick and it is easy 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:30.160
 so a little bit that every core 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:33.270
 gamer desperate so why i say it 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:36.670
 you why activision is the reason here 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:38.590
 because the minority is the core gamer 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:43.330
 yes we are a minority 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:44.580
 yes we are the ones who play that game 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.750
 buy anyway 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:50.170
 I say so maybe you 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:51.340
 10 20 percent of the core gamers so 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.560
 from the people who really play the game 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.300
 generally understood the games 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.550
 Understand the regular play 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.160
 and we are 20 percent 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:02.260
 accepted 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:05.230
 no idea currency sold ten 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:07.630
 We are then millions of the game 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.990
 how many so we are mathematics 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:13.330
 Genies here comes look come come come 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:16.030
 we are so why these two millions 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:19.720
 it now only for the sake of 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:22.600
 Activision Why should two million 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:27.370
 gamer the remaining eight million 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:28.120
 casuals that make more sales than 42 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.940
 millions 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:33.820
 why should we use these people too 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.780
 Send because they do not bock then 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.989
 more on this game 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:40.300
 yes she shit runs the game differently 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:41.950
 imagine oh shit that's all 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:44.080
 that does not work for me all 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:47.019
 I floored manage because not so 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:49.720
 That's why we build many many 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:52.390
 many many many many do 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:56.110
 shit are in the game and then 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:57.100
 These core gamers will like that 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:59.320
 all balanced 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.610
 that is, it does not matter who has played 

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:02.440
 not yet that is probably set 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:07.180
 it just just has to do with the 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:09.880
 connect what to do and who better 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:12.670
 can swim like this little dirty one 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:17.260
 It does not matter what , but it really only works 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:19.209
 It's why we should be marketing it 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.590
 customers so the customers their customers of 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:23.410
 Send activision 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:25.150
 that will not do and that's why they build 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:25.720
 We do not have this chance 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:27.790
 leaf man 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:31.450
 just like that, they do not flatten 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:33.190
 make and therefore vigorously the casual then 

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:35.350
 also the next lg because he thinks b 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:38.680
 I 've got something in the game, yes 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:42.250
 So the game is so cool and s.den 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:44.650
 twitter messages and the way of it 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:48.550
 Once upon a time it came to those 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:51.010
 Of course you can see the whole of them 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:52.900
 ignorance that you bring in the daytime is 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:56.200
 yes fierce of my friends is really 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:59.110
 fierce and it's just ridiculous 

00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:01.210
 how they relate to the community 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:03.130
 Behavior There are some standards 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:04.690
 chance and there will not be it 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:06.430
 one reacts in which place and 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:08.050
 Hey, I do not have any 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:11.260
 problems with the game why do they dance? 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:14.380
 people and then huub stevens me 

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:16.120
 know that not all are isolated 

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:17.680

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:19.150
 i just a naughty my friends 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:21.790

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:26.860
 No matter what game only bring 

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:29.680
 I gave up the game anyway 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:31.570
 probably every biggest rock will be yes 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:35.260

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:37.380

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:39.550
 Of course, the aula is listed on the frost exchanges 

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:41.590
 maybe you can because any very 

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:42.970
 big out or something in this whole 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:43.270
 team deathmatch or something we look 

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:45.430
 times 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:47.800
 In any case, I'm looking forward to gta 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:49.930

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:53.620

 even horny will not see any 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:57.520

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:59.710

 but a bit of alexis will 

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:09.400
 maybe a woman I hope 

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:11.110
