on you I'm gonna put three layers of
grip<00:03:51.239> wax<00:03:51.480> on<00:03:51.720> three<00:03:52.620> to<00:03:52.769> five<00:03:52.980> layers<00:03:53.220> is<00:03:53.549> sort

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
grip wax on three to five layers is sort

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.720 
grip wax on three to five layers is sort
of<00:03:53.820> sort<00:03:54.540> of<00:03:54.600> standard<00:03:54.720> practice<00:03:55.410> of<00:03:55.730> applying

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
of sort of standard practice of applying

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.150 
of sort of standard practice of applying
grip<00:03:56.940> wax<00:03:57.150> if<00:03:58.140> you<00:03:58.320> need<00:03:58.470> more<00:03:58.650> much<00:03:58.920> more<00:03:59.100> than

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
grip wax if you need more much more than

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.890 
grip wax if you need more much more than
five<00:03:59.489> layers<00:03:59.820> your<00:04:00.000> skis<00:04:00.239> are<00:04:00.390> probably<00:04:00.810> a

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
five layers your skis are probably a

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.720 
five layers your skis are probably a
little<00:04:01.140> bit<00:04:01.230> on<00:04:01.320> the<00:04:01.410> stiff<00:04:01.650> side<00:04:01.680> and<00:04:02.519> if<00:04:02.610> you

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
little bit on the stiff side and if you

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:04.370 
little bit on the stiff side and if you
don't<00:04:02.970> put<00:04:03.180> these<00:04:03.420> three<00:04:03.720> layers<00:04:03.930> on<00:04:04.230> me

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380 
don't put these three layers on me

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:05.979 
don't put these three layers on me
you're<00:04:04.560> probably<00:04:04.799> going<00:04:05.160> to<00:04:05.220> lose<00:04:05.489> grip

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:05.989 
you're probably going to lose grip

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:08.280 
you're probably going to lose grip
fairly<00:04:06.989> rapidly<00:04:07.440> when<00:04:07.680> your<00:04:07.799> help

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290 
fairly rapidly when your help

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:11.640 
fairly rapidly when your help
so<00:04:09.180> the<00:04:10.180> best<00:04:10.360> of<00:04:10.569> both<00:04:10.720> worlds<00:04:10.750> is<00:04:11.290> a<00:04:11.319> fast

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:11.650 
so the best of both worlds is a fast

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:13.530 
so the best of both worlds is a fast
lighting<00:04:12.129> ski<00:04:12.370> but<00:04:12.549> also<00:04:12.879> a<00:04:12.909> ski<00:04:13.209> that<00:04:13.239> gives

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
lighting ski but also a ski that gives

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:14.789 
lighting ski but also a ski that gives
you<00:04:13.629> good<00:04:13.780> prep<00:04:14.079> so<00:04:14.230> you<00:04:14.349> can<00:04:14.439> get<00:04:14.560> up<00:04:14.709> the

00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:14.799 
you good prep so you can get up the

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:17.539 
you good prep so you can get up the
hills<00:04:15.010> most<00:04:15.849> frustrating<00:04:16.479> thing<00:04:16.690> is<00:04:16.870> when<00:04:17.169> you

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
hills most frustrating thing is when you

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:19.590 
hills most frustrating thing is when you
when<00:04:18.549> you're<00:04:18.669> trying<00:04:18.850> to<00:04:18.940> get<00:04:19.090> up<00:04:19.209> a<00:04:19.329> hill<00:04:19.359> and

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:19.600 
when you're trying to get up a hill and

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:24.360 
when you're trying to get up a hill and
your<00:04:19.720> skis<00:04:19.959> are<00:04:20.109> slipping<00:04:20.440> backwards<00:04:23.370> so

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370 
your skis are slipping backwards so

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:25.850 
your skis are slipping backwards so
we're<00:04:24.610> gonna<00:04:24.699> use<00:04:24.820> a<00:04:24.940> different<00:04:24.970> cork<00:04:25.510> here

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
we're gonna use a different cork here

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:39.080 
we're gonna use a different cork here
for<00:04:26.860> this<00:04:35.729> see<00:04:36.729> that<00:04:36.910> smoothing<00:04:37.330> out<00:04:37.449> nicely

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
for this see that smoothing out nicely

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:42.510 
for this see that smoothing out nicely
now<00:04:40.500> but<00:04:41.500> often<00:04:41.800> especially<00:04:41.949> if<00:04:42.280> you're<00:04:42.370> using

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:42.520 
now but often especially if you're using

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.840 
now but often especially if you're using
a<00:04:42.699> warmer<00:04:43.030> wax<00:04:43.680> because<00:04:44.680> it's<00:04:45.010> softer<00:04:45.490> you're

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:45.850 
a warmer wax because it's softer you're

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:48.420 
a warmer wax because it's softer you're
gonna<00:04:45.970> get<00:04:46.180> these<00:04:46.360> Serta<00:04:46.949> Long's<00:04:47.949> on<00:04:48.250> there

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:48.430 
gonna get these Serta Long's on there

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:49.740 
gonna get these Serta Long's on there
once<00:04:48.580> in<00:04:48.699> a<00:04:48.729> while<00:04:48.820> you're<00:04:48.940> gonna<00:04:49.000> get<00:04:49.210> a<00:04:49.270> kind

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:49.750 
once in a while you're gonna get a kind

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:51.629 
once in a while you're gonna get a kind
of<00:04:49.780> a<00:04:49.870> chunk<00:04:50.139> of<00:04:50.229> Wax<00:04:50.440> if<00:04:50.979> you<00:04:51.100> do<00:04:51.250> that<00:04:51.400> just

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:51.639 
of a chunk of Wax if you do that just

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:54.890 
of a chunk of Wax if you do that just
take<00:04:51.789> the<00:04:51.910> edge<00:04:52.030> of<00:04:52.180> your<00:04:52.240> scraper<00:04:52.630> and<00:04:52.930> just

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:54.900 
take the edge of your scraper and just

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:59.370 
take the edge of your scraper and just
rub<00:04:55.900> that<00:04:57.060> like<00:04:58.060> so<00:04:58.360> just<00:04:58.780> to<00:04:58.900> smooth<00:04:59.169> out<00:04:59.320> that

00:04:59.370 --> 00:04:59.380 
rub that like so just to smooth out that

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:01.710 
rub that like so just to smooth out that
big<00:04:59.710> glob<00:04:59.979> and<00:05:00.729> then<00:05:00.910> you<00:05:01.000> can<00:05:01.150> go<00:05:01.270> back<00:05:01.479> to

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:01.720 
big glob and then you can go back to

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:11.250 
big glob and then you can go back to
using<00:05:01.900> the<00:05:02.160> wider<00:05:03.160> side<00:05:09.539> got<00:05:10.539> two<00:05:10.750> layers<00:05:10.930> on

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:11.260 
using the wider side got two layers on

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:12.890 
using the wider side got two layers on
there<00:05:11.440> now<00:05:11.560> we're<00:05:11.710> gonna<00:05:11.800> put<00:05:12.010> a<00:05:12.039> third<00:05:12.280> layer

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:12.900 
there now we're gonna put a third layer

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.000 
there now we're gonna put a third layer
now<00:05:13.900> you<00:05:13.960> can<00:05:14.139> see<00:05:14.320> when<00:05:14.530> you<00:05:14.620> get<00:05:14.770> to<00:05:14.889> your

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:15.010 
now you can see when you get to your

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:17.159 
now you can see when you get to your
second<00:05:15.400> or<00:05:15.520> your<00:05:15.580> third<00:05:15.699> layer<00:05:16.090> with<00:05:16.750> this<00:05:16.900> box

00:05:17.159 --> 00:05:17.169 
second or your third layer with this box

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:20.219 
second or your third layer with this box
here<00:05:17.500> let's<00:05:18.310> see<00:05:18.490> it<00:05:18.639> applies<00:05:19.599> nice<00:05:20.020> and

00:05:20.219 --> 00:05:20.229 
here let's see it applies nice and

00:05:20.229 --> 00:05:21.540 
here let's see it applies nice and
smooth<00:05:20.530> and<00:05:20.650> you're<00:05:20.800> not<00:05:20.919> getting<00:05:21.070> any<00:05:21.310> big

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:21.550 
smooth and you're not getting any big

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:23.310 
smooth and you're not getting any big
globs<00:05:21.849> and<00:05:22.300> you're<00:05:22.449> getting<00:05:22.599> full<00:05:22.930> coverage

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:23.320 
globs and you're getting full coverage

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:24.839

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:40.130 
you still got a little bit of grip wax

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:42.040 
you still got a little bit of grip wax
left<00:05:40.430> on<00:05:40.550> your<00:05:40.700> skis<00:05:40.940> now<00:05:41.660> let's<00:05:41.870> say<00:05:41.990> you

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:42.050 
left on your skis now let's say you

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:43.630 
left on your skis now let's say you
don't<00:05:42.200> ski<00:05:42.500> for<00:05:42.710> a<00:05:42.740> few<00:05:42.920> days<00:05:43.070> and<00:05:43.340> the<00:05:43.430> snow

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:43.640 
don't ski for a few days and the snow

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:47.560 
don't ski for a few days and the snow
conditions<00:05:43.910> change<00:05:44.860> if<00:05:45.860> the<00:05:46.190> snow<00:05:47.030> is<00:05:47.060> gone<00:05:47.420> to

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:47.570 
conditions change if the snow is gone to

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:49.540 
conditions change if the snow is gone to
warmer<00:05:48.020> and<00:05:48.260> you've<00:05:48.560> got<00:05:48.770> warmer<00:05:49.370> snow

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:49.550 
warmer and you've got warmer snow

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:51.670 
warmer and you've got warmer snow
conditions<00:05:50.060> you<00:05:50.180> can<00:05:50.360> put<00:05:50.540> a<00:05:50.690> warmer<00:05:51.140> wax<00:05:51.350> over

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:51.680 
conditions you can put a warmer wax over

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:53.890 
conditions you can put a warmer wax over
top<00:05:51.920> because<00:05:52.760> the<00:05:52.880> warmer<00:05:53.180> waxes<00:05:53.540> can<00:05:53.690> have<00:05:53.840> a

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:53.900 
top because the warmer waxes can have a

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:55.750 
top because the warmer waxes can have a
softer<00:05:54.260> texture<00:05:54.590> and<00:05:54.800> it'll<00:05:55.010> apply<00:05:55.190> over<00:05:55.580> top

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:55.760 
softer texture and it'll apply over top

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:59.920 
softer texture and it'll apply over top

00:05:59.920 --> 00:05:59.930 
but if you get colder conditions and you

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:01.900 
but if you get colder conditions and you
need<00:06:00.080> to<00:06:00.170> put<00:06:00.350> a<00:06:00.380> harder<00:06:00.800> grip<00:06:00.950> wax<00:06:01.190> on<00:06:01.430> it's

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:01.910

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:03.230 
going to be really hard to apply that

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:05.440 
going to be really hard to apply that
harder<00:06:03.620> grip<00:06:03.800> wax<00:06:04.040> on<00:06:04.220> there<00:06:04.430> so<00:06:05.000> the<00:06:05.300> best

of<00:06:14.360> the<00:06:14.510> analogies<00:06:15.050> is<00:06:15.290> you<00:06:15.410> can<00:06:15.560> put<00:06:15.790> jam<00:06:16.790> on

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:16.970 
of the analogies is you can put jam on

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:18.370 
of the analogies is you can put jam on
peanut<00:06:17.300> butter<00:06:17.450> but<00:06:17.630> you<00:06:17.750> can't<00:06:17.930> put<00:06:18.110> peanut

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:18.380 
peanut butter but you can't put peanut

peanut butter but you can't put peanut
butter<00:06:18.410> on<00:06:18.590> Jam<00:06:18.980> so<00:06:19.220> think<00:06:19.460> of<00:06:19.550> your<00:06:19.760> colder

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:20.420 
butter on Jam so think of your colder

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:22.090 
butter on Jam so think of your colder
wax<00:06:20.600> temperature<00:06:21.230> as<00:06:21.380> your<00:06:21.530> peanut<00:06:21.920> butter

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:22.100 
wax temperature as your peanut butter

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:24.160 
wax temperature as your peanut butter
and<00:06:22.400> your<00:06:22.760> warm<00:06:22.970> relaxed<00:06:23.240> temperature<00:06:23.900> as

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:24.170 
and your warm relaxed temperature as

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:26.290 
and your warm relaxed temperature as
your<00:06:24.380> jam<00:06:24.740> and<00:06:25.040> if<00:06:25.580> you<00:06:25.700> use<00:06:25.820> that<00:06:25.850> sort<00:06:26.240> of

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:26.300 
your jam and if you use that sort of

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:28.750 
your jam and if you use that sort of
rule<00:06:26.680> you<00:06:27.680> know<00:06:27.740> you<00:06:28.040> have<00:06:28.160> better<00:06:28.370> sort<00:06:28.700> of

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:28.760 
rule you know you have better sort of

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:34.660 
waxing success one final pass and just

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:38.440 
waxing success one final pass and just
ease<00:06:35.660> should<00:06:35.870> be<00:06:35.960> ready<00:06:36.140> to<00:06:36.320> go
