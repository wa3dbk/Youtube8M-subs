00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:33.710

everybody's<00:00:41.360> mind<00:00:41.780> I<00:00:41.989> don't<00:00:42.110> mind<00:00:42.260> it<00:00:42.559> being

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:42.710 
everybody's mind I don't mind it being

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:44.860 
everybody's mind I don't mind it being
there<00:00:42.980> but<00:00:43.220> we<00:00:44.000> just<00:00:44.150> got<00:00:44.330> to<00:00:44.420> get<00:00:44.510> better<00:00:44.629> at

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870
