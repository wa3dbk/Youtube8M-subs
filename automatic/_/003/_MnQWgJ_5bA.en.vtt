00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:18.900 
highlight where I can and that's it and
this<00:05:16.540> is<00:05:16.750> the<00:05:17.110> finished<00:05:17.410> model<00:05:17.710> it<00:05:18.580> looks<00:05:18.790> very

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:18.910 
this is the finished model it looks very

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:21.180 
this is the finished model it looks very
good<00:05:19.150> with<00:05:19.360> the<00:05:19.720> kind<00:05:20.050> of<00:05:20.230> base<00:05:20.470> that<00:05:20.740> we<00:05:20.920> used

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:21.190 
good with the kind of base that we used

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:23.970 
good with the kind of base that we used
on<00:05:21.490> the<00:05:21.670> previous<00:05:22.090> video<00:05:22.660> which<00:05:22.900> is<00:05:23.080> basing<00:05:23.770> a

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:23.980 
on the previous video which is basing a

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:26.670 
on the previous video which is basing a
treatment<00:05:24.910> ancient<00:05:25.360> and<00:05:25.570> you<00:05:26.170> can<00:05:26.320> learn<00:05:26.470> how

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:26.680 
treatment ancient and you can learn how

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:29.490 
treatment ancient and you can learn how
to<00:05:26.710> make<00:05:26.890> this<00:05:27.370> base<00:05:27.640> on<00:05:27.850> that<00:05:28.030> video<00:05:28.330> and<00:05:28.570> I

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:29.500 
to make this base on that video and I

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:31.170 
to make this base on that video and I
think<00:05:29.710> it<00:05:29.830> looks<00:05:30.010> very<00:05:30.100> good<00:05:30.250> it<00:05:30.580> doesn't

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:31.180 
think it looks very good it doesn't

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:33.990 
think it looks very good it doesn't
really<00:05:31.360> need<00:05:31.600> any<00:05:31.870> more<00:05:32.050> work<00:05:32.470> really<00:05:33.100> to<00:05:33.670> get

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:34.000 
really need any more work really to get

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.810 
really need any more work really to get
it<00:05:34.120> look<00:05:34.300> good<00:05:35.130> but<00:05:36.130> you<00:05:36.160> can<00:05:36.370> spend<00:05:36.580> a<00:05:36.640> lot<00:05:36.790> of

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:36.820 
it look good but you can spend a lot of

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:38.690 
it look good but you can spend a lot of
time<00:05:37.150> just<00:05:37.180> trying<00:05:38.110> different<00:05:38.380> things

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:38.700 
time just trying different things

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:42.270 
time just trying different things
flocking<00:05:39.700> the<00:05:39.910> miniature<00:05:40.240> itself<00:05:40.600> or<00:05:41.280> giving

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:42.280 
flocking the miniature itself or giving

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:44.790 
flocking the miniature itself or giving
it<00:05:42.400> a<00:05:42.640> lot<00:05:42.880> of<00:05:42.910> more<00:05:43.360> washes<00:05:43.870> or<00:05:44.050> changing<00:05:44.530> the

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:44.800 
it a lot of more washes or changing the

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.800 
it a lot of more washes or changing the
brown<00:05:45.160> color<00:05:45.490> so<00:05:45.760> that<00:05:45.790> you<00:05:46.060> can<00:05:46.240> get<00:05:46.540> more

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:46.810 
brown color so that you can get more

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:48.900 
brown color so that you can get more
variation<00:05:47.530> of<00:05:47.650> color<00:05:47.830> but<00:05:48.610> that's

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:48.910 
variation of color but that's

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:51.150 
variation of color but that's
technically<00:05:49.540> it<00:05:49.720> and<00:05:50.050> I<00:05:50.410> like<00:05:50.590> it<00:05:50.740> how<00:05:50.950> it
