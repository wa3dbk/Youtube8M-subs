 The kit is such a key here 

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:25.960
 taken out 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:29.000
 Simka is inserted again closes 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:33.460
 the phone is unlocked as the original 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:37.100
 with a slight movement here we can see 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.880
 our benchmark points 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.420

 quad here we can see 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:01:02.270
 memory information of other characteristics 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:06.889
 phones from several desktops 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:08.810
 this is not the limit these two desktops have 

00:01:06.889 --> 00:01:10.539
 full Russian keyboard is 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:14.259
 full English to go 

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:19.060

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:19.060
 buttons more buttons less please 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:27.889
 the settings are all as in the original absolutely 

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:32.060
 the screen is very sensitive you see here 

00:01:27.889 --> 00:01:34.909
 a small distortion kurt now on 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.770
 the screen is because on the phone 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:38.380
 glued film here so we can not 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:44.170
 take off 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:44.170
 there is a slight distortion of it 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:50.270
 drop down top menu allows us 

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:52.459
 see what's included 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:55.099
 Wi-Fi and bluetooth chip phone 

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:58.179
 feels great on the Internet as 

00:01:55.099 --> 00:02:01.999
 we already saw wi-fi us on 

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:05.359
 go to the safari browser standard for 

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:09.399
 iPhones we type you Russian language 

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:10.940
 set to change it in english 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:16.280
 recruit 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:20.380
 mail.ru let's go download very 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:24.320
 quickly need to increase decrease 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:29.090
 scale everything please accelero it 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:37.240
 it works if we do something like this 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:37.240
 the same thing somewhere with a knife something goes 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:49.960
 Now let's go to one site and see how 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:52.810
 flash player works well 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:56.940
 like so click on youtube then 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.940
 Immediately throw us out on google search 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:07.270
 various videos 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:18.890
 here all happened some 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:21.960
 roller 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:25.170
 for some reason do not want to make available for 

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:29.520
 mobile devices well come out 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:32.090
 let's see something else went loading 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:32.090
 video 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.569
 but 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:58.010
 speaker sound from the speaker in goes 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:00.670
 directly from here as in the original 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:03.770
 so the sound is very good quality 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:05.810
 I also remind you that this is a small one 

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:08.750
 here on the screen the distortion is due to 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:10.910
 films which in principle need only 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:13.370
 in order for the phone to reach you 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:14.000
 then you can remove and paste another 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:20.630
 film 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:22.669
 buy a phone from us too 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:25.430
 maximum adapted to the original as 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:27.040
 I have already said you can create new 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:29.570
 work tables 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:31.090
 with such a light movement we created 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:35.919
 third desktop 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:38.960
 Now we have three desktops 1 2 3 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:43.610
 you can also delete this worker 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:47.840
 the desk is all with us now desktops 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:50.900
 2 again about the programs we have here 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:53.200
 there is an established benchmark which 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:57.040
 shows us the characteristics of the phone 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:05:00.380
 10 thousand points scored we showed 

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:02.390
 let's say we want to remove it not even 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:05.720
 its some other program like but it 

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:06.770
 make click and appears here 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:09.560
 cross 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:15.550
 click on the cross to delete the application 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:18.160
 Please delete before deleting 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:20.570
 everything 

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:23.420
 icons tremble because they can 

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:27.140
 move it done as in the original 

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:32.450
 we can move the horses in some places to clean 

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:36.080
 them somewhere and things like that now u 

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:39.190
 here we are two icons can change them 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:39.190
 in some places we can 

00:05:42.849 --> 00:05:55.179
 do this again to bring out the icon 

00:05:48.819 --> 00:05:57.999
 directly back all manipulations with 

00:05:55.179 --> 00:06:02.259
 With all this, I think it will be interesting. 

00:05:57.999 --> 00:06:04.679
 do we here disassemble the tukos in 

00:06:02.259 --> 00:06:10.360
 phone 8 gigabytes of internal memory 

00:06:04.679 --> 00:06:12.520
 sometimes 16 but less memory 

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:15.550
 located directly on the phone as 

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:16.019
 and in the original the memory card is ordinary micro 

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:18.699
 sd 

00:06:16.019 --> 00:06:22.300
 if you are not satisfied with this amount you 

00:06:18.699 --> 00:06:26.709
 want more you unscrew the two 

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:29.789
 screw the back cover off too 

00:06:26.709 --> 00:06:32.409
 in the original put there a memory card 

00:06:29.789 --> 00:06:34.899
 close the back cover unscrew two 

00:06:32.409 --> 00:06:37.509
 cog do it please if you 

00:06:34.899 --> 00:06:39.339
 really need more memory they 

00:06:37.509 --> 00:06:43.959
 just so you need it because 

00:06:39.339 --> 00:06:48.309
 necessary because all sorts of manipulations with 

00:06:43.959 --> 00:06:50.139
 dismantling the phone is not very good I would 

00:06:48.309 --> 00:06:51.449
 said so if you are all the more not 

00:06:50.139 --> 00:06:53.619
 know how 

00:06:51.449 --> 00:06:56.409
 phone picking go phone 

00:06:53.619 --> 00:07:02.189
 charging and esbe headphones box grant 

00:06:56.409 --> 00:07:09.669
 warranty card instruction also 

00:07:02.189 --> 00:07:12.220
 glass can show the box as in 

00:07:09.669 --> 00:07:14.400
 the original 

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:14.400
 here 

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:23.400
 here directly components 

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:31.220
 headphones did not want to say separately 

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:31.220
 food in this brand and flat version 

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:40.320
 everything else headphones are more accurate and usb 

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:43.400
 cable charging is standard think 

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:43.400
 no need to show
