so let us know what your plans are for
both<00:00:37.670> of<00:00:37.850> these<00:00:37.970> metals<00:00:38.330> absolutely<00:00:39.260> well

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.410 
both of these metals absolutely well

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:41.170 
both of these metals absolutely well
we've<00:00:39.680> had<00:00:39.710> a<00:00:40.370> great<00:00:40.640> deal<00:00:40.879> of<00:00:40.910> success

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:41.180 
we've had a great deal of success

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.390 
we've had a great deal of success
through<00:00:41.750> the<00:00:41.930> bankable<00:00:42.440> feasibility<00:00:42.500> study

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:43.400 
through the bankable feasibility study

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.400 
through the bankable feasibility study
process<00:00:43.940> we<00:00:44.660> found<00:00:44.960> that<00:00:45.080> there's<00:00:45.260> an

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:45.410 
process we found that there's an

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.800 
process we found that there's an
iron-rich<00:00:45.800> camp<00:00:46.370> that<00:00:46.579> we<00:00:46.730> can<00:00:46.970> move<00:00:47.270> and<00:00:47.480> sell

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:47.810 
iron-rich camp that we can move and sell

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:49.690 
iron-rich camp that we can move and sell
and<00:00:48.110> we're<00:00:48.860> talking<00:00:49.010> to<00:00:49.310> different<00:00:49.460> off

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:49.700 
and we're talking to different off

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.780 
and we're talking to different off
takers<00:00:50.739> potential<00:00:51.739> buyers<00:00:51.950> about<00:00:52.550> that

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:52.790 
takers potential buyers about that

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:54.190 
takers potential buyers about that
because<00:00:53.239> we'd<00:00:53.450> like<00:00:53.570> to<00:00:53.690> get<00:00:53.809> that<00:00:53.930> going

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:54.200 
because we'd like to get that going

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.299 
because we'd like to get that going
before<00:00:54.440> the<00:00:54.620> middle<00:00:54.829> of<00:00:54.950> next<00:00:55.010> year<00:00:56.230> further

00:00:57.299 --> 00:00:57.309 
before the middle of next year further

00:00:57.309 --> 00:00:59.979 
before the middle of next year further
in<00:00:58.309> relation<00:00:58.730> to<00:00:58.850> the<00:00:58.969> nickel<00:00:59.270> and<00:00:59.480> the<00:00:59.510> cobalt

00:00:59.979 --> 00:00:59.989 
in relation to the nickel and the cobalt

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:02.530 
in relation to the nickel and the cobalt
we've<00:01:00.410> found<00:01:00.739> different<00:01:01.309> ways<00:01:01.489> of<00:01:01.760> optimizing

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:02.540 
we've found different ways of optimizing

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.260 
we've found different ways of optimizing
the<00:01:02.630> all<00:01:02.809> each<00:01:03.110> to<00:01:03.920> recover<00:01:04.250> even<00:01:04.520> more<00:01:04.850> nickel

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:05.270 
the all each to recover even more nickel

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:08.830 
the all each to recover even more nickel
and<00:01:05.420> cobalt<00:01:05.570> whilst<00:01:06.229> using<00:01:06.470> less<00:01:06.770> acid<00:01:07.840> and

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
and cobalt whilst using less acid and

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.130 
and cobalt whilst using less acid and
that<00:01:09.110> will<00:01:09.350> have<00:01:09.590> a<00:01:09.619> substantial<00:01:10.250> effect

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:11.140 
that will have a substantial effect

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.749 
that will have a substantial effect
above<00:01:12.140> the<00:01:12.500> figures<00:01:12.979> that<00:01:13.009> we<00:01:13.280> announced

00:01:13.749 --> 00:01:13.759 
above the figures that we announced

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:17.260 
above the figures that we announced
about<00:01:14.030> four<00:01:14.570> months<00:01:14.750> ago<00:01:15.160> with<00:01:16.160> mfc<00:01:16.729> so<00:01:17.060> the

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270 
about four months ago with mfc so the

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:18.850 
about four months ago with mfc so the
bankable<00:01:17.600> feasibility<00:01:17.659> studies<00:01:18.560> basically

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:18.860 
bankable feasibility studies basically

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.859 
bankable feasibility studies basically
complete<00:01:19.490> and<00:01:19.760> now<00:01:20.299> what<00:01:20.479> we're<00:01:20.600> doing<00:01:20.630> is

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:20.869 
complete and now what we're doing is

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:23.289 
complete and now what we're doing is
just<00:01:20.930> a<00:01:21.110> bit<00:01:21.229> of<00:01:21.290> all<00:01:21.470> each<00:01:21.700> optimization<00:01:22.700> to

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:23.299 
just a bit of all each optimization to

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:24.880 
just a bit of all each optimization to
recover<00:01:23.600> some<00:01:23.840> more<00:01:24.020> nickel<00:01:24.350> and<00:01:24.560> some<00:01:24.770> more

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
recover some more nickel and some more

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:26.469 
recover some more nickel and some more
cobalt<00:01:25.340> and<00:01:25.430> that's<00:01:25.610> going<00:01:25.790> extremely<00:01:26.330> well

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479 
cobalt and that's going extremely well

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:28.390 
cobalt and that's going extremely well
so<00:01:27.409> I'm<00:01:27.530> very<00:01:27.560> pleased<00:01:27.979> with<00:01:28.100> the<00:01:28.250> way

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
out to market soon but essentially we've

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.310 
out to market soon but essentially we've
completed<00:02:58.739> 6<00:02:59.160> 200<00:02:59.760> litre<00:02:59.970> tests<00:03:00.510> they've

hours<00:03:03.989> per<00:03:04.019> kilo<00:03:04.650> of<00:03:04.680> acid<00:03:05.190> we're<00:03:06.090> very<00:03:06.330> very

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
hours per kilo of acid we're very very

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.040 
hours per kilo of acid we're very very
happy<00:03:06.959> with<00:03:07.500> that<00:03:07.970> and<00:03:08.970> obviously<00:03:09.209> that<00:03:09.600> cuts

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
happy with that and obviously that cuts

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:12.070 
happy with that and obviously that cuts
down<00:03:10.260> the<00:03:10.320> size<00:03:10.680> of<00:03:10.800> your<00:03:10.860> tailings<00:03:11.370> dam

removes use of limestone cuts down your
acid<00:03:16.680> usage<00:03:17.100> so<00:03:17.370> on<00:03:17.459> and<00:03:17.580> so<00:03:17.610> forth<00:03:17.730> there's

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
acid usage so on and so forth there's

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.540 
acid usage so on and so forth there's
many<00:03:18.780> many<00:03:18.930> savings<00:03:19.530> as<00:03:19.830> a<00:03:19.890> result<00:03:20.190> of<00:03:20.489> that
