00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630

auto<00:00:24.900> six<00:00:25.580> but<00:00:26.580> what<00:00:26.789> I<00:00:26.820> wanted<00:00:27.150> to<00:00:27.210> talk<00:00:27.510> about

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
auto six but what I wanted to talk about

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.200 
auto six but what I wanted to talk about
was<00:00:28.109> the<00:00:28.439> main<00:00:28.710> protagonist<00:00:29.070> there<00:00:29.820> are<00:00:29.910> a<00:00:29.970> lot

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
was the main protagonist there are a lot

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.260 
was the main protagonist there are a lot
of<00:00:30.240> reports<00:00:31.050> that<00:00:31.260> for<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:31.920> first<00:00:32.189> time<00:00:32.460> main

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
of reports that for the first time main

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.660 
of reports that for the first time main
protagonists<00:00:33.989> in<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.230> game<00:00:34.440> will<00:00:34.739> be<00:00:34.980> female

protagonists in the game will be female

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.940 
protagonists in the game will be female
I<00:00:36.000> think<00:00:36.630> that<00:00:36.780> would<00:00:36.870> be<00:00:36.989> pretty<00:00:37.170> cool<00:00:37.320> now

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
I think that would be pretty cool now

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.760 
I think that would be pretty cool now
mostly<00:00:38.489> it's<00:00:39.120> probably<00:00:39.510> just<00:00:39.899> to<00:00:40.320> get<00:00:40.530> more

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
mostly it's probably just to get more

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.590 
mostly it's probably just to get more

attention to the game rockstar likes to
do<00:00:42.750> that<00:00:42.899> late--<00:00:43.200> they<00:00:43.559> like<00:00:43.770> to<00:00:43.890> do<00:00:44.010> whatever

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
do that late-- they like to do whatever

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.160 
do that late-- they like to do whatever
is<00:00:44.579> going<00:00:44.820> to<00:00:44.910> get<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.210> most<00:00:45.360> attention<00:00:45.539> for

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
is going to get the most attention for

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.100 
is going to get the most attention for
their<00:00:46.200> game<00:00:46.559> right<00:00:47.250> before<00:00:47.399> it<00:00:47.789> releases<00:00:48.149> so<00:00:49.079> I

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
their game right before it releases so I

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.760 
their game right before it releases so I
think<00:00:49.620> we<00:00:49.770> will<00:00:49.950> see<00:00:50.340> a<00:00:50.579> female<00:00:51.149> protagonist

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:51.770 
think we will see a female protagonist

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.889 
think we will see a female protagonist
hopefully<00:00:52.770> she<00:00:53.340> is<00:00:53.430> a<00:00:53.460> goober<00:00:54.210> badass

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
hopefully she is a goober badass

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.709 
hopefully she is a goober badass

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
character because in my opinion I think

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.750 
character because in my opinion I think
the<00:00:58.170> characters<00:00:58.379> here<00:00:58.949> in<00:00:59.129> Grand<00:00:59.399> Theft<00:00:59.579> Auto

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
5 we're a little bit disappointed I

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.139 
5 we're a little bit disappointed I
thought<00:01:02.340> that<00:01:02.399> they<00:01:02.730> could<00:01:02.760> have<00:01:03.000> been<00:01:03.090> a

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
thought that they could have been a

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.880 
thought that they could have been a
little<00:01:03.329> bit<00:01:03.510> better<00:01:03.660> Trevor<00:01:04.379> started<00:01:04.650> off

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
little bit better Trevor started off

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.710 
little bit better Trevor started off
pretty<00:01:05.100> cool<00:01:05.460> but<00:01:05.640> it<00:01:05.760> turned<00:01:06.000> out<00:01:06.210> he<00:01:06.450> was<00:01:06.540> a

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
pretty cool but it turned out he was a

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.679 
pretty cool but it turned out he was a
complete<00:01:07.140> crazy<00:01:07.830> motherfucker<00:01:08.729> and<00:01:09.060> he

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
complete crazy motherfucker and he

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.960 
complete crazy motherfucker and he
wasn't<00:01:09.900> very<00:01:10.170> like<00:01:10.470> likable<00:01:11.220> I<00:01:11.369> still<00:01:11.790> like<00:01:11.939> to

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
wasn't very like likable I still like to

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.700 
wasn't very like likable I still like to
use<00:01:12.210> them<00:01:12.479> especially<00:01:12.689> in<00:01:13.049> free<00:01:13.260> roam<00:01:13.290> mode

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
use them especially in free roam mode

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.300 
use them especially in free roam mode
Franklin<00:01:14.700> to<00:01:15.030> me<00:01:15.180> he<00:01:16.049> complains<00:01:16.560> a<00:01:16.799> little<00:01:17.130> bit

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
Franklin to me he complains a little bit

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.520 
Franklin to me he complains a little bit
too<00:01:17.580> much<00:01:17.790> I<00:01:18.180> still<00:01:18.659> think<00:01:18.869> he's<00:01:18.990> okay<00:01:19.170> and<00:01:19.380> I

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
too much I still think he's okay and I

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.100 
too much I still think he's okay and I
like<00:01:19.680> his<00:01:19.830> special<00:01:20.220> ability<00:01:20.420> but<00:01:21.420> I<00:01:21.750> think

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
like his special ability but I think

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.210 
like his special ability but I think
they<00:01:22.229> could<00:01:22.409> have<00:01:22.500> done<00:01:22.530> better<00:01:22.890> especially

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
they could have done better especially

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.820 
they could have done better especially
if<00:01:23.580> they<00:01:23.700> made<00:01:23.880> it<00:01:23.909> more<00:01:24.180> like<00:01:24.390> CJ<00:01:25.080> who's<00:01:25.650> my

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
if they made it more like CJ who's my

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
if they made it more like CJ who's my
favorite<00:01:26.130> character<00:01:26.850> in<00:01:27.030> GTA<00:01:27.869> history<00:01:28.500> for<00:01:29.250> CJ

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
favorite character in GTA history for CJ

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.660 
favorite character in GTA history for CJ
from<00:01:30.630> grand<00:01:31.079> theft<00:01:31.290> auto<00:01:31.530> san<00:01:31.950> andreas<00:01:32.009> the

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
from grand theft auto san andreas the

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.249 
from grand theft auto san andreas the
original<00:01:33.560> protagonist<00:01:34.560> in<00:01:35.100> san<00:01:35.520> andreas<00:01:36.259> now

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
original protagonist in san andreas now

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.530 
original protagonist in san andreas now
i<00:01:37.710> think<00:01:37.950> we<00:01:38.520> will<00:01:38.759> have<00:01:38.820> a<00:01:39.090> female

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
i think we will have a female

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.170 
i think we will have a female
protagonist<00:01:39.930> but<00:01:40.920> it<00:01:41.189> probably<00:01:41.490> will<00:01:41.759> not<00:01:41.939> be

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
protagonist but it probably will not be

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.130 
protagonist but it probably will not be
the<00:01:42.479> only<00:01:42.509> main<00:01:43.500> protagonist<00:01:43.770> in<00:01:44.430> the<00:01:44.700> game

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
the only main protagonist in the game

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.550 
the only main protagonist in the game
GTA<00:01:46.140> 5<00:01:46.649> has<00:01:47.100> three<00:01:47.640> main<00:01:48.149> protagonists<00:01:48.990> so<00:01:49.530> i

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
GTA 5 has three main protagonists so i

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.190 
GTA 5 has three main protagonists so i
think<00:01:49.710> that<00:01:50.009> in<00:01:50.430> GTA<00:01:50.880> 6<00:01:50.970> they<00:01:51.540> might<00:01:51.780> take<00:01:52.079> it

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
think that in GTA 6 they might take it

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.800 
think that in GTA 6 they might take it
up<00:01:52.320> a<00:01:52.439> notch<00:01:52.619> too<00:01:53.369> since<00:01:53.850> that<00:01:54.570> would<00:01:54.720> be

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
up a notch too since that would be

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.780 
up a notch too since that would be
pretty<00:01:55.020> cool<00:01:55.140> it<00:01:55.680> might<00:01:55.950> be<00:01:56.130> a<00:01:56.159> little<00:01:56.579> bit

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
pretty cool it might be a little bit

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.359 
pretty cool it might be a little bit
tough<00:01:57.090> but<00:01:57.420> it<00:01:58.380> would<00:01:58.740> make<00:01:58.890> sense<00:01:58.920> with<00:01:59.340> the

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
tough but it would make sense with the

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.069 
tough but it would make sense with the
title<00:01:59.850> and<00:02:00.119> it<00:02:00.329> would<00:02:00.450> give<00:02:00.570> you<00:02:00.719> a<00:02:00.750> lot<00:02:00.960> of

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
title and it would give you a lot of

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.090 
title and it would give you a lot of
different<00:02:01.380> options<00:02:01.710> a<00:02:01.799> lot<00:02:01.950> of<00:02:02.070> different

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
different options a lot of different

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.160

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
now I feel GTA 6 will probably be on the

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.560 
now I feel GTA 6 will probably be on the
xbox<00:03:12.970> one<00:03:13.270> the<00:03:13.480> pc<00:03:13.930> and<00:03:13.959> the<00:03:14.380> ps4<00:03:15.570> sola

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
shouldn't take too long for us to get it

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:19.650 
shouldn't take too long for us to get it
they're<00:03:18.430> going<00:03:18.520> to<00:03:18.610> use<00:03:18.760> probably<00:03:19.209> pretty

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
they're going to use probably pretty

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.630 
they're going to use probably pretty
close<00:03:19.840> to<00:03:20.140> this<00:03:20.260> engine<00:03:20.830> it'll<00:03:21.310> look<00:03:21.400> better

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
close to this engine it'll look better

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.199 
close to this engine it'll look better
but<00:03:22.150> this<00:03:22.360> looks<00:03:22.540> fantastic<00:03:22.750> as<00:03:23.500> it<00:03:23.530> is<00:03:24.209> we
