00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
play them in triplets which is a

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:48.470 
play them in triplets which is a
symmetric<00:00:37.500> it's<00:00:37.680> not<00:00:37.800> gonna<00:00:37.920> be<00:00:47.480> playing

symmetric it's not gonna be playing
rudiments<00:00:49.079> in<00:00:49.170> an<00:00:49.320> asymmetric<00:00:50.039> ways<00:00:51.079> which

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
rudiments in an asymmetric ways which

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.610 
rudiments in an asymmetric ways which
means<00:00:52.350> with<00:00:52.559> a<00:00:52.590> different<00:00:53.280> rhythm<00:00:54.440> makes<00:00:55.440> them

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
means with a different rhythm makes them

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.619 
means with a different rhythm makes them
sound<00:00:55.860> much<00:00:56.250> more<00:00:56.280> interesting<00:00:56.940> you<00:00:57.149> know

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:23.950 
you can do with double throws I run the
