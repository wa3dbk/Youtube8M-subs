00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 inside this crystal carries 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:08.670
 diodes of light with semiconductors 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:11.610
 that is what we have innovated is 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.320
 open here opens here then 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.870
 has got here the chip has the 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.820
 capacitors those capacitors in the 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.119
 If they are damaged, it may be worth 0 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.610
 20 0 25 euros is changed and is again 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.780
 as new for another 100 years 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:27.730
 surprisingly, benito is closed 

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:30.990
 all the doors and it costs 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.990
 market your light bulb 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.350
 we can not send them to the 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.780
 usual distribution channels 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:41.530
 because they do not want them 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:44.800
 continue selling those that merge 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:47.680
 Well specifically that they live from 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.269
 this and that the bulbs that do not 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.129
 they melt so people would not go to 

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:54.219
 replenish them what we would have to 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:55.930
 pose is the system change and for 

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:58.390
 of course it is sustainable and it is very 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:00.220
 profitable because if things last longer 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.750
 Nor they are designed to sell more 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:04.299
 cheap because people do not have to 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:05.950
 buy them back in a long time and they 

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:08.470
 would also create a second market 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.770
 hand that could work a lot 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:13.750
 people go back to the apprentices from before 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.490
 Benito has even received threats to 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:18.910
 that does not manufacture light bulbs and what is it 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:21.820
 that teach us this is the complaint to the 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:24.399
 police of the threats says 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.710
 Mr. Walls can not market the market 

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:29.409
 electric lighting line but its 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:32.710
 programmed essence if you reconsider and 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:34.569
 he does not do his debts in bank bbv have 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:37.210
 will be removed if you get large 

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:39.700
 benefits in country where you say 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:42.400
 if you on the contrary decide to continue 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:45.550
 go ahead with your plans 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:47.410
 of marketing will be embargoed 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:49.370
 goods and their lives that of their families 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:52.040
 they will be annihilated 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:54.950
 a year only in Spain- are sold 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.220
 around 15 million units of 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.560
 light bulbs 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:01.710
 we can imagine what that means to 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:04.140
 world level also the cake that 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.780
 this means what I believe I am 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:10.280
 convinced that there are huge interests 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:14.780
 so that everything stays the same 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:17.120
 and how they have deceived us so much because we 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.310
 They have cheated because 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.849
 there are no programs like yours 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:24.680
 to report that these things exist 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:26.420
 everything that is on television all 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.030
 the days are economists saying that 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:31.099
 to get out of this you have to grow 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:33.170
 we are immersed in politics 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:34.700
 economic growth all the time 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:37.790
 and growth when it is not true 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.709
 grow means consume consume more 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.780
 consume means to manufacture from this 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:44.170
 way and that brings us to disaster in the 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.170
 that we are 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.720
 needs to
