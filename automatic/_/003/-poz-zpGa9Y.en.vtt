00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
humans have been coming to Britain for

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:08.089 
humans have been coming to Britain for
nearly<00:00:05.759> a<00:00:05.850> million<00:00:06.210> years<00:00:06.629> at<00:00:07.200> least<00:00:07.259> 10<00:00:07.859> waves

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
nearly a million years at least 10 waves

nearly a million years at least 10 waves
of<00:00:08.370> occupation<00:00:09.059> we're<00:00:09.269> in<00:00:09.420> the<00:00:09.510> last<00:00:09.750> one<00:00:10.019> of

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
of occupation we're in the last one of

of occupation we're in the last one of
those<00:00:10.260> now<00:00:10.530> and<00:00:10.800> we<00:00:11.250> think<00:00:11.429> at<00:00:11.550> least<00:00:11.670> for

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
those now and we think at least for

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.240 
those now and we think at least for
human<00:00:12.480> species<00:00:12.929> were<00:00:13.080> involved<00:00:13.559> coming<00:00:14.160> to

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
human species were involved coming to

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.499 
human species were involved coming to
Britain<00:00:14.429> at<00:00:14.820> the<00:00:14.940> edge<00:00:15.089> of<00:00:15.269> the<00:00:15.420> inhabited

times much more severe than today we

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.599

especially<00:02:35.760> with<00:02:36.760> our<00:02:36.880> species<00:02:37.420> I<00:02:37.690> was<00:02:38.110> very

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
especially with our species I was very

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.230 
especially with our species I was very

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
I didn't expect them to go back quite

I didn't expect them to go back quite
that<00:02:42.400> far<00:02:42.640> the<00:02:43.300> ingenuity<00:02:43.660> I<00:02:43.840> think<00:02:44.170> of<00:02:44.350> seeing

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
that far the ingenuity I think of seeing

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.790 
that far the ingenuity I think of seeing
how<00:02:45.370> things<00:02:45.640> were<00:02:45.760> made<00:02:45.940> back<00:02:46.780> then<00:02:47.050> was

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
how things were made back then was

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.150 
how things were made back then was
fascinating<00:02:48.490> to<00:02:48.670> actually<00:02:49.420> see<00:02:49.750> this<00:02:50.440> oldest

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
part of a human that existed in Britain

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.240
