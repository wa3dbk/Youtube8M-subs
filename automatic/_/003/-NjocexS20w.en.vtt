00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:11.300
 hello everyone with you test lab 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:13.610
 oldie 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:15.379
 and I, Ivan Korolyov, today we will tell 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:17.539
 to you about a worthy successor to the line 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:20.330
 Ultrabook Transformers from the company 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:22.160
 lenovo ideapad yoga 2 pro 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:23.870
 its main difference from its predecessor 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.930
 this is intel intel haswell 

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:29.540
 screen with unreal resolution of 3200 on 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:29.990
 1800 pixels and reduced dimensions and 

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:32.840
 weight 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:34.610
 but let's not get ahead of ourselves and start by 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:38.420
 traditions from the delivery set 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:40.879
 it is quite standard ultrabook unit itself 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.859
 power supply instruction set and warranty 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:44.989
 coupon as before 

00:00:42.859 --> 00:00:46.969
 two body colors available 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:49.249
 neutral silver and bright orange 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:51.649
 Spring is in the yard and we have a test 

00:00:49.249 --> 00:00:53.629
 ultrabook of positive color with slightly 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:55.850
 rough pleasant to the touch outside 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:57.829
 surface housing at first glance 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.390
 lenovo ideapad yoga 2 pro 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:02.120
 outwardly not much different from his 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.859
 predecessor but as they say the devil 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:07.159
 Covered in the details and attentive inspection 

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:09.530
 makes it clear that there are differences so 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:10.009
 for example interface elements connectors and 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.590
 buttons 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:14.299
 changed their location on the left 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:18.649
 the end we see the connector 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:20.630
 power supply port yuesby port 30 micro port 

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:22.909
 hdmi who came to replace 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.500
 full format connectors due to common 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:27.920
 thinning device 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:30.500
 and also see the front end card reader 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.350
 purposes of the same refinement delivered from 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.909
 any interface elements 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:37.039
 so the system restore button until 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:38.680
 factory settings power button 

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:40.969
 power off and LED indicator 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.070
 moved to the right end 

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:45.350
 there is also a lock button 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.840
 auto screen flip rocker 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.369
 volume control connector three with 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.100
 half a millimeter to connect 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:54.439
 wired headset style and port everywhere 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.149
 20 from him by the way you can charge 

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:59.299
 devices even when the ultrabook itself 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:01.549
 off the rear end remained external 

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:04.670
 unchanged here we see only slots 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:07.159
 cooling systems open ultrabook 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.960
 the first thing that catches the eye 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:11.540
 windows turned from mechanical 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:13.330
 the touch is located above her mark 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.879
 glossy multi-touch screen with a diagonal 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.670
 13 3 inch ips matrix and record for 

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:21.030
 ultrabooks 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.230
 resolution of 3200 by 1800 pixels 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.620
 pixel density 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:28.819
 276 an inch above the screen are located 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:31.200
 hd webcam and light sensor 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:34.080
 hinge design allows you to open 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.480
 360 degree devices per pair 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.459
 seconds turning the ultrabook into a tablet 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.319
 tablet us state as in 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:42.420
 intermediate variations console and 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:43.680
 presentation touchpad and keyboard 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.930
 device is locked 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.670
 it prevents unwanted clicks 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.090
 and you can control the device using 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:52.050
 10 point touch screen 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.069
 surface on which are located 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.480
 keyboard and touchpad 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:56.430
 made of rubberized material 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.380
 so that the device does not slide of 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.299
 tablet console or 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.110
 presentational state itself 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:03.090
 keyboard unit 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:05.280
 recessed into key case 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.500
 purchased a light edging and turn on 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.870
 your highlight is true intensity and and 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.730
 adjust touchpad won't work 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:15.209
 soft touch surface is enough 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:17.040
 big but slimy 2 yoga transformer 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:19.110
 noticeably throw off millimeters over all 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.299
 parameters it is noticeable visually and 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:23.010
 lost 150 grams compared to 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:25.250
 predecessor now it weighs 1 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:28.049
 kilo 390 grams 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:31.470

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:33.510
 dual core intel core i5 4200 with 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.430
 clock frequency of 16 gigahertz and 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.290
 possibility of increasing to 2 and 6 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.799
 gigahertz thanks to turbo technology 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.170
 boost 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:41.750
 there are models with intel core i3 processors 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:44.489
 and intel core i7

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:52.079
 the possibility of increasing its volume is not 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:54.630
 solid state drive is provided 

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:56.310
 256 gigabytes also on the market 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:04:00.269
 there are models with drives

 bright juicy flowers picture 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:30.260
 detailed due to the huge 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:32.180
 permissions so much that viewing 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:34.150
 food photos on it can cause 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:36.320
 uncontrollable salivation 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:39.200
 let's go to testing and 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:40.310
 compare lenovo ideapad yoga 2 pro with its 

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:42.680
 predecessor in terms of 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:45.530
 performance synthetic test 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:47.990
 system performance yourself bass r11 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:49.250
 5 1 flow processor and superpi test 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:51.380
 32m 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:53.290
 test as close to real 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:57.430
 winrar built into the archiver 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:05:00.920
 501 graphic test 3dmark 2006 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:01.750
 Graphic test 3d mark 2011 in mode 

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:04.880
 performance 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:06.380
 aida 64 synthetic test and its 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:10.430
 results for both ultrabooks in 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:12.740
 pivot table and finally the time test 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:14.510
 battery life for this we 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:16.250
 turn off wireless interfaces 

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:18.020
 set the average brightness of the screen and 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:20.270
 we start the movie in this mode 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:20.830
 the device worked a little less than 6 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:24.320
 o'clock 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:26.270
 So let's summarize the ideapad yoga 2 pro 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:28.490
 it is rather evolution they are revolution 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:30.230
 logical development of the ultrabook line 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:32.120
 Transformers from the company lenovo 

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:33.800
 modern screen processor with 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.550
 increased resolution reduced 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:36.500
 dimensions and weight 

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:37.880
 high performance all this 

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:40.010
 makes devices a worthy successor 

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:42.910
 original ideapad yoga 

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:42.910
 goodbye
