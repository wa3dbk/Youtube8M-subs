one of the reasons but there are the
three<00:01:31.079> main<00:01:31.229> reasons<00:01:31.259> that<00:01:31.619> we<00:01:31.860> see<00:01:32.070> tend<00:01:32.400> to

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
three main reasons that we see tend to

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.690 
three main reasons that we see tend to

bit<00:01:39.329> of<00:01:39.450> a<00:01:39.509> historical<00:01:40.229> consideration<00:01:40.979> when

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
bit of a historical consideration when

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.030 
bit of a historical consideration when

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
it comes to cats cats natural history

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.469 
it comes to cats cats natural history
began<00:01:44.490> in<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:45.000> desert

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:34.389 
it's unnatural the problem is this cats

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:36.629 
it's unnatural the problem is this cats
don't<00:04:34.630> like<00:04:34.750> a<00:04:35.139> dirty<00:04:35.620> box<00:04:35.889> as<00:04:36.100> well<00:04:36.220> and<00:04:36.460> so

00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:36.639 
don't like a dirty box as well and so

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:38.219 
don't like a dirty box as well and so
even<00:04:37.000> if<00:04:37.090> you're<00:04:37.240> lifting<00:04:37.479> up<00:04:37.780> the<00:04:37.900> fecal

in<00:04:40.750> the<00:04:40.780> box<00:04:41.050> can<00:04:41.289> actually<00:04:41.710> provide<00:04:42.130> enough

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:42.580 
in the box can actually provide enough

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.249 
in the box can actually provide enough
of<00:04:42.669> a<00:04:42.759> deterrent<00:04:42.910> that<00:04:43.300> your<00:04:43.419> cat<00:04:43.660> will<00:04:43.900> not

00:04:44.249 --> 00:04:44.259 
of a deterrent that your cat will not

00:04:44.259 --> 00:04:46.710 
of a deterrent that your cat will not
use<00:04:44.470> that<00:04:44.500> box<00:04:44.860> again<00:04:45.039> so<00:04:45.460> if<00:04:45.669> you<00:04:46.300> are<00:04:46.449> using

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:46.720 
use that box again so if you are using

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.600 
use that box again so if you are using
unscented<00:04:47.560> litter<00:04:47.800> which<00:04:48.310> is<00:04:48.460> my

unscented litter which is my

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:50.909

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:50.919 
recommendation you have to be very

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:52.499 
recommendation you have to be very
fastidious<00:04:51.190> about<00:04:51.550> scooping<00:04:52.120> the<00:04:52.210> box

00:04:52.499 --> 00:04:52.509 
fastidious about scooping the box

00:04:52.509 --> 00:04:55.050 
fastidious about scooping the box
I<00:04:52.570> recommend<00:04:52.960> twice<00:04:53.139> a<00:04:53.199> day<00:04:53.470> and<00:04:53.759> removing<00:04:54.759> the

00:04:58.650 --> 00:04:58.660 
urine on a daily basis as well in fact I

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:00.240 
urine on a daily basis as well in fact I
recommend<00:04:58.840> that<00:04:59.169> you<00:04:59.289> disinfect<00:04:59.710> the<00:04:59.979> entire

recommend that you disinfect the entire
litter<00:05:00.580> pant<00:05:00.849> at<00:05:01.030> least<00:05:01.210> weekly<00:05:01.389> which<00:05:01.690> means

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:01.870 
litter pant at least weekly which means

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:03.510 
litter pant at least weekly which means
wash<00:05:02.080> it<00:05:02.289> and<00:05:02.470> you've<00:05:02.919> got<00:05:02.949> to<00:05:03.130> be<00:05:03.310> able<00:05:03.400> to

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:03.520 
wash it and you've got to be able to

because the the remaining urine odor in

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:09.180 
because the the remaining urine odor in
the<00:05:07.570> cat<00:05:07.780> box<00:05:07.990> can<00:05:08.410> be<00:05:08.440> enough<00:05:08.800> of<00:05:08.919> a<00:05:09.009> deterrent

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:09.190 
the cat box can be enough of a deterrent

when<00:05:33.580> cats<00:05:33.849> are<00:05:34.060> given<00:05:34.300> the<00:05:34.389> option<00:05:34.539> to<00:05:34.930> use

00:05:35.189 --> 00:05:35.199 
when cats are given the option to use

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:37.680 
when cats are given the option to use

statistically to use the carbon litters

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:45.170

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:54.310 
soda added to the litter so you might

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:56.939 
soda added to the litter so you might
want<00:05:54.490> to<00:05:54.520> consider<00:05:54.789> using<00:05:55.169> no<00:05:56.169> odor<00:05:56.560> control

version there again if you're not using
odor<00:06:03.310> control<00:06:03.490> that's<00:06:03.880> much<00:06:04.060> more<00:06:04.270> natural

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:06.600 
odor control that's much more natural
but<00:06:05.139> then<00:06:05.500> the<00:06:05.620> odor<00:06:05.830> is<00:06:06.039> much<00:06:06.220> more<00:06:06.400> prevalent

and<00:06:07.000> cats<00:06:07.330> do<00:06:07.599> not<00:06:07.780> want<00:06:07.960> to<00:06:08.050> use<00:06:08.169> a<00:06:08.199> dirty<00:06:08.440> box
