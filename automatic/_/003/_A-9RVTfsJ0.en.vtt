this is the most important skill for

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.880 
this is the most important skill for
your<00:00:46.710> build<00:00:47.039> the<00:00:47.969> backlash<00:00:48.480> itself<00:00:49.050> triggers

adds<00:01:12.330> more<00:01:12.630> dodge<00:01:12.869> to<00:01:13.229> your<00:01:13.700> to<00:01:14.700> your<00:01:14.729> spec<00:01:15.119> and

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
adds more dodge to your to your spec and

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.539 
adds more dodge to your to your spec and
then<00:01:15.900> one<00:01:16.200> with<00:01:16.350> everything<00:01:16.500> is<00:01:17.100> something<00:01:17.460> i

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
then one with everything is something i

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.999 
then one with everything is something i
chose<00:01:17.820> to<00:01:18.060> use<00:01:18.270> because<00:01:18.960> my<00:01:19.290> resist<00:01:19.740> was<00:01:19.979> a

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
chose to use because my resist was a

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.609 
chose to use because my resist was a
little<00:01:20.280> low<00:01:20.460> for<00:01:20.700> torment<00:01:21.240> for<00:01:21.450> you<00:01:22.290> can<00:01:22.439> also

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
little low for torment for you can also

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.830 
little low for torment for you can also
change<00:01:22.979> us<00:01:23.220> over<00:01:23.490> to<00:01:23.729> seize<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.600> initiative

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
change us over to seize the initiative

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:31.000 
change us over to seize the initiative
if<00:01:25.259> you<00:01:25.409> choose

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:31.010 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:34.860 

as<00:01:31.490> for<00:01:31.850> stats<00:01:32.560> I'm<00:01:33.560> actually<00:01:33.800> only<00:01:34.190> running

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:34.870 
as for stats I'm actually only running

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:37.840 
as for stats I'm actually only running
138,000<00:01:35.870> damage<00:01:36.230> for<00:01:36.620> torment<00:01:37.010> for<00:01:37.280> and<00:01:37.550> it<00:01:37.670> is

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
138,000 damage for torment for and it is

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.210 
138,000 damage for torment for and it is
doable<00:01:38.210> so<00:01:38.660> you<00:01:38.720> really<00:01:39.050> don't<00:01:39.410> need<00:01:39.680> to<00:01:39.740> be<00:01:39.980> up

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220 
doable so you really don't need to be up

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.780 
doable so you really don't need to be up
in<00:01:40.700> the<00:01:40.790> 200k<00:01:41.240> 300k<00:01:42.140> you<00:01:42.800> can<00:01:42.980> actually<00:01:43.670> do

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:43.790 
in the 200k 300k you can actually do

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:48.160 
in the 200k 300k you can actually do
torment<00:01:44.240> for<00:01:44.420> at<00:01:44.600> this<00:01:44.780> level<00:01:46.540> so<00:01:47.540> like<00:01:47.960> I<00:01:48.110> said

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
torment for at this level so like I said

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.530 
torment for at this level so like I said
earlier<00:01:48.590> I've<00:01:49.010> felt<00:01:49.550> little<00:01:49.850> over<00:01:50.150> fifty

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:50.540 
earlier I've felt little over fifty

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:56.500 
earlier I've felt little over fifty
percent<00:01:50.930> crit<00:01:53.320> life<00:01:54.320> on<00:01:54.530> hit<00:01:54.830> is<00:01:55.270> about<00:01:56.270> two

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:56.510 
percent crit life on hit is about two

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:58.510 
percent crit life on hit is about two
thousand<00:01:57.140> I<00:01:57.380> found<00:01:57.650> running<00:01:57.890> lesson<00:01:58.370> that

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
thousand I found running lesson that

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.660 
thousand I found running lesson that
actually<00:01:58.940> makes<00:01:59.150> it<00:01:59.360> quite<00:01:59.600> difficult<00:02:00.040> so<00:02:01.040> aim

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
actually makes it quite difficult so aim

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.790 
actually makes it quite difficult so aim
for<00:02:02.030> the<00:02:02.120> two<00:02:02.270> thousand<00:02:02.750> mark<00:02:02.990> or<00:02:03.229> higher<00:02:03.500> if

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:03.800 
for the two thousand mark or higher if

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.969 
for the two thousand mark or higher if
you<00:02:04.520> want<00:02:04.700> to<00:02:04.790> do<00:02:04.880> to<00:02:05.060> torment<00:02:05.720> for<00:02:05.990> you<00:02:06.260> can<00:02:06.410> of

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 
you want to do to torment for you can of

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:08.710 
you want to do to torment for you can of
course<00:02:07.040> go<00:02:07.490> to<00:02:07.550> a<00:02:07.670> lower<00:02:07.940> tour<00:02:08.270> net<00:02:08.420> if<00:02:08.600> you

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
course go to a lower tour net if you

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.010 
course go to a lower tour net if you
have<00:02:08.840> less<00:02:09.020> life<00:02:09.260> on<00:02:09.440> hit<00:02:10.420> so<00:02:11.420> my<00:02:11.510> current<00:02:11.870> to

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
have less life on hit so my current to

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.530 
have less life on hit so my current to
pieces<00:02:12.410> with<00:02:12.560> life<00:02:12.740> on<00:02:12.950> hit<00:02:13.250> are<00:02:13.460> these<00:02:14.150> two

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
pieces with life on hit are these two

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.190 
pieces with life on hit are these two
weapons<00:02:15.110> that<00:02:15.290> I<00:02:15.350> had<00:02:15.770> gotten<00:02:15.950> his<00:02:16.280> drops<00:02:17.200> 668
