00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
over here this little circle of energy

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.330 
over here this little circle of energy
is<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:06.299> balls<00:02:06.540> home<00:02:06.930> that's<00:02:07.590> ultimately<00:02:07.950> what

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
works and we've completed that level so

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.160 
works and we've completed that level so
we'll<00:03:05.260> scoot<00:03:05.560> up<00:03:05.650> to<00:03:05.799> the<00:03:05.859> next<00:03:06.040> one<00:03:06.280> and<00:03:07.170> if

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
we'll scoot up to the next one and if

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:09.930 
we'll scoot up to the next one and if
you<00:03:08.290> power<00:03:08.470> all<00:03:08.739> your<00:03:08.920> houses<00:03:09.129> you<00:03:09.760> learn

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
you power all your houses you learn

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:15.360 
you power all your houses you learn
three<00:03:10.269> stars<00:03:12.870> so<00:03:13.870> we've<00:03:14.319> zip<00:03:14.560> through<00:03:14.829> all<00:03:15.160> the

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
three stars so we've zip through all the

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.059 
three stars so we've zip through all the
houses<00:03:15.549> of<00:03:15.730> electricity<00:03:16.560> and<00:03:17.560> we've<00:03:17.769> won<00:03:17.949> the

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:18.069 
houses of electricity and we've won the

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:20.520 
houses of electricity and we've won the
level<00:03:18.340> you<00:03:19.150> can<00:03:19.299> see<00:03:19.449> as<00:03:19.690> you<00:03:19.720> progress<00:03:20.019> it

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
level you can see as you progress it

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.039 
level you can see as you progress it
definitely<00:03:21.220> gets<00:03:21.489> harder<00:03:21.910> there<00:03:22.810> are<00:03:22.900> more

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:23.049 
definitely gets harder there are more

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:26.059 
definitely gets harder there are more
obstacles<00:03:23.650> added<00:03:23.799> to<00:03:24.040> the<00:03:24.129> map<00:03:24.310> such<00:03:24.609> as<00:03:24.760> rocks

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:26.069 
obstacles added to the map such as rocks

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:28.020 
obstacles added to the map such as rocks
eventually<00:03:27.069> as<00:03:27.280> you<00:03:27.430> get<00:03:27.579> up<00:03:27.609> to<00:03:27.849> higher

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
eventually as you get up to higher

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.110 
eventually as you get up to higher
levels<00:03:28.349> there<00:03:29.349> will<00:03:29.500> be<00:03:29.680> multiple<00:03:30.310> balls<00:03:30.879> you

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
levels there will be multiple balls you

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.460 
levels there will be multiple balls you
have<00:03:31.239> to<00:03:31.299> move<00:03:31.540> around<00:03:31.690> the<00:03:31.900> screen<00:03:31.959> so

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
have to move around the screen so

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:35.039 
have to move around the screen so
instead<00:03:32.829> of<00:03:32.949> just<00:03:33.250> the<00:03:33.400> electric<00:03:33.879> ball<00:03:34.090> you'll

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:35.049 
instead of just the electric ball you'll

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:37.770 
instead of just the electric ball you'll
also<00:03:35.230> have<00:03:35.500> to<00:03:35.650> worry<00:03:35.859> about<00:03:36.480> steel<00:03:37.480> balls

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
also have to worry about steel balls

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.349 
also have to worry about steel balls
which<00:03:38.230> can<00:03:38.470> demolish<00:03:38.859> houses<00:03:39.459> so<00:03:39.879> naturally

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:40.359 
which can demolish houses so naturally

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:42.390 
which can demolish houses so naturally
you<00:03:40.480> don't<00:03:40.660> want<00:03:40.840> to<00:03:40.930> use<00:03:41.069> you<00:03:42.069> don't<00:03:42.220> want<00:03:42.340> to

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
you don't want to use you don't want to

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.439 
you don't want to use you don't want to
be<00:03:42.489> reckless<00:03:42.730> with<00:03:42.940> those<00:03:43.919> fire<00:03:44.919> balls<00:03:45.790> water

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:46.449 
be reckless with those fire balls water

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:48.150 
be reckless with those fire balls water
balls<00:03:46.750> a<00:03:47.049> whole<00:03:47.260> bunch<00:03:47.500> of<00:03:47.650> things<00:03:47.829> basically

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.160 
balls a whole bunch of things basically

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.030 
balls a whole bunch of things basically
it<00:03:48.579> becomes<00:03:48.940> a<00:03:49.120> huge<00:03:50.049> mix<00:03:50.440> and<00:03:50.680> instead<00:03:50.949> of

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
it becomes a huge mix and instead of

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.280 
it becomes a huge mix and instead of
controlling<00:03:51.459> just<00:03:51.760> one<00:03:51.970> you<00:03:52.750> have<00:03:52.870> to<00:03:52.959> get<00:03:53.079> all

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
controlling just one you have to get all

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:54.689 
controlling just one you have to get all
these<00:03:53.409> different<00:03:53.680> balls<00:03:54.040> into<00:03:54.370> different

00:03:54.689 --> 00:03:54.699 
these different balls into different

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:57.210 
these different balls into different
houses<00:03:55.290> one<00:03:56.290> thing<00:03:56.530> I<00:03:56.590> want<00:03:56.769> to<00:03:56.829> do<00:03:56.980> real<00:03:57.159> quick

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:25.730 
let's see what i'm doing here is trying
to<00:04:22.580> not<00:04:23.580> only<00:04:23.729> control<00:04:24.270> the<00:04:24.840> electric<00:04:25.229> ball<00:04:25.409> so

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
to not only control the electric ball so

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:31.429 
to not only control the electric ball so
it<00:04:25.770> covers<00:04:26.099> the<00:04:26.930> house<00:04:27.930> but<00:04:28.710> also<00:04:29.629> this<00:04:30.629> steel

00:04:31.429 --> 00:04:31.439 
it covers the house but also this steel

00:04:31.439 --> 00:04:34.309 
it covers the house but also this steel
ball<00:04:31.740> because<00:04:32.189> if<00:04:32.659> he<00:04:33.659> goes<00:04:33.840> across<00:04:34.080> the

00:04:34.309 --> 00:04:34.319 
ball because if he goes across the

00:04:34.319 --> 00:04:35.480 
ball because if he goes across the
screen<00:04:34.499> he'll<00:04:34.770> end<00:04:34.919> up<00:04:35.009> taking<00:04:35.340> out<00:04:35.460> that

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
screen he'll end up taking out that

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:38.269 
screen he'll end up taking out that
house<00:04:35.819> you<00:04:36.449> can<00:04:36.599> see<00:04:36.779> the<00:04:36.930> game<00:04:37.110> is<00:04:37.189> it's<00:04:38.189> a

00:04:38.269 --> 00:04:38.279 
house you can see the game is it's a

00:04:38.279 --> 00:04:39.559 
house you can see the game is it's a
bunch<00:04:38.520> of<00:04:38.639> trial<00:04:38.939> and<00:04:39.090> error<00:04:39.210> and<00:04:39.360> that's

00:04:39.559 --> 00:04:39.569 
bunch of trial and error and that's

00:04:39.569 --> 00:04:41.149 
bunch of trial and error and that's
what's<00:04:39.749> nice<00:04:39.930> if<00:04:40.229> you<00:04:40.349> make<00:04:40.499> a<00:04:40.529> mistake<00:04:40.650> or

00:04:41.149 --> 00:04:41.159 
what's nice if you make a mistake or

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:43.129 
what's nice if you make a mistake or
whatever<00:04:41.430> it<00:04:42.120> doesn't<00:04:42.180> count<00:04:42.599> against<00:04:43.020> you

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:43.139 
whatever it doesn't count against you

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:50.200 
whatever it doesn't count against you
there<00:04:43.710> we<00:04:43.830> go<00:04:45.560> so<00:04:46.560> that<00:04:46.879> level<00:04:47.879> is<00:04:47.939> completed

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:50.210 
there we go so that level is completed

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:55.790 
there we go so that level is completed
as<00:04:51.529> far<00:04:52.529> as<00:04:52.560> overall<00:04:53.810> thoughts<00:04:54.810> and<00:04:55.289> you<00:04:55.740> know

00:05:02.809 --> 00:05:02.819 
the sense that it's got a lot of things

00:05:02.819 --> 00:05:06.140 
the sense that it's got a lot of things
going<00:05:03.270> on<00:05:03.360> especially<00:05:03.629> as<00:05:04.289> you<00:05:05.189> move<00:05:05.430> up<00:05:05.729> to

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:06.150 
going on especially as you move up to

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.839 
going on especially as you move up to
the<00:05:06.240> higher<00:05:06.389> levels<00:05:07.009> it's<00:05:08.009> definitely<00:05:08.639> fun

00:05:08.839 --> 00:05:08.849 
the higher levels it's definitely fun

00:05:08.849 --> 00:05:12.050 
the higher levels it's definitely fun
and<00:05:09.599> it's<00:05:09.839> definitely<00:05:10.349> addicting<00:05:11.009> um<00:05:11.189> I've

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:12.060 
and it's definitely addicting um I've

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:14.839 
and it's definitely addicting um I've
had<00:05:12.270> a<00:05:12.300> hard<00:05:12.509> time<00:05:12.569> putting<00:05:13.469> it<00:05:13.620> down<00:05:13.770> for<00:05:14.669> sure

00:05:14.839 --> 00:05:14.849 
had a hard time putting it down for sure

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:16.790 
had a hard time putting it down for sure
and<00:05:15.389> I'm<00:05:15.509> not<00:05:15.539> a<00:05:15.749> huge<00:05:15.930> fan<00:05:16.050> of<00:05:16.229> puzzle<00:05:16.620> games
