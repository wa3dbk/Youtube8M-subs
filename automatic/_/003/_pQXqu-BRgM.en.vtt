00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:06.560

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:13.560

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:16.700
Hi I'm Mark Williams for pickup trucks dot
com and we're here in Detroit where

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:17.890
we've just received

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:22.360
a sneak peek have the 2015 Chevy
Colorado

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:26.540
now this is GM's all-new mid-size pickup
truck and we don't have all the details

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:27.259
yet

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:30.990
but here's what we do know as usual

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.140
some of the most dramatic design cues for this brand new track

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.410
are right up here in the grill big Chevy
bow-tie

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.019
almost sports eyeglass last type headlights

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:44.449
and no seals in the front for a row in
fact

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:47.500
aerodynamics is a huge issue with this
new truck

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.949
every version of this pickup truck is
gonna get

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:54.309
automatic shutters behind the grill to
help push

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:59.330
air up and around the truck for better
fuel economy but let's be clear

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:03.119
this is a blank piece of paper that they
started with even though there is a

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:03.809
global

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:09.430
Colorado this is a completely different
vehicle in fact the only thing it shares

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.439
is the roof in maybe a half a dozen
balls

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:16.770
throughout the frame this is a brand new
frame front I after suspension

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.680
rear live axle suspension with leaf
springs three different engine options

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.100
that's going to be a first there's a 2.8
liter Duramax turbo-diesel that's

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.720
available

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.160
2.5 liter i-four and also the 3.6 liter

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:35.730
v6 all transmissions will have the
six-speed automatic available

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:38.860
the possibility exists for a manual
transmission

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.550
but they're not telling us which engine
that's going to be a two different

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:43.380
wheelbase is

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.740
to accommodate a crew cab and extended
cab configuration

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.060
two different bed links 5 feet and 6
feet

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.880
depending on that configuration inside
the bad we've got a lot of cool details

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.000
pretty much straight from the 2014
Silverado

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.040
multiple tie-down locations optional

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.280
spray n bed liner also stranded tailgate

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:14.280
and steps with grip holding I don't think
it can be overstated how much better

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:18.129
this new interior is on this new
Colorado

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:22.030
a lot of what you see here does have
some carryover from

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.150
what we've seen in the 2014 Silverado
but

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.340
huge improvement from the mid-size
pickup that this is replacing

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.420
a much better and appropriately sized

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.910
and thickened steering column very cool
gauges that are easy to see almost

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:43.640
a similar to what they have in the
Camaro but a huge center information

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:44.420
part here

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.910
just like in the silverado with a huge
eight-inch screen

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.270
for information and for navigation as
well as some other similar types have

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.910
switches

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.760
that they have in the half-ton as well
in the back seat

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.630
this is the 71 crew cab pretty spacious

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.860
not a huge amount of space but pretty
spacious but what we like

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.030
is a lotta details and thought that went
into

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.450
how functional inflexible these rear
seats are in fact

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:13.569
you can flip up the bottom plenty of
storage underneath

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:19.709
put toe straps tools anything you want
but if you have bigger boxes you wanna

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:20.569
stuff in here

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:24.950
you can flip down the rear seatbacks and
I can step in the big boxes

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:31.190
so there it is that all we know at this
point we're gonna get more information

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:33.900
as we get closer to production which
we're told is going to be

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.780
fall of 2014 at that time will get more

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:42.069
pricing information as well as a
complete set of specs and data

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:45.870
on the truck for everything that we have
up to date right now
