blender<00:00:49.860> and<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.430> vitamix<00:00:50.910> blender<00:00:51.000> face

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
blender and the vitamix blender face

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.049 
blender and the vitamix blender face
they<00:00:52.440> are<00:00:52.500> pretty<00:00:52.890> much<00:00:52.980> on<00:00:53.160> par<00:00:53.219> it<00:00:53.760> seems

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
they are pretty much on par it seems

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.729 
they are pretty much on par it seems
like<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.390> Vitamix<00:00:54.809> is<00:00:54.960> a<00:00:54.989> little<00:00:55.440> bit<00:00:55.559> better

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
like the Vitamix is a little bit better

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.229 
like the Vitamix is a little bit better
because<00:00:56.070> apparently<00:00:56.640> it's<00:00:56.850> a<00:00:56.910> little<00:00:57.149> quieter

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
because apparently it's a little quieter

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.010 
because apparently it's a little quieter
and<00:00:57.750> a<00:00:58.170> quiet<00:00:59.010> blender<00:00:59.430> is<00:00:59.640> a<00:01:00.149> happy<00:01:00.660> blender

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
and a quiet blender is a happy blender

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.020 
and a quiet blender is a happy blender
I'm<00:01:01.230> happy<00:01:01.739> when<00:01:02.010> I'm<00:01:02.039> listening<00:01:02.340> to<00:01:02.579> a<00:01:02.699> quiet

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
I'm happy when I'm listening to a quiet

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.670 
I'm happy when I'm listening to a quiet
blender<00:01:03.449> I<00:01:03.570> thought<00:01:03.750> hey<00:01:04.019> how<00:01:04.229> much<00:01:04.379> did<00:01:04.589> these

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
blender I thought hey how much did these

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.010 
blender I thought hey how much did these
blenders<00:01:05.129> from<00:01:05.369> before<00:01:05.700> and<00:01:05.939> you're<00:01:06.869> looking

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
blenders from before and you're looking

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.640 
blenders from before and you're looking
at<00:01:07.320> about<00:01:07.439> six<00:01:08.189> hundred<00:01:08.280> and<00:01:08.610> fifty<00:01:08.970> dollars

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:09.650 
at about six hundred and fifty dollars

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.100 
at about six hundred and fifty dollars
give<00:01:10.650> or<00:01:10.680> take<00:01:11.010> that's<00:01:11.909> an<00:01:12.180> expensive<00:01:12.720> blender

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
give or take that's an expensive blender

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.020 
give or take that's an expensive blender
but<00:01:13.409> it's<00:01:13.560> a<00:01:13.680> really<00:01:13.890> good<00:01:14.010> one<00:01:14.340> so<00:01:14.729> I<00:01:14.760> can

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
but it's a really good one so I can

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.149 
but it's a really good one so I can
understand<00:01:15.509> why<00:01:15.750> you'd<00:01:16.049> want<00:01:16.229> to<00:01:16.290> pay<00:01:16.470> 650

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
understand why you'd want to pay 650

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.590 
understand why you'd want to pay 650
dollars<00:01:17.610> for<00:01:17.820> a<00:01:17.850> really<00:01:18.150> good<00:01:18.270> blender

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
dollars for a really good blender

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.570 
dollars for a really good blender
because<00:01:18.990> it<00:01:19.200> also<00:01:19.409> does<00:01:19.590> soup<00:01:19.860> stew<00:01:20.280> and

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
because it also does soup stew and

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.990 
because it also does soup stew and
sorbets<00:01:21.390> and<00:01:21.770> I<00:01:22.770> guess<00:01:23.100> you<00:01:23.310> can<00:01:23.430> blend<00:01:23.640> just

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
sorbets and I guess you can blend just

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.270 
sorbets and I guess you can blend just
about<00:01:24.240> anything<00:01:24.509> then<00:01:25.020> I<00:01:25.049> thought<00:01:25.290> hey<00:01:25.350> costco

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
about anything then I thought hey costco

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.910 
about anything then I thought hey costco
might<00:01:27.090> be<00:01:27.270> selling<00:01:27.509> this<00:01:27.810> and<00:01:28.080> if<00:01:28.200> costco<00:01:28.680> is

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
might be selling this and if costco is

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.469 
might be selling this and if costco is
selling<00:01:29.310> this<00:01:29.460> blender<00:01:29.909> it's<00:01:30.119> going<00:01:30.299> to<00:01:30.360> be

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
selling this blender it's going to be

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.870 
selling this blender it's going to be
probably<00:01:31.470> a<00:01:31.590> little<00:01:31.860> bit<00:01:32.040> less<00:01:32.280> so<00:01:32.610> I<00:01:32.640> check

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
probably a little bit less so I check

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.280 
probably a little bit less so I check
out<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:33.090> costco<00:01:33.479> website<00:01:33.840> they're<00:01:34.020> not
