00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:23.900 
so let's do it

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.279 
so let's do it
they<00:00:24.900> also<00:00:25.080> didn't<00:00:25.680> tell<00:00:26.609> me<00:00:26.760> how<00:00:27.140> severe<00:00:28.140> it

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.099 
they also didn't tell me how severe it
was<00:00:28.400> and<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:29.640> possible<00:00:30.090> consequences<00:00:30.779> of<00:00:30.900> not

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
was and the possible consequences of not

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:32.870 
was and the possible consequences of not
going<00:00:31.410> into<00:00:31.590> surgery<00:00:31.769> until<00:00:32.219> after<00:00:32.640> it<00:00:32.730> had

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
going into surgery until after it had

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.490 
going into surgery until after it had
happened<00:00:32.910> maybe<00:00:33.719> I<00:00:33.809> just<00:00:34.050> don't<00:00:34.200> think<00:00:34.469> that

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
happened maybe I just don't think that

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.990 
happened maybe I just don't think that
they<00:00:34.680> wanted<00:00:34.920> to<00:00:35.070> scare<00:00:35.460> me<00:00:36.649> so<00:00:37.649> they<00:00:38.520> sort<00:00:38.850> of

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
they wanted to scare me so they sort of

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.380 
they wanted to scare me so they sort of
gave<00:00:39.270> me<00:00:39.510> information<00:00:39.829> telling<00:00:40.829> me<00:00:41.100> that<00:00:41.399> it

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
gave me information telling me that it

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:43.970 
gave me information telling me that it
was<00:00:42.540> serious<00:00:42.809> and<00:00:43.290> then<00:00:43.440> it<00:00:43.530> needed<00:00:43.710> to<00:00:43.829> be

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
was serious and then it needed to be

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.580 
was serious and then it needed to be
operated<00:00:44.489> on<00:00:44.640> what<00:00:45.390> I<00:00:45.420> later<00:00:45.719> found<00:00:45.809> out<00:00:46.170> if<00:00:46.440> my

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
operated on what I later found out if my

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.290 
operated on what I later found out if my
memory<00:00:46.860> is<00:00:46.980> correct<00:00:47.039> is<00:00:47.460> that<00:00:47.489> had<00:00:47.910> they<00:00:48.090> not

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
memory is correct is that had they not

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.630 
memory is correct is that had they not
treated<00:00:48.809> it<00:00:48.960> it<00:00:49.829> was<00:00:49.920> an<00:00:50.010> infection<00:00:50.250> in<00:00:50.610> the

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
treated it it was an infection in the

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.450 
treated it it was an infection in the
head<00:00:50.910> leading<00:00:51.180> towards<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:51.870> brain<00:00:52.129> so<00:00:53.129> within

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
head leading towards the brain so within

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.240 
head leading towards the brain so within
days<00:00:53.760> or<00:00:54.149> weeks<00:00:54.590> it<00:00:55.590> would<00:00:55.680> start<00:00:55.920> to<00:00:56.070> cause

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
days or weeks it would start to cause

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.760 
days or weeks it would start to cause
brain<00:00:56.460> damage<00:00:57.050> once<00:00:58.050> it<00:00:58.199> reached<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.559> brain

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
brain damage once it reached the brain

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.290 
brain damage once it reached the brain
but<00:00:59.370> they<00:00:59.520> didn't<00:00:59.730> tell<00:00:59.850> me<00:01:00.000> any<00:01:00.149> of<00:01:00.239> that

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
but they didn't tell me any of that

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.000 
but they didn't tell me any of that
until<00:01:00.629> afterwards<00:01:01.230> and<00:01:01.500> what<00:01:01.649> do<00:01:01.710> you<00:01:01.770> think

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
until afterwards and what do you think

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.200

when<00:01:02.129> you<00:01:02.219> hear<00:01:02.430> that<00:01:02.579> kind<00:01:02.760> of<00:01:02.850> thing<00:01:03.059> after

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
when you hear that kind of thing after

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.119 
when you hear that kind of thing after
that<00:01:03.420> scares<00:01:03.809> me<00:01:04.049> because<00:01:04.409> that's<00:01:04.799> where<00:01:05.070> I

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129
