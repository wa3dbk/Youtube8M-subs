brawl I forgot to turn on the quest

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.550 
brawl I forgot to turn on the quest
there<00:00:15.450> so<00:00:15.660> I'm<00:00:15.750> gonna<00:00:15.929> run<00:00:16.170> over<00:00:16.379> to<00:00:16.529> the

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
there so I'm gonna run over to the

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.519 
there so I'm gonna run over to the
little<00:00:17.039> board<00:00:17.220> and<00:00:17.460> activate<00:00:18.300> this<00:00:18.480> quest<00:00:18.840> now

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
little board and activate this quest now

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.410 
little board and activate this quest now
this<00:00:19.710> is<00:00:19.859> just<00:00:20.039> a<00:00:20.250> very<00:00:20.520> short<00:00:20.820> little<00:00:21.060> demo

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
this is just a very short little demo

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:22.880 
this is just a very short little demo
obviously<00:00:21.960> because<00:00:22.230> this<00:00:22.439> quest<00:00:22.710> doesn't

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
obviously because this quest doesn't

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.310 
obviously because this quest doesn't
take<00:00:23.250> but<00:00:23.970> about<00:00:24.150> a<00:00:24.210> minute<00:00:24.570> to<00:00:24.689> complete<00:00:24.840> but

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
take but about a minute to complete but

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.240 
take but about a minute to complete but
I'll<00:00:25.470> go<00:00:25.590> ahead<00:00:25.710> and<00:00:25.980> give<00:00:26.070> you<00:00:26.160> an

I'll go ahead and give you an
illustration<00:00:26.400> of<00:00:26.910> what's<00:00:27.180> going<00:00:27.449> on<00:00:27.630> I'm

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
illustration of what's going on I'm

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.890 
illustration of what's going on I'm
using<00:00:28.710> the<00:00:29.189> trickster<00:00:29.670> calm<00:00:29.910> to<00:00:30.240> boost<00:00:30.510> life

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
using the trickster calm to boost life

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.459 
using the trickster calm to boost life
tap<00:00:31.700> chain<00:00:32.700> reaction<00:00:33.239> and<00:00:33.469> kinetic

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
tap chain reaction and kinetic

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.160 
tap chain reaction and kinetic
reflection<00:00:35.130> and<00:00:35.280> this<00:00:36.000> adds<00:00:36.210> a<00:00:36.420> lot<00:00:36.660> to<00:00:36.719> my

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
reflection and this adds a lot to my

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.260 
reflection and this adds a lot to my
damage<00:00:37.710> because<00:00:38.370> of<00:00:38.610> the<00:00:38.850> chain<00:00:39.120> reaction

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
damage because of the chain reaction

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.470 
damage because of the chain reaction
being<00:00:39.780> boosted<00:00:39.989> to<00:00:40.379> 80%<00:00:41.270> especially<00:00:42.270> in<00:00:42.360> a

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
being boosted to 80% especially in a

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.479 
being boosted to 80% especially in a
small<00:00:42.780> area<00:00:43.020> like<00:00:43.350> this<00:00:43.620> and<00:00:43.860> using<00:00:44.340> the

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
small area like this and using the

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.700 
small area like this and using the
Pimpernel<00:00:45.090> it'll<00:00:45.750> take<00:00:45.930> out<00:00:46.079> not<00:00:46.289> only<00:00:46.320> the

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
Pimpernel it'll take out not only the

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.770 
Pimpernel it'll take out not only the
enemy<00:00:47.039> you<00:00:47.190> phase-lock<00:00:47.730> but<00:00:48.030> almost<00:00:48.450> every

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
enemy you phase-lock but almost every

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.209 
enemy you phase-lock but almost every
enemy<00:00:48.960> near<00:00:49.379> it<00:00:49.500> as<00:00:49.680> well

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
enemy near it as well

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.939 
enemy near it as well
phase-lock<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.329> largest<00:00:52.289> enemy<00:00:52.590> in<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.800> room

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
phase-lock the largest enemy in the room

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.439 
phase-lock the largest enemy in the room
the<00:00:53.129> one<00:00:53.219> with<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.520> most<00:00:53.699> health<00:00:53.969> like<00:00:54.239> I<00:00:54.390> do

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
the one with the most health like I do

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.240 
the one with the most health like I do
now<00:00:54.719> and<00:00:55.050> then<00:00:55.500> just<00:00:55.710> shoot<00:00:55.890> with<00:00:56.129> the

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
now and then just shoot with the

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.950 
now and then just shoot with the
Pimpernel<00:00:56.640> and<00:00:56.879> you'll<00:00:57.000> waste<00:00:57.239> everything

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
Pimpernel and you'll waste everything

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.959 
Pimpernel and you'll waste everything
that<00:00:58.350> got<00:00:58.530> you<00:00:58.890> know<00:00:58.980> close<00:00:59.219> to<00:00:59.460> it<00:00:59.579> like<00:00:59.760> that

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
that got you know close to it like that

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.939 
that got you know close to it like that
because<00:01:00.300> of<00:01:00.329> chain<00:01:00.629> reaction<00:01:01.170> and<00:01:01.649> it<00:01:01.800> works

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
because of chain reaction and it works

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.939 
because of chain reaction and it works
very<00:01:02.039> very<00:01:02.280> well<00:01:02.789> that<00:01:03.660> activates<00:01:04.170> your<00:01:04.619> kill

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
very very well that activates your kill

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.340 
very very well that activates your kill
skill<00:01:05.280> kinetic<00:01:06.210> reflection<00:01:06.780> which<00:01:07.110> works

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
skill kinetic reflection which works

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.350 
skill kinetic reflection which works
great<00:01:07.470> with<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:07.950> antagonists<00:01:08.610> to<00:01:08.760> basically

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
great with the antagonists to basically

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.480 
great with the antagonists to basically
reflect<00:01:09.810> all<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.110> bullets<00:01:10.439> and<00:01:10.680> keep<00:01:11.369> you

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
reflect all the bullets and keep you

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.330 
reflect all the bullets and keep you
very<00:01:11.640> protected<00:01:12.240> from<00:01:12.390> gunfire<00:01:13.340> also

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
very protected from gunfire also

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.030 
very protected from gunfire also
activated<00:01:14.939> is<00:01:15.090> like<00:01:15.390> tap<00:01:15.689> which<00:01:16.140> I<00:01:16.439> only<00:01:16.740> put

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
activated is like tap which I only put

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.859 
activated is like tap which I only put
one<00:01:17.250> point<00:01:17.520> in<00:01:17.700> in<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.030> actual<00:01:18.390> skill<00:01:18.659> build

one point in in the actual skill build

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.260 
one point in in the actual skill build
but<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.200> column<00:01:19.530> boosts<00:01:19.710> to<00:01:19.740> five<00:01:20.270> points

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
but the column boosts to five points

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.120 
but the column boosts to five points
total<00:01:21.420> in<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.840> skill<00:01:22.080> and<00:01:22.290> because<00:01:22.950> we're

total in the skill and because we're

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.770 
total in the skill and because we're
doing<00:01:23.310> more<00:01:23.490> damage<00:01:23.850> than<00:01:24.000> we<00:01:24.150> have<00:01:24.270> health<00:01:24.540> at

over power level eight that particular
skill<00:01:26.909> will<00:01:27.119> keep<00:01:27.299> us<00:01:27.509> above<00:01:28.200> health<00:01:28.409> gate

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
skill will keep us above health gate

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.109 
skill will keep us above health gate
most<00:01:28.860> of<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.040> time<00:01:29.250> so<00:01:29.490> long<00:01:29.640> as<00:01:29.820> we<00:01:29.939> keep

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
most of the time so long as we keep

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.539 
most of the time so long as we keep

firing and have recently had a kill and
that's<00:01:32.880> really<00:01:33.180> really<00:01:33.360> cool<00:01:33.770> again<00:01:34.770> here

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
that's really really cool again here
