possible<00:03:38.590> thing<00:03:39.590> about<00:03:39.830> loose<00:03:40.100> two<00:03:40.430> strand

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
possible thing about loose two strand

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.140 
possible thing about loose two strand
twists<00:03:41.180> is<00:03:41.330> they<00:03:41.989> are<00:03:42.140> so<00:03:42.440> easy<00:03:42.799> many<00:03:43.730> twists

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
twists is they are so easy many twists

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.300 
twists is they are so easy many twists
take<00:03:44.390> I<00:03:44.690> don't<00:03:45.110> know<00:03:45.380> two<00:03:45.860> or<00:03:45.980> three<00:03:46.130> minutes

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
take I don't know two or three minutes

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:49.420 
take I don't know two or three minutes
for<00:03:47.150> each<00:03:47.269> twist<00:03:47.690> this<00:03:48.470> takes<00:03:48.830> like<00:03:49.040> 30

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
for each twist this takes like 30

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.850 
for each twist this takes like 30
seconds<00:03:50.120> per<00:03:50.720> twist<00:03:51.049> and<00:03:51.380> there

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:51.860 
seconds per twist and there

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:54.070 
seconds per twist and there
bigger<00:03:52.040> than<00:03:52.880> many<00:03:53.180> twists<00:03:53.540> so<00:03:53.780> you<00:03:53.840> get<00:03:54.050> a

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:54.080 
bigger than many twists so you get a

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:56.800 
bigger than many twists so you get a
really<00:03:54.440> different<00:03:54.800> look<00:03:55.160> it<00:03:55.970> is<00:03:56.120> so<00:03:56.480> much

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
really different look it is so much

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:00.460 
really different look it is so much
easier<00:03:57.230> and<00:03:58.720> here's<00:03:59.720> just<00:03:59.930> a<00:04:00.020> beautiful<00:04:00.410> in

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:00.470 
easier and here's just a beautiful in

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:03.580 
easier and here's just a beautiful in
the<00:04:00.530> back<00:04:00.680> I<00:04:01.040> try<00:04:01.970> to<00:04:02.030> twist<00:04:02.990> some<00:04:03.260> in<00:04:03.500> the

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
the back I try to twist some in the

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:05.170 
the back I try to twist some in the
middle<00:04:03.950> so<00:04:04.130> that<00:04:04.160> I<00:04:04.340> don't<00:04:04.400> end<00:04:04.700> up<00:04:04.850> with<00:04:04.940> the

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:05.180 
middle so that I don't end up with the

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:06.850 
middle so that I don't end up with the
Defiant<00:04:05.690> part<00:04:05.960> going<00:04:06.200> down<00:04:06.350> the<00:04:06.470> middle<00:04:06.680> of<00:04:06.770> my

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
head sometimes that can be tricky when

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.410 
head sometimes that can be tricky when
you<00:04:09.770> do<00:04:09.980> a<00:04:10.010> loose<00:04:10.250> two<00:04:10.490> strand<00:04:10.820> twist<00:04:11.090> you<00:04:11.270> want

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000 
to start tight at the root and then

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.220 
to start tight at the root and then
really<00:04:14.390> relaxed<00:04:15.010> and<00:04:16.010> take<00:04:16.340> the<00:04:16.549> twist<00:04:16.910> in

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:17.230 
really relaxed and take the twist in

really relaxed and take the twist in
huge<00:04:18.230> huge<00:04:19.010> pieces<00:04:19.820> and<00:04:20.630> you<00:04:20.810> just<00:04:21.019> travel

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:21.350 
huge huge pieces and you just travel

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:24.610 
huge huge pieces and you just travel
down<00:04:21.500> the<00:04:21.620> hair<00:04:21.799> so<00:04:22.070> fast<00:04:23.200> okay<00:04:24.200> here's<00:04:24.470> my

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:29.940 
down the hair so fast okay here's my
second<00:04:25.130> really<00:04:25.430> defined<00:04:25.820> part

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:29.950 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:40.860 

and<00:04:30.580> I'm<00:04:30.700> just<00:04:30.820> gonna<00:04:31.030> keep<00:04:31.240> listing

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:40.870 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:43.120 

now<00:04:41.870> one<00:04:42.139> thing<00:04:42.320> I<00:04:42.440> didn't<00:04:42.710> get<00:04:42.770> to<00:04:42.889> show<00:04:43.100> you

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:43.130 
now one thing I didn't get to show you

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:45.430 
now one thing I didn't get to show you
on<00:04:43.460> the<00:04:43.580> other<00:04:43.759> twists<00:04:44.419> is<00:04:44.600> what<00:04:44.960> you<00:04:45.110> use<00:04:45.259> the

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:45.440 
on the other twists is what you use the

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.680 
on the other twists is what you use the
water<00:04:45.620> for<00:04:45.979> I<00:04:46.310> just<00:04:46.699> do<00:04:46.790> a<00:04:46.820> quick<00:04:47.180> spritz<00:04:47.509> of

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:47.690 
water for I just do a quick spritz of

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:50.260 
water for I just do a quick spritz of
water<00:04:47.870> on<00:04:48.110> the<00:04:48.259> end<00:04:48.590> of<00:04:48.860> the<00:04:49.070> twist<00:04:49.370> because

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:50.270 
water on the end of the twist because

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:52.390 
water on the end of the twist because
you're<00:04:50.630> really<00:04:50.840> loose<00:04:51.259> in<00:04:51.560> the<00:04:51.650> middle<00:04:52.009> but

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.400 
you're really loose in the middle but

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.010 
you're really loose in the middle but
then<00:04:52.550> you<00:04:52.669> start<00:04:52.880> to<00:04:53.000> tighten<00:04:53.419> up<00:04:53.539> the<00:04:53.600> twist

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:54.020 
then you start to tighten up the twist

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:56.469 
then you start to tighten up the twist
at<00:04:54.259> the<00:04:54.320> end<00:04:54.500> and<00:04:55.100> twirl<00:04:55.910> it<00:04:55.940> around<00:04:56.120> your

00:04:56.469 --> 00:04:56.479 
at the end and twirl it around your

00:04:56.479 --> 00:04:58.510 
at the end and twirl it around your
finger<00:04:56.870> so<00:04:57.020> that<00:04:57.169> it'll<00:04:57.289> stay<00:04:57.680> and<00:04:57.979> if<00:04:58.340> it's

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:58.520 
finger so that it'll stay and if it's

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.279 
finger so that it'll stay and if it's
just<00:04:58.669> a<00:04:58.759> little<00:04:59.000> damp<00:04:59.210> before<00:04:59.570> your<00:04:59.720> twirl

00:05:00.279 --> 00:05:00.289 
just a little damp before your twirl

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:03.360 
just a little damp before your twirl
it<00:05:00.650> really<00:05:00.889> helps<00:05:01.250> the<00:05:01.370> ends<00:05:01.759> to<00:05:01.910> set<00:05:02.120> in<00:05:02.240> place

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:03.370 
it really helps the ends to set in place

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:05.409 
it really helps the ends to set in place
now<00:05:04.370> what<00:05:04.550> you'll<00:05:04.729> see<00:05:04.880> in<00:05:04.970> the<00:05:05.030> next<00:05:05.270> couple

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:05.419 
now what you'll see in the next couple

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:07.990 
now what you'll see in the next couple
of<00:05:05.570> seconds<00:05:05.990> is<00:05:06.139> me<00:05:06.380> creating<00:05:06.949> the<00:05:07.460> other<00:05:07.699> two

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:08.000 
of seconds is me creating the other two

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.499 
of seconds is me creating the other two
really<00:05:08.389> defined<00:05:08.750> parts<00:05:09.350> I<00:05:10.000> use<00:05:11.000> the<00:05:11.180> parts

00:05:11.499 --> 00:05:11.509 
really defined parts I use the parts

00:05:11.509 --> 00:05:13.510 
really defined parts I use the parts
again<00:05:11.780> because<00:05:12.020> I<00:05:12.110> want<00:05:12.289> styling<00:05:12.830> options<00:05:13.010> I

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:13.520 
again because I want styling options I

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.879 
again because I want styling options I
have<00:05:13.820> to<00:05:13.970> say<00:05:14.150> I<00:05:14.449> really<00:05:15.020> like<00:05:15.350> installing

00:05:15.879 --> 00:05:15.889 
have to say I really like installing

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:17.730 
have to say I really like installing
these<00:05:16.250> they<00:05:16.550> only<00:05:16.699> took<00:05:16.970> about<00:05:17.090> an<00:05:17.389> hour

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:17.740 
these they only took about an hour

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:20.469 
these they only took about an hour
versus<00:05:18.740> many<00:05:18.979> twists<00:05:19.400> that<00:05:19.490> take<00:05:19.699> about<00:05:19.820> six

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:20.479 
versus many twists that take about six

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:22.659 
versus many twists that take about six
although<00:05:20.990> these<00:05:21.199> don't<00:05:21.500> last<00:05:21.830> nearly<00:05:22.400> as<00:05:22.550> long

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:22.669 
although these don't last nearly as long

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:25.540 
although these don't last nearly as long
as<00:05:23.030> many<00:05:23.240> twists<00:05:23.600> but<00:05:23.919> I'm<00:05:24.919> really<00:05:25.160> feeling

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:25.550 
as many twists but I'm really feeling

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:33.550 
as many twists but I'm really feeling
this<00:05:25.669> style<00:05:29.889> these<00:05:30.889> are<00:05:31.340> my<00:05:32.090> loose<00:05:32.389> two<00:05:33.229> strand

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:33.560 
this style these are my loose two strand

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:38.900 
this style these are my loose two strand
twists<00:05:36.789> whew

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:38.910 
twists whew

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:43.520

big big shout out so we should change
music<00:05:58.680> for<00:05:59.190> the<00:05:59.280> idea<00:06:00.320> because<00:06:01.320> I<00:06:01.440> like<00:06:01.650> these

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:01.890 
music for the idea because I like these

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:04.490 
music for the idea because I like these
I<00:06:02.340> like<00:06:02.730> the<00:06:02.940> sort<00:06:03.180> of<00:06:03.240> dreaded<00:06:03.750> quality<00:06:04.320> that

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:04.500 
I like the sort of dreaded quality that

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:07.550 
I like the sort of dreaded quality that
they<00:06:04.680> have<00:06:05.300> and<00:06:06.300> one<00:06:06.570> that<00:06:06.780> I'm<00:06:06.900> really<00:06:06.930> did

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:07.560 
they have and one that I'm really did

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:09.500 
they have and one that I'm really did
loosely<00:06:08.040> so<00:06:08.430> I'm<00:06:08.760> looking<00:06:09.090> at<00:06:09.240> and<00:06:09.390> they're

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:09.510 
loosely so I'm looking at and they're

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:13.160 
loosely so I'm looking at and they're
not<00:06:09.690> really<00:06:10.110> loose<00:06:11.000> enough<00:06:12.000> and<00:06:12.630> then<00:06:12.810> others

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:13.170 
not really loose enough and then others

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:16.720 
not really loose enough and then others
look<00:06:13.470> like<00:06:13.920> great<00:06:14.720> they're<00:06:15.720> exactly<00:06:16.290> the

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:16.730 
look like great they're exactly the

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:19.250 
look like great they're exactly the
texture<00:06:17.730> I<00:06:17.760> was<00:06:17.970> going<00:06:18.180> for<00:06:18.420> so<00:06:18.660> with<00:06:18.840> practice

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:19.260 
texture I was going for so with practice

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:22.880 
texture I was going for so with practice
I<00:06:19.380> think<00:06:19.440> I'll<00:06:19.740> do<00:06:19.860> a<00:06:19.890> better<00:06:20.130> job<00:06:20.220> with<00:06:20.430> these
