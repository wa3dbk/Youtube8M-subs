00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
of the lid right up against the eye lash

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.970 
of the lid right up against the eye lash
line<00:00:50.270> you<00:00:51.270> take<00:00:51.539> that<00:00:51.750> and<00:00:52.230> then<00:00:52.379> just<00:00:52.559> lightly

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
line you take that and then just lightly

00:01:02.259 --> 00:01:02.269 
and blend it outward as well you don't

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:04.020 
and blend it outward as well you don't
want<00:01:02.390> to<00:01:02.480> use<00:01:02.629> too<00:01:02.960> much<00:01:03.140> of<00:01:03.350> it<00:01:03.440> to<00:01:03.620> start

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:04.030 
want to use too much of it to start

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:09.700 
want to use too much of it to start
because<00:01:05.030> it's<00:01:05.269> easier<00:01:06.340> to<00:01:07.340> add<00:01:07.520> more<00:01:08.560> than<00:01:09.560> to

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 
because it's easier to add more than to

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.180 
because it's easier to add more than to
take<00:01:09.920> away<00:01:10.190> too<00:01:10.250> much<00:01:10.520> access<00:01:11.860> now<00:01:12.860> since<00:01:13.100> this

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:13.190 
take away too much access now since this

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:15.370 
take away too much access now since this
is<00:01:13.369> just<00:01:13.399> a<00:01:13.700> base<00:01:13.909> it's<00:01:14.659> okay<00:01:14.899> if<00:01:14.990> it<00:01:15.110> doesn't

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
blend that as well this is going to

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:54.670 
blend that as well this is going to
create<00:01:46.759> your<00:01:46.940> nice<00:01:47.319> puffy<00:01:48.319> black<00:01:48.800> eye

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:54.680 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.050 

just<00:01:55.340> keep<00:01:55.550> adding<00:01:56.000> more<00:01:56.420> and<00:01:56.690> blending<00:01:57.590> in

because<00:02:00.950> that<00:02:01.340> it'll<00:02:01.640> defeat<00:02:02.360> the<00:02:02.510> purpose<00:02:02.660> of

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
because that it'll defeat the purpose of

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.630
