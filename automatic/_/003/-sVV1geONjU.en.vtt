00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:26.150 
longer one i'm just going to rearrange

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:29.700 
longer one i'm just going to rearrange
it<00:05:26.419> a<00:05:26.599> couple<00:05:27.560> here<00:05:27.830> just<00:05:28.009> to<00:05:28.069> make<00:05:28.220> a<00:05:28.250> point<00:05:28.659> of

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:29.710 
it a couple here just to make a point of

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:33.129 
it a couple here just to make a point of
course<00:05:30.710> we<00:05:30.830> have<00:05:30.979> the<00:05:31.009> ability<00:05:31.340> to<00:05:32.139> resize

00:05:33.129 --> 00:05:33.139 
course we have the ability to resize

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:35.050 
course we have the ability to resize
which<00:05:33.470> is<00:05:33.590> just<00:05:33.740> like<00:05:33.919> we<00:05:34.039> have<00:05:34.250> had<00:05:34.580> for<00:05:34.610> some

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:35.060 
which is just like we have had for some

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:38.909 
which is just like we have had for some
time<00:05:35.349> but<00:05:36.349> i'm<00:05:36.470> also<00:05:36.620> going<00:05:36.830> to<00:05:36.919> show<00:05:37.099> you<00:05:37.159> that

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:38.919 
time but i'm also going to show you that

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:42.219 
time but i'm also going to show you that
it<00:05:39.919> will<00:05:40.039> resize<00:05:40.490> dynamically<00:05:41.150> and<00:05:41.419> rearrange

00:05:42.219 --> 00:05:42.229 
it will resize dynamically and rearrange

00:05:42.229 --> 00:05:44.710 
it will resize dynamically and rearrange
things<00:05:42.440> to<00:05:43.430> make<00:05:43.550> it<00:05:43.729> fit<00:05:43.970> how<00:05:44.180> does<00:05:44.330> help<00:05:44.509> move

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:44.720 
things to make it fit how does help move

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.990 
things to make it fit how does help move
to<00:05:44.900> those<00:05:45.110> icons<00:05:45.919> and<00:05:46.220> it's<00:05:46.370> still<00:05:46.520> too<00:05:46.699> big<00:05:46.909> to

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:47.000 
to those icons and it's still too big to

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.309 
to those icons and it's still too big to
fit<00:05:47.090> in<00:05:47.210> there<00:05:47.360> but<00:05:47.479> when<00:05:47.569> I<00:05:47.630> let<00:05:47.780> go<00:05:47.810> it

00:05:48.309 --> 00:05:48.319 
fit in there but when I let go it

00:05:48.319 --> 00:05:49.779 
fit in there but when I let go it
automatically<00:05:48.830> shrinks<00:05:49.159> it<00:05:49.280> of<00:05:49.460> course<00:05:49.699> that

00:05:49.779 --> 00:05:49.789 
automatically shrinks it of course that

00:05:49.789 --> 00:05:51.249 
automatically shrinks it of course that
only<00:05:49.880> works<00:05:50.180> if<00:05:50.360> the<00:05:50.389> widget<00:05:50.690> is<00:05:50.780> capable<00:05:51.199> of

00:05:51.249 --> 00:05:51.259 
only works if the widget is capable of

00:05:51.259 --> 00:05:52.600 
only works if the widget is capable of
shirking<00:05:51.470> down<00:05:51.710> to<00:05:51.800> a<00:05:51.860> size<00:05:52.099> that<00:05:52.130> actually

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:52.610 
shirking down to a size that actually

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:56.040 
shirking down to a size that actually
fits<00:05:52.849> but<00:05:53.060> when<00:05:53.479> it<00:05:53.569> does<00:05:53.740> it's<00:05:54.740> quite<00:05:54.919> handy

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:56.050 
fits but when it does it's quite handy

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:58.180 
fits but when it does it's quite handy
as<00:05:57.050> you<00:05:57.259> would<00:05:57.380> expect<00:05:57.469> there's<00:05:57.889> a<00:05:57.949> good

as you would expect there's a good
folder<00:05:58.520> support<00:05:58.909> it's<00:05:59.630> very<00:05:59.750> easy<00:05:59.960> to<00:06:00.050> create

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:00.320
