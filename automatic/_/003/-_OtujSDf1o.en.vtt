00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.100
 [musics] 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.490
 ale 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.240
 hey 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:59.349
 [applause] 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.349
 [musics] 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:03.690
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.690
 Ah ha ha 

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:11.260

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:20.240
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:23.430
 [musics] 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:29.560
 Well then this product 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:31.290
 Kedomo it's a revolutionary as say please tell me what kind of thing the is itself 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:35.250
 It is a guitar amplifier 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:37.800
 The magnitude of this much go out hard in the two who came in magnitude 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:41.070
 By the way, you just connect the this speaker 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:43.840
 This small I do not exist at all because up 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:49.570
 Because this is up 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:52.550
 Masaki synchronizes or shrinks, but this is impossible, so this is a switch 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:56.720
 This is non-malt bright 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:02:01.640
 It only Huh I do not Yesterday Kedomo I know this amp 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:06.790
 In Well this is connects say Toka echo or the love of distortion the Tsuttsu 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:08.770
 Say another fully functional as well as an amplifier is perfect if you can 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:11.230
 Again the result say 10 t 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:16.840
 This is another really innovative Sakura 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:19.460
 What softening version push by people of guitar list have is I'd think the texture Toka which some people often 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:23.780
 Or sound become a character of any feeling of amplifier 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:26.720
 From pretty rough It is Well now listen to me was entranced move clean 3 parts 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:32.000
 He is really big until distortion 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:36.950
 This Andake also taken a large size in to wo of Seitz or really this is at that size 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:39.480
 And so Yaro amazing I'm convenient by, for example, that NiÃ±o and to 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.090
 Break through with this one 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.590
 Huh 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:46.850
 Because it may be enough 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:49.410
 That's a very useful item like that 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:53.040
 By the way, call or would do such How much one ask 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:56.910
 This is supposed to be it 22,000 yen is a tax 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:58.890
 But I think that I can not buy Do not quite asleep'm such a price 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:01.520
 Is it one you like 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.520
 I'm in
