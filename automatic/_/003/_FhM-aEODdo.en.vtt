00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.509
 It's Eduard Baptist and we're here. 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:09.719
 Interactive sport we have is tranquility 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:12.450
 to play on this theme because I 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:15.150
 example I should be the commentator 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.890
 that does not work in the press of 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.690
 Pernambuco who most saw the sport play 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.500
 in this year 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:22.800
 I'm probably the guy that's most 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:27.599
 wines can play without their working 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:29.429
 or in the newspaper on a pernambuco radio and 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.260
 Eduard Baptist posture I am 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.690
 realizing she might change a little 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.880
 it was a totally quiet face all 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:40.200
 is already getting a guy very plundered 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.850
 for example the previous victory of the 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.590
 sport now I do not remember who 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.539
 was the production can take a look 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.399
 the chosen sport reached the fifth 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.860
 place or remained in fifth place at 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.660
 answer is positive was I think it is already 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.610
 when it comes to respecting sporting 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.530
 I think the staff will detect the player 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.170
 that is here have quality everyone 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.910
 says respect in fifth place saying 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.500
 All he criticizes is saying that I 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.000
 I think he's right in that sense but 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.979
 was already an explosive thing when the 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.960
 athletic miner I think it was 1 to 0 not 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.720
 this was what was 2 to 1 on the island of retreat 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.180
 the withdrawal zone, so it was 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.369
 basic sister is a response in a tone that 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.259
 we have not seen eduardo now has the 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.369
 own response today and that they were already 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.710
 so different 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.229
 I will raise the torch followed more but 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.820
 the defensive exactly I do not know if a 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.009
 thing has to do with the after that 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.650
 response from the newspaper staff who 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.540
 Respected, I agree, and more than 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.860
 that nobody here the bosses 2015 the people 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.810
 It's been a long time since we talked about cearÃ¡. 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.170
 talk about sport 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:40.140
 but the change of gift people see that 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.939
 suddenly he is charging more or if he 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.040
 he is feeling more pressure than 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:46.409
 From there to here he took paulo figueirense 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.500
 today lost to Flemish 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:51.630
 I'm feeling the change and I'm not in the mood. 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.659
 I know if it could be that it has nothing to do 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.520
 you can see a difference in defeat 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.740
 It is also patience but then but this 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.610
 explosion happened in victory in exchange 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.610
 happened the victory
