foundation<00:00:32.399> is<00:00:32.820> graded<00:00:33.450> evening<00:00:33.899> out<00:00:34.079> the

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
foundation is graded evening out the

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.770 
foundation is graded evening out the
skin<00:00:34.559> tone<00:00:34.850> so<00:00:35.850> if<00:00:35.940> you've<00:00:36.059> got<00:00:36.239> like<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.540> fuse

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
skin tone so if you've got like the fuse

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.930 
skin tone so if you've got like the fuse
retinas<00:00:37.260> like<00:00:37.590> I<00:00:37.770> do<00:00:37.829> or<00:00:38.480> got<00:00:39.480> some<00:00:39.750> scarring

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:40.940 
retinas like I do or got some scarring

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.049 
retinas like I do or got some scarring
or<00:00:41.940> discoloration<00:00:42.809> it<00:00:42.989> will<00:00:43.200> correct<00:00:43.590> that<00:00:44.059> so

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
or discoloration it will correct that so

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.880 
or discoloration it will correct that so
probably<00:00:45.360> it's<00:00:45.629> designed<00:00:46.079> to<00:00:46.320> actually<00:00:46.440> do

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
probably it's designed to actually do

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.490 
probably it's designed to actually do
that<00:00:47.329> most<00:00:48.329> our<00:00:48.480> nation's<00:00:48.870> though<00:00:49.050> are<00:00:49.260> not

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
that most our nation's though are not

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.660 
that most our nation's though are not
really<00:00:49.680> good<00:00:49.920> at<00:00:50.039> improving<00:00:50.399> skin<00:00:50.760> texture<00:00:51.210> so
