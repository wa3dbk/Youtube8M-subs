00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.460
No fantasy game would be complete without
spells and incantations for the player wield.

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.310
The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim is no exception,
and it has a list of magics and spells with

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:33.340
various types of uses, including one of the
basics, healing spells.

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.730
The school of restoration is the only one
that will always appeal to each play style

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:39.620
no matter what.

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.520
After all healing and staying alive is the
first, and most important thing everyone does

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.010
during combat.

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:51.050
As you heal, shield, and repel undead though
you'll need to upgrade your spells, and likely

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.770
be interested in finding the best restoration
magic in the game.

00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:00.480
A word of warning though, the best restoration
spells, as odd as it may seem, have next to

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.420
nothing to do with healing.

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.520
Like the other four schools of magic, you
must complete a special quest to unlock the

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.670
master restoration spells.

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:14.680
To start the Restoration Ritual Spell quest
you first need a restoration skill of at least

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:15.750
ninety.

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.780
Obviously reaching this level of proficiency
can take some time, but once you do so you

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.740
need to head to the college of Winterhold.

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.360
Once there you need to find and speak with
Colette Marence about learning more about

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:33.170
restoration.

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.661
After talking to her she will redirect you
to the Auger of Dunlain who resides in the

00:01:37.661 --> 00:01:39.590
Midden beneath the college.

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.240
Before you can do this though there's a catch.

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.939
You have to have completed the mages guild
quest "Good Intentions", which has you summoning

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:49.200
the Auger for different purposes.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.450
It's impossible to talk to him otherwise,
and even then it's possible that you may not

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:03.940
beable to speak with him again until after
you complete the college quests.

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:10.200
Anyways once you Speak with the Auger of Dunlain
he will tell you to step into the light for

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.830
a test.

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:20.390
When you do so all of your equipment will
be removed, and you will be attacked by three

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:21.650
ghosts.

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.980
You can't attack or fight back, because the
purpose of this test is simply to survive

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.640
using restoration spells.

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:33.600
You can heal, repel the undead, or use wards
to keep yourself alive while the test proceeds.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.109
It's also possible to use the become ethereal
shout to get through much of the trial as

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:39.109
well.

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:43.080
No matter how you go about staying alive,
once the test is complete you'll get all of

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.740
your items back, and the Drauger will also
give you the Master Restoration spell "Bane

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:49.079
of the Undead".

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:53.890
In addition, if you return to Colette Marence
she will now sell the other Master Restoration

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.050
Spell, Guardian Circle.

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:59.549
There is a tiny bug worth mentioning though.

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:03.639
Occasionally Colette will not sell the Guardian
Circle spell.

00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:09.260
In order to fix this Speak with the auger
again and when he begins saying "you are worthy"

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.519
start clicking him over and over to skip the
dialogue.

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:26.919
It's not clear why, but doing this will usually
get the spell to appear in Colett's inventory.

00:03:26.919 --> 00:03:31.320
Restoration magic is a bit short on master
spells with only two available, but that doens't

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:32.950
mean they're short on power.

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:36.720
If you still need convincing, then listen
to what the master spells do.

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.220
The first is Bane of the undead, which is
the most powerful spell that forces undead

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:42.290
enemies to flee.

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:45.810
However, this spell has a host of additional
effects.

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:50.420
All undead up to level thirty will flee for
thirty seconds when hit with this spell, but

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:53.750
they will also be staggered, and set on fire.

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:57.140
Pretty powerful compared to the preceding
similar spells right?

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:00.390
The second spell is Guardian Circle.

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:05.190
Similar to the circle of Protection spell,
the guardian circle is much more powerful.

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.230
After being placed on the ground it lasts
for sixty seconds.

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:13.360
Any undead up to level thirty-five that enters
it will flee, and as long as you stay within

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:25.930
it's confines, you will recover twenty points
of health every second.

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:31.710
No matter the class you play, or the techniques
you use restoration magic will always be useful.

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:36.780
Even though the Mater spells for restoration
lave limited use for some types of play styles,

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.070
they're still valuable and powerful.

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:48.200
No matter if the top tier of this magic school
interests you or not, thanks for watching.

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:52.530
