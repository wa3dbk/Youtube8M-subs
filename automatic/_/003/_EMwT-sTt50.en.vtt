00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.540
 anf 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:33.140
 Buber or say the future of the moving image 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:36.160
 I do not want to check 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:38.700
 I think so I would like to introduce it here 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.700
 I agree 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:53.120
 Booboo This is still bose justice 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:57.540
 It is good at it I I became Beuve station e series looper 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:01:03.270
 Booburn memory function 2 saying to put this on 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:06.120
 There you can make some loopers with that clock, so make it 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:10.800
 I'm going to switch the big 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:15.720
 It is this Twitter of Ikeru to switch as soon as connected 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:16.840
 Such air-fuel say that is switched to smooth it later during a performance if you put in Ajimoto 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.799
 Hmm 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:25.840
 In're nibbling this 2 is said because most of the elaborate if this Sasoe 

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:29.579
 If you want to go to b 1 and Shinada Police s pizza, go from 2nd to 1st 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.579
 Also Dondo is that there is good 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:52.830
 Boo s so se 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:57.210
 Source line smoothly go now just shoes 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:59.190
 I and wo, who heard switched with nature is such 裂蹄 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:04.100
 Mother's party 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:04.100
 Of course I have to do anything with this b- barby nail 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:10.369
 I will 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.369
 I can hardly find it 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:35.210
 bouvet I will use it like this 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:38.900
 Even though it's a point of time to make the 10-flops doing this by using sleep this a 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:43.760
 You can also express a song with an expansion like Melo pb 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:48.710
 It is possible to make sound changes that are somewhat difficult in the supermarket, but that 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:52.880
 Yes a little stop there is a point when you make dismissed 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:55.880
 So because the stop sound please try to hear one more time 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:59.390
 Kedomo The first I that say so is Firui yes 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:04.430
 go into the fill in the first to put a lifetime and description 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:08.730
 Also made from the onset description but is large'm originated theory today 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:12.720
 I'm going to port Nogamega and go smoothly into the first measure 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:18.810
 Leverage intends to front collision due to be deployed from a phrase like being 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:24.269
 Beku mass tick Yes This only heard that if all the time costumes snow that loop is the same also for 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:28.720
 I think that if put to even those who think I what do not you, but this is coming to connect with that rust 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:32.440
 And he said that from a rusty explanation 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:35.560
 This is a feeling of excitement, but an environment of excitement 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:40.750
 I can't do it well I'm heading for the rust 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:48.710
 Because it can do how to count well in such a kind, it does not develop in the period and from the eyes 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:54.200
 The liveliness of the sitting and smooth rise when making from the origin explanation of the looping part 

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:56.760
 I think, but these I come and I wonder if easy to think of course and wonder if there are exceptions to 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:04:04.430
 Make points alive and reference a 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:04.430
 I think that I want to do an end by taking a simple ad lib by using this last 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.330
 Was Mashi Tsurigaki the foot 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:15.030
 car 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:17.060

 Let's report dj 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:11.439
 wh

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:19.509
 aname 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:25.060
 Becomes see you even when the Pisces how to say I Ikeru dancing 

00:05:19.509 --> 00:05:26.650
 The kana representation of the loop is limited to Do I think it is because of the large pos looper or can 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:30.150
 I think 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:33.950
 Please try it for reference 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:33.950
 Thank you for all this time
