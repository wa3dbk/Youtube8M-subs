some faith in the Creative Assembly as

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:14.690 
some faith in the Creative Assembly as
developers<00:00:13.950> it<00:00:14.160> shows<00:00:14.370> that<00:00:14.549> they're

developers it shows that they're

not managed to address the worst of the

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.679 
not managed to address the worst of the
issues<00:00:20.039> I'm<00:00:20.189> afraid<00:00:20.460> the<00:00:20.939> computer<00:00:21.330> AI<00:00:21.480> is

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
issues I'm afraid the computer AI is

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.800 
issues I'm afraid the computer AI is
still<00:00:22.289> very<00:00:23.070> obviously<00:00:23.580> the<00:00:23.939> game's<00:00:24.119> downfall

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
still very obviously the game's downfall

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.480 
still very obviously the game's downfall
even<00:00:25.109> now<00:00:25.260> and<00:00:25.500> I'm<00:00:25.800> gonna<00:00:25.920> run<00:00:26.099> through<00:00:26.220> a<00:00:26.310> few

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
even now and I'm gonna run through a few

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.910 
even now and I'm gonna run through a few
examples<00:00:26.630> few<00:00:27.630> pretty<00:00:27.779> damning<00:00:28.199> examples<00:00:28.710> of

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
examples few pretty damning examples of

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.310 
examples few pretty damning examples of
why<00:00:29.609> that<00:00:29.820> is<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.060> case<00:00:30.090> starting<00:00:31.019> off<00:00:31.109> with

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
why that is the case starting off with

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.229 
why that is the case starting off with
the<00:00:31.500> battles<00:00:31.830> themselves<00:00:32.009> now<00:00:32.940> if<00:00:33.149> you

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
the battles themselves now if you

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:34.670 
the battles themselves now if you
approach<00:00:33.450> these<00:00:33.719> battles<00:00:34.050> as<00:00:34.200> if<00:00:34.469> Roman

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
approach these battles as if Roman

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.650 
approach these battles as if Roman
general<00:00:35.070> volt<00:00:35.309> or<00:00:35.640> at<00:00:35.760> least<00:00:35.910> one<00:00:36.480> of<00:00:36.570> the

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
general volt or at least one of the

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.360 
general volt or at least one of the
boring<00:00:37.020> ones<00:00:37.230> anyway<00:00:37.620> you<00:00:38.070> can<00:00:38.219> probably

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
boring ones anyway you can probably

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.610 
boring ones anyway you can probably
avoid<00:00:38.820> a<00:00:39.090> lot<00:00:39.390> of<00:00:39.420> these<00:00:39.780> faults<00:00:40.140> so<00:00:40.500> that

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
avoid a lot of these faults so that

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.860 
avoid a lot of these faults so that
means<00:00:40.770> you<00:00:41.070> know<00:00:41.190> you'll<00:00:41.460> have<00:00:42.120> your<00:00:42.390> troops

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
means you know you'll have your troops

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.020 
means you know you'll have your troops
lined<00:00:43.110> in<00:00:43.260> a<00:00:43.320> nice<00:00:43.500> neat<00:00:43.739> formation<00:00:44.309> infantry

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
lined in a nice neat formation infantry

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.450 
lined in a nice neat formation infantry
in<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.180> center<00:00:45.510> at<00:00:45.719> a<00:00:45.780> walking<00:00:46.230> pace

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:46.460 
in the center at a walking pace

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.040 
in the center at a walking pace
skirmishes<00:00:47.460> just<00:00:47.700> ahead<00:00:48.000> have<00:00:48.690> already<00:00:48.989> on

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
skirmishes just ahead have already on

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.439 
skirmishes just ahead have already on
the<00:00:49.140> flanks<00:00:49.850> essentially<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:50.969> exact<00:00:51.270> same

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
the flanks essentially the exact same

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.600 
the flanks essentially the exact same
formation<00:00:51.780> that<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.230> enemy<00:00:52.620> AI<00:00:52.920> is<00:00:53.100> probably

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
formation that the enemy AI is probably

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.459 
formation that the enemy AI is probably
using<00:00:53.940> against<00:00:54.210> you<00:00:54.420> and<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:54.930> game<00:00:55.079> can<00:00:55.260> cope

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
using against you and the game can cope

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.439 
using against you and the game can cope
with<00:00:55.500> that<00:00:55.739> it<00:00:55.980> understands<00:00:56.460> what<00:00:56.969> it's<00:00:57.120> doing

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
with that it understands what it's doing

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.060 
with that it understands what it's doing
it<00:00:57.600> understands<00:00:58.020> roughly<00:00:58.410> what<00:00:58.590> you're<00:00:58.710> doing

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
it understands roughly what you're doing

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.760 
it understands roughly what you're doing
and<00:00:59.600> usually<00:01:00.600> things<00:01:01.020> won't<00:01:01.199> break<00:01:01.469> the

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
and usually things won't break the

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.130 
and usually things won't break the
problem<00:01:02.190> is<00:01:02.340> you<00:01:03.059> won't<00:01:03.210> often<00:01:03.690> play<00:01:03.870> it<00:01:04.019> that

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
problem is you won't often play it that

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.509 
problem is you won't often play it that
way<00:01:04.199> for<00:01:04.619> better<00:01:04.769> or<00:01:04.890> worse<00:01:04.920> you'll<00:01:05.339> play<00:01:05.460> it

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
way for better or worse you'll play it

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.399 
way for better or worse you'll play it
like<00:01:05.670> a<00:01:05.700> video<00:01:05.880> game<00:01:06.060> and<00:01:06.479> that<00:01:06.810> means<00:01:07.049> when

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
like a video game and that means when

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.920 
like a video game and that means when
you<00:01:07.590> realize<00:01:08.040> that<00:01:08.790> running<00:01:09.090> a<00:01:09.119> unit<00:01:09.810> of

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
you realize that running a unit of

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.289 
you realize that running a unit of
cavalry<00:01:10.229> across<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.100> enemy<00:01:11.340> formation<00:01:11.820> has

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
cavalry across the enemy formation has

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.780 
cavalry across the enemy formation has
them<00:01:12.540> freaked<00:01:12.840> out<00:01:12.990> often<00:01:13.790> completely

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
them freaked out often completely

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.120 
them freaked out often completely
changing<00:01:15.689> information<00:01:15.840> and<00:01:16.439> sometimes<00:01:16.680> just

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
changing information and sometimes just

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.770 
changing information and sometimes just
ignoring<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.820> incoming<00:01:18.240> force<00:01:18.540> that's<00:01:18.720> going

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
ignoring the incoming force that's going

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.690 
ignoring the incoming force that's going
towards<00:01:19.200> them<00:01:19.380> and<00:01:19.710> focusing<00:01:20.159> on<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.340> cavalry

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
towards them and focusing on the cavalry

what's going on and still yet to come
out<00:01:38.520> of<00:01:38.640> a<00:01:38.700> siege<00:01:38.880> battle<00:01:39.210> in<00:01:39.299> Rome<00:01:39.450> -<00:01:39.659> and

that's largely because when things go
wrong<00:05:24.120> on<00:05:24.390> the<00:05:24.420> battlefield<00:05:24.930> it's

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:25.230 
wrong on the battlefield it's

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:27.560
