00:00:01.719 --> 00:00:03.870
 with our readers in this matter 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:05.640
 I want to tell you about 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.600
 another simple toy called 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.600
 super articles 

00:00:12.419 --> 00:00:14.219
 what is the essence of the game 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.259
 I'll start again the players he explained 

00:00:17.259 --> 00:00:20.749
 the bottom line is that 

00:00:20.749 --> 00:00:22.259
 running across the screen 

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:24.099
 on the horizontal plane of the memory here 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:25.269
 such 

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:26.519
 and not yet 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.769
 with increasing speed 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.099
 you need 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:31.840
 but keep up 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.760
 you can survive on the screen in any 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:34.420
 place 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:35.490
 so that 

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:38.210
 next strip 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.640
 and vadim got up level 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.110
 with the previous it is now permissible 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:45.610
 and me 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:48.610
 it turns out especially well 

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:50.780
 actually the whole question is that 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.850
 it is in the reaction that is 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.850
 as far as 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.140
 percentage you manage to do this here 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.740
 I remember the help strip vertical 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:02.940
 and correspondingly 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.800
 level passed, you can either increase 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.630
 speed either 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.530
 add 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.990
 difficulties 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.259
 that is, at the start I have so many 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:16.660
 blocks 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:19.660
 but it is more difficult with the text 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:22.860
 toy after time 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.160
 like the previous one and told 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.510
 but 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:29.190
 during the game 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:31.350
 in this group but also want to head 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.300
 literally 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:33.660
 throw this topic 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.950
 at least in any way 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.580
 that's the way that fails 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.470
 to combine 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:44.470
 and that's literally lost 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.430
 but the game is on the reaction of words 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.360
 and speed 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.970
 so that 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.970
 someone I think she 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.350
 saved and because you are 120 minutes 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.960
 although aktobe losing 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.790
 Here is such a toy 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:08.809
 by the way results can 

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:11.349
 look online 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:14.719
 and publish your 

00:02:14.719 --> 00:02:16.369
 what to trade through different 

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:17.099
 experts see
