00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:33.740 

my<00:00:31.920> approach<00:00:32.160> to<00:00:32.279> sets<00:00:32.730> is<00:00:32.910> always<00:00:33.300> based<00:00:33.510> on

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
my approach to sets is always based on

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.150 
my approach to sets is always based on
the<00:00:33.840> crowd's<00:00:34.050> reaction<00:00:34.170> there's<00:00:34.950> a<00:00:34.980> lot<00:00:35.040> of

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
the crowd's reaction there's a lot of

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.920 
the crowd's reaction there's a lot of
DJ's<00:00:35.520> out<00:00:35.640> there<00:00:35.910> that<00:00:36.090> prepare<00:00:36.420> their<00:00:36.600> set<00:00:36.780> to

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
DJ's out there that prepare their set to

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.570 
DJ's out there that prepare their set to
know<00:00:37.050> exactly<00:00:37.170> beforehand<00:00:38.130> oh<00:00:38.280> they're<00:00:38.430> going

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:38.580 
know exactly beforehand oh they're going

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.150 
know exactly beforehand oh they're going
to<00:00:38.640> play<00:00:38.880> I<00:00:39.090> think<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:40.080> essence<00:00:40.739> of<00:00:40.830> being<00:00:41.010> a

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
to play I think the essence of being a

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.650 
to play I think the essence of being a
DJ<00:00:41.489> is<00:00:41.550> looking<00:00:41.880> at<00:00:41.970> the<00:00:42.090> crowd<00:00:42.270> and<00:00:42.330> then

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
DJ is looking at the crowd and then

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.440 
DJ is looking at the crowd and then
decided<00:00:43.140> we<00:00:43.230> go<00:00:43.410> with<00:00:43.800> your<00:00:43.950> set<00:00:44.190> I<00:00:44.370> mean<00:00:44.520> for

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
decided we go with your set I mean for

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.630 
decided we go with your set I mean for
me<00:00:45.600> that<00:00:46.200> is<00:00:46.230> a<00:00:46.350> difference<00:00:46.739> between<00:00:46.770> you<00:00:47.520> know

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
me that is a difference between you know

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.160 
me that is a difference between you know
that's<00:00:47.879> why<00:00:47.970> we<00:00:48.120> are<00:00:48.210> DJs<00:00:48.600> and<00:00:48.629> we<00:00:48.840> will<00:00:48.960> never

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
that's why we are DJs and we will never

00:00:49.170 --> 00:01:01.020 
that's why we are DJs and we will never
be<00:00:49.410> rock<00:00:49.860> stars

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.030 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.380 

I<00:01:01.739> saw<00:01:02.739> some<00:01:03.010> of<00:01:03.129> my<00:01:03.219> colleague<00:01:03.520> DJ<00:01:03.820> save<00:01:04.119> some

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.390 
I saw some of my colleague DJ save some

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.260 
I saw some of my colleague DJ save some
really<00:01:04.659> stupid<00:01:04.839> things<00:01:05.019> about<00:01:05.820> comparing<00:01:06.820> Las

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:07.270 
really stupid things about comparing Las

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:08.940 
really stupid things about comparing Las
Vegas<00:01:07.659> to<00:01:07.690> Ibiza<00:01:08.110> let<00:01:08.409> me<00:01:08.500> start<00:01:08.770> by<00:01:08.830> saying

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:08.950 
Vegas to Ibiza let me start by saying

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:12.120 
Vegas to Ibiza let me start by saying
that<00:01:09.640> there<00:01:09.909> is<00:01:10.000> no<00:01:10.240> thing<00:01:11.200> like<00:01:11.470> Ibiza<00:01:11.830> and

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:12.130 
that there is no thing like Ibiza and

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.280 
that there is no thing like Ibiza and
there's<00:01:12.340> nothing<00:01:12.670> like<00:01:12.820> Las<00:01:13.060> Vegas<00:01:13.509> I<00:01:13.690> think

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:14.290 
there's nothing like Las Vegas I think

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:15.600 
there's nothing like Las Vegas I think
there's<00:01:14.409> nothing<00:01:14.770> wrong<00:01:14.920> with<00:01:14.979> cities<00:01:15.460> being

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:15.610 
there's nothing wrong with cities being

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:17.520 
there's nothing wrong with cities being
unique<00:01:16.030> and<00:01:16.299> I<00:01:16.420> don't<00:01:16.630> really<00:01:16.900> understand<00:01:17.409> the

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:17.530 
unique and I don't really understand the

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:19.350 
unique and I don't really understand the
need<00:01:17.740> to<00:01:17.770> compare<00:01:18.250> las<00:01:18.490> vegas<00:01:18.880> with<00:01:19.000> ibiza

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:19.360 
need to compare las vegas with ibiza

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.200 
need to compare las vegas with ibiza
because<00:01:19.810> las<00:01:20.560> vegas<00:01:20.979> is<00:01:21.100> so<00:01:21.340> much<00:01:21.520> bigger<00:01:21.759> is

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.210 
because las vegas is so much bigger is

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:43.850 
because las vegas is so much bigger is
so<00:01:22.390> much<00:01:22.570> more<00:01:22.600> going<00:01:22.810> on<00:01:23.140> here

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.800 

what<00:01:44.460> I<00:01:44.490> do<00:01:44.610> think<00:01:44.970> is<00:01:45.060> a<00:01:45.090> bit<00:01:45.300> strange<00:01:45.510> is<00:01:45.780> that

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
what I do think is a bit strange is that

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.660 
what I do think is a bit strange is that
the<00:01:46.440> house<00:01:46.590> guys<00:01:46.830> are<00:01:47.040> stealing<00:01:47.190> the<00:01:47.400> trans

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
the house guys are stealing the trans

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.730 
the house guys are stealing the trans
melodies<00:01:48.090> I<00:01:48.420> think<00:01:48.960> it's<00:01:49.080> still<00:01:49.140> trans<00:01:49.530> you

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
melodies I think it's still trans you

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.050 
melodies I think it's still trans you
know<00:01:49.860> trance<00:01:50.280> is<00:01:50.400> so<00:01:50.520> much<00:01:50.670> more<00:01:50.700> than<00:01:51.030> just

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
know trance is so much more than just

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.900 
know trance is so much more than just
one<00:01:51.300> type<00:01:52.200> of<00:01:52.230> music<00:01:52.560> it<00:01:52.830> is<00:01:52.860> very<00:01:53.310> broad<00:01:53.610> if

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:53.910 
one type of music it is very broad if

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:56.360 
one type of music it is very broad if
you<00:01:54.000> listen<00:01:54.210> to<00:01:54.300> my<00:01:54.420> set<00:01:54.720> is<00:01:54.870> very<00:01:55.770> broad<00:01:56.010> range

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:56.370 
you listen to my set is very broad range

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:58.010 
you listen to my set is very broad range
of<00:01:56.520> music<00:01:56.970> and<00:01:57.180> there<00:01:57.390> so<00:01:57.540> I<00:01:57.570> think<00:01:57.660> there's<00:01:57.960> a

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
of music and there so I think there's a

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.570 
of music and there so I think there's a
big<00:01:58.170> future<00:01:58.410> for<00:01:58.560> transit<00:01:59.070> don't<00:01:59.250> so<00:01:59.400> that's

00:01:59.570 --> 00:01:59.580 
big future for transit don't so that's

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:13.730 
big future for transit don't so that's
what<00:01:59.700> I'm<00:01:59.790> going<00:01:59.910> to<00:02:00.000> try<00:02:00.300> and<00:02:00.390> support

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.320
