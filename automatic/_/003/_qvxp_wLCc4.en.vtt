00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:14.490
 Hmm 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:14.490
 Oh 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.630
 th 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.420
 padi 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:21.050
 This time I tried to hit the view bird of Nittak 's table software 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:26.360
 Well this time was test hitting by the cooperation to Takafumi Watanabe contract coach of Knitting Taku 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:30.330
 It is a building immediately , but how was it as a first impression? 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:33.520
 That's right for the first hand 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:39.149
 There is your child at the time with 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:39.149
 It feels like there are 4 turns 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:43.110
 I think it's a pretty good feeling 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:50.810
 How is it? 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:54.120
 It is quite metal when I hit with celluloid 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:58.130
 When it is Depp in feel to be 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:59.770
 Rutteyuu properly speed out when you put a fine or force 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:07.010
 It feels like 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:10.880
 There was I Toka gulp hard to do to reverse or the Yari easy technology Try technology 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:17.360
 Whether receive Toka Toka block also why poking 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:18.890
 Roughly easy-to-do rubber and versatile rubber There 's no such thing as a weakness 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:25.569
 Though it is feeling 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:30.400
 Personally I think that speed will come out a little more 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:34.080
 Grains are very low and thick 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:39.030
 It has become a shape that is filled with grain 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:42.800
 Well lower thick grain so far is jammed in wales 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.800
 Say I Table software is I think very unusual Kana 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:48.960
 Opposition party 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:52.380
 In the speed system, it is an image that the rotation is very high 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:56.280
 More in the fourth one of the rubber of the rotating system 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:03:02.160
 I think that there is a rotating rubber, but web speed 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:03.540
 ko It is a very good rubber for those who think that they want to use a little more rotation until now 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.819
 I think 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.469
 air 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:10.560
 The rest is great when you play 8 blocks 

00:03:08.469 --> 00:03:15.780
 Stay before 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:19.020
 There was a feeling that it was easy to stop , so there was a great feeling that I could not beat it 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:23.160
 I think that it is also good for the player corresponding to the block 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:25.530
 You will fall to the front when you hit a cut 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:30.300
 So it is difficult to match the distance 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:34.110
 Because if you put in force, it will not go deep without permission 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:38.120
 Very easy to use for such controls 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:44.480
 I think it is a table software section that you can control yourself 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:46.010
 After this, I tried to match 8 acoustic garden and good 5 plywood of Tama gochi this time 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:49.069
 Until here 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:52.700
 Because the control is a good rubber, a little more 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:58.189
 Use a racket or table software that contains carbon 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:04:01.000
 About all means try because even control is looks good to meet a good racket of under unnecessary play 

00:03:58.189 --> 00:04:01.000
 Please try
