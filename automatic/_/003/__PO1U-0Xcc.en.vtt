00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:11.219
 tires are one of the biggest costs 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.349
 operating a fleet in general 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.269
 tire is second place losing 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.550
 only for fuel 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.680
 but in fact with a good system of 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.529
 tire management system you can 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.689
 improve many other factors such as 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.150
 the reduction of accidents 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.519
 preservation of the environment and 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.309
 reduction of fuel costs and 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:35.969
 fleet maintenance on jundiahy express 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.079
 are approximately 4,500 tires 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.140
 monitored 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.890
 Let's know a bit more about tms. 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.690
 Average Team To Sixth Dabo Dini 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:48.559
 used by the Jundiaí Express and as 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.390
 this control can bring results 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:55.739
 significant effects on the company and 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:58.829
 purchase on the basis of the reports 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:01.289
 generated by the system, it is possible to 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:04.890
 tur ability of each model that marks 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:07.590
 of tires arriving at cpk with the cost per 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.260
 kilometer is based on this given that 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:13.820
 we get our tires because we do not always 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:16.170
 the cheapest tire is the most durable and 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.780
 consequently more economical 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.119
 we always keep the main brands of the 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.640
 market in our fleet because 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:27.090
 we follow the evolution of the 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.820
 identification results 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.970
 each tire receives its own identity 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.280
 called sea ​​click is through this 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.579
 number that we can track all 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:41.330
 know your historic location 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:46.010
 time of life etc 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:49.550
 there are strict criteria for 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:52.150
 for mounting and matching the tires 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:55.130
 front wheels do not use tires 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:58.310
 as determined by law 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:01.010
 Only tires with 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:04.400
 first pickup on the free wheels 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:07.430
 tires with up to two pickups 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:10.759
 the larger tires roll until the juice 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:13.610
 reach 3 mm and the smaller tires 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:16.280
 until the juice reaches 2 mm 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:20.270
 it is worth remembering that the law requires that the tire 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:22.730
 be removed with 1.6 mm in the 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:25.730
 assembly we prioritize using the 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:28.520
 called perfect pairs when the tires 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:31.220
 have the same make and model and when the 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:34.940
 depth and type of juice are 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:37.730
 Similar control tire 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:40.250
 This is the fundamental part of the 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.380
 collection of information and a good basis 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:45.620
 of the data are fundamental 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:47.180
 to generate consistent reports for 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:50.209
 that we can do the maintenance 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:53.290
 periodic pressure of the tire caster 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:55.959
 purchases and improvements in the process 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:58.790
 daily our team of inspectors 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:02.180
 fleet and inspecting the 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:04.610
 tires with the audit tool dabo diniz 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:07.010
 the data that at the end of the 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:09.410
 day will feed the system are 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:12.230
 checked the tire pressure 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:15.739
 wear by measuring the juices and 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:17.570
 malfunctions such as regularities cuts 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:21.050
 futures, among others 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:23.600
 an average of about 300 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:28.250
 tires per day 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:30.590
 the management system used tms 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.959
 by the jundiaí express offers in 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:35.660
 numerous managerial reports that 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:37.459
 allow for a quick and 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:39.410
 information easy 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:43.220
 are numerous reports with information 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:45.350
 by color graphics and alert systems 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:46.780
 we started the 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:51.910
 implementation of 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:54.450
 rudnei is the so-called ms in 1990 until 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:58.150
 so we do the tire control 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:59.020
 those to the tire supplier 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:01.060
 daime 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:02.800
 we got a lot of performance in the 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:05.200
 defined control 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:07.900
 in a very quick analysis, you 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.880
 can determine the best best tire 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:12.160
 cost per kilometer of tire 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:16.450
 system reports that they have 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:18.220
 presentations are easy to interpret 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:19.329
 have difficulty with the operator to 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:21.970
 handle right there 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:24.160
 Today I can say that our system 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:26.080
 is a facilitator 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:30.970
 it allows us to make a 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:35.470
 projection that we reduce the risk of 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:37.450
 lose porous casting too and he 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:41.530
 has been making it much easier to 

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:44.440
 control and believes that without them 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:46.380
 very difficult to control tire with 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:48.700
 security helps us a lot 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:51.220
 because it helps maintain the tires 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:52.510
 always a state and with an amount of 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:55.090
 enough rubber to avoid 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:56.350
 accidents being a great partner of the 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:59.050
 driver on the road 

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:00.910
 In addition, the environmental issue 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:03.370
 system helps us to keep the tires in 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:05.350
 good conditions and through it people 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:08.229
 emission of pollutants 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:10.120
 and fuel consumption and also a 

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:10.840
 reduction in the number of tires launched 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:15.250
 environment 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:18.640
 tire wear of the jundiaí Express 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:22.030
 and are sold after the second pick-up 

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:24.700
 ie can still be retread and 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:25.690
 safely used by others 

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:28.690
 vehicles 

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:31.500
 the waste tires are collected by 

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:34.060
 a specialized scrap dealer only 

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:36.729
 qualified suppliers by express 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:40.360
 jundiahy according to quality criteria 

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:42.729
 and environmental responsibility can 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:46.120
 reuse and disposal 

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:48.970
 of these tires a management system 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:49.590
 of jundiahy express tires 

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:51.720
 result 

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:54.870
 the expressive for the company to 

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:56.370
 society and the environment while 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:58.920
 Most companies 

00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:01.890
 tires are the second highest cost of 

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:03.980
 the fleet losing only to 

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:06.660
 the fuel with jundiaí expresso 

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:09.030
 represents the fourth cost and this 

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:12.630
 represents lower consumption of tires 

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:16.080
 emission of CO2 into the atmosphere and 

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:18.960
 lower fuel cost or lower 

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:20.550
 emission of pollutants and preservation of 

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:23.880
 natural resources 

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:26.370
 calibrated tires in good condition reduce 

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:29.700
 the risk of an accident in transit 

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:32.400
 main social problems of the country 

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:34.400
 how can we perceive the management of 

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:37.460
 tires is much more than an issue 

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:40.530
 is a socio-environmental issue 

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:44.850
 taken very seriously by the express 

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:48.230
 jundiahy express jundiaí do it well 

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:48.230
 always done
