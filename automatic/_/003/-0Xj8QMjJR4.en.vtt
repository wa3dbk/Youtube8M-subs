00:00:00.534 --> 00:00:03.235
Seems everybody's into the green
that I paint my machines with,

00:00:03.534 --> 00:00:05.634
so I'm gonna paint
this one as well.

00:00:05.667 --> 00:00:09.101
The colour I'm using is a
CIL Calypso Green,

00:00:09.133 --> 00:00:11.634
and it's just ordinary
indoor paint.

00:00:11.634 --> 00:00:15.568
I use my spray gun for that.

00:00:15.601 --> 00:00:19.601
Hmm, I think that needs a little
bit of water added to it.

00:00:34.367 --> 00:00:38.367
So, this is now with two coats
of the house paint, on there.

00:00:38.868 --> 00:00:41.602
I had to thin it down a little
bit, and it was a bit sputtery,

00:00:41.634 --> 00:00:43.901
but it worked OK.
And, what I like to do is to

00:00:43.934 --> 00:00:46.401
protect that paint, and give it
a bit of a gloss, is I like to

00:00:46.434 --> 00:00:50.434
put a clear-coat on there just
essentially a clear varnish

00:01:01.701 --> 00:01:05.435
For the top of the saw, I rub
some black acrylic paint

00:01:05.467 --> 00:01:08.101
on to it, just for a contrast
And, I taped up the slots

00:01:08.133 --> 00:01:10.367
so I wouldn't get any finish in
there, and I'm gonna try

00:01:10.367 --> 00:01:13.634
this fuse UV finish, but before
I put that finish on,

00:01:13.634 --> 00:01:17.634
it needs a special primer to
get a really good adhesion.

00:01:24.567 --> 00:01:26.901
So, I'm gonna finish the
top of this, with this

00:01:26.934 --> 00:01:30.601
FUZ UV-Cured finish,
and it comes in these canS,

00:01:30.634 --> 00:01:33.568
and it's quite thick so
it needs to be thinned.

00:01:33.601 --> 00:01:37.601
with a little bit of acetone.

00:01:39.434 --> 00:01:43.434
Otherwise it makes for
far too thick a coat.

00:01:48.234 --> 00:01:52.234
So, this is a UV-Cured finish,
it's also quite smelly,

00:01:53.601 --> 00:01:57.601
so it's best to use it outside,
on a bright day,

00:01:57.868 --> 00:02:01.868
so then you can use the sun
to UV-Cure it.

00:02:11.801 --> 00:02:14.568
With the first coat
now fully cured in the sun,

00:02:14.601 --> 00:02:16.801
I'm just using a scraper to
take out all the high spots.

00:02:16.834 --> 00:02:19.034
'Cause everywhere there's a
fiber sticking out, there'll

00:02:19.067 --> 00:02:23.067
be a bump in the finish.

00:02:23.968 --> 00:02:26.702
Now, with this finish fully
sun-cured

00:02:26.734 --> 00:02:29.867
and scraped flat, hopefully
the next coat is gonna

00:02:29.868 --> 00:02:32.302
come out nice and smooth.

00:02:32.334 --> 00:02:35.634
But, with these UV finishes,
you typically end up

00:02:35.667 --> 00:02:39.667
buffing it aferwards and I
don't have a buffing wheel,

00:02:39.767 --> 00:02:42.101
so see what happens.
I was, kind of, running out of

00:02:42.133 --> 00:02:44.734
daylight after that second coat
so I had to move it a few times

00:02:44.767 --> 00:02:47.967
to catch those last rays of sun.

00:02:47.968 --> 00:02:50.902
Well, that finish didn't
cone out the smoothest

00:02:50.934 --> 00:02:54.234
but it's nice and hard
and it's shiny,

00:02:54.267 --> 00:02:56.834
And, with the rest of the saw,
painted and varnished,

00:02:56.868 --> 00:03:00.669
the fence looked out of place,
so I did that one as well.

00:03:00.701 --> 00:03:04.001
I quite like how that saw looks
without that cloth in the front,

00:03:04.033 --> 00:03:06.834
but I put it back to help
keep the dust inside.

00:03:06.868 --> 00:03:09.635
I attached that cloth with
some screws and washers now

00:03:09.667 --> 00:03:11.767
so I wouldn't have to use
up two of my spring clamps

00:03:11.801 --> 00:03:14.502
to hold it, and if I want to use
it with some sort of shop vac

00:03:14.534 --> 00:03:17.801
or dust collector, I just stick
the hose in the fence

00:03:17.834 --> 00:03:21.834
and that's that.
