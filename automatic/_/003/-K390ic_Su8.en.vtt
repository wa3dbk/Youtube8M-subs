now your task list with an Outlook also

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:08.299 
now your task list with an Outlook also
has<00:00:07.020> some<00:00:07.200> great<00:00:07.319> opportunities<00:00:08.010> for<00:00:08.189> you<00:00:08.280> to

has some great opportunities for you to

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:10.580 
has some great opportunities for you to
get<00:00:08.490> organized<00:00:08.970> and<00:00:09.300> sort<00:00:09.780> of<00:00:09.840> prioritize<00:00:10.349> the

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
get organized and sort of prioritize the

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.919 
get organized and sort of prioritize the
things<00:00:10.860> that<00:00:11.070> you<00:00:11.219> need<00:00:11.429> to<00:00:11.460> do<00:00:11.780> one<00:00:12.780> of<00:00:12.809> the

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
things that you need to do one of the

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:14.959 
things that you need to do one of the
big<00:00:13.110> dangers<00:00:13.349> with<00:00:13.710> task<00:00:13.980> list<00:00:14.280> I<00:00:14.400> think<00:00:14.790> is

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
big dangers with task list I think is

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.150 
big dangers with task list I think is
when<00:00:15.179> you<00:00:15.240> get<00:00:15.360> a<00:00:15.420> just<00:00:16.049> a<00:00:16.139> very<00:00:16.170> long<00:00:16.740> list<00:00:16.980> and

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
when you get a just a very long list and

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.859 
when you get a just a very long list and
you<00:00:17.220> begin<00:00:17.460> to<00:00:17.520> lose<00:00:17.760> track<00:00:18.029> of<00:00:18.060> when<00:00:18.480> stuff<00:00:18.750> is

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
you begin to lose track of when stuff is

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.140 
you begin to lose track of when stuff is
supposed<00:00:19.109> to<00:00:19.199> be<00:00:19.350> done<00:00:19.500> it<00:00:19.980> can<00:00:20.369> almost<00:00:20.580> become

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
supposed to be done it can almost become

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.390 
supposed to be done it can almost become
counterproductive<00:00:21.980> so<00:00:22.980> one<00:00:23.160> of<00:00:23.189> the<00:00:23.279> things

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
counterproductive so one of the things

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.460 
counterproductive so one of the things
that<00:00:23.550> I<00:00:23.580> try<00:00:23.850> to<00:00:23.910> do<00:00:24.029> is<00:00:24.150> consolidate<00:00:24.600> tasks<00:00:25.380> so

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
that I try to do is consolidate tasks so

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.009 
that I try to do is consolidate tasks so
here<00:00:25.710> under<00:00:25.800> clients<00:00:26.400> I<00:00:26.580> might<00:00:27.359> have<00:00:27.570> a<00:00:27.599> client

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
here under clients I might have a client

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.810 
here under clients I might have a client
follow-up<00:00:28.619> list<00:00:28.859> task<00:00:29.160> which<00:00:29.369> is<00:00:29.490> sort<00:00:29.670> of<00:00:29.760> a

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
follow-up list task which is sort of a

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.450 
follow-up list task which is sort of a
master<00:00:30.150> task<00:00:30.630> that<00:00:31.230> I<00:00:31.470> want<00:00:31.830> to<00:00:31.949> use<00:00:32.130> all<00:00:32.399> the

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
master task that I want to use all the

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.060 
master task that I want to use all the
time<00:00:32.969> to<00:00:33.570> keep<00:00:33.719> a<00:00:33.870> running<00:00:34.110> list<00:00:34.350> of<00:00:34.829> all<00:00:34.950> the

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
time to keep a running list of all the

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.290 
time to keep a running list of all the
stuff<00:00:35.250> I've<00:00:35.399> got<00:00:35.430> to<00:00:35.640> follow<00:00:35.790> up<00:00:36.030> with<00:00:36.149> on

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
stuff I've got to follow up with on

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.970 
stuff I've got to follow up with on
clients<00:00:36.750> that<00:00:36.899> way<00:00:37.050> I<00:00:37.079> just<00:00:37.230> have<00:00:37.500> one<00:00:37.710> place

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
clients that way I just have one place

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.920 
clients that way I just have one place
to<00:00:38.010> go<00:00:38.190> they're<00:00:38.760> not<00:00:38.790> sort<00:00:39.120> of<00:00:39.180> spread<00:00:39.660> out

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
to go they're not sort of spread out

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.630 
to go they're not sort of spread out
amongst<00:00:40.379> all<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:40.710> other<00:00:40.860> tasks<00:00:41.309> and<00:00:41.430> that<00:00:41.520> way

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
amongst all the other tasks and that way

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.910 
amongst all the other tasks and that way
I<00:00:41.670> can<00:00:41.790> prioritize<00:00:42.480> them<00:00:42.719> for<00:00:42.899> example<00:00:43.290> if<00:00:43.469> I

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
I can prioritize them for example if I

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.760 
I can prioritize them for example if I

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.260 
watch what happens see how it pops right
up<00:00:58.350> to<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.680> top<00:00:58.859> of<00:00:59.010> that<00:00:59.039> list<00:00:59.340> so<00:00:59.609> you<00:01:00.090> can

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
up to the top of that list so you can

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.959 
up to the top of that list so you can
create<00:01:00.480> some<00:01:00.780> client<00:01:01.190> summary<00:01:02.190> type<00:01:02.399> lists<00:01:02.820> or

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
create some client summary type lists or

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.600 
create some client summary type lists or
a<00:01:03.000> summary<00:01:03.449> type<00:01:03.690> tasks<00:01:04.260> like<00:01:04.949> this<00:01:05.159> client

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
a summary type tasks like this client

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.450 
a summary type tasks like this client
tasks<00:01:05.850> and<00:01:06.200> and<00:01:07.200> name<00:01:07.590> them<00:01:07.799> in<00:01:07.860> a<00:01:08.070> certain<00:01:08.340> way

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
tasks and and name them in a certain way

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:09.980 
tasks and and name them in a certain way
and<00:01:08.670> they'll<00:01:08.790> be<00:01:08.939> prioritized<00:01:09.570> now<00:01:09.780> of<00:01:09.840> course

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
and they'll be prioritized now of course

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.950 
and they'll be prioritized now of course
you<00:01:10.140> can<00:01:10.290> also<00:01:10.470> categorize<00:01:11.130> things<00:01:11.610> and<00:01:12.479> using

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
you can also categorize things and using

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.359 
you can also categorize things and using
the<00:01:13.200> same<00:01:13.350> categories<00:01:13.920> that<00:01:14.070> you're<00:01:14.189> using

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
the same categories that you're using

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.910 
the same categories that you're using
with<00:01:14.610> an<00:01:14.700> email<00:01:15.000> so<00:01:15.210> maybe<00:01:15.479> this<00:01:15.689> is<00:01:15.930> a<00:01:16.409> team

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
with an email so maybe this is a team

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.999 
with an email so maybe this is a team
related<00:01:17.340> event<00:01:17.640> you<00:01:18.600> can<00:01:18.780> uncheck<00:01:19.259> admin<00:01:19.770> and

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
related event you can uncheck admin and

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.100 
related event you can uncheck admin and
make<00:01:20.580> this<00:01:20.700> a<00:01:20.759> team<00:01:21.030> or<00:01:21.240> this<00:01:21.360> could<00:01:21.479> be<00:01:21.540> urgent

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
make this a team or this could be urgent

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.630 
make this a team or this could be urgent
you<00:01:22.170> know<00:01:22.350> you<00:01:22.409> could<00:01:22.650> label<00:01:22.890> urgent<00:01:23.490> and

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
you know you could label urgent and

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.730 
you know you could label urgent and
important<00:01:24.150> and<00:01:24.330> sort<00:01:24.869> of<00:01:24.990> sort<00:01:25.290> on<00:01:25.500> those

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
important and sort of sort on those

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.340 
important and sort of sort on those
particular<00:01:26.189> tasks<00:01:26.850> I'd<00:01:27.780> also<00:01:27.930> like<00:01:28.080> to<00:01:28.140> show

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
particular tasks I'd also like to show

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:29.780
