00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:03.179 
all right so I went over to northern

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:08.090 
all right so I went over to northern
supply<00:00:03.809> to<00:00:04.350> complete<00:00:05.189> the<00:00:05.399> final<00:00:06.560> mod<00:00:07.560> to<00:00:07.919> this

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:08.100 
supply to complete the final mod to this

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.430 
supply to complete the final mod to this
or<00:00:08.519> at<00:00:08.610> least<00:00:08.759> the<00:00:09.090> next<00:00:09.750> step<00:00:09.990> in<00:00:10.170> the<00:00:10.259> mud

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
or at least the next step in the mud

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.100 
or at least the next step in the mud
because<00:00:11.370> I<00:00:11.549> was<00:00:11.670> tired<00:00:11.940> of<00:00:12.179> the<00:00:12.240> head<00:00:12.839> strap

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
because I was tired of the head strap

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.530 
because I was tired of the head strap
broke<00:00:13.379> the<00:00:13.679> over<00:00:13.980> molded<00:00:14.429> rubber<00:00:14.639> strap<00:00:15.360> in

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
broke the over molded rubber strap in

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.280 
broke the over molded rubber strap in
the<00:00:15.570> back<00:00:16.340> finally<00:00:17.340> just<00:00:17.520> broke<00:00:17.670> off<00:00:18.030> and<00:00:18.450> I

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:19.290 
the back finally just broke off and I

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:21.500 
the back finally just broke off and I
was<00:00:19.560> tired<00:00:19.800> of<00:00:19.950> the<00:00:20.010> sock<00:00:20.370> strap<00:00:20.850> on<00:00:21.120> the<00:00:21.240> front

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
was tired of the sock strap on the front

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.720 
was tired of the sock strap on the front
pad<00:00:21.780> and<00:00:22.140> all<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:22.380> front<00:00:22.650> pads<00:00:22.890> kept<00:00:23.310> breaking

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
pad and all the front pads kept breaking

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.060 
pad and all the front pads kept breaking
the<00:00:24.320> little<00:00:25.320> notch<00:00:25.530> where<00:00:25.860> they<00:00:25.950> plug<00:00:26.190> in<00:00:26.430> so<00:00:27.150> I

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:28.070 
the little notch where they plug in so I

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.580 
the little notch where they plug in so I
figured<00:00:29.070> I'd<00:00:29.190> come<00:00:29.430> up<00:00:29.460> with<00:00:29.870> my<00:00:30.870> solution

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
figured I'd come up with my solution

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.290 
figured I'd come up with my solution
without<00:00:32.519> putting<00:00:33.510> it<00:00:33.719> into<00:00:33.870> a<00:00:34.469> ski<00:00:34.949> mask<00:00:35.300> that

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
without putting it into a ski mask that

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.880 
without putting it into a ski mask that
just<00:00:36.480> seems<00:00:36.660> like<00:00:36.839> too<00:00:37.050> much<00:00:37.199> of<00:00:37.320> a<00:00:37.350> pain<00:00:37.589> so

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
just seems like too much of a pain so

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.639 
just seems like too much of a pain so
the<00:00:38.879> biggest<00:00:39.059> thing<00:00:39.449> was<00:00:39.719> take<00:00:40.109> out<00:00:40.289> all<00:00:40.499> that

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
the biggest thing was take out all that

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.470 
the biggest thing was take out all that
nose<00:00:40.890> plastic<00:00:41.579> so<00:00:41.730> you<00:00:41.760> can<00:00:41.940> actually<00:00:42.120> pull

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
nose plastic so you can actually pull

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.899 
nose plastic so you can actually pull
the<00:00:42.600> thing<00:00:42.809> in<00:00:42.929> nice<00:00:43.109> and<00:00:43.350> tight<00:00:43.559> and<00:00:44.489> it

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:44.909 
the thing in nice and tight and it

00:00:44.909 --> 00:00:46.520 
the thing in nice and tight and it
seemed<00:00:45.120> to<00:00:45.179> work<00:00:45.239> out<00:00:45.510> really<00:00:45.690> good<00:00:45.960> once<00:00:46.379> I

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
seemed to work out really good once I

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.369 
seemed to work out really good once I
put<00:00:46.739> on<00:00:46.859> this<00:00:47.749> basically<00:00:48.749> I<00:00:48.870> think<00:00:49.170> it's<00:00:49.289> a

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
put on this basically I think it's a

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.649 
put on this basically I think it's a
welding<00:00:49.829> strap<00:00:50.219> but<00:00:50.489> I<00:00:50.519> bought<00:00:50.760> it<00:00:50.940> on<00:00:51.059> a<00:00:51.089> face

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:51.659 
welding strap but I bought it on a face

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:53.989 
welding strap but I bought it on a face
shield<00:00:51.929> at<00:00:52.170> northern<00:00:52.499> supply<00:00:52.850> because<00:00:53.850> they

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:53.999 
shield at northern supply because they

00:00:53.999 --> 00:00:56.059 
shield at northern supply because they
didn't<00:00:54.239> have<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.539> individual<00:00:55.230> replacement

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:56.069 
didn't have the individual replacement

00:00:56.069 --> 00:00:58.579 
didn't have the individual replacement
part<00:00:56.249> but<00:00:56.429> I<00:00:56.460> think<00:00:56.640> it's<00:00:56.730> exact<00:00:57.149> same<00:00:57.329> one<00:00:57.600> so

00:00:58.579 --> 00:00:58.589 
part but I think it's exact same one so

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:01.430 
part but I think it's exact same one so
a<00:00:58.800> couple<00:00:59.039> bucks<00:00:59.309> more<00:00:59.899> and<00:01:00.899> I<00:01:01.019> bought<00:01:01.170> a<00:01:01.199> bunch

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
of various parts I ended up using this

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.620 
of various parts I ended up using this
camping<00:01:05.070> strap<00:01:05.430> with<00:01:05.700> a<00:01:05.730> little<00:01:06.030> notch<00:01:06.210> so<00:01:06.540> you

heavier<00:02:17.270> one<00:02:17.450> and<00:02:17.660> that<00:02:17.750> didn't<00:02:18.080> break<00:02:18.260> but<00:02:18.590> it

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
heavier one and that didn't break but it

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.940 
heavier one and that didn't break but it
was<00:02:19.280> just<00:02:19.460> in<00:02:19.550> the<00:02:19.640> way<00:02:19.760> so<00:02:19.820> I<00:02:20.740> give<00:02:21.740> it<00:02:21.770> the

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
was just in the way so I give it the

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.350 
was just in the way so I give it the
clip<00:02:22.840> so<00:02:23.840> I<00:02:23.870> don't<00:02:24.050> know<00:02:24.140> if<00:02:24.200> you<00:02:24.290> can<00:02:24.440> see

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
clip so I don't know if you can see

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:30.610 
clip so I don't know if you can see
exactly<00:02:27.670> but<00:02:28.670> you<00:02:28.880> still<00:02:29.150> have<00:02:29.410> the<00:02:30.410> full

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
exactly but you still have the full

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.140 
exactly but you still have the full
ratcheting<00:02:32.290> pull<00:02:33.290> in<00:02:33.470> and<00:02:33.680> out<00:02:33.850> so<00:02:34.850> when<00:02:35.030> it's

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
ratcheting pull in and out so when it's

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.330 
ratcheting pull in and out so when it's
on<00:02:35.270> your<00:02:35.480> head<00:02:35.720> you<00:02:36.410> can<00:02:36.560> actually<00:02:36.890> just<00:02:37.070> pull

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
on your head you can actually just pull

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.020 
on your head you can actually just pull
it<00:02:37.430> out<00:02:37.550> and<00:02:37.910> it'll<00:02:38.030> stay<00:02:38.300> on<00:02:38.330> stay<00:02:38.870> in<00:02:38.990> place

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
it out and it'll stay on stay in place

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.400 
it out and it'll stay on stay in place
so<00:02:41.030> this<00:02:41.180> strap<00:02:41.450> worked<00:02:41.750> that<00:02:41.900> really<00:02:42.200> did

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
so this strap worked that really did

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:48.210 
so this strap worked that really did
better<00:02:42.950> than<00:02:43.160> the<00:02:43.310> elastic<00:02:46.150> so<00:02:47.150> yeah<00:02:47.930> the

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
better than the elastic so yeah the

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:53.110 
better than the elastic so yeah the
little<00:02:49.220> ratchet<00:02:49.760> dial<00:02:50.510> works<00:02:51.080> nice<00:02:52.000> so<00:02:53.000> that

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
little ratchet dial works nice so that

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.390 
little ratchet dial works nice so that
gets<00:02:53.330> a<00:02:53.450> tie<00:02:53.630> it<00:02:53.690> still<00:02:54.080> it<00:02:54.560> still<00:02:54.740> can<00:02:55.040> pinch

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
gets a tie it still it still can pinch

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.720 
gets a tie it still it still can pinch
or<00:02:55.580> pinch<00:02:56.120> your<00:02:56.270> head<00:02:56.450> a<00:02:56.480> little<00:02:56.630> bit<00:02:57.730> after

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
or pinch your head a little bit after

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.300 
or pinch your head a little bit after
you<00:02:59.090> know<00:02:59.209> any<00:02:59.390> extended<00:03:00.230> time<00:03:00.500> it'd<00:03:00.740> be<00:03:00.890> nicer

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
you know any extended time it'd be nicer

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.430 
you know any extended time it'd be nicer
if<00:03:01.730> I<00:03:01.910> could<00:03:02.120> figure<00:03:02.330> out<00:03:02.480> how<00:03:02.780> to<00:03:03.430> adjust<00:03:04.430> this

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
if I could figure out how to adjust this

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.100 
if I could figure out how to adjust this
to<00:03:06.440> be<00:03:07.190> more<00:03:07.340> contour<00:03:07.910> to<00:03:08.420> your<00:03:08.540> forehead<00:03:08.900> the

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 
to be more contour to your forehead the

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:11.890 
to be more contour to your forehead the
way<00:03:09.200> it<00:03:09.350> ends<00:03:09.560> up<00:03:09.620> sitting<00:03:10.239> instead<00:03:11.239> of<00:03:11.360> just

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
way it ends up sitting instead of just

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.880 
way it ends up sitting instead of just
squeezing<00:03:12.890> more<00:03:13.310> along<00:03:13.670> this<00:03:13.910> bottom<00:03:14.330> edge

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
squeezing more along this bottom edge

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.860 
squeezing more along this bottom edge
but<00:03:15.890> other<00:03:16.040> than<00:03:16.160> that<00:03:16.269> it's<00:03:17.269> great

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
but other than that it's great

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:20.199 
but other than that it's great
improvement<00:03:18.560> and<00:03:18.680> also<00:03:19.070> with<00:03:19.250> this<00:03:19.430> the<00:03:20.030> way<00:03:20.180> I

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209 
improvement and also with this the way I

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:23.080 
improvement and also with this the way I
just<00:03:20.480> melted<00:03:21.130> just<00:03:22.130> use<00:03:22.250> the<00:03:22.430> soldering<00:03:22.640> iron

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
just melted just use the soldering iron

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.620 
just melted just use the soldering iron
on<00:03:23.420> the<00:03:23.720> main<00:03:23.930> disc<00:03:24.590> or<00:03:25.250> main<00:03:25.610> disc<00:03:25.940> the<00:03:26.180> main

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630 
on the main disc or main disc the main

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:31.570 
on the main disc or main disc the main
front<00:03:27.910> tab<00:03:28.910> and<00:03:29.540> just<00:03:30.100> popped<00:03:31.100> a<00:03:31.250> little<00:03:31.280> hole

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:31.580 
front tab and just popped a little hole

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:32.380 
front tab and just popped a little hole
right<00:03:31.610> through<00:03:31.850> there

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
right through there

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:34.330 
right through there
signer<00:03:32.900> hands<00:03:33.170> are<00:03:33.320> great<00:03:33.500> for<00:03:33.680> plastic<00:03:34.160> work

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
signer hands are great for plastic work

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.199 
signer hands are great for plastic work
because<00:03:34.730> you<00:03:34.880> can<00:03:35.030> just<00:03:35.470> you<00:03:36.470> can<00:03:36.680> pretty<00:03:36.860> much

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.209 
because you can just you can pretty much

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:41.620 
because you can just you can pretty much
well<00:03:38.209> door<00:03:38.630> or<00:03:39.050> like<00:03:39.980> hot<00:03:40.220> knife<00:03:40.250> cut<00:03:40.880> which<00:03:41.600> is

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:41.630 
well door or like hot knife cut which is

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
well door or like hot knife cut which is
what<00:03:41.959> I<00:03:41.989> did<00:03:42.400> to<00:03:43.400> get<00:03:43.580> all<00:03:43.730> that<00:03:43.880> out<00:03:43.940> of<00:03:44.269> there

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
what I did to get all that out of there

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:47.460 
what I did to get all that out of there
so<00:03:45.650> you<00:03:45.680> end<00:03:45.980> up<00:03:46.100> having<00:03:46.280> it<00:03:46.610> a<00:03:46.670> little<00:03:46.850> bit

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
so you end up having it a little bit

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.320 
so you end up having it a little bit
angled<00:03:48.470> which<00:03:48.769> gives<00:03:49.040> you<00:03:49.220> the<00:03:49.400> bottom<00:03:50.150> view

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:50.330 
angled which gives you the bottom view

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:52.210 
angled which gives you the bottom view
which<00:03:50.540> I<00:03:50.720> always<00:03:50.870> had<00:03:51.019> a<00:03:51.050> bottom<00:03:51.530> view<00:03:51.560> problem

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.220 
which I always had a bottom view problem

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.280 
which I always had a bottom view problem
seeing<00:03:53.209> that<00:03:53.450> bottom<00:03:53.750> edge<00:03:53.900> it<00:03:54.080> was<00:03:54.170> like

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.290 
seeing that bottom edge it was like

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.110 
seeing that bottom edge it was like
right<00:03:54.560> on<00:03:54.680> the<00:03:54.800> verge<00:03:54.980> of<00:03:55.220> not<00:03:55.280> showing<00:03:55.880> in<00:03:56.000> the

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
right on the verge of not showing in the

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:01.630 
right on the verge of not showing in the
image<00:03:56.420> so<00:03:58.330> that<00:03:59.330> is<00:04:00.130> somewhat<00:04:01.130> how<00:04:01.280> Sony

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:01.640 
image so that is somewhat how Sony

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.820 
image so that is somewhat how Sony
should<00:04:02.150> have<00:04:02.269> done<00:04:02.480> it<00:04:02.630> still<00:04:03.530> could<00:04:03.680> be<00:04:03.799> a

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:03.830 
should have done it still could be a

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:07.120 
should have done it still could be a
little<00:04:04.010> more<00:04:04.130> comfortable<00:04:04.640> but<00:04:05.830> it's<00:04:06.830> not<00:04:06.980> too

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:07.130 
little more comfortable but it's not too

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:10.600 
little more comfortable but it's not too
bad<00:04:07.310> it's<00:04:07.549> pretty<00:04:07.730> good<00:04:08.739> so<00:04:09.739> once<00:04:09.980> once<00:04:10.459> you

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:10.610 
bad it's pretty good so once once you

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:12.699 
bad it's pretty good so once once you
you<00:04:11.090> know<00:04:11.120> put<00:04:11.570> it<00:04:11.690> on<00:04:11.810> it's<00:04:12.110> easy<00:04:12.290> to<00:04:12.500> put<00:04:12.680> on

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:12.709 
you know put it on it's easy to put on

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:15.080 
you know put it on it's easy to put on
now<00:04:13.040> takes<00:04:13.880> a<00:04:14.030> second

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
now takes a second

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.890 
now takes a second
and<00:04:16.310> it's<00:04:17.310> been<00:04:17.459> a<00:04:17.489> good<00:04:17.639> time<00:04:17.880> so<00:04:18.480> anyway

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
and it's been a good time so anyway

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.060 
and it's been a good time so anyway
that's<00:04:19.290> about<00:04:19.500> it

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
that's about it

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:23.050 
that's about it
my<00:04:20.850> first<00:04:21.150> actual<00:04:21.630> narrated<00:04:22.290> video<00:04:22.410> of

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.060 
my first actual narrated video of

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:27.950 
my first actual narrated video of
explaining<00:04:24.530> any<00:04:25.530> of<00:04:25.680> this<00:04:25.770> stuff
