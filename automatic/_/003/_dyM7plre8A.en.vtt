00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
eventually anyway um I am completely

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.430 
eventually anyway um I am completely
against<00:00:35.760> legacy<00:00:36.239> mode<00:00:36.390> I'm<00:00:36.780> kidding<00:00:37.290> I'm<00:00:37.380> not

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
against legacy mode I'm kidding I'm not

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.160 
against legacy mode I'm kidding I'm not
I<00:00:38.030> think<00:00:39.030> it's<00:00:39.180> a<00:00:39.270> good<00:00:39.450> thing<00:00:39.690> for<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:39.989> game

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
I think it's a good thing for the game

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.930 
I think it's a good thing for the game
because<00:00:40.530> it'll<00:00:40.950> make<00:00:41.129> all<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.579> people<00:00:41.910> that

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
because it'll make all the people that

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.360 
because it'll make all the people that
are<00:00:42.120> annoying<00:00:42.510> happy<00:00:43.200> and<00:00:43.890> if<00:00:44.010> you<00:00:44.160> make

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
are annoying happy and if you make

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.540 
are annoying happy and if you make
annoying<00:00:44.700> people<00:00:45.210> people<00:00:45.840> people<00:00:46.469> people<00:00:47.070> I

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
annoying people people people people I

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:48.979 
annoying people people people people I
don't<00:00:47.760> even<00:00:47.850> know<00:00:48.000> how<00:00:48.149> I<00:00:48.180> just<00:00:48.480> messed<00:00:48.690> up<00:00:48.809> the

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
don't even know how I just messed up the

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.930 
don't even know how I just messed up the
word<00:00:49.140> people<00:00:49.440> you<00:00:50.010> make<00:00:50.190> annoying<00:00:50.489> people

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
word people you make annoying people

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.060 
word people you make annoying people
happy<00:00:51.270> then<00:00:51.840> they'll<00:00:52.110> probably<00:00:52.350> stop<00:00:52.800> being

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
happy then they'll probably stop being

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.470 
happy then they'll probably stop being
annoying<00:00:53.280> um<00:00:54.770> it's<00:00:55.770> good<00:00:56.039> for<00:00:56.280> PVM<00:00:56.640> for<00:00:57.329> them

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480

but really the only reason I want to do

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.660 
but really the only reason I want to do
it<00:00:59.940> is<00:01:00.059> because<00:01:00.210> of<00:01:00.449> pvp<00:01:01.289> and<00:01:01.559> it'll<00:01:02.039> it'll

monster hit points because monsters in
this<00:04:19.080> game<00:04:19.140> are<00:04:19.590> so<00:04:20.190> weak<00:04:21.169> according<00:04:22.169> to

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 
this game are so weak according to

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.530 
this game are so weak according to
things<00:04:22.650> that<00:04:22.830> people<00:04:23.100> said<00:04:23.250> on<00:04:23.370> the<00:04:23.490> stream

this current system EOC if I hit a 9000

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.310 
this current system EOC if I hit a 9000
that's<00:04:29.070> the<00:04:29.310> equivalent<00:04:29.610> of<00:04:30.060> hitting<00:04:30.360> a<00:04:30.450> 900

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320 
that's the equivalent of hitting a 900

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:37.250 
that's the equivalent of hitting a 900

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860 
80 hit points in in pre EOC which

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.640 
80 hit points in in pre EOC which
realistically<00:04:47.310> should<00:04:48.060> be<00:04:48.180> 800<00:04:49.110> hit<00:04:49.320> points

realistically should be 800 hit points
right<00:04:49.830> now<00:04:50.000> is<00:04:51.000> that<00:04:51.240> say<00:04:51.480> 800<00:04:52.140> does<00:04:52.680> that<00:04:52.830> say

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.130 
right now is that say 800 does that say

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:56.390 
right now is that say 800 does that say
no<00:04:53.400> that<00:04:53.610> says<00:04:53.790> 25<00:04:54.390> that's<00:04:54.870> not<00:04:55.110> even<00:04:55.140> near<00:04:55.740> 800

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400 
no that says 25 that's not even near 800

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.150 
no that says 25 that's not even near 800
these<00:04:56.910> things<00:04:57.210> are<00:04:57.420> way<00:04:57.750> too<00:04:57.810> weak<00:04:58.290> and<00:04:58.590> that

00:04:59.150 --> 00:04:59.160 
these things are way too weak and that

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:00.770 
these things are way too weak and that
applies<00:04:59.460> the<00:04:59.670> majority<00:05:00.210> of<00:05:00.240> monsters<00:05:00.660> in

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:00.780 
applies the majority of monsters in

applies the majority of monsters in
runescape<00:05:01.200> when<00:05:01.830> they<00:05:01.950> start<00:05:02.310> at<00:05:02.430> aoc<00:05:02.640> they

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:03.000 
runescape when they start at aoc they

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.760 
runescape when they start at aoc they
basically<00:05:03.360> just<00:05:03.510> started<00:05:04.140> a<00:05:04.200> clean<00:05:04.410> slate<00:05:04.560> and

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:04.770 
basically just started a clean slate and

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:06.080 
basically just started a clean slate and
they're<00:05:04.890> like<00:05:05.040> we're<00:05:05.130> gonna<00:05:05.280> rework<00:05:05.730> all<00:05:05.940> the

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.090 
they're like we're gonna rework all the

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:07.910 
they're like we're gonna rework all the
monsters<00:05:06.420> and<00:05:06.450> pick<00:05:06.690> our<00:05:06.810> own<00:05:06.930> HP<00:05:07.380> levels<00:05:07.710> for

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:07.920 
monsters and pick our own HP levels for

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:10.910 
monsters and pick our own HP levels for
them<00:05:08.040> or<00:05:08.670> H<00:05:08.880> hit<00:05:09.270> points<00:05:09.660> I<00:05:09.780> guess<00:05:09.960> and<00:05:10.200> it

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:10.920 
them or H hit points I guess and it

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:13.400 
them or H hit points I guess and it
didn't<00:05:11.790> work<00:05:11.820> it's<00:05:12.390> there's<00:05:12.750> there's<00:05:12.810> too

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:13.410 
didn't work it's there's there's too

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:14.990 
didn't work it's there's there's too
many<00:05:13.500> things<00:05:13.710> that<00:05:13.920> just<00:05:14.100> are<00:05:14.280> so<00:05:14.550> easy<00:05:14.850> to

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:15.000 
many things that just are so easy to

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.590 
many things that just are so easy to
kill<00:05:15.150> that<00:05:16.050> on<00:05:16.170> a<00:05:16.200> challenge<00:05:16.830> anymore<00:05:17.010> and<00:05:17.610> I

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:18.600 
kill that on a challenge anymore and I

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:20.870 
kill that on a challenge anymore and I
don't<00:05:18.630> think<00:05:19.080> and<00:05:19.350> I<00:05:19.680> think<00:05:19.710> the<00:05:19.980> egg<00:05:20.130> the<00:05:20.460> XP

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:20.880 
don't think and I think the egg the XP

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:22.370 
don't think and I think the egg the XP
system<00:05:21.300> should<00:05:21.450> be<00:05:21.480> based<00:05:21.780> on<00:05:21.990> the<00:05:22.080> amount<00:05:22.230> of

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:22.380 
system should be based on the amount of

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:25.160 
system should be based on the amount of
hit<00:05:22.650> points<00:05:22.680> they<00:05:23.100> have<00:05:23.270> yeah<00:05:24.270> that's<00:05:25.020> me

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:25.170 
hit points they have yeah that's me

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:27.200 
hit points they have yeah that's me
solving<00:05:25.620> problems<00:05:26.040> again<00:05:26.370> it's<00:05:27.000> a<00:05:27.030> really

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:27.210 
solving problems again it's a really

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:29.630 
solving problems again it's a really
simple<00:05:27.420> equation<00:05:28.020> if<00:05:28.140> you<00:05:28.260> say<00:05:28.500> 9,000<00:05:29.430> is

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:29.640 
simple equation if you say 9,000 is

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:32.480 
simple equation if you say 9,000 is
equal<00:05:30.180> to<00:05:30.300> 900<00:05:30.990> then<00:05:31.260> everything<00:05:31.770> by<00:05:32.040> priyo<00:05:32.310> si

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:32.490 
equal to 900 then everything by priyo si

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:36.500 
equal to 900 then everything by priyo si
just<00:05:33.060> have<00:05:33.300> to<00:05:33.420> put<00:05:33.630> a<00:05:33.660> zero<00:05:33.930> on<00:05:34.490> anyway<00:05:35.510> I'll

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:36.510 
just have to put a zero on anyway I'll

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:37.580 
just have to put a zero on anyway I'll
see<00:05:36.570> you<00:05:36.750> guys<00:05:36.780> want<00:05:37.050> to<00:05:37.110> make<00:05:37.200> a<00:05:37.230> new<00:05:37.410> video
