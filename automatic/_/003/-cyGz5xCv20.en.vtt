00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
about intervals now what exactly are

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.890 
about intervals now what exactly are
intervals<00:00:11.490> it's<00:00:11.910> where<00:00:12.240> you<00:00:12.450> give<00:00:12.719> a<00:00:12.750> very

intervals it's where you give a very
hard<00:00:13.769> effort<00:00:14.509> stop<00:00:15.509> running<00:00:15.990> completely<00:00:16.379> and

hard effort stop running completely and

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.630 
hard effort stop running completely and
then<00:00:17.640> do<00:00:18.029> it<00:00:18.060> again<00:00:18.449> now<00:00:19.320> I've<00:00:19.650> got<00:00:19.890> five<00:00:20.250> tips

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:25.730 
in your running intervals my first tip

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:30.019 
in your running intervals my first tip
do<00:00:26.730> intervals<00:00:27.390> and<00:00:27.720> a<00:00:27.779> max<00:00:28.680> of<00:00:28.920> about<00:00:29.039> twice<00:00:29.699> a

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
do intervals and a max of about twice a

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.110 
do intervals and a max of about twice a
week<00:00:30.449> they<00:00:30.810> are<00:00:30.840> very<00:00:31.260> hard<00:00:31.619> effort<00:00:32.120> workouts

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
week they are very hard effort workouts

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.170 
week they are very hard effort workouts
and<00:00:33.829> doing<00:00:34.829> it<00:00:34.950> any<00:00:35.160> more<00:00:35.399> than<00:00:35.640> that

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
and doing it any more than that

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.880 
and doing it any more than that
might<00:00:36.329> be<00:00:36.570> pushing<00:00:36.899> the<00:00:37.170> envelope<00:00:37.320> in

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
might be pushing the envelope in

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.310 
might be pushing the envelope in
inviting<00:00:38.430> injury<00:00:39.180> there's<00:00:39.660> other<00:00:39.870> workouts

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
inviting injury there's other workouts

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.740 
inviting injury there's other workouts
you<00:00:40.469> can<00:00:40.649> do<00:00:40.800> that<00:00:40.950> aren't<00:00:41.370> intervals<00:00:41.850> that

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
you can do that aren't intervals that

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.690 
you can do that aren't intervals that
won't<00:00:43.079> tax<00:00:43.410> your<00:00:43.620> body<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:44.010> same<00:00:44.250> way<00:00:44.309> that

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
your your intervals so do a warm-up also

for<00:01:09.930> intervals<00:01:10.530> that's<00:01:11.130> very<00:01:11.580> important<00:01:12.210> is

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
for intervals that's very important is

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.050 
for intervals that's very important is
determining<00:01:13.740> what<00:01:14.040> type<00:01:14.280> of<00:01:14.310> interval<00:01:14.850> you're

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
determining what type of interval you're

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.510 
determining what type of interval you're
going<00:01:15.240> to<00:01:15.299> do<00:01:15.509> now<00:01:16.439> early<00:01:16.950> in<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.280> season

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
going to do now early in the season

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.609 
going to do now early in the season
let's<00:01:18.180> say<00:01:18.390> I'm<00:01:18.479> in<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:18.630> track<00:01:18.990> season<00:01:19.290> I

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
let's say I'm in the track season I

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.450 
let's say I'm in the track season I
typically<00:01:20.520> would<00:01:21.360> do<00:01:21.570> longer<00:01:22.170> intervals<00:01:23.009> not

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
typically would do longer intervals not

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.469 
typically would do longer intervals not
as<00:01:23.820> fast<00:01:24.450> and<00:01:24.960> as<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.680> season<00:01:26.070> progresses<00:01:26.479> the

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
as fast and as the season progresses the

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.690 
as fast and as the season progresses the
intervals<00:01:27.960> would<00:01:28.290> get<00:01:28.500> shorter<00:01:29.100> but<00:01:29.310> much

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
intervals would get shorter but much

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.710 
intervals would get shorter but much
faster<00:01:30.689> as<00:01:30.869> I<00:01:30.930> sharpen<00:01:31.619> my<00:01:31.650> speed<00:01:32.250> so<00:01:32.790> for

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
faster as I sharpen my speed so for

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.810 
faster as I sharpen my speed so for
instance<00:01:34.049> early<00:01:34.530> in<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.799> season<00:01:35.009> maybe<00:01:35.400> mile

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
instance early in the season maybe mile

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.050 
instance early in the season maybe mile
repeats<00:01:36.240> and<00:01:36.990> then<00:01:37.710> towards<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.340> end<00:01:38.460> of<00:01:38.909> the

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
repeats and then towards the end of the

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.889 
repeats and then towards the end of the
season<00:01:39.659> for<00:01:40.250> hundreds<00:01:41.329> over<00:01:42.329> and<00:01:42.479> over<00:01:42.750> again

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
season for hundreds over and over again

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.109 
season for hundreds over and over again
there's<00:01:43.500> also<00:01:43.770> other<00:01:44.100> interval<00:01:44.640> workouts

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
there's also other interval workouts

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.510 
there's also other interval workouts
like<00:01:45.420> where<00:01:46.170> you<00:01:46.380> call<00:01:46.649> them<00:01:46.740> ladders<00:01:47.159> you<00:01:47.189> go

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
like where you call them ladders you go

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.330 
like where you call them ladders you go
up<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:47.790> ladder<00:01:47.939> like<00:01:48.210> 100<00:01:48.720> 200<00:01:49.200> 300<00:01:49.649> 400<00:01:49.890> or

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
up the ladder like 100 200 300 400 or

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.289 
up the ladder like 100 200 300 400 or
cut<00:01:51.299> downs<00:01:51.540> you<00:01:51.960> start<00:01:52.259> at<00:01:52.350> 800<00:01:52.950> then<00:01:53.070> 600<00:01:53.729> 400

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
cut downs you start at 800 then 600 400

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:54.950

200

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.450 
200
there's<00:01:55.409> a<00:01:55.500> lot<00:01:55.680> of<00:01:55.799> different<00:01:56.070> types<00:01:56.250> of

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
there's a lot of different types of

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.730 
there's a lot of different types of
intervals<00:01:56.850> but<00:01:57.659> nonetheless<00:01:57.869> I<00:01:58.320> suggest

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
intervals but nonetheless I suggest

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.469 
intervals but nonetheless I suggest
longer<00:01:59.219> ones<00:01:59.460> at<00:01:59.700> the<00:01:59.820> start<00:02:00.119> of<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:00.299> season

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
longer ones at the start of the season

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.350 
longer ones at the start of the season
and<00:02:00.810> then<00:02:01.590> shorter<00:02:02.189> ones<00:02:02.430> towards<00:02:02.909> the<00:02:03.090> end<00:02:03.210> of

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
and then shorter ones towards the end of

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.179 
and then shorter ones towards the end of
the<00:02:03.450> season<00:02:03.840> that<00:02:03.869> are<00:02:04.049> faster<00:02:04.590> paced<00:02:04.829> my

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
the season that are faster paced my

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:08.869 
the season that are faster paced my

time<00:02:09.959> I<00:02:10.379> actually<00:02:11.099> suggest<00:02:11.580> less<00:02:12.480> rest<00:02:12.989> time

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:13.379 
time I actually suggest less rest time

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:16.729 
time I actually suggest less rest time
early<00:02:14.040> in<00:02:14.069> the<00:02:14.310> season<00:02:14.580> and<00:02:14.940> more<00:02:15.900> rest<00:02:16.379> time

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 
early in the season and more rest time

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:19.550 
early in the season and more rest time
later<00:02:17.549> in<00:02:17.790> the<00:02:17.909> season<00:02:18.150> let's<00:02:18.989> go<00:02:19.140> back<00:02:19.379> to

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
later in the season let's go back to

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.309 
later in the season let's go back to
mild<00:02:20.040> repeat<00:02:20.580> intervals<00:02:21.090> early<00:02:22.049> in<00:02:22.170> the

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
mild repeat intervals early in the

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:24.710 
mild repeat intervals early in the
season<00:02:22.769> I<00:02:22.860> suggest<00:02:23.310> you<00:02:23.489> run<00:02:23.640> a<00:02:23.700> mile<00:02:24.120> repeat

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
season I suggest you run a mile repeat

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.039 
season I suggest you run a mile repeat
at<00:02:24.930> a<00:02:25.010> decent<00:02:26.010> pace<00:02:26.519> but<00:02:27.330> then<00:02:27.510> only<00:02:27.750> give

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:28.049 
at a decent pace but then only give

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:31.460 
at a decent pace but then only give
yourself<00:02:28.410> one<00:02:28.799> minute<00:02:29.459> of<00:02:29.580> rest<00:02:30.000> and<00:02:30.450> then<00:02:31.200> run

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
yourself one minute of rest and then run

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.970 
yourself one minute of rest and then run
that<00:02:31.500> mile<00:02:31.890> repeat<00:02:32.430> again<00:02:33.000> at<00:02:33.629> a<00:02:33.810> decent<00:02:34.769> pace

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
that mile repeat again at a decent pace

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.569 
that mile repeat again at a decent pace
later<00:02:35.640> in<00:02:35.849> the<00:02:35.970> season<00:02:36.180> I'll<00:02:36.780> run<00:02:37.200> a<00:02:37.230> fast<00:02:37.890> one

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:38.579 
later in the season I'll run a fast one

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:42.380 
later in the season I'll run a fast one
mile<00:02:38.909> repeat<00:02:39.510> then<00:02:40.170> get<00:02:40.530> full<00:02:40.950> recovery<00:02:41.579> full

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
mile repeat then get full recovery full

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:43.910 
mile repeat then get full recovery full
recovery<00:02:42.930> is<00:02:43.079> when<00:02:43.290> you<00:02:43.379> give<00:02:43.530> yourself

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
recovery is when you give yourself

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.280 
recovery is when you give yourself
probably<00:02:44.340> about<00:02:44.519> equal<00:02:45.060> rest<00:02:45.390> from<00:02:45.959> whatever

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
probably about equal rest from whatever

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:47.569 
probably about equal rest from whatever
your<00:02:46.470> interval<00:02:46.769> so<00:02:46.920> let's<00:02:47.069> say<00:02:47.220> I<00:02:47.250> run<00:02:47.430> the

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:47.579 
your interval so let's say I run the

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:49.729 
your interval so let's say I run the
mile<00:02:47.760> in<00:02:47.940> five<00:02:48.180> minutes<00:02:48.629> then<00:02:49.470> I'm<00:02:49.590> going<00:02:49.709> to

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
mile in five minutes then I'm going to

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:52.130 
mile in five minutes then I'm going to
get<00:02:49.829> five<00:02:50.310> minutes<00:02:50.970> of<00:02:51.120> rest<00:02:51.359> then<00:02:51.959> I<00:02:51.989> do

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
get five minutes of rest then I do

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.740 
get five minutes of rest then I do
another<00:02:52.500> mile<00:02:52.950> interval<00:02:53.760> so<00:02:54.390> that's<00:02:54.629> an

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
another mile interval so that's an

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.869 
another mile interval so that's an
example<00:02:55.109> of<00:02:55.379> how<00:02:55.530> you're<00:02:55.799> faster<00:02:56.370> but<00:02:56.640> you<00:02:56.670> get

00:02:56.869 --> 00:02:56.879 
example of how you're faster but you get

00:02:56.879 --> 00:02:59.360 
example of how you're faster but you get
more<00:02:57.090> rest<00:02:57.329> time<00:02:57.709> another<00:02:58.709> example<00:02:59.220> would<00:02:59.310> be

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
more rest time another example would be

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.199 
more rest time another example would be
400<00:03:00.180> repeats<00:03:00.950> early<00:03:01.950> in<00:03:02.069> the<00:03:02.190> season<00:03:02.459> we'll

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
400 repeats early in the season we'll

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:06.199 
400 repeats early in the season we'll
say<00:03:03.569> we're<00:03:03.930> doing<00:03:04.200> 400<00:03:05.010> repeats<00:03:05.489> at<00:03:05.790> a<00:03:05.819> slower

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
say we're doing 400 repeats at a slower

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:08.300 
say we're doing 400 repeats at a slower
pace<00:03:06.329> and<00:03:06.840> you<00:03:06.930> get<00:03:07.079> thirty<00:03:07.440> seconds<00:03:07.980> of<00:03:08.099> rest

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
pace and you get thirty seconds of rest

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.759 
pace and you get thirty seconds of rest
later<00:03:09.269> in<00:03:09.569> the<00:03:09.720> season<00:03:09.959> maybe<00:03:10.379> you're<00:03:10.560> doing

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
later in the season maybe you're doing

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:14.000 
later in the season maybe you're doing
for<00:03:11.099> hundreds<00:03:11.459> really<00:03:11.849> hard<00:03:12.120> and<00:03:12.420> you<00:03:13.170> get<00:03:13.379> 60

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
for hundreds really hard and you get 60

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.180 
for hundreds really hard and you get 60
or<00:03:14.280> 90<00:03:14.310> seconds<00:03:15.269> of<00:03:15.419> rest<00:03:15.660> so<00:03:16.069> managing<00:03:17.069> your

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
or 90 seconds of rest so managing your

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.849 
or 90 seconds of rest so managing your
rest<00:03:17.430> time<00:03:17.700> I<00:03:17.730> suggest<00:03:18.329> shorter<00:03:18.810> earlier<00:03:19.709> in

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:19.859 
rest time I suggest shorter earlier in

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:22.129 
rest time I suggest shorter earlier in
the<00:03:19.950> season<00:03:20.160> and<00:03:20.430> longer<00:03:21.060> rest<00:03:21.299> time<00:03:21.510> later<00:03:21.900> in

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:22.139 
the season and longer rest time later in

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:23.509 
the season and longer rest time later in
the<00:03:22.260> season<00:03:22.650> when<00:03:22.769> you're<00:03:22.919> sharpening<00:03:23.280> your

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
the season when you're sharpening your

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:27.050 
the season when you're sharpening your
speed<00:03:23.910> and<00:03:24.180> finally<00:03:24.989> my<00:03:25.410> fifth<00:03:25.889> tip<00:03:26.370> for

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
speed and finally my fifth tip for

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.900 
speed and finally my fifth tip for
running<00:03:27.569> intervals<00:03:27.900> is<00:03:28.349> to<00:03:28.829> make<00:03:29.340> sure<00:03:29.370> you<00:03:29.730> do

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
running intervals is to make sure you do

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.680 
running intervals is to make sure you do
a<00:03:29.940> cool-down<00:03:30.540> run<00:03:31.319> and<00:03:31.680> stretch<00:03:32.190> it<00:03:32.430> out<00:03:32.690> since

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
a cool-down run and stretch it out since

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.199 
a cool-down run and stretch it out since
you're<00:03:33.870> giving<00:03:34.049> a<00:03:34.380> very<00:03:34.799> good<00:03:35.069> effort<00:03:35.310> for

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
you're giving a very good effort for

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:38.449 
you're giving a very good effort for
interval<00:03:36.690> runs<00:03:36.989> you<00:03:37.500> really<00:03:37.889> need<00:03:38.099> to<00:03:38.280> make

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
interval runs you really need to make

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:40.839 
interval runs you really need to make
sure<00:03:38.519> that<00:03:38.970> you<00:03:39.090> get<00:03:39.269> your<00:03:39.480> legs<00:03:39.720> nice<00:03:40.049> and<00:03:40.079> and

00:03:40.839 --> 00:03:40.849 
sure that you get your legs nice and and

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:43.970 
sure that you get your legs nice and and
cooled<00:03:41.849> off<00:03:42.090> try<00:03:42.870> and<00:03:42.989> get<00:03:43.109> rid<00:03:43.139> of<00:03:43.380> a<00:03:43.560> lot<00:03:43.769> of

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
cooled off try and get rid of a lot of

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.690 
cooled off try and get rid of a lot of
those<00:03:44.540> problems<00:03:45.540> or<00:03:45.989> tight<00:03:46.560> spots<00:03:46.919> or<00:03:47.190> lactic

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
those problems or tight spots or lactic

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.960 
those problems or tight spots or lactic
acid<00:03:48.180> in<00:03:48.780> your<00:03:48.840> body<00:03:49.049> so<00:03:49.709> you<00:03:49.769> recover<00:03:50.400> quicker

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
acid in your body so you recover quicker

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:54.229 
acid in your body so you recover quicker
an<00:03:51.560> interval<00:03:52.560> will<00:03:52.889> damage<00:03:53.340> your<00:03:53.730> legs<00:03:54.000> a

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
an interval will damage your legs a

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:56.150 
an interval will damage your legs a
little<00:03:54.419> bit<00:03:54.690> but<00:03:55.230> that's<00:03:55.440> good

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
little bit but that's good

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.210 
little bit but that's good
because<00:03:56.910> when<00:03:57.510> you<00:03:57.690> rest<00:03:58.109> and<00:03:58.500> you<00:03:58.560> cool<00:03:58.889> down

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
because when you rest and you cool down

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.390 
because when you rest and you cool down
it<00:03:59.519> builds<00:03:59.790> itself<00:04:00.569> back<00:04:00.900> up<00:04:01.010> stronger<00:04:02.010> so

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
it builds itself back up stronger so

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.750 
it builds itself back up stronger so
those<00:04:03.269> are<00:04:03.450> my<00:04:03.569> five<00:04:03.810> tips<00:04:04.169> for<00:04:04.319> intervals<00:04:05.010> now

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
those are my five tips for intervals now

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.689 
those are my five tips for intervals now
go<00:04:06.150> out<00:04:06.329> there<00:04:06.590> give<00:04:07.590> out<00:04:07.739> a<00:04:07.769> good<00:04:08.160> effort<00:04:08.549> and

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:08.699 
go out there give out a good effort and

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:11.599 
go out there give out a good effort and
see<00:04:08.940> what<00:04:09.120> you're<00:04:09.299> made<00:04:09.569> of
