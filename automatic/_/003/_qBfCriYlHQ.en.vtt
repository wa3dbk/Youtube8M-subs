scientists<00:00:00.840> have<00:00:00.960> concluded<00:00:01.199> that<00:00:01.500> they<00:00:01.829> went

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:02.040 
scientists have concluded that they went

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.560 
scientists have concluded that they went
back<00:00:02.250> to<00:00:02.280> the<00:00:02.550> laboratory<00:00:02.730> and<00:00:03.179> made<00:00:03.330> some

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:03.570 
back to the laboratory and made some

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.440 
back to the laboratory and made some
more<00:00:03.980> like<00:00:04.980> we<00:00:05.130> make<00:00:05.310> potato<00:00:05.670> chips<00:00:05.970> you<00:00:06.240> see

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450 
more like we make potato chips you see

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.810 
more like we make potato chips you see
and<00:00:07.319> that<00:00:07.529> sounds<00:00:07.919> awfully<00:00:08.250> cold<00:00:08.460> blooded

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
and that sounds awfully cold blooded

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.900 
and that sounds awfully cold blooded
doesn't<00:00:09.360> it<00:00:09.510> but<00:00:10.469> it<00:00:10.620> isn't<00:00:10.800> when<00:00:11.190> you<00:00:11.700> can

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
doesn't it but it isn't when you can

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.460 
doesn't it but it isn't when you can
manufacture<00:00:12.269> a<00:00:12.690> living<00:00:13.259> creature<00:00:15.470> biological

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
manufacture a living creature biological

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:22.310 
manufacture a living creature biological
Android<00:00:17.010> as<00:00:17.310> it<00:00:17.520> were<00:00:17.699> in<00:00:18.240> a<00:00:18.539> laboratory<00:00:21.320> and

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
Android as it were in a laboratory and

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.400 
Android as it were in a laboratory and
we<00:00:22.439> can<00:00:22.590> do<00:00:22.740> that<00:00:22.890> now<00:00:23.100> can't<00:00:23.430> we<00:00:23.869> we<00:00:24.869> who<00:00:25.350> are

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
we can do that now can't we we who are

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.620 
we can do that now can't we we who are

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:49.070 
Christian fundamentalists would have a

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:54.590 
Christian fundamentalists would have a
fit<00:00:50.070> over<00:00:50.340> if<00:00:50.700> they<00:00:50.910> knew<00:00:51.120> about<00:00:51.860> we<00:00:53.030> get<00:00:54.030> we

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
fit over if they knew about we get we

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.310 
fit over if they knew about we get we
are<00:00:55.190> cloning<00:00:56.190> human<00:00:56.640> beings<00:00:57.500> and<00:00:58.500> that's

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320 
are cloning human beings and that's

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:05.210 
are cloning human beings and that's
that's<00:01:01.320> just<00:01:01.879> science<00:01:03.619> we're<00:01:04.619> doing<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:05.010> same

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
that's just science we're doing the same

is<00:02:08.310> a<00:02:08.369> reality<00:02:08.880> now<00:02:09.840> you<00:02:09.899> see<00:02:10.350> that<00:02:11.310> in<00:02:11.610> itself

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
is a reality now you see that in itself

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.510 
is a reality now you see that in itself
is<00:02:12.420> sensitive<00:02:13.110> how<00:02:13.290> do<00:02:13.350> you<00:02:13.620> go<00:02:13.800> tell<00:02:14.100> that<00:02:14.130> to

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
is sensitive how do you go tell that to

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.110 
is sensitive how do you go tell that to
Joe<00:02:14.730> Sixpack<00:02:15.180> out<00:02:15.780> there<00:02:16.670> how<00:02:17.670> do<00:02:17.730> you<00:02:17.910> tell

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
fundamentals well as I jokingly have

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.120 
fundamentals well as I jokingly have
said<00:02:27.570> when<00:02:27.840> I<00:02:27.930> was<00:02:28.110> speaking<00:02:28.560> over<00:02:28.890> in<00:02:28.980> Dallas

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
said when I was speaking over in Dallas

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.160 
said when I was speaking over in Dallas
you<00:02:29.550> look<00:02:29.790> for<00:02:30.000> the<00:02:30.030> door<00:02:30.300> and<00:02:30.630> you<00:02:30.720> check<00:02:31.020> the

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
you look for the door and you check the

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.320 
you look for the door and you check the
windows<00:02:31.380> so<00:02:31.800> you<00:02:31.830> can<00:02:32.130> find<00:02:32.370> a<00:02:32.489> way<00:02:32.520> they<00:02:32.850> get

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
windows so you can find a way they get

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.900 
windows so you can find a way they get
the<00:02:33.480> hell<00:02:33.660> out<00:02:33.900> of<00:02:33.930> here<00:02:34.260> if<00:02:34.890> the<00:02:35.190> chairs<00:02:35.520> start

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
the hell out of here if the chairs start

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.710 
the hell out of here if the chairs start
flying<00:02:37.370> because<00:02:38.370> I<00:02:38.489> did<00:02:38.760> that<00:02:39.000> in<00:02:39.150> Dallas<00:02:39.570> a

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
flying because I did that in Dallas a
