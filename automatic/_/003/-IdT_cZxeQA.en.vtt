into a video game I mean you're shooting

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.730 
into a video game I mean you're shooting
off<00:01:20.909> a<00:01:20.939> white<00:01:21.240> that's<00:01:21.689> not<00:01:21.960> too<00:01:22.229> difficult<00:01:22.439> for

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
off a white that's not too difficult for

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.560 
off a white that's not too difficult for
a<00:01:22.920> developer<00:01:23.130> to<00:01:23.340> put<00:01:23.430> in<00:01:23.700> there<00:01:23.850> I<00:01:24.030> feel<00:01:24.509> like

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
situations and really encourage stealth

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.100 
situations and really encourage stealth
gameplay<00:01:29.610> which<00:01:30.329> is<00:01:30.479> something<00:01:30.689> that<00:01:30.810> an

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
gameplay which is something that an

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.560 
gameplay which is something that an
honesty<00:01:31.740> a<00:01:31.770> fault<00:01:32.130> game<00:01:32.340> should<00:01:32.670> encourage

00:02:53.399 --> 00:02:53.409 
areas when it would just be kind of

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:54.839 
areas when it would just be kind of
stopping<00:02:53.829> you<00:02:53.889> at<00:02:54.010> a<00:02:54.040> random<00:02:54.280> point<00:02:54.609> on<00:02:54.760> the

00:02:54.839 --> 00:02:54.849 
stopping you at a random point on the

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:56.819 
stopping you at a random point on the
map<00:02:54.879> but<00:02:55.599> I<00:02:55.629> do<00:02:55.719> agree<00:02:55.959> that<00:02:56.319> something<00:02:56.620> like

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:56.829 
map but I do agree that something like

00:02:56.829 --> 00:02:59.099 
map but I do agree that something like
this<00:02:57.010> would<00:02:57.189> kind<00:02:57.400> of<00:02:57.459> make<00:02:57.639> it<00:02:57.819> less<00:02:58.030> of<00:02:58.060> a<00:02:58.359> put

00:02:59.099 --> 00:02:59.109 
this would kind of make it less of a put

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:00.420 
this would kind of make it less of a put
down<00:02:59.230> the<00:02:59.379> controller<00:02:59.500> moment<00:03:00.159> and<00:03:00.250> let<00:03:00.340> me

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
down the controller moment and let me

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:01.920 
down the controller moment and let me
text<00:03:00.639> my<00:03:00.730> friends<00:03:00.909> back<00:03:01.180> in<00:03:01.209> more<00:03:01.510> of<00:03:01.599> the<00:03:01.629> I

text my friends back in more of the I

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
don't want to put my controller back and

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.159 
don't want to put my controller back and
kit<00:03:03.459> put<00:03:03.879> my<00:03:04.060> controller<00:03:04.419> down<00:03:04.629> I<00:03:04.689> mean<00:03:04.989> in

case I get ambushed I feel like that

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:08.640 
case I get ambushed I feel like that
would<00:03:07.359> really<00:03:07.629> keep<00:03:08.019> you<00:03:08.109> immersed<00:03:08.349> in<00:03:08.530> the

would really keep you immersed in the

game and I think to myself if I'm in
developer<00:03:10.840> like<00:03:10.989> I<00:03:11.109> want<00:03:11.319> to<00:03:11.379> make<00:03:11.500> sure<00:03:11.530> the

too<00:03:44.799> short<00:03:45.220> now<00:03:45.669> here's<00:03:46.000> the<00:03:46.180> idea<00:03:46.329> i<00:03:46.599> had<00:03:46.840> when

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989 
too short now here's the idea i had when

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:49.649 
too short now here's the idea i had when
i<00:03:47.019> saw<00:03:47.349> this<00:03:47.560> comment<00:03:48.040> i<00:03:48.129> was<00:03:48.159> like<00:03:48.400> this<00:03:49.389> would

00:03:49.649 --> 00:03:49.659 
i saw this comment i was like this would

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:51.899 
i saw this comment i was like this would
be<00:03:49.810> so<00:03:50.109> cool<00:03:50.409> if<00:03:50.470> they<00:03:50.709> did<00:03:50.919> this<00:03:51.099> how<00:03:51.669> about

00:03:51.899 --> 00:03:51.909 
be so cool if they did this how about

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:54.449 
be so cool if they did this how about
making<00:03:52.569> the<00:03:52.720> lore<00:03:52.959> almost<00:03:53.439> like<00:03:53.590> interactive

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:54.459 
making the lore almost like interactive

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:56.670 
making the lore almost like interactive

in a way we're in certain vault or
certain<00:03:57.040> areas<00:03:57.370> i<00:03:57.489> maybe<00:03:57.669> can<00:03:57.909> find<00:03:58.180> a<00:03:58.299> way<00:03:58.329> to

00:03:58.499 --> 00:03:58.509 
certain areas i maybe can find a way to

00:03:58.509 --> 00:04:00.929 
certain areas i maybe can find a way to
activate<00:03:58.840> certain<00:03:59.500> simulators<00:04:00.129> and<00:04:00.159> really

00:04:00.929 --> 00:04:00.939 
activate certain simulators and really

00:04:00.939 --> 00:04:02.819 
activate certain simulators and really
completely<00:04:01.479> experience<00:04:02.290> something<00:04:02.709> that

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:02.829 
completely experience something that

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:05.189 
completely experience something that
happened<00:04:03.340> years<00:04:03.579> ago<00:04:03.699> in<00:04:04.209> a<00:04:04.599> different<00:04:04.989> area

00:04:05.189 --> 00:04:05.199 
happened years ago in a different area

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:06.539 
happened years ago in a different area
and<00:04:05.500> make<00:04:05.889> them<00:04:06.040> these<00:04:06.159> short<00:04:06.489> little

00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:06.549 
and make them these short little

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:08.280 
and make them these short little
simulations<00:04:07.449> to<00:04:07.540> kind<00:04:07.780> of<00:04:07.840> give<00:04:08.019> me<00:04:08.139> this

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290 
simulations to kind of give me this

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:10.469 
simulations to kind of give me this
immersive<00:04:08.650> storytelling<00:04:09.099> experience<00:04:09.579> but

00:04:10.469 --> 00:04:10.479 
immersive storytelling experience but

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:12.390 
immersive storytelling experience but
almost<00:04:10.870> like<00:04:11.079> teaching<00:04:11.379> me<00:04:11.620> law<00:04:11.859> at<00:04:12.039> the<00:04:12.159> same

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
almost like teaching me law at the same

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:13.649 
almost like teaching me law at the same
time<00:04:12.609> because<00:04:12.819> you<00:04:13.030> know<00:04:13.150> a<00:04:13.180> lot<00:04:13.419> of<00:04:13.449> lawyers

00:04:13.649 --> 00:04:13.659 
time because you know a lot of lawyers

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:15.539 
time because you know a lot of lawyers

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:17.610 
learn through books reading the data
section<00:04:16.060> in<00:04:16.150> your<00:04:16.299> pip-boy<00:04:16.539> i<00:04:17.019> feel<00:04:17.440> like<00:04:17.530> this

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:17.620 
section in your pip-boy i feel like this

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.110 
section in your pip-boy i feel like this
would<00:04:17.709> be<00:04:17.829> a<00:04:17.859> cool<00:04:18.190> way<00:04:18.310> to<00:04:18.340> learn<00:04:18.579> its<00:04:18.880> kind<00:04:19.060> of

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:19.120 
would be a cool way to learn its kind of

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:20.729 
would be a cool way to learn its kind of
implementing<00:04:19.659> these<00:04:19.810> simulators<00:04:20.380> that<00:04:20.500> we

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739 
implementing these simulators that we

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:22.950 
implementing these simulators that we
saw<00:04:21.009> in<00:04:21.219> operation<00:04:22.060> anchorage<00:04:22.479> or<00:04:22.659> we<00:04:22.779> saw

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
saw in operation anchorage or we saw

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.480 
saw in operation anchorage or we saw
throughout<00:04:23.380> New<00:04:23.590> Vegas<00:04:23.770> I<00:04:24.099> think<00:04:24.130> it<00:04:24.370> would<00:04:24.460> be

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:24.490 
throughout New Vegas I think it would be

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:26.980 
throughout New Vegas I think it would be
awesome<00:04:24.729> to<00:04:25.270> see<00:04:25.690> it<00:04:25.779> kind<00:04:26.080> of<00:04:26.199> implemented

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:26.990 
awesome to see it kind of implemented

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:28.300 
awesome to see it kind of implemented
this<00:04:27.229> way<00:04:27.410> i<00:04:27.440> feel<00:04:27.710> like<00:04:27.889> this<00:04:28.009> is<00:04:28.069> one<00:04:28.160> of<00:04:28.190> the

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:28.310 
this way i feel like this is one of the

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:30.040 
this way i feel like this is one of the
more<00:04:28.490> better<00:04:28.759> ideas<00:04:29.210> I've<00:04:29.360> came<00:04:29.569> up<00:04:29.720> with<00:04:29.870> in<00:04:29.990> a

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050 
more better ideas I've came up with in a

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:32.559 
more better ideas I've came up with in a
while<00:04:30.259> and<00:04:30.530> I<00:04:31.160> really<00:04:31.610> liked<00:04:31.880> this<00:04:32.030> idea<00:04:32.240> of

00:04:32.559 --> 00:04:32.569 
while and I really liked this idea of

00:04:32.569 --> 00:04:34.719 
while and I really liked this idea of
adding<00:04:33.020> simulators<00:04:33.680> in<00:04:33.800> a<00:04:34.190> certain<00:04:34.430> way<00:04:34.580> so

00:04:34.719 --> 00:04:34.729 
adding simulators in a certain way so

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:36.580 
adding simulators in a certain way so
that<00:04:34.970> we<00:04:35.180> can<00:04:35.330> experience<00:04:35.720> certain<00:04:36.229> events<00:04:36.530> in

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590 
that we can experience certain events in

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:38.860 
that we can experience certain events in
the<00:04:36.650> fall<00:04:36.860> world<00:04:37.310> without<00:04:37.580> having<00:04:38.210> sacrifices

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:38.870 
the fall world without having sacrifices

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:40.809 
the fall world without having sacrifices
of<00:04:38.990> an<00:04:39.080> entire<00:04:39.410> game<00:04:39.710> being<00:04:39.979> set<00:04:40.310> in<00:04:40.340> that<00:04:40.460> area

00:04:40.809 --> 00:04:40.819 
of an entire game being set in that area

00:04:40.819 --> 00:04:42.520
