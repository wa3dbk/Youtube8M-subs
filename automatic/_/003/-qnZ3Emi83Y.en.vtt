00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
the Antichrist but this is about

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.920 
the Antichrist but this is about
something<00:01:11.100> much<00:01:11.430> more<00:01:11.760> important<00:01:12.750> and

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
something much more important and

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.160 
something much more important and
foundational<00:01:13.409> that<00:01:14.189> because<00:01:15.000> it's<00:01:15.270> ethical<00:01:15.930> I

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
foundational that because it's ethical I

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.170 
foundational that because it's ethical I
can<00:01:16.770> talked<00:01:17.009> about<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.430> Antichrist<00:01:17.729> where<00:01:18.119> we

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
can talked about the Antichrist where we

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.179 
can talked about the Antichrist where we
may<00:01:18.330> agree<00:01:18.540> or<00:01:18.630> disagree<00:01:18.810> well<00:01:19.350> it<00:01:19.920> doesn't

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
may agree or disagree well it doesn't

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.969 
may agree or disagree well it doesn't
have<00:01:20.490> great<00:01:20.909> ethical<00:01:21.450> consequence<00:01:22.110> but<00:01:22.860> the

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
have great ethical consequence but the

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.630 
have great ethical consequence but the
issue<00:01:23.220> of<00:01:23.670> Israel<00:01:24.240> does<00:01:24.600> and<00:01:25.250> let<00:01:26.250> me<00:01:26.369> put<00:01:26.549> it

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
issue of Israel does and let me put it

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.469 
issue of Israel does and let me put it
this<00:01:26.759> way<00:01:26.820> sort<00:01:27.270> of<00:01:27.299> a<00:01:27.450> logical<00:01:28.909> pattern<00:01:29.909> here

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
this way sort of a logical pattern here

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.960 
this way sort of a logical pattern here
during<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.409> centuries<00:01:31.890> I<00:01:32.220> think<00:01:32.759> I've<00:01:32.850> been

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
during the centuries I think I've been

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.940 
during the centuries I think I've been
that<00:01:33.090> kind<00:01:33.240> of<00:01:33.360> before<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:34.409> treatment<00:01:34.860> the

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
that kind of before the treatment the

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.469 
that kind of before the treatment the
Jewish<00:01:35.220> people<00:01:35.579> right<00:01:35.790> from<00:01:36.000> the<00:01:36.090> second

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479

century on even to the present has been

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.660 
century on even to the present has been
bad<00:01:38.729> he's<00:01:39.540> not<00:01:39.600> just<00:01:40.079> slightly<00:01:40.560> off<00:01:40.740> it's<00:01:41.250> very

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
bad he's not just slightly off it's very

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.510 
bad he's not just slightly off it's very
very<00:01:42.060> bad<00:01:42.329> and<00:01:42.680> the<00:01:43.680> history<00:01:44.070> books<00:01:44.280> whether

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
very bad and the history books whether

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.880 
very bad and the history books whether
they're<00:01:44.820> conservative<00:01:45.420> or<00:01:45.750> they're<00:01:46.350> liberal

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
they all come out basically with the

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.350 
they all come out basically with the
clear<00:01:51.930> evidence<00:01:52.380> that<00:01:52.909> Christendom<00:01:53.909> over<00:01:54.180> the

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
clear evidence that Christendom over the

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.420 
clear evidence that Christendom over the
centuries<00:01:54.840> has<00:01:55.079> missed<00:01:55.470> true<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:55.920> Jewish

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
centuries has missed true the Jewish

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.480 
centuries has missed true the Jewish
people<00:01:56.759> terribly<00:01:57.659> and<00:01:57.899> it's<00:01:58.500> even<00:01:58.920> I<00:01:59.070> think

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
people terribly and it's even I think

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.179 
people terribly and it's even I think
not<00:01:59.790> an<00:01:59.909> overstatement<00:02:00.180> to<00:02:00.600> say<00:02:00.689> then<00:02:01.350> even<00:02:02.070> as

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
not an overstatement to say then even as

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.560 
not an overstatement to say then even as
flow-through<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.969> Protestant<00:02:03.450> Reformation

people it's in the mainstream especially
I<00:06:05.850> mentioned<00:06:06.360> again<00:06:06.660> those<00:06:06.930> major<00:06:07.320> group<00:06:07.650> of

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:07.680 
I mentioned again those major group of

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:10.970 
I mentioned again those major group of
Catholic<00:06:07.950> or<00:06:08.700> Protestant<00:06:09.180> but<00:06:09.780> you<00:06:10.200> know<00:06:10.350> and

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:10.980 
Catholic or Protestant but you know and

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:13.200 
how does that evidence itself that lack

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:15.950 
how does that evidence itself that lack
of<00:06:13.850> indifference<00:06:14.850> is<00:06:15.060> probably<00:06:15.570> putting<00:06:15.840> it

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:15.960 
of indifference is probably putting it

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:18.650 
of indifference is probably putting it
mildly<00:06:16.520> you<00:06:17.520> talk<00:06:17.790> to<00:06:17.940> them<00:06:18.090> and<00:06:18.240> they'll<00:06:18.420> say

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:18.660 
mildly you talk to them and they'll say

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:20.159 
mildly you talk to them and they'll say
well<00:06:18.840> of<00:06:18.990> course<00:06:19.050> God<00:06:19.410> hasn't<00:06:19.590> got<00:06:19.800> me

00:06:22.559 --> 00:06:22.569 
is rather though I mean when that sort

00:06:22.569 --> 00:06:25.350 
is rather though I mean when that sort
