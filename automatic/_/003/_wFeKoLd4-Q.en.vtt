00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:05.040
 beautiful all the guys in this new one 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.319
 video we are the second tutorial of the 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.349
 odyssey channel i will teach you how to make a 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.690
 bonfire lit is a novelty of minecraft 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.309
 I don't know 1 English youtuber did it for 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.750
 first in the canal I wanted to bring it too 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:20.400
 here and it's very cool you can do it 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.859
 just 1.8 because to do it 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.019
 will need armor supports and 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:29.640
 also of the slides then we have to do 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:33.110
 a 2x3 hole in this way two deep 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:38.129
 block now here really disgusts me 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:40.910
 see that couple is but you can too 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.050
 don't do blades and make a hole here 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.700
 now you have to go and get some 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:49.050
 stone walls put in this 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:51.840
 way a bed towards the water ee 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:55.289
 towards the walls we will then go and get it 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.510
 a block will like that we can go to 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:00.870
 take it in the area so we're on the subject 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:03.149
 and we put it in this position here 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.619
 then we take other pebbles 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:08.280
 we put them in this other position 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:10.320
 let's get some water in here 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.850
 let's take pleasure blocks that 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.790
 let's put in some time later we have to 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.320
 go get rid now you have to 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.030
 use armor supports you must 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.340
 put them for exactly how I put them 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:24.750
 I must first of all be in this 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:27.720
 way is to put the first the second of 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:30.600
 stand at an angle and put them in iii 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.479
 in front perpendicularly the fourth ed 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:36.060
 last stay a little turned towards this 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.970
 I as we shall see will be formed like a 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.710
 circle a cool crazy now 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.470
 we should go do a lot 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.659
 fast then we should turn off the water 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.180
 here and when you will jump 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:51.030
 we will have to go and put a source of 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.250
 water and here where we were put first 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.439
 now these blocks we can also 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.079
 take them off 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:00.840
 and now we have to take this away 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:04.020
 sand wall this wall of 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:06.479
 rock and quickly put the lava e 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.069
 as you see the phallus lights up but 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.170
 now about you and how they put you 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.760
 block here is the phallus after it gets ruined 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.909
 we have to go and do 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:17.250
 such stuff I will do with 

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:21.209
 the sandstone we will have to go for a 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:22.620
 block above the only put here of the 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:28.920
 slide bloc 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:31.560
 that way i got it wrong and then go 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.599
 to make everyone so put a piston 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:38.000
 sticky in this way towards the 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:42.060
 low go get a button that 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.790
 an equal button go and put it here 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:48.690
 and as soon as we push it we must break 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.440
 immediately the pil as the piston is said 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.139
 tac 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:57.359
 then we break the same thing 

00:02:52.139 --> 00:03:02.549
 another time so let's put the 

00:02:57.359 --> 00:03:05.549
 we break the button we break and break the 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:08.549
 blocks of slime and here has done the 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:10.349
 our bonfire is a huge cool 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:12.840
 then we can decorate allowing you little 

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:15.540
 sundar road for everything so for not 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.910
