00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
really need to fix the audio and I

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:33.979 
really need to fix the audio and I
listened<00:00:32.489> to<00:00:32.640> it<00:00:32.790> and<00:00:32.969> it<00:00:33.090> sounded<00:00:33.390> terrible

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
listened to it and it sounded terrible

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.229 
listened to it and it sounded terrible
so<00:00:34.530> I<00:00:34.559> just<00:00:34.770> took<00:00:34.890> it<00:00:34.950> down<00:00:35.160> right<00:00:35.370> away<00:00:35.399> so<00:00:36.149> I'm

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
so I just took it down right away so I'm

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.580 
so I just took it down right away so I'm
redoing<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.750> video<00:00:36.960> and<00:00:37.140> hopefully<00:00:37.320> guys

this<00:00:38.160> would<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:38.790> audio<00:00:39.000> is<00:00:39.059> going<00:00:39.120> to<00:00:39.270> be

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
this would the audio is going to be

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.840 
this would the audio is going to be
better<00:00:39.540> so<00:00:40.160> basically<00:00:41.160> if<00:00:41.250> you<00:00:41.340> haven't<00:00:41.670> seen

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
month in like two months actually oh

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.720 
month in like two months actually oh
yeah<00:00:57.420> so<00:00:57.660> this<00:00:57.690> is<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.440> glitch<00:00:58.680> it's<00:00:59.039> a<00:00:59.399> really

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
yeah so this is the glitch it's a really

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.459 
yeah so this is the glitch it's a really
weird<00:01:00.000> thing<00:01:00.090> but<00:01:00.390> those<00:01:00.510> are<00:01:00.660> platforms<00:01:00.960> down

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
weird thing but those are platforms down

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.130 
weird thing but those are platforms down
there<00:01:01.649> if<00:01:01.800> you<00:01:01.920> can't<00:01:02.129> tell<00:01:02.780> they<00:01:03.780> look<00:01:03.989> really

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
there if you can't tell they look really

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.479 
there if you can't tell they look really
glitching<00:01:04.559> but<00:01:04.710> it's<00:01:04.830> just<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.070> same<00:01:05.280> way<00:01:05.430> you

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
glitching but it's just the same way you

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.760 
glitching but it's just the same way you
hammer<00:01:05.909> a<00:01:06.030> a<00:01:06.420> platforming<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.439> iOS<00:01:07.740> version

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
hammer a a platforming the iOS version

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.310 
hammer a a platforming the iOS version
or<00:01:08.280> maybe<00:01:08.460> even<00:01:08.729> Android<00:01:09.270> to<00:01:09.450> just<00:01:10.080> looks<00:01:10.260> like

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
or maybe even Android to just looks like

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.859 
or maybe even Android to just looks like
that<00:01:10.530> but<00:01:10.740> basically<00:01:10.830> which<00:01:11.820> is<00:01:11.850> you<00:01:12.600> get<00:01:12.750> in

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
that but basically which is you get in

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.260 
that but basically which is you get in
here<00:01:13.110> and<00:01:13.260> then<00:01:13.560> oh<00:01:13.890> you<00:01:14.850> can<00:01:15.000> just<00:01:15.030> go

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
here and then oh you can just go

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.749 
here and then oh you can just go
straight<00:01:15.540> through<00:01:15.750> oh<00:01:16.340> isn't<00:01:17.340> that<00:01:17.490> awesome

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
straight through oh isn't that awesome

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.620 
straight through oh isn't that awesome
but<00:01:18.659> yeah<00:01:19.380> so<00:01:19.680> um<00:01:19.950> hero<00:01:20.909> it<00:01:21.090> likes<00:01:21.270> to<00:01:21.420> use<00:01:21.509> it

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
but yeah so um hero it likes to use it

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.570 
but yeah so um hero it likes to use it
because<00:01:21.750> they<00:01:22.049> apparently<00:01:22.590> NPCs<00:01:23.250> like<00:01:23.430> to

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
because they apparently NPCs like to

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.670 
because they apparently NPCs like to
kill<00:01:23.729> themselves<00:01:23.909> a<00:01:24.150> lot<00:01:24.299> which<00:01:25.140> is<00:01:25.170> true<00:01:25.470> and

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
kill themselves a lot which is true and

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.920 
kill themselves a lot which is true and
you<00:01:26.189> just<00:01:26.460> block<00:01:26.850> off<00:01:27.119> their<00:01:27.270> door<00:01:27.509> but<00:01:27.720> keep

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
you just block off their door but keep

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.149 
you just block off their door but keep
the<00:01:28.049> door<00:01:28.200> so<00:01:28.439> it's<00:01:28.560> still<00:01:28.710> considered<00:01:28.890> a

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
the door so it's still considered a

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.640 
the door so it's still considered a
house<00:01:29.340> and<00:01:29.640> then<00:01:30.119> like<00:01:30.350> enter<00:01:31.350> their<00:01:31.500> house

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
house and then like enter their house

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:32.960 
house and then like enter their house
when<00:01:31.770> bond<00:01:32.040> like<00:01:32.280> that<00:01:32.520> and<00:01:32.729> they<00:01:32.850> have

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
when bond like that and they have

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.219 
when bond like that and they have
platforms<00:01:33.180> on<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.570> top<00:01:33.780> because<00:01:33.900> they<00:01:34.020> can't

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
platforms on the top because they can't

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.679 
platforms on the top because they can't
jump<00:01:34.500> and<00:01:34.799> yeah<00:01:35.460> so<00:01:35.640> how<00:01:36.000> you<00:01:36.060> do<00:01:36.270> this<00:01:36.390> is<00:01:36.630> you

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
jump and yeah so how you do this is you

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:41.569 
jump and yeah so how you do this is you
just<00:01:37.500> have<00:01:37.890> at<00:01:38.579> least<00:01:39.090> three<00:01:39.479> platforms<00:01:40.579> maybe

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
just have at least three platforms maybe

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.249 
just have at least three platforms maybe
before<00:01:42.000> just<00:01:42.180> like<00:01:42.299> get<00:01:42.720> a<00:01:42.750> little<00:01:42.899> bit<00:01:43.229> of

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
before just like get a little bit of

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.760 
before just like get a little bit of
flat<00:01:43.500> forms<00:01:43.860> and<00:01:44.100> then<00:01:45.619> you're<00:01:46.619> going<00:01:46.710> to

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
flat forms and then you're going to

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:47.990 
flat forms and then you're going to
place<00:01:47.009> a<00:01:47.040> platform<00:01:47.460> right<00:01:47.520> below<00:01:47.759> it<00:01:47.790> and

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
place a platform right below it and

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.139 
place a platform right below it and
another<00:01:48.780> one<00:01:48.990> and<00:01:49.170> then<00:01:49.229> a<00:01:50.070> third<00:01:50.250> and<00:01:50.520> then

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
another one and then a third and then

going<00:03:38.370> to<00:03:38.459> look<00:03:38.579> glitchy<00:03:38.849> but<00:03:39.239> this<00:03:39.659> works<00:03:39.870> on

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019 
going to look glitchy but this works on

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:42.229 
going to look glitchy but this works on
all<00:03:40.139> platforms<00:03:40.379> i<00:03:40.799> believe<00:03:41.099> and<00:03:41.519> i<00:03:41.970> think<00:03:42.150> it

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
all platforms i believe and i think it

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:44.719 
all platforms i believe and i think it
should<00:03:42.419> look<00:03:42.540> better<00:03:42.750> on<00:03:42.810> console<00:03:43.769> and<00:03:44.010> PC<00:03:44.519> but

00:03:44.719 --> 00:03:44.729 
should look better on console and PC but

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:46.369 
should look better on console and PC but
on<00:03:44.909> iOS<00:03:45.299> and<00:03:45.479> Android<00:03:45.540> it<00:03:45.840> looks<00:03:45.989> a<00:03:46.079> little<00:03:46.199> bit

00:03:46.369 --> 00:03:46.379 
on iOS and Android it looks a little bit

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:48.800 
on iOS and Android it looks a little bit
weird<00:03:46.579> so<00:03:47.579> you<00:03:47.639> can<00:03:47.849> just<00:03:47.879> like<00:03:48.180> go<00:03:48.540> like<00:03:48.569> that

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
weird so you can just like go like that

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:52.189 
weird so you can just like go like that
waiver<00:03:49.199> and<00:03:49.470> get<00:03:49.709> out<00:03:49.859> of<00:03:50.010> here<00:03:50.780> um<00:03:51.780> yeah<00:03:52.139> you
