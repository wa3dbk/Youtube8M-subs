so<00:03:08.970> the<00:03:09.120> easiest<00:03:09.750> way<00:03:10.020> you<00:03:10.050> guys<00:03:10.410> to<00:03:10.590> do<00:03:10.740> this

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
so the easiest way you guys to do this

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.360 
so the easiest way you guys to do this
is<00:03:11.100> to<00:03:11.400> learn<00:03:11.640> the<00:03:12.270> right<00:03:12.510> hand<00:03:12.840> melody

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
is to learn the right hand melody

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:15.170 
is to learn the right hand melody
completely<00:03:14.370> where<00:03:14.550> you<00:03:14.640> could<00:03:14.790> play<00:03:14.940> it<00:03:15.090> in

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
completely where you could play it in

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.030 
completely where you could play it in
your<00:03:15.210> sleep<00:03:15.510> with<00:03:15.780> your<00:03:15.870> eyes<00:03:16.050> closed<00:03:16.470> so<00:03:17.010> that

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
your sleep with your eyes closed so that

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.770 
your sleep with your eyes closed so that
you<00:03:17.250> don't<00:03:17.520> even<00:03:17.670> have<00:03:17.850> to<00:03:18.000> think<00:03:18.030> about<00:03:18.360> it

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
you don't even have to think about it

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.410 
you don't even have to think about it
then<00:03:19.400> practice<00:03:20.400> the<00:03:20.430> left<00:03:20.760> hand<00:03:21.030> so<00:03:21.240> that<00:03:21.270> you

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
then practice the left hand so that you

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.720 
then practice the left hand so that you
could<00:03:21.630> go<00:03:21.720> easily<00:03:22.020> between<00:03:22.920> these<00:03:23.070> two<00:03:23.310> chords

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730
