00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:10.089
 it is not known who the mole is not enough 

00:00:10.089 --> 00:00:13.089
 the computers 

00:00:18.589 --> 00:00:23.050
 for an evening the past nights this morning most of the times did not arise 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:24.970
 sofas that is beautiful they see 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:27.090
 in the dune area here in Zandvoort 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.939
 the houses are visible in the rising sun though 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.280
 one of la grande books fear the 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.140
 and sitting in the sun for so long, the fog dissolves most of the time that the sun also succeeded 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.450
 appeared 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.429
 the umbrella was needed again because the temperature went up 

00:00:41.429 --> 00:00:45.760
 the rapper up eventually became about 29 degrees in the east and south east 

00:00:45.759 --> 00:00:46.550
 of the country 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.690
 but i was sure what public transportation matters 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:53.050
 because the sky started to cloud, this is half past nine this morning 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.240
 right four villages this afternoon 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.359
 and not just involving the air 

00:00:57.359 --> 00:01:00.200
 opened from the cloud fields 9 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.690
 and sat in the air 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.330
 interference mainly higher in the air but around high pressure areas are those 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:06.800
 usually not as active 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.539
 so all computer models had seen that debate came as cloud 

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:14.150
 But they had more chances that they have calculated themselves 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.590
 later always found that the star gave up at from northwest 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.780
 after and to the south, the rain sometimes poured out over the country 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.409
 the sky also reports in limburg that we had then 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:27.040
 cynical about this is that there is a chance that 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.240
 Some people were prepared with the number I behind that someone 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.970
 in summer clothes and without an umbrella after the employer also had it all 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:35.260
 finally another prize 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:36.350
 rushes by 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.500
 at the big city photo showed above france above spain that were 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.799
 expected with thunder in the warm 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:46.829
 if we aired we have a degree or the 25 and further south and 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:47.939
 east of europe 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.960
 It was also busy with that white spots 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.120
 housing was created there too 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:56.729
 the malfunction of today drawn in with the after-field cool air it was 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.230
 it less hot this afternoon 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:01.040
 lies another fault in the supply direction 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.920
 it is changing 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:02.740
 is possible 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.479
 6 I think this time really not active because the high pressure area a bit stronger 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.570
 Tomorrow is going to be right above our environment, but there will still be some clouds 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:12.319
 maybe more 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:13.519
 a few showers 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:17.299
 in more rainy countries, I expect the southern Alps in northern Italy 

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:18.999
 a lot of jobs 

00:02:18.999 --> 00:02:23.010
 in Zeist if we can rain on large parts of the Balkans in Greece 

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:24.109
 thunderstorms 

00:02:24.109 --> 00:02:27.180
 and that is at temperatures of about 25 to this bad 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:32.719
 it is also starting to warm in france with 30 degrees in paris and us that warm 

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:33.240
 air 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.529
 will land 

00:02:34.529 --> 00:02:38.659
 therefore moving north and almost becoming us later in the week 

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:40.629
 more than 30 everywhere 

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:42.649
 Hair here might even help 

00:02:42.649 --> 00:02:44.989
 5 30 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:48.029
 today one was still sprayed and that is desperately needed because nature 

00:02:48.029 --> 00:02:49.010
 stays dry 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.410
 that few millimeters that the room has fallen 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.539
 contributes little to that 

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:56.340
 in the supply direction it is as good as dry weather and cindy 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.170
 a little of little you start with a few showers maybe that just a little 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:03.950
 the coast will be reached later tonight, but the cloud fields will go for it tonight 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:05.749
 worry that is not that far behind 

00:03:05.749 --> 00:03:09.040
 regis can be clearly seen on the radar from west to east 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.080
 some red spots where it is a bit harder but you can see it all very well 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:13.649
 shoot quickly 

00:03:13.649 --> 00:03:16.649
 and behind that dry weather with very big clearings 

00:03:17.189 --> 00:03:21.840
 last night also a few clearings 12 to 15 degrees the new chances for one 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:22.719
 fog bank 

00:03:22.719 --> 00:03:25.939
 tomorrow morning is perhaps a local, some gray snow that comes in the sun 

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:27.659
 regularly 

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:30.719
 only for large parts of the central and southern Netherlands I am not entirely 

00:03:30.719 --> 00:03:32.540
 sure it stays dry 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.379
 I expected a whole and could 

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:39.109
 24 degrees nationwide Thursday 29 degrees Friday 

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:44.649
 nationwide 32 degrees Saturday the heat drive costs with rain and 

00:03:44.649 --> 00:03:47.650
 Thunderstorms but Sunday is about to gradually 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.540
 that is because they take the neighborhood for a very long term, this is 30 grams 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:52.340
 seems to get 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:56.920
 we go quietly Friday that put over rarely given the huge margin 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.739
 along the eastern border to 30 degrees, but then the temperature dropped somewhat 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:04.169
 but still 25 degrees so less hot 

00:04:04.169 --> 00:04:05.759
 for this time of year 

00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:08.759
 tonight 

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:22.599
 4 who hasn't made it yet 

00:04:22.599 --> 00:04:23.539
 the contour teams
