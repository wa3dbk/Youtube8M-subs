00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
obstructive but it fits with the fact

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:02.029 
obstructive but it fits with the fact
that<00:00:56.129> has<00:00:56.340> this<00:00:56.520> off<00:00:56.760> strange<00:00:59.539> c<00:01:01.039> square

that has this off strange c square
square<00:01:02.670> head<00:01:02.940> maybe<00:01:03.710> it's<00:01:04.710> probably<00:01:05.100> a<00:01:05.129> more

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
square head maybe it's probably a more

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.440 
square head maybe it's probably a more
specific<00:01:05.519> shape<00:01:06.060> but<00:01:07.790> it's<00:01:08.790> quite<00:01:08.970> nippy<00:01:09.150> for

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
specific shape but it's quite nippy for

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.980

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
try out it's not the prettiest hope I

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.990 
try out it's not the prettiest hope I
know<00:04:20.850> means<00:04:21.090> is<00:04:21.600> it<00:04:21.810> a<00:04:22.099> nice<00:04:23.099> Mac<00:04:23.490> to<00:04:23.669> look<00:04:23.789> at

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
know means is it a nice Mac to look at

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.770 
know means is it a nice Mac to look at
it's<00:04:24.180> it's<00:04:24.960> ugly<00:04:25.229> but<00:04:26.220> I<00:04:26.639> mean<00:04:27.539> if<00:04:27.660> you're

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
it's it's ugly but I mean if you're

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.120 
it's it's ugly but I mean if you're
basing<00:04:27.960> it<00:04:28.229> on<00:04:28.289> what<00:04:28.410> are<00:04:28.650> you<00:04:28.680> gonna<00:04:28.860> pile
