afternoon on the third day I was looking

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.160 
afternoon on the third day I was looking
for<00:02:24.970> these<00:02:25.060> bits<00:02:25.330> and<00:02:25.480> I<00:02:25.600> was<00:02:25.690> getting<00:02:25.900> further

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
for these bits and I was getting further

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.170 
for these bits and I was getting further
and<00:02:26.590> further<00:02:26.680> away<00:02:27.069> from<00:02:27.580> where<00:02:27.790> the

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
and further away from where the

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.870 
and further away from where the
concentration<00:02:29.020> had<00:02:29.200> been<00:02:29.520> and<00:02:30.520> I<00:02:30.670> wasn't

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
concentration had been and I wasn't

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.460 
concentration had been and I wasn't
finding<00:02:31.239> anything<00:02:31.390> I<00:02:31.690> hadn't<00:02:32.080> found<00:02:32.260> anything

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
finding anything I hadn't found anything

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.620 
finding anything I hadn't found anything
of<00:02:32.620> that<00:02:32.650> I<00:02:33.069> suppose<00:02:33.700> hour<00:02:33.910> and<00:02:34.090> a<00:02:34.150> half<00:02:34.330> two

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
of that I suppose hour and a half two

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.870 
of that I suppose hour and a half two
hours<00:02:35.080> and<00:02:35.980> then<00:02:36.070> I<00:02:36.190> got<00:02:36.370> this<00:02:36.459> tiny<00:02:36.760> little

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
hours and then I got this tiny little

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.199 
hours and then I got this tiny little
signal<00:02:37.390> very<00:02:37.780> very<00:02:38.110> fine<00:02:38.380> I<00:02:38.560> thought<00:02:38.739> oh

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
signal very very fine I thought oh

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:42.300 
signal very very fine I thought oh
another<00:02:40.209> one<00:02:40.360> but<00:02:41.019> a<00:02:41.170> small<00:02:41.590> bit<00:02:41.860> just<00:02:42.220> a

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
another one but a small bit just a

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.190 
another one but a small bit just a
broken<00:02:43.000> bits<00:02:43.209> that's<00:02:43.480> all<00:02:43.630> it<00:02:43.780> was<00:02:43.870> left<00:02:44.080> just

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
broken bits that's all it was left just

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.699 
broken bits that's all it was left just
these<00:02:44.410> broken<00:02:44.680> bits<00:02:45.010> and<00:02:45.900> my<00:02:46.900> whole<00:02:47.140> just<00:02:47.620> a

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:47.709

these broken bits and my whole just a
nice<00:02:47.890> little<00:02:48.070> small<00:02:48.400> 6x6

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.979 

so<00:02:57.190> I<00:02:57.220> dug<00:02:57.580> a<00:02:57.610> bit<00:02:57.940> deeper<00:02:58.330> and<00:02:58.480> I<00:02:58.569> went<00:02:58.780> down<00:02:58.959> I

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 
so I dug a bit deeper and I went down I

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:00.840 
so I dug a bit deeper and I went down I
suppose<00:02:59.140> about<00:02:59.500> about<00:03:00.040> 8<00:03:00.190> inches<00:03:00.459> 10<00:03:00.819> inches

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850 
suppose about about 8 inches 10 inches
