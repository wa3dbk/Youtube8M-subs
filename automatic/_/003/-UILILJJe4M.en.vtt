hi<00:00:05.040> this<00:00:05.970> is<00:00:06.000> the<00:00:06.540> ninth<00:00:06.899> on<00:00:07.470> I'm<00:00:07.859> trying<00:00:08.250> to

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
hi this is the ninth on I'm trying to

hi this is the ninth on I'm trying to
upload<00:00:08.790> this<00:00:09.059> um<00:00:10.880> so<00:00:11.880> I'm<00:00:11.969> going<00:00:12.210> to<00:00:12.240> keep<00:00:12.420> it

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
upload this um so I'm going to keep it

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.410 
upload this um so I'm going to keep it

all<00:05:33.780> over<00:05:33.810> like<00:05:34.260> that<00:05:34.530> so<00:05:35.460> I<00:05:35.700> tried<00:05:36.090> what<00:05:36.390> we

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:36.600 
all over like that so I tried what we

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:40.670 
all over like that so I tried what we
had<00:05:36.750> today<00:05:37.680> at<00:05:38.130> solar<00:05:38.460> storm<00:05:39.080> that<00:05:40.080> does<00:05:40.320> only

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:40.680 
had today at solar storm that does only

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.610 
had today at solar storm that does only
ninety<00:05:41.190> percent<00:05:41.340> as<00:05:41.760> strong<00:05:42.300> as<00:05:42.540> the<00:05:42.870> item<00:05:43.200> 59

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:43.620 
ninety percent as strong as the item 59

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:46.970 
ninety percent as strong as the item 59
solar<00:05:44.190> store<00:05:44.520> will<00:05:45.270> do<00:05:45.570> exactly<00:05:45.840> the<00:05:46.410> same<00:05:46.440> and

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:46.980 
solar store will do exactly the same and

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:49.880 
solar store will do exactly the same and
the<00:05:47.670> weaker<00:05:48.030> the<00:05:48.150> magnetosphere<00:05:48.930> becomes<00:05:49.320> the

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:49.890 
the weaker the magnetosphere becomes the

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:53.200 
the weaker the magnetosphere becomes the
more<00:05:50.040> damages<00:05:50.610> Alice<00:05:50.940> Donald<00:05:51.300> do<00:05:51.450> to<00:05:51.600> us<00:05:51.890> and

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:53.210 
more damages Alice Donald do to us and

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:56.360 
more damages Alice Donald do to us and
more<00:05:54.210> radiation<00:05:54.540> will<00:05:54.960> commend<00:05:55.320> more<00:05:55.950> cancer

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:56.370 
more radiation will commend more cancer

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:59.090 
more radiation will commend more cancer

oh that's bice period I oh how does the

00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:57.930 
released a EMP the same happens when it

00:06:57.930 --> 00:06:59.960 
released a EMP the same happens when it
