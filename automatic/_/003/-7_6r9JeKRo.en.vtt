this<00:00:26.160> is<00:00:26.340> a<00:00:26.370> bit<00:00:27.000> of<00:00:27.060> a<00:00:27.120> departure<00:00:27.360> for<00:00:27.690> Rocky

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:27.870

this is a bit of a departure for Rocky
Mountain<00:00:28.260> and<00:00:28.320> that<00:00:28.500> it's<00:00:28.650> a<00:00:28.770> it's<00:00:29.070> a

Mountain and that it's a it's a

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.980 
Mountain and that it's a it's a
cross-country<00:00:29.580> race<00:00:29.850> bike<00:00:30.120> but<00:00:30.360> it's<00:00:30.480> a<00:00:30.660> good

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
cross-country race bike but it's a good

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.020 
cross-country race bike but it's a good
deal<00:00:31.110> more<00:00:31.140> capable<00:00:31.830> than<00:00:31.890> a<00:00:32.070> normal<00:00:32.340> bike<00:00:32.490> who

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
deal more capable than a normal bike who

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.310 
deal more capable than a normal bike who
wants<00:00:33.270> to<00:00:33.360> let<00:00:33.510> us<00:00:33.600> start<00:00:33.780> off<00:00:33.810> talking<00:00:34.050> those

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
wants to let us start off talking those

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.230 
wants to let us start off talking those
I<00:00:34.650> see<00:00:35.160> like<00:00:35.400> right<00:00:35.610> down<00:00:35.790> I<00:00:35.850> think<00:00:36.030> it's

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:36.240 
I see like right down I think it's

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.300 
I see like right down I think it's
potentially<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:36.810> weirdest<00:00:37.320> XE<00:00:37.830> bike<00:00:38.040> ever

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:38.310 
potentially the weirdest XE bike ever

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:40.910 
potentially the weirdest XE bike ever
like<00:00:39.270> but<00:00:39.660> not<00:00:39.810> in<00:00:39.900> a<00:00:39.960> negative<00:00:40.110> sense<00:00:40.590> and

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
like but not in a negative sense and

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.560 
like but not in a negative sense and
just<00:00:41.010> thing<00:00:41.190> because<00:00:41.760> it's<00:00:41.910> gonna<00:00:42.060> drop<00:00:42.510> a

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
just thing because it's gonna drop a

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
pretty much the purpose best bike I've

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.670 
pretty much the purpose best bike I've
ridden<00:01:02.190> in<00:01:02.309> years<00:01:02.640> like<00:01:02.879> I've<00:01:03.000> gotten<00:01:03.360> more

ridden in years like I've gotten more

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.560 
ridden in years like I've gotten more
good<00:01:04.680> results<00:01:05.190> out<00:01:05.370> of<00:01:05.519> riding<00:01:05.760> people<00:01:06.450> if

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
good results out of riding people if

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.100 
good results out of riding people if
we're<00:01:06.720> saying<00:01:06.900> this<00:01:07.050> is<00:01:07.230> an<00:01:07.710> X<00:01:08.550> e<00:01:08.760> /<00:01:09.450> e<00:01:09.480> kind<00:01:10.020> of

we're saying this is an X e / e kind of

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.020 
we're saying this is an X e / e kind of
trail<00:01:10.290> bike<00:01:10.560> I<00:01:10.740> think<00:01:10.890> it<00:01:10.950> really<00:01:11.190> really

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
trail bike I think it really really

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.420 
trail bike I think it really really
improve<00:01:12.330> people's<00:01:12.659> trail<00:01:13.100> experience<00:01:14.100> and

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
improve people's trail experience and

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.120 
improve people's trail experience and
their<00:01:15.050> Tallis's<00:01:16.050> I<00:01:16.230> think<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.800> most

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
their Tallis's I think the most

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.010 
their Tallis's I think the most
outstanding<00:01:17.640> of<00:01:18.150> these<00:01:18.360> several<00:01:18.570> hundred

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
outstanding of these several hundred

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.040 
outstanding of these several hundred
parts<00:01:19.290> because<00:01:19.590> of<00:01:20.450> all<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.630> things<00:01:21.870> on<00:01:22.020> a

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:22.050 
parts because of all the things on a

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:23.450 
parts because of all the things on a
bike<00:01:22.260> that<00:01:22.470> you<00:01:22.590> don't<00:01:22.860> want<00:01:23.040> to<00:01:23.100> have<00:01:23.250> to

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
bike that you don't want to have to

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.030 
bike that you don't want to have to
change<00:01:23.880> it's<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.810> fourth<00:01:25.110> most<00:01:25.350> expensive

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
change it's the fourth most expensive

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.930 
change it's the fourth most expensive

more linear
shocks<00:02:17.099> the<00:02:17.400> bikes<00:02:17.790> it<00:02:17.970> felt<00:02:18.150> like<00:02:18.269> that<00:02:18.390> a

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
shocks the bikes it felt like that a

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:18.940 
shocks the bikes it felt like that a
little<00:02:18.599> bit

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
little bit

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:24.040 
little bit
they're<00:02:19.720> like<00:02:20.920> but<00:02:21.920> the<00:02:22.640> flipside<00:02:22.879> was<00:02:23.269> the

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
they're like but the flipside was the

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:25.600 
they're like but the flipside was the
fork<00:02:24.349> in<00:02:24.530> the<00:02:24.620> front<00:02:24.830> and<00:02:24.920> they're<00:02:25.040> so<00:02:25.160> capable

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
fork in the front and they're so capable

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.130 
fork in the front and they're so capable
you<00:02:25.819> know<00:02:25.910> the<00:02:26.060> rear<00:02:26.239> end<00:02:26.420> does<00:02:26.690> just<00:02:26.959> follow

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
you know the rear end does just follow

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.020 
you know the rear end does just follow
fine<00:02:27.470> particularly<00:02:28.040> the<00:02:28.129> bigger<00:02:28.310> wheel<00:02:28.550> so<00:02:28.849> I

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
fine particularly the bigger wheel so I

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:30.430 
fine particularly the bigger wheel so I
mean<00:02:29.209> I<00:02:29.420> didn't<00:02:29.599> feel<00:02:29.720> like<00:02:29.780> I<00:02:29.900> was<00:02:29.959> hampered

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
mean I didn't feel like I was hampered

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.650 
mean I didn't feel like I was hampered
and<00:02:30.650> it<00:02:31.069> is<00:02:31.190> incredibly<00:02:31.610> efficient<00:02:32.060> so<00:02:32.330> it's

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
and it is incredibly efficient so it's

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.360 
and it is incredibly efficient so it's
got<00:02:32.900> that<00:02:33.370> how's<00:02:34.370> business<00:02:34.700> in<00:02:34.940> the<00:02:35.000> back<00:02:35.180> but

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
got that how's business in the back but

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.830 
got that how's business in the back but
yeah<00:02:37.370> it's<00:02:37.819> an<00:02:37.940> interesting<00:02:38.090> being<00:02:38.569> I

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
yeah it's an interesting being I

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.750 
yeah it's an interesting being I
recommend<00:02:39.530> it<00:02:39.620> as<00:02:39.709> a<00:02:39.769> tent<00:02:39.980> anyone<00:02:40.370> wants<00:02:40.700> a

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
recommend it as a tent anyone wants a

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.370 
recommend it as a tent anyone wants a
bike<00:02:40.910> that's<00:02:41.120> fast<00:02:41.360> and<00:02:41.569> efficient<00:02:42.110> and<00:02:42.230> when

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
bike that's fast and efficient and when

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.589 
bike that's fast and efficient and when
is<00:02:42.500> massively<00:02:43.250> capable<00:02:43.819> of<00:02:43.940> technical<00:02:44.360> time

00:02:44.589 --> 00:02:44.599 
is massively capable of technical time

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:50.950 
is massively capable of technical time
for<00:02:45.080> that<00:02:45.200> guy<00:02:45.410> it's<00:02:46.130> a<00:02:46.220> 10<00:02:46.370> in<00:02:46.489> my<00:02:46.519> book

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:50.960
