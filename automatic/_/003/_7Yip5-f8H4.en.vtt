00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:05.330
 and hereby welcome, especially 

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:07.130
 again a specially produced video 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:09.080
 It's been a bit longer now 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:11.150
 For the reason, I'll come to the first 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:14.240
 gameplay and the tables is one 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:16.550
 four weapons off and yes like so many 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.830
 weapons simply as a jump zone 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.029
 is and there are no killstreaks 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:22.789
 accordingly no specialist 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:24.560
 bonus and as a new one you have then 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:27.019
 rarely raiders his 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.640
 dexterity and not only me 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:30.830
 with the primary weapon because I play 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.480
 just not a real sniper I had to 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:35.360
 I yes the secondary sr changes on 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.920
 beginning plays with apparatus of mp new 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.489
 and the mp new then changes in the 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:43.910
 Run the game to his mg and on 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:45.500
 a p7 but the title has to be 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:49.250
 laugh a little yourself but well 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:51.170
 not so important now why we in 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.629
 lately produce so little 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:56.180
 that has two reasons one is the 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:58.429
 motivation through the bucks of youtube 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.719
 So at least 300 calls per video that 

00:00:58.429 --> 00:01:01.879
 would be in order if it really 

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:03.559
 300 would be but it depends about 300 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:05.299
 on and then it goes on in comparison 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:07.820
 for maybe even others 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:08.509
 youtuber who is the stallion of raw materials 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.310
 it goes on 

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:11.840
 and if that continues with us then 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.299
 after three months or so then you are 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.979
 maybe five call more and want 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:17.780
 currently no idea about 50 likes 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:19.729
 have come and that's not that 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.970
 just shit and that demotivated 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:24.290
 extreme but we have to look like us 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.360
 that will get another one 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.310
 problem we have a lot of gameplay 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.740
 So now this world premiere then 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.149
 a lot of other ships 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.200
 really really great things only 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:34.579
 I can not do it right now 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.439
 record because my pc a bunch 

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:38.360
 shit is and that with crepes somehow 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:40.159
 that's not why we have to do that first 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.540
 a child i have when so many 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:42.860
 gameplay now on the pc because that 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.200
 of course also costs memory and so 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.600
 That's why I have this too 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:52.250
 but the current one I think goes 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:53.899
 just to the next one 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:57.860
 time come the videos so come today 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:59.180
 another montage of used to play and 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.920
 that took a bit longer 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:03.370
 and that 's the problem 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:07.040
 he has found the tenant and 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:08.690
 That's why we would do it if it was behind 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.720
 She would edit that from you 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.070
 what we would bring ourselves 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.080
 course on our channel where load 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:16.490
 link to town bork if you 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.690
 you want you can also be sponsored 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:20.950
 then of course you have really good 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.950
 chances if you would do that 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.400
 but still the assembly is not really 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.680
 bad you see her then today 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.500
 probably still and would me 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.360
 look forward if about the blade 100 subscriptions 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.700
 would still create 40 pieces that 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.950
 should be in it 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:39.380
 yes there is a newly created 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:42.040
 Project of two people we sponsor 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:46.790
 of which the e-class shudder 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:49.390
 acted well my person is indeed the 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:52.760
 that despite accredited and there are still jets 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:54.620
 both channels should be known to you 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.170
 are and who put together a 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.709
 community channel have stop doctor german 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.880
 top arts in life 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:03.860
 and we want exactly this channel 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.630
 of course a bit they promote 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:08.000
 are already the box has fallen naturally 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:09.260
 unfortunately not so many on but it comes 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.110
 now soon that I do not know if it 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:14.450
 Tomorrow or tomorrow a clip 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:16.870
 edit by jadson r and stds 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.769
 really cool but destroy 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.630
 can you be curious? 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:23.420
 look really cool and then on 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:25.940
 the end of the videos is the importance of the 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.140
 It is the promo of which they are 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:29.239
 now some clip but you 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:31.549
 Just say what it's all about 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:32.810
 you expected and so on 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:34.459
 I do not need to do that now either 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:37.400
 I would ask you that 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:40.190
 to watch because well if that what 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:42.310
 producing lust be good he 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.310
 is 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:48.340
 that was actually so big now 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:50.739
 and i would say a lot of fun 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:53.170
 I do not know sometimes gameplay 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:54.819
 I figured a bit because yes yes 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.230
 it was boring or not 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:59.459
 idea 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:59.459
 and well, that's good
