00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
but for this particular song it was the

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.749 
but for this particular song it was the
organ<00:01:37.170> that<00:01:37.229> I<00:01:37.380> use<00:01:37.619> and<00:01:37.829> it<00:01:37.920> fit<00:01:38.130> so<00:01:38.579> that's

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
organ that I use and it fit so that's

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.569 
organ that I use and it fit so that's
what<00:01:38.909> I<00:01:38.939> went<00:01:39.150> with<00:01:39.420> but<00:01:40.020> on<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.340> main

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
what I went with but on the the main

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.300 
what I went with but on the the main
part<00:01:42.000> of<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.570> organ<00:01:43.049> itself<00:01:43.560> is<00:01:43.860> in<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.100> key

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
part of the organ itself is in the key

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.600 
part of the organ itself is in the key
of<00:01:44.340> E<00:01:44.610> so<00:01:45.270> I<00:01:45.329> start<00:01:45.659> by<00:01:45.689> pressing<00:01:46.399> you<00:01:47.399> know<00:01:47.549> I'm

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
of E so I start by pressing you know I'm

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:47.990 
of E so I start by pressing you know I'm
saying

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
saying

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.270 
saying

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
and then the technique is real simple

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.310
