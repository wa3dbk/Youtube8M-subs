00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:07.790
 the center for economic studies of 

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:09.590
 private sector assured that they are required 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:11.959
 additional measures to stimulate 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:13.430
 productive activity will raise the income 

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:16.000
 of households and consequently 

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:18.050
 generate a greater consumption the organism 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.760
 He added that it is also necessary 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.950
 incentivize investment and make a 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.840
 revision of the tax reform the set 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:26.210
 he also said that while the main ones 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.800
 objectives to follow are to raise the pace 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.060
 of economic growth and improve 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.970
 improve the welfare of the population 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.980
 It is also essential to stimulate in the 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:36.019
 best way to achieve it and that is that there 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.179
 an intense negotiation and discussion 

00:00:36.019 --> 00:00:40.100
 meeting between the secretary of 

00:00:38.179 --> 00:00:41.719
 finance and the private sector in function 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.089
 If defined, there may be adjustments with 

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:45.920
 regarding the tax reform has been very 

00:00:44.089 --> 00:00:47.059
 clear the federal government regarding 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.129
 that he is not going to increase 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:51.409
 taxes for the next three years 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:54.530
 and that no adjustments are going to be made 

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:56.449
 substantial to it on the other hand in 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.519
 international issues the European Union and 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:01.219
 South Korea agreed on a pact to 

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:03.170
 develop mobile telephony 5 that 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:05.840
 hopes that this technology is already 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:08.450
 available at the end of 2015 with this one 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.250
 could for example download a video 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.530
 HD video an hour 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:15.200
 high definition in just six 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.640
 seconds really important because it's 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.500
 very relevant this news because it is the 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.110
 first time that at a government level 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.210
 begin to promote the creation of 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.130
 a technological platform and that is why 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:28.610
 Of course what we are observing is 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:30.679
 that the internet on mobile devices is 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:33.079
 the essential component of the economy 

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:34.729
 of knowledge that is the determinant 

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:36.920
 that we are seeing in the 21st century of 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:38.920
 done in South Korea for example that 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.390
 you have the best services 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.670
 mobile internet cheaper and for 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.140
 course faster and this in good 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.090
 measure has allowed this deployment that 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.009
 we've seen in South Korea - added by 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.740
 supposedly many other issues that have 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:52.399
 achieved the South Koreans since 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.989
 several years 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:57.819
 let's continue questioning the 

00:01:53.989 --> 00:01:57.819
 information with the following videos
