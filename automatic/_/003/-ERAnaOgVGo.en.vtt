00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:15.590
 since 2004 the cassini space probe 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:18.510
 has been orbiting saturn and its moons 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:22.160
 using special instruments to 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.160
 be able to see below your clouds 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:27.450
 on August 21 , 2014 the probe 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.870
 cassini was flying over the largest moon 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:33.270
 Saturn called Titan and he got to see 

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:35.990
 as the sunlight reflected on the 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.930
 Seas of hydrocarbons 

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:41.450
 previously almost had not already captured 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:44.120
 views of the polar seas and the sun 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:46.820
 shining out of them but this is the 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:49.180
 first time you have captured images of 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:52.060
 both together 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:54.100
 in the image you can see an arrow 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:57.970
 full of bright clouds of methane 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:01:00.640
 near the north pole of titan the clouds 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:03.100
 they could be actively filling the 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.920
 lakes with rain in a similar way 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:08.470
 that on earth with the difference that 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.720
 it's not with water 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.640
 you can also see a ring or a 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.010
 bright margin around the sea of 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.710
 crack in which reflects the solar brightness 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:20.680
 and it tells us that there was a moment in the 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:23.140
 that the sea had more liquid but that the 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:26.590
 evaporation has made it grow in 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:30.690
 size indeed if so it seems to have 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:33.960
 Huge seas of liquid methane and ethanol 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:37.170
 The titan seas are mostly 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.600
 liquid methane diet not before the 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.400
 arrival from almost to Saturn the 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.040
 scientists suspected that the titan 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:47.700
 could have free liquid bodies in 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.980
 its surface but almost did not even find 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.250
 Large fields of sand dunes nearby 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:55.320
 of the equator and lower latitudes and 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.320
 found lakes and seas near the 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.479
 poles especially in the north 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.680
 we will keep you updated with more 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.680
