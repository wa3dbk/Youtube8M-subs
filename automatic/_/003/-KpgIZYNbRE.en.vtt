00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:06.130
 more 

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:32.029
 I'm allowed you 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:36.320
 Welcome so bike craft workshop 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:39.350
 today disc brakes we obstruct 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.360
 today a model magura mt 6 in addition 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:46.640
 do i need the brake ours 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:48.580
 prepared rat the brake disc in 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.710
 our trap has a special adapter 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:59.290
 because we have attracted center shimano 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:01:02.750
 and of course have a front run 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:05.780
 before we pull the brake mount 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:09.800
 we the distemper when shimano hub dynamo 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:12.940
 off to the brake disc on the center 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.940
 to be able to mount looseness 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:31.640
 to do this we fit some assembly 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:33.920
 on the center lay on before we then 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.650
 we have to assemble the disc 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.990
 Center disc in the adapter 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:44.000
 For this we take the circlip from 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:46.369
 adapter the metal disc until we get the 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:52.430
 Metal noses and the black ring 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:56.470
 see then we assemble the disc 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:59.150
 the noses give the ring 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:02.659
 so that the corrugation is visible 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:07.220
 is mounting circlip so that 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:10.880
 The whole also holds then 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:20.299
 we can tap the disc on the treadmill 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:23.420
 stuck and loose in center gross fixed 

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:25.269
 turn to assemble we always use one 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:28.280
 torque wrench 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:34.700
 The central adapters are 40 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:38.270
 Newton meter dressed when it cracks 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:40.060
 Do we have the 40 newton meters in there and 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:43.849
 can assemble the quick release 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:45.980
 these previously fitted with mounting 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:49.099
 coat so that corrosion 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:51.190
 Prevent when we are in the quick release 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:54.470
 then have leased with lease 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:58.090
 Slide in on the back and open 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.090
 the opposite side to raise the mother 

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:05.030
 then we get started on the 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.410
 Disc brake at markkula very typical 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.640
 is the front brake with the 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:09.920
 same line length as the 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:12.560
 Rear wheel brake delivered therefore 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.150
 later shortening indispensable but 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:19.580
 Do not be surprised if the line 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:24.099
 extremely long mount the very first 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:24.099
 we use the brake lever on the handlebar 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:34.700
 and tighten this roughly so that he 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.700
 later when setting does not slip 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:48.909
 then we take the yellow sack switzerland 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.680
 out the rail transport serves that 

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:52.989
 the evidence at the operation of the lever 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:56.280
 Do not drive together and we will do that later 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:56.280
 drive magic can insert 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:02.019
 then we have the caliper 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:06.299
 at the fork firm to the two 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:06.299
 Use members in six screws 

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:25.920
 when installing the barrel in the frame 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:28.860
 Be careful with the brake disc 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:32.810
 just between the documents come and so 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:32.810
 Do not cause damage 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:59.690
 ok have fun in making yourself 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:59.690
 First of all, we'll see you servus
