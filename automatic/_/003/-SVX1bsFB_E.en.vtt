00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
matter what there is no way around it

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.160 
matter what there is no way around it
and<00:01:52.980> my<00:01:53.160> combo<00:01:53.520> damage<00:01:53.820> is<00:01:54.000> so<00:01:54.240> low<00:01:54.900> because

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
and my combo damage is so low because

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.190 
and my combo damage is so low because
they<00:01:55.470> don't<00:01:55.650> have<00:01:55.740> invented<00:01:56.130> this<00:01:56.310> round<00:01:57.200> so

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
they don't have invented this round so

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.810 
they don't have invented this round so
I'm<00:01:58.290> probably<00:01:58.500> not<00:01:58.710> able<00:01:58.950> to<00:01:59.160> kill<00:01:59.310> him<00:01:59.430> in<00:01:59.580> any

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
I'm probably not able to kill him in any

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.090 
I'm probably not able to kill him in any
way<00:02:00.210> shit<00:02:01.110> especially<00:02:01.320> not<00:02:01.710> if<00:02:01.830> I<00:02:01.920> drop<00:02:02.070> my

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
like when fighting people like that you

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:26.960 
like when fighting people like that you
have<00:02:25.140> to<00:02:25.320> pay<00:02:25.650> so<00:02:25.709> much<00:02:26.040> attention<00:02:26.250> and

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
have to pay so much attention and

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.910 
have to pay so much attention and
literally<00:02:28.010> never<00:02:29.010> ever<00:02:29.430> open<00:02:30.209> up<00:02:30.500> to<00:02:31.500> anything

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
that would normally work or could work

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.710

00:05:59.820 --> 00:05:59.830 
mean it could have turned out way way

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:04.620 
mean it could have turned out way way
worse<00:06:00.780> but<00:06:02.310> luckily<00:06:03.310> didn't<00:06:03.880> for<00:06:04.030> me<00:06:04.150> anyways
