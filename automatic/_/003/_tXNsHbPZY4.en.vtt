00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
see okay what we're doing is a really

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.960 
see okay what we're doing is a really
simple<00:00:26.369> simple<00:00:27.210> drill<00:00:27.570> and<00:00:28.670> that's<00:00:29.670> probably

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
simple simple drill and that's probably

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.460 
simple simple drill and that's probably
why<00:00:30.090> it<00:00:30.150> took<00:00:30.390> so<00:00:30.449> long<00:00:30.660> to<00:00:30.869> figure<00:00:31.170> it<00:00:31.380> out

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
why it took so long to figure it out

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.130 
why it took so long to figure it out
because<00:00:31.859> it<00:00:32.040> is<00:00:32.279> so<00:00:32.579> simple<00:00:32.989> what<00:00:33.989> we're

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
because it is so simple what we're

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.400 
because it is so simple what we're
looking<00:00:34.260> at<00:00:34.500> here<00:00:34.559> is<00:00:35.460> a<00:00:35.520> medicine<00:00:35.880> ball<00:00:36.410> you

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
looking at here is a medicine ball you

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.520 
looking at here is a medicine ball you
need<00:00:37.559> a<00:00:38.180> smut<00:00:39.180> wall<00:00:39.420> that<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.260> ball<00:00:40.410> can

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
need a smut wall that the ball can

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.229 
need a smut wall that the ball can
bounce<00:00:40.770> off<00:00:40.950> of<00:00:41.010> now<00:00:41.730> when<00:00:41.910> we're<00:00:42.090> thinking

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
bounce off of now when we're thinking

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:43.639 
bounce off of now when we're thinking
about<00:00:42.510> bat<00:00:42.809> speed<00:00:42.840> when<00:00:43.379> we're<00:00:43.530> thinking

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
about bat speed when we're thinking

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.270 
about bat speed when we're thinking
about<00:00:43.860> our<00:00:44.070> hitting<00:00:44.989> we<00:00:45.989> want<00:00:46.260> to<00:00:46.379> really<00:00:47.100> want
