00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.210 
casing where the engine was bolted if I
turn<00:01:24.750> it<00:01:24.900> around<00:01:25.020> to<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.439> other<00:01:25.560> side<00:01:25.740> it's

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
turn it around to the other side it's

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.679 
turn it around to the other side it's
the<00:01:26.340> same<00:01:26.610> thing<00:01:26.640> there's<00:01:27.119> a<00:01:27.210> chunk<00:01:27.479> missing

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
the same thing there's a chunk missing

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.560 
the same thing there's a chunk missing
out<00:01:27.990> of<00:01:28.020> here<00:01:28.350> and<00:01:28.520> there's<00:01:29.520> huge<00:01:29.970> stress

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
out of here and there's huge stress

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.780 
out of here and there's huge stress
cracks<00:01:33.710> same<00:01:34.710> thing<00:01:34.950> over<00:01:35.070> here<00:01:35.220> on<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:35.579> left

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
cracks same thing over here on the left

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.960 
cracks same thing over here on the left
side<00:01:36.560> this<00:01:37.560> is<00:01:37.740> how<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:37.950> lip<00:01:38.220> should<00:01:38.520> look<00:01:38.729> on

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
side this is how the lip should look on

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.520 
side this is how the lip should look on
the<00:01:39.119> other<00:01:39.210> side<00:01:39.570> but<00:01:40.020> there<00:01:40.200> shouldn't<00:01:40.439> be

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
the other side but there shouldn't be

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.280 
the other side but there shouldn't be
any<00:01:40.799> cracks<00:01:41.159> at<00:01:41.430> all<00:01:41.700> now<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.720> reason<00:01:42.990> why<00:01:43.259> I

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
any cracks at all now the reason why I

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.440 
any cracks at all now the reason why I
didn't<00:01:43.680> fix<00:01:43.950> this<00:01:44.189> is<00:01:44.460> because<00:01:44.909> there's<00:01:45.119> so

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
didn't fix this is because there's so

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.870 
didn't fix this is because there's so
many<00:01:45.570> cracks<00:01:45.990> in<00:01:46.229> it<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.649> metal<00:01:46.979> is<00:01:47.189> so<00:01:47.520> thin

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
many cracks in it the metal is so thin

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.569 
many cracks in it the metal is so thin
and<00:01:48.090> even<00:01:48.990> if<00:01:49.110> you<00:01:49.229> tried<00:01:49.500> welding<00:01:50.009> it<00:01:50.189> where

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
and even if you tried welding it where

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.490 
and even if you tried welding it where
the<00:01:50.729> cracks<00:01:51.000> are<00:01:51.270> it<00:01:51.570> could<00:01:51.899> still<00:01:52.200> break

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
the cracks are it could still break

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.190 
the cracks are it could still break
there<00:01:52.799> in<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.250> future<00:01:53.509> because<00:01:54.509> this<00:01:54.869> one<00:01:55.049> is

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
there in the future because this one is

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.440 
there in the future because this one is
so<00:01:55.470> badly<00:01:55.740> damaged<00:01:56.430> it<00:01:56.700> wasn't<00:01:57.030> worth<00:01:57.180> doing

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
so badly damaged it wasn't worth doing

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.209 
so badly damaged it wasn't worth doing
that<00:01:57.689> if<00:01:57.869> I<00:01:57.990> had<00:01:58.140> a<00:01:58.170> gear<00:01:58.409> case<00:01:58.619> like<00:01:58.829> this<00:01:58.979> with

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
that if I had a gear case like this with

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.760 
that if I had a gear case like this with
just<00:01:59.490> one<00:01:59.909> small<00:02:00.180> crack<00:02:00.649> probably<00:02:01.649> I<00:02:01.680> would

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
just one small crack probably I would

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.950 
just one small crack probably I would
try<00:02:02.070> to<00:02:02.100> fix<00:02:02.430> it<00:02:02.640> but<00:02:03.000> in<00:02:03.149> this<00:02:03.270> case<00:02:03.509> it<00:02:03.810> was<00:02:03.899> a

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
try to fix it but in this case it was a

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.830 
try to fix it but in this case it was a
total<00:02:04.350> waste<00:02:04.380> of<00:02:04.649> time<00:02:04.860> and<00:02:04.920> money<00:02:05.189> and<00:02:05.729> if<00:02:06.719> you

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
total waste of time and money and if you

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.389 
total waste of time and money and if you
wold<00:02:07.020> it<00:02:07.170> for<00:02:07.380> a<00:02:07.409> customer<00:02:07.890> and<00:02:08.009> it<00:02:08.129> breaks

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
here where the auger is is I just used

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.589 
here where the auger is is I just used
the<00:03:07.709> studs<00:03:08.040> that's<00:03:08.340> the<00:03:08.579> couch<00:03:08.790> of<00:03:09.030> the<00:03:09.239> auger

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
and bolted it it was quite a job because

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.729 
and bolted it it was quite a job because
you<00:03:14.970> got<00:03:15.239> to<00:03:15.359> make<00:03:15.510> it<00:03:15.540> fit<00:03:15.870> properly<00:03:16.200> and<00:03:16.650> all

that<00:03:16.950> but<00:03:17.909> it's<00:03:18.150> done<00:03:18.359> the<00:03:18.510> job<00:03:18.690> because<00:03:19.109> it's

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
that but it's done the job because it's

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.580 
that but it's done the job because it's
been<00:03:19.409> on<00:03:19.620> there<00:03:19.889> for<00:03:20.150> about<00:03:21.229> two<00:03:22.229> and<00:03:22.260> a<00:03:22.440> half

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:32.960 
and a paintbrush I used trim clad rust
paint<00:03:31.650> for<00:03:31.949> that<00:03:32.069> and<00:03:32.280> put<00:03:32.459> it<00:03:32.549> on<00:03:32.699> really

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
paint for that and put it on really

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.270 
paint for that and put it on really
thick<00:03:33.120> because<00:03:34.079> I<00:03:34.349> get<00:03:34.500> a<00:03:34.530> lot<00:03:34.739> of<00:03:34.769> salt<00:03:35.099> here

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
thick because I get a lot of salt here

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.770 
thick because I get a lot of salt here
where<00:03:35.489> I<00:03:35.519> live<00:03:35.760> I<00:03:35.940> would<00:03:36.180> only<00:03:36.269> make<00:03:36.540> brackets

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
where I live I would only make brackets

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.629 
where I live I would only make brackets
like<00:03:37.169> that<00:03:37.379> if<00:03:37.620> the<00:03:37.739> shell<00:03:38.010> was<00:03:38.159> still<00:03:38.430> good

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:38.639 
like that if the shell was still good

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:41.869 
like that if the shell was still good
and<00:03:38.879> the<00:03:39.780> bad<00:03:39.900> gearbox<00:03:40.500> wasn't<00:03:41.129> in<00:03:41.310> too<00:03:41.639> bad<00:03:41.819> a

00:03:41.869 --> 00:03:41.879 
and the bad gearbox wasn't in too bad a

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:44.479 
and the bad gearbox wasn't in too bad a
shape<00:03:42.109> this<00:03:43.109> gearbox<00:03:43.409> was<00:03:43.829> only<00:03:44.129> slightly

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
shape this gearbox was only slightly

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:46.849 
shape this gearbox was only slightly
cracked<00:03:44.970> where<00:03:45.599> the<00:03:45.750> bolts<00:03:46.079> are<00:03:46.260> so<00:03:46.530> it<00:03:46.709> was

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:46.859 
cracked where the bolts are so it was

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:49.339 
cracked where the bolts are so it was
worth<00:03:47.040> fixing<00:03:47.579> like<00:03:47.970> that<00:03:48.180> and<00:03:48.449> there<00:03:49.229> was<00:03:49.319> a

00:03:49.339 --> 00:03:49.349 
worth fixing like that and there was a

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:51.289 
worth fixing like that and there was a
lot<00:03:49.470> of<00:03:49.590> hours<00:03:49.979> involved<00:03:50.459> doing<00:03:50.669> that<00:03:50.819> so<00:03:51.150> like

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
lot of hours involved doing that so like

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:53.119 
lot of hours involved doing that so like
I<00:03:51.419> said<00:03:51.479> if<00:03:51.900> you<00:03:52.019> do<00:03:52.169> it<00:03:52.260> for<00:03:52.440> yourself<00:03:52.530> it's

00:03:53.119 --> 00:03:53.129 
I said if you do it for yourself it's

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:55.099 
I said if you do it for yourself it's
worth<00:03:53.370> it<00:03:53.609> if<00:03:54.209> you<00:03:54.419> want<00:03:54.629> to<00:03:54.720> do<00:03:54.840> it<00:03:54.930> for<00:03:55.049> a

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:55.109 
worth it if you want to do it for a

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:57.170 
worth it if you want to do it for a
customer<00:03:55.680> it's<00:03:55.949> kind<00:03:56.189> of<00:03:56.280> hard<00:03:56.459> to<00:03:56.519> charge<00:03:56.909> for

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
customer it's kind of hard to charge for

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.089 
customer it's kind of hard to charge for
all<00:03:57.299> those<00:03:57.479> hours<00:03:57.689> doing<00:03:58.199> that<00:03:58.470> unless<00:03:58.680> you

00:03:59.089 --> 00:03:59.099 
all those hours doing that unless you

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:01.189 
all those hours doing that unless you
make<00:03:59.280> a<00:03:59.310> lot<00:03:59.549> of<00:03:59.609> brackets<00:04:00.120> in<00:04:00.299> advance<00:04:00.689> then

00:04:01.189 --> 00:04:01.199 
make a lot of brackets in advance then

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:02.899 
make a lot of brackets in advance then
when<00:04:01.439> somebody<00:04:01.829> comes<00:04:02.069> you<00:04:02.280> just<00:04:02.310> slop<00:04:02.669> went

00:04:02.899 --> 00:04:02.909 
when somebody comes you just slop went

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:05.479 
when somebody comes you just slop went
on<00:04:03.030> but<00:04:03.629> make<00:04:03.810> sure<00:04:03.840> if<00:04:04.049> you<00:04:04.139> do<00:04:04.319> that<00:04:04.530> that<00:04:05.370> the

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 
on but make sure if you do that that the

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:08.240 
on but make sure if you do that that the
gearbox<00:04:05.909> isn't<00:04:06.209> too<00:04:06.810> cracked<00:04:07.169> and<00:04:07.439> also<00:04:08.040> that

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
gearbox isn't too cracked and also that

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.219 
gearbox isn't too cracked and also that
the<00:04:08.400> auger<00:04:08.519> shell<00:04:08.909> isn't<00:04:09.840> rotted<00:04:09.989> out

00:04:10.219 --> 00:04:10.229 
the auger shell isn't rotted out

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:12.619 
the auger shell isn't rotted out
completely<00:04:10.739> also<00:04:11.639> another<00:04:11.790> tip<00:04:12.180> if<00:04:12.389> you<00:04:12.509> have

00:04:12.619 --> 00:04:12.629 
completely also another tip if you have

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:14.599 
completely also another tip if you have
small<00:04:13.049> cracks<00:04:13.379> on<00:04:13.620> your<00:04:13.859> gearbox<00:04:14.069> and<00:04:14.519> you

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:14.609 
small cracks on your gearbox and you

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:16.909 
small cracks on your gearbox and you
want<00:04:14.790> to<00:04:14.879> get<00:04:15.030> them<00:04:15.180> welded<00:04:15.389> it<00:04:16.380> may<00:04:16.560> be<00:04:16.620> hard

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
want to get them welded it may be hard

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:19.099 
want to get them welded it may be hard
to<00:04:16.979> use<00:04:17.190> a<00:04:17.220> stick<00:04:17.639> welder<00:04:18.030> on<00:04:18.239> this<00:04:18.299> metal

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
to use a stick welder on this metal

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:21.680 
to use a stick welder on this metal
because<00:04:19.409> it's<00:04:19.590> so<00:04:19.829> thin<00:04:20.329> probably<00:04:21.329> the<00:04:21.479> best

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
because it's so thin probably the best

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:23.180 
because it's so thin probably the best
option<00:04:22.169> would<00:04:22.320> be<00:04:22.380> to<00:04:22.529> use<00:04:22.770> a<00:04:22.800> TIG<00:04:23.159> welder

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
option would be to use a TIG welder

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.000 
option would be to use a TIG welder
because<00:04:24.060> it<00:04:24.419> can<00:04:24.630> weld<00:04:25.200> much<00:04:25.650> smaller

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
because it can weld much smaller

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:27.060 
because it can weld much smaller
material<00:04:26.639> like<00:04:26.789> that

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
material like that

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.820 
material like that
without<00:04:27.550> making<00:04:28.000> more<00:04:28.690> damage<00:04:29.140> to<00:04:29.470> the<00:04:29.590> part

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
without making more damage to the part

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:32.310 
without making more damage to the part
itself<00:04:29.950> if<00:04:30.940> you<00:04:31.180> weld<00:04:31.360> it<00:04:31.510> yourself<00:04:31.930> then<00:04:32.140> it's

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:32.320 
itself if you weld it yourself then it's

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.590 
itself if you weld it yourself then it's
probably<00:04:32.680> worth<00:04:33.100> it<00:04:33.310> financially<00:04:34.000> but<00:04:34.360> if<00:04:34.510> you

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:34.600 
probably worth it financially but if you

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.510 
probably worth it financially but if you
have<00:04:34.690> to<00:04:34.840> pay<00:04:35.050> a<00:04:35.080> welder<00:04:35.500> to<00:04:35.770> weld<00:04:35.950> all<00:04:36.220> those

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:36.520 
have to pay a welder to weld all those

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.030 
have to pay a welder to weld all those
cracks<00:04:36.850> I<00:04:37.210> would<00:04:38.020> say<00:04:38.230> you're<00:04:38.410> better<00:04:38.620> off<00:04:38.710> to

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:39.040 
cracks I would say you're better off to

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:42.480 
cracks I would say you're better off to
go<00:04:39.160> buy<00:04:39.340> a<00:04:39.580> brand-new<00:04:40.060> part<00:04:41.040> another<00:04:42.040> question

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:42.490 
go buy a brand-new part another question

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:44.850 
go buy a brand-new part another question

this I got a whole whack of these I got
about<00:04:52.120> a<00:04:52.180> hundred<00:04:52.390> of<00:04:52.660> these<00:04:52.780> and<00:04:53.110> they're

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:53.710 
about a hundred of these and they're

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:56.460 
about a hundred of these and they're
very<00:04:53.740> handy<00:04:54.520> to<00:04:55.240> put<00:04:55.420> everything<00:04:55.630> in<00:04:55.960> I<00:04:56.140> got

very handy to put everything in I got
these<00:04:56.650> from<00:04:56.830> a<00:04:56.980> factory<00:04:57.250> and<00:04:57.610> they<00:04:58.030> said<00:04:58.270> there

00:04:58.410 --> 00:04:58.420 
these from a factory and they said there

00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:59.970 
these from a factory and they said there
was<00:04:58.510> a<00:04:58.540> defect<00:04:59.050> in<00:04:59.140> all<00:04:59.440> of<00:04:59.620> these<00:04:59.740> so<00:04:59.950> they

00:04:59.970 --> 00:04:59.980 
was a defect in all of these so they

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:02.100 
was a defect in all of these so they
couldn't<00:05:00.310> use<00:05:00.490> them<00:05:00.670> you<00:05:01.510> can<00:05:01.660> also<00:05:01.810> use<00:05:01.930> a

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:02.110 
couldn't use them you can also use a

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:04.770 
couldn't use them you can also use a
magnetic<00:05:02.530> tray<00:05:02.950> that's<00:05:03.160> good<00:05:03.430> too<00:05:03.640> and<00:05:03.850> what

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:04.780 
magnetic tray that's good too and what

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:06.780
