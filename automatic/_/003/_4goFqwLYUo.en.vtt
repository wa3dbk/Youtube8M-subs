00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:12.869
 I'll introduce you 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:18.000
 on another electric bicycle model 

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:22.770
 this bicycle has characteristics of 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.620
 style of a mountain bike 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:29.490
 the motorcycle 

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:33.480
 more similar to the design that we 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.620
 we have used in relation to our 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.840
 previous 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.430
 on the model from here boarding we already 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.430
 we present here on another occasion 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:48.520
 This bike is made by eco 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:52.460
 ecoestadium start a national manufacturer 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:54.440
 in the interior of SÃ£o Paulo that already comes 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.640
 developing this product 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:00.149
 some years 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.879
 then the sub 11 with the knowledge and 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:08.159
 have all the pest easiness of 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:11.670
 maintenance here for our product as 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:14.430
 you can see the picture of her 14 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:18.630
 developed especially for this 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:22.770
 electric bicycle option 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:25.790
 having a cradle in which is housed the 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:29.190
 batteries here behind the bank 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:33.869
 different from our other sequence 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:37.160
 that the picture was made and the 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:43.910
 batteries positioned in the front 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:48.679
 together with the handlebar has differences 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:53.399
 quite large in relation to the options 

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:56.399
 for you to climb on the bike and 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:59.700
 this model allows entry by the 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:01.740
 front then always easier to be 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.640
 used by women 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.790
 and this other one did not put to the leg by 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.030
 back riding like a bicycle 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:13.799
 traditional 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:17.280
 they also have lower frames 

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:19.980
 it is not with the central cross passing 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:23.900
 in a lower way allowing a 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.900
 more comfortable climb 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:33.519
 its handlebars brings the possibilities of 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:37.360
 adjustment of both positioning and 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:43.750
 height with a good position 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:46.180
 comfortable to use is the method the mode of 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:51.340
 Do you use there's a button? 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:54.640
 turn on / off here a fist and where there is 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:03:01.989
 indication of full battery charge by the 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:05.829
 half or here it also has a 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:08.650
 six-speed shimano gearbox 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:13.510
 then this bike has a 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:18.220
 possibility of much better use for those who 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:22.090
 or cycling with really 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:25.170
 six gears allowing more comfort 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.170
 at the time of the pedaling 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:32.010
 remembering our previous bike 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:33.660
 this model bike here not so much 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:37.170
 fixed exchange 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:39.030
 so you have no gear ratios 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:46.680
 a bicycle more towards whom 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:48.959
 want to accelerate than to pedal to 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.820
 bike also in a quality 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:56.239
 higher 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:04:04.800
 already features spare aluminum wheels 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:04:08.310
 aerial rim 26 kenda tires then owns 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:12.180
 a comfort a quality well 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:15.540
 upper right there to walk big now 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:17.359
 of her is a great differential. 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:22.740
 really a motor 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:28.180
 despite being an engine of 350 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:31.050
 bacchus similar to Kim's 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:34.270
 this engine was developed jointly 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:39.000
 with the staff of eco start 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:42.699
 then it internally has a 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:47.320
 reduction as if it were an internal exchange 

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:49.150
 which greatly multiplies the speed at 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:52.030
 speed but not so the transmission 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:54.190
 force torque it 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:58.240
 What we can say is that the 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:05:02.830
 motorcycle weighing 350 watts 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:06.639
 also it has an operating much more 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:09.699
 strong in terms of transmission torque 

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:15.960
 of strength than the bike here in 

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:15.960
 all 350 votes too 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:25.550
 we also want to highlight the autonomy of 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:32.470
 bike that with this engine of 350 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:37.190
 watts allows us around 35 to 38 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:40.000
 kilometers of autonomy but aided 

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:43.430
 exchange rate and allowing good 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:46.000
 driving a good pedaling 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:50.780
 we can reach 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:53.410
 quietly 50 depending on location 

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:54.650
 where he will walk with her 60 

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:58.030
 kilometers 

00:05:54.650 --> 00:06:02.240
 so the bike has a very long range 

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:05.920
 interesting this model that we are 

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:10.070
 demonstrating that there is no Friday 

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:14.720
 front loading load things 

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:18.320
 so it helps a lot but they are is a 

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:21.800
 item are available 

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:25.340
 these items to be placed - have 

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:27.560
 interest in doing a test drive is 

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:30.110
 try your bikes 

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:35.750
 they are all available 

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:38.330
 www access point proved to account 

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:42.230
 You will find the information 

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:44.590
 needed to fish said that it was worth 

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:44.590
 and even
