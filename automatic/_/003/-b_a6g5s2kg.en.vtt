00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:03.740
 to me 

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:08.270
 or the technological one we have already tried the 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:10.639
 new xbox console here in madrid 

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:12.350
 week we're going to see playstation 4 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:14.660
 outside 

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:19.040
 well we start ahead with a 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:20.600
 dvd reader and also bluray like 

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:24.600
 I had already passed in previous edition of 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:28.980
 this console playstation3 and two usb 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:32.030
 will be 3.0 the xbox will have 3 usb and 1 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.030
 lateral and two rear 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:37.840
 we meet 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:41.540
 pure design a little ventilation 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:43.079
 Also on this side and let behind 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:46.559
 to see what the 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:49.440
 playstation if we compare it with that of 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.809
 xbox is like 4 times smaller the 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.909
 true and good functioning 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.130
 We will have to prove it well in terms of 

00:00:53.909 --> 00:00:57.350
 I send 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:59.450
 it's a little bigger than the one in the 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:02.390
 previous playstation but the truth is 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:04.880
 feels very good in the hand if we see the 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:07.490
 material is plastic ahead with 

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:09.440
 exactly the same as the previous command and 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.970
 from behind we find a 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.530
 rugged plastic that the truth is 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.040
 pretty comfortable 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.440
 quite 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.950
 around here we find a light that 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:21.680
 it's a novelty 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:24.110
 to work with the playstation eye 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.970
 and good each one each command has a 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:30.170
 different color is the way it has 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:32.360
 to be able to locate usb connection for 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.760
 can plug it 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:37.310
 and recharge it 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:40.550
 the triggers are new they are much more 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.290
 sensitive are they are not do not generate as much 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:46.370
 resistance and that goes pretty well 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:49.220
 I also really like 2 l 1 and r1 that 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:52.130
 they are bigger they are wider and it is 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:55.460
 comfortable also from the front 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:57.710
 we are with a touch panel that 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.390
 It serves good for different games and 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:03.110
 also for navigation within the 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:05.990
 console the analog sticks are very 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:08.119
 similar changes a bit the format and 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:11.330
 they go pretty well they are also a bit 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:14.810
 bigger the digital sticks and the 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:17.330
 buttons these too if we see 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:20.030
 the circle this is smaller and is 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.920
 Quite comfortable 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:25.370
 we also find two buttons 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:28.160
 one of them that is a novelty that every 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.600
 time we want to share something that 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.400
 we are doing the console with some 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.740
 friend giving the button what we can do 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:37.100
 directly on YouTube on 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:39.140
 facebook or in the service that you ramÃ³n 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.060
 on the options button that I also 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.160
 we knew playstation also 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:46.070
 known and here we are also 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.570
 with another novelty that is a speaker that 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:50.750
 well it works little like the one of the u and no 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:52.460
 that generates its own noises and so on and 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.970
 it goes quite well finally we 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:57.470
 we find with an extension output 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:59.750
 to connect with others 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.910
 peripherals novelty and also other 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.850
 novelty that is an audio output for 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:06.650
 can use the remote with headphones and 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:08.770
 can play directly by connecting it 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.930
 from here 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:13.750
 and now is when I like a lot I think 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:17.110
 that was bigger is not that big and it's going 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:19.420
 really good in terms of comfort and 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:21.100
 We are here with Javier Borrego 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.810
 playstation 4 that will comment on a 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:25.610
 little news that this new 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:27.650
 console that is very well open 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:29.030
 I did not want to ask you first before 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:32.630
 nothing the differences between the 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:33.950
 playstation 3 and 4 are very 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:35.300
 different 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:37.460
 4 in the natural evolution of 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:38.870
 playstation3 and the origin of playstation 

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:40.400
 4 us that the demand of the 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.350
 players we say it's a console 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.460
 created by players for players who 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:45.170
 They are very nice paper but 

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:46.730
 really I that everything that it takes speaks 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:48.680
 and 4 are things that are already being used 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:50.210
 actually but more uncomfortably 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.610
 and also a little bit because of evolution 

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:54.830
 of the natural video game itself in that 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:56.270
 pretend to differentiate are and with this 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:57.890
 new console 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:59.930
 Well look when I was telling you this about 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:01.220
 players for players the first thing that 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:03.230
 let's find is a console is very 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:04.580
 easy to develop the architecture 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:06.560
 it can be similar to what a 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:09.680
 super pc only that at a much more price 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.940
 economic and 100% focused on playing now 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.530
 same the launch games have 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:14.960
 incredible quality as is the case with 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:16.880
 fifth where then we can talk about him 

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:18.170
 and we even have indie games that 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.940
 they are developing for playstation 

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:22.250
 four Spanish companies that the year that 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.450
 comes will launch in titles for play 4 yo 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:25.520
 I think all this is very favorable that 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:27.110
 really be easier to develop and 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.300
 that invite new companies to do it 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:30.470
 They have finished loading times 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.270
 arrive with a game home and wait 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:34.460
 about 20 minutes of installation this is 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:35.930
 will do in the background clear the 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:37.340
 facilities also that was a flaw 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:39.710
 quite important of the playstation3 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:40.850
 to be the background it's from 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:42.410
 done let's have an application on 

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:44.360
 our mobile on our tablet is going to be 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:46.760
 multi system and free and with this 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:49.010
 application we will be able to download the 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:50.780
 game that just came out update the 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:53.000
 system talk with our friends to 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:55.430
 organize a game this afternoon here they go 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.350
 to be able to do many things we are going to have 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:59.180
 dual launch colors also 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:01.280
 is I personally like more the 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:03.290
 color controls also the console 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:04.880
 comes with an included headset but it's a 

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:07.520
 monkey headset will also see the headset 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:09.770
 Stereo in day of a very good quality 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:11.180
 and we have the load control support 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:13.310
 so, yes, we came out wrapped in 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:17.000
 accessories and of course the camera 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:18.830
 the camera in this generation 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.030
 I could say if for example the world is going 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:21.650
 to keep working they will continue 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:24.080
 selling it for this new console or 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:25.970
 be do not stop doing it look is the 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:27.830
 first that all the questions 

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:29.720
 Move accessories are still valid for 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:31.250
 Playstation 4 are the only accessories 

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:33.620
 that we have that are 100% compatible 

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:35.420
 we do not have the full list yet because 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:37.750
 is this because the command itself is to that 

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:39.550
 health and it 's the motion sensor 

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:41.290
 the most basic use they have is that of 

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:43.120
 to be a butch and to be able to use it 

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:44.260
 as motion control so that the 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:45.700
 command then has other functionalities 

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.830
 linked to health and the sensor 

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:49.870
 movement but yes yes of course everything 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:52.300
 whatever it is very still in force with that 

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:54.640
 exclusive games will go on sale then 

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:57.250
 the truth that we have a very good catalog 

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:59.310
 on the one hand more than 30 titles supported 

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:01.930
 by being parties and games of 

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:03.700
 discharge that we have in the blind and by 

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:05.020
 another part because we have killzone that is 

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:07.180
 the first 100% shooter made for 

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:08.770
 Playstation 4 

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:11.080
 is an innovation in the sector of 

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:13.840
 shooter huge scenarios the quality 

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:16.230
 graphic I think yes it shows the 

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:19.080
 change from one generation to another 

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:21.540
 custom maps an experience of 

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:23.850
 more open online game so that if 

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:25.020
 we are a super shooter player 

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:26.910
 first day we will have all the 

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:28.800
 content unlocked all maps 

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:30.900
 all weapons and we can configure the 

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:32.160
 game as we like and for players 

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:33.720
 more novices or who do not have as much 

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:35.310
 experience then they can also 

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:36.690
 set the game and restrict the 

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:39.180
 use to users who have more 

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:40.920
 experience of more hours of play then 

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:42.510
 we have also born that is a game of 

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:44.280
 platforms but do not underestimate it 

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:46.560
 the creator of nothing who is the creator of 

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:48.060
 playstation 4 mark cerny and it's also the 

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:49.530
 creator of spears or dragon crash 

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:52.260
 bandicoot has participated in jak and 

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:53.730
 daxter uncharted motorstorm we go a 

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:56.310
 important character within 

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:57.840
 playstation and then on the other hand and in 

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:59.490
 the console includes a play room that is a 

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:01.560
 game that takes advantage of the camera and that 

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:02.580
 It is also a very good technical demo that 

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:04.290
 will allow us to know perfectly 

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:06.180
 everything that the command does everything 

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:08.010
 Does the camera recognize speech 

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:10.310
 facial recognition all these 

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:10.310
 new features
