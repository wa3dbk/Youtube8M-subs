00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.680
 six years after roméo and juliette la 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.510
 choreographer neuchàtoi joëlle bouvier 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.939
 found the ballet of the great theater of 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.580
 Geneva with another famous story 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.470
 of love that of tristan and iseult put 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.859
 in music this time by richard 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.960
 wagner 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:31.039
 between two rehearsals she talks to us 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.039
 of the creation of this show 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:34.470
 e 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:38.579
 and 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.180
 tristan and iseult seven different from 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.380
 roméo juliette because it's a love 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:51.540
 with betrayal 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:51.540
 so it's a guilty love 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.470
 it was absolutely different that's the 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.910
 wagner music and music from 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:59.410
 prokofiev the music of prokofiev it's 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:00.880
 a music for ballet she was 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:05.489
 written in the idea that she was going to do 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:05.489
 to dance the music of wagner not at all 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.490
 it's not a music that counts 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.869
 Saturday who listens and then who gets 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.210
 feels I think the dancers are 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:16.070
 obliged to go through 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.820
 their emotions to be able to be in 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.820
 agree with the music 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.850
 there are elements of music that I 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:33.340
 can not use because they 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:36.040
 belong to the opera and they are 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.780
 really far from the dance and I think 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.330
 that dance can not compete with 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:43.870
 the dynamics sometimes used by wagner 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:45.010
 on the other hand, there are times when I believe 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:47.710
 in any case, that's what we 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:51.270
 tried to do we married the 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.270
 choreography and this operatic music 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:00.090
 I tried to keep 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:04.500
 three acts I kept the timeline 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:07.399
 and then I broke the po the beautiful the beautiful 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.959
 object that wagner has built and that is 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:12.840
 so famous and then I have 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:14.480
 replenish a little more 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.280
 condensed 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:20.650
 where I tell the same story but of 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.650
 more narrow way 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:27.720
 the piece will last an hour and a half on 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.620
 a work that lasts four hours 30 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.610
 I hope people will let themselves 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:36.880
 take-in in torment and 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:40.260
 and romance and power and 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:44.220
 sometimes the immense stripping and 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.220
 sensitivity of this music 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:02.770
 come see because I have selected 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:04.480
 nuggets logic gic-g raked all this 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:07.980
 that I found the most touching and of 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.980
 more useful for me for dancing 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.840
 1 

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:35.349
 hi for me joëlle's world
