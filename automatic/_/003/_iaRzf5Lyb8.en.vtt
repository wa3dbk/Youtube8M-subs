00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:00.880 
trying to find a decent dirt bit pattern
you<00:01:58.820> know<00:01:58.970> maybe<00:01:59.600> just<00:01:59.750> incorporate<00:02:00.650> some

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
you know maybe just incorporate some

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:02.260 
you know maybe just incorporate some
lighter<00:02:01.100> twitches<00:02:01.729> throughout<00:02:02.000> the<00:02:02.090> day<00:02:02.210> too

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
lighter twitches throughout the day too

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.120 
lighter twitches throughout the day too
because<00:02:02.780> you<00:02:02.900> never<00:02:03.020> know<00:02:03.320> what<00:02:03.800> the<00:02:03.920> bites

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
because you never know what the bites

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:05.880 
because you never know what the bites
going<00:02:04.430> to<00:02:04.490> be<00:02:04.610> like<00:02:04.850> and<00:02:05.420> what<00:02:05.600> they're

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
going to be like and what they're

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:14.520 
going to be like and what they're
there's<00:02:06.890> one<00:02:07.130> right<00:02:07.250> there<00:02:09.190> that's<00:02:10.190> a<00:02:10.369> decent

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:24.640 

check<00:02:15.530> outside<00:02:15.950> of<00:02:16.100> the<00:02:16.160> mouth

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.690 

that's<00:02:25.650> a<00:02:25.739> nice<00:02:25.950> one<00:02:26.129> right<00:02:26.250> there<00:02:26.549> see<00:02:27.150> when<00:02:28.109> I

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
that's a nice one right there see when I

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.830 
that's a nice one right there see when I
started<00:02:29.700> actually<00:02:29.879> twitching<00:02:30.450> a<00:02:30.510> little<00:02:30.540> bit

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
started actually twitching a little bit

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.750 
started actually twitching a little bit
softer<00:02:31.290> that's<00:02:31.859> when<00:02:32.069> it<00:02:32.159> ate<00:02:32.310> it<00:02:32.459> so<00:02:32.609> what

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
softer that's when it ate it so what

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.720 
softer that's when it ate it so what
I'll<00:02:32.849> do<00:02:33.000> now<00:02:33.030> I'll<00:02:33.750> go<00:02:34.049> a<00:02:34.319> couple<00:02:35.099> more<00:02:35.280> you

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
I'll do now I'll go a couple more you

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.899 
I'll do now I'll go a couple more you
know<00:02:36.140> 15<00:02:37.140> 20<00:02:37.439> more<00:02:37.590> casts<00:02:38.129> and<00:02:38.250> I'll<00:02:38.670> try<00:02:38.849> to

00:02:38.899 --> 00:02:38.909 
know 15 20 more casts and I'll try to

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:40.399 
know 15 20 more casts and I'll try to
replicate<00:02:39.420> that<00:02:39.450> retrieve<00:02:39.930> and<00:02:40.140> see<00:02:40.230> if<00:02:40.319> I

00:02:40.399 --> 00:02:40.409 
replicate that retrieve and see if I

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:47.959 
replicate that retrieve and see if I
can't<00:02:40.620> catch<00:02:40.799> some<00:02:40.950> more<00:02:41.099> goodness<00:02:46.790> and<00:02:47.790> keep

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:47.969 
can't catch some more goodness and keep

00:02:47.969 --> 00:02:51.530 
can't catch some more goodness and keep
in<00:02:48.090> mind<00:02:48.329> that<00:02:48.599> the<00:02:49.560> skirt<00:02:50.129> bait<00:02:50.370> fishing<00:02:50.670> is<00:02:51.000> a

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
in mind that the skirt bait fishing is a

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.740 
in mind that the skirt bait fishing is a
relatively<00:02:52.109> clear<00:02:53.069> water<00:02:53.569> presentation<00:02:54.569> and

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
relatively clear water presentation and

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.440 
relatively clear water presentation and
I<00:02:55.260> say<00:02:55.500> that<00:02:55.739> because<00:02:55.950> this<00:02:56.939> is<00:02:57.000> a<00:02:57.150> really

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
I say that because this is a really

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.869 
I say that because this is a really
visual<00:02:57.689> cue<00:02:58.230> for<00:02:58.260> a<00:02:58.500> bass<00:02:58.739> you<00:02:59.400> know<00:02:59.519> we're<00:02:59.730> not

00:02:59.869 --> 00:02:59.879 
visual cue for a bass you know we're not

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:01.789 
visual cue for a bass you know we're not
relying<00:03:00.269> on<00:03:00.510> lateral<00:03:01.019> lines<00:03:01.290> or<00:03:01.590> water

displacement<00:03:02.310> this<00:03:03.090> bass<00:03:03.329> is<00:03:03.540> going<00:03:03.629> to<00:03:03.780> see

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
displacement this bass is going to see

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:06.319

this bait from a long way away come up

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:11.539 
this bait from a long way away come up
and<00:03:06.419> attack<00:03:06.510> it<00:03:09.769> we<00:03:10.769> first<00:03:11.010> put<00:03:11.250> the<00:03:11.340> boat<00:03:11.519> in

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:11.549 
and attack it we first put the boat in

and attack it we first put the boat in
this<00:03:11.849> morning<00:03:12.209> I<00:03:13.159> noticed<00:03:14.159> a<00:03:14.250> bunch<00:03:14.459> of

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:14.579 
this morning I noticed a bunch of

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:16.459 
this morning I noticed a bunch of
smaller<00:03:14.849> bass<00:03:15.150> up<00:03:15.359> on<00:03:15.480> the<00:03:15.599> bank<00:03:15.810> and<00:03:16.079> I<00:03:16.290> can

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:16.469 
smaller bass up on the bank and I can

00:03:16.469 --> 00:03:17.780 
smaller bass up on the bank and I can
see<00:03:16.680> a<00:03:16.709> long<00:03:16.919> way<00:03:16.980> in<00:03:17.189> the<00:03:17.280> water<00:03:17.400> you<00:03:17.669> know

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
see a long way in the water you know

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.270 
see a long way in the water you know
probably<00:03:18.450> five<00:03:18.659> six<00:03:18.689> feet<00:03:19.230> which<00:03:19.439> for<00:03:19.739> this

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
probably five six feet which for this

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.740 
probably five six feet which for this
area<00:03:20.459> of<00:03:20.549> the<00:03:20.609> country<00:03:20.760> is<00:03:20.939> fairly<00:03:21.150> clear<00:03:21.419> so

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
area of the country is fairly clear so

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.059 
area of the country is fairly clear so
you<00:03:21.930> know<00:03:22.109> that's<00:03:22.319> why<00:03:22.469> I<00:03:22.500> thought<00:03:22.799> I<00:03:23.040> could

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:23.069 
you know that's why I thought I could

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:26.720 
you know that's why I thought I could
capitalize<00:03:23.879> on<00:03:24.120> that<00:03:24.989> visual<00:03:25.290> cue<00:03:25.980> with<00:03:26.579> this

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
capitalize on that visual cue with this

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.360 
capitalize on that visual cue with this
jerk<00:03:27.000> plate<00:03:27.349> color<00:03:28.349> selection<00:03:28.859> can<00:03:28.979> be<00:03:29.010> really

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
jerk plate color selection can be really

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.170 
jerk plate color selection can be really
important<00:03:30.109> try<00:03:31.109> it<00:03:31.699> it<00:03:32.699> can<00:03:32.849> be<00:03:32.970> really

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
important try it it can be really

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.550 
important try it it can be really
important<00:03:33.569> when<00:03:33.599> you're<00:03:33.810> fishing<00:03:33.989> jerk<00:03:34.319> baits

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
important when you're fishing jerk baits

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.530 
important when you're fishing jerk baits
now<00:03:35.099> we're<00:03:35.400> fishing<00:03:35.729> for<00:03:35.909> Florida<00:03:36.209> stranding

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
now we're fishing for Florida stranding

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.719 
now we're fishing for Florida stranding
largemouth<00:03:36.930> right<00:03:37.229> now<00:03:37.409> and<00:03:37.680> the<00:03:38.159> southeast

00:03:38.719 --> 00:03:38.729 
largemouth right now and the southeast

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:40.460 
largemouth right now and the southeast
so<00:03:39.060> they<00:03:39.449> tend<00:03:39.720> to<00:03:39.750> get<00:03:39.900> a<00:03:39.959> little<00:03:40.079> bit<00:03:40.260> finicky

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
so they tend to get a little bit finicky

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.559 
so they tend to get a little bit finicky
as<00:03:40.769> far<00:03:40.949> as<00:03:41.040> color<00:03:41.250> selection<00:03:41.849> so<00:03:42.329> in<00:03:42.449> this

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:42.569 
as far as color selection so in this

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:43.909 
as far as color selection so in this
clear<00:03:42.870> water<00:03:43.079> I'm<00:03:43.319> going<00:03:43.409> to<00:03:43.500> use<00:03:43.620> a<00:03:43.650> more

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:43.919 
clear water I'm going to use a more

00:03:43.919 --> 00:03:47.360 
clear water I'm going to use a more
natural<00:03:44.760> pattern<00:03:45.239> just<00:03:45.629> a<00:03:45.870> shad<00:03:46.409> pattern<00:03:46.859> but

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
natural pattern just a shad pattern but

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:48.949 
natural pattern just a shad pattern but
then<00:03:47.519> when<00:03:47.639> you<00:03:47.729> go<00:03:47.849> up<00:03:47.970> north<00:03:48.000> and<00:03:48.329> start

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
then when you go up north and start

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:50.240 
then when you go up north and start
hitting<00:03:49.260> you<00:03:49.319> know<00:03:49.349> start<00:03:49.739> chasing<00:03:49.919> big

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
hitting you know start chasing big

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.099 
hitting you know start chasing big
smallmouth<00:03:50.609> sometimes<00:03:51.419> those<00:03:51.629> go<00:03:51.840> to<00:03:51.900> your
