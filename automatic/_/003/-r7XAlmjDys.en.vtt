silicone joints cure overnight and begin

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:49.249 
silicone joints cure overnight and begin
grouting<00:05:43.500> the<00:05:43.590> next<00:05:43.860> day<00:05:47.689> since<00:05:48.689> silicone<00:05:49.110> is

00:05:49.249 --> 00:05:49.259 
grouting the next day since silicone is

00:05:49.259 --> 00:05:51.409 
grouting the next day since silicone is
a<00:05:49.289> slightly<00:05:49.620> flexible<00:05:50.129> material<00:05:50.759> the<00:05:51.150> wall

a slightly flexible material the wall

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:53.089 
a slightly flexible material the wall
will<00:05:51.599> have<00:05:51.719> a<00:05:51.750> tendency<00:05:52.050> to<00:05:52.349> sway<00:05:52.740> until

will have a tendency to sway until
grouting<00:05:53.490> is<00:05:53.580> completed<00:05:54.090> anyways<00:05:54.479> so<00:05:55.169> the

00:05:55.279 --> 00:05:55.289 
grouting is completed anyways so the

00:05:55.289 --> 00:05:57.020 
grouting is completed anyways so the
extra<00:05:55.620> curing<00:05:55.979> time<00:05:56.159> should<00:05:56.520> come<00:05:56.550> in<00:05:56.879> handy

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:57.030 
extra curing time should come in handy

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:59.360 
extra curing time should come in handy
for<00:05:57.389> a<00:05:57.419> beginner<00:05:57.780> as<00:05:57.990> the<00:05:58.590> silicone<00:05:59.069> will<00:05:59.219> be

00:05:59.360 --> 00:05:59.370 
for a beginner as the silicone will be

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:01.010 
for a beginner as the silicone will be
more<00:05:59.639> adhered<00:06:00.000> to<00:06:00.120> the<00:06:00.240> wall<00:06:00.449> joints<00:06:00.840> when

more adhered to the wall joints when

00:06:05.719 --> 00:06:05.729 
grouting begins if you take the time to

00:06:05.729 --> 00:06:08.149 
grouting begins if you take the time to
