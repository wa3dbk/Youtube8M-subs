like<00:02:45.420> 16<00:02:45.930> or<00:02:46.049> triplets<00:02:46.469> some<00:02:50.150> which<00:02:51.150> does

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:51.359 
like 16 or triplets some which does

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:52.759 
like 16 or triplets some which does
sound<00:02:51.540> like<00:02:51.599> it's<00:02:51.780> gonna<00:02:51.870> be<00:02:52.019> very<00:02:52.049> fast<00:02:52.500> but

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
sound like it's gonna be very fast but

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:54.410 
sound like it's gonna be very fast but
actually<00:02:53.069> the<00:02:53.159> mechanics<00:02:53.609> of<00:02:53.730> the<00:02:53.849> lick<00:02:54.000> it's

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
actually the mechanics of the lick it's

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.020 
actually the mechanics of the lick it's
pretty<00:02:54.629> easy<00:02:54.930> to<00:02:55.829> keep<00:02:55.980> in<00:02:56.159> tempo<00:02:56.549> and<00:02:56.760> once

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
pretty easy to keep in tempo and once

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.369 
pretty easy to keep in tempo and once
you've<00:02:57.150> got<00:02:57.239> the<00:02:57.329> pull<00:02:57.480> off<00:02:57.629> score<00:02:57.900> and<00:02:58.049> that's

00:02:58.369 --> 00:02:58.379 
you've got the pull off score and that's

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:00.110 
you've got the pull off score and that's
an<00:02:58.560> easy<00:02:58.709> lick<00:02:58.950> but<00:02:59.310> those<00:02:59.519> sound<00:02:59.730> or<00:02:59.849> some

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
an easy lick but those sound or some

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.240 
an easy lick but those sound or some
more<00:03:00.299> all<00:03:00.720> right<00:03:00.840> so<00:03:01.439> let's<00:03:01.920> just<00:03:02.069> talk<00:03:02.189> a

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
more all right so let's just talk a

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.819 
more all right so let's just talk a
little<00:03:02.519> bit<00:03:02.670> about<00:03:02.700> the<00:03:02.939> articulation<00:03:03.739> when<00:03:04.739> I

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:04.829 
little bit about the articulation when I

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:06.500 
little bit about the articulation when I
start<00:03:05.040> to<00:03:05.159> play<00:03:05.310> the<00:03:05.459> lick<00:03:05.639> I'm<00:03:05.879> starting<00:03:06.420> off

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
start to play the lick I'm starting off

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:07.940 
start to play the lick I'm starting off
with<00:03:06.599> a<00:03:06.689> little<00:03:06.750> bit<00:03:06.989> of<00:03:07.109> right<00:03:07.319> hand<00:03:07.620> palm

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
with a little bit of right hand palm

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.860 
with a little bit of right hand palm
muting<00:03:08.370> where<00:03:08.790> I<00:03:08.819> take<00:03:09.180> the<00:03:09.239> heel<00:03:09.540> of<00:03:09.629> my<00:03:09.689> hand

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
muting where I take the heel of my hand

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.020 
muting where I take the heel of my hand
and<00:03:10.530> lay<00:03:10.709> it<00:03:10.799> on<00:03:10.889> the<00:03:11.040> bridge<00:03:11.219> in<00:03:11.400> just<00:03:11.609> waffle

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
and lay it on the bridge in just waffle

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.720 
and lay it on the bridge in just waffle
on<00:03:12.180> dampen<00:03:13.069> the<00:03:14.069> same<00:03:14.280> of<00:03:14.400> the<00:03:14.459> strings

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
on dampen the same of the strings

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.670 
on dampen the same of the strings
slightly<00:03:15.389> not<00:03:15.720> too<00:03:15.930> much<00:03:16.079> you<00:03:16.230> want<00:03:16.409> chocolate

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
slightly not too much you want chocolate

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.149 
slightly not too much you want chocolate
-<00:03:16.769> they're<00:03:17.510> just<00:03:18.510> a<00:03:18.569> lot<00:03:18.689> with<00:03:18.840> them<00:03:18.959> you<00:03:19.159> okay

00:03:20.149 --> 00:03:20.159 
- they're just a lot with them you okay

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:26.040 
- they're just a lot with them you okay
and<00:03:20.720> play<00:03:21.720> the<00:03:21.840> like<00:03:21.959> without<00:03:22.169> you

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:26.050 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:28.260 

she's<00:03:26.920> got<00:03:27.040> a<00:03:27.070> soft<00:03:27.340> percussive<00:03:27.700> sound<00:03:28.090> to

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:28.270 
she's got a soft percussive sound to

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:30.510 
she's got a soft percussive sound to
make<00:03:28.840> a<00:03:28.900> stop<00:03:29.320> sign<00:03:29.470> and<00:03:29.920> then<00:03:30.250> all<00:03:30.340> I'm<00:03:30.460> going

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:30.520 
make a stop sign and then all I'm going

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:32.340 
make a stop sign and then all I'm going
to<00:03:30.640> do<00:03:30.760> is<00:03:30.880> gradually<00:03:31.480> release<00:03:31.750> the<00:03:31.930> mute

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:32.350 
to do is gradually release the mute

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:41.340 
to do is gradually release the mute
so<00:03:32.560> if<00:03:32.650> starts<00:03:32.890> off<00:03:33.040> with<00:03:33.160> a<00:03:33.250> palm<00:03:33.460> yet<00:03:40.350> and

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:41.350 
so if starts off with a palm yet and

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:43.020 
so if starts off with a palm yet and
then<00:03:41.500> gradual<00:03:41.950> it'll<00:03:42.100> release<00:03:42.640> sets<00:03:42.850> and

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
then gradual it'll release sets and

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:44.550 
then gradual it'll release sets and
start<00:03:43.240> to<00:03:43.330> dig<00:03:43.480> in<00:03:43.600> with<00:03:43.750> a<00:03:43.780> plectrum<00:03:44.050> and

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
start to dig in with a plectrum and

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.020 
start to dig in with a plectrum and
hopefully<00:03:45.040> we<00:03:45.130> can<00:03:45.250> get<00:03:45.340> some<00:03:45.400> artificial

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
hopefully we can get some artificial

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:49.080 
hopefully we can get some artificial
harmonic<00:03:46.630> overtones<00:03:47.220> maybe<00:03:48.220> not<00:03:48.400> quite<00:03:48.760> clear

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090 
harmonic overtones maybe not quite clear

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:50.870 
harmonic overtones maybe not quite clear
how<00:03:49.240> to<00:03:49.270> produce<00:03:49.510> artificial<00:03:49.930> harmonics<00:03:50.560> and

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880 
how to produce artificial harmonics and

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.190 
how to produce artificial harmonics and
what<00:03:51.880> to<00:03:52.000> do<00:03:52.150> is<00:03:52.390> hold<00:03:52.690> a<00:03:52.840> plank<00:03:52.990> from

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 
what to do is hold a plank from

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.560 
what to do is hold a plank from
extremely<00:03:54.040> close<00:03:54.550> to<00:03:55.000> the<00:03:55.090> edge<00:03:55.240> of<00:03:55.480> your

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:55.570 
extremely close to the edge of your

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:57.390 
extremely close to the edge of your
thumb<00:03:55.810> so<00:03:56.230> you<00:03:56.350> see<00:03:56.470> the<00:03:56.530> only<00:03:56.590> a<00:03:56.770> tiny<00:03:57.070> bit<00:03:57.220> of

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 
thumb so you see the only a tiny bit of

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:58.710 
thumb so you see the only a tiny bit of
flexion<00:03:57.610> sticking<00:03:58.030> out<00:03:58.120> there<00:03:58.300> what<00:03:58.510> we<00:03:58.570> can

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 
flexion sticking out there what we can

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.310 
flexion sticking out there what we can
see<00:03:58.840> that<00:03:58.870> and<00:04:00.120> what<00:04:01.120> happens<00:04:01.480> is<00:04:01.660> that<00:04:01.930> you

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:02.320 
see that and what happens is that you

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:03.780 
see that and what happens is that you
straight<00:04:02.560> the<00:04:02.650> string<00:04:02.800> with<00:04:02.920> a<00:04:02.980> plectrum<00:04:03.160> and

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790 
straight the string with a plectrum and

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:06.600 
straight the string with a plectrum and
then<00:04:04.060> directly<00:04:04.420> after<00:04:04.750> you<00:04:04.780> spray<00:04:05.020> it<00:04:05.610> you're

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:06.610 
then directly after you spray it you're

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:09.000 
then directly after you spray it you're
gonna<00:04:06.730> touch<00:04:07.150> your<00:04:07.680> string<00:04:08.680> with<00:04:08.830> your<00:04:08.860> thumb

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.010 
gonna touch your string with your thumb

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:14.370 
gonna touch your string with your thumb
so<00:04:09.970> that's<00:04:10.300> how<00:04:10.390> you<00:04:10.450> get<00:04:10.540> the<00:04:10.630> orbit<00:04:10.840> on<00:04:13.380> and

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:14.380 
so that's how you get the orbit on and

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:19.199 
so that's how you get the orbit on and
you<00:04:14.470> can<00:04:14.590> go<00:04:14.710> fishing<00:04:15.100> along<00:04:15.310> the<00:04:15.460> string<00:04:18.209> you

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209 
you can go fishing along the string you

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:20.940 
you can go fishing along the string you
get<00:04:19.330> different<00:04:19.690> harmonics<00:04:20.200> if<00:04:20.709> you're<00:04:20.860> not

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:20.950 
get different harmonics if you're not

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:21.990 
get different harmonics if you're not
used<00:04:21.130> to<00:04:21.220> this<00:04:21.310> it<00:04:21.459> does<00:04:21.580> take<00:04:21.760> a<00:04:21.790> little<00:04:21.910> bit

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 
used to this it does take a little bit

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.340 
used to this it does take a little bit
of<00:04:22.150> price<00:04:22.330> there's<00:04:22.600> all<00:04:22.660> the<00:04:22.750> head<00:04:22.930> investors

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:23.350 
of price there's all the head investors

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:25.200 
of price there's all the head investors
there's<00:04:23.800> some<00:04:23.980> things<00:04:24.190> some<00:04:24.880> things<00:04:24.910> you'll

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
there's some things some things you'll

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:26.520 
there's some things some things you'll
get<00:04:25.330> harmonic<00:04:25.810> did<00:04:25.960> some<00:04:26.110> things<00:04:26.290> I'll<00:04:26.410> do

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.530 
get harmonic did some things I'll do

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:30.270 
get harmonic did some things I'll do
something<00:04:26.800> cool<00:04:28.050> I<00:04:29.050> can<00:04:29.710> say<00:04:29.830> cool<00:04:30.010> as<00:04:30.130> well

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:30.280 
something cool I can say cool as well

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:31.950 
something cool I can say cool as well
actually<00:04:30.520> it's<00:04:30.910> a<00:04:30.970> soft<00:04:31.210> percussive<00:04:31.480> muted

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:31.960 
actually it's a soft percussive muted

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:33.780 
actually it's a soft percussive muted
sound<00:04:32.170> so<00:04:32.680> it's<00:04:33.010> a<00:04:33.100> little<00:04:33.250> bit<00:04:33.400> trial<00:04:33.640> and

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:33.790 
sound so it's a little bit trial and

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:35.790 
sound so it's a little bit trial and
error<00:04:33.940> but<00:04:34.180> getting<00:04:35.140> to<00:04:35.230> it<00:04:35.320> should<00:04:35.470> be<00:04:35.530> fine

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:35.800 
error but getting to it should be fine
