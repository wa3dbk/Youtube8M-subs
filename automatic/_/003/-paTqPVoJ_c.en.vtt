00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
is a an app that focuses on trains so if

work and enjoy the trains and the
scenery<00:00:38.010> and<00:00:38.280> such<00:00:38.610> anyway<00:00:39.420> let's<00:00:39.960> take<00:00:40.260> a

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
scenery and such anyway let's take a

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.779 
scenery and such anyway let's take a
look<00:00:40.469> at<00:00:40.559> it<00:00:41.780> so<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:42.870> idea<00:00:43.140> is<00:00:43.379> touch<00:00:44.370> to<00:00:44.579> start

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
look at it so the idea is touch to start

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.209 
look at it so the idea is touch to start
level<00:00:45.090> one<00:00:45.239> on<00:00:45.530> every<00:00:46.530> level<00:00:46.800> you<00:00:47.070> have<00:00:47.190> a

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
level one on every level you have a

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.760 
level one on every level you have a
different<00:00:47.579> train<00:00:47.879> and<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.809> train<00:00:49.050> starts<00:00:49.649> out

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
different train and the train starts out

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.160 
different train and the train starts out
with<00:00:49.890> just<00:00:49.950> the<00:00:50.190> engine<00:00:50.550> in<00:00:50.670> one<00:00:50.850> car<00:00:51.239> and<00:00:51.809> as

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
with just the engine in one car and as

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.750 
with just the engine in one car and as
you<00:00:52.289> can<00:00:52.410> see<00:00:52.469> it<00:00:52.770> starts<00:00:53.070> out<00:00:53.219> moving<00:00:53.489> very

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
you can see it starts out moving very

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.450 
you can see it starts out moving very
slowly<00:00:54.120> and<00:00:54.539> as<00:00:55.350> it<00:00:55.559> comes<00:00:55.770> to<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:55.980> next<00:00:56.250> car

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
slowly and as it comes to the next car

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.900 
slowly and as it comes to the next car
you<00:00:57.000> try<00:00:57.270> and<00:00:57.510> get<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.590> links<00:00:59.010> to<00:00:59.250> connect

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
you try and get the links to connect

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.880 
you try and get the links to connect
just<00:01:00.090> right<00:01:00.390> to<00:01:00.629> couple<00:01:00.989> up<00:01:01.109> or<00:01:01.379> whatever<00:01:01.739> the

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
just right to couple up or whatever the

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.060 
just right to couple up or whatever the
proper<00:01:02.250> terminology<00:01:02.520> is<00:01:03.059> to<00:01:03.960> add<00:01:04.559> that<00:01:04.860> next

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
proper terminology is to add that next

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.830 
proper terminology is to add that next
car<00:01:05.430> to<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:06.299> Train

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
car to the Train

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.070 
car to the Train
and<00:01:07.729> as<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.970> train<00:01:09.210> rolls<00:01:09.479> down<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.689> tracks

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
and as the train rolls down the tracks

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.010 
and as the train rolls down the tracks
and<00:01:10.530> as<00:01:10.680> you<00:01:10.860> add<00:01:11.010> cars<00:01:11.570> it<00:01:12.570> will<00:01:12.720> move<00:01:12.840> a

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
and as you add cars it will move a

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.660 
and as you add cars it will move a
little<00:01:13.140> bit<00:01:13.350> quicker<00:01:13.560> and<00:01:13.860> hopefully<00:01:14.460> you<00:01:14.549> can

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
little bit quicker and hopefully you can

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.920 
little bit quicker and hopefully you can
see<00:01:14.880> that<00:01:15.090> each<00:01:15.240> time<00:01:15.509> you<00:01:16.369> connect<00:01:17.780> it<00:01:18.780> will

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
see that each time you connect it will

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.899 
see that each time you connect it will
tell<00:01:19.170> you<00:01:19.350> whether<00:01:19.590> you<00:01:19.890> just<00:01:20.159> barely<00:01:20.430> connect

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
tell you whether you just barely connect

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.580 
tell you whether you just barely connect
it<00:01:21.060> or<00:01:21.270> got<00:01:21.390> a<00:01:21.450> fare<00:01:21.750> connection<00:01:22.320> a<00:01:22.409> good

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
it or got a fare connection a good

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.789 
it or got a fare connection a good
connection<00:01:22.860> or<00:01:23.189> a<00:01:23.220> perfect<00:01:23.700> one<00:01:24.710> there's<00:01:25.710> a

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
connection or a perfect one there's a

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.600 
connection or a perfect one there's a
perfect<00:01:26.159> one<00:01:26.310> on<00:01:26.430> that<00:01:26.520> one<00:01:26.580> and<00:01:28.490> it's<00:01:29.490> gonna

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
perfect one on that one and it's gonna

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.219 
perfect one on that one and it's gonna
keep<00:01:29.850> rolling<00:01:30.000> pretty<00:01:30.329> slowly<00:01:30.659> this<00:01:30.869> level

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
keep rolling pretty slowly this level

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:37.700 
keep rolling pretty slowly this level
one<00:01:31.409> is<00:01:31.619> really<00:01:32.490> quite<00:01:32.939> easy<00:01:35.900> but<00:01:36.900> as<00:01:37.380> you<00:01:37.619> go

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
one is really quite easy but as you go

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.310 
one is really quite easy but as you go
through<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.040> levels<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:39.360> Train

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
through the levels the Train

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.600 
through the levels the Train
you<00:01:40.409> know<00:01:40.500> each<00:01:40.860> level<00:01:41.100> has<00:01:41.250> a<00:01:41.280> different

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
you know each level has a different

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.710 
you know each level has a different
train<00:01:43.070> each<00:01:44.070> level<00:01:44.430> has<00:01:44.880> different

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
train each level has different

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.020 
train each level has different
background<00:01:46.140> scenery<00:01:46.530> and<00:01:47.009> they<00:01:47.700> do<00:01:47.759> get

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
background scenery and they do get

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.590 
background scenery and they do get
harder<00:01:48.509> as<00:01:48.750> you<00:01:49.670> progress<00:01:50.670> along<00:01:50.850> and<00:01:51.450> so

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
harder as you progress along and so

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.100 
harder as you progress along and so
there<00:01:51.750> we<00:01:51.899> completed<00:01:52.380> level<00:01:52.530> one<00:01:53.810> and<00:01:54.810> that's

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
there we completed level one and that's

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.770 
there we completed level one and that's
really<00:01:55.380> not<00:01:55.470> too<00:01:55.680> difficult<00:01:56.450> and<00:01:57.450> they<00:01:57.600> don't

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
really not too difficult and they don't

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.109 
really not too difficult and they don't
get<00:01:57.990> super<00:01:58.799> difficult<00:01:59.130> to<00:01:59.520> be<00:01:59.640> honest<00:01:59.939> but

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
get super difficult to be honest but

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.209 
get super difficult to be honest but
they<00:02:00.270> get<00:02:00.500> difficult<00:02:01.500> enough<00:02:01.710> to<00:02:01.770> keep<00:02:02.100> it

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
they get difficult enough to keep it

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:06.280 
they get difficult enough to keep it
interesting<00:02:02.460> and<00:02:03.049> again<00:02:04.049> the<00:02:04.229> trains<00:02:04.670> look

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290 
interesting and again the trains look

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.109 
interesting and again the trains look
pretty<00:02:07.290> gorgeous<00:02:07.530> if<00:02:08.190> you<00:02:08.429> like<00:02:08.610> trains<00:02:08.940> at

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
pretty gorgeous if you like trains at

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.999 
pretty gorgeous if you like trains at
all<00:02:09.270> and<00:02:09.509> the<00:02:10.050> backgrounds<00:02:10.560> are<00:02:10.679> pretty<00:02:10.860> nice

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009
