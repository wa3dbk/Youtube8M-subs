 tablets trying to secure their 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.110

 self-absorbed all the best from the first 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:43.020
 nexus 7 about him today we and 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:45.120

 or reading at the table for example perhaps 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.070
 the only thing my guys took over 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.320
 nexus is a soft-coated back cover 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.350
 touch instead of plastic here 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.360
 backdrops 5 colors white blue green 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.210

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.340
 Matte gray body has a typical 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.890
 for asus outlines of devices with 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.530
 smooth angles and wide enough 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.390
 Frames around the screen the entire surface from 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.880
 edge to edge takes a protective glass 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.549
 under which there is a matrix display 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.590
 slightly higher and and the front camera on 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.080
 right side of the tablet button located 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.600

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.009
 headset and microphone connection 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.810

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.299
 speaker system given glossy 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.640
 surface is worth thinking about 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:54.409
 purchasing a cover which saves 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.409
 tablet from scratches and scuffs 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:03.399

 900 pixels 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.470
 I must admit that asus tablets are now 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.080
 one of the best is established 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.430
 displays on the market anyway among 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.200
 seven inch devices 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.420
 here is an excellent factory calibration 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.610
 excellent viewing angles and accurate 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.290

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.870
 touches thanks to two in stereo 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:28.829
 speakers and technology asus sonicmaster 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.829
 the tablet sounds good 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:40.640
 and among the pre-installed applications 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:42.079
 there is an audio wizard offering 6 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.060
 modes for different scenarios 

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:47.659

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:51.640
 and when the power saving mode is on 

00:02:53.079 --> 00:03:00.220
 memo pad hd 7 

00:02:55.129 --> 00:03:00.220
 equipped with mediatek mt8389 processor 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:06.620
 each of which operates on frequency 1 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:09.019
 and 2 gigahertz on board there is one 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:11.359
 gigabytes of ram and 16 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:13.909

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:16.099
 this volume can be another 32 gigabytes with 

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:17.810
 using micro sd memory cards for 

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:22.000
 graphics processing uses one 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:23.510
 nuclear version of power vr accelerator 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.549
 sgx544mp 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.440
 this is quite a productive chip 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:29.150
 which in various variations is applied as 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.280
 budget devices and in 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:34.670
 flagship models like ipad and 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:37.190
 iphone 5 and galaxy s4 it's great 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:38.870
 it shows itself in tests and games all 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:42.169
 works without problems on high 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:45.169
 graphics settings in the memo pad hd 7 costs 

00:03:42.169 --> 00:03:47.299
 almost 4,000 milliampere battery 

00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:50.389
 hours on one charge the tablet keeps 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:52.609
 up to 10 hours of web surfing reading 

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:54.500
 and other daily tasks if 

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:56.090
 watch videos online while running 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:04:00.739
 decrease to 6 hours 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:03.019

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:05.750
 take about 3-4 hours 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:07.310
 tablet work memo pad hd 7 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:10.730
 works on the basis of the operating system 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:13.030
 android 4 2 1 jellybin interface 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:15.500
 somewhat improved by asus programmers 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:17.180
 the curtain underwent a slight change 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:19.459
 notification menu settings 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:21.979
 and also added 4 control button 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:23.990

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:28.419
 quick call application and budgets 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:28.419
 a list of them can be customized as you like 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:38.310
 unlike the first nexus 7 tablet 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:40.580
 It has not one but two cameras that 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:43.110
 is undoubted advantage 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:45.240
 front camera with a resolution of 1 and 2 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:47.640
 megapixels suitable for video calls 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.860
 main 5 megapixel located 

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:51.780
 on the back of the tablet will fit for shooting 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:54.060
 anything replacing compact 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:54.870
 There is no flash camera, but there is 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:57.210
 autofocus 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:59.210
 furthermore available panoramic photography and 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:01.830
 also many additional effects 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:05.840
 in video mode, the camera allows 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:05.840
 shoot videos with full hd resolution 

00:05:12.569 --> 00:05:18.669
 as I said, started asus memo pad hd 7 

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:19.569
 absorbed all the best of the first 

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:21.569
 nexus 7 

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:23.830
 but also received a number of innovations 

00:05:21.569 --> 00:05:25.840
 excellent screen great 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:27.159
 performance card reader 

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:29.620
 two cameras 

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:33.099
 updated android and bright colors 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:34.810

00:05:33.099 --> 00:05:37.180
 will receive as quickly as possible 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:40.150
 thanks to asus and google collaboration 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:42.220
 and this is a serious voice so there are problems 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:45.699
 choosing a 7-inch tablet is simple and 

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:47.560
