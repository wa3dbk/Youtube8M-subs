00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:11.130
 our recipe for today is milk day 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:14.519
 condensed in the microwave and for this 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.170
 recipe you will need a can of 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:23.910
 condensed milk 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:27.240
 the same measure of milk 3 eggs and one 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.640
 spoon of vanilla essence and 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:33.740
 for the tail we'll use a cup 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.740
 of sugar and half a cup of water 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:41.160
 the first step is going to be to pick up 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:44.040
 a milkmaid take the fire and put all 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:49.079
 Sugar, we're going to stir a little. 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:54.059
 this sugar until it melts and looks good 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:58.410
 Well, that's good, it started to melt. 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:01:00.750
 there he moves to help and now it will be 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.530
 He is already very well caramel, right? 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.909
 I woke up and then we add water 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.729
 Then it will get a little thick. 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:11.369
 stoned but it is normal that this will 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:14.820
 in which these lumps there that formed 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:17.220
 they will dissolve and you will fiddle until 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.320
 that there are no more no clods 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.570
 of sugar 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:24.020
 At this point we can turn off 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.020
 calm 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.400
 now in the way that she herself 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:35.420
 microwave 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:37.820
 I'm putting the tail here and I'm going 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:45.500
 do this so she goes through 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:49.130
 way to be well wet wet there 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:51.320
 Now we'll book a good one. 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:55.310
 first step to get the pudding goes 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:58.490
 being miss the gems by the twins avoid 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.800
 that taste and smell of eggs is more 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:04.009
 pity was carefully when you 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:06.320
 stir with spoon not go now 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:10.520
 I'm putting the whites that do not 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:14.120
 need to have the vanilla and I'll give 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:16.160
 A little mumble here this recipe will not 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.220
 in the blender just stir the same 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:22.510
 I'll put all condensed milk here. 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:25.420
 and the same measure of milk 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:28.420
 Then I'll mix and mix to be well. 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.420
 homogeneous 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:37.170
 now that with the fame that I had 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.990
 left reserved 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:48.510
 I'll dump all the content with 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:51.960
 careful and that's what we're going to take 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.370
 now direct microwave for more or 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.870
 at least 12 minutes 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.660
 there will depend a bit on the micro waves 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:01.230
 of each other but you can even do the 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:08.760
 test to see if the toothpick comes out dry 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:12.930
 It's been good here for the past 12 minutes. 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:14.790
 mine is already good oil is bugle and 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.710
 he starts to give a 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:19.650
 then you can see that 

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:21.780
 Okay, I'll take it now in the fridge. 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.470
 for him to debut because his inform 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:27.240
 hot it will break 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.290
 now that she has spent about three hours in the 

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:33.140
 refrigerator 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:33.140
 It's cold, I'm going to misinform.
