platform was designed from the ground up
to<00:00:36.719> give<00:00:37.020> us<00:00:37.379> eight<00:00:37.710> products<00:00:38.519> initially<00:00:39.120> now

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
to give us eight products initially now

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.750 
to give us eight products initially now
each<00:00:40.019> of<00:00:40.050> these<00:00:40.320> eight<00:00:40.530> products<00:00:41.010> have<00:00:41.460> one

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
each of these eight products have one

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.250 
each of these eight products have one
thing<00:00:41.969> in<00:00:42.030> common<00:00:42.120> and<00:00:42.629> that<00:00:42.660> is<00:00:42.780> that<00:00:42.930> they

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
thing in common and that is that they

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.310 
thing in common and that is that they
are<00:00:43.379> smaller<00:00:44.390> they're<00:00:45.390> better<00:00:45.719> and<00:00:45.989> they're

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
are smaller they're better and they're

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.139 
are smaller they're better and they're
smarter<00:00:46.800> so<00:00:47.070> what<00:00:47.219> do<00:00:47.280> we<00:00:47.370> mean<00:00:47.550> by<00:00:47.609> that<00:00:47.969> well

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
smarter so what do we mean by that well

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.479 
smarter so what do we mean by that well
first<00:00:48.329> of<00:00:48.480> all<00:00:48.539> by<00:00:48.660> smaller<00:00:49.219> what<00:00:50.219> we<00:00:50.340> heard

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
first of all by smaller what we heard

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.130 
first of all by smaller what we heard
from<00:00:50.550> our<00:00:50.820> customers<00:00:51.269> is<00:00:51.300> that<00:00:51.480> they<00:00:51.660> needed

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
from our customers is that they needed

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.349 
from our customers is that they needed
to<00:00:52.260> have<00:00:52.379> a<00:00:52.589> machine<00:00:53.039> that<00:00:53.219> would<00:00:53.339> fit<00:00:53.670> into<00:00:53.940> a

for the operator to to maintain so it's

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.969 
for the operator to to maintain so it's
a<00:01:12.210> smaller<00:01:12.689> system<00:01:12.990> and<00:01:13.409> there<00:01:13.619> are<00:01:13.710> many
