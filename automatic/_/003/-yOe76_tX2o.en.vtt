00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
again I'm gonna continue and just do

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.270 
again I'm gonna continue and just do
that<00:02:36.060> throwing<00:02:37.060> around<00:02:37.920> and<00:02:38.920> so<00:02:39.069> now<00:02:39.220> I'm

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
that throwing around and so now I'm

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.520 
that throwing around and so now I'm
gonna<00:02:39.400> take<00:02:39.610> my<00:02:39.670> clamp<00:02:40.030> off<00:02:40.239> and<00:02:40.630> now<00:02:41.200> you<00:02:41.260> can

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
gonna take my clamp off and now you can

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:47.490 
gonna take my clamp off and now you can
see<00:02:41.680> the<00:02:41.769> difference<00:02:45.900> that's<00:02:46.900> with<00:02:47.170> the<00:02:47.290> wire

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
see the difference that's with the wire

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.120 
see the difference that's with the wire
and<00:02:48.329> using<00:02:49.329> this<00:02:49.540> file<00:02:49.810> and<00:02:50.170> if<00:02:50.620> I<00:02:50.739> use<00:02:50.950> this

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
and using this file and if I use this

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.150 
and using this file and if I use this
file<00:02:51.400> you'll<00:02:51.790> see<00:02:51.880> that<00:02:52.269> it's<00:02:52.450> the<00:02:52.630> same<00:02:53.160> so

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
file you'll see that it's the same so

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.410 
file you'll see that it's the same so
you<00:02:54.220> can<00:02:54.489> just<00:02:54.849> go<00:02:55.390> room<00:02:56.970> so<00:02:57.970> doesn't<00:02:58.150> matter

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
you can just go room so doesn't matter

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.710 
you can just go room so doesn't matter
what<00:02:58.750> sort<00:02:58.930> of<00:02:59.019> file<00:02:59.380> or<00:03:00.120> shape<00:03:01.120> of<00:03:01.329> while<00:03:01.540> you

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
what sort of file or shape of while you

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.069 
what sort of file or shape of while you
use<00:03:02.019> it<00:03:02.860> will<00:03:03.069> work<00:03:03.280> the<00:03:03.519> same<00:03:03.569> and<00:03:04.569> now<00:03:04.930> we're

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:05.079 
use it will work the same and now we're

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:07.470 
use it will work the same and now we're
gonna<00:03:05.170> move<00:03:05.379> on<00:03:05.560> to<00:03:05.680> the<00:03:05.799> beads<00:03:06.010> so<00:03:06.790> this<00:03:07.120> bead

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
gonna move on to the beads so this bead

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.770 
gonna move on to the beads so this bead
here<00:03:07.870> look<00:03:08.769> exactly<00:03:09.190> the<00:03:09.459> same<00:03:09.579> or<00:03:10.030> is<00:03:10.329> exactly

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
here look exactly the same or is exactly

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.080 
here look exactly the same or is exactly
the<00:03:10.959> same<00:03:11.170> as<00:03:11.410> this<00:03:11.560> bead<00:03:11.859> here<00:03:12.100> but<00:03:12.790> so<00:03:12.940> now

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
the same as this bead here but so now

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.509 
the same as this bead here but so now
I'm<00:03:13.209> gonna<00:03:13.359> show<00:03:13.630> you<00:03:13.690> how<00:03:14.470> to<00:03:14.530> turn<00:03:14.950> it<00:03:14.980> from

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:15.519 
I'm gonna show you how to turn it from

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:19.710 
I'm gonna show you how to turn it from
the<00:03:16.000> shiny<00:03:16.690> bead<00:03:16.980> to<00:03:17.980> the<00:03:18.430> Stardust<00:03:19.359> effect

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
the shiny bead to the Stardust effect

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.840 
the shiny bead to the Stardust effect
I'll<00:03:20.260> take<00:03:20.530> my<00:03:20.709> file<00:03:20.889> this<00:03:21.250> is<00:03:21.370> a<00:03:21.400> black<00:03:21.670> one

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850 
I'll take my file this is a black one

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:24.539 
I'll take my file this is a black one
and<00:03:22.180> what<00:03:22.989> I<00:03:23.019> do<00:03:23.230> is<00:03:23.410> just<00:03:23.680> do<00:03:23.859> this<00:03:24.040> like<00:03:24.310> that

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:24.549 
and what I do is just do this like that

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:27.629 
and what I do is just do this like that
so<00:03:24.970> if<00:03:25.150> you<00:03:25.299> just<00:03:25.510> roll<00:03:25.780> it<00:03:26.310> don't<00:03:27.310> press<00:03:27.609> too

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:27.639 
so if you just roll it don't press too

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:29.729 
so if you just roll it don't press too
hard<00:03:27.910> because<00:03:28.239> you<00:03:28.480> might<00:03:28.630> flatten<00:03:28.900> the<00:03:29.530> bead

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:29.739 
hard because you might flatten the bead

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:37.110 
hard because you might flatten the bead
or<00:03:30.700> your<00:03:31.000> metal<00:03:31.269> bead<00:03:32.040> so<00:03:33.040> as<00:03:34.440> you<00:03:35.440> roll<00:03:35.709> it<00:03:36.120> it

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
or your metal bead so as you roll it it

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.860 
or your metal bead so as you roll it it
creates<00:03:37.720> little<00:03:38.349> sparkles<00:03:39.160> that's<00:03:39.730> with<00:03:40.239> the

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
creates little sparkles that's with the

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.410 
creates little sparkles that's with the
diamond<00:03:41.349> file<00:03:41.620> now<00:03:42.220> with<00:03:42.459> this<00:03:42.670> one<00:03:42.970> this

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420 
diamond file now with this one this

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:46.979 
diamond file now with this one this
actually<00:03:43.720> works<00:03:44.290> much<00:03:44.590> better<00:03:45.299> because<00:03:46.299> of

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989 
actually works much better because of

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:50.699 
actually works much better because of
the<00:03:47.769> ridges<00:03:48.280> or<00:03:48.489> the<00:03:48.609> lines<00:03:48.910> that<00:03:49.660> it<00:03:49.720> has<00:03:50.019> so

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
the ridges or the lines that it has so

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:53.260 
the ridges or the lines that it has so
you<00:03:50.739> can<00:03:51.010> see<00:03:51.160> those<00:03:51.310> lines

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:53.270 
you can see those lines

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:56.660 
you can see those lines
it<00:03:54.270> gives<00:03:54.630> the<00:03:54.900> Mapple<00:03:55.410> beads<00:03:55.770> a<00:03:56.040> pattern<00:03:56.460> and

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
it gives the Mapple beads a pattern and

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:06.309 
it gives the Mapple beads a pattern and
therefore<00:03:57.450> creating<00:03:58.200> a<00:03:58.410> status<00:03:58.860> effect

00:04:06.309 --> 00:04:06.319 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:08.479 

so<00:04:07.319> now<00:04:07.470> you<00:04:07.560> can<00:04:07.709> see<00:04:07.799> the<00:04:07.920> pattern<00:04:08.250> or<00:04:08.400> the

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489 
so now you can see the pattern or the

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:12.610 
so now you can see the pattern or the
indentation<00:04:08.760> that<00:04:09.299> is<00:04:09.420> created<00:04:09.930> on<00:04:10.079> the<00:04:10.200> beads

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 
indentation that is created on the beads

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.800 
indentation that is created on the beads
so<00:04:13.620> see<00:04:13.860> you<00:04:14.040> can<00:04:14.099> see<00:04:14.370> the<00:04:14.459> difference<00:04:14.819> now<00:04:15.000> so

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
so see you can see the difference now so

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:19.300 
so see you can see the difference now so
I'm<00:04:15.870> just<00:04:16.019> gonna<00:04:16.139> go<00:04:16.440> continue<00:04:17.039> doing<00:04:17.430> this

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.310 
I'm just gonna go continue doing this

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:22.510 
I'm just gonna go continue doing this
again<00:04:20.310> don't<00:04:20.759> press<00:04:21.060> too<00:04:21.090> hard<00:04:21.329> just<00:04:21.989> guide<00:04:22.410> it

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:22.520 
again don't press too hard just guide it

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:31.689 
again don't press too hard just guide it
so<00:04:23.520> even<00:04:23.639> you<00:04:23.789> can<00:04:23.940> do<00:04:24.090> it<00:04:24.210> with<00:04:24.360> one<00:04:24.570> hand<00:04:24.900> so

00:04:31.689 --> 00:04:31.699 

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:36.860 

it's<00:04:32.699> best<00:04:32.970> to<00:04:33.090> have<00:04:33.180> a<00:04:33.840> leather<00:04:34.440> mat<00:04:35.220> to<00:04:36.150> roll

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
it's best to have a leather mat to roll

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:43.850 
it's best to have a leather mat to roll
it<00:04:37.139> on<00:04:37.490> that<00:04:38.490> way<00:04:38.699> doesn't<00:04:39.000> sleep<00:04:42.680> I'll<00:04:43.680> just

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
it on that way doesn't sleep I'll just

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:46.480 
it on that way doesn't sleep I'll just
check

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:46.490 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:55.920 

it's<00:04:47.490> nearly<00:04:47.940> there

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:55.930 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:00.160 

so<00:04:56.930> now<00:04:57.140> I<00:04:57.170> finish<00:04:57.710> it<00:04:57.890> and<00:04:58.210> the<00:04:59.210> two<00:04:59.510> are

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:00.170 
so now I finish it and the two are

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:02.440 
so now I finish it and the two are
almost<00:05:00.410> identical<00:05:01.160> the<00:05:01.370> pedes<00:05:01.910> you<00:05:02.150> can<00:05:02.270> buy

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:02.450 
almost identical the pedes you can buy

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:06.040 
almost identical the pedes you can buy
the<00:05:02.510> Stardust<00:05:03.230> beads<00:05:03.500> it's<00:05:03.980> ready<00:05:04.570> done<00:05:05.570> with

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.050 
the Stardust beads it's ready done with

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:09.160 
the Stardust beads it's ready done with
the<00:05:06.260> Stardust<00:05:07.250> on<00:05:07.400> them<00:05:07.640> but<00:05:08.390> it<00:05:08.660> costs<00:05:08.990> twice

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:09.170 
the Stardust on them but it costs twice

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:11.500 
the Stardust on them but it costs twice
as<00:05:09.230> much<00:05:09.440> so<00:05:10.130> for<00:05:10.310> those<00:05:10.430> of<00:05:10.490> you<00:05:10.700> who's<00:05:11.090> making

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:11.510 
as much so for those of you who's making

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:14.680 
as much so for those of you who's making
jewelry<00:05:11.930> on<00:05:12.110> the<00:05:12.260> budget<00:05:12.710> then<00:05:13.460> it's<00:05:14.090> worth<00:05:14.420> my

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:14.690 
jewelry on the budget then it's worth my

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:17.650 
jewelry on the budget then it's worth my
while<00:05:14.960> to<00:05:15.380> do<00:05:15.620> the<00:05:16.520> star<00:05:16.820> dusting<00:05:17.300> effect

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:17.660 
while to do the star dusting effect

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:21.040 
while to do the star dusting effect
myself<00:05:18.200> then<00:05:18.980> to<00:05:19.790> pay<00:05:20.030> for<00:05:20.360> the<00:05:20.450> Stardust

myself then to pay for the Stardust

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:24.310 
myself then to pay for the Stardust
beads<00:05:21.710> but<00:05:22.190> if<00:05:22.610> course<00:05:23.510> is<00:05:23.750> not<00:05:23.930> an<00:05:24.080> issue
