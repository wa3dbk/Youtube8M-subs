top<00:00:45.930> is<00:00:46.289> doing<00:00:46.980> ok<00:00:47.309> and<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.879> back<00:00:48.180> is<00:00:48.450> doing

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
top is doing ok and the back is doing

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.799 
top is doing ok and the back is doing
good<00:00:49.079> but<00:00:49.620> there's<00:00:50.280> no<00:00:50.670> shape<00:00:51.090> like<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.570> back

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
good but there's no shape like the back

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.110 
good but there's no shape like the back
of<00:00:51.840> my<00:00:52.050> hair<00:00:52.350> is<00:00:52.500> longer<00:00:52.800> in<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.699> front<00:00:53.730> of<00:00:54.030> my

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
of my hair is longer in the front of my

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.060 
of my hair is longer in the front of my
hair<00:00:54.329> so<00:00:54.629> it<00:00:54.750> looks<00:00:54.930> more<00:00:55.020> like<00:00:55.320> a<00:00:55.350> mullet<00:00:55.739> and

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
hair so it looks more like a mullet and

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.689 
hair so it looks more like a mullet and
I<00:00:56.219> would<00:00:56.370> prefer<00:00:56.579> it<00:00:56.940> if<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.329> top<00:00:57.629> were<00:00:57.840> longer

00:00:58.689 --> 00:00:58.699 
I would prefer it if the top were longer

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:01.760 
I would prefer it if the top were longer
so<00:00:59.699> what<00:01:00.449> I'm<00:01:00.570> going<00:01:00.690> to<00:01:00.750> do<00:01:00.989> is<00:01:01.260> I'm<00:01:01.590> going<00:01:01.620> to

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.189 
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
put<00:01:02.010> these<00:01:02.190> two<00:01:02.550> sections<00:01:02.940> and<00:01:03.510> all<00:01:03.750> idea<00:01:04.049> was

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
put these two sections and all idea was

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.840 
put these two sections and all idea was
put<00:01:04.350> my<00:01:04.439> hair<00:01:04.650> in<00:01:04.739> four<00:01:04.949> sections<00:01:05.280> and<00:01:05.670> then

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
put my hair in four sections and then

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.300 
put my hair in four sections and then
split<00:01:06.119> each<00:01:06.390> section<00:01:06.840> into<00:01:06.990> two<00:01:07.350> so<00:01:08.159> I<00:01:08.189> have

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
split each section into two so I have

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.010 
split each section into two so I have
eight<00:01:08.520> sections<00:01:09.060> and<00:01:09.330> I'm<00:01:09.510> going<00:01:09.689> to<00:01:09.750> clip

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
eight sections and I'm going to clip

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.920 
eight sections and I'm going to clip
these<00:01:10.350> two<00:01:10.820> out<00:01:11.820> of<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:12.150> way<00:01:12.330> because<00:01:12.720> these

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
these two out of the way because these

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.260 
these two out of the way because these
are<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.229> two<00:01:13.470> that<00:01:13.650> I<00:01:13.710> might<00:01:14.040> keep<00:01:14.250> long<00:01:14.640> so

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
are the two that I might keep long so

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.550 
are the two that I might keep long so
I'm<00:01:15.390> just<00:01:15.570> going<00:01:15.750> to<00:01:15.840> trim<00:01:16.049> those<00:01:16.259> a<00:01:16.320> little

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
I'm just going to trim those a little

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.070 
I'm just going to trim those a little
bit<00:01:16.850> so<00:01:17.850> that<00:01:17.880> my<00:01:18.150> hair<00:01:18.360> can<00:01:18.509> kind<00:01:18.659> of<00:01:18.720> grow<00:01:18.900> out

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
bit so that my hair can kind of grow out

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.670 
bit so that my hair can kind of grow out
in<00:01:19.350> a<00:01:19.500> regular<00:01:20.100> shape<00:01:20.479> so<00:01:21.479> this<00:01:21.840> section<00:01:22.439> is

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
in a regular shape so this section is

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.830 
in a regular shape so this section is
the<00:01:23.070> one<00:01:23.250> that<00:01:23.430> I'm<00:01:23.520> going<00:01:23.729> to<00:01:23.790> start<00:01:24.090> with<00:01:24.450> and

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.399 
we're going to use the measuring tape so
I'm<00:01:43.920> just<00:01:44.130> going<00:01:44.310> to<00:01:44.369> measure<00:01:44.640> out<00:01:45.140> like<00:01:46.140> from

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
I'm just going to measure out like from

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:52.100 
I'm just going to measure out like from
rubber<00:01:46.649> band<00:01:46.950> to<00:01:47.340> rubber<00:01:47.579> band<00:01:48.200> how<00:01:49.200> long<00:01:51.110> it's

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
rubber band to rubber band how long it's

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.230 
rubber band to rubber band how long it's
going<00:01:52.409> to<00:01:52.470> be<00:01:54.530> about<00:01:55.530> four<00:01:56.280> and<00:01:56.310> a<00:01:56.670> half<00:01:56.700> inches

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
going to be about four and a half inches

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.030 
going to be about four and a half inches
because<00:01:57.899> we're<00:01:58.140> going<00:01:58.259> to<00:01:58.320> cut<00:01:58.560> right<00:01:58.680> above

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
because we're going to cut right above

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.100 
because we're going to cut right above
the<00:01:59.369> rubber<00:01:59.549> band<00:01:59.850> so<00:02:00.659> I<00:02:00.689> don't<00:02:00.869> know<00:02:00.930> if<00:02:00.960> you

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.960 
each section in a rubber band at the
base<00:02:25.049> and<00:02:25.319> a<00:02:25.530> rubber<00:02:25.739> being<00:02:26.010> right<00:02:26.670> where

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
right above the rubber band not below it

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:34.009 
right above the rubber band not below it
and<00:02:30.830> I<00:02:31.830> want<00:02:32.099> this<00:02:32.280> crown<00:02:32.549> section<00:02:33.000> to<00:02:33.510> be<00:02:33.690> the

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:34.019 
and I want this crown section to be the

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:38.059 
and I want this crown section to be the
longest<00:02:34.530> hair<00:02:35.519> so<00:02:36.360> I<00:02:36.390> measured<00:02:37.049> these<00:02:37.290> out<00:02:37.590> to

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
longest hair so I measured these out to

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:42.440 
longest hair so I measured these out to
be<00:02:38.610> I<00:02:38.940> believe<00:02:39.349> six<00:02:40.349> inches<00:02:41.150> it's<00:02:42.150> going<00:02:42.299> to<00:02:42.360> be

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
be I believe six inches it's going to be

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.190 
be I believe six inches it's going to be
just<00:02:42.480> a<00:02:42.780> little<00:02:43.049> past<00:02:43.290> six<00:02:43.769> inches<00:02:44.220> i<00:02:44.370> think

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
just a little past six inches i think

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.110 
just a little past six inches i think
yeah<00:02:46.200> the<00:02:46.709> rubber<00:02:46.980> bands<00:02:47.190> a<00:02:47.430> little<00:02:47.670> past<00:02:47.879> six

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
yeah the rubber bands a little past six

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.759 
yeah the rubber bands a little past six
it<00:02:48.299> just<00:02:48.540> so<00:02:48.629> it'll<00:02:48.810> be<00:02:48.840> a<00:02:48.959> little<00:02:49.079> longer<00:02:49.530> than

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
it just so it'll be a little longer than

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:54.619 
it just so it'll be a little longer than
six<00:02:50.040> inches<00:02:50.280> for<00:02:50.730> the<00:02:51.140> four<00:02:52.140> in<00:02:52.560> the<00:02:53.280> crown<00:02:54.060> so

00:02:54.619 --> 00:02:54.629 
six inches for the four in the crown so

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:57.619 
six inches for the four in the crown so
I'll<00:02:54.750> probably<00:02:54.989> clip<00:02:55.410> these<00:02:55.620> away<00:02:55.980> and<00:02:56.629> then

00:02:57.619 --> 00:02:57.629 
I'll probably clip these away and then

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:00.289 
I'll probably clip these away and then
the<00:02:57.989> perimeter<00:02:58.680> ones<00:02:58.950> on<00:02:59.220> the<00:02:59.340> sides<00:02:59.609> I<00:03:00.000> want

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:00.299 
the perimeter ones on the sides I want

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:02.300 
the perimeter ones on the sides I want
to<00:03:00.390> be<00:03:00.720> the<00:03:00.930> shorter<00:03:01.349> one<00:03:01.530> so<00:03:01.799> they<00:03:01.950> can<00:03:02.160> kind

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
to be the shorter one so they can kind

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.130 
to be the shorter one so they can kind
of<00:03:02.400> grow<00:03:02.640> out<00:03:02.819> in<00:03:02.849> the<00:03:03.060> shape<00:03:03.299> that<00:03:03.329> I<00:03:03.540> want<00:03:03.629> and

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
of grow out in the shape that I want and

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.430 
of grow out in the shape that I want and
these<00:03:07.140> are<00:03:07.200> going<00:03:07.739> to<00:03:07.799> be<00:03:07.950> 5<00:03:08.940> inches<00:03:09.269> I<00:03:09.870> put<00:03:10.349> the

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
these are going to be 5 inches I put the

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.619 
these are going to be 5 inches I put the
rim<00:03:10.769> right<00:03:10.980> at<00:03:11.160> five<00:03:11.340> inches<00:03:11.670> so<00:03:12.329> it's<00:03:12.480> not<00:03:12.569> a

00:03:12.619 --> 00:03:12.629 
rim right at five inches so it's not a

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:14.449 
rim right at five inches so it's not a
major<00:03:12.870> cut<00:03:13.230> but<00:03:13.470> it's<00:03:13.650> definitely<00:03:13.859> needed

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
major cut but it's definitely needed

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:16.970 
major cut but it's definitely needed
because<00:03:14.640> my<00:03:15.030> hair<00:03:15.420> has<00:03:15.989> not<00:03:16.170> been<00:03:16.379> doing<00:03:16.739> so

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
because my hair has not been doing so

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.150 
because my hair has not been doing so
good<00:03:17.010> and<00:03:17.579> i<00:03:18.450> got<00:03:18.690> my<00:03:18.930> paul<00:03:19.290> mitchell<00:03:19.560> scissors
