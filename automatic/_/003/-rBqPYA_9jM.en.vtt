 hi to all these nabobs 0 1 for this 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:14.860
 video I decided to make a 

00:00:11.919 --> 00:00:18.010
 presentation of the revolution menu made by 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:19.810
 enstone I do it especially 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:21.490
 for people who join me in 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:22.930
 line and who asks me how he 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:25.840
 walk how to open it how 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:27.730
 select and so on I'm not the 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.910
 only to have this menu online there are 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:33.219
 especially asloum 0 1 who is a good friend 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.260
 to me I will also put you all these 

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:36.190
 links in the description a skype sound 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.470
 his youtube channel 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:41.440
 go see he's really making 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:41.920
 videos not bad he really does not present 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.810
 bad too 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:49.870
 So here we go to open it 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:53.260
 quite simple, you have to press l 1 and r 3 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.940
 at the same time like that she an air 3 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.960
 for those who do not know what is r3 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.760
 since there are some who ask me 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.820
 seriously by message 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:04.479
 it's the key that is actually the hit 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:06.040
 of knife you go into actually for 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:13.240
 you when I'm going to give you the menu 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:16.290
 it will either VIP or either either 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:18.970
 vip its administrator in vip 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.500
 he is a little less complete slightly 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:23.200
 less complete than the administrator but 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:26.729
 you will never have access to the bottom menu 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:28.900
 as a teleporte menu lobby menu 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.030
 almost all ubs accounts at all 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:33.310
 the bottom menus because it's especially 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:36.220
 reserved for each other so me if it's me 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:39.010
 in the part and asloum 016 and him if 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:41.049
 you are with him in his part and 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:42.850
 to open it you actually have to 

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:46.030
 I can open it game can open it in 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.560
 private party as partly online has 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.990
 no problem but just be 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.110
 host head or other part of the one 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.420

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:56.490
 so to start malinois of menus on 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:01.799

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:04.320
 say godmode to be invincible ufo 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:08.910
 fashion is to steal like that 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:11.959
 Cairo walked a shame for 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:16.140
 disable him and his mode will have square 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:20.160

 France is a mouthful 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:25.860
 the ornaments terminus so it's a 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:29.310

 times square to go faster or 

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:32.949
