00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.610
 welcome everyone we all know in the game gta 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:23.980
 5 you can see four unidentified 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:25.900
 the object that is, it is possible to find them under 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.150
 water in flight beat high in the sky above 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:31.270
 military base ford zankudo over the camp 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:33.340
 happy as well as over the mountain chiliad fans 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:35.620
 gta 5 suggest that you can somehow 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:38.050
 way to get inside and but or 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:40.420
 activate some action for 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.180
 all this you need to activate the script but 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.890
 talk about this a little later 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.840
 A couple of players found two game files. 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:49.930
 object ufa and ufa 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:51.820
 oh they need separate resources in what 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.830
 the difference between them is possible 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.600
 the difference is that you can 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:58.990
 interact with ufa 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:01.090
 oh can not after the next verification code 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:03.479
 you really start to believe that everything 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:06.790
 what we were looking for is already existing but 

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:09.850
 consider the theory of the first sunken 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:12.189
 plate is a common reference point he 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.229
 treated the same as any other 

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:16.540
 construction 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.100
 troy and 3 plates over the military base and 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:22.810
 camp happy is 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:25.329
 ufi game files remains only a plate 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:28.630
 over the mountain chilled it is ufa 

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:31.240
 why do you ask again you 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.170
 launches two plates over a military base and 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.139
 mihime camps 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:37.659
 at the background and it starts differently because 

00:01:35.139 --> 00:01:40.630
 has other conditions for unlocking 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:42.579
 these are the very conditions the game should be 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.920
 completed 100 percent on the clock 

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:47.829
 must be 3am and will go 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.389
 rain and so i think that drawing 

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:53.049
 warm turn displays our 

00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:56.400
 ability will detect 3 2 1 0 left on 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:58.260
 drawing it is ufo over camp happy 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.000
 ryan from military base indicated 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:03.030
 Jetpack icon on the right side 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.550
 patterned headboard this plate 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.380
 over chilled mountain she is special 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:09.479
 so as this and but also the only thing 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.960
 requires additional conditions from us 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:15.150
 from here she has her own script 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:17.130
 oh that's why she is at the head 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.810
 drawing the rest of it 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.540
 images possibly points to 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:24.780
 an additional condition is faith mountain rain and 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:27.300
 so on and remember 4 plate under water 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.910
 doesn't have a script it's just a landmark 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:32.130
 What do you think that displays signs? 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.500
 in the picture leave your guesses in 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.540
 comments under this video will return to 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.530
 script activation and loading of the interior 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.180
 and flying saucers 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.040
 if you have no idea what 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.170
 such squeak consider an example of 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.120
 story mission with bigfoot script 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.740
 activated upon a certain action and 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.540
 in this case, we needed to take 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:50.130
 sniper rifle zoom in 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.920
 image up to a certain level for 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:54.780
 further development of the flying event 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.450
 plates over the mountain can not be approached 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.160
 otherwise it will disappear from view and 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.840
 why can't we see a ray of light 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.209
 outgoing from the plate to the lookout 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.940
 the roof of the station or cable car 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:07.530
 maybe something is under the plate 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.420
 we need to look at it under 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.430
 zoom with sniper 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.940
 rifles can even be shot at 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.489
 something 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:16.650
 well maybe just take a picture but but on 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:19.440
 what to watch to be activated this 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:21.660
 the script present gamers know 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.340
 just a few script parameters this 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.830
 one hundred percent health and armor 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:28.739
 digits from minus 1 to 999 and and 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:31.080
 one hundred percent passage if we decide 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:33.319
 this mystery then we will be able to see or 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:35.599
 even get inside the plate 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:36.499
 on the English-language forum put forward such 

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:38.629
 assumption 

00:03:36.499 --> 00:03:40.579
 possible description of the interior files of the game 

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:42.769
 is part of abduction missions 

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:44.959
 michael aliens but we hurry 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:47.389
 dispel this guess script conditions 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:47.769
 clearly indicated 100% passing 

00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:50.150
 games 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:51.560
 move on to the numbers let's look at a few 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:55.280
 hypotheses concerning 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:57.950
 numbers from minus 1 to 999 and the first numbers 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:00.349
 this clothes minus 1 matches full 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:02.510
 lack of clothes for 999 

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:05.299
 this is a t-shirt that we are given after 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:08.030
 complete passage of the game the second hypothesis 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:10.760
 0 corresponds to the free mod that is gta 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:14.329
 online minus one is the player in the plot 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:16.669
 The default mode is 999 shift mode. 

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:18.829
 characters at zero ie online 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:21.560
 this script cannot be activated 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:24.199
 the third hypothesis minus one is ours 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:25.699
 characters michael trevor and franklin from 

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:27.620
 1st before test 99 

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:30.410
 This is the level of our character in gta 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:32.599
 online what is this really 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:36.320
 helps to activate the scripts alas to anyone 

00:04:32.599 --> 00:04:38.419
 it is not known yet 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:40.789
 opinion and guessing in the comments as well 

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:42.979

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:47.380
