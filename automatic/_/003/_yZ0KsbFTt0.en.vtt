from<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.570> eastern<00:00:52.050> side<00:00:52.320> because<00:00:52.770> the

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
from the eastern side because the

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.279 
from the eastern side because the
western<00:00:53.340> side<00:00:53.610> gets<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.180> afternoon<00:00:54.690> Sun<00:00:54.989> in

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
get sunburned if you have east west rose

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.170 
get sunburned if you have east west rose
you<00:01:01.770> would<00:01:01.890> mostly<00:01:02.190> want<00:01:02.430> to<00:01:02.520> work<00:01:02.730> from<00:01:03.030> the

you would mostly want to work from the
north<00:01:03.510> side<00:01:03.870> because<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:04.830> south<00:01:05.070> side<00:01:05.460> can

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
north side because the south side can

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.020 
north side because the south side can
have<00:01:06.420> a<00:01:06.750> tendency<00:01:07.320> to<00:01:07.350> be<00:01:07.830> in<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.430> hot<00:01:08.640> Sun<00:01:09.000> all

south side either way you have to be
careful<00:01:13.770> not<00:01:13.950> to<00:01:14.010> over<00:01:14.460> expose<00:01:14.939> if<00:01:15.720> your

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
careful not to over expose if your

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.870 
careful not to over expose if your
vineyard<00:01:16.200> is<00:01:16.320> not<00:01:16.500> north<00:01:16.950> and<00:01:17.159> south<00:01:17.369> or<00:01:17.729> east

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
vineyard is not north and south or east

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.940 
vineyard is not north and south or east
and<00:01:18.119> west<00:01:18.299> directly<00:01:18.570> then<00:01:19.320> what<00:01:19.530> you<00:01:19.650> want<00:01:19.830> to

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.429 
and west directly then what you want to
do<00:01:20.220> is<00:01:20.520> work<00:01:21.000> from<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.360> side<00:01:21.600> that<00:01:22.170> does<00:01:22.409> not

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
do is work from the side that does not

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.370 
do is work from the side that does not
get<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.430> afternoon<00:01:24.060> Sun<00:01:24.479> so<00:01:25.080> that's<00:01:25.170> what

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
get the afternoon Sun so that's what

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.880 
get the afternoon Sun so that's what
we're<00:01:25.500> doing<00:01:25.770> in<00:01:25.890> this<00:01:26.009> vineyard<00:01:27.590> when<00:01:28.590> is

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
we're doing in this vineyard when is

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.819 
we're doing in this vineyard when is
actually<00:01:29.340> also<00:01:29.700> a<00:01:29.909> very<00:01:30.150> critical<00:01:30.420> thing<00:01:30.900> we

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
actually also a very critical thing we

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.550 
actually also a very critical thing we
usually<00:01:32.460> do<00:01:32.729> leaf<00:01:33.329> and<00:01:33.509> lateral<00:01:33.869> removal<00:01:34.350> a

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
usually do leaf and lateral removal a

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.190 
usually do leaf and lateral removal a
few<00:01:34.920> weeks<00:01:35.130> post<00:01:35.640> set<00:01:36.030> we<00:01:36.540> don't<00:01:36.780> want<00:01:36.960> to<00:01:37.049> do

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
few weeks post set we don't want to do

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.690 
few weeks post set we don't want to do
it<00:01:37.320> while<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.619> berries<00:01:37.920> are<00:01:38.100> flowering

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
it while the berries are flowering

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.340 
it while the berries are flowering
because<00:01:38.850> we<00:01:39.119> can<00:01:39.240> disturb<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.810> process<00:01:40.259> of

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
because we can disturb the process of

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.889 
because we can disturb the process of
fertilization<00:01:41.150> and<00:01:42.150> we<00:01:42.329> don't<00:01:42.509> want<00:01:42.659> to<00:01:42.720> wait

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
fertilization and we don't want to wait

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.319 
fertilization and we don't want to wait
too<00:01:43.259> long<00:01:43.470> because<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.310> earlier<00:01:44.729> we<00:01:44.939> do<00:01:45.149> it

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
too long because the earlier we do it

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:46.850 
too long because the earlier we do it
the<00:01:45.659> more<00:01:45.840> quickly<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.229> grapes<00:01:46.560> will<00:01:46.770> get

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
the more quickly the grapes will get

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.740 
the more quickly the grapes will get
acclimated<00:01:47.070> to<00:01:47.549> their<00:01:47.820> new<00:01:48.030> level<00:01:48.390> of<00:01:48.509> sun

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
acclimated to their new level of sun

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.789 
acclimated to their new level of sun
exposure<00:01:49.140> and<00:01:49.439> will<00:01:49.950> end<00:01:50.610> and<00:01:51.110> be<00:01:52.110> less<00:01:52.500> likely

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
exposure and will end and be less likely

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.649 
exposure and will end and be less likely
to<00:01:52.950> have<00:01:53.100> sunburn<00:01:53.670> so<00:01:54.090> you<00:01:54.149> don't<00:01:54.329> want<00:01:54.479> to<00:01:54.540> do

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
to have sunburn so you don't want to do

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.389 
to have sunburn so you don't want to do
it<00:01:54.810> right<00:01:54.960> before<00:01:55.110> a<00:01:55.290> forecasted<00:01:56.009> heat<00:01:56.219> wave

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
it right before a forecasted heat wave

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.039 
it right before a forecasted heat wave
and<00:01:56.729> you<00:01:57.090> also<00:01:57.240> don't<00:01:57.390> want<00:01:57.570> to<00:01:57.630> do<00:01:57.719> it<00:01:57.840> too

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
and you also don't want to do it too

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.719 
and you also don't want to do it too
late<00:01:58.229> in<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.409> season<00:01:58.680> where<00:01:59.040> it<00:01:59.159> generally<00:01:59.549> is

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
late in the season where it generally is

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.850 
late in the season where it generally is
pretty<00:02:00.090> hot<00:02:00.329> and<00:02:00.540> you<00:02:00.869> risk<00:02:01.079> the<00:02:01.409> possibility

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
pretty hot and you risk the possibility

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.130 
pretty hot and you risk the possibility
of<00:02:02.159> getting<00:02:02.310> sunburned<00:02:02.909> also<00:02:03.780> it's<00:02:04.079> really

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
of getting sunburned also it's really

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.260 
of getting sunburned also it's really
good<00:02:04.530> to<00:02:04.649> get<00:02:04.770> it<00:02:04.920> done<00:02:05.130> before<00:02:05.579> you<00:02:05.909> do<00:02:06.119> your

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
good to get it done before you do your

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.350 
good to get it done before you do your
final<00:02:06.570> mildew

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
final mildew

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.139 
final mildew
maybe<00:02:07.840> it<00:02:07.990> oil<00:02:08.259> or<00:02:08.590> sulfur<00:02:09.100> or<00:02:09.430> an<00:02:09.729> organic

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
maybe it oil or sulfur or an organic

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:12.660 
maybe it oil or sulfur or an organic
product<00:02:10.390> or<00:02:10.780> any<00:02:10.930> kind<00:02:11.170> of<00:02:11.230> fungicide<00:02:11.680> because

product or any kind of fungicide because
once<00:02:12.850> you<00:02:13.000> do<00:02:13.240> this<00:02:13.570> canopy<00:02:13.930> work<00:02:14.230> you'll<00:02:14.680> have

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
once you do this canopy work you'll have

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.340 
once you do this canopy work you'll have
better<00:02:15.040> coverage<00:02:15.670> and<00:02:15.910> better<00:02:16.750> penetration

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
better coverage and better penetration

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:19.740 
better coverage and better penetration
and<00:02:17.770> so<00:02:18.160> you'll<00:02:18.400> be<00:02:18.520> more<00:02:18.940> effective<00:02:19.510> with

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
and so you'll be more effective with

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:25.790 
and so you'll be more effective with
that<00:02:19.900> final<00:02:20.170> spray<00:02:20.560> coverage<00:02:23.730> why<00:02:24.730> okay

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
that final spray coverage why okay

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.780 
that final spray coverage why okay

cultural control methods so that we can

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.920 
cultural control methods so that we can

that we need in the vineyards and what
we<00:02:43.720> do<00:02:43.900> here<00:02:44.440> this<00:02:44.740> cultural<00:02:45.700> practice<00:02:46.300> of

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
we do here this cultural practice of

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.540 
we do here this cultural practice of
leek<00:02:46.720> and<00:02:46.900> lateral<00:02:47.290> removal<00:02:47.770> will<00:02:48.250> allow

leek and lateral removal will allow

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:51.720 
leek and lateral removal will allow

into<00:02:52.270> the<00:02:52.660> area<00:02:53.020> where<00:02:53.320> we<00:02:53.440> have<00:02:53.620> our<00:02:53.830> grapes

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
into the area where we have our grapes

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.610 
into the area where we have our grapes
and<00:02:54.400> thereby<00:02:55.150> naturally<00:02:55.930> reduce<00:02:56.110> the

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.050 
like mildews and molds we also want to

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:04.350 
like mildews and molds we also want to
create<00:03:02.290> a<00:03:02.470> situation<00:03:02.709> where<00:03:03.489> we<00:03:03.880> have<00:03:04.120> a

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
create a situation where we have a

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:10.300 
into the fruiting area if we have a lot

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.509 
into the fruiting area if we have a lot
of<00:03:10.450> fruit<00:03:10.720> in<00:03:10.840> the<00:03:11.050> interior<00:03:11.440> of<00:03:11.980> a<00:03:12.250> crowded

the fruit on the exterior of the canopy

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.970 
the fruit on the exterior of the canopy
we<00:03:18.970> want<00:03:19.180> to<00:03:19.330> create<00:03:19.540> uniform<00:03:20.200> ripening<00:03:20.650> so<00:03:20.890> we

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
we want to create uniform ripening so we

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.120 
we want to create uniform ripening so we
can<00:03:21.130> pick<00:03:21.370> a<00:03:21.549> uniform<00:03:22.120> harvest<00:03:22.959> date<00:03:23.230> and<00:03:23.530> not

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
can pick a uniform harvest date and not

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:27.509 
can pick a uniform harvest date and not
have<00:03:24.400> fruit<00:03:24.730> that's<00:03:24.970> green<00:03:25.360> or<00:03:26.100> raisiny<00:03:27.100> we

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:27.519 
have fruit that's green or raisiny we

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:29.550 
have fruit that's green or raisiny we
want<00:03:27.700> fruit<00:03:27.970> to<00:03:28.090> be<00:03:28.209> perfectly<00:03:28.630> ripe<00:03:28.930> when<00:03:29.410> we

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
want fruit to be perfectly ripe when we

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:35.580 
want fruit to be perfectly ripe when we
pick<00:03:29.769> it<00:03:31.230> so<00:03:32.670> how<00:03:33.930> that's<00:03:34.930> an<00:03:35.140> interesting

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
pick it so how that's an interesting

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.620 
pick it so how that's an interesting
question<00:03:35.739> and<00:03:36.130> it<00:03:36.400> depends<00:03:36.850> on<00:03:36.940> how<00:03:37.299> expensive

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:37.630 
question and it depends on how expensive

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:40.110 
question and it depends on how expensive
the<00:03:37.900> fruit<00:03:38.140> is<00:03:38.290> this<00:03:39.280> is<00:03:39.430> actually<00:03:39.790> already<00:03:39.910> a

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
the fruit is this is actually already a

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.759 
the fruit is this is actually already a
fairly<00:03:40.390> open<00:03:40.630> canopy<00:03:41.080> so<00:03:41.500> we're<00:03:41.620> going<00:03:41.709> to

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:41.769 
fairly open canopy so we're going to

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:44.370 
fairly open canopy so we're going to
minimally<00:03:42.549> remove<00:03:42.880> leaves<00:03:43.150> and<00:03:43.480> be<00:03:43.870> focusing

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.380 
minimally remove leaves and be focusing

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:46.500 
minimally remove leaves and be focusing
mostly<00:03:44.680> on<00:03:44.769> laterals<00:03:45.370> it<00:03:45.760> also<00:03:45.970> depends<00:03:46.450> on

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 
mostly on laterals it also depends on

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.420 
mostly on laterals it also depends on
how<00:03:46.660> skilled<00:03:47.080> your<00:03:47.260> crew<00:03:47.500> is<00:03:47.680> you<00:03:48.190> might<00:03:48.400> want

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
how skilled your crew is you might want

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.570 
how skilled your crew is you might want
to<00:03:48.700> give<00:03:48.910> a<00:03:49.150> crew<00:03:49.660> a<00:03:49.870> very<00:03:50.290> basic<00:03:50.739> instruction

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:51.580 
to give a crew a very basic instruction

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:55.530 
to give a crew a very basic instruction
like<00:03:51.790> remove<00:03:52.540> the<00:03:53.250> laterals<00:03:54.250> the<00:03:54.730> first<00:03:55.030> three

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
like remove the laterals the first three

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.229 
like remove the laterals the first three
or<00:03:55.720> four<00:03:55.959> laterals<00:03:56.500> along<00:03:56.799> the<00:03:56.980> chute<00:03:57.250> or

00:03:58.229 --> 00:03:58.239 
or four laterals along the chute or

00:03:58.239 --> 00:03:59.430 
or four laterals along the chute or
remove

00:03:59.430 --> 00:03:59.440 
remove

Eve's up until the first cluster but not
above<00:04:03.720> so<00:04:04.720> generally<00:04:05.260> you<00:04:05.680> want<00:04:05.800> to<00:04:05.980> try<00:04:06.400> to

keep a shelf of protection over the

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.050 
keep a shelf of protection over the
fruit<00:04:11.280> again<00:04:12.280> you<00:04:12.460> don't<00:04:12.610> want<00:04:12.730> to<00:04:12.880> have

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.060 
fruit again you don't want to have

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.170 
fruit again you don't want to have
excessive<00:04:13.780> sun<00:04:14.560> exposure<00:04:14.950> it's<00:04:15.550> also<00:04:15.790> good<00:04:16.150> to

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
excessive sun exposure it's also good to

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.539 
excessive sun exposure it's also good to
work<00:04:16.450> from<00:04:16.630> the<00:04:16.750> interior<00:04:17.410> of<00:04:17.650> the<00:04:17.769> canopy<00:04:18.100> and

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:18.549 
work from the interior of the canopy and

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:21.150 
work from the interior of the canopy and
not<00:04:19.120> really<00:04:19.420> strip<00:04:19.780> leaves<00:04:20.049> here's<00:04:20.830> one<00:04:21.040> of

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.160 
not really strip leaves here's one of

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.490 
not really strip leaves here's one of
the<00:04:21.220> laterals

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
the laterals

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.130 
the laterals
here's<00:04:23.500> another<00:04:23.650> lateral<00:04:24.570> some<00:04:25.570> leaves<00:04:25.870> down

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:26.140 
here's another lateral some leaves down

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:30.150 
here's another lateral some leaves down
below<00:04:27.150> so<00:04:28.150> we're<00:04:28.300> just<00:04:28.330> kind<00:04:28.660> of<00:04:28.780> opening<00:04:29.410> this

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:30.160 
below so we're just kind of opening this

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:31.260 
below so we're just kind of opening this
fruit<00:04:30.490> we'll<00:04:30.670> leave<00:04:30.850> this<00:04:31.000> one<00:04:31.240> for

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:31.270 
fruit we'll leave this one for

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:36.120 
fruit we'll leave this one for
protection<00:04:34.020> this<00:04:35.020> time<00:04:35.320> is<00:04:35.470> also<00:04:35.680> a<00:04:35.830> great

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:36.130 
protection this time is also a great

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:37.890 
protection this time is also a great
time<00:04:36.370> to<00:04:36.550> clean<00:04:36.760> up<00:04:36.880> any<00:04:37.030> suckers<00:04:37.540> that<00:04:37.720> might

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:37.900 
time to clean up any suckers that might

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:45.860 
time to clean up any suckers that might
have<00:04:38.050> regrown

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.500 

so<00:04:46.470> we're<00:04:46.650> going<00:04:46.740> to<00:04:46.800> do<00:04:46.949> a<00:04:46.980> close-up<00:04:47.280> as<00:04:48.240> well

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:48.510 
so we're going to do a close-up as well

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:53.600 
so we're going to do a close-up as well
and<00:04:48.870> show<00:04:49.050> you<00:04:49.110> what<00:04:49.350> a<00:04:49.380> lateral<00:04:49.800> is<00:04:50.100> a<00:04:52.610> lateral

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.610 
and show you what a lateral is a lateral

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:56.750 
and show you what a lateral is a lateral
basically<00:04:54.210> grows<00:04:54.570> off<00:04:54.960> of<00:04:55.320> the<00:04:55.800> main<00:04:56.040> chute<00:04:56.490> at

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:56.760 
basically grows off of the main chute at

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.870 
basically grows off of the main chute at
the<00:04:57.389> base<00:04:57.690> of<00:04:57.720> a<00:04:58.020> leaf<00:04:58.260> so<00:04:58.949> here<00:04:59.250> is<00:04:59.370> a<00:04:59.400> lateral

00:04:59.870 --> 00:04:59.880 
the base of a leaf so here is a lateral

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:02.629 
the base of a leaf so here is a lateral
so<00:05:00.870> you<00:05:00.960> might<00:05:01.229> want<00:05:01.410> to<00:05:01.500> take<00:05:01.800> this<00:05:02.160> lateral

00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:02.639 
so you might want to take this lateral

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:09.500 
so you might want to take this lateral
off<00:05:06.949> remove<00:05:07.949> a<00:05:08.040> few<00:05:08.250> more<00:05:08.400> leaves<00:05:08.699> around<00:05:09.270> that

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:09.510 
off remove a few more leaves around that

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:10.129 
off remove a few more leaves around that
fruit

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:10.139 
fruit

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:22.170 
fruit
here's<00:05:10.560> another<00:05:10.710> lateral

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:22.180 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:26.710 

and<00:05:23.230> a<00:05:24.230> few<00:05:24.440> more<00:05:24.620> interior<00:05:25.130> canopy<00:05:25.850> leaves

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:26.720 
and a few more interior canopy leaves

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:32.100 
and a few more interior canopy leaves
and<00:05:26.990> laterals<00:05:27.440> and<00:05:29.470> there<00:05:30.470> you<00:05:30.590> have<00:05:30.770> it

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:32.110 
and laterals and there you have it

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:34.660 
and laterals and there you have it
that's<00:05:33.110> the<00:05:33.380> process<00:05:33.830> of<00:05:33.980> leaf<00:05:34.160> and<00:05:34.340> lateral

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:34.670 
that's the process of leaf and lateral

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:36.430 
that's the process of leaf and lateral
removal<00:05:35.090> and<00:05:35.240> vineyards<00:05:35.570> it<00:05:35.900> can<00:05:36.140> vary

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:36.440 
removal and vineyards it can vary

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.020 
removal and vineyards it can vary
