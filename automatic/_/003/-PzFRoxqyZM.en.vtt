00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.020
 I have been asked to repeat the paradox of 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.770
 the life 

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:07.770
 and there goes 

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:13.360
 they say god created the donkey and told him 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.750
 it will be donkey 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:19.250
 you work from sunrise to sunset 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:23.170
 and will load on your back what I put you 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:25.390
 and you will live 35 years and the donkey answered 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:28.000
 Sir 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:30.160
 I will be everything you ask but 35 years 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.210
 much 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.210
 because the best thing there 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.040
 and god created the donkey 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:43.760
 then I believe the dog and said you will be 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:49.020
 dog will take care of the men's house 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:51.700
 you will see what they give you and you will live 25 years 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.340
 and the dog replied sr 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.820
 I will be everything you ask but 25 years is 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:59.290
 much 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.290
 because the best 15 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:04.920
 and I believe the dog 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:07.210
 then he created the monkey and said he will be cute 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.130
 you will do antics to amuse the 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.650
 the rest 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:15.880
 and you will live 10 years 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:19.450
 and the happy monkey sir be in everything 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:22.649
 ask me but ten years a lot 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.649
 because no better yes 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:29.040
 I believe the monkey finally created the 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.290
 man and told him you'll be the most 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:36.000
 smart of the earth 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:40.010
 you will dominate the world you will live 30 years 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:43.760
 and the man answered sir 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:45.590
 I will be everything I ask but 38 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.440
 because they do not give me also the 15 that 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.040
 rejected the donkey 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:53.960
 and the days that what the dog did 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.960
 and the five that do not accept the monkey 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:01.579
 and I think good 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:05.390
 and this is how man lives 30 years 

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:07.700
 as men then he marries and lives 15 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.410
 years as a donkey working from sunrise to sunset 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.140
 and carrying on his back the weight of 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.500
 the family 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.950
 again take care 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.890
 live 10 years as dogs 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:21.650
 taking care of the house eating what they give 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.750
 and ends up living five years as a monkey 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.519
 jumping from house to house of children and 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.860
 doing antics to amuse the 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:30.370
 grandchildren and this is the paradox of life 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.370
 and me 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:35.080
 and I wanted to tell her
