00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.860
 I'm the general petty officer 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:18.189
 can you say sir paton please 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:20.349
 let's go around the world and 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:21.970
 talked to everyone there is nothing 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:23.480
 that I can not do my problem that does not 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.520
 can overcome 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.900
 I've learned a lot from life, not you 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.150
 face a great man but rather 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.830
 armed everything worthwhile deserves 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.900
 an effort the moderation is for 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:34.970
 cowards I am a lover I am a fighter 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.510
 of belonging to the demolition team of 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:39.600
 the Sims 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.030
 listen red wings on the fly a bad guy 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.530
 commander-in-chief of the Taliban killed 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.530
 to 20 Marines last week 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:53.260
 h are the same 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.260
 marcus 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:12.670
 the operation is in danger 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:15.100
 here is split 01 checking dan on your 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:17.950
 radio works well we have two options 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.750
 1 we let them go and we played it and in 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:22.000
 when they get down we will have 200 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:24.190
 crazy chasing the nests we eliminate 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.590
 the danger we can not do that I do not 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:28.869
 they matter to me, you matter to me and you 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.940
 I care about you not killing children like that 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:32.950
 media is not a vote we are going to 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:35.759
 drop and then let's get them understood 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.759
 synthesized 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.579
 no shooting of cojones is expected 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.850
 a rugged storm inside 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:00.909
 and my impulse 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.940
 that can take you further than what 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:09.110
 you thought possible 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.110
 your country 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.260
 take care of us 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:21.330
 we are really true of cojones 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.300
 because your fight never ends
