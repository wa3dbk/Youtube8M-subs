00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
difference between teaching here at hip

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:50.990 
difference between teaching here at hip
hop<00:00:49.440> international<00:00:49.620> and<00:00:50.280> back<00:00:50.789> in<00:00:50.910> New

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.049 
hop international and back in New
Zealand<00:00:51.329> um<00:00:52.110> I<00:00:52.739> would<00:00:52.860> have<00:00:53.219> to<00:00:53.399> say<00:00:53.430> just<00:00:53.820> like

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
Zealand um I would have to say just like

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.880 
Zealand um I would have to say just like
the<00:00:54.210> different<00:00:54.570> styles<00:00:55.020> of<00:00:55.170> all<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.500> dancers

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
the different styles of all the dancers

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.920 
the different styles of all the dancers
I<00:00:56.160> think<00:00:56.370> it's<00:00:57.180> just<00:00:57.300> really<00:00:57.329> cool<00:00:57.629> to<00:00:57.690> have

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
I think it's just really cool to have

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.660 
I think it's just really cool to have
people<00:00:58.680> from<00:00:58.770> all<00:00:58.949> around<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.190> world<00:00:59.280> being

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
people from all around the world being

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.299 
people from all around the world being
in<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.820> same<00:01:00.030> place<00:01:00.449> and<00:01:00.930> doing<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:02.129> same

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
in the same place and doing the same

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.340 
in the same place and doing the same
quarry<00:01:02.609> so<00:01:02.969> it's<00:01:03.449> definitely<00:01:03.750> interpreted

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
quarry so it's definitely interpreted

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.520 
quarry so it's definitely interpreted
very<00:01:04.530> differently<00:01:04.589> here<00:01:05.220> but<00:01:05.670> I<00:01:06.090> guess<00:01:06.780> yeah

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
very differently here but I guess yeah

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.350 
very differently here but I guess yeah

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
everyone's when they dance like the same

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.620

the students the dancers don't want to
come<00:01:58.060> out<00:01:58.179> to<00:01:58.329> hear<00:01:58.479> what<00:01:58.600> do<00:01:58.659> you<00:01:58.750> have<00:01:58.869> to

00:01:59.039 --> 00:01:59.049 
come out to hear what do you have to

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:00.990 
come out to hear what do you have to
encourage<00:01:59.200> them<00:01:59.679> to<00:01:59.710> come<00:02:00.399> out<00:02:00.460> here<00:02:00.579> and<00:02:00.759> take

encourage them to come out here and take

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.460 
encourage them to come out here and take
classes<00:02:01.210> to<00:02:01.750> go<00:02:02.200> compete<00:02:02.679> I<00:02:03.420> guess<00:02:04.420> I<00:02:04.810> just

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 
classes to go compete I guess I just

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:06.690 
classes to go compete I guess I just
think<00:02:05.890> this<00:02:05.950> is<00:02:06.009> a<00:02:06.100> really<00:02:06.399> cool<00:02:06.670> opportunity

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
think this is a really cool opportunity

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.699 
think this is a really cool opportunity
like<00:02:07.329> the<00:02:07.450> competition<00:02:07.960> itself<00:02:08.259> is<00:02:08.500> just

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709 
like the competition itself is just

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:11.250 
like the competition itself is just
amazing<00:02:08.979> and<00:02:09.459> I<00:02:09.670> think<00:02:10.239> more<00:02:10.810> than<00:02:10.840> it<00:02:11.050> being<00:02:11.170> a

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
amazing and I think more than it being a

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:12.690 
amazing and I think more than it being a
competition<00:02:11.560> is<00:02:11.860> just<00:02:12.099> so<00:02:12.250> much<00:02:12.370> to<00:02:12.430> take<00:02:12.640> in

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
competition is just so much to take in

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.449 
competition is just so much to take in
and<00:02:13.150> I<00:02:13.720> think<00:02:13.989> people<00:02:14.260> from<00:02:14.920> all<00:02:15.190> over<00:02:15.220> the

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
and I think people from all over the

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:17.309 
and I think people from all over the
world<00:02:15.489> being<00:02:15.849> same<00:02:16.239> place<00:02:16.480> dancing<00:02:16.780> it's<00:02:17.110> just

I think it's such a cool experience and

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:21.660 
I think it's such a cool experience and
it's<00:02:19.720> how<00:02:19.810> we<00:02:19.989> come<00:02:20.200> every<00:02:20.470> year<00:02:20.500> and<00:02:20.920> of
