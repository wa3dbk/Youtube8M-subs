00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
of which are are even easier than this

of which are are even easier than this
one<00:02:08.990> plate<00:02:09.259> earth<00:02:09.380> fire<00:02:09.560> is<00:02:09.740> pretty<00:02:09.950> easy<00:02:10.160> and

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
one plate earth fire is pretty easy and

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:12.490 
one plate earth fire is pretty easy and
again<00:02:10.460> this<00:02:10.640> is<00:02:10.759> presented<00:02:11.210> in<00:02:11.330> a<00:02:11.450> manner<00:02:12.080> to

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
again this is presented in a manner to

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.080 
again this is presented in a manner to
really<00:02:12.800> work<00:02:12.980> on<00:02:13.130> your<00:02:13.190> ear<00:02:13.460> training<00:02:13.819> and

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
really work on your ear training and

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 
probably if you have a little bit of

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:16.990 
probably if you have a little bit of
experience<00:02:16.100> with<00:02:16.250> that<00:02:16.340> you<00:02:16.550> can<00:02:16.670> figure<00:02:16.850> it

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
experience with that you can figure it

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.880 
experience with that you can figure it
out<00:02:17.060> already<00:02:17.450> just<00:02:17.780> by<00:02:17.960> listening<00:02:18.350> to<00:02:18.410> it<00:02:18.530> but

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
out already just by listening to it but
