00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:18.949 
this row chain 2 12 this is actually

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:23.550 
this row chain 2 12 this is actually
called<00:00:19.160> the<00:00:19.690> turning<00:00:20.690> on<00:00:21.040> the<00:00:22.040> turning<00:00:22.340> chain

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:23.560 
called the turning on the turning chain

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.020

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:34.730 
first stitch so you pull yarn over again

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.840 
first stitch so you pull yarn over again
you<00:00:34.910> pull<00:00:35.120> the<00:00:35.390> yarn<00:00:35.690> through<00:00:35.920> the<00:00:36.920> stitch<00:00:37.250> or

you have to chain three after the first

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:33.010 
you have to chain three after the first
row<00:01:25.959> one<00:01:27.159> two<00:01:28.509> three<00:01:31.329> so<00:01:32.329> after<00:01:32.689> you<00:01:32.810> do<00:01:32.990> that

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
row one two three so after you do that

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.139 
row one two three so after you do that
you<00:01:33.499> turn<00:01:33.920> your<00:01:34.099> work<00:01:34.249> around<00:01:34.579> and<00:01:34.849> then<00:01:35.029> you

00:01:35.139 --> 00:01:35.149 
you turn your work around and then you

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:37.480 
you turn your work around and then you
yarn<00:01:35.329> over<00:01:35.689> and<00:01:35.840> go<00:01:36.799> through<00:01:37.069> the<00:01:37.219> first

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 
yarn over and go through the first

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:42.370 
yarn over and go through the first
stitch<00:01:38.649> so<00:01:39.649> now<00:01:40.009> you<00:01:40.069> have<00:01:40.459> three<00:01:41.170> loops<00:01:42.170> on

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
stitch so now you have three loops on

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.129 
stitch so now you have three loops on
your<00:01:42.590> crochet<00:01:43.279> hook<00:01:43.429> and<00:01:43.849> then<00:01:44.359> yarn<00:01:44.630> over<00:01:44.810> and

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
row I'm going to chain four instead of

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:15.380 
row I'm going to chain four instead of
three<00:02:09.700> one<00:02:10.700> two<00:02:11.000> three<00:02:12.310> four

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.680 

and<00:02:15.600> then<00:02:16.470> I<00:02:16.680> have<00:02:16.800> to<00:02:16.830> turn<00:02:17.130> my<00:02:17.190> work<00:02:17.520> and<00:02:17.760> then

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
and then I have to turn my work and then

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.750 
and then I have to turn my work and then
I<00:02:18.810> have<00:02:19.020> two<00:02:19.290> yarn<00:02:20.190> over<00:02:20.280> twice<00:02:22.310> before<00:02:23.310> I<00:02:23.550> go

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
I have two yarn over twice before I go

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.559 
I have two yarn over twice before I go
through<00:02:23.970> the<00:02:24.120> stitch<00:02:25.459> so<00:02:26.459> look<00:02:26.850> like<00:02:27.030> that<00:02:27.300> and

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
through the stitch so look like that and

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:29.870 
through the stitch so look like that and
then<00:02:27.930> I<00:02:28.200> would<00:02:28.470> pull<00:02:28.860> the<00:02:29.040> yarn<00:02:29.310> through<00:02:29.400> two

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
then I would pull the yarn through two

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.920 
then I would pull the yarn through two
at<00:02:30.030> a<00:02:30.060> time<00:02:30.120> just<00:02:30.569> like<00:02:30.690> the<00:02:30.900> other<00:02:31.020> one<00:02:32.870> so<00:02:33.870> you

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
at a time just like the other one so you

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:39.680 
at a time just like the other one so you
do<00:02:34.200> that<00:02:34.410> so<00:02:35.040> yarn<00:02:35.370> over<00:02:35.580> twice<00:02:38.240> pull<00:02:39.240> the<00:02:39.450> yarn

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
do that so yarn over twice pull the yarn

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:46.220 
do that so yarn over twice pull the yarn
through<00:02:41.900> yarn<00:02:42.900> over<00:02:42.989> again<00:02:43.410> yarn<00:02:44.870> through<00:02:45.870> and

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
through yarn over again yarn through and

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:47.870 
through yarn over again yarn through and
then<00:02:46.440> yarn<00:02:46.739> over<00:02:46.860> and<00:02:47.100> then<00:02:47.489> the<00:02:47.610> yarn<00:02:47.820> through

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
then yarn over and then the yarn through

then yarn over and then the yarn through
the<00:02:48.060> last<00:02:48.300> two<00:02:51.709> so<00:02:52.709> that's<00:02:53.040> all<00:02:53.130> you<00:02:53.280> have<00:02:53.459> to
