00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:11.300
 pretty simple product right now I'm going to 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:16.670
 do this and good is a card 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:18.410
 radio m video r 92 70 x of the new 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:23.430
 good generation is not new 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:25.950
 this is basically a previous 6870 hd 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.740
 a little tuned for instructions 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:35.340
 faster and good the one that I have here is 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:36.989
 a m 609 270 x 6 thousand 12 that is the 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.140
 perfect months video and how 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:43.230
 you prosser 4 the refrigeration that 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:49.730
 basically comes with double fan 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:49.730
 good is used as the fpv 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:58.770
 0 283 processes that is what it is 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:05.379
 the core speed on this card 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:08.409
 is 30 megahertz and one thousand 120 megahertz 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:11.909
 in boost speed 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:17.120
 2 gigs of dedicated memory for video 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:20.520
 type ddr5 and with a 256-bit interface 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:24.670
 and good is a card 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:27.960
 you need a 600 power source 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:30.909
 watts with 30 periods of toxo line 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:35.530
 as we see here you need two connectors 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:39.040
 6 pin pci express and it has a size 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:42.299
 which is moderate can fit in many 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:46.090
 boxes and our away because it's 10.24 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:48.880
 inches that are roughly about 26 27 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:51.850
 centimeters long 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:55.720
 that's going to require doubles in the 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:02:00.159
 part that comes out of age the case 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:04.030
 6 for the part of the heatsink 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:07.569
 heat and in the health part of the 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:10.170
 video effort these ports that 

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:10.170
 we have there 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:16.330
 the video outputs we have hdmi 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:20.770

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:25.240
