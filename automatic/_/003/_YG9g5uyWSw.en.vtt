down a little bit because sometimes when

they can be a little bit acidic so you

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:18.690

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:20.160 
so much easier than the blender I have
to<00:03:18.250> admit<00:03:18.549> I<00:03:18.700> was<00:03:18.880> a<00:03:18.910> little<00:03:19.269> bit<00:03:19.450> skeptical<00:03:20.079> at

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 
to admit I was a little bit skeptical at

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:21.390 
to admit I was a little bit skeptical at
first<00:03:20.230> because<00:03:20.799> I'm<00:03:21.010> a<00:03:21.040> little<00:03:21.310> bit

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
first because I'm a little bit

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.800 
first because I'm a little bit
old-school<00:03:21.610> when<00:03:22.000> it<00:03:22.090> comes<00:03:22.269> to<00:03:22.390> my<00:03:22.510> kitchen

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
old-school when it comes to my kitchen

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.920 
old-school when it comes to my kitchen
gadgets<00:03:23.140> so<00:03:23.590> I<00:03:23.890> got<00:03:24.820> one<00:03:25.090> from<00:03:25.299> Cuisinart<00:03:25.810> it's

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
gadgets so I got one from Cuisinart it's

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.319 
gadgets so I got one from Cuisinart it's

pleased<00:03:28.600> with<00:03:28.630> the<00:03:28.840> result<00:03:29.170> so<00:03:29.290> check<00:03:29.650> it<00:03:29.769> out

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:29.860 
pleased with the result so check it out

can see it just blends your soup right
up<00:03:37.540> you<00:03:38.200> don't<00:03:38.260> have<00:03:38.410> to<00:03:38.500> transfer<00:03:39.010> it<00:03:39.130> into<00:03:39.280> a

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
up you don't have to transfer it into a

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.430 
up you don't have to transfer it into a
blender<00:03:39.700> you<00:03:40.150> don't<00:03:40.540> have<00:03:40.630> to<00:03:40.720> wash<00:03:40.930> out<00:03:41.170> a<00:03:41.200> big

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
blender you don't have to wash out a big

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.340 
blender you don't have to wash out a big
piece<00:03:41.620> of<00:03:41.650> kitchen<00:03:42.040> equipment

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:45.350 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:49.850 

it's<00:03:46.350> my<00:03:46.560> new<00:03:46.710> favorite<00:03:47.360> all<00:03:48.360> right<00:03:48.800> now<00:03:49.800> we

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 
it's my new favorite all right now we

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:51.680 
it's my new favorite all right now we
don't<00:03:49.980> want<00:03:50.190> to<00:03:50.250> blend<00:03:50.430> the<00:03:50.640> entire<00:03:51.000> soup<00:03:51.420> up

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
don't want to blend the entire soup up

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.170 
don't want to blend the entire soup up
because<00:03:52.350> I<00:03:52.650> do<00:03:52.950> like<00:03:53.280> to<00:03:53.310> have<00:03:53.550> a<00:03:53.610> tomato<00:03:53.970> soup

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
because I do like to have a tomato soup

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.420 
because I do like to have a tomato soup
that<00:03:54.390> is<00:03:54.600> still<00:03:54.990> a<00:03:55.020> little<00:03:55.260> bit<00:03:55.440> chunky<00:03:55.470> so

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
that is still a little bit chunky so

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:01.150 
that is still a little bit chunky so
just<00:03:57.030> give<00:03:57.330> it<00:03:57.360> I<00:03:57.720> don't<00:03:58.530> know<00:03:58.620> a<00:03:59.240> minute<00:04:00.240> or<00:04:00.480> so

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:01.160 
just give it I don't know a minute or so

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.360 
just give it I don't know a minute or so
when<00:04:02.160> I<00:04:02.190> think<00:04:02.400> you'll<00:04:02.490> be<00:04:02.580> good<00:04:03.350> now<00:04:04.350> if<00:04:05.220> you

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
when I think you'll be good now if you

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.100 
when I think you'll be good now if you
don't<00:04:05.490> have<00:04:05.730> one<00:04:05.880> of<00:04:05.910> these<00:04:06.030> that's<00:04:06.510> of<00:04:06.720> course

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.110 
don't have one of these that's of course

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:09.140 
don't have one of these that's of course
you<00:04:07.350> could<00:04:07.530> use<00:04:07.560> a<00:04:07.740> blender<00:04:08.190> that<00:04:08.670> is<00:04:08.730> the<00:04:09.030> way

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
you could use a blender that is the way

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.630 
you could use a blender that is the way
that<00:04:09.390> I<00:04:09.420> probably<00:04:09.660> would<00:04:09.900> have<00:04:09.960> done<00:04:10.080> fast<00:04:10.640> but

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
that I probably would have done fast but

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:17.810 
that I probably would have done fast but
they<00:04:11.730> are<00:04:11.880> really<00:04:12.120> great<00:04:16.370> then<00:04:17.370> the<00:04:17.489> final

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 
they are really great then the final

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:19.729 
they are really great then the final
thing<00:04:17.850> that<00:04:18.090> I<00:04:18.120> do<00:04:18.210> like<00:04:18.510> to<00:04:18.690> add<00:04:18.840> is<00:04:19.260> a<00:04:19.320> little

thing that I do like to add is a little

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:22.010 
thing that I do like to add is a little
bit<00:04:19.920> of<00:04:20.160> heavy<00:04:20.400> cream<00:04:20.520> now<00:04:21.300> if<00:04:21.600> you're<00:04:21.780> dieting

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
you don't have to you could just use a

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.900

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.830 
heavy cream does give it a wonderful
creaminess<00:04:29.310> so<00:04:29.940> you're<00:04:30.360> just<00:04:30.450> going<00:04:30.630> to<00:04:30.720> add

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
creaminess so you're just going to add

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.640 
creaminess so you're just going to add
about<00:04:31.230> a<00:04:31.680> tablespoon<00:04:32.220> to<00:04:32.850> table<00:04:33.170> and<00:04:34.170> give<00:04:34.530> it

sandwich is probably done so we're gonna

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:43.930 
sandwich is probably done so we're gonna
go<00:04:40.170> ahead<00:04:40.850> yeah<00:04:41.850> go<00:04:42.420> ahead<00:04:42.630> and<00:04:42.720> lift<00:04:42.900> that<00:04:43.080> out
