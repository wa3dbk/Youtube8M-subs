00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:03.929
 here we are back in crack as 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.970
 be well we all find here today a 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.950
 new mini game and look here and elegant 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.000
 has been put and my father noel when more 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.500
 what elegant I would say is a little 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.320
 novel of the future seems to like the one of 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.839
 century 50,000 but good I think that that 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.850
 handsome is already very handsome and this is 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.740
 this clothes we could call her by 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.930
 call it good that we're here a 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.420
 new so-called games is called turbo 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.689
 card race but I would call him mario 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:30.539
 mario mario craft instead of mario kart 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.430
 mario craft the easy joke bando da 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.200
 the same is the case is that because we are 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.270
 in game time racing in 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.280
 minecraft with cars and jacki weaver and 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.680
 car really to make minecraft those 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.510
 cars so beautiful the truth that a 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.469
 kind of tank this is a space 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:48.270
 spacecraft really but good the 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.129
 case is how you start to play this 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.030
 I think it's over here and departures to see 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.030
 effectively 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:59.570
 I do not know how 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.570

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:15.010

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.010

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:36.630
 I'm thankful, I do not understand, I understand 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:40.700
 I understand, it is worth putting my ship back 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.700
 big and how the studio shoots 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:44.910
 I do not know how to shoot things I do not know how 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.220

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:49.320

 we live here I can with the banana 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:35.100
 as a representation of dial but 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.020
 also and something 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:41.340
 but because I do not take the pictures 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:47.180
 mysterious but now it's my turn 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:47.180

 let's see first 

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:35.390

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.560
 justly 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:39.539
 because it's my turn 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:48.930
