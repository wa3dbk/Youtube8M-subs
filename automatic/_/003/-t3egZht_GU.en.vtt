hello there just a short demo on the

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.780 
hello there just a short demo on the
tourettes<00:00:03.780> pedal<00:00:04.140> and<00:00:04.319> made<00:00:05.069> it<00:00:05.220> myself

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
tourettes pedal and made it myself

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.870 
tourettes pedal and made it myself
it<00:00:06.629> has<00:00:06.810> a<00:00:07.379> video<00:00:07.649> 2<00:00:07.799> foot<00:00:07.980> switch<00:00:08.220> just<00:00:08.700> one

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
it has a video 2 foot switch just one

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.680 
it has a video 2 foot switch just one
control<00:00:09.330> volume<00:00:10.260> that's<00:00:11.190> oil<00:00:11.370> it's<00:00:11.700> a<00:00:12.389> weird

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
control volume that's oil it's a weird

control volume that's oil it's a weird
pedal<00:00:13.080> it's<00:00:13.980> a<00:00:14.420> false<00:00:15.420> pedal<00:00:15.809> which<00:00:17.570> which

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
pedal it's a false pedal which which

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.310 
pedal it's a false pedal which which
randomizes<00:00:19.380> the<00:00:20.310> note<00:00:20.600> you<00:00:21.600> put<00:00:21.810> into<00:00:22.170> it<00:00:22.289> the

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
randomizes the note you put into it the

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.080 
randomizes the note you put into it the
higher<00:00:22.529> up<00:00:22.710> the<00:00:22.800> fretboard<00:00:23.010> the<00:00:23.760> a<00:00:23.789> of<00:00:24.029> the

higher up the fretboard the a of the
frequency<00:00:24.600> of<00:00:24.630> the<00:00:24.750> note<00:00:24.779> then<00:00:25.289> we<00:00:25.470> randomized

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
frequency of the note then we randomized

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.210 
frequency of the note then we randomized
the<00:00:26.580> more<00:00:26.960> randomized<00:00:27.960> notes<00:00:28.500> and

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
the more randomized notes and

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.759 
the more randomized notes and
arpeggiated<00:00:29.910> runs<00:00:30.119> come<00:00:30.359> out<00:00:30.510> lower<00:00:31.500> down<00:00:31.679> the

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
arpeggiated runs come out lower down the

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.620 
arpeggiated runs come out lower down the
fretboard<00:00:32.009> it's<00:00:32.309> a<00:00:32.369> more<00:00:32.550> synthesized<00:00:33.149> bass

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
fretboard it's a more synthesized bass

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.600 
fretboard it's a more synthesized bass
since<00:00:33.989> sort<00:00:34.620> of<00:00:34.739> sound<00:00:34.980> that<00:00:35.160> comes<00:00:35.340> out<00:00:35.489> an

since sort of sound that comes out an

since sort of sound that comes out an
octave<00:00:36.170> with<00:00:37.170> overtones<00:00:38.239> you<00:00:39.239> lower<00:00:39.450> the

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
octave with overtones you lower the

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.090 
octave with overtones you lower the
volume<00:00:39.750> of<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.079> guitar<00:00:40.440> that<00:00:40.469> affects<00:00:40.950> the

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
volume of the guitar that affects the

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.760 
volume of the guitar that affects the
sound<00:00:41.309> as<00:00:41.550> well<00:00:41.790> so<00:00:42.750> it's<00:00:42.899> be<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.500> the

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
sound as well so it's be the the

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.350 
sound as well so it's be the the
whatever<00:00:44.070> comes<00:00:44.430> out<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.700> other<00:00:44.789> side<00:00:45.059> is

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
whatever comes out the other side is

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.229 
whatever comes out the other side is
based<00:00:45.600> on<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:46.050> volume<00:00:46.260> and<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:47.640> the

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
based on the volume and the the

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.500 
based on the volume and the the
frequency<00:00:48.780> of<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.680> what's<00:00:50.460> imported<00:00:50.940> you<00:00:51.329> can

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
frequency of the what's imported you can

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.600 
frequency of the what's imported you can
run<00:00:51.719> drum<00:00:52.320> machines<00:00:52.620> through<00:00:52.860> it<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.460> head

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
run drum machines through it the head

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.170 
run drum machines through it the head
there<00:00:54.000> really<00:00:54.600> way<00:00:54.750> out<00:00:55.100> and<00:00:56.100> obviously<00:00:56.789> since

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
there really way out and obviously since

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.910 
there really way out and obviously since
through<00:00:57.480> with<00:00:57.629> anything<00:00:58.170> can<00:00:58.620> put<00:00:58.710> anything

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
through with anything can put anything

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.590 
through with anything can put anything
through<00:00:59.219> it<00:00:59.340> but<00:00:59.489> it's<00:01:00.059> best<00:01:00.300> for<00:01:00.420> a<00:01:00.480> guitar

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:02.600 
through it but it's best for a guitar

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.450 
through it but it's best for a guitar
I'm<00:01:03.600> just<00:01:03.840> I'm<00:01:04.199> just<00:01:04.379> going<00:01:04.559> from<00:01:04.680> going

I'm just I'm just going from going

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:06.710 
I'm just I'm just going from going
straight<00:01:05.700> from<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:05.909> guitar<00:01:06.270> which<00:01:06.570> is<00:01:06.600> a

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
straight from the guitar which is a

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:15.560 
straight from the guitar which is a
Stratocaster<00:01:11.570> velv<00:01:12.570> amp<00:01:14.119> and<00:01:15.119> I'll<00:01:15.240> give<00:01:15.479> you

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
a dry dry signal first I'll just turn

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:34.580 
a dry dry signal first I'll just turn
the<00:01:19.640> turn<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.820> amp<00:01:20.909> up<00:01:21.090> a<00:01:21.210> bit<00:01:33.259> better<00:01:34.259> dry
