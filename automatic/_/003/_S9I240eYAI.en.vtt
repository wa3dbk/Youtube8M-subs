roofing car will have to do for now this
right<00:01:59.020> here<00:01:59.340> you<00:02:00.340> figure<00:02:00.700> out<00:02:00.729> a<00:02:00.789> better<00:02:00.909> way

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
right here you figure out a better way

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:06.359 
right here you figure out a better way
to<00:02:01.179> keep<00:02:01.780> this<00:02:01.959> up<00:02:02.170> but<00:02:02.429> anyhow<00:02:03.539> this<00:02:05.369> will

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:06.369 
to keep this up but anyhow this will
