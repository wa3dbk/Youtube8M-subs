all<00:00:01.620> right<00:00:01.829> in<00:00:02.010> this<00:00:02.129> edition<00:00:02.520> we're<00:00:02.820> gonna<00:00:02.939> be

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:03.210 
all right in this edition we're gonna be

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.269 
all right in this edition we're gonna be
showing<00:00:03.540> you<00:00:03.689> is<00:00:03.840> a<00:00:03.870> quick<00:00:04.140> way<00:00:04.380> to<00:00:04.410> have

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279 
showing you is a quick way to have

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.360 
showing you is a quick way to have
detail<00:00:06.210> morph<00:00:06.810> targets<00:00:07.290> and<00:00:07.500> layers<00:00:08.010> all

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
detail morph targets and layers all

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:09.950 
detail morph targets and layers all
working<00:00:08.849> in<00:00:08.880> conjunction<00:00:09.210> with<00:00:09.570> each<00:00:09.719> other

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
working in conjunction with each other

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.330 
working in conjunction with each other
so<00:00:10.920> what<00:00:11.820> usually<00:00:12.150> do<00:00:12.509> is<00:00:12.840> divide<00:00:13.830> your<00:00:14.009> model

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
so what usually do is divide your model

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.250 
so what usually do is divide your model
up<00:00:14.460> a<00:00:14.610> few<00:00:14.820> times<00:00:16.220> and<00:00:17.570> then<00:00:18.570> make<00:00:18.840> sure<00:00:19.050> you've

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
up a few times and then make sure you've

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.920 
up a few times and then make sure you've
divided<00:00:19.770> it<00:00:20.070> all<00:00:20.250> the<00:00:20.490> way<00:00:20.609> to<00:00:20.640> whatever<00:00:21.420> your

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
divided it all the way to whatever your

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.070 
divided it all the way to whatever your
max<00:00:22.470> Ram<00:00:22.859> can<00:00:23.160> handle<00:00:23.550> so<00:00:24.060> right<00:00:24.510> now<00:00:24.689> I<00:00:24.720> could

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
max Ram can handle so right now I could

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.660 
max Ram can handle so right now I could
probably<00:00:25.199> get<00:00:25.560> away<00:00:25.650> with<00:00:25.769> dividing<00:00:26.430> it<00:00:26.519> one

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
probably get away with dividing it one

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.730 
probably get away with dividing it one
more<00:00:26.880> time<00:00:27.090> but<00:00:27.420> for<00:00:27.660> a<00:00:27.689> quick<00:00:27.869> video<00:00:28.199> purposes

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
more time but for a quick video purposes

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.679 
more time but for a quick video purposes
I'm<00:00:29.070> just<00:00:29.279> gonna<00:00:29.400> leave<00:00:29.640> it<00:00:29.760> right<00:00:29.789> here<00:00:30.210> and

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
I'm just gonna leave it right here and

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.000 
I'm just gonna leave it right here and
I'll<00:00:30.900> say<00:00:31.080> new<00:00:31.349> layer<00:00:32.960> okay<00:00:33.960> and<00:00:34.200> what<00:00:34.770> I<00:00:34.800> can

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
I'll say new layer okay and what I can

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.700 
I'll say new layer okay and what I can
do<00:00:35.130> here<00:00:35.399> is<00:00:35.579> just<00:00:36.570> go<00:00:37.020> into<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:37.350> standard

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
do here is just go into the standard

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.709 
do here is just go into the standard
brush<00:00:37.920> in<00:00:38.250> let's<00:00:38.550> make<00:00:38.790> some<00:00:39.059> pretty<00:00:39.420> fine

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
brush in let's make some pretty fine

00:00:39.719 --> 00:01:04.119 
brush in let's make some pretty fine
details<00:00:40.260> just<00:00:40.829> just<00:00:41.670> ridiculous<00:00:42.360> things

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.129 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:07.370 

some<00:01:05.129> atypical<00:01:05.670> sockets<00:01:06.450> where<00:01:06.690> maybe<00:01:06.960> some

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
some atypical sockets where maybe some

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:24.890 
some atypical sockets where maybe some
pseudo<00:01:08.070> horns<00:01:08.580> would<00:01:08.760> play<00:01:09.030> into<00:01:09.240> effect

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.440 

okay<00:01:25.900> and<00:01:26.890> then<00:01:27.280> maybe<00:01:27.549> I'll<00:01:27.759> add<00:01:27.970> a<00:01:28.000> new<00:01:28.240> layer

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450 
okay and then maybe I'll add a new layer

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.039 
okay and then maybe I'll add a new layer
to<00:01:28.720> it<00:01:28.840> and<00:01:29.400> on<00:01:30.400> this<00:01:30.580> layer<00:01:30.850> you<00:01:31.570> know<00:01:31.689> I<00:01:31.720> would

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:32.049 
to it and on this layer you know I would

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:33.810 
to it and on this layer you know I would
concentrate<00:01:32.500> after<00:01:32.890> I<00:01:33.070> would<00:01:33.310> do<00:01:33.460> all<00:01:33.640> this

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:33.820 
concentrate after I would do all this

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.480 
concentrate after I would do all this
fancy<00:01:34.240> stuff<00:01:34.509> in<00:01:34.960> here<00:01:35.140> I<00:01:35.320> would<00:01:36.040> concentrate

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
fancy stuff in here I would concentrate

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.980 
fancy stuff in here I would concentrate
on<00:01:36.759> maybe<00:01:37.799> using<00:01:38.799> some<00:01:39.009> kind<00:01:39.460> of<00:01:39.670> alpha<00:01:40.479> to

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:40.990 
on maybe using some kind of alpha to

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:51.450 
on maybe using some kind of alpha to
produce<00:01:41.170> some<00:01:41.470> skin<00:01:49.590> turn<00:01:50.590> my<00:01:50.770> radio<00:01:50.920> fall-off

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460 
produce some skin turn my radio fall-off

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.080 
produce some skin turn my radio fall-off
up<00:01:52.500> mi<00:01:53.500> is<00:01:53.560> the<00:01:53.830> intensity<00:01:54.310> all<00:01:54.610> the<00:01:54.759> way<00:01:54.850> down

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
up mi is the intensity all the way down

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:07.840 
up mi is the intensity all the way down
to<00:01:55.360> like<00:01:55.390> six<00:02:00.780> and<00:02:01.780> drag<00:02:02.530> rectangle

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.840 

and<00:02:08.390> symmetry<00:02:09.080> on<00:02:09.200> okay<00:02:10.160> the<00:02:10.310> point<00:02:10.550> here<00:02:10.819> is

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:10.850 
and symmetry on okay the point here is

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:13.449 
and symmetry on okay the point here is
maybe<00:02:11.750> I<00:02:11.870> would<00:02:12.230> just<00:02:12.260> want<00:02:12.650> to<00:02:12.770> go<00:02:12.950> over<00:02:13.340> the

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
maybe I would just want to go over the

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:16.720 
maybe I would just want to go over the
intok<00:02:13.880> of<00:02:14.270> everything<00:02:15.050> and<00:02:15.260> not<00:02:16.040> minding<00:02:16.430> the

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
intok of everything and not minding the

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:26.190 
intok of everything and not minding the
details

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.960 

okay<00:02:27.200> like<00:02:27.500> this<00:02:27.710> stuff<00:02:27.980> right<00:02:28.190> here<00:02:28.250> just

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
okay like this stuff right here just

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.350 
okay like this stuff right here just
gonna<00:02:29.060> go<00:02:29.300> right<00:02:29.540> over<00:02:29.570> the<00:02:29.810> top<00:02:30.020> of<00:02:30.050> it<00:02:31.360> okay

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
gonna go right over the top of it okay

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.470 
gonna go right over the top of it okay
what<00:02:32.510> I<00:02:32.570> can<00:02:32.870> do<00:02:33.020> here<00:02:33.320> is<00:02:33.500> use<00:02:34.280> morph<00:02:34.970> targets

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
what I can do here is use morph targets

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.690 
what I can do here is use morph targets
in<00:02:35.630> conjunction<00:02:36.020> with<00:02:36.230> this<00:02:36.560> so<00:02:37.250> now<00:02:37.280> I<00:02:37.490> have

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
in conjunction with this so now I have

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.350 
in conjunction with this so now I have
it<00:02:37.730> on<00:02:37.910> a<00:02:37.940> layer<00:02:39.130> what<00:02:40.130> I<00:02:40.160> can<00:02:40.370> do<00:02:40.520> is<00:02:40.790> go<00:02:41.210> down

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
it on a layer what I can do is go down

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.360 
it on a layer what I can do is go down
to<00:02:41.420> morph<00:02:41.750> targets<00:02:42.200> turning<00:02:42.950> that<00:02:43.070> layer<00:02:43.250> off

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
to morph targets turning that layer off

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.120 
to morph targets turning that layer off
and<00:02:43.550> store<00:02:44.180> morph<00:02:44.510> target<00:02:44.930> I<00:02:45.110> then<00:02:45.740> can<00:02:45.950> go

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
and store morph target I then can go

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:48.700 
and store morph target I then can go
back<00:02:46.340> up<00:02:46.370> to<00:02:46.790> the<00:02:46.880> layer<00:02:47.060> go<00:02:47.690> like<00:02:47.870> this<00:02:48.110> and

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:48.710 
back up to the layer go like this and

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:55.170 
back up to the layer go like this and
then<00:02:49.280> go<00:02:49.550> to<00:02:49.610> the<00:02:50.000> morphe<00:02:50.240> brush<00:02:53.410> with<00:02:54.410> add-on

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
then go to the morphe brush with add-on

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:05.270 
then go to the morphe brush with add-on
and<00:02:56.180> just<00:02:57.020> brush<00:02:57.590> that<00:02:58.100> stuff<00:02:58.520> out

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:14.130 

you

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.570 

just<00:03:14.830> like<00:03:14.980> that<00:03:16.020> and<00:03:17.020> the<00:03:17.680> same<00:03:17.920> with<00:03:18.160> the

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:18.580 
just like that and the same with the

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:23.840 
just like that and the same with the
head<00:03:18.790> let's<00:03:19.600> say<00:03:19.780> I<00:03:19.810> turn<00:03:20.290> off<00:03:20.440> both<00:03:20.650> of<00:03:20.890> these

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.850 

to<00:03:24.850> leave<00:03:25.060> my<00:03:25.209> morph<00:03:25.450> target<00:03:25.870> now<00:03:26.020> and<00:03:26.260> store<00:03:26.800> a

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:26.860 
to leave my morph target now and store a

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:30.900 
to leave my morph target now and store a
new<00:03:27.130> morph<00:03:27.400> target<00:03:29.069> turn<00:03:30.069> both<00:03:30.340> of<00:03:30.550> these<00:03:30.640> back

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:30.910 
new morph target turn both of these back

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:37.670 
new morph target turn both of these back
on<00:03:31.590> which<00:03:32.590> you<00:03:32.740> can<00:03:32.890> see<00:03:33.100> that<00:03:33.610> it<00:03:33.940> still<00:03:34.360> stays
