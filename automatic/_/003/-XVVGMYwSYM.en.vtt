Devon and in this quick video I'm going
to<00:00:10.559> show<00:00:10.769> you<00:00:10.800> how<00:00:11.130> we've<00:00:11.370> sanded<00:00:11.790> down<00:00:11.849> a

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
to show you how we've sanded down a

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.570 
to show you how we've sanded down a
kitchen<00:00:12.570> worktop<00:00:13.139> which<00:00:13.380> is<00:00:13.530> made<00:00:13.710> of<00:00:13.889> wood

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
kitchen worktop which is made of wood

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.380 
kitchen worktop which is made of wood
and<00:00:14.790> then<00:00:15.360> we<00:00:15.509> apply<00:00:15.870> a<00:00:16.199> kitchen<00:00:16.890> oil<00:00:17.310> on<00:00:17.670> top

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
and then we apply a kitchen oil on top

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.349 
and then we apply a kitchen oil on top
of<00:00:18.630> that<00:00:18.830> to<00:00:19.830> then<00:00:19.980> add<00:00:20.250> the<00:00:20.490> extra<00:00:20.820> protection

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
of that to then add the extra protection

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.120 
of that to then add the extra protection
so<00:00:21.510> we've<00:00:21.779> got<00:00:21.960> a<00:00:21.990> few<00:00:22.199> problems<00:00:22.380> right<00:00:22.890> from

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
so we've got a few problems right from

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.849 
so we've got a few problems right from
the<00:00:23.250> start<00:00:23.490> and<00:00:23.580> that's<00:00:23.699> all<00:00:23.970> this<00:00:24.119> dark

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:24.859 
the start and that's all this dark

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:27.859 
the start and that's all this dark
staining<00:00:25.859> around<00:00:26.189> the<00:00:26.789> wood<00:00:27.000> here<00:00:27.599> you<00:00:27.720> can

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
staining around the wood here you can

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.230 
staining around the wood here you can
see<00:00:28.019> had<00:00:28.289> a<00:00:28.320> little<00:00:28.529> bit<00:00:28.680> of<00:00:28.740> a<00:00:28.800> practice

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:29.240 
see had a little bit of a practice

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.209 
see had a little bit of a practice
already<00:00:30.240> so<00:00:30.900> we<00:00:31.050> know<00:00:31.199> it<00:00:31.320> does<00:00:31.500> come<00:00:31.769> off<00:00:31.800> um

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
already so we know it does come off um

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.220 
already so we know it does come off um
and<00:00:32.880> it<00:00:33.000> does<00:00:33.180> need<00:00:33.360> a<00:00:33.390> fair<00:00:33.660> bit<00:00:33.809> of<00:00:33.840> what<00:00:34.079> to

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
and it does need a fair bit of what to

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.510 
and it does need a fair bit of what to
do<00:00:34.350> that<00:00:34.410> so<00:00:34.739> we're<00:00:34.920> going<00:00:35.010> to<00:00:35.100> use<00:00:35.280> some

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
do that so we're going to use some

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.660 
do that so we're going to use some
different<00:00:36.210> tools<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.660> first<00:00:36.690> ones<00:00:37.110> are

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:37.670 
different tools the first ones are

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:38.780 
different tools the first ones are
Dewalt

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
Dewalt

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.700 
Dewalt
and<00:00:38.910> that's<00:00:39.360> going<00:00:39.510> to<00:00:39.570> have<00:00:39.719> a<00:00:39.750> 40<00:00:40.320> grade

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
and that's going to have a 40 grade

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.220 
and that's going to have a 40 grade
sandpaper<00:00:41.129> on<00:00:41.579> it

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:42.230 
sandpaper on it

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.630 
sandpaper on it
the<00:00:43.230> next<00:00:43.500> one<00:00:43.620> we're<00:00:43.860> going<00:00:43.950> to<00:00:44.010> go<00:00:44.250> down<00:00:44.430> the

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
the next one we're going to go down the

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.139 
the next one we're going to go down the
size<00:00:44.850> in<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.270> makita<00:00:45.600> which<00:00:46.440> is<00:00:46.590> half<00:00:46.829> a

00:00:47.139 --> 00:00:47.149 
size in the makita which is half a

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:49.850 
size in the makita which is half a
sandpaper<00:00:48.149> width<00:00:48.510> and<00:00:48.719> that's<00:00:49.469> going<00:00:49.680> to<00:00:49.739> have

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
sandpaper width and that's going to have

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.279 
sandpaper width and that's going to have
a<00:00:49.890> 60<00:00:50.399> grade<00:00:50.670> sandpaper<00:00:51.000> on<00:00:51.329> it<00:00:51.539> and<00:00:51.750> then<00:00:52.079> for

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
a 60 grade sandpaper on it and then for

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.110 
a 60 grade sandpaper on it and then for
the<00:00:52.410> corners<00:00:52.829> and<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.100> fiddly<00:00:53.430> bits<00:00:53.610> we<00:00:53.910> go<00:00:54.059> to

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
the corners and the fiddly bits we go to

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.389 
the corners and the fiddly bits we go to
a<00:00:54.239> triangular<00:00:54.809> Dewalt<00:00:55.199> again<00:00:55.860> with<00:00:56.010> a<00:00:56.039> 60

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
a triangular Dewalt again with a 60

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.299 
a triangular Dewalt again with a 60
grade<00:00:56.640> and<00:00:56.850> then<00:00:57.270> in<00:00:57.539> between<00:00:57.690> coats<00:00:58.230> I<00:00:58.500> have

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
grade and then in between coats I have

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.740 
grade and then in between coats I have
about<00:00:59.520> four<00:00:59.789> coats<00:00:59.940> until<00:01:00.090> so<00:01:00.359> we're<00:01:00.510> going<00:01:00.600> to

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
about four coats until so we're going to

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.939 
about four coats until so we're going to
go<00:01:00.899> for<00:01:01.199> a<00:01:01.230> 240<00:01:02.219> great<00:01:02.940> finishing<00:01:03.629> paper<00:01:03.890> so<00:01:04.890> to

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
go for a 240 great finishing paper so to

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.920 
go for a 240 great finishing paper so to
get<00:01:05.159> to<00:01:05.309> scale<00:01:05.489> really<00:01:05.640> really<00:01:06.090> smooth<00:01:08.930> so

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
get to scale really really smooth so

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.390 
get to scale really really smooth so
here<00:01:10.110> we<00:01:10.170> go<00:01:10.290> actually<00:01:10.439> sanding<00:01:11.130> it's

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
here we go actually sanding it's

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.950 
here we go actually sanding it's
important<00:01:11.820> to<00:01:11.909> always<00:01:12.030> go<00:01:12.630> in<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:12.840> same

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
important to always go in the same

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.340 
important to always go in the same
direction<00:01:13.409> as<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.400> grain<00:01:14.430> itself<00:01:14.970> as<00:01:15.540> much<00:01:16.110> as

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
direction as the grain itself as much as

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.190 
direction as the grain itself as much as
possible<00:01:16.560> I'll<00:01:17.340> just<00:01:17.729> avoid<00:01:17.909> any<00:01:18.299> scratching

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
possible I'll just avoid any scratching

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.289 
possible I'll just avoid any scratching
and<00:01:19.409> stuff<00:01:19.650> like<00:01:19.799> that<00:01:19.950> and<00:01:20.759> what<00:01:20.970> we<00:01:21.060> want<00:01:21.240> to

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
and stuff like that and what we want to

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.530 
and stuff like that and what we want to
do<00:01:21.420> now<00:01:21.630> is<00:01:21.780> actually<00:01:21.950> remove<00:01:22.950> as<00:01:23.220> much<00:01:23.700> of<00:01:24.060> the

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
do now is actually remove as much of the

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.319 
do now is actually remove as much of the
old<00:01:25.100> varnish<00:01:26.100> or<00:01:26.520> oil<00:01:26.729> as<00:01:27.000> possible<00:01:27.860> so<00:01:29.329> here

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
old varnish or oil as possible so here

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:31.969 
old varnish or oil as possible so here
you<00:01:30.450> can<00:01:30.570> see<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:30.990> old<00:01:31.110> oil<00:01:31.290> actually<00:01:31.740> sitting

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
you can see the old oil actually sitting

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.679 
you can see the old oil actually sitting
on<00:01:32.100> top<00:01:32.220> of<00:01:32.280> it<00:01:32.460> it's<00:01:32.579> already<00:01:32.820> got<00:01:33.060> marks<00:01:33.479> and

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
on top of it it's already got marks and

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.480 
on top of it it's already got marks and
stuff<00:01:33.750> on<00:01:34.049> it<00:01:34.229> and<00:01:34.409> then<00:01:34.829> this<00:01:34.979> is<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.250> section

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
stuff on it and then this is the section

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.399 
stuff on it and then this is the section
that<00:01:35.759> we've<00:01:35.909> already<00:01:36.119> sanded<00:01:36.630> now<00:01:36.990> as<00:01:37.140> it<00:01:37.290> was

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
that we've already sanded now as it was

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.319 
that we've already sanded now as it was
we<00:01:37.560> didn't<00:01:37.770> need<00:01:37.860> to<00:01:38.009> use<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.490> 40<00:01:38.850> grit<00:01:39.090> on

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
we didn't need to use the 40 grit on

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.270 
we didn't need to use the 40 grit on
most<00:01:39.780> of<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.049> areas<00:01:40.409> which<00:01:40.860> is<00:01:41.009> good<00:01:41.189> because

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
most of the areas which is good because

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.679 
most of the areas which is good because
it<00:01:41.430> would<00:01:41.549> have<00:01:41.610> scratched<00:01:41.909> it<00:01:42.150> a<00:01:42.210> little<00:01:42.450> bit

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
it would have scratched it a little bit

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.120 
it would have scratched it a little bit
so<00:01:42.810> it<00:01:42.899> would<00:01:43.020> have<00:01:43.170> needed<00:01:43.320> more<00:01:43.619> work<00:01:43.829> to

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
so it would have needed more work to

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.210 
so it would have needed more work to
improve<00:01:44.430> it<00:01:44.729> but<00:01:45.299> just<00:01:45.840> by<00:01:46.049> using<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.590> 60<00:01:47.009> grit

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
improve it but just by using the 60 grit

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.010 
improve it but just by using the 60 grit
with<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.579> power<00:01:47.790> Sanders<00:01:48.329> we've<00:01:48.720> managed<00:01:48.990> to

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
with the power Sanders we've managed to

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.700 
with the power Sanders we've managed to
remove<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.619> old<00:01:49.770> oil<00:01:50.189> or<00:01:50.549> varnish<00:01:51.060> and<00:01:51.869> we're

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
remove the old oil or varnish and we're

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.679 
remove the old oil or varnish and we're
starting<00:01:53.220> to<00:01:53.399> get<00:01:53.520> a<00:01:53.579> really<00:01:53.820> good<00:01:54.119> finish

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
starting to get a really good finish

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.980 
starting to get a really good finish
now<00:01:54.990> those<00:01:55.229> areas<00:01:55.710> that<00:01:55.950> had<00:01:56.130> all<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.430> black

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
now those areas that had all the black

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.959 
now those areas that had all the black
staining<00:01:57.990> on<00:01:58.409> we've<00:01:58.890> had<00:01:59.040> to<00:01:59.130> take<00:01:59.340> about<00:01:59.640> I

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
staining on we've had to take about I

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.090 
staining on we've had to take about I
would<00:02:00.119> say<00:02:00.210> two<00:02:00.420> or<00:02:00.780> three<00:02:01.020> mil<00:02:01.320> off<00:02:01.619> the<00:02:01.950> whole

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
would say two or three mil off the whole

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.440 
would say two or three mil off the whole
of<00:02:02.250> that<00:02:02.280> wood<00:02:03.560> now<00:02:04.729> once<00:02:05.729> we've<00:02:05.939> achieved<00:02:06.030> all

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
of that wood now once we've achieved all

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.570 
of that wood now once we've achieved all
the<00:02:06.780> sanding<00:02:07.380> I've<00:02:07.619> then<00:02:07.950> gone<00:02:08.099> around<00:02:08.340> with

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
the sanding I've then gone around with

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.639 
the sanding I've then gone around with
some<00:02:08.759> water<00:02:09.000> and<00:02:09.420> we'll<00:02:09.810> just<00:02:10.020> cleaned<00:02:10.349> it<00:02:10.500> all

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
some water and we'll just cleaned it all

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.370 
some water and we'll just cleaned it all
off<00:02:10.830> and<00:02:11.069> what<00:02:11.220> this<00:02:11.340> does<00:02:11.580> is<00:02:11.730> it

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
off and what this does is it

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.170 
off and what this does is it
Exce<00:02:12.590> what<00:02:13.070> it<00:02:13.160> would<00:02:13.370> look<00:02:13.550> like<00:02:13.610> with<00:02:14.030> the

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
Exce what it would look like with the

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.140 
Exce what it would look like with the
oil<00:02:14.420> on<00:02:14.890> then<00:02:15.890> we<00:02:16.010> can<00:02:16.160> see<00:02:16.370> if<00:02:16.400> any<00:02:16.610> areas

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
oil on then we can see if any areas

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.470 
oil on then we can see if any areas
having<00:02:17.800> you<00:02:18.800> know<00:02:18.920> do<00:02:19.250> need<00:02:19.490> more<00:02:19.790> work<00:02:20.060> as<00:02:20.360> you

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
having you know do need more work as you

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:21.880 
having you know do need more work as you
can<00:02:20.600> see<00:02:20.780> it's<00:02:20.900> looking<00:02:21.020> pretty<00:02:21.380> good<00:02:21.530> and

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
can see it's looking pretty good and

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.440 
can see it's looking pretty good and
then<00:02:22.280> if<00:02:22.400> it<00:02:22.520> does<00:02:22.670> need<00:02:22.820> more<00:02:22.940> what<00:02:23.150> we<00:02:23.330> can

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
then if it does need more what we can

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.690 
then if it does need more what we can
carry<00:02:23.720> on<00:02:23.930> sanding<00:02:24.530> as<00:02:24.680> it<00:02:25.010> was<00:02:25.190> this<00:02:25.400> is<00:02:25.550> all

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
carry on sanding as it was this is all

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.550 
carry on sanding as it was this is all
looking<00:02:26.030> pretty<00:02:26.090> good<00:02:26.510> with<00:02:26.570> with<00:02:27.260> the<00:02:27.380> water

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
looking pretty good with with the water

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.010 
looking pretty good with with the water
so<00:02:27.860> we're<00:02:28.010> now<00:02:28.160> let<00:02:28.430> this<00:02:28.610> dry<00:02:28.970> out<00:02:29.330> and<00:02:29.600> then

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
so we're now let this dry out and then

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:31.840 
so we're now let this dry out and then
we'll<00:02:30.200> move<00:02:30.350> on<00:02:30.590> to<00:02:30.620> the<00:02:30.830> actual<00:02:31.130> applying<00:02:31.610> the

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:31.850 
we'll move on to the actual applying the

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:36.430 
we'll move on to the actual applying the
oil<00:02:34.240> so<00:02:35.240> first<00:02:35.540> of<00:02:35.720> what<00:02:36.020> we're<00:02:36.140> going<00:02:36.230> to<00:02:36.290> do

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
oil so first of what we're going to do

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.340 
oil so first of what we're going to do
is<00:02:36.620> just<00:02:37.070> go<00:02:37.220> around<00:02:37.310> with<00:02:37.580> the<00:02:37.900> 240<00:02:38.900> just<00:02:39.200> to

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350 
is just go around with the 240 just to

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:41.920 
is just go around with the 240 just to
remove<00:02:39.740> any<00:02:40.520> scratches<00:02:41.150> and<00:02:41.390> then<00:02:41.540> dust<00:02:41.780> it

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
remove any scratches and then dust it

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.230 
remove any scratches and then dust it
all<00:02:42.020> off<00:02:42.200> and<00:02:42.440> use<00:02:42.710> a<00:02:43.130> zero<00:02:43.520> Hoover<00:02:43.880> to<00:02:44.090> hoove

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:44.240 
all off and use a zero Hoover to hoove

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.570 
all off and use a zero Hoover to hoove
off<00:02:44.390> the<00:02:44.510> dust<00:02:44.720> and<00:02:44.990> then<00:02:45.470> we<00:02:45.620> use<00:02:45.830> in<00:02:46.040> this<00:02:46.220> oil

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
off the dust and then we use in this oil

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.500 
off the dust and then we use in this oil
from<00:02:47.030> LeBron<00:02:47.780> it's<00:02:48.200> a<00:02:48.800> proper<00:02:49.640> worktop<00:02:50.240> oil

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
from LeBron it's a proper worktop oil

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.990 
from LeBron it's a proper worktop oil
it's<00:02:51.020> water-based<00:02:51.560> and<00:02:52.100> I'm<00:02:52.250> just<00:02:52.490> using<00:02:52.760> a

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
it's water-based and I'm just using a

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.030 
it's water-based and I'm just using a
brand<00:02:53.330> new<00:02:53.540> brush<00:02:53.840> and<00:02:54.140> would<00:02:54.470> be<00:02:54.590> nice<00:02:54.770> if<00:02:54.920> I'd

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
brand new brush and would be nice if I'd

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.400 
brand new brush and would be nice if I'd
a<00:02:55.070> bigger<00:02:55.640> size<00:02:55.940> new<00:02:56.510> brush<00:02:56.810> in<00:02:56.930> the<00:02:57.020> vamp<00:02:57.230> I

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
a bigger size new brush in the vamp I

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.100 
a bigger size new brush in the vamp I
didn't<00:02:57.710> this<00:02:58.490> brush<00:02:58.670> is<00:02:58.790> actually<00:02:58.910> a<00:02:59.360> really

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
didn't this brush is actually a really

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:03.310 
didn't this brush is actually a really
good<00:03:00.290> brush<00:03:00.530> for<00:03:00.830> it<00:03:00.980> it's<00:03:01.160> from<00:03:01.490> the<00:03:02.320> Picasso

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:03.320 
good brush for it it's from the Picasso

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:04.840 
good brush for it it's from the Picasso
range<00:03:03.590> so<00:03:03.950> check<00:03:04.160> them<00:03:04.310> out<00:03:04.400> if<00:03:04.580> you<00:03:04.700> haven't

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
range so check them out if you haven't

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:06.850 
range so check them out if you haven't
used<00:03:05.120> them<00:03:05.240> before<00:03:05.660> and<00:03:05.870> all<00:03:06.350> we're<00:03:06.530> doing<00:03:06.770> is

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
used them before and all we're doing is

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:10.060 
used them before and all we're doing is
we're<00:03:07.040> applying<00:03:07.250> it<00:03:07.670> not<00:03:08.510> too<00:03:08.720> thickly<00:03:08.960> in<00:03:09.740> all

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:10.070 
we're applying it not too thickly in all

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:11.830 
we're applying it not too thickly in all
directions<00:03:10.370> so<00:03:10.850> it<00:03:11.180> gets<00:03:11.330> a<00:03:11.420> really<00:03:11.690> good

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
directions so it gets a really good

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.660 
directions so it gets a really good
coverage<00:03:12.140> and<00:03:12.320> then<00:03:12.500> laying<00:03:12.770> off<00:03:13.040> again<00:03:13.490> the

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 
coverage and then laying off again the

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:16.360 
coverage and then laying off again the
same<00:03:13.940> direction<00:03:14.390> as<00:03:14.870> the<00:03:15.530> wood<00:03:15.710> grain<00:03:15.950> itself

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
same direction as the wood grain itself

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:19.240 
same direction as the wood grain itself
now<00:03:17.000> this<00:03:17.180> will<00:03:17.360> dry<00:03:17.630> in<00:03:18.620> about<00:03:18.770> three<00:03:19.220> hours

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
now this will dry in about three hours

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.330 
now this will dry in about three hours
or<00:03:19.670> so<00:03:19.700> and<00:03:20.030> then<00:03:20.480> we<00:03:20.630> apply<00:03:20.930> another<00:03:21.260> coat<00:03:21.530> and

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
or so and then we apply another coat and

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.120 
or so and then we apply another coat and
in<00:03:22.850> total<00:03:23.420> this<00:03:24.050> work<00:03:24.320> top<00:03:24.530> will<00:03:24.680> have<00:03:24.800> four

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
in total this work top will have four

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:26.770 
in total this work top will have four
coats<00:03:25.430> but<00:03:25.700> we're<00:03:25.970> going<00:03:26.090> to<00:03:26.150> leave<00:03:26.270> it<00:03:26.390> 24

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
coats but we're going to leave it 24

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.750 
coats but we're going to leave it 24
hours<00:03:26.840> before<00:03:27.410> it<00:03:27.470> has<00:03:27.560> its<00:03:27.740> final<00:03:27.890> coat<00:03:28.250> just

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
hours before it has its final coat just

as you can see this is just the first
coat<00:03:44.720> now<00:03:44.870> so<00:03:45.080> it'll<00:03:45.560> need<00:03:45.830> another<00:03:46.160> three

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
coat now so it'll need another three

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.460 
coat now so it'll need another three
coats<00:03:46.640> on<00:03:46.820> top<00:03:47.030> and<00:03:47.870> you<00:03:47.959> see<00:03:48.110> it's<00:03:48.260> still

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
coats on top and you see it's still

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:50.050 
coats on top and you see it's still
drying<00:03:48.800> out<00:03:49.040> a<00:03:49.070> little<00:03:49.250> bit<00:03:49.459> in<00:03:49.520> some<00:03:49.670> areas

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
drying out a little bit in some areas

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.180 
drying out a little bit in some areas
but<00:03:50.570> it's<00:03:50.810> leaving<00:03:50.990> a<00:03:51.110> really<00:03:51.560> nice<00:03:51.740> finish

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:52.190 
but it's leaving a really nice finish

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:54.480 
but it's leaving a really nice finish
and<00:03:52.220> that<00:03:52.550> will<00:03:52.640> drive<00:03:52.880> back<00:03:53.090> to<00:03:53.420> really

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:54.490 
and that will drive back to really

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:57.370 
and that will drive back to really
really<00:03:55.490> good<00:03:55.730> finish<00:03:55.940> and<00:03:56.060> a<00:03:56.240> really<00:03:56.570> good
