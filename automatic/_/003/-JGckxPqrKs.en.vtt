00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:10.410
 the fiat 500 to his muscular version he 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.210
 this is the abarth 500 since the year 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.500
 last apart declines the 500 in two 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.609
 other custom versions 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:19.140
 the 595 turismo and competed besides 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.369
 their specific badge these versions get 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.890
 do not recognize their alloy wheels 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.230
 17 inches their front lights bi-xenon a 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.570
 modified grille and on the competition 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.380
 a sports exhaust associated with four 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.560
 exhaust outlets 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.960
 just that to finish the 595 poster 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:37.710
 all 260 horses or 20 more than the 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.000
 simple abarth 500 inside the 595 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.739
 competes is entitled to seats 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.660
 bucket with good lateral support 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.789
 they are here covered with leather and 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.440
 alcantara optional dashboard 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.670
 to care specific packing but one 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.770
 finds of course the environment of the 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.480
 fiat 500 with in addition to the left of the 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.550
 storyteller a turbo pressure gauge 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.129
 associated with a shift indicator that light up 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.510
 at the breaker nice but this word but very 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.340
 partially hidden by the joystick 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.510
 flashing rear seats are 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.820
 identical to those of a 500 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.500
 that is to say, similarly narrow for the kof 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.570
 which still reaches 100 86 of the six 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.460
 cubic meters 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.200
 the small alecka turbo and its 160 horses 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.979
 which no harm pulling the ton from this 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.170
 little abarth 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.570
 what to accelerate so strongly 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.890
 that the front axle has difficulty in motor skills 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.400
 the sound worked is rather 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.200
 pleasant 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.670
 including at the deceleration where we hear 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.500
 sometimes a few gurgling itchy 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.000
 big cars but the fact 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.560
 marking this bodybuilder chip comes 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.420
 of its extremely stiff chassis 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.950
 perfect for a smooth bitumen but at the 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.540
 least hump the car becomes very 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.490
 appreciated what a rank loss of grip 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.470
 far too fast in relaxation without 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.470
 talk about the comfort of almost suspension 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.729
 non-existent small bombinette stuffed with 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.380
 anabolic this abarth can in 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.850
 theory rub in performance at 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.009
 Sportsmen of the higher category 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.869
 like the clio rs or the 208 gti 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.340
 in theory only because it turns out 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.420
 much less efficient on chassis and 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.340
 on small roads 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.990
 and then this abarth known in all 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.579
 auto newsroom as a model of a 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.409
 comfort shows up pretty well 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.570
 hard to live with every day except 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.890
 to have a friend who does not prevent 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.450
 this abarth still has sides 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.070
 endearing like that scrambles or the 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.479
 exhaust sound but it does 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.479
 pay too much for his attractions 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.790
 no 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.790
