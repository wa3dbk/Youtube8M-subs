and<00:00:49.170> flat<00:00:49.469> like<00:00:49.770> us<00:00:49.950> sure<00:00:50.700> they<00:00:50.910> would<00:00:51.090> the

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
and flat like us sure they would the

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.930 
and flat like us sure they would the
next<00:00:52.199> step<00:00:52.469> is<00:00:52.649> organization<00:00:53.489> which<00:00:53.670> really

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
next step is organization which really

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.090 
next step is organization which really
just<00:00:54.090> means<00:00:54.420> how<00:00:54.989> you<00:00:55.020> put<00:00:55.440> your<00:00:55.590> ideas
