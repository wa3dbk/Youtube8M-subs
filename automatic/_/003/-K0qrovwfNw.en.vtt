casualty recovery yet these terminators
would<00:02:08.849> easily<00:02:09.090> be<00:02:09.420> the<00:02:09.780> most<00:02:09.929> effective

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
would easily be the most effective

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.380 
would easily be the most effective
weapon<00:02:10.619> against<00:02:11.009> civil<00:02:11.340> unrest<00:02:11.430> or<00:02:11.910> radical

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
weapon against civil unrest or radical

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.970 
weapon against civil unrest or radical
revolutionaries<00:02:13.080> that<00:02:13.230> did<00:02:13.440> not<00:02:13.560> subscribe

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
revolutionaries that did not subscribe

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.839 
revolutionaries that did not subscribe
to<00:02:14.160> the<00:02:14.400> globalist<00:02:15.150> agenda<00:02:16.220> okay<00:02:17.220> I<00:02:17.400> find<00:02:17.760> that

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849 
to the globalist agenda okay I find that

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:19.820 
to the globalist agenda okay I find that
very<00:02:17.910> odd<00:02:18.209> that<00:02:18.390> that<00:02:18.569> would<00:02:18.720> be<00:02:18.870> you<00:02:19.230> know<00:02:19.349> all

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
very odd that that would be you know all

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.309 
very odd that that would be you know all
out<00:02:20.519> there<00:02:20.910> and<00:02:21.120> it<00:02:21.690> definitely<00:02:21.900> gives<00:02:22.170> you

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
out there and it definitely gives you

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:27.259 
out there and it definitely gives you
something<00:02:22.560> to<00:02:22.709> think<00:02:22.799> about<00:02:25.910> let's<00:02:26.910> just<00:02:27.000> look

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
something to think about let's just look

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:30.589 
something to think about let's just look
over<00:02:27.450> here<00:02:27.690> at<00:02:27.810> this<00:02:28.970> let's<00:02:29.970> run<00:02:30.180> this<00:02:30.390> right

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:30.599 
over here at this let's run this right

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:33.979 
over here at this let's run this right

here but I mean you I'll try and give
the<00:02:34.700> the<00:02:35.700> website<00:02:36.150> address<00:02:37.640> and<00:02:39.680> the

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
the the website address and the

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.940 
the the website address and the
possibilities<00:02:42.450> here<00:02:42.750> are<00:02:42.870> limitless<00:02:43.170> also<00:02:43.709> if

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
they you know if they perfect this and

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.140 
they you know if they perfect this and
these<00:02:46.950> things<00:02:47.310> can<00:02:47.519> do<00:02:47.640> what<00:02:47.790> they're<00:02:47.910> doing

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
these things can do what they're doing

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.620 
these things can do what they're doing
out<00:02:48.239> here<00:02:48.360> they<00:02:48.540> could<00:02:48.750> you<00:02:48.959> know<00:02:50.420> totally<00:02:51.420> get

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
out here they could you know totally get

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.699 
out here they could you know totally get
rid<00:02:51.810> of<00:02:51.860> firefighting<00:02:52.860> Anna<00:02:53.959> you<00:02:54.959> could<00:02:55.170> you

daily and ask yourself that this machine

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.740 
daily and ask yourself that this machine
could<00:03:09.780> be<00:03:09.840> programmed<00:03:10.380> to<00:03:10.470> do<00:03:10.650> it<00:03:10.799> and<00:03:11.760> you

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
could be programmed to do it and you

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.979 
could be programmed to do it and you
know<00:03:12.840> from<00:03:13.049> an<00:03:13.170> employer<00:03:13.500> standpoint<00:03:14.989> you

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.589 
here that is never going to take a
coffee<00:03:20.340> break<00:03:20.519> and<00:03:22.310> is<00:03:23.310> no<00:03:23.700> complaining<00:03:24.389> and

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:29.050 
coffee break and is no complaining and
I'll<00:03:24.810> do<00:03:24.900> everything<00:03:25.049> you<00:03:25.470> ask<00:03:25.500> it<00:03:25.829> to<00:03:25.859> do<00:03:26.099> so

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.059 

it's<00:03:30.060> it's<00:03:30.540> really<00:03:30.959> kind<00:03:31.200> of<00:03:31.290> a<00:03:31.410> radical<00:03:31.590> thing

00:03:32.059 --> 00:03:32.069 
it's it's really kind of a radical thing

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:34.339 
it's it's really kind of a radical thing
and<00:03:32.280> I<00:03:32.400> remember<00:03:33.030> reading<00:03:33.239> about<00:03:33.569> this<00:03:34.079> back

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:34.349 
and I remember reading about this back

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:36.759 
and I remember reading about this back
in<00:03:34.560> the<00:03:34.650> 90s<00:03:35.099> i<00:03:35.220> think<00:03:35.400> it<00:03:35.459> was<00:03:35.549> in<00:03:35.609> 93<00:03:36.150> or<00:03:36.269> 94

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:36.769 
in the 90s i think it was in 93 or 94

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:39.650 
in the 90s i think it was in 93 or 94
the<00:03:37.769> military<00:03:38.310> was<00:03:38.760> working<00:03:39.150> on<00:03:39.239> robots

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
the military was working on robots

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.289 
the military was working on robots
capable<00:03:40.139> of<00:03:40.590> running<00:03:40.829> and<00:03:41.220> jumping<00:03:41.639> and<00:03:42.030> they

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:42.299 
capable of running and jumping and they

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:43.940 
capable of running and jumping and they
said<00:03:42.540> within<00:03:42.690> 30<00:03:43.079> years<00:03:43.410> they<00:03:43.620> would<00:03:43.769> have<00:03:43.919> it

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
said within 30 years they would have it

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:45.470 
said within 30 years they would have it
well<00:03:44.250> i<00:03:44.280> guess<00:03:44.519> to<00:03:44.700> running<00:03:45.030> a<00:03:45.090> little<00:03:45.269> bit

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
well i guess to running a little bit

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.729 
well i guess to running a little bit
early<00:03:45.810> so<00:03:46.849> I<00:03:48.200> just<00:03:49.200> thought<00:03:49.349> I<00:03:49.410> would<00:03:49.620> bring

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
early so I just thought I would bring

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:53.599 
early so I just thought I would bring
this<00:03:49.950> to<00:03:50.099> everyone's<00:03:50.400> attention<00:03:50.730> and<00:03:51.739> a<00:03:52.739> few

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:53.609 
this to everyone's attention and a few

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:59.339 
this to everyone's attention and a few
points<00:03:54.120> I<00:03:54.650> want<00:03:55.650> to<00:03:55.680> make<00:03:56.150> is

00:03:59.339 --> 00:03:59.349 

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:02.949 

if<00:04:00.349> you<00:04:00.709> were<00:04:00.830> to<00:04:00.950> confront<00:04:01.400> this<00:04:01.519> guy<00:04:01.959> right

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:02.959 
if you were to confront this guy right

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:08.320 
if you were to confront this guy right
here<00:04:03.019> I<00:04:03.970> really<00:04:04.970> don't<00:04:05.150> think<00:04:06.069> that<00:04:07.330> this

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:08.330 
here I really don't think that this

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:09.460 
here I really don't think that this
right<00:04:08.569> here<00:04:08.720> is<00:04:08.750> going<00:04:08.930> to<00:04:09.050> do<00:04:09.140> it<00:04:09.260> don't<00:04:09.319> know

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:09.470 
right here is going to do it don't know

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:10.920 
right here is going to do it don't know
if<00:04:09.530> you<00:04:09.620> can<00:04:09.709> see<00:04:09.860> that<00:04:09.890> but<00:04:10.129> that's<00:04:10.310> green<00:04:10.550> tip

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:10.930 
if you can see that but that's green tip

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:13.240 
if you can see that but that's green tip
556<00:04:11.930> I<00:04:12.200> don't<00:04:12.530> think<00:04:12.680> that's<00:04:12.769> going<00:04:12.950> to<00:04:13.010> do<00:04:13.129> the

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.250 
556 I don't think that's going to do the

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:15.160 
556 I don't think that's going to do the
job<00:04:13.459> against<00:04:13.849> him<00:04:14.000> I<00:04:14.209> think<00:04:14.870> you're<00:04:14.989> going<00:04:15.110> to

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:15.170 
job against him I think you're going to

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:17.680 
job against him I think you're going to
need<00:04:15.290> something<00:04:15.650> a<00:04:15.680> little<00:04:15.799> heavier<00:04:16.690> probably

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 
need something a little heavier probably

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:21.729 
need something a little heavier probably
something<00:04:17.870> that<00:04:18.079> has<00:04:18.169> a<00:04:18.199> black<00:04:18.500> tip<00:04:18.799> on<00:04:19.010> it<00:04:20.739> and

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:21.739 
something that has a black tip on it and
