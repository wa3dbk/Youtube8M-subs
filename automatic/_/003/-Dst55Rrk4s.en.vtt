00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.100 
Pig Tronics and the Super Comp from nxr
we're<00:00:25.460> gonna<00:00:25.550> start<00:00:25.970> over<00:00:26.330> here<00:00:26.720> with<00:00:26.870> the

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:27.110 
we're gonna start over here with the

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:29.740 
we're gonna start over here with the
Super<00:00:27.440> Comp<00:00:27.590> first<00:00:27.970> the<00:00:28.970> Super<00:00:29.300> Comp<00:00:29.450> is

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:29.750 
Super Comp first the Super Comp is

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:32.770 
Super Comp first the Super Comp is
basically<00:00:30.470> the<00:00:31.250> classic<00:00:32.180> Dinah<00:00:32.450> comp

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:32.780 
basically the classic Dinah comp

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.690 
basically the classic Dinah comp
compressor<00:00:33.379> from<00:00:33.530> mxr<00:00:34.270> with<00:00:35.270> one<00:00:36.110> extra<00:00:36.350> knob

so<00:00:38.170> here<00:00:39.170> you<00:00:39.320> have<00:00:39.470> output<00:00:40.010> attack<00:00:40.700> and

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:41.000 
so here you have output attack and

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.860 
so here you have output attack and
sensitivity<00:00:41.870> and<00:00:42.280> it's<00:00:43.280> a<00:00:43.340> very<00:00:43.550> basic

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:43.870

over<00:01:28.560> to<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:28.829> philosophers<00:01:29.549> tone<00:01:29.789> now<00:01:29.999> this

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
over to the philosophers tone now this

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.669 
over to the philosophers tone now this
compressor<00:01:30.719> pedal<00:01:30.990> is<00:01:31.049> a<00:01:31.109> little<00:01:31.319> different

00:01:31.669 --> 00:01:31.679 
compressor pedal is a little different

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:33.200 
compressor pedal is a little different
because<00:01:31.740> it's<00:01:32.009> not<00:01:32.130> just<00:01:32.429> a<00:01:32.490> compressor<00:01:32.939> pedal

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
because it's not just a compressor pedal

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.469 
because it's not just a compressor pedal
it<00:01:33.600> also<00:01:34.289> has<00:01:36.109> an<00:01:37.109> overdrive<00:01:37.590> built<00:01:38.039> into<00:01:38.340> it

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
it also has an overdrive built into it

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:41.139 
it also has an overdrive built into it
so<00:01:39.479> you<00:01:39.509> can<00:01:39.840> see<00:01:39.990> here<00:01:40.200> there's<00:01:40.380> a<00:01:40.439> bunch<00:01:40.829> of

00:01:41.139 --> 00:01:41.149 
so you can see here there's a bunch of

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:44.779 
so you can see here there's a bunch of
controls<00:01:42.149> you've<00:01:42.359> got<00:01:42.539> volume<00:01:43.789> treble

00:01:44.779 --> 00:01:44.789 
controls you've got volume treble

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:48.469 
controls you've got volume treble
control<00:01:45.539> a<00:01:45.780> blend<00:01:46.140> control<00:01:46.649> sustain<00:01:47.369> and<00:01:47.700> grit

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
control a blend control sustain and grit

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.050 
control a blend control sustain and grit
which<00:01:48.689> controls<00:01:49.079> the<00:01:49.200> overdrive<00:01:49.679> so<00:01:50.520> I'm

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
which controls the overdrive so I'm

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.429 
which controls the overdrive so I'm
gonna<00:01:51.179> leave<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:51.539> grit<00:01:51.689> all<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:51.959> way<00:01:52.049> down<00:01:52.229> so

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
gonna leave the grit all the way down so

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:53.209 
gonna leave the grit all the way down so
we're<00:01:52.530> just<00:01:52.560> gonna<00:01:52.740> hear<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:52.979> compressor

00:01:53.209 --> 00:01:53.219 
we're just gonna hear the compressor

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:55.190 
we're just gonna hear the compressor
first<00:01:53.700> and<00:01:53.880> for<00:01:54.030> all<00:01:54.119> of<00:01:54.149> these<00:01:54.420> sounds<00:01:55.079> I'm

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
first and for all of these sounds I'm

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.179 
first and for all of these sounds I'm
using<00:01:56.039> the<00:01:56.369> second<00:01:57.030> position<00:01:57.479> the<00:01:57.920> neck<00:01:58.920> and

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
using the second position the neck and

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.279 
using the second position the neck and
middle<00:01:59.429> pickup<00:01:59.879> split<00:02:00.329> because<00:02:00.450> I<00:02:00.780> kind<00:02:01.170> of

00:02:01.279 --> 00:02:01.289 
middle pickup split because I kind of

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:03.020 
middle pickup split because I kind of
think<00:02:01.649> that<00:02:01.770> you<00:02:02.219> can<00:02:02.369> hear<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:02.759> compressor

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
think that you can hear the compressor

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.639 
think that you can hear the compressor
and<00:02:03.539> the<00:02:03.899> characteristics<00:02:04.469> of<00:02:04.590> the

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
and the characteristics of the

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.039 
and the characteristics of the
compressor<00:02:05.099> the<00:02:05.219> best<00:02:05.459> in<00:02:05.700> that<00:02:05.849> position<00:02:06.049> so

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
compressor the best in that position so

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.810 
compressor the best in that position so
here<00:02:07.649> we<00:02:07.739> go
