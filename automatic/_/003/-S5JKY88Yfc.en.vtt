00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:52.350
 birth my life has elapsed between 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.390
 good things and bad things many of 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.330
 they were bad few were the 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.490
 good and not my parents did not torture me 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:01.800
 as a child, but I tortured myself 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:03.720
 myself since I was little I always felt 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.780
 much loneliness loneliness that up many 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:08.970
 you know what I'm referring to 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.920
 shyness my life did not fit in those 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.320
 times I was just going to school and not 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.270
 I was chatting with nobody so I just sat 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.490
 on a school bench and watched 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.619
 the other children playing in the garden or in 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.990
 the kindergarten I have not made any friends 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.460
 cause of my shyness but only one day 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.950
 in which I made the same routine 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.200
 Always a guy of my height is 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.320
 He approached me like he did not talk so much 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.909
 I just said hello and I was silent the 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.590
 same guy was the one who made me 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.569
 come to your senses when he told me 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.939
 how many things that I consider 

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:40.799
 friendship he had invited me to play 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.990
 the ball and other friends that had 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.090
 fact was the first time I did not 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.789
 I felt so lonely but I felt 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.189
 comforted and full of joy passed 

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:52.679
 years and years I was growing and shyness 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.689
 also though I had my friend near the 

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:57.390
 shyness always won and it was put in 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.700
 against me at age 12 I made my 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.500
 first party or rather I went to a 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.229
 party that some of my 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.239
 friends if it is during the passage of the 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.700
 I've made friends and even better 

00:02:06.239 --> 00:02:11.700
 friends that today being where 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.530
 I remember nostalgically was 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.660
 very late and at that time I was 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.030
 devastated by so much dancing just 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.799
 I wanted to relax and rest, I think 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.959
 it was mere chance or rather 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:24.510
 said chance when a new one came out 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:26.190
 my little pony program in those moments 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.010
 sacred I was what you could call 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:31.049
 a macho was an unbeliever in those 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.390
 moments towards what the others were doing 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:36.030
 although I knew what I had to do 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:38.880
 put or not just reject it but 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.870
 until a year ago it was November 28, 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.299
 2012 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.430
 found on youtube parody of this 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:46.680
 series of ponies I had loved the 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.420
 see them although I kept thinking that only 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.790
 it was for girls and not for boys 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.040
 every time I saw that parody always 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.920
 I wanted to know who were disks pink and 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:58.560
 ep reuters and rainbow das among the others 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.540
 ponies the love of the series was born when 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.120
 I lost what I loved the most and I still love 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.980
 the present to my grandmother for me she was 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.590
 like my second half of the person who 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.870
 I'm now she was like my mom I'm still 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.790
 remembering the words she said the 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.310
 cancer will not stop me to continue 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:17.010
 seeing my grandchildren I think that even 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:19.140
 I keep remembering those words but their 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.329
 words unfortunately could not be 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:23.670
 meet her died by having her mouth 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:25.500
 infected or how they told me to eat 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.629
 it was impossible for her to 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.700
 swallow it hurt too much though 

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:33.450
 doctors wanted to help her she did not 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:36.060
 he wanted so he just gave his last breath and 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:38.220
 He died I could not be with her 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.319
 When I needed it most, I was in my 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.629
 house playing computer in those 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:44.819
 moments of such intense pain and anguish 

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:46.470
 the only thing I could do is load the 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:48.870
 coffin where my grandmother 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.790
 take her to the cemetery I felt good 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.650
 with myself is what at least 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:55.020
 I could do for her having been 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:57.600
 put on the computer that day brings me out 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:59.490
 I'm crazy even though I'm still 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.140
 knowing that there are people on the internet who 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:03.450
 supports you and makes you get ahead 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:05.490
 makes you feel happy maybe it was the pain and 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:07.590
 the anguish over the loss of my grandmother 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:09.840
 but what I will take into consideration is 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.550
 that my little pony was one of the things 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.770
 that made me look beyond the 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:15.450
 friendship how important it is to know 

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:17.190
 that what you have around you was 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:19.440
 question was yours and what you accomplished and 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:21.540
 being shy I know that the story is 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:23.550
 long to answer this question from 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:25.230
 public but I had to let out what 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:27.540
 that was once what I left in a 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:29.310
 depressive state today I continue 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:31.560
 living with my grandmother in mind 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:33.390
 sometimes I cry for her but other times 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:35.820
 I say to myself a being that you have 

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:38.550
 lost months ago is something very painful 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:40.530
 but you have to go ahead cost 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:42.419
 what has to cost you have to leave 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:44.400
 go ahead because life brings you those 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:46.590
 best gifts you could not wait 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:49.020
 receiving that is what I always say to myself 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:51.450
 when I think about it you already know 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:53.070
 the answer now you have to choose what 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:55.080
 is what they will want for good 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:57.480
 and be a happy lover of a caricature 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:59.430
 and live with the happiness you need or 

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:01.590
 remain the person that once 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:02.430
 you were and will be if you are still buried in 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:06.740
 it 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:06.740
 thank you very much for listening to the end
