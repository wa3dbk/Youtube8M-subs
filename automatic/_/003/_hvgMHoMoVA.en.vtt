00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:12.690
 as known creative people in particular 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.580
 musicians are people not quite rich 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.800
 and now if you decide to donate 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.840
 exactly money to a friend who 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.689
 doing music then do it 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:27.810
 nice and put your bills in a special 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:30.330

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:49.020
 postcard should resemble royal thai 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.539

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.170
