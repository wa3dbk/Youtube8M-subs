00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:33.910 
exactly like this but it had the

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:35.370 
exactly like this but it had the
intentions<00:06:34.509> in<00:06:34.660> the<00:06:34.720> wall<00:06:34.870> and<00:06:34.960> it<00:06:35.050> had<00:06:35.229> the

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:35.380 
intentions in the wall and it had the

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:37.589
