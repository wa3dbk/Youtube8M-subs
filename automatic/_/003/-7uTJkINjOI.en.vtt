00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:38.520 
25-minute game I'm personally I think

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.730 
25-minute game I'm personally I think
the<00:03:38.850> guy<00:03:39.000> should<00:03:39.030> simply<00:03:39.630> be<00:03:39.660> forfeited<00:03:40.440> for

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:40.740 
the guy should simply be forfeited for

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:45.770 
the guy should simply be forfeited for
for<00:03:41.190> this<00:03:41.720> that<00:03:42.720> this<00:03:43.110> is<00:03:43.350> way<00:03:43.890> too<00:03:43.920> long<00:03:44.400> I<00:03:44.780> am

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
for this that this is way too long I am

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.340 
for this that this is way too long I am
Amy<00:03:46.050> similar<00:03:46.440> I<00:03:46.590> also<00:03:46.800> think<00:03:47.250> that<00:03:48.140> one<00:03:49.140> hour

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
Amy similar I also think that one hour

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:51.830 
Amy similar I also think that one hour
is<00:03:49.680> a<00:03:49.740> completely<00:03:50.370> ridiculous<00:03:50.700> forfeit<00:03:51.600> time

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
is a completely ridiculous forfeit time

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.520 
is a completely ridiculous forfeit time
for<00:03:53.030> classical<00:03:54.030> chess<00:03:54.300> and<00:03:55.050> that<00:03:55.350> it<00:03:55.500> should

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
for classical chess and that it should

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.750 
for classical chess and that it should
be<00:03:55.890> maximum<00:03:56.670> 15<00:03:57.540> minutes<00:03:57.960> I<00:03:58.860> think<00:03:59.460> if<00:03:59.580> you're

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
be maximum 15 minutes I think if you're

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.130 
be maximum 15 minutes I think if you're
not<00:03:59.970> there<00:04:01.880> 15<00:04:02.880> minutes<00:04:03.150> after<00:04:03.600> the<00:04:03.720> start<00:04:03.990> of

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:04.140 
not there 15 minutes after the start of

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:08.060 
not there 15 minutes after the start of
play<00:04:04.380> then<00:04:05.130> just<00:04:05.610> bad<00:04:05.850> luck<00:04:06.440> in<00:04:07.440> other<00:04:07.740> sports

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:08.070 
play then just bad luck in other sports

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:10.580 
play then just bad luck in other sports
you<00:04:08.280> have<00:04:08.520> to<00:04:08.670> be<00:04:08.820> there<00:04:09.030> on<00:04:09.300> the<00:04:09.480> dot<00:04:09.660> and<00:04:09.990> you

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
you have to be there on the dot and you

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.230 
you have to be there on the dot and you
know<00:04:10.740> if<00:04:10.890> you<00:04:10.980> show<00:04:11.130> up<00:04:11.250> late<00:04:11.490> for<00:04:11.760> a<00:04:12.060> game<00:04:12.210> of

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:12.240 
know if you show up late for a game of

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:16.010 
know if you show up late for a game of
tennis<00:04:12.600> tough<00:04:13.320> luck<00:04:13.820> and<00:04:14.820> I<00:04:15.240> sir<00:04:15.540> perhaps<00:04:15.720> and

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:16.020

tennis tough luck and I sir perhaps and
rapid<00:04:16.320> something<00:04:16.590> like<00:04:16.709> five<00:04:16.920> minutes<00:04:17.190> or

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
rapid something like five minutes or

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.970 
rapid something like five minutes or
something<00:04:17.520> in<00:04:17.760> there<00:04:17.880> too<00:04:18.030> yeah<00:04:18.630> yeah<00:04:19.380> I<00:04:19.620> think

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:19.980 
something in there too yeah yeah I think

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:22.700 
something in there too yeah yeah I think
something<00:04:20.700> like<00:04:20.850> that<00:04:21.090> so<00:04:21.410> you<00:04:22.410> know<00:04:22.530> there

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
something like that so you know there

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:26.060 
something like that so you know there
are<00:04:22.740> biochemical<00:04:23.700> reasons<00:04:24.180> why<00:04:24.540> my<00:04:25.290> opponents

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
are biochemical reasons why my opponents

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:29.540 
are biochemical reasons why my opponents
would<00:04:26.640> have<00:04:26.760> had<00:04:26.910> an<00:04:27.240> advantage<00:04:28.520> you<00:04:29.520> know

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:29.550 
would have had an advantage you know

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:31.790 
would have had an advantage you know
from<00:04:29.790> the<00:04:29.940> moment<00:04:30.270> he<00:04:30.390> woke<00:04:30.690> up<00:04:30.900> he<00:04:31.410> knew<00:04:31.590> he

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 
from the moment he woke up he knew he

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.730 
from the moment he woke up he knew he
was<00:04:31.950> going<00:04:32.130> to<00:04:32.250> be<00:04:32.400> playing<00:04:32.610> bullet<00:04:33.030> chess<00:04:33.740> for

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
was going to be playing bullet chess for

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.960 
was going to be playing bullet chess for
me<00:04:34.950> I<00:04:35.310> have<00:04:36.000> a<00:04:36.890> preparedness<00:04:37.890> at<00:04:38.730> the

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:38.970 
me I have a preparedness at the

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:41.390 
me I have a preparedness at the
beginning<00:04:39.360> of<00:04:39.450> play<00:04:39.720> but<00:04:40.080> as<00:04:40.350> the<00:04:41.100> time<00:04:41.370> is

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.400 
beginning of play but as the time is

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.580 
beginning of play but as the time is
ticking<00:04:41.940> by<00:04:42.150> this<00:04:42.660> is<00:04:42.810> going<00:04:43.050> down<00:04:43.290> and<00:04:43.560> down

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590 
ticking by this is going down and down

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:46.310 
ticking by this is going down and down
and<00:04:43.770> down<00:04:44.010> and<00:04:44.190> down<00:04:44.460> you<00:04:45.390> know<00:04:45.510> whereas<00:04:46.080> he<00:04:46.290> is

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:46.320 
and down and down you know whereas he is

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:49.550 
and down and down you know whereas he is
absolutely<00:04:47.070> pumped<00:04:47.580> up<00:04:47.850> and<00:04:48.320> it's<00:04:49.320> very

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 
absolutely pumped up and it's very

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.940 
absolutely pumped up and it's very
difficult<00:04:49.800> to<00:04:50.100> adjust<00:04:50.580> to<00:04:51.740> something<00:04:52.740> like

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:52.950 
difficult to adjust to something like

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:54.620 
difficult to adjust to something like
this<00:04:53.010> so<00:04:53.550> I<00:04:53.760> don't<00:04:53.940> think<00:04:54.300> he<00:04:54.450> did<00:04:54.570> it

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:54.630 
this so I don't think he did it

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:56.330 
this so I don't think he did it
deliberately<00:04:55.169> I<00:04:55.650> don't<00:04:55.919> think<00:04:55.980> it<00:04:56.220> was

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340 
deliberately I don't think it was

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.790 
deliberately I don't think it was
gamesmanship<00:04:56.970> but<00:04:57.510> I<00:04:57.780> simply<00:04:58.260> don't<00:04:58.440> think<00:04:58.710> it

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 
gamesmanship but I simply don't think it

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.970 
gamesmanship but I simply don't think it
should<00:04:58.950> be<00:04:58.980> allowed<00:04:59.340> it's<00:05:00.090> not<00:05:00.470> if<00:05:01.470> everybody

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:01.980 
should be allowed it's not if everybody

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:07.580 
should be allowed it's not if everybody
showed<00:05:02.250> up<00:05:03.140> 24<00:05:04.140> minutes<00:05:04.410> late<00:05:04.710> at<00:05:05.610> this<00:05:05.669> bit

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590 
showed up 24 minutes late at this bit

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:11.650 
showed up 24 minutes late at this bit
and<00:05:07.680> then<00:05:08.330> you<00:05:09.330> cannot<00:05:09.810> call<00:05:10.110> chess<00:05:10.380> a<00:05:10.410> sport

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:11.660 
and then you cannot call chess a sport

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:14.570 
and then you cannot call chess a sport
anymore<00:05:12.660> you<00:05:13.290> know<00:05:13.440> thousands<00:05:14.370> of<00:05:14.430> people

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:14.580 
anymore you know thousands of people

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:19.250 
anymore you know thousands of people
watching<00:05:14.970> live<00:05:15.840> on<00:05:16.740> the<00:05:17.340> internet<00:05:17.850> and<00:05:18.260> I

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:19.260 
watching live on the internet and I

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:20.420 
watching live on the internet and I
think<00:05:19.560> we<00:05:19.680> have<00:05:19.710> to<00:05:20.010> take<00:05:20.190> ourselves

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:20.430 
think we have to take ourselves

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:23.380 
think we have to take ourselves
seriously<00:05:20.850> and<00:05:21.630> these<00:05:21.900> rules<00:05:22.470> are<00:05:22.770> antiquated

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:23.390 
seriously and these rules are antiquated

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:27.170 
seriously and these rules are antiquated
and<00:05:24.390> it's<00:05:24.690> time<00:05:24.930> to<00:05:25.730> change<00:05:26.730> them<00:05:27.030> I<00:05:27.120> think

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:27.180 
and it's time to change them I think

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:28.970 
and it's time to change them I think
they<00:05:27.390> will<00:05:27.630> change<00:05:27.930> them<00:05:28.200> actually<00:05:28.350> because<00:05:28.860> I

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:28.980 
they will change them actually because I

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:31.220 
they will change them actually because I
know<00:05:29.040> they<00:05:29.280> have<00:05:29.460> already<00:05:29.750> discussed<00:05:30.750> this<00:05:30.990> in

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:31.230 
know they have already discussed this in

know they have already discussed this in
