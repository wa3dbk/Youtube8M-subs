some of the recipes fit in a 3x3 grid
they<00:02:28.030> require<00:02:28.540> an<00:02:28.840> actual<00:02:29.080> extended

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
they require an actual extended

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.940 
they require an actual extended
workbench<00:02:30.520> there's<00:02:31.510> also<00:02:31.810> an<00:02:32.170> extended<00:02:32.680> bow

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
workbench there's also an extended bow

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.670 
workbench there's also an extended bow
implemented<00:02:33.730> which<00:02:33.970> actually<00:02:34.570> shoots<00:02:34.840> 50%

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
implemented which actually shoots 50%

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.520 
implemented which actually shoots 50%
faster<00:02:36.070> and<00:02:36.400> has<00:02:36.550> a<00:02:36.580> 50%<00:02:36.970> more<00:02:37.450> durability<00:02:37.930> but

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
faster and has a 50% more durability but

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.090 
faster and has a 50% more durability but
it<00:02:38.709> also<00:02:39.190> needs<00:02:39.430> 20%<00:02:40.420> longer<00:02:40.720> to<00:02:41.110> charge<00:02:41.470> than

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
it also needs 20% longer to charge than

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.250 
it also needs 20% longer to charge than
a<00:02:42.130> normal<00:02:42.640> bow<00:02:42.910> and<00:02:43.239> note<00:02:43.810> that<00:02:44.050> it<00:02:44.230> can

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
a normal bow and note that it can

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.310 
a normal bow and note that it can
actually<00:02:44.790> overcharge<00:02:45.790> this<00:02:46.090> bow<00:02:46.330> for<00:02:46.660> 4<00:02:47.019> more

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:47.320 
actually overcharge this bow for 4 more

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.500 
actually overcharge this bow for 4 more
seconds<00:02:47.800> to<00:02:48.010> make<00:02:48.160> it<00:02:48.280> become<00:02:48.510> supercharged

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
seconds to make it become supercharged

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.210 
seconds to make it become supercharged
and<00:02:49.660> this<00:02:49.900> will<00:02:50.080> actually<00:02:50.350> make<00:02:50.560> the<00:02:50.950> arrow

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
and this will actually make the arrow

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.479 
and this will actually make the arrow
fly<00:02:51.760> at<00:02:52.060> lightning<00:02:52.810> speed<00:02:53.260> or<00:02:53.620> twice<00:02:54.220> the

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
fly at lightning speed or twice the

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:56.280 
fly at lightning speed or twice the
speed<00:02:54.730> depending<00:02:55.540> on<00:02:55.600> how<00:02:55.810> you<00:02:55.870> look<00:02:56.140> at<00:02:56.260> it

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
speed depending on how you look at it

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.540 
speed depending on how you look at it
but<00:02:56.650> it<00:02:56.860> will<00:02:57.040> also<00:02:57.580> slowly<00:02:58.060> damage<00:02:58.750> the<00:02:59.050> bow

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
but it will also slowly damage the bow

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:02.050 
but it will also slowly damage the bow
but<00:03:00.550> it's<00:03:00.700> still<00:03:00.850> fun

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
but it's still fun

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.030 
but it's still fun
furthermore<00:03:03.060> we<00:03:03.569> have<00:03:03.810> an<00:03:03.989> extended<00:03:04.530> fishing

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
furthermore we have an extended fishing

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.630 
furthermore we have an extended fishing
rod

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
rod

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.350 
rod
it<00:03:05.760> will<00:03:06.299> catch<00:03:06.510> fish<00:03:06.950> 20%<00:03:07.950> faster<00:03:08.250> has<00:03:08.879> 50%

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
it will catch fish 20% faster has 50%

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.920 
it will catch fish 20% faster has 50%
more<00:03:09.780> durability<00:03:10.319> and<00:03:10.799> throws<00:03:11.519> its<00:03:11.760> hook<00:03:11.970> 50%

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
more durability and throws its hook 50%

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.679 
more durability and throws its hook 50%
faster<00:03:13.230> than<00:03:13.470> a<00:03:13.799> normal<00:03:14.220> fishing<00:03:14.459> rod<00:03:14.819> as<00:03:15.090> a

00:03:15.679 --> 00:03:15.689 
faster than a normal fishing rod as a

00:03:15.689 --> 00:03:18.740 
faster than a normal fishing rod as a
little<00:03:16.049> addition<00:03:16.530> it<00:03:16.769> also<00:03:17.220> has<00:03:17.670> a<00:03:17.700> 50%<00:03:18.659> chance

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
little addition it also has a 50% chance

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.680 
little addition it also has a 50% chance
of<00:03:19.230> catching<00:03:19.530> cooked<00:03:20.040> fish<00:03:20.310> instead<00:03:21.060> of<00:03:21.420> raw

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
of catching cooked fish instead of raw

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:22.780 
of catching cooked fish instead of raw
fish

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790 
fish

the<00:03:23.790> extended<00:03:24.299> flint<00:03:24.629> and<00:03:24.870> steel<00:03:24.900> will<00:03:25.560> also

00:03:26.149 --> 00:03:26.159 
the extended flint and steel will also

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:28.640 
the extended flint and steel will also
last<00:03:26.370> 50%<00:03:27.180> longer<00:03:27.420> than<00:03:27.750> a<00:03:27.900> normal<00:03:27.959> lighter

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
last 50% longer than a normal lighter

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.610 
last 50% longer than a normal lighter
and<00:03:29.010> will<00:03:29.609> also<00:03:30.000> create<00:03:30.269> fire<00:03:30.750> that<00:03:31.170> will<00:03:31.319> burn

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
and will also create fire that will burn

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.039 
and will also create fire that will burn
twice<00:03:32.040> as<00:03:32.340> long<00:03:32.519> as<00:03:32.730> the<00:03:32.909> no<00:03:33.150> fire<00:03:33.510> and<00:03:33.780> that

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 
twice as long as the no fire and that

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:36.349 
twice as long as the no fire and that
won't<00:03:34.349> be<00:03:34.500> affected<00:03:35.040> by<00:03:35.220> the<00:03:35.280> rain<00:03:35.700> which<00:03:35.970> is<00:03:36.180> a

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:36.359 
won't be affected by the rain which is a

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:39.410 
won't be affected by the rain which is a
quite<00:03:36.930> an<00:03:37.049> interesting<00:03:37.379> point<00:03:37.859> it<00:03:38.310> also<00:03:39.120> has

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
quite an interesting point it also has

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.899 
quite an interesting point it also has
the<00:03:39.599> ability<00:03:39.690> to<00:03:40.109> send<00:03:40.620> mobs<00:03:40.889> directly<00:03:41.730> on

00:03:41.899 --> 00:03:41.909 
the ability to send mobs directly on

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:45.619 
the ability to send mobs directly on
fire<00:03:43.250> there's<00:03:44.250> even<00:03:44.730> some<00:03:44.909> extended<00:03:45.420> cheese

00:03:45.619 --> 00:03:45.629 
fire there's even some extended cheese

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:48.649 
fire there's even some extended cheese
which<00:03:46.079> will<00:03:46.260> also<00:03:46.680> break<00:03:47.010> blocks<00:03:47.340> 50%<00:03:48.269> faster

00:03:48.649 --> 00:03:48.659 
which will also break blocks 50% faster

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:51.379 
which will also break blocks 50% faster
and<00:03:49.260> they<00:03:49.530> remember<00:03:50.370> that<00:03:50.549> only<00:03:50.760> blocks<00:03:51.180> that

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:51.389 
and they remember that only blocks that

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:53.839 
and they remember that only blocks that
can<00:03:51.629> be<00:03:51.810> affected<00:03:52.319> by<00:03:52.349> shears<00:03:52.829> this<00:03:53.400> rule<00:03:53.639> will

can be affected by shears this rule will

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:54.890 
can be affected by shears this rule will
apply<00:03:54.060> on

however it has 50% more durability as
usual<00:03:58.470> and<00:03:58.739> the<00:03:58.980> interesting<00:03:59.489> part<00:03:59.519> about<00:03:59.970> it

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
usual and the interesting part about it

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.599 
usual and the interesting part about it
is<00:04:00.389> you<00:04:00.870> will<00:04:01.049> get<00:04:01.230> a<00:04:01.290> hundred<00:04:01.739> percent<00:04:02.099> more

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:02.609 
is you will get a hundred percent more

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:06.080 
is you will get a hundred percent more
drops<00:04:02.970> from<00:04:03.269> shearing<00:04:04.010> stuff<00:04:05.010> such<00:04:05.280> as<00:04:05.549> sheep

drops from shearing stuff such as sheep

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.839 
drops from shearing stuff such as sheep
which<00:04:07.079> still<00:04:07.530> means<00:04:07.680> it<00:04:07.919> is<00:04:08.040> a<00:04:08.069> random<00:04:08.549> drop

00:04:08.839 --> 00:04:08.849 
which still means it is a random drop

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:11.530 
which still means it is a random drop
but<00:04:09.180> you<00:04:09.299> will<00:04:09.449> get<00:04:09.690> the<00:04:10.019> double<00:04:10.470> of<00:04:10.620> it<00:04:10.829> kill

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
but you will get the double of it kill

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.210 
but you will get the double of it kill
the<00:04:12.540> smart<00:04:12.810> also<00:04:13.230> comes<00:04:13.440> along<00:04:13.590> with<00:04:13.769> tools

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
the smart also comes along with tools

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.969 
the smart also comes along with tools
for<00:04:14.400> orientation<00:04:15.239> such<00:04:15.750> as<00:04:16.019> an<00:04:16.260> extended<00:04:16.769> map
