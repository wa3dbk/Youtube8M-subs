00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.210
 do not 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.950
 to find number 2 on our list 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:15.170
 of extraordinary fighters in their 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:18.189
 natural habitat you have to travel to 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:18.189
 Southeast Asian 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.470
 in other times these fighters lived 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:27.789
 in the murky water of the channels 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.789
 irrigation and rice fields 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.740
 and the reason is that our number 2 is a 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.740
 fish 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.309
 he does not look like a great fighter but his 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:44.380
 scientific name beta splendens 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:46.630
 means beautiful warrior 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:49.300
 their attractive appearance made them 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:51.870
 aquarium fish very popular but there 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.870
 a problem 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.879
 these warriors need constants 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:00.059
 care and attention since they were born to 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:02.430
 fighting are so aggressive that you need to 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:06.680
 keep them isolated as one explains 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.680
 sales creator of the angels face 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:13.700
 the main challenge facing the 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.500
 creators of sales is that we should 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.260
 remember your aggressive behavior and 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.270
 separate them from other fish that causes us 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:22.280
 many problems you have to have thousands of 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.590
 fish tanks every time you have to be in your 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:27.320
 own fish tank if they did not have that 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:30.600
 so aggressive behavior our work 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:33.000
 It would be much easier and more pleasant 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.009
 the betas occupy second place in 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.900
 our countdown because if 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.210
 we place two males in the same stand 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:42.540
 that they will use their strong teeth to 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:45.530
 wrecking each other the loser can 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.530
 to bleed to death 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:55.810
 We do not know why the betas are so 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:58.360
 aggressive but I found out that he took 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.330
 out an experiment in which two 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:03.700
 males were released in a lake 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:06.130
 exactly in the center of the lake and 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:10.119
 They had the whole lake to themselves 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:12.040
 but immediately they began to fight well 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.140
 that we conclude that this is not a 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.640
 territorial question of space since 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.980
 they had the whole lake that was a 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.930
 new territory for both is a 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.420
 domain issue in each pond there 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:26.290
 a fish either male or female that is the 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:28.450
 alpha fish the dominant as long as spc is 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.850
 there dominate others but if not 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.070
 we take out the others will start to fight what 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:36.120
 what is thought is that it is a necessity of 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:36.120
 establish a domain 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:42.270
 this domain or alpha need is the 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.340
 who gave another name to these pretty 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:48.050
 fish since these are the legendary 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.050
 fighting fish of xian 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.510
 the fish fight was once a 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.510
 popular sport in thailand 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.970
 people bet the warrior that 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:02.440
 I thought would be the winner just like 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.440
 in the coliseum of ancient Rome 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:12.290
 just like the fighting fish want 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:15.780
 the gladiators were trained to 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:19.000
 kill in the name of the show 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:21.100
 although his life used to be brief and brutal 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.940
 the gladiators were the stars of 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:27.520
 rock of his time in pompeii someone left 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.710
 a legend on a wall that suggested that 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:32.220
 the gladiator sun udis was a 

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:32.220
 heartbreaker 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:37.109
 it came to be said that the wife of a 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:39.930
 Roman senator preferred the gladiators 

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:42.409
 before his country his children and his 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.409
 husband 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:51.040
 this helps to demonstrate that 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:54.599
 warriors whether humans or fish can 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.599
 conquer the feminine heart
