00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.559
 good morning today we are going to talk about the 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.479
 known four-layer pyramid 

00:00:04.559 --> 00:00:09.430
 baptized with the name of master pira 

00:00:06.479 --> 00:00:12.190
 minks here we have it 

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:13.760
 I bought it in the chicane weston for 27 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:15.950
 Dollars 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:17.570
 they have put it on sale with background 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:19.400
 white or with black background I took it with 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:20.930
 white background because practically all 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.539
 the cubes I have are black background 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:25.880
 had to vary a bit 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:28.160
 turns well follows turns perfectly is a 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.500
 very good plastic it shows hard plastic 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:33.440
 this cube is not going to break even if you do 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:36.199
 a lot of force you see that we can turn 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.670
 no problems like if you intend 

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:38.870
 solve it at full speed then good 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.210
 it can get stuck a bit because 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.180
 it does not have a great flexibility but 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.670
 good does not matter 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.500
 it's good quality look good I had them 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:48.850
 to be a little lubricant especially 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:52.390
 in these areas because I was a little 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.980
 hard is a new challenge to solve a 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.850
 new puzzle for the collection so that 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:01:00.359
 perfect but this cube does not 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:04.879
 it does not arrive alone, that is to say and there are some friends 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:07.549
 in the collection that are the three layer 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:09.439
 and the five layer at the beginning had 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:11.360
 my doubts about if he's going to have any 

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:13.159
 integration problem because 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.509
 lately for being new 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:15.530
 productively I'm only with her with 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:17.000
 the four layers and has left 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:20.210
 completely abandoned to these two 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.549
 but not the truth are the three very 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:25.340
 happy and there is no any kind of 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:26.990
 problem which is very good that 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:32.659
 true now that I see here the three 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:35.750
 layers the pyramid have now removed the gene 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:37.580
 show pira minks man I do not know if he had already 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.530
 one version and now they have taken out another or 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.689
 it's the first time that he brings out abundant 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.550
 as it is and some video has very good 

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:47.760
 Pint man to be is the show 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:49.590
 that is clear if someone has it then 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.450
 that I said yes yes it was very good or 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.310
 not if it's worth buying the 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.650
 first I will end up buying 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:59.340
 but do not know for sure when also 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:01.079
 like to have some reference 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.270
 the stickers are these typical 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:05.009
 Colorful stickers that you have to get into 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.539
 some of your cubes for example how 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.750
 have for 3 for 3 that I dedicate to 

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:12.269
 Felix or in the gym inspires Ming are 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.739
 Very nice colorful stickers here 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:16.200
 there is too much light, they are not appreciated 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:17.730
 very well but they are very pretty 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.470
 pleasant 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.959
 and Wallace would have put a tad more 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.860
 big equal to see - white background 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:27.410
 but it does not matter they are perfectly 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:30.260
 it's easy to solve yes yes it's easy 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:32.300
 to resolve to solve pardon the 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:35.780
 pyramid the pyramids is simple that already 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:38.120
 you know all this one adds a little bit 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.640
 more complexity because he has more 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:43.970
 pieces obviously but when finally 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.770
 and finally resolves like the pyramids 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.950
 applying it a couple of times with some 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:50.570
 small subtlety the complexes after 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.570
 they are with the one of you solve without 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:55.820
 problem has centers that the pyramids 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:56.930
 do not have these little bicycles and 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:58.400
 this is a little more complex 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:02.530
 obviously that is why then 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:04.600
 because it has more pieces and these centers 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.550
 They are a bit annoying at sun time 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:11.730
 the time to solve 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:15.850
 etc. helmsman batirov activate his name 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:18.760
 timur the beater this man 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:22.570
 has designed a six-layer pyramid 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:24.910
 which is called the alpina rust mix and one of 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:27.880
 seven layers that is called the pyramid of 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:31.630
 emperor both pyramids you can buy 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:35.110
 they are very expensive in shape weiss that is 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:37.030
 the store where he sells his designs and 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:40.510
 they are awesome they are huge has a 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:42.939
 lots of very complex pieces 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:45.489
 we would love to have them I do not know if 

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:46.989
 Antonio vivaldi surpass a man who does not 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:48.640
 if you know I upload a lot of videos 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:51.280
 that has a tremendous collection I do not know 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:52.870
 if I show them in one of the videos or if 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.670
 It was another channel but good as it is 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.099
 I've seen some video are 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:59.680
 impressive six and seven layers equal 

00:03:57.099 --> 00:04:01.299
 any day taken from eight layers the 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.190
 size before I forget if you 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:06.600
 you have made all three of the same 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:08.580
 ie size but have more layers 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:11.840
 have come to the conclusion that this 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:13.790
 It is a good size for the hands 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:17.160
 and nothing has made them three three 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:19.050
 of the same size it seems good 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:22.760
 and now that we see them here in the three 

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:22.760
 together which one do you prefer? 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:26.139
 the three layer 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.139
 the four layer 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.750
 the five layer 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:37.400
 hits 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:44.159
 It looks good this 

00:04:41.249 --> 00:04:47.449
 I'm not very difficult right now 

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:49.699
 guess what I prefer the four-layer 

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:52.319
 obviously you do not already know the novelty 

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:54.699
 you can always 

00:04:52.319 --> 00:04:56.889
 when a new bucket you want to 

00:04:54.699 --> 00:04:59.840
 be with him right now I prefer the one 

00:04:56.889 --> 00:05:02.550
 4 but good to comment 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:05.160
 which of these four do you prefer 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:07.510
 and nothing here I leave you with my little 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:11.009
 family of 

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:13.319
 of Euro teapot pyramids curved 

00:05:11.009 --> 00:05:15.180
 with his friend the fish and nothing we see in 

00:05:13.319 --> 00:05:17.719
 another video I hope you liked a 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.719
 greeting everyone
