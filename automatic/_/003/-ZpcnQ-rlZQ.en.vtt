a<00:00:25.410> mobile<00:00:25.680> tablet<00:00:26.220> but<00:00:26.340> then<00:00:26.490> again<00:00:26.580> for<00:00:26.880> those

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
a mobile tablet but then again for those

obviously<00:00:29.160> when<00:00:29.279> paired<00:00:29.550> with<00:00:29.640> a<00:00:30.179> Bluetooth

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
obviously when paired with a Bluetooth

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.900 
obviously when paired with a Bluetooth
keyboard<00:00:31.019> this<00:00:31.650> foreseeably<00:00:32.279> could<00:00:32.550> really

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
keyboard this foreseeably could really

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.940 
keyboard this foreseeably could really
replace<00:00:33.360> a<00:00:33.390> laptop<00:00:33.930> and<00:00:34.140> it<00:00:34.230> still<00:00:34.649> will<00:00:34.829> be

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
replace a laptop and it still will be

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.610 
replace a laptop and it still will be
less<00:00:35.820> hefty<00:00:36.239> than<00:00:36.780> a<00:00:36.809> traditional<00:00:37.020> laptop

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
less hefty than a traditional laptop

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.950 
less hefty than a traditional laptop
about<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:38.700> same<00:00:38.910> as<00:00:39.149> an<00:00:39.300> ultrabook<00:00:39.570> I<00:00:39.809> would

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
about the same as an ultrabook I would

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.500 
about the same as an ultrabook I would
say<00:00:40.110> because<00:00:40.260> you're<00:00:40.410> looking<00:00:40.680> at<00:00:40.829> roughly<00:00:41.510> 2

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
say because you're looking at roughly 2

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.119 
say because you're looking at roughly 2
pounds<00:00:42.960> and<00:00:43.110> change<00:00:43.379> when<00:00:43.680> you<00:00:43.800> combine<00:00:44.100> it

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
pounds and change when you combine it

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.740 
pounds and change when you combine it
with<00:00:44.309> a<00:00:44.399> keyboard<00:00:44.760> because<00:00:45.000> that's<00:00:45.149> where<00:00:45.300> I'm

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
with a keyboard because that's where I'm

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.119 
with a keyboard because that's where I'm
pretty<00:00:45.930> sure<00:00:46.079> it<00:00:46.200> stands<00:00:46.440> to<00:00:46.649> begin<00:00:46.829> with<00:00:46.980> but

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
pretty sure it stands to begin with but

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.950 
pretty sure it stands to begin with but
anyway<00:00:47.399> let's<00:00:48.059> talk<00:00:48.239> about<00:00:48.450> what<00:00:48.840> we're

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
anyway let's talk about what we're

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.000 
anyway let's talk about what we're
getting<00:00:49.079> here<00:00:49.230> again<00:00:50.129> a<00:00:50.160> 13.3<00:00:51.059> inch<00:00:51.300> display

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.010

is<00:01:32.460> to<00:01:32.790> give<00:01:32.970> you<00:01:33.630> know<00:01:33.720> a<00:01:33.750> whole<00:01:34.079> nother<00:01:34.290> user

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
is to give you know a whole nother user

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.590 
is to give you know a whole nother user
experience<00:01:35.729> or<00:01:35.880> to<00:01:35.970> yield<00:01:36.210> a<00:01:36.329> whole<00:01:36.450> nother

something they included because they

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.160 
something they included because they
realize<00:02:58.400> this<00:02:58.610> is<00:02:58.670> not<00:02:58.940> something<00:02:59.420> that<00:02:59.570> the

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
realize this is not something that the

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.110 
realize this is not something that the
average<00:03:00.320> person<00:03:00.500> is<00:03:01.100> going<00:03:01.640> to<00:03:01.730> be<00:03:01.850> holding

for a prolonged period of time in fact

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.350 
for a prolonged period of time in fact
it<00:03:03.800> makes<00:03:03.920> no<00:03:04.160> sense<00:03:04.190> to<00:03:04.610> hold<00:03:04.850> something<00:03:05.120> this

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
it makes no sense to hold something this

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.330 
it makes no sense to hold something this
heavy<00:03:05.540> so<00:03:06.230> you<00:03:06.290> want<00:03:06.770> to<00:03:06.830> have<00:03:06.950> a<00:03:06.980> stand

this<00:03:39.440> bad<00:03:39.620> boy<00:03:39.800> up<00:03:39.830> so<00:03:40.220> it<00:03:40.310> just<00:03:40.459> opens<00:03:40.810> like

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810 
this bad boy up so it just opens like

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:45.850 
this bad boy up so it just opens like
this<00:03:43.510> pretty<00:03:44.510> much<00:03:44.600> very<00:03:44.930> similar<00:03:45.200> to<00:03:45.380> laptop

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:45.860 
this pretty much very similar to laptop

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:50.080 
this pretty much very similar to laptop
packaging<00:03:46.370> is<00:03:46.489> what<00:03:46.640> I<00:03:46.670> would<00:03:46.850> say<00:03:48.010> and<00:03:49.090> there

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
packaging is what I would say and there

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:53.710 
packaging is what I would say and there
it<00:03:50.180> is<00:03:50.470> so<00:03:51.470> thirteen<00:03:52.430> point<00:03:53.000> three<00:03:53.090> inches

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 
it is so thirteen point three inches

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.990 
it is so thirteen point three inches

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:39.940 
the bottom there is no charging port

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:42.240 
the bottom there is no charging port
just<00:04:40.150> the<00:04:40.360> stereo<00:04:41.199> speakers<00:04:41.620> so<00:04:41.830> a<00:04:41.860> clear

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:42.250 
just the stereo speakers so a clear

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:44.820 
just the stereo speakers so a clear
difference<00:04:42.490> from<00:04:43.030> the<00:04:43.840> other<00:04:44.020> site<00:04:44.410> models

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:44.830 
difference from the other site models

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:48.900 
difference from the other site models
and<00:04:45.100> then<00:04:46.050> on<00:04:47.050> the<00:04:47.770> right<00:04:48.220> side<00:04:48.460> of<00:04:48.610> the<00:04:48.669> tablet

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:50.820 
and then on the right side of the tablet
I<00:04:49.150> believe<00:04:49.389> this<00:04:49.510> is<00:04:49.660> the<00:04:49.750> right<00:04:49.900> side<00:04:50.139> we've

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
I believe this is the right side we've

00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:55.419 
the charging port right there so we're

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:57.320
