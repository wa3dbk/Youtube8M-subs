shimmery at all matte Brown so that's

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.920 
shimmery at all matte Brown so that's

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
got that Selena's look bless a really

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.670 
got that Selena's look bless a really
thin<00:01:55.229> line<00:01:55.380> of<00:01:55.439> eyeliner<00:01:56.070> because<00:01:57.560> okay<00:01:58.560> I'm

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
thin line of eyeliner because okay I'm

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.230 
thin line of eyeliner because okay I'm
not<00:01:58.829> even<00:01:59.070> sure<00:01:59.219> she<00:01:59.430> does<00:01:59.670> have<00:01:59.880> eyeliner

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
not even sure she does have eyeliner

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.539 
not even sure she does have eyeliner
because<00:02:00.630> I've<00:02:01.229> never<00:02:01.590> looked<00:02:01.829> that<00:02:02.009> closely

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
because I've never looked that closely

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.969 
because I've never looked that closely
to<00:02:02.670> be<00:02:02.790> honest<00:02:03.119> but<00:02:04.020> I<00:02:04.049> think<00:02:04.409> she<00:02:04.530> does<00:02:04.710> have<00:02:04.920> a

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
to be honest but I think she does have a

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.980 
to be honest but I think she does have a
real<00:02:05.399> really<00:02:05.610> thin<00:02:05.939> line<00:02:06.119> so<00:02:06.479> that's<00:02:06.810> what<00:02:06.960> I

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
real really thin line so that's what I

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.680 
real really thin line so that's what I

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
you've gotta keep in mind that this was

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:35.630 
you've gotta keep in mind that this was
not<00:02:34.470> supposed<00:02:34.739> to<00:02:34.800> be<00:02:34.920> a<00:02:34.950> Katherine<00:02:35.280> outfit

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
not supposed to be a Katherine outfit

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.870 
not supposed to be a Katherine outfit
until<00:02:35.819> after<00:02:36.480> I<00:02:36.569> did<00:02:36.810> my<00:02:36.840> makeup<00:02:37.170> so<00:02:38.040> it's<00:02:38.760> not

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
until after I did my makeup so it's not

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.510 
until after I did my makeup so it's not
entirely<00:02:39.330> Katherine<00:02:40.140> like<00:02:40.500> but<00:02:40.950> you<00:02:41.250> know<00:02:41.370> I

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
entirely Katherine like but you know I

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.330 
entirely Katherine like but you know I
think<00:02:41.900> so<00:02:42.900> main<00:02:43.230> part<00:02:43.470> of<00:02:43.620> the<00:02:43.709> outfit<00:02:44.040> leather

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
think so main part of the outfit leather

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.600 
think so main part of the outfit leather
pants<00:02:45.769> skinny<00:02:46.769> like<00:02:47.070> the<00:02:47.190> pants

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
pants skinny like the pants

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.970 
pants skinny like the pants
I<00:02:50.720> think<00:02:51.720> Katherine<00:02:52.140> would<00:02:52.320> totally<00:02:52.769> wear

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
I think Katherine would totally wear

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.530 
I think Katherine would totally wear
that<00:02:53.280> because<00:02:53.580> he<00:02:53.730> really<00:02:54.150> goes<00:02:54.330> with<00:02:54.480> a

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
that because he really goes with a

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.530 
that because he really goes with a
strong<00:02:54.989> Bala<00:02:55.350> some<00:02:55.940> things<00:02:56.940> she's<00:02:57.150> got<00:02:57.330> going

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:03.830 
strong Bala some things she's got going
