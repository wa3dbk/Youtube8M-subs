00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
was to like I guess like it starts to

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.729 
was to like I guess like it starts to
start<00:02:35.670> small<00:02:36.000> so<00:02:36.239> like<00:02:36.420> if<00:02:36.660> this<00:02:37.140> was<00:02:37.200> so<00:02:37.709> I

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
start small so like if this was so I

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:39.890 
start small so like if this was so I
expand<00:02:38.370> and<00:02:38.580> get<00:02:38.670> bigger<00:02:38.910> it<00:02:39.330> is<00:02:39.480> a<00:02:39.540> chance

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
expand and get bigger it is a chance
