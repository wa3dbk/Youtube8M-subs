00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.249
 15 00 than developed countries 

00:00:09.249 --> 00:00:10.719
 It is. Mi Caina 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:13.719
 I will show you here now 

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:16.679
 3d screen in the name 

00:00:16.679 --> 00:00:20.150
 I will release movies, animations, 

00:00:21.079 --> 00:00:23.439
 I also painted pictures. 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:25.039
 From the qualifier 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:26.970
 Among the latest guitars 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.000
 I can tell you something about this. 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.619
 That's the period. 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:32.320
 Turned pro 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.050
 Photography is a principle 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.090
 I was glad that I had two 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.370
 This was announced as a road map. 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.300
 The extension comes like this 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:44.450
 If so, 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:46.540
 As you can see, 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:48.990
 Emperor Mpion - 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:50.200
 Special Exhibition 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.660
 This program 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:53.660
 If you delay 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.330
 kt it 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.350
 df and then to this time. In addition 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.350
 I have a new employee open up to now. 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.740
 By mouth 

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:05.030
 File can be directly censored 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.020
 If you have an image of a car taken with a 3d camera 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:10.580
 With this 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:11.450
 Three in the second division 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.530
 You can see directly in 3D when you need this amount, etc. 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:15.120
 I need it. 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.880
 And now Ulsan gk 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.830
 It's un. 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:22.100
 Like the ir550 machine 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.260
 Unlike other 3D screens that can be implemented in the world, 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:31.500
 Or even 20-fold lines can support it 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.910
 It is also possible that all four teams are increasing in width 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:35.909
 The majority 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:36.920
 Let's experience it. 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.920
 Double-click the file now. 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.510
 I only hold the schemes I pay. 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:44.670
 This is where I wear glasses. 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.820
 Kim Chang-tae recently appeared on posture 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.030
 Keep all the children's houses exchanged open-minded. 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.550
 If the pearl is too close to the oil, 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:54.770
 Because 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:56.299
 Avoiding the police hospital 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:59.259
 By adjusting the angle of exchange, 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:01.080
 It's a good idea to check. 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.080
 I'll see the verdict now. 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.000
 It's a picture taken with a gn3 wheel. 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.830
 It's covered in and out. 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.720
 Give your budget a break 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.630
 Being aware of this same thing boasts of the key to desertification, more than 100 million won 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:18.510
 Profitability 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.519
 To be anti-democratic 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:23.909
 Can do ubs and more. If you look now 

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:25.299
 The boundary is not clear 

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:28.889
 Of the polling stations supported by the Domestic Leaders, 44 

00:02:28.889 --> 00:02:31.889
 The Japanese referee just says that the guarantor 

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:33.979
 23d with glasses 

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:36.979
 Wear glasses with top filter 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:42.389
 And in the spring, it is these families. 

00:02:42.389 --> 00:02:44.019
 We are together 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:47.019
 Press + 

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:48.859
 The 

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:51.739
 You can move photos 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:54.739
 Staying in Iran and wearing street glasses 

00:02:57.619 --> 00:02:59.319
 Kimpo City 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:01.479
 If you like a genie founder 

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:03.499
 Behind the building is ahead of the building. 

00:03:03.499 --> 00:03:05.709
 Beckham is behind his knee. 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:09.049
 If the building is also the same, there is a change in the rear part and this blessing is bad 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:10.559
 There is a whole word. 

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:14.029
 I know that for some reason, 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:18.219
 I'll give you only my mistake because I'm choreographed. 

00:03:18.219 --> 00:03:21.340
 If you put these on your glasses, 

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:24.349
 I feel the curve of the future. 

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:27.619
 Equipped with a front-end impression 

00:03:27.619 --> 00:03:31.329
 I feel like I have passed through the business 

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:33.669
 He said that he looked round and round 

00:03:33.669 --> 00:03:38.569
 I can live with the feeling of domestic, implements 3D on photo photo 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:40.529
 I feel like I ran away. 

00:03:40.529 --> 00:03:41.899
 In this way 

00:03:41.899 --> 00:03:44.029
 Because it can be utilized 

00:03:44.029 --> 00:03:47.029
 The genome 3d camera on the side is quite expensive. 

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:50.279
 Because it's not too expensive to buy 

00:03:50.279 --> 00:03:52.739
 And went to education 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:53.989
 What the industry is paying attention to 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:57.319
 But if the industry is in the US and there is a lot of advancement 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:59.929
 Because of 

00:03:59.929 --> 00:04:02.929
 do. The picture is a little more realistic. 

00:04:04.429 --> 00:04:07.679
 I do not like the picture. 

00:04:07.679 --> 00:04:10.679
 For those who want to switch to the 

00:04:12.619 --> 00:04:14.549
 When I went to a nice place. 

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:18.120
 Overcome the feeling of that place properly Once the picture is overtaken 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.709
 If you want to 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:23.879
 On the other hand, if you look at the camera and shoot the camera 

00:04:25.099 --> 00:04:28.209
 I could feel the moment right back then. 

00:04:28.209 --> 00:04:30.770
 I think 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:34.610
 Yes, I wish I could wear glasses now but it looks like a repair. 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:36.689
 Now, 

00:04:36.689 --> 00:04:38.930
 it can divide this part 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:41.930
 I'm a little disappointed that I can not show it properly. 

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:44.240
 So much with Sandrine. 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.240
 You can see it working properly 

00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:48.110
 23.
