that it's nice and square here that the
the<00:02:11.909> middle<00:02:12.299> where<00:02:12.900> it's<00:02:13.019> creased<00:02:13.409> lines<00:02:13.680> up

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
the middle where it's creased lines up

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.479 
the middle where it's creased lines up
with<00:02:14.099> the<00:02:15.060> middle<00:02:15.329> here<00:02:15.629> and<00:02:15.859> then<00:02:16.859> again<00:02:17.069> we

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
with the middle here and then again we

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:22.160 
with the middle here and then again we
just<00:02:17.670> want<00:02:17.969> to<00:02:19.459> crease<00:02:20.459> it<00:02:20.730> down<00:02:21.030> just<00:02:21.870> like<00:02:22.109> so

you just flip it over and now you should

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:39.470 
you just flip it over and now you should
have<00:02:37.250> it<00:02:38.250> looking<00:02:38.700> like<00:02:38.849> this<00:02:39.030> where<00:02:39.269> you<00:02:39.329> can

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
have it looking like this where you can

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.959 
have it looking like this where you can
fold<00:02:40.230> up<00:02:40.319> this<00:02:40.530> square<00:02:40.799> and<00:02:41.189> do<00:02:41.489> the<00:02:41.639> exact

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:41.969

00:02:41.969 --> 00:02:43.670 
fold up this square and do the exact
same<00:02:42.000> thing<00:02:42.480> so<00:02:42.689> that<00:02:42.810> it<00:02:42.930> matches<00:02:43.109> on<00:02:43.439> both

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
same thing so that it matches on both

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.940 
same thing so that it matches on both
sides<00:02:43.950> okay<00:02:44.489> so<00:02:44.959> we're<00:02:45.959> just<00:02:45.989> going<00:02:46.230> to<00:02:46.349> try<00:02:46.889> to

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
sides okay so we're just going to try to

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.659 
sides okay so we're just going to try to
get<00:02:47.189> in<00:02:47.340> there<00:02:47.489> there<00:02:47.700> we<00:02:47.790> go<00:02:49.129> and<00:02:50.129> again<00:02:50.430> you

very important you want to stay away
from<00:04:00.209> that<00:04:00.479> otherwise<00:04:01.079> it<00:04:01.590> just<00:04:02.220> isn't<00:04:02.970> going

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
from that otherwise it just isn't going

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.619 
from that otherwise it just isn't going
to<00:04:03.209> turn<00:04:03.329> out<00:04:03.540> right<00:04:03.569> okay<00:04:04.549> so<00:04:05.549> we'll<00:04:06.269> try<00:04:06.599> to

00:04:06.619 --> 00:04:06.629 
to turn out right okay so we'll try to

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:08.780 
to turn out right okay so we'll try to
these<00:04:07.199> scissors<00:04:07.530> are<00:04:07.620> kind<00:04:08.009> of<00:04:08.159> big<00:04:08.370> for<00:04:08.579> this

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
these scissors are kind of big for this

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.809 
these scissors are kind of big for this
so<00:04:09.150> I'd<00:04:09.329> recommend<00:04:09.479> using<00:04:10.459> some<00:04:11.459> smaller

00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:11.819 
so I'd recommend using some smaller

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:15.810 
so I'd recommend using some smaller
scissors<00:04:12.150> if<00:04:12.479> you<00:04:12.599> have<00:04:12.840> them
