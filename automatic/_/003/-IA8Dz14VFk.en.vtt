into the foot stand this is fine when
plugging<00:01:13.890> it<00:01:14.070> in<00:01:14.340> but<00:01:15.119> DisplayPort<00:01:15.630> requires

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
plugging it in but DisplayPort requires

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.510 
plugging it in but DisplayPort requires
you<00:01:16.140> to<00:01:16.290> depress<00:01:16.650> a<00:01:16.680> button<00:01:17.250> when<00:01:17.430> I'm

be pulled off from the front like this

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.730 
be pulled off from the front like this
it's<00:01:36.119> just<00:01:36.570> not<00:01:36.720> what<00:01:36.810> I<00:01:36.869> expect<00:01:37.380> from<00:01:37.470> a

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
it's just not what I expect from a

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.410 
it's just not what I expect from a
monitor<00:01:38.100> that<00:01:38.130> cost<00:01:38.490> twelve<00:01:38.820> hundred<00:01:38.909> dollars

now<00:01:40.079> this<00:01:40.259> is<00:01:40.320> a<00:01:40.470> pre-production<00:01:40.890> model<00:01:41.369> so

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
now this is a pre-production model so

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:42.889 
now this is a pre-production model so
there's<00:01:42.030> still<00:01:42.150> a<00:01:42.210> chance<00:01:42.240> that<00:01:42.540> some<00:01:42.780> of<00:01:42.840> this

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
there's still a chance that some of this

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.929 
there's still a chance that some of this
will<00:01:43.079> change<00:01:43.409> before<00:01:43.770> release<00:01:44.189> so<00:01:44.700> I'm<00:01:44.759> still

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
will change before release so I'm still

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.460 
will change before release so I'm still
holding<00:01:45.270> out<00:01:45.329> hope<00:01:45.390> that<00:01:45.659> I'll<00:01:46.079> see<00:01:46.140> some

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
holding out hope that I'll see some

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:47.899 
holding out hope that I'll see some
improvements<00:01:47.100> by<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.250> time<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:47.640> actual

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
improvements by the time the actual
