which increases durability and longevity
of<00:01:24.689> these<00:01:24.900> ladders<00:01:25.350> but<00:01:25.740> what<00:01:26.189> it<00:01:26.250> really

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
of these ladders but what it really

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.910 
of these ladders but what it really
means<00:01:26.580> is<00:01:26.909> that<00:01:26.939> if<00:01:27.659> you<00:01:27.869> break<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.439> plastic

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
means is that if you break the plastic

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.160 
means is that if you break the plastic
