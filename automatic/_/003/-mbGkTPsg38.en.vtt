00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:13.410
 gold a historic opportunity and so 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.289
 Welcome to the brand whisper 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:19.740
 with just this title because if the 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.930
 then politics could fail in the usa 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.570
 that a massive rally or should that be 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.760
 trigger a massive rally in the gold and 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.730
 The chances are rising day by day 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.230
 you just do not agree if yourself 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.600
 republicans and democrats do not 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.489
 There were not many today 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.600
 a lot to report the us 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.520
 labor market data today 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.030
 normally would have stood 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:45.600
 which have been moved four of 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:47.489
 2,500 employees are in the works 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.140
 others have to stay at home 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.500
 stay unpaid at home because of that 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.039
 no nonfarm payrolls today no 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.989
 us labor market report probably on 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.160
 tuesday then takes place 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.170
 but publication is not yet 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.989
 certainly government shutdown fourth 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.180
 day so it is the fourth day that the 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.400
 US authorities or most US authorities 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.770
 do not work and the longer the whole 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.080
 lasts the more critical it gets all the more 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.820
 the markets become more nervous the us 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.100
 Debt limit is the big issue 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.020
 After seeing no economic data around here 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.000
 To be recorded are republicans 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.360
 Slowly nervous at one of the speakers 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.250
 the us deputy said today 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.810
 now after the game it is not one 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.409
 damn game it's all about very much 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.290
 a lot of 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.540
 So if you have the scope of the 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:34.049
 decision here but aware of it 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.820
 He is a weak figure that exists 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.280
 here nothing like in Germany one 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.619
 such as the kantel 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.869
 Chancellor, he can not do anything and nobody 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.970
 dictate what he wants to do and how he does 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.939
 has to vote and the big problems 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.170
 see the tea party the 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:51.780
 right-wing conservative the almost religious 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.490
 motivated right-wing conservatives themselves 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.350
 will provide against all unification 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.119
 and now the question is the 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.579
 moderate republicans prevail 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.300
 win yes or no because obama seems 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:04.600
 to want to stay hard 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:06.220
 similar to a hostage situation where 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.510
 the policy is usually hard 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:10.420
 and says we go on request 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:11.980
 not one because that only encourages 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.470
 repetitive offender that's just that 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.990
 question, the policy will be distributed so 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.910
 in usa that the debt ceiling is not 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:20.620
 that would mean that is raised 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:22.240
 usa can only spend what 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.830
 immediately taken over control 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.350
 and that would be a massive shock 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:30.240
 in the us financial markets trigger with the 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:33.220
 follow that gold and all risk 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:34.930
 enemy assets explode upwards 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.460
 would so all the security 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.440
 promises and that would be in the case 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:39.700
 the gold too would grow massively 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.920
 look at what the charts are 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.300
 We are currently seeing a bit of gold in it 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:47.590
 a lurking we had this 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:49.900
 Sale under the 1200 80s brand then 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.520
 here with the weak adp 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.320
 labor market report went on thursday 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:57.310
 it's up and right now we're in like that 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:03:01.120
 a range between 1305 and 1320 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:02.410
 if we came here to this zone in 1325 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.050
 if this downtrend to the top 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:07.840
 that would be overcome 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:10.030
 a very positive sign for the gold 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.650
 here in the longer-term chart we see 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:15.370
 Here this constellation is the important one 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:17.140
 Support 1273 if you like this one 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.610
 jump over this downward trend succeeds 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.700
 would be quite space bit area 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:24.940
 1420 maybe even in the 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:27.220
 area 1085 so those in gold 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.420
 they can quite well now 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.470
 bit better sleep because 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.030
 maybe here is one 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:33.550
 Giant chance for the gold pick 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.980
 when politics fail in the us 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:37.630
 should not be really busy today 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.330
 What we see here is the euro dollar 1 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:40.989
 35 84 slight weakness without it 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:43.330
 now a clear direction decision 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:46.270
 But there could be times 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:47.860
 be priced out a bit now 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:50.230
 the market is overbought the euro 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:51.910
 overbought and could be next time 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:55.110
 correct what does the dax stand for 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:58.420
 currently also for exact base at 8.600 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:59.739
 27 Americans are a bit 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:01.360
 become more optimistic 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:02.739
 because of the statements some 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.840
 Republican if it will be enough 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:07.150
 really pushing the markets up 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:09.880
 that once regretted put it 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:11.180
 the important resistance at around 15,000 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:13.609
 50 points 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.930
 a few dots below that is what 

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:17.660
 the big question before we do it again 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:20.120
 The silver watch here an important 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:22.820
 resistance 22.05 the big question is 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:25.550
 just the gold bulls will succeed 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:28.039
 To break out here they need the 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:29.600
 Help US US Politics and 

00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:31.160
 how we assess the situation is that 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.479
 not as unlikely as you are 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.699
 a few days ago a few weeks ago 

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:36.229
 thought that the problems here 

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:40.039
 escalate and that would be a historic one 

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:41.630
 Chance it rarely comes with a 

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:45.139
 good chance risk ratio you could 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:47.270
 put the stop about under the 1273 and 

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:49.430
 speculative a position open up all 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:51.740
 Of course this is risky but just 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:53.599
 also promising if this trader 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:56.810
 works i wish you first time 

00:04:53.599 --> 00:05:00.039
 a nice action 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:00.039
 the broker experts
