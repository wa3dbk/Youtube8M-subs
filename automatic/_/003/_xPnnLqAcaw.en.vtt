00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:09.230 

so<00:00:05.160> here's<00:00:05.460> the<00:00:06.200> Sears<00:00:07.200> water<00:00:07.620> which<00:00:07.890> motor<00:00:08.370> as

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
so here's the Sears water which motor as

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.330 
so here's the Sears water which motor as
you<00:00:09.420> can<00:00:09.540> see<00:00:09.750> I've<00:00:09.840> polished<00:00:10.110> one<00:00:10.590> of<00:00:10.769> the<00:00:10.920> two

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
you can see I've polished one of the two

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:19.240 
you can see I've polished one of the two
torpedo<00:00:12.120> tanks<00:00:13.309> this<00:00:14.309> one<00:00:14.549> is<00:00:14.940> the<00:00:15.120> gas<00:00:15.330> cap

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:19.250 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:23.170 

Sonora<00:00:20.250> safety<00:00:20.699> chain<00:00:20.970> and<00:00:21.240> over<00:00:21.449> here<00:00:21.750> is

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:23.180 
Sonora safety chain and over here is

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:28.220 
Sonora safety chain and over here is
probably<00:00:24.180> an<00:00:24.660> air<00:00:25.109> lock<00:00:25.859> I<00:00:26.570> don't<00:00:27.570> I<00:00:27.810> don't

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
probably an air lock I don't I don't

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.720 
probably an air lock I don't I don't
think<00:00:28.650> that<00:00:28.769> that's<00:00:28.890> where<00:00:29.160> the<00:00:29.250> oil<00:00:29.279> goes

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
think that that's where the oil goes

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.189 
think that that's where the oil goes
because<00:00:30.000> i<00:00:30.150> think<00:00:30.210> that<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:30.689> oil<00:00:30.720> is

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
because i think that the oil is

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.650 
because i think that the oil is
pre-mixed<00:00:31.730> since<00:00:32.730> this<00:00:32.910> is<00:00:32.969> a<00:00:33.090> two-stroke

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
pre-mixed since this is a two-stroke

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.100 
pre-mixed since this is a two-stroke
motor<00:00:35.180> here<00:00:36.180> is<00:00:36.739> the<00:00:37.739> name<00:00:38.340> and<00:00:38.940> model

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:39.110 
motor here is the name and model

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.600 
motor here is the name and model
information<00:00:40.110> serial<00:00:41.040> number<00:00:41.750> build<00:00:42.750> info<00:00:43.260> and

information serial number build info and

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.049 
information serial number build info and
then<00:00:44.610> over<00:00:44.879> here<00:00:44.910> we<00:00:45.090> have<00:00:45.390> a<00:00:45.469> reproduction

00:00:47.049 --> 00:00:47.059 
then over here we have a reproduction

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:50.900 
then over here we have a reproduction
rubber<00:00:48.059> tiller<00:00:48.690> grip<00:00:49.219> which<00:00:50.219> is<00:00:50.370> great<00:00:50.640> looks

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
rubber tiller grip which is great looks

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.580 
rubber tiller grip which is great looks
just<00:00:51.149> like<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.600> one<00:00:51.840> that<00:00:52.289> would<00:00:52.440> have<00:00:52.530> been

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
just like the one that would have been

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.779 
just like the one that would have been
on<00:00:52.800> in<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.300> 1930s<00:00:54.300> or<00:00:54.629> 40s<00:00:55.430> whenever<00:00:56.430> this<00:00:56.579> was

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789

Department of Natural Resources it's
kind<00:01:43.800> of<00:01:43.860> fun<00:01:44.570> and<00:01:45.920> the<00:01:46.920> flywheel<00:01:47.460> still<00:01:47.880> does

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
kind of fun and the flywheel still does

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.080 
kind of fun and the flywheel still does
move<00:01:48.390> and<00:01:48.720> as<00:01:48.810> you<00:01:48.990> turn<00:01:49.259> it<00:01:49.440> you<00:01:49.590> can<00:01:49.770> see<00:01:50.009> it

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
move and as you turn it you can see it

00:01:50.090 --> 00:02:02.930 
move and as you turn it you can see it
turns<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:58.039> right<00:01:59.039> now<00:01:59.250> because<00:01:59.640> it's<00:02:01.940> hitting

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:02.940 
turns the right now because it's hitting

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:08.080 
turns the right now because it's hitting
the<00:02:02.970> stand<00:02:03.360> but<00:02:03.600> it<00:02:03.869> does<00:02:05.119> freely<00:02:06.119> turn<00:02:06.420> the

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
the stand but it does freely turn the

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.810 
the stand but it does freely turn the
propeller<00:02:09.090> son<00:02:09.929> and<00:02:10.920> I<00:02:11.280> believe<00:02:11.340> this<00:02:11.640> is<00:02:11.700> a

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:11.820 
propeller son and I believe this is a

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.199 
propeller son and I believe this is a
water-cooled<00:02:12.510> motor<00:02:12.870> meaning<00:02:13.739> that<00:02:14.209> the

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
water-cooled motor meaning that the

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:17.630 
water-cooled motor meaning that the
water<00:02:15.450> either<00:02:15.720> gets<00:02:16.050> pulled<00:02:16.470> up<00:02:16.650> through<00:02:17.250> here

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
water either gets pulled up through here

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.420 
water either gets pulled up through here
or<00:02:17.670> maybe<00:02:17.940> through<00:02:18.300> here<00:02:18.720> and<00:02:18.840> then<00:02:19.709> shot<00:02:20.250> out

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
or maybe through here and then shot out

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.860 
or maybe through here and then shot out
through<00:02:20.700> here<00:02:21.530> after<00:02:22.530> it's<00:02:22.680> kept<00:02:22.980> the<00:02:23.870> motor

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
through here after it's kept the motor

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.240 
through here after it's kept the motor
cooled<00:02:25.680> down<00:02:26.209> so<00:02:27.980> kind<00:02:28.980> interesting

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
cooled down so kind interesting

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.280 
cooled down so kind interesting
nothing's<00:02:29.940> broken<00:02:30.239> on<00:02:30.480> it<00:02:30.660> still<00:02:30.959> has<00:02:31.110> the

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
nothing's broken on it still has the

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.060 
nothing's broken on it still has the
original<00:02:31.320> skegge<00:02:32.040> down<00:02:32.640> here<00:02:32.970> which<00:02:33.150> protects

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070 
original skegge down here which protects

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.740 
original skegge down here which protects
the<00:02:35.070> propeller<00:02:35.400> from<00:02:35.640> rocks<00:02:35.910> and<00:02:36.239> things<00:02:36.390> on

the propeller from rocks and things on
shallow<00:02:37.100> lake<00:02:38.100> beds<00:02:38.900> and<00:02:39.900> it's<00:02:40.350> just<00:02:40.530> a<00:02:40.620> real
