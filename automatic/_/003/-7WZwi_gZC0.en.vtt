00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
the game has to watch through so that is

the game has to watch through so that is
the<00:00:45.329> spot<00:00:45.629> for<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:46.020> a<00:00:46.050> website<00:00:46.590> that<00:00:46.620> isn't<00:00:46.829> a

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
the spot for the a website that isn't a

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.560 
the spot for the a website that isn't a
second<00:00:47.340> part<00:00:47.579> because<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:47.879> roof<00:00:48.059> doesn't

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
second part because the roof doesn't

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:49.880 
second part because the roof doesn't
really<00:00:48.809> make<00:00:48.989> it<00:00:49.050> possible<00:00:49.320> but<00:00:49.710> for<00:00:49.829> the

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
really make it possible but for the

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.229 
really make it possible but for the
b-bumps<00:00:50.190> out<00:00:50.399> we've<00:00:50.489> kind<00:00:50.640> of<00:00:50.670> got<00:00:50.820> a<00:00:50.850> reverse

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
b-bumps out we've kind of got a reverse

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.000 
b-bumps out we've kind of got a reverse
spot<00:00:51.539> where<00:00:52.020> you<00:00:52.110> head<00:00:52.260> down<00:00:52.289> towards<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:52.920> a

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
spot where you head down towards the a

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.260 
spot where you head down towards the a
bomb<00:00:53.309> site<00:00:53.579> so<00:00:53.789> you've<00:00:53.969> got<00:00:54.000> opportunities

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
bomb site so you've got opportunities

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.720 
bomb site so you've got opportunities
for<00:00:54.870> two<00:00:55.710> different<00:00:56.010> ways<00:00:56.100> around<00:00:56.250> this<00:00:56.489> if

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
for two different ways around this if

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.010 
for two different ways around this if
you<00:00:56.820> know<00:00:56.910> where<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.120> enemy<00:00:57.210> player<00:00:57.570> is<00:00:57.780> and

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
you know where the enemy player is and

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.479 
you know where the enemy player is and
just<00:00:58.410> head<00:00:58.500> into<00:00:58.620> that<00:00:58.800> corner<00:00:59.010> there<00:00:59.190> under

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
just head into that corner there under

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.099

like<00:01:01.260> it's<00:01:01.379> going<00:01:01.500> to<00:01:01.530> hit<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.800> sign<00:01:02.010> but<00:01:02.250> it

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
like it's going to hit the sign but it

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.189 
like it's going to hit the sign but it
does<00:01:02.520> not<00:01:02.730> go<00:01:03.000> straight<00:01:03.329> up<00:01:03.510> over<00:01:04.110> this
