00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:09.900
 in this story we will buy everything you need 

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:12.219
 and derive the total cost of the project 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.540
 materials we buy on completion 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:15.190
 earthworks and 

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:17.560
 calculating the amount needed 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:20.050
 I will give a list of materials 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:22.300
 materials indicating their quantity and 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:25.779
 actual costs in lats and 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:29.980
 EURO PVC film 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:34.420
 width 6 meters thickness 0.8 millimeter 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:36.549
 a total of 8 meters was purchased that should 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:39.400
 be enough for pond 

00:00:36.549 --> 00:00:42.000
 so for cascade with stream as shown 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.000
 on the picture 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:53.260
 film lining width 2 meters 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:56.339
 total 18 meter hose was bought 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:59.790
 vacuum diameter of 25 millimeters 

00:00:56.339 --> 00:01:03.400
 it took us 13 meters 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:05.140
 submersible pump for polluted water te 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:08.680
 the parameters that you see perfectly 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:11.070
 suitable for my pond and waterfall 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:14.550
 I already have more details about choosing a pump 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:17.770
 told in plot number three 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:18.790
 soil cover width 2 meters 10 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.010
 centimeters 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:23.500
 it was used to cover the roller coaster 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:25.930
 against weed germination and for 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.240
 cover the pond around the perimeter with the goal 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:29.140
 protect the film from ultraviolet 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.460
 radiation 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:35.770
 but you can do without stones 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:39.510
 different sizes and pebbles us 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.510
 It took about 5 cubic meters 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.900
 further I will list the components for 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.550
 biofilter 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:49.930
 Of course I'm not going to read the whole. 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:52.100
 list for the reason that you may not 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:52.670
 interested to do the filter 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.940
 by hands 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:58.550
 just buy it ready if you 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.119
 interested then just click on 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:02.270
 pause 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:05.140
 stop the video and read the entire list 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:07.040
 Complete information about the biofilter and 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:10.840
 assembly instructions 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:15.830
 will be given in plot number seven 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:18.440
 various plants for general decoration 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.850
 project cost with unrecorded here 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:24.200
 small expenses 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:26.120
 It amounted to about EUR 750 Well Well 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:30.190
 material purchased and in the next story 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.190
 we will continue to work
