00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 Philip was congratulations is the conclusion 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.870
 who had in mind certainly in terms of results 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:10.290
 results certainly came first 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:13.110
 imagine what we wanted your big part 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.400
 at least they could have missed one more 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.970
 number 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.260
 it finally a 2 0 lead 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:22.980
 we didn't have a second half year 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:25.970
 can bring what we wanted you can 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.199
 how fishing minutes my 30th minute 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.939
 we were given a penalty a red card 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.560
 that of array second match huge 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.500
 just after that the two well then you know 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.059
 that it is going to fall we now played it 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.399
 high pace we can't really do much 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.530
 Opportunities also create one 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.110
 yamato quite important I think if 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.059
 you see the last few weeks 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.680
 yes and few points and to 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.820
 plays orange behind you also have to 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.840
 the it went to grab points that they 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.280
 important 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.960
 there are also positive things in it 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:56.010
 region fine closed our noses 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.940
 today on the other hand 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.530
 you say 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.270
 We must be able to do the second 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.780
 or create something more opportunities it was 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:06.390
 so sporadically and but I understand 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.710
 that to utrecht 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.640
 yes these two points are very important 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.280
 goods 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.780
 and the boy felt that and after 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.490
 luckily chou picked up great ones anyway 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.409
 penalty barlow and n20 wins 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.540
 achieved and I think at the moment 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.570
 very important for myself 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.670
 by the way it's nice that I know 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:27.210
 it was twice so find mester 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.830
 certainly after penalties 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.229
 that is always game you had to be whole now 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.880
 long wait makes the new keeper 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.310
 it the tricky 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.619
 me for my i was just can give me one 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.530
 goal power and more or less score 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.610
 think of was whether the time or way 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.030
 also a rest 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.289
 so now so say the Christmas recess 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:50.130
 there things that are good for the players 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:51.690
 for a moment we carry along with the 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.509
 family to spend the days 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:57.060
 maybe some away and mini break 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:02:00.509
 and then start fresh January again 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.590
 and on the other hand she wins twice than can 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.330
 also go for him tomorrow 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.940
 just settle play 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:08.310
 but I think it's a good thing now 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:11.100
 just to keep a short winter break in the 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.880
 winning the last competition and 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.230
 you just have to keep taking steps and 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.600
 after the winter break just continue true 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.860
 as you are not for yourself you 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.760
 own feeling on it 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.760
 tell me last half year 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:27.250
 I have more than for yes more plays than 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.900
 expected of course due to injuries and 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.850
 first from karim rekik 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.330
 I was allowed to take his place and in 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:35.650
 stijn scarce position in midfield and 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.580
 yes that 's just a positive for me 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.440
 I have so many competitions 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:39.030
 played and think that I am also better at 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.830
 to hear 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.820
 regardless of results it wants to go in 2014 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:45.220
 see 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:47.320
 I think we need further steps 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.430
 we put that we have now as 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.680
 team off 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:54.160
 vitesse I also think there is something 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:57.250
 happened within the team is mutual 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:59.710
 and not only with the fans but 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:02.740
 awareness my whole bunch of players 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:04.990
 that there is still a lot of work there is a lot 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:05.980
 must happen and let that have now 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:08.260
 see 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:11.380
 now also in results of last matches 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.880
 yes that will certainly be after the winter break 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:15.760
 must be and we will have more points 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.620
 then get the first cell from the 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.240
 competition but mostly in with 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.100
 with football what is actually a lot 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:22.930
 people have shown that there are palms 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.490
 important for everyone 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:28.020
 I also come for the club and for the fans 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:28.020
 that we can just finish in peace
