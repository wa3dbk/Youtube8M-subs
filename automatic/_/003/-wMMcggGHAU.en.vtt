rocky rocky or Rigga guy whatever people
call<00:02:29.030> it<00:02:29.150> I'd<00:02:29.960> certainly<00:02:30.170> forty<00:02:30.650> main<00:02:30.800> deck

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
call it I'd certainly forty main deck

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.040 
call it I'd certainly forty main deck
and<00:02:31.370> it's<00:02:31.730> the<00:02:31.820> best<00:02:32.060> wait<00:02:32.360> for<00:02:32.780> the<00:02:32.840> stack

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
and it's the best wait for the stack

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:37.510 
and it's the best wait for the stack
people<00:02:33.650> high<00:02:33.830> 44<00:02:34.340> or<00:02:34.610> 0.3<00:02:35.600> I<00:02:35.810> think<00:02:36.440> just<00:02:37.370> hide

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:37.520 
people high 44 or 0.3 I think just hide

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:38.860 
people high 44 or 0.3 I think just hide
their<00:02:37.700> cards<00:02:38.030> yes<00:02:38.330> you<00:02:38.540> can

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
their cards yes you can

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.290 
their cards yes you can
there<00:02:38.990> are<00:02:39.110> ways<00:02:39.320> for<00:02:39.350> you<00:02:39.620> to<00:02:39.760> side<00:02:40.760> out<00:02:41.060> and

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 
there are ways for you to side out and

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.720 
there are ways for you to side out and
play<00:02:41.450> certain<00:02:41.870> cards<00:02:42.200> but<00:02:42.650> by<00:02:42.860> playing<00:02:43.100> 44

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
play certain cards but by playing 44

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.370 
play certain cards but by playing 44
it's<00:02:44.510> the<00:02:44.600> wrong<00:02:44.720> way<00:02:44.840> right<00:02:45.020> because<00:02:45.290> you

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
it's the wrong way right because you

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.920 
it's the wrong way right because you
need<00:02:45.530> to<00:02:45.650> draw<00:02:45.860> one<00:02:46.430> of<00:02:46.460> these<00:02:46.580> six<00:02:46.910> yeah

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
need to draw one of these six yeah

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.330 
need to draw one of these six yeah
and<00:02:49.930> then<00:02:50.050> our<00:02:50.170> the<00:02:50.320> extra<00:02:50.620> I'm<00:02:50.950> not<00:02:51.160> going<00:02:51.280> to

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
and then our the extra I'm not going to

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.490 
and then our the extra I'm not going to
