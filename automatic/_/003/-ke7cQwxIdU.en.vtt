final<00:00:00.420> example<00:00:00.719> we<00:00:01.380> have<00:00:01.530> a<00:00:01.560> very<00:00:01.770> complicated

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:02.040 
final example we have a very complicated

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.499 
final example we have a very complicated
function<00:00:02.820> f<00:00:03.000> of<00:00:03.120> T<00:00:03.330> is<00:00:03.540> 3<00:00:03.899> cosine<00:00:04.490> 40-2<00:00:05.490> sign<00:00:05.819> 5t

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509 
function f of T is 3 cosine 40-2 sign 5t

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.370 
function f of T is 3 cosine 40-2 sign 5t
plus<00:00:06.750> e<00:00:07.410> to<00:00:07.440> the<00:00:07.589> 2t<00:00:07.830> plus<00:00:08.370> 3t<00:00:08.849> squared<00:00:08.910> plus<00:00:09.870> 70

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
plus e to the 2t plus 3t squared plus 70

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.530 
plus e to the 2t plus 3t squared plus 70
minus<00:00:10.650> 2<00:00:11.010> and<00:00:11.550> we<00:00:11.639> want<00:00:11.849> to<00:00:11.910> find<00:00:12.030> the<00:00:12.210> Laplace

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
minus 2 and we want to find the Laplace

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.560 
minus 2 and we want to find the Laplace
transform<00:00:13.139> for<00:00:13.440> that<00:00:13.590> now<00:00:14.130> if<00:00:14.400> we<00:00:14.610> use<00:00:15.269> the

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
transform for that now if we use the

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.609 
transform for that now if we use the
definition<00:00:15.809> of<00:00:16.440> Laplace<00:00:16.800> transform<00:00:18.619> by

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
definition of Laplace transform by

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.750 
definition of Laplace transform by
definition<00:00:21.769> we'd<00:00:22.769> have<00:00:22.920> to<00:00:22.980> do<00:00:23.189> the<00:00:23.340> integral

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
definition we'd have to do the integral

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.240 
definition we'd have to do the integral
from<00:00:23.820> 0<00:00:24.269> to<00:00:24.390> infinity<00:00:24.420> of<00:00:25.080> e<00:00:25.830> to<00:00:25.890> the<00:00:26.039> negative

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
from 0 to infinity of e to the negative

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:32.179 
from 0 to infinity of e to the negative
st<00:00:27.199> times<00:00:28.199> F<00:00:28.470> of<00:00:28.680> T<00:00:28.980> DT<00:00:29.330> and<00:00:30.349> our<00:00:31.349> F<00:00:31.560> of<00:00:31.769> T<00:00:31.949> would

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
st times F of T DT and our F of T would

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.220 
st times F of T DT and our F of T would
be<00:00:32.340> this<00:00:32.520> enormous<00:00:33.300> expression<00:00:33.989> so<00:00:34.110> we'd<00:00:34.200> have

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
be this enormous expression so we'd have

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.549 
be this enormous expression so we'd have
to<00:00:34.440> plug<00:00:34.649> all<00:00:34.860> that<00:00:35.219> into<00:00:35.520> ft<00:00:35.940> to<00:00:36.840> F<00:00:36.989> of<00:00:37.140> T<00:00:37.350> and

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
to plug all that into ft to F of T and

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.220 
to plug all that into ft to F of T and
we<00:00:37.770> just<00:00:37.980> get<00:00:38.129> this<00:00:38.160> horrific<00:00:39.120> integral<00:00:40.050> and

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
we just get this horrific integral and

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.110 
we just get this horrific integral and
we<00:00:40.590> really<00:00:40.860> don't<00:00:40.950> want<00:00:41.190> to<00:00:41.250> do<00:00:41.399> that<00:00:41.430> so

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
we really don't want to do that so

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.180 
we really don't want to do that so
there's<00:00:42.420> a<00:00:42.480> much<00:00:42.690> better<00:00:42.899> way<00:00:43.050> we're<00:00:43.920> going<00:00:44.070> to

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
there's a much better way we're going to

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.319 
there's a much better way we're going to
use<00:00:44.809> linearity<00:00:45.809> and<00:00:46.520> we're<00:00:47.520> going<00:00:47.700> to<00:00:47.789> exploit

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
use linearity and we're going to exploit

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.510 
use linearity and we're going to exploit
the<00:00:48.360> fact<00:00:48.719> that<00:00:49.079> we<00:00:49.649> already<00:00:49.920> know<00:00:50.280> what<00:00:50.489> the

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
the fact that we already know what the

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.970 
the fact that we already know what the
Laplace<00:00:50.940> transforms<00:00:51.840> of<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.379> various<00:00:52.710> pieces

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
Laplace transforms of the various pieces

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.130 
Laplace transforms of the various pieces
of<00:00:53.219> this<00:00:53.460> function<00:00:53.820> are<00:00:56.300> so<00:00:57.300> this<00:00:57.719> linearity

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
of this function are so this linearity

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.319 
of this function are so this linearity
of<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:58.710> Laplace<00:00:59.039> transform<00:00:59.670> is<00:00:59.940> going<00:01:00.180> to<00:01:00.239> be

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
of the Laplace transform is going to be

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.369 
of the Laplace transform is going to be
extremely<00:01:00.600> useful<00:01:01.230> here<00:01:02.989> we<00:01:03.989> already<00:01:04.260> know

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
extremely useful here we already know

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.490 
extremely useful here we already know
what<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.559> various<00:01:04.949> pieces<00:01:05.220> of<00:01:06.080> the<00:01:07.080> function

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
what the various pieces of the function

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.380 
what the various pieces of the function
do<00:01:07.740> when<00:01:07.979> you<00:01:08.070> take<00:01:08.280> their<00:01:08.430> Laplace<00:01:08.790> transform

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
do when you take their Laplace transform

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.820 
do when you take their Laplace transform
so<00:01:09.960> L<00:01:10.290> of<00:01:11.330> one<00:01:12.330> we<00:01:13.020> figured<00:01:13.320> this<00:01:13.470> out<00:01:13.619> this<00:01:13.770> is

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
so L of one we figured this out this is

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.620 
so L of one we figured this out this is
back<00:01:14.130> in<00:01:14.310> example<00:01:14.850> 1<00:01:15.060> so<00:01:15.240> you<00:01:15.330> might<00:01:15.450> want<00:01:15.600> to

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
back in example 1 so you might want to

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.780 
back in example 1 so you might want to
go<00:01:15.750> back<00:01:15.930> and<00:01:16.170> check<00:01:16.409> at<00:01:16.710> example<00:01:17.430> 1<00:01:17.580> if<00:01:17.670> you

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
go back and check at example 1 if you

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.050 
go back and check at example 1 if you
don't<00:01:17.970> remember<00:01:18.330> this<00:01:18.479> it<00:01:19.049> was<00:01:19.229> one<00:01:19.439> over<00:01:19.590> s<00:01:20.060> L

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
don't remember this it was one over s L

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:35.890 
don't remember this it was one over s L
of<00:01:21.450> T<00:01:26.570> was<00:01:27.570> 1<00:01:27.930> over<00:01:28.170> s<00:01:28.350> squared<00:01:31.159> L<00:01:32.159> of<00:01:32.700> T<00:01:34.310> squared

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:35.900 
of T was 1 over s squared L of T squared

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.920 
of T was 1 over s squared L of T squared
was<00:01:36.900> 2<00:01:37.290> over<00:01:37.590> s<00:01:37.740> cubed<00:01:38.220> I'm<00:01:38.729> kind<00:01:38.970> of<00:01:39.060> looking

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
was 2 over s cubed I'm kind of looking

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.980 
was 2 over s cubed I'm kind of looking
at<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.320> various<00:01:40.650> pieces<00:01:40.979> of<00:01:41.250> this<00:01:42.060> function

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
at the various pieces of this function

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.740 
at the various pieces of this function
here<00:01:43.290> and<00:01:43.470> I'm<00:01:44.250> trying<00:01:44.579> to<00:01:44.729> remember<00:01:44.970> what<00:01:45.600> the

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
here and I'm trying to remember what the

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.230 
here and I'm trying to remember what the
Laplace<00:01:46.079> transform<00:01:46.710> of<00:01:46.890> each<00:01:47.070> one<00:01:47.399> was<00:01:47.610> so

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
Laplace transform of each one was so

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.179 
Laplace transform of each one was so
this<00:01:48.479> came<00:01:48.780> from<00:01:49.079> example<00:01:50.040> 1<00:01:50.659> if<00:01:51.770> you<00:01:52.770> if<00:01:53.040> it's

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
this came from example 1 if you if it's

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:54.319 
this came from example 1 if you if it's
been<00:01:53.340> a<00:01:53.369> while<00:01:53.610> since<00:01:53.880> you<00:01:54.030> work<00:01:54.210> through

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
been a while since you work through

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:55.940 
been a while since you work through
example<00:01:54.720> 1<00:01:54.840> maybe<00:01:55.049> go<00:01:55.200> back<00:01:55.350> and<00:01:55.590> take<00:01:55.680> a<00:01:55.740> peek

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
example 1 maybe go back and take a peek

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.080 
example 1 maybe go back and take a peek
at<00:01:56.100> that<00:01:56.219> and<00:01:56.369> you'll<00:01:56.490> see<00:01:56.670> where<00:01:56.790> these<00:01:56.909> come

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
at that and you'll see where these come

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:05.180 
at that and you'll see where these come
from<00:01:57.409> l<00:01:58.409> of<00:01:58.680> e<00:01:58.799> to<00:01:58.979> the<00:01:59.040> 80

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:05.190 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:12.830 

is<00:02:06.500> 1<00:02:07.500> over<00:02:07.770> s<00:02:08.190> minus<00:02:08.670> a<00:02:10.880> so<00:02:11.880> that<00:02:12.300> I<00:02:12.540> believe

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
is 1 over s minus a so that I believe

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.390 
is 1 over s minus a so that I believe
was<00:02:13.050> example<00:02:13.560> 2<00:02:15.920> so<00:02:16.920> you<00:02:17.010> might<00:02:17.160> want<00:02:17.310> to<00:02:17.340> go

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
was example 2 so you might want to go

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.980 
was example 2 so you might want to go
back<00:02:17.580> and<00:02:17.760> check<00:02:17.910> that<00:02:18.120> out<00:02:18.180> if<00:02:18.360> that<00:02:18.660> doesn't

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
back and check that out if that doesn't

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:28.580 
back and check that out if that doesn't
look<00:02:19.110> familiar<00:02:20.240> l<00:02:21.240> of<00:02:21.720> cosine<00:02:22.350> of<00:02:25.070> 80<00:02:27.590> work

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
look familiar l of cosine of 80 work

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:36.070 
look familiar l of cosine of 80 work
that<00:02:28.830> one<00:02:29.070> out<00:02:29.100> in<00:02:29.460> example<00:02:30.060> 3<00:02:31.100> and<00:02:34.130> that<00:02:35.130> was<00:02:35.550> s

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
that one out in example 3 and that was s

that one out in example 3 and that was s
over<00:02:37.080> a<00:02:37.320> squared<00:02:37.830> plus<00:02:38.160> s<00:02:38.430> squared<00:02:38.760> and

one<00:02:53.790> out<00:02:53.820> in<00:02:54.150> example<00:02:55.050> for<00:02:57.050> so<00:02:58.050> we're<00:02:58.470> not

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
one out in example for so we're not

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.620

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
in this example we're just going to

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.640 
in this example we're just going to
exploit<00:03:03.450> all<00:03:03.720> the<00:03:03.840> work<00:03:03.990> we<00:03:04.140> did<00:03:04.260> in<00:03:04.320> all<00:03:04.500> the

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
previous examples and it should be

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.870 
previous examples and it should be
pretty<00:03:06.240> quick<00:03:06.450> so<00:03:07.430> I'm<00:03:08.430> going<00:03:08.610> to<00:03:08.670> read

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
pretty quick so I'm going to read

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.729

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
so that's I see first of all three

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:18.320 
so that's I see first of all three
cosine<00:03:13.950> of<00:03:14.010> 40<00:03:14.870> so<00:03:16.430> here's<00:03:17.430> my<00:03:17.489> Laplace

this<00:05:27.289> enormous<00:05:27.979> function<00:05:28.400> so<00:05:28.550> it<00:05:28.580> would<00:05:28.729> have

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:28.850 
this enormous function so it would have

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:30.370 
this enormous function so it would have
been<00:05:28.910> a<00:05:28.970> horrible<00:05:29.389> integral<00:05:29.930> to<00:05:30.050> work<00:05:30.229> out

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:30.380 
been a horrible integral to work out

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:32.170 
been a horrible integral to work out
from<00:05:30.590> scratch<00:05:30.889> instead<00:05:31.250> we're<00:05:31.850> going<00:05:31.970> to<00:05:32.030> use

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:32.180 
from scratch instead we're going to use

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:34.029 
from scratch instead we're going to use
linearity<00:05:32.570> and<00:05:33.080> we're<00:05:33.500> just<00:05:33.560> going<00:05:33.740> to<00:05:33.770> break

00:05:34.029 --> 00:05:34.039

this<00:05:34.220> function<00:05:34.639> up<00:05:34.759> into<00:05:35.000> its<00:05:35.150> pieces<00:05:35.630> and

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:35.870 
this function up into its pieces and

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:38.740 
this function up into its pieces and
each<00:05:36.440> of<00:05:36.680> these<00:05:36.830> pieces<00:05:37.100> is<00:05:37.550> something<00:05:38.060> that<00:05:38.690> I

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:38.750 
each of these pieces is something that I

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:40.930 
each of these pieces is something that I
figured<00:05:39.259> out<00:05:39.350> the<00:05:39.410> Laplace<00:05:39.919> transform<00:05:40.490> of<00:05:40.729> in

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:40.940 
figured out the Laplace transform of in

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:44.439 
figured out the Laplace transform of in
an<00:05:41.090> earlier<00:05:41.479> example<00:05:41.660> so<00:05:43.030> first<00:05:44.030> I<00:05:44.150> looked<00:05:44.360> at

00:05:44.439 --> 00:05:44.449 
an earlier example so first I looked at

00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:47.650 
an earlier example so first I looked at
this<00:05:44.570> polynomial<00:05:45.080> we<00:05:45.979> have<00:05:46.220> the<00:05:47.120> basic<00:05:47.479> pieces

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:47.660 
this polynomial we have the basic pieces

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:51.700 
this polynomial we have the basic pieces
there<00:05:48.020> are<00:05:48.289> 1<00:05:48.650> and<00:05:49.010> T<00:05:49.430> and<00:05:49.820> T<00:05:50.479> squared<00:05:50.900> and<00:05:51.199> so

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:51.710 
there are 1 and T and T squared and so

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:53.620 
there are 1 and T and T squared and so
we<00:05:51.830> figured<00:05:52.160> out<00:05:52.310> the<00:05:52.520> Laplace<00:05:52.880> transform<00:05:53.419> of

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:53.630 
we figured out the Laplace transform of

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:56.460 
we figured out the Laplace transform of
each<00:05:53.870> one<00:05:54.139> of<00:05:54.169> those<00:05:54.440> in<00:05:54.740> example<00:05:55.280> 1<00:05:55.520> Laplace

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:56.470 
each one of those in example 1 Laplace

00:05:56.470 --> 00:06:00.279 
each one of those in example 1 Laplace
transform<00:05:57.470> of<00:05:57.560> 1<00:05:57.830> is<00:05:58.100> 1<00:05:58.400> over<00:05:58.520> s<00:05:58.760> T<00:05:59.690> gives<00:05:59.930> us<00:06:00.080> 1

00:06:00.279 --> 00:06:00.289 
transform of 1 is 1 over s T gives us 1

00:06:00.289 --> 00:06:02.920 
transform of 1 is 1 over s T gives us 1
over<00:06:00.500> s<00:06:00.620> squared<00:06:01.070> +<00:06:01.340> T<00:06:01.880> squared<00:06:02.240> gives<00:06:02.449> us<00:06:02.660> 2

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:02.930 
over s squared + T squared gives us 2

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:05.260 
over s squared + T squared gives us 2
over<00:06:03.229> s<00:06:03.380> cubed<00:06:03.830> so<00:06:04.580> I<00:06:04.610> got<00:06:04.849> the<00:06:04.970> Laplace

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:05.270 
over s cubed so I got the Laplace

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:08.999 
over s cubed so I got the Laplace
transforms<00:06:05.930> of<00:06:06.080> each<00:06:06.289> of<00:06:06.470> those<00:06:07.000> ETA<00:06:08.000> T<00:06:08.150> an

00:06:08.999 --> 00:06:09.009 
transforms of each of those ETA T an

00:06:09.009 --> 00:06:11.050 
transforms of each of those ETA T an
example<00:06:10.009> to<00:06:10.039> I<00:06:10.220> figured<00:06:10.610> out<00:06:10.699> its<00:06:10.910> Laplace

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:11.060 
example to I figured out its Laplace

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:14.529 
example to I figured out its Laplace
transform<00:06:11.780> is<00:06:12.020> 1<00:06:12.500> over<00:06:12.620> s<00:06:12.830> minus<00:06:13.039> a<00:06:13.430> and<00:06:13.610> then

00:06:14.529 --> 00:06:14.539 
transform is 1 over s minus a and then

00:06:14.539 --> 00:06:16.600 
transform is 1 over s minus a and then
for<00:06:14.720> the<00:06:14.810> cosine<00:06:15.199> and<00:06:15.440> sine<00:06:15.710> I<00:06:16.099> figured<00:06:16.520> out

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:16.610 
for the cosine and sine I figured out

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:18.520 
for the cosine and sine I figured out
the<00:06:16.669> Laplace<00:06:17.300> transforms<00:06:17.900> of<00:06:18.020> those<00:06:18.229> in

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:18.530 
the Laplace transforms of those in

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:21.219 
the Laplace transforms of those in
example<00:06:18.949> 3<00:06:19.220> and<00:06:19.370> 4<00:06:19.699> those<00:06:20.479> were<00:06:20.630> s<00:06:20.840> over<00:06:21.199> a

00:06:21.219 --> 00:06:21.229 
example 3 and 4 those were s over a

00:06:21.229 --> 00:06:23.170 
example 3 and 4 those were s over a
squared<00:06:21.560> plus<00:06:21.830> s<00:06:22.039> squared<00:06:22.310> in<00:06:22.490> a<00:06:22.729> over<00:06:23.030> a

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:23.180 
squared plus s squared in a over a

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:25.420 
squared plus s squared in a over a
squared<00:06:23.510> plus<00:06:23.720> s<00:06:23.930> squared<00:06:24.260> so<00:06:25.039> what<00:06:25.159> I<00:06:25.190> did<00:06:25.310> was

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:25.430 
squared plus s squared so what I did was

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:27.640 
squared plus s squared so what I did was
I<00:06:25.639> took<00:06:25.669> each<00:06:26.000> of<00:06:26.270> those<00:06:26.360> functions<00:06:26.960> and<00:06:27.169> just

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:27.650 
I took each of those functions and just

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:30.580 
I took each of those functions and just
plug<00:06:27.889> them<00:06:28.039> back<00:06:28.220> in<00:06:28.520> here<00:06:28.849> and<00:06:29.260> then<00:06:30.260> attach

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:30.590 
plug them back in here and then attach

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:33.279 
plug them back in here and then attach
the<00:06:30.830> right<00:06:31.010> coefficients<00:06:31.760> so<00:06:32.419> 3<00:06:32.840> over<00:06:33.260> the

00:06:33.279 --> 00:06:33.289 
the right coefficients so 3 over the

00:06:33.289 --> 00:06:39.100 
the right coefficients so 3 over the

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:41.930 
sign well my a here was for so that's

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:45.610 
sign well my a here was for so that's
where<00:06:42.139> I<00:06:42.169> got<00:06:42.320> that<00:06:42.380> 16<00:06:43.010> plus<00:06:43.340> s<00:06:43.550> squared<00:06:44.620> for

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:50.720 
sign my a was five so that's where I got

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:54.219 
sign my a was five so that's where I got
that<00:06:50.780> five<00:06:51.320> and<00:06:51.740> that<00:06:52.310> 25<00:06:53.030> plugged<00:06:53.990> in<00:06:54.110> the

00:06:54.219 --> 00:06:54.229 
that five and that 25 plugged in the

00:06:54.229 --> 00:06:57.339 
that five and that 25 plugged in the
negative<00:06:54.620> 2<00:06:54.830> as<00:06:55.039> a<00:06:55.070> coefficient<00:06:55.310> here<00:06:55.970> e<00:06:56.349> to

00:06:57.339 --> 00:06:57.349 
negative 2 as a coefficient here e to

negative 2 as a coefficient here e to
the<00:06:57.470> 2t<00:06:57.789> my<00:06:58.789> a<00:06:59.060> was<00:06:59.419> to<00:06:59.750> there<00:07:00.229> so<00:07:00.560> plug<00:07:01.430> that<00:07:01.610> in

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:01.820 
the 2t my a was to there so plug that in

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:04.899 
the 2t my a was to there so plug that in
there<00:07:02.120> as<00:07:02.389> to<00:07:02.930> and<00:07:03.229> I<00:07:03.289> get<00:07:03.470> 1<00:07:03.860> over<00:07:03.889> s<00:07:04.220> minus<00:07:04.460> 2

00:07:04.899 --> 00:07:04.909 
there as to and I get 1 over s minus 2

00:07:04.909 --> 00:07:08.050 
there as to and I get 1 over s minus 2
and<00:07:05.199> then<00:07:06.199> T<00:07:06.530> squared<00:07:06.949> gives<00:07:07.370> us<00:07:07.610> Laplace

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:08.060 
and then T squared gives us Laplace

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:10.810 
and then T squared gives us Laplace
transform<00:07:08.510> is<00:07:08.690> 2<00:07:08.900> over<00:07:09.620> s<00:07:09.740> cubed<00:07:10.159> so<00:07:10.460> there<00:07:10.729> it

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:10.820 
transform is 2 over s cubed so there it

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:13.659 
transform is 2 over s cubed so there it
is<00:07:10.909> there<00:07:11.349> Laplace<00:07:12.349> transform<00:07:12.919> of<00:07:12.979> T<00:07:13.039> and<00:07:13.550> the

00:07:13.659 --> 00:07:13.669 
is there Laplace transform of T and the

00:07:13.669 --> 00:07:15.790 
is there Laplace transform of T and the
Laplace<00:07:14.000> transform<00:07:14.449> of<00:07:14.599> 1<00:07:14.810> and<00:07:15.110> then<00:07:15.650> I<00:07:15.680> just

00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:15.800 
Laplace transform of 1 and then I just

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:17.290

combined everything together and finally

00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:28.710 
combined everything together and finally
I<00:07:26.260> got<00:07:26.470> that<00:07:26.620> Laplace<00:07:27.010> transform<00:07:27.610> of<00:07:27.730> that<00:07:28.120> big

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:28.720 
I got that Laplace transform of that big

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:30.930 
I got that Laplace transform of that big
horrible<00:07:29.110> function<00:07:29.710> without<00:07:30.220> ever<00:07:30.640> actually

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:30.940 
horrible function without ever actually

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:33.180 
horrible function without ever actually
having<00:07:31.390> to<00:07:31.420> do<00:07:31.630> any<00:07:31.840> new<00:07:32.110> integration<00:07:32.620> I<00:07:32.920> just

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:33.190 
having to do any new integration I just

00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:36.300 
having to do any new integration I just
relied<00:07:33.520> on<00:07:33.760> what<00:07:34.390> I<00:07:34.420> had<00:07:34.660> worked<00:07:34.900> out<00:07:35.140> in<00:07:36.100> the

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:36.310 
relied on what I had worked out in the

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:38.670 
relied on what I had worked out in the
previous<00:07:36.580> examples<00:07:37.210> so<00:07:38.080> that's<00:07:38.230> the<00:07:38.380> end<00:07:38.470> of

00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:38.680 
previous examples so that's the end of

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:41.100 
previous examples so that's the end of
our<00:07:38.860> lecture<00:07:39.310> on<00:07:39.490> Laplace<00:07:39.880> transforms<00:07:40.600> in<00:07:40.780> the

00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:41.110 
our lecture on Laplace transforms in the

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:42.300 
our lecture on Laplace transforms in the
next<00:07:41.410> lecture<00:07:41.680> we're<00:07:41.980> going<00:07:42.010> to<00:07:42.160> learn<00:07:42.250> about

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:42.310 
next lecture we're going to learn about

00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:44.670 
next lecture we're going to learn about
inverse<00:07:42.970> Laplace<00:07:43.360> transforms<00:07:43.990> learn<00:07:44.410> how<00:07:44.620> to

00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:44.680 
inverse Laplace transforms learn how to

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:46.980 
inverse Laplace transforms learn how to
go<00:07:44.860> backwards<00:07:45.430> from<00:07:45.940> sort<00:07:46.360> of<00:07:46.420> the<00:07:46.480> answer<00:07:46.960> of

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:46.990 
go backwards from sort of the answer of

00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:49.080 
go backwards from sort of the answer of
a<00:07:47.260> Laplace<00:07:47.590> transform<00:07:48.070> back<00:07:48.340> to<00:07:48.580> the<00:07:48.670> original

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:49.090 
a Laplace transform back to the original

00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:51.060 
a Laplace transform back to the original
function<00:07:49.570> so<00:07:50.020> that's<00:07:50.140> our<00:07:50.290> next<00:07:50.590> lecture<00:07:50.740> in

00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:51.070 
function so that's our next lecture in

00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:53.580 
function so that's our next lecture in
