firstly the disks create a clean furrow

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:10.350 
firstly the disks create a clean furrow
by<00:01:08.119> pushing<00:01:08.390> the<00:01:08.600> soil<00:01:08.869> to<00:01:09.079> the<00:01:09.140> side<00:01:09.469> and

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:10.360 
by pushing the soil to the side and

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.789

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:15.310 
secondly the double disc cutting action
cuts<00:01:13.460> through<00:01:13.729> organic<00:01:14.090> residue<00:01:14.750> reliably

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320 
cuts through organic residue reliably

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.279 
cuts through organic residue reliably
even<00:01:15.590> at<00:01:16.100> higher<00:01:16.310> speeds<00:01:16.729> but<00:01:17.179> how<00:01:17.990> can<00:01:18.200> the

00:01:18.279 --> 00:01:18.289 
even at higher speeds but how can the

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:20.109

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
control wheel help to adjust the seeding

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.210 
control wheel help to adjust the seeding
depth<00:01:22.869> this<00:01:23.869> is<00:01:24.020> achieved<00:01:24.140> by<00:01:24.560> centrally

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.220 
depth this is achieved by centrally

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.069 
depth this is achieved by centrally
adjusting<00:01:25.729> the<00:01:25.850> coulter<00:01:26.240> frame<00:01:26.509> which<00:01:27.049> is

adjusting the coulter frame which is

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:29.469 
adjusting the coulter frame which is
