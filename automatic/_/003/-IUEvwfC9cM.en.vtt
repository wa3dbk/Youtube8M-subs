different<00:00:40.829> lengths<00:00:41.190> depending<00:00:42.030> on<00:00:42.540> which<00:00:42.809> one

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
different lengths depending on which one

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.680

fits<00:00:43.260> best<00:00:43.559> in<00:00:43.800> your<00:00:43.920> application<00:00:44.670> start<00:00:45.600> with

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
fits best in your application start with

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.229 
fits best in your application start with
a<00:00:45.719> shorter<00:00:46.140> one<00:00:46.320> first<00:00:46.680> you've<00:00:47.640> got<00:00:47.850> a<00:00:47.879> bunch

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
a shorter one first you've got a bunch

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.220 
a shorter one first you've got a bunch
of<00:00:48.420> shims<00:00:49.730> they<00:00:50.730> look<00:00:50.969> like<00:00:51.120> flat<00:00:51.449> washers<00:00:51.960> but

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
of shims they look like flat washers but

of shims they look like flat washers but
they<00:00:52.410> were<00:00:52.730> stamped<00:00:53.730> out<00:00:53.850> to<00:00:54.090> my<00:00:54.239> own

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.440 
they were stamped out to my own

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.569 
they were stamped out to my own
specifications

00:00:58.569 --> 00:00:58.579 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:02.020 

the<00:00:59.579> number<00:00:59.969> of<00:01:00.000> shims<00:01:00.510> depends<00:01:01.350> on<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.649> kit

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030 
the number of shims depends on the kit

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.980 
the number of shims depends on the kit
and<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.270> bike<00:01:03.480> that<00:01:03.720> you're<00:01:03.840> trying<00:01:04.140> to<00:01:04.350> fit

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990 
and the bike that you're trying to fit

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.600 
and the bike that you're trying to fit
one<00:01:06.990> thing<00:01:07.290> that<00:01:07.500> because<00:01:07.979> of<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.250> bike<00:01:08.430> I'm

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
one thing that because of the bike I'm

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.910 
one thing that because of the bike I'm
going<00:01:08.850> to<00:01:08.909> demo<00:01:09.150> on<00:01:09.479> you're<00:01:10.200> not<00:01:10.350> going<00:01:10.560> to<00:01:10.680> see

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
going to demo on you're not going to see

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.630 
going to demo on you're not going to see
is<00:01:11.220> what<00:01:11.520> I<00:01:11.580> call<00:01:11.880> a<00:01:11.909> nose<00:01:12.619> a<00:01:13.619> nose<00:01:13.860> is<00:01:14.400> just

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
is what I call a nose a nose is just

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.620 
is what I call a nose a nose is just
something<00:01:15.180> that<00:01:15.680> the<00:01:16.680> screw<00:01:17.119> can<00:01:18.119> go<00:01:18.330> through

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
something that the screw can go through

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.530 
something that the screw can go through
and<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.869> weight<00:01:19.050> will<00:01:19.290> go<00:01:19.440> on<00:01:19.619> over<00:01:20.070> and<00:01:20.540> that

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
and the weight will go on over and that

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.930 
and the weight will go on over and that
that<00:01:21.930> nose<00:01:22.250> interfaces<00:01:23.250> with<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.550> end<00:01:23.700> of<00:01:23.850> the

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:23.940 
that nose interfaces with the end of the

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.180 
that nose interfaces with the end of the
handlebar<00:01:24.450> it<00:01:24.960> just<00:01:25.259> so<00:01:25.440> happens<00:01:25.860> that<00:01:25.950> this

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:26.190 
handlebar it just so happens that this

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:28.700 
handlebar it just so happens that this
particular<00:01:26.399> bike<00:01:27.030> doesn't<00:01:27.360> need<00:01:27.690> a<00:01:27.720> nose<00:01:28.050> so

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
particular bike doesn't need a nose so

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.290 
particular bike doesn't need a nose so
the<00:01:28.830> thing<00:01:29.070> that<00:01:29.220> meets<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.670> handlebar<00:01:30.149> is

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:30.300 
the thing that meets the handlebar is

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.900 
the thing that meets the handlebar is
one<00:01:30.509> of<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.720> shims<00:01:31.250> no<00:01:32.250> big<00:01:32.460> deal

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:32.910 
one of the shims no big deal

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:34.790 
one of the shims no big deal
another<00:01:33.300> thing<00:01:33.570> you<00:01:33.750> won't<00:01:33.930> see<00:01:34.229> in<00:01:34.350> this<00:01:34.500> kind

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:34.800 
another thing you won't see in this kind

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.219 
another thing you won't see in this kind
of<00:01:34.890> in<00:01:35.100> this<00:01:35.460> particular<00:01:36.090> kit<00:01:36.360> but<00:01:36.899> which<00:01:37.080> is

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
of in this particular kit but which is

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.980 
of in this particular kit but which is
on<00:01:37.410> some<00:01:37.770> Bolton<00:01:38.250> kits<00:01:38.550> is<00:01:39.090> this<00:01:39.420> red<00:01:39.690> thing

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
on some Bolton kits is this red thing

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.040 
on some Bolton kits is this red thing
which<00:01:40.740> goes<00:01:41.039> in<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.280> end<00:01:41.490> of<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:41.789> weight<00:01:42.050> it

there before the first step is to remove
the<00:02:18.510> existing<00:02:18.810> bar<00:02:19.319> and<00:02:19.500> weight<00:02:19.709> now<00:02:20.370> it<00:02:20.459> just

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
the existing bar and weight now it just

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:22.460 
the existing bar and weight now it just
so<00:02:20.819> happens<00:02:21.300> that<00:02:21.390> I<00:02:21.540> have<00:02:21.780> a<00:02:21.810> throttle<00:02:22.319> lock

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
so happens that I have a throttle lock

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.710 
so happens that I have a throttle lock
already<00:02:22.709> installed<00:02:23.370> on<00:02:23.550> my<00:02:23.700> concourse<00:02:24.270> so<00:02:24.569> I'm

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
already installed on my concourse so I'm

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.600 
already installed on my concourse so I'm
gonna<00:02:24.870> cheat<00:02:25.170> a<00:02:25.200> little<00:02:25.410> bit<00:02:25.560> because<00:02:25.950> this<00:02:26.400> is

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
gonna cheat a little bit because this is

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.910 
gonna cheat a little bit because this is
what<00:02:26.730> I'm<00:02:26.879> gonna<00:02:26.970> put<00:02:27.239> back<00:02:27.450> on<00:02:27.720> but<00:02:28.530> I<00:02:28.560> can't

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
what I'm gonna put back on but I can't

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.770 
what I'm gonna put back on but I can't
illustrate<00:02:29.489> a<00:02:29.520> couple<00:02:29.940> things<00:02:30.150> you<00:02:30.300> might<00:02:30.420> run

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
illustrate a couple things you might run

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.530 
illustrate a couple things you might run
into<00:02:31.129> for<00:02:32.129> instance<00:02:32.160> a<00:02:32.640> lot<00:02:32.760> of<00:02:32.819> the<00:02:32.970> original

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
into for instance a lot of the original

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.750 
into for instance a lot of the original
equipment<00:02:33.810> bar<00:02:34.230> and<00:02:34.410> weights<00:02:34.620> or<00:02:35.220> bar<00:02:35.550> ends

equipment bar and weights or bar ends

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.809 
equipment bar and weights or bar ends
have<00:02:36.420> a<00:02:36.450> little<00:02:36.900> plastic<00:02:37.470> cap<00:02:38.069> that<00:02:38.370> presses

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
have a little plastic cap that presses

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:41.780 
have a little plastic cap that presses
into<00:02:39.030> the<00:02:39.300> end<00:02:40.010> covering<00:02:41.010> the<00:02:41.129> hole<00:02:41.340> that<00:02:41.550> the

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
into the end covering the hole that the

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.979 
into the end covering the hole that the
bolt<00:02:42.569> is<00:02:43.250> under<00:02:44.250> and<00:02:44.459> the<00:02:45.239> best<00:02:45.480> way<00:02:45.660> to<00:02:45.690> get

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
bolt is under and the best way to get

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:47.839 
bolt is under and the best way to get
those<00:02:46.140> out<00:02:46.349> typically<00:02:46.920> is<00:02:47.040> with<00:02:47.190> a<00:02:47.250> nice<00:02:47.430> nice

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:47.849 
those out typically is with a nice nice

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:50.720 
those out typically is with a nice nice
sharp<00:02:48.180> pocketknife<00:02:48.810> and<00:02:49.110> if<00:02:49.319> the<00:02:49.890> cap<00:02:50.400> goes

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
sharp pocketknife and if the cap goes

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.930 
sharp pocketknife and if the cap goes
above<00:02:51.150> the<00:02:51.360> grade<00:02:51.660> you<00:02:51.989> can<00:02:52.590> often<00:02:52.800> kind<00:02:53.760> of

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
above the grade you can often kind of

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.119 
above the grade you can often kind of
fillet<00:02:54.390> it<00:02:54.599> off<00:02:54.750> work<00:02:55.110> it<00:02:55.290> underneath<00:02:55.560> the<00:02:55.920> lip

00:02:56.119 --> 00:02:56.129 
fillet it off work it underneath the lip

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:58.759 
fillet it off work it underneath the lip
and<00:02:56.340> then<00:02:56.489> pry<00:02:56.760> it<00:02:56.819> out<00:02:57.030> like<00:02:57.330> that<00:02:57.599> you<00:02:57.959> might

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
and then pry it out like that you might

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:01.070 
and then pry it out like that you might
have<00:02:58.980> to<00:02:59.129> go<00:02:59.280> around<00:02:59.640> a<00:02:59.819> little<00:02:59.940> bit<00:03:00.239> from

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
have to go around a little bit from

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.979 
have to go around a little bit from
different<00:03:01.470> angles<00:03:01.800> and<00:03:01.950> pry<00:03:02.190> it<00:03:02.250> out<00:03:02.489> and<00:03:02.989> then

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
different angles and pry it out and then

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:05.600 
different angles and pry it out and then
finally<00:03:04.410> it'll<00:03:04.590> come<00:03:04.860> out<00:03:04.890> and<00:03:05.280> you'll<00:03:05.400> see

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
finally it'll come out and you'll see

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.450 
finally it'll come out and you'll see
the<00:03:05.760> bolt<00:03:05.970> head<00:03:06.440> sometimes<00:03:07.440> it's<00:03:08.160> a<00:03:08.340> little

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:08.460 
the bolt head sometimes it's a little

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:10.180 
the bolt head sometimes it's a little
bit<00:03:08.610> recessed

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
bit recessed

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.340 
bit recessed
and<00:03:10.280> then<00:03:10.970> you<00:03:11.180> might<00:03:11.630> be<00:03:11.750> able<00:03:11.870> to<00:03:11.990> work<00:03:12.170> it

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:12.350 
and then you might be able to work it

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:15.700 
and then you might be able to work it
out<00:03:12.440> with<00:03:12.700> the<00:03:13.700> blade<00:03:14.000> luckily<00:03:14.630> you<00:03:15.380> won't<00:03:15.500> be

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:15.710 
out with the blade luckily you won't be

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:18.250 
out with the blade luckily you won't be
reinstalling<00:03:16.310> that<00:03:16.670> with<00:03:16.850> these<00:03:17.060> things<00:03:17.420> so

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
reinstalling that with these things so

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.100 
reinstalling that with these things so
you<00:03:18.860> know<00:03:19.210> you<00:03:20.210> only<00:03:20.360> have<00:03:20.540> to<00:03:20.660> be<00:03:20.750> careful

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.110 
you know you only have to be careful

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:23.440 
you know you only have to be careful
about<00:03:21.200> scuffing<00:03:21.740> it<00:03:21.800> up<00:03:21.950> if<00:03:22.250> you<00:03:22.310> mean<00:03:23.270> to

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
about scuffing it up if you mean to

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.920 
about scuffing it up if you mean to
actually<00:03:23.840> remove<00:03:24.140> these<00:03:24.350> again<00:03:24.770> and<00:03:25.090> and<00:03:26.090> put

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
actually remove these again and and put

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:29.800 
actually remove these again and and put
on<00:03:27.050> the<00:03:27.200> originals<00:03:28.060> typically<00:03:29.060> it's<00:03:29.330> an<00:03:29.480> allen

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
on the originals typically it's an allen

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:35.170 
on the originals typically it's an allen
head<00:03:29.960> screw<00:03:31.570> like<00:03:32.570> this<00:03:33.400> you<00:03:34.400> just<00:03:34.670> give<00:03:34.940> it<00:03:35.090> a

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
head screw like this you just give it a

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:46.840 
head screw like this you just give it a
good<00:03:35.330> turn<00:03:41.590> and<00:03:42.590> they'll<00:03:42.710> come<00:03:42.950> right<00:03:43.130> off<00:03:45.850> so

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:46.850 
good turn and they'll come right off so

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:48.420 
good turn and they'll come right off so
here's<00:03:47.090> what<00:03:47.270> happens<00:03:47.690> next

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
here's what happens next

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.300 
here's what happens next
you<00:03:49.430> take<00:03:49.670> your<00:03:49.850> throttle<00:03:50.270> lock<00:03:50.830> the<00:03:51.830> manual

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
you take your throttle lock the manual

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:53.740 
you take your throttle lock the manual
will<00:03:52.490> say<00:03:52.700> to<00:03:52.760> put<00:03:53.030> a<00:03:53.060> certain<00:03:53.300> number<00:03:53.570> of

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
will say to put a certain number of

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:56.710 
will say to put a certain number of
shims<00:03:54.170> into<00:03:54.590> it<00:03:54.770> you<00:03:55.160> just<00:03:55.400> stuff<00:03:56.390> them<00:03:56.570> right

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720 
shims into it you just stuff them right

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:57.190 
shims into it you just stuff them right
in<00:03:56.840> there

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
in there

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.450 
in there
and<00:03:58.570> then<00:03:59.570> you<00:03:59.720> you<00:04:00.320> put<00:04:00.530> the<00:04:00.650> nose<00:04:00.830> on<00:04:01.070> top<00:04:01.280> of

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:01.460 
and then you you put the nose on top of

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:03.850 
and then you you put the nose on top of
that<00:04:01.640> and<00:04:02.330> like<00:04:02.570> I<00:04:02.720> said<00:04:02.930> I<00:04:02.960> don't<00:04:03.140> have<00:04:03.410> a<00:04:03.590> nose

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:03.860 
that and like I said I don't have a nose

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:06.010 
that and like I said I don't have a nose
but<00:04:04.100> some<00:04:04.370> bikes<00:04:04.580> it'll<00:04:04.970> look<00:04:05.090> like<00:04:05.360> this<00:04:05.690> or

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:06.020 
but some bikes it'll look like this or

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:07.480 
but some bikes it'll look like this or
there<00:04:06.140> will<00:04:06.200> be<00:04:06.260> some<00:04:06.620> other<00:04:06.800> shape<00:04:07.100> of<00:04:07.280> thing

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:07.490 
there will be some other shape of thing

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:09.730 
there will be some other shape of thing
you<00:04:07.640> put<00:04:07.820> on<00:04:07.850> top<00:04:08.210> which<00:04:09.140> is<00:04:09.350> made<00:04:09.560> to

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:09.740 
you put on top which is made to

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:12.190 
you put on top which is made to
interface<00:04:10.130> with<00:04:10.190> the<00:04:10.550> handlebar<00:04:11.030> so<00:04:11.780> with<00:04:11.960> the

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:12.200 
interface with the handlebar so with the

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.920 
interface with the handlebar so with the
the<00:04:12.470> shims<00:04:12.770> and<00:04:12.950> the<00:04:13.070> nose<00:04:13.220> on<00:04:13.460> top<00:04:13.730> you<00:04:14.720> then

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:14.930 
the shims and the nose on top you then

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:16.990 
the shims and the nose on top you then
press<00:04:15.230> it<00:04:15.410> against<00:04:15.830> the<00:04:15.950> bar<00:04:16.190> and<00:04:16.430> what<00:04:16.790> you're

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.000 
press it against the bar and what you're

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.570 
press it against the bar and what you're
looking<00:04:17.270> for<00:04:17.540> is<00:04:17.690> you<00:04:17.840> want<00:04:18.080> a<00:04:18.580> small

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:19.580 
looking for is you want a small

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:22.810 
looking for is you want a small
clearance<00:04:20.359> between<00:04:20.630> the<00:04:21.169> grip<00:04:21.410> and<00:04:21.820> the

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820 
clearance between the grip and the

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:25.360 
clearance between the grip and the
throttle<00:04:23.210> lock<00:04:23.330> and<00:04:23.600> this<00:04:23.860> obviously<00:04:24.860> has<00:04:25.100> no

throttle lock and this obviously has no

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:27.300 
throttle lock and this obviously has no
clearance<00:04:25.820> so<00:04:26.030> that's<00:04:26.210> no<00:04:26.450> good<00:04:26.630> at<00:04:26.750> all

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
clearance so that's no good at all

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:34.480 
clearance so that's no good at all
you'll<00:04:28.310> have<00:04:28.460> to<00:04:28.550> add<00:04:28.790> a<00:04:28.820> shim<00:04:32.680> now<00:04:33.680> that<00:04:33.980> see

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.490 
you'll have to add a shim now that see

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:36.340 
you'll have to add a shim now that see
you've<00:04:34.669> got<00:04:34.820> that<00:04:34.970> small<00:04:35.330> amount<00:04:35.810> and<00:04:36.050> so<00:04:36.290> you

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:36.350 
you've got that small amount and so you

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:38.710 
you've got that small amount and so you
test<00:04:36.650> it<00:04:36.919> you<00:04:36.950> see<00:04:37.220> is<00:04:37.340> it<00:04:37.490> is<00:04:37.850> it<00:04:38.090> pulling<00:04:38.330> on

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:38.720 
test it you see is it is it pulling on

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.020 
test it you see is it is it pulling on
the<00:04:39.410> collar<00:04:39.680> of<00:04:39.860> the<00:04:40.070> throttle<00:04:40.460> lock<00:04:40.610> when<00:04:40.880> you

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:41.030 
the collar of the throttle lock when you

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:44.380 
the collar of the throttle lock when you
turn<00:04:41.540> it<00:04:41.720> and<00:04:42.680> sir<00:04:43.040> no<00:04:43.400> so<00:04:43.910> this<00:04:44.060> would<00:04:44.270> be

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:44.390 
turn it and sir no so this would be

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:46.060 
turn it and sir no so this would be
ideal<00:04:44.540> you<00:04:44.870> almost<00:04:45.080> can't<00:04:45.380> see<00:04:45.590> the<00:04:45.740> clearance

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:46.070 
ideal you almost can't see the clearance

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:48.159 
ideal you almost can't see the clearance
but<00:04:46.340> yet<00:04:46.520> there's<00:04:46.730> no<00:04:46.910> friction<00:04:47.390> that's<00:04:47.540> you

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:48.169 
but yet there's no friction that's you

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:50.260

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:50.270 
you almost won't get it that good it's

it's<00:04:50.810> very<00:04:51.050> rare<00:04:51.320> to<00:04:51.350> see<00:04:51.530> it<00:04:51.770> that<00:04:51.980> good<00:04:52.330> just

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:53.330 
it's very rare to see it that good just

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.900 
it's very rare to see it that good just
to<00:04:53.510> let<00:04:53.690> you<00:04:53.870> know<00:04:54.070> sticking<00:04:55.070> in<00:04:55.310> another<00:04:55.550> shim

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:55.910 
to let you know sticking in another shim

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:57.880 
to let you know sticking in another shim
you<00:04:56.180> press<00:04:56.419> it<00:04:56.450> against<00:04:56.960> then<00:04:57.440> you<00:04:57.590> have<00:04:57.740> this

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:57.890 
you press it against then you have this

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:00.010 
you press it against then you have this
amount<00:04:58.250> of<00:04:58.400> this<00:04:58.730> the<00:04:58.970> certain<00:04:59.330> clearance<00:04:59.750> now

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.020 
amount of this the certain clearance now

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:03.220 
amount of this the certain clearance now
this<00:05:00.830> is<00:05:01.190> not<00:05:01.490> unacceptable<00:05:02.390> most<00:05:02.630> bikes<00:05:02.960> will

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:03.230 
this is not unacceptable most bikes will

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:05.110 
this is not unacceptable most bikes will
run<00:05:03.440> just<00:05:03.680> fine<00:05:03.980> on<00:05:04.220> that<00:05:04.250> level<00:05:04.730> of<00:05:04.850> clearance

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:05.120 
run just fine on that level of clearance

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:09.070 
run just fine on that level of clearance
it's<00:05:05.450> about<00:05:05.660> 40<00:05:06.020> thousands<00:05:06.440> of<00:05:06.560> an<00:05:06.680> inch<00:05:08.080> but

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:09.080 
it's about 40 thousands of an inch but

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.640 
it's about 40 thousands of an inch but
if<00:05:09.260> you<00:05:09.380> go<00:05:09.590> up<00:05:09.620> one<00:05:09.950> more<00:05:09.980> shim<00:05:11.380> like<00:05:12.380> that

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:12.650 
if you go up one more shim like that

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:14.740 
if you go up one more shim like that
that's<00:05:12.980> too<00:05:13.250> much<00:05:13.460> for<00:05:13.520> sure<00:05:13.820> so<00:05:14.570> you'd<00:05:14.720> have

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:14.750 
that's too much for sure so you'd have

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:20.380 
that's too much for sure so you'd have
to<00:05:14.900> take<00:05:15.169> a<00:05:15.230> shim<00:05:15.560> away<00:05:17.080> so<00:05:18.080> on<00:05:18.380> mine<00:05:19.150> it<00:05:20.150> looks

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:20.390 
to take a shim away so on mine it looks

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:23.050 
to take a shim away so on mine it looks
like<00:05:20.630> three<00:05:21.020> was<00:05:21.500> just<00:05:21.530> a<00:05:22.039> really<00:05:22.280> lucky<00:05:22.760> shot

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:23.060 
like three was just a really lucky shot

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:23.830 
like three was just a really lucky shot
it<00:05:23.300> was<00:05:23.390> I

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:23.840 
it was I

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:29.250 
it was I
EAL<00:05:24.340> which<00:05:25.340> you<00:05:25.580> seldom<00:05:26.090> get<00:05:27.010> so<00:05:28.010> that's<00:05:28.610> when

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:29.260 
EAL which you seldom get so that's when

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:34.960 
EAL which you seldom get so that's when
you<00:05:30.260> take<00:05:30.440> the<00:05:30.620> throttle<00:05:30.980> lock<00:05:31.130> off<00:05:33.970> he

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:34.970 
you take the throttle lock off he

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:37.240 
you take the throttle lock off he
threaded<00:05:35.270> washer<00:05:35.840> onto<00:05:36.050> the<00:05:36.229> small<00:05:36.620> bolt<00:05:36.949> just

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:37.250 
threaded washer onto the small bolt just

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:39.640 
threaded washer onto the small bolt just
to<00:05:38.150> see<00:05:38.330> if<00:05:38.449> it's<00:05:38.600> good<00:05:38.870> enough<00:05:38.900> the<00:05:39.380> small

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:39.650 
to see if it's good enough the small

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:45.670 
to see if it's good enough the small
better<00:05:40.040> than<00:05:40.250> the<00:05:40.370> big<00:05:41.650> usually<00:05:43.570> and<00:05:44.680> you

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:45.680 
better than the big usually and you

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:56.050 
better than the big usually and you
screw<00:05:46.010> it<00:05:46.100> right<00:05:46.130> on

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:56.060 

00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:00.150 

just<00:05:56.750> like<00:05:56.960> that<00:05:58.150> you<00:05:59.150> can<00:05:59.300> give<00:05:59.480> it<00:05:59.600> a<00:05:59.660> whirl

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:00.160 
just like that you can give it a whirl

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:02.710 
just like that you can give it a whirl
the<00:06:01.160> throttle<00:06:01.520> snaps<00:06:01.790> back<00:06:02.120> that's<00:06:02.419> really

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:07.540 
the throttle snaps back that's really
good<00:06:02.960> and<00:06:04.240> you<00:06:05.240> can<00:06:05.770> engage<00:06:06.770> the<00:06:07.040> lock<00:06:07.220> the

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:07.550 
good and you can engage the lock the

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:10.300 
good and you can engage the lock the
throttle<00:06:07.910> stays<00:06:08.180> still<00:06:08.889> can<00:06:09.889> turn<00:06:10.130> it

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:10.310 
throttle stays still can turn it

throttle stays still can turn it
whichever<00:06:10.880> way<00:06:11.030> you<00:06:11.180> want<00:06:11.540> to<00:06:12.040> make<00:06:13.040> it<00:06:13.340> stay
