00:01:25.989 --> 00:01:25.999 
the only problem is that her one arm has

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:32.199 
the only problem is that her one arm has
ripped<00:01:27.429> where<00:01:28.429> it<00:01:28.639> bends<00:01:29.299> and<00:01:30.490> I<00:01:31.490> don't<00:01:31.880> know

00:01:32.199 --> 00:01:32.209 
ripped where it bends and I don't know

00:01:32.209 --> 00:01:36.159 
ripped where it bends and I don't know
why<00:01:32.419> I<00:01:33.310> you<00:01:34.310> guys<00:01:34.549> know<00:01:34.969> how<00:01:35.450> well<00:01:35.689> I<00:01:35.719> take<00:01:36.109> care

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:36.169 
why I you guys know how well I take care

00:01:36.169 --> 00:01:38.980 
why I you guys know how well I take care
of<00:01:36.439> my<00:01:36.649> babies<00:01:37.099> and<00:01:37.369> I<00:01:37.939> Pat<00:01:38.359> her<00:01:38.389> for<00:01:38.719> a<00:01:38.749> few

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
of my babies and I Pat her for a few

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.260 
of my babies and I Pat her for a few
years<00:01:39.259> that's<00:01:39.499> true<00:01:39.859> but<00:01:40.159> I<00:01:40.399> really<00:01:41.119> don't

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
years that's true but I really don't

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:42.730 
years that's true but I really don't
think<00:01:41.419> that<00:01:41.599> her<00:01:41.840> arm<00:01:42.079> should<00:01:42.380> have<00:01:42.499> ripped

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
think that her arm should have ripped

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.419 
think that her arm should have ripped
like<00:01:42.950> that<00:01:43.219> because<00:01:44.139> if<00:01:45.139> they're<00:01:45.439> not<00:01:45.590> being

00:01:46.419 --> 00:01:46.429 
like that because if they're not being

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:49.419 
like that because if they're not being
changed<00:01:46.880> by<00:01:47.209> me<00:01:47.630> they're<00:01:48.049> lying<00:01:48.709> in<00:01:49.099> a<00:01:49.219> baby
