00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.370
 and that's okay, this is black and 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.410
 committed I brought the step and saw 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:11.550
 doctor doug fox trot you do not see 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:13.019
 a beautiful headphone, the direction is df 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.730
 3 of the 2011 fish 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.039
 this piece that I told you that you have 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.830
 to use when you play with water 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.140
 mine this way is what goes in the 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.240
 and goes in control of the xbox and 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.390
 this is where you fit the adapter 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:31.619
 and the bottom entry p2 and you will see 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:33.780
 It's after then and that with you on this phone I 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.399
 I really liked the microphone quality and 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.399
 right audio quality 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.079
 and are very relevant and I really enjoyed it 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:44.129
 Sorround is very good there is a quality 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.300
 very good and the checks checked are 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.539
 very good too 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:51.329
 You can change the volume of the chat game. 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:54.449
 and also the former bricklayer here is a fun 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.850
 a tool that expands the sound right 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.399
 they are also seeing that this person 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.770
 fits in the entrance to see you there 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:05.760
 fits those two years in which 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:08.970
 Male flame but only brings female and a p 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:13.170
 of 2 female né from there you will get p2 from 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:15.390
 your phone on the handset that you have 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:19.860
 to fit the input p2 to adapt to the 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:22.740
 pain there and then you will get the entrance 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:26.520
 usb dock in front in other xbox is 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:29.070
 so in my opinion I found it well 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.320
 complicated, strange, I think this 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:35.009
 Cable mount that long way of sound 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:37.350
 in your ear I found that the volume 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:40.350
 it was not going to work very well but it worked 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.390
 perfectly and I really liked that I 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.290
 I did not like it because his car is very 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.329
 long 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:49.530
 The one you see there I stay 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:52.220
 his and I'm going to show you now 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:56.130
 you have to connect the critical black in a 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:59.670
 xbox not on the applicator that's there 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:03.420
 will be written xbox a p2 entry 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:05.579
 which is thicker and and p1 is that the 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.530
 thinner entrance and doubled you 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.910
 fits in control when with how it is 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:13.320
 I'll show and 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:16.650
 I deleted it 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:17.790
 that's another question you're going to ask 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.190
 and this 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.470
 ie can see my game is the 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.180
 limited version on f3 né 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.760
 and I found it very cool a little bit 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:29.340
 it is also that he sees the 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:32.340
 speaker is flexible type 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.290
 adapt on if you have so the 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.260
 ear half a door so your head to 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:40.470
 victory of life over the sni tutorial 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:42.600
 setup with the life that is easy session 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.660
 on cable avey dog you will see 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:47.640
 but what I was a little afraid of 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:50.040
 When I bought it, it was that many 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:53.970
 people said that he was very 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:56.250
 sensitive and ciee and the 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.790
 car but only I went the same way 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.710
 huh 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.060
 I bought the same way I wanted 

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:02.310
 a phone wanted to improve my 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:05.520
 performance , I started to do these 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:08.400
 videos and and I will not just bring game 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:10.470
 place because I do not have the money to 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.150
 buy the capture card 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.700
 even though my father had money but only 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:17.910
 that they do not give me so I'll have to give 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:20.010
 a blood to collect the money and I 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:22.410
 has a channel or non -component 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:25.110
 I have the adapter to watch TV it 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:27.540
 It's a healthy starter then she try 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:30.630
 an adapter for you to place the bird 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:32.700
 Only I saw her and you find her. 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:36.720
 connect to see component and colors 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:40.290
 They're half different, they're not even 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:42.660
 It's also ahead, I'll try. 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:45.330
 stop the gameplay seal appointments and 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:46.350
 Quepe even with the middle quality and I 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:49.020
 I'll try, right? 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:51.180
 and maybe one day, I'll start recording 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:52.980
 gameplay I'm going to try to improve my 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:56.489
 gameplay is because I do not think it does 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:58.650
 nor three months and look that max ball z or 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:00.180
 I started in the vault last and I am also 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:02.400
 thinking about buying a modern fair 2 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.239
 what an honor that a game interested 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:07.110
 very 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:09.390
 and that's it, and later I'll try 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:12.660
 with the control freak, what to do? 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:14.730
 another boxing and I do not know when the 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:16.919
 next video but thanks for having 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:19.680
 watched this video if you did not like it 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:22.440
 favorite forms part of the channel is 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:25.370
 Possible only Argentina prefix 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.370
