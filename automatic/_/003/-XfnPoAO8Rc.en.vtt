now remember you know the last accident
that<00:02:27.389> happened<00:02:27.780> in<00:02:27.870> the<00:02:27.989> 8th<00:02:28.079> the<00:02:28.349> pilot<00:02:28.859> was

that happened in the 8th the pilot was

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.580 
that happened in the 8th the pilot was
able<00:02:29.099> to<00:02:29.400> eject<00:02:29.700> because<00:02:30.569> he<00:02:30.959> was<00:02:31.109> flying<00:02:31.260> at<00:02:31.500> a

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
able to eject because he was flying at a

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.709 
able to eject because he was flying at a
height<00:02:31.799> in<00:02:32.219> this<00:02:32.519> particular<00:02:32.909> instance<00:02:33.599> the

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:33.719 
height in this particular instance the

00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:35.240 
height in this particular instance the
like<00:02:33.900> lesson<00:02:34.319> and<00:02:34.439> couldn't<00:02:34.769> be<00:02:34.859> checked<00:02:35.099> off

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
like lesson and couldn't be checked off

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.129 
like lesson and couldn't be checked off
because<00:02:35.700> he<00:02:35.969> was<00:02:36.000> very<00:02:36.180> close<00:02:36.480> to<00:02:36.689> the<00:02:36.900> ground

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:37.139 
because he was very close to the ground

00:02:37.139 --> 00:02:38.990 
because he was very close to the ground
and<00:02:37.709> ejecting<00:02:38.219> would<00:02:38.340> have<00:02:38.459> been<00:02:38.609> completely

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
and ejecting would have been completely

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.030 
and ejecting would have been completely
futile<00:02:39.480> and<00:02:40.200> obviously<00:02:40.620> he<00:02:40.739> didn't<00:02:40.919> have

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
futile and obviously he didn't have

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.619 
futile and obviously he didn't have
enough<00:02:41.310> time<00:02:41.430> to<00:02:41.489> react<00:02:41.849> because<00:02:42.150> he<00:02:42.269> was<00:02:42.419> in

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:42.629 
enough time to react because he was in

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:44.869 
enough time to react because he was in
the<00:02:43.139> landing<00:02:43.530> phase<00:02:43.739> his<00:02:43.980> Beauford<00:02:44.489> down<00:02:44.669> this
