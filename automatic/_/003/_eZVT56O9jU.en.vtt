Fleming um around a hundred years ago
so<00:01:11.369> like<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:11.850> banyan<00:01:12.180> tree<00:01:12.330> we'll<00:01:12.510> see<00:01:12.659> in<00:01:12.750> a

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
so like the banyan tree we'll see in a

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.539 
so like the banyan tree we'll see in a
minute<00:01:12.900> about<00:01:13.560> a<00:01:13.590> hundred<00:01:13.920> years<00:01:14.100> old

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
minute about a hundred years old

minute about a hundred years old
just<00:01:15.360> around<00:01:15.570> here<00:01:15.780> though<00:01:15.960> we<00:01:16.080> have<00:01:16.200> a<00:01:16.229> rubber

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
just around here though we have a rubber

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.850 
just around here though we have a rubber
tree<00:01:16.830> that<00:01:17.460> Fleming<00:01:17.970> planted<00:01:18.530> so<00:01:19.530> they<00:01:19.650> grow

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
tree that Fleming planted so they grow

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.760 
tree that Fleming planted so they grow
pretty<00:01:19.890> fast<00:01:20.189> right<00:01:20.909> let<00:01:21.180> me<00:01:21.210> do<00:01:21.560> it<00:01:22.560> seems

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
pretty fast right let me do it seems

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.550 
pretty fast right let me do it seems
pretty<00:01:22.979> mature<00:01:23.869> the<00:01:24.869> fern<00:01:25.290> that<00:01:25.439> you're

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
pretty mature the fern that you're

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.109 
pretty mature the fern that you're
looking<00:01:25.799> at<00:01:25.950> up<00:01:26.130> on<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.400> tree<00:01:26.640> is<00:01:26.790> called<00:01:27.000> the

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
looking at up on the tree is called the

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.300 
looking at up on the tree is called the
bird's<00:01:27.360> nest<00:01:27.720> fern<00:01:27.869> it's<00:01:28.259> an<00:01:28.409> epiphyte<00:01:28.829> which

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
bird's nest fern it's an epiphyte which

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.130 
bird's nest fern it's an epiphyte which
means<00:01:29.579> that<00:01:29.850> it<00:01:30.030> grows<00:01:30.240> in<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.600> top<00:01:30.840> of<00:01:31.020> the

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
means that it grows in the top of the

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.230 
means that it grows in the top of the
trees<00:01:31.409> so<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.100> seeds<00:01:32.310> will<00:01:32.520> settle<00:01:32.759> up<00:01:33.090> in<00:01:33.180> the

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
trees so the seeds will settle up in the

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.749 
trees so the seeds will settle up in the
canopy<00:01:33.780> and<00:01:33.990> grow<00:01:34.680> in<00:01:34.979> order<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:35.369> find<00:01:35.549> enough
