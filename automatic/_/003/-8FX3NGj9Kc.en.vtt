00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:15.889 
going to wire a motor to the driver and

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:19.029 
going to wire a motor to the driver and
I<00:04:16.430> will<00:04:16.609> wire<00:04:17.150> the<00:04:17.509> five<00:04:18.019> volts<00:04:18.530> to<00:04:18.680> the<00:04:18.769> driver

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:19.039 
I will wire the five volts to the driver

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:21.430 
I will wire the five volts to the driver
and<00:04:19.310> then<00:04:19.639> I'm<00:04:19.759> going<00:04:19.910> to<00:04:19.970> wire<00:04:20.209> the<00:04:20.539> 36<00:04:21.109> volts

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 
and then I'm going to wire the 36 volts

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.080 
and then I'm going to wire the 36 volts
to<00:04:21.590> the<00:04:21.620> driver<00:04:21.949> I'm<00:04:22.220> going<00:04:22.370> to<00:04:22.430> measure<00:04:22.580> an

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 
to the driver I'm going to measure an

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:25.300 
to the driver I'm going to measure an
appropriate<00:04:23.660> sized<00:04:23.930> wire<00:04:24.650> I'll<00:04:25.099> have<00:04:25.280> a

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:25.310 
appropriate sized wire I'll have a

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:27.040 
appropriate sized wire I'll have a
little<00:04:25.610> bit<00:04:25.910> of<00:04:25.940> slack<00:04:26.300> so<00:04:26.539> I<00:04:26.570> can<00:04:26.810> get<00:04:26.960> it

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.050 
little bit of slack so I can get it

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:29.110 
little bit of slack so I can get it
inside<00:04:27.380> of<00:04:27.500> the<00:04:27.650> terminals<00:04:28.190> just<00:04:28.759> from<00:04:28.940> my<00:04:29.090> own

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120 
inside of the terminals just from my own

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.600 
inside of the terminals just from my own
conventions<00:04:29.810> I'm<00:04:29.990> using<00:04:30.229> orange<00:04:30.979> for<00:04:31.370> the

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:31.610 
conventions I'm using orange for the

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:34.270 
conventions I'm using orange for the
signal<00:04:32.270> wires<00:04:32.479> and<00:04:32.870> the<00:04:33.199> pins<00:04:33.440> to<00:04:33.620> the<00:04:33.770> drivers

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.280 
signal wires and the pins to the drivers

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:37.120 
signal wires and the pins to the drivers
I'll<00:04:34.550> use<00:04:34.789> blue<00:04:35.060> wire<00:04:35.360> for<00:04:35.750> the<00:04:35.900> voltage<00:04:36.770> to

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:37.130 
I'll use blue wire for the voltage to

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:40.480 
I'll use blue wire for the voltage to
the<00:04:37.220> drivers

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:40.490 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:43.630 

the<00:04:41.140> number<00:04:42.140> two<00:04:42.440> pin<00:04:42.770> since<00:04:43.280> it's<00:04:43.460> going<00:04:43.580> to

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:43.640 
the number two pin since it's going to

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:46.360 
the number two pin since it's going to
be<00:04:43.760> the<00:04:43.910> step<00:04:44.180> it's<00:04:44.450> the<00:04:44.600> pulse<00:04:45.170> on<00:04:45.530> the<00:04:46.100> driver

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:46.370 
be the step it's the pulse on the driver

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:54.780 
be the step it's the pulse on the driver
so<00:04:46.760> I'm<00:04:46.910> going<00:04:47.090> to<00:04:47.150> be<00:04:47.270> putting<00:04:47.570> that<00:04:47.750> -<00:04:47.960> pol<00:04:48.740> -

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:54.790 

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:57.600 

okay<00:04:55.650> then<00:04:56.650> I'm<00:04:56.740> going<00:04:56.860> to<00:04:56.890> go<00:04:57.040> to<00:04:57.100> my<00:04:57.400> number

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:57.610 
okay then I'm going to go to my number

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:03.040 
okay then I'm going to go to my number
two<00:04:57.910> pin

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.050 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:04.750 

one<00:05:03.620> change<00:05:03.890> that<00:05:04.190> I<00:05:04.280> am<00:05:04.400> going<00:05:04.550> to<00:05:04.640> make

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:04.760 
one change that I am going to make

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:06.730 
one change that I am going to make
because<00:05:05.060> I<00:05:05.240> want<00:05:05.450> to<00:05:05.510> use<00:05:05.690> these<00:05:05.930> common

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:06.740 
because I want to use these common

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:09.250 
because I want to use these common
terminals<00:05:07.430> for<00:05:08.120> the<00:05:08.210> 5<00:05:08.450> volts<00:05:08.840> I'm<00:05:09.020> going<00:05:09.200> to

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:09.260 
terminals for the 5 volts I'm going to

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.310 
terminals for the 5 volts I'm going to
go<00:05:09.380> ahead<00:05:09.470> and<00:05:09.680> change<00:05:09.950> the<00:05:10.570> jumper<00:05:11.570> for<00:05:12.020> comm

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:12.320 
go ahead and change the jumper for comm

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:15.340 
go ahead and change the jumper for comm
equals<00:05:12.890> 5<00:05:13.430> volts<00:05:13.820> not<00:05:14.030> calm<00:05:14.300> equals<00:05:14.660> ground<00:05:14.930> so

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:15.350 
equals 5 volts not calm equals ground so

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:18.520 
equals 5 volts not calm equals ground so
we<00:05:15.830> change<00:05:16.100> that<00:05:16.310> jumper<00:05:16.790> to<00:05:16.970> 2<00:05:17.480> to<00:05:17.600> 3<00:05:17.630> so<00:05:18.260> I<00:05:18.350> can

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:18.530 
we change that jumper to 2 to 3 so I can

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:21.160 
we change that jumper to 2 to 3 so I can
make<00:05:18.650> use<00:05:18.860> of<00:05:18.890> these<00:05:19.390> other<00:05:20.390> terminals<00:05:20.870> now

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:21.170 
make use of these other terminals now

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:24.400 
make use of these other terminals now
I'm<00:05:21.320> going<00:05:21.590> to<00:05:21.710> connect<00:05:22.490> the<00:05:22.670> 3<00:05:23.660> pin<00:05:23.960> to<00:05:24.290> the

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:24.410 
I'm going to connect the 3 pin to the

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:30.040 
I'm going to connect the 3 pin to the
direction<00:05:24.950> minus

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:30.050 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:33.219 

okay<00:05:30.860> now<00:05:31.250> that's<00:05:31.460> connected<00:05:32.090> and<00:05:32.389> now<00:05:33.110> I'm

00:05:33.219 --> 00:05:33.229 
okay now that's connected and now I'm

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:36.070 
okay now that's connected and now I'm
going<00:05:33.349> to<00:05:33.440> wire<00:05:33.680> five<00:05:34.460> volts<00:05:34.849> to<00:05:35.060> the<00:05:35.090> pulse<00:05:35.780> or

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:36.080 
going to wire five volts to the pulse or

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:37.869

step<00:05:36.500> five<00:05:36.740> volts<00:05:37.069> to<00:05:37.160> the<00:05:37.220> direction<00:05:37.639> I'm

00:05:37.869 --> 00:05:37.879 
step five volts to the direction I'm

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:42.860 
step five volts to the direction I'm
going<00:05:38.060> to<00:05:38.120> use<00:05:38.210> my<00:05:38.389> blue<00:05:38.629> wire<00:05:38.840> flow

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:42.870 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:44.570 

is<00:05:42.930> about<00:05:43.140> the<00:05:43.260> same<00:05:43.470> length<00:05:43.500> so<00:05:44.010> I<00:05:44.040> can<00:05:44.340> use

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:44.580 
is about the same length so I can use

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:48.050 
is about the same length so I can use
the<00:05:44.850> common<00:05:45.660> terminal<00:05:46.200> for<00:05:46.530> both<00:05:46.850> I'll<00:05:47.850> just

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:48.060 
the common terminal for both I'll just

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:51.380 
the common terminal for both I'll just
wire<00:05:48.270> those<00:05:48.510> together<00:05:49.940> all<00:05:50.940> right<00:05:51.090> I'm<00:05:51.240> going

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:51.390 
wire those together all right I'm going

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:54.620 
wire those together all right I'm going
to<00:05:51.450> wire<00:05:51.600> these<00:05:51.810> together<00:05:53.180> all<00:05:54.180> right<00:05:54.360> and

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:54.630 
to wire these together all right and

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:57.230 
to wire these together all right and
stick<00:05:55.140> it<00:05:55.320> into<00:05:55.530> this<00:05:55.830> cub<00:05:56.160> you<00:05:56.820> might<00:05:57.030> also

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:57.240 
stick it into this cub you might also

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:59.740 
stick it into this cub you might also
notice<00:05:57.570> when<00:05:57.960> I<00:05:58.020> strip<00:05:58.350> them<00:05:58.530> I<00:05:58.680> bend<00:05:59.100> it<00:05:59.280> here

00:05:59.740 --> 00:05:59.750 
notice when I strip them I bend it here

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:03.110 
notice when I strip them I bend it here
that<00:06:00.750> is<00:06:00.930> so<00:06:01.110> the<00:06:01.680> installation<00:06:01.980> doesn't<00:06:02.670> move

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:03.120 
that is so the installation doesn't move

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:06.869 
that is so the installation doesn't move
on<00:06:03.540> doing<00:06:03.960> this

00:06:06.869 --> 00:06:06.879 

00:06:06.879 --> 00:06:09.749 

okay<00:06:07.779> so<00:06:07.839> it's<00:06:08.800> this<00:06:08.889> M<00:06:09.069> that's<00:06:09.249> connected

00:06:09.749 --> 00:06:09.759 
okay so it's this M that's connected

00:06:09.759 --> 00:06:13.750 
okay so it's this M that's connected
together<00:06:09.879> goes<00:06:10.270> into<00:06:10.479> the<00:06:10.569> common

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:13.760 

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:17.860 

all<00:06:14.360> right<00:06:14.540> now<00:06:14.900> put<00:06:15.560> this<00:06:15.740> in<00:06:16.010> the<00:06:16.450> pulse<00:06:17.450> five

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:17.870 
all right now put this in the pulse five

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:20.439 
all right now put this in the pulse five
volts

00:06:20.439 --> 00:06:20.449 

00:06:20.449 --> 00:06:22.119 

it<00:06:20.930> may<00:06:21.080> have<00:06:21.199> made<00:06:21.319> this<00:06:21.469> wire<00:06:21.680> a<00:06:21.710> little<00:06:22.009> too

00:06:22.119 --> 00:06:22.129 
it may have made this wire a little too

00:06:22.129 --> 00:06:24.560 
it may have made this wire a little too
short<00:06:22.340> but<00:06:22.610> that's<00:06:22.759> alright

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:24.570 
short but that's alright

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:31.620 
short but that's alright
and<00:06:24.810> then<00:06:25.020> to<00:06:25.320> the<00:06:25.470> direction<00:06:26.010> five<00:06:26.280> volts

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:31.630 

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:35.220 

okay<00:06:32.230> so<00:06:32.650> my<00:06:33.010> driver<00:06:33.670> is<00:06:33.820> wired<00:06:34.300> for<00:06:34.450> the

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:35.230 
okay so my driver is wired for the

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:37.800 
okay so my driver is wired for the
signal<00:06:35.650> pulse<00:06:35.980> and<00:06:36.250> the<00:06:36.730> signal<00:06:37.090> direction<00:06:37.630> or

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:06.010 
ground here to the driver and it will be

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:08.880 
ground here to the driver and it will be
to<00:07:06.220> the<00:07:06.340> VCC<00:07:06.910> plus<00:07:07.420> here<00:07:07.900> and<00:07:08.050> ground<00:07:08.590> I'm

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:08.890 
to the VCC plus here and ground I'm

00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:10.800 
to the VCC plus here and ground I'm
going<00:07:09.160> to<00:07:09.220> be<00:07:09.310> using<00:07:09.670> wire<00:07:10.120> that<00:07:10.330> has<00:07:10.480> a<00:07:10.510> little

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:10.810 
going to be using wire that has a little

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:12.870 
going to be using wire that has a little
bit<00:07:10.900> more<00:07:11.140> thickness<00:07:11.590> to<00:07:11.980> it<00:07:12.010> so<00:07:12.430> it<00:07:12.580> would<00:07:12.760> be

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:12.880 
bit more thickness to it so it would be

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:15.030 
bit more thickness to it so it would be
able<00:07:13.030> to<00:07:13.120> carry<00:07:13.330> the<00:07:13.510> amps<00:07:13.810> that<00:07:14.080> this<00:07:14.500> motor

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:15.040 
able to carry the amps that this motor

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:17.160 
able to carry the amps that this motor
and<00:07:15.370> driver<00:07:15.640> will<00:07:15.850> draw<00:07:16.060> and<00:07:16.360> I<00:07:16.630> believe<00:07:16.960> this

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:17.170 
and driver will draw and I believe this

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:22.020 
and driver will draw and I believe this
is<00:07:17.230> close<00:07:18.130> to<00:07:18.520> 16<00:07:19.510> maybe<00:07:20.020> 18<00:07:20.530> gauge<00:07:20.890> so<00:07:21.400> I'll<00:07:21.850> be

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:22.030 
is close to 16 maybe 18 gauge so I'll be

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:23.310 
is close to 16 maybe 18 gauge so I'll be
using<00:07:22.150> that<00:07:22.330> the<00:07:22.600> first<00:07:22.810> thing<00:07:22.990> I'm<00:07:23.170> going<00:07:23.260> to

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:23.320 
using that the first thing I'm going to

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:26.400 
using that the first thing I'm going to
also<00:07:23.440> use<00:07:23.590> two<00:07:24.490> different<00:07:24.610> colors<00:07:24.880> so<00:07:25.600> I<00:07:26.140> can

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:26.410 
also use two different colors so I can

00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:28.770 
also use two different colors so I can
distinguish<00:07:26.770> between<00:07:26.830> what<00:07:27.580> is<00:07:27.670> plus<00:07:28.000> voltage

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:28.780 
distinguish between what is plus voltage

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:31.410 
distinguish between what is plus voltage
and<00:07:29.080> what<00:07:29.380> is<00:07:29.560> ground<00:07:30.100> the<00:07:30.760> black<00:07:30.970> will<00:07:31.120> be<00:07:31.150> for

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:31.420 
and what is ground the black will be for

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:33.420 
and what is ground the black will be for
ground<00:07:31.630> and<00:07:31.870> the<00:07:31.990> white<00:07:32.320> will<00:07:32.470> be<00:07:32.590> for<00:07:32.860> for

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:33.430 
ground and the white will be for for

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:39.890 
ground and the white will be for for
plus<00:07:33.700> voltage

00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:39.900 

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:42.260 

make<00:07:40.650> sure<00:07:40.830> that<00:07:41.010> you<00:07:41.130> have<00:07:41.370> the<00:07:41.669> power<00:07:42.090> supply

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:42.270 
make sure that you have the power supply

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:44.000 
make sure that you have the power supply
off<00:07:42.660> and<00:07:42.990> unplugged<00:07:43.440> where<00:07:43.650> you<00:07:43.740> do<00:07:43.860> this

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:44.010 
off and unplugged where you do this

00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:46.310 
off and unplugged where you do this
since<00:07:44.370> your<00:07:44.790> hands<00:07:45.360> will<00:07:45.570> be<00:07:45.690> close<00:07:45.960> to<00:07:46.169> the

00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:46.320 
since your hands will be close to the

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:55.360 
since your hands will be close to the
wall<00:07:47.280> voltage

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:55.370 

00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:57.670 

you

00:07:57.670 --> 00:07:57.680 

00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:00.340 

okay<00:07:58.220> so<00:07:58.280> now<00:07:58.639> we<00:07:58.699> have<00:07:58.880> power<00:07:59.180> to<00:07:59.510> the<00:07:59.720> driver

00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:00.350 
okay so now we have power to the driver

00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:02.469 
okay so now we have power to the driver
the<00:08:00.680> only<00:08:00.860> thing<00:08:01.010> we<00:08:01.100> need<00:08:01.220> to<00:08:01.370> do<00:08:01.490> is<00:08:01.760> connect

00:08:02.469 --> 00:08:02.479 
the only thing we need to do is connect

00:08:02.479 --> 00:08:05.889 
the only thing we need to do is connect
the<00:08:02.540> four<00:08:03.290> motor<00:08:03.620> wires
