00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:02.880
 to 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.170
 with this experiment we do 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:19.890
 see how to always grow a 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:22.500
 look at this experiment we will use 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.680
 different types of legumes including chickpeas 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:28.769
 lentil beans borlotti beans 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.460
 whites will also serve a saucer of 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:34.500
 plastic some water cotton 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:37.830
 then continue the experiment we must 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.589
 put the cotton in the put saucer 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:46.340
 of cotton follows of small groups of 

00:00:40.589 --> 00:00:46.340
 lemons now that of goods 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.590
 or that the means 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.230
 at the end of traveling the whites 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:14.600
 and now they want to put this on 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.600
 cotton and bathe it with a little water 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:30.180
 now follow day by day the 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.180
 growth of this plant 

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:15.319
 this situation after 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:20.940
 as you can see in this period 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.430
 have developed have developed 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.530
 roots 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:27.650
 a place 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:32.540
 this point the only way to destroyed 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:35.420
 and among the plants 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:38.020
 the experiment determined a greeting a 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.020
