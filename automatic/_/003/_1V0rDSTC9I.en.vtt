the<00:00:07.259> impact<00:00:07.859> of<00:00:08.160> screens<00:00:09.059> on<00:00:09.480> sleep<00:00:10.550> you<00:00:11.550> know

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
the impact of screens on sleep you know

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.379 
the impact of screens on sleep you know
people<00:00:12.090> are<00:00:12.300> exposing<00:00:12.870> their<00:00:13.349> eyes<00:00:13.820> to<00:00:14.820> this

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
people are exposing their eyes to this

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.960 
people are exposing their eyes to this
stream<00:00:15.929> of<00:00:15.960> photons<00:00:16.650> from<00:00:17.190> these<00:00:17.430> objects

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
stream of photons from these objects

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.150 
stream of photons from these objects
that<00:00:18.480> basically<00:00:19.050> tells<00:00:19.470> your<00:00:19.650> brain

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
that basically tells your brain

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.160 
that basically tells your brain
stay<00:00:20.699> awake<00:00:21.029> it's<00:00:21.330> not<00:00:21.510> time<00:00:21.750> to<00:00:21.869> go<00:00:21.960> to<00:00:22.020> sleep

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
stay awake it's not time to go to sleep

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.730
