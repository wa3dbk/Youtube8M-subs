00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:29.030
 Hello, stuffed website health decoration 

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:32.540
 in Portugal 

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:36.650
 I'll be talking about diet today. 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:41.210
 Paleolithic to Paleolithic Diet 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:43.760
 in comes the concept that we should eat 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:46.550
 diet that our ancestors 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:49.580
 the paleolithic period until 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:51.920
 literally the Neolithic period to the 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:54.440
 period of the size of the 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:57.380
 grains and domesticated animals ie 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:01.760
 before 10 thousand years ago we did not 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:05.030
 we had how to consume milk grains 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:11.780
 legumes and therefore we consume 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:15.110
 before the sight of them meat eggs fruit 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:17.090
 vegetable nuts and nuts 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:20.570
 the paleolithic diet is usually a 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.770
 only cross diet that also has its version 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:26.600
 cooked 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:29.660
 So we have to understand the 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.340
 Paleolithic diet is really natural is 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:34.310
 of the human being 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:37.039
 literally devour a living animal like 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:39.649
 The other carnivorous animals of the 

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:43.300
 of the human being 

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:46.640
 consuming eggs in their in natura form is 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:49.280
 Pleasing to think of jumping up 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:52.459
 from a rabbit kid or from a 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:55.220
 cow and start killing her teeth until 

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:58.520
 consume consume consume the meat is O and 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:01.670
 thinking of the man of prehistory who 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:04.759
 did not have the ability to take the 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:08.899
 leather take blood from animal lim father 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:11.510
 he cut into small pieces 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.700
 and do all that we do with the flesh 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.220
 to make it palatable is that it 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:19.720
 really natural we consume cars 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:23.060
 if we look at modern anthropology 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:25.790
 current anthropology who has been what 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:28.340
 has been discovered 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.890
 many anthropologists like Jaime where the 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:34.540
 perhaps the most famous trophy in the world in 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:37.840
 another stage wrote a hunted man 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:40.010
 man the run it a book in english 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:43.400
 showing various evidences 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:46.159
 that all 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.409
 evidence that human bones of 

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:51.560
 fossils of other animals indicate that 

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:53.840
 human beings have been throughout the 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:56.510
 a large part of our virtually all 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:03:00.620
 the assistance actually knocked us out 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:03.079
 We are easily the prey of animals. 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.900
 hague larger carnivorous animals 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:07.760
 we and we did not really have 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.609
 hunt as the daily the times 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:13.419
 it shows the last hunting tribe and 

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:16.849
 collector of the world not if I owe in his 

00:03:13.419 --> 00:03:18.409
 documentary great years in sil that is the 

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:22.220
 his book name 

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:25.549
 it shows that an extremely 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:27.409
 of very strong black men are 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:29.569
 go out hunting and sometimes return without 

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:32.750
 meat on the day when the 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:35.750
 their equipment and their equipment. 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:39.349
 him to hunt explain site is very 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:41.810
 more modern than our evolved 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:43.519
 paleolithic ancestors 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:45.799
 break this idea is even it being 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:49.750
 anthropologists the book he breaks the 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:52.220
 concept that we were in truth 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:54.709
 meat eaters in excess 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:56.329
 he shows that it is rare for this tribe to be 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:58.849
 a hunting tribe collecting the 

00:03:56.329 --> 00:04:01.639
 current time consuming meat in the forest 

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:04.340
 why hit an arrow with a harpoon 

00:04:01.639 --> 00:04:08.989
 vegetarian animal running high 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:11.329
 speed is very difficult then the 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:13.370
 is that it would be natural to consume the 

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:15.949
 food without ever having an entire 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:18.829
 I do not believe that change 

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:22.009
 eggs would be natural and easily 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:24.919
 Find a stolen animal and animal egg 

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:27.440
 or simply let her be stolen 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:30.530
 son be stolen so you there was April 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:34.639
 consume with natural taste that people 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:37.610
 You would not know how to temper good by pulling 

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:38.520
 this fact has several other criteria 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:41.060
 that we have 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.449
 with it considered a paleolithic diet 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:46.199
 huh 

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:48.300
 one is unsustainable environmental age already 

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:51.270
 that we know that the more expensive the 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:52.560
 people currently consume because they are 18 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:54.629
 millions of people 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:57.180
 we cause an imbalance 

00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:59.879
 environment as an increase in the production of 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:03.870
 greenhouse gases pollution of the 

00:04:59.879 --> 00:05:06.720
 our of our lakes from our sheets 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:10.110
 groundwater due to yields 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:12.690
 animal faeces among several not to the 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:14.310
 excessive water expenditure since they are 15 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:17.130
 thousand liters of water to produce a 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:18.960
 pound of meat among countless others 

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:22.319
 environmental problems that cause 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:24.690
 that leads people to understand that a 

00:05:22.319 --> 00:05:27.840
 diet is a diet rich in products 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:31.229
 animals a diet of meat and eggs is not 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:33.389
 capable of being sustained environmentally 

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:35.930
 in today's modern world world 

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:37.830
 which tends to increase 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:39.319
 immeasurably its population in 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:43.130
 some of them 

00:05:39.319 --> 00:05:47.940
 and also has unsustainability 

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:49.949
 because we know that it is diverse 

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:52.319
 in number of technological research 

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:54.659
 prove that the consumption of animal products 

00:05:52.319 --> 00:05:56.969
 is highly correlated with 

00:05:54.659 --> 00:05:59.789
 chronic degenerative diseases such as 

00:05:56.969 --> 00:06:01.139
 diabetes osteoporosis cancer diseases 

00:05:59.789 --> 00:06:03.960
 cardiovascular 

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:06.599
 all are linked with the consumption of 

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:10.529
 animal products meat milk eggs and 

00:06:06.599 --> 00:06:12.479
 still another criterion since within the 

00:06:10.529 --> 00:06:15.740
 cities as we have today in 

00:06:12.479 --> 00:06:20.669
 day a Paleolithic diet is actually 

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:24.029
 a sustainable not only pro in 

00:06:20.669 --> 00:06:27.750
 transportation criteria have you 

00:06:24.029 --> 00:06:30.479
 actually freeze the food at least 

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:33.539
 cool car not to ruin yourself 

00:06:30.479 --> 00:06:36.090
 You do not have like our ancestors. 

00:06:33.539 --> 00:06:38.699
 animals would be running in the 

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:40.449
 forest and you would literally kill 

00:06:38.699 --> 00:06:43.219
 them and consume 

00:06:40.449 --> 00:06:45.709
 You remember a big city, you did not. 

00:06:43.219 --> 00:06:47.239
 It has these animal food 

00:06:45.709 --> 00:06:49.489
 a practical way as our 

00:06:47.239 --> 00:06:51.559
 ancestors would have taken away the 

00:06:49.489 --> 00:06:54.169
 criteria that we will talk about in the 

00:06:51.559 --> 00:06:57.429
 next video in part 2 in this video 

00:06:54.169 --> 00:07:00.080
 but I hope you have enjoyed

 direct mail from the blog site register 

00:07:02.809 --> 00:07:07.789
 what a youtube channel on the like 

00:07:05.539 --> 00:07:11.569
 facebook shows the comments here in 

00:07:07.789 --> 00:07:13.189
 Come down and share with us if 

00:07:11.569 --> 00:07:15.379
 Do you really think that a diet 

00:07:13.189 --> 00:07:17.269
 Paleolithic is natural human being 

00:07:15.379 --> 00:07:20.240
 if you really think you can 

00:07:17.269 --> 00:07:23.449
 eat raw meat and if it would 

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:26.209
 really b raw meat eggs of your form 

00:07:23.449 --> 00:07:28.069
 without salt without seasoning without 

00:07:26.209 --> 00:07:30.409
 no change because that is how 

00:07:28.069 --> 00:07:34.069
 our ancestors would eat and 

00:07:30.409 --> 00:07:36.800
 Do you want to follow the concept of eating with 

00:07:34.069 --> 00:07:38.809
 our Paleolithic ancestors you 

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:40.939
 have to eat the meat in the way the 

00:07:38.809 --> 00:07:43.699
 animals carlinhos cecconi in the way that 

00:07:40.939 --> 00:07:46.459
 would be natural in nature 

00:07:43.699 --> 00:07:48.800
 So you liked the video? 

00:07:46.459 --> 00:07:51.889
 share tell me if you really 

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:54.529
 thinks that an ideal Paleolithic diet and 

00:07:51.889 --> 00:07:56.360
 until the next video until the second 

00:07:54.529 --> 00:07:58.279
 sequence that we are going to talk about 

00:07:56.360 --> 00:08:00.439
 pros and cons and some more details of 

00:07:58.279 --> 00:08:02.529
 Paleolithic diet is the next 

00:08:00.439 --> 00:08:02.529
 legislature
