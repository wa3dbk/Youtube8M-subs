00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:45.220 

let's<00:03:42.950> take<00:03:43.099> a<00:03:43.129> look<00:03:43.340> at<00:03:43.430> me<00:03:43.580> she<00:03:44.170> starts<00:03:45.170> at

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230 
let's take a look at me she starts at

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:48.390 
let's take a look at me she starts at
level<00:03:45.470> 10<00:03:45.709> and<00:03:46.010> has<00:03:46.250> decent<00:03:46.519> attack<00:03:46.849> power

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
level 10 and has decent attack power

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.759 
level 10 and has decent attack power
above<00:03:49.400> the<00:03:49.580> expected<00:03:50.000> level<00:03:50.840> defense<00:03:51.230> and

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:51.769 
above the expected level defense and

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:53.920 
above the expected level defense and
agility<00:03:52.069> good<00:03:52.879> movement<00:03:53.120> so<00:03:53.510> she<00:03:53.569> can<00:03:53.810> move

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
agility good movement so she can move

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:56.670 
agility good movement so she can move
pretty<00:03:54.830> far<00:03:55.040> in<00:03:55.220> a<00:03:55.250> single<00:03:55.550> turn

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
pretty far in a single turn

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:08.680 
pretty far in a single turn
very<00:03:57.680> nice<00:03:57.860> overalls

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:08.690 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:11.020 

yeah<00:04:09.230> like<00:04:09.650> I<00:04:09.740> said<00:04:09.770> before<00:04:10.070> counter-attacks

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.030 
yeah like I said before counter-attacks

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.090 
yeah like I said before counter-attacks
and<00:04:11.240> second<00:04:11.540> attacks<00:04:11.840> have<00:04:12.230> reduced<00:04:12.530> power<00:04:12.770> to

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:13.100 
and second attacks have reduced power to

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:18.650 
and second attacks have reduced power to
them<00:04:13.280> so<00:04:13.780> don't<00:04:14.780> worry<00:04:14.900> too<00:04:15.020> much<00:04:15.140> about<00:04:15.290> those

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.690 

actually<00:04:19.500> I<00:04:19.530> think<00:04:19.650> I<00:04:19.860> want<00:04:19.980> somebody<00:04:20.400> else

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700 
actually I think I want somebody else

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:33.480 
actually I think I want somebody else
have<00:04:20.910> that<00:04:21.150> kill<00:04:22.250> Jason<00:04:23.250> baby<00:04:24.800> you<00:04:25.800> do<00:04:26.010> it

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:33.490
