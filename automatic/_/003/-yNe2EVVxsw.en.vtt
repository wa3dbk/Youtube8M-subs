going to load the items you're gonna

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.750 
going to load the items you're gonna
have<00:00:45.930> a<00:00:45.960> block<00:00:46.260> right<00:00:46.620> here<00:00:46.680> behind<00:00:47.489> that

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
have a block right here behind that

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.330 
have a block right here behind that
powered<00:00:48.329> rail<00:00:48.600> and<00:00:48.899> a<00:00:49.320> comparator<00:00:49.860> coming<00:00:50.160> out

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
powered rail and a comparator coming out

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.750 
powered rail and a comparator coming out
of<00:00:50.579> this<00:00:51.000> hopper<00:00:51.600> this<00:00:52.410> comparator<00:00:53.399> needs<00:00:53.610> to

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
of this hopper this comparator needs to

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.450 
of this hopper this comparator needs to
be<00:00:53.850> going<00:00:54.090> into<00:00:54.270> a<00:00:54.420> block<00:00:54.809> with<00:00:55.469> a<00:00:55.500> torch<00:00:56.190> on

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
be going into a block with a torch on

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.779 
be going into a block with a torch on
the<00:00:56.520> side<00:00:56.670> like<00:00:57.420> that<00:00:57.500> now<00:00:58.500> you<00:00:58.559> just<00:00:59.250> need<00:00:59.340> two

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
the side like that now you just need two

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.939 
the side like that now you just need two
blocks<00:01:00.149> coming<00:01:00.539> out<00:01:00.840> from<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.559> block<00:01:01.739> with<00:01:01.920> a

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
blocks coming out from the block with a

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.160 
blocks coming out from the block with a
comparator<00:01:02.370> on<00:01:02.489> top<00:01:02.730> redstone<00:01:03.629> dust<00:01:03.870> right

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
comparator on top redstone dust right

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.370 
comparator on top redstone dust right
there<00:01:04.409> and<00:01:04.650> a<00:01:05.489> repeater<00:01:06.270> going<00:01:06.689> into<00:01:07.080> this

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
there and a repeater going into this

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.380 
there and a repeater going into this
block<00:01:07.830> that's<00:01:08.430> it<00:01:08.700> guys<00:01:08.939> that's<00:01:09.240> the

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
block that's it guys that's the

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.520 
block that's it guys that's the
automatic<00:01:09.600> loading<00:01:10.380> now<00:01:11.010> on<00:01:11.280> to<00:01:11.729> the

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.530 
automatic loading now on to the

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.200 
automatic loading now on to the
unloading<00:01:13.530> so<00:01:13.950> you<00:01:14.040> again<00:01:14.520> you<00:01:14.700> just<00:01:14.880> have<00:01:15.000> a

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
unloading so you again you just have a

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.020 
unloading so you again you just have a
hopper<00:01:16.200> going<00:01:16.530> into<00:01:16.890> a<00:01:16.920> chest<00:01:17.460> your

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
hopper going into a chest your

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.789 
hopper going into a chest your
destination<00:01:18.780> chest<00:01:19.020> and<00:01:19.200> you're<00:01:19.290> gonna<00:01:19.409> put<00:01:19.650> a

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
destination chest and you're gonna put a

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.770 
destination chest and you're gonna put a
powered<00:01:20.490> rail<00:01:20.520> on<00:01:20.970> top<00:01:21.150> of<00:01:21.270> that<00:01:21.360> hopper<00:01:21.750> you

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780
