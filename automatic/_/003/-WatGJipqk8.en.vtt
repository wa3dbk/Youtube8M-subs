00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
why are you using those fast planes now

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.369 
why are you using those fast planes now
instead<00:00:45.329> of<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:46.559> magic<00:00:46.710> blades<00:00:48.289> do<00:00:49.289> they

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
instead of the the magic blades do they

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:50.990 
instead of the the magic blades do they
do<00:00:49.559> more<00:00:49.680> damage<00:00:49.739> you<00:00:50.370> just<00:00:50.610> like<00:00:50.730> where<00:00:50.910> they

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
do more damage you just like where they

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.410 
do more damage you just like where they
look<00:00:51.469> these<00:00:52.469> ones<00:00:52.890> I'm<00:00:53.219> using<00:00:53.250> on<00:00:53.789> that<00:00:53.969> enemy

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
look these ones I'm using on that enemy

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.209 
look these ones I'm using on that enemy
type<00:00:54.660> because<00:00:55.110> it<00:00:55.260> lifts<00:00:55.590> them<00:00:55.770> off<00:00:56.010> the

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
type because it lifts them off the

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.410 
type because it lifts them off the
ground<00:00:56.460> oh<00:00:56.789> whereas<00:00:57.480> you<00:00:57.600> cannot<00:00:57.840> grab<00:00:58.140> them

00:00:59.410 --> 00:00:59.420 
ground oh whereas you cannot grab them

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:06.460 
ground oh whereas you cannot grab them

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
you unlocked were they were they the

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.140 
you unlocked were they were they the
block<00:01:28.770> moves<00:01:29.100> that<00:01:29.310> you<00:01:29.400> never<00:01:29.580> use<00:01:29.850> by

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
block moves that you never use by

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.550 
block moves that you never use by
holding<00:01:30.480> block<00:01:30.690> and<00:01:30.900> then<00:01:30.990> tapping<00:01:31.170> square

yeah<00:01:34.080> seldomly<00:01:34.560> I<00:01:34.890> guess<00:01:35.400> more<00:01:36.270> frequently<00:01:36.660> on

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
yeah seldomly I guess more frequently on

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.420 
yeah seldomly I guess more frequently on
accident<00:01:37.320> than<00:01:37.500> intentionally<00:01:38.100> mhm<00:01:39.590> so<00:01:40.590> if

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
accident than intentionally mhm so if

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.040 
accident than intentionally mhm so if
you<00:01:41.580> can<00:01:41.730> get<00:01:41.940> if<00:01:42.150> you<00:01:42.240> can<00:01:42.330> lure<00:01:42.540> these<00:01:42.780> guys

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:43.050 
you can get if you can lure these guys

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.090

away from this statue guy you can do

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.150 
away from this statue guy you can do
some<00:01:47.280> damage<00:01:47.460> with<00:01:47.670> your<00:01:48.060> nemesis<00:01:48.780> whip<00:01:48.990> I

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:52.160 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.410 

take<00:01:53.160> it<00:01:53.250> that<00:01:53.340> they<00:01:53.490> can't<00:01:53.730> hit<00:01:53.910> you<00:01:54.120> while

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
take it that they can't hit you while

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.780 
take it that they can't hit you while
you're<00:01:54.600> in<00:01:54.690> the<00:01:54.780> air<00:01:54.930> that's<00:01:55.800> why<00:01:56.010> it's<00:01:56.220> you

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
you're in the air that's why it's you

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.240 
you're in the air that's why it's you
keep<00:01:56.970> doing<00:01:57.240> it<00:01:57.360> um<00:01:57.900> oh<00:01:57.960> well<00:01:58.620> you<00:01:58.950> just<00:01:59.130> did

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
keep doing it um oh well you just did

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.600 
keep doing it um oh well you just did
right<00:01:59.280> there<00:01:59.580> yeah<00:02:01.160> usually<00:02:02.160> it<00:02:02.250> knocks<00:02:02.460> them

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
right there yeah usually it knocks them

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.360 
right there yeah usually it knocks them
up<00:02:02.730> high<00:02:02.940> enough<00:02:03.210> where<00:02:03.990> he<00:02:04.110> can't<00:02:04.350> reach<00:02:04.620> mmm

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:05.370 
up high enough where he can't reach mmm

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:08.000 
up high enough where he can't reach mmm
but<00:02:05.700> I<00:02:06.200> don't<00:02:07.200> know<00:02:07.260> it's<00:02:07.410> a<00:02:07.440> good<00:02:07.590> way<00:02:07.710> to<00:02:07.770> take

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:08.010 
but I don't know it's a good way to take

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:09.290 
but I don't know it's a good way to take
care<00:02:08.250> of<00:02:08.310> those<00:02:08.399> guys<00:02:08.490> I<00:02:08.790> guess<00:02:08.940> a<00:02:08.970> more

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
care of those guys I guess a more

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.820 
care of those guys I guess a more
effective<00:02:09.600> way<00:02:09.929> that<00:02:09.960> I<00:02:10.230> could<00:02:10.470> have<00:02:10.560> done

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
effective way that I could have done

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.820 
effective way that I could have done
right<00:02:11.430> there<00:02:11.670> would<00:02:12.420> have<00:02:12.480> been<00:02:12.660> to<00:02:12.780> use<00:02:12.960> my

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:20.500 

block<00:02:16.830> and<00:02:17.100> then<00:02:17.190> parry<00:02:18.080> block<00:02:19.080> out<00:02:19.290> encounter

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
block and then parry block out encounter

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.120 
block and then parry block out encounter
so<00:02:21.510> does<00:02:21.630> it<00:02:21.750> take<00:02:21.930> two<00:02:22.170> grabs<00:02:22.530> and<00:02:22.800> these<00:02:22.920> guys

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
so does it take two grabs and these guys

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.130 
so does it take two grabs and these guys

second time through the game but these

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:27.040 
second time through the game but these
guys<00:04:22.759> are<00:04:22.940> tough<00:04:23.949> mainly<00:04:24.949> because<00:04:25.130> you<00:04:26.050> can

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.050

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:27.330 
okay right here see that pathway to the

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:29.210 
okay right here see that pathway to the
right<00:05:27.570> mm-hmm<00:05:28.290> don't<00:05:28.590> go<00:05:28.770> through<00:05:29.040> there
