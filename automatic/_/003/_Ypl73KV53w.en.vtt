00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.380 
to come in there needs to be these very
basic<00:02:08.140> projects

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.800 

here's<00:02:13.170> an<00:02:13.350> example<00:02:13.650> of<00:02:14.010> Finnish<00:02:14.700> road<00:02:15.030> this

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
here's an example of Finnish road this

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.720 
here's an example of Finnish road this
road<00:02:16.110> was<00:02:16.290> finished<00:02:16.650> about<00:02:16.860> a<00:02:16.920> month<00:02:17.160> ago<00:02:17.340> by

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
road was finished about a month ago by

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.850 
road was finished about a month ago by
the<00:02:17.880> Armenia<00:02:18.420> fund<00:02:18.690> and<00:02:18.959> obviously<00:02:19.590> you<00:02:19.680> can

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
see the difference I mean here there is

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.540 
see the difference I mean here there is
life<00:02:21.660> there's<00:02:21.990> movement<00:02:22.319> people<00:02:23.130> can<00:02:23.280> move

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
life there's movement people can move

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.640 
life there's movement people can move
back<00:02:23.760> and<00:02:23.819> forth<00:02:24.300> and<00:02:24.540> that's<00:02:24.990> really<00:02:25.260> what

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
back and forth and that's really what

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.440 
back and forth and that's really what
the<00:02:25.980> core<00:02:26.220> infrastructure<00:02:26.400> projects<00:02:27.270> are
