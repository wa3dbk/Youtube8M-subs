00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
today's assembly instructions are gonna

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.110 
today's assembly instructions are gonna
be<00:00:09.240> over<00:00:09.480> the<00:00:09.599> QL<00:00:09.930> 1000<00:00:11.179> this<00:00:12.179> is<00:00:12.389> a<00:00:12.709> continuous

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.630 
be over the QL 1000 this is a continuous
halogen<00:00:15.120> light<00:00:15.269> that<00:00:15.480> we<00:00:15.570> have<00:00:16.280> so<00:00:17.280> I'm<00:00:17.550> gonna

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
halogen light that we have so I'm gonna

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.670 
halogen light that we have so I'm gonna
show<00:00:17.880> you<00:00:17.910> how<00:00:18.120> to<00:00:18.180> put<00:00:18.480> a<00:00:18.690> reflector<00:00:19.289> on<00:00:19.320> this

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
show you how to put a reflector on this

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.610 
show you how to put a reflector on this
put<00:00:20.130> it<00:00:20.220> on<00:00:20.310> a<00:00:20.340> stand<00:00:20.670> use<00:00:21.090> a<00:00:21.120> softbox<00:00:21.690> or<00:00:22.500> an

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:22.620 
put it on a stand use a softbox or an

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.520 
put it on a stand use a softbox or an
umbrella<00:00:23.300> and<00:00:24.300> we'll<00:00:24.510> start<00:00:24.840> with<00:00:25.020> the<00:00:25.290> bulb

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:25.530 
umbrella and we'll start with the bulb

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:27.140 
umbrella and we'll start with the bulb
so<00:00:25.920> what<00:00:26.220> you're<00:00:26.370> gonna<00:00:26.460> do<00:00:26.760> is<00:00:26.910> you're<00:00:27.090> gonna

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
so what you're gonna do is you're gonna

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.470 
so what you're gonna do is you're gonna
notice<00:00:27.480> this<00:00:27.810> little<00:00:28.110> cover<00:00:29.420> there's<00:00:30.420> a

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
notice this little cover there's a

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.330 
notice this little cover there's a
little<00:00:31.320> lever<00:00:31.590> right<00:00:31.740> here

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
little lever right here

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.880 
little lever right here
well<00:00:33.149> shiny<00:00:33.450> lever<00:00:33.750> so<00:00:34.350> when<00:00:34.469> you<00:00:34.559> pull<00:00:34.770> that

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
well shiny lever so when you pull that

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.250 
well shiny lever so when you pull that
down<00:00:34.950> it<00:00:35.370> opens<00:00:35.700> up<00:00:35.879> the<00:00:36.449> ability<00:00:36.690> to<00:00:36.929> turn

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
down it opens up the ability to turn

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.569 
down it opens up the ability to turn
anything<00:00:37.739> in<00:00:37.859> here<00:00:38.039> whether<00:00:38.190> it's<00:00:38.429> the

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
anything in here whether it's the

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.090 
anything in here whether it's the
reflector<00:00:39.120> or<00:00:39.269> this<00:00:39.480> cap<00:00:39.780> so<00:00:40.079> you're<00:00:40.980> just

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
reflector or this cap so you're just

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.959 
reflector or this cap so you're just
gonna<00:00:41.249> turn<00:00:41.909> it<00:00:42.059> until<00:00:42.420> these<00:00:43.820> things<00:00:44.820> will

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
gonna turn it until these things will

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.660 
gonna turn it until these things will
slide<00:00:45.179> out<00:00:45.440> and<00:00:46.440> then<00:00:47.039> now<00:00:47.190> you're<00:00:47.339> ready<00:00:47.519> for

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
slide out and then now you're ready for

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.049 
slide out and then now you're ready for
the<00:00:47.789> bulb<00:00:48.030> so<00:00:49.399> what<00:00:50.399> you're<00:00:50.550> gonna<00:00:50.609> do<00:00:50.909> is<00:00:51.030> take

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
the bulb so what you're gonna do is take

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.099 
the bulb so what you're gonna do is take
your<00:00:51.420> 1000<00:00:52.050> watt<00:00:52.199> halogen<00:00:52.469> bulb<00:00:53.899> and<00:00:54.899> then

00:00:55.099 --> 00:00:55.109 
your 1000 watt halogen bulb and then

00:00:55.109 --> 00:00:56.719 
your 1000 watt halogen bulb and then
make<00:00:55.289> sure<00:00:55.319> you<00:00:55.649> don't<00:00:55.859> touch<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.489> bulb

00:00:56.719 --> 00:00:56.729 
make sure you don't touch the bulb

00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:59.059 
make sure you don't touch the bulb
that's<00:00:56.969> very<00:00:57.300> important<00:00:57.809> with<00:00:57.929> these<00:00:58.140> because

00:00:59.059 --> 00:00:59.069 
that's very important with these because

00:00:59.069 --> 00:01:00.619 
that's very important with these because
actually<00:00:59.550> something<00:00:59.909> can<00:01:00.059> happen<00:01:00.210> with<00:01:00.510> the

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
actually something can happen with the

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.020 
actually something can happen with the
oils<00:01:00.960> of<00:01:01.140> your<00:01:01.260> fingers<00:01:01.679> and<00:01:02.069> if<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:02.850> lights

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
oils of your fingers and if the lights

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.200 
oils of your fingers and if the lights
on<00:01:03.210> too<00:01:03.389> long<00:01:04.129> the<00:01:05.129> bulbs<00:01:05.400> can<00:01:05.610> actually<00:01:05.940> break

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
on too long the bulbs can actually break

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.380 
on too long the bulbs can actually break
so<00:01:06.810> never<00:01:07.020> touch<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.440> glass<00:01:08.119> but<00:01:09.119> with<00:01:09.240> this

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
so never touch the glass but with this

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:10.999 
so never touch the glass but with this
one<00:01:09.570> it<00:01:09.689> has<00:01:09.750> a<00:01:09.810> big<00:01:10.110> base<00:01:10.380> so<00:01:10.680> it's<00:01:10.829> actually

00:01:10.999 --> 00:01:11.009 
one it has a big base so it's actually

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:12.740 
one it has a big base so it's actually
easy<00:01:11.310> just<00:01:11.579> to<00:01:11.759> slide<00:01:12.000> it<00:01:12.119> in<00:01:12.180> just<00:01:12.420> like<00:01:12.540> that

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
easy just to slide it in just like that

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.410 
easy just to slide it in just like that
without<00:01:13.320> touching<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.979> glass<00:01:14.240> so<00:01:15.240> now<00:01:15.360> that

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
without touching the glass so now that

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.730 
without touching the glass so now that
you<00:01:15.600> have<00:01:15.750> that<00:01:15.780> I'll<00:01:16.079> show<00:01:16.200> you<00:01:16.259> how<00:01:16.469> to<00:01:16.560> put

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
you have that I'll show you how to put

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.670 
you have that I'll show you how to put
the<00:01:16.860> reflector<00:01:17.310> on<00:01:18.229> one<00:01:19.229> thing<00:01:19.409> that<00:01:19.560> you're

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
the reflector on one thing that you're

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.190 
the reflector on one thing that you're
gonna<00:01:19.799> notice<00:01:20.070> is<00:01:20.460> this<00:01:20.610> little<00:01:20.670> slit<00:01:21.299> this<00:01:22.049> is

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
gonna notice is this little slit this is

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.230 
gonna notice is this little slit this is
for<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.530> umbrella<00:01:22.890> so<00:01:23.670> what<00:01:23.789> you're<00:01:23.909> gonna<00:01:23.969> do

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
for the umbrella so what you're gonna do

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.330 
for the umbrella so what you're gonna do
is<00:01:24.390> hold<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.719> light<00:01:24.930> and<00:01:25.140> hold<00:01:25.649> the<00:01:25.799> reflector

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
is hold the light and hold the reflector

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.149 
is hold the light and hold the reflector
and<00:01:26.520> then<00:01:27.119> you're<00:01:27.270> going<00:01:27.360> to<00:01:27.420> take<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.899> bottom

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:28.159 
and then you're going to take the bottom

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:34.300 
and then you're going to take the bottom
peg<00:01:29.159> and<00:01:29.630> slide<00:01:30.630> it<00:01:30.840> into<00:01:31.320> that<00:01:32.030> and<00:01:33.079> turn<00:01:34.079> it

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
peg and slide it into that and turn it

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.770 
peg and slide it into that and turn it
so<00:01:35.310> now<00:01:35.460> you<00:01:35.520> can<00:01:35.789> see<00:01:36.030> that<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.329> slits<00:01:36.600> on<00:01:36.750> the

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
so now you can see that the slits on the

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.539 
so now you can see that the slits on the
bottom<00:01:37.170> so<00:01:37.380> you<00:01:37.439> can<00:01:37.710> slide<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.159> umbrella

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
bottom so you can slide the umbrella

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.179 
bottom so you can slide the umbrella
through<00:01:38.939> there<00:01:39.439> and<00:01:40.439> then<00:01:40.649> this<00:01:40.799> is<00:01:41.009> gonna

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
through there and then this is gonna

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.880 
through there and then this is gonna
hold<00:01:41.430> it<00:01:41.579> in<00:01:41.700> place<00:01:41.909> so<00:01:42.329> that<00:01:43.140> you<00:01:43.409> can't<00:01:43.649> turn

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
hold it in place so that you can't turn

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.340 
hold it in place so that you can't turn
it<00:01:44.750> obviously<00:01:45.750> we're<00:01:45.899> going<00:01:45.990> to<00:01:46.079> throw<00:01:46.229> this

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
it obviously we're going to throw this

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:53.779 
it obviously we're going to throw this
on<00:01:46.560> a<00:01:46.590> stand<00:01:46.920> so<00:01:49.280> this<00:01:51.020> big<00:01:52.020> wheel<00:01:52.789> loosens

00:01:53.779 --> 00:01:53.789 
on a stand so this big wheel loosens

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:57.370 
on a stand so this big wheel loosens
this<00:01:54.000> up<00:01:54.210> you<00:01:55.049> can<00:01:55.170> turn<00:01:55.350> it<00:01:55.500> down

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
this up you can turn it down

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.600 
this up you can turn it down
and<00:01:57.830> then<00:01:58.100> this<00:01:59.140> loosens<00:02:00.140> that<00:02:00.290> up<00:02:00.619> and<00:02:01.130> then

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
and then this loosens that up and then

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:03.940 
and then this loosens that up and then
you<00:02:01.700> can<00:02:01.880> tighten<00:02:02.090> it<00:02:02.270> onto<00:02:02.689> a<00:02:02.720> stand<00:02:03.140> and<00:02:03.799> then

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
you can tighten it onto a stand and then

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.499 
you can tighten it onto a stand and then
you<00:02:04.100> can<00:02:04.250> use<00:02:04.400> the<00:02:04.549> wheel<00:02:04.700> to<00:02:04.909> loosen<00:02:05.240> if<00:02:05.420> you

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:05.509 
you can use the wheel to loosen if you

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:07.330 
you can use the wheel to loosen if you
need<00:02:05.659> to<00:02:05.780> you<00:02:06.110> know<00:02:06.200> angle<00:02:06.590> this<00:02:06.680> any<00:02:07.009> certain

umbrella<00:02:21.890> would<00:02:22.130> and<00:02:22.459> then<00:02:23.060> what<00:02:23.180> you're

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
umbrella would and then what you're

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.059 
umbrella would and then what you're
gonna<00:02:23.450> do<00:02:23.720> is<00:02:23.900> you're<00:02:24.110> gonna<00:02:24.170> slide<00:02:24.739> this

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:25.069 
gonna do is you're gonna slide this

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:29.250 
gonna do is you're gonna slide this
through<00:02:25.580> the<00:02:25.880> opening<00:02:26.830> just<00:02:27.830> like<00:02:28.040> this<00:02:28.250> I

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
through the opening just like this I

don't know if you can see that but then
once<00:02:32.330> you<00:02:32.420> get<00:02:32.630> it<00:02:32.810> through<00:02:33.200> to<00:02:33.230> the<00:02:33.410> inside<00:02:33.860> of

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
once you get it through to the inside of

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:35.860 
once you get it through to the inside of
the<00:02:34.040> light<00:02:34.280> I'll<00:02:34.580> show<00:02:34.790> you<00:02:34.850> from<00:02:35.120> the<00:02:35.300> back<00:02:35.510> so

the light I'll show you from the back so

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.120 
the light I'll show you from the back so
you<00:02:35.959> can<00:02:36.140> really<00:02:36.290> see<00:02:36.560> what's<00:02:36.739> going<00:02:36.830> on

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
you can really see what's going on

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.100 
you can really see what's going on
you're<00:02:38.000> gonna<00:02:38.120> notice<00:02:38.420> that<00:02:38.600> there's<00:02:38.959> this

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
you're gonna notice that there's this

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.590 
you're gonna notice that there's this
little<00:02:39.290> square<00:02:39.800> section<00:02:40.340> okay<00:02:40.970> so<00:02:41.480> you're

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
little square section okay so you're

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.090 
little square section okay so you're
gonna<00:02:41.660> take<00:02:41.959> the<00:02:42.170> rod<00:02:42.350> and<00:02:42.680> actually<00:02:43.010> go

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.100 
gonna take the rod and actually go

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:44.470 
gonna take the rod and actually go
through<00:02:43.280> the<00:02:43.430> front<00:02:43.700> portion<00:02:43.970> of<00:02:44.150> that<00:02:44.300> and

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
through the front portion of that and

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.190 
through the front portion of that and
then<00:02:45.200> it'll<00:02:45.350> click<00:02:45.650> pass<00:02:46.100> this<00:02:46.540> a<00:02:47.540> little

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
then it'll click pass this a little

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.850 
then it'll click pass this a little
metal<00:02:49.299> hinge<00:02:50.299> I<00:02:50.660> don't<00:02:51.230> know<00:02:51.290> what<00:02:51.410> to<00:02:51.530> call<00:02:51.560> it

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
metal hinge I don't know what to call it

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.920 
metal hinge I don't know what to call it
and<00:02:52.160> then<00:02:52.730> it'll<00:02:52.910> keep<00:02:53.120> going<00:02:53.330> and<00:02:53.600> then<00:02:53.720> that

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
and then it'll keep going and then that

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.920 
and then it'll keep going and then that
the<00:02:55.060> friction<00:02:56.060> or<00:02:56.180> the<00:02:56.299> pressure<00:02:56.540> of<00:02:56.810> that

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
the friction or the pressure of that

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.400 
the friction or the pressure of that
actually<00:02:57.350> holds<00:02:57.590> the<00:02:57.709> umbrella<00:02:58.010> in<00:02:58.190> place<00:02:59.410> and

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
actually holds the umbrella in place and

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:01.840 
actually holds the umbrella in place and
then<00:03:00.590> now<00:03:00.709> you<00:03:00.769> can<00:03:01.040> adjust<00:03:01.130> it<00:03:01.489> up<00:03:01.610> or<00:03:01.790> down

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:01.850 
then now you can adjust it up or down

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:04.210 
then now you can adjust it up or down
and<00:03:02.750> it'll<00:03:02.900> reflect<00:03:03.290> the<00:03:03.530> light<00:03:03.739> back<00:03:03.769> onto

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
and it'll reflect the light back onto

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.030 
and it'll reflect the light back onto
the<00:03:04.400> subject<00:03:05.440> so<00:03:06.440> from<00:03:06.620> here<00:03:06.739> I'm<00:03:06.860> going<00:03:06.980> to

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
the subject so from here I'm going to

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.530 
the subject so from here I'm going to
show<00:03:07.130> you<00:03:07.220> how<00:03:07.310> to<00:03:07.370> put<00:03:07.549> the<00:03:07.670> softbox<00:03:08.090> together

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
show you how to put the softbox together

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.610 
show you how to put the softbox together
and<00:03:08.870> then<00:03:08.989> we'll<00:03:09.110> put<00:03:09.350> it<00:03:09.440> on<00:03:09.590> the<00:03:09.860> QL<00:03:10.160> 1000<00:03:11.620> now

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
and then we'll put it on the QL 1000 now

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.910 
and then we'll put it on the QL 1000 now
for<00:03:12.829> the<00:03:12.890> softbox<00:03:14.079> what<00:03:15.079> you'll<00:03:15.230> see<00:03:15.470> in<00:03:15.739> the

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
for the softbox what you'll see in the

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.020 
for the softbox what you'll see in the
bag<00:03:16.130> is<00:03:16.430> the<00:03:16.510> speed<00:03:17.510> ring<00:03:17.720> four<00:03:18.440> rods<00:03:19.030> the

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
bag is the speed ring four rods the

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.840 
bag is the speed ring four rods the
diffusers<00:03:20.570> inner<00:03:20.900> and<00:03:21.350> outer<00:03:21.620> and<00:03:22.010> then<00:03:22.579> the

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:22.850 
diffusers inner and outer and then the

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:28.960 
diffusers inner and outer and then the
actual<00:03:23.120> South<00:03:23.420> box<00:03:23.750> now<00:03:24.620> the<00:03:24.680> first<00:03:25.010> step<00:03:27.970> like

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
actual South box now the first step like

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:32.740 
actual South box now the first step like
most<00:03:29.269> softbox<00:03:30.850> assemblies<00:03:31.850> what<00:03:32.600> you're

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 
most softbox assemblies what you're

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:34.120 
most softbox assemblies what you're
gonna<00:03:32.840> do<00:03:33.109> is<00:03:33.230> you're<00:03:33.380> gonna<00:03:33.440> put<00:03:33.769> the<00:03:33.890> speed

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 
gonna do is you're gonna put the speed

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:37.920 
gonna do is you're gonna put the speed
ring<00:03:34.310> in<00:03:34.459> the<00:03:34.549> center<00:03:34.579> of<00:03:34.880> the<00:03:34.970> softbox

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:40.750 

and<00:03:38.930> it<00:03:39.020> can<00:03:39.230> be<00:03:39.380> kind<00:03:39.620> of<00:03:39.710> you<00:03:40.010> know<00:03:40.130> stuffy<00:03:40.670> at

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
and it can be kind of you know stuffy at

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.460 
and it can be kind of you know stuffy at
first<00:03:41.090> because<00:03:41.360> what's<00:03:41.750> gonna<00:03:41.930> hold<00:03:42.170> it<00:03:42.350> in

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:42.470 
first because what's gonna hold it in

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:44.740 
first because what's gonna hold it in
place<00:03:42.620> is<00:03:42.890> the<00:03:43.040> rugs<00:03:43.480> so<00:03:44.480> what<00:03:44.600> you're<00:03:44.690> gonna

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
place is the rugs so what you're gonna

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.080 
place is the rugs so what you're gonna
do<00:03:45.020> is<00:03:45.140> take<00:03:45.350> two<00:03:45.380> rods<00:03:45.800> and<00:03:46.160> then<00:03:46.700> find<00:03:46.970> the

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
do is take two rods and then find the

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:50.230 
do is take two rods and then find the
thicker<00:03:47.330> edge<00:03:48.040> and<00:03:49.040> on<00:03:49.220> this<00:03:49.459> one<00:03:49.700> actually

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:50.240 
thicker edge and on this one actually

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:51.880 
thicker edge and on this one actually
they're<00:03:50.450> just<00:03:50.480> wider<00:03:50.959> you<00:03:51.260> can<00:03:51.290> kind<00:03:51.620> of<00:03:51.709> tell

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:51.890 
they're just wider you can kind of tell

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:54.190 
they're just wider you can kind of tell
when<00:03:52.069> you<00:03:52.160> feel<00:03:52.370> them<00:03:52.580> so<00:03:52.959> what<00:03:53.959> you're<00:03:54.110> gonna

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:54.200 
when you feel them so what you're gonna

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.740 
when you feel them so what you're gonna
do<00:03:54.470> is<00:03:54.590> you're<00:03:54.709> gonna<00:03:54.770> find<00:03:55.220> two<00:03:56.209> holes<00:03:56.480> that

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
do is you're gonna find two holes that

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:58.900 
do is you're gonna find two holes that
are<00:03:56.810> opposite<00:03:57.350> of<00:03:57.440> each<00:03:57.560> other<00:03:57.800> regardless<00:03:58.640> of

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:58.910 
are opposite of each other regardless of

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:02.230 
are opposite of each other regardless of
numbers<00:03:59.890> so<00:04:00.890> we're<00:04:01.010> gonna<00:04:01.100> find<00:04:01.459> that<00:04:01.610> one<00:04:01.790> and

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:02.240 
numbers so we're gonna find that one and

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
numbers so we're gonna find that one and
then<00:04:02.570> slide<00:04:02.930> that<00:04:03.140> into<00:04:04.630> the<00:04:05.630> corner<00:04:06.020> just

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 
then slide that into the corner just

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.470 
then slide that into the corner just
like<00:04:06.709> that<00:04:06.980> so<00:04:07.700> then<00:04:07.850> you're<00:04:07.970> gonna<00:04:08.060> take<00:04:08.300> the

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:08.480 
like that so then you're gonna take the

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:17.409 
like that so then you're gonna take the
opposite<00:04:09.050> and<00:04:10.209> and<00:04:11.209> do<00:04:11.900> the<00:04:12.050> same<00:04:12.260> thing<00:04:16.419> put

00:04:17.409 --> 00:04:17.419 
opposite and and do the same thing put

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:20.740 
opposite and and do the same thing put
it<00:04:17.540> in<00:04:17.630> the<00:04:17.750> corner<00:04:17.989> just<00:04:18.350> like<00:04:18.500> that<00:04:19.750> now

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:20.750 
it in the corner just like that now

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:22.540 
it in the corner just like that now
you're<00:04:20.989> gonna<00:04:21.140> reach<00:04:21.410> out<00:04:21.650> and<00:04:22.070> kind<00:04:22.280> of<00:04:22.370> pull

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:22.550 
you're gonna reach out and kind of pull

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:27.700 
you're gonna reach out and kind of pull
this<00:04:22.669> apart<00:04:22.870> hold<00:04:23.870> this<00:04:24.080> side<00:04:24.320> down<00:04:26.590> do<00:04:27.590> it

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:27.710 
this apart hold this side down do it

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:30.610 
this apart hold this side down do it
with<00:04:27.830> a<00:04:28.010> third<00:04:28.250> corner<00:04:28.810> pull<00:04:29.810> this<00:04:29.960> out<00:04:30.169> just

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:30.620 
with a third corner pull this out just

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:44.710 
with a third corner pull this out just
like<00:04:30.740> that<00:04:36.760> and<00:04:37.760> then<00:04:38.980> again<00:04:43.210> now<00:04:44.210> you<00:04:44.270> can<00:04:44.510> see

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:44.720 
like that and then again now you can see

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:54.580 
like that and then again now you can see
the<00:04:44.840> shape<00:04:45.080> that<00:04:45.320> it's<00:04:45.500> taking<00:04:47.560> like<00:04:48.560> that<00:04:53.590> so

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:54.590 
the shape that it's taking like that so

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:57.070 
the shape that it's taking like that so
there's<00:04:55.430> the<00:04:55.640> softbox<00:04:56.120> the<00:04:56.390> basic<00:04:56.780> assembly

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:57.080 
there's the softbox the basic assembly

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.760 
there's the softbox the basic assembly
instructions<00:04:57.860> and<00:04:58.520> then<00:04:58.669> what<00:04:58.910> I'll<00:04:59.030> do<00:04:59.240> is

00:04:59.760 --> 00:04:59.770 
instructions and then what I'll do is

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:03.190 
instructions and then what I'll do is
velcro<00:05:00.770> these<00:05:01.450> just<00:05:02.450> to<00:05:02.570> kind<00:05:02.780> of<00:05:02.840> tighten<00:05:03.020> it

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:03.200 
velcro these just to kind of tighten it

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:06.370 
velcro these just to kind of tighten it
up<00:05:04.150> and<00:05:05.150> then<00:05:05.419> before<00:05:05.570> I<00:05:05.780> put<00:05:05.990> the<00:05:06.080> diffuser

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:06.380 
up and then before I put the diffuser

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:07.840 
up and then before I put the diffuser
panels<00:05:06.890> on<00:05:07.040> I'm<00:05:07.160> going<00:05:07.310> to<00:05:07.400> show<00:05:07.550> you<00:05:07.610> how<00:05:07.790> to

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:07.850 
panels on I'm going to show you how to

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:09.400 
panels on I'm going to show you how to
put<00:05:08.090> it<00:05:08.180> on<00:05:08.270> the<00:05:08.419> light<00:05:08.630> because<00:05:09.169> it's<00:05:09.350> a

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:09.410 
put it on the light because it's a

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:10.630 
put it on the light because it's a
little<00:05:09.650> bit<00:05:09.770> easier<00:05:10.040> to<00:05:10.100> shoot<00:05:10.370> from<00:05:10.520> the

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:10.640 
little bit easier to shoot from the

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:11.260 
little bit easier to shoot from the
inside

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:11.270 
inside

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:13.300 
inside
one<00:05:11.419> thing<00:05:11.660> to<00:05:11.780> do<00:05:11.900> before<00:05:12.200> you<00:05:12.290> put<00:05:12.320> it<00:05:12.560> on<00:05:12.680> is

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:13.310 
one thing to do before you put it on is

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:16.510 
one thing to do before you put it on is
um<00:05:13.640> right<00:05:14.630> here<00:05:14.870> you'll<00:05:15.080> see<00:05:15.290> this<00:05:15.500> you<00:05:16.370> can

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:16.520 
um right here you'll see this you can

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.040 
um right here you'll see this you can
actually<00:05:16.820> tighten<00:05:17.120> that<00:05:17.390> because<00:05:17.720> when<00:05:17.900> this

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:18.050 
actually tighten that because when this

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:19.900 
actually tighten that because when this
is<00:05:18.229> loose<00:05:18.470> the<00:05:18.740> speed<00:05:19.040> ring<00:05:19.220> actually<00:05:19.340> spins

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:19.910 
is loose the speed ring actually spins

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:22.480 
is loose the speed ring actually spins
so<00:05:20.690> that<00:05:20.810> you<00:05:20.900> can<00:05:21.080> rotate<00:05:21.380> this<00:05:21.800> on<00:05:22.100> the<00:05:22.280> light

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:22.490 
so that you can rotate this on the light

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:29.730 
so that you can rotate this on the light
what<00:05:23.090> we'll<00:05:23.270> do<00:05:23.419> is<00:05:23.570> we'll<00:05:23.750> tighten<00:05:24.020> that

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:29.740 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:37.750 

throw<00:05:30.740> it<00:05:30.890> in<00:05:35.229> and<00:05:36.229> you'll<00:05:36.320> hear<00:05:36.530> a<00:05:36.560> click<00:05:36.919> so

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:37.760 
throw it in and you'll hear a click so

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:39.550 
throw it in and you'll hear a click so
what<00:05:37.789> I<00:05:37.910> did<00:05:38.150> is<00:05:38.300> I<00:05:38.419> put<00:05:38.600> it<00:05:38.690> in<00:05:38.810> I<00:05:38.930> rotated<00:05:39.350> it

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:39.560 
what I did is I put it in I rotated it

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:41.950 
what I did is I put it in I rotated it
to<00:05:39.890> your<00:05:40.100> left<00:05:40.370> and<00:05:41.120> then<00:05:41.360> I<00:05:41.450> heard<00:05:41.600> it<00:05:41.750> click

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:41.960 
to your left and then I heard it click

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:45.250 
to your left and then I heard it click
so<00:05:42.680> now<00:05:42.800> since<00:05:43.070> this<00:05:43.250> is<00:05:43.310> kind<00:05:43.669> of<00:05:43.729> cockeyed<00:05:44.260> we

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:45.260 
so now since this is kind of cockeyed we

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.860 
so now since this is kind of cockeyed we
can<00:05:45.440> just<00:05:45.620> loosen<00:05:45.860> this<00:05:46.190> and<00:05:46.599> square<00:05:47.599> it<00:05:47.750> up

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:47.870
