our<00:00:36.730> mountain<00:00:37.090> running<00:00:37.239> in<00:00:37.420> particular

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:37.660 
our mountain running in particular

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:40.880 
our mountain running in particular
almost<00:00:38.260> about<00:00:38.920> 11<00:00:39.309> years<00:00:39.489> of<00:00:39.670> pretty<00:00:40.120> much

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
almost about 11 years of pretty much

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.340 
almost about 11 years of pretty much
injury<00:00:41.890> free<00:00:42.250> running<00:00:42.519> so<00:00:42.909> I<00:00:42.940> think<00:00:43.089> the<00:00:43.989> 12th

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:44.350 
injury free running so I think the 12th

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.170 
injury free running so I think the 12th
year<00:00:44.409> was<00:00:44.799> a<00:00:44.830> bit<00:00:45.100> too<00:00:45.280> much<00:00:45.309> for<00:00:45.489> my<00:00:45.850> body<00:00:46.000> and
