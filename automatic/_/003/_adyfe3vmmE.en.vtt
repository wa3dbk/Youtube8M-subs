00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:06.250
 First of all, if it was Hawks's writing start 

00:00:03.759 --> 00:00:11.049
 Let's have a look from 1 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:13.110
 The first time Ota Sora swing strikes and Matsumoto brings swing swings and a great stand up preparation 

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:13.110
 The 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.060
 And not touched 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:26.660
 It is the third floor 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.660
 1 it was a scene of what a runner at first base, but catcher fly to the other 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:37.430
 It's a no-out runner's eyebrow and catcher fly temples are moving around and Fujimura 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.430
 The air strike strikeout also calmed down and took over 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:44.690
 And four times 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:47.090
 Table batter Bow car Sekandogoro 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:50.570
 Sora Murata 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:56.200
 And in the end it's a rumor Robo 2 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:56.200
 It's too good Ne be It was his 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:03.000
 And they are descendants of Giants 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:05.550
 It is the first time I make with short buddy &amp; 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.180
 Thereafter, the It is a world pitch 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:10.600
 Tape is good 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:15.240
 It's inside that it was that pizza cutter 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:21.550
 I'd thought I wonder if much bet I got is we said it so far Nee 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:26.390
 Hey were brought by force, however path dependence has bounced back from here 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:31.490
 It was great I'll have pitching from the second floor stable had been in Nee 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:34.210
 Enough to wait for the starting rotation around and go likely such pitching Sun Wei is later 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.210
 Showed off 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:39.790
 5 consecutive strikeouts from the third floor to the 4th 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:45.060
 Apparently there was Tan 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:45.060
 Well then it's Iwasaki's pitch after Aragaki 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:56.690
 It is a pitching of this city that traveled and was 3rd place Naa Osa, but also where Ota is now 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:01.770
 And 6 times 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:04.520
 I was a Bitch woman and I wanted to be a runner , but I also hit it on a light fly 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.520
 Tsu I think that care of the fit 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:14.069
 Come on and 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:14.069
 The 8th floor of the store is easily Wonderberry Kurabo Car is a fine sugar 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.409
 It earlier I was told us 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:24.900
 Straight out of this Takahashi Yoshinobu 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.900
 I was powerful 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:33.060
 And it is a pitch of Jean- Yatsu Yamaguchi 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:40.030
 Although I was already sound and six times seven times and 22 wards of pitching 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:42.720
 It was happy It was perfect I really can really adjust the char firmly Yes 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.720
 Come on and 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:48.110
 By Dake twice Yamaguchi car 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:55.209
 Was not beaten 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.209
 It was almost perfect content 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:02.250
 And it is a car that is in the third place today 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:08.600
 3 hits to put out today 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:08.600
 The first time before the light and 6 times before the net 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:19.130
 And there is no need for local Mia 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:21.920
 It was still a strong hit in front of the center, but I really left it firmly 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:25.819
 From tax 1 out 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:28.850
 There was no hit Orter finally the hit is timely 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:31.330
 I monitored the powder of 2 people 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:34.080
 Alternative to Abe's Sacrifice Fly 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.080
 Is adding 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:41.070
 The west is four bodies 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:41.070
 It was open warfare today that began to occur
