upside<00:02:19.230> of<00:02:19.500> that<00:02:19.800> is<00:02:20.010> it<00:02:20.420> feels<00:02:21.420> better<00:02:21.780> to

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
upside of that is it feels better to

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.440 
upside of that is it feels better to
hold<00:02:22.230> in<00:02:22.500> your<00:02:22.530> hand<00:02:22.980> but<00:02:23.910> since<00:02:24.180> it's<00:02:24.360> a

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
hold in your hand but since it's a

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:25.850 
hold in your hand but since it's a
little<00:02:24.690> thicker<00:02:24.900> and<00:02:25.170> it's<00:02:25.290> little<00:02:25.500> creepier

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
little thicker and it's little creepier

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.000 
little thicker and it's little creepier
it's<00:02:26.040> easier<00:02:26.280> to<00:02:26.430> hold<00:02:26.959> I<00:02:27.959> wouldn't<00:02:28.500> call<00:02:28.680> it<00:02:28.830> a

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
it's easier to hold I wouldn't call it a

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.430 
it's easier to hold I wouldn't call it a

just<00:03:45.570> tear<00:03:46.470> it<00:03:46.500> off<00:03:46.769> like<00:03:47.040> you're<00:03:47.220> just

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
just tear it off like you're just

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:52.190 
just tear it off like you're just
ripping<00:03:48.239> the<00:03:48.510> case<00:03:49.410> off<00:03:49.650> from<00:03:49.860> the<00:03:50.810> the<00:03:51.810> powder

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
ripping the case off from the the powder

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.069 
ripping the case off from the the powder
enclosure<00:03:52.739> it<00:03:53.579> is<00:03:54.090> a<00:03:54.120> little<00:03:54.299> thin<00:03:54.630> down<00:03:54.810> here

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:55.079 
enclosure it is a little thin down here

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:57.710 
enclosure it is a little thin down here
so<00:03:55.200> you<00:03:55.260> don't<00:03:55.380> want<00:03:55.500> to<00:03:55.560> pull<00:03:55.739> too<00:03:56.160> hard<00:03:56.720> make

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
so you don't want to pull too hard make

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.539 
so you don't want to pull too hard make
sure<00:03:57.750> it<00:03:57.930> just<00:03:58.079> comes<00:03:58.290> off<00:03:58.440> like<00:03:58.590> natural<00:03:59.250> see

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549 
sure it just comes off like natural see

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:01.729 
sure it just comes off like natural see
so<00:04:00.180> this<00:04:00.390> is<00:04:00.420> that<00:04:00.870> outer<00:04:01.079> coating<00:04:01.470> that<00:04:01.680> I

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 
so this is that outer coating that I

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:04.190 
so this is that outer coating that I
told<00:04:01.980> you<00:04:02.250> it<00:04:02.430> is<00:04:03.150> a<00:04:03.180> little<00:04:03.570> bit<00:04:03.810> of<00:04:03.840> a<00:04:04.019> lint
