reach back one fret and then move back
into<00:02:19.770> position<00:02:19.950> if<00:02:20.790> you<00:02:20.880> kind<00:02:21.120> of<00:02:21.209> think<00:02:21.510> about

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
into position if you kind of think about

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.759 
into position if you kind of think about
a<00:02:22.110> four<00:02:22.770> fret<00:02:23.160> area<00:02:23.610> as<00:02:23.819> a<00:02:23.850> position<00:02:24.750> you<00:02:25.350> might

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:25.769 
a four fret area as a position you might

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:27.530 
a four fret area as a position you might
have<00:02:25.920> played<00:02:26.160> this<00:02:26.370> kind<00:02:26.640> of<00:02:26.700> finger<00:02:27.060> exercise

have played this kind of finger exercise

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:33.650 
have played this kind of finger exercise
before<00:02:27.810> where<00:02:28.140> you<00:02:28.230> just<00:02:28.470> play<00:02:32.480> well<00:02:33.480> that's

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
before where you just play well that's

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.810 
before where you just play well that's
kind<00:02:34.380> of<00:02:34.620> a<00:02:34.739> chromatic<00:02:35.040> scale<00:02:35.220> but<00:02:35.700> not

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
kind of a chromatic scale but not

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.430 
kind of a chromatic scale but not
exactly<00:02:36.300> because<00:02:36.390> there's<00:02:36.810> some<00:02:37.019> of<00:02:37.200> notes

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
exactly because there's some of notes

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.680 
exactly because there's some of notes
that<00:02:37.560> are<00:02:37.680> missing<00:02:37.890> in<00:02:38.130> that<00:02:38.209> if<00:02:39.209> I'm<00:02:39.390> truly

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.750 
that are missing in that if I'm truly
playing<00:02:40.110> the<00:02:40.260> chromatic<00:02:40.739> scale<00:02:40.769> I<00:02:43.370> do<00:02:44.370> have<00:02:44.640> to

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
playing the chromatic scale I do have to

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.940 
playing the chromatic scale I do have to
reach<00:02:44.970> back<00:02:45.000> and<00:02:45.269> grab<00:02:45.540> that<00:02:45.840> note<00:02:46.140> that's<00:02:46.650> out

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
reach back and grab that note that's out

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.790 
reach back and grab that note that's out
of<00:02:47.010> position<00:02:47.970> that's<00:02:48.450> out<00:02:48.750> of<00:02:48.780> that<00:02:49.140> four<00:02:49.500> fret

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
of position that's out of that four fret

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.830 
of position that's out of that four fret
area<00:02:50.220> and<00:02:50.400> so<00:02:50.550> kind<00:02:51.060> of<00:02:51.180> reaching<00:02:51.510> back<00:02:51.660> with

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
area and so kind of reaching back with

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.600 
area and so kind of reaching back with
my<00:02:51.959> first<00:02:52.200> finger<00:02:52.380> to<00:02:52.830> a<00:02:52.860> note<00:02:53.130> that's<00:02:53.370> one

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.880 
my first finger to a note that's one
fret<00:02:54.000> lower<00:02:54.330> than<00:02:54.569> the<00:02:54.720> position<00:02:55.230> and<00:02:55.380> then

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
fret lower than the position and then

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:02.620 
fret lower than the position and then
work<00:02:56.160> my<00:02:56.190> finger<00:02:56.850> back<00:02:57.209> into<00:02:57.870> position<00:03:01.190> now

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:02.630 
work my finger back into position now

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:05.870 
work my finger back into position now
going<00:03:03.630> back<00:03:04.049> down<00:03:04.470> I<00:03:04.799> could<00:03:05.519> do<00:03:05.700> the<00:03:05.850> same

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
going back down I could do the same

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.199 
going back down I could do the same
thing<00:03:06.420> I<00:03:06.600> could<00:03:06.780> go<00:03:07.459> and<00:03:08.459> then<00:03:08.640> take<00:03:08.820> my<00:03:08.970> first

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
thing I could go and then take my first

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:11.990 
thing I could go and then take my first
finger<00:03:09.570> and<00:03:09.720> move<00:03:09.989> it<00:03:10.170> down<00:03:10.709> one<00:03:11.010> fret<00:03:11.340> like

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
finger and move it down one fret like

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:26.210 
finger and move it down one fret like
that<00:03:22.370> but<00:03:23.370> coming<00:03:23.850> down<00:03:24.709> another<00:03:25.709> way<00:03:25.980> that

that but coming down another way that

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.160 
that but coming down another way that
you<00:03:26.400> could<00:03:26.610> kind<00:03:27.209> of<00:03:27.239> play<00:03:27.420> this<00:03:27.600> chromatic

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
you could kind of play this chromatic

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.860 
you could kind of play this chromatic
scale<00:03:28.530> is<00:03:29.160> to<00:03:29.489> kind<00:03:29.700> of<00:03:29.760> reach<00:03:30.060> for<00:03:30.510> a<00:03:30.570> note

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
scale is to kind of reach for a note

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.680 
scale is to kind of reach for a note
that's<00:03:31.079> out<00:03:31.290> of<00:03:31.350> position<00:03:32.180> one<00:03:33.180> fret<00:03:33.450> higher

that's out of position one fret higher

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.410 
that's out of position one fret higher
with<00:03:34.290> my<00:03:34.769> pinkie<00:03:35.130> so<00:03:35.310> watch<00:03:35.459> this<00:03:35.670> as<00:03:35.850> I<00:03:36.209> come

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:41.590 

this<00:03:39.620> time<00:03:39.890> I'm<00:03:40.610> gonna<00:03:40.790> play<00:03:41.120> a<00:03:41.150> note<00:03:41.420> that's

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:41.600 
this time I'm gonna play a note that's

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.320 
this time I'm gonna play a note that's
on<00:03:41.900> the<00:03:42.140> second<00:03:42.560> string<00:03:42.860> at<00:03:43.130> the<00:03:43.550> ninth<00:03:44.030> fret

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:44.330 
on the second string at the ninth fret

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:48.790 
on the second string at the ninth fret
and<00:03:45.010> then<00:03:46.010> pinkie<00:03:46.870> that's<00:03:47.870> out<00:03:48.140> of<00:03:48.170> position

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:48.800 
and then pinkie that's out of position

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.160 
and then pinkie that's out of position
come<00:03:49.580> down<00:03:49.760> one<00:03:50.000> fret<00:03:50.210> to<00:03:50.480> the<00:03:50.600> note<00:03:50.750> that's<00:03:50.930> in

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.170 
come down one fret to the note that's in

00:03:51.170 --> 00:04:02.950 
come down one fret to the note that's in
position<00:04:00.430> it's<00:04:01.430> often<00:04:01.880> easier<00:04:02.390> to<00:04:02.450> kind<00:04:02.840> of

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:02.960 
position it's often easier to kind of

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:06.580 
position it's often easier to kind of
play<00:04:03.230> a<00:04:03.260> note<00:04:03.590> that's<00:04:03.920> out<00:04:04.160> of<00:04:04.220> position<00:04:05.590> going

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
play a note that's out of position going

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:09.220 
play a note that's out of position going
into<00:04:07.130> position<00:04:07.700> than<00:04:08.360> it<00:04:08.480> is<00:04:08.600> to<00:04:08.780> play<00:04:08.960> one

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:09.230 
into position than it is to play one

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:10.960 
into position than it is to play one
that's<00:04:09.440> in<00:04:09.620> position<00:04:10.070> and<00:04:10.160> going<00:04:10.310> out<00:04:10.670> of

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:10.970 
that's in position and going out of

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:13.270 
that's in position and going out of
position<00:04:11.390> what<00:04:11.840> I<00:04:11.870> mean<00:04:12.110> is<00:04:12.290> if<00:04:12.470> I'm<00:04:12.620> going<00:04:12.950> up

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:13.280 
position what I mean is if I'm going up

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.640 
position what I mean is if I'm going up
it's<00:04:14.240> probably<00:04:14.450> harder<00:04:15.050> to<00:04:15.170> do<00:04:15.290> something

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:15.650 
it's probably harder to do something

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:23.110 
it's probably harder to do something
like<00:04:15.800> this<00:04:20.200> where<00:04:21.200> I<00:04:21.230> played<00:04:21.500> that<00:04:21.650> note<00:04:22.120> with

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.120 
like this where I played that note with

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.060 
like this where I played that note with
my<00:04:23.240> pinkie<00:04:23.660> that<00:04:23.690> was<00:04:23.930> in<00:04:24.140> position<00:04:24.680> and<00:04:24.830> then

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.070 
my pinkie that was in position and then

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:29.400 
my pinkie that was in position and then
went<00:04:25.340> out<00:04:25.880> of<00:04:26.180> position<00:04:26.660> going<00:04:26.840> up<00:04:27.110> one<00:04:27.380> fret

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:29.410 
went out of position going up one fret

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:32.770 
went out of position going up one fret
it's<00:04:30.410> probably<00:04:30.770> easier<00:04:31.190> to<00:04:31.460> play<00:04:32.420> this<00:04:32.570> note

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:32.780 
it's probably easier to play this note

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:34.810 
it's probably easier to play this note
on<00:04:32.990> the<00:04:33.320> first<00:04:33.560> string<00:04:33.770> with<00:04:34.250> my<00:04:34.430> first<00:04:34.670> finger

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:34.820 
on the first string with my first finger

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:36.940 
on the first string with my first finger
that's<00:04:35.180> out<00:04:35.360> of<00:04:35.390> position<00:04:35.900> and<00:04:36.080> then<00:04:36.710> come

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:36.950 
that's out of position and then come

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:43.420 
that's out of position and then come
into<00:04:37.580> position<00:04:38.710> all<00:04:39.710> right<00:04:39.830> so<00:04:40.070> and<00:04:42.040> so<00:04:43.040> let's

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:43.430 
into position all right so and so let's

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:48.700 
into position all right so and so let's
just<00:04:43.640> continue<00:04:43.820> on<00:04:44.060> down<00:04:44.630> so<00:04:45.290> I<00:04:45.320> go<00:04:46.660> pinky<00:04:47.710> out

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:48.710 
just continue on down so I go pinky out

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:51.940 
just continue on down so I go pinky out
of<00:04:48.950> position<00:04:49.340> it's<00:04:49.610> in<00:04:49.910> position<00:04:50.950> again

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:51.950 
of position it's in position again

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:53.890 
of position it's in position again
between<00:04:52.100> my<00:04:52.460> second<00:04:53.030> and<00:04:53.090> third<00:04:53.330> strings<00:04:53.600> I

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:53.900 
between my second and third strings I

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:58.150 
between my second and third strings I
don't<00:04:54.470> need<00:04:54.800> to<00:04:56.230> do<00:04:57.230> any<00:04:57.410> adjustment<00:04:57.980> because

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:58.160 
don't need to do any adjustment because

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:02.670 
don't need to do any adjustment because
the<00:04:58.430> way<00:04:58.520> the<00:04:58.640> guitar<00:04:58.880> is<00:04:58.970> tuned<00:04:59.240> so
