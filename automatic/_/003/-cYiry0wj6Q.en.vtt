show<00:00:00.480> you<00:00:00.539> this<00:00:01.790> pH<00:00:02.790> ORP<00:00:03.030> me<00:00:03.689> or<00:00:03.929> meter<00:00:04.520> I'm

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.520 
show you this pH ORP me or meter I'm

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:11.270 
show you this pH ORP me or meter I'm
reading<00:00:06.330> the<00:00:07.970> ORP<00:00:09.590> basically<00:00:10.590> just<00:00:10.889> from<00:00:11.160> the

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
reading the ORP basically just from the

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.910 
reading the ORP basically just from the
air<00:00:11.309> and<00:00:11.969> as<00:00:12.809> you<00:00:13.049> can<00:00:13.230> see<00:00:13.530> it's<00:00:13.710> got<00:00:13.889> a

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
air and as you can see it's got a

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.340 
air and as you can see it's got a
positive<00:00:14.639> like<00:00:14.969> between<00:00:16.550> 203<00:00:17.550> or<00:00:17.970> between<00:00:18.779> 200

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
positive like between 203 or between 200

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:20.960 
positive like between 203 or between 200
and<00:00:19.380> 400<00:00:19.710> or<00:00:20.189> whatever

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
and 400 or whatever

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.730 
and 400 or whatever
now<00:00:21.980> most<00:00:22.980> clothing<00:00:23.820> when<00:00:24.779> you<00:00:25.380> know<00:00:25.529> will

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
now most clothing when you know will

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.240 
now most clothing when you know will
will<00:00:26.070> have<00:00:26.279> a<00:00:26.340> similar<00:00:27.439> positive<00:00:30.199> reading

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:31.250 
will have a similar positive reading

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:36.940 
will have a similar positive reading
here<00:00:33.050> let's<00:00:34.050> say<00:00:34.320> this<00:00:34.350> is<00:00:34.739> a<00:00:35.149> cotton<00:00:36.149> shirt

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:36.950 
here let's say this is a cotton shirt

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.569 
here let's say this is a cotton shirt
let<00:00:37.950> me<00:00:38.070> just<00:00:38.280> touch<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.969> ORP<00:00:39.270> with<00:00:39.719> it

00:00:40.569 --> 00:00:40.579 
let me just touch the ORP with it

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:45.799 
let me just touch the ORP with it
and<00:00:42.350> it<00:00:43.350> looks<00:00:43.620> like<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:44.040> cotton<00:00:44.280> shirt<00:00:44.730> is<00:00:45.030> up

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
and it looks like the cotton shirt is up

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.299 
and it looks like the cotton shirt is up
there<00:00:46.500> at<00:00:46.680> about<00:00:47.600> 236<00:00:48.600> or<00:00:49.050> close<00:00:49.770> to<00:00:49.980> what<00:00:50.160> the

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
there at about 236 or close to what the

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:56.740 
there at about 236 or close to what the
air<00:00:50.460> is<00:00:50.969> and<00:00:53.480> maybe<00:00:54.480> a<00:00:54.600> little<00:00:54.840> bit<00:00:55.079> less<00:00:56.070> less

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:56.750 
air is and maybe a little bit less less

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.810 
air is and maybe a little bit less less
oxidizing<00:00:57.750> than<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.079> air<00:00:58.260> you<00:00:59.160> know<00:00:59.280> maybe<00:00:59.489> by

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
oxidizing than the air you know maybe by

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.840 
oxidizing than the air you know maybe by
a<00:00:59.850> hundred<00:01:00.270> points<00:01:00.750> or<00:01:00.930> something<00:01:01.789> know<00:01:02.789> if

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
a hundred points or something know if

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.450 
a hundred points or something know if
you<00:01:02.969> can<00:01:03.120> see<00:01:03.300> that<00:01:03.480> but<00:01:03.799> I'm<00:01:04.799> going<00:01:05.070> to<00:01:05.250> show

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
you can see that but I'm going to show

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:12.140 
you can see that but I'm going to show
you<00:01:05.489> what<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:07.820> nephal<00:01:08.850> glove<00:01:09.450> does<00:01:09.960> and<00:01:11.150> when

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
you what the nephal glove does and when

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.539 
you what the nephal glove does and when
you<00:01:12.299> touch<00:01:12.600> that<00:01:13.020> to<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.100> nephal<00:01:14.490> glove<00:01:16.549> and

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
you touch that to the nephal glove and

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.420 
you touch that to the nephal glove and
it's<00:01:18.390> it's<00:01:18.780> like<00:01:18.869> up<00:01:19.259> at<00:01:19.409> a<00:01:19.439> not<00:01:19.770> a<00:01:19.799> negative

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
it's it's like up at a not a negative

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.620 
it's it's like up at a not a negative
nine<00:01:20.700> hundred<00:01:21.259> something<00:01:22.310> that's<00:01:23.310> I<00:01:23.939> hope<00:01:24.479> you

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
nine hundred something that's I hope you

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.810 
nine hundred something that's I hope you
can<00:01:24.780> see<00:01:24.990> that<00:01:25.200> because<00:01:25.650> that's<00:01:26.100> that's<00:01:26.520> just

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
can see that because that's that's just

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:33.140 
can see that because that's that's just
a<00:01:26.970> lot<00:01:27.210> of<00:01:27.420> antioxidant<00:01:28.400> oxidizing<00:01:30.560> so<00:01:32.150> now

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
a lot of antioxidant oxidizing so now

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.219 
a lot of antioxidant oxidizing so now
this<00:01:33.600> nephal<00:01:34.170> glove<00:01:34.500> will<00:01:34.860> fluctuate<00:01:35.250> it<00:01:36.229> it

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
this nephal glove will fluctuate it it

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:42.980 
this nephal glove will fluctuate it it
will<00:01:38.479> become<00:01:39.479> may<00:01:40.290> be<00:01:40.350> positive<00:01:40.829> or<00:01:41.810> maybe<00:01:42.810> not

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
will become may be positive or maybe not

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.889 
will become may be positive or maybe not
as<00:01:43.229> negative<00:01:43.920> it's<00:01:44.790> it's<00:01:45.450> still<00:01:45.720> pretty

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
as negative it's it's still pretty

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.210 
as negative it's it's still pretty
negative<00:01:46.229> even<00:01:46.890> after<00:01:47.369> a<00:01:47.720> while<00:01:48.750> oops<00:01:49.530> my

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
negative even after a while oops my

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.310 
negative even after a while oops my
machine<00:01:50.610> it's<00:01:50.909> going<00:01:51.090> a<00:01:51.270> little<00:01:51.479> bad<00:01:51.630> but<00:01:53.030> it

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 
machine it's going a little bad but it

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.030 
machine it's going a little bad but it
it's<00:01:55.320> quite<00:01:55.619> negative<00:01:56.240> and<00:01:57.240> but<00:01:58.229> it<00:01:58.469> it<00:01:58.799> gets

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
it's quite negative and but it it gets

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.700 
it's quite negative and but it it gets
even<00:01:59.310> more<00:01:59.340> so<00:01:59.880> negative<00:02:00.420> if<00:02:00.570> you<00:02:00.810> rub<00:02:01.469> it<00:02:01.649> a

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
even more so negative if you rub it a

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.130 
even more so negative if you rub it a
little<00:02:01.950> bit<00:02:02.130> so<00:02:02.759> if<00:02:02.909> you<00:02:03.030> just<00:02:03.210> rub<00:02:03.600> it<00:02:03.780> just<00:02:04.020> a

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
little bit so if you just rub it just a

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.160 
little bit so if you just rub it just a
tad<00:02:04.380> and<00:02:04.850> then

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
tad and then

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:11.500 
tad and then
you<00:02:07.159> know<00:02:07.310> touch<00:02:07.729> it<00:02:07.939> to<00:02:08.119> it<00:02:08.270> it<00:02:09.050> will<00:02:09.200> get<00:02:10.510> well

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
you know touch it to it it will get well

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.290 
you know touch it to it it will get well
supposedly<00:02:11.989> it'll<00:02:12.349> get<00:02:12.500> any<00:02:12.620> more<00:02:13.300> negative

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 
supposedly it'll get any more negative

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.770 
supposedly it'll get any more negative
maybe<00:02:14.630> maybe<00:02:15.140> maybe<00:02:15.500> not<00:02:16.150> so<00:02:17.150> that<00:02:17.360> might<00:02:17.569> have

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
maybe maybe maybe not so that might have

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:23.920 
maybe maybe maybe not so that might have
let<00:02:18.650> me<00:02:18.770> rub<00:02:18.950> it<00:02:19.099> on<00:02:19.190> my<00:02:19.340> clothing<00:02:19.910> here<00:02:22.930> all

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
let me rub it on my clothing here all

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.350 
let me rub it on my clothing here all
right<00:02:24.170> see<00:02:24.620> it's<00:02:24.739> that<00:02:24.920> yeah<00:02:25.520> yeah<00:02:26.150> that

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
right see it's that yeah yeah that

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:27.309 
right see it's that yeah yeah that
really<00:02:26.510> whoops

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
really whoops

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:30.970 
really whoops
it<00:02:28.310> went<00:02:28.520> up<00:02:28.640> past<00:02:28.670> that<00:02:29.480> a<00:02:29.930> negative<00:02:30.260> thousand

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
it went up past that a negative thousand

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.790 
it went up past that a negative thousand
and<00:02:31.160> my<00:02:31.520> I<00:02:31.550> guess<00:02:31.970> my<00:02:32.000> machine<00:02:32.510> isn't<00:02:32.810> gonna<00:02:32.930> go

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
and my I guess my machine isn't gonna go

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.570 
and my I guess my machine isn't gonna go
past<00:02:34.190> a<00:02:34.489> negative<00:02:34.970> a<00:02:35.060> thousand<00:02:35.569> so<00:02:36.280> but<00:02:37.280> you

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
past a negative a thousand so but you

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.940 
past a negative a thousand so but you
know<00:02:37.670> that's<00:02:37.880> pretty<00:02:38.030> cool<00:02:38.330> your<00:02:39.050> your<00:02:39.410> you

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
know that's pretty cool your your you

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:41.740 
know that's pretty cool your your you
know<00:02:40.069> the<00:02:40.310> they<00:02:40.910> say<00:02:41.180> that<00:02:41.209> this<00:02:41.569> material

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
know the they say that this material

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.830 
know the they say that this material
attracts<00:02:42.680> negative<00:02:42.980> ions<00:02:43.700> from<00:02:44.030> the<00:02:44.239> air<00:02:44.390> and

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
attracts negative ions from the air and

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.440 
attracts negative ions from the air and
it<00:02:45.500> honestly<00:02:46.250> does<00:02:46.549> and<00:02:46.819> you<00:02:46.880> can<00:02:46.910> measure<00:02:47.269> it

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
it honestly does and you can measure it

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.360 
it honestly does and you can measure it
just<00:02:47.569> with<00:02:47.840> an<00:02:47.989> O<00:02:48.110> or<00:02:48.140> pee<00:02:48.530> meter<00:02:48.680> that<00:02:48.950> we<00:02:49.100> use

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
just with an O or pee meter that we use
