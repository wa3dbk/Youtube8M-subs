00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:03.139 

so<00:00:01.439> welcome<00:00:01.620> to<00:00:01.770> my<00:00:01.860> video<00:00:02.190> on<00:00:02.490> changing<00:00:03.000> an

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:03.149 
so welcome to my video on changing an

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.249 
so welcome to my video on changing an
improper<00:00:03.659> fraction<00:00:03.740> into<00:00:04.740> a<00:00:05.009> mixed<00:00:05.190> number<00:00:05.549> so

00:00:06.249 --> 00:00:06.259 
improper fraction into a mixed number so

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:09.110 
improper fraction into a mixed number so
here<00:00:07.259> we<00:00:07.379> have<00:00:07.589> the<00:00:07.919> improper<00:00:08.280> fraction<00:00:08.849> 9

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
here we have the improper fraction 9

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.080 
here we have the improper fraction 9
over<00:00:09.480> 4<00:00:09.920> it's<00:00:10.920> improper<00:00:11.280> because<00:00:11.670> we<00:00:11.940> have<00:00:12.030> a

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
over 4 it's improper because we have a

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.450 
over 4 it's improper because we have a
numerator<00:00:12.389> of<00:00:12.719> 9<00:00:13.200> which<00:00:13.500> is<00:00:13.530> bigger<00:00:13.860> than<00:00:14.340> our

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
numerator of 9 which is bigger than our

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.790 
numerator of 9 which is bigger than our
denominator<00:00:15.030> and<00:00:15.450> we<00:00:16.170> want<00:00:16.350> to<00:00:16.440> change<00:00:16.680> it

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
denominator and we want to change it

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.939 
denominator and we want to change it
into<00:00:17.010> a<00:00:17.250> mixed<00:00:17.789> number<00:00:18.410> and<00:00:19.410> this<00:00:19.590> is<00:00:19.740> done

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
into a mixed number and this is done

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.890 
into a mixed number and this is done
through<00:00:19.980> long<00:00:20.430> division<00:00:20.699> so<00:00:21.420> what<00:00:21.539> I'm<00:00:21.630> going

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
through long division so what I'm going

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.230 
through long division so what I'm going
to<00:00:21.960> do<00:00:22.170> is<00:00:22.350> since<00:00:22.890> 9<00:00:23.130> is<00:00:23.160> being<00:00:23.519> divided<00:00:23.820> by<00:00:23.970> 4

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
to do is since 9 is being divided by 4

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.070 
to do is since 9 is being divided by 4
I'm<00:00:25.080> going<00:00:25.350> to<00:00:25.410> use<00:00:25.529> long<00:00:25.769> division<00:00:25.800> and

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:27.080 
I'm going to use long division and

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:32.540 
I'm going to use long division and
divide<00:00:28.080> 9<00:00:28.320> by<00:00:28.980> 4<00:00:30.890> so<00:00:31.890> now<00:00:32.009> I<00:00:32.040> have<00:00:32.189> to<00:00:32.279> see<00:00:32.430> how

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
divide 9 by 4 so now I have to see how

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.209 
divide 9 by 4 so now I have to see how
many<00:00:32.610> times<00:00:33.000> 4<00:00:33.300> goes<00:00:33.510> into<00:00:33.540> 9<00:00:33.930> we<00:00:34.680> know<00:00:34.800> 4<00:00:35.040> goes

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
many times 4 goes into 9 we know 4 goes

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.260 
many times 4 goes into 9 we know 4 goes
into<00:00:35.460> 9<00:00:35.610> at<00:00:35.820> least<00:00:36.030> 2<00:00:36.329> times<00:00:36.829> and<00:00:38.180> if<00:00:39.180> you

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
into 9 at least 2 times and if you

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.240 
into 9 at least 2 times and if you
multiply<00:00:39.690> 2<00:00:39.750> times<00:00:39.930> 4<00:00:40.469> 2<00:00:40.890> times<00:00:41.160> 4<00:00:41.370> is<00:00:41.399> 8<00:00:41.640> and<00:00:43.250> if

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
multiply 2 times 4 2 times 4 is 8 and if

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.910 
multiply 2 times 4 2 times 4 is 8 and if
we<00:00:44.370> subtract<00:00:44.789> 9<00:00:45.000> minus<00:00:45.390> 8<00:00:45.629> we<00:00:46.200> get<00:00:46.379> a<00:00:46.620> remainder

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
we subtract 9 minus 8 we get a remainder

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:53.410 
we subtract 9 minus 8 we get a remainder
of<00:00:47.309> 1<00:00:47.789> so<00:00:49.280> since<00:00:50.280> 4<00:00:50.489> goes<00:00:50.670> into<00:00:50.700> 9<00:00:51.350> 2<00:00:52.350> times<00:00:52.710> our

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:53.420 
of 1 so since 4 goes into 9 2 times our

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.060 
of 1 so since 4 goes into 9 2 times our
mixed<00:00:54.420> number<00:00:54.719> is<00:00:54.989> going<00:00:55.289> to<00:00:55.350> have<00:00:55.530> a<00:00:55.829> whole

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
mixed number is going to have a whole

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.670 
mixed number is going to have a whole
number<00:00:56.309> of<00:00:56.670> two<00:00:57.649> and<00:00:59.000> since<00:01:00.000> we<00:01:00.090> have<00:01:00.239> a<00:01:00.270> 1<00:01:00.680> left

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
number of two and since we have a 1 left

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.789 
number of two and since we have a 1 left
over<00:01:02.070> and<00:01:02.250> our<00:01:02.340> remainder<00:01:02.640> our<00:01:03.439> mixed<00:01:04.439> number

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
over and our remainder our mixed number

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.910 
over and our remainder our mixed number
is<00:01:05.090> going<00:01:06.090> to<00:01:06.180> have<00:01:06.360> a<00:01:06.600> 1<00:01:06.869> in<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.140> numerator

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
is going to have a 1 in the numerator

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.810 
is going to have a 1 in the numerator
and<00:01:09.560> our<00:01:10.560> denominator<00:01:10.619> always<00:01:11.460> stays<00:01:11.670> the

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
and our denominator always stays the

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.570 
and our denominator always stays the
same<00:01:11.850> since<00:01:12.450> we<00:01:12.570> have<00:01:12.720> a<00:01:12.750> 4<00:01:13.250> denominator<00:01:14.250> in

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
same since we have a 4 denominator in

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.999 
same since we have a 4 denominator in
our<00:01:15.060> fraction<00:01:15.540> or<00:01:15.869> could<00:01:16.080> also<00:01:16.200> have<00:01:16.530> a<00:01:16.560> 4

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
our fraction or could also have a 4

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.929 
our fraction or could also have a 4
denominator<00:01:17.490> in<00:01:17.729> our<00:01:18.030> mixed<00:01:18.299> number<00:01:19.759> so<00:01:20.759> 9

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
denominator in our mixed number so 9

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.440 
denominator in our mixed number so 9
over<00:01:21.180> 4<00:01:21.390> is<00:01:21.689> equal<00:01:21.869> to<00:01:22.350> 2<00:01:22.799> and<00:01:22.830> 1/4<00:01:23.369> and<00:01:24.180> I<00:01:24.240> want

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
over 4 is equal to 2 and 1/4 and I want

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.730 
over 4 is equal to 2 and 1/4 and I want
to<00:01:24.509> show<00:01:24.630> you<00:01:24.689> an<00:01:24.869> illustration<00:01:24.990> so<00:01:25.470> this

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
to show you an illustration so this

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.670 
to show you an illustration so this
makes<00:01:25.950> a<00:01:26.040> little<00:01:26.220> bit<00:01:26.310> more<00:01:26.460> sense<00:01:27.530> since<00:01:28.530> we

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
makes a little bit more sense since we

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.370 
makes a little bit more sense since we
have<00:01:28.829> a<00:01:28.860> whole<00:01:29.070> number<00:01:29.280> of<00:01:29.430> two<00:01:29.820> I'm<00:01:30.259> going<00:01:31.259> to

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
have a whole number of two I'm going to

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.230 
have a whole number of two I'm going to
draw<00:01:31.650> two<00:01:32.549> whole<00:01:32.880> pies<00:01:34.820> and<00:01:35.820> since<00:01:36.119> we're

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
draw two whole pies and since we're

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.030 
draw two whole pies and since we're
dealing<00:01:36.390> with<00:01:36.600> fourths<00:01:37.140> and<00:01:37.259> we<00:01:37.409> have<00:01:37.560> 1/4<00:01:37.860> in

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
dealing with fourths and we have 1/4 in

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.730 
dealing with fourths and we have 1/4 in
our<00:01:38.159> denominator<00:01:38.659> we're<00:01:39.659> going<00:01:39.689> to<00:01:39.990> divide

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
our denominator we're going to divide

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:46.700 
our denominator we're going to divide
these<00:01:40.920> pies<00:01:41.159> into<00:01:41.610> fourths<00:01:45.350> and<00:01:46.350> since<00:01:46.590> we

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
these pies into fourths and since we

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.620 
these pies into fourths and since we
also<00:01:46.890> have<00:01:47.280> a<00:01:47.840> fraction<00:01:48.840> of<00:01:49.369> 1/4<00:01:50.369> I'm<00:01:50.790> going<00:01:51.570> to

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
also have a fraction of 1/4 I'm going to

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.389 
also have a fraction of 1/4 I'm going to
draw<00:01:51.780> an<00:01:51.899> extra<00:01:52.549> 1/4<00:01:53.549> piece<00:01:53.880> of<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.149> pie<00:01:55.399> so

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
draw an extra 1/4 piece of the pie so

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.100 
draw an extra 1/4 piece of the pie so
let's<00:01:56.579> count<00:01:56.790> how<00:01:56.969> many<00:01:57.090> 4<00:01:57.479> for<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.719> pies<00:01:57.899> we

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
let's count how many 4 for the pies we

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:09.160 
let's count how many 4 for the pies we
have<00:01:58.229> total<00:01:58.649> we<00:01:59.369> have<00:01:59.549> 1/4<00:02:00.360> 2<00:02:01.729> 3<00:02:02.780> 4<00:02:03.890> 5<00:02:05.030> 6<00:02:06.030> 7<00:02:06.930> 8<00:02:07.290> 9

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
have total we have 1/4 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.320 
have total we have 1/4 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
we<00:02:10.170> have<00:02:10.319> nine<00:02:10.530> fourths<00:02:10.979> of<00:02:11.370> the<00:02:11.580> pie<00:02:11.760> or<00:02:12.060> 9

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
we have nine fourths of the pie or 9

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.650 
we have nine fourths of the pie or 9
over<00:02:12.599> 4

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
over 4

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.440 
over 4
so<00:02:14.110> hopefully<00:02:14.440> you<00:02:14.560> can<00:02:14.590> see<00:02:14.950> that<00:02:15.880> nine<00:02:16.120> force

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
so hopefully you can see that nine force

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.550 
so hopefully you can see that nine force
of<00:02:16.630> the<00:02:16.720> pie<00:02:16.900> is<00:02:17.850> exactly<00:02:18.850> equal<00:02:19.300> to<00:02:19.350> two<00:02:20.350> whole

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
of the pie is exactly equal to two whole

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:27.090 
of the pie is exactly equal to two whole
pies<00:02:21.570> plus<00:02:22.570> 1/4<00:02:25.590> so<00:02:26.590> hopefully<00:02:26.920> this<00:02:27.070> makes

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100 
pies plus 1/4 so hopefully this makes

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.400 
pies plus 1/4 so hopefully this makes
