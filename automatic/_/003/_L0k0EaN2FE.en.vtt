 this video you will see what are the 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.960
 best tweets of cydia of the month of july 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.300
 of 2013 is a recovery that we have 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.189
 made the guys from the aysÃ©n team to 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.829
 code dot net and without more let's 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:38.570
 show you all these tics by way of 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.570
 ranking we start with the top 5 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:43.210
 because in the first position we have a 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:45.280
 Personalization click is called 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:47.980
 deep end is a tweet that is available 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.199
 free in the rp repository 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:52.360
 3.0 and that the repository goes to 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:53.680
 find is this one here I put it 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:57.309
 down here so you can see the name 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:58.720
 of the repository but it 's rp 3.0 repo 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:00.460
 let's see what this tweet does 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:03.970
 the truth is that it's personalization and 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:05.770
 7 brings us to our iOS 6 fijaros 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:08.380
 that does something as cool as 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:10.360
 next is an effect of ios 7 fix 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.740
 what it does is move the bottom of 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.180
 agreement we can move it from the next 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.979
 way and it's also perfectly 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.750
 configurable as you are going to see now we are going 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:19.030
 to go to the adjustments we're going to go by 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.369
 example to the tweet in question that what 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.990
 we have here type in this is tweet is 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:25.090
 very simple we simply have these 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.740
 three these three bars that by adjusting 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.180
 we are going to be able to make the image 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.210
 background has an effect on us 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:34.350
 we like it more or less we continue with the 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.350
 position number four 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.680
 this position we have a tweet of 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.900
 productivity by calling it from some 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.240
 way is called drop is available in 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.950
 Maya repository mont and dotcoms and 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.720
 It has a price of $ 199 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:49.300
 Americans and do the following 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.980
 improves the contacts application to fix 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.780
 those that we go to our contacts and 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:55.030
 note that this is what makes you look 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.830
 than making a gesture that is of 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.840
 agreement appears to us in all these 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:00.580
 buttons with which we will be able to 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.240
 left to right send one and 1,006 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:05.950
 a sms call send an email a tweet 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.900
 comment on facebook or see the 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.220
 web page that we have associated in this 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:10.690
 contact the truth is that it is quite 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.880
 ok because the contacts application 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.080
 it seems a little poor and the truth 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.940
 that with tweets like this we are going to be able to 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.630
 improve the very much we continue with the 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.630
 position 3 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:24.100
 in position number 2 we have a tweet 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:25.780
 pretty handsome to unlock it 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.000
 integrates with him what they write and do 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.280
 the next thing we're going to what screen we're going 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.400
 to unlock and see what effect 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.250
 pimp is called control a locker is 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.660
 available in the beatbox repository 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.910
 completely free the truth that I do not know 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.320
 know this command from nintendo because it is 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.490
 of the first nintendo agree and 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.740
 we have to do a combination of 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:46.540
 buttons we can click on the combination 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:48.820
 that we want by default 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.830
 to see bird and when we put it 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:52.390
 unblock in this way this tweet is 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.920
 perfectly configurable we are going to 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.390
 the settings we look for control a locker 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.280
 notice that we can activate it 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.350
 disable it change the sequence of the 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.090
 password that we can put the one that 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:02.950
 we want and here we can put 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.330
 the text that we want to appear here 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.370
 well explained I have put ao for 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.170
 nintendo and note that this is what 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.210
 nothing appears just this is the tweet 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:11.710
 it just seems pretty nice to me 

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:14.460
 I recommend it and we will see the 

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:14.460
 position number 2 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:18.820
 sure many of you are 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.320
 lovers of productivity you have 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.970
 thought of more than one occasion how 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:24.010
 launch your applications more 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:25.510
 quickly because I 'm going to teach a 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:27.730
 trickery is actually a tweet that 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.080
 Call urges the launcher is available 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:32.680
 in the epic box repository for a 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:34.720
 price of 199 US dollars and it 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.730
 active by activator I have put a 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.860
 activator gesture such that this one here 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:40.540
 to see if I get pam and notice that this 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:42.670
 it is the tweet to notice that a 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.800
 bar in alphabetical order with all the 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:47.110
 letters and we're going to have all the 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:48.670
 applications ordered by order 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:50.710
 alphabetical this way it really is 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:52.030
 which is a fantastic tweet to launch 

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:53.230
 applications of truth is that it is what 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.050
 better because the truth is that 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.310
 we can go very very fast with this tweet 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:58.900
 I highly recommend it too 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:00.910
 notice that here we have also 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.720
 we can put favorite applications that 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:03.550
 this one I think is perfectly 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.230
 configurable and here we will see by the 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:07.240
 recent ones that we have most 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:08.530
 used is not a very good tweet let's 

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:10.180
 go to the settings so you can see a 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.130
 How does it fit to notice that the 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.780
 tuque this putting installs a being 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:15.220
 note that from here we can activate it 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.320
 with a gesture of activator I have put 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:19.120
 in the status bar a gesture towards the 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.560
 right and fix what we can hide 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.510
 applications so that they do not appear in the 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.400
 set menu that we can see 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:25.780
 recent that we can remove this and 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.400
 we can see also for example then 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:29.470
 nothing favorite apps that 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:31.240
 most we use is not very simple or 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:34.140
 I recommend it and we will finally see the 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.140
 position number one 

00:04:35.569 --> 00:04:39.080
 not then we have reached the end and in this 

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:40.939
 position the number one position we have 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:43.009
 reached the top 1 finally we have one of 

00:04:40.939 --> 00:04:45.649
 favorite sticks one of the best 

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:47.659
 tweets that have come out in cydia this month 

00:04:45.649 --> 00:04:49.399
 at least for my taste it is not 

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:51.649
 available in the beatbox repository 

00:04:49.399 --> 00:04:55.699
 It has a price of $ 199 

00:04:51.649 --> 00:04:57.110
 Americans and it's called tax master is a 

00:04:55.699 --> 00:04:59.089
 fantastic tweet because it improves the 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:01.159
 spotlight in case the spotlight that 

00:04:59.089 --> 00:05:02.449
 this bar that we have here already 

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:04.159
 yes it is very wasted because 

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:06.199
 we have a search engine above and all this 

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:08.360
 from here in principle it is empty but with 

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:10.369
 this tweet you're master fix that what 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:12.529
 fill we have a series of buttons 

00:05:10.369 --> 00:05:14.599
 all to activate disable wifi and 

00:05:12.529 --> 00:05:16.610
 airplane mode bluetooth mode no 

00:05:14.599 --> 00:05:18.770
 bother and notice that making soft 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:20.389
 we will see all these options fijaros 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:21.680
 that works in the following way 

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:22.849
 agreement and note that here too 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:24.499
 we can make ourselves cool to see 

00:05:22.849 --> 00:05:26.029
 information from our network here below 

00:05:24.499 --> 00:05:29.149
 we have buttons to send a tweet a 

00:05:26.029 --> 00:05:31.009
 comment on facebook or a sms or else 

00:05:29.149 --> 00:05:32.869
 one of my six do not notice that up 

00:05:31.009 --> 00:05:34.729
 we also have music controls 

00:05:32.869 --> 00:05:37.099
 we have here the brightness control the 

00:05:34.729 --> 00:05:38.929
 audio control the air play is good 

00:05:37.099 --> 00:05:40.699
 a really interesting tweet because 

00:05:38.929 --> 00:05:41.420
 it brings us things that by default 

00:05:40.699 --> 00:05:43.700
 here we have 

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:45.520
 black obviously the spot there works 

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:47.750
 as normally if we look 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:50.030
 disappear what's below and we go in 

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:51.650
 conventional spotlight not but already of by 

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:53.630
 yeah well we add new things 

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:54.950
 that by default we do not have no, that's why I 

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:56.360
 like this tweet that is also that it is 

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:59.180
 very useful because we can activate as 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:00.920
 You see the 3 that the flash led a lot of 

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:02.390
 interesting things and well this has been 

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:03.980
 all this has been our compilation 

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:05.090
 from aysÃ©n team to code punto net 

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:07.889
 I hope you liked it and see you 

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:10.740
 if you want in a next video 

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:12.120
 leave the fixed changes of the slider what 

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:14.069
 has changed what has put a little more 

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:16.289
 transparent agree that 

00:06:14.069 --> 00:06:20.749
 we have the same button to access the 

00:06:16.289 --> 00:06:20.749
 camera and video and fix
