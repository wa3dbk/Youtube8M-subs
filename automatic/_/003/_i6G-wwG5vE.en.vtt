00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.980
 the escalation is to create education today in the world can diverse city 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.980
 ways and can be perceived in different ways 

00:00:25.659 --> 00:00:28.399
 in my view crossing 

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:31.039
 the most important sanction of this relationship 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:34.130
 you know the one that we understand art like yesterday 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:35.860
 adj 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.230
 the disturbance of the conventions with which we normally understand the world 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:44.030
 petry king against the refugee camp 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.380
 enke it is said sometimes impediments awareness of these conventions 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.570
 are questioned 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.790
 your giving for challenged donation 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:57.330
 in the general sense I think that art educates us a lot makes them think of rafa 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:58.360
 reflects 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.890
 on how highly organized and possibly point to ways 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:07.570
 alternatives I think they are in the country as given or put 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:08.350
 what 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.030
 it is neither thought nor thought 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.250
 sometimes considered a possibility 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:18.070
 sage soon so the app new fields of understanding 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.620
 the context in which we live 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:29.780
 I think the role of the show 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.700
 complexity of a biennial 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.500
 tron the world today 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.410
 taking into account their relation to the importance of art 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:41.410
 in the mega-operation in the broad sense 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:43.920
 containing 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.100
 She's plastic, the penalties even made you try to escape and you're 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:54.280
 possibilities that exist the biennial belongings that tries to escape on the one hand 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.030
 urgency and immediacy 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.070
 for example art films in which only the new account of his 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.120
 news matters 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.619
 the appreciation of the new for the new market 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:12.469
 makes us miss the mansion twelve shops indicated historical threads 

00:02:12.469 --> 00:02:17.469
 hence what preceded it and so is our country pqp inter net 

00:02:18.219 --> 00:02:21.450
 all the contexts in which all artistic-cultural production 

00:02:22.919 --> 00:02:24.069
 the journey 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:26.749
 on the other hand criminal roots should try 

00:02:26.749 --> 00:02:30.650
 also escape the temptation to graduate in museological works 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.420
 in works presented 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.690
 in the history already known already thought assimilated to biennial of certain and also 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:37.750
 to the new 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.179
 for which we still do not know for sure 

00:02:41.179 --> 00:02:45.659
 I gave up the biennial is the place most of the experiment is the place later 

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:48.500
 the police of every process we want 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:53.140
 the place most of the essay what goes up to 100 the biennial place of the retraction speaks and 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:54.229
 of the invention 

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:57.229
 than 

00:02:57.939 --> 00:03:02.249
 suggested price that only comes close with knowledge of the other place 

00:03:02.249 --> 00:03:05.249
 but since the experiment 

00:03:12.139 --> 00:03:14.339
 I think the public votes 

00:03:14.339 --> 00:03:17.339
 of art today in brazil the imbel very restricted public 

00:03:18.399 --> 00:03:20.949
 is still an audience that has 

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:25.849
 is the public that has access to the information circulated 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:26.789
 means 

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:28.389
 a CA 

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:31.279
 this cycle in the company that circulated 

00:03:31.279 --> 00:03:34.199
 in fact in general 

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:37.199
 effect to the public 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:41.970
 the potential 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.019
 is a crooked strain the potential educator 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:46.799
 what art has 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:50.479
 great responsibility of the institutions dealing with the arts in the 

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:52.179
 parents 

00:03:52.179 --> 00:03:56.469
 it is desirable that the secretaries in the center of the 

00:03:56.469 --> 00:03:59.109
 state of culture in the center state of prefectures 

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:00.949
 expand this access 

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:02.239
 darci 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:06.819
 because this access of the eyes does not create the most different levels of the 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:11.469
 population is being provided to those people who do not have 

00:04:11.469 --> 00:04:12.809
 still access to art 

00:04:12.809 --> 00:04:13.849
 formal 

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:16.039
 different alternatives 

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:17.559
 then cement 

00:04:17.559 --> 00:04:21.289
 understanding of the world to which they belong 

00:04:21.819 --> 00:04:25.580
 then the pope a very great stumble and still and to the creation 

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:28.740
 given audience 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:33.259
 of art in the country and is fundamental not only for communities thinking about 

00:04:33.259 --> 00:04:38.120
 terms of the market in terms of fusion of the dataprom the artistic production 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.389
 important for the generation 

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:46.350
 understanding of the world but becomes more complex - pope rooted in the 

00:04:46.349 --> 00:04:47.949
 repertoire 

00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:51.990
 everyday with any cost a song understand christmas
