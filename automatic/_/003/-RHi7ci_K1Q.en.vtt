left foot we take you out the cart demo

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.470 
left foot we take you out the cart demo
it<00:02:10.860> but<00:02:11.340> basically<00:02:11.489> you're<00:02:11.910> keeping<00:02:12.239> the<00:02:12.330> gas

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
it but basically you're keeping the gas

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.090 
it but basically you're keeping the gas
on<00:02:12.750> you're<00:02:12.989> adding<00:02:13.290> in<00:02:13.410> some<00:02:13.440> break<00:02:13.799> to<00:02:13.980> get

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
on you're adding in some break to get

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.300 
on you're adding in some break to get
weight<00:02:14.280> forward<00:02:15.200> curing<00:02:16.200> understeer<00:02:16.620> these

weight forward curing understeer these

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.130 
weight forward curing understeer these
guys<00:02:17.519> and<00:02:17.700> girls<00:02:17.940> are<00:02:18.090> driving<00:02:18.209> cars<00:02:18.600> flat<00:02:18.959> out

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
guys and girls are driving cars flat out

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.199 
guys and girls are driving cars flat out
and<00:02:19.440> they're<00:02:20.220> using<00:02:20.459> the<00:02:20.700> tools<00:02:20.940> that<00:02:21.030> we've

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
and they're using the tools that we've

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:22.699 
and they're using the tools that we've
presented<00:02:21.360> to<00:02:21.720> them<00:02:21.810> and<00:02:22.140> hopefully<00:02:22.440> it's

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
presented to them and hopefully it's

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:25.850 
presented to them and hopefully it's
working<00:02:23.100> then<00:02:23.400> we<00:02:23.760> go<00:02:24.030> into<00:02:24.480> different<00:02:25.410> types

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
working then we go into different types

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.229 
working then we go into different types
of<00:02:26.040> vehicles<00:02:26.220> front-wheel<00:02:26.790> drive<00:02:26.940> all<00:02:27.150> wheel

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
of vehicles front-wheel drive all wheel

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:29.360 
of vehicles front-wheel drive all wheel
drive<00:02:27.480> in<00:02:27.600> river<00:02:28.019> then<00:02:28.680> we<00:02:28.830> go<00:02:28.980> different

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
drive in river then we go different

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.150 
drive in river then we go different
types<00:02:29.580> of<00:02:29.730> corners<00:02:30.209> so<00:02:31.110> we<00:02:31.320> have<00:02:31.500> different

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
types of corners so we have different

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.820 
types of corners so we have different
types<00:02:32.370> of<00:02:32.519> breaking<00:02:33.110> different<00:02:34.110> ways<00:02:34.560> of

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
types of breaking different ways of

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.520 
types of breaking different ways of
breaking<00:02:35.070> different<00:02:35.880> types<00:02:36.390> of<00:02:36.630> corners<00:02:37.170> say

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
breaking different types of corners say

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.710 
breaking different types of corners say
decreasing<00:02:38.340> radius<00:02:38.519> increasing<00:02:39.239> radius<00:02:39.570> up

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
hills down hills crest turns hairpins

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.300 
hills down hills crest turns hairpins
junctions<00:02:42.420> and<00:02:42.510> we<00:02:43.410> break<00:02:43.620> each<00:02:43.830> thing<00:02:44.100> down

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
junctions and we break each thing down

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.009 
junctions and we break each thing down
and<00:02:44.549> then<00:02:44.640> we<00:02:44.760> stat<00:02:45.000> slowly<00:02:45.390> putting<00:02:45.720> them<00:02:45.900> all

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:46.019 
and then we stat slowly putting them all

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:49.039 
and then we stat slowly putting them all
together<00:02:46.200> so<00:02:47.040> as<00:02:47.310> you<00:02:47.670> get<00:02:47.910> good<00:02:48.239> at<00:02:48.390> one<00:02:48.600> skill

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:49.049 
together so as you get good at one skill

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:51.770 
together so as you get good at one skill
we<00:02:49.709> then<00:02:50.130> teach<00:02:50.820> you<00:02:50.970> another<00:02:51.239> skill<00:02:51.570> and<00:02:51.720> you

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
we then teach you another skill and you

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.090 
we then teach you another skill and you
take<00:02:51.959> those<00:02:52.140> two<00:02:52.320> skills<00:02:52.650> and<00:02:52.830> learn<00:02:52.950> the

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
take those two skills and learn the

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.370 
take those two skills and learn the
third<00:02:53.310> skill<00:02:53.580> and<00:02:53.730> it<00:02:53.790> keeps<00:02:53.970> going<00:02:54.180> until<00:02:54.480> you

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
third skill and it keeps going until you

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.950 
third skill and it keeps going until you
have<00:02:55.680> anywhere<00:02:56.610> five

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:57.960 
have anywhere five

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.530 
have anywhere five

ten ways of breaking in different types

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.480 
ten ways of breaking in different types
of<00:03:00.660> surfaces<00:03:00.900> in<00:03:01.440> different<00:03:02.160> types<00:03:02.370> of

of surfaces in different types of

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:04.730 
of surfaces in different types of
conditions<00:03:03.090> and<00:03:03.270> we<00:03:03.870> just<00:03:04.080> build<00:03:04.290> it<00:03:04.440> up<00:03:04.530> and

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:04.740 
conditions and we just build it up and

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.350 
conditions and we just build it up and
it's<00:03:04.830> a<00:03:04.890> crawl<00:03:05.190> walk<00:03:05.460> run<00:03:05.520> thing<00:03:06.090> a<00:03:06.120> weight

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
it's a crawl walk run thing a weight

it's a crawl walk run thing a weight
transfer<00:03:06.960> basically<00:03:07.830> weight<00:03:08.430> forward<00:03:08.940> is

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
transfer basically weight forward is

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.090 
transfer basically weight forward is
going<00:03:09.390> to<00:03:09.450> cure<00:03:09.720> understeer<00:03:10.350> maybe<00:03:10.680> custom

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
going to cure understeer maybe custom

control you tend to look at things you

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:56.150 
control you tend to look at things you
don't<00:03:54.300> want<00:03:54.480> it<00:03:54.690> so<00:03:55.380> we<00:03:55.530> teach<00:03:55.740> you<00:03:55.890> to<00:03:55.980> look
