00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.140
 semblance of democracy in several 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:33.780

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:35.760
 only these countries do not have 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.690
 fundamentals to support a 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.690
 democracy 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:45.370
 simple rules such as 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.370
 tolerance towards the opposition 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:52.580

 god different from ours or tolerate that a 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:58.580
 reporter may disagree 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:01:00.230
 with this semblant of president and you 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:00.800
 think you can just parade 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.090
 in these countries 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.220
 based on some principles 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:06.950
 religious fundamentalists let go 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:10.120
 some good topple a dictator and 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.120
 start a democracy 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:28.320
 this is me laughing the people do not desire 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:32.940
 not freedom 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.940
 he wants the boundaries of the rules 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:39.600
 protection against invaders is 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:39.600
 against themselves 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.890
 people need a leader who him 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:48.870
 provides both support and fixes 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.870
 limits not to sink into chaos 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:02:01.080
 give them that and they will follow you and 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:01.080
 this is where jean franÃ§aix 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.970
 you most convenient
