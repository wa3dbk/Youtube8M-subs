00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 and everyone is happy for the towel in this 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:08.010
 video I will tell you about the tactics of pumping 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:10.050
 just quiet or town hall before this video on 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.019
 u-tubo wow was not there and so i will 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.630
 first think you should know people 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.359
 What kind of tactics are they ? 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:21.390
 right often seen homeless people whose base 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:24.949
 that's how I have that is not pumped and 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:28.230
 nothing and then pumped to the end quietly 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:31.050
 in any of them often saw her now I tell you 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.420
 I will explain about them what it is 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:37.620
 people who either ask or six 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:40.140
 500 thousand crystals all bought in 1690 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.450
 either who pumped dx 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.120
 farme resources that is quiet every 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.680
 It will be approximately six days and hares 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.550
 one of them is quite real drive on 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.940
 the next d. 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:56.449
 I'm just here to these people, I am 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:59.399
 apnul with tx 6 not pumped yes you x 10 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:04.019
 place x6 pumped in my opinion to toho 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:07.680
 10 in about a month or a fortnight 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:09.990
 somewhere so it is very fast and I 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.680
 my friend who for example here we are both 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:16.020
 when we were on tx6 not pumped and how 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.290
 would start he started pumping completely 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.860
 in it now I'm completely pumped like 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:25.560
 you see 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:27.840
 Upnul tth you x10 I would have him but in the end, then 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.329
 there is a better day at the base and in principle 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.430
 if you want to be denoted to you 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.920
 This strategy is suitable but there is one 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.409
 great but you will need to look 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.079
 opponents who are you h9 h10 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:43.920
 and as a last resort it will explain why x8 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:46.590
 overall the shape gets on by 50 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.420
 percent less that is before that 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.700
 my if I am not mistaken 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.220
 there were ten percent of all resources 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.259
 available now you will be available five 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.350
 percent but the maximum margin 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:00.890
 resources will be increased by 50,000 from 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:04.770
 each level of town hall and this 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.610
 I won't consider it in principle 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.100
 lot 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:11.860
 here but there is one big but less 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:14.470
 I want to waste by 25 percent 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:17.080
 there is for example here and x 9 I see at 25 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:22.120
 percent less rest resources 8 over 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:23.080
 50 and so on, that's why you 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.560
 will need to look 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:29.530
 you h9 h10 as a last resort to x8 and 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.550
 this is why this strategy does not fit 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.040
 for noobs 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:36.190
 sorry for the expression well, not for noobs 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.959
 for those who can not attack that is 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.900
 if you know how the case is covered by 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:44.200
 fits you break fast and if 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:46.959
 taking out you have to swing mine now 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:49.390
 and I want to, as it were at the same time does not, in principle, 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:52.480
 forman no problem but for 1 and swing 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:54.940
 mine if you do not know how it will have 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.550
 wait until the mines accumulate 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:59.709
 accumulate resources ok and immediately again 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:01.570
 mines and so all the time all the time all 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:03.220
 time and so on until you have 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:04.540
 ok resources while he is not pumping 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:08.080
 base and exactly 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:10.810
 well this way you will be slower 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:14.230
 development than your understandable for suddenly 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:15.700
 like mine, that's why you need these 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:19.510
 if you know how to do well 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:24.100
 attack well attack otherwise 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:28.720
 case I advise you too I can 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:31.480
 believe that everyone will hate you 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.260
 because so how would the homeless nobody 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:37.760
 loves 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:40.579
 In principle, this is all a few drawbacks. 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:43.310
 and if you could fit such 

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:45.739
 minus it I advise you still not 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:48.739
 do it otherwise you just ruin 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:53.659
 imagine the game in principle is all you need 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:55.489
 should know about pumping quietly i hope 

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:56.659
 that this video helped you a day of such 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:59.150
 there is no yu tuba 

00:03:56.659 --> 00:04:02.209
 this pension needs to go only separately 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:05.269
 sources taken like clash sites 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:07.609
 of clans and finally 

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:09.950
 wanted to tell my plan my secret advice 

00:04:07.609 --> 00:04:12.739
 which I created just recently before 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:15.079
 as you know, I had a plan for egg leaders 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:16.940
 which in principle is now there for my 

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:19.609
 friend was given the head 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:22.580
 from there now goes on the sly 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:23.930
 the players over there are 50 people and 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:27.520
 here slowly they come here now 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:30.289
 already ten people in principle when you 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:32.720
 see this video probably there will already be 

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:35.720
 about thirty people so I now announce 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:38.599
 set in this clan plan is friendly with us 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:44.270
 good atmosphere and atmosphere 

00:04:38.599 --> 00:04:48.740
 we have a set of pumped you h 5d x5 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:52.750
 so come I am waiting for you and to all everyone 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:52.750
 thank you all bye
