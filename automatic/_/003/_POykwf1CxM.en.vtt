field and the other thing is that you

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.639 
field and the other thing is that you
can<00:00:35.309> easily<00:00:36.000> make<00:00:36.180> it<00:00:36.390> an<00:00:36.540> overload<00:00:37.020> left<00:00:37.350> or

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
can easily make it an overload left or

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.459 
can easily make it an overload left or
right<00:00:38.040> or<00:00:38.329> you<00:00:39.329> know<00:00:39.480> you<00:00:39.540> can<00:00:39.930> make<00:00:40.079> it<00:00:40.290> a

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
right or you know you can make it a

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.250 
right or you know you can make it a
coverage<00:00:41.460> defense<00:00:41.940> or<00:00:42.390> you<00:00:42.780> can<00:00:42.930> make<00:00:43.050> it<00:00:43.200> a

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
coverage defense or you can make it a

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.170 
coverage defense or you can make it a
double<00:00:43.440> overload<00:00:44.010> either<00:00:44.489> on<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:44.820> left<00:00:45.000> side

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
double overload either on the left side

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.209 
double overload either on the left side
or<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.450> right<00:00:45.539> side<00:00:45.690> or<00:00:46.170> on<00:00:46.530> just<00:00:46.800> one<00:00:47.010> side

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
or the right side or on just one side

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.299 
or the right side or on just one side
for<00:00:47.640> example<00:00:48.180> let's<00:00:48.870> say<00:00:49.559> we<00:00:49.680> just<00:00:49.860> wanted<00:00:50.190> an

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
for example let's say we just wanted an

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.610 
for example let's say we just wanted an
overload<00:00:50.730> to<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.090> left<00:00:51.390> so<00:00:52.050> what<00:00:52.379> you<00:00:52.469> could

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
overload to the left so what you could

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:53.660 
overload to the left so what you could
do<00:00:52.739> is<00:00:52.829> you<00:00:52.920> can<00:00:53.039> either<00:00:53.250> spread<00:00:53.460> your

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
do is you can either spread your

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.250 
do is you can either spread your
linebackers<00:00:53.879> which<00:00:54.420> will<00:00:54.570> turn<00:00:54.719> it<00:00:54.870> into<00:00:54.989> like

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
linebackers which will turn it into like

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.350 
linebackers which will turn it into like
a<00:00:55.289> big<00:00:55.860> gap<00:00:56.039> where<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.280> linebacker<00:00:56.879> will<00:00:57.149> come

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
a big gap where the linebacker will come

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.599 
a big gap where the linebacker will come
in<00:00:57.539> or<00:00:58.530> if<00:00:58.620> you<00:00:58.710> want<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:58.949> defensive<00:00:59.399> end<00:00:59.489> you

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
in or if you want the defensive end you

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.250 
in or if you want the defensive end you
get<00:00:59.730> there<00:00:59.850> faster<00:01:00.210> you<00:01:00.300> can<00:01:00.359> show<00:01:00.660> blitz<00:01:00.930> and

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
get there faster you can show blitz and

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.070 
get there faster you can show blitz and
then<00:01:02.010> reboots<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.760> linebacker<00:01:03.329> on<00:01:03.629> that<00:01:03.840> side

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
then reboots the linebacker on that side

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.230 
then reboots the linebacker on that side
and<00:01:04.290> move<00:01:04.439> them<00:01:04.650> out<00:01:04.739> as<00:01:05.010> far<00:01:05.489> as<00:01:05.580> you<00:01:05.670> can<00:01:05.880> let

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
and move them out as far as you can let

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.020 
and move them out as far as you can let
them<00:01:06.330> come<00:01:06.540> back<00:01:06.750> in<00:01:06.960> and<00:01:07.260> then<00:01:08.070> you<00:01:08.670> should<00:01:08.850> be

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
them come back in and then you should be

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.370 
them come back in and then you should be
able<00:01:09.119> to<00:01:09.270> get<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.510> defensive<00:01:09.990> end<00:01:10.080> running

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
able to get the defensive end running

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.719 
able to get the defensive end running
straight<00:01:10.619> in<00:01:10.799> at<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:10.979> quarterback<00:01:11.369> that

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
straight in at the quarterback that

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.520 
straight in at the quarterback that
would<00:01:11.880> be<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.150> fastest<00:01:12.570> way<00:01:12.689> to<00:01:12.869> get<00:01:13.140> it<00:01:13.290> in<00:01:13.439> on

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
would be the fastest way to get it in on

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.740 
would be the fastest way to get it in on
that<00:01:13.740> side<00:01:14.040> same<00:01:14.820> thing<00:01:14.850> for<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.270> other<00:01:15.390> side

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
that side same thing for the other side

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.969 
that side same thing for the other side
just<00:01:16.590> show<00:01:16.830> blitz<00:01:17.100> and<00:01:17.430> then<00:01:17.790> re<00:01:18.150> blue<00:01:18.710> as<00:01:19.710> I

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
just show blitz and then re blue as I

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.649 
just show blitz and then re blue as I
try<00:01:20.220> to<00:01:20.250> move<00:01:20.460> them<00:01:20.580> out<00:01:20.759> a<00:01:20.790> couple<00:01:21.030> steps<00:01:21.420> and

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
try to move them out a couple steps and

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.870 
try to move them out a couple steps and
then<00:01:22.530> you<00:01:23.100> should<00:01:23.280> be<00:01:23.400> able<00:01:23.490> to<00:01:23.640> get<00:01:23.729> the

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
then you should be able to get the

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.450 
then you should be able to get the
defensive<00:01:24.390> end<00:01:24.590> now<00:01:25.590> if<00:01:25.710> you<00:01:25.830> do<00:01:25.979> that<00:01:26.130> to<00:01:26.310> both

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
defensive end now if you do that to both

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.310 
defensive end now if you do that to both
sides<00:01:26.729> then<00:01:27.090> you<00:01:27.600> could<00:01:27.780> turn<00:01:27.900> it<00:01:28.080> into<00:01:28.140> a

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
sides then you could turn it into a

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.219 
sides then you could turn it into a
double<00:01:28.560> overload<00:01:29.070> blitz<00:01:29.810> coming<00:01:30.810> from<00:01:31.049> both

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
double overload blitz coming from both

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.950 
double overload blitz coming from both
sides<00:01:31.500> now<00:01:32.040> if<00:01:32.369> you<00:01:32.790> wanted<00:01:33.150> to<00:01:33.270> get<00:01:33.390> a<00:01:33.450> corner

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
in the purple zone but either way will

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.440 
in the purple zone but either way will
not<00:01:46.170> have<00:01:46.409> a<00:01:46.439> corner<00:01:46.860> coming<00:01:47.700> in<00:01:47.970> off<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.119> edge

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
there he might go through the B gap but

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.520 
there he might go through the B gap but
usually<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.180> C<00:01:51.390> gap<00:01:51.600> again<00:01:52.170> you<00:01:52.320> could<00:01:52.409> do

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
usually the C gap again you could do

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.080 
usually the C gap again you could do
that<00:01:52.619> to<00:01:52.799> both<00:01:52.950> sides<00:01:53.220> just<00:01:53.549> bring<00:01:53.850> both
