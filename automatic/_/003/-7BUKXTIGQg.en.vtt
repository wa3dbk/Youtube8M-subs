00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:12.799
 hello today is I wanted to teach surfing 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:14.970
 Perez leaders rat tails or bridges 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:17.040
 cali crib 

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:19.620
 many of you who practice the 

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:21.780
 surf casting and know but 

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:24.660
 those for those who do not know 

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:28.880
 They are 15-meter stretches of nylon 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.810
 they start very thin they finish thick 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.240
 usually on the surfing reels 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:37.410
 castings are usually coils with lines 

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:39.960
 small diameters 0 12 0 14 16 18 20 of 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.270
 up to 25 yes we launch 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.910
 directly with that thread we would break 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.160
 then they usually put a few meters 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.950
 final 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:51.739
 of thicker yarn if we put 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:54.800
 for example directly a stretch of 10 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:56.690
 meters of a 0 50 millimeters and what 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.180
 we can join a very fine line 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:03.470
 first, it's going to cost a lot and 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:05.479
 second that the knot will be very fat and 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:08.300
 at the time of going through the rings in the 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:10.310
 moment of the haul will stop us from art 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.979
 idea of â€‹â€‹these rat tails are started 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.800
 very very finite so we can make a 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:17.010
 knot 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:20.450
 of very discreet union that happens very well 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:24.049
 through the rings we have in lance 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:26.750
 and that in the end they end up in a very 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:30.220
 thick that allows us to launch without any 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:33.540
 problem and without any risk of breaking 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:37.500
 in this case they come in three colors 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.500
 transparent red and yellow 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:42.820
 the red in yellow is a matter of 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.770
 visibility for example if we're 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.650
 fishing at night we take the tail of 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:50.470
 yellow rat when we have the fish to 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:52.000
 15 meters then plugging in with the 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.310
 lantern we will know if it comes from the 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.900
 right if it does not come from the left and 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.570
 how much we need to get to the shore 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:01.210
 which is the more it is where more stretches in 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:03.530
 the fish then helps us to have a 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:06.619
 little more control 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.509
 the red would be the same but in the day of 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:10.429
 day would be much more visible than a 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:13.970
 transparent the transparent so that 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:17.120
 looking for maximum invisibility 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:21.550
 fish can not reveal because of a color 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.550
 then it goes a little to taste 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:27.600
 another advantage of these rat tails like 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.130
 now you will see is that they have very little 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.400
 memory 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:36.640
 if you notice what I just got out of the 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:40.030
 coil and has virtually no loops 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:42.160
 and if you have them a little about what 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.500
 unlike others that when 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.060
 you take out of the coil has many 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.940
 news of the many laps 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.530
 loops have a lot of memory that's a 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.130
 risk when you put it on the reel 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:55.660
 because it usually happens 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:58.500
 the first sets 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:01.050
 only the reel thread comes out 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:04.080
 so what is the risk when launching 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:07.520
 come out more than one spiral at a time 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:09.320
 coil and make it public 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:11.480
 in this case although they are a few tails of 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:13.810
 rat with very little memory that is 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:17.080
 minimize a lot 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:19.319
 and I do not expect you to try them and I 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.319
 like
