 what if you say this and 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:23.279

 clicking on the screen may why may 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:35.130

 happened and here is such a screen here 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.969
 to unlock 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.620
 the probability is much less random 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.229
 way here is the movement you need 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.720
 conduct 

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:09.360

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:31.820
 photography method is the so-called 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:31.820
 pattern key continue 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.540
 confirm 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.100

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:51.060
 screen random you don't 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:53.430
 unlock here but here there is one 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.360
 scary and unpleasant things on this already 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.740
 very many got burned 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.509
 assume a random button press 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.360
 happened and your smartphone lies in 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:05.700
 pocket for this is the child who took your 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.729
 smartphone in hand is just playing with it 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.670
 draws some figures here that is 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.870
 there are many situations in life when 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.150
 repeatedly who tries his 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.340
 unlock keep in mind that for 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.739
 some smartphone options there are 20 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:22.560
 time you can try not right 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:23.730
 enter key in some cases five times 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.620
 wrong after which the smartphone 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.549

 access to the smartphone get 

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:39.180
 Here is such a trouble is there is a pin code 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:42.530
 accordingly it means to replace 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:48.420
 by some four-digit input number 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:53.100
 reject let's take this away now 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:56.510
 all ugliness just do hold 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:03:00.269
 finger removed this pattern 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:01.560
 that means what to do if 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:06.810

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:14.819
 shelves 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:19.829
 then it is possible to remove your smartphone 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:21.769
 a graphic key using a computer about 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:25.049
 you can talk separately 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:27.299
 is there another way your smartphone then 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:28.670

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:33.600
 it is done if the smartphone is locked 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:37.560
 when you turn on the smartphone at the same time 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:40.769
 press a key up here and connect 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:43.230
 power cord then it will enter special 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:45.060
 the mode of it can be made complete 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:47.480
 restoring the system but all 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.510
 everything on the smartphone will be erased 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:52.290
