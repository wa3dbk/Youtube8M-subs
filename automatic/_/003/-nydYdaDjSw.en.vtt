00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:08.740 
hi there today I'm going to show you a
demonstration<00:00:06.359> on<00:00:07.080> the<00:00:07.740> difference<00:00:08.189> between

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:08.750 
demonstration on the difference between

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.100 
demonstration on the difference between
diesel<00:00:09.750> engine<00:00:10.349> and<00:00:10.469> a<00:00:10.950> gasoline<00:00:11.519> engine

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:12.110 
diesel engine and a gasoline engine

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:15.880 
diesel engine and a gasoline engine
first<00:00:13.110> I'll<00:00:13.530> show<00:00:13.889> you<00:00:13.950> the<00:00:14.790> gasoline<00:00:15.420> engine

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:15.890 
first I'll show you the gasoline engine

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:19.970 
first I'll show you the gasoline engine
here<00:00:16.890> we<00:00:17.039> have<00:00:17.250> the<00:00:18.119> piston<00:00:18.660> which<00:00:19.410> is<00:00:19.560> inside

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
here we have the piston which is inside

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.790 
here we have the piston which is inside
the<00:00:20.189> cylinders<00:00:20.760> with<00:00:21.539> an<00:00:21.720> exhaust<00:00:22.109> valve<00:00:22.470> an

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
the cylinders with an exhaust valve an

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.150 
the cylinders with an exhaust valve an
intake<00:00:23.250> valve<00:00:23.550> and<00:00:23.880> spark<00:00:24.390> plug<00:00:24.660> now<00:00:25.560> what

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
intake valve and spark plug now what

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.439 
intake valve and spark plug now what
happens<00:00:26.519> is<00:00:26.760> the<00:00:27.359> piston<00:00:27.840> will<00:00:27.990> come<00:00:28.230> down<00:00:28.830> as

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:29.449 
happens is the piston will come down as

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:32.179 
happens is the piston will come down as
the<00:00:30.449> crankshaft<00:00:31.050> turns<00:00:31.410> it<00:00:31.679> will<00:00:31.830> pull<00:00:32.040> the

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
the crankshaft turns it will pull the

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.389 
the crankshaft turns it will pull the
piston<00:00:32.399> down<00:00:32.790> and<00:00:33.120> draw<00:00:33.750> fresh<00:00:34.440> and<00:00:34.770> mixed

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
piston down and draw fresh and mixed

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.850 
piston down and draw fresh and mixed
with<00:00:35.640> gasoline<00:00:36.420> into<00:00:37.140> a<00:00:37.320> nice<00:00:37.559> vapor<00:00:38.180> mix<00:00:39.860> draw

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.049 
with gasoline into a nice vapor mix draw
it<00:00:40.890> in<00:00:41.160> and<00:00:41.430> then<00:00:43.129> what<00:00:44.129> will<00:00:44.280> happen<00:00:44.640> is<00:00:44.789> after

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
it in and then what will happen is after

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.420 
it in and then what will happen is after
it<00:00:45.360> draws<00:00:45.600> it<00:00:45.809> in<00:00:45.960> all<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:46.710> vowels<00:00:47.039> will<00:00:47.340> be

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
it draws it in all the vowels will be

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.150 
it draws it in all the vowels will be
closed<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:48.450> crankshaft<00:00:49.260> will<00:00:49.530> continue<00:00:50.010> to

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
closed the crankshaft will continue to

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.170 
closed the crankshaft will continue to
turn<00:00:50.460> and<00:00:50.960> push<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.140> piston<00:00:52.320> back<00:00:52.710> up

turn and push the piston back up

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.880 
turn and push the piston back up
compressing<00:00:54.180> that<00:00:54.360> air<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.930> end<00:00:55.230> fuel<00:00:55.710> that

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
compressing that air the end fuel that

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.900 
compressing that air the end fuel that
was<00:00:56.039> in<00:00:56.510> then<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.870> spark<00:00:58.350> plug<00:00:58.649> will<00:00:59.250> send<00:00:59.609> a

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
was in then the spark plug will send a

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.450 
was in then the spark plug will send a
little<00:01:00.359> spark<00:01:00.780> into<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.500> air-fuel<00:01:02.430> mixture

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
little spark into the air-fuel mixture

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.710 
little spark into the air-fuel mixture
that's<00:01:02.989> compressed<00:01:03.989> and<00:01:04.260> it<00:01:04.830> will<00:01:04.979> explode

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:05.720 
that's compressed and it will explode

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.450 
that's compressed and it will explode
forcing<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:06.750> piston<00:01:07.200> down<00:01:07.409> and<00:01:07.799> in<00:01:08.220> turn

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
forcing the piston down and in turn

continue to turn pushing the piston back

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.330 
continue to turn pushing the piston back
up<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.780> exhaust<00:01:19.110> valve<00:01:19.470> will<00:01:19.650> be<00:01:19.799> open<00:01:20.189> and

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
up the exhaust valve will be open and

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.690 
up the exhaust valve will be open and
the<00:01:20.880> exhaust<00:01:21.180> gases<00:01:21.509> will<00:01:21.930> flow<00:01:22.229> out<00:01:22.520> and<00:01:23.520> that

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
the exhaust gases will flow out and that

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.210 
the exhaust gases will flow out and that
completes<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.270> cycle<00:01:24.830> on<00:01:25.830> a<00:01:25.890> diesel<00:01:26.640> engine

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220 
completes the cycle on a diesel engine

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.749 
completes the cycle on a diesel engine
slightly<00:01:29.220> different<00:01:30.470> fresh<00:01:31.470> clean<00:01:31.950> air<00:01:32.400> is

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
slightly different fresh clean air is

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.359 
slightly different fresh clean air is
drawn<00:01:33.390> in<00:01:33.659> by<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:33.930> piston<00:01:34.470> with<00:01:34.770> no<00:01:35.009> fuel

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
drawn in by the piston with no fuel

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.499 
drawn in by the piston with no fuel
mixed<00:01:35.759> into<00:01:36.119> it<00:01:36.380> then<00:01:37.380> it<00:01:38.040> is<00:01:38.100> compressed<00:01:38.909> just

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
mixed into it then it is compressed just

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.810 
mixed into it then it is compressed just
like<00:01:39.720> before<00:01:40.130> piston<00:01:41.130> will<00:01:41.250> come<00:01:41.430> up<00:01:41.610> and

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
like before piston will come up and

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.840 
like before piston will come up and
compress<00:01:42.299> it<00:01:42.540> then<00:01:43.020> was<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:44.070> main<00:01:44.280> difference

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
compress it then was the main difference

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.530 
compress it then was the main difference
is<00:01:45.090> what<00:01:46.079> happens<00:01:46.439> now<00:01:46.729> the<00:01:47.729> air<00:01:48.060> will<00:01:48.390> be

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
is what happens now the air will be

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.010 
is what happens now the air will be
compressed<00:01:49.020> at<00:01:49.350> a<00:01:49.470> very<00:01:49.829> high<00:01:49.950> pressure<00:01:50.579> and

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
compressed at a very high pressure and

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.660 
compressed at a very high pressure and
diesel<00:01:52.020> fuel<00:01:52.049> will<00:01:52.530> be<00:01:52.619> injected<00:01:53.280> through<00:01:53.310> an

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
diesel fuel will be injected through an

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.410 
diesel fuel will be injected through an
injector<00:01:54.240> and<00:01:54.420> another<00:01:55.350> very<00:01:55.740> high<00:01:56.009> pressure

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
injector and another very high pressure

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.179 
injector and another very high pressure
which<00:01:57.420> will<00:01:57.689> cause<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:58.500> diesel<00:01:58.920> fuel<00:01:59.159> to

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
which will cause the diesel fuel to

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.999 
which will cause the diesel fuel to
explode<00:01:59.969> simply<00:02:00.930> because<00:02:01.290> it's<00:02:01.469> under<00:02:01.710> such

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
explode simply because it's under such

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.539 
explode simply because it's under such
high<00:02:02.250> pressure<00:02:02.579> and<00:02:02.939> that<00:02:03.240> will<00:02:03.360> just<00:02:03.390> explode

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:04.549 
high pressure and that will just explode

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:08.749 
high pressure and that will just explode
forcing<00:02:05.549> the<00:02:05.579> piston<00:02:06.060> down<00:02:06.500> then<00:02:07.580> just<00:02:08.580> like

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
forcing the piston down then just like

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:09.910 
forcing the piston down then just like
before<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.479> crank

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
before the crank

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.699 
before the crank
we'll<00:02:10.250> push<00:02:10.490> the<00:02:10.670> piston<00:02:10.849> up<00:02:11.330> and<00:02:11.900> the<00:02:12.349> exhaust

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
we'll push the piston up and the exhaust

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:16.660 
we'll push the piston up and the exhaust
will<00:02:12.950> flow<00:02:13.160> out<00:02:14.170> the<00:02:15.170> parts<00:02:15.590> of<00:02:15.800> these<00:02:16.130> engines

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
will flow out the parts of these engines

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.990 
will flow out the parts of these engines
are<00:02:16.870> pretty<00:02:17.870> similar<00:02:18.280> you<00:02:19.280> have<00:02:19.430> a<00:02:19.459> but<00:02:19.790> the

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
are pretty similar you have a but the

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.030 
are pretty similar you have a but the
main<00:02:20.180> difference<00:02:20.660> is<00:02:20.810> you<00:02:21.050> have<00:02:21.230> a<00:02:21.260> carburetor

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
main difference is you have a carburetor

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:27.040 
main difference is you have a carburetor
on<00:02:22.280> the<00:02:23.150> gas<00:02:23.330> engine<00:02:23.959> which<00:02:24.739> will<00:02:25.840> mix<00:02:26.840> the

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
on the gas engine which will mix the

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.580 
on the gas engine which will mix the
fuel<00:02:27.380> with<00:02:27.680> the<00:02:27.920> air<00:02:28.100> and<00:02:28.730> make<00:02:29.000> it<00:02:29.120> like<00:02:29.480> a

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
fuel with the air and make it like a

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.240 
fuel with the air and make it like a
gaseous<00:02:30.590> mixture<00:02:31.340> like<00:02:31.970> a<00:02:32.000> vapor<00:02:32.770> so<00:02:33.770> that<00:02:34.100> it

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
gaseous mixture like a vapor so that it

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.460 
gaseous mixture like a vapor so that it
can<00:02:34.400> burn<00:02:34.610> because<00:02:34.880> gasoline<00:02:35.270> won't<00:02:35.840> burn<00:02:36.110> has

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
can burn because gasoline won't burn has

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.460 
can burn because gasoline won't burn has
liquid<00:02:37.100> it<00:02:37.280> has<00:02:37.489> to<00:02:37.670> be<00:02:37.930> vaporized<00:02:38.930> in<00:02:39.200> order

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
liquid it has to be vaporized in order

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.370 
liquid it has to be vaporized in order
to<00:02:39.590> burn<00:02:39.800> but<00:02:40.610> it<00:02:40.760> still<00:02:41.060> has<00:02:41.239> the<00:02:41.630> intake<00:02:42.350> and

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
to burn but it still has the intake and

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.020 
to burn but it still has the intake and
exhaust<00:02:42.650> valve<00:02:43.250> and<00:02:43.610> the<00:02:44.300> piston<00:02:44.810> rod<00:02:45.140> and

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
exhaust valve and the piston rod and

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.479 
exhaust valve and the piston rod and
crankshaft<00:02:47.530> but<00:02:48.530> the<00:02:48.709> difference<00:02:49.130> is<00:02:49.280> the

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:49.489 
crankshaft but the difference is the

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:53.470 
crankshaft but the difference is the
spark<00:02:49.819> plug<00:02:50.090> and<00:02:50.360> the<00:02:51.489> carburetor<00:02:52.489> which<00:02:53.269> is

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
spark plug and the carburetor which is

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.890 
spark plug and the carburetor which is
then<00:02:53.720> compared<00:02:54.260> to<00:02:54.440> just<00:02:54.739> an<00:02:55.100> air<00:02:55.519> filter<00:02:55.900> that

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
then compared to just an air filter that

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.050 
then compared to just an air filter that
will<00:02:57.200> filter<00:02:57.650> the<00:02:57.830> particles<00:02:58.549> out<00:02:58.700> of<00:02:58.850> the<00:02:58.940> air

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
will filter the particles out of the air

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.559 
will filter the particles out of the air
but<00:02:59.840> then<00:03:00.340> no<00:03:01.340> carburetor<00:03:01.819> at<00:03:02.120> all<00:03:02.209> so<00:03:02.540> the

00:03:02.559 --> 00:03:02.569 
but then no carburetor at all so the

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:05.860 
but then no carburetor at all so the
fresh<00:03:03.049> air<00:03:03.350> can<00:03:03.530> go<00:03:03.680> in<00:03:04.000> and<00:03:05.000> an<00:03:05.209> injector

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
fresh air can go in and an injector

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.340 
fresh air can go in and an injector
which<00:03:06.620> is<00:03:07.100> fed<00:03:07.489> by<00:03:07.730> an<00:03:07.880> injector<00:03:08.390> pump<00:03:08.660> which

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.350 
which is fed by an injector pump which

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:11.559 
which is fed by an injector pump which
puts<00:03:09.650> that<00:03:09.890> fuel<00:03:10.459> at<00:03:10.700> a<00:03:10.760> very<00:03:11.000> high<00:03:11.060> pressure

00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:11.569 
puts that fuel at a very high pressure

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:14.380 
puts that fuel at a very high pressure
and<00:03:11.900> forces<00:03:12.440> it<00:03:12.470> in<00:03:12.799> through<00:03:13.670> the<00:03:13.850> injector

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
and forces it in through the injector

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:17.229 
and forces it in through the injector
into<00:03:14.810> the<00:03:14.959> cylinder<00:03:15.410> but<00:03:16.040> again<00:03:16.609> has<00:03:16.970> the

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:17.239 
into the cylinder but again has the

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:19.750 
into the cylinder but again has the
piston<00:03:18.079> the<00:03:18.230> connecting<00:03:18.739> rod<00:03:18.920> and<00:03:19.220> the

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
piston the connecting rod and the

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.949 
piston the connecting rod and the
crankshaft<00:03:20.329> all<00:03:20.780> inside<00:03:21.230> the<00:03:21.700> silliman<00:03:22.959> so

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:23.959 
crankshaft all inside the silliman so

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:26.530 
crankshaft all inside the silliman so
now<00:03:24.140> i<00:03:24.170> will<00:03:24.560> show<00:03:24.590> you<00:03:24.829> those<00:03:25.160> parts<00:03:25.640> on

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
now i will show you those parts on

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:32.770 
now i will show you those parts on
actual<00:03:27.109> engines<00:03:30.940> okay<00:03:31.940> first<00:03:32.299> I'm<00:03:32.570> going<00:03:32.630> to

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
actual engines okay first I'm going to

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.220 
actual engines okay first I'm going to
show<00:03:32.989> you<00:03:33.049> the<00:03:33.859> gasoline<00:03:34.640> engine<00:03:35.180> parts<00:03:35.989> and

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
show you the gasoline engine parts and

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.060 
show you the gasoline engine parts and
this<00:03:36.950> is<00:03:37.070> a<00:03:37.150> 1929<00:03:38.150> Ford<00:03:38.510> Model<00:03:38.870> A<00:03:38.989> which<00:03:39.769> has

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:40.070 
this is a 1929 Ford Model A which has

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:43.000 
this is a 1929 Ford Model A which has
one<00:03:40.489> of<00:03:40.640> the<00:03:40.760> simplest<00:03:41.530> gasoline<00:03:42.530> engines

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 
one of the simplest gasoline engines

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:47.039 
one of the simplest gasoline engines
available<00:03:43.900> so<00:03:44.900> it<00:03:44.959> should<00:03:45.290> be<00:03:45.470> a<00:03:45.500> good<00:03:45.829> one<00:03:46.100> for

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:47.049 
available so it should be a good one for

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:52.599 
available so it should be a good one for
demonstration<00:03:49.390> there's<00:03:50.390> a<00:03:50.510> carburetor<00:03:51.609> down

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:52.609 
demonstration there's a carburetor down

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:55.770 
demonstration there's a carburetor down
there<00:03:53.019> the<00:03:54.019> tanks<00:03:54.440> air<00:03:54.650> through<00:03:55.190> that<00:03:55.430> filter

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
there the tanks air through that filter

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:59.830 
there the tanks air through that filter
and<00:03:56.780> then<00:03:57.040> into<00:03:58.040> up<00:03:58.700> through<00:03:59.299> there<00:03:59.480> it's<00:03:59.630> kind

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
and then into up through there it's kind

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.640 
and then into up through there it's kind
of<00:03:59.870> hard<00:04:00.079> to<00:04:00.140> see<00:04:00.940> up<00:04:01.940> through<00:04:02.299> there<00:04:02.600> and<00:04:03.380> it

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650 
of hard to see up through there and it

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:06.460 
of hard to see up through there and it
mixes<00:04:04.040> fuel<00:04:04.459> fuel<00:04:05.390> goes<00:04:05.569> in<00:04:05.810> right<00:04:05.989> there<00:04:06.260> and

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470 
mixes fuel fuel goes in right there and

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:09.849 
mixes fuel fuel goes in right there and
it<00:04:06.560> mixes<00:04:07.069> inside<00:04:07.579> of<00:04:07.760> there<00:04:07.910> and<00:04:08.120> then<00:04:08.989> comes

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:09.859 
it mixes inside of there and then comes

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:12.670 
it mixes inside of there and then comes
up<00:04:10.130> through<00:04:10.910> there<00:04:11.299> and<00:04:12.079> under<00:04:12.380> the<00:04:12.530> engine

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680 
up through there and under the engine

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.870 
up through there and under the engine
and<00:04:13.130> the<00:04:13.190> valves<00:04:13.910> are<00:04:14.150> in<00:04:14.389> there

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
and the valves are in there

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:18.380 
and the valves are in there
inside<00:04:15.920> the<00:04:16.920> cylinder<00:04:17.160> which<00:04:17.700> is<00:04:17.880> covered<00:04:18.239> by

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:18.390 
inside the cylinder which is covered by

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:22.700 
inside the cylinder which is covered by
this<00:04:18.450> cylinder<00:04:19.410> head<00:04:19.590> right<00:04:19.830> here<00:04:20.040> and<00:04:21.710> so

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
this cylinder head right here and so

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:24.950 
this cylinder head right here and so
that's<00:04:23.040> the<00:04:23.370> carburetor<00:04:23.940> and<00:04:24.240> then<00:04:24.570> there's

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
that's the carburetor and then there's

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.400 
that's the carburetor and then there's
the<00:04:25.260> spark<00:04:25.860> plugs<00:04:26.420> which<00:04:27.420> stick<00:04:27.840> down<00:04:28.050> into

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:28.410 
the spark plugs which stick down into

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:29.900 
the spark plugs which stick down into
each<00:04:28.530> of<00:04:28.680> the<00:04:28.800> cylinders<00:04:29.310> there's<00:04:29.550> four

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:29.910 
each of the cylinders there's four

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:32.480 
each of the cylinders there's four
cylinders<00:04:30.450> and<00:04:30.690> then<00:04:31.230> this<00:04:31.410> is<00:04:31.470> a<00:04:31.650> distributor

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 
cylinders and then this is a distributor

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.570 
cylinders and then this is a distributor
which<00:04:33.300> sends<00:04:33.870> the<00:04:33.930> spark<00:04:34.440> at<00:04:34.770> exactly<00:04:35.370> the

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580 
which sends the spark at exactly the

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.920 
which sends the spark at exactly the
right<00:04:35.760> times<00:04:36.150> through<00:04:37.110> those<00:04:37.410> wires<00:04:38.750> into<00:04:39.750> the

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
right times through those wires into the

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.680 
right times through those wires into the
spark<00:04:40.350> plug<00:04:40.590> which<00:04:41.340> then<00:04:41.640> sends<00:04:41.940> spark<00:04:42.390> into

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
spark plug which then sends spark into

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:46.190 
spark plug which then sends spark into
the<00:04:42.810> cylinder<00:04:43.320> as<00:04:43.560> it<00:04:43.800> is<00:04:43.950> needed<00:04:44.340> and<00:04:45.200> then

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:46.200 
the cylinder as it is needed and then

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.140 
the cylinder as it is needed and then
the<00:04:46.410> exhaust<00:04:46.770> valves<00:04:47.220> are<00:04:47.340> in<00:04:47.460> there<00:04:47.640> and<00:04:47.940> then

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:48.150 
the exhaust valves are in there and then

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:51.340 
the exhaust valves are in there and then
it<00:04:48.300> comes<00:04:48.450> out<00:04:48.750> through<00:04:49.110> this<00:04:49.260> header<00:04:49.590> and<00:04:50.460> out

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:51.350 
it comes out through this header and out

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:55.610 
it comes out through this header and out
and<00:04:52.350> so<00:04:52.830> it<00:04:53.250> that's<00:04:53.730> pretty<00:04:54.060> much<00:04:54.630> the<00:04:54.690> basic

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:55.620 
and so it that's pretty much the basic

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:58.520 
and so it that's pretty much the basic
design<00:04:55.830> there's<00:04:56.550> not<00:04:56.820> a<00:04:56.850> whole<00:04:57.090> lot<00:04:57.150> to<00:04:57.600> it<00:04:57.750> of

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:58.530 
design there's not a whole lot to it of

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:00.380 
design there's not a whole lot to it of
course<00:04:58.800> you<00:04:58.980> can't<00:04:59.220> see<00:04:59.490> the<00:04:59.640> Pistons<00:05:00.180> and

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:00.390 
course you can't see the Pistons and

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:03.230 
course you can't see the Pistons and
stuff<00:05:00.690> her<00:05:00.870> inside<00:05:01.380> of<00:05:01.590> there<00:05:01.740> so<00:05:02.610> but<00:05:02.850> from

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:03.240 
stuff her inside of there so but from

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:04.760 
stuff her inside of there so but from
what<00:05:03.390> you<00:05:03.540> can<00:05:03.660> see<00:05:03.870> out<00:05:03.990> there<00:05:04.200> is<00:05:04.410> the<00:05:04.590> air

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:04.770 
what you can see out there is the air

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:07.550 
what you can see out there is the air
filter<00:05:05.340> and<00:05:05.580> the<00:05:06.120> carburetor<00:05:06.720> and<00:05:06.990> the<00:05:07.170> intake

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.560 
filter and the carburetor and the intake

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:11.030 
filter and the carburetor and the intake
manifold<00:05:08.190> and<00:05:08.400> then<00:05:09.090> the<00:05:09.270> distributor<00:05:10.230> with

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:11.040 
manifold and then the distributor with

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:15.230 
manifold and then the distributor with
the<00:05:11.190> spark<00:05:11.520> plugs<00:05:11.850> and<00:05:12.300> the<00:05:12.540> plug<00:05:12.750> wires<00:05:14.240> now

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:15.240 
the spark plugs and the plug wires now

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:16.970 
the spark plugs and the plug wires now
i'm<00:05:15.390> going<00:05:15.510> to<00:05:15.630> show<00:05:15.780> you<00:05:15.810> the<00:05:16.110> diesel<00:05:16.590> engine

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:16.980 
i'm going to show you the diesel engine

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:21.080 
i'm going to show you the diesel engine
this<00:05:17.580> is<00:05:17.820> a<00:05:18.140> 1956<00:05:19.140> Mack<00:05:19.470> be<00:05:19.800> model<00:05:20.280> so<00:05:20.790> it<00:05:20.910> has

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:21.090 
this is a 1956 Mack be model so it has

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:22.940 
this is a 1956 Mack be model so it has
one<00:05:21.420> of<00:05:21.510> the<00:05:21.630> plaintiffs<00:05:22.020> than<00:05:22.440> simple<00:05:22.830> as

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:22.950 
one of the plaintiffs than simple as

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:26.270 
one of the plaintiffs than simple as
diesel<00:05:23.460> engines<00:05:23.880> available<00:05:24.740> also<00:05:25.740> good<00:05:26.010> for

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:26.280 
diesel engines available also good for

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:29.180 
diesel engines available also good for
demonstration<00:05:27.060> as<00:05:27.960> you<00:05:28.260> can<00:05:28.380> see<00:05:28.680> this<00:05:28.920> is<00:05:29.160> the

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:29.190 
demonstration as you can see this is the

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:32.120 
demonstration as you can see this is the
intake<00:05:29.790> manifold<00:05:30.450> right<00:05:30.690> here<00:05:30.990> and<00:05:31.410> hair<00:05:31.800> goes

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:32.130 
intake manifold right here and hair goes

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:35.060 
intake manifold right here and hair goes
in<00:05:32.490> there<00:05:32.820> but<00:05:33.570> notice<00:05:33.960> the<00:05:34.170> lack<00:05:34.380> of<00:05:34.410> a

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:35.070 
in there but notice the lack of a

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:38.090 
in there but notice the lack of a
carburetor<00:05:36.000> the<00:05:36.570> air<00:05:36.690> just<00:05:36.960> goes<00:05:37.230> straight<00:05:37.740> in

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:38.100 
carburetor the air just goes straight in

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:42.170 
carburetor the air just goes straight in
through<00:05:38.340> there<00:05:38.580> and<00:05:39.800> you<00:05:40.800> can<00:05:40.920> almost<00:05:41.070> see<00:05:41.460> one

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:42.180 
through there and you can almost see one

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:44.210 
through there and you can almost see one
of<00:05:42.300> the<00:05:42.450> ports<00:05:42.840> where<00:05:43.020> it<00:05:43.140> goes<00:05:43.260> in<00:05:43.590> through

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:44.220 
of the ports where it goes in through

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:46.370 
of the ports where it goes in through
the<00:05:44.400> valve<00:05:44.640> and<00:05:44.970> into<00:05:45.030> the<00:05:45.300> cylinder<00:05:45.750> which

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:46.380 
the valve and into the cylinder which

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:48.590 
the valve and into the cylinder which
this<00:05:46.620> is<00:05:46.770> a<00:05:46.800> six<00:05:47.280> cylinder<00:05:47.550> engine<00:05:47.760> so<00:05:48.390> there's

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:48.600 
this is a six cylinder engine so there's

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:53.120 
this is a six cylinder engine so there's
six<00:05:49.470> Pistons<00:05:50.040> inside<00:05:51.000> of<00:05:51.210> there<00:05:51.390> and<00:05:51.890> then<00:05:52.890> on

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:53.130 
six Pistons inside of there and then on

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:56.450 
six Pistons inside of there and then on
this<00:05:53.370> side<00:05:54.440> you<00:05:55.440> can<00:05:55.620> see<00:05:55.650> the<00:05:56.040> exhaust

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:56.460 
this side you can see the exhaust

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:59.290 
this side you can see the exhaust
manifold<00:05:57.180> where<00:05:57.930> the<00:05:58.050> exhaust<00:05:58.530> comes<00:05:58.920> out

00:05:59.290 --> 00:05:59.300 
manifold where the exhaust comes out

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:02.990 
manifold where the exhaust comes out
through<00:06:00.300> the<00:06:00.450> exhaust<00:06:00.780> valves<00:06:01.410> and<00:06:01.620> then<00:06:02.000> out

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:03.000 
through the exhaust valves and then out

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.570 
through the exhaust valves and then out
through<00:06:03.060> there<00:06:03.660> and<00:06:03.900> down<00:06:04.620> and<00:06:04.980> out<00:06:05.400> of<00:06:05.430> the

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:05.580 
through there and down and out of the

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:09.260 
through there and down and out of the
truck<00:06:05.910> and<00:06:06.900> then<00:06:07.140> that<00:06:07.440> is<00:06:08.250> the<00:06:08.520> injector<00:06:09.030> pump

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:09.270 
truck and then that is the injector pump

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:12.200 
truck and then that is the injector pump
now<00:06:09.900> much<00:06:10.140> like<00:06:10.380> the<00:06:10.530> distributor<00:06:11.190> it<00:06:11.550> has<00:06:11.730> six

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:12.210 
now much like the distributor it has six

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:16.130 
now much like the distributor it has six
different<00:06:12.690> places<00:06:12.990> on<00:06:13.380> there<00:06:13.620> so<00:06:14.610> the<00:06:15.150> six

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:16.140 
different places on there so the six

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:18.110 
different places on there so the six
different<00:06:16.560> fuel<00:06:16.800> lines<00:06:17.070> go<00:06:17.370> to<00:06:17.430> six<00:06:17.910> different

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:18.120 
different fuel lines go to six different

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:22.310 
different fuel lines go to six different
injectors<00:06:19.020> up<00:06:19.860> there<00:06:20.370> which<00:06:21.180> those<00:06:21.510> and<00:06:21.960> fuel

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:22.320 
injectors up there which those and fuel

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:25.730 
injectors up there which those and fuel
into<00:06:23.190> the<00:06:23.220> cylinders<00:06:23.340> as<00:06:24.060> needed

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:25.740 
into the cylinders as needed

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:27.620 
into the cylinders as needed
and<00:06:25.860> the<00:06:25.979> injector<00:06:26.460> pump<00:06:26.699> takes<00:06:27.000> fuel<00:06:27.360> in

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:27.630 
and the injector pump takes fuel in

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:31.550 
and the injector pump takes fuel in
through<00:06:28.470> right<00:06:28.770> there<00:06:29.069> and<00:06:30.199> into<00:06:31.199> that<00:06:31.349> little

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:31.560 
through right there and into that little

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:33.559 
through right there and into that little
pump<00:06:31.949> which<00:06:32.190> sends<00:06:32.220> it<00:06:32.669> into<00:06:32.819> the<00:06:33.030> injector

00:06:33.559 --> 00:06:33.569 
pump which sends it into the injector

00:06:33.569 --> 00:06:37.070 
pump which sends it into the injector
pump<00:06:33.860> which<00:06:34.860> then<00:06:35.389> sends<00:06:36.389> fuel<00:06:36.810> to<00:06:36.960> the

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:37.080 
pump which then sends fuel to the

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:40.129 
pump which then sends fuel to the
different<00:06:37.580> fuel<00:06:38.580> lines<00:06:38.849> the<00:06:39.270> injectors<00:06:39.870> at

00:06:40.129 --> 00:06:40.139 
different fuel lines the injectors at

00:06:40.139 --> 00:06:42.529 
different fuel lines the injectors at
the<00:06:40.620> right<00:06:40.830> time<00:06:41.130> and<00:06:41.490> then<00:06:42.090> there's<00:06:42.360> the

00:06:42.529 --> 00:06:42.539 
the right time and then there's the

00:06:42.539 --> 00:06:45.110 
the right time and then there's the
governor<00:06:42.960> on<00:06:43.169> the<00:06:43.319> back<00:06:43.530> which<00:06:44.280> is<00:06:44.849> the

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:45.120 
governor on the back which is the

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:49.129 
governor on the back which is the
throttle<00:06:45.690> control<00:06:46.620> and<00:06:46.949> also<00:06:47.789> the<00:06:48.139> shutdown

00:06:49.129 --> 00:06:49.139 
throttle control and also the shutdown

00:06:49.139 --> 00:06:52.010 
throttle control and also the shutdown
and<00:06:49.470> it<00:06:50.250> keeps<00:06:50.550> it<00:06:50.789> from<00:06:51.030> over<00:06:51.569> revving<00:06:51.900> the

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:52.020 
and it keeps it from over revving the

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:55.850 
and it keeps it from over revving the
engine<00:06:52.410> and<00:06:54.050> so<00:06:55.050> that's<00:06:55.229> pretty<00:06:55.590> much<00:06:55.680> the

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:55.860 
engine and so that's pretty much the

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:59.210 
engine and so that's pretty much the
basic<00:06:56.160> parts<00:06:56.610> of<00:06:56.940> a<00:06:57.030> diesel<00:06:57.240> engine<00:06:57.840> and<00:06:58.220> of

00:06:59.210 --> 00:06:59.220 
basic parts of a diesel engine and of

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:01.820 
basic parts of a diesel engine and of
course<00:06:59.490> you<00:06:59.610> can<00:06:59.849> see<00:07:00.210> the<00:07:00.509> cylinders<00:07:01.470> with

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:01.830 
course you can see the cylinders with

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:05.749 
course you can see the cylinders with
the<00:07:01.949> Pistons<00:07:02.430> in<00:07:02.639> them<00:07:02.819> are<00:07:03.389> inside<00:07:03.870> there<00:07:04.759> but

00:07:05.749 --> 00:07:05.759 
the Pistons in them are inside there but

00:07:05.759 --> 00:07:09.350 
the Pistons in them are inside there but
yeah<00:07:06.509> that's<00:07:06.720> the<00:07:07.050> basic<00:07:07.740> parts<00:07:08.130> of<00:07:08.940> a<00:07:09.150> diesel

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:09.360 
yeah that's the basic parts of a diesel

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:16.399 
yeah that's the basic parts of a diesel
engine<00:07:13.610> okay<00:07:14.610> so<00:07:14.669> now<00:07:15.509> you<00:07:15.569> have<00:07:15.840> seen<00:07:16.229> the

00:07:16.399 --> 00:07:16.409 
engine okay so now you have seen the

00:07:16.409 --> 00:07:18.770 
engine okay so now you have seen the
basic<00:07:16.800> parts<00:07:17.039> of<00:07:17.490> both<00:07:17.669> the<00:07:17.909> gasoline<00:07:18.509> and

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:18.780 
basic parts of both the gasoline and

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:22.719 
basic parts of both the gasoline and
diesel<00:07:19.110> engine<00:07:19.710> and<00:07:19.940> as<00:07:20.940> well<00:07:21.240> as<00:07:21.599> how<00:07:22.050> the

00:07:22.719 --> 00:07:22.729 
diesel engine and as well as how the

00:07:22.729 --> 00:07:25.999 
diesel engine and as well as how the
cycles<00:07:23.729> are<00:07:24.030> different<00:07:24.659> of<00:07:25.050> the<00:07:25.409> diesel<00:07:25.860> and

00:07:25.999 --> 00:07:26.009 
cycles are different of the diesel and

00:07:26.009 --> 00:07:28.969 
cycles are different of the diesel and
gas<00:07:26.190> engines<00:07:26.759> and<00:07:27.150> just<00:07:27.509> as<00:07:27.690> a<00:07:27.720> review<00:07:28.020> on<00:07:28.919> a

00:07:28.969 --> 00:07:28.979 
gas engines and just as a review on a

00:07:28.979 --> 00:07:32.659 
gas engines and just as a review on a
gasoline<00:07:29.669> engine<00:07:30.199> the<00:07:31.639> air-fuel<00:07:32.639> mixture

00:07:32.659 --> 00:07:32.669 
gasoline engine the air-fuel mixture

00:07:32.669 --> 00:07:37.070 
gasoline engine the air-fuel mixture
goes<00:07:33.419> in<00:07:33.690> is<00:07:33.930> drawn<00:07:34.620> in<00:07:35.210> compressed<00:07:36.210> then

00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:37.080 
goes in is drawn in compressed then

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:40.070 
goes in is drawn in compressed then
ignited<00:07:37.560> by<00:07:37.710> a<00:07:37.830> spark<00:07:38.280> plug<00:07:38.479> and<00:07:39.479> then<00:07:39.690> is

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:40.080 
ignited by a spark plug and then is

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:43.760 
ignited by a spark plug and then is
expelled<00:07:41.070> via<00:07:41.610> the<00:07:41.820> exhaust<00:07:42.210> valves<00:07:42.780> and<00:07:42.990> then

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:43.770 
expelled via the exhaust valves and then

00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:46.700 
expelled via the exhaust valves and then
a<00:07:43.800> diesel<00:07:44.310> engine<00:07:44.400> fresh<00:07:45.330> clean<00:07:45.750> air<00:07:45.780> is<00:07:46.380> drawn

00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:46.710 
a diesel engine fresh clean air is drawn

00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:50.089 
a diesel engine fresh clean air is drawn
in<00:07:47.009> compressed<00:07:47.969> then<00:07:48.630> fuel<00:07:49.080> is<00:07:49.229> injected<00:07:49.440> at<00:07:50.070> a

00:07:50.089 --> 00:07:50.099 
in compressed then fuel is injected at a

00:07:50.099 --> 00:07:53.180 
in compressed then fuel is injected at a
high<00:07:50.310> pressure<00:07:50.699> and<00:07:51.090> it<00:07:51.270> explodes<00:07:51.780> and<00:07:52.190> then

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:53.190 
high pressure and it explodes and then

00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:56.120 
high pressure and it explodes and then
the<00:07:53.969> air<00:07:54.180> is<00:07:54.449> exhausted<00:07:55.380> through<00:07:55.680> the<00:07:55.830> exhaust

00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:56.130 
the air is exhausted through the exhaust

00:07:56.130 --> 00:08:00.140 
the air is exhausted through the exhaust
valves<00:07:56.780> and<00:07:57.780> so<00:07:58.259> that<00:07:58.680> is<00:07:59.009> the<00:07:59.550> main

00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:00.150 
valves and so that is the main

00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:02.450 
valves and so that is the main
difference<00:08:00.180> between<00:08:01.169> a<00:08:01.440> gasoline<00:08:02.130> and<00:08:02.340> the

00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:02.460 
difference between a gasoline and the

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:03.920 
difference between a gasoline and the
diesel<00:08:02.849> engine<00:08:03.180> I<00:08:03.300> hope<00:08:03.509> this<00:08:03.690> presentation

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:03.930 
diesel engine I hope this presentation
