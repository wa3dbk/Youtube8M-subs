oven like I'm not going to take that to

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.229 
oven like I'm not going to take that to
my<00:00:58.050> new<00:00:58.199> house<00:00:58.410> in<00:00:58.680> some<00:00:59.280> cases<00:00:59.730> some<00:01:00.000> people

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
my new house in some cases some people

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.510 
my new house in some cases some people
might<00:01:00.510> do<00:01:00.690> that<00:01:00.870> so<00:01:01.230> if<00:01:01.440> that's<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.070> case<00:01:02.280> you

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
might do that so if that's the case you

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:03.920 
might do that so if that's the case you
wouldn't<00:01:02.699> keep<00:01:02.969> that<00:01:03.120> stuff<00:01:03.359> inside<00:01:03.750> this

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
wouldn't keep that stuff inside this

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.260 
wouldn't keep that stuff inside this
binder<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.680> other<00:01:05.250> reason<00:01:05.610> why<00:01:05.760> I<00:01:05.790> have<00:01:06.060> two

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
binder the other reason why I have two

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.820 
binder the other reason why I have two
binders<00:01:06.570> is<00:01:06.780> because<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.260> binders<00:01:07.619> are

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
binders is because the binders are

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.330 
binders is because the binders are
pretty<00:01:08.189> thick<00:01:08.640> like<00:01:09.119> that<00:01:09.330> one<00:01:09.990> is<00:01:10.140> a<00:01:10.280> can<00:01:11.280> you

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
pretty thick like that one is a can you

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.830 
pretty thick like that one is a can you
see<00:01:11.490> that<00:01:11.640> one<00:01:11.790> is<00:01:11.909> a<00:01:11.970> 3<00:01:12.180> inch<00:01:12.299> binder<00:01:12.600> and<00:01:12.720> that

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
see that one is a 3 inch binder and that

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.450 
see that one is a 3 inch binder and that
one<00:01:12.960> is<00:01:13.049> a<00:01:13.080> 2<00:01:13.290> inch<00:01:13.439> binder<00:01:13.770> so<00:01:14.100> I<00:01:14.130> didn't<00:01:14.310> want

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
one is a 2 inch binder so I didn't want

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.219 
one is a 2 inch binder so I didn't want
to<00:01:14.520> have<00:01:14.640> like<00:01:14.850> one<00:01:15.119> really<00:01:15.540> thick<00:01:15.840> binder

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
to have like one really thick binder

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.929 
to have like one really thick binder
that<00:01:16.439> was<00:01:16.530> overflowing<00:01:17.250> I<00:01:17.369> wanted<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:17.729> break

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
that was overflowing I wanted to break

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.359 
that was overflowing I wanted to break
it<00:01:18.090> down<00:01:18.119> into<00:01:18.360> two<00:01:18.479> categories<00:01:18.840> so<00:01:19.710> so<00:01:20.250> again

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
it down into two categories so so again

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.330 
it down into two categories so so again
this<00:01:20.670> is<00:01:20.850> stuff<00:01:21.090> that<00:01:21.150> that<00:01:22.140> stays<00:01:22.979> in<00:01:23.220> the

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
this is stuff that that stays in the

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.070 
this is stuff that that stays in the
house<00:01:23.549> when<00:01:24.000> I<00:01:24.030> move<00:01:24.299> to<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.509> new<00:01:24.630> house<00:01:24.840> and

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
house when I move to the new house and

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:09.840 
case this is the best buy warranty so I

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.210 
case this is the best buy warranty so I
just<00:05:10.020> took<00:05:10.140> the<00:05:10.200> receipt<00:05:10.500> stapled<00:05:10.950> it<00:05:11.070> and

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:11.220 
just took the receipt stapled it and

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:13.610 
just took the receipt stapled it and
then<00:05:11.610> I<00:05:11.640> put<00:05:11.910> it<00:05:12.000> inside<00:05:12.150> of<00:05:12.390> my<00:05:12.870> gadget<00:05:13.290> folder

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:13.620 
then I put it inside of my gadget folder

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:16.790 
then I put it inside of my gadget folder
so<00:05:14.420> if<00:05:15.420> there<00:05:15.780> is<00:05:15.870> some<00:05:16.050> problem<00:05:16.200> down<00:05:16.650> the

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 
so if there is some problem down the

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.800 
so if there is some problem down the
road<00:05:16.830> since<00:05:17.520> it<00:05:17.670> was<00:05:17.790> an<00:05:17.910> expensive<00:05:18.510> purchase

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:18.810 
road since it was an expensive purchase

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:20.420 
road since it was an expensive purchase
I<00:05:19.260> would<00:05:19.290> just<00:05:19.500> come<00:05:19.710> back<00:05:19.830> to<00:05:19.980> this<00:05:20.070> folder

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:20.430 
I would just come back to this folder

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:22.700 
I would just come back to this folder
and<00:05:20.610> easily<00:05:21.270> find<00:05:21.450> exactly<00:05:22.140> what<00:05:22.320> I'm<00:05:22.440> looking

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:22.710 
and easily find exactly what I'm looking

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:23.780 
and easily find exactly what I'm looking
for

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:23.790 
for

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:26.030 
for
so<00:05:24.390> it's<00:05:24.570> the<00:05:24.660> same<00:05:24.840> thing<00:05:25.140> with<00:05:25.440> other<00:05:25.680> things

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:26.040 
so it's the same thing with other things

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:29.690 
so it's the same thing with other things
in<00:05:26.280> every<00:05:26.490> pocket<00:05:26.700> here<00:05:27.110> and<00:05:28.110> then<00:05:28.700> these

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:29.700 
in every pocket here and then these

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:33.409 
in every pocket here and then these
since<00:05:30.300> these<00:05:30.540> don't<00:05:31.080> have<00:05:31.430> like<00:05:32.430> dividers<00:05:33.150> oh

00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:33.419 
since these don't have like dividers oh

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:36.860 
since these don't have like dividers oh
and<00:05:34.140> also<00:05:34.290> since<00:05:34.680> these<00:05:34.860> are<00:05:35.040> extra<00:05:35.520> wide<00:05:35.870> if

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:36.870 
and also since these are extra wide if

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:38.300 
and also since these are extra wide if
you<00:05:37.020> had<00:05:37.230> a<00:05:37.260> traditional<00:05:37.860> divider

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:38.310 
you had a traditional divider

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:40.700 
you had a traditional divider
it<00:05:38.520> would<00:05:38.700> just<00:05:38.850> be<00:05:39.030> covered<00:05:39.419> by<00:05:39.960> the<00:05:40.350> pocket

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:40.710 
it would just be covered by the pocket

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:42.440 
it would just be covered by the pocket
folder<00:05:40.980> so<00:05:41.430> what<00:05:41.550> I've<00:05:41.669> done<00:05:41.850> here<00:05:42.090> is<00:05:42.150> I've

is<00:06:54.580> how<00:06:54.730> easy<00:06:55.060> they<00:06:55.360> are<00:06:55.389> to<00:06:55.870> turn<00:06:56.230> like<00:06:56.830> there

00:06:57.090 --> 00:06:57.100 
is how easy they are to turn like there

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:59.430 
is how easy they are to turn like there
is<00:06:57.250> probably<00:06:57.610> about<00:06:57.760> maybe<00:06:58.510> like<00:06:58.720> 15<00:06:59.229> pages

00:06:59.430 --> 00:06:59.440
