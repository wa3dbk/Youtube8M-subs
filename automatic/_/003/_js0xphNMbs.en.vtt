00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
win I think the last attack was actually

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.030 
win I think the last attack was actually
pretty<00:00:39.149> solid<00:00:39.660> so<00:00:39.690> let's<00:00:40.500> actually<00:00:40.649> go<00:00:40.950> ahead

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
pretty solid so let's actually go ahead

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.779 
pretty solid so let's actually go ahead
and<00:00:41.160> go<00:00:41.910> to<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.570> my<00:00:42.780> attacks<00:00:43.200> deep<00:00:44.010> attack<00:00:44.489> log

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789

and go to the my attacks deep attack log
and<00:00:45.059> over<00:00:45.570> here<00:00:45.809> you<00:00:46.170> see<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.379> first<00:00:46.710> attack<00:00:47.070> I

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
and over here you see the first attack I

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.029 
and over here you see the first attack I
had<00:00:47.789> nothing<00:00:48.239> boosted<00:00:49.020> up<00:00:49.140> on<00:00:49.379> this<00:00:49.770> first

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
had nothing boosted up on this first

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.920

nothing boosted up either and on the

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.850 
nothing boosted up either and on the
final<00:00:53.969> attack<00:00:54.449> I<00:00:54.660> decided<00:00:55.020> to<00:00:55.260> boost<00:00:55.530> up<00:00:55.800> my

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860

bunch<00:01:25.380> of<00:01:25.500> laser<00:01:25.770> beams<00:01:26.100> in<00:01:26.369> there<00:01:26.580> if<00:01:26.759> you<00:01:27.299> get

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
bunch of laser beams in there if you get

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.899 
bunch of laser beams in there if you get
your<00:01:27.540> warriors<00:01:28.110> exposed<00:01:28.740> for<00:01:29.100> even<00:01:29.490> a<00:01:29.579> split

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
your warriors exposed for even a split

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.390 
your warriors exposed for even a split
second<00:01:30.390> you<00:01:30.960> end<00:01:31.259> up<00:01:31.439> getting<00:01:31.590> terminated

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
second you end up getting terminated

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.590 
second you end up getting terminated
especially<00:01:32.850> in<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:33.000> middle<00:01:33.270> of<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.360> base

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
especially in the middle of the base

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.630 
especially in the middle of the base
take<00:01:33.900> a<00:01:33.930> look<00:01:34.140> at<00:01:34.229> that<00:01:34.380> you<00:01:34.979> should<00:01:35.189> drop<00:01:35.460> the

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
take a look at that you should drop the

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.450 
take a look at that you should drop the
smokes<00:01:36.030> first<00:01:36.570> and<00:01:36.930> then<00:01:37.500> make<00:01:37.740> your<00:01:37.950> way<00:01:38.009> up

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
smokes first and then make your way up

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.999 
smokes first and then make your way up

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
way up to the headquarters but it really

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.730 
way up to the headquarters but it really
didn't<00:01:54.479> matter<00:01:54.600> that<00:01:54.810> much<00:01:55.079> anymore<00:01:55.409> because

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
didn't matter that much anymore because

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.649 
didn't matter that much anymore because
I<00:01:56.009> couldn't<00:01:56.340> do<00:01:56.430> anything<00:01:56.460> in<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.149> first

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
I couldn't do anything in the first

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.410 
I couldn't do anything in the first
attack<00:01:58.049> I<00:01:58.259> basically<00:01:58.829> got<00:01:59.100> wiped<00:01:59.399> out<00:01:59.579> I<00:01:59.969> did

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
attack I basically got wiped out I did

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.420 
attack I basically got wiped out I did
about<00:02:00.600> I<00:02:00.780> don't<00:02:01.049> know<00:02:01.290> five<00:02:01.860> percent<00:02:02.310> of

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
about I don't know five percent of

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.999 
about I don't know five percent of
damage<00:02:02.850> on<00:02:03.060> this<00:02:03.210> very<00:02:03.420> first<00:02:03.810> attack<00:02:04.320> now

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
damage on this very first attack now

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.530 
damage on this very first attack now
that<00:02:05.280> puts<00:02:05.430> you<00:02:05.610> in<00:02:05.640> a<00:02:05.790> bad<00:02:05.969> position<00:02:06.000> because

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
that puts you in a bad position because

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.660 
that puts you in a bad position because
you<00:02:06.899> serve<00:02:07.140> to<00:02:07.170> take<00:02:07.530> down<00:02:07.740> the<00:02:07.979> base<00:02:08.190> with<00:02:08.520> two

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
you serve to take down the base with two

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.729 
you serve to take down the base with two
attacks<00:02:09.060> let's<00:02:09.780> see<00:02:09.929> how<00:02:10.020> well<00:02:10.229> we<00:02:10.349> did<00:02:10.470> on<00:02:10.649> the

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
attacks let's see how well we did on the

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.000 
attacks let's see how well we did on the
last<00:02:10.770> two<00:02:11.129> attacks<00:02:11.459> the<00:02:11.640> second<00:02:12.030> attack

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
last two attacks the second attack

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.390 
last two attacks the second attack
color<00:02:13.390> reshaped<00:02:14.390> my<00:02:14.750> strategy<00:02:15.409> decided<00:02:16.220> to

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
color reshaped my strategy decided to

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.399 
color reshaped my strategy decided to
actually<00:02:16.700> take<00:02:17.060> a<00:02:17.090> little<00:02:17.299> bit<00:02:17.480> safe<00:02:17.780> so<00:02:18.349> I'm

00:02:18.399 --> 00:02:18.409 
actually take a little bit safe so I'm

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:20.380 
actually take a little bit safe so I'm
dropping<00:02:18.890> the<00:02:18.980> smoke<00:02:19.250> first<00:02:19.519> and<00:02:19.879> then

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
dropping the smoke first and then

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.059 
dropping the smoke first and then
dropping<00:02:20.689> the<00:02:20.900> sack<00:02:21.110> of<00:02:21.230> smoke<00:02:21.439> as<00:02:21.620> well<00:02:21.650> as

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:22.069 
dropping the sack of smoke as well as

dropping the sack of smoke as well as
you<00:02:22.250> guys<00:02:22.400> can<00:02:22.610> see<00:02:22.670> the<00:02:23.329> way<00:02:23.510> the<00:02:23.720> setup<00:02:24.049> right

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
you guys can see the way the setup right

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.740 
you guys can see the way the setup right
now<00:02:24.470> is<00:02:24.620> perfect<00:02:25.250> they<00:02:25.519> don't<00:02:25.790> get<00:02:25.970> hit<00:02:26.269> at<00:02:26.450> all

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
now is perfect they don't get hit at all

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.360 
now is perfect they don't get hit at all
