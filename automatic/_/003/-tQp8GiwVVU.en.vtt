00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:15.500
 Speak, everybody, it's okay, I'm an animal. 

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:18.779
 class today let's talk about posts 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:21.300
 lipolysis it pocha in this metabolism of 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:24.029
 fats on hormonal influence act 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:27.030
 Good for you, think fat fat. 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.910
 adipose tissue people think again in 

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:32.580
 secondary energy reserve at source 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.160
 secondary energy supply as well as 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:38.220
 energy is just clinical look 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.890
 Portuguese calls sky jealousy 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.960
 also known as triglycerides 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.199
 intimate people can also call detail 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:49.170
 then tab means creating good glycerol 

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:51.659
 we have to remember about the last one to 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.960
 we have seen all the metabolism in the state 

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:56.970
 well fed in a fasting statute 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.580
 how well we are fed 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:01.049
 influence of our body the style of 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:03.180
 carbohydrate feed 

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:05.850
 mainly generates the hormone insulin 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.370
 is a fasting pancreatic hormone 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.870
 the band released will be the cable today 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:11.700
 Let's look at another hormone that 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:14.579
 also relates to the fast that is a 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.090
 hormone called cortisol from the 

00:01:14.579 --> 00:01:18.780
 wide adrenal or supra renal 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.659
 specifically a region called 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:25.049
 cortex is a more globe region 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:27.570
 good to talk about the target again 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.700
 social action is just to look at that 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.159
 stored inside the storage cell 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.560
 inside the tank and it can be 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:38.130
 can be formed or can be 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:41.340
 broken and dosed the name of the reaction of 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:45.179
 training on selection by l geniuses 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:48.390
 that tori by janice genesis of kits 

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:50.869
 inscription clean wind and lipid button 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:54.659
 lipogenesis creation would have been the cerol 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:58.229
 lipolysis means free fall 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:00.600
 hypothesis is the breaking of the tre under heaven 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.460
 it is very important to note that the 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.600
 benefit is on the cerol or late 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.960
 when it is broken 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.259
 it forms a fatty acid and glycerol that 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.409
 also serves 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:13.780
 I knew the error in case the reaction was reversed. 

00:02:11.409 --> 00:02:16.439
 let's think the following in the state well 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:19.810
 fed us will generate colony 

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:22.000
 we have a surplus of 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.060
 carbohydrates people can influence 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.790
 also the process called lipogenesis 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:30.970
 then insulin stimulates lipogenesis or 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:33.250
 whether it is the formation of the tri- 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:37.150
 from its precursors who are the 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:40.060
 cerol or fatty acid and the process 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.950
 reverse on short or long fasting 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.760
 we will also have the action of two hormones 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.440
 on here 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.019
 the action of glucagon which is a mother 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:50.409
 pancreatic cells made to create 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:51.190
 of alpha and cortisol is one year from the above 

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:54.340
 renal 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:55.000
 then his cortex became logical and became 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.180
 ninth 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:01.659
 catabolism in the glycerol segment or 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:03.700
 whether they make a hypothesis and which one 

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:06.549
 be the molecules formed by 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:08.409
 polio from fatty acids that 

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:11.709
 will be referred to the blood and 

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:14.349
 then to the hepatocytes of 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:16.139
 cardiomyocytes shows the 

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:18.639
 tiny skeletal state 

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:22.540
 cardiomyocyte to cardiac muscle cell 

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:24.760
 and citizens in all these cells 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:27.129
 serves as the source of atp 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.410
 What is your glycerol fate then? 

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:30.699
 optional as well as of Brazil also 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.769
 each bloodstream 

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:35.230
 it will be forwarded to the epam 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:37.209
 cough that the liver cells and this 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.400
 cell and will undergo a process that 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:42.310
 You know in the last class process 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:45.280
 called beak neo generate or start 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:46.120
 oh, it's going to be used is duck to make new 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.250
 virose 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.049
 The most important thing here is to remember the 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:53.109
 following are hormones that 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:55.239
 influence catabolism in the 

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:57.250
 hypothesis of fats and a hormone that 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:58.599
 influence on its synthesis that works 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.299
 tomorrow good 

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:02.169
 the next class on it stretch and maximum 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:04.799
 see you there 

00:04:02.169 --> 00:04:04.799
 a hug
