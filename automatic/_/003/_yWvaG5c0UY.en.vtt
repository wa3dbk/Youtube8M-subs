00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:14.190
 I want that 

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:21.939
 the new oled lamps is 20.15 and sc 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:30.220
 asked online now with xml two leds us 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:32.010
 start with the clock it is 20 she is sorry 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:35.470
 very compact that is already one 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:38.470
 criterion of the lamp or an important one 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:42.160
 outstanding feature of the lamp as you 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:46.150
 really very very compact graf here 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:53.260
 the long for a 18 650 euro thereof 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:56.020
 adapter trend for cr 123 katharina das 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:58.570
 is already the batteries are now 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:04.960
 very very long so it is already tight yes 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:08.350
 but that seems to have got the 3400 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:13.229
 of it extra once 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:17.429
 it tap then hold 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.429
 then she continues 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.260
 Moonlight can be reached by staying in the 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.870
 switched off state in switch 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:32.050
 then presses and holds switches to 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:34.880
 Moonlight is a very nice thing 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:36.280
 otherwise press on it then 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:44.420
 be turned on 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:50.660
 Let's see if to water stores the 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:56.270
 middle or the highest level so 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:57.410
 say moment burning made out now 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.900
 I hope again on the highest 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:00.680
 stage institution over then that shortly 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:04.790
 to save 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:07.130
 that's what makes them last saved 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:10.310
 stage you had already generated a 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:12.080
 very fine thing when she is on and 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:16.190
 You always reach double-click 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:18.620
 stroboscope if you want to turn off and 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.030
 to switch on against accidental 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:25.510
 wants to secure 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:25.510
 then you just packed through 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:32.739
 twice and then she would be fine 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:35.060
 supposedly completely off 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:35.390
 I do not know that now 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:40.070
 Not 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:42.670
 just told me customer is standing at one 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:48.800
 so not in the user manual in it 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:50.390
 I would just screw up here and 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.450
 then the eyes are switched on 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:03:01.480
 But it's on again 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:03:01.480
 and now sleep through and 23 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.470
 no idea 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.819
 no idea how that works is in the 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.860
 Instruction manual should not in it 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:17.269
 somehow go against reconnect 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:19.830
 I would just get ready like that 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:21.450
 the others certainly have those 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:27.840
 same function now we are the times 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:33.440
 Partie sc what we here at the lamp like that 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:33.440
 it's a bit puzzling that she is 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:40.440
 here they would be a magnet at all 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:46.079
 dollar at all lamps magnets in that 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:53.430
 Of course you can take out the clip 

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:55.019
 Of course it will decrease so well that 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:04:00.030
 probably the battery has to be charged 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:04:02.150
 I had already been afraid of it 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.150
 fly 

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:12.420
 press and hold the same function 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:21.610
 and looks at files by clicking twice 

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:27.360
 or when she's off and keeps going 

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:31.800
 moonlight on such a beautiful light 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.800
 which was noticed a bit 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:41.520
 So it's light is very much 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.520
 So thoroughly in what does not like 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:51.930
 not at the s20 but here at the 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:55.960
 next to each other looks right is the s20 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:59.190
 left is the s10 so I think so 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:01.840
 something thoroughly destroyed 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:05.080
 the further trade is against white 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:09.690
 walls lit at the here I have 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:11.790
 the 5 chf 15 are also relative 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:14.650
 bad light 

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:16.840
 Linda bothers keep your fingers off 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:18.550
 but who really uses them outside 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:19.270
 and outside to light the way to 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:22.180
 to shine 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:23.080
 he does not really have a problem either 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:25.240
 actually uninteresting 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:28.330
 Here I have 14 times ago 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:30.760
 It's going to be cleaned too 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:33.250
 Extension ago included the man 2 

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:41.530
 definitely not 214 500 please 

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:43.480
 take but two AA batteries it's 

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:50.770
 just so long and thin but for that 

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:53.620
 his performance as if you only with 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:55.960
 an AAA battery is used however 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:57.729
 honestly before using that long 

00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:05.110
 would 

00:05:57.729 --> 00:06:09.520
 rather the shorter 500 battery and have 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:13.089
 then the full brightness so 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:15.659
 beautiful lamp tomb in moonlight im 

00:06:13.089 --> 00:06:23.939
 switch off state button 

00:06:15.659 --> 00:06:29.099
 that's a fine thing yes there it is 

00:06:23.939 --> 00:06:30.849
 with the update to the l2 with security 

00:06:29.099 --> 00:06:32.979
 done done 

00:06:30.849 --> 00:06:35.319
 which was already popular before now 

00:06:32.979 --> 00:06:43.389
 become more popular and until 15 is yes 

00:06:35.319 --> 00:06:45.939
 you will also be completely new to his joy 

00:06:43.389 --> 00:06:48.279
 because you have the same reason 

00:06:45.939 --> 00:06:50.919
 possibility has but there will be 

00:06:48.279 --> 00:06:56.680
 actually this one has always been lined up 

00:06:50.919 --> 00:06:59.620
 supplied also still failing here 

00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:01.360
 Moringer so an analysis and tattoos 

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:04.959
 platelets I think so too 

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:06.669
 all members of the 120 know the 

00:07:04.959 --> 00:07:12.639
 magnets make you power the rhine 

00:07:06.669 --> 00:07:16.649
 as a filler I say so now 

00:07:12.639 --> 00:07:16.649
 altogether a decent little lamp
