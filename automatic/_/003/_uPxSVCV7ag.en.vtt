00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.940
 loris cannata will be for the motogp look 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.620
 i just started a little while ago 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.890
 first tests and I must say that it will be a 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.890
 vintage 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:16.369
 competitive at the most because valentino 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:19.310
 has already declared that it will point to the tenth 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:22.070
 title we saw a jorge lorenzo the 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:24.800
 super fit but the man to beat will be 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.660
 always marc márquez marc márquez young 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.279
 22 years old from a few days and has 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.559
 A lot of hunger Korea has a talent 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:32.239
 incredible in the ducats presented one 

00:00:30.559 --> 00:00:34.430
 so new bike so they too 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:37.730
 will be able to make a small little step in 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:39.350
 forward is to be there to break maybe raised 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.539
 in the basket that will be played 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.210
 important results 

00:00:41.539 --> 00:00:45.949
 and then they are all very close 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:48.319
 return to open motogp and return of 

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:49.819
 suzuki after a few years of stop then 

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:52.909
 it makes this all that much more 

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:54.859
 interesting there is a continuo 

00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:56.960
 development for the second year there 

00:00:54.859 --> 00:00:58.940
 it will really be an important change 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.579
 2016 where i will change a little 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.749
 regulations to make to freeze a 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:05.089
 little development and gives the possibility 

00:01:02.749 --> 00:01:06.170
 to all to approach of valentino 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:08.180
 last year was a coup 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.460
 valentino queue forms last year has 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.200
 made a league never been 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.650
 very good and so this year will start 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.730
 with a different gear with the 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:19.520
 awareness of being able to play a 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:20.900
 championship and from his experience that 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.980
 then the other rains may not have 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.170
 will make the difference 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:25.760
 how much you enjoy yourself in this new role 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.450
 last year he already went to the 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.510
 great 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.310
 but I must say that I enjoy it very much and 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:34.940
 very different from what I did is 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:36.860
 but seeing others really makes me 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:39.140
 account of the difficulties that maybe 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:42.350
 they face and the talent they have then 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:44.660
 I enjoy it and comment me to the agosta 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.220
 Italian nursery as you see it asks you 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:50.260
 any advice 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:53.440
 someone or even not too I have to say that 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:55.120
 fortunately he started working 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.610
 a lot about young people and they are coming 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:01.000
 young Italian drivers with talent 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:03.910
 unfortunately in the years 2006 lost some 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.650
 the samples remained but it is not 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:08.080
 none of the new ones are coming now 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:10.300
 surfacing and this will be positive for 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.100
 a future but not too close or I think 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:14.460
 which will have to pass some more 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:16.690
 years to see great GP motorcycle champions 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:20.770
 classic question the favorite this year 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:23.680
 I motogp crossing my fingers I hope 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:27.180
 valentino but I say that brands slam it 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.180
 it will definitely not be easing
