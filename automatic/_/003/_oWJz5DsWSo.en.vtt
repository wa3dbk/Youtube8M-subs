project that is reducing their total
utility<00:01:00.520> costs<00:01:01.059> but<00:01:01.600> the<00:01:01.840> neat<00:01:02.020> thing<00:01:02.050> about

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:02.230 
utility costs but the neat thing about

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.229 
utility costs but the neat thing about
this<00:01:02.649> is<00:01:02.710> it's<00:01:03.399> doing<00:01:03.730> some<00:01:03.910> other<00:01:04.059> cool

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:04.239 
this is it's doing some other cool

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:08.130 
this is it's doing some other cool
things<00:01:05.160> this<00:01:06.160> is<00:01:06.369> a<00:01:06.399> heat<00:01:06.759> pump<00:01:07.000> and<00:01:07.390> so<00:01:08.110> a

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:08.140 
things this is a heat pump and so a

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.040 
things this is a heat pump and so a
byproduct<00:01:08.740> of<00:01:09.190> this<00:01:09.399> is<00:01:09.670> cool<00:01:10.300> air<00:01:10.509> right<00:01:10.810> it's

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:11.050 
byproduct of this is cool air right it's

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:12.960 
byproduct of this is cool air right it's
cool<00:01:11.320> air<00:01:11.500> so<00:01:11.800> but<00:01:12.070> it's<00:01:12.190> not<00:01:12.250> just<00:01:12.550> cool<00:01:12.700> air

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:12.970 
cool air so but it's not just cool air

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.300 
cool air so but it's not just cool air
it's<00:01:13.320> dehumidified<00:01:14.320> air<00:01:14.350> that<00:01:14.890> is<00:01:15.010> good<00:01:15.220> I

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.310 
it's dehumidified air that is good I

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:16.890 
it's dehumidified air that is good I
have<00:01:15.460> a<00:01:15.490> little<00:01:15.670> drain<00:01:15.970> line<00:01:16.180> back<00:01:16.450> here<00:01:16.479> that

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:16.900 
have a little drain line back here that

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.660 
have a little drain line back here that
drains<00:01:17.229> into<00:01:17.439> the<00:01:17.619> where<00:01:17.920> the<00:01:18.010> washer<00:01:18.369> drains

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
drains into the where the washer drains

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.030 
drains into the where the washer drains
but<00:01:19.180> the<00:01:19.299> neat<00:01:19.450> part<00:01:19.479> of<00:01:19.869> it<00:01:19.990> is<00:01:20.110> is<00:01:20.350> the<00:01:20.830> more

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:21.040 
but the neat part of it is is the more

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.190 
but the neat part of it is is the more
we<00:01:21.159> tighten<00:01:21.640> a<00:01:21.700> home<00:01:21.939> the<00:01:22.540> more<00:01:22.720> we<00:01:22.869> have<00:01:23.049> to

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 
we tighten a home the more we have to

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.929 
we tighten a home the more we have to
mitigate<00:01:23.590> moisture<00:01:24.040> well<00:01:24.220> this<00:01:24.340> helps<00:01:24.520> us<00:01:24.760> do

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:24.939 
mitigate moisture well this helps us do

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:27.330 
mitigate moisture well this helps us do
that<00:01:24.970> but<00:01:25.659> in<00:01:25.780> the<00:01:25.869> meantime<00:01:26.049> is<00:01:26.560> taking<00:01:27.250> the

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
that but in the meantime is taking the

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:28.770 
that but in the meantime is taking the
latent<00:01:27.729> heat<00:01:27.790> out<00:01:28.090> of<00:01:28.119> the<00:01:28.240> house<00:01:28.420> which<00:01:28.750> is

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
and what that's going to do is even

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.840 
and what that's going to do is even
speed<00:03:45.140> up<00:03:45.290> that<00:03:45.440> recovery<00:03:45.890> rate<00:03:46.010> even<00:03:46.280> faster

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
to really get the water nice and hot so

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.410

it calls when the family have used water

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.760 
it calls when the family have used water
and<00:05:13.330> the<00:05:13.450> Geo<00:05:13.720> spring<00:05:13.990> calls<00:05:14.200> for<00:05:14.380> hot<00:05:14.530> water

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:14.770 
and the Geo spring calls for hot water

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:17.190 
and the Geo spring calls for hot water
it<00:05:15.280> still<00:05:15.670> does<00:05:16.000> it<00:05:16.240> in<00:05:16.390> the<00:05:16.750> heat<00:05:16.900> pump

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:17.200 
it still does it in the heat pump

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.440 
it still does it in the heat pump
GeoSpring<00:05:18.190> mode<00:05:18.490> so<00:05:18.910> it's<00:05:19.060> still<00:05:19.270> very

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:19.450 
GeoSpring mode so it's still very

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:21.360

is she used seven kilowatt hours and so

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:30.000
