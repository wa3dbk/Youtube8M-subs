won't<00:01:45.930> take<00:01:46.140> you<00:01:46.170> six<00:01:46.770> seven<00:01:47.100> eight<00:01:47.310> times

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
won't take you six seven eight times

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
and on some maps this equates to nearly

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.740 
and on some maps this equates to nearly
10%<00:01:55.470> and<00:01:55.740> if<00:01:56.250> you're<00:01:56.430> in<00:01:56.549> a<00:01:56.640> group<00:01:56.880> or<00:01:57.030> you<00:01:57.509> can

gorgrond<00:02:22.350> on<00:02:22.590> my<00:02:22.710> hunter<00:02:23.040> I<00:02:23.190> was<00:02:23.640> just<00:02:24.000> into<00:02:24.570> 94

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
gorgrond on my hunter I was just into 94

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.530 
gorgrond on my hunter I was just into 94
then<00:02:26.160> I<00:02:26.190> went<00:02:26.370> back<00:02:26.550> and<00:02:26.730> cleared<00:02:26.970> out<00:02:27.120> all<00:02:27.270> the

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
then I went back and cleared out all the

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.610 
then I went back and cleared out all the
optional<00:02:27.870> objectives<00:02:27.990> and<00:02:28.560> I<00:02:29.310> got<00:02:29.520> to<00:02:29.670> 95<00:02:30.620> it's

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
optional objectives and I got to 95 it's

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.890 
optional objectives and I got to 95 it's
it's<00:02:32.010> kind<00:02:32.310> of<00:02:32.370> ridiculous<00:02:32.730> it<00:02:33.090> really<00:02:33.150> is<00:02:33.600> so

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
it's kind of ridiculous it really is so

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.050 
it's kind of ridiculous it really is so
I<00:02:33.930> would<00:02:34.200> encourage<00:02:34.320> you<00:02:34.560> to<00:02:34.710> maybe<00:02:35.460> even<00:02:35.910> go

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
I would encourage you to maybe even go

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.790 
I would encourage you to maybe even go
out<00:02:36.180> of<00:02:36.210> your<00:02:36.510> way<00:02:36.660> to<00:02:36.960> get<00:02:37.440> these<00:02:37.590> done

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
out of your way to get these done

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.130 
out of your way to get these done
especially<00:02:38.550> if<00:02:38.730> you<00:02:39.180> have<00:02:39.360> a<00:02:39.390> dedicated<00:02:39.660> group

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
especially if you have a dedicated group

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.340 
especially if you have a dedicated group
leveling<00:02:40.590> up<00:02:40.760> so<00:02:41.760> I<00:02:42.030> was<00:02:42.780> talking<00:02:42.960> about<00:02:43.230> it

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
leveling up so I was talking about it

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.290 
leveling up so I was talking about it
being<00:02:43.470> a<00:02:43.590> little<00:02:43.800> boring<00:02:44.010> earlier<00:02:44.460> and<00:02:44.610> I<00:02:45.030> see

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
being a little boring earlier and I see

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.950 
being a little boring earlier and I see
that<00:02:46.070> there<00:02:47.070> is<00:02:47.220> potential<00:02:47.760> here<00:02:47.790> if<00:02:48.360> you<00:02:48.750> come

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:48.960 
that there is potential here if you come

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.590 
that there is potential here if you come
back<00:02:49.250> randomly<00:02:50.250> to<00:02:50.580> Frostfire<00:02:51.060> Ridge<00:02:51.090> after

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
back randomly to Frostfire Ridge after

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.480 
back randomly to Frostfire Ridge after
clearing<00:02:52.080> it<00:02:52.200> off<00:02:52.320> and<00:02:52.590> a<00:02:52.740> few<00:02:52.950> things<00:02:53.190> have

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:53.490 
clearing it off and a few things have

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:55.190 
clearing it off and a few things have
progressed<00:02:53.910> with<00:02:54.120> the<00:02:54.270> story<00:02:54.570> in<00:02:54.750> warlords

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
progressed with the story in warlords

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.790 
progressed with the story in warlords
what<00:02:55.920> if<00:02:56.160> a<00:02:56.370> few<00:02:56.760> extra<00:02:57.630> burnished<00:02:58.230> objectives

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
what if a few extra burnished objectives

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.280 
what if a few extra burnished objectives
were<00:02:58.980> there<00:02:59.390> you<00:03:00.390> know<00:03:00.510> that<00:03:00.720> might<00:03:00.930> be<00:03:01.110> nice

were there you know that might be nice
just<00:03:02.280> come<00:03:02.490> back<00:03:02.670> and<00:03:02.910> they<00:03:03.060> can<00:03:03.209> use<00:03:03.390> it<00:03:03.570> to

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
just come back and they can use it to

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.380 
just come back and they can use it to
excel<00:03:04.920> the<00:03:05.040> story<00:03:05.280> in<00:03:05.459> certain<00:03:05.790> areas<00:03:06.180> maybe

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
excel the story in certain areas maybe

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:07.760 
excel the story in certain areas maybe
the<00:03:06.600> ogres<00:03:06.930> have<00:03:07.110> a<00:03:07.170> little<00:03:07.500> bit<00:03:07.590> of<00:03:07.620> an
