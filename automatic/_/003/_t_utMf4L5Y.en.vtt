00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:12.469
 well my name is pablo silió soy 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:14.389
 professor of philosophy degree in 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:17.360
 university of buenos aires a director 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:21.170
 of a secondary school of lama palermo 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:23.330
 sounders and good and a little bit left 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.550
 dedicated to my first work is the 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:29.150
 Ricotero philosophy that was a job 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:31.130
 that I wrote during the year 2010 so 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.650
 good in the middle they spent a lot of 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:38.019
 very interesting things between since it 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:38.019
 he published the book that is going to be written 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:44.120
 it's a story that I'm going to try to 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.120
 be as synthetic as possible 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.170
 when I was a teenager I listened more 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:53.040
 that nothing a little of the music that was 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:56.250
 fashionable at that time in my sister 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:57.970
 Cerro metallica almost as strong and 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.530
 angry 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:01.510
 and the truth that did not lend much 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.580
 attention to the national at least in my 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:06.100
 first adolescence close to 18 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:11.030
 years at the same time I was 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:13.460
 thinking about what career to study one day 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:17.150
 in a hand place has a disc of the 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:18.950
 round that was the crime I grabbed him from 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:22.940
 a lot because I was struck by the 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:25.159
 I started to check color I was interested in what 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.380
 I started listening and well from that 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:30.770
 moment from now it was as if 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:33.140
 would have taken over me and somehow 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:36.770
 it looks king week to understand 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:38.750
 let's say everything that I started to generate 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.869
 that album and the lyrics we 're going to 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:45.259
 create them and with others needed a 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:47.479
 conceptual tool that seemed to me 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:51.400
 that philosophy could give me I do not say 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:53.830
 that only study philosophy because 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:57.460
 it arrived shtick in my hands but let's say 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:02:00.250
 that was let's say one more factor than in your 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.720
 moment really tilts the luck and 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:05.080
 Well, from then on, always 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:06.580
 was the idea of ​​making a book of this 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:09.410
 tenor but hey did not have the training 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:11.960
 until good at some point 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:14.570
 met a number of factors I already 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:16.870
 I had finished the race I was 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:19.550
 making it difficult to find someone who 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.260
 let's say I signed a thesis project 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:24.860
 that obviously has nothing to do with the 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:27.230
 round was already working so I 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.030
 I had my economic question more or 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.490
 less stabilized which I said 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.380
 well I still have all my afternoons 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:36.320
 free a donkey glass to the morning of 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:39.080
 so good teacher gets old go 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:41.420
 trying to see where we say in what 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.910
 income research group I put myself 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:46.370
 to do what I really always wanted 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.600
 to do is to investigate analyze the 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:51.510
 diet of the round ones that are 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:53.700
 from that moment that twitter in your 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:56.790
 hands on the record of the crimes and that 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:59.340
 Degenerate find things until 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.470
 you music here the book happened a while and 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:04.950
 I certainly never forgot this 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:08.580
 idea of this idea without needing 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:11.510
 write about whether there is what adjudicated 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.510
 I believe that 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:18.940
 first that good I was somehow 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:22.840
 assimilating the letters of the round ones to 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:25.239
 At the same time, the country was breaking down and 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.610
 same time and assimilating the 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:29.650
 conceptual schemes of philosophy is 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:31.180
 say those three good events besides 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:35.960
 family issues now do not come to 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:38.270
 case they contributed to let's say 

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:39.950
 I give you more or less a picture to 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:42.120
 that you can understand better from the point 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:44.370
 of more experiential view I 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:47.549
 33 a career as quite heavy 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:50.250
 pretty confinement I was not all 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:53.519
 the mornings let's say reading philosophy 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:56.670
 I saw everything that was happening in the country 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:58.159
 and somehow at night and 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:02.040
 round themes in some shelter 

00:03:58.159 --> 00:04:05.400
 offers us a sociocultural context that 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:07.170
 it would come down and one let's say career that 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:10.159
 somehow it was constantly advancing 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:13.560
 about my ideas and I was looking to format 

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:16.139
 when they appeared to us as a respite 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:18.570
 Like a breeze of fresh air, I do not believe 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:21.930
 that was what what was always 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:24.360
 there latent were tools for 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:25.919
 to open my head and show me other 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.449
 realities when he did not come to me 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:30.320
 around was really quite 

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:30.320
 decadent 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:34.710
 because to think that there is a philosophy 

00:04:32.759 --> 00:04:37.980
 bilateral 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:40.200
 for the same thing that one teaches you about 

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:43.350
 faculty of philosophy that can be 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:45.180
 talk about a philosophy in and xiana 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:50.190
 when Nietzsche does not write works of 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:52.650
 systematic philosophy let's say as 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:54.270
 that the academy let's say accept 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:56.790
 respecting all the rules of 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:59.160
 nietzsche rigor does not argue well and 

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:00.900
 nobody would argue that he is a philosopher 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.520
 I'm not assimilating the round ones 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:04.740
 rings because it's also a kind of 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:07.200
 different writing although said recourse 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:09.420
 to poetry in let's say in general your 

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:12.570
 works are written under another 

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:15.030
 type of format say that now 

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:16.950
 well how does this happen with said same with 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:19.860
 the poem of parmenides and so many 

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:22.590
 philosophers who draw on poetry and 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:25.830
 of reality there are many who have 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:27.690
 involved with poetry I think that it 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:30.360
 can speak of a cotera philosophy 

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:32.850
 because there are a number of ideas 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:35.400
 developed symbolically in their 

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:37.000
 letters that have an organization a 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:39.130
 coherence and a 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.410
 development so to speak conscious of 

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:43.990
 himself in the things that are said in 

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:45.460
 the letters I think are not the 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:49.090
 tasty I think they keep a 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:51.670
 relationship some letters with the others and there 

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:53.410
 a coherence and there is one let's say a 

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:57.700
 number of issues that have to do with 

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:59.320
 the philosophy that allow us to talk not 

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:01.390
 I know if a system but at least one 

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:04.890
 consistent ideas set well 

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:04.890
 established and with a clear direction
