00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.649
 the Marseille metro is inaugurated in 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.660
 1977 by gaston do it then mayor of 

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:41.980
 the city 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.100
 the two lines of this network whose 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.329
 last modification is dated 92 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.890
 today carries some 60 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:51.040
 million or parents to 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:52.420
 average speed of 30 km 30 hours 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.500
 five years after the first pick 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.390
 in this sense its construction 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.909
 the urban community marseille provence 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:00.790
 metropolis plans an extension of the 

00:00:57.909 --> 00:01:03.430
 line 1 of 2 4 km thus giving 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:07.360
 birth at four new stations the 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:09.250
 blancarde louis armand saint barnabas the 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:12.220
 feed terminator designed by 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:14.830
 the architect corinne vezzoni the works 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.140
 will sprawl over more than 5 years will 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.759
 marked by several phases 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.759
 the structural work and the formation of the tunnel 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:22.680
 will be executed from November 2004 to end 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:25.659
 2008 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.710
 end of 2009 these are the railways and 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:28.799
 the development and 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:32.020
 of equipment that are completed 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.880
 finally on May 6, 2010 the extension 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.270
 of line 1 of the metro de marseille de 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.270
 commissioning 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:42.730
 the program of the station is constituted 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:43.440
 of several elements a mouth of 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:48.250
 Metro 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:51.290
 its access is a subscribers parking and a 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:53.660
 Bus terminal on the surface 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:55.460
 this one hosts different lines of 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:57.080
 network rtm as well as lines 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:00.470
 interregional that make this 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:05.390
 station a full multimodal pole 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:08.619
 we have a big fan who will allow 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:10.940
 to access the metro at the ml station 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:12.590
 public space if they extend into one 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:16.340
 placette we avoid being right away 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:19.100
 underground we access the volume 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.840
 Underground station hall 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.940
 hosts composting bollards 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.090
 opens onto the mezzanine overlooking the 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.090
 docks 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.610
 these are distributed by alcoves 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:35.470
 lateral spatial continuity is done 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:40.300
 by the light that diffuses through the 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:41.860
 poles up to date in the wall once on 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:46.060
 which one becomes aware of the unity 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:48.040
 of the volume one discovers the beams in 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.720
 concrete that support the mezzanine and 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.110
 highlights the structural issues of 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.110
 the building 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.360
 the modes of distribution that articulates 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.590
 the different levels of the project are 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.069
 accessible to people with mobility 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.069
 scaled down 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:25.890
 circulations create courses that 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:28.370
 brings the used to live and see the space 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.370
 differently 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:00.700
 you are alone it is very important to all 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.070
 the levels actually like you the 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:06.100
 say it was important to say also 

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:08.830
 we go down very deep and up there goes 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:11.230
 by a door that is quite low we have 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:14.500
 this crush effect for after re 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:15.850
 dilate the space indeed the porticoes 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.030
 restores a human scale to the project 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:21.850
 while marking its limits 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:25.510
 the first with the city and then between 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:28.060
 subway station and the outside between the 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:30.100
 hall and the distribution alcoves is 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:33.190
 finally between the alcoves and the dock 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:35.770
 Metro the monumentality of the volumes 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:37.600
 underground is not oppressive the 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:41.010
 uniform light spots and neon lights 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:41.010
 enhance the sense of security 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:44.500
 natural brightness seems to be 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:48.210
 extend underground thanks to the games of 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:48.210
 direct and indirect light 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:06.180
 access to the car park offers a glimpse of the 

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:08.220
 underground dimension of the project a long 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:09.690
 tunnel lit artificially our 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:12.750
 guides down to the lower level of 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:14.420
 parking its ceiling up to date and meets the 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:16.920
 lighting and ventilation problems 

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:19.350
 natural light and weapons 

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:22.320
 brings well-being feelings of 

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:25.010
 safety vegetation makes the connection with 

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:25.010
 the surface 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:42.430
 how to materialize this descent from 

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:45.550
 plastic way and how to play with 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:49.290
 light and this idea of â€‹â€‹proposing 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:53.440
 raw concrete with plank formwork 

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:55.840
 of natural wood so avoid any side 

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:59.110
 artificial all boards are 

00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:01.180
 Calpine and draw so that 

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:02.680
 she plays with the light the light of 

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:05.500
 sun when according to the hours of the 

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:07.570
 day bounces on all these small 

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:09.330
 shades of concrete that gives it a 

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:12.070
 material material 

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:15.280
 the play of materials makes the connection between 

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:17.050
 the surface and the basement the different 

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:17.920
 concrete to accompany users in its 

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:19.360
 descent 

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:22.270
 recalling the minerality of his 

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:24.610
 environment the color of the walls of 

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:26.140
 alcohol made from milk powder 

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:27.000
 evokes the land thrust 

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:30.220
 surrounding 

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.950
 outside the sun's run and the 

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:34.570
 public lighting animates the material the 

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:38.220
 built is highlighted by its frame 

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:38.220
 landscape in the Mediterranean light 

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:45.420
 the regularities of textures and 

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:48.680
 geometries establishes a dialogue with the 

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:48.680
 large landscape of the surrounding massifs 

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:54.540
 the architecture of corinne vezzoni and 

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:57.980
 it's all the way out of 

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:57.980
 the direct environment of the city 

00:07:07.289 --> 00:07:12.509
 achievement achieves its objectives 

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:15.180
 even if his attendance is lower 

00:07:12.509 --> 00:07:18.089
 than expected this station stands out from the 

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:19.589
 remainder of the Marseilles network has constraint 

00:07:18.089 --> 00:07:22.139
 she says metric equivalent 

00:07:19.589 --> 00:07:24.389
 the prefecture station is pale 

00:07:22.139 --> 00:07:26.219
 figure facing the fodder that we 

00:07:24.389 --> 00:07:29.449
 offers an original practice of 

00:07:26.219 --> 00:07:29.449
 earth infrastructures
