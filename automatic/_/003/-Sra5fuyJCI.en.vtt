00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
my other drift tunes for one I made the

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.970 
my other drift tunes for one I made the
front<00:00:59.280> end<00:00:59.579> of<00:00:59.730> this<00:00:59.879> car<00:01:00.289> super<00:01:01.289> high<00:01:01.469> in<00:01:01.859> the

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
front end of this car super high in the

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.969 
front end of this car super high in the
rear<00:01:02.219> low<00:01:02.520> so<00:01:03.180> it<00:01:03.420> does<00:01:03.660> body<00:01:04.049> roll<00:01:04.439> but<00:01:04.799> it

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
rear low so it does body roll but it

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.590 
rear low so it does body roll but it
looks<00:01:05.250> pretty<00:01:05.369> sick<00:01:05.909> in<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.090> back<00:01:06.330> because

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
looks pretty sick in the back because

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.750 
looks pretty sick in the back because
the<00:01:06.689> backs<00:01:06.930> all<00:01:07.140> low<00:01:07.439> and<00:01:07.650> you<00:01:08.130> can<00:01:08.280> you<00:01:08.610> can

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
the backs all low and you can you can

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.820 
the backs all low and you can you can
see<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.060> power<00:01:09.270> every<00:01:09.780> time<00:01:09.960> I<00:01:09.990> tap<00:01:10.619> on<00:01:10.770> the

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
see the power every time I tap on the

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.219 
see the power every time I tap on the
gas<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.909> back<00:01:12.119> end<00:01:12.390> just<00:01:12.600> goes<00:01:12.750> right<00:01:12.990> to<00:01:13.200> the

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
gas the back end just goes right to the

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.560 
gas the back end just goes right to the
ground<00:01:13.409> it's<00:01:14.189> pretty<00:01:14.430> slick-looking<00:01:14.700> and<00:01:15.330> I

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570

again<00:01:27.689> I<00:01:27.720> think<00:01:27.840> over<00:01:28.170> 13k<00:01:28.619> which<00:01:29.610> is<00:01:29.880> pretty

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
again I think over 13k which is pretty

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.660 
again I think over 13k which is pretty
good<00:01:30.960> honestly<00:01:31.560> like<00:01:31.799> it's<00:01:31.950> on<00:01:32.100> it's<00:01:32.430> not<00:01:32.490> the

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
good honestly like it's on it's not the

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.520 
good honestly like it's on it's not the
out<00:01:32.820> of<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.030> world<00:01:33.600> like<00:01:33.869> I<00:01:33.960> know<00:01:34.020> people<00:01:34.320> get

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
out of the world like I know people get

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.310 
out of the world like I know people get
16<00:01:35.040> k<00:01:35.280> and<00:01:35.490> stuff<00:01:35.729> but<00:01:35.939> 13<00:01:36.600> k<00:01:36.750> is<00:01:36.810> pretty<00:01:37.140> good

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
16 k and stuff but 13 k is pretty good

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.710 
16 k and stuff but 13 k is pretty good
not<00:01:37.500> many<00:01:37.710> people<00:01:38.070> can<00:01:38.610> even<00:01:38.880> get<00:01:38.970> over<00:01:39.150> 10<00:01:39.360> so

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
not many people can even get over 10 so

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.109 
not many people can even get over 10 so
I<00:01:39.960> was<00:01:40.320> pretty<00:01:40.500> happy<00:01:40.740> with<00:01:41.040> that<00:01:41.119> considering

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
I was pretty happy with that considering

work<00:03:27.989> tomorrow<00:03:28.349> either<00:03:28.530> so<00:03:28.859> it<00:03:29.310> won't<00:03:29.489> be<00:03:29.639> a

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:29.669 
work tomorrow either so it won't be a

00:03:29.669 --> 00:03:31.670 
work tomorrow either so it won't be a
problem<00:03:29.970> for<00:03:30.090> me<00:03:30.299> I'll<00:03:30.900> probably<00:03:31.109> even<00:03:31.349> get<00:03:31.530> it

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
problem for me I'll probably even get it
