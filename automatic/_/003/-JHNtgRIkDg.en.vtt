it isn't very good as compared to the
other<00:02:43.250> ones<00:02:43.730> you<00:02:44.600> would<00:02:44.720> really<00:02:44.900> need<00:02:45.080> a

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
other ones you would really need a

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.130

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
slingshot to go with this and then you

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.100

fly<00:05:03.639> off<00:05:03.790> quite<00:05:04.090> fast<00:05:04.479> then<00:05:04.750> it's<00:05:05.470> not<00:05:05.650> very

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:05.710 
fly off quite fast then it's not very

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:11.010

bullets<00:05:11.229> in<00:05:11.620> there<00:05:11.800> it<00:05:11.950> seems<00:05:12.220> to<00:05:12.400> work<00:05:12.430> if<00:05:12.760> you

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:12.910
