do what's mine so what we're going to do
is<00:00:30.539> really<00:00:31.019> old-school<00:00:31.529> method<00:00:32.070> where<00:00:32.669> you

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
is really old-school method where you

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.870 
is really old-school method where you
use<00:00:33.000> Easy<00:00:33.660> Off<00:00:33.870> obviously<00:00:34.410> so<00:00:35.219> it's<00:00:35.670> really

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
use Easy Off obviously so it's really

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.400 
use Easy Off obviously so it's really
important<00:00:36.270> that<00:00:36.300> you<00:00:36.480> test<00:00:36.719> it<00:00:36.899> in<00:00:37.050> a<00:00:37.140> spot

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
important that you test it in a spot

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:38.869 
important that you test it in a spot
that<00:00:37.680> you're<00:00:37.770> not<00:00:37.980> going<00:00:38.129> to<00:00:38.190> see<00:00:38.309> first<00:00:38.610> I

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
that you're not going to see first I

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.580 
that you're not going to see first I
would<00:00:39.270> let<00:00:39.420> it<00:00:39.510> sit<00:00:39.690> on<00:00:39.719> there<00:00:39.960> for<00:00:40.170> at<00:00:40.260> least

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
would let it sit on there for at least

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.860 
would let it sit on there for at least
five<00:00:40.920> minutes<00:00:41.180> around<00:00:42.180> five<00:00:42.420> minutes<00:00:42.629> and

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
five minutes around five minutes and

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.170 
five minutes around five minutes and
then<00:00:42.960> test<00:00:43.230> it<00:00:43.379> like<00:00:44.219> pull<00:00:44.579> it<00:00:44.610> off<00:00:44.760> and<00:00:44.969> see<00:00:45.090> if

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
then test it like pull it off and see if

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.029 
then test it like pull it off and see if
it<00:00:45.300> messes<00:00:45.450> up<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.719> paint<00:00:45.960> you<00:00:46.379> don't<00:00:46.410> want<00:00:46.860> to

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
and cost you way more than it would cost

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:09.320 
pretty decent amount of pressure rate

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
pretty decent amount of pressure rate
because<00:02:09.500> I<00:02:09.560> want<00:02:09.709> to<00:02:09.770> make<00:02:09.890> sure<00:02:09.920> that<00:02:10.160> it's

salt so I take the prep saw and I'm

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:21.250 
salt so I take the prep saw and I'm
going<00:02:19.220> to<00:02:19.280> rub<00:02:19.550> it<00:02:19.670> like<00:02:19.850> crazy<00:02:20.180> just<00:02:20.540> to<00:02:21.080> make

it's a little bit of work but it's a
better<00:02:38.959> job<00:02:39.260> like<00:02:39.440> that<00:02:39.470> if<00:02:39.920> I<00:02:40.100> was<00:02:40.220> to<00:02:40.370> sit
