00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.910
 start by applying a protective base 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:07.710
 or a shine on your nails applies two layers 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.969
 of nail paint and let dry by 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:13.590
 complete before you start with the design 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:16.980
 using white nail paint we are going to 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:19.050
 draw a vertical line and dry by 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.680
 a few minutes and apply a second layer 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:26.580
 if it is necessary to draw a line 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.470
 horizontal at the end of our nail now 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.599
 with a black nail paint 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.980
 draw another horizontal line but this 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.980
 once in the center of the nail 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.890
 now he uses a toothpick and 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.360
 gold color paint to create lines 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.970
 as shown in the video this 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:51.379
 will represent what is the buckle of the 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.379
 santa costume girdle 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.030
 and that's how our first design looks 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:08.980
 second design what we are going to do is 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.980
 draw two cross-shaped lines 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:29.880
 so it was our second design 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.180
 for this third design you can use 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.950
 chopsticks to give it the shape or 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:40.000
 simply the paint brush of 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:44.640
 nail 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.640
 creates circles semicircles 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.650
 this design will use state I'm going to 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.280
 use this to make it easier to 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:02.280
 see in the video 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:08.770
 bend the tip of one end 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:11.530
 of the tape so that it is when folding it does not 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:14.920
 I'll hit you with the other part 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:18.400
 double it and now using a pencil or 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:21.360
 pencil let's trace the shape of a 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.360
 christmas tree 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:29.660
 now using a scissors cuts where 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.780
 you traced the lines to create the tree 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.780
 of Christmas 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:44.910
 and gently start by separating the two 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:44.910
 folds of the tape 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:51.230
 Now place it in your head and make sure that the 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:53.720
 tape is well attached to your nail for 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.850
 that the paint does not run and the shape 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:59.000
 of the tree is according to how 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:01.730
 is on the tape applies one or two layers 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.940
 of one paint depending on how you 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:06.709
 you want the design to look but not 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:09.110
 let the paint dry 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:12.500
 complete applies the nail paint and 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:15.920
 While it's still wet it starts with 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:17.900
 remove the tape very slowly 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.910
 What if my Christmas tree has stayed? 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:23.030
 As you can see it's very easy just 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:25.910
 You need to cover pencil and paint scissors 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:28.220
 of nail for this last design I'm going to 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:30.410
 be using a broach to 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:32.680
 draw lines as shown in the 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:32.680
 video 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:54.490
 but if you do not have a broach 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.060
 do this design here I give you the other 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:57.910
 option 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:02.460
 you can use a toothpick and 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:02.460
 create another version of this same design 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:19.970
 once it is finished it is doing all the 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:23.120
 designs on your nails let dry by 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:25.430
 complete and apply a protective layer or 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:29.090
 shine to protect your designs and that 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:33.370
 these last longer on your nails and that's how it is 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:33.370
 how all the designs look together 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:38.500
 You can use all the designs as well 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:41.110
 shows it right now in the video or you can 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:45.150
 paint your nails in one color and make 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:45.150
 design on only one of your nails 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:50.650
