but<00:02:15.390> lyrica<00:02:15.900> which<00:02:16.080> is<00:02:16.200> pre<00:02:16.440> gabilan<00:02:16.920> would<00:02:17.160> be

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
but lyrica which is pre gabilan would be

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.130 
but lyrica which is pre gabilan would be
another<00:02:17.580> option

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.790 

I<00:02:20.200> use<00:02:20.860> omeprazole<00:02:21.360> for<00:02:22.360> most<00:02:23.319> of<00:02:23.500> our<00:02:23.620> guys

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
I use omeprazole for most of our guys

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.250 
I use omeprazole for most of our guys
and<00:02:24.280> the<00:02:25.270> other<00:02:25.420> option<00:02:25.780> -<00:02:25.930> that<00:02:26.080> would<00:02:26.230> be

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
and the other option - that would be

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.140 
and the other option - that would be
cimetidine<00:02:26.980> and<00:02:27.430> which<00:02:28.209> is<00:02:28.330> tagamet<00:02:28.780> and

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
cimetidine and which is tagamet and

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.280 
cimetidine and which is tagamet and
different<00:02:31.150> dogs<00:02:31.300> have<00:02:31.569> different<00:02:31.690> results

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
different dogs have different results

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.080 
different dogs have different results
with<00:02:32.470> the<00:02:32.590> different<00:02:32.860> drugs<00:02:33.100> so<00:02:33.610> if<00:02:33.819> one

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
with the different drugs so if one

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:35.340 
with the different drugs so if one
doesn't<00:02:34.420> work<00:02:34.569> then<00:02:34.900> talk<00:02:35.140> to<00:02:35.230> your

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
doesn't work then talk to your

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:36.720 
doesn't work then talk to your
veterinarian<00:02:35.740> about<00:02:35.950> trying<00:02:36.250> a<00:02:36.370> different

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
veterinarian about trying a different

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:40.500 
veterinarian about trying a different
one<00:02:37.320> we<00:02:38.320> also<00:02:38.590> used<00:02:39.310> oral<00:02:39.820> actin<00:02:40.180> which<00:02:40.330> is<00:02:40.480> a

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
one we also used oral actin which is a

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.170 
one we also used oral actin which is a
natural<00:02:41.110> anti-inflammatory<00:02:41.560> for<00:02:42.490> our<00:02:42.610> dogs

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
natural anti-inflammatory for our dogs

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.820 
natural anti-inflammatory for our dogs
we<00:02:43.540> find<00:02:43.750> that<00:02:43.840> that<00:02:43.990> helps<00:02:44.350> with<00:02:44.560> joint

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
we find that that helps with joint

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:47.430 
we find that that helps with joint
disease<00:02:45.190> the<00:02:45.730> SM<00:02:46.209> and<00:02:46.600> it<00:02:46.750> also<00:02:46.900> can<00:02:47.170> help<00:02:47.320> with

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
disease the SM and it also can help with

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.330 
disease the SM and it also can help with
the<00:02:47.680> inflammatory<00:02:48.459> bowel<00:02:48.940> disease<00:02:49.330> I<00:02:50.340> have

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
the inflammatory bowel disease I have

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.610 
the inflammatory bowel disease I have
resorted<00:02:51.970> recently<00:02:52.720> to<00:02:52.989> using<00:02:53.320> a<00:02:53.380> product

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
resorted recently to using a product

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.890 
resorted recently to using a product
called<00:02:53.739> temporal<00:02:54.310> pea<00:02:54.580> Temara<00:02:55.540> pea<00:02:55.720> is<00:02:55.780> a

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
called temporal pea Temara pea is a

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.350 
called temporal pea Temara pea is a
combination<00:02:56.470> product<00:02:56.770> and<00:02:57.430> I<00:02:57.610> actually<00:02:57.820> like

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
combination product and I actually like

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.080 
combination product and I actually like
it<00:02:58.600> because<00:02:59.200> it<00:02:59.530> has<00:02:59.560> a<00:02:59.769> very<00:03:00.160> very<00:03:00.670> low<00:03:01.060> dose

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
it because it has a very very low dose

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.900 
it because it has a very very low dose
of<00:03:01.570> prednisone<00:03:01.989> in<00:03:02.320> it<00:03:02.440> and<00:03:02.680> it<00:03:03.430> has<00:03:03.670> an

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
of prednisone in it and it has an

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:05.850 
of prednisone in it and it has an
antihistamine<00:03:04.180> in<00:03:04.840> it<00:03:04.989> and<00:03:05.590> the

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
antihistamine in it and the

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:08.550 
antihistamine in it and the
antihistamine<00:03:06.489> dose<00:03:06.640> is<00:03:06.850> low<00:03:07.120> enough<00:03:07.420> that<00:03:07.720> it

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
antihistamine dose is low enough that it

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.920 
antihistamine dose is low enough that it
will<00:03:08.800> decrease<00:03:09.400> any<00:03:09.700> inflammatory<00:03:10.030> reaction

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
will decrease any inflammatory reaction

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:12.270 
will decrease any inflammatory reaction
that<00:03:11.050> we're<00:03:11.170> having<00:03:11.320> but<00:03:11.560> it<00:03:11.650> doesn't<00:03:11.980> seem<00:03:12.130> to

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
that we're having but it doesn't seem to

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.180 
that we're having but it doesn't seem to

label dose on the drug I use it at a
lower<00:03:18.370> dose<00:03:18.670> which<00:03:18.970> is<00:03:19.180> kind<00:03:19.450> of<00:03:19.540> my<00:03:19.720> tendency

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:20.320 
lower dose which is kind of my tendency

with any medications that I use for dogs
who<00:03:24.070> are<00:03:24.100> really<00:03:24.549> painful<00:03:24.790> like<00:03:25.299> Shana<00:03:25.570> right

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
who are really painful like Shana right

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:27.630 
who are really painful like Shana right
now<00:03:26.049> on<00:03:26.320> her<00:03:26.500> three<00:03:26.739> legs<00:03:26.950> holding<00:03:27.370> up<00:03:27.489> that

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640

now on her three legs holding up that
hind<00:03:27.910> leg<00:03:28.090> originally<00:03:28.660> I<00:03:28.690> thought<00:03:28.959> she<00:03:29.140> had

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
hind leg originally I thought she had

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.170 
hind leg originally I thought she had
blown<00:03:29.470> down<00:03:29.650> an<00:03:29.799> ACL<00:03:30.220> when<00:03:30.489> she<00:03:30.640> first<00:03:30.850> started

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
blown down an ACL when she first started

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.050 
blown down an ACL when she first started
doing<00:03:31.329> this<00:03:31.860> but<00:03:32.860> we<00:03:33.010> later<00:03:33.130> found<00:03:33.459> it<00:03:33.700> was<00:03:33.880> it

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
doing this but we later found it was it

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.620 
doing this but we later found it was it
actually<00:03:34.239> her<00:03:34.720> ACL<00:03:34.900> her<00:03:35.500> knee<00:03:35.650> is<00:03:35.680> fine<00:03:36.070> it's

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
actually her ACL her knee is fine it's

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:39.509 
actually her ACL her knee is fine it's
coming<00:03:37.630> from<00:03:37.780> her<00:03:37.989> spine<00:03:38.320> and<00:03:38.680> she's<00:03:39.370> so

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:39.519 
coming from her spine and she's so

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:41.009 
coming from her spine and she's so
painful<00:03:39.910> that<00:03:40.060> she<00:03:40.239> just<00:03:40.390> holds<00:03:40.510> the<00:03:40.720> leg<00:03:40.870> up

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:41.019 
painful that she just holds the leg up

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:43.199 
painful that she just holds the leg up
so<00:03:41.230> I<00:03:41.260> will<00:03:41.680> resort<00:03:41.980> to<00:03:42.040> tramadol<00:03:42.640> when<00:03:42.940> she's

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:43.209 
so I will resort to tramadol when she's

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:46.020 
so I will resort to tramadol when she's
having<00:03:43.390> really<00:03:44.140> bad<00:03:44.350> day<00:03:44.680> or<00:03:44.950> we<00:03:45.640> can<00:03:45.790> up<00:03:45.880> our

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.180 
having really bad day or we can up our
gabapentin<00:03:46.360> instead<00:03:47.200> of<00:03:47.290> giving<00:03:47.500> two<00:03:47.769> times<00:03:48.010> a

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
gabapentin instead of giving two times a

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.250 
gabapentin instead of giving two times a
day<00:03:48.220> we<00:03:48.610> can<00:03:48.760> go<00:03:48.880> to<00:03:48.940> three<00:03:49.209> times<00:03:49.420> a<00:03:49.570> day<00:03:49.720> or<00:03:50.049> we

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:52.959 
have room to increase the dose I also

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:56.160 
have room to increase the dose I also
use<00:03:53.380> a<00:03:54.090> draining<00:03:55.090> diet<00:03:55.390> for<00:03:55.780> these<00:03:55.900> guys

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.170 
use a draining diet for these guys

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:58.680 
use a draining diet for these guys
because<00:03:56.739> if<00:03:56.890> you<00:03:56.980> remember<00:03:57.310> the<00:03:57.730> Siringo

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:58.690 
because if you remember the Siringo

because if you remember the Siringo
mahalia<00:03:59.200> which<00:03:59.500> is<00:03:59.680> also<00:03:59.829> called<00:04:00.070> sm<00:04:00.519> is

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:01.019 
mahalia which is also called sm is

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:04.259 
mahalia which is also called sm is
actually<00:04:02.019> caused<00:04:02.410> by<00:04:02.769> a<00:04:02.890> fluid<00:04:03.489> buildup<00:04:03.940> in

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:04.269 
actually caused by a fluid buildup in

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:05.759 
actually caused by a fluid buildup in
something<00:04:04.690> called<00:04:04.780> a<00:04:04.900> syrinx<00:04:05.380> which<00:04:05.620> is<00:04:05.739> a

00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:05.769 
something called a syrinx which is a

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:08.430 
something called a syrinx which is a
little<00:04:06.070> pocket<00:04:06.280> in<00:04:06.640> the<00:04:06.850> spinal<00:04:07.150> cord<00:04:07.269> and<00:04:07.720> so

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:08.440
