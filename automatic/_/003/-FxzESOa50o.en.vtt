we<00:00:29.189> usually<00:00:29.519> run<00:00:29.789> into<00:00:30.150> so<00:00:30.269> it's<00:00:30.420> going<00:00:30.510> to<00:00:30.570> be

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
we usually run into so it's going to be

we usually run into so it's going to be
fun<00:00:30.929> I<00:00:30.960> think<00:00:31.460> first<00:00:32.460> we're<00:00:32.610> going<00:00:32.700> to<00:00:32.790> look<00:00:32.850> at

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
fun I think first we're going to look at

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.810 
fun I think first we're going to look at
Stan<00:00:33.360> all<00:00:33.540> ten<00:00:33.780> number<00:00:34.230> one<00:00:34.579> this<00:00:35.579> is<00:00:35.700> an

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
Stan all ten number one this is an

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.780 
Stan all ten number one this is an
interesting<00:00:36.059> base<00:00:36.420> to<00:00:36.660> me<00:00:36.809> because<00:00:36.989> I<00:00:37.790> think

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
interesting base to me because I think

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.810 
interesting base to me because I think
it<00:00:39.120> would<00:00:39.239> be<00:00:39.360> extremely<00:00:39.570> tough<00:00:40.350> to<00:00:41.219> go<00:00:41.399> all<00:00:41.640> in

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
it would be extremely tough to go all in

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.910 
it would be extremely tough to go all in
the<00:00:41.969> space<00:00:42.180> just<00:00:42.870> because<00:00:43.170> of<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.320> same<00:00:43.620> thing

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
the space just because of the same thing

come out you have a nice lightning for

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.510 
come out you have a nice lightning for
them<00:01:06.750> help<00:01:07.320> take<00:01:07.530> them<00:01:07.770> out<00:01:07.920> and<00:01:08.100> then<00:01:08.310> you

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
them help take them out and then you

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.270 
them help take them out and then you
send<00:01:08.850> your<00:01:09.119> lava<00:01:09.570> hounds<00:01:09.960> in<00:01:10.070> there's<00:01:11.070> such

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
send your lava hounds in there's such

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.020 
send your lava hounds in there's such
separation<00:01:11.990> between<00:01:12.990> all<00:01:13.979> this<00:01:14.549> work<00:01:14.820> your

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
separation between all this work your

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.640 
separation between all this work your
balloons<00:01:15.360> have<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:15.780> do<00:01:15.930> now<00:01:16.110> you<00:01:16.170> could<00:01:16.409> rage

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
balloons have to do now you could rage

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.410 
balloons have to do now you could rage
out<00:01:16.890> here<00:01:17.189> and<00:01:17.369> hopefully<00:01:17.909> get<00:01:18.119> them<00:01:18.270> in<00:01:18.330> there

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
out here and hopefully get them in there

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.030 
out here and hopefully get them in there
quicker<00:01:18.659> but<00:01:18.869> your<00:01:19.140> lava<00:01:19.619> hounds<00:01:19.920> I'm

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
quicker but your lava hounds I'm

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.710 
quicker but your lava hounds I'm
assuming<00:01:20.520> you<00:01:20.670> know<00:01:20.790> air<00:01:20.970> traps<00:01:21.299> are<00:01:21.540> right

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
assuming you know air traps are right

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.080 
assuming you know air traps are right
here<00:01:22.020> in<00:01:22.229> these<00:01:22.439> areas<00:01:22.680> close<00:01:23.250> to<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.670> air

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
here in these areas close to the air

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.170 
here in these areas close to the air
defenses<00:01:24.659> I<00:01:25.619> think<00:01:26.520> your<00:01:26.640> lava<00:01:26.790> hounds<00:01:27.090> are

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
defenses I think your lava hounds are

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.719 
defenses I think your lava hounds are
going<00:01:27.299> to<00:01:27.360> go<00:01:27.479> down<00:01:27.920> before<00:01:28.920> your<00:01:29.369> balloons

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
going to go down before your balloons

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.130 
going to go down before your balloons
have<00:01:29.939> time<00:01:30.180> to<00:01:30.329> come<00:01:30.509> in<00:01:30.540> there<00:01:30.750> and<00:01:30.840> sort<00:01:30.990> of

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
have time to come in there and sort of

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.109 
have time to come in there and sort of
rescue<00:01:31.320> them<00:01:31.710> and<00:01:31.950> take<00:01:32.369> out<00:01:32.520> these<00:01:32.700> inferno

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
rescue them and take out these inferno

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.870 
rescue them and take out these inferno
towers<00:01:33.390> I<00:01:34.110> don't<00:01:34.560> think<00:01:34.680> your<00:01:35.009> kill<00:01:35.610> squads

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
towers I don't think your kill squads

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.149 
towers I don't think your kill squads
going<00:01:36.119> to<00:01:36.180> get<00:01:36.360> to<00:01:36.570> so<00:01:37.320> I<00:01:37.350> think<00:01:37.650> that's<00:01:38.070> a

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
going to get to so I think that's a

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.830 
going to get to so I think that's a
pretty<00:01:38.280> tough<00:01:38.549> though<00:01:38.909> I<00:01:38.939> lunataks<00:01:39.540> well<00:01:39.720> i

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
pretty tough though I lunataks well i

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.080 
pretty tough though I lunataks well i
was<00:01:40.590> looking<00:01:40.619> at<00:01:41.159> this<00:01:41.310> and<00:01:41.520> saying<00:01:41.579> well<00:01:41.909> it's

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
was looking at this and saying well it's

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.179 
was looking at this and saying well it's
probably<00:01:42.329> just<00:01:42.450> a<00:01:42.509> two<00:01:42.689> star<00:01:42.899> base<00:01:43.259> but<00:01:44.100> i

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
probably just a two star base but i

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.450 
probably just a two star base but i
think<00:01:44.520> i<00:01:44.670> would<00:01:44.729> try<00:01:45.180> a<00:01:45.210> go<00:01:45.930> ho<00:01:46.200> on<00:01:46.409> this<00:01:46.649> crazy

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
think i would try a go ho on this crazy

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.810 
think i would try a go ho on this crazy
enough<00:01:47.909> i'd<00:01:48.270> probably<00:01:48.810> bring<00:01:49.140> 3<00:01:49.619> golems<00:01:50.250> you

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
enough i'd probably bring 3 golems you

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.179 
enough i'd probably bring 3 golems you
know<00:01:50.939> one<00:01:51.180> up<00:01:51.299> the<00:01:51.450> middle<00:01:51.619> one<00:01:52.619> that<00:01:52.829> way<00:01:52.979> one

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
know one up the middle one that way one

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
to go maybe with a rage or if you're

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.220 
to go maybe with a rage or if you're
going<00:02:53.819> to<00:02:53.939> do<00:02:54.090> them<00:02:54.239> the<00:02:54.569> two<00:02:54.720> freezers<00:02:54.959> don't

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
going to do them the two freezers don't

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.170 
going to do them the two freezers don't
bring<00:02:55.409> a<00:02:55.470> range<00:02:55.709> i'm<00:02:55.950> not<00:02:56.129> sure<00:02:56.400> i<00:02:56.730> don't<00:02:57.090> have

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
bring a range i'm not sure i don't have

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.460 
bring a range i'm not sure i don't have
a<00:02:57.209> little<00:02:57.329> experience<00:02:57.419> with<00:02:57.810> the<00:02:57.989> rages<00:02:58.349> and

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
a little experience with the rages and

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.830 
a little experience with the rages and

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
are the freezes and stuff but i think if

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.119

base<00:03:34.489> I<00:03:36.379> think<00:03:37.379> it<00:03:37.500> could<00:03:37.680> be<00:03:39.049> surgical<00:03:40.049> hugged

00:03:40.219 --> 00:03:40.229 
base I think it could be surgical hugged

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:43.430 
base I think it could be surgical hugged

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.500 
your lava hounds like this basically

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.740 
your lava hounds like this basically
targeted<00:04:04.500> balloons<00:04:04.859> all<00:04:05.159> the<00:04:05.310> way<00:04:05.459> around

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:05.750 
targeted balloons all the way around

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:08.270

standard<00:04:08.909> I<00:04:09.510> guess<00:04:10.019> cold-blooded<00:04:10.799> loling

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310

standard I guess cold-blooded loling
attack<00:04:11.639> but<00:04:12.629> I<00:04:12.659> think<00:04:12.959> you<00:04:13.049> also<00:04:13.349> could<00:04:13.769> come

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
attack but I think you also could come

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.649 
attack but I think you also could come
in<00:04:14.340> I<00:04:14.549> think<00:04:15.000> there's<00:04:15.120> probably<00:04:15.180> a<00:04:15.389> double

00:04:15.649 --> 00:04:15.659 
in I think there's probably a double

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:18.589 
in I think there's probably a double
bottom<00:04:15.870> set<00:04:16.079> right<00:04:16.229> here<00:04:16.880> there<00:04:17.880> could<00:04:18.209> be<00:04:18.239> one

00:04:18.589 --> 00:04:18.599 
bottom set right here there could be one

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:20.270 
bottom set right here there could be one
here<00:04:18.840> but<00:04:18.959> that'd<00:04:19.079> be<00:04:19.229> a<00:04:19.259> pretty<00:04:19.500> bad<00:04:19.889> spot<00:04:20.250> for

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
here but that'd be a pretty bad spot for

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.820 
here but that'd be a pretty bad spot for
so<00:04:20.729> I<00:04:20.789> really<00:04:21.209> don't<00:04:21.419> think<00:04:21.479> so<00:04:21.900> I<00:04:22.139> think

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
so I really don't think so I think

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:24.200 
so I really don't think so I think
they're<00:04:22.950> probably<00:04:23.130> know<00:04:23.610> that<00:04:23.729> you<00:04:23.820> are<00:04:23.909> split

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
they're probably know that you are split

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:27.290 
they're probably know that you are split
up<00:04:24.240> is<00:04:24.539> a<00:04:24.570> double<00:04:25.440> and<00:04:25.590> two<00:04:25.740> singles

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300

probably show in the replay to see how

00:05:56.729 --> 00:05:59.899

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:52.320 
be a Tesla you're going to drop a hill

be a Tesla you're going to drop a hill
which<00:06:52.500> you<00:06:52.590> only<00:06:52.800> need<00:06:53.100> one<00:06:53.310> Hill<00:06:53.520> for<00:06:53.730> this

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:55.710 
core there could be tehsils in the

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:57.890 
core there could be tehsils in the
quarter<00:06:56.130> but<00:06:56.520> one<00:06:56.880> should<00:06:57.120> do<00:06:57.330> it<00:06:57.510> so<00:06:57.660> wherever

00:06:57.890 --> 00:06:57.900 
quarter but one should do it so wherever

quarter but one should do it so wherever
else<00:06:58.200> you<00:06:58.260> needed<00:06:58.620> on<00:06:58.800> the<00:06:58.890> outside<00:06:59.250> go<00:06:59.430> ahead

else you needed on the outside go ahead

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:02.810 
else you needed on the outside go ahead
and<00:06:59.730> drop<00:06:59.880> it<00:07:00.120> but<00:07:00.690> probably<00:07:01.310> you'll<00:07:02.310> only<00:07:02.550> end

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:02.820 
and drop it but probably you'll only end

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:04.910

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:05.880 
this base because you can just

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:08.660 
this base because you can just
completely<00:07:06.840> surround<00:07:07.230> it<00:07:07.440> coming<00:07:08.340> from<00:07:08.400> every

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:12.900 
standing you know there's not much

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:14.540

damage<00:07:13.230> you<00:07:13.320> got<00:07:13.440> three<00:07:13.620> wizard<00:07:13.890> towers<00:07:14.190> could

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:14.550 
damage you got three wizard towers could

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:16.310 
damage you got three wizard towers could
be<00:07:14.700> a<00:07:14.730> couple<00:07:15.000> of<00:07:15.060> Tesla's<00:07:15.480> or<00:07:15.630> one<00:07:15.870> testing

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:16.320 
be a couple of Tesla's or one testing

be a couple of Tesla's or one testing
more<00:07:16.440> likely<00:07:17.000> I<00:07:18.000> think<00:07:18.780> it<00:07:18.840> should<00:07:18.930> be<00:07:19.020> pretty

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:19.200 
more likely I think it should be pretty

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:21.110 
more likely I think it should be pretty
simple<00:07:19.470> so<00:07:19.830> hopefully<00:07:20.370> someone<00:07:20.400> surgical

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:21.120 
simple so hopefully someone surgical

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:23.060 
simple so hopefully someone surgical
