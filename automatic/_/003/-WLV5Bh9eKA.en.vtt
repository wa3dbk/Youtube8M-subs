00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:46.240 
off and I can actually feel it can

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.739 
off and I can actually feel it can
adjust<00:04:46.569> that<00:04:47.610> just<00:04:48.610> pull<00:04:49.119> the<00:04:49.240> bolt<00:04:49.449> straight

00:05:52.619 --> 00:05:52.629 
with the carjack compared to having

00:05:52.629 --> 00:05:56.509 
with the carjack compared to having
stands<00:05:53.319> under<00:05:53.559> your<00:05:53.680> foot<00:05:53.830> pegs<00:05:54.479> if<00:05:55.479> you<00:05:55.659> have

support idea foot pegs you've got jiggle

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:01.769 
support idea foot pegs you've got jiggle
and<00:05:59.289> muck<00:05:59.499> around<00:05:59.680> at<00:05:59.979> the<00:06:00.039> back<00:06:00.189> wheel<00:06:00.659> to<00:06:01.659> get

00:06:01.769 --> 00:06:01.779 
and muck around at the back wheel to get

00:06:01.779 --> 00:06:04.290 
and muck around at the back wheel to get
it<00:06:01.930> all<00:06:02.050> lined<00:06:02.499> up<00:06:02.709> to<00:06:03.610> get<00:06:03.789> the<00:06:03.879> bolts<00:06:04.149> back

00:06:12.059 --> 00:06:12.069 
through in probably cycle so let's let's

00:06:12.069 --> 00:06:16.540 
through in probably cycle so let's let's
go<00:06:12.219> hopefully<00:06:12.490> this<00:06:12.759> would<00:06:12.819> be<00:06:12.939> quick

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:16.550 

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:21.650
