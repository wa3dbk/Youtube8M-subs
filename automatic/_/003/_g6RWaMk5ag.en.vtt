glycerin<00:02:10.479> is<00:02:10.510> a<00:02:10.660> fourth<00:02:10.900> ingredient<00:02:11.050> and<00:02:11.560> our

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
glycerin is a fourth ingredient and our

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.430 
glycerin is a fourth ingredient and our
dew<00:02:12.160> points<00:02:12.490> are<00:02:12.550> really<00:02:12.820> really<00:02:13.000> low<00:02:13.270> but<00:02:14.080> I

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
dew points are really really low but I

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.470 
dew points are really really low but I
was<00:02:14.620> like<00:02:14.770> well<00:02:15.130> you<00:02:15.550> know<00:02:15.580> olive<00:02:16.090> oils<00:02:16.390> the

was like well you know olive oils the
second<00:02:16.780> ingredient<00:02:17.230> so<00:02:17.320> that<00:02:17.470> should<00:02:17.680> be

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:17.710 
second ingredient so that should be

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:19.530 
second ingredient so that should be
stealing<00:02:18.250> in<00:02:18.340> my<00:02:18.460> moisture<00:02:18.880> and<00:02:19.120> making<00:02:19.390> sure

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
of hold or a lot of structure that I

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.680 
of hold or a lot of structure that I

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
would expect from a styler I kind of

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:50.910 
would expect from a styler I kind of
think<00:02:49.840> that<00:02:49.990> I<00:02:50.050> could<00:02:50.170> get<00:02:50.530> these<00:02:50.710> same

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
think that I could get these same

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.190 
think that I could get these same
results<00:02:51.340> just<00:02:51.550> using<00:02:51.880> a<00:02:51.970> conditioner<00:02:52.570> on<00:02:52.750> my

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
results just using a conditioner on my

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.620 
results just using a conditioner on my
hair<00:02:53.470> my<00:02:53.680> hair<00:02:53.710> is<00:02:54.160> not<00:02:54.310> it<00:02:54.880> doesn't<00:02:55.060> look<00:02:55.270> bad

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
hair my hair is not it doesn't look bad

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:58.140 
hair my hair is not it doesn't look bad
but<00:02:56.170> I<00:02:56.470> just<00:02:56.740> feel<00:02:56.950> like<00:02:57.010> I<00:02:57.460> could<00:02:57.520> have<00:02:58.000> done

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
but I just feel like I could have done

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.090 
but I just feel like I could have done
something<00:02:58.420> else<00:02:58.690> I<00:02:59.020> probably<00:02:59.470> won't<00:02:59.830> buy<00:03:00.040> this

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
something else I probably won't buy this

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.850 
something else I probably won't buy this
product<00:03:00.520> again<00:03:01.150> just<00:03:02.080> especially<00:03:02.410> because<00:03:02.740> I

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
product again just especially because I

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
product again just especially because I
don't<00:03:03.040> like<00:03:03.190> the<00:03:03.370> smell<00:03:03.900> but<00:03:04.900> it's<00:03:05.740> not<00:03:05.800> bad<00:03:06.370> in

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
don't like the smell but it's not bad in

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.970 
don't like the smell but it's not bad in
terms<00:03:07.360> of<00:03:07.510> frizz<00:03:07.780> control<00:03:07.870> it<00:03:08.470> really<00:03:08.710> wasn't

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
terms of frizz control it really wasn't

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.690 
terms of frizz control it really wasn't
there<00:03:09.250> in<00:03:09.520> terms<00:03:10.000> of<00:03:10.300> defining<00:03:10.710> curls<00:03:11.710> or<00:03:12.310> you

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
there in terms of defining curls or you

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.850 
there in terms of defining curls or you
know<00:03:12.820> anything<00:03:13.360> like<00:03:13.510> that<00:03:13.540> I<00:03:14.020> don't<00:03:14.530> really

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:14.860 
know anything like that I don't really

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:16.470 
know anything like that I don't really
think<00:03:15.040> it<00:03:15.280> was<00:03:15.400> there<00:03:15.670> it<00:03:15.850> was<00:03:15.910> kind<00:03:16.150> of<00:03:16.300> just

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
think it was there it was kind of just

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.080

finer<00:03:20.920> hair<00:03:21.190> or<00:03:21.459> you<00:03:21.610> didn't<00:03:21.910> have<00:03:22.060> as<00:03:22.270> much

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
finer hair or you didn't have as much

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.560 
finer hair or you didn't have as much
hair<00:03:23.440> to<00:03:23.739> deal<00:03:24.100> with<00:03:24.310> um<00:03:24.580> you<00:03:25.060> know<00:03:25.180> it's<00:03:25.450> like

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:25.570 
hair to deal with um you know it's like

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:29.270 
hair to deal with um you know it's like
it<00:03:26.110> does<00:03:26.290> give<00:03:26.500> a<00:03:26.530> little<00:03:26.920> bit<00:03:27.700> of<00:03:27.930> hole<00:03:28.930> but

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
it does give a little bit of hole but

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.550 
it does give a little bit of hole but
I'm<00:03:30.280> just<00:03:30.459> not<00:03:30.690> super<00:03:31.690> impressed<00:03:32.290> with<00:03:32.440> it

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
I'm just not super impressed with it

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.530 
I'm just not super impressed with it
like<00:03:32.860> when<00:03:32.980> I<00:03:33.010> think<00:03:33.250> of<00:03:33.280> eco<00:03:33.580> styler<00:03:33.820> I<00:03:34.239> think

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
like when I think of eco styler I think

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:39.570 
like when I think of eco styler I think
of<00:03:35.130> hold<00:03:36.130> and<00:03:37.200> like<00:03:38.200> really<00:03:38.830> like<00:03:39.130> nice

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:39.580 
of hold and like really like nice

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:42.270 
of hold and like really like nice
clumping<00:03:40.300> of<00:03:40.600> curls<00:03:40.989> up<00:03:41.230> I<00:03:41.709> didn't<00:03:42.100> get<00:03:42.220> that

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
clumping of curls up I didn't get that

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:43.710 
clumping of curls up I didn't get that
result<00:03:42.790> with<00:03:42.940> this<00:03:43.090> even<00:03:43.330> though<00:03:43.420> that's<00:03:43.630> not

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
result with this even though that's not

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.020 
result with this even though that's not
really<00:03:44.110> the<00:03:44.260> intent<00:03:44.709> but<00:03:45.400> I<00:03:45.459> kind<00:03:45.790> of<00:03:45.850> feel

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
really the intent but I kind of feel

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.720 
really the intent but I kind of feel
like<00:03:46.090> this<00:03:46.420> took<00:03:46.660> away<00:03:46.959> the<00:03:47.560> essence<00:03:48.100> of<00:03:48.310> eco

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730 
like this took away the essence of eco

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:49.890 
like this took away the essence of eco
styler<00:03:49.000> and<00:03:49.300> I<00:03:49.360> could<00:03:49.510> just<00:03:49.540> use<00:03:49.840> a

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
styler and I could just use a

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.810 
styler and I could just use a
conditioner<00:03:50.170> instead<00:03:50.980> but<00:03:51.489> that's<00:03:51.670> really

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:51.820 
conditioner instead but that's really

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:53.310 
conditioner instead but that's really
