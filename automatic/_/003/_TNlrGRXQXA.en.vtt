00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:55.059 
kind of transform that being the first

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:56.549 
kind of transform that being the first
instrument<00:00:55.420> that<00:00:55.629> I<00:00:55.690> had<00:00:55.870> any<00:00:56.170> sort<00:00:56.440> of

00:00:56.549 --> 00:00:56.559 
instrument that I had any sort of

00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:58.290 
instrument that I had any sort of
classical<00:00:57.040> training<00:00:57.220> and<00:00:57.550> and<00:00:57.729> for<00:00:58.269> that

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:58.300 
classical training and and for that

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:09.620 
classical training and and for that
matter<00:00:58.510> the<00:00:58.780> only<00:00:59.079> instrument

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.860 

when<00:01:10.630> I<00:01:10.660> started<00:01:11.290> that<00:01:12.100> was<00:01:12.250> actually<00:01:12.430> a<00:01:13.000> big

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:13.870 
when I started that was actually a big

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:16.710 
when I started that was actually a big
thing<00:01:14.200> for<00:01:14.800> example<00:01:15.430> I<00:01:15.490> never<00:01:16.150> took<00:01:16.330> vocal

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:16.720 
thing for example I never took vocal

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.540 
thing for example I never took vocal
lessons<00:01:17.140> I<00:01:17.410> thought<00:01:17.710> that<00:01:17.920> if<00:01:18.100> anyone<00:01:18.340> had

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:18.550 
lessons I thought that if anyone had

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:20.790 
lessons I thought that if anyone had
trained<00:01:18.820> me<00:01:18.970> how<00:01:19.090> to<00:01:19.150> sing<00:01:19.450> that<00:01:19.810> yeah<00:01:20.770> I

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:20.800 
trained me how to sing that yeah I

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.900 
trained me how to sing that yeah I
wouldn't<00:01:21.160> be<00:01:21.310> as<00:01:21.430> free<00:01:21.820> to<00:01:22.240> discover<00:01:22.780> it<00:01:23.020> and

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:23.910 
wouldn't be as free to discover it and

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:26.370 
wouldn't be as free to discover it and
being<00:01:24.910> naive<00:01:25.300> about<00:01:25.480> an<00:01:25.690> instrument<00:01:26.200> made

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:26.380 
being naive about an instrument made

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.410 
being naive about an instrument made
every<00:01:26.800> new<00:01:27.100> chord<00:01:27.970> every<00:01:28.510> new<00:01:28.660> moments

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
every new chord every new moments

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:38.899 
every new chord every new moments
exciting<00:01:31.420> and<00:01:31.660> inspiration

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.890 

the<00:01:39.060> time

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:42.900 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:53.390 

 he's<00:01:44.290> waiting

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:53.400 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.970 

I've<00:01:54.400> gotten<00:01:54.820> over<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:56.350> idea<00:01:56.710> that

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:56.980 
I've gotten over the idea that

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:59.450 
I've gotten over the idea that
everything<00:01:57.340> needs<00:01:57.730> to<00:01:57.850> be<00:01:58.060> completely

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
everything needs to be completely

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.850 
everything needs to be completely
untrained<00:02:00.460> and<00:02:01.090> intuitive<00:02:01.870> actually<00:02:02.710> have

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:02.860 
untrained and intuitive actually have

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.390 
untrained and intuitive actually have
gotten<00:02:03.460> much<00:02:03.610> more<00:02:03.850> open<00:02:04.330> to<00:02:04.600> kind<00:02:04.990> of

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:05.400 
gotten much more open to kind of

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.150 
gotten much more open to kind of
technique<00:02:06.400> and<00:02:07.060> whatnot<00:02:07.420> so<00:02:07.450> I<00:02:08.050> mean<00:02:08.920> you

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
technique and whatnot so I mean you

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.670 
technique and whatnot so I mean you
can't<00:02:09.399> you<00:02:09.970> can't<00:02:10.240> play<00:02:10.510> live<00:02:10.810> for<00:02:11.290> five<00:02:11.470> years

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.729 

the<00:03:12.500> riptide<00:03:12.920> for<00:03:13.220> me<00:03:13.370> was<00:03:14.230> was<00:03:15.230> interesting

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739 
the riptide for me was was interesting

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:19.259 
the riptide for me was was interesting
actually<00:03:15.920> I<00:03:16.840> for<00:03:17.840> four<00:03:18.319> years<00:03:18.500> I've<00:03:18.799> been

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:19.269 
actually I for four years I've been

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:23.589 
actually I for four years I've been
toying<00:03:20.269> with<00:03:20.599> all<00:03:20.750> these<00:03:20.870> influences<00:03:21.620> and<00:03:22.599> all

00:03:23.589 --> 00:03:23.599 
toying with all these influences and all

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:25.899 
toying with all these influences and all
this<00:03:23.900> time<00:03:23.959> there's<00:03:24.439> always<00:03:24.739> been<00:03:24.950> a<00:03:25.370> very

00:03:25.899 --> 00:03:25.909 
this time there's always been a very

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:28.330 
this time there's always been a very
specific<00:03:26.269> Beirut<00:03:26.930> sound<00:03:27.290> and<00:03:27.650> so<00:03:27.799> this<00:03:27.980> album

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
specific Beirut sound and so this album

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:29.920 
specific Beirut sound and so this album
was<00:03:28.430> much<00:03:28.670> more<00:03:28.879> about<00:03:29.150> digging<00:03:29.480> deeper<00:03:29.900> into

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
was much more about digging deeper into

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:34.420 
was much more about digging deeper into
that<00:03:30.349> and<00:03:30.799> not<00:03:31.420> not<00:03:32.420> into<00:03:32.629> something<00:03:33.430> foreign

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
that and not not into something foreign

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.190 
that and not not into something foreign
or<00:03:34.670> outside<00:03:34.970> of<00:03:35.120> myself<00:03:35.480> it's<00:03:35.900> much<00:03:36.049> more

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200 
or outside of myself it's much more

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:46.090 
or outside of myself it's much more
personal<00:03:36.470> I<00:03:36.799> guess

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:46.100 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:48.130 

Oh
