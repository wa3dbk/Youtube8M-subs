00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:07.009
 in this new tutorial we will explain 

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:10.090
 how the propellers are balanced for 

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:12.640
 any guanaco teresa counter 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:15.870
 we would need your 

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:19.360
 a propeller balancer I have this 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.500
 which as you can see has a central part 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:24.380
 be under animals 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:28.070
 and you see that they had an axis this 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:30.770
 axle carries 222 nuts we have 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:33.140
 marked the center to know where it is 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:36.489
 the center to center it then 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.489
 we would be one of the nuts 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:44.530
 we would put our propeller to the propeller a 

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:47.620
 principle caught is with the we would put 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:50.199
 here and we would put our 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:52.449
 nut trying and I tell you that it 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:55.469
 stay as focused 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:55.469
 marcel back possible 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:03.180
 once we have it 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:06.370
 placed in the center and tight beige 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.780
 we would spend it here 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:11.710
 and we would have it 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.710
 as you see 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:19.390
 well this right now you see that it falls 

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:21.370
 for this side 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.370
 but we can only be in the center and 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:26.910
 forever 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:30.020
 it falls to that side that we should 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:34.659
 do then we would take chunk geology 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:37.640
 this is 220 grit 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:43.350
 we referred a piece of sandpaper 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:45.360
 and what we would do would be to sand the part 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.939
 the part of this from the part where 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:51.509
 we have more than that which is the part that 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:54.750
 we drop we would leave our 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:57.560
 elite if you see the path at the end 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.560
 Attack points 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:06.110
 with the wind and we would go again 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:10.270
 to place it in the center and you see that 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:10.270
 there is still more weight 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:17.200
 this would continue cutting I tell them what 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:21.520
 it would be a matter of going in the wind until 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:24.130
 until we spend our propeller and that 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.100
 let's get it to stay completely 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:29.510
 stable 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.510
 we would try again 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.260
 you see 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:44.890
 we would leave it there and now it 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:48.090
 because it is completely stable 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:51.490
 nothing else that simple so can 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:55.240
 balance a cut crisis this is 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:58.420
 all you know you take one like I like and 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:01.420
 you can visit us on the website www point 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:03.750
 point is then we wait and until the 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.750
 next
