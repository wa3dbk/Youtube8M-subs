00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.770
 stretch to the end of the eyebrow 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:31.619
 with a tail at the end then we will apply 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:34.500
 the mascara, make sure it's a 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.030

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.770
 layers

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.710
 type of brush in a very subtle way to 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.140
