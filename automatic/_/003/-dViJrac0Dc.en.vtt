00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.950
 hello people and welcome to my 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.470
 video to minecraft snapshot version 12 w 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.580
 Try 50 in the latest minecraft 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.950
 there are a few smaller ones again 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.799
 The first of these is that if 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.660
 here below in your toolbar about the 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.730
 Objects about it will now be the 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.600
 respective object name displayed so 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:23.670
 whole or paper and so on small 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.359
 innovations also become objects 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.650
 her now also 3d displays that 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.410
 It is not just the plates 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.750
 textures but the object is called 3d 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.469
 I find object actually displayed 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.690
 very cool looks better than before 

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:41.000
 and yes, a little update as well 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.410
 are now being thrown away too 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.940
 objects or objects of general interest 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.160
 There are enchantments on the floor 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.800
 I can show you quickly 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.989
 demonstrate 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.579
 with a decisive buck and that with 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.879
 a decision of the federal is new 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:59.660
 that's because of the 3 we are now enchanting 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:02.699
 Quick our armor here 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:04.619
 what exactly the color brings I know 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.650
 unfortunately not so soon that in 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.340
 have brought me something here 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.439
 a really 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.760
 as soon as I know what the summer brings 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:16.590
 I write that now in the video 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:18.060
 just so you could know that too 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.930
 So far, as I said, unfortunately not in 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.110
 bring experience 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.520
 this means armor here 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.680
 it shines like that now and if he is the 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.500
 now throw away as 3d object lights up 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.140
 which then still as well as a small one 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.689
 effect that was added exactly 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.439
 What else is there for innovations 

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:36.600
 Rockets are also his last 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.430
 update and that were also with 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.150
 sounds supplied means rocket approaching 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.150
 now as at 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.220
 just as easy as that, too 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.500
 a fireworks also actually stops 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.290
 a cool update as well 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.570
 Find her enchanted books now 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:56.490
 by crating them in dungeons 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.620
 opens there are those in there now or 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:02.130
 You can also call them villagers 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:04.410
 buy partially if you also in the 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.350
 boxes from the blacksmith or in boxes in 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:08.520
 I do not know for sure villages 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:11.180
 In any case, you can now too 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.350
 in the world exactly 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.000
 otherwise what else is it? 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.830
 the bigger news there is again 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.690
 a whole series of tricks is the but 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.250
 all are not spectacular when 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.870
 you are interested in that you can 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.940

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.290
 read up 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:28.050
 there may be a little innovation 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.760
 still for user the older java versions 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.740
 The wars now use a warning 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.720

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:36.600
