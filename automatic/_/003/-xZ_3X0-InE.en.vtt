I<00:01:21.600> think<00:01:22.170> amo<00:01:22.410> to<00:01:22.560> multiplayer<00:01:23.010> has<00:01:23.250> been

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
I think amo to multiplayer has been

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.300 
I think amo to multiplayer has been
played<00:01:23.700> like<00:01:23.940> four<00:01:24.360> million<00:01:24.900> time<00:01:25.350> competing

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
played like four million time competing

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.540 
played like four million time competing
against<00:01:26.700> yourself<00:01:26.790> is<00:01:27.360> stressful<00:01:28.430> coming<00:01:29.430> up

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:29.550 
against yourself is stressful coming up

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:31.220 
against yourself is stressful coming up
with<00:01:29.820> these<00:01:30.000> scenarios<00:01:30.450> that<00:01:30.840> people<00:01:31.140> play

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:31.230 
with these scenarios that people play

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:33.380 
with these scenarios that people play
over<00:01:31.650> and<00:01:31.680> over<00:01:31.800> again<00:01:32.070> now<00:01:32.880> how<00:01:33.090> can<00:01:33.150> we

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
over and over again now how can we

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.820 
over and over again now how can we
rethink<00:01:33.870> that<00:01:34.050> and<00:01:34.230> create<00:01:34.500> something<00:01:34.650> that's

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:34.830 
rethink that and create something that's

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:38.510 
rethink that and create something that's
new<00:01:35.190> and<00:01:35.340> interesting<00:01:36.530> we<00:01:37.530> started<00:01:38.250> getting

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
new and interesting we started getting

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.920 
new and interesting we started getting
more<00:01:38.700> Indies<00:01:38.970> a<00:01:39.120> symmetrical<00:01:39.630> maps<00:01:41.930> where

that's<00:01:43.200> a<00:01:43.290> choke<00:01:43.500> point<00:01:43.530> that<00:01:44.040> you<00:01:44.130> want<00:01:44.310> to

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:44.370 
that's a choke point that you want to

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:47.450 
that's a choke point that you want to
hold<00:01:44.550> I<00:01:45.020> think<00:01:46.020> I<00:01:46.170> ground<00:01:46.440> is<00:01:46.680> an<00:01:46.950> example<00:01:47.280> of

in<00:02:20.040> the<00:02:20.070> other<00:02:20.250> tower<00:02:20.489> so<00:02:20.880> there's<00:02:21.150> a<00:02:21.239> lot<00:02:21.450> of

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
in the other tower so there's a lot of

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.170 
in the other tower so there's a lot of
firepower<00:02:21.750> coming<00:02:22.350> down<00:02:22.500> the<00:02:22.739> hill<00:02:22.860> that<00:02:23.550> got

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
firepower coming down the hill that got

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.449 
firepower coming down the hill that got
all<00:02:24.390> simplified<00:02:24.989> to<00:02:25.350> one<00:02:25.560> turret<00:02:25.830> actually

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
all simplified to one turret actually

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:28.280 
all simplified to one turret actually
right<00:02:26.640> above<00:02:26.880> the<00:02:27.030> gate<00:02:27.209> which<00:02:27.630> we<00:02:27.989> felt<00:02:28.200> was

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
right above the gate which we felt was

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.759 
right above the gate which we felt was
not<00:02:28.530> as<00:02:28.650> critical<00:02:29.070> to<00:02:29.550> the<00:02:29.670> attackers<00:02:30.769> it's

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:31.769 
not as critical to the attackers it's

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:33.770 
not as critical to the attackers it's
pretty<00:02:32.040> obvious<00:02:32.459> to<00:02:32.489> us<00:02:32.790> when<00:02:33.090> when<00:02:33.450> we<00:02:33.540> start

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
pretty obvious to us when when we start

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.180 
pretty obvious to us when when we start
working<00:02:33.930> on<00:02:34.200> these<00:02:34.290> maps<00:02:34.530> that<00:02:34.800> they<00:02:34.920> have<00:02:35.070> to

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
working on these maps that they have to

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.120 
working on these maps that they have to
be<00:02:35.310> fun<00:02:35.640> for<00:02:36.570> the<00:02:36.630> hundredth<00:02:36.750> and<00:02:37.230> the<00:02:37.350> 200th

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
be fun for the hundredth and the 200th

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.080 
be fun for the hundredth and the 200th
and<00:02:38.280> the<00:02:38.340> thousandth<00:02:38.790> time<00:02:40.549> you<00:02:41.549> are<00:02:41.700> figuring

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
and the thousandth time you are figuring

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.490 
and the thousandth time you are figuring
out<00:02:42.180> the<00:02:42.299> switch<00:02:42.510> in<00:02:42.630> the<00:02:42.750> doors<00:02:42.930> yeah<00:02:43.350> the

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
out the switch in the doors yeah the

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.140 
out the switch in the doors yeah the
closer<00:02:43.799> like<00:02:44.250> you<00:02:44.340> want<00:02:44.489> to<00:02:44.549> prolong<00:02:44.700> like

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
closer like you want to prolong like

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.400 
closer like you want to prolong like
watching<00:02:45.480> people<00:02:45.600> run<00:02:45.900> through<00:02:46.110> your<00:02:46.170> map

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
watching people run through your map

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:47.930 
watching people run through your map
challenges<00:02:47.010> a<00:02:47.040> lot<00:02:47.130> of<00:02:47.370> the<00:02:47.430> assumptions<00:02:47.850> you

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
challenges a lot of the assumptions you

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.220 
challenges a lot of the assumptions you
made<00:02:48.120> about<00:02:48.239> it<00:02:48.510> like<00:02:48.600> oh<00:02:48.750> I<00:02:48.780> think<00:02:48.930> people

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
made about it like oh I think people

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.070 
made about it like oh I think people
would<00:02:49.500> use<00:02:49.709> this<00:02:49.920> Hill<00:02:50.160> for<00:02:50.630> sniping<00:02:51.630> line<00:02:51.810> and

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
would use this Hill for sniping line and

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.330 
would use this Hill for sniping line and
then<00:02:52.500> nobody's

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
then nobody's

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.640 
then nobody's
then<00:02:54.000> you<00:02:54.060> get<00:02:54.180> great<00:02:54.360> comments<00:02:54.900> like<00:02:55.080> this

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
then you get great comments like this

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:01.509 
then you get great comments like this
map<00:02:55.890> sucks<00:02:56.250> i<00:02:57.349> hate<00:02:58.349> the<00:02:58.560> spot<00:02:58.920> i<00:02:59.190> hate<00:02:59.459> you<00:02:59.489> a

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
different areas getting the distance is

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.089
