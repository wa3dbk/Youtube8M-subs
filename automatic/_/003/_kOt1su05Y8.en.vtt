00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.360
 I think 

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:07.120
 let's make for this there is a bow 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:08.569
 and photos 

00:00:08.569 --> 00:00:11.799
 frame 

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:13.849
 in the simplest way embedded 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:16.769
 photo shock 

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:19.039
 let's say I want to do first 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:21.249
 thin white border 

00:00:21.249 --> 00:00:24.259
 and then wider brown for this 

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:26.689
 no need two colors white 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:29.069
 who are already here 

00:00:29.069 --> 00:00:32.069
 and brown 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.570
 Well, let's say this 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.030
 call change tools 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.030
 size about 100 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:55.790
 set pixel dimensions 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.940
 notice that here 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.700
 here should be ticked off 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.820
 relative sizes 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.930
 for white kroenke 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:09.340
 we exhibit 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.340
 later these pixels 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.220
 and an unforgettable action changes color 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.220
 on white 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.850
 Here we attract points 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:26.360
 repeat 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.360
 this operation 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.700
 new pixel 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.940
 this time we ask 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.940
 fifty 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.000
 and color 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 brown 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.410
 it turned out franco 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:51.520
 simply and easily 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.520
 there is a more complicated way 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.140
 back to the original image 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.890
 the second way can be done simply 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.920
 real drama 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.910
 big and fat 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:08.240
 but first you need to hold someone 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.049
 preparatory work 

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:13.049
 make a copy in the layer 

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:19.359
 we will need this in order to 

00:02:19.359 --> 00:02:22.049
 layer courts ferment 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:25.049
 put another layer 

00:02:27.429 --> 00:02:30.379
 we don't need the first one anymore 

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:32.229
 his shoulders 

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:35.229
 we increase the size of the canvas 

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:41.069
 increasing them we are also not quite easy 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:44.069
 first flock pixel dimension 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:47.859
 uncheck relative 

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:50.699
 sizes 

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:52.549
 and produce little kids and 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:55.339
 the operation is considered to be organically 

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:58.339
 look frame size 

00:02:59.589 --> 00:03:00.789
 if a 

00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:02.859
 to fold 

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:05.269
 height and width and take 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:08.269
 from them if 20 percent 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:10.359
 10 percent 

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:12.159
 under our with me 

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:15.159
 will be 200 m 

00:03:16.419 --> 00:03:18.929
 often tables relative to size 

00:03:18.929 --> 00:03:21.929
 and more than 200 

00:03:29.169 --> 00:03:31.209
 loan received by syllable 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:34.209
 white light 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:40.589
 Here we have the background to create a frame 

00:03:40.589 --> 00:03:42.849
 now use 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:45.849
 such tool 

00:03:46.389 --> 00:03:49.239
 layer style 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:52.239
 this double cries import layer 

00:03:57.839 --> 00:04:00.839
 select browse styles 

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:03.809
 well, take 

00:04:03.809 --> 00:04:06.809
 any style let's say this one 

00:04:09.719 --> 00:04:12.719
 that's what happened 

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:17.239
 to change 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:19.939
 color premiere 

00:04:19.939 --> 00:04:22.099
 all marked those properties which 

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:25.099
 involved in this style 

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:29.240
 choose color 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.379
 we don't change it 

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:34.379
 on a more suitable to our foreign currents 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:36.240
 let's say some 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.240
 also about yellow 

00:04:42.069 --> 00:04:44.469
 You can also play 

00:04:44.469 --> 00:04:47.219
 other sliders 

00:04:47.219 --> 00:04:50.430
 and you can always change the external 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.430
 Viktor kia 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:58.770
 for example here and so 

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:02.860
 very clearly shows what is changing 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:05.979
 Well, save in the form in which it is 

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:08.569
 Here you see a completely different frame 

00:05:08.569 --> 00:05:11.039
 style 

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:12.789
 then it all depends on your imagination
