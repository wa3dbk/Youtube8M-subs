paint that on to the tip of the nail now
this<00:00:49.560> doesn't<00:00:49.830> have<00:00:50.010> to<00:00:50.160> be<00:00:50.310> a<00:00:50.460> straight<00:00:50.850> line

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
this doesn't have to be a straight line

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.330 
this doesn't have to be a straight line
at<00:00:51.420> all<00:00:51.630> so<00:00:52.200> you<00:00:52.290> don't<00:00:52.470> need<00:00:52.650> any<00:00:55.340> guideline

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
at all so you don't need any guideline

red to make sure it's nice and opaque so
next<00:01:09.509> we're<00:01:09.720> gonna<00:01:09.780> do<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.259> outline<00:01:10.710> for

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
next we're gonna do the outline for

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.300 
next we're gonna do the outline for
where<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.670> Hat<00:01:11.850> droops<00:01:12.210> down<00:01:13.310> everybody

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
where the Hat droops down everybody

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.700 
where the Hat droops down everybody
else's<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:15.060> Hat<00:01:15.270> points<00:01:15.810> up<00:01:16.080> almost<00:01:16.470> like<00:01:16.680> a

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
else's the Hat points up almost like a

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.440 
else's the Hat points up almost like a
triangle<00:01:17.009> and<00:01:17.400> I<00:01:17.490> didn't<00:01:17.729> like<00:01:17.850> that<00:01:18.060> cuz

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
triangle and I didn't like that cuz

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.419 
triangle and I didn't like that cuz
Santa<00:01:19.350> hats<00:01:19.469> are<00:01:19.619> usually<00:01:19.890> floppy<00:01:20.159> they'll

00:01:20.419 --> 00:01:20.429 
Santa hats are usually floppy they'll

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:23.149 
Santa hats are usually floppy they'll
should<00:01:20.700> stick<00:01:21.240> straight<00:01:21.539> off<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.840> head<00:01:21.990> so<00:01:22.740> I

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
should stick straight off the head so I

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.580 
should stick straight off the head so I
like<00:01:23.670> them<00:01:23.850> to<00:01:23.969> point<00:01:24.210> down<00:01:24.420> so<00:01:25.229> what<00:01:25.439> we're

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
like them to point down so what we're

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.399 
like them to point down so what we're
doing<00:01:25.619> is<00:01:26.509> you<00:01:27.509> just<00:01:27.719> start<00:01:27.869> to<00:01:28.170> pick

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
doing is you just start to pick

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.349 
doing is you just start to pick
somewhere<00:01:28.649> to<00:01:28.740> start<00:01:28.979> and<00:01:29.759> you<00:01:29.850> loop<00:01:30.030> around

00:01:32.349 --> 00:01:32.359 

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:35.029 

kind<00:01:33.359> of<00:01:33.390> like<00:01:33.479> a<00:01:33.600> C<00:01:34.200> and<00:01:34.499> then<00:01:34.710> you<00:01:34.740> come<00:01:35.009> down

00:01:35.029 --> 00:01:35.039 
kind of like a C and then you come down

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:39.169 
kind of like a C and then you come down
into<00:01:35.369> a<00:01:35.490> point<00:01:36.979> and<00:01:37.979> I<00:01:38.130> find<00:01:38.399> it<00:01:38.490> looks<00:01:38.640> best<00:01:38.909> if

00:01:39.169 --> 00:01:39.179 
into a point and I find it looks best if

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:50.760 
into a point and I find it looks best if
you<00:01:39.329> come<00:01:40.100> all<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.579> way<00:01:41.609> up<00:01:41.789> into<00:01:42.299> this<00:01:42.539> corner

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.090 

like<00:01:51.400> that<00:01:51.840> because<00:01:52.840> I<00:01:53.079> don't<00:01:53.170> I<00:01:53.470> did<00:01:53.920> them

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.179 
like that because I don't I did them
once<00:01:54.310> where<00:01:54.610> the<00:01:55.570> white<00:01:56.380> fluff<00:01:56.770> on<00:01:56.950> the<00:01:57.009> Hat

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:34.530 
pellet type thing and then you're gonna
take<00:02:31.480> the<00:02:31.540> red<00:02:31.930> and<00:02:32.200> you're<00:02:33.160> gonna<00:02:33.280> fill<00:02:33.700> the

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
take the red and you're gonna fill the

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:40.770 
take the red and you're gonna fill the
hot<00:02:34.720> in<00:02:39.030> you<00:02:40.030> want<00:02:40.180> to<00:02:40.209> make<00:02:40.269> sure<00:02:40.360> that's<00:02:40.660> nice

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
hot in you want to make sure that's nice

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:48.760 
hot in you want to make sure that's nice
and<00:02:41.019> opaque<00:02:41.260> and<00:02:41.500> not<00:02:41.620> see-through

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:48.770 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:50.470 

and<00:02:49.280> just<00:02:49.490> do<00:02:49.640> that<00:02:49.790> with<00:02:49.970> all<00:02:50.120> the<00:02:50.240> way<00:02:50.330> you

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
and just do that with all the way you

00:02:50.480 --> 00:03:10.710 
and just do that with all the way you
want<00:02:50.630> to<00:02:50.750> do<00:02:52.180> kind<00:02:53.180> of<00:02:53.300> do<00:02:53.480> C's

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.940 

I<00:03:11.790> think<00:03:12.790> my<00:03:13.030> polish<00:03:13.930> is<00:03:14.080> a<00:03:14.110> little<00:03:14.440> thick<00:03:14.740> or

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
I think my polish is a little thick or

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:36.160 
I think my polish is a little thick or
something

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:38.860 

so<00:03:36.740> there's<00:03:37.010> that<00:03:37.280> I'll<00:03:37.850> probably<00:03:38.180> try<00:03:38.660> and

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
so there's that I'll probably try and

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.640 
so there's that I'll probably try and
fix<00:03:39.110> that<00:03:39.320> black<00:03:39.590> line<00:03:39.890> and<00:03:40.070> get<00:03:40.160> those<00:03:41.650> white

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
fix that black line and get those white

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:45.880 
fix that black line and get those white
marks<00:03:43.040> off<00:03:43.250> of<00:03:43.460> it<00:03:43.610> from<00:03:43.850> this<00:03:44.260> and<00:03:45.260> again<00:03:45.650> you

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:45.890 
marks off of it from this and again you

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:46.990 
marks off of it from this and again you
just<00:03:46.010> want<00:03:46.130> to<00:03:46.310> make<00:03:46.430> sure<00:03:46.640> that<00:03:46.850> that's

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
just want to make sure that that's

00:03:47.000 --> 00:04:01.140 
just want to make sure that that's
opaque

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.150 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:15.600 

I<00:04:01.239> do<00:04:02.790> see<00:04:05.700> C<00:04:08.189> C<00:04:10.590> and<00:04:11.590> C<00:04:13.950> so<00:04:14.950> like<00:04:15.129> that<00:04:15.280> and<00:04:15.519> you

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:39.940 
little nail art brush and I'm just

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:44.040 
little nail art brush and I'm just
adding<00:04:40.449> a<00:04:40.780> little<00:04:42.120> glitz<00:04:43.120> to<00:04:43.330> it<00:04:43.630> because<00:04:44.020> I

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.050 
adding a little glitz to it because I

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.439 
adding a little glitz to it because I
think<00:04:44.289> it<00:04:44.590> adds<00:04:44.620> a<00:04:44.860> little<00:04:44.949> something<00:04:45.330> to<00:04:46.330> it
