when okay this week on the vegetable

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.180 
when okay this week on the vegetable
garden<00:00:10.230> elves<00:00:10.440> we'll<00:00:10.590> be<00:00:10.710> talking<00:00:10.889> about

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
garden elves we'll be talking about

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.420 
garden elves we'll be talking about
succession<00:00:12.000> planting<00:00:12.450> and<00:00:13.700> inter<00:00:14.700> planting

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:16.430 
succession planting and inter planting

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:20.269 
succession planting and inter planting
all<00:00:17.430> right<00:00:17.609> so<00:00:17.970> um<00:00:18.439> succession<00:00:19.439> planting<00:00:19.859> is

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
all right so um succession planting is

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.300 
all right so um succession planting is
when<00:00:20.550> you<00:00:20.730> plant<00:00:21.090> for<00:00:21.720> instance<00:00:21.779> a<00:00:22.260> short<00:00:23.100> row

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
when you plant for instance a short row

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.359 
when you plant for instance a short row
of<00:00:23.430> radishes<00:00:23.820> every<00:00:24.390> week<00:00:24.980> so<00:00:25.980> that<00:00:26.160> you<00:00:26.250> will

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
of radishes every week so that you will

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.250 
of radishes every week so that you will
always<00:00:26.670> have<00:00:26.970> fresh<00:00:27.300> radishes<00:00:27.750> and<00:00:28.080> never

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
always have fresh radishes and never

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.859 
always have fresh radishes and never
have<00:00:28.500> two<00:00:28.710> minutes<00:00:29.039> you<00:00:29.910> can<00:00:30.029> also<00:00:30.179> plant<00:00:30.630> like

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
have two minutes you can also plant like

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.560 
have two minutes you can also plant like
a<00:00:31.019> row<00:00:31.710> of<00:00:31.890> lettuces<00:00:32.520> every<00:00:32.790> two<00:00:33.000> weeks<00:00:33.239> which

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
a row of lettuces every two weeks which

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.260 
a row of lettuces every two weeks which
is<00:00:33.719> a<00:00:33.750> good<00:00:33.930> thing<00:00:34.200> now<00:00:34.800> I<00:00:35.640> this<00:00:36.510> year<00:00:38.120> took<00:00:39.120> it

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
is a good thing now I this year took it

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:50.600 
is a good thing now I this year took it
a<00:00:39.329> step<00:00:39.360> further<00:00:39.750> with<00:00:45.559> these<00:00:46.559> for<00:00:49.610> Melissa

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
a step further with these for Melissa

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.549 
a step further with these for Melissa
broccoli<00:00:51.680> on<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:53.010> same<00:00:53.219> day<00:00:53.399> February<00:00:53.910> 17th

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:54.559 
broccoli on the same day February 17th

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:57.529 
broccoli on the same day February 17th
and<00:00:55.559> I<00:00:55.890> planted<00:00:56.280> them<00:00:56.430> out<00:00:56.640> transplanted<00:00:57.449> them

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
and I planted them out transplanted them

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.959 
and I planted them out transplanted them
out<00:00:57.780> into<00:00:58.079> this<00:00:58.350> garden<00:00:58.829> on<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.250> same<00:00:59.460> day<00:00:59.730> I

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
out into this garden on the same day I

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.540 
out into this garden on the same day I
covered<00:01:00.899> two<00:01:01.140> of<00:01:01.170> them<00:01:01.530> with<00:01:01.739> a<00:01:01.770> bell<00:01:02.100> close

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
covered two of them with a bell close

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.359 
covered two of them with a bell close
you<00:01:03.390> can<00:01:03.539> see<00:01:03.570> that<00:01:03.780> these<00:01:04.229> two<00:01:04.290> are<00:01:05.010> much

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
you can see that these two are much

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:06.950 
you can see that these two are much
larger<00:01:05.729> than<00:01:06.000> these<00:01:06.450> two

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
larger than these two

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.750 
larger than these two
I<00:01:06.990> have<00:01:07.380> accelerated<00:01:08.070> their<00:01:08.369> growth<00:01:08.700> with<00:01:09.420> a

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:10.760 
I have accelerated their growth with a

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.640 
I have accelerated their growth with a
plastic<00:01:11.760> water<00:01:12.000> bottle<00:01:12.479> you<00:01:12.750> can<00:01:12.900> use<00:01:13.080> a<00:01:13.290> milk

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
plastic water bottle you can use a milk

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.800 
plastic water bottle you can use a milk
jug<00:01:13.710> you<00:01:14.250> can<00:01:14.430> use<00:01:14.640> a<00:01:14.670> pop<00:01:15.090> bottle<00:01:15.360> it<00:01:15.780> doesn't

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
jug you can use a pop bottle it doesn't

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.690 
jug you can use a pop bottle it doesn't
matter<00:01:16.229> just<00:01:16.610> by<00:01:17.610> having<00:01:18.000> a<00:01:18.509> small<00:01:19.700> plastic

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
matter just by having a small plastic

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.990 
matter just by having a small plastic
covering<00:01:21.509> that's<00:01:22.080> vented<00:01:23.420> don't<00:01:24.420> grow<00:01:24.570> faster

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 
covering that's vented don't grow faster

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.870 
covering that's vented don't grow faster
so<00:01:27.000> this<00:01:27.390> is<00:01:27.570> an<00:01:27.659> intensive<00:01:28.229> garden<00:01:28.729> it<00:01:29.729> has

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
so this is an intensive garden it has

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.240 
so this is an intensive garden it has
some<00:01:30.119> aspects<00:01:30.600> of<00:01:30.780> male<00:01:31.140> Bartholomew's<00:01:31.829> ideas

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
some aspects of male Bartholomew's ideas

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.520 
some aspects of male Bartholomew's ideas
from<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.610> Square<00:01:32.850> Foot<00:01:32.880> Gardening<00:01:33.259> and<00:01:34.259> it's

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
from the Square Foot Gardening and it's

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.380 
from the Square Foot Gardening and it's
also<00:01:34.740> what<00:01:35.460> we<00:01:35.579> talked<00:01:35.820> about<00:01:35.970> at<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.360> very

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
also what we talked about at the very

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.890 
also what we talked about at the very
beginning<00:01:36.689> inter<00:01:37.439> planting<00:01:38.210> so<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.509> idea<00:01:39.840> of

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
beginning inter planting so the idea of

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.700 
beginning inter planting so the idea of
inter<00:01:40.229> planting<00:01:40.680> is<00:01:40.890> that<00:01:41.759> we've

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
inter planting is that we've

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.429 
inter planting is that we've
interplanted<00:01:43.710> only<00:01:44.460> what<00:01:44.579> it<00:01:44.670> says<00:01:45.439> different

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
interplanted only what it says different

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.480 
interplanted only what it says different
varieties<00:01:47.100> of<00:01:47.130> plants<00:01:47.930> close<00:01:48.930> together<00:01:49.490> to

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
varieties of plants close together to

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.950 
varieties of plants close together to
get<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:50.759> most<00:01:51.090> out<00:01:51.420> of<00:01:51.479> this<00:01:51.960> very<00:01:52.259> small<00:01:52.409> bed

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960 
get the most out of this very small bed

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.639 
get the most out of this very small bed
we<00:01:54.960> have<00:01:55.170> a<00:01:55.560> few<00:01:56.490> varieties<00:01:57.030> of<00:01:57.060> lettuce

00:01:57.639 --> 00:01:57.649 
we have a few varieties of lettuce

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:01.639 
we have a few varieties of lettuce
we<00:01:58.649> have<00:01:58.799> radicchio<00:01:59.369> we<00:01:59.790> have<00:02:00.000> spinach<00:02:00.649> we

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
we have radicchio we have spinach we

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:13.059 
we have radicchio we have spinach we
have<00:02:01.770> onions<00:02:02.450> we<00:02:03.450> have<00:02:03.689> joy<00:02:04.619> joy<00:02:11.330> color<00:02:12.330> flower

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
have onions we have joy joy color flower

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:15.820 
have onions we have joy joy color flower
so<00:02:14.069> why<00:02:14.250> do<00:02:14.310> we<00:02:14.400> plant<00:02:14.760> stuff<00:02:15.090> like<00:02:15.270> this<00:02:15.480> -

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
so why do we plant stuff like this -

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:24.040 
so why do we plant stuff like this -
well<00:02:17.480> the<00:02:18.480> inter<00:02:18.900> planting<00:02:19.790> is<00:02:23.000> cauliflower

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
well the inter planting is cauliflower

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.839 
well the inter planting is cauliflower
which<00:02:25.050> are<00:02:25.290> ultimately<00:02:25.620> going<00:02:26.250> to<00:02:26.310> be<00:02:26.459> large

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849 
which are ultimately going to be large

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:28.250 
which are ultimately going to be large
and<00:02:27.120> take<00:02:27.360> up<00:02:27.510> the<00:02:27.629> whole<00:02:27.870> middle<00:02:28.080> section

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
and take up the whole middle section

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.119 
and take up the whole middle section
here<00:02:28.680> but<00:02:29.489> I've<00:02:29.610> also<00:02:30.739> transplanted<00:02:31.739> in<00:02:31.890> here

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:32.129 
here but I've also transplanted in here

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:37.330 
here but I've also transplanted in here
red<00:02:33.000> mizuna<00:02:33.650> bok<00:02:34.650> choy<00:02:34.950> red<00:02:35.940> bok<00:02:36.180> choy<00:02:36.510> and

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
red mizuna bok choy red bok choy and

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.580 
red mizuna bok choy red bok choy and
these<00:02:38.340> plants<00:02:38.879> for<00:02:39.330> instance<00:02:39.690> this<00:02:40.379> is

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
these plants for instance this is

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.330 
these plants for instance this is
actually<00:02:41.129> already<00:02:41.730> table<00:02:42.420> size<00:02:43.069> for<00:02:44.069> a<00:02:44.099> small

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
actually already table size for a small

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.190 
actually already table size for a small
bok<00:02:44.550> choy<00:02:44.790> but<00:02:45.480> they'll<00:02:45.660> get<00:02:45.810> a<00:02:45.870> little<00:02:46.110> bit

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
bok choy but they'll get a little bit

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.640 
bok choy but they'll get a little bit
bigger<00:02:46.410> and<00:02:46.650> all<00:02:47.099> this<00:02:47.459> will<00:02:47.790> come<00:02:47.819> out<00:02:48.650> except

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
bigger and all this will come out except

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.550 
bigger and all this will come out except
for<00:02:49.680> the<00:02:50.010> cauliflower<00:02:50.519> so<00:02:51.480> what<00:02:52.200> I've<00:02:52.319> done<00:02:52.530> a

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
for the cauliflower so what I've done a

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.420 
for the cauliflower so what I've done a
cauliflower<00:02:53.160> will<00:02:53.459> be<00:02:53.610> in<00:02:53.790> the<00:02:53.910> ground<00:02:54.150> for<00:02:55.430> 60

cauliflower will be in the ground for 60

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.460 
cauliflower will be in the ground for 60
to<00:02:56.550> 70<00:02:56.940> days<00:02:57.120> whereas<00:02:57.750> this<00:02:57.989> will<00:02:58.170> be<00:02:58.319> in<00:02:58.379> the

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
to 70 days whereas this will be in the

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.670 
to 70 days whereas this will be in the
ground<00:02:58.680> for<00:02:58.860> a<00:02:58.920> 30<00:02:59.190> day<00:02:59.310> so<00:02:59.519> I<00:02:59.730> can<00:02:59.970> grow<00:03:00.239> this

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
ground for a 30 day so I can grow this

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:05.199 
ground for a 30 day so I can grow this
pull<00:03:01.680> this<00:03:01.890> out<00:03:02.190> harvest<00:03:03.090> it<00:03:03.239> eat<00:03:03.420> it<00:03:03.720> and<00:03:03.870> then

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
pull this out harvest it eat it and then

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:08.479 
pull this out harvest it eat it and then
fertilize<00:03:06.290> which<00:03:07.290> is<00:03:07.470> a<00:03:07.500> side<00:03:07.860> dressing<00:03:08.370> of

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
fertilize which is a side dressing of

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:10.280 
fertilize which is a side dressing of
fertilizer<00:03:08.909> just<00:03:09.060> as<00:03:09.810> the<00:03:09.959> cauliflower

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
fertilizer just as the cauliflower

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:15.290 
fertilizer just as the cauliflower
starts<00:03:10.920> to<00:03:11.010> crown<00:03:11.370> and<00:03:11.730> make<00:03:11.970> its<00:03:12.180> head

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:21.520 
these lettuces mizuna spinach endive all

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:26.070 
these lettuces mizuna spinach endive all
these<00:03:22.050> our<00:03:23.050> planet<00:03:23.530> is<00:03:23.590> very<00:03:23.709> close<00:03:24.330> and<00:03:25.330> what

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:26.080 
these our planet is very close and what

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:30.620 
these our planet is very close and what
I<00:03:26.110> do<00:03:26.260> is<00:03:26.980> just<00:03:27.520> clip<00:03:28.060> the<00:03:28.300> outside<00:03:28.930> leaves

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
I do is just clip the outside leaves

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:34.650 
I do is just clip the outside leaves
like<00:03:31.630> this<00:03:31.900> this<00:03:32.260> could<00:03:32.470> all<00:03:32.620> be<00:03:32.800> just<00:03:33.660> pinched

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
like this this could all be just pinched

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:40.229 
like this this could all be just pinched
out<00:03:34.810> and<00:03:38.340> because<00:03:39.340> they're<00:03:39.459> playing<00:03:39.730> so<00:03:39.940> close

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:40.239 
out and because they're playing so close

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:43.260 
out and because they're playing so close
and<00:03:40.650> fertilizer<00:03:41.650> really<00:03:42.040> well<00:03:42.270> grown

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:43.270 
and fertilizer really well grown

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:46.290 
and fertilizer really well grown
intensely<00:03:44.130> is<00:03:45.130> you<00:03:45.370> harvest<00:03:45.850> the<00:03:45.970> outside

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:46.300 
intensely is you harvest the outside

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.780 
intensely is you harvest the outside
leaves<00:03:46.570> the<00:03:46.989> plant<00:03:47.260> will<00:03:47.500> continue<00:03:48.220> to

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
leaves the plant will continue to

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:53.220 
leaves the plant will continue to
produce<00:03:49.000> from<00:03:49.420> the<00:03:49.480> crown<00:03:49.840> and<00:03:51.690> many<00:03:52.690> plants

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.230 
produce from the crown and many plants

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.310 
produce from the crown and many plants
are<00:03:53.940> biologically<00:03:54.940> genetically<00:03:55.780> programmed

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:56.320 
are biologically genetically programmed

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.400 
are biologically genetically programmed
to<00:03:56.620> not<00:03:57.610> mold<00:03:58.060> until<00:03:58.330> they<00:03:58.750> have<00:03:58.930> a<00:03:58.959> certain

00:03:59.400 --> 00:03:59.410 
to not mold until they have a certain

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:02.190 
to not mold until they have a certain
number<00:03:59.800> of<00:03:59.980> leaves<00:04:00.489> so<00:04:01.239> if<00:04:01.360> you<00:04:01.450> keep<00:04:01.780> picking

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 
number of leaves so if you keep picking

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.350 
number of leaves so if you keep picking
the<00:04:02.470> outside<00:04:02.830> leaves<00:04:03.160> you<00:04:03.940> can<00:04:04.090> for<00:04:04.300> instance

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:04.360 
the outside leaves you can for instance

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:07.140 
the outside leaves you can for instance
harvest<00:04:05.080> this<00:04:05.260> lettuce<00:04:05.530> for<00:04:06.010> six<00:04:06.790> weeks

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 
harvest this lettuce for six weeks

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:10.949 
harvest this lettuce for six weeks
without<00:04:07.930> it<00:04:08.320> ever<00:04:08.530> getting<00:04:09.310> to<00:04:09.790> be<00:04:09.940> a<00:04:09.970> big<00:04:10.660> head

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:10.959 
without it ever getting to be a big head

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:14.220 
without it ever getting to be a big head
of<00:04:10.989> lettuce<00:04:11.320> and<00:04:12.209> then<00:04:13.209> of<00:04:13.450> course<00:04:13.750> you<00:04:14.050> want

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.230 
of lettuce and then of course you want

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:17.190 
of lettuce and then of course you want
to<00:04:14.260> plant<00:04:14.680> lettuce<00:04:15.209> at<00:04:16.209> least<00:04:16.630> once<00:04:17.049> a<00:04:17.169> month

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:17.200 
to plant lettuce at least once a month

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:27.920 
to plant lettuce at least once a month
if<00:04:17.650> not<00:04:18.000> every<00:04:19.000> two<00:04:19.209> weeks<00:04:21.600> okay<00:04:22.600> rolling

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:27.930 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:31.020 

transplant<00:04:28.930> seedlings<00:04:29.610> they<00:04:30.610> need<00:04:30.760> a<00:04:30.790> lot<00:04:31.000> of

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030 
transplant seedlings they need a lot of

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:32.730 
transplant seedlings they need a lot of
water<00:04:31.300> right<00:04:31.600> now<00:04:31.780> so<00:04:31.990> they<00:04:32.110> can<00:04:32.169> grow<00:04:32.470> big<00:04:32.710> and

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
water right now so they can grow big and

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:37.280 
water right now so they can grow big and
strong<00:04:33.100> and<00:04:34.090> don't<00:04:34.479> forget<00:04:34.780> flood<00:04:35.260> control

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:37.290 
strong and don't forget flood control
