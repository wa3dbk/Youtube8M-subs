00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:32.050 
the interspace so that it separates this

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:34.200 
the interspace so that it separates this
tank<00:03:32.380> from<00:03:33.010> the<00:03:33.130> rest<00:03:33.280> of<00:03:33.400> the<00:03:33.460> lift<00:03:33.670> okay<00:03:33.970> and

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
then we'll go into the lower sequence

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:36.990 
then we'll go into the lower sequence
what<00:03:36.100> happened<00:03:36.370> then<00:03:36.460> is<00:03:36.490> the<00:03:36.640> case<00:03:36.790> on<00:03:36.940> the

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:54.840 
heading our way down to the lower level
actually<00:03:53.560> we're<00:03:53.710> not<00:03:53.740> now<00:03:54.130> part<00:03:54.490> of<00:03:54.670> either

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:54.850 
actually we're not now part of either

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:56.640 
actually we're not now part of either
the<00:03:55.030> river<00:03:55.210> or<00:03:55.420> the<00:03:55.450> canal<00:03:55.810> because<00:03:56.500> we

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 
the river or the canal because we

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:58.500 
the river or the canal because we
separated<00:03:57.190> this<00:03:57.280> time<00:03:57.490> from<00:03:57.640> the<00:03:57.760> canal<00:03:58.060> we're

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
separated this time from the canal we're

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.240 
separated this time from the canal we're
now<00:03:58.630> no<00:03:58.810> longer<00:03:58.960> part<00:03:59.290> of<00:03:59.350> either<00:03:59.470> we're<00:03:59.980> in<00:04:00.100> no

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 
now no longer part of either we're in no

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:02.610 
now no longer part of either we're in no
man's<00:04:00.490> land<00:04:00.610> oh<00:04:00.970> my<00:04:01.120> as<00:04:01.990> we<00:04:02.110> hit<00:04:02.230> the<00:04:02.320> bottom

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
man's land oh my as we hit the bottom

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.080 
man's land oh my as we hit the bottom
the<00:04:02.980> gates<00:04:03.190> are<00:04:03.250> open<00:04:03.460> we<00:04:03.550> become<00:04:03.790> part<00:04:04.000> the

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 
the gates are open we become part the

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:05.190 
the gates are open we become part the
river<00:04:04.270> then<00:04:04.420> yeah<00:04:04.630> and<00:04:04.750> we'll<00:04:04.960> be<00:04:05.050> able<00:04:05.110> to

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.200 
river then yeah and we'll be able to

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.300 
river then yeah and we'll be able to
sail<00:04:05.380> out<00:04:05.530> to<00:04:05.560> the<00:04:05.710> river<00:04:05.830> and<00:04:05.920> off<00:04:06.100> to

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
sail out to the river and off to

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:08.790 
sail out to the river and off to
whichever<00:04:06.880> directory<00:04:07.360> wanna<00:04:07.570> go<00:04:07.690> yeah<00:04:07.870> these

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:08.800 
whichever directory wanna go yeah these

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.280 
whichever directory wanna go yeah these
vessels<00:04:09.280> carried<00:04:09.970> a<00:04:10.090> lot<00:04:10.390> of<00:04:10.510> cargo<00:04:10.930> whether

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290 
vessels carried a lot of cargo whether

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:13.770 
vessels carried a lot of cargo whether
it's<00:04:11.500> salt<00:04:11.860> china<00:04:12.250> clay<00:04:12.640> whatever<00:04:13.150> were<00:04:13.630> they

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:13.780 
it's salt china clay whatever were they

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:15.630 
it's salt china clay whatever were they
allowed<00:04:13.990> to<00:04:14.170> travel<00:04:14.380> through<00:04:14.800> here<00:04:15.130> and<00:04:15.460> on

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:15.640 
allowed to travel through here and on

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:17.160 
allowed to travel through here and on
the<00:04:15.670> lift<00:04:15.910> with<00:04:16.150> a<00:04:16.180> full<00:04:16.450> load<00:04:16.480> it<00:04:16.959> doesn't

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:17.170 
the lift with a full load it doesn't

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:18.120 
the lift with a full load it doesn't
really<00:04:17.260> matter<00:04:17.380> how<00:04:17.560> much<00:04:17.709> weight<00:04:17.859> is<00:04:17.980> in<00:04:18.100> your

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.130 
really matter how much weight is in your

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:20.310 
really matter how much weight is in your
boat<00:04:18.370> I<00:04:18.549> mean<00:04:18.700> the<00:04:18.970> tanks<00:04:19.359> themselves<00:04:19.480> they

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 
boat I mean the tanks themselves they

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.860 
boat I mean the tanks themselves they
hold<00:04:20.560> 250<00:04:21.250> tons<00:04:21.459> of<00:04:21.580> water<00:04:21.760> so<00:04:22.540> you've<00:04:22.660> got<00:04:22.690> the

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:22.870 
hold 250 tons of water so you've got the

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:24.390 
hold 250 tons of water so you've got the
Archimedes<00:04:23.380> theory<00:04:23.770> of<00:04:23.860> water<00:04:24.070> displacement

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:24.400 
Archimedes theory of water displacement

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:25.920 
Archimedes theory of water displacement
so<00:04:24.850> you<00:04:24.970> could<00:04:25.120> stick<00:04:25.270> as<00:04:25.360> much<00:04:25.510> waiting<00:04:25.810> one

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:25.930 
so you could stick as much waiting one

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:27.240 
so you could stick as much waiting one
there<00:04:26.080> as<00:04:26.170> one<00:04:26.260> key<00:04:26.500> it<00:04:26.680> will<00:04:26.710> just<00:04:26.920> displace

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.250 
there as one key it will just displace

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:28.590 
there as one key it will just displace
its<00:04:27.400> own<00:04:27.490> weight<00:04:27.670> in<00:04:27.700> water<00:04:27.940> and<00:04:28.330> take<00:04:28.540> you

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:28.600 
its own weight in water and take you

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.840 
its own weight in water and take you
down<00:04:28.750> through<00:04:28.900> the<00:04:28.990> level<00:04:29.400> the<00:04:30.400> caisson<00:04:30.760> has

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:30.850 
down through the level the caisson has

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:32.540 
down through the level the caisson has
just<00:04:31.000> passed<00:04:31.150> this<00:04:31.420> that's<00:04:31.690> on<00:04:31.810> its<00:04:31.930> way<00:04:31.960> up

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
just passed this that's on its way up

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
just passed this that's on its way up
that'll<00:04:33.550> be<00:04:33.610> taking<00:04:33.850> those<00:04:33.940> voters<00:04:34.180> up<00:04:34.390> to<00:04:34.480> the

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:34.570 
that'll be taking those voters up to the

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:36.300 
that'll be taking those voters up to the
top<00:04:34.720> level<00:04:34.930> there<00:04:35.230> we're<00:04:35.710> just<00:04:35.860> making<00:04:35.980> a<00:04:36.190> way

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:36.310 
top level there we're just making a way

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:37.920 
top level there we're just making a way
down<00:04:36.490> to<00:04:36.640> the<00:04:36.730> lower<00:04:36.880> area<00:04:37.180> now<00:04:37.480> what<00:04:37.660> we'll<00:04:37.810> do

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:37.930 
down to the lower area now what we'll do

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:39.780 
down to the lower area now what we'll do
we'll<00:04:38.110> cently<00:04:38.320> go<00:04:38.440> into<00:04:38.650> a<00:04:38.680> creep<00:04:38.950> speed<00:04:39.250> it's

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:39.790 
we'll cently go into a creep speed it's

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:41.370 
we'll cently go into a creep speed it's
a<00:04:39.850> lot<00:04:40.030> to<00:04:40.150> poo<00:04:40.270> actually<00:04:40.390> part<00:04:40.840> this<00:04:41.050> tank

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:41.380 
a lot to poo actually part this tank

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:43.560 
a lot to poo actually part this tank
down<00:04:41.620> onto<00:04:42.070> the<00:04:42.160> lower<00:04:42.280> river<00:04:42.550> yeah<00:04:43.180> the<00:04:43.390> gates

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:43.570 
down onto the lower river yeah the gates

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:45.060 
down onto the lower river yeah the gates
can<00:04:43.720> then<00:04:43.840> lift<00:04:44.080> up<00:04:44.230> and<00:04:44.380> we<00:04:44.470> can<00:04:44.590> sail<00:04:44.770> out<00:04:44.950> and

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:45.070 
can then lift up and we can sail out and

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:46.380 
can then lift up and we can sail out and
get<00:04:45.160> on<00:04:45.250> with<00:04:45.370> our<00:04:45.430> journey<00:04:45.730> a<00:04:45.880> nice<00:04:46.120> smooth

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:46.390 
get on with our journey a nice smooth

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:57.190 
get on with our journey a nice smooth
