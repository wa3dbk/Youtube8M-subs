00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:07.209
 endodontic therapy is a 

00:00:04.779 --> 00:00:08.980
 excellent common treatment and a nerve 

00:00:07.209 --> 00:00:11.530
 on your tooth that damages by any 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:13.750
 reason contrary to common opinion 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:16.270
 Endodontic therapy does not have to be 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:18.730
 an uncomfortable experience the causes of 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:21.579
 nerve damage include caries a 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:23.290
 broken tooth a big covered the 

00:00:21.579 --> 00:00:25.680
 Preparation of the crown near the 

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:28.230
 nerve or trauma 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.300
 once the nerve can not heal the 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.490
 endodontics may be the only option of 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.170
 treatment available to avoid 

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:36.150
 tooth extraction 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.250
 once you read me the bacteria dies 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:40.500
 can infect the channels within the 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.020
 tooth that the nerve occupies bacterium 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.140
 multiplied can overflow the channels 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.540
 his body fights the invasion this battle 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.670
 lowercase can cause many deaths of 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:53.340
 the cell that can result in the 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.590
 formation of an abscess the death of a 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.690
 nerve and the accumulation of pressure in 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.239
 the abscess can lead to pain 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:03.329
 can push the tooth legally from 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.100
 its position for this reason the patients 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.550
 they complain often that the tooth 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.530
 painful is the only tooth that touches the 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:13.259
 body can not clean the bacteria from 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.540
 the channels of the rai is by itself the 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:18.149
 endodontic therapy thoroughly cleans the 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:21.030
 channels of irritant bacteria using a 

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:22.950
 instrument for cleaning then 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.380
 the channels are filled with a material of 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.130
 sealing and a temporary cap is placed 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.130
 over the tooth 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:33.680
 once the cleaning has been done and 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:37.040
 the infected area covered healthy 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:39.110
 usually quickly 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.660
 however there may be a certain 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:44.930
 bother for a few days before 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:47.720
 the area feels more normal the step 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:50.420
 next is to permanently repair the 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:54.080
 tooth replacing the temporary cap 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:56.360
 by a permanent called a base to the 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.640
 conclude this procedure can be 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:02.950
 necessary to install the posts in the 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.950
 channels to help consolidate the base 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:11.030
 finally a crown covers the area 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:13.930
 whole to provide a cover 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:17.019
 protective for the tooth 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:19.989
 The final steps of the repair should 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:22.060
 be finished but a treated tooth 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:24.819
 only with endodontics can 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:28.530
 need to be removed due to tooth decay 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:28.530
 recurrent or a fracture 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:34.250
 endodontic therapy can save a 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:37.550
 tooth that would otherwise have to be 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:39.830
 extracted although often the cost is 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:41.600
 endodontic therapy will cost less 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:44.300
 in the long term that the treatments 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.700
 available to replace a tooth 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:49.550
 lost when the endodontic therapy 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.860
 is successful and all the 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:54.230
 repairs that are necessary a 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:58.540
 tooth treated with an endodontics can 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.540
 provide many years of service
