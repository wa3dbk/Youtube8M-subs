00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:10.950
 the municipality seats in aguascalientes 

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:13.590
 it is a semi-arid land dedicated in 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.840
 much of the bean crop are 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:19.500
 temporary lands are lands that 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:21.269
 they need a lot of work here we met 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.089
 a group of peasants who have a 

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:27.119
 agricultural project and maybe inadvertently 

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:30.300
 they gave us a lesson to change 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:34.560
 always the hardest thing is to give the first 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:37.890
 step in the seats municipality 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:40.290
 that is the municipality where it is sown 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.380
 has the first place in production 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.210
 of beans under temporary conditions 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:48.690
 On average they are sown annually 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:53.210
 little more than 4,000 hectares 4 thousand 200 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.210
 hectares under temporary conditions 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:59.600
 the yields are very low by 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.140
 question of especially for the lack 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:05.090
 of rain 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:08.050
 yields are obtained on average 

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:10.770
 250 kilos per hectare 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:12.719
 is that it is very very low 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.950
 as soon as it reaches for 

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:16.899
 subsistence needs of d 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.090
 of the families that live here in 

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:20.799
 our region in this case here in this 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:24.429
 plot we have the variety pinto 

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:27.329
 saltillo that has a lot of acceptance 

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:27.329
 in the market 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:33.000
 It is very easy to cook 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.180
 and it's very similar to varieties 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.570
 Peruvian 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:41.900
 then it is the one that is being proposed and 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:44.480
 under the three-row system how 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:46.190
 we can appreciate here that allows us 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:48.580
 increase the density of plants 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:52.400
 project and traditionally 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:54.920
 They plant around 70 thousand plants per 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:58.119
 hectares to a row and with this 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:02.060
 system we increase it up to double 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:04.550
 140 150 thousand plants per hectare here 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:07.380
 formed a group of 12 producers of 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:09.840
 Drivers here ejido 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.440
 they have participated they had already 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:15.599
 participated in previous years in 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:18.120
 Demonstration events and themselves 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:21.420
 came out the concern requested the support 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:25.500
 so that in your community you try 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:27.150
 this this system then they with 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:31.140
 initiative of them have been formed 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:36.620
 as a group and intend to formalize their 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:40.069
 register that is a more formal society 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:44.930
 and we hope we are supporting it 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:48.650
 so that it is the beginning of a growth of 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:50.030
 this organization to more producers and 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.610
 see the possibility of constituting 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:55.459
 a bean product system here in the 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:57.950
 state that until now no no no no 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:00.540
 exists here in aguascalientes and has 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:03.569
 many expectations of 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:06.390
 that succeed is a future very 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:10.879
 challenging as the partner says 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:14.609
 Jesus the increasingly complex things 

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:16.830
 we have to open up to new ways of 

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:20.490
 do things 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:22.200
 this project the staff of 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:25.030
 Sagarpa offered it to the 112 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:27.310
 ejidatarios of pilots 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.270
 and always and many more who visited us 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:31.370
 from other communities 

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:37.630
 but among things not believe 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:40.750
 new the fear is distrusted 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:43.690
 it says if we've been doing it for 100 years 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:45.430
 in this or that way there is no other 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:47.380
 but it does not rain us the same as we 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.270
 that time does not cost us the 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:51.220
 things the same thing that cost us in that 

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:54.070
 time we have to open up to 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:57.430
 change to new ways of working 

00:03:54.070 --> 00:04:00.310
 I have a lot of faith and I think that time 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:03.550
 it's good but you have to work and there's 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:08.530
 that know how to work and I do not distrust 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:10.630
 Mother Nature's, I think that 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.760
 all these droughts and all this from 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:16.000
 previous years they told us our 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:19.720
 grandparents who came so now we do not 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:22.270
 we miss for that but we're going to work 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.730
 with new techniques and let's go out 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:26.500
 forward I'm sure yes with
