00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
cut the end off but just a little bit

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:28.960 
cut the end off but just a little bit
thicker<00:02:27.830> because<00:02:28.069> you<00:02:28.310> still<00:02:28.550> want<00:02:28.730> to<00:02:28.790> keep

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
thicker because you still want to keep

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:34.660 
thicker because you still want to keep
the<00:02:29.030> shape<00:02:29.450> so<00:02:29.840> just<00:02:30.110> about<00:02:33.100> that<00:02:34.100> much<00:02:34.370> there

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
the shape so just about that much there

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:42.729 
the shape so just about that much there
and<00:02:40.209> then<00:02:41.209> just<00:02:41.450> do<00:02:41.569> the<00:02:41.600> same<00:02:41.900> thing<00:02:41.959> with<00:02:42.560> the

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:42.739 
and then just do the same thing with the

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:48.699 
and then just do the same thing with the
other<00:02:42.860> side<00:02:46.540> I'm<00:02:47.540> just<00:02:47.750> gonna<00:02:47.930> slide<00:02:48.350> that

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
other side I'm just gonna slide that

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:51.940 
other side I'm just gonna slide that
piece<00:02:49.100> in<00:02:49.400> right<00:02:49.730> there<00:02:50.140> so<00:02:51.140> it<00:02:51.260> kind<00:02:51.500> of<00:02:51.560> fits

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
piece in right there so it kind of fits

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.120 
piece in right there so it kind of fits
like<00:02:52.130> a<00:02:52.190> puzzle<00:02:52.760> piece<00:02:53.620> so<00:02:54.620> there<00:02:54.769> we've<00:02:54.950> got

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
like a puzzle piece so there we've got

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.340 
like a puzzle piece so there we've got
our<00:02:55.340> spider's<00:02:55.819> eyes<00:02:56.090> and<00:02:56.840> then<00:02:56.989> all<00:02:57.170> we<00:02:57.319> have

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350 
our spider's eyes and then all we have

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:00.850 
our spider's eyes and then all we have
to<00:02:57.530> do<00:02:57.830> is<00:02:58.040> just<00:02:58.280> stick<00:02:58.489> in<00:02:58.730> the<00:02:59.239> legs<00:02:59.510> so<00:02:59.930> we're

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
to do is just stick in the legs so we're

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:14.040 
to do is just stick in the legs so we're
going<00:03:00.980> to<00:03:01.069> put<00:03:01.280> four<00:03:03.010> legs<00:03:04.209> on<00:03:05.209> each<00:03:06.110> side

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:14.050 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:15.680

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.290 
you
all<00:03:16.260> right<00:03:16.500> and<00:03:16.740> that's<00:03:16.980> how<00:03:17.310> your<00:03:17.880> spider

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.300 
all right and that's how your spider

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:22.190 
all right and that's how your spider
looks<00:03:18.780> once<00:03:19.260> you're<00:03:19.530> all<00:03:19.800> done<00:03:20.870> so<00:03:21.870> you<00:03:21.930> can

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
looks once you're all done so you can

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.950 
looks once you're all done so you can
see<00:03:22.410> some<00:03:22.710> of<00:03:22.740> the<00:03:22.920> brown<00:03:23.390> icing<00:03:24.390> still<00:03:24.660> poking

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:26.420 
see some of the brown icing still poking
through<00:03:25.290> I<00:03:25.380> just<00:03:25.500> think<00:03:25.920> that<00:03:26.010> that<00:03:26.190> looks
