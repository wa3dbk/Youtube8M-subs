 not having a consistent race and who

 arrives misplaced when the hatch 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.470
 insisted on warming up the bottom of the

 my money tennis confess game without racket 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.790
 place yourself to the meaning on the bottom line 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.739
 short 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.870
 eight balls are located in front of you 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.640
 the goal is to put them on the 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.649
 sieve the two rackets located at 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.960
 outside the corridors alternately 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.850
 side forehand then robert side in 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.950
 wait position be dynamic on 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.840
 tiptoe physical and a 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.940
 ball more eager crowds and fast 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.250
 move towards the goal by placing 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.719
 the ball on the sieve of the racket 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.550
 slow down your stride 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.410
 closer to the goal 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.120
 your replacement is facing the net 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.159
 have not hunted or not crossed 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.020
 also on a fast pace 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.060
 realize that racing 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.439
 tennis are often split up and 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.220
 requires a large capacity 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.220
 acceleration 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.869
 you will simulate a chapman your 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.229
 partner sends you alternately or 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.909
 valve right side then robert side 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:25.439
 the sole purpose of this exercise and of 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.049
 feel the strong at the moment of 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.210
 crowd start is very fast and the 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.700
 deceleration by decreasing the stride to 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.530
 the arrival I do not insist on 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.860
 cross supports or strangers in a shot 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.210
 law 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.090
 because this is not the goal of 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.439
 exercise the effort is intense if the 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.920
 exercise practice and be 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.920
 correctly 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:47.979
 now your partner is sending you 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:50.689
 bullets by hand randomly 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:52.430
 insisted on relief and recovery 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:54.380
 China because it will allow you 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:57.560
 to be responsive and to guide your 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.600
 race in the good sense pampered flexible and 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.759
 released in your move and in 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.990
 your replacements 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:05.210
 it is obvious that the ranking in 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:14.000
 little strides the possible that if 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:15.769
 we have time to play with rackets 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.140
 you will alternate a strike 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:19.550
 right then a typing at robert 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.290
 the goal is to mark a time 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.540
 stop after the keystroke is to observe 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.200
 you enjoyed it for two seconds at 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.970
 moment of the strike 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.430
 I want you to be stable and the 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.200
 feet anchored to the ground sending the balls 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.810
 by your partner must be good 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.250
 quality far enough for you 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.230
 force to crowds and fast to 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.930
 start helped no adjustments on the 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.950
 end if you're still moving to 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.840
 moment of the strike 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.970
 it means that your race has not 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.590
 been pretty fast or you do not 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.220
 adjustment have not been sufficient 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.680
 specific 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:52.209
