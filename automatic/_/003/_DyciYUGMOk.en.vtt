we are the mobile Drive manufacturer we

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:20.490 
we are the mobile Drive manufacturer we
do<00:00:19.030> manufacture<00:00:19.300> we<00:00:19.780> will<00:00:19.930> drive<00:00:20.140> chair<00:00:20.410> as

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:20.500 
do manufacture we will drive chair as

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.680 
do manufacture we will drive chair as
well<00:00:20.740> of<00:00:21.010> the<00:00:21.490> biggest<00:00:22.090> extent<00:00:22.360> of<00:00:22.420> our<00:00:22.510> line

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:22.690 
well of the biggest extent of our line

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:24.240 
well of the biggest extent of our line
is<00:00:22.720> maybe<00:00:23.080> wheel<00:00:23.200> drive<00:00:23.470> because<00:00:23.680> we<00:00:23.920> see<00:00:24.100> that

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:24.250 
is maybe wheel drive because we see that

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:26.970 
is maybe wheel drive because we see that
the<00:00:24.580> major<00:00:24.760> benefits<00:00:25.270> for<00:00:25.450> turning<00:00:25.750> radius<00:00:26.110> as

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:26.980 
the major benefits for turning radius as

the major benefits for turning radius as
mid-wheel<00:00:27.340> drive<00:00:27.370> is<00:00:27.730> the<00:00:27.880> tightest<00:00:28.240> turning

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:28.540 
mid-wheel drive is the tightest turning

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:30.930 
mid-wheel drive is the tightest turning
radius<00:00:28.870> that's<00:00:29.710> available<00:00:30.190> to<00:00:30.550> do<00:00:30.640> that<00:00:30.760> drive

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
because there really is no such thing as

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:43.980 
because there really is no such thing as
zero<00:01:42.220> shear<00:01:42.580> because<00:01:43.210> everybody<00:01:43.689> shares

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
zero shear because everybody shares

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:45.810 
zero shear because everybody shares
somewhat<00:01:44.470> but<00:01:44.860> yeah<00:01:45.010> we<00:01:45.189> have<00:01:45.369> in<00:01:45.520> the<00:01:45.610> shear

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:45.820 
somewhat but yeah we have in the shear

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.190 
somewhat but yeah we have in the shear

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
adjustment in width and in depth so even

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.809 
adjustment in width and in depth so even
when<00:02:07.119> they<00:02:07.210> order<00:02:07.479> a<00:02:07.509> fixed<00:02:07.900> depth<00:02:08.110> package

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
when they order a fixed depth package

when they order a fixed depth package
per<00:02:09.819> fixed<00:02:10.119> depth<00:02:10.359> in<00:02:10.779> length<00:02:11.139> we<00:02:11.529> can

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
per fixed depth in length we can

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.619 
per fixed depth in length we can
actually<00:02:11.859> change<00:02:12.849> that<00:02:13.120> and<00:02:13.299> they<00:02:13.359> get<00:02:13.540> they

00:02:13.619 --> 00:02:13.629 
actually change that and they get they

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:14.550 
actually change that and they get they
get<00:02:13.749> an<00:02:14.079> option<00:02:14.379> so

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
get an option so

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.320 
get an option so
the<00:02:14.650> order<00:02:14.920> an<00:02:14.980> 18<00:02:15.340> deep<00:02:15.580> there's<00:02:15.940> actually<00:02:16.300> a

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
the order an 18 deep there's actually a

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.750 
the order an 18 deep there's actually a

adjustment this slide track also allows

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.780 
adjustment this slide track also allows
us<00:02:22.510> to<00:02:22.630> actually<00:02:22.750> move<00:02:23.230> or<00:02:23.500> or<00:02:23.860> dial<00:02:24.130> in<00:02:24.370> you

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
us to actually move or or dial in you

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.339 
us to actually move or or dial in you
know<00:02:24.910> very<00:02:25.150> precisely<00:02:25.209> the<00:02:25.900> angle<00:02:26.170> of<00:02:26.260> our

00:02:26.339 --> 00:02:26.349 
know very precisely the angle of our

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:28.050 
know very precisely the angle of our
armrests<00:02:26.830> so<00:02:26.950> we<00:02:27.040> can<00:02:27.190> loosen<00:02:27.489> up<00:02:27.580> bolts<00:02:27.910> and

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
armrests so we can loosen up bolts and

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.030 
armrests so we can loosen up bolts and
slide<00:02:28.510> things<00:02:28.870> around<00:02:29.140> and<00:02:29.319> really<00:02:29.709> lock<00:02:29.890> it

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
slide things around and really lock it

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.410 
slide things around and really lock it
into<00:02:30.160> exactly<00:02:30.550> what's<00:02:30.790> going<00:02:30.910> to<00:02:30.940> be<00:02:31.060> best<00:02:31.269> for

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
into exactly what's going to be best for

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.300 
into exactly what's going to be best for
the<00:02:31.510> client<00:02:31.720> the<00:02:32.349> armrests<00:02:32.769> themselves

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
the client the armrests themselves

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.400 
the client the armrests themselves
actually<00:02:34.090> are<00:02:34.269> simple<00:02:34.630> release<00:02:34.870> lever<00:02:35.170> and

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
actually are simple release lever and

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.140 
actually are simple release lever and
they<00:02:35.530> flip<00:02:35.769> back<00:02:35.950> out<00:02:36.130> of<00:02:36.160> the<00:02:36.310> way<00:02:36.459> and<00:02:36.730> they

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
they flip back out of the way and they

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:38.490 
they flip back out of the way and they
try<00:02:37.330> to<00:02:37.390> stay<00:02:37.599> fairly<00:02:37.810> flush<00:02:38.200> with<00:02:38.410> the

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
try to stay fairly flush with the

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:39.870 
try to stay fairly flush with the
backrest<00:02:38.890> so<00:02:39.130> there's<00:02:39.310> nothing<00:02:39.459> going<00:02:39.730> to<00:02:39.790> be

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
backrest so there's nothing going to be

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.490 
backrest so there's nothing going to be
scratching<00:02:40.660> if<00:02:40.750> people<00:02:40.959> are<00:02:41.050> doing<00:02:41.260> lateral

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
scratching if people are doing lateral

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.589 
scratching if people are doing lateral
transfers<00:02:42.040> in<00:02:42.519> and<00:02:42.760> out<00:02:42.819> of<00:02:42.970> the<00:02:43.030> chair<00:02:43.269> if

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
that still is in the way it's a push

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.690 
that still is in the way it's a push
button<00:02:46.780> and<00:02:46.870> release<00:02:47.350> and<00:02:47.680> the<00:02:48.130> armrest<00:02:48.370> pops

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
button and release and the armrest pops

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.400 
button and release and the armrest pops
all<00:02:48.850> the<00:02:48.970> way<00:02:49.060> off<00:02:49.209> and<00:02:49.540> it's<00:02:49.720> very<00:02:49.930> light

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
all the way off and it's very light

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.410 
all the way off and it's very light
we<00:02:50.470> also<00:02:50.620> have<00:02:50.799> our<00:02:51.400> murse<00:02:51.640> adjustment<00:02:52.120> here

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
we also have our murse adjustment here

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:53.910 
we also have our murse adjustment here
and<00:02:52.600> we<00:02:53.019> try<00:02:53.170> to<00:02:53.230> use<00:02:53.350> the<00:02:53.470> slide<00:02:53.680> tracks

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
and we try to use the slide tracks

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.229 
and we try to use the slide tracks
wherever<00:02:54.190> we<00:02:54.280> can<00:02:54.489> so<00:02:54.610> we're<00:02:54.700> using<00:02:54.850> them<00:02:55.030> here

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:55.239 
wherever we can so we're using them here

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:56.610 
wherever we can so we're using them here
as<00:02:55.330> well<00:02:55.540> so<00:02:55.690> it<00:02:55.810> actually<00:02:56.049> provides<00:02:56.410> you

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
as well so it actually provides you

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.350 
as well so it actually provides you
instead<00:02:56.890> of<00:02:56.950> every<00:02:57.580> inch<00:02:57.760> or<00:02:57.970> half-inch

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
instead of every inch or half-inch

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.330 
instead of every inch or half-inch
increments<00:02:58.810> to<00:02:59.349> the<00:02:59.709> position<00:03:00.040> and<00:03:00.130> armrests

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
increments to the position and armrests

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.280 
increments to the position and armrests
really<00:03:01.180> it<00:03:01.390> provides<00:03:01.660> you<00:03:01.810> kind<00:03:02.049> of<00:03:02.110> infinite

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
really it provides you kind of infinite

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.229 
really it provides you kind of infinite
adjustability<00:03:02.830> up<00:03:03.130> and<00:03:03.310> down<00:03:03.459> that<00:03:03.700> which

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239 
adjustability up and down that which

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:05.910 
adjustability up and down that which
provides<00:03:04.599> more<00:03:05.170> just<00:03:05.349> ability<00:03:05.530> for<00:03:05.739> height

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
provides more just ability for height

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.740 
provides more just ability for height
but<00:03:05.950> not<00:03:06.489> just<00:03:06.730> height<00:03:06.880> but<00:03:07.150> for<00:03:07.299> angle<00:03:07.660> which

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
but not just height but for angle which

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.479 
but not just height but for angle which
can<00:03:07.900> play<00:03:08.049> a<00:03:08.080> pivotal<00:03:08.349> role<00:03:08.530> too<00:03:08.799> and<00:03:08.980> people

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:09.489 
can play a pivotal role too and people

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:10.890 
can play a pivotal role too and people
still<00:03:09.640> accessing<00:03:10.060> their<00:03:10.299> armrests<00:03:10.660> and<00:03:10.810> their

the the seat rails and the adjustments
for<00:03:14.980> the<00:03:15.040> armrests<00:03:15.459> we<00:03:15.580> try<00:03:15.760> to<00:03:15.819> stick<00:03:16.510> with

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
for the armrests we try to stick with

these slide tracks for a lot of our
adjustability<00:03:18.970> it<00:03:19.180> just<00:03:19.359> provides<00:03:19.660> ease<00:03:20.019> and

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
adjustability it just provides ease and

with<00:04:13.540> the<00:04:13.720> tilt<00:04:13.930> mechanism<00:04:14.049> we<00:04:15.040> still<00:04:15.310> get<00:04:15.519> a

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:15.549 
with the tilt mechanism we still get a

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:18.120 
with the tilt mechanism we still get a

over the wheelchair here a few inches
you'll<00:04:26.979> see<00:04:27.099> it<00:04:27.190> shift

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970 
you'll see it shift

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:29.280 
you'll see it shift
I'm<00:04:28.180> just<00:04:28.420> trying<00:04:28.600> to<00:04:28.690> keep<00:04:28.810> it<00:04:28.960> over<00:04:29.200> the

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:29.290 
I'm just trying to keep it over the

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:30.780 
I'm just trying to keep it over the
center<00:04:29.560> of<00:04:29.590> the<00:04:29.680> wheelchair<00:04:30.070> getting<00:04:30.460> a<00:04:30.520> more

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:30.790 
center of the wheelchair getting a more

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:33.000 
center of the wheelchair getting a more
stable<00:04:30.940> base<00:04:31.120> of<00:04:31.450> support<00:04:31.810> that<00:04:32.530> allows<00:04:32.680> us<00:04:32.830> to

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.010 
stable base of support that allows us to

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:34.680 
stable base of support that allows us to
get<00:04:33.280> farther<00:04:33.550> and<00:04:33.670> farther<00:04:33.910> back<00:04:34.210> providing

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:34.690 
get farther and farther back providing

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:37.470 
get farther and farther back providing
you<00:04:34.750> still<00:04:34.960> 50<00:04:35.290> degree<00:04:35.760> fit<00:04:36.760> series<00:04:37.060> of<00:04:37.180> tilts

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:37.480 
you still 50 degree fit series of tilts

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.960 
you still 50 degree fit series of tilts
so<00:04:38.470> with<00:04:38.620> the<00:04:38.770> true<00:04:38.920> balance<00:04:39.070> lift<00:04:39.460> and<00:04:39.700> tilt

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:39.970 
so with the true balance lift and tilt

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:42.360 
so with the true balance lift and tilt
system<00:04:40.420> it<00:04:40.930> actually<00:04:40.960> combines<00:04:41.470> this<00:04:42.010> 10<00:04:42.250> inch

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:42.370

a dual actuator to motor system and

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:51.240 
a dual actuator to motor system and
you'll<00:04:49.360> see<00:04:49.540> the<00:04:49.720> 10<00:04:50.320> inches<00:04:50.590> of<00:04:50.740> elevation

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:51.250 
you'll see the 10 inches of elevation

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:53.460 
you'll see the 10 inches of elevation
why<00:04:51.940> 10<00:04:52.240> inches<00:04:52.480> and<00:04:52.630> why<00:04:52.720> this<00:04:52.780> is<00:04:53.050> such<00:04:53.200> a<00:04:53.230> big

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:53.470 
why 10 inches and why this is such a big

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:54.900 
why 10 inches and why this is such a big
deal<00:04:53.590> is<00:04:53.770> because<00:04:53.890> 10<00:04:54.130> inches<00:04:54.370> gives<00:04:54.550> us<00:04:54.700> more

know<00:06:21.940> we<00:06:22.120> come<00:06:22.300> up<00:06:22.450> with<00:06:22.660> with<00:06:23.590> an<00:06:23.710> idea<00:06:24.010> but<00:06:24.340> we

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:24.490 
know we come up with with an idea but we

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:25.740 
know we come up with with an idea but we
did<00:06:24.729> cover<00:06:24.880> that<00:06:25.060> we<00:06:25.180> actually<00:06:25.360> got<00:06:25.600> it<00:06:25.720> from

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:25.750 
did cover that we actually got it from

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:27.870 
did cover that we actually got it from
consumer<00:06:26.260> feedback<00:06:26.470> so<00:06:26.950> we<00:06:27.460> do<00:06:27.580> a<00:06:27.610> lot<00:06:27.790> of

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:27.880 
consumer feedback so we do a lot of

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:29.610 
consumer feedback so we do a lot of

00:06:31.469 --> 00:06:31.479 
clinician focus groups we actually do

00:06:31.479 --> 00:06:32.969

service tech focus groups as well to

00:06:32.979 --> 00:06:34.500 
service tech focus groups as well to
tell<00:06:33.160> us<00:06:33.250> how<00:06:33.669> to<00:06:33.700> make<00:06:33.790> our<00:06:34.000> chairs<00:06:34.180> easier<00:06:34.419> to
