makes the colors look cool just for your
board<00:02:48.990> I<00:02:49.260> actually<00:02:49.740> find<00:02:50.100> that<00:02:50.220> tip<00:02:50.490> that

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
board I actually find that tip that

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.850 
board I actually find that tip that
feature<00:02:51.570> useful<00:02:52.080> when<00:02:52.170> I'm<00:02:52.260> in<00:02:52.350> Photoshop

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
feature useful when I'm in Photoshop

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.310 
feature useful when I'm in Photoshop
because<00:02:53.160> I'm<00:02:53.400> erasing<00:02:53.700> or<00:02:54.660> painting<00:02:55.080> two

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
because I'm erasing or painting two

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:56.990 
because I'm erasing or painting two
different<00:02:55.620> shades<00:02:55.770> of<00:02:55.950> white<00:02:56.190> it's<00:02:56.550> easier<00:02:56.850> to

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
different shades of white it's easier to

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.699 
different shades of white it's easier to
see<00:02:57.420> two<00:02:57.570> different<00:02:57.690> shades<00:02:58.080> of<00:02:58.170> black<00:02:58.380> and

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
see two different shades of black and

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:00.500 
see two different shades of black and
just<00:02:58.860> see<00:02:59.400> two<00:02:59.610> different<00:02:59.790> shades<00:03:00.120> of<00:03:00.330> light

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
just see two different shades of light

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.520 
just see two different shades of light
so<00:03:00.840> that<00:03:00.870> makes<00:03:01.260> it<00:03:01.380> useful<00:03:01.590> for<00:03:01.830> that<00:03:03.530> the

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
so that makes it useful for that the

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.050 
so that makes it useful for that the
next<00:03:04.800> step<00:03:04.890> I<00:03:05.010> assure<00:03:05.280> you<00:03:05.310> guys<00:03:05.459> is<00:03:05.700> how<00:03:05.820> to<00:03:05.910> do

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
next step I assure you guys is how to do

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.520 
next step I assure you guys is how to do
the<00:03:06.180> opposite<00:03:06.600> of<00:03:06.690> where<00:03:06.900> whatever<00:03:07.140> your<00:03:07.320> doc

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530

is<00:03:07.800> so<00:03:07.980> what<00:03:08.100> I<00:03:08.130> mean<00:03:08.340> by<00:03:08.520> that<00:03:08.550> is<00:03:08.910> if<00:03:09.570> your<00:03:09.720> dog

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
is so what I mean by that is if your dog

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.350 
is so what I mean by that is if your dog
stop<00:03:10.110> magnified<00:03:10.650> you<00:03:10.920> can<00:03:11.070> hold<00:03:11.330> ctrl<00:03:12.330> shift

stop magnified you can hold ctrl shift

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.670 
stop magnified you can hold ctrl shift
and<00:03:12.930> it<00:03:13.170> will<00:03:13.290> magnify<00:03:13.590> your<00:03:13.800> doc<00:03:15.500> so<00:03:16.500> you<00:03:16.590> can

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
and it will magnify your doc so you can

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.410 
and it will magnify your doc so you can
