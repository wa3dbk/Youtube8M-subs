 the in the universe of the planet 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:30.789
 to make people dream 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:34.240

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:35.970
 to talk about chocolate 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.960
 to smell the chocolate from includes chocolate 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.740

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:45.960
 look at a chocolate 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.380
 so that was the key to the great technical difficulty for it's 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:52.870
 to go in any case to try to bring the the techno to the lap where the person 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:53.790
 who is watching site 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:56.309
 well it was to make him understand that camping 2 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.430
 he began to have a praline we try to describe it as best we can 

00:01:00.429 --> 00:01:03.569
 try to make understand all the flavors that I can have I take a 

00:01:03.569 --> 00:01:08.500
 example at random if I take a duck and well when we look at the praline 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.970
 canaries we realize that actually we will see an element of 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.090
 feuillantine place and anti do not know what 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.290
 it's character lace mix with a little after midnight 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.230
 thick in this disappointment there must be that the person understands 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:25.540
 man we want to combes the year in our universe and that it is the 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.680
 sin of greed is the rendezvous when we look not that 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.730
 an acquired currently in cold than yesterday this screen 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:36.830
 and by the picture game speak the allele the word but the word the fairest 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.260
 possible to describe 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:40.530
 m this premium 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.550
 well we try to make you dream that's really the idea of 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:43.979
 based 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.340
 it's taking your hand 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.890
 and drive you a little bit in the harsh winter at once that of 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:49.600
 chocolate 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.870
 both that of biscuit making with materials 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:54.860
 both that of pastry 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.420
 you open the doors of our workshop is also open a little bit 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.719
 better 

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:01.559
 the way we work philosophy in which we are not 

00:02:01.559 --> 00:02:05.059
 to understand also that when we are the only ones from the cocoa bean 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.780
 percent through travels as thick that's what we are trying to do 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.780
 on this site by bringing you so far 

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:21.709
 you 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:25.189
 furthermore, knowing how to get into your universe makes 

00:02:25.189 --> 00:02:26.750
 understand what we do 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.159
 he worked very hard with you 

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:32.709
 we give you information so once it will be training especially 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:33.790
 the history of the house 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.269
 everything we do 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:37.089
 how long have they been soft 

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:40.659
 where do we come from I think that kind of question can we ask ourselves how 

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:44.769
 we have evolved how eric to make us discover both our 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:47.769
 passion our commitment then caught the chocolate world 

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:56.599
 the third heading the third small square ce buy 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:59.869
 it is obvious that when one wanted to pass to extend 

00:02:59.869 --> 00:03:03.009
 by this moment of this moment of magic you have been discovered in our shops 

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:05.970
 once seduced his will be made of tokyo 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.440
 it's a given moment of the wise governor to continue his dream however 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.049
 not been simple I think when we do a shop 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:15.739
 when we say ok we want to send toxo chocolates in the south of France 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:18.229
 or in the north of belgium where lives in england or 

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:22.849
 elsewhere this first parade tct 2 master the cold because 300 105 

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:26.140
 days it's not temperatures that are however the blame for doing the 

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:26.590
 things 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:27.640
 the second thing 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.990
 his debts we have an appointment the same emotion that you discovered at the 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:33.470
 when you bought these chocolates in a shop and you 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:36.870
 are going to have the same thing in the shops sequence of his chocolates that 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.099
 must surprise you there is the third thing had been done saying basically 

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:41.879
 is it today 

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:45.029
 we want to compose there are things if we brought things we do not like 

00:03:45.029 --> 00:03:47.949
 something that we can only prefer we also want that the 

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:51.409
 presentation is different we want to customize this presentation and 

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:54.959
 so it's true that it's been a long time since we talked in the marconi house 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:58.229
 to do insiteo could not buy chocolate for the year of time 

00:03:58.229 --> 00:04:01.699
 but a lot of time to be able to free abbas 

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:03.319
 to deliver 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:07.469
 want to share creativity you can start to compose your boxes 

00:04:07.469 --> 00:04:11.789
 the way you want you can customize to add a word and 

00:04:11.789 --> 00:04:15.459
 and especially this return to let find partners that allowed 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:18.459
 at some point to deliver in good conditions 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:20.969
 shops 

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:24.089
