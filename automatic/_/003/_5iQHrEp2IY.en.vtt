importance on kill death ratio because

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.690 
importance on kill death ratio because
there<00:00:34.320> are<00:00:34.469> things<00:00:34.739> that<00:00:34.860> are<00:00:35.010> more<00:00:35.190> important

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700

I<00:00:35.730> mean<00:00:35.880> think<00:00:36.360> about<00:00:36.420> this<00:00:36.780> do<00:00:37.260> you<00:00:37.320> know<00:00:37.410> what

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
I mean think about this do you know what

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.500 
I mean think about this do you know what
my<00:00:37.680> kill<00:00:37.920> death<00:00:38.100> ratio<00:00:38.219> is<00:00:38.670> in<00:00:38.820> black<00:00:39.000> ops<00:00:39.239> 2

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
my kill death ratio is in black ops 2

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.450 
my kill death ratio is in black ops 2
well<00:00:40.350> it<00:00:40.410> doesn't<00:00:40.590> really<00:00:40.739> matter<00:00:40.980> what<00:00:41.340> my

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
well it doesn't really matter what my

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.220 
well it doesn't really matter what my
kill<00:00:41.670> death<00:00:41.850> ratio<00:00:41.940> is<00:00:42.329> in<00:00:42.540> black<00:00:42.719> ops<00:00:42.960> 2<00:00:43.200> so

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
kill death ratio is in black ops 2 so

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.049 
kill death ratio is in black ops 2 so
you<00:00:43.860> know<00:00:43.950> my<00:00:44.100> point<00:00:44.280> is<00:00:44.460> don't<00:00:44.789> get<00:00:45.000> too

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.580 
showing you right here I would recommend
something<00:00:56.610> similar<00:00:57.270> to<00:00:57.449> this<00:00:57.660> if<00:00:57.930> you're<00:00:58.320> just

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
something similar to this if you're just

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.740 
something similar to this if you're just
starting<00:00:58.890> out<00:00:59.280> so<00:00:59.309> maybe<00:00:59.879> the<00:01:00.120> SATCOM

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
starting out so maybe the SATCOM

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.680 
starting out so maybe the SATCOM
the<00:01:01.379> IMS<00:01:02.039> that's<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.550> intelligent<00:01:03.180> munition

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
the IMS that's the intelligent munition

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.630 
the IMS that's the intelligent munition
systems<00:01:04.140> when<00:01:04.350> somebody<00:01:04.710> runs<00:01:04.949> by<00:01:05.159> that<00:01:05.430> thing

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
systems when somebody runs by that thing

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.090 
systems when somebody runs by that thing
it's<00:01:06.119> gonna<00:01:06.330> throw<00:01:06.900> out<00:01:07.170> this<00:01:07.439> explosion

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
it's gonna throw out this explosion

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.490 
it's gonna throw out this explosion
thing<00:01:08.580> and<00:01:08.880> kill<00:01:09.180> somebody<00:01:09.420> and<00:01:09.780> then<00:01:10.140> I<00:01:10.170> also

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
thing and kill somebody and then I also

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.859 
thing and kill somebody and then I also
have<00:01:10.740> a<00:01:10.770> sentry<00:01:11.310> gun<00:01:11.520> now<00:01:12.030> why<00:01:12.450> am<00:01:12.600> i<00:01:12.659> picking

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
have a sentry gun now why am i picking

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.539 
have a sentry gun now why am i picking
those<00:01:13.110> things<00:01:13.380> these<00:01:13.710> things<00:01:13.979> are<00:01:14.159> really

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
those things these things are really

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.999 
those things these things are really
good<00:01:14.909> for<00:01:15.240> playing<00:01:15.450> domination<00:01:16.380> you<00:01:16.409> can<00:01:16.740> put

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
good for playing domination you can put

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.700 
good for playing domination you can put
the<00:01:17.189> IMS<00:01:17.700> by<00:01:17.909> a<00:01:17.939> flag<00:01:18.360> you<00:01:18.869> put<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.290> sentry<00:01:19.680> gun

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
the IMS by a flag you put the sentry gun

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.679 
the IMS by a flag you put the sentry gun
by<00:01:20.130> a<00:01:20.159> flag<00:01:20.520> and<00:01:20.820> they<00:01:21.119> just<00:01:21.299> come<00:01:21.450> in<00:01:21.479> handy

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
by a flag and they just come in handy

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.660 
by a flag and they just come in handy
they're<00:01:21.990> low<00:01:22.290> kill<00:01:22.619> streaks<00:01:22.979> so<00:01:23.430> they're

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
they're low kill streaks so they're

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.310 
they're low kill streaks so they're
easier<00:01:24.119> to<00:01:24.210> pull<00:01:24.600> off<00:01:24.750> so<00:01:25.020> that's<00:01:25.110> why<00:01:25.290> I

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
easier to pull off so that's why I

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.710 
easier to pull off so that's why I
recommended<00:01:25.979> especially<00:01:26.299> when<00:01:27.299> you're<00:01:27.450> first

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
recommended especially when you're first

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.539 
recommended especially when you're first
starting<00:01:28.259> out<00:01:28.290> so<00:01:28.770> you<00:01:28.860> see<00:01:29.040> me<00:01:29.189> pull<00:01:29.400> these

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
starting out so you see me pull these

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.370 
starting out so you see me pull these
off<00:01:29.610> right<00:01:30.030> here<00:01:30.270> I<00:01:30.420> want<00:01:30.840> to<00:01:30.930> show<00:01:31.079> you<00:01:31.140> one

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
off right here I want to show you one

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.590 
off right here I want to show you one
more<00:01:31.409> thing<00:01:31.640> see<00:01:32.640> that<00:01:32.820> glowing<00:01:33.119> thing<00:01:33.240> right

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
there now I am running sitrep I don't

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:36.859 
there now I am running sitrep I don't
know<00:01:35.700> if<00:01:35.790> I'd<00:01:35.909> really<00:01:36.210> recommend<00:01:36.390> running

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
know if I'd really recommend running

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.569 
know if I'd really recommend running
sitrep<00:01:37.409> but<00:01:37.560> that's<00:01:37.740> what<00:01:37.860> I<00:01:37.890> was<00:01:38.009> doing<00:01:38.250> early

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
sitrep but that's what I was doing early

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.640 
sitrep but that's what I was doing early
on<00:01:38.700> but<00:01:39.090> I<00:01:39.150> tell<00:01:39.390> you<00:01:39.509> what<00:01:39.689> when<00:01:40.259> you<00:01:40.290> take

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
you start getting more comfortable with

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.929 
you start getting more comfortable with
this<00:02:00.630> game<00:02:00.869> start<00:02:01.590> ramping<00:02:01.979> up<00:02:02.340> your<00:02:02.549> kill

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
this game start ramping up your kill

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.969 
this game start ramping up your kill
streaks<00:02:03.360> if<00:02:03.509> you<00:02:03.659> can<00:02:03.810> regularly<00:02:04.320> pull<00:02:04.799> off

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
streaks if you can regularly pull off

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.160 
streaks if you can regularly pull off
those<00:02:05.219> three<00:02:05.549> bottom<00:02:06.000> ones<00:02:06.210> then<00:02:06.689> move<00:02:06.990> them

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
those three bottom ones then move them

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.350 
those three bottom ones then move them
up<00:02:07.320> a<00:02:07.500> notch<00:02:07.680> so<00:02:07.979> instead<00:02:08.399> of<00:02:08.459> having<00:02:08.670> this

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
up a notch so instead of having this

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.210 
up a notch so instead of having this
komm<00:02:09.630> now<00:02:09.930> I'm<00:02:10.200> really<00:02:10.470> familiar<00:02:10.740> with<00:02:11.039> the

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
komm now I'm really familiar with the

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.310 
komm now I'm really familiar with the
map<00:02:11.400> I<00:02:11.550> don't<00:02:11.730> think<00:02:11.970> that's<00:02:12.210> as<00:02:12.450> necessary

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:13.320 
map I don't think that's as necessary

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.850 
map I don't think that's as necessary
for<00:02:13.620> me

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
for me

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.220 
for me
so<00:02:14.310> I<00:02:14.340> went<00:02:14.700> to<00:02:14.760> the<00:02:14.910> dog<00:02:15.210> now<00:02:15.450> the<00:02:15.510> Trinity

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
so I went to the dog now the Trinity

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:17.960 
so I went to the dog now the Trinity
Hellfire<00:02:16.650> missile<00:02:17.100> and<00:02:17.280> the<00:02:17.670> attack

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
Hellfire missile and the attack

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.580 
Hellfire missile and the attack
helicopter<00:02:18.210> the<00:02:18.840> nice<00:02:19.020> thing<00:02:19.260> about<00:02:19.290> the

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
helicopter the nice thing about the

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.860 
helicopter the nice thing about the
Trinity<00:02:19.800> Hellfire<00:02:20.400> missile<00:02:20.880> and<00:02:21.090> that<00:02:21.540> attack

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
Trinity Hellfire missile and that attack

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.960 
Trinity Hellfire missile and that attack
helicopter<00:02:22.530> is<00:02:22.680> once<00:02:22.980> you<00:02:23.130> get<00:02:23.280> that<00:02:23.490> missile

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
helicopter is once you get that missile

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.850 
helicopter is once you get that missile
it<00:02:24.330> pretty<00:02:24.630> much<00:02:24.780> guarantees<00:02:25.350> that<00:02:25.740> you're

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
it pretty much guarantees that you're

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.770 
it pretty much guarantees that you're
gonna<00:02:25.980> get<00:02:26.190> that<00:02:26.430> attack<00:02:26.880> helicopter<00:02:27.660> and

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
gonna get that attack helicopter and

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.240 
gonna get that attack helicopter and
check<00:02:28.020> this<00:02:28.170> out<00:02:28.380> that's<00:02:28.590> pretty<00:02:28.800> cool<00:02:29.040> I

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
check this out that's pretty cool I

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.040 
check this out that's pretty cool I
didn't<00:02:29.610> even<00:02:29.820> know<00:02:29.970> dogs<00:02:30.240> would<00:02:30.510> go<00:02:30.540> at<00:02:30.840> each

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
didn't even know dogs would go at each

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.560 
didn't even know dogs would go at each
other<00:02:31.350> but<00:02:31.920> apparently<00:02:32.250> they<00:02:32.520> do<00:02:32.580> now<00:02:33.030> with

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
other but apparently they do now with

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.720 
other but apparently they do now with
this<00:02:33.810> Call<00:02:34.200> of<00:02:34.230> Duty<00:02:34.650> I<00:02:34.890> think<00:02:35.310> you<00:02:35.400> have<00:02:35.520> to<00:02:35.610> be

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
this Call of Duty I think you have to be

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.490 
this Call of Duty I think you have to be
a<00:02:35.760> little<00:02:36.060> bit<00:02:36.330> more<00:02:36.540> careful<00:02:37.080> when<00:02:37.350> you're

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
a little bit more careful when you're

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.260 
a little bit more careful when you're
going<00:02:37.709> for<00:02:38.070> higher<00:02:38.310> scorestreaks

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
going for higher scorestreaks

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.020 
going for higher scorestreaks
just<00:02:39.720> because<00:02:40.050> you<00:02:40.290> die<00:02:40.560> so<00:02:41.040> easily<00:02:41.070> compared

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
just because you die so easily compared

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.820 
just because you die so easily compared
to<00:02:42.150> say<00:02:42.330> black<00:02:42.630> ops<00:02:42.870> 2<00:02:43.080> where<00:02:43.320> you<00:02:43.350> can<00:02:43.620> just

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
to say black ops 2 where you can just

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.830 
to say black ops 2 where you can just
kind<00:02:44.010> of<00:02:44.070> run<00:02:44.280> around<00:02:44.430> the<00:02:44.640> map<00:02:44.820> a<00:02:45.030> little<00:02:45.690> bit

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
kind of run around the map a little bit

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.470 
kind of run around the map a little bit
less<00:02:46.320> carefully<00:02:47.070> in<00:02:47.280> this<00:02:47.730> one<00:02:47.910> you<00:02:48.090> really

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
less carefully in this one you really

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.270 
less carefully in this one you really
gotta<00:02:48.720> kind<00:02:49.050> of<00:02:49.140> take<00:02:49.320> your<00:02:49.470> time<00:02:49.739> so<00:02:50.040> as

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
gotta kind of take your time so as

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.250 
gotta kind of take your time so as
you're<00:02:50.489> learning<00:02:50.670> this<00:02:51.000> game<00:02:51.090> I'm<00:02:51.720> finding

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
you're learning this game I'm finding

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.440 
you're learning this game I'm finding
that<00:02:52.290> taking<00:02:52.770> my<00:02:52.890> time<00:02:53.130> is<00:02:53.400> really<00:02:53.640> helping<00:02:54.270> me

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
that taking my time is really helping me

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.870 
that taking my time is really helping me
with<00:02:54.930> pulling<00:02:55.350> off<00:02:55.530> those<00:02:55.800> high<00:02:56.070> kill<00:02:56.370> streaks

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
with pulling off those high kill streaks

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.210 
with pulling off those high kill streaks
another<00:02:57.660> thing<00:02:57.900> that's<00:02:58.080> helping<00:02:58.410> me<00:02:58.470> out<00:02:58.800> just

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
another thing that's helping me out just

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.280 
another thing that's helping me out just
pulling<00:02:59.670> off<00:02:59.820> these<00:03:00.030> streaks<00:03:00.330> is<00:03:00.570> flanking

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
pulling off these streaks is flanking

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.280 
pulling off these streaks is flanking
and<00:03:01.500> staying<00:03:01.950> out<00:03:02.340> of<00:03:02.670> the<00:03:03.120> Twilight<00:03:03.989> zones

and staying out of the Twilight zones

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:05.870 
and staying out of the Twilight zones
that's<00:03:04.530> a<00:03:04.650> term<00:03:04.830> that<00:03:04.860> my<00:03:05.160> friend<00:03:05.400> jesus-freak

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
that's a term that my friend jesus-freak

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.660 
that's a term that my friend jesus-freak
made<00:03:06.180> up<00:03:06.450> to<00:03:06.870> describe<00:03:06.900> those<00:03:07.620> areas<00:03:08.220> of<00:03:08.489> the

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
made up to describe those areas of the

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.640 
made up to describe those areas of the
map<00:03:08.880> that<00:03:09.270> once<00:03:09.540> you<00:03:09.660> go<00:03:09.810> into<00:03:10.020> it's<00:03:10.410> just

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
map that once you go into it's just

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.620 
map that once you go into it's just
really<00:03:10.980> dangerous<00:03:11.310> because<00:03:12.090> there's<00:03:12.300> a<00:03:12.360> lot

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
really dangerous because there's a lot

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.600 
really dangerous because there's a lot
of<00:03:12.750> angles<00:03:13.110> that<00:03:13.230> you<00:03:13.350> can<00:03:13.709> be<00:03:13.830> shot<00:03:14.070> from<00:03:14.310> so

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
of angles that you can be shot from so

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:15.920 
of angles that you can be shot from so
it's<00:03:14.760> really<00:03:15.150> hard<00:03:15.450> to<00:03:15.540> stay<00:03:15.810> alive

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
it's really hard to stay alive

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:28.930 
in this game as you're gonna see but I
did<00:04:26.660> not<00:04:26.810> find<00:04:27.169> anybody<00:04:27.650> hardly<00:04:28.340> with<00:04:28.669> that

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:28.940 
did not find anybody hardly with that

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:30.100 
did not find anybody hardly with that
thing<00:04:29.180> I<00:04:29.330> don't<00:04:29.419> know<00:04:29.600> they<00:04:29.810> were<00:04:30.080> just

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:30.110 
thing I don't know they were just

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:31.840 
thing I don't know they were just
weren't<00:04:30.470> showing<00:04:30.800> up<00:04:31.100> I<00:04:31.220> don't<00:04:31.280> know<00:04:31.520> if<00:04:31.700> I

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:31.850 
weren't showing up I don't know if I

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:34.690 
weren't showing up I don't know if I
needed<00:04:32.150> to<00:04:32.390> do<00:04:32.570> something<00:04:32.900> else<00:04:33.320> but<00:04:34.190> I<00:04:34.400> think

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:34.700 
needed to do something else but I think

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:36.700 
needed to do something else but I think
I<00:04:34.790> only<00:04:34.940> managed<00:04:35.419> one<00:04:35.720> or<00:04:35.870> two<00:04:36.080> kills<00:04:36.500> with

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:36.710 
I only managed one or two kills with

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:38.320 
I only managed one or two kills with
that<00:04:36.890> so<00:04:37.070> I'm<00:04:37.160> thinking<00:04:37.520> about<00:04:37.730> instead<00:04:38.270> of

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:38.330 
that so I'm thinking about instead of

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:40.450 
that so I'm thinking about instead of
writing<00:04:38.630> that<00:04:38.720> helo<00:04:39.080> pilot<00:04:39.290> moving<00:04:40.160> it<00:04:40.310> down

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:40.460 
writing that helo pilot moving it down

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:42.730 
writing that helo pilot moving it down
to<00:04:40.790> one<00:04:41.060> of<00:04:41.180> the<00:04:41.330> Juggernog<00:04:41.930> x'<00:04:41.960> I<00:04:42.320> don't<00:04:42.620> know

to one of the Juggernog x' I don't know

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.220 
to one of the Juggernog x' I don't know
they<00:04:43.040> just<00:04:43.070> seem<00:04:43.430> really<00:04:43.790> funding<00:04:44.330> games<00:04:44.540> but

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:45.230 
they just seem really funding games but

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:47.050
