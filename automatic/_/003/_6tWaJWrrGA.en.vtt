 Where I go 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.540
 I feel 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:50.600
 for being applause from the coaches and 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:54.800

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:56.870

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:03.250
 bar and in the grandstand

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:17.520
 listen to jerry I saw him very connected 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:20.160
 with the song he even commented with 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:21.930
 kalimba was commenting kalimba that 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.960
 apart from that michael from the beginning 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.850
 I would put it between being unfair between 

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:30.230
 the best five voices that I heard 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:30.230
 in all auditions 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:35.180
 not only sometimes but you 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:38.540
 you presented very confidently much 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:40.100
 impetus and for those who do not know today is the 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.720
 day that more demonstrated how big it 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:43.850

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:51.020

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:52.730
 of the leg and arm and the way 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:54.920
