00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.410

and thought I was ready to go but I

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.500 
and thought I was ready to go but I
learned<00:00:52.690> a<00:00:52.840> very<00:00:53.050> valuable<00:00:53.320> lesson<00:00:54.070> and<00:00:54.730> that

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:55.510 
learned a very valuable lesson and that

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:57.870 
learned a very valuable lesson and that
is<00:00:55.720> before<00:00:56.050> you<00:00:56.470> start<00:00:56.800> filming<00:00:57.310> you<00:00:57.520> need<00:00:57.730> to

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:57.880 
is before you start filming you need to

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.800 
is before you start filming you need to
make<00:00:58.090> sure<00:00:58.120> that<00:00:58.720> you're<00:00:59.560> carrying<00:01:00.280> case

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:00.810

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:07.410 
make sure that you're carrying case
cover<00:01:01.810> is<00:01:02.200> clean<00:01:03.130> and<00:01:05.100> therefore<00:01:06.100> I<00:01:06.360> have<00:01:07.360> a

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.420 
cover is clean and therefore I have a

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.140 
cover is clean and therefore I have a
little<00:01:07.840> few<00:01:08.410> smudge<00:01:08.770> marks<00:01:09.190> on<00:01:09.370> the<00:01:09.550> video<00:01:09.850> and

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:10.150 
little few smudge marks on the video and

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:13.800 
little few smudge marks on the video and
I<00:01:10.720> apologize<00:01:11.350> for<00:01:11.380> that<00:01:11.710> as<00:01:12.700> stated<00:01:13.240> before<00:01:13.510> I

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 
I apologize for that as stated before I

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.110 
I apologize for that as stated before I
decided<00:01:14.410> it<00:01:14.680> was<00:01:14.830> time<00:01:15.010> to<00:01:15.070> backtrack<00:01:15.730> so<00:01:16.090> I

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:16.120 
decided it was time to backtrack so I

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:19.290 
decided it was time to backtrack so I
circled<00:01:16.870> around<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:18.310> the<00:01:18.460> high<00:01:18.640> ground<00:01:18.970> and

circled around to the high ground and

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.950 
circled around to the high ground and
ran<00:01:20.110> across<00:01:20.230> the<00:01:20.500> first<00:01:21.300> indication<00:01:22.300> as<00:01:22.930> to

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:22.960 
ran across the first indication as to

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.950 
ran across the first indication as to
what<00:01:23.350> would<00:01:24.250> be<00:01:24.430> following<00:01:24.940> me<00:01:25.120> and<00:01:25.480> it's<00:01:25.780> a

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
what would be following me and it's a

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.700 
what would be following me and it's a
footprint<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:28.150> print<00:01:28.510> was<00:01:28.690> about<00:01:29.020> 14<00:01:29.590> inches

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
fact that i've got this odd thing

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.760 
fact that i've got this odd thing
sitting<00:02:27.250> on<00:02:27.370> my<00:02:27.640> head<00:02:27.940> now<00:02:28.900> of<00:02:29.080> course<00:02:29.140> I'm

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
sitting on my head now of course I'm

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.280 
sitting on my head now of course I'm
sure<00:02:30.130> they<00:02:30.430> have<00:02:30.460> seen<00:02:31.090> other<00:02:31.360> people<00:02:31.810> with

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
so they might be trying to figure out

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.410 
so they might be trying to figure out
what<00:02:47.020> kind<00:02:47.350> of<00:02:47.530> device<00:02:48.010> this<00:02:48.580> particular

what kind of device this particular

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.980 
what kind of device this particular
thing<00:02:49.720> is<00:02:50.220> could<00:02:51.220> it<00:02:51.370> be<00:02:51.610> a<00:02:51.880> threat<00:02:52.240> to<00:02:52.300> them<00:02:52.690> or

thing is could it be a threat to them or

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:57.390 
thing is could it be a threat to them or
is<00:02:53.710> it<00:02:54.070> just<00:02:54.310> that<00:02:54.700> I'm<00:02:55.360> a<00:02:55.390> weird<00:02:55.750> person<00:02:56.400> you

know it's kind of drawing their
attention<00:02:59.080> I<00:02:59.740> believe<00:03:00.070> I<00:03:00.600> finally<00:03:01.600> reached

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
attention I believe I finally reached

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.980 
attention I believe I finally reached
the<00:03:02.650> objective<00:03:03.520> and<00:03:03.850> that<00:03:04.060> was<00:03:04.360> the<00:03:04.630> apple

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:04.990 
the objective and that was the apple

apple<00:03:09.790> blossoms<00:03:10.720> were<00:03:11.590> setting<00:03:12.220> if<00:03:12.540> they

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
apple blossoms were setting if they

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.410 
apple blossoms were setting if they
don't<00:03:13.810> set<00:03:14.260> if<00:03:14.590> it's<00:03:14.830> to<00:03:15.100> drive<00:03:15.400> a<00:03:15.610> year<00:03:15.970> there

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
don't set if it's to drive a year there

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.020 
don't set if it's to drive a year there
will<00:03:16.600> be<00:03:16.780> no<00:03:17.020> apples<00:03:17.530> in<00:03:17.740> the<00:03:17.890> fall<00:03:18.160> which

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
will be no apples in the fall which

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.690 
will be no apples in the fall which
means<00:03:19.420> they'll<00:03:19.900> be<00:03:19.990> in<00:03:20.200> a<00:03:20.440> less<00:03:20.950> amount<00:03:21.490> of

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
means they'll be in a less amount of

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.640 
means they'll be in a less amount of
food<00:03:22.080> for<00:03:23.080> the<00:03:23.230> animals<00:03:23.260> and<00:03:23.890> for<00:03:24.880> our<00:03:25.030> Bigfoot

the<00:03:26.650> unfortunate<00:03:27.520> news<00:03:27.760> is<00:03:28.300> the<00:03:29.080> blossoms<00:03:29.650> are

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 
the unfortunate news is the blossoms are

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.150 
the unfortunate news is the blossoms are
not<00:03:30.100> setting<00:03:30.630> there<00:03:31.630> won't<00:03:31.990> be<00:03:32.170> very<00:03:32.800> many

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
not setting there won't be very many

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.080 
not setting there won't be very many
apples<00:03:33.820> if<00:03:34.150> any<00:03:34.780> at<00:03:35.110> all<00:03:35.460> so<00:03:36.460> therefore<00:03:36.700> I've

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
apples if any at all so therefore I've

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.900 
apples if any at all so therefore I've
got<00:03:37.420> to<00:03:37.660> figure<00:03:38.140> out<00:03:38.230> a<00:03:38.350> way<00:03:38.680> to<00:03:38.740> kind<00:03:39.610> of<00:03:39.760> help

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 
got to figure out a way to kind of help

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:42.960 
got to figure out a way to kind of help
our<00:03:40.180> friends<00:03:40.750> out<00:03:40.930> a<00:03:40.960> little<00:03:41.230> bit<00:03:41.610> with<00:03:42.610> food

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
our friends out a little bit with food

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:46.620 
our friends out a little bit with food
to<00:03:43.360> fatten<00:03:43.720> up<00:03:43.900> for<00:03:44.350> winter<00:03:45.090> I'm<00:03:46.090> kind<00:03:46.510> of

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:46.630 
to fatten up for winter I'm kind of

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:49.200 
to fatten up for winter I'm kind of
thinking<00:03:46.900> that<00:03:47.200> perhaps<00:03:47.650> I<00:03:48.070> should<00:03:48.370> plant<00:03:48.910> a

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:49.210 
thinking that perhaps I should plant a

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:51.990 
thinking that perhaps I should plant a
lot<00:03:49.450> of<00:03:49.660> pumpkins<00:03:50.230> in<00:03:50.620> my<00:03:50.800> garden<00:03:51.130> at<00:03:51.400> home<00:03:51.430> and

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
lot of pumpkins in my garden at home and

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.440 
lot of pumpkins in my garden at home and
see<00:03:52.900> if<00:03:53.020> I<00:03:53.170> can<00:03:53.410> get<00:03:53.620> a<00:03:54.130> lot<00:03:54.460> of<00:03:54.520> pumpkins<00:03:55.000> that

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
see if I can get a lot of pumpkins that

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.810 
see if I can get a lot of pumpkins that
I<00:03:55.600> can<00:03:55.840> maybe<00:03:56.620> take<00:03:57.010> up<00:03:57.280> there<00:03:57.490> and<00:03:57.640> leave

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:57.820 
I can maybe take up there and leave

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:01.350 
I can maybe take up there and leave
behind<00:03:58.500> see<00:03:59.500> if<00:03:59.620> they<00:03:59.770> like<00:03:59.980> them<00:04:00.040> or<00:04:00.910> perhaps

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:01.360 
behind see if they like them or perhaps

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
behind see if they like them or perhaps
maybe<00:04:01.930> get<00:04:02.320> some<00:04:02.590> apples<00:04:03.040> that<00:04:03.190> are<00:04:04.110> cheap<00:04:05.110> or

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:05.380 
maybe get some apples that are cheap or

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:07.350 
maybe get some apples that are cheap or
something<00:04:05.770> that<00:04:05.920> I<00:04:05.950> can<00:04:06.100> just<00:04:06.550> take<00:04:06.910> up<00:04:07.090> there

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:07.360 
something that I can just take up there

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.160 
something that I can just take up there
and<00:04:07.510> leave<00:04:07.690> in<00:04:07.870> various<00:04:08.290> places<00:04:08.500> I<00:04:09.660> took<00:04:10.660> the

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:11.170 
and leave in various places I took the

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:13.740 
and leave in various places I took the
camera<00:04:11.440> out<00:04:11.710> of<00:04:11.920> the<00:04:12.130> carrying<00:04:12.760> case<00:04:13.150> and<00:04:13.210> was

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750 
camera out of the carrying case and was

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:16.050 
camera out of the carrying case and was
using<00:04:14.080> it<00:04:14.380> for<00:04:14.650> our<00:04:14.740> dash<00:04:14.980> cam<00:04:15.400> and<00:04:15.700> you<00:04:15.820> can

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
using it for our dash cam and you can

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.500 
using it for our dash cam and you can
see<00:04:16.330> that<00:04:16.720> there's<00:04:16.989> no<00:04:17.290> smudges<00:04:17.890> anymore

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
see that there's no smudges anymore

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:22.820 
see that there's no smudges anymore
so<00:04:19.520> basically<00:04:20.520> the<00:04:21.200> smudges<00:04:22.200> were<00:04:22.470> on<00:04:22.620> the

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
so basically the smudges were on the

00:04:22.830 --> 00:05:57.839 
so basically the smudges were on the
inside<00:04:23.490> of<00:04:23.970> the<00:04:24.890> carrying<00:04:25.890> case

00:05:57.839 --> 00:05:57.849 

00:05:57.849 --> 00:05:59.909 

you
