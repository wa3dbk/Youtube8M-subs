00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
David Diaz unfortunately she doesn't get

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.460 
David Diaz unfortunately she doesn't get
a<00:02:28.670> lot<00:02:28.880> of<00:02:28.970> the<00:02:29.540> credit<00:02:29.690> that<00:02:29.959> she<00:02:30.080> deserves

a lot of the credit that she deserves

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.890 
a lot of the credit that she deserves
but<00:02:31.190> she's<00:02:31.610> really<00:02:31.850> was<00:02:32.120> so<00:02:32.270> instrumental<00:02:32.540> in

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
but she's really was so instrumental in

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.390 
but she's really was so instrumental in
helping<00:02:33.080> me<00:02:33.380> move<00:02:33.650> Manny<00:02:33.920> up<00:02:34.040> through<00:02:34.280> the

helping me move Manny up through the

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.980 
helping me move Manny up through the
weight<00:02:34.520> classes<00:02:34.790> getting<00:02:35.510> them<00:02:35.720> strong

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:35.990 
weight classes getting them strong

weight classes getting them strong
keeping<00:02:36.380> them<00:02:36.470> powerful<00:02:36.770> but<00:02:37.250> more

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
keeping them powerful but more

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:38.830 
keeping them powerful but more
importantly<00:02:37.790> keep<00:02:38.000> keeping<00:02:38.510> the<00:02:38.630> quickness

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
importantly keep keeping the quickness

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.140 
importantly keep keeping the quickness
there<00:02:39.200> and<00:02:39.410> putting<00:02:39.950> on<00:02:40.070> the<00:02:40.190> right<00:02:40.370> the<00:02:40.820> right

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
there and putting on the right the right

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.590 
there and putting on the right the right
kind<00:02:41.420> of<00:02:41.480> way<00:02:41.630> and<00:02:42.190> so<00:02:43.190> we<00:02:43.640> we've<00:02:44.000> utilized<00:02:44.450> her

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
kind of way and so we we've utilized her

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.330 
kind of way and so we we've utilized her
through<00:02:44.959> this<00:02:45.050> whole<00:02:45.260> camp<00:02:45.500> as<00:02:45.709> well<00:02:45.739> as<00:02:46.070> we

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
through this whole camp as well as we

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.030 
through this whole camp as well as we
have<00:02:46.489> for<00:02:46.700> Mikey<00:02:47.030> so<00:02:47.600> that<00:02:48.170> was<00:02:48.350> the<00:02:48.680> that<00:02:48.980> was

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
have for Mikey so that was the that was

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.920 
have for Mikey so that was the that was
the<00:02:49.160> most<00:02:49.340> important<00:02:49.730> uh<00:02:49.760> approach<00:02:50.630> to<00:02:50.810> this

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930

he might end up working with another
firm<00:04:33.490> a<00:04:33.520> former<00:04:33.880> fighter<00:04:34.030> that<00:04:34.270> you<00:04:34.390> had<00:04:34.600> with

Freddie Roach in Chavez Jr so with him

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:41.610 
Freddie Roach in Chavez Jr so with him
returning<00:04:40.180> obviously<00:04:40.780> he<00:04:41.050> had<00:04:41.200> his<00:04:41.320> issues

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:41.620

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:43.920 
returning obviously he had his issues
making<00:04:41.860> weight<00:04:42.190> he<00:04:42.340> seems<00:04:42.580> like<00:04:42.930> conditioning

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:43.930 
making weight he seems like conditioning

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:45.330 
making weight he seems like conditioning
is<00:04:44.050> definitely<00:04:44.530> something<00:04:44.680> that<00:04:44.800> is<00:04:45.280> a

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:45.340 
is definitely something that is a

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.010 
is definitely something that is a
challenge<00:04:45.460> for<00:04:45.910> him<00:04:46.060> what's<00:04:46.690> your<00:04:46.810> approach

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:47.020 
challenge for him what's your approach

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:49.410 
challenge for him what's your approach
there<00:04:47.350> it's<00:04:48.280> the<00:04:48.520> same<00:04:48.670> that<00:04:48.940> we<00:04:49.060> had<00:04:49.210> when<00:04:49.390> we

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:49.420 
there it's the same that we had when we

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:51.150 
there it's the same that we had when we
first<00:04:49.540> started<00:04:49.990> together<00:04:50.110> for<00:04:50.680> the<00:04:50.740> first<00:04:50.950> few

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:51.160 
first started together for the first few

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:54.270 
first started together for the first few
years<00:04:51.250> I<00:04:51.580> think<00:04:52.470> it's<00:04:53.470> sometimes<00:04:53.890> things

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.280 
years I think it's sometimes things

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.460 
years I think it's sometimes things
happen<00:04:54.760> so<00:04:54.940> fast<00:04:55.120> with<00:04:55.390> Julio<00:04:55.690> you<00:04:56.230> know<00:04:56.260> he

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:56.470 
happen so fast with Julio you know he

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:58.500 
happen so fast with Julio you know he
went<00:04:56.650> from<00:04:56.920> people<00:04:57.610> not<00:04:57.730> giving<00:04:58.060> him<00:04:58.150> any<00:04:58.330> kind

00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:58.510 
went from people not giving him any kind

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:00.240 
went from people not giving him any kind
of<00:04:58.630> a<00:04:58.750> shot<00:04:58.960> to<00:04:59.140> becoming<00:04:59.470> such<00:04:59.740> a<00:04:59.770> big<00:04:59.860> star

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:00.250 
of a shot to becoming such a big star

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:02.820 
of a shot to becoming such a big star
and<00:05:00.780> maybe<00:05:01.780> the<00:05:02.020> thing<00:05:02.170> and<00:05:02.350> fighting<00:05:02.710> so

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:02.830 
and maybe the thing and fighting so

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:04.620 
and maybe the thing and fighting so
frequently<00:05:03.280> I<00:05:03.550> think<00:05:03.940> big<00:05:04.060> things<00:05:04.300> he<00:05:04.390> became

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:04.630 
frequently I think big things he became

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:05.970 
frequently I think big things he became
overwhelming<00:05:05.230> and<00:05:05.380> there<00:05:05.530> was<00:05:05.620> just<00:05:05.770> a<00:05:05.860> little

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:05.980 
overwhelming and there was just a little

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:08.520 
overwhelming and there was just a little
bit<00:05:06.160> of<00:05:06.250> a<00:05:06.400> decline<00:05:06.730> in<00:05:06.760> things<00:05:07.060> but<00:05:07.690> him<00:05:08.380> and

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:08.530 
bit of a decline in things but him and

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:09.900

that<00:05:55.180> weight<00:05:55.330> class<00:05:55.600> so<00:05:56.320> the<00:05:58.500> 160<00:05:59.500> pound

00:05:59.670 --> 00:05:59.680 
that weight class so the 160 pound

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:01.530 
that weight class so the 160 pound
division<00:05:59.860> is<00:06:00.100> there<00:06:00.250> for<00:06:00.460> him<00:06:00.640> if<00:06:00.790> he<00:06:01.330> chooses

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:01.540 
division is there for him if he chooses

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:04.710 
division is there for him if he chooses
it<00:06:01.870> but<00:06:02.560> if<00:06:03.010> not<00:06:03.250> then<00:06:03.700> you<00:06:04.270> know<00:06:04.360> would<00:06:04.540> just

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:04.720 
it but if not then you know would just

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:06.690 
it but if not then you know would just

to<00:06:39.330> lose<00:06:39.480> lose<00:06:39.750> lose<00:06:39.780> you<00:06:40.470> know<00:06:40.560> when<00:06:40.710> you<00:06:40.770> go

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:40.860 
to lose lose lose you know when you go

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:42.560 
to lose lose lose you know when you go
on<00:06:40.890> a<00:06:41.010> two-year<00:06:41.220> losing<00:06:41.700> streak<00:06:41.970> at<00:06:42.120> some

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:42.570 
on a two-year losing streak at some

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:44.180 
on a two-year losing streak at some
point<00:06:42.750> you<00:06:42.840> have<00:06:42.930> to<00:06:42.990> look<00:06:43.140> at<00:06:43.320> and<00:06:43.470> say<00:06:43.590> what's

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:44.190 
point you have to look at and say what's

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:45.680 
point you have to look at and say what's
what's<00:06:44.430> going<00:06:44.670> on<00:06:44.760> what's<00:06:45.000> the<00:06:45.060> basis<00:06:45.390> of<00:06:45.420> it

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:45.690 
what's going on what's the basis of it

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:47.900 
what's going on what's the basis of it
so<00:06:46.200> what<00:06:46.860> do<00:06:46.950> you<00:06:47.010> think<00:06:47.190> the<00:06:47.280> basis<00:06:47.550> of<00:06:47.670> it<00:06:47.760> was

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:47.910 
so what do you think the basis of it was

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:49.640 
so what do you think the basis of it was
I<00:06:48.120> think<00:06:48.480> we<00:06:48.570> got<00:06:48.720> away<00:06:48.840> from<00:06:49.140> the<00:06:49.350> things<00:06:49.560> that

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:49.650 
I think we got away from the things that

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:51.140 
I think we got away from the things that
we'd<00:06:49.890> used<00:06:50.280> to<00:06:50.400> do<00:06:50.550> that<00:06:50.850> we<00:06:50.970> made<00:06:51.120> a

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:51.150 
we'd used to do that we made a

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:52.370 
we'd used to do that we made a
successful<00:06:51.690> which<00:06:51.810> is<00:06:51.840> a<00:06:51.960> strength<00:06:52.260> and

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:52.380 
successful which is a strength and

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:54.500 
successful which is a strength and
conditioning<00:06:52.770> program<00:06:52.830> the<00:06:53.760> way<00:06:54.000> how<00:06:54.210> we<00:06:54.270> used

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:54.510 
conditioning program the way how we used

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:56.450 
conditioning program the way how we used
to<00:06:54.570> do<00:06:54.720> our<00:06:54.870> handle<00:06:55.590> our<00:06:55.680> diets<00:06:56.010> and<00:06:56.160> I<00:06:56.220> think

00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:56.460 
to do our handle our diets and I think

00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:59.510 
to do our handle our diets and I think
you<00:06:57.180> know<00:06:57.300> unfortunately<00:06:58.220> you<00:06:59.220> know<00:06:59.310> as<00:06:59.430> you

00:06:59.510 --> 00:06:59.520 
you know unfortunately you know as you

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:00.830 
you know unfortunately you know as you
get<00:06:59.640> older<00:06:59.700> and<00:07:00.090> things<00:07:00.270> like<00:07:00.390> that<00:07:00.450> you<00:07:00.660> just

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:00.840 
get older and things like that you just

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:02.540 
get older and things like that you just
can't<00:07:01.050> you<00:07:01.470> can't<00:07:01.500> push<00:07:01.860> out<00:07:02.040> the<00:07:02.220> same<00:07:02.400> way

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:02.550 
can't you can't push out the same way

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:03.890 
can't you can't push out the same way
that<00:07:02.670> you<00:07:02.820> did<00:07:02.970> they<00:07:03.390> used<00:07:03.600> to<00:07:03.720> in<00:07:03.780> the<00:07:03.840> past

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:03.900 
that you did they used to in the past

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:06.950 
that you did they used to in the past
and<00:07:04.350> so<00:07:05.280> you<00:07:06.120> know<00:07:06.210> there's<00:07:06.420> a<00:07:06.450> lot<00:07:06.570> of<00:07:06.720> a<00:07:06.750> lot

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:06.960 
and so you know there's a lot of a lot

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:08.690 
and so you know there's a lot of a lot
of<00:07:07.110> different<00:07:07.380> reasons<00:07:07.500> but<00:07:07.890> you<00:07:08.400> know<00:07:08.520> that

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:08.700
