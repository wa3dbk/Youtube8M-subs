one way to give the player information

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:04.550 
one way to give the player information
about<00:00:02.700> what's<00:00:02.909> going<00:00:03.030> on<00:00:03.389> in<00:00:03.510> the<00:00:03.629> game<00:00:03.810> is<00:00:04.049> to

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560 
about what's going on in the game is to

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.089 
about what's going on in the game is to
use<00:00:04.770> a<00:00:04.799> GUI<00:00:05.370> graphical<00:00:06.029> user<00:00:06.359> interface<00:00:07.170> text

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
use a GUI graphical user interface text

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.209 
use a GUI graphical user interface text
element<00:00:08.550> or<00:00:08.700> GUI<00:00:09.090> text<00:00:09.660> to<00:00:10.530> add<00:00:10.710> one<00:00:10.920> to<00:00:11.070> your

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
element or GUI text to add one to your

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:12.919 
element or GUI text to add one to your
scene<00:00:11.490> you<00:00:11.700> just<00:00:11.820> need<00:00:12.150> to<00:00:12.240> go<00:00:12.389> to<00:00:12.450> game<00:00:12.750> object

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
scene you just need to go to game object

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.700 
scene you just need to go to game object
create<00:00:13.590> other<00:00:13.830> and<00:00:14.160> GUI<00:00:14.820> text<00:00:15.389> this<00:00:16.320> will<00:00:16.529> add

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
create other and GUI text this will add

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.580 
create other and GUI text this will add
a<00:00:16.920> written<00:00:17.279> element<00:00:17.670> onto<00:00:17.820> the<00:00:18.150> 2d<00:00:18.590> renderer

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
a written element onto the 2d renderer

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.890 
a written element onto the 2d renderer
of<00:00:19.800> your<00:00:19.980> screen<00:00:20.430> so<00:00:20.640> that's<00:00:20.850> handled<00:00:21.270> by<00:00:21.300> the

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
of your screen so that's handled by the

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:22.519 
of your screen so that's handled by the
camera

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
camera

GUI<00:00:23.070> layer<00:00:23.570> that's<00:00:24.570> not<00:00:24.840> that<00:00:25.289> important<00:00:25.740> when

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
GUI layer that's not that important when

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.769 
GUI layer that's not that important when
you're<00:00:25.980> starting<00:00:26.250> out<00:00:26.550> the<00:00:27.210> important<00:00:27.630> thing

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
you're starting out the important thing

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.570 
you're starting out the important thing
is<00:00:27.930> knowing<00:00:28.140> how<00:00:28.439> to<00:00:28.470> adjust<00:00:28.740> what's<00:00:29.310> written

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
is knowing how to adjust what's written

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.810 
is knowing how to adjust what's written
in<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:29.849> GUI<00:00:30.240> text<00:00:30.750> so<00:00:31.470> you<00:00:31.980> can<00:00:32.160> adjust<00:00:32.489> it<00:00:32.610> via

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
in the GUI text so you can adjust it via

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.270 
in the GUI text so you can adjust it via
the<00:00:32.969> inspector<00:00:33.480> so<00:00:33.809> I<00:00:33.840> could<00:00:34.079> say<00:00:34.260> hello<00:00:34.980> world

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
the inspector so I could say hello world

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.080 
the inspector so I could say hello world
and<00:00:35.630> it<00:00:36.630> would<00:00:36.750> print<00:00:36.930> it<00:00:37.110> on<00:00:37.230> the<00:00:37.350> screen<00:00:37.680> or<00:00:38.090> I

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
and it would print it on the screen or I

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.080 
and it would print it on the screen or I
can<00:00:39.270> control<00:00:39.600> it<00:00:39.780> via<00:00:40.110> a<00:00:40.320> script<00:00:40.739> so<00:00:41.090> for

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
can control it via a script so for

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.670 
can control it via a script so for
example<00:00:42.600> if<00:00:42.809> I<00:00:42.989> go<00:00:43.140> to<00:00:43.200> create<00:00:43.620> JavaScript<00:00:44.100> and

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:45.680 
example if I go to create JavaScript and

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:51.080 
example if I go to create JavaScript and
say<00:00:46.680> GUI<00:00:47.550> text<00:00:48.530> example<00:00:49.730> I'm<00:00:50.730> going<00:00:50.850> to<00:00:50.910> call

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
say GUI text example I'm going to call

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:51.380 
say GUI text example I'm going to call
it<00:00:51.210> that

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
it that

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.180 
it that
again<00:00:51.660> it's<00:00:51.840> not<00:00:51.989> hugely<00:00:52.500> important<00:00:52.949> what<00:00:53.100> you

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
again it's not hugely important what you

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.430 
again it's not hugely important what you
call<00:00:53.399> these<00:00:53.550> things<00:00:53.780> and<00:00:54.780> what<00:00:55.170> I'm<00:00:55.260> going<00:00:55.410> to

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
call these things and what I'm going to

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.319 
call these things and what I'm going to
do<00:00:55.590> is<00:00:55.770> enter<00:00:56.039> my<00:00:56.219> update<00:00:56.699> function<00:00:57.149> which

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
do is enter my update function which

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.869 
do is enter my update function which
remember<00:00:57.750> runs<00:00:58.020> every<00:00:58.350> frame<00:00:58.649> is<00:00:58.890> to<00:00:59.460> address

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
remember runs every frame is to address

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.170 
remember runs every frame is to address
this<00:01:00.770> component<00:01:01.829> so<00:01:01.980> remember<00:01:02.399> GUI<00:01:02.609> text<00:01:03.030> is<00:01:03.149> a

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
this component so remember GUI text is a

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.270 
this component so remember GUI text is a
component<00:01:03.660> on<00:01:03.899> an<00:01:04.049> object<00:01:04.470> so<00:01:05.100> I've<00:01:05.250> just

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
component on an object so I've just

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.010 
component on an object so I've just
added<00:01:05.549> a<00:01:05.790> game<00:01:05.970> object<00:01:06.150> but<00:01:06.479> essentially<00:01:06.930> it's

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
added a game object but essentially it's

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.080 
added a game object but essentially it's
just<00:01:07.170> a<00:01:07.260> normal<00:01:07.560> object<00:01:07.619> with<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.430> GUI<00:01:08.670> text

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
just a normal object with the GUI text

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.600 
just a normal object with the GUI text
component<00:01:09.119> I<00:01:09.810> could<00:01:10.560> have<00:01:10.650> added<00:01:10.799> it<00:01:11.040> to<00:01:11.280> a

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
component I could have added it to a

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.499 
component I could have added it to a
normal<00:01:12.330> object<00:01:12.510> and<00:01:13.430> via<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.760> component<00:01:15.390> menu

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
normal object and via the component menu

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.749 
normal object and via the component menu
as<00:01:15.930> well<00:01:16.140> but<00:01:16.860> I<00:01:16.920> didn't<00:01:17.220> want<00:01:17.369> to<00:01:17.400> do<00:01:17.549> that

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
as well but I didn't want to do that

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.380 
as well but I didn't want to do that
because<00:01:18.509> I<00:01:18.689> would<00:01:19.049> just<00:01:19.400> be<00:01:20.400> making<00:01:20.880> another

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
because I would just be making another

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.929 
because I would just be making another
new<00:01:21.689> object<00:01:22.140> for<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.380> sake<00:01:22.590> of<00:01:22.619> it<00:01:22.890> so<00:01:23.490> instead

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
new object for the sake of it so instead

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.030 
new object for the sake of it so instead
of<00:01:24.090> adding<00:01:24.420> a<00:01:24.810> GUI<00:01:24.990> text<00:01:25.290> element<00:01:25.650> I<00:01:25.710> went<00:01:25.920> to

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
of adding a GUI text element I went to

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.179 
of adding a GUI text element I went to
game<00:01:26.189> object<00:01:26.640> to<00:01:26.729> create<00:01:26.970> other<00:01:27.150> GUI<00:01:27.750> tags<00:01:28.189> so

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
game object to create other GUI tags so

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.969 
game object to create other GUI tags so
I<00:01:29.490> could<00:01:29.909> control<00:01:30.329> it<00:01:30.390> via<00:01:30.869> the<00:01:31.259> inspector<00:01:31.770> but

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
I could control it via the inspector but

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.980 
I could control it via the inspector but
instead<00:01:32.400> I'm<00:01:32.549> going<00:01:32.729> to<00:01:32.850> write<00:01:33.090> a<00:01:33.119> script<00:01:33.600> so

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
instead I'm going to write a script so

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.440 
instead I'm going to write a script so
this<00:01:34.710> is<00:01:34.860> a<00:01:34.890> component<00:01:35.340> I'm<00:01:35.700> addressing<00:01:36.060> so<00:01:36.420> I

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
this is a component I'm addressing so I

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.210 
this is a component I'm addressing so I
can<00:01:36.630> start<00:01:36.900> off<00:01:37.049> by<00:01:37.079> just<00:01:37.500> writing<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:38.070> name

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
can start off by just writing the name

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.760 
can start off by just writing the name
of<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:38.430> component<00:01:38.790> and<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:40.140> setting<00:01:40.500> I<00:01:40.590> want

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
of the component and the setting I want

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.310 
of the component and the setting I want
to<00:01:40.860> control<00:01:41.189> is<00:01:41.430> text<00:01:42.270> so<00:01:42.689> if<00:01:42.780> I<00:01:42.869> look<00:01:42.990> back<00:01:43.170> at

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
to control is text so if I look back at

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.550 
to control is text so if I look back at
the<00:01:43.409> object<00:01:43.799> GUI<00:01:44.490> text<00:01:44.880> component<00:01:45.409> text<00:01:46.409> is

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
the object GUI text component text is

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.190 
the object GUI text component text is
the<00:01:46.710> parameter<00:01:47.189> I<00:01:47.220> want<00:01:47.490> to<00:01:47.610> change<00:01:47.960> so<00:01:48.960> I<00:01:48.990> say

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
the parameter I want to change so I say

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.789 
the parameter I want to change so I say
GUI<00:01:49.409> text<00:01:49.829> text<00:01:50.430> and<00:01:50.820> I<00:01:50.880> can<00:01:51.030> say<00:01:51.320> equal<00:01:52.320> to<00:01:52.530> and

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
GUI text text and I can say equal to and

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.109 
GUI text text and I can say equal to and
write<00:01:53.610> in<00:01:53.790> a<00:01:54.030> string<00:01:54.420> so<00:01:55.380> a<00:01:55.409> string<00:01:55.829> is

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:56.119 
write in a string so a string is

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:58.969 
write in a string so a string is
something<00:01:57.119> inside<00:01:57.540> inverted<00:01:58.170> commas<00:01:58.590> put

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
something inside inverted commas put

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.450 
something inside inverted commas put
simply<00:01:59.360> so<00:02:00.360> if<00:02:00.509> I<00:02:00.600> say<00:02:00.840> GUI<00:02:01.079> text<00:02:01.409> text<00:02:01.950> hey

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
simply so if I say GUI text text hey

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.999 
simply so if I say GUI text text hey
what's<00:02:02.700> up<00:02:02.939> and<00:02:03.180> I<00:02:03.960> know<00:02:04.049> that<00:02:04.380> I<00:02:04.469> need<00:02:04.680> to<00:02:04.829> put

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
what's up and I know that I need to put

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.399 
what's up and I know that I need to put
in<00:02:05.100> a<00:02:05.189> string<00:02:05.520> because<00:02:06.329> if<00:02:06.450> I<00:02:06.540> looked<00:02:06.750> in<00:02:06.930> the

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
in a string because if I looked in the

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.580 
in a string because if I looked in the
scripting<00:02:08.099> reference<00:02:08.129> I<00:02:08.819> would<00:02:09.179> see<00:02:09.539> via<00:02:09.929> text

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
scripting reference I would see via text

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.370 
scripting reference I would see via text
which<00:02:11.340> is<00:02:11.370> what<00:02:11.910> we're<00:02:12.060> adjusting<00:02:12.330> is<00:02:12.780> a

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
which is what we're adjusting is a

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.650 
which is what we're adjusting is a
right<00:02:13.500> string<00:02:14.100> and<00:02:14.150> you'll<00:02:15.150> see<00:02:15.360> why<00:02:15.600> it's

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
right string and you'll see why it's

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.770 
right string and you'll see why it's
important<00:02:16.260> to<00:02:16.290> have<00:02:16.500> that<00:02:16.800> particular<00:02:17.100> type

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
important to have that particular type

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.990 
important to have that particular type
when<00:02:18.780> we<00:02:18.870> have<00:02:19.020> a<00:02:19.050> look<00:02:19.200> at<00:02:19.380> it<00:02:19.470> in<00:02:19.620> a<00:02:19.710> moment<00:02:20.040> so

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
when we have a look at it in a moment so

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.540 
when we have a look at it in a moment so
if<00:02:21.150> I<00:02:21.240> say<00:02:21.420> hey<00:02:21.600> what's<00:02:21.810> up<00:02:21.990> and<00:02:22.170> I<00:02:22.230> save<00:02:22.470> that

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
if I say hey what's up and I save that

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.310 
if I say hey what's up and I save that
switch<00:02:23.550> back<00:02:23.790> to<00:02:23.820> unity<00:02:24.330> and<00:02:24.540> drag<00:02:25.290> that

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
switch back to unity and drag that

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.560 
switch back to unity and drag that
script<00:02:25.920> on<00:02:26.130> to<00:02:26.610> the<00:02:26.730> object<00:02:26.820> remember<00:02:27.360> you<00:02:27.420> can

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
script on to the object remember you can

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.660 
script on to the object remember you can
drag<00:02:27.750> it<00:02:27.900> onto<00:02:28.020> the<00:02:28.110> hierarchy<00:02:28.800> or<00:02:28.980> you<00:02:29.520> can

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
drag it onto the hierarchy or you can

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.710 
drag it onto the hierarchy or you can
drag<00:02:29.910> it<00:02:29.940> into<00:02:30.150> the<00:02:30.360> inspector<00:02:32.420> when<00:02:33.420> I<00:02:33.450> press

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
drag it into the inspector when I press

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.770 
drag it into the inspector when I press
play<00:02:33.930> now<00:02:34.640> it<00:02:35.640> doesn't<00:02:35.820> say<00:02:36.060> hello<00:02:36.330> world<00:02:36.540> it

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
play now it doesn't say hello world it

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.290 
play now it doesn't say hello world it
says<00:02:36.990> what<00:02:37.410> the<00:02:37.440> script<00:02:37.830> is<00:02:37.980> telling<00:02:38.310> it<00:02:38.430> to<00:02:38.460> so

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
says what the script is telling it to so

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.020 
says what the script is telling it to so
hey<00:02:39.690> what's<00:02:39.960> up

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
hey what's up

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.210 
hey what's up
so<00:02:42.030> that's<00:02:42.840> just<00:02:43.020> one<00:02:43.260> quick<00:02:43.620> way<00:02:43.770> of<00:02:43.890> doing<00:02:44.130> it

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
so that's just one quick way of doing it

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.920 
so that's just one quick way of doing it
if<00:02:44.310> I<00:02:44.400> wanted<00:02:44.640> to<00:02:44.760> pass<00:02:44.970> it<00:02:45.180> a<00:02:45.210> variable<00:02:45.810> I

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
if I wanted to pass it a variable I

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.260 
if I wanted to pass it a variable I
could<00:02:46.110> do<00:02:46.260> that<00:02:46.380> as<00:02:46.530> well<00:02:46.560> so<00:02:46.980> for<00:02:47.520> example<00:02:48.030> if

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
could do that as well so for example if

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.320 
could do that as well so for example if
I<00:02:48.600> wanted<00:02:48.960> to<00:02:49.230> create<00:02:50.040> a<00:02:50.070> counter<00:02:50.760> in<00:02:50.940> my<00:02:51.120> game

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
I wanted to create a counter in my game

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.910 
I wanted to create a counter in my game
I<00:02:51.360> could<00:02:51.660> save<00:02:51.840> our<00:02:52.850> counter<00:02:53.850> and<00:02:54.890> usually<00:02:55.890> a

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
I could save our counter and usually a

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.220 
I could save our counter and usually a
counter<00:02:56.370> would<00:02:56.490> be<00:02:56.550> an<00:02:56.940> integer<00:02:57.600> it<00:02:57.840> wants<00:02:58.110> to

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
counter would be an integer it wants to

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.830 
counter would be an integer it wants to
count<00:02:58.410> in<00:02:58.680> whole<00:02:58.890> numbers<00:02:59.100> so<00:02:59.520> let's<00:03:00.510> say

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
count in whole numbers so let's say

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.250 
count in whole numbers so let's say
let's<00:03:01.230> start<00:03:01.560> that<00:03:01.710> at<00:03:01.860> zero<00:03:02.160> and<00:03:02.990> for<00:03:03.990> example

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
let's start that at zero and for example

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.290 
let's start that at zero and for example
well<00:03:04.500> might<00:03:04.740> want<00:03:04.950> to<00:03:05.070> feed<00:03:05.340> that<00:03:05.370> into<00:03:05.940> my<00:03:06.090> GUI

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
well might want to feed that into my GUI

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:07.220 
well might want to feed that into my GUI
text<00:03:06.720> object

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
text object

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.070 
text object
so<00:03:07.440> I<00:03:07.680> might<00:03:08.250> want<00:03:08.460> to<00:03:08.520> say<00:03:08.850> let's<00:03:09.390> increment<00:03:09.600> a

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
so I might want to say let's increment a

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.620 
so I might want to say let's increment a
counter<00:03:10.490> every<00:03:11.490> frame<00:03:11.790> so<00:03:12.030> every<00:03:12.300> time<00:03:12.450> the

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
counter every frame so every time the

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.390 
counter every frame so every time the
update<00:03:12.930> function<00:03:13.110> runs<00:03:13.590> so<00:03:13.800> every<00:03:14.130> frame<00:03:14.370> of

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
update function runs so every frame of

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.670 
update function runs so every frame of
the<00:03:14.640> game<00:03:14.790> I<00:03:15.060> might<00:03:15.660> want<00:03:15.840> to<00:03:15.900> add<00:03:16.110> one<00:03:16.410> to<00:03:16.650> it

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
the game I might want to add one to it

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.130 
the game I might want to add one to it
so<00:03:16.950> I<00:03:16.980> can<00:03:17.250> say<00:03:17.520> plus<00:03:18.000> equals<00:03:18.390> one<00:03:18.540> but<00:03:18.960> I<00:03:18.990> can

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
so I can say plus equals one but I can

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.440 
so I can say plus equals one but I can
also<00:03:19.260> just<00:03:19.410> say<00:03:19.710> counter<00:03:20.220> plus<00:03:20.820> plus<00:03:21.150> that

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
also just say counter plus plus that

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:24.920 
also just say counter plus plus that
will<00:03:22.140> mean<00:03:22.440> add<00:03:22.650> one<00:03:23.010> every<00:03:23.310> time<00:03:23.720> so<00:03:24.720> that's

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
will mean add one every time so that's

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.650 
will mean add one every time so that's
going<00:03:25.110> to<00:03:25.170> change<00:03:25.230> that<00:03:26.160> variable<00:03:26.820> from<00:03:27.330> zero

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
going to change that variable from zero

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.840 
going to change that variable from zero
and<00:03:27.900> start<00:03:28.140> counting<00:03:28.380> up<00:03:28.710> break<00:03:29.010> very<00:03:29.610> very

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
and start counting up break very very

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:34.870 
and start counting up break very very
quickly<00:03:30.230> so<00:03:31.230> if<00:03:31.530> I<00:03:31.710> wanted<00:03:31.920> my<00:03:32.270> GUI<00:03:33.270> text<00:03:33.750> text

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:34.880 
quickly so if I wanted my GUI text text

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.430 
quickly so if I wanted my GUI text text
parameter<00:03:35.880> to<00:03:36.060> display<00:03:36.510> the<00:03:36.960> value<00:03:37.110> of

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
parameter to display the value of

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.530 
parameter to display the value of
counter<00:03:37.830> all<00:03:37.950> the<00:03:38.070> time<00:03:38.280> in<00:03:38.550> theory<00:03:39.450> I<00:03:39.480> should

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
counter all the time in theory I should

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.390 
counter all the time in theory I should
just<00:03:39.900> say<00:03:40.110> counter<00:03:40.740> but<00:03:40.920> the<00:03:40.980> problem<00:03:41.280> with

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
just say counter but the problem with

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.130 
just say counter but the problem with
that<00:03:41.430> is<00:03:41.700> it's<00:03:42.150> not<00:03:42.270> a<00:03:42.390> string<00:03:42.780> it's<00:03:42.990> an

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
that is it's not a string it's an

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.860 
that is it's not a string it's an
integer<00:03:43.500> so<00:03:44.280> if<00:03:44.370> I<00:03:44.459> press<00:03:44.580> save<00:03:44.970> and<00:03:45.330> switch

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
integer so if I press save and switch

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.290 
integer so if I press save and switch
back<00:03:46.050> to<00:03:46.110> unity<00:03:46.370> unity<00:03:47.370> will<00:03:47.700> tell<00:03:47.910> me<00:03:48.060> that<00:03:48.209> it

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:48.300 
back to unity unity will tell me that it

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.500 
back to unity unity will tell me that it
cannot<00:03:48.660> convert<00:03:49.140> integer<00:03:49.680> to<00:03:50.430> string<00:03:50.510> so

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
cannot convert integer to string so

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.990 
cannot convert integer to string so
effectively<00:03:51.990> I<00:03:52.050> putting<00:03:52.500> the<00:03:52.890> wrong<00:03:53.160> datatype

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
effectively I putting the wrong datatype

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.820 
effectively I putting the wrong datatype
there<00:03:54.270> but<00:03:54.450> we<00:03:54.540> can<00:03:54.660> get<00:03:54.840> around<00:03:55.050> that<00:03:55.230> by

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:55.830 
there but we can get around that by

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:59.330 
there but we can get around that by
adding<00:03:56.340> an<00:03:56.550> empty<00:03:57.420> string<00:03:57.750> onto<00:03:58.050> the<00:03:58.860> start<00:03:59.160> of

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
adding an empty string onto the start of

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:02.470 
adding an empty string onto the start of
the<00:03:59.880> counter<00:04:00.270> variable<00:04:00.600> so<00:04:01.410> it<00:04:01.500> can<00:04:01.620> a<00:04:01.650> display

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.480 
the counter variable so it can a display

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.630 
the counter variable so it can a display
effectively<00:04:03.480> nothing<00:04:03.930> plus<00:04:04.380> the<00:04:04.560> counter<00:04:05.010> or

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
effectively nothing plus the counter or

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.910 
effectively nothing plus the counter or
I<00:04:06.060> could<00:04:06.209> write<00:04:06.390> something<00:04:06.450> in<00:04:06.900> I<00:04:07.110> could<00:04:07.709> say

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
I could write something in I could say

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:12.620 
I could write something in I could say
counter<00:04:08.550> is<00:04:10.670> like<00:04:11.670> that<00:04:11.850> with<00:04:12.000> a<00:04:12.030> space<00:04:12.390> and

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:12.630 
counter is like that with a space and

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:13.880 
counter is like that with a space and
then<00:04:12.720> it<00:04:12.750> would<00:04:12.900> add<00:04:13.080> the<00:04:13.230> value<00:04:13.500> on<00:04:13.650> to<00:04:13.770> the

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:13.890 
then it would add the value on to the

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:14.900 
then it would add the value on to the
end<00:04:14.040> of<00:04:14.190> that<00:04:14.280> sentence

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
end of that sentence

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:16.849 
end of that sentence
so<00:04:15.660> let's<00:04:15.810> take<00:04:15.990> a<00:04:16.020> look<00:04:16.170> at<00:04:16.320> that<00:04:16.440> if<00:04:16.590> I<00:04:16.709> hit

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 
so let's take a look at that if I hit

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:19.789 
so let's take a look at that if I hit
save<00:04:17.720> first<00:04:18.720> thing<00:04:18.930> to<00:04:19.020> notice<00:04:19.200> is<00:04:19.410> my<00:04:19.440> error

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
save first thing to notice is my error

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:22.190 
save first thing to notice is my error
is<00:04:20.010> now<00:04:20.190> gone<00:04:20.459> which<00:04:20.670> is<00:04:20.850> great<00:04:21.120> and<00:04:21.359> then<00:04:21.989> if<00:04:22.109> I

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 
is now gone which is great and then if I

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.120 
is now gone which is great and then if I
press<00:04:22.440> play<00:04:23.479> is<00:04:24.479> counter<00:04:25.470> is<00:04:25.620> and<00:04:25.860> it's

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
press play is counter is and it's

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:28.480 
press play is counter is and it's
counting<00:04:26.610> up

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:28.490 
counting up

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:31.370 
counting up
you<00:04:29.490> can<00:04:29.640> also<00:04:29.790> change<00:04:30.330> the<00:04:30.510> font<00:04:30.690> of<00:04:31.020> a<00:04:31.200> GUI

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
you can also change the font of a GUI

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:34.730 
you can also change the font of a GUI
text<00:04:31.920> if<00:04:32.340> you've<00:04:32.490> got<00:04:32.640> a<00:04:32.670> true<00:04:32.910> type<00:04:33.120> font<00:04:33.450> or<00:04:33.740> a

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
text if you've got a true type font or a

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.140 
text if you've got a true type font or a
couple<00:04:35.070> of<00:04:35.160> other<00:04:35.310> different<00:04:35.670> font<00:04:35.910> types

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.150 
couple of other different font types

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:39.170 
couple of other different font types

more info on that you can just put them
into<00:04:41.370> the<00:04:41.520> project<00:04:41.850> folder<00:04:42.000> and<00:04:42.270> you<00:04:43.230> can<00:04:43.260> drag

them into the font setting there and

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.130 
them into the font setting there and
change<00:04:47.160> the<00:04:47.340> font<00:04:47.520> size<00:04:47.820> here<00:04:48.240> to<00:04:48.990> whatever

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:49.140 
change the font size here to whatever

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:51.620

you<00:04:49.350> want<00:04:49.440> it<00:04:49.560> to<00:04:49.710> be<00:04:49.970> you<00:04:50.970> can<00:04:51.150> also<00:04:51.270> change

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:51.630 
you want it to be you can also change

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:54.920 
you want it to be you can also change
anchoring<00:04:52.290> so<00:04:52.500> where<00:04:52.770> the<00:04:53.340> text<00:04:54.240> starts<00:04:54.450> off<00:04:54.750> I

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 
anchoring so where the text starts off I

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.310 
anchoring so where the text starts off I
might<00:04:55.050> want<00:04:55.230> to<00:04:55.260> say<00:04:55.440> middle<00:04:56.340> Center

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:57.320 
might want to say middle Center

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:01.130 
might want to say middle Center
alignment<00:04:58.340> center<00:04:59.340> and<00:05:00.180> that'll<00:05:00.390> be<00:05:00.480> bang<00:05:00.990> on

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:01.140 
alignment center and that'll be bang on

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:02.660 
alignment center and that'll be bang on
in<00:05:01.260> the<00:05:01.350> middle<00:05:01.530> of<00:05:01.650> the<00:05:01.710> screen<00:05:01.890> and<00:05:02.220> then<00:05:02.610> you

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:02.670 
in the middle of the screen and then you

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:04.160 
in the middle of the screen and then you
can<00:05:02.790> control<00:05:03.300> the<00:05:03.510> positioning<00:05:03.990> of<00:05:04.080> the

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:04.170 
can control the positioning of the

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:06.940 
can control the positioning of the
overall<00:05:04.440> element<00:05:04.950> using<00:05:05.670> the<00:05:05.790> X<00:05:06.000> and<00:05:06.390> y<00:05:06.570> values

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:06.950 
overall element using the X and y values

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:10.940 
overall element using the X and y values
so<00:05:07.950> if<00:05:08.250> I<00:05:08.400> wanted<00:05:08.610> it<00:05:08.760> to<00:05:08.910> be<00:05:09.090> let's<00:05:09.960> say<00:05:10.320> upper

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:10.950 
so if I wanted it to be let's say upper

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:16.610 
so if I wanted it to be let's say upper
left<00:05:11.190> and<00:05:11.870> I<00:05:12.870> wanted<00:05:13.110> it<00:05:13.230> to<00:05:13.320> be<00:05:15.230> at<00:05:16.230> the<00:05:16.410> bottom

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:16.620 
left and I wanted it to be at the bottom

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:19.460 
left and I wanted it to be at the bottom
there<00:05:17.180> then<00:05:18.180> what<00:05:18.570> I<00:05:18.600> could<00:05:18.720> do<00:05:19.020> is<00:05:19.260> position

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:19.470 
there then what I could do is position

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:22.850 
there then what I could do is position
it<00:05:19.860> like<00:05:20.040> that<00:05:20.280> and<00:05:20.550> then<00:05:21.480> as<00:05:21.840> soon<00:05:22.050> as<00:05:22.200> I<00:05:22.350> see

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:22.860 
it like that and then as soon as I see

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:24.260 
it like that and then as soon as I see
what<00:05:22.980> it<00:05:23.040> looks<00:05:23.190> like<00:05:23.370> I<00:05:23.610> can<00:05:23.760> start<00:05:24.000> tinkering

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:24.270 
what it looks like I can start tinkering

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:27.350 
what it looks like I can start tinkering
with<00:05:24.540> the<00:05:25.110> x<00:05:25.320> and<00:05:25.560> y<00:05:25.680> values<00:05:25.710> in<00:05:26.340> order<00:05:27.000> to<00:05:27.150> get

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:27.360 
with the x and y values in order to get

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.600 
with the x and y values in order to get
it<00:05:27.450> exactly<00:05:27.870> where<00:05:28.650> I<00:05:28.680> want<00:05:28.950> it<00:05:29.010> to<00:05:29.070> be<00:05:29.370> and

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:29.610 
it exactly where I want it to be and

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:32.659 
it exactly where I want it to be and
they<00:05:30.240> will<00:05:30.390> scale<00:05:30.810> based<00:05:31.560> on<00:05:31.800> how<00:05:32.160> big<00:05:32.460> or

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:32.669 
they will scale based on how big or

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:36.380 
they will scale based on how big or
small<00:05:32.790> your<00:05:33.660> screen<00:05:34.350> size<00:05:34.590> happens<00:05:35.010> to<00:05:35.160> be<00:05:35.390> so

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:36.390 
small your screen size happens to be so

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:38.150 
small your screen size happens to be so
if<00:05:36.480> I<00:05:36.540> press<00:05:36.750> play<00:05:36.780> now<00:05:37.140> you'll<00:05:37.410> see<00:05:37.650> the<00:05:37.830> full

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:38.160 
if I press play now you'll see the full

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.730 
if I press play now you'll see the full
effect<00:05:38.460> of<00:05:38.580> that<00:05:38.760> and<00:05:38.970> there's<00:05:39.240> my<00:05:39.419> counter<00:05:39.900> so

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:40.740 
effect of that and there's my counter so

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:42.920 
effect of that and there's my counter so
that's<00:05:40.890> basic<00:05:41.400> usage<00:05:41.790> of<00:05:42.000> a<00:05:42.090> GUI<00:05:42.270> text<00:05:42.780> in

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:42.930 
that's basic usage of a GUI text in

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:45.470 
that's basic usage of a GUI text in
unity
