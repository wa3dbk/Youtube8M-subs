trying to map how genes are used across

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.410 
trying to map how genes are used across

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.510 
brain development and across structures
of<00:00:17.570> the<00:00:17.630> brain

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:21.520 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.520 

this<00:00:22.520> particular<00:00:22.850> project<00:00:23.270> aimed<00:00:23.990> at<00:00:24.290> the

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:24.530 
this particular project aimed at the

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:27.490 
this particular project aimed at the
specific<00:00:25.369> period<00:00:25.760> of<00:00:25.910> cortical<00:00:26.690> formation

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:27.500 
specific period of cortical formation

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.530 
specific period of cortical formation
during<00:00:27.830> mid<00:00:28.190> gestational<00:00:28.820> pregnancy<00:00:29.300> and

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:29.540 
during mid gestational pregnancy and

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:32.799 
during mid gestational pregnancy and
really<00:00:30.500> this<00:00:30.619> is<00:00:30.680> a<00:00:31.160> critical<00:00:31.910> period<00:00:32.150> when

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:32.809 
really this is a critical period when

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:34.660 
really this is a critical period when
the<00:00:32.900> human<00:00:33.200> cortex<00:00:33.440> is<00:00:33.800> just<00:00:34.070> being<00:00:34.250> formed

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:34.670 
the human cortex is just being formed

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:36.970 
the human cortex is just being formed
the<00:00:35.150> cells<00:00:35.450> are<00:00:35.660> dividing<00:00:35.890> starting<00:00:36.890> to

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:36.980 
the cells are dividing starting to

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:38.770 
the cells are dividing starting to
migrate<00:00:37.160> out<00:00:37.550> into<00:00:37.820> their<00:00:37.970> final<00:00:38.300> locations

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:38.780 
migrate out into their final locations

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.260 
migrate out into their final locations
are<00:00:39.379> starting<00:00:39.680> to<00:00:39.800> form<00:00:40.010> circuits<00:00:40.489> and<00:00:40.730> so

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:41.270 
are starting to form circuits and so

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.780 
are starting to form circuits and so
this<00:00:41.420> is<00:00:41.570> a<00:00:41.600> time<00:00:41.870> when<00:00:42.590> really<00:00:42.860> things<00:00:43.160> could

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:43.790 
this is a time when really things could

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:45.760 
this is a time when really things could
go<00:00:43.910> wrong<00:00:44.150> in<00:00:44.660> normal<00:00:45.020> development<00:00:45.440> to<00:00:45.590> lead

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:45.770 
go wrong in normal development to lead

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.240 
go wrong in normal development to lead
to<00:00:45.920> brain<00:00:46.100> disorders

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.500 

genes<00:00:51.250> are<00:00:51.340> used<00:00:51.550> very<00:00:51.850> differently<00:00:52.270> in

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:52.510 
genes are used very differently in

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.080 
genes are used very differently in
development<00:00:53.110> than<00:00:53.590> in<00:00:53.890> the<00:00:54.010> adult<00:00:54.250> so<00:00:54.940> we've

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:55.090 
development than in the adult so we've

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:56.459 
development than in the adult so we've
done<00:00:55.239> a<00:00:55.270> lot<00:00:55.480> of<00:00:55.629> work<00:00:55.780> on<00:00:55.930> the<00:00:56.079> adult<00:00:56.320> brain

00:00:56.459 --> 00:00:56.469 
done a lot of work on the adult brain

00:00:56.469 --> 00:00:58.410 
done a lot of work on the adult brain
but<00:00:57.040> it<00:00:57.129> turns<00:00:57.340> out<00:00:57.460> that<00:00:57.640> the<00:00:57.850> patterning<00:00:58.300> is

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:58.420 
but it turns out that the patterning is

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.210 
but it turns out that the patterning is
really<00:00:58.720> almost<00:00:59.199> entirely<00:00:59.680> different<00:01:00.160> at

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:00.220 
really almost entirely different at

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:02.850 
really almost entirely different at
these<00:01:00.370> early<00:01:00.699> stages<00:01:01.230> in<00:01:02.230> particular<00:01:02.559> it

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:02.860 
these early stages in particular it

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.310 
these early stages in particular it
seems<00:01:02.920> that<00:01:03.280> even<00:01:03.610> more<00:01:03.850> of<00:01:04.059> the<00:01:04.269> whole<00:01:04.839> genome

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:05.320 
seems that even more of the whole genome

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.430 
seems that even more of the whole genome
is<00:01:05.470> used<00:01:05.710> almost<00:01:06.030> 95%<00:01:07.030> of<00:01:07.119> all<00:01:07.240> genes<00:01:07.540> are<00:01:08.110> used

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:08.440 
is used almost 95% of all genes are used

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.310 
is used almost 95% of all genes are used
during<00:01:09.009> the<00:01:09.220> state<00:01:09.520> of<00:01:09.550> early<00:01:10.060> development

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
during the state of early development

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.749 
during the state of early development
whereas<00:01:11.320> an<00:01:11.500> adult<00:01:11.800> is<00:01:11.979> smaller<00:01:12.250> proportion

00:01:12.749 --> 00:01:12.759 
whereas an adult is smaller proportion

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:17.750 
whereas an adult is smaller proportion
more<00:01:12.909> like<00:01:13.060> 85%<00:01:13.810> of<00:01:13.899> use

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:17.760 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.780 

a<00:01:17.840> primary<00:01:18.840> benefit<00:01:19.320> of<00:01:19.350> having<00:01:19.770> such<00:01:20.040> a<00:01:20.070> broad

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
a primary benefit of having such a broad

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.450 
a primary benefit of having such a broad
and<00:01:21.120> unbiased<00:01:21.630> map<00:01:22.080> is<00:01:22.410> that<00:01:22.950> one<00:01:23.100> could<00:01:23.280> look

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
and unbiased map is that one could look

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.940 
and unbiased map is that one could look
at<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.790> distribution<00:01:24.390> for<00:01:24.870> the<00:01:24.990> usage<00:01:25.350> of<00:01:25.590> any

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
at the distribution for the usage of any

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.940 
at the distribution for the usage of any
gene<00:01:26.250> across<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:27.090> entire<00:01:27.390> brain<00:01:27.800> so<00:01:28.800> what

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
gene across the entire brain so what

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.860 
gene across the entire brain so what
this<00:01:29.070> allows<00:01:29.250> researchers<00:01:29.760> to<00:01:30.120> do<00:01:30.390> is<00:01:30.570> to<00:01:30.690> take

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:30.870 
this allows researchers to do is to take

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:32.660 
this allows researchers to do is to take
genes<00:01:31.200> that<00:01:31.410> they<00:01:31.560> have<00:01:31.710> associated<00:01:32.010> with<00:01:32.460> any

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
genes that they have associated with any

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.060 
genes that they have associated with any
developmental<00:01:33.390> disorder<00:01:33.810> and<00:01:34.070> pinpoint

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
developmental disorder and pinpoint

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.340 
developmental disorder and pinpoint
exactly<00:01:35.250> when<00:01:36.030> and<00:01:36.180> where<00:01:36.240> that<00:01:37.020> gene<00:01:37.230> is

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
exactly when and where that gene is

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.440 
exactly when and where that gene is
being<00:01:37.590> used<00:01:37.800> and<00:01:38.100> that<00:01:38.760> when<00:01:38.970> and<00:01:39.150> where<00:01:39.300> it

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
being used and that when and where it

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.240 
being used and that when and where it
gives<00:01:39.600> you<00:01:39.750> a<00:01:39.780> very<00:01:40.110> good<00:01:40.650> idea<00:01:40.800> of<00:01:41.070> the

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
gives you a very good idea of the

gives you a very good idea of the
mechanism<00:01:41.820> whereby<00:01:42.000> that<00:01:42.690> gene<00:01:42.900> might

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
mechanism whereby that gene might

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.800 
mechanism whereby that gene might
actually<00:01:43.320> be<00:01:43.680> used<00:01:43.950> and<00:01:44.220> we<00:01:44.880> show<00:01:45.480> in<00:01:45.690> the
