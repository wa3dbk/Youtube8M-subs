the<00:02:39.050> highlight<00:02:39.709> of<00:02:39.739> bits<00:02:40.160> where's<00:02:41.090> like<00:02:41.390> they

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:41.570 
the highlight of bits where's like they

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:43.120 
the highlight of bits where's like they
light<00:02:41.959> supposed<00:02:42.290> to<00:02:42.410> be<00:02:42.470> hitting<00:02:42.830> it<00:02:42.950> with

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
light supposed to be hitting it with

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.670 
light supposed to be hitting it with
like<00:02:43.400> gray<00:02:43.880> and<00:02:44.239> that<00:02:44.780> was<00:02:44.930> just<00:02:45.110> making<00:02:45.560> the

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
like gray and that was just making the

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.949 
like gray and that was just making the
rest<00:02:45.860> of<00:02:46.070> it<00:02:46.220> look<00:02:46.489> really<00:02:46.940> ugly<00:02:47.120> so<00:02:47.600> I<00:02:47.630> tried

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
rest of it look really ugly so I tried

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:50.440 
rest of it look really ugly so I tried
using<00:02:48.170> blue<00:02:48.770> and<00:02:49.610> that<00:02:49.790> didn't<00:02:50.030> work<00:02:50.090> either

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
using blue and that didn't work either

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.530 
using blue and that didn't work either
so<00:02:51.170> it<00:02:51.320> just<00:02:51.350> ends<00:02:51.770> up<00:02:51.830> with<00:02:52.010> like<00:02:52.190> this

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
so it just ends up with like this

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.090 
so it just ends up with like this
horrible<00:02:53.540> grainy<00:02:53.840> patch<00:02:54.200> of<00:02:54.440> white<00:02:54.680> showing
