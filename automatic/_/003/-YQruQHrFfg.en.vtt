00:00:54.499 --> 00:00:59.809
 vodichku pot I poured so 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:04.440

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:07.110

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:11.630

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:22.380
 tummy and lay here the carrot 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:26.280
 also more carrots will be very 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:31.770
 tasty and here we add a sprig 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:32.580
 greenery and do the same with the other 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.680

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.110
 Now I send it to the stove and on 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.550
 high heat bring to a boil under 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.820
