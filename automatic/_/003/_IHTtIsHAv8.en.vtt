00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.640
 hello, friends, I served you and in this 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.500
 I'm going to show you how to draw with 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.900
 the right hand on the hi hat for 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.430
 enrich the groove the two patterns 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:45.510
 that I am going to teach you in this class are 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:47.790
 1 2 3 and 1 3 4 and what they mean 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.830
 these numbers therefore mean the number 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:01:01.010
 of sixteenths that I'm going to touch this is 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:01:01.010
 1 2 3 1 2 3 4 2 and 1 3 4 3 points 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.770
 two 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:10.450
 now I'm going to make an example in the 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.450
 battery so you can see how it sounds 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:21.940
 and 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:30.670
 Y 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:39.460
 and 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:44.570
 to play this at slow speeds what 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.740
 we can do quietly from the 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.740
 doll in this way 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.290
 but when we want to play this 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:57.300
 combination to a quick time os 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.460
 I recommend that you use the technique that 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:03.440
 we saw in the free stroke class where 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.440
 we use our fingers in this way 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:14.760
 and also used the same technique to 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:17.600
 the combination 134 if I go slow I can 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.600
 touch of wrist 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:25.290
 and if I go fast, it makes it easier for me to use the 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.290
 fingers 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:34.240
 a way in how I work this 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:37.900
 resource is catching a simple rhythm of 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:40.900
 hype and box and adding eighth notes on 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:43.030
 charles I make a compass like this and 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.710
 in the second measure I change it to the 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:49.350
 combination that we will see that in 

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:49.350
 this case is going to be the combination 1 2 3 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.480
 i 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:11.740
 Now I can do it two measures and two 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:11.740
 bars for example 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.180
 and 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.810
 ah 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.080
 a style where this pattern fits 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.360
 perfectly 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:38.660
 it's the drama you both look at this 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.660
 example 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:09.360
 let's continue now with the pattern 134 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:11.550
 that is used a lot in music 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:16.040
 latina since this is usually played in the 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:17.690
 cowbell tom kitt an attitude piquito 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:20.970
 34,141 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:24.210
 then as before I will first play a 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:29.150
 ostinato of bombo and caja with charles a 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:29.150
 ribs and then I'll go to 134 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.410
 Y 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:35.530
 Y 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:39.320
 Y 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:41.980
 Y 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.980
 all right 

00:04:43.969 --> 00:04:47.680
 Y 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.680
 i 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:51.250
 Y 

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:54.370
 Y 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:02.330
 and now he will play a groove with Latin air 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:02.330
 using this pattern 

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:12.360
 sometimes 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:20.270
 ah 

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:20.270
 Y 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:26.210
 i 

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:33.940
 you have seen that resource so simple and 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:36.460
 enriching because my advice is that what 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:38.740
 you work slowly and with metronome 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:40.930
 to memorize it well and so that 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:43.630
 you can enter it in your 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:46.150
 following interpretations and for today 

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:46.840
 up here many thanks for 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:49.210
 to visit 

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:53.370
 I am beat puntocom see you in the 

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:53.370
 next class until soon
