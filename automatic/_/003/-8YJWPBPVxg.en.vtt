 above what about the kind of terraces 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.840
 that below the sea we see the 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.840
 sea ​​there at the bottom would weigh down for the 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.570
 dominates and then there are all those forests there 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:47.510
 around it's absolutely awesome wild 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.510

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.780
 gd diarra moors it's an island that has been 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.799
 given by the British crown 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:58.030
 was in 1885 to a family who 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:01.179
 was called foot 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:03.729
 and then these people are really 

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:05.740
 established here one lighten the forest 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:08.200
 really create that pasture that 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:11.580
 can see and then there have been several 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:15.099
 owners until the 90s 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:19.180
 moment when then everything was it was 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:21.580
 abandoned and it's right after that the 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:25.680
 john family keller calvary it was 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:29.769
 a Canadian mountaineer who died in 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:31.420
 1993 and the lady family that wine has 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:33.250
 finally decided to donate to 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:37.150
 the Canadian state to buy this island 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:39.120
 is to turn it into a park 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:43.420
 British Columbia 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:47.799
 there are two birds felt 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:51.480
 vultures who all of you from a gift are the 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:56.350
 English translation stark and vultures 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:59.880
 if we get closer we see that what makes them 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:05.100
 I was interested it was a carcass 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:05.100
 a carcass of sheep 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.090
 like that there are not only destinies 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:12.680
 happy for the sheep again 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:15.510
 wild on this island at mhb is 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.730
 again his revenge is also the 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:20.430
 animal paradise 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:24.270
 geese of course geese geese that 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:27.120
 have not stopped shouting since this morning and 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:29.430
 then also in addition to the sheep again 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:32.750
 wild as in the song there is 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.750
 even a raccoon 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:42.780
 this is already time for the return of the 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:45.120
 sea a glass that goes back not the 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:51.540
 speed of a galloping horse but and 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:53.850
 a crab you almost 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:59.090
 imperceptible but it's clear this 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:59.090
 this time it moves chamade do you
