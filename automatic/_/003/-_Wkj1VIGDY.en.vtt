00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:20.500
 and what the rock says welcome new 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:22.300
 draw and welcome to a new video of 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.579
 healthy dragon ball bears that is not a 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:28.509
 video as such but an informative video 

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:30.759
 of in the new update version 1.0 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:32.259
 5 that brings the game that among others 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:33.940
 improvements we will see what it is that brings 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:35.739
 because if I give here right now this 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.960
 button we will see that we are in level 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:39.870
 82 yes up to the next level I have 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:43.000
 250,000 points to get but good 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:46.210
 is the level sense will say it has 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.280
 hacked the game is a hacker no I'm not 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.170
 a hacker is that with these new 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.239
 utilization among many other improvements 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.940
 then you can tell us 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:57.789
 we can put the level level cap 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:01.030
 80 which will be the maximum before level 85 

00:00:57.789 --> 00:01:02.859
 that the truth is very good that if it is 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:06.460
 much more difficult to reach and the 

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:08.500
 level 85 because at the point he asks you 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.720
 well 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.840
 it's more complicated you know we can not 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.980
 do our tricks as well as the one 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.550
 wants the thing to do a secondary 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:20.940
 of brolin and such words fast because 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:24.520
 you already have to repeat a few times 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:27.190
 well I will tell you next what 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:30.100
 that brings the new the new update 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:32.500
 it is in English but I am going to 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.720
 try to translate here to my spanish 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:38.320
 macarrÃ³nico then better than the translator 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:40.030
 of google is so good first thing 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.150
 that brings good first thing that 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.850
 bring that brings 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.700
 that we can put from level 80 to 85 the 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.960
 they have increased the level that first thing 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.050
 that I think is almost the most 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.510
 important has already imagined 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:56.970
 with a level 85 a staff of level 85 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:02:01.260
 it has to be cinnamon stick but 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:04.840
 but the fat man is going to imagine himself good 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:06.820
 they have added the data for the new dlc 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.179
 I think if we give you here data 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.519
 of game 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:12.079
 the coach I think that bread comes out here 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:16.310
 it's supposed to be from left to right 

00:02:12.079 --> 00:02:16.609
 it comes out wide spread and bread I think it was 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.260
 bread 

00:02:16.609 --> 00:02:23.299
 I do not remember if the bread but almost sure 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:25.060
 that are badly good we follow one thing 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:31.310
 that also improves it quite finally 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:33.620
 is that when the missions leave 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.780
 secondary that mediating reality 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.909
 the measure of secondary when there is a 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:41.959
 warning that there is a goal 

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:44.540
 secondary you know of new warning 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:48.739
 new enemy is worth it because they have 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:51.560
 increased, that is, luck and 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:54.379
 we do not need so much luck so that 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:58.130
 takes us for example in the mission to 

00:02:54.379 --> 00:03:01.400
 get the clothes must gto 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:04.850
 finally finally will come much more to 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.800
 often old man who is not these last times 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:10.270
 that you tried ten times and 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:14.120
 ten left minus four or be a mortal 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:16.549
 incredible good next improvement 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:19.310
 when we start a secondary mission and 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:22.879
 we return to toquito key city no longer 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:25.220
 appear we have just up here it's worth 

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:27.349
 top of the whole we are going to put it here 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:31.099
 usually we always come out here from 

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:32.599
 right here right here and the teacher that 

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:36.709
 let's have activated by leaving just below 

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:39.170
 Well, not now, we appear right in 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:42.709
 this door is one of the three here 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:45.319
 and the teacher as you see will appear just 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:47.750
 in the little information table 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:49.910
 here it's worth here here I have two someone the 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:53.120
 clown and abidal 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:56.220
 well that's another improvement 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:58.320
 that more than more 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:00.270
 well what does it say here that has been changed 

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:02.820
 the specification when it was disconnected 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:06.360
 the Genovese dragonball servers do not 

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:09.390
 I know what that is, I do not know why it has never 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:12.300
 thrown out of the game I just missed the 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:14.550
 game before when I asked for some wish 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:17.130
 to the dragon zero that the game was created and 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:21.090
 I got out of the duster took out the 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:23.910
 menu from the computer and had to be so 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:25.370
 I do not know if that is well fixed, not what 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:28.280
 he 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:30.780
 well here also says that there are 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:34.090
 put measures against the traps 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:36.449
 I do not know what he puts here in 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:36.449
 you are 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:42.990
 start multiple session in groups of 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:45.030
 pressure I do not know what it is not just what 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:46.969
 some rules during the online battle 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:48.860
 they've changed 

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:51.460
 during endless battles there is no 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:54.330
 can use the capsules 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:57.580
 I do not like that either, I do not play 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:59.020
 pvp combat I do not know I do not know why I 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:01.330
 also that I play side missions 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:02.849
 with friends or if anyone had any 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:06.490
 complication some secondary mission 

00:05:02.849 --> 00:05:07.120
 here I am in case you need any 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:09.310

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:18.060
 the web channel and I world 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:20.819

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:23.910
 of information if also when it comes out 

00:05:20.819 --> 00:05:26.759
 off the title screen below to 

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:28.919
 the right upper corner lower 

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:31.169
 but lower right will leave the number 

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:34.860
 of the game version that is now or 

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:37.800
 as I said in version 1.0 5 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:39.860
 and well little more little we make a 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:44.000
 summary then good 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:46.219
 the level stop no longer level 80 already the 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.710
 level 85 that is hard to get to 

00:05:46.219 --> 00:05:50.630
 at 85 I'm level 82 

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:53.470
 and thanks 

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:53.470
 as well 

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:58.849
 the possibility of new ones 

00:05:56.350 --> 00:06:01.939
 enemies some notice of 

00:05:58.849 --> 00:06:04.399
 some secondary mission 

00:06:01.939 --> 00:06:06.559
 a secondary objective has been 

00:06:04.399 --> 00:06:08.240
 I increased not know if also 

00:06:06.559 --> 00:06:09.740
 increased the European for example 

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:13.819
 that has more chances that you get 

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:15.499
 a zeta soul or you get the uniform 

00:06:13.819 --> 00:06:17.449
 who wants or the skill the superbowl 

00:06:15.499 --> 00:06:20.449
 evanescent that is the most 

00:06:17.449 --> 00:06:24.529
 Wanted super electric strike I do not know 

00:06:20.449 --> 00:06:25.759
 I mean, when it came out, they 're 

00:06:24.529 --> 00:06:30.060
 in the update 

00:06:25.759 --> 00:06:32.490
 I played a game to get it 

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:35.310
 the zeta soul of someone video blocks 

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:36.840
 I'm fine and I've gone to the 

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:40.139
 first 

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:43.560
 so I do not know if it's chance too 

00:06:40.139 --> 00:06:45.600
 that there are many videos that people are 

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:48.960
 wrong in how it is done but good 

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:52.710
 I'll make another video of how you get salt 

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:54.150
 pot and good nothing else for now I 

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:55.680
 I think more or less has been a video 

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:57.240
 informative that I do not want either 

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:59.280
 is too long because it is more or 

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:03.810
 less let's go for six minutes and so 

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:05.960
 what good gentlemen greetings and even the 

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:05.960
 Monday
