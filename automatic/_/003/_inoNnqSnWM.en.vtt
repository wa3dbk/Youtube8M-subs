00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:30.949
 volkswagen presents fox bluemotion 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:33.949
 2014 that the new engine opens in Brazil 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:35.720
 three-cylinder 1.0 liter family 

00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:38.210
 and to 211 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:40.699
 it is the most modern engine manufactured 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.430
 by Volkswagen in the country as much as 

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:45.110
 respect to its production process 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:47.629
 the resources available to it 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.309
 with the new engine fox bluemotion is 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:51.799
 makes the first Volkswagen for the 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:53.900
 Brazilian market to rely on engine 

00:00:51.799 --> 00:01:03.739
 three cylinders and one more model 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:01:06.229
 of the brand in Brazil produced 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:08.810
 in são carlos in the interior of são paulo 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:10.810
 211 was developed according to the 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.670
 energy efficiency criteria 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:16.520
 and lower fuel consumption 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:19.520
 the new engine is capable of generating 75 horses 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:23.929
 power with gasoline and 82 horses 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:26.409
 with ethanol in relation to touch are 9.7 

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:29.060
 kilometer force meter with gasoline and 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:32.929
 10.4 kilograms-force meter with ethanol 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:35.659
 but 85% of the force is now available 

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:39.369
 from 2000 rpm, which improves the 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:39.369
 low-response vehicle responses 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:51.390
 the engine and the 211 1.0 liter has a block and 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:53.550
 the heads made of aluminum 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.380
 Three-cylinder construction means 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:59.160
 not only fewer components 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:01.890
 piston and bearings as well as 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:03.960
 less heat loss, which increases its 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:07.530
 thermal efficiency when compared to 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.869
 four-cylinder engine with four 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.300
 valves per cylinder, the cylinder head has 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:15.000
 variable intake control and has 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:17.610
 exhaust manifold integrated by remote 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.040
 one piece with liquid cooling 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.230
 and this allows the engine to reach its 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.390
 ideal operating temperature plus 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:28.230
 quickly improving their efficiency 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:31.860
 other innovative solution adopted 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:34.320
 on the engine and the 211 1.0 liter is the double 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.390
 cooling circuit and allows 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:40.350
 different temperatures for the block and 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:42.239
 for the head and the 211 1.0 liter is 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:44.880
 also the country's first engine in this 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:46.980
 range of engine capacity to be 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:51.050
 cold start and does not require 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.050
 of the auxiliary tank for gasoline 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:58.240
 fox 1.0 bluemotion combines the 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:01.000
 characteristics of 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:03.160
 fuel and energy efficiency. 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.050
 amazing performance for the model 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:08.350
 of this displacement range when 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:10.000
 fueled with 1.0 liter fox 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:13.630
 bluemotion accelerates from 0 to 100 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.480
 kilometers per hour in 13.5 seconds and 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:20.230
 reaches a maximum speed of 166 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:22.330
 kilometers per hour with ethanol are 13.2 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:25.570
 seconds for acceleration from 0 to 100 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:29.190
 kilometers per hour and 167 kilometers 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:29.190
 per hour of maximum speed 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:41.350
 blue motion technology applies 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:43.630
 also the mechanics and aesthetics of fox 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:44.709
 always focusing on the economy of 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:47.080
 fuel 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:49.630
 the electro-hydraulic steering feature 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:52.420
 offered as standard on the model reduces 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:54.010
 consumption by 3% when compared to the 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:56.079
 hydraulic steering 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:59.200
 the transmission had elongated relationships 

00:03:56.079 --> 00:04:03.040
 by up to 10% compared to that used in the 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:05.079
 fox 1.0 liter the measurement was made possible 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.750
 thanks to the increased torque 

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:09.310
 low spin regimes and this makes 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:12.640
 the engine to work at higher 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:14.620
 low the same speeds resulting 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:17.430
 lower fuel consumption and 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:17.430
 reduction in emissions 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:30.580
 the aerodynamics of fox google shampoo 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:33.669
 developed and certified in tunnel of 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:35.770
 wind every detail including the drawing 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:39.190
 was designed with the objective of 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:41.260
 to minimize aerodynamic drag to 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:44.080
 top grille are in the shape of a 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:46.000
 differentiated with exclusive design and 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:48.400
 narrower apertures 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.590
 the lower grid had its profile in the 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:52.510
 also altered allowing 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:54.790
 increased air flow 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:57.370
 this model uses low 

00:04:54.790 --> 00:05:00.010
 green called rolling resistance 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:02.620
 with the increase in the application of silica in 

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:04.570
 its composition the new model also 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:06.700
 received improvements in acoustic comfort 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:09.310
 with the use of greater and 

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:12.010
 mufflers in the exhaust system and 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:14.979
 insulation blanket on the body when the 

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:17.800
 all fox bluemotion is 29 pounds over 

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:19.900
 lightweight than the 1.0 liter version, which 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:26.200
 also contributes to lower consumption of 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:28.780
 fuel as a serial 

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:32.200
