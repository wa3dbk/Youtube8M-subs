00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
you that can just disappear and all

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.490 
you that can just disappear and all
you'd<00:01:35.759> have<00:01:35.790> are<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.180> teeth<00:01:36.420> right<00:01:36.869> and<00:01:37.140> so

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
you'd have are the teeth right and so

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.859 
you'd have are the teeth right and so
those<00:01:37.680> are<00:01:38.070> those<00:01:38.640> are<00:01:38.700> called<00:01:39.090> over<00:01:39.479> dentures

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
those are those are called over dentures

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.390 
those are those are called over dentures
and<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.079> patient<00:01:40.439> would<00:01:40.530> snap<00:01:40.799> them<00:01:41.040> in<00:01:41.189> and

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
and the patient would snap them in and

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.490 
and the patient would snap them in and
take<00:01:41.970> them<00:01:42.150> out<00:01:42.240> after<00:01:42.509> meals<00:01:42.869> and<00:01:43.079> clean<00:01:43.320> them

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
take them out after meals and clean them

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.319 
take them out after meals and clean them
and<00:01:43.710> then<00:01:43.829> put<00:01:44.009> them<00:01:44.130> back<00:01:44.189> in<00:01:44.579> and<00:01:44.759> it's<00:01:45.240> a

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
and then put them back in and it's a

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.149 
and then put them back in and it's a
very<00:01:45.570> very<00:01:45.630> simple<00:01:46.229> procedure<00:01:46.500> for<00:01:46.920> them<00:01:47.040> to

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
very very simple procedure for them to

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.609 
very very simple procedure for them to
do<00:01:47.340> that<00:01:47.549> now<00:01:48.180> there's<00:01:48.720> another<00:01:48.840> alternative

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
do that now there's another alternative

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.350 
do that now there's another alternative
where<00:01:50.100> somebody<00:01:50.490> really<00:01:50.670> doesn't<00:01:51.149> want<00:01:51.270> to

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
where somebody really doesn't want to

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.760 
where somebody really doesn't want to
even<00:01:51.450> deal<00:01:51.810> with<00:01:51.840> it<00:01:52.110> doesn't<00:01:52.409> want<00:01:52.530> to<00:01:52.619> take

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
even deal with it doesn't want to take

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.139 
even deal with it doesn't want to take
them<00:01:53.009> out<00:01:53.130> at<00:01:53.250> all<00:01:53.369> just<00:01:53.610> wants<00:01:53.790> to<00:01:53.880> brush

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149

we<00:02:00.299> have<00:02:00.450> a<00:02:00.479> thing<00:02:00.780> that's<00:02:00.930> like<00:02:01.170> a<00:02:01.229> hybrid

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
we have a thing that's like a hybrid

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.969 
we have a thing that's like a hybrid
hybrid<00:02:02.399> bridge<00:02:02.909> or<00:02:03.360> hybrid<00:02:03.869> denture<00:02:04.320> and<00:02:04.500> this

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
hybrid bridge or hybrid denture and this

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.490 
hybrid bridge or hybrid denture and this
is<00:02:05.130> an<00:02:05.250> example<00:02:05.340> of<00:02:05.969> what<00:02:06.750> we<00:02:06.869> do<00:02:07.020> we<00:02:07.200> take<00:02:07.350> the

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
is an example of what we do we take the

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.020 
is an example of what we do we take the
entire<00:02:07.799> palette<00:02:08.340> out<00:02:08.459> of<00:02:08.580> the<00:02:08.670> roof<00:02:08.849> of<00:02:08.970> the

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
entire palette out of the roof of the

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.750 
entire palette out of the roof of the
mouth<00:02:09.060> we<00:02:09.869> put<00:02:10.110> these<00:02:10.259> little<00:02:10.860> plastic

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
mouth we put these little plastic

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.180 
mouth we put these little plastic
keepers<00:02:12.450> in<00:02:12.690> the<00:02:12.840> den

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
keepers in the den

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.600 
keepers in the den
and<00:02:13.930> we<00:02:14.930> fabricate<00:02:15.740> this<00:02:15.890> so<00:02:16.100> that<00:02:16.250> it<00:02:16.370> snaps

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
and we fabricate this so that it snaps

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.120 
and we fabricate this so that it snaps
onto<00:02:16.940> the<00:02:17.180> mini<00:02:17.390> implants<00:02:17.870> and<00:02:18.350> the<00:02:18.890> next

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
onto the mini implants and the next

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.000 
onto the mini implants and the next
proceed<00:02:19.520> next<00:02:19.790> slide<00:02:20.390> will<00:02:20.630> show<00:02:20.660> these<00:02:21.620> mini

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
proceed next slide will show these mini

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.010 
proceed next slide will show these mini
dental<00:02:22.250> implants<00:02:22.880> in<00:02:23.120> place<00:02:23.360> and<00:02:23.720> in<00:02:23.870> this

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
dental implants in place and in this

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.380 
dental implants in place and in this
case<00:02:24.260> we've<00:02:24.530> got<00:02:24.710> 12<00:02:25.460> of<00:02:25.700> them<00:02:25.820> but<00:02:26.000> you<00:02:26.120> really

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
case we've got 12 of them but you really

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.930 
case we've got 12 of them but you really
only<00:02:26.540> need<00:02:26.660> eight<00:02:26.930> to<00:02:27.110> ten<00:02:27.350> of<00:02:27.680> these<00:02:28.220> posts<00:02:28.790> to

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
only need eight to ten of these posts to

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.170 
only need eight to ten of these posts to
do<00:02:29.090> this<00:02:29.270> procedure<00:02:29.510> and<00:02:30.040> it's<00:02:31.040> done<00:02:31.370> again<00:02:31.730> no

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
do this procedure and it's done again no

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.780 
do this procedure and it's done again no
surgery<00:02:32.480> no<00:02:32.870> cutting<00:02:33.290> no<00:02:33.320> stitches<00:02:34.010> and<00:02:34.250> the
