00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:00.540 
don't know what's I don't know what's in
it<00:04:56.969> but<00:04:58.320> it's<00:04:59.320> inherently<00:04:59.889> effective<00:05:00.370> it's

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:00.550 
it but it's inherently effective it's

magic

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:01.150 
magic

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:03.269

I<00:05:01.180> did<00:05:01.479> my<00:05:01.599> desensitizing<00:05:02.349> gel<00:05:02.529> after<00:05:02.740> she<00:05:03.159> was

00:05:03.269 --> 00:05:03.279 
I did my desensitizing gel after she was

00:05:03.279 --> 00:05:04.740 
I did my desensitizing gel after she was
explaining<00:05:03.460> how<00:05:03.669> she<00:05:03.729> did<00:05:04.000> her<00:05:04.090> as<00:05:04.180> before

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:04.750

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:07.270 
so after I did my whitening I did my

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:09.060 
so after I did my whitening I did my
desensitizing<00:05:08.050> because<00:05:08.320> I<00:05:08.500> wouldn't<00:05:08.919> be<00:05:08.979> able

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:09.070 
desensitizing because I wouldn't be able
