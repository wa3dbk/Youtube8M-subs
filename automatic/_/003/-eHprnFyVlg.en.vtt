00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:04.939
 that was my first right 

00:00:10.789 --> 00:00:17.550
 what the people my name was benny 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:20.880
 usually welcome to horizon 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.770
 when people in the video of advance wars yes 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.360
 as we said , we play on horizon 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:26.300
 team deathmatch and today I want to go 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:30.480
 that sniper test 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:32.970
 yes that's so many are big fans 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.199
 from sniper general or trick it 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.879
 yes there are many tricks plan 

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:38.460
 It will not be like this anymore 

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:39.769
 it is at least possible that it is loud 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.789
 for the moment 

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:42.780
 It will not be so possible here 

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:46.320
 to doubt that 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.449
 but I can tell you that 's just 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.910
 at the exoskeleton at all that it pretty much 

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:52.920
 quickly meet people and do tricks too 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.510
 but it will be a player mode 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.460
 go where the exoskeleton does not allow 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.500
 or is there again look where it is 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.090
 but that's what I heard but me 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.140
 still want to try normal here 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.030
 kids rattle off 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.090
 At the moment I have only the sniper 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.759
 and there I was not there anybody else 

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:11.479
 yes, shit was not so good 

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:13.619
 we actually still have two kills 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:15.509
 I have I go really negative with 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.080
 the sniper i'm not that good at here 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.720
 not everything 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.250
 I'll take a quick look at 8 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.380
 Sensitivity I will use 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.280
 if you want quick scoping i know 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.250
 not exactly if it works here 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:29.099
 so you can stop the air ok on the 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.270
 send button so you can not do that 

00:01:29.099 --> 00:01:34.800
 Stop breathing as normal as a 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:36.450
 cds so far to 1 we had then too 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.899
 thank you very much my friend thank you for 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.580
 nickel 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:40.110
 I have to yes so have to look 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.310
 Of course, fighting is one of them 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.099
 especially here if the whole 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.440
 tour mosquitoes is nothing normal 

00:01:44.099 --> 00:01:48.810
 I mean nothing abnormal, of course 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:52.830
 Of course , it's not so high 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.910
 problem with the exoskeleton so shepherd 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:54.420
 the back must always be pretty film 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:58.879
 for sure 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.879
 that's why someone is not sure where 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:02.759
 usa up there that is unfortunately not 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.459
 I also know this map 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.080
 not the first time the first time in 

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:09.570
 my life and he was invisible 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.009
 The choice visible there is one can here 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:16.530
 but you become invisible but you have seen 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:17.790
 it looks like it's already visible 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.590
 a bit late i can do a little bit 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.550
 Look more because I have twice as much 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.540
 of both I do not know maybe 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.780
 because I do not want or something 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:27.120
 i do not think that's a team made 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:31.160
 okay for change already teammate with 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:34.470
 adolescent age no idea what's going on 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:38.340
 or do not go up there above me 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:39.450
 Carry I try to suck you 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.690
 have to react faster 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:46.200
 no no I wanted to come to the wrong 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.550
 one must often four to two of 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.990
 that's not so easy I have to 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:52.830
 say sorry here you will be a problem 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:57.420
 so it's way too action easy 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:59.790
 i mean kids my next 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.959
 action packed things but snipers will 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.430
 a small problem I have to be fit 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:05.220
 I say about the whole fourth game 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.570
 now my fourth game so i play 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.310
 and I'm at the beginning of everything 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:10.560
 Normally I would be the first game 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:13.130
 take holy moly do you want me 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:16.890
 my hands are already sweaty sweat 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:19.320
 my goodness that's unbelievable 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.070
 one so i still try pakets 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.220
 abzubekommen 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:24.420
 but it is not easy because 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.340
 I am here so much movement I know 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.390
 not exactly if I'm wrong if I am 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.310
 get to know the game a bit more 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:30.090
 but usually it has to 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.569
 be logical 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.129
 too much movement 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:35.260
 he just is not good for sniper 

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:37.060
 not good I do not know what the 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.469
 steak from here drive first impression 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.329
 if you already have the game or 

00:03:38.469 --> 00:03:42.609
 if you do not have her in the video 

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:45.310
 yes yes, especially here I can not 

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:54.099
 I have totally disadvantage because I 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:54.400
 yes no no no no no that was 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:57.400
 just 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:59.019
 that was very close course, I know 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.639
 I'm so high up there 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:02.560
 remember the lower ones I find 

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:05.620
 it was done if you get here too 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:07.209
 I noticed less, less 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.439
 I can do my data about me too 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:12.040
 Rarely because I somehow to the 

00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:13.469
 can get used to canadian and a healthy 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.879
 it is not really to stay 

00:04:13.469 --> 00:04:17.889
 recommended because then loses the 

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:19.209
 Overview and you need the overview 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:21.690
 because they can come from everywhere yes 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:24.070
 you can see the overview then 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:25.090
 someone is running over him so a healthy 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:29.770
 stay is nothing 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:31.660
 holy shit that's had full hardt old 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:33.009
 I try to get the package with 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:33.400
 of course, there is a lot going on with normal weapons 

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:36.220
 easier 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:38.620
 I've also never played but 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:39.729
 I do not have to say the maps 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:40.659
 Of course everything is very complicated 

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:43.180
 built up 

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:45.880
 and yes you will have a long long time 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:48.960
 need to get used to here then 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.960
 because I really am not easy 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:53.729
 I do not know 

00:04:55.569 --> 00:04:59.710
 that was my first war scope so 

00:04:57.039 --> 00:05:05.619
 was more important than cool war comes 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:06.789
 I have to say that very slowly to the book 

00:05:05.619 --> 00:05:12.279
 Do not forget to do it 

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:13.479
 comes davidmarx So gibt's also 

00:05:12.279 --> 00:05:14.649
 Brand but I think I even have it 

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:17.679
 really hit in the leg 

00:05:14.649 --> 00:05:22.509
 I'm not saying anything because you have to 

00:05:17.679 --> 00:05:25.300
 yes almost in upper body then meet 

00:05:22.509 --> 00:05:29.439
 to be able to have someone to 18 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:30.939
 euro my god as I said my first 

00:05:29.439 --> 00:05:32.889
 times on this map with that sniper and 

00:05:30.939 --> 00:05:39.360
 Since when is not so easy 

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:39.360
 I will act cautiously careful 

00:05:41.309 --> 00:05:45.909
 time I see her that the card 

00:05:43.719 --> 00:05:47.080
 I find love but very much back there 

00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:49.300
 Interestingly, only the ones on 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:52.509
 attack zone but if it comes from there 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:53.679
 then the opponents come from there too 

00:05:52.509 --> 00:05:56.469
 definitely you can suffer here so 

00:05:53.679 --> 00:05:57.189
 you can not even think ah 

00:05:56.469 --> 00:06:02.249
 but one more 

00:05:57.189 --> 00:06:05.289
 my goodness that I was so sorry that 

00:06:02.249 --> 00:06:07.089
 I sweat I know when I sweat 

00:06:05.289 --> 00:06:09.519
 if I find that if I doubt it 

00:06:07.089 --> 00:06:14.860
 a bit oh sucks 

00:06:09.519 --> 00:06:22.659
 we even lose one's clear one 

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:24.219
 I think you can aka me hello he 

00:06:22.659 --> 00:06:29.830
 He did not want to say he will not cry 

00:06:24.219 --> 00:06:30.819
 do what he did not want to be so i can 

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:33.969
 Do not tell me how my son 

00:06:30.819 --> 00:06:36.930
 wanted to be here for a long time yes camera 

00:06:33.969 --> 00:06:36.930
 Nokia the door opens 

00:06:41.789 --> 00:06:47.620
 yes that was the new gameplay it has 

00:06:45.639 --> 00:06:49.090
 really know muslims by heart 

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:51.520
 you can sluiter like you have the map 

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:54.039
 by heart I know good as a medium 

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:57.759
 sniper would say it really is not 

00:06:54.039 --> 00:07:00.060
 so simply for the reason that 

00:06:57.759 --> 00:07:02.080
 everything is going very fast and 

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:03.819
 yes I would have been there on the 

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:06.069
 have to fall back on mode where you can not 

00:07:03.819 --> 00:07:08.800
 so can jump or not jump at all 

00:07:06.069 --> 00:07:10.419
 can where there is no exoskeleton because yes 

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:14.979
 that gets pretty problematic 

00:07:10.419 --> 00:07:16.330
 that's a pity, but that's a pity 

00:07:14.979 --> 00:07:19.020
 it was perhaps what his look and 

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:19.020
 until the next video
