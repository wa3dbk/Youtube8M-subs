00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
going to be a little short if you cut it

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:34.880 
going to be a little short if you cut it
too<00:00:33.480> much<00:00:33.660> of<00:00:33.809> an<00:00:33.899> angle<00:00:34.050> then<00:00:34.410> your<00:00:34.559> piece<00:00:34.739> is

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
too much of an angle then your piece is

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.549 
too much of an angle then your piece is
too<00:00:35.040> long<00:00:35.250> so<00:00:36.030> I<00:00:36.059> like<00:00:36.329> to<00:00:36.360> go<00:00:36.600> at<00:00:36.809> just<00:00:37.020> a<00:00:37.140> very

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
too long so I like to go at just a very

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.709 
too long so I like to go at just a very
slight<00:00:37.980> angle<00:00:38.309> and<00:00:38.670> really<00:00:39.180> this<00:00:39.300> is<00:00:39.450> up<00:00:39.570> to

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
slight angle and really this is up to

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.060 
slight angle and really this is up to
you<00:00:39.780> but<00:00:40.020> I'm<00:00:40.290> just<00:00:40.350> going<00:00:40.530> to<00:00:40.590> turn<00:00:40.770> a<00:00:40.829> knife

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
you but I'm just going to turn a knife

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.130 
you but I'm just going to turn a knife
just<00:00:41.309> a<00:00:41.430> hair<00:00:41.700> so<00:00:42.420> they're<00:00:42.570> a<00:00:42.600> little<00:00:42.809> bigger

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
just a hair so they're a little bigger

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.010 
just a hair so they're a little bigger
than<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:43.530> width<00:00:43.710> of<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:43.980> bread<00:00:44.660> so<00:00:45.660> something

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
than the width of the bread so something

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.900 
than the width of the bread so something
like<00:00:46.050> that<00:00:46.350> all<00:00:46.860> right<00:00:47.010> now<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.730> most

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
like that all right now the most

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.670 
like that all right now the most
important<00:00:48.390> thing<00:00:48.420> here<00:00:48.570> really<00:00:49.170> isn't<00:00:49.559> so

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
important thing here really isn't so

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.040 
important thing here really isn't so
much<00:00:49.739> length<00:00:50.129> it's<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.940> height<00:00:51.149> because

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
much length it's the height because

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:52.910 
much length it's the height because
we're<00:00:52.260> going<00:00:52.350> to<00:00:52.440> put<00:00:52.559> these<00:00:52.649> under<00:00:52.800> the

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
we're going to put these under the

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.560 
we're going to put these under the
broiler<00:00:53.219> and<00:00:53.579> if<00:00:53.760> some<00:00:53.940> are<00:00:53.969> taller<00:00:54.300> than

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
broiler and if some are taller than

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.689 
broiler and if some are taller than
others<00:00:54.840> they're<00:00:55.260> going<00:00:55.350> to<00:00:55.440> brown<00:00:55.620> faster<00:00:56.100> so

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
others they're going to brown faster so

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:57.740 
others they're going to brown faster so
I<00:00:56.730> want<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:56.940> make<00:00:57.000> sure<00:00:57.120> we<00:00:57.300> get<00:00:57.390> those<00:00:57.510> pretty

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750
