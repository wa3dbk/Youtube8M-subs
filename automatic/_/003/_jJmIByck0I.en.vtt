00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:05.080
 breakdown 

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:18.850
 there is something that does not turn 

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:20.680
 round big christ the speed records 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:23.200
 of our cars have not moved a 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.420
 second since yesterday yet I have them 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.130
 all revised hood tires at 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:29.080
 stiffness in the fingers to force 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.369
 to set engines there must be 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:33.040
 have an explanation 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:34.630
 I have a small question is what you 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.160
 are thinking of using the superb 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:38.350
 computer that I bought you for 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.150
 settle our poles says I use them 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.100
 from time to time to stall the doors 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:44.140
 but I much prefer to listen and 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.790
 feel what's going on in the engine I 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.440
 do not interest me that you listen that you 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:49.000
 sense of what's going on in the engines 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.740
 of our champions all the others 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.630
 circuits use computers for 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:55.540
 to be sure that cars are in full 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:57.400
 shape and you do the same thing I'm going 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.110
 go to the workshop in ten minutes 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.930
 so do not forget to go out 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:05.430
 the computer and turn it on a name of a 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.430
 adjustable wrench it promises 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.320
 what happens when chris 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.550
 sir big under wants to show how 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:15.440
 use the computer 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:16.700
 you already know how to search the shore I 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.980
 see that you have borrowed the 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:23.240
 combination of marina she is a little 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:25.640
 tight and pink I'll show you how 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:28.990
 you set a motor precisely 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:32.450
 my little max to you other figures 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:34.730
 look good just connect 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:38.270
 the computer to max motor like those 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:40.190
 this is then the computer we 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.110
 exactly what max needs for 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:44.570
 to go even faster 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:47.390
 we only have to do but 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.790
 it is the impression that this computer is going 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.979
 do the work for you you know a 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.960
 computer it's just a tool it's 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:55.910
 all that matters is the one who 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.950
 press the button and that's it I think 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:59.600
 it's time to put the maxim back on 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.460
 the track I'm sure this time my 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.180
 champion will succeed in breaking his record 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.560
 of speed 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.360
 that's it you want but it will not do 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.400
 no difference max was already 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.880
 perfectly adjusted but if it can you 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.880
 to please
