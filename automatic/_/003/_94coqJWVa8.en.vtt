00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 welcome to shizanuty review with 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:06.150
 you Nikitos let's discuss rather 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.309
 just now the image is muddy but i 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.570
 I promised to write down all the reviews so I 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.610
 I can't postpone the next day 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.150
 so it will be necessary to buy a new one 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.070
 the camera 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.529
 if you help me with it by the way I 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.900
 I will be very grateful to you 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:22.800
 all the same I will post all wallets and so on 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.390
 because most difficult hard for me here 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.789
 if you help 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:32.539
 and then the picture quality will improve and 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:32.539
 everything will get better this chapter 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:38.859
 again again how great it is in a row 

00:00:36.609 --> 00:00:43.089
 so many heads ohrenitelnyh so I do 

00:00:38.859 --> 00:00:46.420
 I am now dragging two parts that I 

00:00:43.089 --> 00:00:47.940
 liked the most 1 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.309
 sasuke 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.039
 This is creative in that chapter. 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.839
 I thought the hell dick emule dzhuga general in 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:58.409
 his susanna 

00:00:53.839 --> 00:01:01.050
 that's cool it turns out now he even 

00:00:58.409 --> 00:01:03.269
 not necessarily here that it turns out that 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.119
 when I got the damned seal 

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:09.540
 thought that sasuke became weaker and now 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:12.570
 it turns out that in general is great because 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:15.780
 sasuke had a damn seal when you 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.130
 you use it you spend your strength on 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.850
 actually because damn print 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:23.399
 this is such a bullshit plus and this is not your strength 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.110
 this is borrowed from a friend is obtained and 

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:28.080
 you somehow adapt to it so 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.909
 less here and he would have to think about 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.069
 many things in parallel like naruto 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.020
 for example he has to collect then somehow 

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:37.770
 her control is hemorrhoids at the very 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:41.780
 In fact, he is a jogger, he is fine 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:44.130
 he collects a genius in this and gives him 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:48.840
 all this damn seal 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:51.360
 Susanna in damn the press fucking 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.640
 This is what I just could not imagine 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:59.280
 how creative it is 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:01.979
 here it is it call saul red damn I'm 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.920
 in the end, so said cool cool 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.869
 cool cool general cool damn here 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.700
 this one 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:12.480
 nipples here I began to respect as creatine 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:15.209
 what a young man and now they both can 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.700
 with naruto attack excellent and this 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:21.590
 problem for upholstered they are awesome 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:25.440
 hit us showed how he just 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:27.840
 put the block but did not show punched 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.610
 Liliana to us in my opinion but should have been 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.640
 punch what the fuck is this block 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.890
 then unreal and the memory of the first 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:38.760
 hokage it was so cool too and you 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:41.280
 what saw the first as the first of all kage 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:44.970
 different such all interesting cool 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:47.040
 how do they communicate with each other and and 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.950
 didn't really come to the universal 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:52.709
 contract but the first hokage is so 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:55.890
 strongly wanted to fulfill his dream 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:59.250
 to just beg them please give 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.470
 give me a chance give us all a chance go to 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.980
 all conditions 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.490
 and let it be an agreement agreement 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:07.490
 already 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:09.800
 but in my opinion as it was not 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:12.800
 very cool not very right because 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:15.590
 that all the same agreement should be 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:18.470
 mutual should all really come 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.970
 agree with him and not what we argue 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.290
 argue and then suddenly one person says 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:23.750
 well please well please me very 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:26.680
 I want to agree, let's all 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:29.750
 but okay, it's not like Feng Shui 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:32.630
 some kind of contract is not very good FIG figs 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:35.180
 he was not cool that he remembered 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:39.190
 this and we saw it again cool that 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:41.680
 universal connection and everyone saw him 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:44.450
 memories and how it all began 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:47.300
 originated what goal was set and 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:49.580
 still damn cool and adac and please 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:51.970
 realize my dream descendants you see 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:56.390
 what was it all for I started it all 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:57.980
 please don't screw it up don't have everything 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:00.880
 it is like this to trample into the ground 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:03.530
 try and on this background still here 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:05.720
 this dream came true all parallel 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:09.650
 freeze on this background all kage come 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:13.630
 Bamians are continued to be guys 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:16.459
 I just trudge on 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:19.549
