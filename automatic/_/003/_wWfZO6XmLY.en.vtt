00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.630 
playing all of them i think i think
four-handed<00:01:31.890> might<00:01:32.040> be<00:01:32.160> the<00:01:32.250> most<00:01:32.370> funnest

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
four-handed might be the most funnest

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.210 
four-handed might be the most funnest
Foreman<00:01:33.090> I've<00:01:33.180> played<00:01:33.390> least<00:01:33.630> of<00:01:33.840> I<00:01:34.590> guess

nine<00:01:35.400> handed<00:01:35.670> maybe<00:01:36.150> second<00:01:36.600> at<00:01:37.350> least<00:01:37.560> but

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
nine handed maybe second at least but

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.010 
nine handed maybe second at least but
four<00:01:38.490> handed<00:01:38.790> I<00:01:38.850> haven't<00:01:39.090> played<00:01:39.240> much<00:01:39.270> of<00:01:39.720> and

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
four handed I haven't played much of and

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.150 
four handed I haven't played much of and
I<00:01:40.080> think<00:01:40.260> a<00:01:40.350> lot<00:01:40.470> of<00:01:40.500> people<00:01:40.590> haven't<00:01:41.010> either

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:41.160 
I think a lot of people haven't either

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.490 
I think a lot of people haven't either
and<00:01:41.430> I<00:01:41.490> like<00:01:41.910> trying<00:01:42.210> to<00:01:42.330> figure<00:01:42.540> new<00:01:43.470> things

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
and I like trying to figure new things

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.410 
and I like trying to figure new things
out<00:01:43.830> like<00:01:43.950> that<00:01:44.100> but<00:01:44.310> really<00:01:44.550> I<00:01:44.880> think<00:01:44.970> people

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
out like that but really I think people

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.930 
out like that but really I think people
over<00:01:45.780> adjust<00:01:46.110> honestly<00:01:46.620> I<00:01:46.650> think<00:01:46.940> pokers

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:47.940 
over adjust honestly I think pokers

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.270 
over adjust honestly I think pokers
