00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.280 
tube will fit in there the fit setup
we've<00:01:35.490> got<00:01:35.670> you<00:01:35.939> know<00:01:36.060> a<00:01:36.329> frame<00:01:36.689> comes<00:01:37.110> in

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
we've got you know a frame comes in

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.990 
we've got you know a frame comes in
basically<00:01:37.770> six<00:01:38.070> sizes<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.549> same<00:01:38.729> as<00:01:38.850> we've

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
basically six sizes the same as we've

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.690 
basically six sizes the same as we've
had<00:01:39.119> in<00:01:39.420> all<00:01:39.570> of<00:01:39.689> our<00:01:39.750> triathlon<00:01:40.290> bikes<00:01:40.500> but<00:01:41.220> it

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
had in all of our triathlon bikes but it

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.880 
had in all of our triathlon bikes but it
hits<00:01:41.970> a<00:01:42.060> wider<00:01:42.329> range<00:01:42.630> of<00:01:42.750> people<00:01:42.810> we<00:01:43.649> do<00:01:43.770> that

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
hits a wider range of people we do that

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.649 
hits a wider range of people we do that
with<00:01:44.009> two<00:01:44.159> ways<00:01:44.340> one<00:01:44.670> is<00:01:44.729> with<00:01:44.939> the<00:01:45.030> frame<00:01:45.329> but

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
with two ways one is with the frame but

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.240 
with two ways one is with the frame but
also<00:01:45.810> it's<00:01:46.079> designed<00:01:46.439> with<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.799> Aero<00:01:46.979> bar

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
also it's designed with the Aero bar

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.609 
also it's designed with the Aero bar
together<00:01:47.460> to<00:01:48.240> offer<00:01:48.360> a<00:01:48.540> very<00:01:48.840> very<00:01:49.049> wide<00:01:49.290> range

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
together to offer a very very wide range

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.050 
together to offer a very very wide range
of<00:01:49.770> fit<00:01:50.040> so<00:01:50.250> you<00:01:50.310> can<00:01:50.430> get<00:01:50.520> as<00:01:50.640> low<00:01:50.820> as<00:01:50.939> you<00:01:51.000> want

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
of fit so you can get as low as you want

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.389 
of fit so you can get as low as you want
as<00:01:51.390> you<00:01:51.840> could<00:01:52.200> traditionally<00:01:52.649> get<00:01:52.799> on<00:01:52.920> a<00:01:52.979> p4

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
as you could traditionally get on a p4

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.580 
as you could traditionally get on a p4
so<00:01:53.729> very<00:01:54.000> low<00:01:54.180> position<00:01:54.360> but<00:01:55.229> you<00:01:55.320> can<00:01:55.439> also

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
so very low position but you can also

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.350 
so very low position but you can also
get<00:01:55.920> basically<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:56.640> same<00:01:56.820> position<00:01:57.210> you<00:01:57.240> can

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
get basically the same position you can

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.030 
get basically the same position you can
get<00:01:57.450> on<00:01:57.570> a<00:01:57.630> p2<00:01:57.960> which<00:01:58.110> is<00:01:58.229> a<00:01:58.259> very<00:01:58.469> high<00:01:58.649> fitting

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
get on a p2 which is a very high fitting

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.370 
get on a p2 which is a very high fitting

back from the neutral position well if
we<00:02:38.510> look<00:02:38.630> at<00:02:38.780> the<00:02:38.930> the<00:02:39.010> frame<00:02:40.010> itself<00:02:40.310> and

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550 
we look at the the frame itself and

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.280 
we look at the the frame itself and
combine<00:02:40.880> that<00:02:41.030> with<00:02:41.090> the<00:02:41.300> Aero<00:02:41.510> bar<00:02:41.780> you

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
combine that with the Aero bar you

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.140 
combine that with the Aero bar you
basically<00:02:42.560> got<00:02:42.680> three<00:02:43.100> macro<00:02:43.580> settings<00:02:44.000> they

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
basically got three macro settings they

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:45.880 
basically got three macro settings they
can<00:02:44.300> get<00:02:44.450> on<00:02:44.570> the<00:02:44.690> Aero<00:02:44.840> bar<00:02:45.080> so<00:02:45.590> it<00:02:45.650> goes<00:02:45.770> from

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
can get on the Aero bar so it goes from

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.610 
can get on the Aero bar so it goes from
extremely<00:02:46.370> low<00:02:46.580> to<00:02:47.270> a<00:02:47.630> regular<00:02:47.990> low<00:02:48.140> position

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
extremely low to a regular low position

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.560 
extremely low to a regular low position
and<00:02:48.860> then<00:02:49.010> a<00:02:49.040> high<00:02:49.250> V<00:02:49.580> position<00:02:49.610> which<00:02:50.240> uses

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:50.570 
and then a high V position which uses

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:53.110 
and then a high V position which uses
these<00:02:50.720> twin<00:02:51.110> v<00:02:51.500> tails<00:02:51.800> to<00:02:52.460> get<00:02:52.610> to<00:02:52.790> a<00:02:52.820> very<00:02:52.940> high

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
these twin v tails to get to a very high

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.940 
these twin v tails to get to a very high
position<00:02:53.300> but<00:02:53.720> not<00:02:53.870> sacrifice<00:02:54.110> aerodynamics

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
position but not sacrifice aerodynamics

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:56.950 
position but not sacrifice aerodynamics
to<00:02:55.010> get<00:02:55.220> to<00:02:55.370> it<00:02:55.490> then<00:02:56.180> you've<00:02:56.300> got<00:02:56.420> a<00:02:56.450> kind<00:02:56.810> of<00:02:56.900> a

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:56.960 
to get to it then you've got a kind of a

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:59.650 
to get to it then you've got a kind of a
micro<00:02:57.320> adjustment<00:02:57.970> spacer<00:02:58.970> set<00:02:59.150> up<00:02:59.270> below

micro adjustment spacer set up below

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.660 
micro adjustment spacer set up below
that<00:02:59.900> so<00:03:00.230> you<00:03:00.320> can<00:03:00.410> get<00:03:00.470> even<00:03:00.680> higher<00:03:01.160> yet<00:03:01.430> and

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
that so you can get even higher yet and

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.000 
that so you can get even higher yet and
fine-tune<00:03:02.300> your<00:03:02.450> position<00:03:02.870> the<00:03:03.500> brakes<00:03:03.830> are

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
fine-tune your position the brakes are

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.220 
fine-tune your position the brakes are

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
who are the leaders in hydraulic brakes

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.180 
who are the leaders in hydraulic brakes
and<00:03:08.240> we<00:03:08.870> did<00:03:09.020> all<00:03:09.050> the<00:03:09.260> Aero<00:03:09.440> development<00:03:10.010> they

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
and we did all the Aero development they

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:11.680 
and we did all the Aero development they
did<00:03:10.340> all<00:03:10.430> the<00:03:10.550> hydraulic<00:03:11.000> development<00:03:11.480> to

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
did all the hydraulic development to

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:13.450 
did all the hydraulic development to
make<00:03:11.780> this<00:03:11.990> brake<00:03:12.200> possible<00:03:12.710> under<00:03:13.340> this

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:13.460 
make this brake possible under this

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:15.790 
make this brake possible under this
cover<00:03:13.790> is<00:03:14.030> the<00:03:14.540> front<00:03:14.780> hydraulic<00:03:15.380> brake<00:03:15.590> it's

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:15.800 
cover is the front hydraulic brake it's

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.620 
cover is the front hydraulic brake it's
the<00:03:15.890> identical<00:03:16.280> caliper<00:03:16.820> under<00:03:17.390> the<00:03:17.480> bottom

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
the identical caliper under the bottom

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.540 
the identical caliper under the bottom
bracket<00:03:17.870> under<00:03:18.290> its<00:03:18.380> own<00:03:18.500> cover<00:03:18.770> the<00:03:19.340> only

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:19.550 
bracket under its own cover the only

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:21.220 
bracket under its own cover the only
difference<00:03:19.850> is<00:03:19.970> the<00:03:20.090> bolt<00:03:20.270> length<00:03:20.540> speaking

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
difference is the bolt length speaking

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.260 
difference is the bolt length speaking
of<00:03:21.350> bolts<00:03:21.650> the<00:03:22.130> Magura<00:03:22.489> hydraulic<00:03:23.060> brake

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:23.270 
of bolts the Magura hydraulic brake

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:25.690 
of bolts the Magura hydraulic brake
mounts<00:03:24.140> just<00:03:24.500> like<00:03:24.709> a<00:03:24.739> traditional<00:03:24.950> caliper

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
mounts just like a traditional caliper

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.580 
mounts just like a traditional caliper
so<00:03:26.180> for<00:03:26.540> some<00:03:26.720> reason<00:03:27.050> you<00:03:27.140> don't<00:03:27.320> want<00:03:27.440> to<00:03:27.500> use

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
so for some reason you don't want to use

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:28.870 
so for some reason you don't want to use
the<00:03:27.709> hydraulic<00:03:28.100> brake<00:03:28.280> you<00:03:28.459> can<00:03:28.610> put<00:03:28.760> on<00:03:28.850> a

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:28.880 
the hydraulic brake you can put on a

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.570 
the hydraulic brake you can put on a
standard<00:03:29.360> front<00:03:29.570> brake<00:03:29.780> and<00:03:29.989> a<00:03:30.530> TRP<00:03:31.040> brake<00:03:31.400> on

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:31.580 
standard front brake and a TRP brake on

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:33.820 
standard front brake and a TRP brake on
the<00:03:31.670> back<00:03:31.820> this<00:03:32.720> brake<00:03:33.080> system<00:03:33.470> including<00:03:33.800> the

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:33.830 
the back this brake system including the

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:35.620 
the back this brake system including the
lever<00:03:34.130> the<00:03:34.220> line<00:03:34.640> and<00:03:34.880> the<00:03:34.940> caliper<00:03:35.239> the<00:03:35.480> whole

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:35.630 
lever the line and the caliper the whole

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:37.780 
lever the line and the caliper the whole
thing<00:03:35.870> filled<00:03:36.140> with<00:03:36.260> oil<00:03:36.410> weighs<00:03:37.160> less<00:03:37.520> than

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790 
thing filled with oil weighs less than

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.060 
thing filled with oil weighs less than
either<00:03:37.880> dura-ace<00:03:38.239> or<00:03:38.660> SRAM<00:03:38.959> as<00:03:39.170> a<00:03:39.230> system<00:03:39.920> so

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:40.070 
either dura-ace or SRAM as a system so

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:41.530 
either dura-ace or SRAM as a system so
it's<00:03:40.190> very<00:03:40.340> light<00:03:40.640> but<00:03:41.090> the<00:03:41.239> biggest

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
it's very light but the biggest

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.810 
it's very light but the biggest
advantage<00:03:42.140> is<00:03:42.260> its<00:03:42.440> aerodynamic<00:03:43.160> drag<00:03:43.520> is

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:43.820 
advantage is its aerodynamic drag is

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:45.520 
advantage is its aerodynamic drag is
reduced<00:03:44.180> over<00:03:44.780> the<00:03:44.870> last<00:03:44.989> few<00:03:45.170> years<00:03:45.380> we've

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
reduced over the last few years we've

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:47.140 
reduced over the last few years we've
found<00:03:45.770> that<00:03:45.980> we<00:03:46.340> are<00:03:46.430> starting<00:03:46.670> to<00:03:46.760> understand

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 
found that we are starting to understand

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:48.910 
found that we are starting to understand
the<00:03:47.270> airflow<00:03:47.660> around<00:03:47.870> the<00:03:48.260> bike<00:03:48.410> better<00:03:48.650> by

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920 
the airflow around the bike better by

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.310 
the airflow around the bike better by
using<00:03:49.100> CFD<00:03:49.670> in<00:03:50.120> a<00:03:50.239> computational<00:03:51.200> fluid

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:51.320 
using CFD in a computational fluid

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:53.740 
using CFD in a computational fluid
dynamics<00:03:51.920> in<00:03:52.100> a<00:03:52.520> much<00:03:52.670> more<00:03:52.820> broader<00:03:53.150> sense<00:03:53.480> so

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
dynamics in a much more broader sense so

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:55.750 
dynamics in a much more broader sense so
we<00:03:53.870> hired<00:03:54.110> a<00:03:54.260> full-time<00:03:54.520> aerodynamicist<00:03:55.520> and

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760 
we hired a full-time aerodynamicist and

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.120 
we hired a full-time aerodynamicist and
we<00:03:56.360> spend<00:03:56.660> basically<00:03:56.840> a<00:03:57.110> year<00:03:57.350> developing<00:03:57.709> the

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:58.130 
we spend basically a year developing the

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:59.650 
we spend basically a year developing the
CFD<00:03:58.550> software<00:03:58.760> so<00:03:59.120> we're<00:03:59.239> getting<00:03:59.360> really

00:03:59.650 --> 00:03:59.660 
CFD software so we're getting really

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:01.210 
CFD software so we're getting really
really<00:03:59.900> accurate<00:04:00.350> results<00:04:00.709> the<00:04:00.800> same<00:04:01.010> as<00:04:01.130> we

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:01.220 
really accurate results the same as we

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.190 
really accurate results the same as we
get<00:04:01.370> in<00:04:01.459> the<00:04:01.520> wind<00:04:01.700> tunnel<00:04:02.050> well<00:04:03.050> there's

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:03.200 
get in the wind tunnel well there's

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:04.780 
get in the wind tunnel well there's
basically<00:04:03.320> two<00:04:03.709> two<00:04:04.040> different<00:04:04.130> levels<00:04:04.610> of

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:04.790 
basically two two different levels of

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:07.720 
basically two two different levels of
frames<00:04:05.540> that<00:04:05.660> you<00:04:05.720> can<00:04:05.870> get<00:04:06.020> one<00:04:06.260> has<00:04:06.530> a<00:04:07.160> wider

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:07.730 
frames that you can get one has a wider

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:09.910 
frames that you can get one has a wider
faster<00:04:08.660> fork<00:04:09.140> that's<00:04:09.380> really<00:04:09.620> geared<00:04:09.860> towards

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:09.920 
faster fork that's really geared towards

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.650 
faster fork that's really geared towards
triathlon<00:04:10.580> it's<00:04:10.730> got<00:04:10.850> almost<00:04:11.030> a<00:04:11.150> six<00:04:11.390> to<00:04:11.540> one

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:11.660 
triathlon it's got almost a six to one

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:15.370 
triathlon it's got almost a six to one
ratio<00:04:12.640> whereas<00:04:13.640> the<00:04:13.850> less<00:04:14.510> expensive<00:04:14.870> and

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:15.380 
ratio whereas the less expensive and

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.740 
ratio whereas the less expensive and
slightly<00:04:15.950> lower<00:04:16.250> performance<00:04:16.790> version<00:04:17.209> is<00:04:17.660> a

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
slightly lower performance version is a

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:19.210 
slightly lower performance version is a
little<00:04:17.840> bit<00:04:18.019> cheaper<00:04:18.169> so<00:04:18.350> that's<00:04:18.620> the<00:04:18.799> benefit

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:19.220 
little bit cheaper so that's the benefit

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:20.950 
little bit cheaper so that's the benefit
for<00:04:19.430> the<00:04:19.489> customer<00:04:19.640> if<00:04:20.120> you<00:04:20.239> choose<00:04:20.600> model
