up AI controls this tutorial I will

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.919 
up AI controls this tutorial I will
cover<00:00:06.000> how<00:00:06.359> to<00:00:06.390> create<00:00:06.930> a<00:00:07.109> basic<00:00:07.379> I<00:00:07.830> setup<00:00:08.929> all

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
cover how to create a basic I setup all

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.350 
cover how to create a basic I setup all
right<00:00:10.400> so<00:00:11.400> if<00:00:11.490> we<00:00:11.580> look<00:00:11.730> here<00:00:11.910> I<00:00:11.969> have<00:00:12.120> a

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
right so if we look here I have a

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:20.540 
right so if we look here I have a
character<00:00:12.900> with<00:00:15.170> two<00:00:16.170> eyes<00:00:16.880> and<00:00:19.220> we're<00:00:20.220> going

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
character with two eyes and we're going

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.700 
character with two eyes and we're going
to<00:00:20.689> simply<00:00:21.689> create<00:00:22.050> a<00:00:22.519> NURBS<00:00:23.519> circle<00:00:24.560> go<00:00:25.560> up

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
to simply create a NURBS circle go up

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:38.260 
to simply create a NURBS circle go up
here<00:00:30.500> move<00:00:31.500> that<00:00:31.769> out<00:00:32.040> of<00:00:32.189> it<00:00:36.200> there<00:00:37.200> we<00:00:37.350> go

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:38.270 
here move that out of it there we go

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:44.420 
here move that out of it there we go
shrink<00:00:39.270> it<00:00:39.360> down<00:00:42.770> let's<00:00:43.770> get<00:00:43.860> it<00:00:44.010> right<00:00:44.250> in<00:00:44.370> the

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
shrink it down let's get it right in the

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.310 
shrink it down let's get it right in the
center<00:00:44.550> of<00:00:44.700> that<00:00:44.850> eye<00:00:44.910> there<00:00:45.809> we<00:00:45.899> go<00:00:48.320> alright

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
center of that eye there we go alright

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.200 
center of that eye there we go alright
so<00:00:49.530> I<00:00:49.559> have<00:00:49.829> my<00:00:49.890> first<00:00:50.340> NURBS<00:00:50.550> circle<00:00:50.789> I'm

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
so I have my first NURBS circle I'm

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.209 
so I have my first NURBS circle I'm
going<00:00:51.300> to<00:00:51.420> delete<00:00:52.110> its<00:00:52.289> history<00:00:52.530> freeze<00:00:53.070> its

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
going to delete its history freeze its

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.029 
going to delete its history freeze its
transformations<00:00:53.460> and<00:00:54.120> Center<00:00:55.020> -<00:00:55.230> it's<00:00:55.410> just

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
transformations and Center - it's just

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:02.869 
transformations and Center - it's just
for<00:00:56.250> giggles<00:00:59.870> alright<00:01:01.280> so<00:01:02.280> now<00:01:02.399> what<00:01:02.550> I<00:01:02.609> want

for giggles alright so now what I want
to<00:01:03.000> do<00:01:03.149> is<00:01:06.020> move<00:01:07.020> its<00:01:07.200> pivot<00:01:07.500> to<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.650> origin

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
to do is move its pivot to the origin

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:15.109 
to do is move its pivot to the origin
and<00:01:08.490> just<00:01:08.729> flip<00:01:09.600> it<00:01:09.630> over<00:01:09.869> I<00:01:13.400> tend<00:01:14.400> to<00:01:14.460> click

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
and just flip it over I tend to click

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:21.260 
and just flip it over I tend to click
these<00:01:15.270> three<00:01:15.540> buttons<00:01:15.810> a<00:01:15.869> lot<00:01:20.000> alright<00:01:21.000> now

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
these three buttons a lot alright now

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.490 
these three buttons a lot alright now
we're<00:01:21.450> going<00:01:21.540> to<00:01:21.630> create<00:01:21.930> a<00:01:21.990> duplicate<00:01:22.439> of

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
we're going to create a duplicate of

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.359 
we're going to create a duplicate of
this<00:01:23.060> stretch<00:01:24.060> it<00:01:24.240> out<00:01:25.040> move<00:01:26.040> it<00:01:26.130> to<00:01:26.250> the

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
this stretch it out move it to the

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:33.650 
this stretch it out move it to the
center<00:01:29.689> there<00:01:30.689> we<00:01:30.869> go

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:33.660 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:38.070 

all<00:01:34.660> right<00:01:35.730> so<00:01:36.730> you<00:01:37.240> may<00:01:37.420> be<00:01:37.450> wondering<00:01:37.600> what

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.080 
all right so you may be wondering what

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.740 
all right so you may be wondering what
these<00:01:38.260> three<00:01:38.440> curves<00:01:38.650> are<00:01:38.800> going<00:01:38.950> to<00:01:39.010> do<00:01:39.750> it's

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
these three curves are going to do it's

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.830 
these three curves are going to do it's
quite<00:01:40.840> simple<00:01:41.200> really<00:01:41.640> this<00:01:42.640> curve<00:01:42.880> will<00:01:43.690> be

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
quite simple really this curve will be

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.080 
quite simple really this curve will be
for<00:01:44.020> the<00:01:44.110> left<00:01:44.290> eye<00:01:44.470> this<00:01:45.190> curve<00:01:45.460> will<00:01:45.820> be<00:01:45.940> for

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
for the left eye this curve will be for

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.600 
for the left eye this curve will be for
the<00:01:46.150> right<00:01:46.330> eye<00:01:46.360> and<00:01:46.660> this<00:01:47.440> curve<00:01:47.800> will<00:01:48.370> be<00:01:48.460> the

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.610 
the right eye and this curve will be the

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.470 
the right eye and this curve will be the
parent<00:01:49.000> of<00:01:49.180> these<00:01:49.930> two<00:01:50.140> curves<00:01:51.150> so<00:01:52.150> when<00:01:52.390> you

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:52.480 
parent of these two curves so when you

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.740 
parent of these two curves so when you
move<00:01:52.660> this<00:01:52.840> both<00:01:53.320> eyes<00:01:53.530> will<00:01:53.830> look<00:01:53.980> in<00:01:54.750> the

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750 
move this both eyes will look in the

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.770 
move this both eyes will look in the
same<00:01:55.930> direction<00:01:56.520> instead<00:01:57.520> of<00:01:57.610> having<00:01:57.760> to<00:01:58.000> move

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
same direction instead of having to move

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.750 
same direction instead of having to move
this<00:01:59.050> around<00:01:59.230> and<00:01:59.590> then<00:01:59.680> move<00:02:00.280> this<00:02:00.430> one<00:02:00.640> to

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:00.760 
this around and then move this one to

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.580 
this around and then move this one to
kind<00:02:00.880> of<00:02:01.060> match<00:02:01.210> it<00:02:01.240> then<00:02:02.080> getting<00:02:02.350> a<00:02:02.410> little

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
kind of match it then getting a little

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.670 
kind of match it then getting a little
bit<00:02:02.680> cross-eyed<00:02:04.229> so<00:02:05.229> what<00:02:05.350> I'm<00:02:05.410> going<00:02:05.530> to<00:02:05.560> do

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:05.680 
bit cross-eyed so what I'm going to do

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:11.790 
bit cross-eyed so what I'm going to do
is<00:02:05.890> click<00:02:06.100> B's<00:02:06.430> and<00:02:07.260> then<00:02:08.260> click<00:02:08.560> P<00:02:10.650> which<00:02:11.650> will

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
is click B's and then click P which will

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.230 
is click B's and then click P which will
parent<00:02:12.190> these<00:02:12.310> two<00:02:12.490> curves<00:02:12.880> to<00:02:13.120> this<00:02:15.240> alright

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.240 
parent these two curves to this alright

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.440 
parent these two curves to this alright
now<00:02:16.990> what<00:02:17.170> we<00:02:17.260> want<00:02:17.500> to<00:02:17.620> do<00:02:17.850> the<00:02:18.850> curves<00:02:19.150> is

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
now what we want to do the curves is

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.570 
now what we want to do the curves is
click<00:02:19.870> that<00:02:21.480> then<00:02:22.480> not<00:02:22.900> click<00:02:23.170> the<00:02:23.320> body<00:02:23.580> let's

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
click that then not click the body let's

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
click that then not click the body let's
just<00:02:24.730> move<00:02:24.820> that<00:02:24.970> body<00:02:25.150> out<00:02:25.270> of<00:02:25.390> the<00:02:25.480> way<00:02:25.540> for

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600 
just move that body out of the way for

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.160 
just move that body out of the way for
now<00:02:25.750> it's<00:02:26.350> causing<00:02:26.620> me<00:02:26.680> trouble<00:02:26.800> there<00:02:27.700> we<00:02:27.790> go

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
now it's causing me trouble there we go

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.560 
now it's causing me trouble there we go
all<00:02:29.170> right<00:02:29.290> we're<00:02:29.560> going<00:02:29.650> to<00:02:29.740> click<00:02:29.920> the<00:02:30.010> curve

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
all right we're going to click the curve

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:33.780 
all right we're going to click the curve
shift<00:02:31.570> click<00:02:31.900> the<00:02:32.260> eye<00:02:32.290> and<00:02:33.250> go<00:02:33.459> up<00:02:33.580> here<00:02:33.760> to

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
shift click the eye and go up here to

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.020 
shift click the eye and go up here to
constraint<00:02:34.390> in<00:02:34.780> the<00:02:34.990> animation<00:02:35.380> menu<00:02:35.850> and<00:02:36.850> go

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
constraint in the animation menu and go

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.590 
constraint in the animation menu and go
to<00:02:37.060> aim<00:02:37.269> constraint<00:02:37.570> click<00:02:38.410> the<00:02:38.620> little<00:02:38.769> box

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
to aim constraint click the little box

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.870 
to aim constraint click the little box
make<00:02:40.600> sure<00:02:40.720> that<00:02:40.840> maintain<00:02:41.170> offset<00:02:41.590> is<00:02:41.709> on

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
make sure that maintain offset is on

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.910 
make sure that maintain offset is on
make<00:02:42.880> sure<00:02:43.090> that<00:02:43.390> constraint<00:02:43.959> axes<00:02:44.380> and<00:02:44.650> all

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
make sure that constraint axes and all

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.920 
make sure that constraint axes and all
X's<00:02:45.340> are<00:02:45.459> on<00:02:46.230> there<00:02:47.230> we<00:02:47.320> go<00:02:47.350> and<00:02:47.709> now<00:02:48.780> we<00:02:49.780> have

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
X's are on there we go and now we have

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.470 
X's are on there we go and now we have
one<00:02:50.110> eye<00:02:50.140> constrained<00:02:50.970> do<00:02:51.970> the<00:02:52.060> same<00:02:52.269> thing

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
one eye constrained do the same thing

00:02:52.480 --> 00:03:04.470 
one eye constrained do the same thing
for<00:02:52.660> the<00:02:52.750> other<00:02:52.780> eye<00:02:53.070> add<00:02:57.750> and<00:02:58.750> there<00:02:59.350> we<00:02:59.470> go

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.270 

and<00:03:04.569> then<00:03:05.170> we<00:03:05.319> have<00:03:05.440> a<00:03:05.470> pair<00:03:05.709> of<00:03:05.739> floating<00:03:06.160> eyes

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
and then we have a pair of floating eyes

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.540 
and then we have a pair of floating eyes
there<00:03:06.670> we<00:03:06.760> go<00:03:07.379> all<00:03:08.379> right<00:03:08.560> and<00:03:08.830> that's<00:03:09.280> how<00:03:09.489> you

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:09.550 
there we go all right and that's how you

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:13.350 
there we go all right and that's how you
set<00:03:09.940> up<00:03:09.970> I<00:03:10.800> controls<00:03:11.800> pretty<00:03:12.550> easy<00:03:12.819> just<00:03:13.239> a

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
set up I controls pretty easy just a

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:14.960 
set up I controls pretty easy just a
name<00:03:13.510> constraint<00:03:13.989> and<00:03:14.080> a<00:03:14.140> parent<00:03:14.470> group

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
name constraint and a parent group

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.420 
name constraint and a parent group
thanks<00:03:15.970> for<00:03:16.120> watching
