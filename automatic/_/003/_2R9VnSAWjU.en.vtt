and you'll see how i change it in a

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.300 
and you'll see how i change it in a
second<00:02:06.149> so<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:06.899> stats<00:02:07.439> are<00:02:07.680> on<00:02:07.829> screen<00:02:08.129> for

still topping the scoring with 237 ever
which<00:02:13.560> is<00:02:13.710> actually<00:02:13.860> dropped<00:02:14.220> off<00:02:14.340> the<00:02:14.490> pace<00:02:14.640> a

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
which is actually dropped off the pace a

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.220 
which is actually dropped off the pace a
little<00:02:14.820> bit<00:02:15.030> you<00:02:15.270> know<00:02:15.300> he<00:02:15.480> still<00:02:15.690> got<00:02:15.780> 85

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
little bit you know he still got 85

little bit you know he still got 85
goals<00:02:16.500> in<00:02:16.770> 67<00:02:17.370> games<00:02:17.400> but<00:02:17.910> he<00:02:18.090> was<00:02:18.210> doing<00:02:18.390> so

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
goals in 67 games but he was doing so

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.360 
goals in 67 games but he was doing so
much<00:02:18.780> better<00:02:18.840> you<00:02:19.620> know<00:02:19.740> his<00:02:19.860> ratio<00:02:20.190> is

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370

actually<00:02:20.700> dropping<00:02:21.000> a<00:02:21.210> little<00:02:21.390> bit<00:02:21.480> so<00:02:21.630> we

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
actually dropping a little bit so we

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.270 
actually dropping a little bit so we
need<00:02:21.870> to<00:02:21.990> make<00:02:22.080> sure<00:02:22.140> that<00:02:22.440> he<00:02:22.590> starts<00:02:22.920> scoring

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280

have made a mistake also this dani
álvarez<00:04:37.840> we<00:04:37.990> didn't<00:04:38.200> actually<00:04:38.320> been<00:04:38.800> it<00:04:38.950> we

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:39.340 
álvarez we didn't actually been it we

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.640 
álvarez we didn't actually been it we
bought<00:04:39.520> it<00:04:39.610> for<00:04:39.730> 479<00:04:40.450> on<00:04:40.750> a<00:04:40.780> bit<00:04:40.990> but<00:04:41.200> it<00:04:41.350> had<00:04:41.530> an

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
bought it for 479 on a bit but it had an

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:43.140 
bought it for 479 on a bit but it had an
error<00:04:41.740> all<00:04:42.040> I<00:04:42.070> was<00:04:42.250> trying<00:04:42.370> to<00:04:42.550> list<00:04:42.760> it<00:04:42.970> and

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.150 
error all I was trying to list it and

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:44.880 
error all I was trying to list it and
therefore<00:04:43.690> it<00:04:43.930> ended<00:04:44.140> up<00:04:44.230> in<00:04:44.380> the<00:04:44.470> trade<00:04:44.680> pile

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:44.890 
therefore it ended up in the trade pile

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:46.290 
therefore it ended up in the trade pile
and<00:04:45.010> had<00:04:45.160> to<00:04:45.250> list<00:04:45.430> it<00:04:45.550> manually<00:04:45.850> but<00:04:46.030> we<00:04:46.150> got

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:46.300 
and had to list it manually but we got

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.830 
and had to list it manually but we got
it<00:04:46.420> for<00:04:46.570> 489<00:04:47.320> I<00:04:47.740> think<00:04:48.040> it<00:04:48.100> was<00:04:48.190> 479<00:04:49.060> this<00:04:49.660> thing

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:49.840 
it for 489 I think it was 479 this thing

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.840 
it for 489 I think it was 479 this thing
out<00:04:49.930> for<00:04:49.960> 525<00:04:50.890> so<00:04:51.190> good<00:04:51.340> profit<00:04:51.610> there<00:04:51.730> we've

out for 525 so good profit there we've

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:53.820 
out for 525 so good profit there we've
also<00:04:52.000> dropped<00:04:52.360> the<00:04:52.450> price<00:04:52.630> of<00:04:52.870> we're<00:04:53.380> just<00:04:53.740> a

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:53.830

way<00:05:38.110> that<00:05:38.380> I'm<00:05:38.470> going<00:05:38.590> to<00:05:38.680> get<00:05:38.800> him<00:05:38.890> something

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:39.160 
way that I'm going to get him something

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.159 
way that I'm going to get him something
that<00:05:39.280> gives<00:05:39.490> them<00:05:39.669> extra<00:05:39.820> pace<00:05:40.270> because<00:05:40.780> to<00:05:41.080> be

00:05:41.159 --> 00:05:41.169 
that gives them extra pace because to be

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:42.750 
that gives them extra pace because to be
honest<00:05:41.440> he's<00:05:41.530> so<00:05:41.740> slow<00:05:41.979> it<00:05:42.100> really<00:05:42.490> won't<00:05:42.610> make

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:42.760 
honest he's so slow it really won't make

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:43.920 
honest he's so slow it really won't make
any<00:05:42.940> difference<00:05:42.970> we're<00:05:43.390> just<00:05:43.540> going<00:05:43.690> to<00:05:43.720> try

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:43.930 
any difference we're just going to try

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:46.380 
any difference we're just going to try
and<00:05:43.960> sort<00:05:44.950> of<00:05:45.040> not<00:05:45.580> getting<00:05:45.729> the<00:05:45.910> situation

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:46.390 
and sort of not getting the situation

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:47.850 
and sort of not getting the situation
where<00:05:46.540> we<00:05:46.630> need<00:05:46.810> to<00:05:46.960> chase<00:05:47.140> back<00:05:47.350> with<00:05:47.590> him<00:05:47.710> and

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:47.860 
where we need to chase back with him and

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:49.500 
where we need to chase back with him and
I<00:05:48.220> decided<00:05:48.520> to<00:05:48.610> get<00:05:48.760> him<00:05:48.880> a<00:05:48.940> sentinel<00:05:49.330> card

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:49.510 
I decided to get him a sentinel card

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:50.880 
I decided to get him a sentinel card
because<00:05:49.720> that<00:05:49.810> would<00:05:49.930> improve<00:05:50.169> his<00:05:50.350> defending

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:50.890 
because that would improve his defending

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:52.740 
because that would improve his defending
and<00:05:51.070> is<00:05:51.370> heading<00:05:51.790> now<00:05:51.970> is<00:05:52.120> heading<00:05:52.390> it's

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:52.750 
and is heading now is heading it's

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:54.960 
and is heading now is heading it's
supposed<00:05:52.870> to<00:05:53.080> be<00:05:53.200> amazing<00:05:53.290> by<00:05:53.919> keep<00:05:54.220> finding

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:54.970 
supposed to be amazing by keep finding

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:57.600 
supposed to be amazing by keep finding
that<00:05:55.240> he<00:05:55.390> makes<00:05:55.960> big<00:05:56.350> mistakes<00:05:56.740> in<00:05:56.950> the<00:05:57.040> air<00:05:57.190> so

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:57.610 
that he makes big mistakes in the air so

00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:58.830 
that he makes big mistakes in the air so
I'm<00:05:57.700> hoping<00:05:58.120> that<00:05:58.270> with<00:05:58.390> this<00:05:58.540> extra

00:05:58.830 --> 00:05:58.840 
I'm hoping that with this extra

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:00.659 
I'm hoping that with this extra
defending<00:05:59.380> and<00:05:59.500> extra<00:05:59.740> heading<00:06:00.040> he<00:06:00.400> will<00:06:00.520> do<00:06:00.640> a

00:06:00.659 --> 00:06:00.669 
defending and extra heading he will do a

00:06:00.669 --> 00:06:02.100 
defending and extra heading he will do a
lot<00:06:00.820> better<00:06:00.970> and<00:06:01.270> start<00:06:01.510> you<00:06:01.630> know<00:06:01.750> clearing
