water absorbed with water type moves
it's<00:01:14.100> etc<00:01:14.969> but<00:01:15.689> basically<00:01:16.290> it's<00:01:16.560> just<00:01:16.590> a<00:01:16.770> cool

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979

ability<00:01:17.369> to<00:01:17.460> have<00:01:17.640> been<00:01:17.850> definitely<00:01:18.060> useful

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
ability to have been definitely useful

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.499 
ability to have been definitely useful
again<00:01:19.590> this<00:01:19.770> pokemon<00:01:20.189> probably<00:01:20.789> will<00:01:20.969> also<00:01:21.299> be

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
again this pokemon probably will also be

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.109 
again this pokemon probably will also be
in<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.780> uber<00:01:22.110> tier<00:01:22.409> if<00:01:22.530> it<00:01:22.680> isn't<00:01:23.039> already<00:01:23.130> so

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
in the uber tier if it isn't already so

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.810 
in the uber tier if it isn't already so
I<00:01:24.539> don't<00:01:25.259> know<00:01:25.530> how<00:01:25.649> useful<00:01:25.829> terrible<00:01:26.549> would

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
I don't know how useful terrible would

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.550 
I don't know how useful terrible would
be<00:01:27.000> in<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.299> Obert<00:01:27.600> here<00:01:27.840> but<00:01:28.020> it<00:01:28.140> could<00:01:28.320> have<00:01:28.500> a

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
be in the Obert here but it could have a

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.800 
be in the Obert here but it could have a
lot<00:01:28.799> of<00:01:28.829> different<00:01:29.219> uses<00:01:29.340> but<00:01:30.329> as<00:01:30.450> for<00:01:30.689> its

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
lot of different uses but as for its

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.380 
lot of different uses but as for its
stats<00:01:31.079> they're<00:01:31.439> pretty<00:01:31.710> much<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.609> same<00:01:32.909> as

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
stats they're pretty much the same as

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.859 
stats they're pretty much the same as
Reshiram<00:01:34.320> in<00:01:34.740> a<00:01:35.070> sense<00:01:35.369> because<00:01:35.689> the<00:01:36.689> only

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
Reshiram in a sense because the only

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.480 
Reshiram in a sense because the only
thing<00:01:37.079> different<00:01:37.259> is<00:01:37.680> they<00:01:37.950> flipped<00:01:38.280> the

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
thing different is they flipped the

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.719 
thing different is they flipped the
attack<00:01:38.850> with<00:01:39.390> Reshiram<00:01:40.380> special<00:01:40.799> attack<00:01:41.369> and

attack with Reshiram special attack and

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:42.859

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
different things also with this though

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:23.050

Pokemon<00:04:25.099> gets<00:04:25.340> but<00:04:26.090> in<00:04:26.210> my<00:04:26.360> opinion<00:04:26.510> it's

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:27.170 
Pokemon gets but in my opinion it's

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:29.290 
Pokemon gets but in my opinion it's
nearly<00:04:27.410> as<00:04:27.620> useful<00:04:27.830> because<00:04:28.250> it<00:04:28.730> has<00:04:29.030> less

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:29.300 
nearly as useful because it has less

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.230 
nearly as useful because it has less
base<00:04:29.570> power<00:04:29.870> and<00:04:30.230> it<00:04:30.860> only<00:04:31.400> doubles<00:04:31.880> in<00:04:32.060> power

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240 
base power and it only doubles in power

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.350 
base power and it only doubles in power

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:42.430 
resists electric-type being a dragon
type<00:04:40.670> it's<00:04:41.180> kind<00:04:41.450> of<00:04:41.510> useless<00:04:41.750> to<00:04:42.050> be<00:04:42.080> using

move out rage instead to pretty much

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:48.970

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:48.980 
take it out with your passive power but

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:50.920 
take it out with your passive power but
yeah<00:04:49.250> outrages<00:04:49.820> your<00:04:49.970> second<00:04:50.330> move<00:04:50.480> by<00:04:50.870> the

made<00:05:24.680> but<00:05:24.860> it<00:05:25.010> probably<00:05:25.460> will<00:05:25.670> go<00:05:25.820> back<00:05:26.030> up<00:05:26.060> to

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:26.390 
made but it probably will go back up to

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:31.180 
made but it probably will go back up to
verse<00:05:26.720> pretty<00:05:27.020> soon<00:05:27.340> but<00:05:29.530> other<00:05:30.530> than<00:05:30.920> that

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:31.190 
verse pretty soon but other than that

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:34.150 
verse pretty soon but other than that
that's<00:05:31.520> pretty<00:05:31.640> much<00:05:32.090> this<00:05:32.390> set<00:05:32.690> as<00:05:33.620> you<00:05:34.010> can

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:34.160 
that's pretty much this set as you can

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.670 
that's pretty much this set as you can
see<00:05:34.340> it<00:05:34.520> has<00:05:34.810> ridiculous<00:05:35.810> physical<00:05:36.230> attacking

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:36.680 
see it has ridiculous physical attacking

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:38.860

power<00:05:36.860> with<00:05:37.190> all<00:05:37.400> of<00:05:37.550> these<00:05:37.670> moves<00:05:38.030> and<00:05:38.390> with<00:05:38.840> a

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:38.870 
power with all of these moves and with a

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:41.050 
power with all of these moves and with a
choice<00:05:39.200> scarf<00:05:39.620> it'll<00:05:39.860> be<00:05:39.980> ridiculously<00:05:40.760> fast

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:41.060

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:44.860 
choice scarf it'll be ridiculously fast
as<00:05:41.390> well<00:05:41.600> and<00:05:41.840> be<00:05:42.650> able<00:05:42.680> to<00:05:43.010> just<00:05:43.850> wreck<00:05:44.570> teams
