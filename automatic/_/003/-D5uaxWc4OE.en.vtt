why<00:01:40.710> they<00:01:40.890> just<00:01:40.920> went<00:01:41.250> out<00:01:41.400> and<00:01:41.549> said<00:01:41.729> that<00:01:41.909> I

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
why they just went out and said that I

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.130 
why they just went out and said that I
guess<00:01:42.119> they<00:01:42.270> wanted<00:01:42.479> to<00:01:42.570> keep<00:01:42.720> it<00:01:42.899> a<00:01:42.960> secret

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
guess they wanted to keep it a secret

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.710 
guess they wanted to keep it a secret
but<00:01:43.649> now<00:01:44.430> it's<00:01:44.610> not<00:01:44.729> really<00:01:45.000> a<00:01:45.030> secret<00:01:45.299> anymore

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
but now it's not really a secret anymore

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.399 
but now it's not really a secret anymore
so<00:01:46.229> yeah<00:01:47.100> um<00:01:47.369> I<00:01:48.299> think<00:01:48.899> that's<00:01:49.110> pretty<00:01:49.320> much

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
so yeah um I think that's pretty much

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.020 
so yeah um I think that's pretty much
gonna<00:01:49.619> do<00:01:49.799> it<00:01:49.950> so<00:01:50.280> I<00:01:50.310> hope<00:01:50.790> this<00:01:50.970> is

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
gonna do it so I hope this is

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.289 
gonna do it so I hope this is
straightened<00:01:51.540> things<00:01:51.750> out<00:01:52.640> once<00:01:53.640> again<00:01:53.970> like

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
straightened things out once again like

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.109 
straightened things out once again like
I<00:01:54.540> didn't<00:01:54.840> think<00:01:55.350> it<00:01:55.710> was<00:01:55.920> right<00:01:56.579> for<00:01:56.880> them<00:01:56.969> to

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
I didn't think it was right for them to

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.700 
I didn't think it was right for them to
have<00:01:57.210> poison<00:01:57.780> and<00:01:57.960> not<00:01:58.079> have<00:01:58.320> white<00:01:59.159> Pikmin

have poison and not have white Pikmin
but<00:02:01.710> you<00:02:02.070> know<00:02:02.130> I<00:02:02.310> could<00:02:02.549> totally<00:02:02.729> understand

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
but you know I could totally understand

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.170 
but you know I could totally understand
having<00:02:03.780> white<00:02:04.469> Pikmin<00:02:04.860> back<00:02:05.070> but<00:02:05.310> not<00:02:05.579> purple
