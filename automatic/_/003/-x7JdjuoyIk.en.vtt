00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:17.010 

this<00:00:04.490> is<00:00:04.670> Tokyo<00:00:05.770> I<00:00:06.770> was<00:00:07.279> born<00:00:07.550> in

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:17.020 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:20.530 

the<00:00:18.020> inside<00:00:18.860> and<00:00:19.040> outside<00:00:19.190> is<00:00:19.610> clearly

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:20.540 
the inside and outside is clearly

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:36.040 
the inside and outside is clearly
different<00:00:20.920> outside

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.050 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:01:03.740 

like<00:00:37.050> this<00:01:00.260> so<00:01:01.260> I<00:01:01.290> think<00:01:01.500> in<00:01:02.309> Tokyo<00:01:02.670> inside<00:01:03.570> and

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
like this so I think in Tokyo inside and

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.760 
like this so I think in Tokyo inside and
outside<00:01:03.869> nature<00:01:04.799> is<00:01:05.840> melting<00:01:06.840> together<00:01:07.170> to

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
outside nature is melting together to

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:19.540 
outside nature is melting together to
create<00:01:07.979> some<00:01:08.600> space<00:01:09.890> sometimes<00:01:11.150> science

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:19.550 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:24.260 

so<00:01:21.260> this
