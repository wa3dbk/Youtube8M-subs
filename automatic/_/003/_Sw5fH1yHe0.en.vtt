this was a bit of an opportunistic field
against<00:00:54.870> it<00:00:55.110> so<00:00:55.350> wet<00:00:55.560> last<00:00:55.800> year<00:00:56.190> this<00:00:56.460> was

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
the field has been a write-off so it

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.370 
the field has been a write-off so it

a water pipe and drainage pipe in here

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.840 
a water pipe and drainage pipe in here
in<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.439> winter<00:01:28.770> that<00:01:28.890> we<00:01:28.950> had<00:01:29.159> so<00:01:29.369> much<00:01:29.520> water

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
in the winter that we had so much water

in the winter that we had so much water
coming<00:01:30.090> out<00:01:30.299> of<00:01:30.359> the<00:01:30.569> hill<00:01:30.780> so<00:01:31.200> many<00:01:31.380> Springs

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
coming out of the hill so many Springs

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.540 
coming out of the hill so many Springs
just<00:01:32.249> appearing<00:01:32.640> from<00:01:32.909> nowhere<00:01:34.009> so<00:01:35.009> we<00:01:35.159> come

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:36.550 
just appearing from nowhere so we come

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:38.160 
just appearing from nowhere so we come
for<00:01:36.880> the<00:01:36.940> drainage<00:01:37.300> pipe<00:01:37.570> in<00:01:37.780> that's<00:01:37.960> just

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
for the drainage pipe in that's just

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:39.780 
for the drainage pipe in that's just
going<00:01:38.380> down<00:01:38.620> to<00:01:38.650> be<00:01:38.890> there<00:01:39.100> to<00:01:39.370> that<00:01:39.460> bit<00:01:39.640> of<00:01:39.730> a

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:39.790 
going down to be there to that bit of a

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:47.490 
going down to be there to that bit of a
gap<00:01:41.520> and<00:01:45.420> Vic<00:01:46.420> to<00:01:46.630> still<00:01:46.870> a<00:01:46.900> bit<00:01:47.080> too<00:01:47.260> went

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 
gap and Vic to still a bit too went

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.010 
gap and Vic to still a bit too went
there<00:01:47.680> but<00:01:47.800> it's<00:01:47.950> not<00:01:48.040> that's<00:01:48.460> okay<00:01:48.970> and<00:01:49.900> then

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
there but it's not that's okay and then

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.420 
there but it's not that's okay and then
we're<00:01:50.140> also<00:01:50.230> leaning<00:01:50.560> a<00:01:50.710> little<00:01:50.740> strip<00:01:51.190> here

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:51.430 
we're also leaning a little strip here

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:53.310 
we're also leaning a little strip here
we've<00:01:51.610> got<00:01:51.640> six<00:01:52.120> meters<00:01:52.450> a<00:01:52.480> game<00:01:52.750> color<00:01:53.110> there

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:53.320 
we've got six meters a game color there

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.130 
we've got six meters a game color there
which<00:01:53.470> is<00:01:53.500> chicory<00:01:54.430> with<00:01:54.820> a<00:01:54.850> bit<00:01:55.120> of<00:01:55.150> buckwheat

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
which is chicory with a bit of buckwheat

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.580 
which is chicory with a bit of buckwheat
over<00:01:56.470> the<00:01:56.560> top<00:01:56.740> is<00:01:56.980> a<00:01:57.100> nurse<00:01:57.580> crop<00:01:58.410> and<00:01:59.410> then

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
over the top is a nurse crop and then

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.370 
over the top is a nurse crop and then
we're<00:01:59.740> just<00:01:59.770> going<00:02:00.010> to<00:02:00.070> leave<00:02:00.250> six<00:02:00.700> meters<00:02:01.150> of

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
we're just going to leave six meters of

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.650 
we're just going to leave six meters of
standing<00:02:02.380> oilseed<00:02:02.800> right<00:02:03.070> there<00:02:03.510> next<00:02:04.510> to

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:04.660 
standing oilseed right there next to

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:08.130 
standing oilseed right there next to
that<00:02:04.750> for<00:02:05.370> partridges<00:02:06.370> really<00:02:06.840> we<00:02:07.840> did<00:02:07.990> in<00:02:08.110> a

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
that for partridges really we did in a

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.340 
that for partridges really we did in a
couple<00:02:08.380> of<00:02:08.410> years<00:02:08.530> ago<00:02:09.240> and<00:02:10.240> it<00:02:11.170> were

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.350 
couple of years ago and it were

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:13.410 
couple of years ago and it were
fantastically<00:02:12.070> well<00:02:12.280> a<00:02:12.550> great<00:02:12.850> cover<00:02:13.210> and

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
fantastically well a great cover and

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.810 
fantastically well a great cover and
actually<00:02:13.750> it'll<00:02:13.930> still<00:02:14.140> have<00:02:14.320> seeds<00:02:14.620> in<00:02:14.860> it<00:02:14.950> in

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:15.820 
actually it'll still have seeds in it in

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:17.820 
actually it'll still have seeds in it in
