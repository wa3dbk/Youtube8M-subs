00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:06.590
 hello cyclists friends had posted 

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:10.099
 for this list culminating 

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:12.169
 so today we will learn how to 

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:14.419
 change his bike chain all that is 

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:16.730
 that he died four cases strictly 

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:19.520
 or that we are a fortiori lengthened a 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:22.210
 chain but also so to be able 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:25.550
 do that you have to be able to hunt 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:29.240
 pins that handed each jersey so 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:30.600
 it must be pinned here is so there is 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.180
 many 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:35.850
 string size I know if you 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:40.380
 get to see here is suitable for 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.700
 certain types of channels it depends on 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:45.540
 the dike of the waist makes it the 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:48.120
 distance between each link all one 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:54.090
 lot to be able to demonstrate its chain on 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:59.250
 just place our tool here with a 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:00.960
 pinch faces pin hunt on 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:06.540
 block the oak and then we start 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:08.900
 turn last hunt and there you 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.900
 loot 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.090
 here is hop it's done 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.680
 here 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:25.250
 facts 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.250
 shit 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.150
 of course the pin fell into 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:33.130
 the grass to try to find her 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.130
 [Laughs] 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:53.100
 so we have to dismantle his chain 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:56.170
 of where we changed it we have to close it 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.090
 so the idea is to prepare this little 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.189
 group i by first inserting one of 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.329
 best 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:03.119
 story of not being bothered is this 

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:11.110
 that otherwise it moves a lot 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:15.580
 from there we just chase outdoors 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:21.690
 even anne inside and up 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:21.690
 the tool so you can 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:28.530
 ray chasing the pin in the 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.530
 gag 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.410
 the place 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.060
 without going too far then how 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.060
 to navigate 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:52.150
 and here we have changed our channel 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:56.950
 not very complicated just a little bit of 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:03:00.090
 fingering having candy at mount for 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.090
 those who will go through ct
