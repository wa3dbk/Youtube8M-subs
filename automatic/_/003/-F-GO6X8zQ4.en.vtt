hey guys so I turned my render distance
up<00:02:07.180> a<00:02:07.270> little<00:02:07.509> bit<00:02:07.630> so<00:02:07.780> you<00:02:07.869> can<00:02:07.930> see<00:02:08.050> the<00:02:08.319> whole

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
up a little bit so you can see the whole

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.160 
up a little bit so you can see the whole
thing<00:02:08.530> and<00:02:09.300> we're<00:02:10.300> going<00:02:10.420> to<00:02:10.450> set<00:02:10.690> it<00:02:10.810> off<00:02:10.899> now

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170

and<00:02:11.349> Quinn<00:02:11.950> said<00:02:12.130> my<00:02:12.280> computer<00:02:12.700> was<00:02:12.819> going<00:02:13.000> to

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
and Quinn said my computer was going to

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.970 
and Quinn said my computer was going to
crash<00:02:13.300> but<00:02:13.360> i<00:02:13.810> think<00:02:14.290> the<00:02:14.349> pentium<00:02:14.680> 4<00:02:14.860> can

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
crash but i think the pentium 4 can

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.080 
crash but i think the pentium 4 can
handle<00:02:15.250> like<00:02:15.340> when<00:02:15.489> you<00:02:15.580> want<00:02:15.730> to<00:02:15.790> go<00:02:15.880> set<00:02:16.060> it

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
handle like when you want to go set it

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.460 
handle like when you want to go set it
