00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:10.280
 in short, to be thin you need not to eat 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:12.139
 hello lately i am very much 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.969
 worried about getting 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:16.100
 message from different girls who 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:18.590
 write that their experience of sitting on a protein 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:21.500
 the diet ended rather badly therefore 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.869
 I want to remind you that before you 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.849
 will bother with any diet 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:28.130
 consult a doctor here 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:30.650
 perhaps the process of dieting you will need 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.419
 eat any vitamin there 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:34.579
 then maybe this diet is just for you 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:37.270
 initially does not fit and your body has 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:39.680
 her dad will respond so before 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.270
 experimenting with his figure and weight 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.880
 for the rest, please refer 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:46.850
 to your doctor about this video i want 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:49.880
 talk about the way of nutrition thanks 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:52.280
 which gain extra weight in principle 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:55.070
 it is impossible that such personal weight is superfluous 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.780
 weight is extra food eaten in order 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.670
 so as not to forget the excess fat 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.360
 just enough to keep a balance 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:04.670
 between the amount of food consumed and 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:06.650
 your lifestyle is activity 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.270
 you probably heard eat one 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.429
 chocolate is the same as you 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.409
 call for 10 kilometers to run if 

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:14.420
 An ordinary day passes so that in the morning I sat down 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:16.039
 I came to work at work at work 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.020
 for the computer leaving the village 

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:20.149
 the car came home at home sat on the sofa 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.850
 for such a lifestyle is not required 

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:24.710
 huge amount of food absorbed all 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.960
 probably heard of the existence of spirits 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.969
 fats and carbohydrates are divided into carbohydrates 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.490
 simple and complex simple is the sea 

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:33.889
 sugar complex heap of nutrients 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.109
 simple carbohydrates are quickly digested 

00:01:33.889 --> 00:01:38.869
 dramatically increasing blood sugar levels 

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:40.999
 excess sugar is taken from the bloodstream 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:43.039
 makes fat food simple 

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:45.289
 carbohydrate causes a constant feeling 

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:46.579
 hunger because they don't have 

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:48.679
 nutrients 

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:50.600
 but completely eliminate them is not worth the time 

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:52.999
 fruit for example also contains a bunch 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.920
 vitamins be careful you need to be exactly with 

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:56.990
 flour sweet complex carbohydrates 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.670
 slower to digest longer 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.380
 digested and supports 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.899
 optimal blood sugar 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:05.359
 nourishes the body helps it work 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:07.310
 correct minerals fiber dietary 

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:09.800
 fibers that are contained in complex 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:12.380
 carbohydrates are absolutely not replaced and very 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.900
 useful many fruits contain 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:17.120
 him on complex carbohydrates like fasting 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.909
 nuts and berries bitter chocolate 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.750
 and various other products can be more 

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:25.670
 google their list fats too is divided by 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.090
 saturated and unsaturated saturated 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.190
 fats 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.950
 as something else contributes to obesity 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.510
 raise blood cholesterol in 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.299
 mostly of animal origin 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.730
 but also contained in cocoa butter and 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:39.769
 coconut completely exclude them too 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.840
 worth it because I thought the doses they 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:44.690
 increase the benefits of unsaturated fats 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:47.329
 not saturated with omega-3 and other useful 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:49.609
 fatty acids contained in fish 

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:51.590
 avocado olives, plant nuts 

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:54.230
 oils and so on lower the level 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.900
 blood cholesterol and are the main 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.489
 source of energy for the body 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.170
 bring only benefits including 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:02.810
 visually for skin and hair 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:04.489
 proteins are not harmful are not divided into 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:06.409
 animal and vegetable and animal 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:07.870
 contained of course in meat and 

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:10.459
 animal products 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.810
 note that in some varieties 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:13.970
 fish and seafood 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.890
 there is more protein than red 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:18.470
 meat protein from building material 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:20.420
 our body and it is digested 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.709
 quite a long time demanding for this 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.720
 extra energy from outside 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:27.380
 vegetable proteins are rich in mushrooms 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:29.180
 tofu muesli and parsley 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:31.040
 plan your diet don't forget that 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.739
 far from all the named products 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:36.500
 protein prevails over carbohydrates 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:38.510
 pay special attention to products with 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.310
 negative calorie they are so 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:42.109
 are called because for their 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:44.780
 digestion needs more energy than 

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:47.030
 they give you take vitamins from them but 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.829
 while they break down your fats well and 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:51.230
 lowers caloric companion in 

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:52.930
 breast ingredients and salt 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:55.400
 maintains fluid balance 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:58.040
 prevents dehydration especially 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.849
 useful sea salt containing minerals 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.980
 and all that 

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:03.650
 except don't overdo it 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:05.840
 itâ€™s still very important what kind of food when 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:08.419
 there is an approximate ratio of proteins 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:10.519
 fats and carbohydrates daily in the diet on 

00:04:08.419 --> 00:04:12.410
 breakfast needed complex carbohydrates and volume 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:14.599
 breakfast should be about 30 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:17.419
 percent but they are better divided into two 

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:19.880
 receiving sheep can include both proteins and 

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:22.220
 complex carbohydrates lunch is half 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:24.470
 the food you eat per day 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:26.870
 also split into two three steps to 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:27.630
 reduce portion size talking about level 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:29.910
 need to 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:31.860
 fight for the fight the stomach is asleep at night 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:34.710
 and he needs to have time to digest 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:36.690
 so there must be two better rides 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:39.840
 three hours before bedtime and consist of 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:40.920
 protein foods is very important to drink 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.840
 much water 

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:44.580
 read your personal amount 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:47.190
 quite simply need to multiply 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:50.250
 kilogram of your weight on 30 milliliters 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:51.900
 water and that's such a volume in water not 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:54.420
 liquids and water can be whipped during 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:55.440
 of course you understand that most days 

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:57.990
 harmful drinks 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:00.390
 these are sweet carbonated and they are harmful not 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:02.940
 only for high sugar content but 

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:04.770
 also because they contain gas 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:07.140
 there is mineral sparkling water she 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:09.420
 also not very useful because of the gas 

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:12.090
 cellulite is also formed cellulite 

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:14.340
 formed from a fixed lifestyle 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:16.770
 eat perch that food can not drink 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:19.710
 in fact, this is not true for some reason who 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:21.480
 then thinks that the liquid reduces 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:23.490
 concentration of gastric juice to him 

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:25.440
 it becomes harder to digest food and she 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:27.600
 lies there and in it really is 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:29.850
 exactly absolute nonsense because i 

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:31.800
 asked her parents about it 

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:34.620
 about them, I have very, very, very 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:36.270
 very cool doctors and they said it 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:38.190
 Generally full idiocy because not 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:40.470
 need to forget that the most useful 

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:42.930
 and up to soups are due to the fact that they 

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:45.420
 liquid on the stomach of their easier to digest 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:48.150
 and chewed and yes it is the same 

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:50.970
 it turns out that super and therefore drink 

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:53.040
 can be thin do not eat at the 

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:56.700
 it's not true when a person is hungry 

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:59.910
 his body is under stress and this 

00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:02.340
 the body accumulates fat in general every 

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:05.580
 baby which, after fasting eats 

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:08.580
 man always when you feel hunger 

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:10.380
 eat something small harmless 

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:12.720
 but you don't need to eat anything 

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:14.550
 support the body's state of hunger 

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:16.560
 the same principle is very harmful 15 

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:18.660
 once or twice a day because with such 

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:20.970
 iridescent you may not be 

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:22.340
 feel hungry but in fact it 

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:24.770
 all the same strasberg 

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:27.200
 no such thing the body is used to it 

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:29.000
 used to eat once in the middle of the night on 

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:30.740
 really need to eat like 

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.800
 there was no need to fall asleep 

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:34.550
 problems don't pull down your intestines you 

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:36.590
 everything else 

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:38.960
 there is still such a thing as water with lemon 

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:41.390
 water with lemon really helps 

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:44.150
 keep weight lose weight and for that 

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:46.490
 enough to drink a glass of warm water with 

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:49.370
 crushed in this water 

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:50.750
 lemon for half an hour before each meal 

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:53.930
 that's all 

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:57.590
 this concentration even in the morning did 

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:59.630
 will not affect the stomach because 

00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:00.620
 an empty stomach in the morning they rages 

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:02.030
 acid 

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:04.160
 even if there are any problems 

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:06.950
 stomach alone for a glass of water 

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:08.990
 no harm 

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:11.720
 It can be five basic rules 

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:15.610
 of all that I have already said the first 

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:18.790
 drink plenty of water second not to starve 3 

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:23.060
 there are carbohydrates in the evening there are proteins 

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:26.000
 the fourth is to divide the portions into small and 

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:28.820
 The fifth rule is, you need as much as 

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.800
 required by your lifestyle if you 

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:33.080
 plan to stick to that kind of food 

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:35.060
 it is not worth it but initially perceived 

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:36.950
 as a diet just always remember 

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:39.110
 that in order for the organism and in general 

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:42.290
 a person needs to get used to something 

00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:45.080
 only 21 days and try 21 days so 

00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:46.700
 by eat and then I'll just 

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:49.010
 just get used to it 

00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:52.630
 Thank you all so much for your attention. 

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:52.630
 until the next vidos yet
