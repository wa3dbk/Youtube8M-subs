00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
there are presents that's a little bit

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
there are presents that's a little bit
of<00:02:30.360> difference<00:02:32.599> but<00:02:33.599> let<00:02:33.780> me<00:02:33.870> just<00:02:33.900> show<00:02:34.230> you

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
of difference but let me just show you

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.309 
of difference but let me just show you
something<00:02:34.560> I'll<00:02:34.830> get<00:02:35.010> it<00:02:35.130> perfect<00:02:35.550> right<00:02:35.700> here

00:02:36.309 --> 00:02:36.319 
something I'll get it perfect right here

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:43.040 
something I'll get it perfect right here
okay<00:02:37.319> as<00:02:37.380> you<00:02:37.560> can<00:02:37.740> see<00:02:37.980> it<00:02:38.160> when<00:02:38.370> you<00:02:41.840> when<00:02:42.840> you

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
okay as you can see it when you when you

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.190 
okay as you can see it when you when you
uh<00:02:43.080> when<00:02:43.550> you<00:02:44.550> hit<00:02:44.730> them<00:02:44.940> they<00:02:45.180> don't<00:02:45.750> collapse

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
uh when you hit them they don't collapse

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.140 
uh when you hit them they don't collapse
down<00:02:46.590> so<00:02:46.890> it<00:02:47.010> makes<00:02:47.160> it<00:02:47.220> harder<00:02:47.670> to<00:02:47.700> get<00:02:47.940> them

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
down so it makes it harder to get them

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.240 
down so it makes it harder to get them
see<00:02:48.870> if<00:02:48.930> this<00:02:49.050> is<00:02:49.200> regular<00:02:49.530> Angry<00:02:49.860> Birds<00:02:50.130> this

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
see if this is regular Angry Birds this

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.170 
see if this is regular Angry Birds this
would<00:02:50.400> all<00:02:50.580> fall<00:02:50.970> and<00:02:51.980> it<00:02:52.980> would<00:02:53.220> be<00:02:53.400> very

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
would all fall and it would be very

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:59.860 
would all fall and it would be very
different<00:02:54.800> but<00:02:56.660> this<00:02:57.660> one<00:02:57.840> is<00:02:57.959> not<00:02:58.230> the<00:02:58.530> same

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
different but this one is not the same

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.760 
different but this one is not the same
so<00:03:00.870> it<00:03:01.110> is<00:03:01.230> a<00:03:01.260> little<00:03:01.500> different<00:03:03.230> so<00:03:04.230> you<00:03:04.650> got

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:04.770 
so it is a little different so you got

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
so it is a little different so you got
25<00:03:05.190> levels<00:03:05.400> till<00:03:05.970> you<00:03:06.180> get<00:03:06.330> to<00:03:06.470> Christmas<00:03:07.790> you
