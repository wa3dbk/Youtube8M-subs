00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 hello guys today I present a game 

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:06.660
 especially fun for the 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.360
 nice situations that you can 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:13.559
 create is called kiss me now it 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:16.109
 advice for boys over 12 11 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.880
 years up for adults is definitely 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.760
 even more fun then a game 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.230
 really ageless but let's start at once 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.109
 explain this gesture to you 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.990
 we have a volunteer you will be put at 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:32.759
 center must play for this game at 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:34.890
 maximum in the minimum in a 16 20 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.420
 people at least scout functions 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.910
 it works well so it can be a game 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:42.360
 to do at a party at a gathering 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:45.690
 birthday and so on I said then 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.760
 a volunteer and a half then or man 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.559
 indifferent woman but it is important that 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.850
 for the example we choose we choose 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:55.920
 kind we put that in between there is one 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.010
 girl then a female while 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:02.340
 around the circle they will alternate 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:05.939
 man woman man woman then male 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:08.700
 female male female and so on 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.890
 so slowly a whole 12 for everything 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.260
 and will try we will have the whole circle like that 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.780
 of people who are therefore either male or 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.310
 female accent told me we have the 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.130
 our volunteer who is female 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.280
 at this point the number is the people 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:27.659
 that lie along the circle with 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:30.930
 starting for which after 11234 etc. 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:33.030
 in this way all the males will have a 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.299
 number 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.579
 I was mistaken, it seems true, of gunfire and 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:41.260
 all females will instead have a 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:43.720
 even number in females will have 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:46.060
 however it seems that in this case this is 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.380
 very important because what happens to the 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:51.190
 way of the game 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:56.050
 at the start of the game our female at 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:58.210
 center must call is first of all a 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.410
 even number so the females must 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.270
 always call the females first 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:05.200
 so I have to call for example the 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:07.000
 number 4 and then must call a male 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.920
 so for example the number 1 then 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.680
 where every time who is in the middle 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:15.550
 must call two numbers what happens 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:17.290
 it happens that the female number 4 of the 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:19.180
 you have to wait who is the number one but 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.740
 the real goal was the male number 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.560
 one that must succeed go by 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:28.780
 female in the middle to kiss her then from 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:30.640
 give her a kiss and then I said 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.110
 the male must add the family 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.560
 in the middle he tries to kiss her on 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.780
 cheek 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.450
 the female number 4 that was called 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.820
 must try to intercept it block it 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.740
 and try in every way to kiss him a 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:45.459
 turn on the cheek 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:48.489
 the kisser will be the person who wins 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:50.500
 this challenge therefore if it is male rice 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:51.940
 lower this female won him if 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.280
 the family now to kiss the male 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.620
 she won that wins ends half 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:59.019
 can make another call obviously i 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.550
 ways to block the person who was 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:03.130
 call to the center are almost 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:05.050
 infiniti we all say ivaldi apart 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:07.360
 those obviously incorrect the 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:09.640
 situations that create reversals 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:13.450
 rollovers movements etc. are 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:15.850
 really nice and I recommend it 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:18.790
 always remain here are ends of the circle of 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:20.650
 game for any doubtful questions 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.630
