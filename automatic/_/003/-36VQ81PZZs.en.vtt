00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:15.480 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:33.069 

probably<00:01:16.480> want<00:01:16.600> to<00:01:16.630> hold<00:01:16.780> the<00:01:16.960> paper<00:01:17.170> towel

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:33.079 

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:35.020 

and<00:01:33.560> you<00:01:33.770> can<00:01:33.920> see<00:01:34.070> there<00:01:34.280> all<00:01:34.460> the<00:01:34.759> stuff

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
that's coming off the wheels so then

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:53.219 
that's coming off the wheels so then
flip<00:01:39.590> the<00:01:39.740> paper<00:01:39.950> towel<00:01:40.189> over<00:01:40.429> like<00:01:40.850> that

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:53.229 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:55.200 

and<00:01:53.799> you<00:01:53.890> want<00:01:54.100> to<00:01:54.159> do<00:01:54.280> this<00:01:54.460> because<00:01:54.700> it'll

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210 
and you want to do this because it'll

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.660 
and you want to do this because it'll

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.490 

but<00:02:13.090> you<00:02:13.360> can<00:02:13.510> see<00:02:13.630> there's<00:02:13.840> a<00:02:14.110> little<00:02:14.380> bit

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
but you can see there's a little bit

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.770 
but you can see there's a little bit
that<00:02:14.650> was<00:02:14.800> on<00:02:14.980> the<00:02:15.100> wheels<00:02:15.280> so<00:02:15.670> get<00:02:16.390> that<00:02:16.450> off

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
that was on the wheels so get that off

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.730 
that was on the wheels so get that off
now<00:02:17.110> you<00:02:17.170> flip<00:02:17.530> no<00:02:18.660> do<00:02:19.660> this<00:02:19.750> again<00:02:20.110> for<00:02:20.320> the

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:20.740 
now you flip no do this again for the

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.730 
now you flip no do this again for the
front<00:02:21.240> you<00:02:22.240> want<00:02:22.420> to<00:02:22.540> adjust<00:02:22.750> the<00:02:23.260> paper<00:02:23.470> towel

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:23.740 
front you want to adjust the paper towel

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:26.910 
front you want to adjust the paper towel
to<00:02:24.070> where<00:02:24.390> it's<00:02:25.390> not<00:02:25.630> on<00:02:25.840> the<00:02:25.990> same<00:02:26.170> dirty<00:02:26.530> spot

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
to where it's not on the same dirty spot

00:02:26.920 --> 00:03:08.870 
to where it's not on the same dirty spot
that<00:02:27.190> it<00:02:27.280> was<00:02:27.459> before

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.940 

as<00:03:09.880> you<00:03:09.970> see<00:03:10.150> all<00:03:10.180> that<00:03:10.540> block<00:03:10.810> stopped<00:03:11.140> it<00:03:11.350> all

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
as you see all that block stopped it all

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:13.440 
as you see all that block stopped it all
that<00:03:12.130> black<00:03:12.280> stuff<00:03:12.580> just<00:03:12.790> came<00:03:12.940> right<00:03:13.150> off<00:03:13.180> the

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
that black stuff just came right off the

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:36.670 
that black stuff just came right off the
wheels<00:03:14.040> so<00:03:16.530> then<00:03:17.530> we'll<00:03:17.680> do<00:03:17.800> this<00:03:17.950> again

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.160 

and<00:03:37.680> then<00:03:37.800> what<00:03:37.980> I<00:03:38.010> always<00:03:38.250> do<00:03:38.490> I'll<00:03:39.000> just<00:03:39.170> let

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
and then what I always do I'll just let

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:41.810 
and then what I always do I'll just let
the<00:03:40.320> locomotive<00:03:40.860> sit<00:03:41.100> and<00:03:41.250> let<00:03:41.370> the<00:03:41.520> rubbing

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:41.820 
the locomotive sit and let the rubbing

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:45.890 
the locomotive sit and let the rubbing
alcohol<00:03:41.940> dry<00:03:42.510> off<00:03:42.720> so<00:03:43.410> it<00:03:43.800> doesn't<00:03:44.870> get<00:03:45.870> all

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
alcohol dry off so it doesn't get all

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.800 
alcohol dry off so it doesn't get all
this<00:03:46.170> stuff<00:03:46.380> off<00:03:46.620> though<00:03:47.360> off<00:03:48.360> of<00:03:48.540> the<00:03:48.630> rails

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
this stuff off though off of the rails

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.840 
this stuff off though off of the rails
and<00:03:49.230> so<00:03:49.680> your<00:03:49.860> wheels<00:03:50.220> will<00:03:50.340> just<00:03:50.580> get<00:03:50.670> dirty

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
and so your wheels will just get dirty

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:51.440 
and so your wheels will just get dirty
again

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
again

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:54.020 
again
if<00:03:51.900> you<00:03:52.110> just<00:03:52.320> rub<00:03:52.860> run<00:03:53.310> your<00:03:53.490> locomotive

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
if you just rub run your locomotive

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.320 
if you just rub run your locomotive
right<00:03:54.210> after<00:03:54.830> you<00:03:55.830> cleaned<00:03:56.130> it<00:03:56.250> so<00:03:56.970> that's<00:03:57.210> how

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:57.330 
right after you cleaned it so that's how

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:58.940 
right after you cleaned it so that's how
you<00:03:57.390> clean<00:03:57.660> your<00:03:57.720> locomotive<00:03:58.290> wheels<00:03:58.590> see<00:03:58.890> you

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
you clean your locomotive wheels see you

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.430 
you clean your locomotive wheels see you
guys<00:03:59.070> next<00:03:59.280> time
