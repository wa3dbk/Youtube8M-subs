00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:14.070
 what have these harris q3 and hannibals 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.320
 Elephants, of course, together for one 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.000
 the color but also that she is wonderful 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.710
 come over the alps that has become audi 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.340
 thought on and has an extra tour 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.500
 Organized to test complaints 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.820
 before the austria to monaco and 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.710
 I could do that again 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.689
 Of course not to be missed and am 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.059
 also change small part of 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.950
 interlaken after meran with and 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.630
 Look at me today as this is 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:41.219
 car here because of this hard 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:43.739
 alpine passes prove the sportiest 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.170
 cars are called rs and now there are too 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.930
 from the compact suv q3 such a 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.719
 sport version the corner data 15 binding 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.940
 two and a half room 310 ps 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.219
 that's just the smallest member 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.219
 the family becomes a sports car 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.510
 quickly explained 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:02.250
 So at least since the porsche cayenne 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.750
 are sporty suv it yes 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:08.340
 become socially acceptable 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:10.799
 audi takes the smallest suv of her now 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.110
 portfolios namely the q3 and power 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:16.409
 from it a real racing message the rs 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:19.680
 good 3 yes, there is a q5 but just 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:24.240
 no rs q5 and thus the rs is q3 in 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:26.430
 who did the sportiest suv of audi in 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.140
 the swiss alps are always up 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.960
 and down thanks Quattro all-wheel drive 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:34.530
 you can quickly get to the Spitzkehr and 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:37.590
 the engine makes straight on straight fun 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.900
 the segment of compact suv very strong 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.580
 grow on and we see the only ones 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.990
 and the first in the competitive field 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.520
 with this car are on the market and exactly 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.430
 That's the point that irritated us 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.740
 to bring this vehicle now 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:52.259
 base of rs q3 is the normal q3 of the 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.860
 2011 his premiere celebrated with his 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:58.680
 In 228 kw, q3 outperformed the competition 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.470
 bmw with the x1 and mercedes with the 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:04.100
 new gla clearly in performance 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:09.830
 but also at the price at least 54 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:09.830
 1600 euro costs the s q3 in germany 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.959
 with the maximum suitability for everyday use 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.150
 through the functionality of the interior 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:25.890
 connects and a certain offroad 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.470
 fitness has also left behind 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.150
 to go but that is in this car 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.660
 probably decide less than always 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:37.560
 still high seating position although the ls 25 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:39.180
 mm is deeper than the normal q3 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.819
 I would go to the terrain with the 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:45.750
 audi rs3 of course not necessarily 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:49.200
 the whole offroad parts at the 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:51.450
 normal q3 in unpainted plastic 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.180
 they are painted and painted here 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.880
 you scratch yourself so immediately 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:03:00.150
 is already a suv for the street 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:02.849
 definitely the suspension is taut 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.739
 so the rs3 mediates despite this 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:07.290
 its focus sport with the many 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:09.540
 in 5 5 seconds he breaks through the 100 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:12.989
 The km / h mark is electronic 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.819
 Tempered at 250 to over 2,000 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:17.750
 heights we'll take a look at the car 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:17.750
 up close 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:26.269
 The redesigned front is from the single 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.269
 frame grill dominates honeycomb optics 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:33.080
 The wheelhouses are common everywhere 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:33.080
 there are high-gloss painted decorative elements 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:41.420
 a roof edge spoiler optimizes the 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:41.420
 contact pressure during fast driving 

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:47.890
 from the rs q3 on the 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:50.590
 alpenpÃ¤ssen but not curves 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:52.060
 Driving is more fun than always 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:54.610
 to slide straight ahead 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:56.530
 this is ensured by a handy balloon and the 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:59.680
 precisely coordinated steering 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:01.090
 Audi uses 8 8 liters of fuel 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.670
 at 100 kilometers 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:07.080
 that is only achieved 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:07.080
 without a joke fun 

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:23.830
 very exhausting with such a 

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:25.690
 quick car because you're always like that 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.940
 can drive fast as before 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:29.320
 but after eight hours I'm finally 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:32.880
 arrived in meran 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:32.880
 and now I have to recover first
