 or is it the Korean national team and maybe 

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:11.590
 a little bit afraid and our team 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:17.500
 because we are all used to 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:20.470
 last euro also strengthened in this 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:22.300
 center we do not have time sleep waiting waiting waiting 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:25.060
 but he himself must not leave his blow 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:27.510
 good sensitive that's understandable from 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.560
 partners do not have to wait for help 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.660
 the ninth number of the Korean team 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.789
 figured out here by herself some of us 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:36.249
 panic but for his kombaros left 

00:00:33.789 --> 00:00:39.309
 principle rules in the same place near Glushakov 

00:00:36.249 --> 00:00:42.729
 beats the wrong relationship rolled the ball 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:47.559
 lutsky ball hard to see you some 

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:51.129
 moment you must thick then go ooo 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:53.289
 Giacomo waits beats Yuri meme 00 match 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:56.150
 Russia korea starting for our team 

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:58.610
 for all of us as a commentator tion 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:00.640
 yes the team is our managed bounce as 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:00.640
 at 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:06.770
 of course so far help him no kamal 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.290
 played to the left 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.240
 so you can immediately hit 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.190
 from afar 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.460
 Yes 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:17.650
 the ball does not seem to be very strong 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:20.640
 mounted gate went decided not 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:20.640
 to risk from sin 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:33.070
 filing the road here it is well and 5 and 8 views 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.070
 on shock position beats 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:38.390
 It does not matter, it certainly was of course 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:41.000
 would be better if now calm 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:44.870
 depreciate up to catch long what 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.760
 necessary but but but but but we can not and hit on 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:51.800
 the gate is beaten great there is no need to close 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:53.990
 Igor is straight hanging this voltage and on 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.479
 to think than you did everything right given 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:59.150
 so what would kill quite right hit 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:02.210
 on goal yes what is a tank on 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:05.450
 sure moment and Korean daws you 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:09.580
 letting the first half out rebound all 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.580
 was but it is a nerve 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:15.580
 then kokorin was one shot on goal a 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.319
 on the counter will not give will not give kombar 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.030
 torture thought start not start 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:21.550
 but by defender from strikes alone 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:24.670
 all by no continuous thrust to strangers 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:26.910
 the gate, yes, here is a blow looked bounced 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.910
 under 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:35.190
 it is dangerous to give such a situation but what 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.900
 good pass good yes to install 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.790
 so when forward mindlessly Glushakov 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.070
 provoked so here he did not turn up in 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:44.460
 support zone 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:46.560
 oh-oh-oh-oh-oh strike 01 it all started with 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:47.850
 the fact that there is a secretly inaccurate pass to 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.920
 support zone anyone 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:51.920
 away hit but also saw father 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:02.600
 back sides 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:05.880
 but here Kerzhakov has a little 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:08.760
 which this time surely 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:10.440
 cold left it . and there is a violation 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.750
 was and think because you could 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:15.890
 show into the far corner beat very often 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.890
 on the runner
