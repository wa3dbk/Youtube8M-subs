00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:05.390

00:00:03.019 --> 00:00:06.890
 I promised you the october 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:07.999
 and we should have that 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:10.730
 Of course, now already the first 

00:00:07.999 --> 00:00:12.980
 nonetheless, i will be november 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:14.509
 enforce my books series 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.049
 she is promised to continue 

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:17.150
 been 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:20.060
 that's why it will give it I want 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:22.760
 today with you one of the first books 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:25.430
 I've read recently 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:27.619
 discuss with you and that is that 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.750
 the mechanics of the heart of matthias 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:32.930
 meisner I believe pronounced 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.670
 otherwise I like to report myself 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.050
 I got the book from 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.900
 my sister, because I am mine 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:41.870
 I wish it was via facebook in 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:43.580
 my timeline swam in and me 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.590
 I'm so interested in that 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:48.920
 but because of the title and we also because 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:50.960
 the great cover I'm for something like that 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.610
 in any case to have very much love 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.510
 I do not love love stories anymore 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.690
 I love fans 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:59.060
 and it's not really fantasy it is 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:02.060
 as well as on the back of the spine 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:04.460
 on it is a fairy tale in a team act 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:06.830
 style the language of the book is very 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:09.350
 playful atmospheric romantic 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.720
 somehow dreamy sometimes but also 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.460
 very sad very melancholic i have 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.170
 written on the program I have 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.540
 the book is still from two three hours 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.430
 has been through a nearly 200 pages 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:22.280
 So a little less that creates 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:24.260
 one loosely afterwards I wrote 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.700
 my heart was broken the language is 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:28.010
 really wonderful sometimes but also 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.140
 terribly sad and the end has me 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:33.460
 but very much taken away I am someone who 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:35.930
 is synonymous with series very with the figures 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.670
 involved he feels the then but 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:40.280
 very close so i always make my heart 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.180
 so on for any character that me 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.729
 interest 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.229
 and here it was like I have this one 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:47.180
 characters this story of course 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:49.130
 not long accompanied but so intense 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.890
 somehow because I speak that way 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.780
 was entrained that I then but 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.650
 come very close'm that sounds 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.630
 now a bit 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:02:01.100
 nokian but maybe one or the other 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:03.290
 others of i speak yes the book has 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.090
 great reviews in the review 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:07.790
 internet and that's why I have 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.979
 me too decided for me 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.480
 to wish 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:14.180
 I can still just read aloud 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.700
 what you write absolutely original 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.890
 glittering sparkle with unique 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.290
 metaphors a literary milestone 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.180
 oz wizard again i really have to 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.850
 say this whole book is one 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:28.130
 unique grand metaphor 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:30.110
 it is really very great 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.700
 I'll get you one right away 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:35.000
 read a small paragraph 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.890
 so you know what I mean it is 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.020
 a love story the characters 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.900
 are very young in it but it is 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:43.459
 Nevertheless, no children's book leaves the cover 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.890
 maybe you might suspect 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:48.260
 even the title but it is really for 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.190
 adult or for teenagers he already 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.709
 for adults 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:53.620
 there was 23 little see where i say 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:57.050
 okay, the main characters are okay 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.820
 actually still too young but I have there 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:00.739
 I almost shut my eyes off 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:03.350
 the story is very tied up especially 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:06.080
 because it also stimulates you for that 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:08.239
 thinking everyday and I think so too 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.769
 that the author is a bit like that 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:12.830
 He did not just want a fairy tale 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:14.570
 he also really has it that way 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:17.870
 a little bit done that one 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:20.959
 but also makes thoughts about the love 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:23.420
 or about his act or about his 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:24.430
 own say now chain the one 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.910
 tie like that 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:30.980
 it's about jack being born and 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:34.160
 his heart is unfortunately frozen beats 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:36.440
 not and there is a lady who lives 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:39.290
 on a mountain give him one 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:41.209
 Cuckoo clock is a mechanical heart 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:43.459
 so to speak this cuckoo clock is with 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:45.440
 connected to his own heart and brings 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:47.390
 to beat it, so to say, and the lady 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.310
 say to him you must never never 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:53.000
 lent because if you fall in love 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:54.799
 it will be so that my heart stops 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.420
 because it's the whole thing somehow 

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:58.190
 does not pack and what makes beats 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:00.080
 Of course he falls in love with him 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:01.790
 immortal and of course that has 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.720
 fear that your heart will 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:05.150
 can not stand 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:07.250
 but he is also ready for his love 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:09.080
 to fight and then swings the 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:09.950
 history so on I do not want to be like that 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.870
 tell a lot 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:13.760
 There are really great ones 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:15.880
 besides, the poor characterize the poor very much 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:18.769
 quickly grow to heart although she 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:19.430
 not so much in the book 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:21.380
 occurrence 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:24.740
 and of course there is also the 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:27.110
 evil rascals so to speak yes that there too 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:28.700
 still plays a role that is one 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:30.380
 bit the short summary i 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:32.840
 think so you can start something 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:35.450
 Should definitely be if you are 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:37.610
 For the criticism also interested in 

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:39.920
 read and maybe it is already 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:41.660
 a small gift will summit someone where 

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:44.420
 you think that could be to those 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:45.200
 I now have a lot of cds to you 

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:47.440
 just before 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:51.410
 maybe you will realize why I am 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:53.450
 so caught was actually the first 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:55.280
 page because i just speak this language 

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:56.570
 terrific, I had pictures immediately 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:58.790
 I've already realized that 

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:01.970
 cinematically presented and really needs 

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:03.410
 say it has such a little tim burton 

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:07.010
 I love that because I love the 

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:08.840
 we loved very much i start at edinburgh 

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:11.270
 and its steep streets make you one 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:13.610
 make a metamorphosis through the 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:15.590
 Fountain hazards bounces off 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:16.810
 as the river plays its role as a river 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:19.310
 otherwise takes very seriously 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:21.440
 disguises herself as icing sugar 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:23.210
 extends to the sea and that 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:25.430
 The sound of the surf sounds explanatory 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:27.050
 glass shards the hoarfrost conjures 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:29.900
 glittering sequins on gas fields 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:32.030
 cats and trees reminiscent of disgusting 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:34.700
 lack in wise after texts theirs 

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:37.010
 first projects and stretch the moon 

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:39.169
 to approach and calmly to see how the 

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:42.140
 Carriages on the pavement 

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:45.229
 sledge it is so bitter cold that 

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:46.130
 Birds in flight freeze in dead of 

00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:48.590
 fall sky 

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:48.960
 the impact is incredibly gentle for 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:51.569
 on 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:52.740
 rich of death it is the coldest day 

00:05:51.569 --> 00:05:54.780
 any times 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:57.090
 Today is the day I was born 

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:59.430
 this is one of the first 

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:03.150
 heels which I read because it is the 

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:04.650
 first two pages are in the book and 

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:06.630
 maybe you have noticed it is 

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:08.340
 absolutely magical is magic 

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:10.229
 insanely great pictures in the head is 

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:12.590
 but also in the first one 

00:06:10.229 --> 00:06:14.569
 very poignant and very 

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:17.220
 melancholy sympathy too 

00:06:14.569 --> 00:06:19.169
 heartbreaking and that's exactly what I have 

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:20.580
 maybe also needed and that's it 

00:06:19.169 --> 00:06:22.410
 I would also recommend if you have fun 

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:23.820
 because I did want to actually do 

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:26.250
 Do not say much more besides that 

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:28.430
 already definitely one of the top 

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:32.550
 Books I've ever read 

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:35.310
 So much for the mechanics of the heart 

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:37.259
 That was one of my book reviews 

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:39.180
 of course expects a little something 

00:06:37.259 --> 00:06:41.789
 I do not want to give too much away 

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:43.949
 but the bottroper series will 

00:06:41.789 --> 00:06:46.320
 I hope you have this 

00:06:43.949 --> 00:06:47.759
 video made fun i am looking forward to 

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:49.770
 to hear you write to me 

00:06:47.759 --> 00:06:51.449
 case book recommendation maybe in 

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:52.229
 the direction below in the comments 

00:06:51.449 --> 00:06:54.810
 purely 

00:06:52.229 --> 00:06:57.710
 we'll see you'll read again soon 

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:57.710
 make her good
