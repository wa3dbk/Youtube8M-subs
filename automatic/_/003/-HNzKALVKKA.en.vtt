it's really tempting to start a
photography<00:00:49.260> business<00:00:49.800> because<00:00:50.340> there's<00:00:50.550> so

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
first I'm gonna talk about why starting

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.930

a<00:00:58.020> photography<00:00:58.620> business<00:00:58.770> isn't<00:00:59.280> necessarily

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
for me now in no way does that mean I

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.609 
for me now in no way does that mean I
don't<00:01:02.940> know<00:01:03.180> how<00:01:03.270> to<00:01:03.329> take<00:01:03.570> great<00:01:03.780> pictures<00:01:03.989> or

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
requires because it does require a lot

there's<00:03:46.419> a<00:03:46.480> lot<00:03:46.780> of<00:03:46.989> pressure<00:03:47.260> and<00:03:47.709> time<00:03:48.400> that

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:48.639 
there's a lot of pressure and time that

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:50.220 
there's a lot of pressure and time that
goes<00:03:48.760> into<00:03:49.030> it<00:03:49.180> and<00:03:49.209> like<00:03:49.569> I<00:03:49.690> said<00:03:49.750> tears

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 
goes into it and like I said tears

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:52.440 
goes into it and like I said tears
because<00:03:50.590> it's<00:03:51.250> a<00:03:51.370> really<00:03:51.519> personal<00:03:52.060> business

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.450 
because it's a really personal business

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:54.330 
because it's a really personal business
when<00:03:52.810> I<00:03:52.840> when<00:03:53.290> I<00:03:53.319> thought<00:03:53.590> about<00:03:53.709> going<00:03:53.950> into<00:03:54.190> a

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
when I when I thought about going into a

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.309 
when I when I thought about going into a
business<00:03:54.579> I<00:03:55.030> wanted<00:03:55.660> to<00:03:55.810> do<00:03:55.930> a<00:03:55.959> business

00:03:56.309 --> 00:03:56.319 
business I wanted to do a business

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:58.319 
business I wanted to do a business
because<00:03:56.530> first<00:03:56.980> of<00:03:57.160> all<00:03:57.250> I<00:03:57.310> was<00:03:57.609> 18<00:03:58.120> when<00:03:58.269> I

00:03:58.319 --> 00:03:58.329 
because first of all I was 18 when I

00:03:58.329 --> 00:03:59.879 
because first of all I was 18 when I
started<00:03:58.750> my<00:03:58.840> business<00:03:58.989> so<00:03:59.319> I<00:03:59.349> didn't<00:03:59.709> have<00:03:59.799> a

00:03:59.879 --> 00:03:59.889 
started my business so I didn't have a

00:03:59.889 --> 00:04:01.680 
started my business so I didn't have a
family<00:04:00.099> like<00:04:00.430> she<00:04:00.609> did<00:04:00.790> I<00:04:00.940> didn't<00:04:01.150> have<00:04:01.299> kids

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:01.690 
family like she did I didn't have kids

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:02.430 
family like she did I didn't have kids
to<00:04:01.900> worry<00:04:02.049> about

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 
to worry about

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:03.990 
to worry about
and<00:04:02.590> I'm<00:04:02.799> not<00:04:02.889> saying<00:04:03.220> just<00:04:03.310> because<00:04:03.669> you<00:04:03.819> have

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
and I'm not saying just because you have

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.610 
and I'm not saying just because you have
kids<00:04:04.299> or<00:04:04.480> your<00:04:04.630> stay-at-home<00:04:05.169> mom<00:04:05.349> doesn't

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
kids or your stay-at-home mom doesn't

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.140 
kids or your stay-at-home mom doesn't
mean<00:04:05.829> you<00:04:05.950> can't<00:04:06.220> have<00:04:06.280> a<00:04:06.400> business<00:04:06.609> because

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 
mean you can't have a business because

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.599 
mean you can't have a business because
you<00:04:07.299> certainly<00:04:07.569> can<00:04:08.049> if<00:04:08.319> you<00:04:08.889> give<00:04:09.190> yourself

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:09.609 
you certainly can if you give yourself

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:10.430 
you certainly can if you give yourself
the<00:04:09.760> time<00:04:10.060> and<00:04:10.239> the

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
the time and the

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:11.830 
the time and the
effort<00:04:10.680> that<00:04:10.830> it<00:04:10.920> needs<00:04:11.190> to<00:04:11.430> grow<00:04:11.550> a<00:04:11.640> business

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 
effort that it needs to grow a business

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.710 
effort that it needs to grow a business
but<00:04:12.840> I<00:04:13.080> started<00:04:13.620> it<00:04:13.740> because<00:04:13.770> I<00:04:14.630> honestly<00:04:15.630> I

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
but I started it because I honestly I

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.509 
but I started it because I honestly I
just<00:04:16.049> really<00:04:16.440> knew<00:04:16.739> that<00:04:16.920> I<00:04:16.950> wanted<00:04:17.280> to<00:04:17.400> go

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
into that as a career and so when I

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:21.979

business owner you're gonna be doing a
lot<00:05:29.700> of<00:05:29.730> other<00:05:30.060> stuff<00:05:30.390> behind<00:05:30.570> the<00:05:30.780> scenes

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:30.840 
lot of other stuff behind the scenes

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:32.630 
lot of other stuff behind the scenes
that<00:05:31.260> has<00:05:31.410> absolutely<00:05:31.680> nothing<00:05:32.220> to<00:05:32.430> do<00:05:32.610> with

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:32.640 
that has absolutely nothing to do with

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:34.909 
that has absolutely nothing to do with
photography<00:05:33.300> so<00:05:33.960> if<00:05:34.050> you're<00:05:34.169> ready<00:05:34.350> to<00:05:34.620> accept

00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:34.919 
photography so if you're ready to accept

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:36.800 
photography so if you're ready to accept
all<00:05:35.220> of<00:05:35.340> that<00:05:35.490> responsibility<00:05:36.030> then<00:05:36.630> it's

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:36.810 
all of that responsibility then it's

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:38.360 
all of that responsibility then it's
probably<00:05:36.960> time<00:05:37.440> for<00:05:37.470> you<00:05:37.680> to<00:05:37.830> start<00:05:38.040> thinking

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:38.370 
probably time for you to start thinking

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:40.220 
probably time for you to start thinking
about<00:05:38.640> a<00:05:38.669> business<00:05:38.910> but<00:05:39.630> if<00:05:39.720> you<00:05:39.840> haven't<00:05:40.140> even

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:40.230 
about a business but if you haven't even

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:41.750 
about a business but if you haven't even
thought<00:05:40.500> about<00:05:40.560> it<00:05:40.919> yet<00:05:41.070> then<00:05:41.310> you<00:05:41.460> really

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:41.760 
thought about it yet then you really

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:43.820 
thought about it yet then you really
need<00:05:41.790> to<00:05:41.940> consider<00:05:42.240> that<00:05:42.510> and<00:05:42.900> do<00:05:43.680> your

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:43.830 
need to consider that and do your

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:45.350 
need to consider that and do your
homework<00:05:43.980> know<00:05:44.490> everything<00:05:44.910> that<00:05:45.030> goes<00:05:45.180> into

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:45.360 
homework know everything that goes into

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.750 
homework know everything that goes into
it<00:05:45.510> before<00:05:46.290> you<00:05:46.500> make<00:05:46.650> that<00:05:46.860> move<00:05:47.100> to<00:05:47.340> start<00:05:47.610> a

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:47.760 
it before you make that move to start a

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:50.150 
it before you make that move to start a
photography<00:05:48.300> business<00:05:48.419> so<00:05:49.290> that's<00:05:49.620> exactly

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:50.160 
photography business so that's exactly

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:52.430 
photography business so that's exactly
why<00:05:50.580> I<00:05:50.610> have<00:05:51.240> continued<00:05:51.750> to<00:05:51.780> take<00:05:52.080> pictures

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:52.440 
why I have continued to take pictures

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:54.770 
why I have continued to take pictures
for<00:05:52.680> myself<00:05:53.130> and<00:05:53.460> for<00:05:53.640> a<00:05:53.700> couple<00:05:54.450> of<00:05:54.510> close

family and friends here and there but
that's<00:05:58.470> it<00:05:58.680> and<00:05:59.640> just<00:06:00.450> because<00:06:00.930> you<00:06:01.080> might<00:06:01.200> not

be ready to start today doesn't mean

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:03.950 
be ready to start today doesn't mean
that<00:06:02.850> you<00:06:02.970> might<00:06:03.120> not<00:06:03.300> work<00:06:03.450> up<00:06:03.690> to<00:06:03.840> it
