00:00:00.459 --> 00:00:05.070
 hello friends as stands we are going to make a shirt with a tie for the day 

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:06.030
 of the father 

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:10.280
 the tie we make of the Iranian people we are going to take a role of who was said 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.139
 by 15 centimeters 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:14.439
 let's work on the wrong side 

00:00:14.439 --> 00:00:17.079
 sweating one end towards the other 

00:00:17.079 --> 00:00:19.989
 in the form of a panel 

00:00:19.989 --> 00:00:22.989
 matching and on the edges 

00:00:25.249 --> 00:00:28.249
 and marked the center line 

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:30.899
 Fariña frames 

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:34.029
 and added there are people our role on the back side 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.160
 let's take from the top edge 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:42.360
 towards that tuna point we are going to overturn everything they did the center line 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:47.400
 and dialed 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.690
 good zaplana 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.610
 if I do the same job on the other side 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.610
 came to the center line from the top edge 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.680
 that the province comes 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.680
 and we mark 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.330
 Adriano 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:11.030
 and we're going to turn our work around on the right side 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:14.130
 Let's throw 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.430
 an imaginary line that the artist is targeted 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.720
 it does it to our top tip 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.470
 towards that imaginary line 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.470
 by the center line 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.730
 they appealed 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:32.730
 both sides 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:38.850
 and does not want work 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.049
 again now let's spend we're going to be about an inch 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.020
 and we're going to take our top tip along the center line 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.840
 there are 60 and subway 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.120
 and again to plane 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.120
 let's show here they speak or both sides 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.780
 there is one that speaks our work 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.750
 let's see again also machinery that passes in front of sa 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:07.479
 tip 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:10.479
 and we're going to dump the whole top on 

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:12.899
 that imaginary line 

00:02:12.899 --> 00:02:16.319
 respecting the center line doing a job 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:18.179
 it does not twist 

00:02:18.179 --> 00:02:20.609
 flattened both sides 

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:23.119
 and now comes an important step 

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:25.399
 and I want you to see that here 

00:02:25.399 --> 00:02:28.009
 that has formed a small triangle 

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:32.999
 and we are going to sow is fattening and I have to know that here is the child and 

00:02:32.999 --> 00:02:35.999
 santander 

00:02:37.389 --> 00:02:40.469
 we double 

00:02:40.469 --> 00:02:43.869
 up is very small the doubles 

00:02:43.869 --> 00:02:45.559
 to plane 

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:47.369
 and I add 

00:02:47.369 --> 00:02:49.149
 we do the same 

00:02:49.149 --> 00:02:50.729
 to the other side 

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:53.729
 according to the tip like this in the horizontal line 

00:02:56.469 --> 00:02:58.949
 appealing 

00:02:58.949 --> 00:03:00.319
 and I speak 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:05.039
 when we have and what steps we are going to turn our work over backwards 

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:07.919
 let's take this side to 

00:03:07.919 --> 00:03:10.359
 the center line 

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:13.409
 clarifies will betis betis to open a little the upper room 

00:03:13.969 --> 00:03:16.789
 and where we offered to reside 

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:18.289
 the triangular 

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:19.279
 Thus 

00:03:19.279 --> 00:03:24.159
 from there they gave him desirable talking everything down 

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:26.329
 I will show here 

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:29.480
 here yes the same continuation of the line then in the 

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:36.719
 and without him this the little trick that we just made, therefore, only 

00:03:36.719 --> 00:03:39.829
 flattened in and then what you are seeing 

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:43.269
 he threw it out 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:46.399
 and that will give us the knot of the tie 

00:03:46.399 --> 00:03:48.559
 the same thing I do on the other side 

00:03:48.559 --> 00:03:51.559
 if I reach the lateral centerline 

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:58.959
 keko said the center line 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:01.959
 carefully to the plane 

00:04:02.719 --> 00:04:05.829
 I'm opening down to planes and down 

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:11.729
 talking in the inside 

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:14.929
 is within which they observed well 

00:04:14.929 --> 00:04:18.449
 and there are snapshots crutch again so the planes and inside 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:22.229
 and he threw me out 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:25.800
 of gotovina employ landmark 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.689
 turn it around our work and we have a lot of tie finished 

00:04:30.749 --> 00:04:33.409
 to make the shirt 

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:34.830
 let's drink 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:37.919
 a card, take it out 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:40.419
 sacristan card shape 

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:43.520
 let's count for this size and tie for the size 

00:04:44.809 --> 00:04:48.360
 soon we will take from the top edge about three centimeters 

00:04:48.969 --> 00:04:50.719
 both sides 

00:04:50.719 --> 00:04:53.180
 we cut 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:55.430
 about two and a half centimeters 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:59.060
 also from both sides and follow the board higher 

00:05:00.059 --> 00:05:01.339
 Asia 

00:05:01.339 --> 00:05:03.650
 center 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:05.289
 we clarify 

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:09.299
 also from both sides inaba that enable shirt collar 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:13.210
 we put the tie under 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:17.760
 and to morán to the can can a few degrees in the corners 

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:21.860
 like buttons and here are we will be to remove the father's day 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:23.249
 lita 

00:05:23.249 --> 00:05:24.449
 it ended 

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:27.059
 I'm going to show others to 

00:05:27.059 --> 00:05:29.819
 has been thrown 

00:05:29.819 --> 00:05:34.249
 You're also going to catalog as I said earlier as a button 

00:05:34.879 --> 00:05:38.050
 I hope you liked work can do it 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:38.780
 thank you
