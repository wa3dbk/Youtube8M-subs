 so honestly i go only here it is 2 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:33.990
 mini game don't think it's not me 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:38.210
 scary is all this I built then rides 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:43.970
 with might and main stream this bidet game is cool 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:48.270
 only as will version 1 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:51.329
 Well, in short, when there will be an enchantment version 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:57.870
 add then you can in this game 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:02:01.860
 play and now it's useless here 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:09.200
 you appear here here as always 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:14.670
 the rule is all such a game is called archer 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:16.440
 well i don't know what is called i forgot not 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:23.580
 invented shorter to rank 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:31.890
 this game players must survive the players go 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:36.570
 here here and here they see that's two chests 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:39.050
 water perch food in the second torch I 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:56.960
 I'll tell you later 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:03:00.810
 gives so here you are here and here 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:08.760
 archer jacket then arrows 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:12.140
 here bows and armor are also shorter 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:16.620
 I am now telling you about the torch 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:23.550
 so that food drops sand or 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:26.430
 gravel and you are stuck there 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:28.800
 this edge is falling and you are stuck there you are 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:31.110
 use break one block and set 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:37.440
 foger but file type 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:41.420
 bibera vat and everything falls sand 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:44.180
 it is necessary to rise to the very top and there 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:49.800
 run over the tunnel 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:53.700
 boat adab then later on the tunnel most 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:56.790
 last i'm not until the end of the tunnel all 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:04:00.570
 making one tunnel left for the archer 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:03.450
 and one tunnel for the player when he 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:05.260
 rises here it turns out in such 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:08.319
 room where 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:11.670
 yes wear armor 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:16.720
 and enter and bow 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:20.109
 takes and archers evil kills the player too 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:26.050
 and other players in the kill until you kill 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:27.250
 its you then not won and when all the players 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:32.580
 have died 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:38.350
 then all the archer won 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:45.360
 further there is a rule the essence of the game and myself 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:49.060
 the author is I myself do not build anything 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:57.400
 I do not download so I will give you this drew 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:05:02.010
 masks and so all that stuff and all the rules 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:06.479
 standard and still can not be used 

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:10.570
 gay mod about oak etc. 

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:16.449
 or all of these teams 

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:19.720
 add add wot 0.8.0 here then 

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:25.919
 teams will add and they can not 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:32.410
 I speak immediately and everything is fine 

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:36.330
 the next will be my card i build 

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:36.330
 there will be a map and the hunger games 

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:45.010
 difficult they are fun there is not necessary 

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:47.889
 run all over the dome map polls 

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:50.770
 run around and kill everyone as you kill 

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:55.539
 so you win and the hunger games 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:06:00.090
 already on the new version of now 

00:05:55.539 --> 00:06:03.729
