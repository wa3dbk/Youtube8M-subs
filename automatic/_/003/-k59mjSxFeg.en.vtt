table here here's the reason why I want
to<00:00:32.700> put<00:00:32.850> this<00:00:33.090> pulley<00:00:33.390> here<00:00:33.750> on<00:00:33.960> this<00:00:34.620> engine

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
to put this pulley here on this engine

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.280 
to put this pulley here on this engine
and<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.940> hole<00:00:36.090> in<00:00:36.239> this<00:00:36.390> pulley<00:00:36.600> here<00:00:36.840> is<00:00:37.020> one

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
and the hole in this pulley here is one

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.709 
and the hole in this pulley here is one
inch<00:00:37.530> and<00:00:37.800> it's<00:00:38.070> 3/4<00:00:38.730> inch<00:00:38.879> on<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.329> engine

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
inch and it's 3/4 inch on the engine

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.979 
inch and it's 3/4 inch on the engine
this<00:00:40.410> is<00:00:40.590> what's<00:00:40.770> going<00:00:40.980> to<00:00:41.070> happen<00:00:41.489> it<00:00:41.969> is<00:00:42.510> way

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
this is what's going to happen it is way

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.100 
this is what's going to happen it is way
too<00:00:43.050> loose<00:00:44.000> so<00:00:45.000> by<00:00:45.149> installing<00:00:45.510> that<00:00:45.750> sleeve

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
too loose so by installing that sleeve

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.540 
too loose so by installing that sleeve
it's<00:00:46.350> going<00:00:46.530> to<00:00:46.590> make<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:46.829> pulley<00:00:47.039> nice<00:00:47.280> and

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
it's going to make the pulley nice and

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.029 
it's going to make the pulley nice and
tight<00:00:47.730> on<00:00:47.850> that<00:00:47.940> engine<00:00:48.500> the<00:00:49.500> reason<00:00:49.860> why<00:00:50.010> I

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
tight on that engine the reason why I

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.979 
tight on that engine the reason why I
need<00:00:50.280> to<00:00:50.399> put<00:00:50.579> this<00:00:50.730> big<00:00:51.000> pulley<00:00:51.239> here<00:00:51.510> on<00:00:51.690> this

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
need to put this big pulley here on this

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.110 
need to put this big pulley here on this
engine<00:00:52.320> is<00:00:52.920> because<00:00:53.370> I'm<00:00:53.520> installing<00:00:54.030> that

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
engine is because I'm installing that

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.119 
engine is because I'm installing that
engine<00:00:54.510> on<00:00:54.690> this<00:00:54.899> snow<00:00:55.110> blower<00:00:55.320> over<00:00:55.710> here<00:00:55.949> and

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
engine on this snow blower over here and

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.340 
engine on this snow blower over here and
this<00:00:56.910> er<00:00:57.059> was<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.420> original<00:00:57.780> pulley<00:00:58.050> from

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
this er was the original pulley from

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.470 
this er was the original pulley from
that<00:00:58.590> snow<00:00:58.859> blower<00:00:59.100> so<00:00:59.370> I<00:00:59.399> definitely<00:00:59.699> have<00:01:00.239> to

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
that snow blower so I definitely have to

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.029 
that snow blower so I definitely have to
use<00:01:00.660> it<00:01:00.840> so<00:01:00.870> that<00:01:01.050> it<00:01:01.289> matches<00:01:01.469> up<00:01:01.770> with<00:01:01.920> the

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
use it so that it matches up with the

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.399 
use it so that it matches up with the
belts<00:01:02.399> so<00:01:03.390> when<00:01:03.539> you<00:01:03.629> replace<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:03.930> engine<00:01:04.080> on

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
belts so when you replace the engine on

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:05.870 
belts so when you replace the engine on
the<00:01:04.530> snowblower<00:01:04.920> you<00:01:05.220> want<00:01:05.400> to<00:01:05.489> make<00:01:05.610> sure<00:01:05.760> you

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
the snowblower you want to make sure you

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.330 
the snowblower you want to make sure you
keep<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.240> same<00:01:06.420> pulleys<00:01:06.900> or<00:01:07.170> have<00:01:07.799> some<00:01:08.130> that

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
keep the same pulleys or have some that

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.190 
keep the same pulleys or have some that
are<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.580> same<00:01:08.790> size<00:01:09.060> and<00:01:09.390> this<00:01:09.780> way<00:01:09.990> here<00:01:10.170> I

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
are the same size and this way here I

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.410 
are the same size and this way here I
can<00:01:10.409> slap<00:01:10.619> it<00:01:10.830> on<00:01:10.920> that<00:01:11.100> engine<00:01:11.310> install<00:01:12.270> the

to<00:01:36.750> use<00:01:36.900> a<00:01:37.049> nice<00:01:37.320> ease<00:01:37.530> on<00:01:37.740> my<00:01:37.920> crankshaft<00:01:38.460> so

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
to use a nice ease on my crankshaft so

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.179 
to use a nice ease on my crankshaft so
when<00:01:38.729> I<00:01:38.759> install<00:01:39.119> pulleys<00:01:39.540> on<00:01:39.689> them<00:01:39.900> and<00:01:40.189> it's

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
when I install pulleys on them and it's

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:42.740 
when I install pulleys on them and it's
the<00:01:41.250> same<00:01:41.310> thing<00:01:41.520> if<00:01:41.820> I'm<00:01:42.000> going<00:01:42.210> to<00:01:42.360> install

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
the same thing if I'm going to install

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.160 
the same thing if I'm going to install
one<00:01:42.930> of<00:01:42.960> these<00:01:43.170> adapters<00:01:43.829> and<00:01:44.930> you<00:01:45.930> can<00:01:46.079> be

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
one of these adapters and you can be

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.170 
one of these adapters and you can be
generous<00:01:46.590> with<00:01:46.890> your<00:01:47.070> NTC's<00:01:47.670> when<00:01:47.909> you<00:01:48.000> do

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
generous with your NTC's when you do

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.569 
generous with your NTC's when you do
this<00:01:48.619> also<00:01:49.619> going<00:01:49.770> to<00:01:49.829> make<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.070> sleep<00:01:50.310> go<00:01:50.430> on

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
this also going to make the sleep go on

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.480 
this also going to make the sleep go on
much<00:01:50.820> easier<00:01:51.470> now<00:01:52.470> you<00:01:52.530> need<00:01:52.740> to<00:01:52.860> separate<00:01:53.340> the

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
much easier now you need to separate the

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.030 
much easier now you need to separate the
key<00:01:53.700> from<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.119> adapter<00:01:54.689> in<00:01:54.869> this<00:01:55.590> case<00:01:55.829> here

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
key from the adapter in this case here

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.980 
key from the adapter in this case here
I'm<00:01:56.130> going<00:01:56.280> to<00:01:56.460> install<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:56.969> adapter<00:01:57.240> on<00:01:57.689> the

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
I'm going to install the adapter on the

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.840 
I'm going to install the adapter on the
crankshaft<00:01:58.320> in<00:01:58.710> this<00:01:58.890> position<00:01:59.369> here<00:01:59.670> and

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
crankshaft in this position here and

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.850 
crankshaft in this position here and
when<00:02:00.630> you<00:02:00.750> install<00:02:00.990> it<00:02:01.140> you<00:02:01.320> want<00:02:01.590> to<00:02:01.680> line<00:02:01.829> up

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
when you install it you want to line up

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.770 
when you install it you want to line up
the<00:02:02.130> keyway<00:02:02.490> hole<00:02:02.700> on<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:03.000> crankshaft<00:02:03.299> and

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
the keyway hole on the crankshaft and

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:09.669 
the keyway hole on the crankshaft and
the<00:02:04.140> hole<00:02:04.350> on<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:04.649> adapter<00:02:05.189> sleeve

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:11.470 

and<00:02:09.979> now<00:02:10.250> you<00:02:10.310> want<00:02:10.549> to<00:02:10.579> install<00:02:10.879> the<00:02:11.030> key<00:02:11.269> in

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
and now you want to install the key in

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.289 
and now you want to install the key in
this<00:02:11.659> position<00:02:12.170> here<00:02:12.349> facing<00:02:12.799> down<00:02:13.040> as<00:02:13.310> you

00:02:14.289 --> 00:02:14.299 
this position here facing down as you

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:15.940 
this position here facing down as you
can<00:02:14.420> see<00:02:14.659> it's<00:02:14.780> slightly<00:02:14.870> smaller<00:02:15.620> on<00:02:15.920> the

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
can see it's slightly smaller on the

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:17.740 
can see it's slightly smaller on the
bottom<00:02:16.579> this<00:02:16.760> is<00:02:16.819> the<00:02:16.970> part<00:02:17.299> that<00:02:17.329> will<00:02:17.599> go<00:02:17.720> on

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
bottom this is the part that will go on

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.440 
bottom this is the part that will go on
the<00:02:18.079> engine<00:02:18.470> crankshaft<00:02:18.970> now<00:02:19.970> if<00:02:20.060> you<00:02:20.150> do<00:02:20.299> get

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
the engine crankshaft now if you do get

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:21.940 
the engine crankshaft now if you do get
one<00:02:20.510> of<00:02:20.720> these<00:02:20.840> kits<00:02:21.110> and<00:02:21.349> you<00:02:21.409> find<00:02:21.650> it<00:02:21.769> hard

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
one of these kits and you find it hard

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:23.740 
one of these kits and you find it hard
to<00:02:22.129> fit<00:02:22.340> the<00:02:22.519> key<00:02:22.730> on<00:02:22.939> the<00:02:23.090> engine<00:02:23.390> crankshaft

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
to fit the key on the engine crankshaft

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.960 
to fit the key on the engine crankshaft
what<00:02:24.650> you<00:02:24.799> might<00:02:24.950> need<00:02:25.069> to<00:02:25.220> do<00:02:25.340> is<00:02:25.430> put<00:02:25.640> it<00:02:25.760> in<00:02:25.879> a

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
what you might need to do is put it in a

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.030 
what you might need to do is put it in a
vise<00:02:26.120> like<00:02:26.359> this<00:02:26.540> like<00:02:26.720> I<00:02:26.870> did<00:02:27.200> and<00:02:27.470> with<00:02:28.010> a

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
vise like this like I did and with a

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.099 
vise like this like I did and with a
chain<00:02:28.370> saw<00:02:28.400> file<00:02:28.849> just<00:02:29.120> file<00:02:29.450> it<00:02:29.480> a<00:02:29.659> few<00:02:29.930> times

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:30.109 
chain saw file just file it a few times

00:02:30.109 --> 00:02:36.759 
chain saw file just file it a few times
and<00:02:34.780> then<00:02:35.780> it<00:02:35.959> will<00:02:36.079> fit<00:02:36.260> in<00:02:36.379> there<00:02:36.530> nice<00:02:36.739> and

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:36.769 
and then it will fit in there nice and

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:37.270 
and then it will fit in there nice and
easy

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
easy

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.490

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
also if the top part of the key here is

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.530 
also if the top part of the key here is
too<00:02:39.829> wide<00:02:40.040> for<00:02:40.069> your<00:02:40.489> pulley<00:02:40.760> you<00:02:40.879> may<00:02:41.150> need<00:02:41.329> to

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
too wide for your pulley you may need to

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.509 
too wide for your pulley you may need to
do<00:02:41.629> the<00:02:41.780> same<00:02:41.989> by<00:02:42.200> just<00:02:42.440> filing<00:02:42.950> this<00:02:43.190> side
