 Hello youtubers! Welcome to my first video, where we are going to make a nail design inspired by the new song by Sistar "Give it to me". I hope you enjoy :) 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
 We start with the nail of the middle finger painted red, let's draw a pattern to create a pendant 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
 Wet a toothpick in nail polish and draw a crescent shape and straight lines down 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
 Here I am using a glitter enamel but you can use a transparent one or even the red one we use as a base 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
 Then with a brush or whatever you prefer, print it with dry glitter and stick it on the lines we just created 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
 Sorry, I forgot to press the engraving button when I painted the nail of the ring finger 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 Basically, you only have to paint the black nail and on it a few layers of the glitter enamel that you choose 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:18.000
 For the little finger, draw a diagonal line and cover the bottom space. You can use a piece of zeal to help you with this 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.000
 At the edge of the line, follow the same steps as we did on the middle finger 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 Paint your big toe black and create a "glitter rain" effect 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.000
 To do this, apply a thick layer of glitter enamel at the base of the nail and with the enamel free brush we will drag it down 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.000
 Do this two or three times, or until you are happy with the result 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:02.000
 For the index finger, paint it silver and apply a few layers of glitter enamel 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:12.000
 and with a finite brush dipped in black enamel, start writing the name of the group 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000
 Do not do the dot of the "i" yet, it's going to be a red star 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:44.000
 If you do not have a fine brush you can always use a toothpick, as I am showing here 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000
 To finish cover all the nails with a layer of protective enamel, and we finished! 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:02.000
