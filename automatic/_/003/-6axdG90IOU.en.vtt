00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:23.920
 I saw a super trend that I did not 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:25.840
 I also noticed in Brazil that it's coming. 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:29.100
 there too everyone is already 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:32.679

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:35.050
 Tied around the waist, I'll show you 

00:00:32.679 --> 00:00:37.600

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:39.819
 You inspire me and I want to leave. 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.589
 to a different side such 

00:00:39.819 --> 00:00:43.659

00:00:41.589 --> 00:00:46.269

00:00:43.659 --> 00:00:49.719

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:52.179
 this cause is a military style one 

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:53.649
 Normal blue shirt so stamped with 

00:00:52.179 --> 00:00:57.370
 flag of london 

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:59.709
 And that check shirt is not just 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.569
 a grid that can use this 

00:00:59.709 --> 00:01:02.920
 this style of khamis tied in the 

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:05.350
 waist 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:08.470
 then demonstrate at 3,600 you can 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:11.140

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:13.750

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:16.090
 florida're in that super to use it 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.740
 with an ace strapped to the waist with a 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.240
 black pants here looks beautiful 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.210
 mainly so because it is clear 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:25.810

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:28.270

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:35.560
 the second I wanted to show in the 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:38.890
 The fabric is not the truth here. 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:41.380
 striped it's not really a shirt 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:46.330
 but you can also use it as a style 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:49.570
 as if it were one by one 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:51.130
 one since only cloth can also 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:55.930
 to tie normal 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:57.640

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.770

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.830
