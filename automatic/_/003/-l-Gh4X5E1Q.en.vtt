00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.809
 I hope you slept well on my 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.849
 chain today I propose you 4 and 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:18.180
 hairstyles 1 made with 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.529
 vanilla then for the first hairstyle 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.220
 you are going to need two 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.230
 elastic 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.720
 we will start with his sponsors 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.789
 hair in two parts and on one of 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.349
 parties you're going to do a bit to 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:32.029
 forward to you will keep some 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.029
 wicks to make a wick in the front 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.020
 so we'll take a few locks so 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.180
 those few games we left and 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.719
 we're going to find them it's actually for 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:45.420
 form a kind of banana 2min 

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:48.329
 so then you will hold this 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.789
 wick is selected some hair 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:54.270
 underneath to make a vanilla 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:57.090
 collar so we will spend an arrow 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.859
 above and take locks in 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.969
 below and so on you go them 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.969
 pass over 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.840
 we understand a nasty under we're going 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:13.050
 go over a shift below 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:13.890
 will go over on the back 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.590
 of the head 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.850
 we will make a big vanilla with 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.850
 the rest of the wicks 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.820
 and we're going to keep it all with a 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.820
 elastic 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:47.020
 and that's it for the first side for the 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.740
 second side we will proceed from the same 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:52.390
 way we divide into two locks and 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.810
 then we learn the wick of the back or 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:58.210
 that we will go over the wick of 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:01.060
 below we'll go over the 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:05.400
 precedence wick and 1 above arrives 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.400
 at the end we realize a big zain 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:15.090
 you could see it for the previous 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:18.329
 for the previous vanilla arrived at 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.609
 butt game but the elastic and for that 

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:22.859
 be a little bit prettier 

00:02:19.609 --> 00:02:30.780
 I bring the strands on strike in 

00:02:22.859 --> 00:02:39.629
 the lastic the matches at goal and that's it 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:41.430
 for the first hairstyle on the front 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:42.959
 at the second hairstyle for the 2nd 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.870
 hairstyle you will just need a 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:48.650
 pin or a large elastic 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:51.209
 since we will actually make a bun 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:53.549
 so there we finally with locks 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:53.970
 I use wicks that are hassi 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:56.370
 rech 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.709
 so in the end it clings well between 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:02.239
 they so with a simple pin 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:02.239
 I can make a bun 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:12.180
 here we are I mention bun with my 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.180
 pin 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:19.980
 and the little trick to color a 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:22.709
 little bit this bun I'm going to use 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.540
 my necklace my necklace that you can 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:26.970
 find on and blessed shop you had to 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.640
 see the previous also etc the parcels 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:33.150
 you can customize so with the 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:35.170
 fabric that you want to go to the 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:39.080
 third car 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:41.660
 so here we are going to make a hairstyle of a 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.760
 side and on the other side let's leave 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:45.530
 detached hair moncla i'm going 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:49.370
 select a small amount of 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:51.880
 wicks on my left side my side 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:51.880
 right earlier 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:58.390
 and the device I will realize a 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:58.390
 vanilla collar 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:03.630
 with the same principle we take a wick 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:05.190
 below we pass it above 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:08.580
 take an ax under it 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:09.840
 above and so there now I you 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:13.110
 shows in the back how I proceed 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:14.550
 to maintain this wick and for its 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:16.370
 natural phase for me who have full 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:18.870
 to pin that goes out in every way 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:21.440
 and also to precisely hide his 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:24.300
 pins for his truly natural pass 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:27.030
 so here you are going to actually take the 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:30.360
 vanilla and you're just going to take a 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:32.660
 branches in actually vanilla that 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.770
 you will maintain with pins 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:39.120
 so it is better to take the branch 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:41.190
 which is above to maintain the 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:44.010
 mania that you realized and for more 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:48.140
 easily also hide it so light 

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:48.140
 used three pins to maintain it 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:57.000
 and then here we cover 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:57.000
 and a unique un 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:05.770
 and that's what it gives to the back 

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:14.630
 and here is the front 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:17.320
 have customized a little bit of everything with 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:23.160
 a little pin 

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:23.160
 with flowers and that's the result 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:29.260
 but if you're a fan of the left you 

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:31.780
 have preferred and also if you are more 

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:33.430
 vanilla or box bresse that interests me a 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:35.860
 little bit too to know down what 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:37.480
 I can offer you as a hairstyle and 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:40.390
 you do not hesitate to put all these 

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:42.700
 comments have gone to the hairstyle in 

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:45.220
 number 4 at the last hairstyle so there 

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:47.590
 you will need to pin and a 

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:49.300
 big scarf because and so the same 

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:51.940
 can also find him on and blessed 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:53.350
 shop and you can customize so 

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:55.710
 the same principle as before 

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:59.650
 will select wicks at the front 

00:05:55.710 --> 00:06:00.370
 that we will roll up to make a kind 

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:02.260
 of bananas 

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:05.350
 Then we will take some locks on 

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:09.760
 sides to tie this banana to 

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:14.080
 the front we will make a knot hair 

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:20.400
 in the back so we'll regroup them 

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:20.400
 and we will maintain them with two eras 

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:27.240
 2 

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:38.330
 it does not matter if it's not born well 

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:40.070
 there are little horses that goes beyond 

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:42.170
 a little bit since we are going to put the 

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:44.350
 scarf to maintain a little bit everything 

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:44.350
 it 

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:52.170
 you can tie the scarf on the 

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:52.770
 side it gives a side a little bit 

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:55.880
 peanuts 

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:55.880
 it's nice 

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:04.770
