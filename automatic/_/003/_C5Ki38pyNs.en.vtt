 the car is running on petrol 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:25.250
 because indicator marks the autonomy 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.250

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:51.180
 every second there is gpl because there is the 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:58.859

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.940
 to the LPG system 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:17.400
 the manual can not be set to 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:24.750
 fire but it is written and can be consulted 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:25.640
 by anyone that if the system does not 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.649
 it works 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.810
 there will be a flashing green light each 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:35.430
 second and there is a green light 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:38.579

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.000

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:48.080
 the manual says that to interrupt the 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:52.190

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:57.230
 switch button so the 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:59.180
 machine but pretty and it's written for the 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:00.980
 diagnosis and repair of any 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.620

 in the workshop they cannot solve the 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:37.010
 problem but they wrote that not 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:43.940
 they can solve the problem because 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:47.000
 there is no software then when 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:49.880
 undermines the gas until it comes 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.590
 created software that will succeed in 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:56.989
