actually the Hatti Wilf is a new skill

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.460 
actually the Hatti Wilf is a new skill
because<00:00:17.369> I<00:00:17.609> looked<00:00:18.029> in<00:00:18.180> my<00:00:18.359> skill<00:00:18.750> menu<00:00:19.140> and

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
because I looked in my skill menu and

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.590 
because I looked in my skill menu and
found<00:00:20.010> the<00:00:20.189> skill<00:00:20.460> right<00:00:20.699> under<00:00:21.090> the<00:00:21.210> farming

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
found the skill right under the farming

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.480 
found the skill right under the farming
skill<00:00:21.990> with<00:00:22.170> a<00:00:22.199> picture<00:00:22.500> of<00:00:22.680> the<00:00:22.949> Hatti<00:00:23.160> wolf

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
skill with a picture of the Hatti wolf

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.240 
skill with a picture of the Hatti wolf
and<00:00:23.820> I<00:00:24.210> was<00:00:24.390> only<00:00:24.539> level<00:00:24.960> one<00:00:25.109> in<00:00:25.470> it<00:00:25.590> so<00:00:26.099> it

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
and I was only level one in it so it

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.670 
and I was only level one in it so it
must<00:00:26.519> be<00:00:26.640> new<00:00:27.000> I<00:00:27.330> don't<00:00:28.109> think<00:00:28.199> that<00:00:28.500> Hattie

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
must be new I don't think that Hattie

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.769 
must be new I don't think that Hattie
wolf<00:00:28.980> should<00:00:29.250> be<00:00:29.369> a<00:00:29.400> skill<00:00:29.760> because<00:00:30.179> it<00:00:30.480> is<00:00:30.570> too

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
wolf should be a skill because it is too

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.950 
wolf should be a skill because it is too
much<00:00:30.960> like<00:00:31.289> a<00:00:31.320> mini<00:00:31.590> game<00:00:31.920> yeah<00:00:32.880> but<00:00:33.570> when<00:00:33.809> you

much like a mini game yeah but when you

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.930 
much like a mini game yeah but when you
think<00:00:34.260> about<00:00:34.380> it<00:00:34.559> isn't<00:00:35.340> rune<00:00:35.520> escape

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
think about it isn't rune escape

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.490 
think about it isn't rune escape

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:49.340 
actually just a minigame in the matrix I

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.069 
actually just a minigame in the matrix I
didn't<00:00:50.340> like<00:00:50.610> that<00:00:50.640> movie<00:00:51.090> because<00:00:51.870> I'm

though<00:01:10.200> what<00:01:10.770> if<00:01:10.920> all<00:01:11.070> of<00:01:11.130> existence<00:01:11.369> is<00:01:12.090> a

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
though what if all of existence is a

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.240 
though what if all of existence is a
loop<00:01:12.600> of<00:01:12.780> minigames<00:01:13.260> nested<00:01:13.830> inside<00:01:13.979> each

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
loop of minigames nested inside each

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.510 
loop of minigames nested inside each
other<00:01:14.780> for<00:01:15.780> example<00:01:16.350> what<00:01:16.799> appears<00:01:17.189> to<00:01:17.369> be<00:01:17.400> the

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
other for example what appears to be the

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.940 
other for example what appears to be the
most<00:01:17.759> important<00:01:18.479> minigame<00:01:19.049> which<00:01:19.619> is<00:01:19.799> the

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
most important minigame which is the

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.160 
most important minigame which is the
real-life<00:01:20.159> adventure<00:01:20.640> universe<00:01:21.479> might

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
real-life adventure universe might

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.929 
real-life adventure universe might
actually<00:01:22.439> be<00:01:22.830> a<00:01:22.860> minigame<00:01:23.400> in<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.729> least

trouble<00:01:27.479> brewing<00:01:27.990> yes

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
trouble brewing yes

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.899

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
existence that is actually a skill and

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.149 
existence that is actually a skill and
definitely<00:01:36.149> not<00:01:36.450> a<00:01:36.509> minigame<00:01:37.020> is<00:01:37.380> Dungey<00:01:37.890> an

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
definitely not a minigame is Dungey an

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.789 
definitely not a minigame is Dungey an
earring<00:01:38.490> in<00:01:39.330> before<00:01:39.780> this<00:01:39.930> video<00:01:40.140> gets<00:01:40.560> taken

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
earring in before this video gets taken

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.710

secret of the universe good fight I

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.270 
secret of the universe good fight I
think<00:01:45.750> that<00:01:45.960> Hattie<00:01:46.200> Wilf<00:01:46.530> is<00:01:46.740> actually<00:01:47.159> the

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
think that Hattie Wilf is actually the

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.760 
think that Hattie Wilf is actually the
hardest<00:01:47.430> mini<00:01:47.970> game<00:01:48.270> ever<00:01:48.509> made<00:01:48.600> because<00:01:49.289> when

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
hardest mini game ever made because when

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.320 
hardest mini game ever made because when
I<00:01:49.799> went<00:01:50.189> there<00:01:50.280> I<00:01:50.490> was<00:01:50.820> killed<00:01:51.360> in<00:01:51.539> like<00:01:52.280> 0.042

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:53.330 
I went there I was killed in like 0.042

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.669 
I went there I was killed in like 0.042
nanoseconds<00:01:54.330> and<00:01:54.420> I<00:01:54.600> didn't<00:01:54.960> know<00:01:55.200> how<00:01:55.229> to<00:01:55.439> get

00:01:55.669 --> 00:01:55.679
