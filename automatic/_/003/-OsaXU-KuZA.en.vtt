00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
a discussion going there now as far as

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.099 
a discussion going there now as far as
jailbreaking<00:03:50.970> is<00:03:51.359> concerned<00:03:51.690> the<00:03:51.810> firmware

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:52.109 
jailbreaking is concerned the firmware

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:54.349 
jailbreaking is concerned the firmware
will<00:03:52.260> almost<00:03:52.530> definitely<00:03:53.069> patch<00:03:53.639> the<00:03:53.880> taiji

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:54.359 
will almost definitely patch the taiji

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:56.420 
will almost definitely patch the taiji
untethered<00:03:55.049> jailbreak<00:03:55.319> though<00:03:56.040> there<00:03:56.250> are

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
untethered jailbreak though there are

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:59.059 
untethered jailbreak though there are
three<00:03:56.970> plausible<00:03:57.690> scenarios<00:03:58.350> so<00:03:58.680> let's<00:03:58.920> go

00:03:59.059 --> 00:03:59.069 
three plausible scenarios so let's go

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:01.550 
three plausible scenarios so let's go
into<00:03:59.100> the<00:03:59.370> first<00:03:59.639> and<00:03:59.880> most<00:04:00.180> likely<00:04:00.569> Apple

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
into the first and most likely Apple

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.440 
into the first and most likely Apple
will<00:04:01.709> probably<00:04:02.250> patch<00:04:02.519> the<00:04:02.790> vulnerabilities

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
will probably patch the vulnerabilities

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:07.460 
will probably patch the vulnerabilities
exploited<00:04:04.109> by<00:04:04.290> Taiji<00:04:04.950> in<00:04:05.160> iOS<00:04:05.700> 8.4<00:04:06.630> meaning

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
exploited by Taiji in iOS 8.4 meaning

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.770 
exploited by Taiji in iOS 8.4 meaning
that<00:04:07.680> iOS<00:04:08.040> 8<00:04:08.340> point<00:04:08.579> 4.1<00:04:09.120> will<00:04:09.299> not<00:04:09.600> be

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
that iOS 8 point 4.1 will not be

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.050 
that iOS 8 point 4.1 will not be
jailbreakable<00:04:10.350> without<00:04:10.799> an<00:04:10.980> update<00:04:11.459> to<00:04:11.760> taiji

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
jailbreakable without an update to taiji

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.660 
jailbreakable without an update to taiji
and<00:04:12.359> the<00:04:12.810> use<00:04:13.079> of<00:04:13.109> new<00:04:13.680> vulnerabilities

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.670 
and the use of new vulnerabilities

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:17.060 
and the use of new vulnerabilities
chances<00:04:15.660> are<00:04:15.780> good<00:04:15.959> though<00:04:16.139> that<00:04:16.410> Apple<00:04:16.799> won't

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
chances are good though that Apple won't

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.069 
chances are good though that Apple won't
close<00:04:17.459> all<00:04:17.760> of<00:04:17.820> the<00:04:18.269> vulnerabilities<00:04:19.049> that

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:19.079 
close all of the vulnerabilities that

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:22.430 
close all of the vulnerabilities that
Taiji<00:04:19.979> exploits<00:04:20.669> but<00:04:21.209> enough<00:04:21.570> to<00:04:21.870> make<00:04:22.019> it<00:04:22.049> so

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
Taiji exploits but enough to make it so

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.140 
Taiji exploits but enough to make it so
that<00:04:22.560> updating<00:04:23.190> the<00:04:23.280> utility<00:04:23.729> will<00:04:23.880> burn

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
that updating the utility will burn

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:25.520 
that updating the utility will burn
