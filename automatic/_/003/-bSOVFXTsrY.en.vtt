00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:06.970
 there are some gorillas lifting weights in 

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:10.210
 the gym then three gorillas come in 

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:13.750
 more and start running now we have 

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:16.860
 17 gorillas in the gym how many 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:19.110
 gorillas are lifting weights 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:21.390
 these are the gorillas that were in the 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:24.570
 gym from the beginning raising 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:33.450
 weights here I have this diagram how many 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:40.800
 square we have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:42.300
 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 squares that are 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.940
 the gorillas that are right now in the 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.430
 fitness center 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.680
 you have gorillas come in and they started 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.110
 running maybe these three are the gorillas 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.989
 that came in later so how much 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:01:01.159
 I knew before then all the paintings that 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:01:09.159
 do not fill in the answer is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 

00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:12.920
 8 9 10 11 12 13 and 14 so there were 14 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:14.960
 gorillas lifting fish in the gym 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.960
 here are the 3 that came in after 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:21.110
 they started running what gives us a 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:25.220
 total of 17 pictures our answer is 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:27.679
 14 there are other ways to solve this by 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:30.380
 example we have a number of gorillas that 

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:33.350
 they are already in the gym in 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:37.250
 our question plus three gorillas 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:40.670
 that come in after and now will be 17 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:43.690
 gorillas so we can say that something 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:47.560
 plus 3 gives us 17 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:49.390
 another way would be 17 minus three that 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.760
 they entered after 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:54.400
 will give us the number of gorillas that 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:56.800
 they were from the beginning that is equal 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:02:02.890
 to our question of any 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:06.580
 way is going to give us 14 17 minus 3 17 are 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:11.800
 a ten and seven units minus three 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:15.580
 units 7 minus 34 so 17 minus 3 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:17.950
 is 14 let's solve another problem like the 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:20.820
 that are in kant academy and it's 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:24.459
 good to know what they are asking 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:27.070
 buy a bag with 13 chocolates 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:29.860
 my sister ate several of them and 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:32.800
 I only had eight chocolates left 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.959
 chocolates ate my sister here is the 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.880
 amount of chocolates I still do not know 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:38.200
 how much did he eat what options 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.930
 can help solve the problem 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:43.870
 choose all that apply and here 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:48.670
 are the options then ana took the 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:51.550
 data had a bag with 13 chocolates 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:54.220
 my sister ate some I do not know how many 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:57.390
 ate this is my question and I 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:03:02.250
 there were eight chocolates 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:04.319
 s - something gives me 8 or we can see it as 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.840
 that we want to solve the question 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:10.170
 maybe some of you already found 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:13.260
 that 13 minus 5 of 8 and that the 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:18.090
 question is equal to 5 or we can 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:20.940
 say that 13 minus 8 is equal to our 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:24.120
 question we can also say that 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:26.700
 I stayed with eight chocolates my sister 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:29.160
 ate some here sumo my question 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.950
 which is what I have more what I ate 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:34.590
 my sister and I will have the amount of 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:37.890
 chocolates that I had at the beginning equal to 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:41.910
 13 in any way we will find that 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:44.040
 our question will be equal to 5 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:46.950
 they ask which of these options do you 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:49.950
 can help solve the problem if 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:52.880
 we know that the question is 5 and 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:57.750
 we know that 13 minus 5 gives us 8 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:59.100
 we will replace this with 5 13 minus 5 is 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.380
 equal to 8 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:03.720
 this is a true statement this 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:06.000
 second option if it serves me 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:08.280
 I started with three chocolates my sister 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.750
 ate five and I had eight 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:14.480
 chocolates 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:16.959
 and here 13 minus 8 equals 5 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:21.900
 here they do not have this option 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:21.900
 and now 85 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:29.860
 is equal to 13 this if we have it and if 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:32.080
 it is useful to us 8 is what I have 5 are the 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:35.620
 that my sister ate and 13 are the ones 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:38.380
 had the beginning 13 5 is equal to 18 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:40.570
 This does not help me, it does not have to do 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:42.699
 with my problem is not that my sister 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:45.340
 I got five chocolates and honey 

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:47.670
 will add to the 13 that I already had and I 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:50.430
 18 chocolates will be left 

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:54.890
 I only have eight chocolates because she 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:54.890
 he ate five of the thirteen he had
