Bokke<00:00:10.360> horn<00:00:10.570> seals<00:00:11.730> 384<00:00:12.900> 511<00:00:13.900> fours<00:00:14.309> the<00:00:15.309> first

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:15.580 
Bokke horn seals 384 511 fours the first

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:17.100 
Bokke horn seals 384 511 fours the first
thing<00:00:15.760> you<00:00:15.850> want<00:00:16.029> to<00:00:16.090> do<00:00:16.240> is<00:00:16.600> take<00:00:16.840> off<00:00:16.990> the

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:17.110 
thing you want to do is take off the

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:19.740 
thing you want to do is take off the
orange<00:00:17.380> seal<00:00:17.590> itself<00:00:18.119> so<00:00:19.119> the<00:00:19.240> bearings<00:00:19.599> are

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:19.750 
orange seal itself so the bearings are

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.070 
orange seal itself so the bearings are
exposed<00:00:21.090> which<00:00:22.090> makes<00:00:22.330> it<00:00:22.510> easier<00:00:22.810> to<00:00:22.840> clean

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:23.080 
exposed which makes it easier to clean

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.999 
exposed which makes it easier to clean
initially<00:00:23.710> and<00:00:23.950> to<00:00:24.340> clean<00:00:24.640> on<00:00:24.910> the<00:00:25.450> fly<00:00:26.009> the

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:27.009 
initially and to clean on the fly the

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:28.800 
initially and to clean on the fly the
bearings<00:00:27.369> also<00:00:27.520> seem<00:00:27.759> to<00:00:27.880> run<00:00:28.000> a<00:00:28.060> lot<00:00:28.270> faster

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:28.810 
bearings also seem to run a lot faster

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.830 
bearings also seem to run a lot faster
without<00:00:28.989> the<00:00:29.290> seals<00:00:29.590> on<00:00:30.570> first<00:00:31.570> thing<00:00:31.720> we're

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:31.840 
without the seals on first thing we're

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.690 
without the seals on first thing we're
gonna<00:00:31.930> do<00:00:32.169> is<00:00:32.200> take<00:00:32.739> off<00:00:32.890> the<00:00:33.010> corner<00:00:33.340> seals<00:00:33.520> on

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:33.700 
gonna do is take off the corner seals on

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:40.550 
gonna do is take off the corner seals on
the<00:00:33.790> bearings<00:00:34.210> I<00:00:37.440> usually<00:00:38.440> use<00:00:38.649> a<00:00:38.980> small<00:00:39.700> hook

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:40.560 
the bearings I usually use a small hook

00:00:40.560 --> 00:01:02.890 
the bearings I usually use a small hook
to<00:00:41.560> take<00:00:41.800> the<00:00:41.920> seals<00:00:42.190> off

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:02.900 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:04.810 

after<00:01:03.620> the<00:01:03.740> seals<00:01:03.980> are<00:01:04.160> off<00:01:04.280> they<00:01:04.489> are<00:01:04.610> ready

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:04.820 
after the seals are off they are ready

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.750 
after the seals are off they are ready
to<00:01:04.879> flush<00:01:06.850> bears<00:01:07.850> are<00:01:07.970> now<00:01:08.180> ready<00:01:08.450> to<00:01:08.510> flush<00:01:08.900> a

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:09.760 
to flush bears are now ready to flush a

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.730 
to flush bears are now ready to flush a
solution<00:01:10.760> of<00:01:10.880> 50/50<00:01:11.600> simple<00:01:11.990> green<00:01:12.200> and<00:01:12.440> water

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
solution of 50/50 simple green and water

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:20.440 
solution of 50/50 simple green and water
for<00:01:13.250> about<00:01:13.340> 30<00:01:13.460> minutes<00:01:18.820> after<00:01:19.820> the<00:01:20.119> bearings

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
for about 30 minutes after the bearings

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.000 
for about 30 minutes after the bearings
have<00:01:20.540> flushed<00:01:20.840> this<00:01:21.260> is<00:01:21.380> a<00:01:21.410> good<00:01:21.590> idea<00:01:21.680> to

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.010 
have flushed this is a good idea to

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:24.460 
have flushed this is a good idea to
rinse<00:01:22.190> them<00:01:22.430> in<00:01:22.640> a<00:01:22.940> hundred<00:01:23.420> percent<00:01:23.570> water<00:01:24.050> to

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:24.470 
rinse them in a hundred percent water to

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:41.459 
rinse them in a hundred percent water to
get<00:01:24.590> rid<00:01:24.710> of<00:01:24.800> any<00:01:25.010> of<00:01:25.100> the<00:01:25.250> residue

00:01:41.459 --> 00:01:41.469 

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:43.870 

after<00:01:42.469> the<00:01:42.560> bearings<00:01:42.890> are<00:01:43.039> completely<00:01:43.609> dried

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
after the bearings are completely dried

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.120 
after the bearings are completely dried
and<00:01:44.060> flushed<00:01:44.329> the<00:01:44.840> next<00:01:45.049> step<00:01:45.200> to<00:01:45.320> do<00:01:45.500> is<00:01:45.740> to

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 
and flushed the next step to do is to

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.160 
and flushed the next step to do is to
take<00:01:46.340> the<00:01:46.520> old<00:01:46.549> bearings<00:01:47.000> out<00:01:47.179> and<00:01:47.570> I'll<00:01:47.990> show

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
take the old bearings out and I'll show

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.429 
take the old bearings out and I'll show
you<00:01:48.200> how<00:01:48.439> to<00:01:48.469> do<00:01:48.649> this<00:01:48.770> right<00:01:49.039> now<00:01:50.200> usually<00:01:51.200> I

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
once the bearing retainer is removed you

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:35.610 
once the bearing retainer is removed you
should<00:02:29.840> be<00:02:30.140> able<00:02:30.200> to<00:02:30.350> pop<00:02:30.800> the<00:02:31.010> bearing<00:02:31.280> out

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.870 

most<00:02:36.620> of<00:02:36.740> the<00:02:36.800> time<00:02:36.950> the<00:02:37.100> bearing<00:02:37.370> says<00:02:37.580> fall

most of the time the bearing says fall

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.700 
most of the time the bearing says fall
out<00:02:38.830> once<00:02:39.830> that<00:02:39.980> bearing<00:02:40.370> is<00:02:40.490> removed<00:02:40.850> you<00:02:41.710> can

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:42.710 
out once that bearing is removed you can

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:50.770 
out once that bearing is removed you can
insert<00:02:43.160> the<00:02:43.340> new<00:02:43.520> bearing<00:02:47.050> and<00:02:48.050> put<00:02:49.010> back<00:02:49.780> the

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 
the spool which is a little tricky to do

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:12.310 
the spool which is a little tricky to do
if<00:03:01.850> you<00:03:02.030> do<00:03:02.120> not<00:03:02.150> have<00:03:02.450> the<00:03:02.570> right<00:03:02.720> tool<00:03:11.320> the

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:12.320 
if you do not have the right tool the

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.560 
if you do not have the right tool the
bearing<00:03:12.620> is<00:03:12.740> seated<00:03:13.040> on<00:03:13.160> the<00:03:13.250> spool<00:03:13.550> pin<00:03:13.580> which

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:14.570 
bearing is seated on the spool pin which

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:17.470 
bearing is seated on the spool pin which
is<00:03:14.720> held<00:03:14.959> in<00:03:15.050> by<00:03:15.230> a<00:03:15.260> pin<00:03:15.620> and<00:03:16.520> you<00:03:16.910> have<00:03:17.090> to<00:03:17.209> use

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
is held in by a pin and you have to use

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.490 
is held in by a pin and you have to use
a<00:03:19.360> specific<00:03:20.360> pair<00:03:20.570> of<00:03:20.720> pliers<00:03:20.990> that<00:03:21.170> has<00:03:21.470> a

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
a specific pair of pliers that has a

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.190 
a specific pair of pliers that has a
hole<00:03:21.800> on<00:03:21.830> one<00:03:22.010> side<00:03:22.430> and<00:03:22.820> flat<00:03:23.780> on<00:03:24.050> the<00:03:24.170> other

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
hole on one side and flat on the other

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:32.140 
hole on one side and flat on the other
so<00:03:25.160> you<00:03:25.250> can<00:03:25.400> push<00:03:25.640> the<00:03:26.270> spool<00:03:26.570> pin<00:03:26.600> out<00:03:31.150> once

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
so you can push the spool pin out once

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.090 
so you can push the spool pin out once
the<00:03:32.269> spool<00:03:32.510> pin<00:03:32.540> pops<00:03:33.110> then<00:03:33.680> you<00:03:34.519> can<00:03:34.700> take<00:03:34.850> a

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.100 
the spool pin pops then you can take a

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:41.970 
the spool pin pops then you can take a
screwdriver<00:03:37.100> to<00:03:38.090> pop<00:03:38.450> the<00:03:38.630> spool<00:03:39.320> pin<00:03:39.350> out

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:41.980 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:44.680 

once<00:03:42.980> the<00:03:43.160> pin<00:03:43.370> is<00:03:43.519> removed<00:03:43.550> you<00:03:44.360> should<00:03:44.390> be

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690
