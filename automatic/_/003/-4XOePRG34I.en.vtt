00:00:01.189 --> 00:00:04.899
 hi hello how are you 

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:09.230
 today I'm going to make another video tutorial 

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:12.280
 on how to download games for feet 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:14.470
 for the csv format 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:17.890
 good 

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:20.610
 today's game will be god of war ghost of 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:20.610
 sparta 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:26.570
 something two rooms for parties 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:29.410
 when the links leave they will leave 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:29.410
 description of the video 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.300
 will take them to a folder in the middle 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.300
 outside 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:48.010
 once you are having the folder you will see the 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.010
 part of the game 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:59.929
 meanwhile they are 96 megabytes 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:02.780
 and the last part is the twelfth 4MB 

00:00:59.929 --> 00:01:05.299
 I divided it into so many 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:07.369
 because sometimes it happens to me that I'm 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:11.270
 downloading a file but you see doing 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:13.159
 200 megs and I have to leave fast 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.590
 I have to somewhere and I have to turn off 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:18.800
 the computer and I can not leave it 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:22.670
 on I have that is that although 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:25.399
 cancel the download then yes childbirth 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.979
 the game if I divide it into many parts 

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:31.130
 of little black cubes so download more 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:33.560
 fast the parties will no longer have to 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:36.820
 last a long time by downloading one and now 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.740
 this will not happen to you that I mentioned before 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.970
 good since they have every part 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:45.550
 downloaded 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.550
 brother where they have saved the parts 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:54.990
 in case I have a folder where I have 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.990
 the folders of all the games 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:58.690
 these 12 parts are left 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:04.840
 all they have to do is 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:07.330
 select all give right click of 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:11.310
 extract here or extract files where 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.310
 want where you extract from the file 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:16.409
 then he will ask me where I am going to 

00:02:12.969 --> 00:02:16.409
 save what I'm going to put the desktop 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.980
 This will leave this dialog 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:27.080
 where waiting for a process 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.880
 the extraction this means that it 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.069
 is uniting all the parts in one 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.489
 file that will finally be the game 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:33.489
 final 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:40.880
 I'll use in whatever it ends 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:43.090
 about the video so it does not get longer 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.090
 so much 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.220
 once the process of 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.760
 extraction 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:53.750
 as you will see is that give this file 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.750
 but they are files that 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:59.849
 what weighs 1.66 gb 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:06.710
 to spend a game did to do this 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:10.610
 there is a process but at this time no 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:12.650
 I have the programs to do it where 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:14.550
 next videotutorial I will show you how 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:17.040
 pass it to cc.oo 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:19.120
 this means how to make the game 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:22.300
 ps - but 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.300
 practically the same 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:27.069
 well once we have this game there 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.400
 there must be another windar file but 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:31.620
 good the image the truth file 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:36.540
 but you do not have to do anything else 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:36.540
 they simply copy the copy 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:43.810
 they stick it in the folder and that's upyd 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:47.260
 this carpizo must be 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:48.700
 in the root it must be created in the 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:52.590
 root 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.590
 of your memory 10 pine 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:58.870
 this has been all for the moment as 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:01.480
 I said soon in exit how 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:04.379
 make them how to convert the games made 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.379
 a cc.oo 

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:09.770
 the video will leave all the links 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:12.560
 I will also leave 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:16.000

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:19.000
