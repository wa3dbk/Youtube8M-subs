essence things so they were very

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.360 
essence things so they were very

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.060 
remembered that that i did and everyone
was<00:01:33.659> just<00:01:33.840> saying<00:01:34.020> how<00:01:34.110> it<00:01:34.530> gives<00:01:34.710> you<00:01:34.920> the

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
was just saying how it gives you the

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.550 
was just saying how it gives you the
most<00:01:35.250> pretty<00:01:35.700> finish<00:01:36.150> on<00:01:36.360> your<00:01:36.540> face<00:01:36.810> and<00:01:37.079> I

most pretty finish on your face and I

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.890 
most pretty finish on your face and I

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:38.900 
technically didn't need another

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.649 
technically didn't need another
foundation<00:01:39.900> brush<00:01:40.290> but<00:01:40.710> I<00:01:41.180> just<00:01:42.180> thought<00:01:42.329> that

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
foundation brush but I just thought that

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.569 
foundation brush but I just thought that
this<00:01:42.990> is<00:01:43.170> not<00:01:43.320> amazing<00:01:43.680> i<00:01:43.979> want<00:01:44.159> to<00:01:44.250> use<00:01:44.369> it

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
this is not amazing i want to use it

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.580 
this is not amazing i want to use it
because<00:01:44.700> my<00:01:45.180> brush<00:01:45.420> right<00:01:45.630> now<00:01:45.810> isn't<00:01:46.079> giving

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
because my brush right now isn't giving

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.740 
because my brush right now isn't giving
me<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:46.950> most<00:01:47.130> covers<00:01:47.640> i<00:01:47.880> think<00:01:48.240> it<00:01:48.390> should<00:01:48.720> be

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
me the most covers i think it should be

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.050 
me the most covers i think it should be
giving<00:01:49.380> me<00:01:49.530> i<00:01:49.740> still<00:01:50.369> love<00:01:50.670> it<00:01:50.700> i<00:01:50.880> still

definitely recommend it to you guys but

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.460 
definitely recommend it to you guys but
if<00:01:53.759> this<00:01:53.939> gives<00:01:54.299> me<00:01:54.390> better<00:01:54.689> coverage<00:01:55.290> which

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
if this gives me better coverage which

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.649 
if this gives me better coverage which
is<00:01:55.590> what<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:55.829> reviews<00:01:56.219> were<00:01:56.250> saying<00:01:56.700> then<00:01:57.509> I'm

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
is what the reviews were saying then I'm

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.510

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
for sure going to keep on to this

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.539 
for sure going to keep on to this
because<00:02:00.170> when<00:02:01.170> you<00:02:01.320> feel<00:02:01.590> it<00:02:01.740> it's<00:02:01.920> super<00:02:02.340> soft

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
because when you feel it it's super soft

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:09.949 
this I kind of made it a goal for myself
with<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:08.700> twenty<00:02:08.970> percent<00:02:09.179> off<00:02:09.300> coupons<00:02:09.720> that

a tu fais la creme lipstick every time
they<00:02:13.940> have<00:02:14.180> it<00:02:14.390> that<00:02:14.870> probably<00:02:15.200> is<00:02:15.349> a<00:02:15.410> little

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
they have it that probably is a little

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.190 
they have it that probably is a little
unrealistic<00:02:16.190> because<00:02:16.629> to<00:02:17.629> a<00:02:17.660> certain<00:02:18.019> point

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
unrealistic because to a certain point

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.960 
unrealistic because to a certain point
I'm<00:02:18.470> not<00:02:18.530> going<00:02:18.920> to<00:02:18.980> have<00:02:19.099> any<00:02:19.310> more<00:02:19.430> shades<00:02:19.730> to

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
I'm not going to have any more shades to

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.100 
I'm not going to have any more shades to
get<00:02:20.120> and<00:02:20.300> there<00:02:20.390> are<00:02:20.450> certain<00:02:20.690> shades<00:02:20.870> that<00:02:20.989> I

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
get and there are certain shades that I

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:22.869 
get and there are certain shades that I
don't<00:02:21.410> want<00:02:21.680> and<00:02:21.890> obviously<00:02:22.280> I<00:02:22.370> will<00:02:22.519> not<00:02:22.640> get

00:02:22.869 --> 00:02:22.879 
don't want and obviously I will not get

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:25.360 
don't want and obviously I will not get
those<00:02:23.090> but<00:02:23.420> so<00:02:23.720> far<00:02:23.959> I<00:02:24.260> think<00:02:24.410> this<00:02:24.739> is<00:02:24.890> like<00:02:25.040> my

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
those but so far I think this is like my

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.990 
those but so far I think this is like my
5th<00:02:25.790> or<00:02:26.180> 6th<00:02:26.750> one<00:02:26.930> and<00:02:27.319> they<00:02:27.830> are<00:02:28.160> my<00:02:28.670> favorite

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000
