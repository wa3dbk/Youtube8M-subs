00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:20.050 
leaf surface and the height you see
there's<00:00:17.710> probably<00:00:18.710> two<00:00:19.310> to<00:00:19.640> two-and-a-half

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:20.060

feet<00:00:20.240> high<00:00:20.750> and<00:00:22.480> they<00:00:23.480> get<00:00:23.810> three<00:00:24.560> to<00:00:25.009> five

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:25.339 
feet high and they get three to five

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:27.489 
feet high and they get three to five
feet<00:00:25.669> wide<00:00:25.999> a<00:00:26.390> lot<00:00:26.779> of<00:00:26.900> people<00:00:27.169> don't<00:00:27.410> think

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:27.499 
feet wide a lot of people don't think

00:00:27.499 --> 00:00:29.409 
feet wide a lot of people don't think
they<00:00:27.800> get<00:00:27.949> this<00:00:28.160> wide<00:00:28.519> but<00:00:28.820> I've<00:00:28.970> consistently

00:00:29.409 --> 00:00:29.419 
they get this wide but I've consistently

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:31.920 
they get this wide but I've consistently
seen<00:00:30.050> them<00:00:30.259> spread<00:00:30.710> out<00:00:30.859> over<00:00:30.890> time<00:00:31.460> and

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:31.930 
seen them spread out over time and

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:34.660 
seen them spread out over time and
although<00:00:32.930> you're<00:00:33.379> looking<00:00:33.770> at<00:00:33.920> a<00:00:33.949> grouping

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:34.670 
although you're looking at a grouping

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.650 
although you're looking at a grouping
here<00:00:35.030> that's<00:00:37.000> you<00:00:38.000> know<00:00:38.120> that<00:00:38.359> they<00:00:38.600> were

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:38.660 
here that's you know that they were

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:40.689 
here that's you know that they were
probably<00:00:38.960> planted<00:00:39.710> two<00:00:39.920> and<00:00:40.070> a<00:00:40.129> half<00:00:40.280> to<00:00:40.460> three

00:00:40.689 --> 00:00:40.699 
probably planted two and a half to three

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:42.880 
probably planted two and a half to three
feet<00:00:40.730> apart<00:00:41.059> really<00:00:41.840> if<00:00:42.020> you're<00:00:42.500> doing<00:00:42.710> a

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:42.890 
feet apart really if you're doing a

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:44.799 
feet apart really if you're doing a
grouping<00:00:43.370> I<00:00:43.489> think<00:00:43.730> that's<00:00:43.910> a<00:00:44.059> good<00:00:44.239> spacing

00:00:44.799 --> 00:00:44.809 
grouping I think that's a good spacing

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:46.779 
grouping I think that's a good spacing
by<00:00:44.989> the<00:00:45.050> way<00:00:45.350> but<00:00:45.620> this<00:00:45.769> one<00:00:46.010> right<00:00:46.190> here<00:00:46.640> is

00:00:46.779 --> 00:00:46.789 
by the way but this one right here is

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:48.849 
by the way but this one right here is
probably<00:00:47.300> four<00:00:47.809> to<00:00:48.050> four<00:00:48.289> and<00:00:48.379> a<00:00:48.440> half<00:00:48.620> feet

00:00:48.849 --> 00:00:48.859 
probably four to four and a half feet

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:52.360 
probably four to four and a half feet
wide<00:00:49.190> so<00:00:50.090> that's<00:00:50.930> the<00:00:51.199> size<00:00:51.469> hardiness

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.370 
wide so that's the size hardiness

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.729 
wide so that's the size hardiness
they're<00:00:52.670> two<00:00:52.850> hardy<00:00:53.239> down<00:00:53.449> to<00:00:53.690> around<00:00:53.780> 15<00:00:54.469> to

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:54.739 
they're two hardy down to around 15 to

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:58.389 
they're two hardy down to around 15 to
20<00:00:55.160> degrees<00:00:55.309> Fahrenheit<00:00:55.969> and<00:00:56.679> also<00:00:57.679> a<00:00:58.039> lot<00:00:58.370> of

00:00:58.389 --> 00:00:58.399 
20 degrees Fahrenheit and also a lot of

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:00.490 
20 degrees Fahrenheit and also a lot of
the<00:00:58.609> pittosporum<00:00:58.940> family<00:00:59.780> including<00:01:00.320> this

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:00.500 
the pittosporum family including this

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.369 
the pittosporum family including this
one<00:01:00.739> are<00:01:00.920> fairly<00:01:01.460> reliable<00:01:02.420> in<00:01:02.600> terms<00:01:02.870> of<00:01:03.109> deer

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:03.379 
one are fairly reliable in terms of deer

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:05.320 
one are fairly reliable in terms of deer
resistance<00:01:04.040> so<00:01:04.310> I'll<00:01:04.460> just<00:01:04.670> throw<00:01:04.970> that<00:01:05.120> in

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.330 
resistance so I'll just throw that in

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.480 
resistance so I'll just throw that in
there<00:01:05.510> also<00:01:05.960> once<00:01:06.560> established<00:01:06.800> they're

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490 
there also once established they're

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.250 
there also once established they're
quite<00:01:07.700> drought<00:01:08.030> resistant<00:01:08.660> that<00:01:08.900> pittosporum

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:09.260 
quite drought resistant that pittosporum

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.920 
quite drought resistant that pittosporum
to<00:01:09.770> byra<00:01:09.950> family<00:01:10.550> is<00:01:10.610> very<00:01:10.940> drought<00:01:11.300> resistant

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930 
to byra family is very drought resistant

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.290 
to byra family is very drought resistant
I<00:01:12.080> think<00:01:12.620> it<00:01:12.740> has<00:01:12.920> a<00:01:12.950> lot<00:01:13.190> to<00:01:13.400> do<00:01:13.550> with<00:01:13.670> the<00:01:13.850> waxy

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:14.300 
I think it has a lot to do with the waxy

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.930 
I think it has a lot to do with the waxy
leaf<00:01:14.570> so<00:01:15.560> what<00:01:15.830> I<00:01:15.860> like<00:01:16.070> about<00:01:16.130> this<00:01:16.670> as<00:01:16.910> a

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:16.940 
leaf so what I like about this as a

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.480 
leaf so what I like about this as a
design<00:01:17.450> element<00:01:17.690> is<00:01:18.200> obviously<00:01:18.830> the<00:01:19.100> foliage

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
design element is obviously the foliage

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.850 
design element is obviously the foliage
color<00:01:19.880> you<00:01:20.450> see<00:01:20.720> there<00:01:21.020> that<00:01:21.230> it's<00:01:21.410> kind<00:01:21.680> of<00:01:21.740> a

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
color you see there that it's kind of a

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.060 
color you see there that it's kind of a
gray<00:01:22.160> green<00:01:22.490> leaf<00:01:22.880> and<00:01:23.180> with<00:01:23.960> a<00:01:23.990> creamy<00:01:24.440> margin

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 
gray green leaf and with a creamy margin

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.960 
gray green leaf and with a creamy margin
and<00:01:25.480> a<00:01:26.480> very<00:01:27.110> good<00:01:27.470> clean<00:01:27.920> looking<00:01:28.310> plant<00:01:28.700> this

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:28.970 
and a very good clean looking plant this

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.660 
and a very good clean looking plant this
planting<00:01:29.570> here<00:01:29.780> is<00:01:29.900> about<00:01:30.170> 15<00:01:30.770> years<00:01:31.070> old<00:01:31.370> and

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
planting here is about 15 years old and

planting here is about 15 years old and
has<00:01:31.880> very<00:01:32.420> little<00:01:32.810> that<00:01:32.990> the<00:01:33.230> maintenance

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
has very little that the maintenance

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.040 
has very little that the maintenance
person<00:01:34.220> has<00:01:34.400> to<00:01:34.610> do<00:01:34.790> to<00:01:35.000> it<00:01:35.150> that's<00:01:35.720> the<00:01:35.930> other

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:36.050 
person has to do to it that's the other

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:38.170 
person has to do to it that's the other
thing<00:01:36.410> is<00:01:36.590> it<00:01:36.770> Falls<00:01:37.040> kind<00:01:37.370> of<00:01:37.550> in<00:01:37.670> my<00:01:37.820> sweet

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 
thing is it Falls kind of in my sweet

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.200 
thing is it Falls kind of in my sweet
spot<00:01:38.360> for<00:01:38.740> design<00:01:39.740> which<00:01:40.040> is<00:01:40.310> plants<00:01:41.000> between

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210 
spot for design which is plants between

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:45.430 
spot for design which is plants between
12<00:01:42.110> and<00:01:42.470> 12<00:01:43.310> inches<00:01:43.670> and<00:01:43.910> 36<00:01:44.450> inches<00:01:44.780> high<00:01:45.050> and

12 and 12 inches and 36 inches high and
then<00:01:46.070> having<00:01:46.390> little<00:01:47.390> or<00:01:47.540> no<00:01:47.600> maintenance

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
then having little or no maintenance

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.320 
then having little or no maintenance
because<00:01:48.680> the<00:01:48.860> flowers<00:01:49.340> aren't<00:01:50.000> really

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:50.330 
because the flowers aren't really

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.290 
because the flowers aren't really
significant<00:01:51.080> on<00:01:51.200> this<00:01:51.410> plant<00:01:52.030> there's<00:01:53.030> not<00:01:53.270> a

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
a lot and I think that's about what I

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.850 
a lot and I think that's about what I
can<00:02:58.790> tell<00:02:59.060> you<00:02:59.270> so<00:02:59.570> low<00:03:00.110> water<00:03:00.470> once

water but doesn't have to have it and

water but doesn't have to have it and
again<00:03:07.040> using<00:03:07.520> the<00:03:07.670> foliage<00:03:08.090> as<00:03:08.330> the<00:03:09.020> interest

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
again using the foliage as the interest

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.190 
again using the foliage as the interest
I<00:03:09.740> like<00:03:10.310> to<00:03:10.520> use<00:03:10.730> a<00:03:10.760> smaller<00:03:11.330> group<00:03:11.750> than<00:03:12.020> this

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
I like to use a smaller group than this

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.650 
I like to use a smaller group than this
one<00:03:12.470> here<00:03:12.500> typically<00:03:13.310> because<00:03:13.820> again<00:03:14.180> I<00:03:14.390> like

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
one here typically because again I like

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.050 
one here typically because again I like
lighter<00:03:14.990> foliage<00:03:15.560> is<00:03:15.740> to<00:03:15.920> be<00:03:16.070> contrasted<00:03:16.370> by

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
lighter foliage is to be contrasted by

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:18.760 
lighter foliage is to be contrasted by
something<00:03:17.360> darker<00:03:17.960> I<00:03:17.990> think<00:03:18.290> that's<00:03:18.470> a<00:03:18.590> little

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:18.770 
something darker I think that's a little

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:19.570 
something darker I think that's a little
more<00:03:18.950> interesting

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.580 
more interesting

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:22.990 
more interesting
