00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
know I just saw a lot of activity there

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.469 
know I just saw a lot of activity there
I<00:01:34.170> wanted<00:01:34.729> you<00:01:35.729> know<00:01:35.820> I'd<00:01:35.939> like<00:01:36.150> to<00:01:36.329> go

I wanted you know I'd like to go
someplace<00:01:36.720> else<00:01:37.020> but<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.439> thing<00:01:37.650> that<00:01:37.680> I

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
someplace else but the thing that I

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.039 
someplace else but the thing that I
really<00:01:38.400> liked<00:01:38.729> about<00:01:38.850> that<00:01:39.180> area<00:01:39.360> is<00:01:39.600> the

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
really liked about that area is the

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.870 
really liked about that area is the
clarity<00:01:40.500> of<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.619> water<00:01:40.710> a<00:01:41.159> lot<00:01:41.579> of<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.759> other

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
clarity of the water a lot of the other

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.210 
clarity of the water a lot of the other
areas<00:01:42.240> i<00:01:42.329> went<00:01:42.540> to<00:01:42.720> water<00:01:43.439> was<00:01:43.619> really<00:01:43.799> dirty

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
areas i went to water was really dirty

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.609 
areas i went to water was really dirty
and<00:01:44.399> buddied<00:01:44.790> up<00:01:44.810> here<00:01:45.810> on<00:01:45.960> this<00:01:46.110> lake<00:01:46.320> if<00:01:46.500> you

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
and buddied up here on this lake if you

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.590 
and buddied up here on this lake if you
got<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:46.920> wind<00:01:47.100> pushing<00:01:47.460> into<00:01:47.610> an<00:01:47.820> area<00:01:48.000> it

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
got the wind pushing into an area it

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.230 
got the wind pushing into an area it
does<00:01:48.869> stir<00:01:49.110> it<00:01:49.259> up<00:01:49.320> quite<00:01:49.920> a<00:01:49.979> bit<00:01:50.220> and<00:01:50.430> this

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
does stir it up quite a bit and this

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.149 
does stir it up quite a bit and this
area<00:01:51.600> obviously<00:01:51.810> has<00:01:52.229> been<00:01:52.409> protected<00:01:52.950> for<00:01:52.979> a

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
area obviously has been protected for a

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.920 
area obviously has been protected for a
few<00:01:53.399> days<00:01:53.549> from<00:01:53.880> from<00:01:54.240> whatever<00:01:54.420> wind<00:01:54.750> we've

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
few days from from whatever wind we've

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.899 
few days from from whatever wind we've
had<00:01:55.170> because<00:01:55.770> it<00:01:55.920> was<00:01:56.070> quite<00:01:56.310> a<00:01:56.430> bit<00:01:56.640> clearer

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
had because it was quite a bit clearer

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.999 
had because it was quite a bit clearer
than<00:01:57.119> any<00:01:57.329> place<00:01:57.570> else<00:01:57.719> that<00:01:58.020> that<00:01:58.259> I<00:01:58.290> saw<00:01:58.649> and

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
than any place else that that I saw and

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.740 
than any place else that that I saw and
again<00:01:59.549> there<00:01:59.729> was<00:01:59.820> a<00:01:59.880> presence<00:02:00.060> of<00:02:00.390> a<00:02:00.450> lot<00:02:00.600> of

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
again there was a presence of a lot of

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.690 
again there was a presence of a lot of
shed<00:02:00.930> you<00:02:01.799> could<00:02:01.979> see<00:02:02.130> that<00:02:02.310> when<00:02:02.520> you<00:02:02.610> were

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
shed you could see that when you were

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.429 
shed you could see that when you were
watching<00:02:03.060> me<00:02:03.090> then<00:02:03.299> and<00:02:03.450> the<00:02:03.600> mole<00:02:03.840> cold<00:02:04.229> was

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
watching me then and the mole cold was

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.560 
watching me then and the mole cold was
just<00:02:04.649> shed<00:02:05.040> on<00:02:05.250> the<00:02:05.399> top<00:02:05.579> and<00:02:05.820> that's<00:02:06.240> what<00:02:06.479> you

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
just shed on the top and that's what you

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:07.910 
just shed on the top and that's what you
got<00:02:06.689> to<00:02:06.719> find<00:02:06.930> this<00:02:07.110> time<00:02:07.320> of<00:02:07.469> year<00:02:07.500> is<00:02:07.649> you<00:02:07.770> got

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
got to find this time of year is you got

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.710 
got to find this time of year is you got
it<00:02:08.039> if<00:02:08.129> you<00:02:08.250> find<00:02:08.489> the<00:02:08.610> bait<00:02:08.789> and<00:02:09.030> you<00:02:09.509> find

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
it if you find the bait and you find

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.540 
it if you find the bait and you find
good<00:02:09.929> habitat<00:02:10.379> the<00:02:10.800> bass<00:02:11.039> are<00:02:11.250> going<00:02:11.370> to<00:02:11.430> be

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
good habitat the bass are going to be

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.670 
good habitat the bass are going to be
close<00:02:11.760> by<00:02:12.030> and<00:02:12.300> that's<00:02:12.750> what<00:02:12.930> I<00:02:12.959> did<00:02:13.050> is<00:02:13.379> I

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
close by and that's what I did is I

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.949 
close by and that's what I did is I
an<00:02:13.799> area<00:02:14.010> that<00:02:14.069> had<00:02:14.280> a<00:02:14.310> lot<00:02:14.459> of<00:02:14.519> bait<00:02:14.760> and<00:02:15.000> just

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
an area that had a lot of bait and just

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:17.569 
an area that had a lot of bait and just
had<00:02:16.079> to<00:02:16.140> work<00:02:16.319> hard<00:02:16.530> to<00:02:16.590> find<00:02:16.829> the<00:02:16.920> bass<00:02:17.099> what

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:17.579 
had to work hard to find the bass what

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:19.270 
had to work hard to find the bass what
was<00:02:17.700> your<00:02:17.849> top<00:02:18.030> producer<00:02:18.510> for<00:02:18.689> the<00:02:18.810> day<00:02:18.930> I

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
was your top producer for the day I

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.220 
was your top producer for the day I
probably<00:02:20.280> caught<00:02:20.459> the<00:02:20.609> most<00:02:20.819> fish<00:02:20.969> on<00:02:21.480> a<00:02:21.540> on<00:02:22.170> a

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
probably caught the most fish on a on a

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.000 
probably caught the most fish on a on a
kbd<00:02:22.650> one<00:02:22.920> point<00:02:23.189> oh<00:02:23.310> but<00:02:23.640> a<00:02:23.670> KVD<00:02:24.359> 1.5<00:02:25.049> was<00:02:25.739> my

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
kbd one point oh but a KVD 1.5 was my

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.979 
kbd one point oh but a KVD 1.5 was my
best<00:02:26.219> bait<00:02:26.549> just<00:02:26.969> because<00:02:27.299> you<00:02:27.689> know<00:02:27.780> it's

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
best bait just because you know it's

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:29.899 
best bait just because you know it's
just<00:02:28.140> that<00:02:28.379> it's<00:02:28.650> a<00:02:28.950> little<00:02:29.189> heavier<00:02:29.459> and<00:02:29.730> it's

00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:29.909 
just that it's a little heavier and it's

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:32.030 
just that it's a little heavier and it's
just<00:02:30.090> a<00:02:30.180> lot<00:02:30.389> easier<00:02:30.420> to<00:02:30.900> cast<00:02:31.139> with<00:02:31.560> accuracy

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
just a lot easier to cast with accuracy

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.800 
just a lot easier to cast with accuracy
around<00:02:32.670> those<00:02:32.909> docs<00:02:33.209> you<00:02:33.420> know<00:02:33.480> I'm<00:02:33.569> trying<00:02:33.719> to
