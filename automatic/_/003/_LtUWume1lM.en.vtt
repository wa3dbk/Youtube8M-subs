00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:18.840
 hello friends for those who are bad 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:22.439
 remembers the events of 2003 tl 2005 I will say 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:25.410
 that then around brand 2 was going wild 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.949
 the hype in march 5 should have come out 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.630
 the final third episode of the saga and 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:33.120
 the run-up to this other than a different merch 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.280
 books and stuff like that 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.940
 created a two-dimensional animated series of clone wars 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.780
 for the authorship of our compatriot 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.180
 Gennady Tartakovsky 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.370
 his first half was in many ways 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.090
 devoted clone and from that pretty 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.550
 silent 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.070
 further plot introduced the Jedi and 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.879
 new adversary for them it was 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.280
 General Grievous 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.860
 these two points were the most 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.680
 discussed clones and army general 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.260
 droid events of the show ended 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.719
 right before the beginning of the third episode and 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.790
 to stir up expectations even more 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.100
 fans were released playing republic 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.650
 the team she was based on exactly the same 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.439
 the most moments were clones and droids 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.210
 grivus by the way at the end there is but his 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.299
 show little to keep intrigue 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.939
 before the film, even then many disliked 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:23.880
 project due to the lack of light swords and 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.920
 quite superficial plot he 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.430
 consisted of a company divided into three 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.170
 stage it was a battle on jonosis 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:33.990
 intelligence on the Republican cruiser 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.450
 and protection kashyika all pretty quickly 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.280
 passed but no less easily in 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.520
 I want to ask such people as a result 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:44.280
 But what is the actual depth of the plot ? 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.439
 waited from the game about commandos last 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.590
 represented the elite squad delta 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.430
 commander of which was the player roster 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.700
 this warehouse 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:57.000
 included 4 attack aircraft delta 38 cons 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.920
 on this and themselves nicknamed boss delta 40 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.479
 cracker specialist hacking 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:06.000
 delta 077 sniper and delta 62 scorch 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.890
 being a demolition man is well known 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.119
 or maybe not everyone knows clones 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.610
 created perfect 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.390
 for emotional about those who have them 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.310
 appeared 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.860
 I mean, emotions were sent to 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.690
 called retraining however 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.000
 a similar case appeared everywhere well 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.610
 albeit not massively but they took place 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.640
 to be and this is reflected in the game itself 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:29.159
 each member of the squad has his own 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.470
 the unique character of their grain is an example 

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:34.230
 behaving like such an exemplary soldier 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.150
 strictly follows all our orders and 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.879
 only occasionally allows herself to joke 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:41.340
 counterbalance his speed constantly mocks 

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:42.329
 some fun and in every way get 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.930
 the pleasure of war 

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:48.540
 and sullen and sowing low bass broadcasts about 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.769
 what ways the massacre of his enemies 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.379
 like most 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:55.170
 the finale of the game is our colorful compass 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:57.150
 well becomes a real family and when 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.019
 the last mission we lose it in 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.329
 explosion time 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:02.849
 but even this feeling of emptiness appears 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:04.590
 which is further fueled when 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:07.470
 we are ordered to leave the planet and 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:10.709
 perform the task that moment you sit and 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:12.720
 just like clones just questioning the noise 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:15.060
 waters that appear on the hologram 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.549
 that but he's our brother we owe him 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.380
 save and while he answers as a whole as always 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:22.650
 style can should 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:24.690
 friends to fight on we need 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:28.639
 here is a hint of a sequel 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.639
 return seva in the game all the same was 

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:45.989
 otherwise the gameplay was like 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.060
 very high quality tactical shooter and in 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:50.010
 appropriate style to us 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.950
 had to constantly evaluate enemies and 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:55.409
 situation give orders and choose 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:57.599
 various tactics the process itself took place 

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:59.609
 quite juicy with natural 

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:01.379
 felt like a commander gave away 

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:03.720
 for example an order fixer hack 

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:06.060
 terminal and at this time the clamped squad 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.650
 the corner was shot off by a mob of enemies or 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.930
 it was possible to arrange comrades on 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:12.090
 positions and run to the terminal itself 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:14.250
 or undermine the door while you 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:16.380
 ran did you see how you rushing like 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:18.810
 and their holly shoot your comrades 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:21.359
 at that moment you really knew what 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:23.729
 I'll cover you but there was still a chance 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:24.630
 that the leopard will shoot but in this case 

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:27.060
 there was a choice 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:29.460
 could either call for help to 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:30.419
 we are risen to lose even 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.699
 Ignat someone ranks 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:34.080
 or carry out the order 

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:36.000
 successfully complete the mission 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.590
 with all this degree of tension in 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.050
 few moments well naturally 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:42.360
 off scale when you had to blow 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:44.699
 reactor jeonosis final defend 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:46.110
 you can cruiser or destroy the ship 

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:48.240
 separatists on wallets 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:50.220
 presence effect was just 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.180
 colossal especially if you were passing 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:53.849
 it's all on hard 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:55.530
 enemies from everywhere purley ammo 

00:04:53.849 --> 00:04:57.840
 ended and had to later 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:05:00.240
 go to the melee and shooting out 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:03.110
 pistol and in this, too, was a special gusto 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:05.169
 you crash tank carcasses of enemies 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:07.210
 miniature wedge 

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:11.169
 divide the droid chips there to you 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:13.599
 bile bleed on helmet 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:15.189
 butter everybody can not see anything later 

00:05:13.599 --> 00:05:17.229
 analogue of such janitors in the helmet 

00:05:15.189 --> 00:05:19.210
 runs it all clean while doing 

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:21.189
 the firing pistol he got charged 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:23.199
 long though endless ammo and 

00:05:21.189 --> 00:05:24.969
 at the same time it was necessary to keep up 

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:27.520
 orders to give and watch all this 

00:05:24.969 --> 00:05:29.499
 detachment voltage was well, just wild 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:32.919
 some wild dynamics and i must say 

00:05:29.499 --> 00:05:35.319
 what is but young met dawes to 

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:36.909
 this also pleased the atmosphere besides 

00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:38.710
 good on here marine graphics 

00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:40.360
 Fans delighted and only 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:42.999
 traditional compositions of john 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:45.339
 williams which we all heard from 

00:05:42.999 --> 00:05:47.830
 film but also specially recorded 

00:05:45.339 --> 00:05:49.089
 tracks then they nicely mowed under 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:51.550
 magician lorenzi 

00:05:49.089 --> 00:05:53.860
 but the soundtrack was 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:56.229
 actually such as their film thanks 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:58.779
 what creates real before our eyes and 

00:05:56.229 --> 00:06:00.699
 scenes from films when all questions 

00:05:58.779 --> 00:06:02.710
 shot just like we all 

00:06:00.699 --> 00:06:04.870
 used to hearing the network exploding 

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:07.240
 shouted clones for actually we looked 

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:09.490
 pain but only on behalf of them planned 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:12.789
 Warriors else the game was filled with various 

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:15.310
 little things that might not be noticeable 

00:06:12.789 --> 00:06:18.310
 fans we plant but they noticed them 

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:20.529
 who cares about droids 

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:23.139
 for example usually behave the same way 

00:06:20.529 --> 00:06:25.389
 like a movie they mumble some nonsense 

00:06:23.139 --> 00:06:27.279
 when they didn’t take down their head 

00:06:25.389 --> 00:06:28.899
 shoot in all directions indiscriminately 

00:06:27.279 --> 00:06:31.419
 go somewhere there stumble on 

00:06:28.899 --> 00:06:33.659
 subject and fall in the end super 

00:06:31.419 --> 00:06:36.099
 droids approached repelled them and 

00:06:33.659 --> 00:06:38.169
 continued to shoot and when they themselves already 

00:06:36.099 --> 00:06:38.979
 on the floor they put with a small share 

00:06:38.169 --> 00:06:41.560
 probabilities 

00:06:38.979 --> 00:06:43.689
 could without legs for example 0 and with legs on 

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:45.610
 one hand crawl towards us and and shoot them 

00:06:43.689 --> 00:06:47.889
 it was possible to come and finish with savory 

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:49.820
 his blade into the bulb in general and 

00:06:47.889 --> 00:06:52.100
 opponents will be cool to do 

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:54.500
 they squatted in every possible way 

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:56.450
 take cover if for example this throw 

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:57.830
 grenade super droids and thighs and decks 

00:06:56.450 --> 00:07:00.680
 invoice 

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:03.110
 pencil they could stupidly take her foot 

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:05.330
 from 30 to early back and already accounted for 

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:07.760
 save me and of course all this 

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:10.310
 accompanied by a cheerful chatter squad 

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:12.590
 goal while they could blurt out something 

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:14.780
 even while playing that wave 

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:17.360
 such a horror funny this nothing 

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:19.280
 No, because in the second part of the company 

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:22.600
 such an atmosphere really was not 

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:24.740
 get out of course but it was fun result 

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:28.240
 wonderful game in the stellar universe 

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:31.370
 wars without a single jedi and banal and 

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:34.840
 dynamic and very sorry that lukasarts and 

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:34.840
 no longer do such
