00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.190 
focus on the larger ones you do need to
keep<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:29.970> smaller<00:01:30.210> ones<00:01:30.450> there<00:01:30.659> though<00:01:30.869> just

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
keep the smaller ones there though just

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.690 
keep the smaller ones there though just
because<00:01:31.470> they<00:01:31.590> evolve<00:01:31.860> a<00:01:32.009> bit<00:01:32.189> quicker<00:01:32.460> with

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
because they evolve a bit quicker with

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.270 
because they evolve a bit quicker with
them<00:01:32.850> so<00:01:33.810> I'm<00:01:34.170> waiting<00:01:34.439> revived<00:01:34.740> here<00:01:35.040> and

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
them so I'm waiting revived here and

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.030 
them so I'm waiting revived here and
we're<00:01:35.400> actually<00:01:35.490> going<00:01:35.700> to<00:01:35.790> go<00:01:35.939> follow<00:01:36.270> this

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040 
we're actually going to go follow this

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.340 
we're actually going to go follow this
railroad<00:01:38.040> track<00:01:38.430> area<00:01:38.670> of<00:01:38.850> this<00:01:39.090> way<00:01:39.329> and<00:01:40.049> try

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
railroad track area of this way and try

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.660 
railroad track area of this way and try
not<00:01:40.560> bad<00:01:40.740> but<00:01:40.950> you<00:01:40.979> can<00:01:41.070> kill<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.460> smaller

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
not bad but you can kill the smaller

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:42.950 
not bad but you can kill the smaller
ones<00:01:41.880> if<00:01:42.000> you<00:01:42.030> need<00:01:42.240> to<00:01:42.360> and<00:01:42.600> you're<00:01:42.659> gonna<00:01:42.810> go

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
ones if you need to and you're gonna go

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.289 
ones if you need to and you're gonna go
up<00:01:43.049> here<00:01:43.380> and<00:01:43.560> go<00:01:44.280> right<00:01:44.310> under<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:44.909> tracks

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
up here and go right under the tracks

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:46.340 
up here and go right under the tracks
right<00:01:45.570> around<00:01:45.720> here<00:01:45.930> and<00:01:46.170> you're<00:01:46.259> gonna

right around here and you're gonna

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.539 
right around here and you're gonna
follow<00:01:46.500> it<00:01:46.680> backwards<00:01:47.130> just<00:01:47.310> so<00:01:47.430> you<00:01:47.520> don't

bandits at spawn in this area so you're
gonna<00:02:15.800> run<00:02:16.040> at<00:02:16.220> the<00:02:16.550> doorway<00:02:16.790> through<00:02:17.420> this

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
gonna run at the doorway through this

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.030 
gonna run at the doorway through this
way<00:02:17.750> that<00:02:18.140> would<00:02:18.260> be<00:02:18.440> a<00:02:18.470> bunch<00:02:18.620> of<00:02:18.800> them<00:02:18.890> there

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040

that spawning that you saw and you're

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.699 
that spawning that you saw and you're
just<00:02:21.769> gonna<00:02:21.860> let<00:02:22.069> it<00:02:22.130> go<00:02:22.310> kill<00:02:22.550> some<00:02:22.790> so

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
just gonna let it go kill some so

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:25.809 
just gonna let it go kill some so
anyways<00:02:24.709> once<00:02:25.040> it<00:02:25.160> kills<00:02:25.340> enough<00:02:25.580> of<00:02:25.730> them

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:25.819 
anyways once it kills enough of them

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:28.660 
anyways once it kills enough of them
it'll<00:02:26.000> evolve<00:02:26.330> into<00:02:27.069> Burma<00:02:28.069> versus<00:02:28.340> the

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
it'll evolve into Burma versus the

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.270 
it'll evolve into Burma versus the
invincible<00:02:29.209> right<00:02:29.390> here<00:02:29.750> so<00:02:30.680> there<00:02:30.890> is<00:02:31.010> on<00:02:31.190> the
