when<00:00:14.720> I<00:00:14.750> was<00:00:14.960> just<00:00:15.140> a<00:00:15.260> wee<00:00:15.290> young<00:00:15.800> lad<00:00:16.070> at<00:00:16.490> our

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:17.240 
when I was just a wee young lad at our

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.630 
when I was just a wee young lad at our
family<00:00:17.660> Christmas<00:00:18.080> party<00:00:18.140> my<00:00:18.710> Uncle<00:00:19.039> Tom<00:00:19.250> told

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:19.640 
family Christmas party my Uncle Tom told

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.580

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:29.890 
me that well he told me that beer was
made<00:00:21.860> from<00:00:22.100> bug<00:00:22.430> pee

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:29.900 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:36.460 

I<00:00:34.000> thought<00:00:35.000> about<00:00:35.150> how<00:00:35.450> many<00:00:35.630> bugs<00:00:35.960> would<00:00:36.290> have

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:36.470 
I thought about how many bugs would have

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:38.500 
I thought about how many bugs would have
to<00:00:36.650> pee<00:00:36.829> just<00:00:37.190> to<00:00:37.280> make<00:00:37.489> one<00:00:37.760> beer<00:00:38.059> because

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:38.510 
to pee just to make one beer because

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.850 
to pee just to make one beer because
seriously<00:00:39.250> how<00:00:40.250> much<00:00:40.400> peak<00:00:40.730> in<00:00:40.940> one<00:00:41.120> bug<00:00:41.360> make

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:41.860 
seriously how much peak in one bug make

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.170 
seriously how much peak in one bug make
they<00:00:42.860> would<00:00:43.010> have<00:00:43.129> to<00:00:43.250> get<00:00:43.400> as<00:00:43.520> much<00:00:43.699> out<00:00:43.910> of<00:00:43.970> a

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:44.180 
they would have to get as much out of a

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:51.040 
they would have to get as much out of a
bug<00:00:44.360> as<00:00:44.570> possible<00:00:49.330> what<00:00:50.330> if<00:00:50.420> there<00:00:50.570> were<00:00:50.690> bug

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.050 
bug as possible what if there were bug

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.350 
bug as possible what if there were bug
masters<00:00:51.650> who<00:00:51.830> gave<00:00:52.070> the<00:00:52.220> bugs<00:00:52.489> and<00:00:52.699> a<00:00:52.760> caffeine

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:53.360 
masters who gave the bugs and a caffeine

00:00:53.360 --> 00:01:01.660 
masters who gave the bugs and a caffeine
addiction<00:00:53.650> and<00:00:54.650> made<00:00:54.830> them<00:00:54.980> drink<00:00:55.250> coffee<00:01:00.670> or

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
addiction and made them drink coffee or

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.930 
addiction and made them drink coffee or
maybe<00:01:02.479> when<00:01:02.809> the<00:01:02.930> bugs<00:01:03.140> fell<00:01:03.470> asleep<00:01:03.890> the<00:01:04.699> bug

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:04.940 
maybe when the bugs fell asleep the bug

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.090 
maybe when the bugs fell asleep the bug
masters<00:01:05.510> put<00:01:05.780> their<00:01:05.960> bug<00:01:06.170> legs<00:01:06.440> in<00:01:06.680> a<00:01:06.740> bucket

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
masters put their bug legs in a bucket

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:16.719 
masters put their bug legs in a bucket
of<00:01:07.190> warm<00:01:07.400> water<00:01:14.890> what<00:01:15.890> if<00:01:15.979> the<00:01:16.100> bug<00:01:16.280> masters

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:16.729 
of warm water what if the bug masters

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:19.600 
of warm water what if the bug masters
put<00:01:17.000> a<00:01:17.030> sink<00:01:17.479> in<00:01:17.630> the<00:01:17.689> bug<00:01:17.960> cage<00:01:18.290> and<00:01:18.650> turn<00:01:19.460> the

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 
put a sink in the bug cage and turn the

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.480 
put a sink in the bug cage and turn the
water<00:01:19.820> on<00:01:20.030> to<00:01:20.330> just<00:01:20.540> let<00:01:20.689> it<00:01:20.720> run<00:01:21.020> and<00:01:21.290> run<00:01:21.530> how

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
water on to just let it run and run how

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:24.160

about<00:01:22.700> that<00:01:22.909> sound<00:01:23.270> of<00:01:23.420> running<00:01:23.570> water<00:01:23.750> would

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
about that sound of running water would

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.660 
about that sound of running water would
make<00:01:24.200> the<00:01:24.470> bug<00:01:24.680> be<00:01:24.979> all<00:01:25.159> over<00:01:25.400> the<00:01:25.580> place<00:01:27.670> the

make the bug be all over the place the

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.090 
make the bug be all over the place the
bug<00:01:28.909> masters<00:01:29.360> probably<00:01:29.960> put<00:01:30.200> on<00:01:30.229> a<00:01:30.350> scary<00:01:30.770> mask

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
bug masters probably put on a scary mask

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:41.380 
bug masters probably put on a scary mask
and<00:01:31.400> scare<00:01:31.700> the<00:01:31.880> piss<00:01:32.060> out<00:01:32.299> of<00:01:32.330> them<00:01:32.479> yeah<00:01:40.390> I'll

bet<00:01:41.600> the<00:01:41.720> bug<00:01:41.960> masters<00:01:42.530> even<00:01:42.860> strapped<00:01:43.220> the

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:43.370 
bet the bug masters even strapped the

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:45.340 
bet the bug masters even strapped the
bugs<00:01:43.640> down<00:01:43.910> and<00:01:44.270> tickle<00:01:44.630> them<00:01:44.780> until<00:01:44.810> they<00:01:45.200> get

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
bugs down and tickle them until they get
