00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:06.520
 the pour in the gala previous Julieta is called 11 viana to fall in love 

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:11.010
 consequently try to conquer the first current position of the system 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.479
 solar already shortly 

00:00:13.479 --> 00:00:17.550
 After having faced a sentence Julieta has more prepared than ever 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.349
 to make it clear that it will not be 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:23.159
 it is not easy to be that of that goal only you 

00:00:23.159 --> 00:00:26.419
 more to deliver than ever culiacÃ¡n and singer 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.680
 it can be revived 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:57.330
 Lidia 

00:02:17.139 --> 00:02:20.139
 Already at night 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:51.379
 but not by motto like about two for the arrangements I think I'm trying 

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:56.059
 d personalize the songs in a way which I think is right 

00:02:57.179 --> 00:02:59.729
 I did not feel it was a meringue until the choir enters 

00:02:59.729 --> 00:03:03.169
 First part of the song I felt how I was singing Navarrese 

00:03:03.169 --> 00:03:04.499
 p be careful 

00:03:04.499 --> 00:03:08.959
 to always keep the same spirit of the song sang does very well very 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:13.389
 fun the fantastic dance part but I felt that the first part the pair 

00:03:13.389 --> 00:03:17.109
 of the truffle cited me as a bullet or palm tree and convenient there is a 

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:19.639
 a little conflict for me 

00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:21.699
 in the assault 

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:23.630
 - I say that I part as it says 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:28.380
 the committee of the tournament happened of social gathering brings bcg that to make it yours they take away 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.380
 little the essence of what the song is that's what I felt 

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:36.749
 good uribe but that the rest is always about maintaining a style a style 

00:03:36.749 --> 00:03:39.749
 very own you have a very particular way of singing 

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:41.699
 at first 

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:43.819
 there were a couple of 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:45.739
 there that I think twitter counts 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:49.179
 that I mentioned earlier when it comes to keeping short sentences 

00:03:49.179 --> 00:03:52.559
 Be careful with the ends and in Haiti but with everything else it was very 

00:03:52.559 --> 00:03:55.109
 surprised how you are daring also accepts to incorporate 

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:59.189
 pay inside a merengue that is not easy with the breath which I 

00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:02.189
 comment a very good job 

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:11.209
 julieta prandi I liked your interpretation but I think that 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:15.119
 and should have gone maybe a little more paired with the orchestra 

00:04:15.119 --> 00:04:17.059
 percent like that 

00:04:17.059 --> 00:04:19.989
 I do not know or I needed more to zalla 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:21.549
 massa horfor here 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:25.710
 but I liked your interpretation music I liked how the singer but 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:29.189
 I feel that it was missing as more sd 

00:04:29.189 --> 00:04:31.259
 between the orchestra and you 

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:33.050
 recintonet to the vestas 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:37.520
 of secretary of state a little worried about delivering everything has to 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:38.270
 be 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:41.690
 but then since it incorporates this with the dance body is expected to reach 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:44.690
 provoke a good crutch presentation 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.360
 the company reinforces the idea 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.139
 and happened to get out of this situation 

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:52.700
 fcc through the screen because 

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:54.559
 Julieta DÃ­az 

00:04:54.559 --> 00:04:57.740
 receives the appearing 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:59.029
 2. 3 

00:04:59.029 --> 00:04:59.659
 All the passengers
