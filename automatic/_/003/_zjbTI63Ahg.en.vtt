book search for the single note so the

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.769 
book search for the single note so the
idea<00:00:25.250> of<00:00:25.460> this<00:00:25.610> is<00:00:25.900> to<00:00:26.900> move<00:00:27.230> you<00:00:27.560> from<00:00:28.779> playing

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:29.779 
idea of this is to move you from playing

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:31.269 
idea of this is to move you from playing
a<00:00:30.110> load<00:00:30.320> of<00:00:30.439> notes<00:00:30.619> all<00:00:30.800> at<00:00:30.860> the<00:00:30.919> same<00:00:31.040> time

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:31.279 
a load of notes all at the same time

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:34.660 
a load of notes all at the same time
like<00:00:31.550> we've<00:00:32.000> done<00:00:32.150> with<00:00:32.329> chugging<00:00:33.430> to<00:00:34.430> be<00:00:34.579> able

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:34.670 
like we've done with chugging to be able

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:36.520 
like we've done with chugging to be able
to<00:00:34.850> get<00:00:35.030> single<00:00:35.510> clear<00:00:35.750> notes<00:00:36.050> so<00:00:36.230> this<00:00:36.380> is

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:36.530 
to get single clear notes so this is

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.420 
to get single clear notes so this is
really<00:00:36.770> for<00:00:37.130> beginners<00:00:39.280> people<00:00:40.280> being

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:40.430 
really for beginners people being

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:41.710 
really for beginners people being
playing<00:00:40.640> for<00:00:40.760> some<00:00:40.910> time<00:00:41.120> might<00:00:41.480> want<00:00:41.600> to<00:00:41.660> have

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.040 
reference point you can do that but it

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.980 
reference point you can do that but it
you<00:01:07.700> can't<00:01:07.939> move<00:01:08.060> around<00:01:08.299> very<00:01:08.420> fast<00:01:08.780> with

you can't move around very fast with

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.410 
you can't move around very fast with
that<00:01:09.140> one<00:01:09.670> another<00:01:10.670> thing<00:01:11.000> is<00:01:11.119> you<00:01:11.240> put

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 
that one another thing is you put

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.510 
that one another thing is you put
masking<00:01:11.840> tape<00:01:12.140> over<00:01:12.619> the<00:01:13.040> holes<00:01:13.250> that<00:01:13.460> you

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
masking tape over the holes that you

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.130 
masking tape over the holes that you
don't<00:01:13.729> want<00:01:13.880> to<00:01:13.939> play<00:01:14.090> I<00:01:14.299> know<00:01:15.020> it<00:01:15.079> sounds

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
don't want to play I know it sounds

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:16.660 
don't want to play I know it sounds
silly<00:01:15.439> but<00:01:15.619> we<00:01:15.740> use<00:01:15.920> that<00:01:16.100> and<00:01:16.310> when<00:01:16.460> we're

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670 
silly but we use that and when we're

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.989 
silly but we use that and when we're
learning<00:01:17.090> to<00:01:17.420> practice<00:01:17.810> note<00:01:18.229> bending<00:01:18.999> the

00:01:19.989 --> 00:01:19.999 
learning to practice note bending the

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:22.029 
learning to practice note bending the
other<00:01:20.119> way<00:01:20.299> is<00:01:20.409> puckering<00:01:21.409> where<00:01:21.770> you<00:01:21.859> put

00:01:22.029 --> 00:01:22.039 
other way is puckering where you put

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:23.919 
other way is puckering where you put
your<00:01:22.069> lips<00:01:22.939> in<00:01:23.179> the<00:01:23.210> shape<00:01:23.479> as<00:01:23.630> if<00:01:23.780> you're

00:01:23.919 --> 00:01:23.929 
your lips in the shape as if you're

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:31.950 
your lips in the shape as if you're
whistling<00:01:24.549> like<00:01:25.549> that<00:01:25.729> puckering<00:01:26.179> or<00:01:26.359> kissing

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:31.960 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.520 

that's<00:01:32.960> the<00:01:33.110> thing<00:01:33.230> we're<00:01:33.350> going<00:01:33.470> to

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
that's the thing we're going to

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.160 
that's the thing we're going to
concentrate<00:01:33.800> on<00:01:34.010> here<00:01:34.600> the<00:01:35.600> other<00:01:35.720> method<00:01:35.870> you

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
concentrate on here the other method you

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:37.680 
concentrate on here the other method you
could<00:01:36.380> talk<00:01:36.590> about<00:01:36.710> his<00:01:36.920> tongue<00:01:37.100> blocking

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:37.690 
could talk about his tongue blocking

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:40.900 
could talk about his tongue blocking
that's<00:01:38.690> where<00:01:38.900> you<00:01:38.990> block<00:01:39.320> the<00:01:39.980> first<00:01:40.340> few

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:40.910 
that's where you block the first few

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:42.220 
that's where you block the first few
holes<00:01:41.210> of<00:01:41.390> the<00:01:41.420> instrument<00:01:41.840> with<00:01:41.930> your<00:01:42.020> tongue

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:42.230 
holes of the instrument with your tongue

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:44.770 
holes of the instrument with your tongue
and<00:01:42.440> you<00:01:43.010> leave<00:01:43.220> one<00:01:43.460> empty<00:01:43.730> and<00:01:44.030> there's<00:01:44.600> lots

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
and you leave one empty and there's lots

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.660 
and you leave one empty and there's lots
of<00:01:44.900> advantages<00:01:45.110> of<00:01:45.470> that<00:01:45.740> as<00:01:46.220> well<00:01:46.460> when

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
of advantages of that as well when

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.360 
of advantages of that as well when
you're<00:01:46.790> playing<00:01:46.970> but<00:01:47.540> I<00:01:47.600> think<00:01:48.220> starting<00:01:49.220> with

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:49.370 
you're playing but I think starting with

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:50.500 
you're playing but I think starting with
puckering<00:01:49.670> i<00:01:49.790> think<00:01:49.970> is<00:01:50.030> probably<00:01:50.120> the<00:01:50.330> best

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:50.510 
puckering i think is probably the best

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:53.950 
puckering i think is probably the best
thing<00:01:50.630> learn<00:01:51.560> to<00:01:51.710> do<00:01:51.800> both<00:01:51.950> if<00:01:52.160> you<00:01:52.250> can<00:01:52.960> so

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960 
thing learn to do both if you can so

00:01:53.960 --> 00:02:12.520 
thing learn to do both if you can so
starting<00:01:54.740> for<00:01:54.920> just<00:01:55.100> whole<00:01:55.250> one

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.780 

now<00:02:13.530> all<00:02:13.709> the<00:02:13.830> tunes<00:02:14.069> in<00:02:14.250> this<00:02:14.370> book<00:02:14.610> are

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
now all the tunes in this book are

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.050 
now all the tunes in this book are
really<00:02:15.330> simple<00:02:15.990> and<00:02:16.200> there<00:02:17.160> they<00:02:17.670> start<00:02:17.940> off

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
really simple and there they start off

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.420 
really simple and there they start off
just<00:02:18.330> purely<00:02:18.660> as<00:02:18.840> patterns<00:02:19.290> or<00:02:19.410> exercises<00:02:20.010> but

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
just purely as patterns or exercises but

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:21.770 
just purely as patterns or exercises but
once<00:02:20.640> you<00:02:20.730> hear<00:02:20.760> the<00:02:20.910> backing<00:02:21.300> track<00:02:21.330> you'll

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
once you hear the backing track you'll

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.630 
once you hear the backing track you'll
hear<00:02:21.990> how<00:02:22.170> it<00:02:22.260> works<00:02:22.440> so<00:02:23.280> I'm<00:02:23.340> just<00:02:23.459> going<00:02:23.580> to

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
hear how it works so I'm just going to

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.780 
hear how it works so I'm just going to
play<00:02:23.910> only<00:02:24.180> whole<00:02:24.600> one<00:02:24.870> and<00:02:25.340> this<00:02:26.340> is<00:02:26.459> the<00:02:26.580> tomb

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
play only whole one and this is the tomb

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.460 
play only whole one and this is the tomb
