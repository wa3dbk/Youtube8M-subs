00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 hey people and welcome to 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.980
 another video of me I have 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.840
 here the iphone 6 and the iphone 6 plus 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.330
 and in this video it's supposed to be one 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.219
 first conclusion go how do I find the 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.800
 Devices like you do after the first one 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.480
 days use if you like possible 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.580
 or if I say that is 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.199
 actually total scrap the experience 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.560
 you after the intro I wish you much 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.560
 fun 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:32.669
 First of all something general and indeed 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.340
 to the sand i have however the iphone 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.710
 5 first and here in comparison to that 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.660
 iphone 6 is already the design has changed 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.030
 especially on the back and also 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.110
 here at the corners or at the edges 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.180
 the changed yet again, are 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.739
 now rounded I like it 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.309
 personally better is essential 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.960
 better in hand than the iphone 5 first 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:54.539
 but what many people find not so good 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.860
 that's the back at the 5 it was it 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.829
 rather so that the return helps 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.180
 from glass share also existed and 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.219
 now that's a behind everything 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.559
 aluminum or these stripes 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.390
 here are these antennas and so on 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.670
 are now on the back 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.500
 to see much more than stop by 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.810
 predecessor meanwhile I really have to 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.210
 quite honestly at the beginning it has me 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.650
 not so much but now 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.030
 in the meantime after a few days 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.640
 I actually like it 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.100
 That's not so good as me 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.710
 say organ iphone is real 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.390
 so I say okay the back has 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.680
 actually what I think 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.000
 not perfect either way you could 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.189
 Of course they do a lot better 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.200
 the back, for example, is like that 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.880
 back on the ipad mini so jan has 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.979
 are now up here or something 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.439
 But I have to be completely honest with myself 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.150
 actually pleases something in itself 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.740
 you really think that's very good 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.070
 display is a bit rounded 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.780
 one kennedys far gestures endres if it 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.640
 want to write back somewhere in the 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.950
 settings or e-mails and so on 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.500
 The whole thing is really clear 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.880
 more pleasant and makes more fun, so to speak 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.590
 but it really is one 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.560
 pleasant feeling so if you have the 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.360
 whole this edge has the iphone 5 s 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.680
 and if you 're so overfished it is 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.540
 really a different feeling than 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.160
 if it is here on iphone 6 now 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.110
 all buttons can be really synonymous 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.060
 It is very good to use the loud and 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.520
 quiet buttons or be it here 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.600
 the power button 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.610
 one has become accustomed to it meanwhile 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.410
 that had button on the right side 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.930
 is what I still meet some 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:23.600
 use the iphone 6 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.910
 with 472 as it has here I think now 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.970
 really as perfect size i have yes 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:32.120
 the iphone 6 plus in direct comparison 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:34.310
 you can see what a blatant 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.840
 difference is and I have to say that 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.660
 just find this size of 72 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:41.360
 really perfect the iphone 6 plus is 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:44.810
 because it is by no means bad 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:46.280
 just bigger with 55 inches it is 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.050
 also better for some applications 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.090
 It would be suitable to watch many films 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:51.920
 would like to show some with editorial 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:55.040
 would like on his iphone or many 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.840
 photos makes the iphone 6 for the case 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.180
 plus a better choice to come to yes 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.920
 also later on the photos and 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.770
 yes I have to say for everyday life if 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:06.290
 i really love the iphone 6 with 5 7 inches 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:09.410
 really good if I take it off and on 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.760
 to use on iphone 5 then it is 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:12.170
 already then really different 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.210
 Here you can see it all again 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:16.880
 Comparison to the iphone 6 plus and part 

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:18.500
 also to the normal iphone 6 i would like 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:20.000
 in no case more on the four 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.130
 inch back this is really one 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.570
 really blatant conversion there again 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:25.880
 to go back but I like how 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:28.670
 4.7 inches is perfect for everyday life 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:30.410
 suitable 55 inches is now on none 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:32.180
 case ill suited so you will come too 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:33.980
 Well over there with the thumb is but 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.380
 it would be better with two hands 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.600
 served come to the next point and 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:40.459
 Although the camera apple itself advertises 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.830
 This camera always special on the 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:45.050
 website or on the keynote yet is 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:47.360
 She really is so good and I have to go all the way 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:49.970
 honestly say yes it was really right 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:53.690
 fun with it to take photos to make 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:55.910
 or even the new 240 frames per 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:57.800
 second slomo videos are really 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:59.390
 really well driven really well 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:02.030
 good especially the optical 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:03.500
 image stabilization on the iphone 6 plus da 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:05.740
 the whole thing about this motion 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.790
 Processor use this movement 

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:09.410
 registered if you like the iphone 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:11.810
 Moves the videos thereby act 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:14.030
 significantly smoother and if you also 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:15.709
 even with 60 frames per second 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:18.520
 then it really does 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:20.780
 really much fun with the iphone 6 plus 

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:22.669
 to make films and so on 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:24.830
 It can really get on there 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:25.610
 some digital cameras or dsl first 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:26.900
 keep up 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:29.419
 Here you see it was a few 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:32.120
 sample pictures with the iphone 6 plus and 

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:34.009
 atrium with the iphone 6 from the colors 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.539
 and from the contrast, too 

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:38.719
 again significantly improved 

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:40.759
 contrast than the iphone 5 is more accurate 

00:04:38.719 --> 00:04:42.469
 compare to that there are also still 

00:04:40.759 --> 00:04:44.810
 some videos will be in the near future 

00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:46.039
 you do not want to miss then you can 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:47.419
 you like subscribe below I want it 

00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:49.180
 not at this conclusion on each one 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:51.740
 A hold function is on a 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:53.419
 basic upshot of course there 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:54.889
 We do not even do that at all 

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:58.189
 that's how you like it and that's for one thing 

00:04:54.889 --> 00:05:00.379
 18 and the apps like some apps 

00:04:58.189 --> 00:05:02.240
 example whatsapp treat potter so the 

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:05.180
 are not yet for the iphone 6 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:05.750
 plus neatly optimized for the iphone 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:07.879
 6 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:10.159
 and if you whatsapp here on the 

00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:12.289
 iphone 6 plus uses then you think 

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:15.379
 Really that somehow holds such a handy 

00:05:12.289 --> 00:05:17.449
 for older people because that's just mega 

00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:19.460
 scaled large so it stops on the 

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:21.379
 big screen also shown 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:23.750
 will always come to the end now 

00:05:21.379 --> 00:05:25.520
 battery since the iphone is always such a 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:26.419
 device where it really really mega 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:28.310
 can score 

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:31.129
 but once you get under the 

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:34.159
 use looks when hiring 

00:05:31.129 --> 00:05:37.310
 there like it because three days and five hours 

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:39.979
 so are 29 hours almost 30 hours where 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:42.409
 I have the thing in standby now and 

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:46.009
 use is the whole at six 

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:48.860
 Hours 45 minutes so almost seven 

00:05:46.009 --> 00:05:51.110
 hours use is and just as one 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:53.150
 thing with the iphone 6 plus sees the whole 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:55.370
 always clearly different from here you have 

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:57.349
 yes almost at the three 1000 milliampere there 

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:59.900
 the battery is really good 

00:05:57.349 --> 00:06:02.930
 It's easy to get there two days a day 

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:04.939
 good that two days off with the iphone 

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:07.189
 6 I have the apple case again 

00:06:04.939 --> 00:06:09.800
 mate purchase costs 45 euros 

00:06:07.189 --> 00:06:11.599
 and I'm really from this case 

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:13.969
 Complacent, too, comes again 

00:06:11.599 --> 00:06:15.589
 an extra review between games like 

00:06:13.969 --> 00:06:17.300
 I think so definitely first 

00:06:15.589 --> 00:06:19.669
 Im impression I really like it 

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:21.259
 that's good, that's it 

00:06:19.669 --> 00:06:22.639
 I have been back , I hope it has 

00:06:21.259 --> 00:06:24.050
 you like it and I hope you have it 

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:26.419
 give a little insight 

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:29.419
 to the first impressions to the iphone 6 

00:06:26.419 --> 00:06:31.370
 and iPhone 6 plus otherwise composed of 

00:06:29.419 --> 00:06:32.210
 to have been at the first conclusion, I hope 

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:33.740
 you liked it 

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:35.120
 how should it be gone then video 

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:35.980
 could like a thumbs up 

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:37.510
 go 

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:39.220
 subscribe below for no further 

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:43.200
 I miss videos 

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:43.200
 for watching until the next video
