00:00:34.439 --> 00:00:34.449 
it's the nature to work these days but

00:00:34.449 --> 00:00:37.850 
it's the nature to work these days but
work<00:00:35.079> seems<00:00:35.320> to<00:00:35.410> be<00:00:35.579> progressing<00:00:36.579> slower<00:00:37.180> and

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
work seems to be progressing slower and

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.439 
work seems to be progressing slower and
at<00:00:38.860> the<00:00:38.920> end<00:00:39.040> of<00:00:39.070> the<00:00:39.160> day<00:00:39.339> I<00:00:39.610> looked<00:00:40.030> round<00:00:40.180> and

00:00:40.439 --> 00:00:40.449 
at the end of the day I looked round and

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:42.030 
at the end of the day I looked round and
not<00:00:40.930> quite<00:00:41.170> sure<00:00:41.199> what<00:00:41.589> it<00:00:41.680> is<00:00:41.800> that<00:00:41.980> I

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:42.040 
not quite sure what it is that I

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.180 
not quite sure what it is that I
complished<00:00:42.870> it's<00:00:43.870> really<00:00:44.410> difficult<00:00:44.620> for<00:00:45.010> me

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:45.190 
complished it's really difficult for me

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:47.970 
complished it's really difficult for me
to<00:00:45.550> imagine<00:00:45.940> actually<00:00:46.540> ever<00:00:47.140> being<00:00:47.559> done<00:00:47.769> with

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:47.980 
to imagine actually ever being done with

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.460 
to imagine actually ever being done with
this<00:00:48.100> first<00:00:49.059> I<00:00:49.269> thought<00:00:49.449> maybe<00:00:49.989> I'd<00:00:50.170> be<00:00:50.260> done

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:50.470 
this first I thought maybe I'd be done

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:56.310 
this first I thought maybe I'd be done
in<00:00:50.680> a<00:00:50.890> couple<00:00:51.760> months<00:00:52.210> maybe<00:00:52.829> now<00:00:53.829> and<00:00:54.190> I<00:00:55.320> am

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:56.320 
in a couple months maybe now and I am

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.680 
in a couple months maybe now and I am
seeing<00:00:56.590> how<00:00:56.829> people<00:00:56.969> turn<00:00:57.969> their<00:00:58.149> places<00:00:58.420> into

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:58.690 
seeing how people turn their places into

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:04.859 
seeing how people turn their places into
multi<00:00:59.079> or<00:00:59.199> projects<00:01:02.550> but<00:01:03.550> it<00:01:03.969> really<00:01:04.330> is<00:01:04.539> much

00:01:04.859 --> 00:01:04.869 
multi or projects but it really is much

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:07.889 
multi or projects but it really is much
more<00:01:05.110> of<00:01:05.170> a<00:01:05.940> mental<00:01:06.940> game<00:01:07.149> for<00:01:07.539> me<00:01:07.630> at<00:01:07.720> this

00:01:07.889 --> 00:01:07.899

00:01:09.749 --> 00:01:09.759 
point it's a lot of thinking and

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:11.969 
point it's a lot of thinking and
troubleshooting<00:01:10.330> which<00:01:11.050> takes<00:01:11.740> a<00:01:11.860> little

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:11.979 
troubleshooting which takes a little

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:15.300 
troubleshooting which takes a little
more<00:01:12.119> mental<00:01:13.119> effort<00:01:13.890> we've<00:01:14.890> got<00:01:15.039> 10<00:01:15.280> days
