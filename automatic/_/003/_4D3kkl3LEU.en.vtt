00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
guys can see this is the test of my bow

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.490 
guys can see this is the test of my bow
field3<00:00:25.529> game<00:00:26.599> that<00:00:27.599> sounded<00:00:28.050> really<00:00:28.320> stupid

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
field3 game that sounded really stupid

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.849 
field3 game that sounded really stupid
let<00:00:29.369> me<00:00:29.490> rephrase<00:00:29.760> that<00:00:29.820> that<00:00:30.810> this<00:00:31.080> game

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
let me rephrase that that this game

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.040 
let me rephrase that that this game
behind<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.640> commentary<00:00:33.390> right<00:00:33.690> now<00:00:33.809> is

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
behind the commentary right now is

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.590 
behind the commentary right now is
basically<00:00:34.620> a<00:00:35.040> test<00:00:35.520> about<00:00:35.940> field<00:00:36.360> three<00:00:36.510> to

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
basically a test about field three to

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.680 
basically a test about field three to
see<00:00:36.750> how<00:00:36.989> much<00:00:37.230> frames<00:00:37.590> I<00:00:37.770> got<00:00:37.980> so<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:39.030> minimum

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
see how much frames I got so the minimum

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.700 
see how much frames I got so the minimum
frames<00:00:40.230> was<00:00:40.530> 39<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.879> max<00:00:42.450> or<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:42.960> highest<00:00:43.290> was

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
frames was 39 the max or the highest was

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.930 
frames was 39 the max or the highest was
129<00:00:44.640> and<00:00:44.940> then<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.780> average<00:00:46.260> is<00:00:46.440> 83<00:00:46.860> frames<00:00:47.460> so

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
129 and then the average is 83 frames so

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.880 
129 and then the average is 83 frames so
that<00:00:47.969> is<00:00:48.270> beast<00:00:48.570> and<00:00:48.809> this<00:00:48.899> is<00:00:49.050> on<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.559> highest

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
that is beast and this is on the highest

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.290 
that is beast and this is on the highest
settings<00:00:50.340> which<00:00:50.460> you<00:00:50.489> guys<00:00:50.670> will<00:00:50.879> see<00:00:51.059> in<00:00:51.180> a

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
settings which you guys will see in a

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.090 
settings which you guys will see in a
couple<00:00:51.989> of<00:00:52.199> good<00:00:52.320> minutes<00:00:52.620> now<00:00:52.710> I<00:00:52.739> got<00:00:52.949> like<00:00:52.980> a
