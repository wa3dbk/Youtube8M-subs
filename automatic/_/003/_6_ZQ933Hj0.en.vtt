00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
 Hello, comrades, how are you waiting? 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:08.820
 Well today I bring you the first episode of 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:11.190
 top 5 troll eos top 5 trolls as you can 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.500
 be affirmative after they have not 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.960
 accepted this series in optic after 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.900
 think if sending it to a flat corpus does not 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.270
 I said and why not upload it to the channel 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.250
 directly this series I thought about it when 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.840
 the channel had 2000 comrades and I had 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.000
 many problems when it comes to finding 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.070
 clips so I decided it would be good 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.349
 idea to find a community channel like 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.420
 optic where I can do it but as 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.190
 now in the channel we are almost 8,000 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.129
 comrades would not be very far-fetched 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.760
 try to start this series here not 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:44.460
 Well, I'll tell you more about the matter later 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:46.590
 let's start with the top we start in the 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.200
 put 5 with der wood and with a trolley or 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.300
 pretty simple but effective it's about 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.520
 of jihad who the hell has not done 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.989
 never a jihad has not gotten a lot 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.789
 Four years ago on an island buggy 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.879
 stamping against a tank because it's 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:02.039
 lying good clip of woody not even us 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.899
 will teach that wally football has 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.420
 more uses than we know in the first 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.870
 place the ninja when getting behind the 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.360
 enemy 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:11.490
 undetected in second place of 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.620
 killer waving the poor man who 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.990
 I was here quietly unloading 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:17.760
 your charger but this does not end here toni 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.280
 He takes his guard to the ass of a 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.840
 enemy which starts to plan base 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.670
 that the enemy escapes but beware 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.200
 returns to its initial position what 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.140
 allows you to donate and finish your work 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:31.530
 double death ninja with walt and good clip 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.360
 tonic attention we step on the podium put 3 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.490
 for the comrade de luxe it seems that 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.500
 he also likes to handle wally but he 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.480
 he is not comfortable nor and he prefers to face 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.000
 to the problems and the enemies without 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:43.370
 we are here as calcina without 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.720
 compassion to the first enemy 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:47.940
 obviously this does not end here and 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.440
 continues his adventure in search of 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.270
 more victims the truth is that it is 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.860
 pretty easy to mess with the wali in 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.960
 maps like these where there is a melee 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.820
 amazing because the enemies though 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.040
 They know that wally is pretty dangerous 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.900
 they prefer to ignore it and prefer to shoot 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.330
 to the soldiers since they give more 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:05.190
 points the cau says friends the greed 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.930
 well it seems that de luxe that does not 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.720
 it works there is an enemy behind you 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.520
 willing to destroy ground point but its 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.900
 which and is not willing to die without 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.060
 before burning another 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.189
 and another one of what ends his 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.010
 walking with the spot with 3 flamed 

00:02:17.189 --> 00:02:22.470
 good friend clip silver medal 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.720
 all for 124 15 which is going to 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.579
 show that a troll clip can be very 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.680
 good even if we only kill an enemy 

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:30.510
 if we do it with originality as 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.310
 we are seeing uru has placed a lot 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.220
 from online mines to an enemy to 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:37.260
 generate a domino effect today with the 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.150
 fuck the camper of the truck and for 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:42.090
 put the icing on the cake a little bit of you 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:45.049
 It is very good cool here and now yes yes 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:47.220
 gold put one for trevor gamer 

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:50.159
 attention seems that trevor has located 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:52.349
 a small patrol of engineers and if 

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:54.930
 his intentions are clear pursue 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:57.060
 one of them and carbonite the ass without 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.310
 pause goes to his second enemy that 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.530
 it seems that he is also distracted like this 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.359
 who gets it burn often couple of 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:06.239

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:09.569
 tool of the hand and after 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.569
 take a little walk behind the last 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:14.489
 enemy engineer gets to fire in the 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:17.310
 soil as if from a small piece of 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:18.960
