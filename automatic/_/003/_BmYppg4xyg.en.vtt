00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
but this is going to very small easy and

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.709 
but this is going to very small easy and
silver<00:01:28.350> tongue<00:01:28.560> little<00:01:28.920> bits<00:01:29.130> on<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.719> already

00:01:30.709 --> 00:01:30.719 
silver tongue little bits on the already

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:34.730 
silver tongue little bits on the already
cut<00:01:31.049> earth<00:01:31.259> but<00:01:31.920> each<00:01:31.950> one<00:01:32.280> of<00:01:32.310> them<00:01:32.609> has<00:01:33.740> got

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
cut earth but each one of them has got

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.489 
cut earth but each one of them has got
to<00:01:35.039> be<00:01:35.149> finally<00:01:36.149> filed<00:01:36.420> so<00:01:36.749> it's<00:01:36.899> just<00:01:37.049> looks

00:01:37.489 --> 00:01:37.499 
to be finally filed so it's just looks

00:01:37.499 --> 00:01:39.590 
to be finally filed so it's just looks
nice<00:01:38.070> and<00:01:38.130> see<00:01:38.490> how<00:01:38.579> file<00:01:38.909> that<00:01:39.149> little<00:01:39.390> circle

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
nice and see how file that little circle

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.569 
nice and see how file that little circle
in<00:01:39.899> there<00:01:40.109> and<00:01:40.649> that's<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:41.009> leaf<00:01:41.189> it<00:01:41.340> isn't

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
in there and that's the leaf it isn't

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.580 
in there and that's the leaf it isn't
exactly<00:01:41.939> the<00:01:42.030> same<00:01:42.090> as<00:01:42.420> that<00:01:42.570> but<00:01:42.840> I<00:01:43.079> don't

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
exactly the same as that but I don't

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.230 
exactly the same as that but I don't
really<00:01:43.710> want<00:01:43.950> it<00:01:44.070> to<00:01:44.159> be<00:01:44.249> exactly<00:01:44.369> the<00:01:44.909> same<00:01:45.119> i

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
really want it to be exactly the same i

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.669 
really want it to be exactly the same i
can<00:01:45.390> just<00:01:45.570> cut<00:01:45.780> them<00:01:45.869> out<00:01:45.990> together<00:01:46.200> otherwise

00:01:46.669 --> 00:01:46.679 
can just cut them out together otherwise

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:49.419 
can just cut them out together otherwise
i<00:01:47.130> just<00:01:48.090> want<00:01:48.240> it<00:01:48.359> to<00:01:48.390> be<00:01:48.509> approximate<00:01:49.380> shape

00:01:49.419 --> 00:01:49.429 
i just want it to be approximate shape

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:54.529 
i just want it to be approximate shape
because<00:01:50.429> leaves<00:01:50.670> are<00:01:50.880> all<00:01:50.969> different<00:01:51.149> i<00:01:53.539> want

00:01:54.529 --> 00:01:54.539 
because leaves are all different i want

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:57.069 
because leaves are all different i want

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:51.780 
it might just be a little bit long but

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:55.380 
it might just be a little bit long but
let's<00:05:52.780> just<00:05:52.870> perfect<00:05:53.560> yeah<00:05:53.710> i<00:05:54.150> really<00:05:55.150> like

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:56.950 
that so they'll take in that much off

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:58.980 
that so they'll take in that much off
the<00:05:56.979> bottom<00:05:57.430> edge<00:05:57.580> now<00:05:57.820> and<00:05:58.660> we<00:05:58.780> shall<00:05:58.930> be

00:05:58.980 --> 00:05:58.990 
the bottom edge now and we shall be

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:06.879 
the bottom edge now and we shall be
there<00:05:59.110> with<00:05:59.410> that<00:05:59.440> one

00:06:06.879 --> 00:06:06.889 

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:11.920 

it's<00:06:07.889> probably<00:06:08.189> an<00:06:08.280> easy<00:06:08.460> way<00:06:08.639> of<00:06:08.669> doing<00:06:09.030> that

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:11.930 

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:14.209 

from<00:06:12.930> the<00:06:13.110> phone<00:06:13.349> milk<00:06:13.590> when<00:06:13.710> I<00:06:13.740> finished<00:06:14.129> it

00:06:14.209 --> 00:06:14.219 
from the phone milk when I finished it

00:06:14.219 --> 00:06:15.739 
from the phone milk when I finished it
off<00:06:14.400> the<00:06:14.610> old<00:06:14.759> is<00:06:14.939> a<00:06:14.969> very<00:06:15.210> simple<00:06:15.599> way<00:06:15.719> of

00:06:15.739 --> 00:06:15.749 
off the old is a very simple way of

00:06:15.749 --> 00:06:20.779 
off the old is a very simple way of
doing<00:06:16.110> all<00:06:16.259> them<00:06:17.810> but<00:06:18.810> in<00:06:18.900> it<00:06:19.050> nice<00:06:19.520> my<00:06:20.520> sense

00:06:20.779 --> 00:06:20.789 
doing all them but in it nice my sense

00:06:20.789 --> 00:06:23.050 
doing all them but in it nice my sense
of<00:06:20.879> achievement<00:06:21.029> when<00:06:21.509> you're<00:06:21.689> finished<00:06:22.080> I

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:23.060 
of achievement when you're finished I

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:27.529 
of achievement when you're finished I
think<00:06:24.060> that<00:06:24.300> might<00:06:24.659> be<00:06:25.999> slightly<00:06:26.999> still<00:06:27.360> too

00:06:27.529 --> 00:06:27.539 
think that might be slightly still too

00:06:27.539 --> 00:06:31.399 
think that might be slightly still too
long<00:06:27.889> just<00:06:28.889> a<00:06:29.039> fraction<00:06:29.870> with<00:06:30.870> the<00:06:30.990> frat<00:06:31.199> might

00:06:31.399 --> 00:06:31.409 
long just a fraction with the frat might

00:06:31.409 --> 00:06:38.850 
long just a fraction with the frat might
ruin<00:06:31.650> the<00:06:31.919> end

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:38.860 

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:43.409 

I<00:06:38.919> think<00:06:39.729> I'm<00:06:39.879> very<00:06:40.120> happy<00:06:40.419> with<00:06:40.539> that<00:06:40.659> one<00:06:42.419> yep

00:06:43.409 --> 00:06:43.419 
I think I'm very happy with that one yep

00:06:43.419 --> 00:06:46.350 
I think I'm very happy with that one yep
I<00:06:44.069> think<00:06:45.069> we<00:06:45.159> can<00:06:45.310> go<00:06:45.460> for<00:06:45.669> that<00:06:45.789> and<00:06:46.030> blew<00:06:46.180> that

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:46.360 
I think we can go for that and blew that

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:48.029 
I think we can go for that and blew that
one<00:06:46.479> on<00:06:46.659> i'm<00:06:46.810> quite<00:06:47.050> happy<00:06:47.169> enough<00:06:47.500> to<00:06:47.560> tell<00:06:47.830> by
