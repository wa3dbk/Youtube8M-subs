cooler<00:00:20.850> we<00:00:21.180> ran<00:00:21.359> some<00:00:21.570> new<00:00:21.720> lines<00:00:21.960> for<00:00:22.320> that

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
cooler we ran some new lines for that

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.470 
cooler we ran some new lines for that
and<00:00:23.869> got<00:00:24.869> those<00:00:25.050> made<00:00:25.260> up<00:00:25.760> we<00:00:26.760> finished<00:00:27.300> up<00:00:27.420> a

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
and got those made up we finished up a

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.349 
and got those made up we finished up a
little<00:00:27.630> bit<00:00:27.750> more<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:28.019> wiring<00:00:29.150> we've<00:00:30.150> got<00:00:30.269> our

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
little bit more the wiring we've got our

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.709 
little bit more the wiring we've got our
two<00:00:30.830> start<00:00:31.830> buttons<00:00:32.160> here<00:00:32.430> and<00:00:32.579> we<00:00:33.540> ordered

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
two start buttons here and we ordered

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.930 
two start buttons here and we ordered
the<00:00:33.930> socket<00:00:34.739> type<00:00:35.809> connections<00:00:36.950> to<00:00:37.950> go<00:00:38.760> on

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
the socket type connections to go on

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.270 
the socket type connections to go on
this<00:00:39.440> and<00:00:41.870> of<00:00:42.870> course<00:00:42.930> they<00:00:43.290> sent<00:00:43.950> me<00:00:44.070> one

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
this and of course they sent me one

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.250 
this and of course they sent me one
correct<00:00:44.700> one<00:00:44.879> and<00:00:45.030> one<00:00:45.180> was<00:00:45.390> their<00:00:45.539> own<00:00:45.690> so<00:00:46.079> for

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
correct one and one was their own so for

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.779 
correct one and one was their own so for
now<00:00:46.379> we've<00:00:46.590> just<00:00:46.620> got<00:00:46.800> it

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
now we've just got it

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.670 
now we've just got it
the<00:00:48.239> Spade<00:00:48.480> connectors<00:00:48.930> on<00:00:49.079> there<00:00:49.260> we'll

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
the Spade connectors on there we'll

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.479 
the Spade connectors on there we'll
finish<00:00:50.160> that<00:00:50.280> up<00:00:50.579> and<00:00:50.879> that<00:00:51.719> should<00:00:51.930> be<00:00:52.079> all<00:00:52.110> we

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:52.489 
finish that up and that should be all we

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:55.400 
finish that up and that should be all we
all<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.699> wiring<00:00:53.879> as<00:00:54.480> far<00:00:54.809> as<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.199> power

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
all the wiring as far as the power

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.709 
all the wiring as far as the power
distribution<00:00:55.829> goes<00:00:56.480> and<00:00:58.579> so<00:00:59.579> we're<00:01:00.480> ready<00:01:00.629> to

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
distribution goes and so we're ready to

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.990 
distribution goes and so we're ready to
put<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:01.020> cowl<00:01:01.199> in<00:01:01.410> but<00:01:01.620> we<00:01:02.100> before<00:01:02.640> we<00:01:02.670> do<00:01:02.850> that

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
put the cowl in but we before we do that

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.280 
put the cowl in but we before we do that

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
was correct and after we put pull the

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.070 
was correct and after we put pull the
motor<00:01:07.049> out<00:01:07.170> and<00:01:08.100> back<00:01:08.220> in<00:01:08.250> and<00:01:08.810> redid<00:01:09.810> all<00:01:09.900> this

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
motor out and back in and redid all this

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.840 
motor out and back in and redid all this
wiring<00:01:10.320> make<00:01:11.130> sure<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.369> car<00:01:11.549> was<00:01:11.670> going<00:01:11.790> to

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850

the right is the start button and yeah I
don't<00:01:33.030> want<00:01:33.210> anybody<00:01:33.509> to<00:01:33.600> be<00:01:33.630> hating<00:01:34.049> on<00:01:34.170> my

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
don't want anybody to be hating on my

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.289 
don't want anybody to be hating on my
fender<00:01:36.000> washer<00:01:36.119> there<00:01:36.590> that<00:01:38.030> spot<00:01:39.030> where<00:01:39.210> the

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
fender washer there that spot where the

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.200 
fender washer there that spot where the
original<00:01:39.509> ignition<00:01:40.409> goes<00:01:40.590> was<00:01:40.970> just<00:01:41.970> a<00:01:42.060> little

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
original ignition goes was just a little

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.880 
original ignition goes was just a little
bit<00:01:42.299> too<00:01:42.450> small<00:01:42.720> for<00:01:42.869> that<00:01:42.930> button<00:01:43.320> so<00:01:43.619> I

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
bit too small for that button so I

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.969 
bit too small for that button so I
drilled<00:01:44.520> out<00:01:44.610> a<00:01:44.640> fender<00:01:45.060> washer<00:01:45.750> and<00:01:45.990> made<00:01:46.860> it

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
drilled out a fender washer and made it

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:47.389 
drilled out a fender washer and made it
work

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
work

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.510 
work
so<00:01:47.549> we'll<00:01:47.670> paint<00:01:47.850> that<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.930> same<00:01:49.140> colors<00:01:49.470> the

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
so we'll paint that the same colors the

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.190 
so we'll paint that the same colors the
dash<00:01:50.520> and<00:01:50.790> hopefully<00:01:51.090> it<00:01:51.180> won't<00:01:51.299> be<00:01:51.810> that

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
dash and hopefully it won't be that

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.819 
dash and hopefully it won't be that
visible<00:01:52.740> or<00:01:52.829> noticeable<00:01:53.369> so<00:01:54.649> anyway<00:01:55.649> we'll

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
visible or noticeable so anyway we'll

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.590 
visible or noticeable so anyway we'll
show<00:01:55.979> you<00:01:56.009> these<00:01:56.640> these<00:01:57.000> buttons<00:01:57.390> actually

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
show you these these buttons actually

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.679 
show you these these buttons actually
