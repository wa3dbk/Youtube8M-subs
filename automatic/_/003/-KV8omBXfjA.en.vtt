 but also for the employees 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.840

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.770
 the practice around 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:04.260
 No matter in which job you work at bmw 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:07.680
 You will always be with a lot of process 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.600
 ask partners to work together and to 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.549
 see and success factor that you look in 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.530
 These people can empathize with theirs 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:17.340
 understanding problems and that's what it's about 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.689
 absolutely important that you just 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.830
 there is an interest in this 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.689
 to deal with problem even if you 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.390
 now not just one in 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:26.040
 work everyday life 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.869
 It is always an international environment 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.900
 where you can move by 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:34.320
 actually always new areas of expertise 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:37.070
 also get to know each other and deal with it 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:40.259
 deal because many topics also in 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.700
 different countries are relevant 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:45.329
 and not everything is running in Munich 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:47.790
 Nonetheless, it is well known 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.409
 for being German companies and 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.479
 to be a barely company and me 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.930
 bmw never believes this identity 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:56.100
 to give up 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:56.100
 rightly
