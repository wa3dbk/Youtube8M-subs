you<00:02:10.300> know<00:02:10.450> I'm<00:02:10.540> not<00:02:10.690> a<00:02:10.990> big<00:02:11.470> color<00:02:11.770> person<00:02:12.100> I

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:12.460 
you know I'm not a big color person I

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:15.150 
you know I'm not a big color person I
actually<00:02:12.670> wanted<00:02:13.180> to<00:02:13.410> try<00:02:14.410> this<00:02:14.470> color<00:02:14.950> on<00:02:15.010> the

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
actually wanted to try this color on the

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.330 
actually wanted to try this color on the
model<00:02:15.550> but<00:02:15.760> that<00:02:16.800> might<00:02:17.800> have<00:02:17.890> been<00:02:17.980> too<00:02:18.160> light

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
model but that might have been too light

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.220 
model but that might have been too light
so<00:02:18.610> how<00:02:18.970> it<00:02:19.120> with<00:02:19.240> this<00:02:19.390> one<00:02:19.570> you<00:02:20.020> know<00:02:20.080> I've

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
coloring I really just got that to wear

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:29.880 
coloring I really just got that to wear
in<00:02:28.480> a<00:02:28.510> house<00:02:28.660> or<00:02:28.900> so<00:02:29.350> throwing<00:02:29.590> where<00:02:29.740> I<00:02:29.770> have

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
in a house or so throwing where I have

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.070 
in a house or so throwing where I have
to<00:02:30.010> go<00:02:30.040> out<00:02:30.340> for<00:02:30.670> like<00:02:31.420> it's<00:02:31.630> my<00:02:31.750> hair<00:02:31.960> it's

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
to go out for like it's my hair it's

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.620 
to go out for like it's my hair it's
still<00:02:32.260> winter<00:02:32.410> not<00:02:33.100> twisted<00:02:33.490> or<00:02:33.520> something<00:02:33.940> so

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
still winter not twisted or something so

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:38.340 
still winter not twisted or something so
anyway<00:02:34.870> uh<00:02:35.310> let's<00:02:36.310> see<00:02:36.460> shedding<00:02:37.420> she

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.350 
anyway uh let's see shedding she

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:39.960 
anyway uh let's see shedding she
actually<00:02:38.500> doesn't<00:02:38.830> shed<00:02:39.160> which<00:02:39.820> is

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
actually doesn't shed which is

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:41.940 
actually doesn't shed which is
surprising<00:02:40.600> I<00:02:40.750> mean<00:02:41.110> she<00:02:41.230> says<00:02:41.470> because<00:02:41.710> I

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
surprising I mean she says because I

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.520 
surprising I mean she says because I
think<00:02:42.010> always<00:02:42.550> shed<00:02:42.880> but<00:02:43.210> I<00:02:43.450> thought<00:02:44.200> because

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
think always shed but I thought because

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.380 
think always shed but I thought because
it<00:02:44.650> was<00:02:44.770> so<00:02:44.890> long<00:02:45.130> they<00:02:45.520> don't<00:02:45.640> shed<00:02:45.940> a<00:02:45.970> lot<00:02:46.150> and

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
it was so long they don't shed a lot and

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:47.550 
it was so long they don't shed a lot and
I<00:02:46.450> actually<00:02:46.630> think<00:02:46.900> the<00:02:47.050> only<00:02:47.140> reason<00:02:47.410> why<00:02:47.530> I

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
I actually think the only reason why I

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.670 
I actually think the only reason why I
shed<00:02:47.830> it<00:02:47.920> initially<00:02:48.430> is<00:02:48.610> because<00:02:49.030> I<00:02:49.680> couldn't

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
shed it initially is because I couldn't

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.680 
shed it initially is because I couldn't
do<00:02:50.800> the<00:02:51.040> leave<00:02:51.640> out<00:02:51.850> method<00:02:52.090> you<00:02:52.360> know<00:02:52.480> how<00:02:52.630> you

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
do the leave out method you know how you

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.450 
do the leave out method you know how you
push<00:02:53.110> it<00:02:53.260> back<00:02:53.410> a<00:02:53.440> little<00:02:53.680> and<00:02:54.070> leave<00:02:54.310> a<00:02:54.340> little

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:54.460 
push it back a little and leave a little

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:56.100 
push it back a little and leave a little
your<00:02:54.730> hair<00:02:54.970> and<00:02:55.210> then<00:02:55.300> part<00:02:55.720> your<00:02:55.870> hair<00:02:55.900> and

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
your hair and then part your hair and

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.110 
your hair and then part your hair and
blend<00:02:56.320> it<00:02:56.470> I<00:02:56.620> can<00:02:57.280> do<00:02:57.400> that<00:02:57.550> because<00:02:57.640> my<00:02:57.910> hair

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
blend it I can do that because my hair

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.760 
blend it I can do that because my hair
is<00:02:58.150> so<00:02:58.420> dark<00:02:58.690> and<00:02:58.900> it<00:02:59.170> wouldn't<00:02:59.470> match<00:02:59.620> the

00:02:59.760 --> 00:02:59.770 
is so dark and it wouldn't match the

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:02.100 
is so dark and it wouldn't match the
color<00:02:59.950> of<00:03:00.010> the<00:03:00.130> wig<00:03:00.340> so<00:03:00.700> I<00:03:01.000> cut<00:03:01.840> the<00:03:01.959> lace

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
color of the wig so I cut the lace

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.230 
color of the wig so I cut the lace
really<00:03:02.470> close<00:03:02.860> so<00:03:03.370> that<00:03:03.400> they<00:03:03.580> can<00:03:03.730> lay<00:03:03.850> flat

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:04.240 
really close so that they can lay flat

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.810 
really close so that they can lay flat
and<00:03:05.080> you<00:03:05.650> know<00:03:05.770> look<00:03:06.070> a<00:03:06.280> little<00:03:06.520> bit<00:03:06.670> more

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:06.820 
and you know look a little bit more

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.160 
and you know look a little bit more
natural<00:03:07.270> so<00:03:07.630> I<00:03:07.660> think<00:03:07.720> that's<00:03:08.050> the<00:03:08.140> only

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
natural so I think that's the only

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.320 
natural so I think that's the only
reason<00:03:08.380> why<00:03:08.740> I<00:03:08.770> shed<00:03:09.190> it<00:03:09.310> officially<00:03:09.820> because

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:10.330 
reason why I shed it officially because

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:12.300 
reason why I shed it officially because
once<00:03:10.570> I<00:03:10.750> brushed<00:03:11.380> all<00:03:11.530> that<00:03:11.739> through<00:03:11.980> it<00:03:12.160> was

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
once I brushed all that through it was

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:12.810 
once I brushed all that through it was
fine

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:12.820 
fine

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:17.100 
fine
tangling<00:03:14.280> it<00:03:15.280> doesn't<00:03:15.700> tangle<00:03:15.850> too<00:03:16.270> bad<00:03:16.480> you

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.110 
tangling it doesn't tangle too bad you

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:18.870 
tangling it doesn't tangle too bad you
know<00:03:17.230> you<00:03:17.560> still<00:03:17.770> have<00:03:17.950> to<00:03:18.130> carry<00:03:18.489> a<00:03:18.640> brush

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
know you still have to carry a brush

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.580 
know you still have to carry a brush
with<00:03:19.090> you<00:03:19.209> but<00:03:19.420> I<00:03:19.600> wasn't<00:03:19.989> brushing<00:03:20.440> my<00:03:20.560> hair

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
with you but I wasn't brushing my hair

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.770 
with you but I wasn't brushing my hair

every five seconds today like normally
with<00:03:23.230> that<00:03:23.380> other<00:03:23.560> trolley<00:03:23.890> wait<00:03:24.100> I'm<00:03:24.370> like

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
with that other trolley wait I'm like

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.030 
with that other trolley wait I'm like
pumping<00:03:25.660> it<00:03:25.780> out<00:03:25.900> because<00:03:26.050> it<00:03:26.290> tangles<00:03:26.770> like

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
pumping it out because it tangles like

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.890 
pumping it out because it tangles like
nobody's<00:03:27.880> business<00:03:28.060> but<00:03:28.450> you<00:03:28.570> know<00:03:28.660> it's

hair that comes in it has it like a
little<00:03:46.750> crinkle<00:03:47.110> in<00:03:47.410> it<00:03:47.560> that's<00:03:47.950> how<00:03:48.100> this

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280

little crinkle in it that's how this
hairless<00:03:48.760> and<00:03:49.390> I<00:03:49.540> didn't<00:03:49.780> like<00:03:49.900> that<00:03:50.110> and<00:03:50.320> it

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
hairless and I didn't like that and it

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:52.380 
hairless and I didn't like that and it
looks<00:03:50.440> really<00:03:50.770> fool<00:03:51.190> like<00:03:51.520> that<00:03:51.760> but<00:03:52.120> I<00:03:52.150> didn't

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:54.210 
looks really fool like that but I didn't
like<00:03:52.510> that<00:03:52.540> so<00:03:52.930> I<00:03:52.959> just<00:03:53.230> went<00:03:53.410> in<00:03:53.650> with<00:03:53.800> my<00:03:53.980> flat

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
like that so I just went in with my flat

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:57.750 
like that so I just went in with my flat
irons<00:03:54.520> and<00:03:54.730> then<00:03:55.510> smooth<00:03:55.870> it<00:03:56.080> out<00:03:56.200> so<00:03:56.440> now<00:03:56.950> it

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
irons and then smooth it out so now it

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.990 
irons and then smooth it out so now it
has<00:03:57.970> a<00:03:58.000> silky<00:03:58.870> err<00:03:59.050> texture<00:03:59.620> but<00:04:00.459> uh<00:04:00.489> I

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
has a silky err texture but uh I

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.030 
has a silky err texture but uh I
actually<00:04:01.720> like<00:04:02.290> it<00:04:02.440> better<00:04:02.470> this<00:04:02.770> way<00:04:02.830> it

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.040 
actually like it better this way it

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.600 
actually like it better this way it
looks<00:04:03.220> smoother<00:04:03.609> now<00:04:04.390> we'll<00:04:04.660> say<00:04:04.900> what

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
looks smoother now we'll say what

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:07.370 
looks smoother now we'll say what
we<00:04:05.730> you<00:04:06.030> actually<00:04:06.480> have<00:04:06.780> to<00:04:06.960> because<00:04:07.110> I<00:04:07.200> have

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380 
we you actually have to because I have

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:10.040 
we you actually have to because I have
my<00:04:07.590> hair<00:04:08.030> not<00:04:09.030> break<00:04:09.330> it<00:04:09.450> but<00:04:09.600> I<00:04:09.660> get<00:04:09.900> two

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:10.050 
my hair not break it but I get two

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:12.260 
my hair not break it but I get two
strand<00:04:10.380> twist<00:04:10.650> but<00:04:11.160> I<00:04:11.190> did<00:04:11.400> a<00:04:11.430> lot<00:04:11.670> of<00:04:11.700> really

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:12.270 
strand twist but I did a lot of really

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:14.750 
strand twist but I did a lot of really
small<00:04:12.690> because<00:04:13.080> in<00:04:13.950> order<00:04:14.190> for<00:04:14.370> it<00:04:14.580> to<00:04:14.610> look

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 
small because in order for it to look

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.250 
small because in order for it to look
natural<00:04:15.000> I<00:04:15.330> think<00:04:15.540> you<00:04:15.630> have<00:04:15.810> to<00:04:15.960> have<00:04:16.109> your

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
natural I think you have to have your

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:17.660 
natural I think you have to have your
hair<00:04:16.530> really<00:04:16.650> flat<00:04:17.070> under<00:04:17.340> here<00:04:17.519> like

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:17.670 
hair really flat under here like

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:21.020 
hair really flat under here like
normally<00:04:18.359> I<00:04:18.390> just<00:04:18.690> do<00:04:18.900> pic<00:04:19.620> twist<00:04:20.010> put<00:04:20.640> my<00:04:20.790> cap

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
normally I just do pic twist put my cap

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:23.330 
normally I just do pic twist put my cap
on<00:04:21.239> and<00:04:21.750> it<00:04:21.870> drove<00:04:22.079> you<00:04:22.500> know<00:04:22.650> that<00:04:22.950> we<00:04:23.100> won't

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
on and it drove you know that we won't

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.030 
on and it drove you know that we won't
but<00:04:23.610> with<00:04:24.090> this<00:04:24.240> you<00:04:24.480> actually<00:04:24.720> have<00:04:24.990> to<00:04:25.410> braid

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:26.040 
but with this you actually have to braid

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.640 
but with this you actually have to braid
it<00:04:26.070> close<00:04:26.400> to<00:04:26.670> your<00:04:26.790> scalp<00:04:27.270> so<00:04:27.480> that<00:04:27.810> you<00:04:28.470> can

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 
it close to your scalp so that you can

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:30.380 
it close to your scalp so that you can
get<00:04:28.800> a<00:04:28.980> more<00:04:29.130> natural<00:04:29.520> look<00:04:29.700> the<00:04:29.730> more<00:04:30.030> flat

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:30.390 
get a more natural look the more flat

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:33.050 
get a more natural look the more flat
look<00:04:30.690> and<00:04:31.260> I<00:04:31.950> just<00:04:32.310> think<00:04:32.610> with<00:04:32.760> straight<00:04:33.030> hair

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 
look and I just think with straight hair

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.080 
look and I just think with straight hair
the<00:04:33.450> flatter<00:04:33.750> the<00:04:34.080> more<00:04:34.290> the<00:04:34.560> better<00:04:34.680> he<00:04:34.860> looks

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.090 
the flatter the more the better he looks

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:40.220 
the flatter the more the better he looks
so<00:04:36.110> what<00:04:37.110> else<00:04:37.230> about<00:04:37.470> this<00:04:37.820> I<00:04:38.820> got<00:04:39.660> this<00:04:39.840> from

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:40.230

that's a plus I actually like that

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:49.159 
that's a plus I actually like that
it<00:05:46.800> was<00:05:46.950> full<00:05:47.220> like<00:05:47.910> even<00:05:48.450> if<00:05:48.510> you<00:05:48.630> put<00:05:48.870> it<00:05:48.990> in<00:05:49.110> a

00:05:49.159 --> 00:05:49.169 
it was full like even if you put it in a

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:52.670 
it was full like even if you put it in a
ponytail<00:05:49.530> you<00:05:50.100> see<00:05:50.850> that<00:05:51.060> and<00:05:51.720> that's<00:05:52.290> rare

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:52.680 
ponytail you see that and that's rare

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:54.950 
ponytail you see that and that's rare
like<00:05:53.100> you<00:05:53.220> don't<00:05:53.400> usually<00:05:53.550> get<00:05:53.940> that<00:05:54.690> much

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:54.960 
like you don't usually get that much

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.800 
like you don't usually get that much
from<00:05:55.200> a<00:05:55.290> wig<00:05:55.500> so<00:05:55.910> yeah<00:05:56.910> I<00:05:57.150> like<00:05:57.419> that<00:05:57.450> about

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:57.810 
from a wig so yeah I like that about

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:03.590 
from a wig so yeah I like that about
this<00:05:59.570> I<00:06:00.919> think<00:06:01.919> that<00:06:02.310> that<00:06:02.700> will<00:06:02.880> be<00:06:03.030> about<00:06:03.360> any

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:03.600 
this I think that that will be about any

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:06.890 
this I think that that will be about any
value<00:06:03.960> now<00:06:04.320> you<00:06:04.620> can<00:06:04.919> move<00:06:05.190> the<00:06:05.400> part<00:06:05.700> I<00:06:05.940> put<00:06:06.750> it

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:06.900 
value now you can move the part I put it

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:08.150 
value now you can move the part I put it
over<00:06:07.020> to<00:06:07.260> the<00:06:07.350> side<00:06:07.560> although<00:06:07.770> I<00:06:07.979> actually

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:08.160 
over to the side although I actually

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:10.580 
over to the side although I actually
think<00:06:08.520> that<00:06:09.150> you<00:06:09.300> were<00:06:09.419> supposed<00:06:09.810> to<00:06:09.930> wear<00:06:10.560> it

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:10.590 
think that you were supposed to wear it

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:12.850 
think that you were supposed to wear it
like<00:06:11.520> as<00:06:11.700> a<00:06:11.729> little<00:06:12.030> part<00:06:12.300> but

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:12.860 
like as a little part but

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:14.770 
like as a little part but
this<00:06:13.220> looks<00:06:13.460> more<00:06:13.639> natural<00:06:13.789> with<00:06:14.090> me<00:06:14.240> you<00:06:14.659> know

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:14.780 
this looks more natural with me you know

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:17.080 
this looks more natural with me you know
because<00:06:15.050> I<00:06:15.169> didn't<00:06:15.440> you<00:06:15.889> know<00:06:16.039> let<00:06:16.729> any<00:06:16.970> of

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:17.090 
because I didn't you know let any of

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:18.999 
because I didn't you know let any of
them<00:06:17.210> a<00:06:17.240> little<00:06:17.479> baby<00:06:17.629> hairs<00:06:17.810> anyway<00:06:18.199> so<00:06:18.500> to<00:06:18.860> me

00:06:18.999 --> 00:06:19.009 
them a little baby hairs anyway so to me

00:06:19.009 --> 00:06:20.529 
them a little baby hairs anyway so to me
on<00:06:19.490> the<00:06:19.610> side<00:06:19.819> it<00:06:19.970> looks<00:06:20.120> a<00:06:20.150> little<00:06:20.240> bit<00:06:20.419> more

00:06:20.529 --> 00:06:20.539 
on the side it looks a little bit more

00:06:20.539 --> 00:06:21.550 
on the side it looks a little bit more
natural<00:06:20.690> just<00:06:21.080> for<00:06:21.229> me

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:21.560 
natural just for me

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:24.700 
natural just for me
and<00:06:21.830> plus<00:06:22.099> my<00:06:22.129> face<00:06:22.520> is<00:06:22.699> so<00:06:22.909> you<00:06:23.780> know<00:06:23.930> why<00:06:24.379> that

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:24.710 
and plus my face is so you know why that

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:28.719 
and plus my face is so you know why that
I<00:06:24.740> think<00:06:25.039> a<00:06:25.280> cider<00:06:25.789> part<00:06:26.270> looks<00:06:26.509> better<00:06:27.379> so<00:06:27.740> the

00:06:28.719 --> 00:06:28.729 
I think a cider part looks better so the

00:06:28.729 --> 00:06:30.939 
I think a cider part looks better so the
suspect<00:06:28.909> actually<00:06:29.720> moves<00:06:30.080> like<00:06:30.259> it<00:06:30.500> you<00:06:30.800> know

00:06:30.939 --> 00:06:30.949 
suspect actually moves like it you know

00:06:30.949 --> 00:06:33.369 
suspect actually moves like it you know
I<00:06:31.280> just<00:06:31.789> have<00:06:32.120> to<00:06:32.210> get<00:06:32.330> used<00:06:32.479> to<00:06:32.720> you<00:06:33.229> know<00:06:33.349> the

00:06:33.369 --> 00:06:33.379 
I just have to get used to you know the

00:06:33.379 --> 00:06:35.710 
I just have to get used to you know the
colors<00:06:33.889> but<00:06:34.490> for<00:06:35.000> the<00:06:35.090> warmer<00:06:35.360> months<00:06:35.539> I<00:06:35.659> think

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:35.720 
colors but for the warmer months I think

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:37.600 
colors but for the warmer months I think
it'll<00:06:36.050> actually<00:06:36.500> be<00:06:36.889> really<00:06:37.129> good<00:06:37.340> I<00:06:37.490> think

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:37.610

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:39.339 
it'll actually be really good I think
this<00:06:37.879> actually<00:06:38.210> goes<00:06:38.389> good<00:06:38.629> with<00:06:38.750> my<00:06:38.870> skin<00:06:39.169> so
