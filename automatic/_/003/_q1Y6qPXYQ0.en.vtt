00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
something new and James Spader I thought

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.139 
something new and James Spader I thought
was<00:02:03.320> just<00:02:03.500> a<00:02:03.740> brilliant<00:02:04.250> piece<00:02:04.549> of<00:02:04.579> casting

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:05.149 
was just a brilliant piece of casting

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:09.369 
was just a brilliant piece of casting
for<00:02:05.329> Ultron<00:02:05.950> you<00:02:06.950> always<00:02:07.899> you<00:02:08.899> always<00:02:09.110> hope

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:09.379 
for Ultron you always you always hope

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:11.979 
for Ultron you always you always hope
that<00:02:09.410> it<00:02:09.709> just<00:02:09.890> defies<00:02:10.220> expectation<00:02:11.090> and<00:02:11.360> then

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:11.989 
that it just defies expectation and then

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:13.570 
that it just defies expectation and then
I<00:02:12.080> guess<00:02:12.230> this<00:02:12.379> time<00:02:12.620> around<00:02:12.860> we<00:02:13.069> just<00:02:13.099> really

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
I guess this time around we just really

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:14.290 
I guess this time around we just really
wanted<00:02:13.849> people

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 
wanted people

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.210 
wanted people

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
actor relationship is so different and

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.650

wants to have authorship over things so

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:38.950 
wants to have authorship over things so
I<00:02:37.400> think<00:02:37.520> for<00:02:37.910> me<00:02:38.060> it<00:02:38.150> was<00:02:38.270> about<00:02:38.390> just<00:02:38.690> being<00:02:38.900> a

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:38.960 
I think for me it was about just being a

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:43.090 
I think for me it was about just being a
little<00:02:39.200> bit<00:02:39.320> more<00:02:39.470> receptive<00:02:40.540> and<00:02:41.540> it<00:02:42.530> makes

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.100 
little bit more receptive and it makes

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:44.590 
little bit more receptive and it makes
it<00:02:43.310> in<00:02:43.490> some<00:02:43.850> ways<00:02:43.970> just<00:02:44.120> makes<00:02:44.330> the<00:02:44.480> job

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
it in some ways just makes the job

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:45.850 
it in some ways just makes the job
easier<00:02:44.960> because<00:02:45.110> he's<00:02:45.350> kind<00:02:45.560> of<00:02:45.620> got<00:02:45.740> it

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
easier because he's kind of got it

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:53.790 
easier because he's kind of got it
figured<00:02:46.070> out

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.800 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.860
