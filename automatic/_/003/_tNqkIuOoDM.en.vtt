00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.930
 I'm close to Ision 

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:06.400
 but is that true even without us finding new ways to order 

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:10.420
 whose team is struggling with the same should have his new food at his and 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:11.599
 minerals 

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:13.419
 what they delivered 

00:00:13.419 --> 00:00:17.990
 damned to thank for those who never where he said we can 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:20.800
 Data the not easy six employees Basdorf 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.239
 I hold ship for a kilo and hands and say so 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:27.689
 and what did he do 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.759
 he offered to be quoted on Sions that is a damned useful tips only comes 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:33.980
 unfortunately very late thanks for that 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.010
 that would have saved a lot of time 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.400
 Polymetall campaign not possible 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.400
 if we build there this is more modest 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.530
 so Bierbaum the 2 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.420
 there Vettel 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.300
 Berlin will be 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.300
 with you there are times I can with the way spaces 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.640
 free music again extremely loud 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:02.290
 so would have 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.410
 go on 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:07.010
 the 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.180
 so here I want to see if he is not ready for Arabs 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.250
 This should not be the case of marine mammals 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.650
 Destroy opponents 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:18.780
 we trust Schumacher 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:24.620
 let's describe the fact that it does not help child stars for laymen 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:27.260
 let it return the beans to spite of it 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.930
 Barclaycard Queen has and full 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:31.600
 the trap lured it said 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.000
 slows down even with the shortest path 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.400
 Failure of the attack makes more sense if the protoss understood more 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.410
 wanted to have 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:43.970
 they're damn fast going around and then they are 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.970
 even faster and can be an important markets 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.110
 a precise schedule 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:52.890
 No Templar Foundation 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.700
 Kempner Archive 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.000
 Point 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.170
 a very nice building is changing that's the post office again 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:00.390
 vegetable fields 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.940
 I do not like that, for example, Merkel is not fit but that is 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:05.990
 not just a nice building 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.789
 the barracks Mancuso 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.249
 Hemer 

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:12.509
 who build a bit of allofs 

00:02:12.509 --> 00:02:16.729
 No. SZ show me an attack men 

00:02:18.189 --> 00:02:21.069
 Lehner not used 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:24.529
 what he was made him in Caputh and idiot 

00:02:24.529 --> 00:02:27.529
 m Kassel dapd-hes corporation and the forces 

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:33.489
 okay i did not really see much the team then fast but he can 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:36.859
 was dead 

00:02:36.859 --> 00:02:39.859
 to be spoken 

00:02:40.469 --> 00:02:43.219
 OMV OMV could 

00:02:43.219 --> 00:02:44.519
 Bum Bum Bum Bum 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:49.199
 stupid that the MAZ me strangely moment may submit because of this 

00:02:49.839 --> 00:02:53.259
 that contradicts the beautiful duckling I have three children 

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:57.699
 I never like action and ex-trainer 

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:59.529
 Child has no meaning McClaren 

00:02:59.529 --> 00:03:02.529
 It was not going on the gas until now 

00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:07.679
 but that is different 

00:03:07.679 --> 00:03:10.549
 Ad brought out Jean Reno 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:13.549
 eat 

00:03:14.499 --> 00:03:18.769
 but we have you can mean that we do not turn into the smithy 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:20.669
 after others 

00:03:20.669 --> 00:03:24.119
 a train so far can believe 19 

00:03:24.779 --> 00:03:28.260
 I do not think we can do with Strasser that energy 

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:30.629
 Always have to use military service 

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:33.999
 so he had to be a scout 

00:03:33.999 --> 00:03:36.999
 Kjaer strange way at least five proclaimed 

00:03:38.119 --> 00:03:40.599
 So let's see what you encounter so everything 

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:45.489
 So she is but table mafioso the internists we have already seen what 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:48.489
 after that I think you can have us so far neck and jaw 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:51.439
 Euro 

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:52.869
 and the 4 

00:03:52.869 --> 00:03:54.499
 6 

00:03:54.499 --> 00:03:57.619
 that is the radar we hope that I have no further points 

00:03:59.889 --> 00:04:06.619
 including the products of pure skiing fun that the orchestra whether mailbox 

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:11.199
 family 

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:14.620
 read a lot of books that screams for an attack One on me under 

00:04:14.619 --> 00:04:17.619
 to come through later 

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:25.699
 why a Templar first they are Lyon of course, that could 

00:04:26.689 --> 00:04:28.639
 was 

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:30.379
 with 2 9 million 

00:04:30.379 --> 00:04:33.419
 it is a new lead 

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:37.919
 most diverse thread 27 I do not know why looks kind of good 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:41.020
 to China 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:44.219
 the Templars are being built, that's good 

00:04:44.219 --> 00:04:47.370
 that has to look powerless 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:50.410
 who own home Limited 200 because they said Â«I cleaned 

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:54.809
 and most blizzard games it is sometimes a single hundred 

00:04:54.809 --> 00:04:56.409
 Finger snapping clogged 

00:04:56.409 --> 00:04:59.919
 nationwide, which then we go now in our company 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:04.020
 that's sausage holding that terror up in the air 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:08.069
 enter the US 

00:05:08.069 --> 00:05:09.249
 St 

00:05:09.249 --> 00:05:10.499
 she understands 

00:05:10.499 --> 00:05:12.759
 Steiner not anymore 

00:05:12.759 --> 00:05:15.759
 they are not yet all flights and trains 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.360
 here it is usually missing, the pianists stewed 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:26.120
 We are now with almost 1000 first 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:28.229
 to do some action 

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:29.839
 Speaking of course 

00:05:29.839 --> 00:05:32.159
 Merck can do it here alone 

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:33.379
 Marquardt 

00:05:33.379 --> 00:05:34.770
 man not 

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:37.839
 Sony is still that's good 

00:05:37.839 --> 00:05:40.900
 she sits a little bit on view 

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:42.949
 to run with it 

00:05:42.949 --> 00:05:47.720
 he can not be charmed to tell Tom Ryser what else to save 

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:52.879
 TomTom came to Kassandra's Horses and a 

00:05:52.879 --> 00:05:56.309
 his shame or even because of the minimal space requirement 

00:05:56.309 --> 00:05:59.150
 Hero of course not so screen here no 

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:00.580
 his arsenal 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:03.580
 Aurich this and the things long it said there 

00:06:04.159 --> 00:06:07.159
 So we need new dragoons 

00:06:07.789 --> 00:06:10.110
 that's all around 

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:12.449
 if I have a little fun 

00:06:12.449 --> 00:06:15.449
 Defenseless, Leinen said it sounded 

00:06:18.129 --> 00:06:22.369
 The sued many took part in the attack on the man is over rescue 

00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:26.880
 Did you ever take it I have 

00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:32.739
 fits in what happens in the starting quarter again affirmed high 

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:36.240
 Euro and that are already the next 

00:06:38.809 --> 00:06:41.809
 Bernd Schneider 

00:06:43.369 --> 00:06:46.369
 here on the Main 

00:06:47.289 --> 00:06:51.229
 prophetically to be a persecutor, to be dead 

00:06:52.289 --> 00:06:54.189
 Parasites shipped 

00:06:54.189 --> 00:06:57.340
 From here you have parasites, they are directly in the bread sausage 

00:06:57.339 --> 00:06:58.979
 included is dead 

00:06:58.979 --> 00:07:02.249
 I know that he happened to our heroes 

00:07:02.249 --> 00:07:04.319
 works as a consolation 

00:07:04.319 --> 00:07:07.369
 it could of course be the subject that bothers us and that's exactly what works 

00:07:07.369 --> 00:07:10.369
 do what I was looking for 

00:07:14.069 --> 00:07:17.069
 the agency for the extra energy for the Templars rashly 

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:25.110
 they break him again a convertible so the taboo subject though that would have 

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:28.110
 we like the minerals percent anyway that's his first 

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:32.569
 in Munich I know that you come with the other fighter 

00:07:33.619 --> 00:07:36.969
 the water was generally open
