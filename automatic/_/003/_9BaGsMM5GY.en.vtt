hey<00:00:00.780> what's<00:00:00.960> up<00:00:01.050> guys<00:00:01.260> it's<00:00:01.620> sores<00:00:02.370> today

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:02.550 
hey what's up guys it's sores today

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:04.220 
hey what's up guys it's sores today
we're<00:00:02.669> going<00:00:02.760> to<00:00:02.850> be<00:00:02.909> taking<00:00:03.240> a<00:00:03.360> very<00:00:03.659> brief

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:04.230 
we're going to be taking a very brief

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.039 
we're going to be taking a very brief
look<00:00:04.560> at<00:00:04.850> polygon<00:00:05.850> modeling<00:00:06.240> or<00:00:06.390> box<00:00:06.600> modeling

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
look at polygon modeling or box modeling

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.640 
look at polygon modeling or box modeling
in<00:00:07.259> 3ds<00:00:07.649> max<00:00:08.660> so<00:00:09.660> first<00:00:10.050> we'll<00:00:10.260> go<00:00:10.349> into<00:00:10.469> our

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
in 3ds max so first we'll go into our

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.610 
in 3ds max so first we'll go into our
create<00:00:10.920> panel<00:00:12.170> geometry<00:00:13.170> and<00:00:13.320> standard

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
create panel geometry and standard

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.109 
create panel geometry and standard
primitives<00:00:14.450> we'll<00:00:15.450> create<00:00:15.630> a<00:00:15.719> box<00:00:16.910> I'm<00:00:17.910> going

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
primitives we'll create a box I'm going

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:19.840 
primitives we'll create a box I'm going
to<00:00:18.210> do<00:00:18.300> a<00:00:18.330> keyboard<00:00:18.720> entry<00:00:18.900> for<00:00:19.170> this<00:00:19.230> box<00:00:19.500> and

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:19.850 
to do a keyboard entry for this box and

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:23.450 
to do a keyboard entry for this box and
XY<00:00:20.850> and<00:00:21.029> Z<00:00:21.240> will<00:00:22.109> be<00:00:22.289> 0<00:00:22.560> and<00:00:22.769> we'll<00:00:23.160> give<00:00:23.340> it<00:00:23.369> a

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
XY and Z will be 0 and we'll give it a

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.609 
XY and Z will be 0 and we'll give it a
length<00:00:23.760> width<00:00:24.090> and<00:00:24.119> height<00:00:24.300> of<00:00:25.260> 10<00:00:27.349> so<00:00:28.349> click

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
length width and height of 10 so click

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.770 
length width and height of 10 so click
create<00:00:28.650> and<00:00:30.560> that<00:00:31.560> is<00:00:31.800> one<00:00:32.300> god-awful<00:00:33.300> color

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
create and that is one god-awful color

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:40.720 
create and that is one god-awful color
so<00:00:34.200> let's<00:00:34.469> give<00:00:34.710> it<00:00:34.739> a<00:00:35.690> let's<00:00:36.690> say<00:00:37.610> light<00:00:38.610> blue

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:40.730 
so let's give it a let's say light blue

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.400 
so let's give it a let's say light blue
so<00:00:41.730> now<00:00:41.879> I'm<00:00:42.030> going<00:00:42.239> to<00:00:42.329> immediately<00:00:42.719> right

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
so now I'm going to immediately right

how I'm doing this is I go down to the

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.200 
how I'm doing this is I go down to the

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
over to sub object mode so if I already

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.980 
over to sub object mode so if I already
choose<00:01:34.590> just<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:34.950> default<00:01:35.189> orbit<00:01:35.869> then<00:01:36.869> our

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
choose just the default orbit then our

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.289 
choose just the default orbit then our
start<00:01:37.320> moving<00:01:37.590> around<00:01:37.850> you<00:01:38.850> guys<00:01:38.970> see<00:01:39.150> this

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
start moving around you guys see this

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:40.969 
start moving around you guys see this
going<00:01:39.570> all<00:01:39.659> over<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:39.930> place<00:01:40.229> I'm<00:01:40.500> not<00:01:40.560> really

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
going all over the place I'm not really

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.520 
going all over the place I'm not really
focused<00:01:41.250> on<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.759> box<00:01:41.970> which<00:01:42.960> isn't<00:01:43.170> good<00:01:43.409> for

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
focused on the box which isn't good for

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.440 
focused on the box which isn't good for
modeling<00:01:43.920> but<00:01:44.460> if<00:01:44.549> I<00:01:44.610> change<00:01:44.850> it<00:01:45.000> to<00:01:45.030> the<00:01:45.210> third

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
modeling but if I change it to the third

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.330 
modeling but if I change it to the third
or<00:01:45.630> very<00:01:45.780> bottom<00:01:46.079> one<00:01:46.170> orbit<00:01:46.680> is<00:01:46.799> sub-object

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
or very bottom one orbit is sub-object

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.359 
or very bottom one orbit is sub-object
mode<00:01:47.720> we<00:01:48.720> start<00:01:48.990> to<00:01:49.110> see<00:01:49.320> that<00:01:49.829> I<00:01:49.920> orbit

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
mode we start to see that I orbit

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.460 
mode we start to see that I orbit
directly<00:01:50.790> around<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.600> sub<00:01:51.810> object<00:01:51.990> or

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
vertice that I have selected so that's

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.480 
vertice that I have selected so that's
just<00:01:54.780> a<00:01:54.930> good<00:01:55.079> hint<00:01:55.259> and<00:01:55.530> how<00:01:55.860> I'm<00:01:55.979> orbiting<00:01:56.340> is

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
just a good hint and how I'm orbiting is

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.450 
just a good hint and how I'm orbiting is
I'm<00:01:57.060> holding<00:01:57.240> alt<00:01:57.540> and<00:01:57.869> I'm<00:01:58.649> clicking<00:01:58.950> down<00:01:59.280> on

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
control off in middle Mouse and then you

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.900 
control off in middle Mouse and then you
drag<00:02:08.310> up<00:02:08.459> and<00:02:08.550> down<00:02:08.670> and<00:02:09.560> then<00:02:10.560> just<00:02:11.550> regular

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
drag up and down and then just regular

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.140 
drag up and down and then just regular

we'll<00:02:13.450> pan<00:02:14.280> okay<00:02:15.280> so<00:02:15.909> now<00:02:16.000> let's<00:02:16.180> get<00:02:16.269> going

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
we'll pan okay so now let's get going

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.720 
we'll pan okay so now let's get going
first<00:02:17.500> we're<00:02:17.680> going<00:02:17.769> to<00:02:17.860> talk<00:02:17.980> about<00:02:18.010> vertex

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
first we're going to talk about vertex

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:20.520 
first we're going to talk about vertex
sub-object<00:02:18.940> mode<00:02:19.480> and<00:02:19.690> vertex<00:02:20.319> sub-object

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
sub-object mode and vertex sub-object

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.339 
sub-object mode and vertex sub-object
mode<00:02:21.010> you<00:02:21.129> can<00:02:21.340> select<00:02:21.519> the<00:02:21.730> points<00:02:22.349> that

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:23.349 
mode you can select the points that

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:26.699 
mode you can select the points that
connect<00:02:23.709> to<00:02:24.040> make<00:02:24.340> the<00:02:24.459> faces<00:02:24.849> and<00:02:25.090> edges<00:02:25.709> so

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
connect to make the faces and edges so

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:29.149 
connect to make the faces and edges so
I'm<00:02:26.769> going<00:02:27.099> to<00:02:27.159> hit<00:02:27.370> W<00:02:27.790> for<00:02:28.150> my<00:02:28.269> move<00:02:28.450> tool<00:02:28.659> and

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:29.159 
I'm going to hit W for my move tool and

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:31.410 
I'm going to hit W for my move tool and
we'll<00:02:30.159> just<00:02:30.250> move<00:02:30.430> the<00:02:30.579> gizmo<00:02:30.879> around<00:02:31.150> and<00:02:31.360> we

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
we'll just move the gizmo around and we

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.149 
we'll just move the gizmo around and we
can<00:02:31.540> see<00:02:31.720> that's<00:02:31.930> already<00:02:32.230> starting<00:02:32.799> to<00:02:32.920> shape

00:02:33.149 --> 00:02:33.159 
can see that's already starting to shape

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:36.500 
can see that's already starting to shape
our<00:02:33.400> box<00:02:33.989> now<00:02:34.989> for<00:02:35.260> edge<00:02:35.409> sub-object<00:02:35.680> mode

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
our box now for edge sub-object mode

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.940 
our box now for edge sub-object mode
first<00:02:37.510> we're<00:02:37.870> just<00:02:38.019> going<00:02:38.170> to<00:02:38.230> grab<00:02:38.500> two<00:02:38.530> edges

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
first we're just going to grab two edges

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.819 
first we're just going to grab two edges
by<00:02:39.099> ctrl-clicking<00:02:39.489> on<00:02:39.849> both<00:02:40.000> of<00:02:40.180> them<00:02:40.329> and

by ctrl-clicking on both of them and

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:43.949 
by ctrl-clicking on both of them and
then<00:02:41.829> we'll<00:02:42.010> drag<00:02:42.220> our<00:02:42.400> gizmo<00:02:42.730> around<00:02:43.030> and<00:02:43.299> we

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
then we'll drag our gizmo around and we

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:45.839 
then we'll drag our gizmo around and we
can<00:02:44.079> see<00:02:44.230> what's<00:02:44.409> happening<00:02:44.709> there<00:02:44.860> let<00:02:45.700> you

00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:45.849 
can see what's happening there let you

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:49.860 
can see what's happening there let you
select<00:02:46.120> one<00:02:46.440> drag<00:02:47.440> it<00:02:47.560> up<00:02:48.390> hit<00:02:49.390> ctrl<00:02:49.690> z<00:02:49.840> a

select one drag it up hit ctrl z a
couple<00:02:50.079> times<00:02:50.260> to<00:02:50.410> undo<00:02:50.760> okay<00:02:52.500> now<00:02:53.500> we'll<00:02:53.650> go

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:53.769 
couple times to undo okay now we'll go

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:57.839 
couple times to undo okay now we'll go
into<00:02:53.890> polygon<00:02:54.430> sub-object<00:02:54.670> mode<00:02:55.180> and<00:02:56.849> we'll

00:02:57.839 --> 00:02:57.849 
into polygon sub-object mode and we'll

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:00.780 
into polygon sub-object mode and we'll
grab<00:02:58.420> one<00:02:58.569> of<00:02:58.599> these<00:02:58.690> polygons<00:02:59.790> efj

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
grab one of these polygons efj

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.539 
grab one of these polygons efj
rotational<00:03:01.299> can<00:03:01.659> rotate<00:03:01.870> them<00:03:02.400> keep<00:03:03.400> this

00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:03.549 
rotational can rotate them keep this

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:10.789 
rotational can rotate them keep this
with<00:03:03.790> edges<00:03:04.150> as<00:03:04.269> well<00:03:05.879> you<00:03:06.879> can<00:03:07.090> scale<00:03:07.510> R<00:03:08.790> and

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799 
with edges as well you can scale R and

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:18.120 
with edges as well you can scale R and

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130 
of course W for move and say if I were

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.940 
of course W for move and say if I were
to<00:03:18.250> delete<00:03:18.519> the<00:03:19.120> top<00:03:19.329> polygon<00:03:19.810> so<00:03:20.590> let's<00:03:20.799> just

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
to delete the top polygon so let's just

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:22.860 
to delete the top polygon so let's just
click<00:03:21.099> on<00:03:21.280> it<00:03:21.430> and<00:03:21.579> hit<00:03:21.790> the<00:03:21.819> Delete<00:03:22.180> key<00:03:22.209> now

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
click on it and hit the Delete key now

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.559 
click on it and hit the Delete key now
go<00:03:23.109> into<00:03:23.230> border<00:03:23.680> sub-object<00:03:24.280> mode<00:03:24.480> what<00:03:25.480> we

00:03:25.559 --> 00:03:25.569 
go into border sub-object mode what we

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:27.629 
go into border sub-object mode what we
can<00:03:25.690> do<00:03:25.840> is<00:03:26.019> select<00:03:26.680> the<00:03:26.950> holes<00:03:27.190> or<00:03:27.579> the

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:27.639 
can do is select the holes or the

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:30.539 
can do is select the holes or the
borders<00:03:28.209> and<00:03:28.450> the<00:03:28.690> mesh<00:03:29.099> so<00:03:30.099> now<00:03:30.220> I<00:03:30.250> have<00:03:30.459> this

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:30.549 
borders and the mesh so now I have this

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:32.759 
borders and the mesh so now I have this
hole<00:03:30.730> in<00:03:30.819> the<00:03:30.910> mesh<00:03:31.090> and<00:03:31.359> say<00:03:32.139> I<00:03:32.169> can't<00:03:32.500> redo

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:32.769 
hole in the mesh and say I can't redo

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:35.099 
hole in the mesh and say I can't redo
for<00:03:32.950> some<00:03:33.129> odd<00:03:33.250> reason<00:03:33.510> so<00:03:34.510> we<00:03:34.690> can<00:03:34.810> do<00:03:34.870> this<00:03:34.959> we

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:35.109 
for some odd reason so we can do this we

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:38.400 
for some odd reason so we can do this we
can<00:03:35.139> select<00:03:35.620> border<00:03:36.629> then<00:03:37.629> we'll<00:03:37.840> find<00:03:38.109> our

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
can select border then we'll find our

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:42.449 
can select border then we'll find our
Edit<00:03:38.680> border<00:03:38.950> stack<00:03:39.280> and<00:03:40.349> we'll<00:03:41.349> click<00:03:41.620> cap<00:03:41.859> so

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:42.459 
Edit border stack and we'll click cap so

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:46.020 
Edit border stack and we'll click cap so
now<00:03:42.609> that<00:03:43.030> holds<00:03:43.299> caps<00:03:43.919> okay<00:03:44.919> next<00:03:45.760> we're

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
now that holds caps okay next we're

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:47.819 
now that holds caps okay next we're
about<00:03:46.150> to<00:03:46.299> go<00:03:46.419> over<00:03:46.599> some<00:03:46.780> basic<00:03:46.810> commands<00:03:47.590> for

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:47.829 
about to go over some basic commands for

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:49.770 
about to go over some basic commands for
polygon<00:03:48.250> sub-object<00:03:48.489> mode<00:03:49.000> so<00:03:49.510> let's<00:03:49.569> go

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780 
polygon sub-object mode so let's go

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:54.030

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:12.360 
see the edges that connect our mesh
together<00:04:10.299> so<00:04:11.230> let's<00:04:11.470> say<00:04:11.620> I<00:04:11.650> select<00:04:11.799> the<00:04:12.220> top

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:12.370 
together so let's say I select the top

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:16.740 
together so let's say I select the top
polygon<00:04:12.790> and<00:04:14.069> we'll<00:04:15.069> extrude<00:04:15.370> it<00:04:15.750> pay

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750 
polygon and we'll extrude it pay

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:18.750 
polygon and we'll extrude it pay
attention<00:04:17.079> to<00:04:17.139> the<00:04:17.229> Front's<00:04:17.680> as<00:04:17.829> well<00:04:18.579> as<00:04:18.669> the

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:18.760 
attention to the Front's as well as the

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.930 
attention to the Front's as well as the
perspective<00:04:19.299> viewport

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
perspective viewport

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.980 
perspective viewport
and<00:04:21.450> I'll<00:04:22.170> hit<00:04:22.440> extrude<00:04:22.770> and<00:04:23.690> I'll<00:04:24.690> click<00:04:24.900> on

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
and I'll hit extrude and I'll click on

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.700 
and I'll hit extrude and I'll click on
this<00:04:25.140> polygon<00:04:25.500> drag<00:04:25.890> up<00:04:26.040> so<00:04:27.140> like<00:04:28.140> scaling<00:04:28.620> it

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
this polygon drag up so like scaling it

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:30.440 
this polygon drag up so like scaling it
is<00:04:28.830> getting<00:04:29.160> taller<00:04:29.370> and<00:04:29.640> I<00:04:30.210> don't<00:04:30.330> like

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:30.450 
is getting taller and I don't like

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:32.570 
is getting taller and I don't like
scaling<00:04:30.750> now<00:04:31.530> we<00:04:31.590> have<00:04:31.830> the<00:04:31.980> segments<00:04:32.430> in<00:04:32.490> the

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
scaling now we have the segments in the

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:35.690 
scaling now we have the segments in the
middle<00:04:32.820> so<00:04:33.000> if<00:04:33.090> I<00:04:33.180> do<00:04:33.300> on<00:04:33.420> the<00:04:33.510> edge<00:04:33.660> mode<00:04:33.960> I<00:04:34.700> can

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:35.700 
middle so if I do on the edge mode I can

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:39.620 
middle so if I do on the edge mode I can
at<00:04:35.880> W<00:04:36.270> and<00:04:37.430> we<00:04:38.430> can<00:04:38.550> drag<00:04:38.670> this<00:04:38.790> out<00:04:38.940> so<00:04:39.210> with

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:39.630 
at W and we can drag this out so with

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:41.300 
at W and we can drag this out so with
scale<00:04:39.930> I<00:04:40.200> won't<00:04:40.410> be<00:04:40.500> able<00:04:40.590> to<00:04:40.710> do<00:04:40.800> that<00:04:40.980> because

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.310 
scale I won't be able to do that because

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:42.980 
scale I won't be able to do that because
I'm<00:04:41.610> not<00:04:41.640> creating<00:04:42.240> an<00:04:42.300> extra<00:04:42.540> segment<00:04:42.720> in

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 
I'm not creating an extra segment in

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:45.140 
I'm not creating an extra segment in
between<00:04:43.320> but<00:04:44.190> with<00:04:44.340> extrude<00:04:44.610> I<00:04:44.730> am<00:04:44.850> so<00:04:45.030> that's

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150 
between but with extrude I am so that's

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.930 
between but with extrude I am so that's
it<00:04:45.270> control<00:04:45.570> Z<00:04:45.690> a<00:04:45.720> couple<00:04:45.990> times<00:04:46.430> and<00:04:47.430> now<00:04:47.730> for

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
it control Z a couple times and now for

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.930 
it control Z a couple times and now for
bevel<00:04:48.680> so<00:04:49.680> go<00:04:49.830> back<00:04:49.950> into<00:04:50.130> polygon<00:04:50.640> sub-object

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:50.940 
bevel so go back into polygon sub-object

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:57.260 
bevel so go back into polygon sub-object
mode<00:04:51.450> and<00:04:52.130> oh<00:04:55.490> we<00:04:56.490> can<00:04:56.640> click<00:04:56.760> on<00:04:56.910> the<00:04:56.970> polygon

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:57.270 
mode and oh we can click on the polygon

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:01.190 
mode and oh we can click on the polygon
drag<00:04:57.690> up<00:04:57.870> and<00:04:58.080> then<00:04:58.650> in<00:04:59.750> create<00:05:00.750> kind<00:05:00.990> of<00:05:01.080> like

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:01.200 
drag up and then in create kind of like

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:04.100 
drag up and then in create kind of like
a<00:05:01.230> slanted<00:05:02.010> roof<00:05:02.220> or<00:05:02.400> hit<00:05:03.120> ctrl<00:05:03.480> Z<00:05:03.630> once<00:05:03.840> and

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.110 
a slanted roof or hit ctrl Z once and

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:07.760 
a slanted roof or hit ctrl Z once and
then<00:05:04.980> we<00:05:05.160> can<00:05:05.330> click<00:05:06.330> on<00:05:06.480> it<00:05:06.540> drag<00:05:07.080> down<00:05:07.410> and

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:07.770 
then we can click on it drag down and

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:10.910 
then we can click on it drag down and
down<00:05:08.760> again<00:05:09.060> now<00:05:09.270> we<00:05:10.170> create<00:05:10.350> this<00:05:10.500> inside

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:10.920 
down again now we create this inside

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:12.470 
down again now we create this inside
portion<00:05:11.310> to<00:05:11.550> our<00:05:11.580> mesh<00:05:11.850> kind<00:05:12.210> of<00:05:12.330> like<00:05:12.450> a

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:12.480 
portion to our mesh kind of like a

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:15.080 
portion to our mesh kind of like a
really<00:05:12.780> cheesy<00:05:13.050> looking<00:05:13.440> bowl<00:05:13.860> let's<00:05:14.610> undo<00:05:15.060> a

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:15.090 
really cheesy looking bowl let's undo a

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:15.770 
really cheesy looking bowl let's undo a
couple<00:05:15.180> times

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:15.780 
couple times

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:19.340 
couple times
that's<00:05:16.350> ctrl<00:05:16.800> Z<00:05:17.300> now<00:05:18.300> say<00:05:18.540> I<00:05:18.600> want<00:05:18.780> to<00:05:18.810> extrude

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:19.350 
that's ctrl Z now say I want to extrude

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:22.100 
that's ctrl Z now say I want to extrude
any<00:05:19.680> given<00:05:20.100> polygon<00:05:20.520> a<00:05:20.550> very<00:05:20.850> exact<00:05:21.180> amount<00:05:21.480> we

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:22.110 
any given polygon a very exact amount we

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:22.670 
any given polygon a very exact amount we
can<00:05:22.260> do<00:05:22.350> that

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:22.680 
can do that

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.220 
can do that
so<00:05:22.800> what's<00:05:23.220> click<00:05:23.430> on<00:05:23.580> the<00:05:24.090> Settings<00:05:24.450> box<00:05:24.660> next

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:25.230 
so what's click on the Settings box next

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:27.800 
so what's click on the Settings box next
to<00:05:25.260> extrude<00:05:25.700> now<00:05:26.700> I<00:05:26.730> can<00:05:26.940> set<00:05:27.120> the<00:05:27.240> extrusion

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:27.810 
to extrude now I can set the extrusion

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:30.800 
to extrude now I can set the extrusion
height<00:05:27.840> to<00:05:28.230> exactly<00:05:28.650> ten<00:05:29.450> one<00:05:30.450> thing<00:05:30.630> that's

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:30.810 
height to exactly ten one thing that's

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:32.510 
height to exactly ten one thing that's
also<00:05:30.960> cool<00:05:31.260> about<00:05:31.440> the<00:05:31.770> extrude<00:05:32.040> settings<00:05:32.190> is

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:32.520 
also cool about the extrude settings is

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.430 
also cool about the extrude settings is
that<00:05:32.790> we<00:05:32.880> can<00:05:33.000> extrude<00:05:33.300> multiple<00:05:33.810> polygons<00:05:34.230> at

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:34.440 
that we can extrude multiple polygons at

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.650 
that we can extrude multiple polygons at
the<00:05:34.530> same<00:05:34.740> time<00:05:34.950> in<00:05:35.190> different<00:05:35.400> ways<00:05:35.730> so<00:05:36.480> we're

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:36.660 
the same time in different ways so we're

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:38.300 
the same time in different ways so we're
going<00:05:36.750> to<00:05:36.810> select<00:05:37.110> two<00:05:37.230> polygons<00:05:37.710> just<00:05:38.130> by

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:38.310 
going to select two polygons just by

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:41.510 
going to select two polygons just by
ctrl-clicking<00:05:39.919> and<00:05:40.919> go<00:05:41.070> back<00:05:41.220> into<00:05:41.370> our

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:41.520 
ctrl-clicking and go back into our

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:43.670 
ctrl-clicking and go back into our
street<00:05:41.790> settings<00:05:42.120> we<00:05:43.080> have<00:05:43.110> the<00:05:43.290> extrusion

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:43.680 
street settings we have the extrusion

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.760 
street settings we have the extrusion
types<00:05:44.070> so<00:05:44.940> this<00:05:45.210> is<00:05:45.390> group<00:05:45.660> ifs<00:05:46.380> choose<00:05:46.650> them

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:46.770 
types so this is group ifs choose them

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:50.630 
types so this is group ifs choose them
as<00:05:46.890> a<00:05:46.919> group<00:05:48.020> local<00:05:49.020> normal<00:05:49.380> kind<00:05:50.310> of<00:05:50.370> like<00:05:50.520> an

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:50.640 
as a group local normal kind of like an

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:53.300 
as a group local normal kind of like an
average<00:05:50.850> between<00:05:51.240> by<00:05:51.570> polygons<00:05:52.080> and<00:05:52.310> group

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:53.310 
average between by polygons and group

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:56.810 
average between by polygons and group
and<00:05:54.590> there's<00:05:55.590> of<00:05:55.740> course<00:05:55.770> by<00:05:56.130> polygon<00:05:56.490> which

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:56.820 
and there's of course by polygon which

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:58.970 
and there's of course by polygon which
is<00:05:56.850> as<00:05:57.090> if<00:05:57.270> you<00:05:57.450> extrude<00:05:57.810> them<00:05:57.990> separately<00:05:58.500> the

00:05:58.970 --> 00:05:58.980 
is as if you extrude them separately the

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:00.950 
is as if you extrude them separately the
same<00:05:59.190> amounts<00:05:59.610> but<00:06:00.180> it<00:06:00.300> just<00:06:00.419> saves<00:06:00.630> time<00:06:00.840> to

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:00.960 
same amounts but it just saves time to

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:03.530 
same amounts but it just saves time to
do<00:06:01.050> it<00:06:01.140> this<00:06:01.230> way<00:06:01.910> now<00:06:02.910> I'll<00:06:03.030> talk<00:06:03.150> about<00:06:03.210> the

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:03.540 
do it this way now I'll talk about the

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:06.140 
do it this way now I'll talk about the
bevel<00:06:03.840> settings<00:06:04.830> box<00:06:05.070> so<00:06:05.850> we'll<00:06:05.940> go<00:06:06.060> into

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:06.150 
bevel settings box so we'll go into

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:13.120 
bevel settings box so we'll go into
bevel<00:06:06.450> and<00:06:07.760> we'll<00:06:08.760> extrude<00:06:09.120> it<00:06:09.210> outwards<00:06:09.720> and

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:13.130 

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:15.980 

we'll<00:06:14.130> give<00:06:14.340> it<00:06:14.460> a<00:06:14.580> negative<00:06:15.210> amounts<00:06:15.780> for<00:06:15.900> the

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:15.990 
we'll give it a negative amounts for the

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:17.850 
we'll give it a negative amounts for the
outline

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:17.860 
outline

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:22.089 
outline
and<00:06:18.999> we'll<00:06:19.999> just<00:06:20.210> look<00:06:20.389> at<00:06:20.509> our<00:06:20.719> options<00:06:21.529> for

00:06:22.089 --> 00:06:22.099 
and we'll just look at our options for

00:06:22.099 --> 00:06:27.279 
and we'll just look at our options for
bubble<00:06:22.699> type<00:06:22.819> again<00:06:23.089> so<00:06:24.020> by<00:06:24.319> group<00:06:25.039> as<00:06:25.959> a<00:06:26.959> local

00:06:27.279 --> 00:06:27.289 
bubble type again so by group as a local

00:06:27.289 --> 00:06:32.829 
bubble type again so by group as a local
normal<00:06:27.589> or<00:06:28.039> by<00:06:28.669> polygon<00:06:29.770> okay<00:06:31.719> next<00:06:32.719> let's

00:06:32.829 --> 00:06:32.839 
normal or by polygon okay next let's

00:06:32.839 --> 00:06:35.499 
normal or by polygon okay next let's
talk<00:06:32.959> about<00:06:33.020> inset<00:06:34.029> inset<00:06:35.029> we<00:06:35.179> select<00:06:35.419> a

00:06:35.499 --> 00:06:35.509 
talk about inset inset we select a

00:06:35.509 --> 00:06:37.540 
talk about inset inset we select a
polygon<00:06:35.800> and<00:06:36.800> click<00:06:36.979> and<00:06:37.099> drag<00:06:37.159> and<00:06:37.520> it

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:37.550 
polygon and click and drag and it

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:42.899 
polygon and click and drag and it
creates<00:06:37.969> an<00:06:38.240> inset<00:06:39.069> so<00:06:40.069> we<00:06:40.159> can<00:06:40.279> extrude<00:06:40.580> that

00:06:42.899 --> 00:06:42.909 

00:06:42.909 --> 00:06:52.559 

or<00:06:46.330> we<00:06:47.330> can<00:06:48.699> create<00:06:49.699> an<00:06:49.819> in<00:06:49.909> sets<00:06:50.180> as<00:06:50.449> a<00:06:50.949> group

00:06:52.559 --> 00:06:52.569 
or we can create an in sets as a group

00:06:52.569 --> 00:06:59.469 
or we can create an in sets as a group
or<00:06:53.569> by<00:06:54.199> polygon<00:06:54.529> again<00:06:54.740> okay<00:06:58.180> next<00:06:59.180> let's<00:06:59.389> talk

00:06:59.469 --> 00:06:59.479 
or by polygon again okay next let's talk

00:06:59.479 --> 00:07:02.079 
or by polygon again okay next let's talk
about<00:06:59.539> champagne<00:07:00.080> so<00:07:00.889> we'll<00:07:01.159> go<00:07:01.279> into<00:07:01.399> vertex

00:07:02.079 --> 00:07:02.089 
about champagne so we'll go into vertex

00:07:02.089 --> 00:07:05.760 
about champagne so we'll go into vertex
sub-object<00:07:02.330> mode<00:07:02.869> and<00:07:03.969> what<00:07:04.969> we'll<00:07:05.089> do<00:07:05.270> is

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:05.770 
sub-object mode and what we'll do is

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:09.029 
sub-object mode and what we'll do is
we'll<00:07:06.770> hit<00:07:07.039> the<00:07:07.219> champers<00:07:07.610> settings<00:07:07.939> box<00:07:08.149> and

00:07:09.029 --> 00:07:09.039 
we'll hit the champers settings box and

00:07:09.039 --> 00:07:16.029 
we'll hit the champers settings box and
let's<00:07:10.039> do<00:07:10.189> five<00:07:12.999> okay<00:07:13.999> so<00:07:14.689> you<00:07:15.619> can<00:07:15.769> see<00:07:15.889> what

00:07:16.029 --> 00:07:16.039 
let's do five okay so you can see what

00:07:16.039 --> 00:07:20.619 
let's do five okay so you can see what
that<00:07:16.069> did<00:07:16.929> you<00:07:17.929> can<00:07:18.080> also<00:07:18.199> chamfer<00:07:19.449> edges<00:07:20.449> so

00:07:20.619 --> 00:07:20.629 
that did you can also chamfer edges so

00:07:20.629 --> 00:07:25.480 
that did you can also chamfer edges so
let's<00:07:20.809> select<00:07:21.110> all<00:07:21.409> the<00:07:22.339> top<00:07:22.550> edges<00:07:24.490> then

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:25.490 
let's select all the top edges then

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:27.249 
let's select all the top edges then
we'll<00:07:25.699> go<00:07:25.819> into<00:07:25.909> our<00:07:26.029> sham<00:07:26.330> fur<00:07:26.539> settings<00:07:27.050> box

00:07:27.249 --> 00:07:27.259 
we'll go into our sham fur settings box

00:07:27.259 --> 00:07:29.859 
we'll go into our sham fur settings box
for<00:07:27.559> the<00:07:27.649> edge<00:07:27.769> sub-object<00:07:28.129> mode<00:07:28.580> and<00:07:28.869> we'll

00:07:29.859 --> 00:07:29.869 
for the edge sub-object mode and we'll

00:07:29.869 --> 00:07:32.920 
for the edge sub-object mode and we'll
give<00:07:29.990> it<00:07:30.110> a<00:07:30.639> good<00:07:31.639> mouth<00:07:31.849> chamfer<00:07:32.269> and<00:07:32.449> the

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:32.930 
give it a good mouth chamfer and the

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:35.350 
give it a good mouth chamfer and the
cool<00:07:33.110> thing<00:07:33.259> about<00:07:33.289> edge<00:07:33.579> edges<00:07:34.579> when<00:07:35.119> we're

00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:35.360 
cool thing about edge edges when we're

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:38.619 
cool thing about edge edges when we're
stamping<00:07:35.509> them<00:07:35.869> is<00:07:36.229> we<00:07:36.439> have<00:07:36.529> segments<00:07:37.069> so<00:07:37.849> we

00:07:38.619 --> 00:07:38.629 
stamping them is we have segments so we

00:07:38.629 --> 00:07:43.869 
stamping them is we have segments so we
can<00:07:38.779> keep<00:07:38.930> on<00:07:39.579> curving<00:07:40.579> that<00:07:40.729> over<00:07:42.579> okay<00:07:43.579> and<00:07:43.819> I

00:07:43.869 --> 00:07:43.879 
can keep on curving that over okay and I

00:07:43.879 --> 00:07:45.339 
can keep on curving that over okay and I
know<00:07:43.939> this<00:07:44.209> is<00:07:44.329> probably<00:07:44.539> getting<00:07:44.930> really

00:07:45.339 --> 00:07:45.349 
know this is probably getting really

00:07:45.349 --> 00:07:46.600 
know this is probably getting really
long<00:07:45.499> and<00:07:45.709> boring<00:07:45.829> so<00:07:46.159> I'm<00:07:46.219> just<00:07:46.309> going<00:07:46.430> to<00:07:46.519> go

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:46.610 
long and boring so I'm just going to go

00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:48.730 
long and boring so I'm just going to go
ahead<00:07:46.669> and<00:07:46.819> into<00:07:47.029> here<00:07:47.269> I<00:07:47.439> think<00:07:48.439> I've<00:07:48.529> covered

00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:48.740 
ahead and into here I think I've covered

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:50.350 
ahead and into here I think I've covered

the main things you're going to do in

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:53.049 
the main things you're going to do in
modeling<00:07:50.719> not<00:07:51.259> all<00:07:51.439> of<00:07:51.559> them<00:07:51.680> but<00:07:52.309> uh<00:07:52.369> sorry
