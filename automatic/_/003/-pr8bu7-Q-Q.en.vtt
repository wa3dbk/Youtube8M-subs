13th I think it's been said that only

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.650 
13th I think it's been said that only
those<00:00:31.320> who<00:00:31.619> go<00:00:31.830> over<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.430> edge<00:00:32.579> can<00:00:33.329> write

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
those who go over the edge can write

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.650 
those who go over the edge can write
about<00:00:33.960> it<00:00:34.739> with<00:00:34.920> authority<00:00:35.100> and<00:00:35.790> today<00:00:36.450> is<00:00:36.630> one

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
about it with authority and today is one

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.020 
about it with authority and today is one
of<00:00:36.840> those<00:00:36.960> days<00:00:37.079> it's<00:00:37.620> it's<00:00:37.920> edgy<00:00:38.399> it's<00:00:38.640> edgy<00:00:38.850> I

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
of those days it's it's edgy it's edgy I

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.639 
of those days it's it's edgy it's edgy I
don't<00:00:39.239> know<00:00:39.360> that<00:00:39.510> we<00:00:39.570> have<00:00:39.690> to<00:00:40.079> go<00:00:40.200> over<00:00:40.230> it

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
don't know that we have to go over it

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.350 
don't know that we have to go over it
but<00:00:41.070> I<00:00:41.100> think<00:00:41.370> we<00:00:41.489> need<00:00:41.640> to<00:00:41.760> get<00:00:41.879> close<00:00:42.180> enough

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
but I think we need to get close enough

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.569 
but I think we need to get close enough
to<00:00:42.510> get<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:42.870> adrenaline<00:00:43.200> glow<00:00:43.680> going<00:00:44.100> right

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579

square<00:01:20.430> to<00:01:21.000> uranus<00:01:21.600> which<00:01:22.350> is<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:23.369> key<00:01:23.610> planet

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
square to uranus which is the key planet

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.560 
square to uranus which is the key planet
of<00:01:24.180> aquarius<00:01:25.049> and<00:01:25.229> uranus<00:01:26.130> is<00:01:26.610> like<00:01:26.880> lightning

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
of aquarius and uranus is like lightning

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.410 
of aquarius and uranus is like lightning
striking<00:01:27.960> Uranus<00:01:28.650> is<00:01:28.890> its<00:01:29.310> fire<00:01:29.670> but<00:01:30.090> it's<00:01:30.240> not

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
striking Uranus is its fire but it's not

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.630 
striking Uranus is its fire but it's not
i<00:01:30.450> mean<00:01:30.659> it's<00:01:30.780> it's<00:01:30.960> it's<00:01:31.530> fiery<00:01:31.920> and<00:01:32.340> as<00:01:32.460> much

i mean it's it's it's fiery and as much
as<00:01:32.820> it's<00:01:33.000> lightning<00:01:33.540> it's<00:01:33.720> like<00:01:33.930> electrical

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
as it's lightning it's like electrical

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.410 
as it's lightning it's like electrical
it's<00:01:34.860> Sparky<00:01:35.520> that's<00:01:35.909> a<00:01:36.090> better<00:01:36.240> way<00:01:36.299> of

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
it's Sparky that's a better way of

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.870 
it's Sparky that's a better way of
saying<00:01:36.659> it<00:01:36.869> and<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.650> sun's<00:01:37.950> half<00:01:38.310> square<00:01:38.729> to

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
saying it and the sun's half square to

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.810 
saying it and the sun's half square to
uranus<00:01:39.060> can<00:01:39.810> release<00:01:40.350> tension<00:01:40.650> and<00:01:41.009> kind<00:01:41.729> of

uranus can release tension and kind of

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.600 
uranus can release tension and kind of
really<00:01:42.299> kind<00:01:42.810> of<00:01:42.930> make<00:01:43.200> make<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:44.040> brain<00:01:44.280> cells

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
really kind of make make the brain cells

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.690 
really kind of make make the brain cells
fire<00:01:45.060> in<00:01:45.420> ways<00:01:45.630> that<00:01:45.659> are<00:01:45.930> very<00:01:46.200> edgy<00:01:46.829> from

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
fire in ways that are very edgy from

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.590 
fire in ways that are very edgy from
which<00:01:47.939> we<00:01:48.210> can<00:01:48.240> get<00:01:48.689> some<00:01:49.200> brilliant<00:01:50.130> ideas

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
which we can get some brilliant ideas

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.539 
which we can get some brilliant ideas
but<00:01:51.600> cooperation<00:01:52.590> might<00:01:52.890> be<00:01:53.070> a<00:01:53.100> little<00:01:53.280> bit

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
but cooperation might be a little bit

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.719 
but cooperation might be a little bit
difficult<00:01:53.850> because<00:01:54.270> with<00:01:55.259> the<00:01:55.500> Sun<00:01:55.890> hooking

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
difficult because with the Sun hooking

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.819 
difficult because with the Sun hooking
up<00:01:56.850> in<00:01:57.000> a<00:01:57.090> challenging<00:01:57.689> angle<00:01:58.140> with<00:01:58.380> Uranus

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
up in a challenging angle with Uranus

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.980 
up in a challenging angle with Uranus
the<00:01:58.860> planet<00:01:59.040> of<00:01:59.490> independence<00:02:00.149> and<00:02:00.390> rebellion

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
the planet of independence and rebellion

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.469 
the planet of independence and rebellion
we<00:02:01.439> each<00:02:01.619> want<00:02:01.890> to<00:02:01.979> express<00:02:02.340> our<00:02:02.670> own<00:02:02.909> will

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
we each want to express our own will

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.450 
we each want to express our own will
independently<00:02:04.350> which<00:02:04.920> can<00:02:05.130> make<00:02:05.250> cooperation

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
independently which can make cooperation

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.760 
independently which can make cooperation
I<00:02:06.180> think<00:02:06.390> a<00:02:06.479> bit<00:02:06.630> more<00:02:06.750> difficult<00:02:06.960> and<00:02:07.469> and

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
I think a bit more difficult and and

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.430 
I think a bit more difficult and and
double<00:02:08.429> down<00:02:08.759> with<00:02:09.239> the<00:02:09.390> moon<00:02:09.539> and<00:02:09.750> Leo<00:02:09.959> that

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
double down with the moon and Leo that

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.960 
double down with the moon and Leo that
