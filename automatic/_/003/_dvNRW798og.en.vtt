00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:07.180
 Allergic that as is your pretty 

00:00:04.569 --> 00:00:08.559
 today is I have a tutorial super bacÃ¡n 

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:10.930
 about the famous 

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:14.379
 Whittingdale or better known as ribbons 

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:16.000
 adhesives that are used because nobody 

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:18.100
 he taught us are extras shiver or be one 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.420
 of the purchase and it has been like later I 

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:21.280
 I'm going to get there and I'm going to hit it and it's going to 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:24.640
 to leave everything perfect but the game unce 

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:26.620
 he pulls it out and all that sale comes out lampacitos 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.900
 already the muddy and they were never 

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:30.310
 perfect and it 's a vile lie 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.840
 remember that at the end of this video I 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:34.870
 I'm going to give the super winner of the draw 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.370
 the last video because he wanted the 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.470
 better comment that made us come 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.360
 more freedom still in motion so the 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:41.980
 end of the video I go to the super winner and 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.079
 of the first things that I love you 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.390
 explain is how to keep these tapes 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:48.489
 stripping tape because I at first 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.020
 I bought them and they come so loose it's like 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:52.180
 a mini roll and appear in all 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:54.070
 sides then I did this with my feet 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:55.989
 in a porta then listened to events 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.430
 order conflicts and so do not know 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:00.059
 they end up losing because if it does not happen 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.059
 this 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:04.230
 9 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:20.290
 good 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.330
 in this video you can teach because 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.070
 we nobody taught us when we are 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:30.120
 these increases so that it does not happen what 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.120
 same thing that happened to me 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:55.259
 so the materials are first that 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.750
 all the base you need super dry 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:59.729
 girls, please be very well, dry 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.439
 do not get ahead of the question 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.789
 because if you do not pay the muddy many 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.409
 the ones that have told me because when I 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:05.939
 sac the felt has gotten me to everything 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.519
 the color and half a muddy 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:12.319
 port my wife is why it's because I do not 

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:12.319
 letting that canary pass through to vary 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.950
 the answer to all this is topcom 

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:22.930
 after washing is super dry we will 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.700
 put a layer of top coat the one that goes to 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:28.560
 be that we not jump when the Band - Aid 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.560
 do not leave the color 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.690
 and 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.710
 when we remove the strips from the nail 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.260
 on Mars that we paint with 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:48.630
 about it has to be cool do not wait 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:51.410

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:51.410

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.560
 answer was 2 with patience a dad 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:35.070
