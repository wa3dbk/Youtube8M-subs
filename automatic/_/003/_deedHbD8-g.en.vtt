00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
had a plastic for about three years I

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:15.180 
had a plastic for about three years I
was<00:03:14.020> completely<00:03:14.680> fine

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190 
was completely fine

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:19.380 
was completely fine
never<00:03:15.489> peeled<00:03:15.940> hardly<00:03:16.690> ever<00:03:16.810> look<00:03:17.049> dirty<00:03:18.390> and

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
never peeled hardly ever look dirty and

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:21.630 
never peeled hardly ever look dirty and
it<00:03:20.320> worked<00:03:20.620> good<00:03:20.739> for<00:03:20.799> me<00:03:21.070> and<00:03:21.220> I<00:03:21.280> liked<00:03:21.519> it

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
it worked good for me and I liked it

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.380 
it worked good for me and I liked it
better<00:03:21.760> than<00:03:22.090> what<00:03:22.360> it<00:03:22.420> looks<00:03:22.660> soft<00:03:22.930> and<00:03:24.269> if<00:03:25.269> I

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390 
better than what it looks soft and if I

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:28.490 
better than what it looks soft and if I
wanted<00:03:25.660> to<00:03:25.840> remove<00:03:26.049> it<00:03:26.230> I<00:03:26.380> can<00:03:26.590> easily<00:03:26.830> peel<00:03:27.250> it

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
wanted to remove it I can easily peel it

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.740 
wanted to remove it I can easily peel it
but<00:03:29.500> yes<00:03:29.709> paint<00:03:30.190> is<00:03:30.640> more<00:03:31.000> reliable

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
but yes paint is more reliable

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:36.600 
but yes paint is more reliable
it<00:03:32.530> may<00:03:32.890> look<00:03:33.130> better<00:03:33.480> your<00:03:34.480> opinion<00:03:35.430> but<00:03:36.430> I

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:36.610 
it may look better your opinion but I

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:40.500 
it may look better your opinion but I
like<00:03:36.940> platinum<00:03:37.510> on<00:03:37.750> grills<00:03:38.700> okay<00:03:39.700> so<00:03:40.330> that's

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
like platinum on grills okay so that's

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:42.930 
like platinum on grills okay so that's
why<00:03:40.660> I'm<00:03:40.750> doing<00:03:40.900> it<00:03:41.049> so<00:03:41.410> if<00:03:41.560> you<00:03:41.650> push<00:03:41.940> all

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
why I'm doing it so if you push all

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.620 
why I'm doing it so if you push all
right<00:03:43.090> so<00:03:43.239> we're<00:03:43.390> using<00:03:43.540> black<00:03:43.810> plastidip

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
right so we're using black plastidip

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.910 
right so we're using black plastidip
it's<00:03:46.630> completely<00:03:47.140> drawing<00:03:47.440> and<00:03:47.650> now<00:03:47.769> it's

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:47.920 
it's completely drawing and now it's

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.210 
it's completely drawing and now it's
time<00:03:48.190> to<00:03:48.220> spray<00:03:49.290> probably<00:03:50.290> do<00:03:50.440> maybe<00:03:50.769> three<00:03:50.890> to

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
time to spray probably do maybe three to

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:52.979 
time to spray probably do maybe three to
four<00:03:51.430> coats<00:03:51.640> whenever<00:03:52.209> it<00:03:52.360> looks<00:03:52.540> good<00:03:52.750> don't

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:52.989 
four coats whenever it looks good don't

00:03:52.989 --> 00:04:05.250 
four coats whenever it looks good don't
apply<00:03:53.350> too<00:03:53.410> much<00:03:53.650> though

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:16.920 

you

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:18.659 

all<00:04:17.500> right<00:04:17.650> I<00:04:17.799> think<00:04:17.919> that<00:04:18.130> looks<00:04:18.370> pretty<00:04:18.549> good

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:18.669 
all right I think that looks pretty good

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:20.159 
all right I think that looks pretty good
we're<00:04:18.970> going<00:04:19.060> to<00:04:19.180> let<00:04:19.299> it<00:04:19.419> dry<00:04:19.630> and<00:04:19.690> then<00:04:19.870> throw

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:20.169 
we're going to let it dry and then throw

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:20.930 
we're going to let it dry and then throw
it<00:04:20.259> on<00:04:20.350> the<00:04:20.470> car

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
it on the car

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.700 
it on the car
all<00:04:21.940> right<00:04:22.120> she's<00:04:22.419> dipped<00:04:22.690> and<00:04:22.900> dried<00:04:23.169> nice

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:23.710 
all right she's dipped and dried nice

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:51.480 
all right she's dipped and dried nice
and<00:04:23.949> black<00:04:24.100> time<00:04:24.639> to<00:04:24.820> install<00:04:25.180> it<00:04:50.070> all<00:04:51.070> right<00:04:51.220> I

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:51.490 
and black time to install it all right I

00:04:51.490 --> 00:05:00.439 
and black time to install it all right I
like<00:04:52.000> that<00:04:52.180> a<00:04:52.210> lot<00:04:52.270> better

00:05:00.439 --> 00:05:00.449 

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:03.929 

you

00:05:03.929 --> 00:05:03.939 

00:05:03.939 --> 00:05:06.490 

alright<00:05:04.939> guys<00:05:05.060> there<00:05:05.419> you<00:05:05.509> go<00:05:05.629> still<00:05:06.110> sweat<00:05:06.379> my

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:06.500 
alright guys there you go still sweat my

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:08.679 
alright guys there you go still sweat my
ass<00:05:06.680> off<00:05:06.949> but<00:05:07.219> I<00:05:07.250> finished<00:05:07.520> the<00:05:07.789> grill<00:05:08.000> I<00:05:08.270> think

00:05:08.679 --> 00:05:08.689 
ass off but I finished the grill I think

00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:11.290 
ass off but I finished the grill I think
it<00:05:08.780> looks<00:05:08.960> a<00:05:09.050> lot<00:05:09.199> better<00:05:09.439> than<00:05:09.800> the<00:05:10.460> shitty

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:11.300 
it looks a lot better than the shitty

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:14.100 
it looks a lot better than the shitty
plastic<00:05:11.990> chrome<00:05:12.229> that<00:05:12.439> was<00:05:12.620> pitted<00:05:13.039> and<00:05:13.189> I

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:14.110 
plastic chrome that was pitted and I

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:16.330 
plastic chrome that was pitted and I
just<00:05:15.110> don't<00:05:15.319> even<00:05:15.500> like<00:05:15.620> chrome<00:05:15.889> in<00:05:16.009> general

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:16.340 
just don't even like chrome in general

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:19.029 
just don't even like chrome in general
so<00:05:16.759> I<00:05:17.180> think<00:05:17.840> this<00:05:17.960> looks<00:05:18.169> much<00:05:18.349> better<00:05:18.530> now

00:05:19.029 --> 00:05:19.039 
so I think this looks much better now

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:20.379 
so I think this looks much better now
the<00:05:19.099> next<00:05:19.520> thing<00:05:19.639> on<00:05:19.819> the<00:05:19.909> front<00:05:20.120> end<00:05:20.210> of<00:05:20.300> this

00:05:20.379 --> 00:05:20.389 
the next thing on the front end of this

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:23.559 
the next thing on the front end of this
car<00:05:20.449> that<00:05:20.659> I<00:05:20.840> need<00:05:20.990> to<00:05:21.110> make<00:05:21.259> black<00:05:21.530> are<00:05:22.569> the

00:05:23.559 --> 00:05:23.569 
car that I need to make black are the

00:05:23.569 --> 00:05:25.719 
car that I need to make black are the
headlights<00:05:23.960> I'm<00:05:24.259> probably<00:05:25.099> going<00:05:25.340> to<00:05:25.550> take

00:05:25.719 --> 00:05:25.729 
headlights I'm probably going to take

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:27.490 
headlights I'm probably going to take
them<00:05:25.909> apart<00:05:26.030> and<00:05:26.389> paint<00:05:26.659> the<00:05:26.840> insides<00:05:27.169> black

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:27.500 
them apart and paint the insides black

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:29.770 
them apart and paint the insides black
um<00:05:27.770> they<00:05:28.699> look<00:05:28.879> really<00:05:29.060> good<00:05:29.240> you<00:05:29.300> can<00:05:29.479> buy

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:29.780 
um they look really good you can buy

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:31.779
