00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:06.800
 how about friends today we will be seeing the 

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:09.620
 song your name of me to san marcos de 

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:12.830
 the compresses are going to start 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:18.880
 the introduction and in this way fret 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:18.880
 number 7 rope number 3 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:29.170
 Now behind the same rope fret 2 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.320
 ah 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:40.800
 after rope number 3 frets 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:40.800
 9 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.470
 and we return to the fret 7 4 to 3 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:01:01.190
 now we play count 439 and chord 3 3 6 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:05.690
 and 7 on the same string 7 and 6 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:11.810
 then we finish with 4 fret strings 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:14.720
 7 and a slider the string 3 of the fret 7 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:18.400
 to the bottom 9 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.400
 it would sound like this 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:38.540
 now the weight or chorus of introduction is 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.540
 one of the truth notes 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.780
 Sun 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:47.940
 and the 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.640
 even you can do the 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.640
 introduction here now 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.709
 now the part of the sun or the strong 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:21.140
 sun is a bit complicated but let's go 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:23.600
 to explain as best as I can then 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.690
 they were quite sitting 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:29.850
 let's start on the second string 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:37.760
 fret number 17 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:37.760
 then second string 13 17 19 and 20 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:46.590
 now rope number 1 fret 19 and 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:52.340
 we go back to the fret 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:52.340
 20 of the second string and fret 17 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.790
 then we would have this 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.540
 yes 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:05.349
 slowly 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:18.390
 after this part we go to the 20 fret 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:20.520
 of the second string and fret 20 of the 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:24.510
 first and we go back to the 20th fret and 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:28.160
 we return to fret 17 of the second 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.160
 rope would be this way 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.900
 again complete a slow 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:42.690
 yes 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.690
 have the plant that I told them 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:50.080
 again fret 20 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:55.190
 of the second string and fret 17 of the 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:58.550
 first 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:04:00.390
 we go back to the 20th of the 19th of the 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:04.590
 second 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:06.920
 and we go back to 15 and fret 17 is a 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.920
 slide 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:13.480
 then we would have complete would this be 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:21.389
 first part second part came habitat 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.310
 well in the third 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.090
 in the end 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:35.350
 that would be the first round the second 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:35.350
 back is the same 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:41.980
 the first death now comes the second 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:45.840
 comes the third 

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:49.159
 the door 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:56.699
 and finally we slide the 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:56.699
 fret 17 to 19 

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:00.750
 and we go back to 17 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:09.390
 true then with its effects 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:12.680
 its delay 

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:12.680
 tonality in this way 

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:40.910
