00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:49.540 
me on chromatic then for this part here

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.670 
me on chromatic then for this part here
where<00:01:50.380> you<00:01:50.530> set<00:01:50.830> the<00:01:50.860> keys<00:01:51.820> you'd<00:01:52.690> click<00:01:53.080> on<00:01:53.140> G

where you set the keys you'd click on G

00:01:53.680 --> 00:02:06.469 
where you set the keys you'd click on G
a<00:01:57.030> C<00:01:58.470> D<00:01:59.470> and<00:02:04.200> then<00:02:05.200> you<00:02:05.229> come<00:02:05.649> down<00:02:05.680> here<00:02:06.250> to

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
a C D and then you come down here to

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:11.400 
a C D and then you come down here to
retune<00:02:07.479> speed<00:02:07.840> and<00:02:08.289> set<00:02:08.590> that<00:02:08.800> to<00:02:08.979> 3<00:02:10.200> then<00:02:11.200> you
