00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 
a little bit of detail to this now we're

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.499 
a little bit of detail to this now we're
going<00:01:18.830> to<00:01:18.890> be<00:01:18.979> doing<00:01:19.159> that<00:01:19.369> next<00:01:19.580> using<00:01:20.060> our

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:20.509 
going to be doing that next using our

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:25.450 
going to be doing that next using our
stylus<00:01:21.140> tool<00:01:21.409> or<00:01:22.130> a<00:01:22.190> dotting<00:01:22.610> tool<00:01:23.530> okay<00:01:24.530> so<00:01:25.310> we

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460 
stylus tool or a dotting tool okay so we

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.219 
stylus tool or a dotting tool okay so we
just<00:01:25.490> let<00:01:25.790> that<00:01:25.940> sit<00:01:26.240> for<00:01:26.270> a<00:01:26.509> few<00:01:26.690> seconds

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:27.229 
just let that sit for a few seconds

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:29.350 
just let that sit for a few seconds
which<00:01:28.100> allows<00:01:28.399> some<00:01:28.729> of<00:01:28.820> the<00:01:28.880> solvents<00:01:29.270> to

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 
which allows some of the solvents to

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.530 
which allows some of the solvents to
evaporate<00:01:29.899> which<00:01:30.110> stops<00:01:30.530> the<00:01:30.649> product<00:01:31.100> from

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:31.540 
evaporate which stops the product from

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:33.789 
evaporate which stops the product from
sinking<00:01:32.540> back<00:01:32.780> into<00:01:32.810> the<00:01:33.259> areas<00:01:33.560> that<00:01:33.590> we've

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:33.799 
sinking back into the areas that we've

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:36.789 
sinking back into the areas that we've
carved<00:01:34.100> out<00:01:34.540> so<00:01:35.540> to<00:01:35.600> create<00:01:36.020> this<00:01:36.409> all<00:01:36.649> I'm

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:36.799

carved out so to create this all I'm
going<00:01:36.950> to<00:01:37.040> do<00:01:37.220> is<00:01:37.520> use<00:01:37.820> my<00:01:38.119> large<00:01:38.479> ball<00:01:38.840> side
