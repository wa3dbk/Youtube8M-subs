here okay let's go right here let's go
and<00:03:42.080> add<00:03:42.200> some<00:03:42.470> code<00:03:42.650> to<00:03:42.680> this<00:03:42.920> button<00:03:43.190> so<00:03:43.520> go

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
and add some code to this button so go

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:48.910 
and add some code to this button so go
to<00:03:43.760> code<00:03:43.970> snippets<00:03:45.520> web<00:03:46.520> page<00:03:46.790> right<00:03:47.920> there's

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920 
to code snippets web page right there's

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.440 
to code snippets web page right there's
the<00:03:49.040> code<00:03:49.400> right<00:03:49.700> there<00:03:49.730> but<00:03:50.030> the<00:03:50.090> question<00:03:50.390> is

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450 
the code right there but the question is

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:53.680 
the code right there but the question is
where<00:03:50.750> is<00:03:50.780> that<00:03:51.020> going<00:03:51.290> I<00:03:52.210> don't<00:03:53.210> like<00:03:53.270> I<00:03:53.630> don't

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:55.990 
know where that coat there it is see
that<00:03:55.040> keyframe<00:03:55.340> right<00:03:55.520> there<00:03:55.700> there's<00:03:55.940> the

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
that keyframe right there there's the

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.480 
that keyframe right there there's the
code<00:03:56.240> right<00:03:56.420> there<00:03:56.500> at<00:03:57.500> the<00:03:57.590> top<00:03:57.890> you<00:03:58.160> see<00:03:58.190> that

00:03:58.480 --> 00:03:58.490 
code right there at the top you see that

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:00.460 
code right there at the top you see that
and<00:03:58.760> you<00:03:59.390> can<00:03:59.510> see<00:03:59.690> that<00:03:59.720> action<00:04:00.170> is<00:04:00.200> doing

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:00.470 
and you can see that action is doing

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:02.110 
and you can see that action is doing

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:03.520 
runs the rest of the animation and you
go<00:05:02.270> back<00:05:02.300> to<00:05:02.419> the<00:05:02.510> beginning<00:05:02.630> and<00:05:02.960> what's<00:05:03.200> bad

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:03.530 
go back to the beginning and what's bad

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:05.560 
go back to the beginning and what's bad
what<00:05:04.100> is<00:05:04.220> bad<00:05:04.430> programming<00:05:04.940> and<00:05:05.180> what<00:05:05.419> is<00:05:05.540> bad

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:05.570 
what is bad programming and what is bad

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:07.900 
what is bad programming and what is bad
coding<00:05:06.020> is<00:05:06.560> this<00:05:06.860> having<00:05:07.220> this<00:05:07.310> action<00:05:07.700> script

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:07.910 
coding is this having this action script

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:09.400 
coding is this having this action script
appear<00:05:08.180> here<00:05:08.330> and<00:05:08.480> actually<00:05:08.570> running<00:05:08.930> over<00:05:09.320> it

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:09.410 
appear here and actually running over it

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:11.620 
appear here and actually running over it
over<00:05:09.590> and<00:05:09.919> over<00:05:09.980> again<00:05:10.220> you<00:05:11.060> actually<00:05:11.240> do<00:05:11.450> not

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:11.630 
over and over again you actually do not

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:13.120 
over and over again you actually do not
want<00:05:11.930> to<00:05:11.990> do<00:05:12.169> that<00:05:12.290> that's<00:05:12.500> not<00:05:12.590> the<00:05:12.770> way<00:05:12.860> to<00:05:12.890> do

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:13.130 
want to do that that's not the way to do

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:14.710 
want to do that that's not the way to do
this<00:05:13.280> and<00:05:13.520> what<00:05:14.090> you're<00:05:14.180> going<00:05:14.300> to<00:05:14.360> find<00:05:14.390> out

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:14.720 
this and what you're going to find out

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.480 
this and what you're going to find out
in<00:05:14.870> the<00:05:14.990> future<00:05:15.350> and<00:05:15.590> not<00:05:15.800> in<00:05:15.950> this<00:05:16.010> lesson<00:05:16.220> but

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:16.490 
in the future and not in this lesson but

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:17.409 
in the future and not in this lesson but
in<00:05:16.580> the<00:05:16.669> future<00:05:16.850> lesson<00:05:17.180> is<00:05:17.270> we<00:05:17.360> actually

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:17.419 
in the future lesson is we actually

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:19.570 
in the future lesson is we actually
encapsulate<00:05:18.260> all<00:05:18.290> this<00:05:18.650> under<00:05:18.890> the<00:05:19.220> action

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:19.580 
encapsulate all this under the action

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:21.880 
encapsulate all this under the action
script<00:05:20.060> so<00:05:20.630> all<00:05:20.780> this<00:05:20.900> animation<00:05:21.410> right<00:05:21.710> here

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:21.890 
script so all this animation right here

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:25.390 
script so all this animation right here
will<00:05:21.980> actually<00:05:22.010> become<00:05:22.460> one<00:05:22.970> frame<00:05:23.979> all<00:05:24.979> on

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:25.400 
will actually become one frame all on

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.400 
will actually become one frame all on
frame<00:05:25.700> 1<00:05:26.030> and<00:05:26.360> on<00:05:26.630> the<00:05:26.780> top<00:05:26.960> of<00:05:27.080> that<00:05:27.200> frame

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:27.410 
frame 1 and on the top of that frame

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:28.750 
frame 1 and on the top of that frame
will<00:05:27.590> be<00:05:27.710> the<00:05:27.830> action<00:05:28.130> script<00:05:28.310> which<00:05:28.400> refers

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:28.760 
will be the action script which refers

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:29.860 
will be the action script which refers
to<00:05:29.060> it<00:05:29.210> so

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:29.870 
to it so

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:31.900 
to it so
actually<00:05:30.200> control<00:05:30.590> animation<00:05:31.310> with<00:05:31.430> inside

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:31.910 
actually control animation with inside

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:33.880 
actually control animation with inside
of<00:05:32.030> animation<00:05:32.600> going<00:05:33.200> to<00:05:33.290> show<00:05:33.410> you<00:05:33.470> how<00:05:33.650> to<00:05:33.710> do

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:33.890 
of animation going to show you how to do

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:35.800 
of animation going to show you how to do
that<00:05:34.040> in<00:05:34.100> a<00:05:34.280> future<00:05:34.490> video<00:05:34.700> but<00:05:35.570> this<00:05:35.660> is

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:35.810 
that in a future video but this is

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:37.210 
that in a future video but this is
