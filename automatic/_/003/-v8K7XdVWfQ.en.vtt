00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
whole lot of things that need to be

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:17.170 
whole lot of things that need to be
different<00:03:15.260> between<00:03:15.380> the<00:03:15.650> console<00:03:16.040> and<00:03:16.130> PC<00:03:16.459> but

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
different between the console and PC but

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.090 
different between the console and PC but
by<00:03:17.569> approaching<00:03:17.959> the<00:03:18.140> development<00:03:18.620> from<00:03:18.739> a<00:03:18.830> pc

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.100 
by approaching the development from a pc

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:23.020 
by approaching the development from a pc
side<00:03:19.340> I<00:03:20.269> really<00:03:20.959> focus<00:03:21.350> on<00:03:22.030> responsiveness

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
side I really focus on responsiveness

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:24.970 
side I really focus on responsiveness
and<00:03:23.360> the<00:03:23.510> controls<00:03:23.840> so<00:03:24.560> while<00:03:24.739> a<00:03:24.769> lot<00:03:24.950> of

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
and the controls so while a lot of

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:26.910 
and the controls so while a lot of
people<00:03:25.220> think<00:03:25.370> of<00:03:25.549> third<00:03:25.820> person<00:03:26.150> shooters<00:03:26.510> as

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
people think of third person shooters as

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.099 
people think of third person shooters as
funky<00:03:27.920> but<00:03:28.310> they<00:03:28.400> look<00:03:28.640> good<00:03:28.850> they<00:03:29.120> sell<00:03:29.989> this

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:30.109 
funky but they look good they sell this

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:31.569 
funky but they look good they sell this
thing<00:03:30.290> we<00:03:30.829> actually<00:03:30.950> have<00:03:31.160> a<00:03:31.220> really

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:31.579 
thing we actually have a really

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:33.930 
thing we actually have a really
good-looking<00:03:31.820> third-person<00:03:32.480> shooter<00:03:32.870> that

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
good-looking third-person shooter that

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.940 
good-looking third-person shooter that
that<00:03:34.940> is<00:03:35.180> really<00:03:35.209> fluid<00:03:36.019> and<00:03:36.260> responsive<00:03:36.410> to

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 
that is really fluid and responsive to

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:38.680 
that is really fluid and responsive to
your<00:03:37.040> motion<00:03:37.370> so<00:03:37.489> it<00:03:37.579> actually<00:03:37.730> plays<00:03:38.209> a<00:03:38.329> lot

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690 
your motion so it actually plays a lot

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:43.670 
your motion so it actually plays a lot
like<00:03:38.930> a<00:03:38.959> first-person<00:03:39.470> shooter

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
the map is what makes that experience

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:51.420 
the map is what makes that experience

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:58.600 
you know ten different game modes for

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.810 
you know ten different game modes for
one<00:03:58.750> map<00:03:58.960> right<00:03:59.230> now<00:03:59.350> we're<00:03:59.500> focused<00:03:59.830> on<00:03:59.950> one

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:00.820 
one map right now we're focused on one

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:03.390 
one map right now we're focused on one
map<00:04:01.030> one<00:04:01.540> game<00:04:01.750> mode<00:04:01.990> one<00:04:02.680> flaw<00:04:02.890> that<00:04:02.920> really

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
map one game mode one flaw that really

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.310 
map one game mode one flaw that really
really<00:04:03.580> is<00:04:03.850> good<00:04:04.060> and<00:04:04.240> supports<00:04:04.600> that<00:04:04.750> and<00:04:05.020> I

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:05.320 
really is good and supports that and I

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.500 
really is good and supports that and I
think<00:04:05.380> that's<00:04:05.530> a<00:04:05.830> pretty<00:04:06.490> big<00:04:06.700> differentiator

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
think that's a pretty big differentiator

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.420 
think that's a pretty big differentiator
for<00:04:07.810> us<00:04:08.080> from<00:04:08.380> lots<00:04:08.710> of<00:04:08.890> other<00:04:09.010> games<00:04:09.220> out

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:11.050 
there they'll built out there 22

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:12.690 
there they'll built out there 22
different<00:04:11.260> game<00:04:11.530> modes<00:04:11.560> and<00:04:12.310> they'll<00:04:12.460> have

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:12.700 
different game modes and they'll have

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:14.340
