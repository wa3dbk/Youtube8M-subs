00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:10.010
 I am here because as we saw 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:12.019
 that gervais round of 20 in hand and his 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:15.889
 neighbors that's what I do is that 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:18.500
 I do I have the chance to heal in 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:20.060
 kit and every year I come to you 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:23.869
 thank customers who trust 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:26.080
 to us this one is a castle the one 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:27.690
 that's the one who can actually 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:32.190
 even his 

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:33.420
 over the years to improve still further the 

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:35.430
 rosÃ© must be seen in the year for 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:40.310
 that he keeps his freshness as much the 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.310
 red castle takes more and more of 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.330
 aroma with the years that pass these 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.310
 emissions to arrive that one finds there 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.510
 obviously in southern wines with 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:51.070
 basically shadows and fruits 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.130
 red and yellow and red 2 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:56.150
 sometimes my guests 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:56.150
 spoon around the art 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:02.700
 anyway 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:04.500
 it happened to me arrived 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:07.650
 for ten days not to be given 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.350
 young for their wine and drink 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.390
 the table water I headed and I got 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.040
 preview at that moment that I did not have 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.200
 of taste no longer to dead 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.940
 what I ate to keep also from his 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:22.830
 interest the month which one and the other are 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:25.680
 absolutely complementary and cooking 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.270
 ozzy and dar es when cooking is 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.300
 original when she is inventive when 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.740
 she is creative 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:34.960
 winger and civilians 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.960
 young girls that connects that I had 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:40.670
 accompanied by a good wine 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:43.520
 it's even better my wine profit from the 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:46.720
 the creativity of cooking and the 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.720
 cooking take advantage of vaud 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.540
 his voice manager and kim who 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.369
 so much laughed for a month and 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.390
 half that I was in a kind of two 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:58.240
 clouds 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:00.369
 during that time and I know that I am 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.770
 do not doubt when I'm coming on 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:04.750
 to do Brussels I guess there I see the 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.700
 to have children but to laugh because I 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:09.479
 know that it's for the moment the most 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.479
 funny 3 kg 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:14.820
 it's not that he says things 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:17.060
 different but that he puts together but 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:19.110
 unpublished with spontaneity but more 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:22.470
 a command and rage 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.390
 a greater generosity is then 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.470
 they say the same thing 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.420
 they are for example there are no 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.580
 words that invents but the same words 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.820
 but the same your 10 with a splint 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.140
 and there is still a difference I 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.550
 thank those who drink monras because 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.820
 than what they see in bourlens 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:40.050
 finally drink a little bit of me since 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:44.820
 it's me who does it is he's at 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:47.520
 background a little bit like my movies it's a 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:50.480
 little the reflection of what I am I am 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.480
 very flattered that people see 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.370
