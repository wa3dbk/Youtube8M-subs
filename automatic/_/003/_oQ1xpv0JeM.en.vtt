00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:06.940
 hello everybody for a long time did not take any 

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:08.040
 Well, I would like a video about my car 

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:12.490
 share 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:16.630
 there was a small problem we include 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:20.610
 Ignition position in the salon include 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:24.480
 the stove however the air does not go to the salon 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:24.480
 blowing only glass 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.720
 on foot in salon 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.680
 there is no air 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:35.140
 blowing only goes to glass well in any 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:39.790
 different position 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:39.790
 switching air blowing only on the glass 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:46.000
 although the motor works perfectly audible 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:46.000
 how will he be 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:51.240
 i.e 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:55.760
 switches 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:55.760
 but the air goes only on the glasses 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:02.010
 I recently removed the panel 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:07.260
 I drove to and 100 under warranty all this 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:08.490
 it was mean there is such 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:13.110
 plastic shutter 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:15.830
 she transfers the position to the glass salon 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.810
 and so on and on temperature 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:21.920
 For some reason, the whole has aggravated, that is, she 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.870
 froze in one position therefore the air 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:27.480
 It goes only on the glass but it's already passed 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:34.260
 literally there a couple of weeks again the same 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:34.680
 the story itself is working all the stove 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:39.150
 fries 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:41.510
 but the air in the cabin is not all he goes blowing 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.250
 only on glass 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:46.010
 I did not have the camera at hand then 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:49.550
 the whole thing is to photograph that is this 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:51.860
 panel it is completely removed to 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:53.230
 get to this one here on private 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:58.610
 dampers 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:02:02.240
 Well, now I went went not on that 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:05.210
 I was told there that while such parts 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:10.490
 No, they have made an order as 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:14.780
 only the parts will come I will take a trip 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:17.360
 I will take the camera and the whole thing zasnimem 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:20.320
 I will explain and explain until I know what 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:23.000
 matter why it is so here because 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:26.240
 when they removed it all bent and I was 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.460
 sure that the temperature and and begins 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.080
 lead away and therefore she can not 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:34.459
 freezes in one position cannot 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:37.730
 switch translate position air 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:40.100
 saloon so on well as long as we go here 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.530
 so of course in the winter does not go well 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:45.260
 ride because the car will be long 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:49.850
 warm up the glass will defend 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:51.459
 although the cabin will be cold well, I hope to 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:56.510
 frost we are all 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:03:01.209
 eliminate well so long so here so well in general 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:01.209
 then that's it until all luck
