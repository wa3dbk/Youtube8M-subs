00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:06.500
 small presentation of the pump ram 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.820
 before by joseph montgolfier in 1792 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:10.769
 so here it is a small model that 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.130
 just it's principle but that works 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.519
 very well 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:18.690
 so we have a tank with a drop 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:20.250
 80 cm up to the pump and therefore 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.460
 this pump into a pipe that goes up to 2 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.050
 meters high or to repress the water that 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.550
 sings we can go up from the ohada ten 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.840
 times the height of the slope it has him 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.039
 makes a slope of 1 meter we can 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.810
 go up from the water to ten meters high 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.489
 knowing with a 15% return 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.920
 that is to say that 150 liters of water per 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:38.250
 cubic meter not made of a system so the 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:41.510
 system is composed so that's it we have the 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.559
 the arrival of water there we have a t6 and disown 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.210
 the a51 hydraulic fittings with a 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.190
 backstop wound and no matter 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.050
 what peace could make it a 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.020
 stitching with the repression studio 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.800
 who is mounted on a mast 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:57.670
 to repress the water and of which there is the 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.840
 pipe that leaves and there an elbow 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.230
 connect a statin since mounted to 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.730
 upside 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.890
 the system works the way 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.960
 Next the water goes down the street 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.220
 in wise to open the plate and the water is going 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.810
 pick up speed by taking 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.100
 speed she will succeed in closing the same 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.210
 the flat country that will give a shot of 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.760
 ram that to raise the pressure 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.840
 in the bottle 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.520
 the pressure will be maintained in the 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.380
 bottle thanks to the ball that goes 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.119
 close the hole and at that moment the air 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.700
 tablet will relax and get 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:24.170
 relaxing will repel the water in the 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.700
 discharge pipe stakeholders the 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.560
 prescience to balance in the system 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.300
 downstairs and the flapper has already 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.940
 reopened for the facts when to pass for 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.410
 a next cycle so the judge just 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.520
 operate the course and once or twice 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:35.600
 to raise the pressure in the 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:41.210
 bottle is normally after that 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:43.630
 works alone there we see the water 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:46.560
 exhaust 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.560
 there we can see the ball 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:54.190
 it lets the water through and closes the 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:57.220
 hole and there all up at the very top 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:58.480
 to two and a half times the height to the water 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.930
 which flows almost 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.930
 constant 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.150
 it can turn like that during 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.980
 hours without taking the turenne place 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.150
 once we do not stop the water but 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.830
 system can work like that 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.010
 indefinitely 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.010
 but there
