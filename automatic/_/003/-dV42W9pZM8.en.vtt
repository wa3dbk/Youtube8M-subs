00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.370

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:51.440

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:06.440
 I want to be his so what do you expect from it 

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:09.049
 thought you are going the Noordwijk months 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.880
 grow to report how you see that for you 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:13.850
 yes no idea what to expect there 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:16.009
 and i just follow knowledge and marijn one 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.320
 nation i needed it to happen 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:19.490
 daley blind you in the selection for 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.670
 the Dutch national team 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:25.250
 rightly so considering its performance 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.590
 what else is in that position I think 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.670
 it definitely back 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.619
 He tells you it's crystal 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.659
 passed 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:35.750
 I had him I'm the coach of 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:38.030
 spoken I actually already knew 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.470
 month since we share 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.480
 will probably be selected 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.700
 for this international match 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:45.650
 also because you naturally language another 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:49.850
 system plays like any other 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:53.090
 I played lumpy myself , because that's just that 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:55.040
 the road does not have that after 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.750
 two weeks playing well to scribble 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.610
 two months on three months on a whole 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.890
 good level 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.270
 it's a nice game against italy 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.800
 you gonna get t for a starting spot 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.510
 or do you just think quietly in there 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:08.030
 and on the couch in a heap up in the 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:11.180
 of course to you when you join 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.860
 so you know you are going minutes 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.270
 make and 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.370
 yes I hope so I hope I do 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.680
 made my debut of course like me 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:21.830
 sitting there you see there was a reward 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.810
 for a good season that you are going through 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.360
 yes it is also a sign that you get that right 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.830
 busy and especially that you have to keep it up 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.090
 just need a little level 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.090
 Mainly keep an incentive 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.640
 you have it you have the national anthem one 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.630
 little practice 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.610
 well i have for the rest all 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:40.519
 youth teams, we go through the 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.290
 Share yourself thus chillin when you get there 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:44.950
 pile then you can sing along 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.950
 because must arbitrariness
