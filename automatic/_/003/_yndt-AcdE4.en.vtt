00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:01.960
Hi guys,

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:06.890
Today I'm reviewing the vegan cookbook that
you have requested most of all: The Official

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:08.000
Thug Kitchen Cookbook.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.620
To be honest, I've held off on this one NOT
because I didn't want to dive into this book

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:16.820
full of beautiful pictures of tantalizing
vegan dishes, but because I wanted to learn

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.859
more about the controversy that arose when
the book was released.

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:24.789
Thug Kitchen is a blog full of salty language
written from the perspective of a dude with

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:29.390
a vegan girlfried. Using the conversational
writing style of what I thought was just like

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:31.119
14 year old me.

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:34.989
Yes, that's right, I used to use a swear for
every other word and sometimes in between

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:40.280
syllables. I never associated this style of
speech particularly with hiphop before, though

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:47.280
now I can see the connection. And I thought
thug was just a word for people who acted

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:54.660
bad. But bad as in cool. And that older, bitter
adults used it to label kids who hung around

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.520
skateparks and malls. Because that's the context
that I personally heard it in.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.980
I was oblivious to the fact that many Black
americans are hearing the word thug in a much

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.380
different, more serious context, and that
this is reflective of a society that still

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.250
disporportionately persecutes Black individuals.

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.390
The fact that I didn't initally grasp this
is alarming to me. When racism is invisible

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:21.040
to us, we can't help. Only when we acknowledge
a problem can we take action to change.

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:25.009
I'm putting a few links in the description
box below to share some of the articles that

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:29.220
really made me think about the gap between
where we are now and equality.

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.740
I believe the intent behind the language use
in this book was a good one; bringing humour

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.020
to vegan cooking, making it fun, making people
laugh and more open to trying plant based

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:45.170
meals. I'm begining to understand that our
actual effect is also important, not just

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:46.689
our intent.

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:49.590
So with that said, let's get into the recipes!

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.470
The first recipe I tried was for Cornmeal
Waffles and Strawberry Syrup. It just looked

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:58.770
so good in the photo that I had to try it.
That's one thing I really like about this

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.409
book. Lots of photos and wonderfully composed
at that which really excites you into making

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:04.310
the thing.

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.670
The recipe itself was very simple. For the
syrup just combine strawberries and stuff

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.250
and let it simmer on the stove.

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.739
For the waffles, as long as you know how to
measure stuff, you'll get it. Mix the dry

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:20.410
ingredients, add in the wet stuff, stir.

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:26.900
They came out as I believe they were intended
to. Quite fluffy, nice looking although I

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.519
know my waffle maker heats a bit unevenly
so we have the super crispy middle and softer

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:32.739
edges.

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:37.440
Tastewise though..well..I think that if you
really like cornbread and enjoy that slightly

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.989
gritty texture, you'll love these. But they
aren't really my style of breakfast waffles.

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:45.920
I thought they'd do better with something
savory like vegan chili. And now, as I record

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.239
this voice over, I'm craving a good vegan
chili.

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:53.569
The strawberry sauce was good though I am
a biased Canadian and really believe that

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:57.810
pure maple syrup is THE superior breakfast
syrup and everything else is just never going

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.860
to be as good. mmkay

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.440
Later, I tried the Spiced Chickpea Wraps.
They are supposed to capture the smoky flavour

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.640
of a falafel without all the *ahem* work.

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:12.290
First, we make a tahini dressing. This is
the kind of recipe I love. Everything in the

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:19.260
blender. Boom done. Love it. The taste is
garlicky, lemony and delicious and the consistency

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:20.819
is creamy and perfect.

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:25.849
Then, we heat the chickpeas on the stove with
oil. Add some sour, sweet and salty in the

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:30.519
form of lemon juice, maple syrup and soy sauce.
And then some spices.

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:34.030
Less than 10 minutes later, yea..those chickpeas
were pretty tasty.

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:39.220
I put that on some spinach and mixed veggies,
with the tahini sauce and wrapped it up.

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:45.110
Now for the taste test. I did get the falafel-ness
from the cumin in the chickpeas and the tahini

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:50.890
sauce was really tasty. My boyfriend said
it was awesome. I'll definitely make this

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:55.340
for him again, though for me it just made
me crave actual falafel.

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:01.110
Next up, we have vegetable pad thai. Now,
I've had a lot of pad thai in my hometown

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:06.360
of Vancouver, BC and really love the dish.
Every restaurant always made it a little bit

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:11.360
differently and even the worst pad thai I've
ever had was still really delicious to me.

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:16.120
So we're cooking up shallots and brocolli
here and adding in cooked noodles and the

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.750
pad thai sauce from the recipe.

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:22.180
Everything looks and smells so good at this
point.

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:27.110
But on the first taste test to adjust the
seasonings, I began to have my doubts.

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:31.750
The noodles tasted a bit plain, which was
the expectation since we're supposed to add

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:37.340
more sauce. But already the tang from the
lime was overpowering the dish.

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:42.810
Maybe my limes were particularly acidic? I'm
not sure. I added a bit more sauce and attempted

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:46.570
to balance the tang with more sweetness and
salt.

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:51.030
Instead of the plain dry fried tofu in the
recipe, I used some leftover spicy peanut

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:56.750
tofu and folded in some scallions, leaving
out the cilantro for my cilantro adverse partner.

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:58.419
Time to plate up.

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:04.210
A helping of steaming noodles, some greens,
and some fresh mung bean sprouts.

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:11.210
And for the taste test...well..yup. It really
doesn't taste any pad thai that I've had before.

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:19.330
The boyfriend said something along the lines
of "eh..it tastes weird."

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:24.590
I also tried the tofu scramble tacos and roasted
sriracha cauliflower bites with peanut sauce

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:29.680
which I didn't film but they were kind of
the same thing. OK, not gross, but needed

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.949
some adjustment to go from ok to great.

00:05:31.949 --> 00:05:36.350
So overall, it was hit and miss. The pictures
were so awesome and the recipe names were

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:43.350
so interesting to me with lots of international
flavours. So...

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:48.470
but it seemed to fall short. There's also a lot of guidelines

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:53.430
for people who might be new to cooking which
I can totally get behind. And it's all delivered

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:57.449
in a wise-cracking, swear word heavy, humourous
way.

00:05:57.449 --> 00:06:01.360
So that's my opinion on the recipes I've tried
so far. Let me know your thoughts in the comments

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:07.090
below. Have you tried any of the recipes?
What did you think?

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:14.090
Thanks for watching this video and don't forget
to leave your cookbook review requests for

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:15.300
next time.

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:15.979
Bye for now!
