give you a kill but I think that's gonna
be<00:03:44.480> a<00:03:44.510> little<00:03:44.870> because<00:03:45.470> you<00:03:45.650> can<00:03:45.770> get<00:03:45.890> that

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 
be a little because you can get that

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:49.449 
be a little because you can get that
