all reality all gas stations should have

00:06:22.849 --> 00:06:25.270 
all reality all gas stations should have
free<00:06:23.120> air<00:06:23.300> I<00:06:23.599> feel<00:06:23.930> don't<00:06:24.650> you<00:06:24.830> do<00:06:25.129> you<00:06:25.220> agree

here's<00:06:25.729> the<00:06:25.909> issue<00:06:26.030> that<00:06:26.419> I<00:06:26.449> have<00:06:26.750> and<00:06:27.020> the

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:27.080 
here's the issue that I have and the

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:28.779 
here's the issue that I have and the
reason<00:06:27.319> that<00:06:27.349> I<00:06:27.500> will<00:06:27.650> always<00:06:27.860> be<00:06:28.190> a<00:06:28.220> fatty<00:06:28.520> fat

00:06:28.779 --> 00:06:28.789 
reason that I will always be a fatty fat

00:06:28.789 --> 00:06:31.180 
reason that I will always be a fatty fat
is<00:06:29.360> because<00:06:29.960> I<00:06:30.349> know<00:06:30.470> I'm<00:06:30.620> not<00:06:30.740> a<00:06:30.800> fatty<00:06:30.979> fat

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:31.190 
is because I know I'm not a fatty fat

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:32.740 
is because I know I'm not a fatty fat
right<00:06:31.370> now<00:06:31.430> but<00:06:31.729> I<00:06:31.909> mean<00:06:31.940> eventually<00:06:32.539> it<00:06:32.629> will

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:32.750 
right now but I mean eventually it will

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:34.809 
right now but I mean eventually it will
become<00:06:33.050> another<00:06:33.229> fatty<00:06:33.560> fat<00:06:33.800> because<00:06:34.520> what

00:06:34.809 --> 00:06:34.819 
become another fatty fat because what

00:06:34.819 --> 00:06:36.820 
become another fatty fat because what
happens<00:06:35.210> is<00:06:35.419> days<00:06:36.110> like<00:06:36.319> today<00:06:36.470> where<00:06:36.740> I'm

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:36.830 
happens is days like today where I'm

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:38.649 
happens is days like today where I'm
like<00:06:37.009> and<00:06:37.310> we'll<00:06:37.610> take<00:06:37.819> the<00:06:37.970> day<00:06:38.150> off<00:06:38.180> from

00:06:38.649 --> 00:06:38.659 
like and we'll take the day off from

00:06:38.659 --> 00:06:43.270 
like and we'll take the day off from
dieting<00:06:39.379> and<00:06:39.500> exercise<00:06:40.099> and<00:06:40.520> I<00:06:41.060> go<00:06:41.300> crazy<00:06:42.280> like

00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:16.460 
have like nine of those that's why I'll

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:18.490
