reps<00:00:38.969> we<00:00:39.420> started<00:00:39.809> law<00:00:39.960> we<00:00:40.170> went<00:00:40.320> lower<00:00:40.559> so<00:00:40.800> we

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
reps we started law we went lower so we

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.020 
reps we started law we went lower so we
can<00:00:41.039> increase<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.399> weight<00:00:41.429> but<00:00:41.579> then<00:00:41.699> we<00:00:41.789> back

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
can increase the weight but then we back

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.569 
can increase the weight but then we back
off<00:00:42.300> to<00:00:42.749> get<00:00:42.870> those<00:00:42.989> flow<00:00:43.170> touch<00:00:43.379> fibers<00:00:43.800> dips

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
off to get those flow touch fibers dips

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.209 
off to get those flow touch fibers dips
I<00:00:44.730> love<00:00:44.999> doing<00:00:45.269> 5<00:00:45.480> sets<00:00:45.719> of<00:00:45.780> 5<00:00:45.839> reps<00:00:46.019> dips<00:00:46.890> to<00:00:47.100> me

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
I love doing 5 sets of 5 reps dips to me

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:48.709

or an exercise meant to be done for low
reps<00:00:48.960> think<00:00:49.920> about<00:00:50.069> references<00:00:50.399> you<00:00:50.460> want<00:00:50.640> to

00:00:50.689 --> 00:00:50.699 
reps think about references you want to

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:51.860 
reps think about references you want to
have<00:00:50.789> a<00:00:50.819> weight<00:00:51.089> that's<00:00:51.269> heavy<00:00:51.449> enough<00:00:51.690> but

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
have a weight that's heavy enough but

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.360 
have a weight that's heavy enough but
also<00:00:52.019> allows<00:00:52.319> you<00:00:52.499> get<00:00:52.679> as<00:00:52.769> deep<00:00:52.979> a<00:00:53.100> range<00:00:53.249> of

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
also allows you get as deep a range of

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.040 
also allows you get as deep a range of
motion<00:00:53.460> should<00:00:53.999> go<00:00:54.149> as<00:00:54.269> deep<00:00:54.479> as<00:00:54.629> I<00:00:54.749> do<00:00:54.809> or

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
motion should go as deep as I do or

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.719 
motion should go as deep as I do or
maybe<00:00:55.199> a<00:00:55.319> little<00:00:55.440> bit<00:00:55.589> higher<00:00:55.769> but<00:00:56.489> that<00:00:56.579> is<00:00:56.640> a

00:00:56.719 --> 00:00:56.729 
maybe a little bit higher but that is a

00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:58.430 
maybe a little bit higher but that is a
perfect<00:00:57.089> range<00:00:57.210> of<00:00:57.329> motion<00:00:57.600> for<00:00:57.989> all<00:00:58.109> types<00:00:58.350> of

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.649 
perfect range of motion for all types of
dips<00:00:58.679> then<00:00:59.519> I<00:00:59.550> do<00:00:59.639> Close<00:00:59.940> Grip<00:00:59.969> curls<00:01:00.420> with<00:01:00.629> a

dips then I do Close Grip curls with a
plank<00:01:00.929> walk<00:01:01.199> up<00:01:01.379> but<00:01:01.499> I<00:01:01.559> know<00:01:01.620> it's<00:01:01.859> not<00:01:01.920> a

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:24.329 
230 pounds on the press out so then I

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:27.080 
230 pounds on the press out so then I
finish<00:01:24.719> with<00:01:24.840> a<00:01:24.869> high<00:01:25.079> rep<00:01:25.289> incline<00:01:25.680> press<00:01:26.090> or

a barbell narrow grip press and you see

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:30.499 
a barbell narrow grip press and you see
I<00:01:29.070> come<00:01:29.340> down<00:01:29.520> like<00:01:29.640> a<00:01:29.700> Close<00:01:29.939> Grip<00:01:29.969> press<00:01:30.329> but

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
I come down like a Close Grip press but

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.539 
I come down like a Close Grip press but
I<00:01:30.539> kind<00:01:30.750> of<00:01:30.810> extend<00:01:31.200> up<00:01:31.409> some<00:01:32.159> people<00:01:32.399> call<00:01:32.520> it

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
a jam press either way it's a fantastic

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.950 
a jam press either way it's a fantastic
actually<00:01:35.250> exercise<00:01:35.670> for<00:01:35.880> adding<00:01:36.210> strength

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960

actually exercise for adding strength
and<00:01:37.200> tricep<00:01:37.619> mass<00:01:37.829> but<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.759> reps<00:01:39.000> have<00:01:39.210> it

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
and tricep mass but the reps have it

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:40.609

were<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.570> first<00:01:39.810> three<00:01:39.990> sets<00:01:40.200> I'm<00:01:40.380> going<00:01:40.560> to

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
were the first three sets I'm going to

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.319 
were the first three sets I'm going to
use<00:01:40.740> a<00:01:40.770> relatively<00:01:41.219> heavy<00:01:41.460> weight<00:01:41.700> but<00:01:42.210> that

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
use a relatively heavy weight but that

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.630 
use a relatively heavy weight but that
last<00:01:42.570> set<00:01:42.869> I'm<00:01:43.500> ramping<00:01:44.100> it<00:01:44.159> up<00:01:44.280> because<00:01:44.460> I

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
last set I'm ramping it up because I

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.279 
last set I'm ramping it up because I
want<00:01:44.850> to<00:01:44.909> bring<00:01:45.030> as<00:01:45.090> much<00:01:45.240> blood<00:01:45.570> flow<00:01:45.780> to<00:01:46.200> the

00:01:46.279 --> 00:01:46.289 
want to bring as much blood flow to the

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:48.289 
want to bring as much blood flow to the
triceps<00:01:46.649> as<00:01:46.740> possible<00:01:47.219> really<00:01:47.820> get<00:01:48.060> as<00:01:48.149> much

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
triceps as possible really get as much

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.270 
triceps as possible really get as much
blood<00:01:48.659> in<00:01:48.810> there<00:01:49.020> as<00:01:49.140> possible<00:01:49.590> so<00:01:49.979> that<00:01:50.009> way<00:01:50.250> I

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
blood in there as possible so that way I

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.099 
blood in there as possible so that way I
can<00:01:50.429> target<00:01:50.969> the<00:01:51.090> slow<00:01:51.240> twitch<00:01:51.479> muscle<00:01:51.810> fibers

00:01:52.099 --> 00:01:52.109 
can target the slow twitch muscle fibers

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:54.349 
can target the slow twitch muscle fibers
also<00:01:52.289> encourage<00:01:52.890> growth<00:01:53.219> from<00:01:53.939> multiple

00:01:54.349 --> 00:01:54.359 
also encourage growth from multiple

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:55.819 
also encourage growth from multiple
aspects<00:01:54.869> and<00:01:55.079> I<00:01:55.170> don't<00:01:55.259> think<00:01:55.530> we<00:01:55.799> look

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
aspects and I don't think we look

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.010 
aspects and I don't think we look
forward<00:01:56.310> to<00:01:56.399> that<00:01:56.549> enough<00:01:57.299> so<00:01:57.539> now<00:01:57.689> I<00:01:57.719> want<00:01:57.960> to

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
forward to that enough so now I want to

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.330 
forward to that enough so now I want to
talk<00:01:58.170> a<00:01:58.200> little<00:01:58.469> bit<00:01:58.590> about<00:01:58.649> the<00:01:58.859> science<00:01:59.100> and

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
talk a little bit about the science and

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.249 
talk a little bit about the science and
why<00:01:59.549> I<00:01:59.579> designed<00:01:59.999> the<00:02:00.090> workout<00:02:00.359> this<00:02:00.539> way<00:02:00.749> so

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
why I designed the workout this way so

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.260 
why I designed the workout this way so
