she's resolution all the time because
they<00:01:01.190> certain<00:01:02.179> of<00:01:02.329> these<00:01:02.539> series<00:01:03.469> which<00:01:04.220> use<00:01:04.879> a

they certain of these series which use a
phosphorescent<00:01:06.409> pigment<00:01:06.979> so<00:01:07.670> when<00:01:07.880> you<00:01:07.970> turn

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 
phosphorescent pigment so when you turn

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.260 
phosphorescent pigment so when you turn
out<00:01:08.420> the<00:01:08.570> lights<00:01:08.780> it's<00:01:09.380> become<00:01:09.830> like<00:01:10.399> science

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270 
out the lights it's become like science

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.590 
out the lights it's become like science
fiction<00:01:11.439> grooming<00:01:12.439> green<00:01:13.430> stuff<00:01:13.850> and<00:01:14.149> so<00:01:14.570> it's

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 
fiction grooming green stuff and so it's

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.350 
fiction grooming green stuff and so it's
on<00:01:15.080> and<00:01:15.259> off<00:01:15.409> the<00:01:16.070> painting<00:01:16.520> is<00:01:16.640> never<00:01:16.880> on<00:01:17.149> and

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
on and off the painting is never on and

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:27.899 
on and off the painting is never on and
off

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:27.909 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:30.780 

why<00:01:28.450> she<00:01:28.780> stopped<00:01:29.170> doing<00:01:29.440> them<00:01:29.770> you<00:01:30.580> know<00:01:30.729> it

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:30.790 
why she stopped doing them you know it

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:32.160 
why she stopped doing them you know it
was<00:01:30.909> interesting<00:01:31.570> also<00:01:31.720> though<00:01:32.110> she

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.170 
was interesting also though she

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.770 
was interesting also though she
certainly<00:01:32.430> kept<00:01:33.430> some<00:01:34.180> of<00:01:34.300> the<00:01:34.360> same<00:01:34.600> elements

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:34.780 
certainly kept some of the same elements

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.219 
certainly kept some of the same elements
they<00:01:35.680> were<00:01:35.740> meant<00:01:36.070> to<00:01:36.190> be<00:01:36.930> specific<00:01:37.930> to<00:01:38.080> those

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:38.229 
they were meant to be specific to those

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:40.260 
they were meant to be specific to those
spaces<00:01:38.740> you<00:01:39.400> know<00:01:39.520> they<00:01:39.610> were<00:01:39.700> meant<00:01:39.940> to<00:01:40.000> be<00:01:40.240> a

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
spaces you know they were meant to be a

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
total environment so you had the

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.190 
total environment so you had the
experience<00:01:42.250> only<00:01:43.240> you<00:01:43.659> know<00:01:43.750> the<00:01:43.869> people<00:01:44.170> who

work<00:02:30.050> in<00:02:30.230> my<00:02:30.410> studio<00:02:31.030> until<00:02:32.030> I<00:02:32.920> thought<00:02:33.920> of

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
work in my studio until I thought of

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:40.820 
work in my studio until I thought of
making<00:02:34.850> this<00:02:35.210> idea<00:02:36.020> of<00:02:36.080> this<00:02:36.230> fountain

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.610 

I<00:02:40.860> actually<00:02:41.820> envisioned<00:02:42.600> the<00:02:42.840> idea<00:02:43.260> of<00:02:43.410> the

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
I actually envisioned the idea of the

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.820 
I actually envisioned the idea of the
four<00:02:43.890> pieces<00:02:44.190> long<00:02:45.000> before<00:02:45.540> I<00:02:45.900> even<00:02:46.350> did<00:02:46.680> the

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
four pieces long before I even did the

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
four pieces long before I even did the
first<00:02:47.070> wave<00:02:47.370> in<00:02:48.330> a<00:02:48.900> print<00:02:49.290> that<00:02:49.620> I<00:02:50.040> did<00:02:50.400> in

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
first wave in a print that I did in

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:54.950 
first wave in a print that I did in
Chicago<00:02:51.510> and<00:02:51.920> I<00:02:52.920> had<00:02:53.280> a<00:02:53.520> form<00:02:54.060> in<00:02:54.360> the<00:02:54.690> center

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:54.960 
Chicago and I had a form in the center

00:02:54.960 --> 00:03:00.140 
Chicago and I had a form in the center
that<00:02:55.830> held<00:02:56.790> the<00:02:57.000> pieces<00:02:57.210> up<00:02:57.660> and<00:02:58.850> this<00:02:59.850> is

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
that held the pieces up and this is

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.470 
that held the pieces up and this is
unique<00:03:01.020> and<00:03:01.320> that<00:03:01.650> the<00:03:02.040> pieces<00:03:02.280> are<00:03:02.790> held<00:03:03.270> by

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
unique and that the pieces are held by

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.400 
unique and that the pieces are held by
their<00:03:03.690> own<00:03:03.840> floating<00:03:04.410> above<00:03:04.680> the<00:03:04.740> water<00:03:06.410> but

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
their own floating above the water but

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:08.930 
their own floating above the water but
the<00:03:07.560> idea<00:03:08.040> of<00:03:08.130> having<00:03:08.640> a

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
the idea of having a

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.370 
the idea of having a
north-south-east-west

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
north-south-east-west

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.100 
north-south-east-west
occurred<00:03:10.710> to<00:03:10.920> me<00:03:11.070> sometime<00:03:11.790> I<00:03:12.240> think<00:03:12.690> in<00:03:12.930> the

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
occurred to me sometime I think in the

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:16.370 
occurred to me sometime I think in the
late<00:03:13.680> seventies
