00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:10.850 

2001<00:00:02.520> Volkswagen<00:00:03.480> Beetle<00:00:03.959> TDI<00:00:04.470> I<00:00:09.740> thought<00:00:10.740> of

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
2001 Volkswagen Beetle TDI I thought of

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.030 
2001 Volkswagen Beetle TDI I thought of
an<00:00:10.980> idea<00:00:11.280> to<00:00:12.210> test<00:00:12.450> the<00:00:12.920> coolant<00:00:13.920> in<00:00:14.009> the

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
an idea to test the coolant in the

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.470 
an idea to test the coolant in the
cooling<00:00:14.429> system<00:00:15.379> so<00:00:17.060> because<00:00:18.060> I<00:00:18.180> have<00:00:18.330> no

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
cooling system so because I have no

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:19.910 
cooling system so because I have no
record<00:00:18.779> of<00:00:18.869> it<00:00:19.020> being<00:00:19.199> serviced<00:00:19.650> or<00:00:19.770> anything

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
record of it being serviced or anything

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.609 
record of it being serviced or anything
so<00:00:20.820> it<00:00:20.970> is<00:00:21.119> it<00:00:21.300> is<00:00:21.330> I<00:00:21.570> want<00:00:22.250> right<00:00:23.250> under<00:00:23.939> here<00:00:24.619> -

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
so it is it is I want right under here -

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.730 
so it is it is I want right under here -
way<00:00:25.769> to<00:00:25.830> radiator<00:00:26.279> is<00:00:26.660> see<00:00:27.660> it<00:00:27.779> that<00:00:28.410> little

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
way to radiator is see it that little

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.890 
way to radiator is see it that little
knob<00:00:29.070> right<00:00:29.400> there<00:00:29.460> what<00:00:30.330> you<00:00:30.480> do<00:00:30.599> is<00:00:30.750> you

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
knob right there what you do is you

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.659 
knob right there what you do is you
twist<00:00:31.230> it<00:00:31.410> a<00:00:31.500> little<00:00:31.679> bit<00:00:31.890> and<00:00:32.070> pull<00:00:32.279> it<00:00:32.399> it

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
twist it a little bit and pull it it

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.229 
twist it a little bit and pull it it
doesn't<00:00:32.969> come<00:00:33.120> off<00:00:33.239> but<00:00:34.079> um<00:00:34.880> if<00:00:35.880> you<00:00:36.030> put<00:00:36.210> a

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
doesn't come off but um if you put a

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.160 
doesn't come off but um if you put a
little<00:00:36.950> jar<00:00:37.950> back<00:00:38.190> there<00:00:38.460> or<00:00:38.730> jug<00:00:39.030> you<00:00:39.809> can<00:00:39.989> get

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
little jar back there or jug you can get

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.840 
little jar back there or jug you can get
a<00:00:40.200> quick<00:00:40.829> sample<00:00:41.100> of<00:00:42.530> the<00:00:43.530> coolant<00:00:43.950> mine<00:00:44.550> was

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
a quick sample of the coolant mine was

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.319 
a quick sample of the coolant mine was
really<00:00:45.090> clean<00:00:45.660> and<00:00:46.789> it<00:00:47.789> looked<00:00:48.030> like<00:00:48.149> it<00:00:48.270> was

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
really clean and it looked like it was

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.639 
really clean and it looked like it was
sort<00:00:48.719> of<00:00:48.840> brand-new<00:00:49.260> but<00:00:50.129> um<00:00:50.340> I<00:00:51.320> was<00:00:52.320> still<00:00:52.530> on

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
shore so what I did was I attached a

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.180 
shore so what I did was I attached a
little<00:00:55.940> what<00:00:56.940> is<00:00:56.969> mercedes-benz<00:00:57.840> -<00:00:58.710> I<00:00:58.739> don't

have the number on me - mercedes-benz
fuel<00:01:01.350> filter<00:01:01.859> so<00:01:02.399> I<00:01:02.460> can<00:01:02.609> inline<00:01:02.969> fuel<00:01:03.239> v

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
fuel filter so I can inline fuel v

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.660 
fuel filter so I can inline fuel v
filter<00:01:04.170> I<00:01:04.350> actually<00:01:04.739> have<00:01:05.070> them<00:01:05.189> connected<00:01:05.610> to

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
filter I actually have them connected to

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.750 
filter I actually have them connected to
my<00:01:05.909> fuel<00:01:06.900> system<00:01:07.320> -<00:01:07.500> as<00:01:07.770> well<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.280> import<00:01:08.670> and

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
my fuel system - as well the import and

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:14.630 
my fuel system - as well the import and
the<00:01:08.880> out<00:01:09.000> port<00:01:09.650> in<00:01:10.650> that<00:01:10.799> corner<00:01:11.159> um<00:01:11.689> I<00:01:13.640> don't

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
the out port in that corner um I don't

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.359 
the out port in that corner um I don't
know<00:01:14.790> if<00:01:14.880> you<00:01:14.970> can<00:01:15.119> see<00:01:15.420> it<00:01:15.540> but<00:01:15.810> if<00:01:16.590> you<00:01:17.159> can

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
know if you can see it but if you can

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:24.350 
know if you can see it but if you can
see<00:01:19.100> let<00:01:20.100> me<00:01:20.130> just<00:01:20.750> attach<00:01:21.750> this

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:30.340 

if<00:01:24.840> you<00:01:25.020> can<00:01:25.200> see<00:01:26.810> it<00:01:27.810> accumulated<00:01:28.620> a<00:01:28.920> lot<00:01:29.310> of

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
if you can see it accumulated a lot of

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:35.990 
if you can see it accumulated a lot of
black<00:01:31.350> crap<00:01:32.010> area<00:01:34.250> there<00:01:35.250> was<00:01:35.400> a<00:01:35.430> lot<00:01:35.700> more

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
black crap area there was a lot more

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.630 
black crap area there was a lot more
it's<00:01:36.270> just<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:37.230> arm<00:01:38.330> the<00:01:39.330> the<00:01:40.400> micron<00:01:41.400> of<00:01:41.430> the

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
it's just the arm the the micron of the

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.300 
it's just the arm the the micron of the
filters<00:01:42.060> pretty<00:01:42.780> big<00:01:43.020> and<00:01:43.260> most<00:01:43.830> of<00:01:43.980> the<00:01:44.070> peeps

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
filters pretty big and most of the peeps

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.430 
filters pretty big and most of the peeps
has<00:01:44.670> just<00:01:44.970> went<00:01:45.210> straight<00:01:45.600> through<00:01:45.630> the

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:46.440 
has just went straight through the

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.610 
has just went straight through the
filter<00:01:46.860> I<00:01:47.100> mean<00:01:47.700> it<00:01:48.170> doesn't<00:01:49.170> look<00:01:49.290> like<00:01:49.320> it

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:49.620 
filter I mean it doesn't look like it

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:52.640 
filter I mean it doesn't look like it
was<00:01:49.860> damaged<00:01:50.430> I<00:01:50.640> had<00:01:50.880> like<00:01:51.720> I<00:01:51.990> thought<00:01:52.440> it<00:01:52.530> was

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:52.650 
was damaged I had like I thought it was

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:54.530 
was damaged I had like I thought it was
going<00:01:52.770> to<00:01:52.800> melt<00:01:53.190> possibly<00:01:54.060> because<00:01:54.360> the

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
going to melt possibly because the

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.070 
going to melt possibly because the
cooling<00:01:54.900> levels<00:01:55.460> so<00:01:56.460> but<00:01:57.240> they<00:01:57.510> you<00:01:57.630> see<00:01:57.840> and

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.080 
cooling levels so but they you see and

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.230 
cooling levels so but they you see and
there<00:01:58.620> was<00:01:58.740> a<00:01:58.770> lot<00:01:58.979> more<00:01:59.010> than<00:01:59.220> that<00:01:59.580> it's<00:01:59.910> just

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
there was a lot more than that it's just

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:09.740 
there was a lot more than that it's just
it<00:02:00.479> went<00:02:00.690> through<00:02:00.960> most<00:02:01.950> of<00:02:02.100> it<00:02:02.220> so<00:02:02.750> um<00:02:07.250> so<00:02:08.750> what

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
it went through most of it so um so what

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:15.199 
it went through most of it so um so what
I<00:02:09.780> decided<00:02:10.170> to<00:02:10.290> do<00:02:10.440> is<00:02:10.679> by<00:02:13.040> paper<00:02:14.040> filter<00:02:14.430> not

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
I decided to do is by paper filter not

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:17.600 
I decided to do is by paper filter not
to<00:02:15.330> keep<00:02:15.450> it<00:02:15.570> in<00:02:15.660> permanently<00:02:16.170> but<00:02:16.410> just<00:02:16.980> so

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
to keep it in permanently but just so

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.370 
to keep it in permanently but just so
the<00:02:17.760> system<00:02:18.150> could<00:02:18.330> maybe<00:02:18.510> filter<00:02:18.959> out<00:02:19.110> some

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
the system could maybe filter out some

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.100 
the system could maybe filter out some
of<00:02:19.440> that<00:02:19.590> rock<00:02:19.950> stuff<00:02:20.310> like<00:02:21.209> substance<00:02:21.840> I<00:02:21.959> have

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
of that rock stuff like substance I have

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.960 
of that rock stuff like substance I have
no<00:02:22.230> idea<00:02:22.500> what<00:02:22.650> it<00:02:22.740> is<00:02:22.890> this<00:02:23.520> was<00:02:23.730> the<00:02:23.820> door

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
no idea what it is this was the door

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.940 
no idea what it is this was the door

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
radiator hose which is Prestone

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.420 
radiator hose which is Prestone
radiative<00:02:42.810> or<00:02:42.930> overflow<00:02:43.290> tube<00:02:43.830> and<00:02:44.010> don't<00:02:44.190> use

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
radiative or overflow tube and don't use

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.630 
radiative or overflow tube and don't use
fuel<00:02:44.880> lines<00:02:45.120> because<00:02:45.560> these<00:02:46.560> lines<00:02:46.920> would

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
fuel lines because these lines would

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.160 
fuel lines because these lines would
stand<00:02:48.209> heat<00:02:48.450> a<00:02:48.480> lot<00:02:48.690> better<00:02:48.900> um<00:02:49.350> and<00:02:51.019> was<00:02:52.019> it

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
stand heat a lot better um and was it

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:53.990 
stand heat a lot better um and was it
what<00:02:52.530> I<00:02:52.560> did<00:02:52.739> was<00:02:52.860> I<00:02:52.890> connected<00:02:53.459> this<00:02:53.550> port<00:02:53.850> off

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
what I did was I connected this port off

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.240 
what I did was I connected this port off
which<00:02:54.390> was<00:02:54.630> which<00:02:55.440> goes<00:02:55.650> to<00:02:55.800> the<00:02:55.890> overflow

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
which was which goes to the overflow

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:02.120 
which was which goes to the overflow
tank<00:02:56.459> and<00:02:56.810> I<00:02:57.810> installed<00:03:00.500> this<00:03:01.500> piece<00:03:01.800> here

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
tank and I installed this piece here

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:09.440 
tank and I installed this piece here
basically<00:03:03.260> this<00:03:04.260> here<00:03:04.950> and<00:03:06.500> here<00:03:07.500> and<00:03:08.420> while<00:03:09.420> I

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
basically this here and here and while I

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:14.630 
basically this here and here and while I
was<00:03:09.840> pretty<00:03:10.340> cool<00:03:11.450> but<00:03:12.450> um<00:03:12.690> one<00:03:13.350> thing<00:03:13.590> is<00:03:13.800> when

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
was pretty cool but um one thing is when

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.250 
was pretty cool but um one thing is when
you<00:03:14.730> install<00:03:15.060> the<00:03:15.150> system<00:03:15.540> there<00:03:15.989> will<00:03:16.200> be

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
you install the system there will be

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:17.479 
you install the system there will be
lots<00:03:16.800> of<00:03:16.890> air<00:03:17.100> in<00:03:17.220> it

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
lots of air in it

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:20.330 
lots of air in it
and<00:03:18.200> what<00:03:19.200> I<00:03:19.230> recommend<00:03:19.709> you<00:03:19.739> doing<00:03:19.920> actually

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
and what I recommend you doing actually

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:21.740 
and what I recommend you doing actually
after<00:03:20.610> you<00:03:20.640> take<00:03:20.850> the<00:03:20.970> sample<00:03:21.180> of<00:03:21.570> the

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
after you take the sample of the

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:27.620 
after you take the sample of the
radiator<00:03:22.110> fuel<00:03:22.830> I<00:03:23.360> recommend<00:03:24.360> you<00:03:26.000> since<00:03:27.000> this

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
radiator fuel I recommend you since this

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:31.340 
radiator fuel I recommend you since this
hat<00:03:27.840> does<00:03:28.019> not<00:03:28.230> have<00:03:28.440> a<00:03:28.700> radiator<00:03:29.700> cap<00:03:30.110> it<00:03:31.110> only

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
hat does not have a radiator cap it only

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:33.320 
hat does not have a radiator cap it only
has<00:03:31.500> an<00:03:31.620> overflow<00:03:31.830> tank<00:03:32.220> what<00:03:32.580> you<00:03:32.730> should<00:03:33.090> do

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.330 
has an overflow tank what you should do

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:34.610 
has an overflow tank what you should do
is

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
is

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:40.309 
is
open<00:03:35.550> this<00:03:35.670> up<00:03:36.890> and<00:03:38.150> as<00:03:39.150> you<00:03:39.840> can<00:03:39.989> see<00:03:40.170> that

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:40.319 
open this up and as you can see that

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:41.839 
open this up and as you can see that
little<00:03:40.530> piece<00:03:40.800> right<00:03:40.920> there<00:03:41.190> that's<00:03:41.340> actually

00:03:41.839 --> 00:03:41.849 
little piece right there that's actually

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:45.680 
little piece right there that's actually
the<00:03:42.660> overflow<00:03:43.319> like<00:03:43.950> on<00:03:44.190> the<00:03:45.000> burping<00:03:45.330> method

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
the overflow like on the burping method

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:47.720 
the overflow like on the burping method
I<00:03:45.930> guess<00:03:46.230> you<00:03:46.349> can<00:03:46.470> call<00:03:46.500> it<00:03:46.769> what<00:03:47.250> it<00:03:47.280> is<00:03:47.370> took

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
I guess you can call it what it is took

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.190 
I guess you can call it what it is took
a<00:03:47.790> little<00:03:48.000> funnel<00:03:48.300> and<00:03:48.569> a<00:03:49.379> little<00:03:50.220> piece<00:03:50.760> of

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:51.200 
a little funnel and a little piece of

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.960 
a little funnel and a little piece of
radiated<00:03:52.200> tubing<00:03:52.500> and<00:03:52.680> I<00:03:53.400> connected<00:03:53.849> it<00:03:53.940> to

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
radiated tubing and I connected it to

00:03:53.970 --> 00:04:01.490 
radiated tubing and I connected it to
this<00:03:54.209> and<00:03:55.160> I<00:03:57.230> was<00:03:58.340> siphoning<00:03:59.340> to<00:03:59.849> a<00:04:00.500> fluent

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
this and I was siphoning to a fluent

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:06.110 
this and I was siphoning to a fluent
coolant<00:04:02.660> from<00:04:03.660> here<00:04:04.019> and<00:04:04.400> I<00:04:05.400> was<00:04:05.730> basically

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
coolant from here and I was basically

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:11.979 
coolant from here and I was basically
putting<00:04:07.049> it<00:04:07.290> in<00:04:07.440> this<00:04:07.650> and<00:04:09.079> releasing<00:04:10.079> it<00:04:10.200> and

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:11.989 
putting it in this and releasing it and

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:15.050 
putting it in this and releasing it and
this<00:04:12.989> actually<00:04:13.680> took<00:04:14.400> out<00:04:14.579> a<00:04:14.610> lot<00:04:14.849> of<00:04:14.880> the

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
this actually took out a lot of the

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:20.150 
this actually took out a lot of the
bubbles<00:04:15.390> and<00:04:18.109> yeah<00:04:19.109> you<00:04:19.169> don't<00:04:19.440> want<00:04:19.590> to<00:04:19.680> you

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
bubbles and yeah you don't want to you

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.259 
bubbles and yeah you don't want to you
don't<00:04:20.190> want<00:04:20.430> to<00:04:20.489> have<00:04:20.579> an<00:04:20.700> empty<00:04:20.850> radiator

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:21.269 
don't want to have an empty radiator

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:24.650 
don't want to have an empty radiator
when<00:04:21.450> you<00:04:21.510> start<00:04:21.720> to<00:04:21.810> vehicle<00:04:22.200> and<00:04:23.330> um<00:04:24.330> after

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
when you start to vehicle and um after

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.659 
when you start to vehicle and um after
you<00:04:24.900> do<00:04:25.169> this<00:04:25.380> I<00:04:25.650> just<00:04:25.800> opened<00:04:26.370> it<00:04:26.400> from<00:04:26.580> the

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:26.669 
you do this I just opened it from the

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:29.330 
you do this I just opened it from the
overflow<00:04:26.910> tank<00:04:27.240> because<00:04:27.810> it<00:04:28.080> was<00:04:28.340> overflowing

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
overflow tank because it was overflowing

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.100 
overflow tank because it was overflowing
anyway<00:04:29.729> it<00:04:29.910> was<00:04:30.030> there<00:04:30.450> was<00:04:30.539> too<00:04:30.690> much<00:04:30.810> fuel

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
anyway it was there was too much fuel

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:34.730 
anyway it was there was too much fuel
was<00:04:31.380> we<00:04:31.590> passed<00:04:31.860> above<00:04:32.190> line<00:04:32.400> so<00:04:33.330> and<00:04:33.960> then

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
was we passed above line so and then

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:37.180 
was we passed above line so and then
what<00:04:35.310> you<00:04:35.430> do<00:04:35.550> is<00:04:35.699> you<00:04:35.820> can<00:04:35.940> take<00:04:36.090> this<00:04:36.240> off<00:04:36.449> a

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:37.190 
what you do is you can take this off a

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:44.180 
what you do is you can take this off a
peaceful<00:04:38.190> rolls<00:04:38.580> off<00:04:38.850> and<00:04:41.690> reattach<00:04:43.190> just

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:44.190 
peaceful rolls off and reattach just

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:47.030 
peaceful rolls off and reattach just
like<00:04:44.400> the<00:04:44.520> fuel<00:04:44.729> filter
