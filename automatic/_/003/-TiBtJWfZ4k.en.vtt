blood I guess when you cut yourself
blood<00:02:27.330> gets<00:02:27.540> redder<00:02:27.870> it<00:02:28.110> gets<00:02:28.260> denser<00:02:28.739> so<00:02:29.430> yeah

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
blood gets redder it gets denser so yeah

trying to prove today when we're trying

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
to see if it retains its flavor if you

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:01.340 
to see if it retains its flavor if you
aged<00:02:59.100> the<00:02:59.580> beef<00:02:59.790> it<00:03:00.150> stays<00:03:00.630> as<00:03:00.900> fresh<00:03:01.140> as<00:03:01.290> it

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
aged the beef it stays as fresh as it

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:02.870 
aged the beef it stays as fresh as it
was<00:03:01.590> when<00:03:01.860> you<00:03:01.890> first<00:03:02.190> bottom<00:03:02.700> out<00:03:02.760> of<00:03:02.790> the

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
was when you first bottom out of the

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.610 
was when you first bottom out of the
store<00:03:03.180> instead<00:03:03.720> of<00:03:03.810> having<00:03:03.930> a<00:03:04.080> package<00:03:04.470> and

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
store instead of having a package and

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.460 
store instead of having a package and
wrapped<00:03:04.830> up<00:03:05.040> so<00:03:05.340> this<00:03:05.970> one<00:03:06.239> I<00:03:06.480> think<00:03:06.630> it<00:03:07.200> looks

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
wrapped up so this one I think it looks

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.140 
wrapped up so this one I think it looks
like<00:03:07.590> it's<00:03:07.739> gonna<00:03:07.860> bleed<00:03:08.370> out<00:03:08.400> so<00:03:08.819> it<00:03:08.940> may<00:03:09.120> be

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
like it's gonna bleed out so it may be

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.020 
like it's gonna bleed out so it may be
just<00:03:09.510> as<00:03:10.110> fresh<00:03:10.290> as<00:03:10.410> that<00:03:10.560> one<00:03:10.709> Wow<00:03:11.370> so

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
just as fresh as that one Wow so

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.270 
just as fresh as that one Wow so
basically<00:03:12.810> don't<00:03:13.110> you<00:03:13.410> pay<00:03:13.560> like<00:03:13.769> a<00:03:13.799> premium

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
basically don't you pay like a premium

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.130
