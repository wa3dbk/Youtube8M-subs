00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.569
 and so we continue to repair the engine m-72 

00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:12.960
 k750 in the Urals of exactly the same design 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:15.320
 and in this video you will need to remove 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.320
 bearing 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:21.240
 rock on the trees the thing is here for 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.960
 puller hinders a little 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:27.720
 This is an oil centrifuge that delivers 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:32.759
 the oil in the bottom head of the connecting rod and the 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:37.649
 most grease without damage it 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:44.040
 centers he will not manage here I am selling 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:49.190
 insert puller and clings to this column 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.190
 now I knock them 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.140
 preferably crankshaft put so that 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.809
 connecting rods 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:01:04.219
 heads were on the edges so much easier then 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:04.219
 will arch this centrifuge cup 

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:28.360
 started as paws 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:45.240
 everything is fine all lies we can not buy with 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:48.240
 this side so much as a puller with two 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:54.300
 paws under the microphone and flatten face 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:57.560
 two places less twist puller two 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:02:08.130
 ball of suitable diameter 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:45.750
 Equally we must also establish 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:53.870
 knock and pull if more pops up 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:57.930
 we will beat but only for the sake of 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:03:00.200
 off the ground has moved characteristic 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.200
 sound 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.930
 moron 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:27.650
 here is still shiba 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:28.420
 oil costs a little delay new 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.670
 bearings 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.510
 which I took them already from this side 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:34.220
 are closed 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:38.450
 if this side closed necessarily 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:46.750
 one side needs to open and this side 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:49.069
 it will be like a gland thus a little 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:52.190
 delays the oil so as not to drive through 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:59.060
 seals more detailed colleagues on worth 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:59.980
 Here is such a foam Majid in the Urals 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:05.329
 already 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:09.590
 gland I have said here you can take 

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:10.989
 bearing seems 50 to 70 well yes should 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:14.720
 specify 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:17.120
 my opponent gland cut to the side and 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:19.389
 set the gland on this side or on 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.389
 this 

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:30.080
 bearing we will still be new 

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:35.599
 chest on these old engines 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:38.030
 m-72 k750 and the Urals which m61 

00:04:35.599 --> 00:04:40.539
 m-62 design and not provided 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:42.710
 installation of paper oil filter 

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:47.630
 which is there in the front engine cover 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:50.479
 the bottom is set and here is the oil 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:54.830
 Only the receiving mesh is filtered 

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:59.000
 on oil us 8 which is set as 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:05:01.789
 oil poured any that not only 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:06.650
 get a lot of trash hit 

00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:07.190
 inside and the tube scored here and and here 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:11.840
 visible and 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:12.950
 a lot of plus we got mud here like 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:18.200
 clay such 

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:26.360
 and she completely around the circle this here 

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:29.030
 half scored and here's a hole 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:32.810
 here the oil gets under the action 

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:34.490
 centrifugal force she she lubricates 

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:38.530
 connecting rod bottom 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:43.670
 and when here everything is clogged naturally 

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:47.750
 bearing suffers fails 

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:52.720
 Now, as before, they usually twisted 

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:57.830
 screwdriver and visible marks on the core they 

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:59.300
 just about the side of the garbage something is not 

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:04.280
 unscrew these screws 

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:04.750
 there are three of them now clamps 

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:08.450
 threading 

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:10.220
 before this was not and can be on the core 

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:12.820
 need not suffer but now 

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:17.020
 somehow unscrew these screws 

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:24.470
 an ordinary screwdriver to do it 

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:29.260
 almost went one went practically 

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:36.790
 unrealistic in some cases not calling 

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:41.260
 some unlucky try shock 

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:48.260
 Gate screwdriver of previous videos I already 

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:52.670
 showed or put into action and very well 

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:54.940
 unscrew the screws 

00:06:52.670 --> 00:07:05.050
 clutch 

00:06:54.940 --> 00:07:10.130
 6 screws in this way 

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:14.770
 disconnect pull and show how much there for 

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:14.770
 many years to dug in the dirt 

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:44.669
 Here it is, this clay can be leveled 

00:07:40.319 --> 00:07:47.490
 then install the old need to clean 

00:07:44.669 --> 00:07:51.620
 Yes, and a number or such is full of sale 

00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:59.120
 they from the Urals seems the same as on 

00:07:51.620 --> 00:08:02.120
 touched 50 or m-72 on it all 

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:02.120
 until
