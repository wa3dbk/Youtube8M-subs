that<00:00:46.739> you<00:00:46.829> think<00:00:47.069> about<00:00:47.190> for<00:00:47.429> a<00:00:47.489> while<00:00:47.609> you're

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
that you think about for a while you're

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
then I cut back I think I would have had

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.239

the pressure kind of just goes out the
window<00:01:40.179> at<00:01:40.420> that<00:01:40.509> point<00:01:40.810> it's<00:01:40.990> just<00:01:41.170> kind<00:01:41.530> of

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
window at that point it's just kind of

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.200 
window at that point it's just kind of
free<00:01:41.860> surfing<00:01:42.310> and<00:01:42.429> I<00:01:42.610> think<00:01:42.850> that's<00:01:43.000> kind<00:01:43.179> of

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.210 
free surfing and I think that's kind of

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:44.669 
free surfing and I think that's kind of
like<00:01:43.329> the<00:01:43.539> best<00:01:43.780> time<00:01:44.049> do<00:01:44.200> you<00:01:44.259> have<00:01:44.289> in<00:01:44.560> a

like the best time do you have in a

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:45.929 
like the best time do you have in a
contest<00:01:45.039> is<00:01:45.189> when<00:01:45.340> the<00:01:45.429> waves<00:01:45.549> are<00:01:45.670> good<00:01:45.820> like
