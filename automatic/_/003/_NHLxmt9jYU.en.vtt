00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.010 
infilled strings actually feel different
than<00:02:05.350> the<00:02:05.910> elixirs<00:02:06.910> or<00:02:07.150> the<00:02:07.270> Martins<00:02:07.810> D

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.800 
than the elixirs or the Martins D
Dario's<00:02:08.410> these<00:02:08.679> normal<00:02:09.670> kind<00:02:10.000> of<00:02:10.060> strings<00:02:10.600> you

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
Dario's these normal kind of strings you

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.540 
Dario's these normal kind of strings you
just<00:02:11.050> don't<00:02:11.200> have<00:02:11.350> as<00:02:11.470> much<00:02:11.590> tension<00:02:11.980> so<00:02:12.430> like

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
just don't have as much tension so like

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.930 
just don't have as much tension so like
if<00:02:12.700> you<00:02:12.760> go<00:02:12.880> to<00:02:12.910> Bend

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.120 

they're<00:02:17.940> easier<00:02:18.360> to<00:02:18.420> bend<00:02:18.780> um<00:02:19.110> and<00:02:19.800> then<00:02:20.100> also

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
they're easier to bend um and then also

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.880 
they're easier to bend um and then also
when<00:02:20.610> you're<00:02:20.700> playing<00:02:20.880> bar<00:02:21.180> chords<00:02:21.890> though

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
when you're playing bar chords though

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.550 
when you're playing bar chords though
they<00:02:23.100> are<00:02:23.250> still<00:02:23.600> still<00:02:24.600> you<00:02:24.900> know<00:02:25.020> steel

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
they are still still you know steel

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.370 
they are still still you know steel
strings<00:02:25.890> they<00:02:26.340> don't<00:02:26.700> feel<00:02:27.270> as<00:02:27.630> difficult<00:02:28.230> to

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
strings they don't feel as difficult to

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.140 
strings they don't feel as difficult to
press<00:02:28.650> down<00:02:28.980> so<00:02:29.430> that's<00:02:29.640> the<00:02:29.790> other<00:02:29.880> thing

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
press down so that's the other thing

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.010 
press down so that's the other thing
that<00:02:30.180> I<00:02:30.330> really<00:02:30.600> like<00:02:30.780> about<00:02:30.810> them<00:02:32.810> so<00:02:33.810> you're

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
that I really like about them so you're

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.210 
that I really like about them so you're
having<00:02:34.140> a<00:02:34.290> lot<00:02:34.380> of<00:02:34.500> trouble<00:02:34.830> you're<00:02:34.980> doing

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
having a lot of trouble you're doing

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.300 
having a lot of trouble you're doing
lots<00:02:35.430> of<00:02:35.610> practicing<00:02:36.180> with<00:02:36.390> steel<00:02:36.780> strings

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
lots of practicing with steel strings

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.830 
lots of practicing with steel strings
and<00:02:38.310> your<00:02:38.490> fingers<00:02:38.850> are<00:02:38.970> getting<00:02:39.060> super<00:02:39.450> tired

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
and your fingers are getting super tired

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.840 
and your fingers are getting super tired
which<00:02:40.200> they<00:02:40.410> do<00:02:40.470> we're<00:02:40.920> not<00:02:41.010> practicing<00:02:41.160> with

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
which they do we're not practicing with

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.660 
which they do we're not practicing with
acoustic<00:02:42.360> guitar<00:02:43.010> you<00:02:44.010> might<00:02:44.220> want<00:02:44.400> to<00:02:44.430> try

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
acoustic guitar you might want to try

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.100 
acoustic guitar you might want to try
these<00:02:44.730> just<00:02:45.420> because<00:02:45.660> you<00:02:45.750> might<00:02:45.900> get<00:02:46.080> a

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
these just because you might get a

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:47.780 
these just because you might get a
little<00:02:46.290> bit<00:02:46.500> more<00:02:46.710> practice<00:02:47.220> time<00:02:47.430> out<00:02:47.640> of

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
little bit more practice time out of

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.050 
little bit more practice time out of
your<00:02:47.970> hands<00:02:48.510> before<00:02:48.840> they<00:02:49.200> get<00:02:49.550> tired<00:02:50.550> only

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
your hands before they get tired only

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.940 
your hands before they get tired only
problems<00:02:51.720> I<00:02:51.960> would<00:02:52.140> say<00:02:52.290> with<00:02:52.500> these<00:02:52.650> strings

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
problems I would say with these strings

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.060 
problems I would say with these strings
are<00:02:53.160> that<00:02:53.580> the<00:02:54.180> low<00:02:54.720> E<00:02:54.930> string<00:02:54.990> is<00:02:55.650> thicker

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
are that the low E string is thicker

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:59.180 
are that the low E string is thicker
than<00:02:56.220> most<00:02:56.700> low<00:02:57.150> E<00:02:57.450> strings<00:02:57.780> has<00:02:57.990> a<00:02:58.190> longer

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
than most low E strings has a longer

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.570 
than most low E strings has a longer
diameter<00:02:59.910> diameter<00:03:00.210> than<00:03:01.080> most<00:03:01.590> low<00:03:02.280> E

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
diameter diameter than most low E

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.270 
diameter diameter than most low E
strings<00:03:02.940> so<00:03:03.240> it<00:03:03.390> doesn't<00:03:03.720> quite<00:03:03.990> fit<00:03:04.380> in<00:03:04.620> my

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
strings so it doesn't quite fit in my

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.850 
strings so it doesn't quite fit in my
nut<00:03:05.580> right<00:03:06.000> here<00:03:06.300> so<00:03:06.660> it<00:03:06.780> fits<00:03:06.990> okay<00:03:07.470> like<00:03:07.740> it

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
nut right here so it fits okay like it

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.230 
nut right here so it fits okay like it
still<00:03:08.070> kind<00:03:08.310> of<00:03:08.340> gets<00:03:08.550> in<00:03:08.670> there<00:03:08.790> but<00:03:08.970> it's<00:03:09.090> not

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:09.240 
still kind of gets in there but it's not

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.270 
still kind of gets in there but it's not
a<00:03:09.270> hundred<00:03:09.570> percent<00:03:10.050> in<00:03:10.200> there<00:03:10.410> like<00:03:10.920> all<00:03:11.160> the

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
a hundred percent in there like all the

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.130 
a hundred percent in there like all the
other<00:03:11.400> strings<00:03:11.640> all<00:03:11.850> the<00:03:12.000> other<00:03:12.120> ones<00:03:12.360> on<00:03:12.570> you

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
other strings all the other ones on you

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.380 
other strings all the other ones on you
know<00:03:13.260> that<00:03:13.530> II<00:03:13.740> threw<00:03:14.040> the<00:03:14.190> a<00:03:14.400> string<00:03:15.060> they're

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
know that II threw the a string they're

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.360 
know that II threw the a string they're
fine<00:03:15.690> they<00:03:15.900> fit<00:03:16.110> right<00:03:16.290> into<00:03:16.440> the<00:03:16.650> nut<00:03:16.830> but

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
fine they fit right into the nut but

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:20.120 
fine they fit right into the nut but
that<00:03:17.580> um<00:03:18.080> you<00:03:19.080> know<00:03:19.170> that<00:03:19.320> low<00:03:19.560> e<00:03:19.770> doesn't

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
that um you know that low e doesn't

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:21.830 
that um you know that low e doesn't
quite<00:03:20.250> fit<00:03:20.520> into<00:03:20.730> the<00:03:20.850> nut<00:03:21.150> so<00:03:21.330> that<00:03:21.360> could<00:03:21.690> be

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
quite fit into the nut so that could be

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.940 
quite fit into the nut so that could be
a<00:03:21.870> problem<00:03:22.140> on<00:03:23.070> your<00:03:23.310> guitar<00:03:24.530> so<00:03:25.530> the<00:03:25.800> other

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
a problem on your guitar so the other

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:27.980 
a problem on your guitar so the other
thing<00:03:26.280> there<00:03:26.520> was<00:03:26.670> a<00:03:26.700> kind<00:03:27.000> of<00:03:27.030> a<00:03:27.180> problem<00:03:27.540> with

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:27.990 
thing there was a kind of a problem with

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:30.280 
thing there was a kind of a problem with
them<00:03:28.110> is<00:03:28.260> that<00:03:28.470> they<00:03:28.950> don't<00:03:29.280> hold<00:03:29.610> their

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
them is that they don't hold their

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:33.860 
them is that they don't hold their
intonation<00:03:31.490> quite<00:03:32.490> as<00:03:32.700> fast<00:03:33.030> as<00:03:33.330> most<00:03:33.540> strings

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
intonation quite as fast as most strings

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.600 
intonation quite as fast as most strings
so<00:03:34.020> most<00:03:34.260> rings<00:03:34.590> have<00:03:34.740> it<00:03:34.830> put<00:03:34.980> on<00:03:35.010> a<00:03:35.100> new<00:03:35.340> set

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
so most rings have it put on a new set

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:37.490 
so most rings have it put on a new set
after<00:03:35.880> a<00:03:36.030> couple<00:03:36.300> hours<00:03:36.540> they're<00:03:37.140> pretty<00:03:37.350> much

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
after a couple hours they're pretty much

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.350 
after a couple hours they're pretty much
just<00:03:37.560> like<00:03:38.040> solid<00:03:38.580> they<00:03:38.730> hold<00:03:39.180> their

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
just like solid they hold their

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.290 
just like solid they hold their
intonation<00:03:39.720> but<00:03:40.410> these<00:03:41.160> strings<00:03:41.700> it<00:03:42.030> took<00:03:42.180> me

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:42.300 
intonation but these strings it took me

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.630 
intonation but these strings it took me
about<00:03:42.450> two<00:03:42.810> days<00:03:43.020> before<00:03:43.410> they<00:03:44.340> really

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
about two days before they really

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.280 
about two days before they really
started<00:03:44.970> to<00:03:45.060> hold<00:03:45.300> their<00:03:45.510> intonation<00:03:45.750> and

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
started to hold their intonation and

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.200 
started to hold their intonation and
weren't<00:03:46.590> going<00:03:46.860> out<00:03:46.980> of<00:03:47.130> tune<00:03:47.370> so<00:03:47.850> they<00:03:47.970> take<00:03:48.180> a

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:48.210 
weren't going out of tune so they take a

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:50.030 
weren't going out of tune so they take a
little<00:03:48.510> bit<00:03:48.630> longer<00:03:48.960> to<00:03:49.260> kind<00:03:49.470> of<00:03:49.560> like<00:03:49.710> stay

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
little bit longer to kind of like stay

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.820 
little bit longer to kind of like stay
in<00:03:50.070> tune<00:03:50.460> I<00:03:50.610> noticed<00:03:51.000> then<00:03:51.630> than<00:03:52.170> most<00:03:52.410> strings

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:52.830 
in tune I noticed then than most strings

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:55.040 
in tune I noticed then than most strings
that<00:03:53.310> said<00:03:53.640> to<00:03:54.060> me<00:03:54.240> it's<00:03:54.420> kind<00:03:54.600> of<00:03:54.630> worth<00:03:54.870> it

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.050 
that said to me it's kind of worth it

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:56.600 
that said to me it's kind of worth it
because<00:03:55.200> I<00:03:55.320> like<00:03:55.650> the<00:03:55.890> sound<00:03:56.040> of<00:03:56.220> this<00:03:56.310> low<00:03:56.580> E

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:56.610 
because I like the sound of this low E

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:59.300 
because I like the sound of this low E
it's<00:03:57.030> like<00:03:57.180> a<00:03:57.210> thicker<00:03:57.600> low<00:03:57.930> E<00:03:58.110> string<00:03:58.220> but<00:03:59.220> it

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
it's like a thicker low E string but it

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:00.890 
it's like a thicker low E string but it
seems<00:03:59.520> to<00:03:59.700> have<00:03:59.850> a<00:03:59.880> little<00:04:00.120> bit<00:04:00.330> more<00:04:00.630> like

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
seems to have a little bit more like

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.600 
seems to have a little bit more like
bottom<00:04:01.410> to<00:04:01.560> it<00:04:01.680> because<00:04:01.980> of<00:04:02.010> that<00:04:02.250> thickness

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.610 
bottom to it because of that thickness

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:04.970 
bottom to it because of that thickness
and<00:04:03.000> then<00:04:03.480> the<00:04:03.630> fact<00:04:03.870> that<00:04:03.990> they're<00:04:04.530> not<00:04:04.650> quite

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
and then the fact that they're not quite

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:06.830 
and then the fact that they're not quite
as<00:04:05.130> difficult<00:04:05.280> to<00:04:05.670> press<00:04:05.910> down<00:04:06.120> as<00:04:06.360> normal

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
as difficult to press down as normal

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.390 
as difficult to press down as normal
steel<00:04:07.080> strings<00:04:07.440> kind<00:04:07.710> of<00:04:07.770> made<00:04:07.920> that<00:04:08.040> a<00:04:08.100> plus

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
steel strings kind of made that a plus

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.550 
steel strings kind of made that a plus
for<00:04:08.610> me<00:04:08.640> I'm<00:04:09.120> glad<00:04:09.360> that<00:04:09.540> I<00:04:09.600> bought<00:04:09.780> them<00:04:10.020> for

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
for me I'm glad that I bought them for

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.740 
for me I'm glad that I bought them for
25<00:04:10.890> bucks<00:04:11.070> it<00:04:11.280> was<00:04:11.370> worth<00:04:11.550> it<00:04:11.790> well<00:04:12.450> I'd<00:04:12.510> buy

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
25 bucks it was worth it well I'd buy

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:14.810 
25 bucks it was worth it well I'd buy
another<00:04:13.020> pair<00:04:13.320> yeah<00:04:14.040> actually<00:04:14.220> I<00:04:14.430> think<00:04:14.550> I'd<00:04:14.790> I

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:14.820 
another pair yeah actually I think I'd I

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:16.400 
another pair yeah actually I think I'd I
will<00:04:15.090> I'm<00:04:15.300> kind<00:04:15.480> of<00:04:15.510> kind<00:04:15.810> of<00:04:15.900> getting<00:04:16.140> used<00:04:16.290> to

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
will I'm kind of kind of getting used to

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:19.910 
will I'm kind of kind of getting used to
these<00:04:16.590> now<00:04:16.859> so<00:04:17.100> I<00:04:17.130> might<00:04:17.580> stick<00:04:18.480> with<00:04:18.660> these<00:04:18.920> at

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:19.920 
these now so I might stick with these at

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:22.310 
these now so I might stick with these at
least<00:04:20.100> for<00:04:20.250> the<00:04:20.310> time<00:04:20.340> being<00:04:21.080> they're<00:04:22.080> not<00:04:22.200> to

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
least for the time being they're not to

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:23.810 
least for the time being they're not to
the<00:04:22.410> point<00:04:22.590> that<00:04:22.680> I'm<00:04:22.770> like<00:04:22.919> I<00:04:23.070> have<00:04:23.430> to<00:04:23.669> have

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
the point that I'm like I have to have

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.910 
the point that I'm like I have to have
these<00:04:24.090> like<00:04:24.479> but

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:25.920 
these like but

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:27.470 
these like but
I<00:04:25.980> think<00:04:26.520> it's<00:04:26.610> probably<00:04:26.820> worth<00:04:27.060> it<00:04:27.270> to<00:04:27.360> me

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:27.480 
I think it's probably worth it to me

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:28.910 
I think it's probably worth it to me
because<00:04:27.570> I<00:04:27.750> kind<00:04:27.930> of<00:04:27.960> like<00:04:28.080> the<00:04:28.230> lower<00:04:28.410> tension

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:28.920 
because I kind of like the lower tension

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.610 
because I kind of like the lower tension
