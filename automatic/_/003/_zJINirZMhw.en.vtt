we are right now we're making it from a

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.080 
we are right now we're making it from a
mortgage<00:02:28.680> standpoint<00:02:29.370> we're<00:02:29.640> keeping<00:02:29.970> the

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.449 
mortgage standpoint we're keeping the
bills<00:02:30.299> paid<00:02:30.599> but<00:02:31.260> it<00:02:31.470> is<00:02:31.590> a<00:02:31.620> very<00:02:32.069> difficult

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
bills paid but it is a very difficult

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:34.400 
bills paid but it is a very difficult
process<00:02:32.910> we<00:02:33.390> choose<00:02:33.720> at<00:02:33.959> the<00:02:34.080> end<00:02:34.200> of<00:02:34.319> the

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
process we choose at the end of the

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.199 
process we choose at the end of the
month<00:02:34.650> how<00:02:35.280> much<00:02:35.489> of<00:02:35.670> which<00:02:35.849> we're<00:02:36.030> going<00:02:36.150> to

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
pay because it's much more difficult to

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.949 
pay because it's much more difficult to
pay<00:02:37.980> the<00:02:38.130> entire<00:02:38.250> amount<00:02:38.459> now<00:02:39.030> I'm<00:02:39.480> starting

it's<00:04:09.430> I'm<00:04:09.760> not<00:04:10.030> going<00:04:10.269> to<00:04:10.420> make<00:04:10.540> anywhere<00:04:10.930> near

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 
it's I'm not going to make anywhere near

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.009 
it's I'm not going to make anywhere near
what<00:04:11.709> I<00:04:11.739> did<00:04:12.040> at<00:04:12.190> GM<00:04:13.060> and<00:04:13.269> I<00:04:13.330> and<00:04:13.600> I<00:04:13.660> know<00:04:13.690> that

00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:14.019 
what I did at GM and I and I know that

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:16.530 
what I did at GM and I and I know that
one<00:04:14.769> of<00:04:14.799> the<00:04:14.950> ways<00:04:15.100> I<00:04:15.280> look<00:04:15.459> at<00:04:15.640> it<00:04:15.790> and<00:04:15.970> and<00:04:16.299> I

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:16.540 
one of the ways I look at it and and I

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:17.879 
one of the ways I look at it and and I
think<00:04:16.959> it's<00:04:17.109> because<00:04:17.380> of<00:04:17.530> my<00:04:17.650> faith

00:04:17.879 --> 00:04:17.889 
think it's because of my faith

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:19.890 
think it's because of my faith
perspective<00:04:18.609> so<00:04:19.030> I<00:04:19.060> tell<00:04:19.359> people<00:04:19.690> all<00:04:19.780> the

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 
perspective so I tell people all the

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:21.659 
perspective so I tell people all the
time<00:04:19.959> don't<00:04:20.350> give<00:04:20.500> up<00:04:20.680> because<00:04:21.040> I<00:04:21.340> think<00:04:21.549> that

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:21.669 
time don't give up because I think that

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:23.010 
time don't give up because I think that
there's<00:04:21.850> some<00:04:22.030> shifting<00:04:22.450> that's<00:04:22.660> taking

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020 
there's some shifting that's taking

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:24.930 
there's some shifting that's taking
place<00:04:23.290> that<00:04:23.860> means<00:04:24.190> that<00:04:24.520> middle-income

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:24.940 
place that means that middle-income

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:27.360 
place that means that middle-income
people<00:04:25.180> and<00:04:25.720> and<00:04:26.260> lower-income<00:04:26.770> people<00:04:27.010> are

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.370 
people and and lower-income people are

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:28.830 
people and and lower-income people are
somehow<00:04:27.580> going<00:04:27.850> to<00:04:27.970> end<00:04:28.150> up<00:04:28.300> getting<00:04:28.570> a<00:04:28.660> bigger

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840 
somehow going to end up getting a bigger

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.540 
somehow going to end up getting a bigger
piece<00:04:29.080> of<00:04:29.110> the<00:04:29.229> pie<00:04:29.320> I<00:04:29.740> think<00:04:30.190> that<00:04:30.310> people<00:04:30.520> are

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550 
piece of the pie I think that people are

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:32.159 
piece of the pie I think that people are
going<00:04:30.700> to<00:04:30.790> get<00:04:30.880> so<00:04:31.060> frustrated<00:04:31.300> and<00:04:31.810> tired<00:04:31.870> of

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:32.169 
going to get so frustrated and tired of

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:34.170 
going to get so frustrated and tired of
this<00:04:32.350> whole<00:04:32.500> corporate<00:04:32.800> piece<00:04:33.280> that<00:04:33.970> this

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.180 
this whole corporate piece that this

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:35.760 
this whole corporate piece that this
great<00:04:34.510> shaking<00:04:34.810> up<00:04:35.080> is<00:04:35.260> going<00:04:35.500> to<00:04:35.560> cause

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:35.770 
great shaking up is going to cause

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:37.290 
great shaking up is going to cause
something<00:04:36.100> to<00:04:36.250> change<00:04:36.520> and<00:04:36.729> I<00:04:36.760> think<00:04:37.000> is<00:04:37.090> God's

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:37.300 
something to change and I think is God's

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:39.180 
something to change and I think is God's
Way<00:04:37.540> of<00:04:37.570> saying<00:04:37.690> don't<00:04:38.020> worry<00:04:38.200> about<00:04:38.530> I've<00:04:39.130> got

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:39.190 
Way of saying don't worry about I've got

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:42.029 
Way of saying don't worry about I've got
it<00:04:39.520> in<00:04:39.639> control<00:04:39.910> I'm<00:04:40.650> switching<00:04:41.650> some<00:04:41.800> stuff

00:04:42.029 --> 00:04:42.039 
it in control I'm switching some stuff

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:43.380 
it in control I'm switching some stuff
around<00:04:42.190> I<00:04:42.610> think<00:04:42.729> we're<00:04:42.940> going<00:04:43.030> to<00:04:43.090> go<00:04:43.210> through

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:43.390 
around I think we're going to go through

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:45.870 
around I think we're going to go through
a<00:04:43.419> rebuilding<00:04:43.990> process<00:04:44.200> and<00:04:44.740> I<00:04:45.430> think<00:04:45.729> we're

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:45.880 
a rebuilding process and I think we're

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:47.400 
a rebuilding process and I think we're
going<00:04:46.030> to<00:04:46.090> become<00:04:46.450> that<00:04:46.690> country<00:04:47.110> that<00:04:47.140> we

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:47.410 
going to become that country that we

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:51.030 
going to become that country that we
certainly<00:04:47.740> have<00:04:47.979> the<00:04:48.130> potential<00:04:48.460> to<00:04:48.610> become
