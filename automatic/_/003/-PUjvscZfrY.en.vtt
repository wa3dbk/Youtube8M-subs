than<00:02:18.070> Jimmy<00:02:18.400> or<00:02:18.490> whatever<00:02:18.790> but<00:02:19.030> I'm<00:02:19.450> sure<00:02:19.630> he

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
than Jimmy or whatever but I'm sure he

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.010 
than Jimmy or whatever but I'm sure he
had<00:02:19.930> another<00:02:20.170> gear<00:02:20.440> to<00:02:20.590> put<00:02:20.770> in<00:02:20.920> so<00:02:21.810> he<00:02:22.810> could

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.020 
had another gear to put in so he could

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:24.570 
had another gear to put in so he could
he<00:02:23.530> could<00:02:23.710> have<00:02:23.860> probably<00:02:24.220> won<00:02:24.400> a<00:02:24.430> little

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
he could have probably won a little

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.420 
he could have probably won a little
faster<00:02:24.910> but<00:02:25.440> but<00:02:26.440> I<00:02:26.680> mean<00:02:26.710> it's<00:02:26.950> good<00:02:27.100> to<00:02:27.220> be<00:02:27.340> in

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
faster but but I mean it's good to be in

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.000 
faster but but I mean it's good to be in
that<00:02:27.550> conversation<00:02:27.790> and<00:02:28.480> run<00:02:29.350> him<00:02:29.500> well<00:02:29.650> some

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
that conversation and run him well some

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:31.740 
that conversation and run him well some
middle<00:02:30.580> portion<00:02:30.880> of<00:02:30.970> the<00:02:31.030> race<00:02:31.210> you<00:02:31.630> were

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
you were much faster on the top could

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.360 
you were much faster on the top could
you<00:02:37.390> tell<00:02:37.570> that<00:02:37.600> oh<00:02:37.930> yeah<00:02:38.230> yeah<00:02:38.470> it's<00:02:38.650> just<00:02:38.860> the

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:42.820 
car is in a way that the track was his

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:46.320 
car is in a way that the track was his
unique<00:02:43.210> I<00:02:43.450> guess<00:02:43.630> you'd<00:02:43.840> say<00:02:43.900> it<00:02:44.350> did<00:02:45.330> the

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
bottom if you hit it right was fast but

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:49.440 
bottom if you hit it right was fast but
it's<00:02:48.280> hard<00:02:48.430> to<00:02:48.520> hit<00:02:48.670> it<00:02:48.820> right<00:02:48.850> and<00:02:49.150> hustled

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450
