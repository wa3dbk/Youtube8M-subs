00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.300
ARDEN MYRIN: What's
up, SpacesTV?

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:04.310
It's Arden Myrin, actress,
comedian, and

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:05.750
incredibly nosy, nosy girl.

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:08.580
And I'm in the East Village in
New York City, home to some of

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.470
the most colorful, interesting
people in the city.

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:14.700
And I want to see if I can find
a pretty crazy character

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:15.720
to take me home.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.083
Let's go fishing.

00:00:18.083 --> 00:00:21.380
Hey, do you wanna take--

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:23.492
do you wanna take me home?

00:00:23.492 --> 00:00:24.965
Would you take me home?

00:00:24.965 --> 00:00:26.438
MALE SPEAKER: Hell, no.

00:00:26.438 --> 00:00:26.929
Why?

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:30.366
ARDEN MYRIN: I wanna
see how you live.

00:00:30.366 --> 00:00:32.707
MALE SPEAKER: My
house is clean.

00:00:32.707 --> 00:00:33.174
ARDEN MYRIN: OK.

00:00:33.174 --> 00:00:35.042
You don't want a little
blonde girl to come

00:00:35.042 --> 00:00:35.980
hang out with you?

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:37.710
MALE SPEAKER: No.

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.850
ARDEN MYRIN: I think you might
be my soul sister.

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:40.565
ANGEL EYEDEALISM: Soul mate!

00:00:40.565 --> 00:00:41.690
Is that right?

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:42.410
What's your name?

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:43.152
ARDEN MYRIN: I'm Arden Myrin.

00:00:43.152 --> 00:00:43.760
What's your name?

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.296
ANGEL EYEDEALISM: I'm
Angel Eyedealism.

00:00:45.296 --> 00:00:45.880
ARDEN MYRIN: Oh my god.

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.090
You are spectacular.

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:50.220
Wow, OK.

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:51.820
ANGEL EYEDEALISM: I had nothing
to wear so I wore

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:52.080
everything.

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:53.535
ARDEN MYRIN: Oh my god,
I like your style.

00:00:53.535 --> 00:00:55.380
Do you live near here?

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.220
ANGEL EYEDEALISM: Well, I
live just up the street.

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:58.180
ARDEN MYRIN: Let me
ask you this.

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.670
I'm with SpacesTV and we want
to see how New Yorkers live.

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:02.910
You seem like a typical
New Yorker.

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:03.740
ANGEL EYEDEALISM: Oh, yeah.

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:06.440
ARDEN MYRIN: Would you be
willing to take me to your

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.280
home to see your apartment?

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.850
ANGEL EYEDEALISM: Well,
yes, of course.

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:11.250
ARDEN MYRIN: Oh my god, this
is going to be awesome.

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.420
I know it.

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.600
I'm picturing some space-age
stuff, that you have some,

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.050
like, hot butler that
waits on you--

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:19.740
ANGEL EYEDEALISM: Well, I do
have a hot super, but that's

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.710
at my other lair.

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.560
Well, I woke up today and went,
oh my god, nobody has

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:25.900
shot the plastic bubble.

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.015
ARDEN MYRIN: That is so--
that is so bizarre.

00:01:28.015 --> 00:01:29.740
ANGEL EYEDEALISM: Yeah, I moved
in about a month ago,

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.170
and I'm going to stay there
for the summer.

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.870
And I thought, nobody's
photographed it,

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:33.650
nobody's shot it.

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:35.310
I haven't done a performance
in there, and I haven't had

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.490
sex in there either.

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:37.430
ARDEN MYRIN: Oh my god.

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.550
It's all happening today.

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:40.285
Get ready.

00:01:40.285 --> 00:01:42.870
It's your trifecta.

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:44.440
ANGEL EYEDEALISM: There was a
fire in this building 10 years

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:45.730
ago, so it was rubble.

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:48.390
And the people building
formed like a co-op of

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.470
sorts called a homestead.

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.520
And each person claims a
space, and they work

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:53.430
on their own space.

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.610
ARDEN MYRIN: So you're the
glamor bubble in the rubble.

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:56.000
ANGEL EYEDEALISM: Yeah.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.650
Oh, it is rubble, I'll sh--

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:58.460
ARDEN MYRIN: You're
the trouble in the

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:59.640
bubble in the rubble.

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.190
ANGEL EYEDEALISM: I hope so.

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:03.840
ARDEN MYRIN: Here we go.

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.380
Where are you from originally,
Ms. Angel?

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.289
ANGEL EYEDEALISM:
I'm from Uranus.

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:09.249
ARDEN MYRIN: Oh my god,
you know what?

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:10.690
I thought I felt something
up there.

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:11.120
ANGEL EYEDEALISM: Yeah.

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.850
And I just wanted to tell you
that a hard angle for Uranus

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:14.700
is gayness.

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:15.485
ARDEN MYRIN: Oh, I love it.

00:02:15.485 --> 00:02:17.385
That's exciting.

00:02:17.385 --> 00:02:19.760
What's your favorite part
of living in a bubble?

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:20.850
ANGEL EYEDEALISM: I mean,
nobody's doing it.

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.290
It's just so original and fun.

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.036
ARDEN MYRIN: In four years from
now, everyone's gonna be

00:02:24.036 --> 00:02:24.430
living in a bubble.

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.850
ANGEL EYEDEALISM: I know.

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:26.390
ARDEN MYRIN: You're on
the cutting edge.

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.100
Oh, shut the front door!

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:29.700
You weren't lying!

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.080
ANGEL EYEDEALISM: No,
I don't play.

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.975
ARDEN MYRIN: Oh my god.

00:02:31.975 --> 00:02:34.114
Do your friends that are
building this live in the

00:02:34.114 --> 00:02:34.880
building right now?

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.290
ANGEL EYEDEALISM: They have
their room in the front.

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.260
And then they're just working
at-- you know, they fix it up

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:40.570
themselves and they own it.

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:41.170
ARDEN MYRIN: Oh my
god, so awesome.

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:42.530
OK, this is--

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:43.654
BOTH: The bubble.

00:02:43.654 --> 00:02:44.622
ARDEN MYRIN: This
is spectacular!

00:02:44.622 --> 00:02:48.230
OK, now give me the big TV
tour of your bubble.

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.030
ANGEL EYEDEALISM: I had just
moved in here, and it was just

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.330
the plastic, which my friend
Liz put up for me.

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:53.946
And I had this spray paint.

00:02:53.946 --> 00:02:55.000
I was like, fuck it!

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.670
I came home, I just went
da-da-da, and made big eyes--

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.260
because my name is
Angel Eyedealism.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:01.650
ARDEN MYRIN: Oh my god.

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.180
Now is it hot in the bubble?

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.680
May I go into the bubble?

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:04.090
ANGEL EYEDEALISM: Oh, I
have air-conditioning.

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:05.350
I'm a lady.

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:06.300
ARDEN MYRIN: Now who's
this person?

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:07.696
ANGEL EYEDEALISM:
This is Marlena.

00:03:07.696 --> 00:03:08.162
ARDEN MYRIN: Marlena.

00:03:08.162 --> 00:03:10.540
ANGEL EYEDEALISM: Marlena,
Monkey Monkles, Bucky Buckles.

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:11.980
ARDEN MYRIN: Come on, so cute.

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:13.780
This is just like
every McMansion

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.570
in Scottsdale, Arizona.

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:17.200
ANGEL EYEDEALISM: Come on in.

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.260
ARDEN MYRIN: They all have
their Bubble Room.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:18.750
ANGEL EYEDEALISM: OK.

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.040
ARDEN MYRIN: Now what is this?

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.230
ANGEL EYEDEALISM: Well, that is
what's called a theremin.

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.267
ARDEN MYRIN: This is a
theremin, you guys.

00:03:24.267 --> 00:03:25.161
[THEREMIN PLAYS]

00:03:25.161 --> 00:03:26.502
ARDEN MYRIN: Wow.

00:03:26.502 --> 00:03:26.838
ANGEL EYEDEALISM: [SINGING]

00:03:26.838 --> 00:03:32.120
Welcome to the underground.

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:39.050
It's a happy place when
the sun goes down.

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:44.000
Meet my friends, they
are so sweet.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.990
Jumpin' and a-tweakin', jumpin'
and a-tweakin',

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:54.265
jumpin' and a-tweakin'
to the beat.

00:03:54.265 --> 00:03:55.720
To the beat.

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:56.205
ARDEN MYRIN: Hey, hey!

00:03:56.205 --> 00:03:56.568
ANGEL EYEDEALISM: [SINGING]

00:03:56.568 --> 00:04:01.240
Oh, and meet my senses,
they smell so sweet.

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.410
ARDEN MYRIN: What?

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:01.770
ANGEL EYEDEALISM: [SINGING]

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:05.739
You'd never know, you'd
never know--

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:06.701
ARDEN MYRIN: No?

00:04:06.701 --> 00:04:07.067
ANGEL EYEDEALISM: [SINGING]

00:04:07.067 --> 00:04:10.222
You'd never know I was
from the street.

00:04:10.222 --> 00:04:11.138
ARDEN MYRIN: What?

00:04:11.138 --> 00:04:12.970
ANGEL EYEDEALISM: Or a bubble.

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:14.050
ARDEN MYRIN: Your dog
is very mellow.

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:15.774
There's some dogs like
four blocks away that

00:04:15.774 --> 00:04:16.660
are freaking out.

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:18.260
ANGEL EYEDEALISM: There's like
three huge pitbulls upstairs.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:19.828
ARDEN MYRIN: First
of all, bravo.

00:04:19.828 --> 00:04:21.130
ANGEL EYEDEALISM:
Oh, thank you.

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:23.062
ARDEN MYRIN: Favorite thing
about the bubble?

00:04:23.062 --> 00:04:25.320
ANGEL EYEDEALISM: Well, I got
all this furniture for free,

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.590
given away, or friends
giving it to me.

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:30.675
Just, like, accessories,
bras, hanging--

00:04:30.675 --> 00:04:31.770
ARDEN MYRIN: Definitely
like witchy magic

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:32.570
happening over there.

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:33.450
ANGEL EYEDEALISM: Yeah.

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:34.705
ARDEN MYRIN: Would you like
to read my chart,

00:04:34.705 --> 00:04:35.940
just a general vibe?

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:37.050
Is there any vibe
you're getting?

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:38.370
ANGEL EYEDEALISM: Well, I can
actually do your-- do you know

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:39.480
what time you were born?

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:40.120
ARDEN MYRIN: 6:16 AM.

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.790
ANGEL EYEDEALISM: OK, I can
do your actual chart.

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:43.330
Arden--

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:44.120
December 10, you say?

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:44.560
ARDEN MYRIN: Yep.

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.700
ANGEL EYEDEALISM: You are
a Sagittarius sun.

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:49.260
Nearly conjunct your mid-heaven,
which is

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:49.660
the point of fame.

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:51.110
She's a famous biotch.

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.980
ARDEN MYRIN: What?

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:53.764
OK, did you hear that, Mom?

00:04:53.764 --> 00:04:54.210
ANGEL EYEDEALISM: Yeah.

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:55.740
You are just a man magnet.

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.045
I think a few chicks would
check you out, too.

00:04:58.045 --> 00:04:58.967
ARDEN MYRIN: Thank
you so much.

00:04:58.967 --> 00:05:02.140
ANGEL EYEDEALISM: Now, you're
meant for wealth.

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:04.060
Oh, your Venus is in Aquarius!

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:05.020
What a degree!

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:05.980
Your Venuses conjunct my sun!

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:06.460
ARDEN MYRIN: Wait,
hold on, hold on!

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:06.940
Mwaammwawa.

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:08.860
ANGEL EYEDEALISM: Mwaammwawa.

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:09.520
ARDEN MYRIN: Well, thank
you so much for

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:10.350
showing us your bubble.

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:11.630
Thank you for your song.

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:14.135
I would not be a good house
guest-- or a bubble guest-- if

00:05:14.135 --> 00:05:16.230
I did not come up with a
housewarming present.

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:17.200
My very own vintage.

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.695
I brought you a bottle
of my finest wine.

00:05:19.695 --> 00:05:20.880
ANGEL EYEDEALISM: I
love white wine!
