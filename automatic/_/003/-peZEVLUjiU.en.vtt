00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:05.860
 revolverlab.com with an eye on technology 

00:00:03.399 --> 00:00:08.620
 new flagship htc taiwanese company 

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:10.959
 one m8 entered his rivals as 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:12.759
 at least in the number of cameras but how is it 

00:00:10.959 --> 00:00:15.009
 quantity displayed on quality 

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:17.340
 snapshots let's figure it out together me 

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:20.260
 Name is Nikita with you site revolverlab.com 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.180
 turn on let's start with the front 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:24.520
 faces of the smartphone which is located 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.590
 front camera or camera for reference 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:28.660
 having its arsenal of 5 million 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:30.520
 pixel snapshots with it goes away 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:31.990
 decent quality is not like that 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.730
 I want to print on large posters 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:35.980
 for much better than some 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:38.170
 competitors as there is a dual mode 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.539
 the shooting we first saw in 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:42.850
 samsung galaxy s4 when the picture is taken 

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:45.129
 on both cameras at the same time 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:46.629
 mode, you can record video from the sheet 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:48.429
 natal camera all just then 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:50.440
 dual core module is much 

00:00:48.429 --> 00:00:52.449
 more interesting it consists of two cameras 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.280
 bigger and smaller camera bigger and 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:56.289
 a conductive main photographing 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.749
 the element is remarkable here the size 

00:00:56.289 --> 00:01:00.729
 pixels is 2 micrometers 

00:00:58.749 --> 00:01:02.859
 if you understand the photo sensors then 

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:04.449
 for sure he paid attention to it 

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:06.880
 there is more marketing here 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:09.070
 The name ultrapixel is, in theory, every such 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.290
 pixel is able to capture more light 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.969
 what will affect the quality of your shots 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.159
 to understand whether these are good 

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:17.320
 ultrapixel and we even organized a photo 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:19.869
 comparison of the flagships one of which was 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:22.210
 htc and despite the difference in numbers 4 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:24.430
 ultrapixel and against for example 16 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.649
 samsung galaxy s5 photos turned out 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:28.360
 at one level all the photos taken 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:28.840
 it will be possible to look at the article on 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.850
 the site 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.280
 but then why another camera? 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.619
 which is less you ask and she carries 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.420
 in itself one interesting function measures 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:39.009
 the depth of the scene so you can 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.899
 change focus ready photos 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:42.250
 make a 3d effect or other det 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:43.869
 various effects 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.909
 here you can even paste objects from 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:47.560
 another photo shooting modes have 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:50.049
 several but probably the most common 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.030
 Used is the auto mode in it is 

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:54.009
 the ability to adjust the exposure balance 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.840
 white and juice or impose some 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:57.579
 the effect can also turn on the grid for 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.829
 convenience set the aspect ratio 

00:01:57.579 --> 00:02:01.780
 frame contrast saturation sharp 

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:03.159
 image force retouch and then 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.469
 save it all to personal profile 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:07.270
 by the way it is in auto mode available 

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:09.129
 maximum number of changes over 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.319
 subsequent snapshots are also available. 

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:13.110
 text mode whose name is clear 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:15.090
 what is it intended for 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.500
 only the quality of the dough photos in this 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.660
 The mode is not much different from 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.520
 similar in auto mode there is also 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.680
 macro mode and night mode which 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.020
 fully justify their names to me 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.380
 like macro mode has not done 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.690
 and without 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.310
 hdr that now surprise no one but 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.260
 if you still want something 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.450
 interesting here along with the usual 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.920
 panorama is the mode of photo spheres which 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.690
 allows you to take a picture of all that 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.190
 is around you sorry just 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.140
 You can view these photos 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.270
 exclusively on the smartphone itself and yes 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.070
 he sticks together these pictures of oil as 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:46.500
 these are not all shooting modes which 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:48.209
 present in htc one m8 i talked about 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.040
 the most interesting in my opinion and 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:52.260
 finally left the mode for real 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.180
 Hardcore lovers manual here you 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.670
 will need skills skill and at least 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.650
 basic understanding of photo craft in this 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.870
 mode, I only used the opportunity 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.910
 manual focus settings so photos 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.950
 can be done better than in macro mode 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:06.630
 other parameters it was from white 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.730
 Exposure Exposure issue 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:11.040
 in skillful hands the photos are shot in this mode 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.560
 outdo auto mode but personally itâ€™s me 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.750
 not very convenient video possible in 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.610
 four modes Slow standards of a motion 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.230
 recording at 60 frames per second 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:21.630
 and videos hd 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:23.790
 but did the river b help increase 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:25.860
 the number of cameras I suggest you decide 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.959
 follow the link in the description to our 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.400
 detailed comparison photo there will be all 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:31.560
 photos in different modes 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.390
 and you can vote and leave
