00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820 
the wall so we've got our lavender

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:08.880 
the wall so we've got our lavender
background<00:02:07.390> for<00:02:07.570> this<00:02:07.660> mural<00:02:08.020> now<00:02:08.649> for<00:02:08.830> the

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
background for this mural now for the

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:10.320 
background for this mural now for the
fun<00:02:09.039> stuff<00:02:09.100> we're<00:02:09.820> going<00:02:09.940> to<00:02:10.030> take<00:02:10.149> these

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
fun stuff we're going to take these

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.780 
fun stuff we're going to take these
branches<00:02:10.570> and<00:02:11.050> use<00:02:11.170> them<00:02:11.350> as<00:02:11.530> a<00:02:11.560> stencil<00:02:12.190> so

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
branches and use them as a stencil so

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:13.860 
branches and use them as a stencil so
what<00:02:12.910> I'm<00:02:13.000> going<00:02:13.090> to<00:02:13.150> do<00:02:13.270> is<00:02:13.360> put<00:02:13.510> these<00:02:13.570> on<00:02:13.750> the

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
what I'm going to do is put these on the

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.650 
what I'm going to do is put these on the
wall<00:02:14.050> and<00:02:14.550> take<00:02:15.550> a<00:02:15.580> pencil<00:02:15.820> and<00:02:16.090> draw<00:02:16.510> around

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
wall and take a pencil and draw around

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.020 
wall and take a pencil and draw around
here<00:02:17.140> and<00:02:17.380> create<00:02:17.650> these<00:02:17.830> shapes<00:02:18.130> and<00:02:18.910> we're

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
here and create these shapes and we're

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.610 
here and create these shapes and we're
gonna<00:02:19.150> mix<00:02:19.390> it<00:02:19.570> up<00:02:19.720> a<00:02:19.840> little<00:02:19.870> bit<00:02:20.290> we're<00:02:20.530> gonna

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
gonna mix it up a little bit we're gonna

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:21.960 
gonna mix it up a little bit we're gonna
turn<00:02:20.950> the<00:02:21.070> branches<00:02:21.430> around<00:02:21.730> I've<00:02:21.940> got

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
turn the branches around I've got

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.520 
turn the branches around I've got
different<00:02:22.420> shapes<00:02:22.690> and<00:02:22.840> different<00:02:22.959> sizes<00:02:23.170> of

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
different shapes and different sizes of

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.240 
different shapes and different sizes of
branches<00:02:23.980> and<00:02:24.160> this<00:02:24.700> is<00:02:24.850> gonna<00:02:25.000> be<00:02:25.270> our

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
branches and this is gonna be our

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.760 
branches and this is gonna be our
beginning<00:02:27.250> structure<00:02:28.209> for<00:02:28.630> the<00:02:28.930> wall<00:02:29.560> but

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
beginning structure for the wall but

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:30.750 
beginning structure for the wall but
I'll<00:02:29.890> show<00:02:30.010> you<00:02:30.040> how<00:02:30.220> to<00:02:30.280> paint<00:02:30.489> it<00:02:30.640> in

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
I'll show you how to paint it in

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.180 
I'll show you how to paint it in
afterwards<00:02:31.440> so<00:02:32.440> what<00:02:32.590> I've<00:02:32.709> done<00:02:32.890> to<00:02:33.040> make

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
afterwards so what I've done to make

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.130 
afterwards so what I've done to make
these<00:02:33.370> branches<00:02:33.790> work<00:02:34.000> also<00:02:34.209> is<00:02:34.600> sometimes

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
these branches work also is sometimes

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:36.449 
these branches work also is sometimes
there<00:02:35.320> were<00:02:35.380> pieces<00:02:35.590> sticking<00:02:35.950> out<00:02:36.130> that<00:02:36.310> got

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459 
there were pieces sticking out that got

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:37.920 
there were pieces sticking out that got
in<00:02:36.550> the<00:02:36.640> way<00:02:36.670> so<00:02:37.090> we<00:02:37.209> cut<00:02:37.390> off<00:02:37.480> the<00:02:37.630> extra

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
in the way so we cut off the extra

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.020 
in the way so we cut off the extra
pieces<00:02:38.140> so<00:02:39.070> that<00:02:39.100> we<00:02:39.310> can<00:02:39.430> actually<00:02:39.610> lay<00:02:39.880> these

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
pieces so that we can actually lay these

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.120 
pieces so that we can actually lay these
flat<00:02:40.300> against<00:02:40.570> the<00:02:40.660> wall<00:02:40.780> these<00:02:41.709> branches

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
flat against the wall these branches

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:43.949 
flat against the wall these branches
have<00:02:42.160> a<00:02:42.310> natural<00:02:42.790> irregularity<00:02:43.510> and<00:02:43.660> that's

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
have a natural irregularity and that's

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:45.390 
have a natural irregularity and that's
what<00:02:44.140> we<00:02:44.260> want<00:02:44.440> to<00:02:44.500> capture<00:02:44.980> and<00:02:45.100> that's<00:02:45.220> why

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
what we want to capture and that's why

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.210 
what we want to capture and that's why
we're<00:02:45.550> using<00:02:45.640> the<00:02:45.940> branch<00:02:46.480> as<00:02:46.750> a<00:02:46.780> stencil

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
we're using the branch as a stencil

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.680 
we're using the branch as a stencil
there's<00:02:48.220> no<00:02:48.430> wrong<00:02:48.790> way<00:02:48.820> to<00:02:49.120> do<00:02:49.360> this<00:02:49.510> as<00:02:49.660> long

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
there's no wrong way to do this as long

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.680 
there's no wrong way to do this as long
as<00:02:49.900> you<00:02:50.049> get<00:02:50.260> this<00:02:50.880> branch<00:02:51.880> flat<00:02:52.239> you<00:02:52.420> can<00:02:52.570> make

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
as you get this branch flat you can make

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.509 
as you get this branch flat you can make
a<00:02:52.720> shape<00:02:53.019> that's<00:02:53.320> all<00:02:53.500> it<00:02:53.650> matters

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:54.519 
a shape that's all it matters

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:57.259 
a shape that's all it matters
that's<00:02:55.390> why<00:02:55.690> this<00:02:55.750> is<00:02:55.930> a<00:02:55.959> creative<00:02:56.290> process

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
that's why this is a creative process

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:59.280 
that's why this is a creative process
what<00:02:58.269> I'm<00:02:58.360> offering<00:02:58.480> to<00:02:58.840> do<00:02:58.900> here<00:02:59.110> is<00:02:59.170> I'm

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
actually gonna take this over the edge

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.850 
actually gonna take this over the edge
of<00:03:00.850> the<00:03:00.940> window<00:03:01.360> and<00:03:01.709> actually<00:03:02.709> have<00:03:02.829> a

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
of the window and actually have a

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.210 
of the window and actually have a
wraparound<00:03:03.280> into<00:03:03.820> the<00:03:03.910> window<00:03:04.239> seal<00:03:04.570> there

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
wraparound into the window seal there

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.550 
wraparound into the window seal there
it'll<00:03:06.220> help<00:03:06.459> make<00:03:06.790> it<00:03:07.110> even<00:03:08.110> that<00:03:08.200> much<00:03:08.260> more

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
it'll help make it even that much more

it'll help make it even that much more
interesting<00:03:09.070> I<00:03:09.310> want<00:03:10.269> to<00:03:10.390> show<00:03:10.510> you<00:03:10.570> the<00:03:10.690> paint

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
interesting I want to show you the paint

brush<00:03:11.079> I'm<00:03:11.230> using<00:03:11.260> today<00:03:11.650> as<00:03:12.070> you'll<00:03:12.489> notice

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
brush I'm using today as you'll notice

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.400 
brush I'm using today as you'll notice
it's<00:03:12.910> a<00:03:12.970> very<00:03:13.209> thin<00:03:13.540> paint<00:03:13.900> brush<00:03:14.200> that

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
it's a very thin paint brush that

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:15.930 
it's a very thin paint brush that
actually<00:03:14.739> comes<00:03:14.950> to<00:03:15.160> a<00:03:15.220> point<00:03:15.489> it's<00:03:15.760> not<00:03:15.880> a

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
actually comes to a point it's not a

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:17.729 
actually comes to a point it's not a
square<00:03:16.269> paintbrush<00:03:16.810> I've<00:03:17.049> taken<00:03:17.320> the<00:03:17.500> paint

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739 
square paintbrush I've taken the paint

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:19.080 
square paintbrush I've taken the paint
here<00:03:17.980> this<00:03:18.160> dunn-edwards<00:03:18.340> color<00:03:18.790> called

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
here this dunn-edwards color called

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:20.970 
here this dunn-edwards color called
cocoa<00:03:19.570> and<00:03:19.750> I've<00:03:20.140> poured<00:03:20.440> it<00:03:20.530> into<00:03:20.769> a<00:03:20.799> little

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
cocoa and I've poured it into a little

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.370 
cocoa and I've poured it into a little
plastic<00:03:21.250> container<00:03:21.850> then<00:03:22.390> I<00:03:22.420> added<00:03:22.840> water<00:03:23.079> to

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
plastic container then I added water to

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.160 
plastic container then I added water to
this<00:03:23.500> to<00:03:23.709> make<00:03:23.829> this<00:03:23.980> more<00:03:24.340> liquidy<00:03:25.150> and<00:03:25.329> I'm

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
this to make this more liquidy and I'm

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:27.539 
this to make this more liquidy and I'm
gonna<00:03:26.290> go<00:03:26.470> ahead<00:03:26.590> and<00:03:26.739> start<00:03:27.010> working<00:03:27.400> on

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:27.549 
gonna go ahead and start working on

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:29.910 
gonna go ahead and start working on
filling<00:03:28.090> in<00:03:28.239> these<00:03:28.420> lines<00:03:28.750> the<00:03:29.440> lines<00:03:29.739> that

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
filling in these lines the lines that

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.680 
filling in these lines the lines that
I've<00:03:30.040> drawn<00:03:30.340> with<00:03:30.489> a<00:03:30.549> pencil<00:03:30.579> are<00:03:31.120> really<00:03:31.480> just

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
I've drawn with a pencil are really just

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.740 
I've drawn with a pencil are really just
guidelines<00:03:32.940> ideally<00:03:33.940> just<00:03:33.970> one<00:03:34.480> coat<00:03:34.720> of

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
guidelines ideally just one coat of

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:36.870 
guidelines ideally just one coat of
paint<00:03:35.019> is<00:03:35.200> enough<00:03:35.590> now<00:03:36.250> this<00:03:36.430> paint<00:03:36.670> will<00:03:36.820> be

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880 
paint is enough now this paint will be

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.699 
paint is enough now this paint will be
transparent<00:03:37.690> because<00:03:37.780> we've<00:03:38.079> added<00:03:38.230> water<00:03:38.590> to

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 
transparent because we've added water to

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:40.920 
transparent because we've added water to
it<00:03:39.040> if<00:03:39.610> you<00:03:39.850> want<00:03:40.060> to<00:03:40.180> make<00:03:40.299> this<00:03:40.450> look<00:03:40.660> a<00:03:40.720> bit

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
it if you want to make this look a bit

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:42.960 
it if you want to make this look a bit
more<00:03:41.079> opaque<00:03:41.680> you<00:03:42.010> can<00:03:42.160> go<00:03:42.280> back<00:03:42.430> a<00:03:42.459> second

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
more opaque you can go back a second

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:43.949 
more opaque you can go back a second
time<00:03:43.000> later

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:43.959 
time later

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:47.429 
time later
and<00:03:44.049> actually<00:03:44.500> add<00:03:44.950> in<00:03:45.329> a<00:03:46.329> second<00:03:47.140> layer<00:03:47.290> on

00:03:47.429 --> 00:03:47.439 
and actually add in a second layer on

00:03:47.439 --> 00:03:49.649 
and actually add in a second layer on
top<00:03:47.650> of<00:03:47.829> this<00:03:47.920> once<00:03:48.129> it<00:03:48.280> dries<00:03:48.549> however<00:03:49.540> I

top of this once it dries however I

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:51.300 
top of this once it dries however I
liked<00:03:50.019> the<00:03:50.290> fact<00:03:50.769> that<00:03:50.890> it<00:03:51.099> looks

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
liked the fact that it looks

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.160 
liked the fact that it looks
hand-painted<00:03:51.640> the<00:03:52.569> other<00:03:52.689> thing<00:03:52.900> that<00:03:52.930> makes

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.170 
hand-painted the other thing that makes

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:54.569 
hand-painted the other thing that makes
this<00:03:53.349> really<00:03:53.560> interesting<00:03:53.859> is<00:03:54.159> the<00:03:54.250> fact<00:03:54.370> that

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:54.579 
this really interesting is the fact that

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:56.630 
this really interesting is the fact that
we've<00:03:54.670> got<00:03:54.819> two<00:03:55.120> very<00:03:55.299> strong<00:03:55.719> color<00:03:56.049> choices

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
we've got two very strong color choices

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.250 
we've got two very strong color choices
the<00:03:57.640> dark<00:03:57.909> color<00:03:58.150> gets<00:03:58.450> the<00:03:58.599> light<00:03:58.780> color<00:03:59.049> it

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
the dark color gets the light color it

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:00.929 
the dark color gets the light color it
will<00:03:59.409> make<00:03:59.620> this<00:03:59.769> have<00:03:59.980> real<00:04:00.280> high<00:04:00.489> impact

00:04:00.929 --> 00:04:00.939 
will make this have real high impact

00:04:00.939 --> 00:04:03.360 
will make this have real high impact
from<00:04:01.120> far<00:04:01.329> away<00:04:01.480> and<00:04:02.019> then<00:04:02.859> once<00:04:03.040> the<00:04:03.159> viewer

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370

from far away and then once the viewer
gets<00:04:03.579> up<00:04:03.730> close<00:04:03.909> you're<00:04:04.239> gonna<00:04:04.389> take<00:04:04.540> a<00:04:04.569> second

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:04.959 
gets up close you're gonna take a second

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:06.750 
gets up close you're gonna take a second
look<00:04:05.049> and<00:04:05.170> go<00:04:05.319> oh<00:04:05.530> wow<00:04:05.889> it's<00:04:06.129> hand-painted

diluted with water is because latex

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:23.339

really easy once you painted a couple of
these<00:05:22.750> branches<00:05:23.259> you<00:05:23.380> really<00:05:23.740> get<00:05:23.919> to

00:05:24.089 --> 00:05:24.099 
these branches you really get to

00:05:24.099 --> 00:05:26.969 
these branches you really get to
understand<00:05:24.900> the<00:05:25.900> natural<00:05:26.349> shape<00:05:26.590> that<00:05:26.860> you're

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:26.979 
understand the natural shape that you're

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:28.620 
understand the natural shape that you're
working<00:05:27.190> with<00:05:27.400> and<00:05:27.729> so<00:05:27.909> if<00:05:28.090> you<00:05:28.210> want<00:05:28.389> to<00:05:28.419> add<00:05:28.599> a

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:28.630 
working with and so if you want to add a

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:29.760 
working with and so if you want to add a
little<00:05:28.930> bit<00:05:29.020> here<00:05:29.259> and<00:05:29.349> there<00:05:29.530> and<00:05:29.620> add<00:05:29.740> a

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:29.770 
little bit here and there and add a

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:32.159 
little bit here and there and add a
couple<00:05:30.070> of<00:05:30.310> extra<00:05:30.520> notches<00:05:31.060> that'll<00:05:31.900> be<00:05:32.020> great

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:32.169 
couple of extra notches that'll be great

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:34.890 
couple of extra notches that'll be great
it'll<00:05:32.949> just<00:05:33.220> add<00:05:33.370> more<00:05:33.699> to<00:05:33.970> the<00:05:34.150> natural

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:34.900 
it'll just add more to the natural

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:36.990 
it'll just add more to the natural
texture<00:05:35.289> of<00:05:35.349> the<00:05:35.409> branch<00:05:35.650> and<00:05:36.460> that's<00:05:36.610> why<00:05:36.880> we

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:37.000 
texture of the branch and that's why we

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.610 
texture of the branch and that's why we
use<00:05:37.210> the<00:05:37.389> natural<00:05:37.539> branch<00:05:37.960> we<00:05:38.110> want<00:05:38.320> this<00:05:38.409> to

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:38.620 
use the natural branch we want this to

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:41.040 
use the natural branch we want this to
look<00:05:38.800> like<00:05:38.860> a<00:05:39.820> branch<00:05:40.180> and<00:05:40.449> not<00:05:40.570> like<00:05:40.810> you<00:05:41.020> just

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:41.050 
look like a branch and not like you just

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:43.800 
look like a branch and not like you just
kind<00:05:41.440> of<00:05:41.530> lost<00:05:41.680> your<00:05:41.979> mind<00:05:42.190> and<00:05:42.430> went<00:05:43.360> crazy<00:05:43.539> at

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:43.810 
kind of lost your mind and went crazy at

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:46.140 
kind of lost your mind and went crazy at
paints<00:05:44.110> on<00:05:44.229> the<00:05:44.259> wall<00:05:44.639> one<00:05:45.639> of<00:05:45.699> our<00:05:45.849> final

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:46.150 
paints on the wall one of our final

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:47.790 
paints on the wall one of our final
steps<00:05:46.389> here<00:05:46.630> is<00:05:46.750> to<00:05:46.900> paint<00:05:47.110> some<00:05:47.320> clouds<00:05:47.620> on

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:47.800 
steps here is to paint some clouds on

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:49.439 
steps here is to paint some clouds on
the<00:05:47.860> sky<00:05:48.070> up<00:05:48.370> there<00:05:48.400> so<00:05:48.789> I'm<00:05:48.909> add<00:05:49.030> a<00:05:49.060> little<00:05:49.330> bit

00:05:49.439 --> 00:05:49.449 
the sky up there so I'm add a little bit

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:51.899 
the sky up there so I'm add a little bit
of<00:05:49.509> water<00:05:49.750> to<00:05:50.590> some<00:05:50.800> white<00:05:50.979> paint<00:05:51.310> I'm<00:05:51.759> gonna

00:05:51.899 --> 00:05:51.909 
of water to some white paint I'm gonna

00:05:51.909 --> 00:05:53.879 
of water to some white paint I'm gonna
stir<00:05:52.210> this<00:05:52.240> up

00:05:53.879 --> 00:05:53.889 
stir this up

00:05:53.889 --> 00:05:57.040 
stir this up
I'm<00:05:54.889> gonna<00:05:55.009> make<00:05:55.220> this<00:05:55.539> the<00:05:56.539> pain<00:05:56.780> a<00:05:56.810> little

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:57.050 
I'm gonna make this the pain a little

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:58.600 
I'm gonna make this the pain a little
bit<00:05:57.229> thinner<00:05:57.470> like<00:05:57.710> I<00:05:57.830> did<00:05:57.979> with<00:05:58.069> the<00:05:58.160> branches

00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:58.610 
bit thinner like I did with the branches

00:05:58.610 --> 00:05:59.950 
bit thinner like I did with the branches
that's<00:05:58.850> easy<00:05:59.000> to<00:05:59.180> manipulate<00:05:59.360> because<00:05:59.750> this

00:05:59.950 --> 00:05:59.960 
that's easy to manipulate because this

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:04.689 
that's easy to manipulate because this
is<00:06:00.110> again<00:06:00.440> it's<00:06:00.590> a<00:06:00.710> a<00:06:00.979> white<00:06:01.400> latex<00:06:02.120> paint<00:06:03.699> and

00:06:04.689 --> 00:06:04.699 
is again it's a a white latex paint and

00:06:04.699 --> 00:06:06.790 
is again it's a a white latex paint and
I'm<00:06:04.789> using<00:06:04.970> a<00:06:05.150> much<00:06:05.690> larger<00:06:06.169> brush<00:06:06.380> this<00:06:06.590> time

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:06.800 
I'm using a much larger brush this time

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.189 
I'm using a much larger brush this time
also<00:06:07.150> it's<00:06:08.150> actually<00:06:08.449> very<00:06:08.569> inexpensive

00:06:09.189 --> 00:06:09.199 
also it's actually very inexpensive

00:06:09.199 --> 00:06:11.110 
also it's actually very inexpensive
brushing<00:06:09.500> by<00:06:09.680> at<00:06:09.740> most<00:06:09.800> paint<00:06:10.160> stores<00:06:10.430> but<00:06:11.060> it

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:11.120 
brushing by at most paint stores but it

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:13.659 
brushing by at most paint stores but it
has<00:06:11.240> a<00:06:11.270> really<00:06:12.020> soft<00:06:12.470> quality<00:06:13.039> to<00:06:13.190> it<00:06:13.310> so<00:06:13.460> as<00:06:13.550> I

00:06:13.659 --> 00:06:13.669 
has a really soft quality to it so as I

00:06:13.669 --> 00:06:15.909 
has a really soft quality to it so as I
paint<00:06:13.910> via<00:06:14.150> the<00:06:14.690> clouds<00:06:15.020> I<00:06:15.229> can<00:06:15.410> brush<00:06:15.650> them<00:06:15.800> on

00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:15.919 
paint via the clouds I can brush them on

00:06:15.919 --> 00:06:18.300 
paint via the clouds I can brush them on
soft<00:06:16.340> and<00:06:16.639> have<00:06:17.210> it<00:06:17.300> or<00:06:17.389> not<00:06:17.509> be<00:06:17.660> too<00:06:17.840> thick

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:18.310 
soft and have it or not be too thick

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:24.460 
soft and have it or not be too thick
when<00:06:19.310> I<00:06:19.370> paint<00:06:19.639> some<00:06:22.630> sort<00:06:23.630> goes<00:06:23.810> up<00:06:23.990> there<00:06:24.289> the

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:24.470 
when I paint some sort goes up there the

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:25.930 
when I paint some sort goes up there the
bottom<00:06:24.770> gonna<00:06:25.009> be<00:06:25.130> a<00:06:25.160> little<00:06:25.400> smoother<00:06:25.729> and

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:25.940 
bottom gonna be a little smoother and

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:28.360 
bottom gonna be a little smoother and
straighter<00:06:26.620> I'm<00:06:27.620> gonna<00:06:27.770> start<00:06:27.949> taking<00:06:28.190> this

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:28.370 
straighter I'm gonna start taking this

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:30.999 
straighter I'm gonna start taking this
brush<00:06:28.729> and<00:06:28.970> whisking<00:06:29.360> out<00:06:29.509> the<00:06:29.660> edges<00:06:30.080> so<00:06:30.949> I'm

00:06:30.999 --> 00:06:31.009 
brush and whisking out the edges so I'm

00:06:31.009 --> 00:06:32.589 
brush and whisking out the edges so I'm
trying<00:06:31.310> to<00:06:31.340> diffuse<00:06:31.699> the<00:06:31.880> edges<00:06:32.150> as<00:06:32.270> much<00:06:32.449> as

00:06:32.589 --> 00:06:32.599 
trying to diffuse the edges as much as

00:06:32.599 --> 00:06:33.760 
trying to diffuse the edges as much as
possible<00:06:33.050> to<00:06:33.139> actually<00:06:33.199> get<00:06:33.470> them<00:06:33.620> to<00:06:33.650> look

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:33.770 
possible to actually get them to look

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:35.890 
possible to actually get them to look
like<00:06:33.830> clouds<00:06:34.250> if<00:06:34.460> they're<00:06:34.610> too<00:06:34.789> solid<00:06:35.330> they

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:35.900 
like clouds if they're too solid they

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:39.760 
like clouds if they're too solid they
end<00:06:36.050> up<00:06:36.139> not<00:06:36.440> quite<00:06:37.009> working<00:06:37.250> as<00:06:37.490> well<00:06:38.770> I'm

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:39.770 
end up not quite working as well I'm

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:41.050 
end up not quite working as well I'm
gonna<00:06:39.860> come<00:06:40.130> in<00:06:40.250> right<00:06:40.340> below<00:06:40.520> that<00:06:40.669> and<00:06:40.970> do

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:41.060 
gonna come in right below that and do

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:43.330 
gonna come in right below that and do
some<00:06:41.240> smaller<00:06:41.570> clubs<00:06:41.930> I<00:06:42.259> wanted<00:06:42.830> to<00:06:42.949> feel<00:06:43.190> like

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:43.340 
some smaller clubs I wanted to feel like

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:46.719 
some smaller clubs I wanted to feel like
the<00:06:44.380> the<00:06:45.380> we<00:06:45.740> have<00:06:45.860> a<00:06:45.889> sense<00:06:46.280> of<00:06:46.400> forced

00:06:46.719 --> 00:06:46.729 
the the we have a sense of forced

00:06:46.729 --> 00:06:48.610 
the the we have a sense of forced
perspective<00:06:46.820> by<00:06:47.630> making<00:06:48.020> the<00:06:48.110> top<00:06:48.320> clouds

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:48.620 
perspective by making the top clouds

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:49.960 
perspective by making the top clouds
large<00:06:48.949> enough<00:06:49.220> hauser<00:06:49.460> and<00:06:49.729> these<00:06:49.820> are

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:49.970 
large enough hauser and these are

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:52.180 
large enough hauser and these are
getting<00:06:50.180> much<00:06:50.330> smaller<00:06:50.680> now<00:06:51.680> that<00:06:51.860> gives<00:06:52.009> a

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:52.190 
getting much smaller now that gives a

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:53.860 
getting much smaller now that gives a
feeling<00:06:52.400> of<00:06:52.520> actually<00:06:52.909> creating<00:06:53.210> around<00:06:53.630> or

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:53.870 
feeling of actually creating around or

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:56.490 
feeling of actually creating around or
skyward<00:06:54.349> looking<00:06:54.889> and<00:06:55.159> adding<00:06:55.430> depth<00:06:55.729> to<00:06:56.000> it

00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:56.500 
skyward looking and adding depth to it

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:58.600 
skyward looking and adding depth to it
okay<00:06:57.500> I'm<00:06:57.590> gonna<00:06:57.800> put<00:06:57.949> the<00:06:58.039> finishing<00:06:58.400> touches

00:06:58.600 --> 00:06:58.610 
okay I'm gonna put the finishing touches

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:00.790 
okay I'm gonna put the finishing touches
on<00:06:58.820> the<00:06:58.880> clouds<00:06:59.180> here<00:06:59.479> like<00:06:59.960> I<00:07:00.080> said<00:07:00.289> before<00:07:00.409> if

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:00.800 
on the clouds here like I said before if

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:03.040 
on the clouds here like I said before if
you<00:07:00.949> go<00:07:01.130> in<00:07:01.310> and<00:07:01.520> do<00:07:02.210> it<00:07:02.330> real<00:07:02.539> light<00:07:02.780> that<00:07:02.990> you

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:03.050 
you go in and do it real light that you

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:04.300 
you go in and do it real light that you
can<00:07:03.080> go<00:07:03.229> back<00:07:03.409> with<00:07:03.470> a<00:07:03.650> couple<00:07:04.009> layers<00:07:04.190> of

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:04.310 
can go back with a couple layers of

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:06.490 
can go back with a couple layers of
white<00:07:04.610> a<00:07:04.639> little<00:07:04.970> bit<00:07:05.060> thicker<00:07:05.300> and<00:07:05.570> give<00:07:06.380> it

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:06.500 
white a little bit thicker and give it

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:08.140 
white a little bit thicker and give it
more<00:07:06.680> definition<00:07:06.889> with<00:07:07.400> the<00:07:07.490> clouds<00:07:07.759> it<00:07:07.970> kind

00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:08.150 
more definition with the clouds it kind

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:09.459 
more definition with the clouds it kind
of<00:07:08.180> creates<00:07:08.449> a<00:07:08.479> little<00:07:08.599> shadow<00:07:08.900> behind<00:07:09.169> it

00:07:09.459 --> 00:07:09.469 
of creates a little shadow behind it

00:07:09.469 --> 00:07:11.499 
of creates a little shadow behind it
where<00:07:09.590> blends<00:07:09.979> into<00:07:10.130> the<00:07:10.219> blue<00:07:10.520> and<00:07:10.789> then

00:07:11.499 --> 00:07:11.509 
where blends into the blue and then

00:07:11.509 --> 00:07:12.730 
where blends into the blue and then
what's<00:07:11.690> a<00:07:11.780> thicker<00:07:11.990> white<00:07:12.259> on<00:07:12.409> the<00:07:12.469> front<00:07:12.710> of

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:12.740 
what's a thicker white on the front of

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:14.740 
what's a thicker white on the front of
the<00:07:12.830> cloud<00:07:13.039> it<00:07:13.849> starts<00:07:14.090> to<00:07:14.180> create<00:07:14.389> the<00:07:14.509> sense

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:14.750 
the cloud it starts to create the sense

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:17.080 
the cloud it starts to create the sense
of<00:07:14.870> the<00:07:14.930> cloud<00:07:15.139> dissipating<00:07:15.919> into<00:07:16.610> the<00:07:16.820> sky

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:20.300 
when this is all completely drawing and

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:22.180 
when this is all completely drawing and
look<00:07:20.419> at<00:07:20.599> and<00:07:20.719> it's<00:07:20.810> not<00:07:20.930> quite<00:07:21.080> right<00:07:21.349> you<00:07:22.039> can

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:22.190 
look at and it's not quite right you can

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:23.469 
look at and it's not quite right you can
take<00:07:22.340> a<00:07:22.370> little<00:07:22.520> more<00:07:22.669> paint<00:07:22.940> keep<00:07:23.240> tweaking
