00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
basically you pull it outwards so when

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.230 
basically you pull it outwards so when
you<00:01:13.860> do<00:01:13.979> that<00:01:15.320> this<00:01:16.320> plastic<00:01:16.920> bit<00:01:17.130> goes<00:01:17.970> down

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
you do that this plastic bit goes down

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.030 
you do that this plastic bit goes down
and<00:01:19.310> the<00:01:20.310> whole<00:01:20.490> unit<00:01:21.409> basically<00:01:22.409> slides<00:01:22.710> out

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
points on the inside there the curvy bit

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:56.740 
points on the inside there the curvy bit
and<00:01:50.520> as<00:01:51.030> you<00:01:51.149> can<00:01:51.270> see<00:01:51.950> when<00:01:52.950> I<00:01:53.960> push<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.170> key

and as you can see when I push the key

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.990 
and as you can see when I push the key
it<00:01:57.750> pushes<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.229> plastic<00:01:58.680> button<00:01:59.009> and<00:01:59.189> that

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
it pushes the plastic button and that

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.440 
it pushes the plastic button and that
allows<00:02:00.270> the<00:02:01.399> an<00:02:02.399> intimate<00:02:02.850> cluster<00:02:03.180> to<00:02:03.299> come

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
allows the an intimate cluster to come

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.679 
allows the an intimate cluster to come
out<00:02:03.570> now<00:02:04.229> what<00:02:04.380> I<00:02:04.409> do<00:02:04.500> want<00:02:04.740> to<00:02:04.799> point<00:02:05.040> out<00:02:05.280> is

but<00:02:35.550> the<00:02:35.610> principle<00:02:36.060> remains<00:02:36.090> the<00:02:36.540> same<00:02:36.780> and

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
but the principle remains the same and

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.260 
but the principle remains the same and
there's<00:02:37.290> the<00:02:37.700> instrument<00:02:38.700> cluster<00:02:38.820> that<00:02:39.210> I've

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
there's the instrument cluster that I've

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.260 
there's the instrument cluster that I've
taken<00:02:39.510> out<00:02:39.810> to<00:02:40.560> take<00:02:40.860> the<00:02:40.980> key<00:02:41.160> out<00:02:41.240> explain<00:02:42.240> a

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
taken out to take the key out explain a

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
taken out to take the key out explain a
little<00:02:42.420> bit<00:02:42.630> more<00:02:45.110> okay

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
little bit more okay

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.160 
little bit more okay
so<00:02:46.830> yeah<00:02:47.460> that<00:02:47.880> was<00:02:47.910> a<00:02:48.000> bit<00:02:48.150> of<00:02:48.240> a<00:02:48.330> wiggle<00:02:48.480> so<00:02:49.110> I

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
so yeah that was a bit of a wiggle so I

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.820 
so yeah that was a bit of a wiggle so I
need<00:02:49.590> to<00:02:49.800> I<00:02:49.830> needed<00:02:50.340> to<00:02:50.490> crush<00:02:51.360> this<00:02:52.290> plastic

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
need to I needed to crush this plastic

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.400 
need to I needed to crush this plastic
button<00:02:53.580> quite<00:02:54.180> a<00:02:54.240> lot<00:02:54.480> actually<00:02:54.690> to<00:02:55.050> release

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
button quite a lot actually to release

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.460 
button quite a lot actually to release
it<00:02:55.590> but<00:02:56.370> you<00:02:56.880> can<00:02:57.060> see<00:02:57.210> the<00:02:57.450> the<00:02:57.900> groove<00:02:58.140> is<00:02:58.290> now

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
it but you can see the the groove is now

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.880 
it but you can see the the groove is now
very<00:02:58.680> well<00:02:59.000> it's<00:03:00.000> very<00:03:00.270> thin<00:03:00.600> key<00:03:00.870> but<00:03:01.590> you<00:03:01.740> can

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
very well it's very thin key but you can

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.780 
very well it's very thin key but you can
buy<00:03:02.070> maybe<00:03:02.310> a<00:03:02.460> bit<00:03:03.120> more<00:03:03.150> quality<00:03:03.810> one

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
buy maybe a bit more quality one

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.220 
buy maybe a bit more quality one
preferably<00:03:05.790> a<00:03:06.120> Mercedes<00:03:06.630> one<00:03:06.870> because<00:03:07.110> that

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
preferably a Mercedes one because that

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.400 
preferably a Mercedes one because that
would<00:03:07.380> really<00:03:07.560> work<00:03:07.860> well<00:03:08.100> but<00:03:09.000> that's<00:03:09.660> it<00:03:09.870> so

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
would really work well but that's it so

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:14.180 
would really work well but that's it so
you<00:03:10.440> just<00:03:10.620> put<00:03:10.920> the<00:03:11.010> key<00:03:11.190> in<00:03:12.020> facing<00:03:13.020> the<00:03:13.190> curvy

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
you just put the key in facing the curvy

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.690 
you just put the key in facing the curvy
bit<00:03:14.400> on<00:03:14.580> the<00:03:15.030> inside<00:03:15.500> push<00:03:16.500> it<00:03:16.650> in<00:03:16.770> and<00:03:17.550> when

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
bit on the inside push it in and when

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.040 
bit on the inside push it in and when
you<00:03:17.790> do<00:03:17.970> that<00:03:18.290> it<00:03:19.290> basically<00:03:19.470> pushes<00:03:20.310> on<00:03:20.489> to

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:21.050 
you do that it basically pushes on to

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:25.460 
you do that it basically pushes on to
this<00:03:22.050> metal<00:03:22.320> bit<00:03:23.270> pushes<00:03:24.270> it<00:03:24.450> on<00:03:24.660> the<00:03:25.020> inside

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
this metal bit pushes it on the inside

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.340 
this metal bit pushes it on the inside
and<00:03:25.680> that<00:03:26.040> plastic<00:03:26.520> bit<00:03:26.700> is<00:03:26.959> connected<00:03:27.959> to<00:03:27.989> the

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
and that plastic bit is connected to the

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:31.160 
and that plastic bit is connected to the
metal<00:03:28.500> and<00:03:28.970> that's<00:03:29.970> how<00:03:30.239> basically<00:03:30.540> the

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
metal and that's how basically the

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.850 
metal and that's how basically the
instrument<00:03:32.040> cluster<00:03:32.130> comes<00:03:32.580> out
