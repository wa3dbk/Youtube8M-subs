 It ran 650 points. 

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:09.150
 This time, you will be the first to 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.400
 The overall function of what the iPhone can do 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:16.529
 I will belong to you. 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.259
 The iPhone I'm using now is iphone's richest 

00:00:23.499 --> 00:00:26.929
 Multi mode. There is no reason for the 16th. 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.599
 Rating 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:32.590
 ourath 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:35.620
 Are you using 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.880
 First iPhone 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.880
 In this way, 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.630
 application. 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.000
 Let me introduce you to Black and Putt. 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.420
 Right side 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.420
 There are three modes to follow at year-end. 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.540
 The first version is a vibration motor 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:02.930
 I can turn off the lights, not the vibration mode. 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:03.680
 Do you believe me? 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:04.930
 The leader is thick 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.930
 on function. Adjust the ringtone 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.140
 You can adjust the volume to take over 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.800
 And there's a button on that door. 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.970
 2 button is the power button. 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.350
 If you are using a full-fledged iPhone, 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.590
 This way, the iPhone grows as you draw. 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.680
 Arranging the iPhone 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:31.730
 That 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:34.900
 Again, the button will be set to 50 for this 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.260
 It will be a watershed and it will grow like this. 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.260
 If you look at it, 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.260
 This early earphone is now over 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.729
 Strange shapes are easy to fall when the card is in the actual language 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:54.740
 You can now subtract from this section 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.420
 In relation to my lack of 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.240
 Then the small hole is planted with the button pressed. 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:02.899
 It comes out. 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:04.120
 And 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.160
 And the authority 

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:11.939
 You can stop by pressing 2 4 places to give your iPhone. 

00:02:13.609 --> 00:02:18.129
 epl. No matter what application you use, 

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:20.290
 start 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.159
 After that, 

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:25.259
 And then back to the main menu. 

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:30.839
 And then, with Hansan, 

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:33.839
 I see a book used for notifications 

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:37.709
 I wore a speaker for the inauguration 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:42.560
 The iPhone actually comes in handy when it comes to photos. 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.989
 To be able 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:46.939
 Eye 

00:02:46.939 --> 00:02:49.939
 I'll give you a blog. 

00:02:51.839 --> 00:02:55.929
 At first sight, you can see Uertaland and nuclear power. 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:02.209
 When you see elasticity, 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:07.829
 I can easily see the calendar in various modes. 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:12.310
 Those who say that they have made a contribution now 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:13.219
 You are 

00:03:13.219 --> 00:03:17.439
 As you enter Setler mode, you can 

00:03:17.439 --> 00:03:19.579
 country 

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:21.399
 I want the language 

00:03:21.399 --> 00:03:26.249
 Even if it is English version, the version is getting wider version 

00:03:26.249 --> 00:03:28.549
 30 years 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:31.789
 I could pick a lot of them. 

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:34.789
 So, the Gyeonggi Branch 

00:03:39.369 --> 00:03:40.829
 In this way, 

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:43.829
 All menus will change to Hangul. 

00:03:44.969 --> 00:03:47.969
 Well, after brushing, 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:55.349
 As we enter the main menu, 

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:58.790
 Do you see Hangul? 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:00.270
 War period 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:03.270
 Buffett will be with Jung on January 10 last year. 

00:04:04.169 --> 00:04:07.169
 I can set up a workplace. 

00:04:12.029 --> 00:04:15.029
 Is it wrong? 

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:18.629
 Yesterday 

00:04:18.629 --> 00:04:22.879
 I can die. Related to that he is uncertain 

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:25.110
 Along with building 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.020
 I eat beef 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.020
 If you decide to use treasury stock mode 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.780
 We can see the photos we took at the time. 

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:38.800
 That way. 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.520
 logo 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:43.520
 I can see pictures. 

00:04:44.309 --> 00:04:47.309
 Right-click on it may be over today. 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:50.240
 Because of the touch function 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:51.430
 Plan to stay right
