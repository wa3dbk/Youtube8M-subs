00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.800
DEAR HARD WORK,

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.800
I used to hate you.

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:14.240
When you called my name, I heard it, but I ran away from you.

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:17.780
When I knew you were coming, I used to hide from you.

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:24.420
When you influenced others to talk to me, I quickly made excuses to get away from you.

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.160
Afraid of the pain, because I did not want to get hurt.

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.820
Afraid to fail.

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.080
So I did not even try.

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:39.660
And afraid of your name, because of what you have done to others.

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:45.260
Who do you think you are? Making me so afraid of who you are...

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.340
Reflection in the mirror, shadow behind me...

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.460
I take one step and you are still ahead of me.

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.940
Sweat in my face, tears in my eyes.

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:58.470
I keep on going,
I heard you tell no lies.

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.400
You turn the poor to rich.

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.040
F to A's...

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.520
Is there anything that you can not do?

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.060
Now look at me. You made me who I am today!

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.400
And because you I have this never losing, never giving up attitude.

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.270
Quitting? That is not in my vocabulary!

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.200
When they quit, I keep going.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.940
When they sleep, I work harder.

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:31.660
When they say that I can not and count me out, I show them that I can.

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:37.740
When I tell them about my dreams and they laugh, I make sure I laugh last.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.500
I am a dream chaser.

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:47.540
That means I chase my dream and no one else is. Only I can defeat me.

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.900
It is me against this work you put on me.

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:52.700
There is no loosing...

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.280
I WILL NOT LOSE!!!

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:28.820
I came this far and I am not stopping now.

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:06.960
Oh, Hard Work, my dad was right about you... you do pay off.

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.280
And because of that, I love you.

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.360
How can I not?

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.640
I am no longer hiding from you.

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.600
I am waiting for you.

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.700
Matter of fact, where are you?

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.440
I need you... because in Hard Work I trust!

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.640
This is not easy, but Hard Work pays off.

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:10.580
I CAN! YOU CAN!!!

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.140
NEVER GIVE UP!!!
