00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
open on both cable ends and then right

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.150 
open on both cable ends and then right
here<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.969> stock<00:00:51.239> or<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:52.140> normal<00:00:52.530> position<00:00:52.739> of

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
here the stock or the normal position of

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.650 
here the stock or the normal position of
the<00:00:53.280> shifter<00:00:53.610> is<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:53.879> third<00:00:54.090> and<00:00:54.239> fourth<00:00:54.449> gear

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
the shifter is the third and fourth gear

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.650 
the shifter is the third and fourth gear
gate<00:00:54.930> so<00:00:55.320> this<00:00:55.949> is<00:00:56.129> third<00:00:56.370> gear<00:00:56.730> this<00:00:57.480> is

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
gate so this is third gear this is

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.080 
gate so this is third gear this is
fourth<00:00:57.930> gear<00:00:58.170> right<00:00:58.680> here<00:00:58.710> so<00:00:59.579> we're<00:00:59.940> going<00:01:00.030> to

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
fourth gear right here so we're going to

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.700 
fourth gear right here so we're going to
go<00:01:00.239> down<00:01:00.539> to<00:01:00.780> do<00:01:00.899> this<00:01:01.050> shifter<00:01:01.379> alignment

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
go down to do this shifter alignment

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:02.779 
go down to do this shifter alignment
without<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:02.010> locking<00:01:02.370> pin<00:01:02.520> we're<00:01:02.640> going<00:01:02.670> to

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
without the locking pin we're going to

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.579 
without the locking pin we're going to
go<00:01:02.910> down<00:01:03.180> we're<00:01:03.870> going<00:01:03.960> to<00:01:04.019> go<00:01:04.110> down<00:01:04.290> a<00:01:04.320> little

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
go down we're going to go down a little

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.160 
go down we're going to go down a little
bit<00:01:04.799> about<00:01:05.700> a<00:01:05.790> quarter<00:01:06.270> of<00:01:06.360> an<00:01:06.450> inch<00:01:06.570> they're

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
bit about a quarter of an inch they're

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.370 
bit about a quarter of an inch they're
going<00:01:07.350> to<00:01:07.409> rotate<00:01:07.560> it<00:01:07.799> counterclockwise<00:01:10.250> and

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.380 
going to rotate it counterclockwise and

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.600 
going to rotate it counterclockwise and
after<00:01:13.380> we<00:01:13.439> do<00:01:13.590> that<00:01:13.619> we're<00:01:14.100> going<00:01:14.189> to<00:01:14.250> push

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
after we do that we're going to push

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.940 
after we do that we're going to push
down<00:01:14.640> on<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.299> chrome<00:01:15.540> weight<00:01:16.080> on<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.710> chrome

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
down on the chrome weight on the chrome

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.910 
down on the chrome weight on the chrome
front<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:17.430> back<00:01:17.780> bracket<00:01:18.780> and<00:01:19.110> then<00:01:19.740> we're

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
front to back bracket and then we're

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.740 
front to back bracket and then we're
going<00:01:20.040> to<00:01:20.070> release<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.850> cable<00:01:21.270> end<00:01:21.450> on<00:01:21.659> the

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
going to release the cable end on the

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.600 
going to release the cable end on the
side<00:01:22.020> to<00:01:22.200> side<00:01:22.409> which<00:01:22.680> is<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:22.830> upper<00:01:23.220> cable

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
side to side which is the upper cable

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.730 
side to side which is the upper cable
end<00:01:26.150> all<00:01:27.150> right<00:01:27.330> and<00:01:27.869> then<00:01:28.320> we're<00:01:28.560> going<00:01:28.650> to

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
end all right and then we're going to

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.160 
end all right and then we're going to
rotate<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.340> shifter<00:01:29.700> back<00:01:30.119> into<00:01:30.750> neutral

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
rotate the shifter back into neutral

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.890 
rotate the shifter back into neutral
which<00:01:32.040> is<00:01:32.280> clockwise

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:34.900 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.590 

and<00:01:35.500> then<00:01:36.130> we're<00:01:36.610> going<00:01:36.700> to<00:01:36.790> let<00:01:36.940> go<00:01:37.120> the<00:01:37.150> cable

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 
and then we're going to let go the cable

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.340 
and then we're going to let go the cable
end<00:01:37.750> at<00:01:37.990> that<00:01:38.200> point<00:01:39.660> and<00:01:40.660> what<00:01:40.870> we're<00:01:41.230> going

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
end at that point and what we're going

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.190 
end at that point and what we're going
to<00:01:41.670> going<00:01:42.670> to<00:01:42.700> stay<00:01:42.880> here<00:01:43.180> and<00:01:43.360> now<00:01:43.480> I<00:01:43.510> go<00:01:43.780> take

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
to going to stay here and now I go take

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.660 
to going to stay here and now I go take
the<00:01:44.380> pin<00:01:44.620> out<00:01:44.800> of<00:01:44.830> the<00:01:44.950> transmission<00:01:45.550> and

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
the pin out of the transmission and

00:01:45.670 --> 00:02:01.840 
the pin out of the transmission and
check<00:01:45.880> the<00:01:46.000> shifter

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.030 

so<00:02:02.330> that's<00:02:02.540> how<00:02:02.690> you<00:02:02.780> adjust<00:02:03.260> the<00:02:03.680> shifter

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.040 
so that's how you adjust the shifter

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.700 
so that's how you adjust the shifter
with<00:02:04.280> a<00:02:04.310> broken<00:02:04.790> l-shaped<00:02:05.390> locking<00:02:05.780> pin<00:02:06.020> the

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
with a broken l-shaped locking pin the

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:13.030 
with a broken l-shaped locking pin the
locking<00:02:07.100> pin<00:02:07.310> is<00:02:07.490> right<00:02:07.670> here<00:02:10.870> and<00:02:11.870> so<00:02:12.140> if<00:02:12.620> your
