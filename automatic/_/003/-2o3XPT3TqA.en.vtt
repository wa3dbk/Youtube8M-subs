choosing head nuts or neck actually it

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.219 
choosing head nuts or neck actually it
looks<00:02:05.549> more<00:02:05.729> like<00:02:05.939> head<00:02:06.180> arms<00:02:06.570> and<00:02:06.750> body<00:02:06.869> but

it<00:02:07.320> doesn't<00:02:07.560> sound<00:02:07.680> as<00:02:07.860> cool<00:02:07.890> each<00:02:08.520> percentage

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
it doesn't sound as cool each percentage

to<00:02:12.819> attack<00:02:13.180> so<00:02:13.599> you<00:02:13.690> need<00:02:13.870> to<00:02:13.959> decide<00:02:14.260> if<00:02:14.440> you'd

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
to attack so you need to decide if you'd

to attack so you need to decide if you'd
go<00:02:14.739> for<00:02:14.890> the<00:02:14.950> high<00:02:15.069> percentage<00:02:15.280> shot<00:02:15.760> or<00:02:15.909> if

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
go for the high percentage shot or if

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.339 
go for the high percentage shot or if
you<00:02:16.060> decide<00:02:16.180> it's<00:02:16.390> worth<00:02:16.659> trying<00:02:16.840> to<00:02:17.049> take<00:02:17.230> up

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:17.349

I'll just have to say

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:06.570 
I'll just have to say
keep<00:05:04.930> your<00:05:05.080> eyes<00:05:05.230> peeled<00:05:05.260> sky<00:05:05.920> Hill<00:05:06.100> seems<00:05:06.400> to

keep your eyes peeled sky Hill seems to

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:08.880 
keep your eyes peeled sky Hill seems to
do<00:05:06.700> far<00:05:06.970> more<00:05:07.000> right<00:05:07.510> than<00:05:07.930> wrong<00:05:07.960> and<00:05:08.470> as<00:05:08.860> a
