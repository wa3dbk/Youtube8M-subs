00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
with some lat pull-downs now usually

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.590 
with some lat pull-downs now usually
always<00:00:35.130> would<00:00:35.489> recommend<00:00:36.090> doing<00:00:36.210> pull-ups

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
always would recommend doing pull-ups

always would recommend doing pull-ups
but<00:00:37.200> we<00:00:37.680> do<00:00:37.860> would<00:00:38.070> have<00:00:38.129> weighted<00:00:38.520> pull-ups

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
but we do would have weighted pull-ups

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.290 
but we do would have weighted pull-ups
on<00:00:38.969> the<00:00:39.059> other<00:00:39.210> day<00:00:39.480> very<00:00:40.160> heavy<00:00:41.160> so<00:00:41.460> on<00:00:42.120> this

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
the central nervous system and letting

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:47.959
