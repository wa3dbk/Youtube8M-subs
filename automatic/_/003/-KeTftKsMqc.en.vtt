00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:22.100 
think it was $14.99 and that is the cube

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:25.990 
think it was $14.99 and that is the cube
it's<00:00:22.490> a<00:00:22.580> multi<00:00:22.930> fuel<00:00:23.930> grill<00:00:24.530> and<00:00:25.310> the<00:00:25.700> way<00:00:25.820> that

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:30.380 
it works is called the cube because it

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.130 
it works is called the cube because it
just<00:00:30.970> collapses<00:00:31.970> down<00:00:32.180> into<00:00:32.539> a<00:00:32.570> little<00:00:32.930> tiny

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
okay as you can see I just lit this

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.160 
okay as you can see I just lit this
about<00:03:28.620> 20<00:03:29.070> seconds<00:03:29.490> ago<00:03:29.580> and<00:03:30.240> it<00:03:30.780> caught

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
about 20 seconds ago and it caught

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.860 
about 20 seconds ago and it caught
really<00:03:31.980> really<00:03:32.340> quickly<00:03:32.610> I<00:03:32.970> didn't<00:03:33.600> have<00:03:33.720> to

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
really really quickly I didn't have to

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.420 
really really quickly I didn't have to
hold<00:03:34.080> the<00:03:34.230> flame<00:03:34.410> on<00:03:34.650> there<00:03:34.860> for<00:03:35.070> more<00:03:35.250> than<00:03:35.400> a

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
hold the flame on there for more than a

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.730 
hold the flame on there for more than a
split<00:03:35.730> second<00:03:36.240> and<00:03:36.990> as<00:03:37.320> you<00:03:37.410> can<00:03:37.470> see<00:03:37.560> the

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:37.740 
split second and as you can see the

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:40.070 
split second and as you can see the
flame<00:03:38.010> is<00:03:38.190> traveling<00:03:38.730> pretty<00:03:39.450> quick<00:03:39.750> across

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 
flame is traveling pretty quick across

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.950 
flame is traveling pretty quick across

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
minutes and I already see some bubbles

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.369 
minutes and I already see some bubbles
coming<00:03:57.280> around<00:03:57.459> the<00:03:57.670> sides<00:03:57.909> a<00:03:58.150> little<00:03:58.180> bit<00:03:58.420> so

00:03:59.369 --> 00:03:59.379 
coming around the sides a little bit so

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:02.699 
coming around the sides a little bit so
being<00:04:00.159> the<00:04:00.250> fact<00:04:00.489> that<00:04:00.730> this<00:04:00.849> is<00:04:01.030> just<00:04:01.709> you

00:04:12.089 --> 00:04:12.099 
thing through its paces I do like the

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:15.180 
thing through its paces I do like the
fact<00:04:12.370> that<00:04:13.110> you<00:04:14.110> know<00:04:14.230> the<00:04:14.379> stove<00:04:14.680> contains

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:16.590 
fact that you know the stove contains
everything<00:04:15.670> really<00:04:15.849> well<00:04:16.150> I'm<00:04:16.389> really

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:16.600 
everything really well I'm really

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:18.990 
everything really well I'm really
actually<00:04:16.870> impressed<00:04:17.470> with<00:04:17.739> this<00:04:17.949> with<00:04:18.880> this

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.000 
actually impressed with this with this

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.560 
actually impressed with this with this
QuickStart<00:04:19.419> I<00:04:19.870> mean<00:04:20.859> I<00:04:20.889> only<00:04:21.160> took<00:04:21.340> like<00:04:21.400> a

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
QuickStart I mean I only took like a

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.490 
QuickStart I mean I only took like a
chunk<00:04:22.570> off<00:04:22.750> of<00:04:22.930> it<00:04:23.080> and<00:04:23.199> I<00:04:23.229> could<00:04:23.380> have

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
chunk off of it and I could have

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.879 
chunk off of it and I could have
probably<00:04:23.680> used<00:04:24.160> it<00:04:24.340> a<00:04:24.460> fraction<00:04:25.150> of<00:04:25.240> this<00:04:25.889> you

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:26.889 
probably used it a fraction of this you

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:29.779
