00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
the top insert is done the exact same

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.339 
the top insert is done the exact same
the<00:04:05.670> bolt<00:04:06.000> goes<00:04:06.209> through<00:04:06.239> the<00:04:06.540> welded<00:04:06.870> bracket

00:04:07.339 --> 00:04:07.349 
the bolt goes through the welded bracket

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:10.220 
the bolt goes through the welded bracket
this<00:04:08.280> is<00:04:08.340> an<00:04:08.610> example<00:04:09.000> of<00:04:09.239> the<00:04:09.390> bracket<00:04:09.930> that

placed we again will start by putting

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:39.110 
placed we again will start by putting
the<00:04:35.370> nut<00:04:35.700> on<00:04:35.940> to<00:04:36.540> the<00:04:37.050> bolt<00:04:37.410> and<00:04:38.120> tightening

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 
the nut on to the bolt and tightening

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:49.879 
the nut on to the bolt and tightening
the<00:04:39.570> bracket<00:04:40.139> onto<00:04:40.320> the<00:04:40.590> grille<00:04:41.010> shell

00:04:49.879 --> 00:04:49.889

and<00:04:50.310> again<00:04:50.789> tightening<00:04:51.449> the<00:04:51.599> bracket<00:04:52.050> so<00:04:52.080> that

00:04:52.279 --> 00:04:52.289 
and again tightening the bracket so that

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:54.920 
and again tightening the bracket so that
it<00:04:52.560> is<00:04:52.680> snug<00:04:53.009> against<00:04:53.490> the<00:04:53.610> grill<00:04:53.879> shell<00:04:54.240> this

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 
it is snug against the grill shell this

00:04:54.930 --> 00:05:03.679 
it is snug against the grill shell this
ensures<00:04:55.469> that<00:04:55.800> it<00:04:56.430> has<00:04:56.639> a<00:04:56.969> nice<00:04:57.240> fit<00:05:02.449> now<00:05:03.449> for
