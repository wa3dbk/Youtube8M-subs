00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.350
 tourist visa you are allowed to visit 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.120

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.250
 get it you must show that you do not have 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.380
 intentions to stay in Canada that 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.690

 without any possibility of returning to 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.610
 canada so think things through and 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.740
 the clear thing because there are people who have 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.780

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.840
 necessary for all types of visa

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.980
 wounds I tell you that this information is 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.959
 almost impossible to give since the 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.030
 economy industry keeps moving 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:43.709

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.019
 online to see if it can become 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:48.000
 contracted that yes I warn you that it is not 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:49.799

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.900
 permanent as a skilled worker 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:23.940
 which will give resident status 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.549
 permanent Canadian for it will be

 of sages and self-employed workers who 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.550
 they want to start a business between nothing 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.020
 pitifully for the province of 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:56.550
 quÃ©bec does not apply this visa for what 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:59.310
 you need to apply by means of 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:00.950
 businessmen for hey this time he's 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:04.050
 limited to artist athletes 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:06.840
 farmers people who do some 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:08.610
 cultural contribution in the third that is the 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.440
 permanent resident visa outside the 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:12.570
 family category this visa is for 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.520
 allow a family member to sponsor 

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:17.280
 for example if they are married and one of 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:19.830
 the two is Canadian the husband or wife 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.600
 can sponsor your partner also if 

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:22.920
 You are Canadian or permanent resident 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.320
 you can have the opportunity to sponsor 

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:27.180
 an adopted child or property have in 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:29.250
 account that the infant must have less 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.960
 19 years old to be activated accepted 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:33.240
 as a comedy qualification member 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:35.010
 you also have to keep in mind that 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.900
 All visas have a date of 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:38.680
 expiration and you must travel in the 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:40.870
 indicated period 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.820
 it is quite possible that for all views 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:44.560
 that I mentioned in this video applies that 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:46.539
 you have to go through medical exams 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:49.150
 that the government of canada demands so that 

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:50.889
 the process can finally be complicated 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.660
 as I mentioned at the beginning of the video 

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:54.490
 to obtain some of these visas 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:56.560
 you must do it online through the link 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:58.300
 that I will leave in the description is very 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:00.370
 important that you follow all the steps that 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:02.320
 there they ask you and send the forms 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:04.750
 necessary with the documents that require 

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:07.180
