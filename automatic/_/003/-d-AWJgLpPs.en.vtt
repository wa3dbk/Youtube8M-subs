 they want to start a business between nothing 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.020
 pitifully for the province of 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:56.550
 québec does not apply this visa for what 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:59.310

 farmers people who do some 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:08.610
 cultural contribution in the third that is the 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.440
 permanent resident visa outside the 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:12.570
 family category this visa is for 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.520
 allow a family member to sponsor

 for example if they are married and one of 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:19.830
 the two is Canadian the husband or wife 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.600
 can sponsor your partner also if 

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:22.920

 account that the infant must have less 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.960
 19 years old to be activated accepted 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:33.240
 as a comedy qualification member 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:35.010
 you also have to keep in mind that 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.900
 All visas have a date of 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:38.680
 expiration and you must travel in the 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:40.870
 indicated period 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.820
 it is quite possible that for all views 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:44.560
 that I mentioned in this video applies that 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:46.539
 you have to go through medical exams 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:49.150
 that the government of canada demands so that 

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:50.889
 the process can finally be complicated 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.660
 as I mentioned at the beginning of the video 

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:54.490

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:56.560
