00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.730 
pencil some black felt a pin back and
the<00:00:26.070> pattern<00:00:26.429> template<00:00:27.289> so<00:00:28.289> the<00:00:28.439> first<00:00:28.650> thing

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
the pattern template so the first thing

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.040 
the pattern template so the first thing
we're<00:00:29.009> going<00:00:29.160> to<00:00:29.279> do<00:00:29.519> is<00:00:29.820> cut<00:00:30.359> out<00:00:30.390> our<00:00:30.509> pattern

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
we're going to do is cut out our pattern

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.250 
we're going to do is cut out our pattern
piece<00:00:31.730> then<00:00:32.730> we're<00:00:33.000> going<00:00:33.150> to<00:00:33.390> cut<00:00:33.600> two<00:00:34.020> pieces

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
piece then we're going to cut two pieces

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.490 
piece then we're going to cut two pieces
of<00:00:34.740> red<00:00:35.460> fabric<00:00:35.730> that<00:00:36.420> are<00:00:36.600> bigger<00:00:36.930> than<00:00:37.080> our

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
of red fabric that are bigger than our

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.240 
of red fabric that are bigger than our
pattern<00:00:37.860> piece<00:00:39.560> so<00:00:40.560> you<00:00:40.620> see<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.100> pattern

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
pattern piece so you see the pattern

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.240 
pattern piece so you see the pattern
fits<00:00:41.850> on<00:00:42.090> there<00:00:42.270> nicely<00:00:42.570> I'm<00:00:43.020> going<00:00:43.830> to<00:00:43.980> put

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
fits on there nicely I'm going to put

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.670 
fits on there nicely I'm going to put
the<00:00:44.640> two<00:00:44.850> pieces<00:00:44.880> of<00:00:45.390> red<00:00:45.810> fabric<00:00:46.110> right<00:00:46.620> sides

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
the two pieces of red fabric right sides

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.660 
the two pieces of red fabric right sides
together<00:00:47.280> and<00:00:48.050> I'm<00:00:49.050> going<00:00:49.500> to<00:00:49.560> trace<00:00:50.310> the

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
together and I'm going to trace the

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.150 
together and I'm going to trace the
pattern<00:00:50.850> piece<00:00:51.270> on<00:00:51.570> to<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.470> fabric<00:00:52.890> with<00:00:53.130> a

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
pattern piece on to the fabric with a

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.120 
pattern piece on to the fabric with a
pen<00:00:53.460> and<00:00:53.930> once<00:00:54.930> I've<00:00:55.140> done<00:00:55.320> that<00:00:55.380> all<00:00:55.890> I'm

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:56.130 
pen and once I've done that all I'm

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:58.400 
pen and once I've done that all I'm
going<00:00:56.340> to<00:00:56.460> do<00:00:56.670> is<00:00:56.940> so<00:00:57.270> either<00:00:57.570> by<00:00:57.840> hand<00:00:57.870> or<00:00:58.350> with

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
going to do is so either by hand or with

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.980 
going to do is so either by hand or with
the<00:00:58.650> machine<00:00:59.010> all<00:00:59.280> around<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.360> edge<00:01:00.510> of<00:01:00.810> the

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:00.990 
the machine all around the edge of the

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:03.320 
the machine all around the edge of the
petal<00:01:01.320> leaving<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.430> bottom<00:01:02.790> side<00:01:03.060> of<00:01:03.090> the

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:03.330 
petal leaving the bottom side of the

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:06.289 
petal leaving the bottom side of the
pedal<00:01:03.660> free<00:01:04.159> so<00:01:05.159> now<00:01:05.369> what<00:01:05.519> I've<00:01:05.670> done<00:01:05.880> is<00:01:06.270> I've

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
pedal free so now what I've done is I've

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.389 
pedal free so now what I've done is I've
taken<00:01:06.509> each<00:01:07.079> of<00:01:07.259> my<00:01:07.350> pedals<00:01:07.740> that<00:01:07.829> I<00:01:07.950> traced

00:01:08.389 --> 00:01:08.399 
taken each of my pedals that I traced

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:10.999 
taken each of my pedals that I traced
and<00:01:08.700> I've<00:01:09.270> stitched<00:01:09.780> all<00:01:10.170> along<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:10.890> outside

00:01:10.999 --> 00:01:11.009 
and I've stitched all along the outside

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:13.370 
and I've stitched all along the outside
of<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.520> petal<00:01:11.850> leaving<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.750> bottom<00:01:13.079> of<00:01:13.200> the

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
of the petal leaving the bottom of the

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.880 
of the petal leaving the bottom of the
petal<00:01:13.710> open<00:01:14.100> and<00:01:14.600> then<00:01:15.600> I'm<00:01:16.259> just<00:01:16.469> going<00:01:16.740> to

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
petal open and then I'm just going to

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.789 
petal open and then I'm just going to
cut<00:01:17.369> around<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:18.240> outside<00:01:18.840> leaving<00:01:19.409> about<00:01:19.619> an

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
cut around the outside leaving about an

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.950 
cut around the outside leaving about an
eighth<00:01:19.979> of<00:01:20.219> an<00:01:20.369> inch<00:01:20.490> I<00:01:23.689> want<00:01:24.689> it<00:01:24.749> to<00:01:24.840> be<00:01:24.929> very

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
eighth of an inch I want it to be very

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.550 
eighth of an inch I want it to be very
very<00:01:25.229> thin<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:25.950> I've<00:01:26.340> cut<00:01:26.640> one<00:01:26.850> here<00:01:27.380> so<00:01:28.380> the

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
very thin and I've cut one here so the

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.560 
very thin and I've cut one here so the
next<00:01:28.590> step<00:01:28.950> for<00:01:29.100> each<00:01:29.399> of<00:01:29.609> the<00:01:29.759> petals<00:01:30.090> is<00:01:30.390> to

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
next step for each of the petals is to

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.230 
next step for each of the petals is to
turn<00:01:30.840> them<00:01:31.020> inside<00:01:31.170> out<00:01:31.729> so<00:01:32.729> that<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:33.030> right

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
turn them inside out so that the right

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.599 
turn them inside out so that the right
sides<00:01:33.539> facing<00:01:33.689> out<00:01:34.170> and<00:01:34.619> you<00:01:34.859> might<00:01:35.039> need<00:01:35.280> a

00:01:35.599 --> 00:01:35.609 
sides facing out and you might need a

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:37.520 
sides facing out and you might need a
pointed<00:01:36.149> tool<00:01:36.420> you<00:01:36.749> might<00:01:36.929> need<00:01:37.140> a<00:01:37.200> pair<00:01:37.499> of

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
pointed tool you might need a pair of

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.760 
pointed tool you might need a pair of
tweezers<00:01:37.999> but<00:01:38.999> basically<00:01:39.689> just<00:01:40.259> put<00:01:40.619> the

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
tweezers but basically just put the

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.819 
tweezers but basically just put the
tweezers<00:01:41.219> in<00:01:41.249> their<00:01:41.670> grasp<00:01:42.659> part<00:01:43.409> of<00:01:43.619> the

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
tweezers in their grasp part of the

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:50.690 
tweezers in their grasp part of the
petal<00:01:44.249> and<00:01:46.579> pull<00:01:47.579> it<00:01:47.700> to<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:47.909> right<00:01:48.030> side<00:01:49.700> the

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
petal and pull it to the right side the

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.999
