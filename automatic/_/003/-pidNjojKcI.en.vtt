connected to the same PC so that'll help

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.830

the<00:01:06.960> bat<00:01:07.140> I<00:01:07.170> noticed<00:01:07.350> that<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.540> zine<00:01:09.540> arc<00:01:09.750> is

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
the bat I noticed that the zine arc is

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.160 
the bat I noticed that the zine arc is
the<00:01:09.990> largest<00:01:10.470> model<00:01:10.860> of<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.729> three<00:01:12.090> I<00:01:12.360> think

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
the largest model of the three I think

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.600 
the largest model of the three I think
that<00:01:13.350> is<00:01:13.500> because<00:01:13.860> of<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.070> fact<00:01:14.310> that<00:01:14.400> it

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
that is because of the fact that it

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.149 
that is because of the fact that it
actually<00:01:15.090> does<00:01:15.330> have<00:01:15.659> composite<00:01:16.470> connections

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
actually does have composite connections

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.870 
actually does have composite connections

on top of the USB zener also comes with
a<00:01:20.970> lot<00:01:21.210> more<00:01:21.420> than<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:21.810> other<00:01:21.840> two<00:01:22.049> devices

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
a lot more than the other two devices

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.700 
a lot more than the other two devices

comparing the display quality on all
three<00:01:42.600> of<00:01:42.630> these<00:01:42.869> items<00:01:43.350> I<00:01:43.530> noticed<00:01:43.920> that<00:01:44.220> the

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
three of these items I noticed that the

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.569 
three of these items I noticed that the
Lilliput<00:01:45.180> and<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:46.350> my<00:01:46.590> mo<00:01:46.829> are<00:01:47.159> actually

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
Lilliput and the my mo are actually

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.819 
Lilliput and the my mo are actually
pretty<00:01:47.820> much<00:01:48.060> on<00:01:48.270> par<00:01:48.439> almost<00:01:49.439> of<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:49.649> point

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
pretty much on par almost of the point

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.109 
pretty much on par almost of the point
where<00:01:49.979> I'd<00:01:50.040> guess<00:01:50.579> that<00:01:50.610> they're<00:01:50.970> actually

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
where I'd guess that they're actually

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.310 
where I'd guess that they're actually
using<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.750> same<00:01:52.049> or<00:01:52.590> similar<00:01:53.159> display<00:01:53.790> panel

both of them have a glossy color rich
look<00:01:58.950> to<00:01:59.189> them<00:01:59.340> and<00:01:59.610> actually<00:02:00.270> look<00:02:00.420> pretty

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
look to them and actually look pretty

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.910 
look to them and actually look pretty
good<00:02:01.259> with<00:02:01.649> standing<00:02:02.430> images<00:02:03.710> compared<00:02:04.710> to

design<00:02:11.160> where<00:02:11.430> I'd<00:02:11.520> say<00:02:11.760> the<00:02:11.910> other<00:02:11.940> ones

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
design where I'd say the other ones

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.410 
design where I'd say the other ones
that<00:02:12.689> glossy<00:02:13.140> appearance<00:02:13.260> on<00:02:13.799> them<00:02:14.420> but

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
that glossy appearance on them but

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.330 
that glossy appearance on them but
that's<00:02:15.689> not<00:02:15.840> to<00:02:16.140> say<00:02:16.170> that<00:02:16.319> the<00:02:16.650> Z<00:02:16.859> narc<00:02:17.069> isn't

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
that's not to say that the Z narc isn't

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.459 
that's not to say that the Z narc isn't
a<00:02:17.400> quality<00:02:17.909> display<00:02:18.180> I<00:02:18.359> mean<00:02:18.870> it<00:02:19.019> doesn't<00:02:19.230> show

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:19.469 
a quality display I mean it doesn't show

00:02:19.469 --> 00:02:21.199 
a quality display I mean it doesn't show
that<00:02:19.500> colors<00:02:19.920> is<00:02:20.069> bright<00:02:20.430> maybe<00:02:20.879> with<00:02:21.090> the

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
that colors is bright maybe with the

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:24.679 
that colors is bright maybe with the
factory<00:02:21.599> settings<00:02:22.079> but<00:02:22.819> sure<00:02:23.819> looks<00:02:24.060> rich<00:02:24.329> and

00:02:24.679 --> 00:02:24.689 
factory settings but sure looks rich and

00:02:24.689 --> 00:02:26.750 
factory settings but sure looks rich and
it<00:02:24.900> looks<00:02:25.170> great<00:02:25.409> for<00:02:25.769> being<00:02:25.890> a<00:02:26.010> USB<00:02:26.459> only

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
it looks great for being a USB only

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.360 
it looks great for being a USB only
monitor<00:02:27.829> so<00:02:28.829> what<00:02:28.980> I<00:02:29.010> wanted<00:02:29.220> to<00:02:29.310> do<00:02:29.519> is<00:02:30.209> show

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
monitor so what I wanted to do is show

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.849 
monitor so what I wanted to do is show
just<00:02:32.370> a<00:02:32.459> couple<00:02:32.760> of<00:02:32.849> pictures<00:02:33.030> of<00:02:33.239> these<00:02:33.859> this

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:34.859 
just a couple of pictures of these this

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:37.009 
just a couple of pictures of these this
comparison<00:02:35.519> is<00:02:35.819> really<00:02:36.150> more<00:02:36.390> valid<00:02:36.840> than<00:02:36.870> the

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:37.019 
comparison is really more valid than the

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:38.479 
comparison is really more valid than the
latest<00:02:37.230> comparison<00:02:37.859> they<00:02:37.980> did<00:02:38.159> because<00:02:38.370> all

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
latest comparison they did because all

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:40.160 
latest comparison they did because all
of<00:02:38.609> these<00:02:38.760> are<00:02:38.970> the<00:02:39.000> same<00:02:39.090> similar<00:02:39.810> device

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
of these are the same similar device

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.670 
of these are the same similar device
seven-inch<00:02:40.790> USB<00:02:41.790> power<00:02:42.000> displays<00:02:42.540> and<00:02:43.200> what<00:02:43.650> I

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
seven-inch USB power displays and what I

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.649 
seven-inch USB power displays and what I
want<00:02:43.859> to<00:02:43.950> do<00:02:44.040> now<00:02:44.219> is<00:02:44.250> load<00:02:44.760> up<00:02:44.879> a<00:02:44.970> video<00:02:45.299> and

00:02:45.649 --> 00:02:45.659 
want to do now is load up a video and

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:47.780 
want to do now is load up a video and
show<00:02:46.200> you<00:02:46.230> the<00:02:46.409> quality<00:02:46.950> of<00:02:47.040> the<00:02:47.159> image<00:02:47.519> when

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
show you the quality of the image when

00:02:47.790 --> 00:03:47.659 
show you the quality of the image when
video<00:02:48.030> is<00:02:48.859> being<00:02:49.859> played<00:03:46.340> this<00:03:47.340> might<00:03:47.519> work

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:47.669 
video is being played this might work

00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:49.009 
video is being played this might work
but<00:03:47.879> it<00:03:48.000> turns<00:03:48.180> out<00:03:48.329> the<00:03:48.419> best<00:03:48.599> place<00:03:48.840> is

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:49.019 
but it turns out the best place is

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:51.319 
but it turns out the best place is
behind<00:03:49.319> the<00:03:49.560> string<00:03:49.889> low<00:03:50.010> so<00:03:50.579> we<00:03:50.909> put<00:03:51.239> the

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:51.329 
behind the string low so we put the

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:52.640 
behind the string low so we put the
entry<00:03:51.569> mic<00:03:51.750> here<00:03:51.959> we<00:03:51.989> haven't<00:03:52.290> secured<00:03:52.560> it

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
entry mic here we haven't secured it

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.860 
entry mic here we haven't secured it
down<00:03:52.799> yet<00:03:53.040> we've<00:03:53.459> taken<00:03:53.699> the<00:03:53.940> wire<00:03:54.180> there's<00:03:54.780> a

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
down yet we've taken the wire there's a

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.719 
down yet we've taken the wire there's a
plastic<00:03:55.229> piece<00:03:55.590> that's<00:03:55.889> covering<00:03:56.189> that's

00:03:56.719 --> 00:03:56.729 
plastic piece that's covering that's

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:59.119 
plastic piece that's covering that's
basically<00:03:57.150> holding<00:03:57.449> the<00:03:57.599> glass<00:03:57.810> the<00:03:58.199> panels

00:03:59.119 --> 00:03:59.129 
basically holding the glass the panels

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:01.159 
basically holding the glass the panels
here<00:03:59.250> you<00:03:59.819> actually<00:04:00.239> can<00:04:00.419> run<00:04:00.599> the<00:04:00.810> cables

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:01.169 
here you actually can run the cables

00:04:01.169 --> 00:04:02.899 
here you actually can run the cables
through<00:04:01.290> under<00:04:01.590> the<00:04:01.620> music<00:04:02.010> here<00:04:02.310> and<00:04:02.519> now

00:04:02.899 --> 00:04:02.909 
through under the music here and now

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:04.369 
through under the music here and now
it's<00:04:03.060> just<00:04:03.209> hanging<00:04:03.540> so<00:04:03.750> now<00:04:03.900> we<00:04:03.959> have<00:04:04.109> an

00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:04.379 
it's just hanging so now we have an

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:06.229 
it's just hanging so now we have an
issue<00:04:04.620> where<00:04:04.979> we<00:04:05.099> need<00:04:05.250> to<00:04:05.280> feed<00:04:05.639> the<00:04:05.819> world<00:04:06.090> so

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
issue where we need to feed the world so

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:07.670 
issue where we need to feed the world so
hopefully<00:04:06.629> those<00:04:06.750> video<00:04:07.049> clips<00:04:07.349> will<00:04:07.500> show

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
hopefully those video clips will show

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.469 
hopefully those video clips will show
you<00:04:07.739> that<00:04:08.069> each<00:04:08.280> one<00:04:08.489> of<00:04:08.609> the<00:04:08.699> devices<00:04:09.030> will

between<00:04:48.080> the<00:04:48.350> device<00:04:48.590> first<00:04:48.830> of<00:04:49.040> all<00:04:49.130> the<00:04:49.250> Z

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:49.430 
between the device first of all the Z

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:51.130 
between the device first of all the Z
narc<00:04:49.670> as<00:04:49.880> I<00:04:50.060> mentioned<00:04:50.510> we'll<00:04:50.660> also<00:04:50.840> do<00:04:51.110> a

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:51.140 
narc as I mentioned we'll also do a

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:54.850 
narc as I mentioned we'll also do a
composite<00:04:51.470> connection<00:04:52.630> it's<00:04:53.630> got<00:04:53.930> a<00:04:54.260> stand

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:54.860 
composite connection it's got a stand

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:56.500 
composite connection it's got a stand
that<00:04:55.010> comes<00:04:55.220> with<00:04:55.460> it<00:04:55.580> a<00:04:55.640> vase<00:04:55.820> amount<00:04:56.180> stand

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:56.510 
that comes with it a vase amount stand

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:59.140 
that comes with it a vase amount stand
it<00:04:57.230> actually<00:04:57.560> will<00:04:57.740> do<00:04:58.070> other<00:04:58.400> resolutions

00:04:59.140 --> 00:04:59.150 
it actually will do other resolutions

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:01.870 
it actually will do other resolutions
other<00:04:59.330> than<00:04:59.570> 800<00:05:00.380> by<00:05:00.500> 600<00:05:00.860> whereas<00:05:01.430> the<00:05:01.670> mime

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:01.880 
other than 800 by 600 whereas the mime

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:03.400 
other than 800 by 600 whereas the mime
oh<00:05:02.060> and<00:05:02.270> the<00:05:02.330> little<00:05:02.480> foot<00:05:02.750> are<00:05:02.960> pretty<00:05:03.290> much

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:03.410 
oh and the little foot are pretty much

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:05.740 
oh and the little foot are pretty much
fixed<00:05:03.860> deta<00:05:04.010> 800<00:05:04.550> by<00:05:04.670> 600<00:05:04.970> you<00:05:05.300> could<00:05:05.480> actually

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:05.750 
fixed deta 800 by 600 you could actually

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:08.500 
fixed deta 800 by 600 you could actually
go<00:05:06.140> up<00:05:06.260> to<00:05:06.380> 1080<00:05:06.770> on<00:05:07.100> the<00:05:07.760> Zeen<00:05:07.940> art<00:05:08.180> but<00:05:08.420> of

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:08.510 
go up to 1080 on the Zeen art but of

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:10.920 
go up to 1080 on the Zeen art but of
course<00:05:08.960> the<00:05:09.200> quality<00:05:09.410> of<00:05:09.740> the<00:05:09.830> screening<00:05:10.250> is

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:10.930 
course the quality of the screening is

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:13.090 
course the quality of the screening is
affected<00:05:11.930> you'll<00:05:12.080> see<00:05:12.260> a<00:05:12.290> smaller<00:05:12.620> picture

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:13.100 
affected you'll see a smaller picture

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:14.470 
affected you'll see a smaller picture
display<00:05:13.430> as<00:05:13.550> a<00:05:13.580> result<00:05:13.970> of<00:05:14.090> using<00:05:14.210> that

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:14.480 
display as a result of using that

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:17.590 
display as a result of using that
resolution<00:05:15.580> the<00:05:16.580> zine<00:05:16.790> arc<00:05:16.970> as<00:05:17.120> I<00:05:17.240> mentioned

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:17.600 
resolution the zine arc as I mentioned

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:21.040 
resolution the zine arc as I mentioned
is<00:05:17.690> the<00:05:17.810> biggest<00:05:18.230> device<00:05:19.180> just<00:05:20.180> in<00:05:20.390> dimension

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.050 
is the biggest device just in dimension

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:23.710 
is the biggest device just in dimension
and<00:05:21.350> probably<00:05:21.830> has<00:05:21.980> to<00:05:22.160> do<00:05:22.370> with<00:05:22.700> some<00:05:23.510> of<00:05:23.600> the

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:23.720 
and probably has to do with some of the

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:27.040 
and probably has to do with some of the
added<00:05:24.290> features<00:05:24.710> that<00:05:24.830> it<00:05:24.980> has<00:05:25.330> the<00:05:26.330> motto<00:05:26.570> is

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:27.050 
added features that it has the motto is

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:31.090 
added features that it has the motto is
in<00:05:27.770> my<00:05:28.310> opinion<00:05:28.670> the<00:05:29.120> sleekest<00:05:29.770> device<00:05:30.770> it's

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:31.100 
in my opinion the sleekest device it's

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:34.600 
in my opinion the sleekest device it's
got<00:05:31.280> that<00:05:31.400> very<00:05:31.790> nice<00:05:32.650> blue<00:05:33.650> on<00:05:33.980> the<00:05:34.100> side<00:05:34.310> it's

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:34.610 
got that very nice blue on the side it's

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:37.210 
got that very nice blue on the side it's
got<00:05:34.730> the<00:05:34.880> buttons<00:05:35.240> on<00:05:35.360> the<00:05:35.420> side<00:05:35.630> as<00:05:35.840> well<00:05:36.220> it's

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:37.220 
got the buttons on the side as well it's

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:39.130 
got the buttons on the side as well it's
a<00:05:37.280> quality<00:05:37.640> display<00:05:37.940> and<00:05:38.270> actually<00:05:38.600> I<00:05:38.900> just

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:39.140 
a quality display and actually I just

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:42.220 
a quality display and actually I just
pick<00:05:39.470> it<00:05:39.500> up<00:05:39.650> for<00:05:39.800> a<00:05:39.860> second<00:05:40.160> here<00:05:40.780> has<00:05:41.780> the

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:42.230 
pick it up for a second here has the

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:44.380 
pick it up for a second here has the
screen<00:05:42.530> mount<00:05:42.860> so<00:05:43.310> you<00:05:43.340> can<00:05:43.610> actually<00:05:44.000> fix

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:44.390 
screen mount so you can actually fix

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:47.290 
screen mount so you can actually fix
that<00:05:44.660> into<00:05:44.960> maybe<00:05:45.140> a<00:05:45.230> head<00:05:45.560> rest<00:05:45.590> or<00:05:46.250> a<00:05:46.700> mount

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:47.300 
that into maybe a head rest or a mount

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:48.790 
that into maybe a head rest or a mount
stick<00:05:47.720> on<00:05:47.840> the<00:05:47.930> refrigerator<00:05:48.380> or<00:05:48.650> something

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:48.800 
stick on the refrigerator or something

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.230 
stick on the refrigerator or something
so<00:05:49.160> that's<00:05:49.280> pretty<00:05:49.550> nice<00:05:49.760> that<00:05:49.940> it<00:05:50.060> comes

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:50.240 
so that's pretty nice that it comes

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:52.180 
so that's pretty nice that it comes
built<00:05:50.540> in<00:05:50.660> with<00:05:50.720> that<00:05:50.960> it<00:05:51.200> does<00:05:51.350> not<00:05:51.530> come<00:05:51.890> with

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:52.190 
built in with that it does not come with

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:53.770 
built in with that it does not come with
a<00:05:52.340> vase<00:05:52.670> amount<00:05:53.060> though<00:05:53.300> so<00:05:53.570> if<00:05:53.660> you're

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:53.780 
a vase amount though so if you're

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:55.690 
a vase amount though so if you're
looking<00:05:53.870> for<00:05:54.110> that<00:05:54.200> option<00:05:54.520> probably<00:05:55.520> want<00:05:55.640> to

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:55.700 
looking for that option probably want to

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:57.160 
looking for that option probably want to
go<00:05:55.820> a<00:05:55.850> different<00:05:56.060> way<00:05:56.270> I<00:05:56.630> believe<00:05:56.960> they<00:05:57.050> do

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:57.170 
go a different way I believe they do

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:59.140 
go a different way I believe they do
have<00:05:57.380> a<00:05:57.410> my<00:05:57.710> mo<00:05:57.890> display<00:05:58.280> with<00:05:58.580> the<00:05:58.940> vase

00:05:59.140 --> 00:05:59.150 
have a my mo display with the vase

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:01.300 
have a my mo display with the vase
amount<00:05:59.540> but<00:05:59.960> this<00:06:00.260> one<00:06:00.470> just<00:06:00.740> has<00:06:00.980> the

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:01.310 
amount but this one just has the

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:04.150 
amount but this one just has the
attachment<00:06:01.940> on<00:06:02.000> the<00:06:02.030> back<00:06:02.650> the<00:06:03.650> little<00:06:03.950> put

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:04.160 
attachment on the back the little put

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:08.380 
attachment on the back the little put
actually<00:06:04.940> looks<00:06:05.390> pretty<00:06:05.540> good<00:06:05.960> and<00:06:07.270> it's<00:06:08.270> got

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:08.390 
actually looks pretty good and it's got

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:10.210 
actually looks pretty good and it's got
the<00:06:08.540> nice<00:06:08.690> chrome<00:06:08.990> buttons<00:06:09.470> on<00:06:09.650> the<00:06:09.770> side<00:06:09.980> it's

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:10.220 
the nice chrome buttons on the side it's

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:11.950 
the nice chrome buttons on the side it's
had<00:06:10.400> those<00:06:10.640> for<00:06:10.910> the<00:06:11.030> previous<00:06:11.390> generations

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:11.960 
had those for the previous generations

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:16.030 
had those for the previous generations
as<00:06:12.080> well<00:06:12.350> and<00:06:13.870> it's<00:06:14.870> sleek<00:06:15.350> but<00:06:15.710> it's<00:06:15.860> a<00:06:15.920> little

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:16.040 
as well and it's sleek but it's a little

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:19.060 
as well and it's sleek but it's a little
bit<00:06:16.250> thicker<00:06:16.490> than<00:06:16.790> the<00:06:17.030> my<00:06:17.300> mo<00:06:17.480> display<00:06:18.070> it

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:19.070 
bit thicker than the my mo display it

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:21.460 
bit thicker than the my mo display it
does<00:06:19.340> have<00:06:19.640> a<00:06:19.940> built<00:06:20.270> in<00:06:20.480> stand<00:06:20.900> on<00:06:21.170> the<00:06:21.290> back

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:21.470 
does have a built in stand on the back

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:25.510 
does have a built in stand on the back
of<00:06:21.680> it<00:06:22.630> if<00:06:23.630> you<00:06:23.780> can<00:06:23.930> see<00:06:23.960> that<00:06:24.350> little<00:06:24.520> chrome

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:25.520 
of it if you can see that little chrome

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:27.640 
of it if you can see that little chrome
bar<00:06:25.910> there<00:06:26.240> that<00:06:26.510> I<00:06:26.540> actually<00:06:26.750> use<00:06:27.440> your

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:27.650 
bar there that I actually use your

displaying<00:06:28.160> that's<00:06:28.430> kind<00:06:28.670> of<00:06:28.700> why<00:06:28.820> I<00:06:28.880> have

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:29.090 
displaying that's kind of why I have

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:32.620

that stuff under there propping it up it

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:35.770 
that stuff under there propping it up it
also<00:06:33.400> like<00:06:34.400> the<00:06:34.670> my<00:06:34.820> mode<00:06:35.060> doesn't<00:06:35.450> come<00:06:35.600> with

also like the my mode doesn't come with
