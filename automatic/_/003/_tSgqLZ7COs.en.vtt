00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:03.960
 or the one in that who are team 

00:00:02.699 --> 00:00:05.340
 see in a new video and I think it's a 

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:07.140
 very important video that you see because 

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:09.870
 I think there are some steps of interest 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.269
 of transit in the market since I 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.950
 I have it that the first zombie 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.170
 electric you do not see what you see catching worth 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.220
 and I also take to the right it leaves for no 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.869
 handle what I eat but there we go to 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.519
 reject so it does not matter I take a 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.980
 machine vale took it there I think it's 

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:26.550
 the first step of history 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.720
 is to take out the electric zombie from where 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.689
 is saved we put the first 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.180
 piece and we're going to look for the next one 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.129
 they are that white machine after an arm 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.110
 by no means are they better said and a 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:39.470
 Crank a lever as you want 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:43.440
 take it one to operate it basically 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:44.820
 well there is beige and I take the arm is in 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.980
 different sites since it does not matter 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.380
 there is because it will not always be there 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.790
 well, this is the video that I 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:52.110
 I have as some theories about what 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:54.420
 may have to do with stress 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.670
 after a day where two days playing 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.760
 followed this without stopping almost to 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.410
 get good I have done there I think 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.809
 that I'm going to be on the machine 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.070
 got to figure out certain things is 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.330
 hoping it's the environment because it 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.530
 I say Juan Carlos, not the actions until 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.640
 that our mind so that it does not die for 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.210
 the radio in actions and dies 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.240
 also diego no 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:17.000
 you see that a lot of rays come out in short 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.950
 very well this is in the third stop 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.770
 of the bus after the orange though 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.159
 some houses are left behind 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:28.380
 jump so they put it on that person because 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:28.380
 why not also 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:34.950
 it is with you you are finding me I think 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.539
 now I will explain why it has 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.979
 what to see a lot with enlist is to meet 

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:40.140
 with this they are same they change against one 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.710
 is five times clear released one 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.710
 Once I found it 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.340
 good 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.440
 basically what he tells me is that very 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:55.820
 well released but now that I have to 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:59.040
 pay the energy also here is part 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:04.310
 basic eye down there something 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.310
 going up earlier and we put it 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.119
 over here I follow Juan Carlos with that 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.170
 I started things because I have 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.310
 already done before but could not find 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.989
 third part although I have found them 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.010
 so mosaics something else is a 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:18.319
 battery tell you towards the table 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.819
 Well, what are we doing? 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:23.450
 doing another machine just like we have 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:25.519
 done before but more rare you see back and 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.940
 missing one is there on top of the 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:32.530
 barrels not to the right of life 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:34.800
 You see I'm running the zombie this one 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.800
 has bothered 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:37.900
 corrects coming down does not finish for 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:39.660
 above 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.900
 Thank you 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:45.230
 we put there and we have a trap 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.580
 effective is called 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.590
 good is where I'm going now in that door 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:54.240
 of the green background says that you need a 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:55.710
 lack of electricity but the 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.510
 policy did not work because either 

00:02:55.710 --> 00:03:01.230
 has good energy 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:04.680
 then I started thinking and I tell you with 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:07.200
 Carlos Ben takes the turbine 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:10.459
 but there is low because 90 and there is one thing 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.459
 in some cables but I did not find them 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.110
 we put out there I do not know why simply 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:18.890
 to go checking things do not close 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.890
 when shutting down so no 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:24.210
 here and there and there follows him 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.560
 the turbine that has turbine know what 

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:26.810
 turbine provides electricity to 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:31.310
 the coasts 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:33.819
 then it determines if not then 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:39.120
 the turbine 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:41.139
 basically behind closed doors if we're 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.489
 before the door that needs electricity 

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:44.139
 the turbine 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:45.280
 and now with the turbine does a 

00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:46.870
 good effect so strong the effect 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.659
 electricity that even committed suicide with 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:51.770
 he does not see is well thought to do that 

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:54.860
 already in that the door does not 

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:57.470
 although it had no effect because it did not 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:59.600
 it worked already we know that that set 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:01.940
 makes a larger entity and here nobody goes to 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:03.290
 thinking about this leads us to think that it does 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:06.160
 the hat is missing to open that 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:10.450
 door will have to be carried to the 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:10.450
 of counter in the bank 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:33.910
 a kind of device for that what 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:36.130
 have to see how well very well 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:37.720
 and discard a list is something on top of 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:41.650
 the head of the zombie repeat we avoid the 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:43.300
 scene the white light tried to make a 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:45.160
 enlargement but I can not see that the light 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:47.560
 Streetlight is white not know is 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:49.870
 white is clearly white or yellow 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:51.160
 as you want, well, this is 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:54.940
 interesting 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:59.280
 you will see after that I went back to aquino and 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:59.280
 I was alone and the electricity 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:04.840
 I think I put fast camera why 

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:08.260
 do not 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:10.000
 and it is already 

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:13.090
 I see that green light on a road 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:16.780
 vigo ok you will not have what sometimes 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:18.860
 be other green light and good and here 

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:20.900
 comes the definitive look 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:24.400
 the bus that used to be white now 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:24.400
 I will also listen to how it sounds 

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:31.080
 driven by conspiracy 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:38.660
 if this will serve to 

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:47.789
 I also think this has to do with 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:49.259
 much with the interest although I do not know what 

00:05:47.789 --> 00:05:50.430
 way or what to do with them 

00:05:49.259 --> 00:05:52.470
 because he shot them 

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:56.789
 turbines down and level now I want 

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:58.380
 do one thing that was about all the 

00:05:56.789 --> 00:06:00.120
 map with the free camera but good there 

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:02.130
 Martin to speak to you in this video is 

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:04.110
 just simply theory that's nothing 

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:05.580
 I have not seen any video of 

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:07.500
 done willis ex today uploaded a video 

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:09.919
 from the side of the thousands tico I already 

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:09.919
 I made yesterday 

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:16.880
 in fact there is no gameplay of this 

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:19.650
 to not remove any videos in plan to 

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:21.870
 you or anything like that I just did not see it 

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:23.190
 because he did not want to take any intrigues out 

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:26.750
 what about the raffia zombies that come out 

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:26.750
 for the jumping field I did not know 

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:33.500
 but good this in this part of the map 

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:36.200
 OK 

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:37.700
 there are others there are some cards if you are going to go 

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:39.170
 by fire 

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:41.390
 the railing that does not burn you there's a 

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:43.160
 card if you collect it everywhere 

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:45.890
 that you play next to your points 

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:47.510
 like that tragedy to you will see the right 

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:50.680
 of the point face that card that looks 

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:50.680
 have a charger as it comes out
