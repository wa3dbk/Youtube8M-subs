00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.819
 so hello everyone 

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:12.610
 Well, I painted the wheels so it means 

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:15.169
 this whole thing looks pretty good 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:17.029
 then I painted all the same decided 

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:20.300
 paint with liquid rubber 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:22.720
 that's not because there's something fucking what 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:26.989
 it is difficult and so on 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:30.739
 to paint normally well, as it should be decided 

00:00:26.989 --> 00:00:32.200
 just try means here it is plasti 

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:35.390
 dip 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:38.239
 Well, in principle, you can generally mean so 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:42.230
 what he is afraid of immediately say he means 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:46.600
 afraid here you can see yes I am just now 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:46.600
 went to tire here is the load 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:55.820
 here he turned a little bit he now 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:59.239
 grease and lubrication 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:01.130
 scattered because the wheels are matt well 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:04.430
 You can of course varnish still cover the top 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:07.670
 plastidip of skin but it will turn out in two 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:10.729
 times you dearer so that's how in 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:16.240
 In principle, in principle , he is more or less 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:20.990
 I stood right here 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:23.090
 Here is a topic but there can be seen samples 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.880
 bad she fell tires but here here 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:29.740
 very hard dead body hard to reach 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:31.670
 you can't get here at all 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.009
 very hard to get 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.530
 I got here a little withered small 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:39.110
 I wanted to touch anywhere to get drip 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:42.170
 that's left here but in general as a whole 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:46.840
 the first wash I have been driving for two weeks 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.840
 this plastidip and generally nishtyak 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:56.140
 In principle, all the wheels are sitting well, well 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:57.649
 very much as said this thing is afraid 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.899
 oil stains 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:03.259
 because month is matt matt 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:04.369
 the color of the machines the mounting principle has stood here 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:06.770
 he did not balance 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:09.170
 put the wheel on dressing up 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:12.380
 spin there on this machine 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:16.069
 nothing here has flown normally in 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:18.769
 Basically, I think that's enough for a year. I think 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:20.680
 it is necessary though though if not to touch it 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:27.940
 balance on someone 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:30.220
 in principle, maybe longer 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:36.010
 to tint 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:36.010
 such an impromptu right here here ogradki 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:43.850
 more precisely, people are standing on here with you 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:49.420
 We paint well, this is certainly not a matter of what is now 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:49.420
 will do so i already have coffee 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.310
 so little 

00:02:57.689 --> 00:03:00.689
 will go 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.500
 a bunch 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:15.489
 so here 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.489
 Yes 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:23.880
 I am always like that in general 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:26.010
 I think the experiment was a success in the future 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:29.310
 I want to buy some old 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:32.220
 lousy casting the most important thing not to 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:33.920
 bent and generally paint it already as 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:38.010
 it is necessary 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:39.690
 primer well in general as i explained so 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:43.650
 In principle, on garlic without Ponte just 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:47.610
 I decided to try it I got up 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:49.500
 Means 1400 on 700 rubles balloon press 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:51.960
 degreaser there any form is shorter 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:56.360
 one and a half thousand and a half thousand of him 

00:03:51.960 --> 00:04:01.020
 Here is a stamp and very beautiful . 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:03.540
 not bad turned out well, all guys 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:09.260
 so okay principle can 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:15.690
 paint the module roll as they say 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:17.430
 Spears well, I will not be special 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:22.290

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:26.640
 put like what I think you are all 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:31.530
 you know everything, I won't teach 

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:33.330
 it took me no one means it took me yes 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:35.060
 By the way the most important thing I wanted to say 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:38.460
 gone on 4 discs 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:40.169
 here on these 15 radius stamping on 4 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:43.020
 the disk went one and a half balloon right here 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:47.460
 left the spray cans so I left 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:50.940
 its layers I laid seven layers seven layers 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:55.890

 while looking for my and you if of course 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:04.830
 anyone is interested in general analysis now 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:11.270

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:11.270
