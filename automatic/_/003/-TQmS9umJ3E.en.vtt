00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 
you're much better and next time if you

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.499 
you're much better and next time if you
do<00:02:04.569> that<00:02:04.780> don't<00:02:05.770> fall<00:02:05.950> off<00:02:05.979> like<00:02:06.250> nothing

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
do that don't fall off like nothing

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.760 
do that don't fall off like nothing
cousin<00:02:07.509> that<00:02:08.020> kind<00:02:08.229> of<00:02:08.259> defeats<00:02:08.560> the<00:02:08.560> purpose

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:08.770 
cousin that kind of defeats the purpose

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:14.190 
cousin that kind of defeats the purpose
of<00:02:09.220> doing<00:02:09.399> it<00:02:09.700> like<00:02:09.910> I<00:02:09.940> just<00:02:10.179> did<00:02:13.200> it's

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
of doing it like I just did it's

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.720 
of doing it like I just did it's
probably<00:02:14.319> best<00:02:14.709> to<00:02:14.800> let<00:02:14.950> these<00:02:15.129> guys<00:02:15.310> counter

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
probably best to let these guys counter

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.089 
probably best to let these guys counter
near<00:02:15.940> the<00:02:16.060> beginning<00:02:16.180> we<00:02:17.080> get<00:02:17.379> all<00:02:17.590> the<00:02:17.830> super

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:18.099 
near the beginning we get all the super

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:20.339 
near the beginning we get all the super
missiles<00:02:18.400> in<00:02:18.519> one<00:02:18.760> spot<00:02:19.140> doesn't<00:02:20.140> really

00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:20.349 
missiles in one spot doesn't really

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:22.410 
missiles in one spot doesn't really
matter<00:02:20.560> you<00:02:20.739> don't<00:02:20.890> it<00:02:21.580> helps<00:02:21.970> they<00:02:22.090> get<00:02:22.300> on

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
matter you don't it helps they get on

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:28.530 
matter you don't it helps they get on
but<00:02:22.660> y'all<00:02:22.870> necessarily<00:02:23.440> make<00:02:23.620> them<00:02:27.540> also

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
but y'all necessarily make them also

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:34.800 
but y'all necessarily make them also
probably<00:02:29.140> help<00:02:29.470> either<00:02:31.890> oops<00:02:33.629> now

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
probably help either oops now

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.449 
probably help either oops now
