00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 hello friends how are you I'm frank 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.750
 I hope you have the best and 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:10.260
 good in this video I come to teach 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:14.429
 how to make your minecraft skin like this 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:18.480
 paper if your favorite skin can be 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:21.060
 have in your room in your living room where 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.400
 you like it and the separator not because 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.779
 just pleases them more than ten 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:30.090
 you good the first thing that they are having 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:32.660
 obviously your corner here is mine 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.660
 for example 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:41.070
 good is the one you just saw finally 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:44.040
 you have to be very identical very very 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.920
 identical in fact they are the same but 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.660
 good once your skin has the 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.989
 first name 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:55.710
 good what they will have to do is go to 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:59.010
 the description of the video and download that 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:02.790
 file sometimes times here the 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:05.000
 select age right click extract 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.000
 here 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:11.340
 They expect luggage and good will leave them 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:15.509
 these two files a text document 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:17.549
 and a new program so good that's not what 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:21.680
 we will need because I am already 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:27.740
 saying here the instructions good 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:30.659
 this we leave aside they will have their program 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:33.899
 and I force warm they do is take their 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:37.409
 skin and without opening the program happens in its 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:41.360
 corner over the program and release them 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.360
 as if it were a folder something like that 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:47.760
 now they wait for the load to come out 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:49.720
 that little window will come out this other 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:53.480
 image 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:55.370
 this image, they open it 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:58.440
 well you have to wait for my 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:01.070
 computer decides to open 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.070
 good 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:08.610
 there it is, this image will come out with this 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:11.940
 image then you print the 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:14.870
 cropped with a small detail without 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:20.020
 cut out these lines that you see here 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:22.990
 and many good some spoke others not 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:25.810
 those who do not know how good these are 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:28.990
 lines are very it is very important that you do not 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:31.690
 the cut because here is where you 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:36.070
 they're going to hit her for saying this here 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:39.340
 line are going to fold the paper here too 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:42.400
 here also here also and here 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:44.850
 also and well I do not know why this is 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.850
 he put yes 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.450
 the recommendation of colors nobody you 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:55.200
 wants but good 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:57.540
 this being so they do not have to cut it 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.760
 because there they are going to hit him and he 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:02.550
 they cut out I think very hard they are 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:06.080
 how good can you hit another piece 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:10.459
 of paper but I do not think it looks very good 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:15.690
 good prints you cut out the glue 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:18.680
 folding it yes and they will have their corner 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:20.530
 so very 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:23.530
 well I have a bit of acorvic 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:27.459
 because I hit it right 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:30.230
 after the legs the front part 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:32.359
 I put it back the back one I put it 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:34.790
 before this is supposed to be 

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:38.090
 seeing from the legs has to go back 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:42.560
 me and my vast intelligence but good 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:45.349
 that and it is another subject as I told you 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:48.379

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:51.859
