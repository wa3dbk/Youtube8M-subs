 the holland beginning 

00:00:10.789 --> 00:00:13.399
 lopes the colossus of tutorial 

00:00:13.399 --> 00:00:16.399
 keiko speaks this time about something so deservedly 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.849
 from cta 

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:20.519
 very well 

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:23.599
 the cut copy as previously mentioned do not pay the vector 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:27.619
 works based on a Cartesian coordinate system 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.589
 you have here 

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:31.960
 on your left side 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.300
 civic nabarrete year in this country 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.580
 is perfectly prepared and lost 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:39.850
 do not taste 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.620
 to increase ethanol tool line and by talking to boleiros 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.880
 and the freeman tool 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.560
 okay 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.420
 the dvd a rectangle 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.870
 to waste that does not differ much from what already happens other soups 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.810
 how to play decorator 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.850
 you click air at a starting point 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.470
 in the canton of its methane 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:06.470
 and prepared the field diagonally 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.000
 get here 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.670
 in the command line is in the incredible corner 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:14.130
 right 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.460
 liked it 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.750
 able to communicate with the parent 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.920
 Your mind will stay 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.850
 the guy who understands over there 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:24.330
 dimension 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.630
 comma font 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.130
 second element 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:28.380
 thus 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.570
 he has a little bit on his screen 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.350
 and then type if you want 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.460
 of Germany the square of 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.340
 5 the lawsuit 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:38.430
 5 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.100
 living source 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.240
 understood 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.870
 to customer 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:45.220
 note here 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.750
 when any polygon 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.620
 it comes from music and theater 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:52.580
 boot will have 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.580
 to the outline of your outline 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:57.580
 and a map 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:59.070
 the time papa 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.440
 important moment in the program 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:03.840
 has in its 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.130
 in its origin at the time the three-dimensional modeling 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.589
 Steers she asks for Marta Paret 

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:12.099
 for objects to contract there 

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:14.879
 The project 

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:16.179
 the command still 

00:02:16.179 --> 00:02:17.510
 also works 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.710
 her mind is what happens to others I will have time and will form 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:22.639
 The dots 

00:02:22.639 --> 00:02:25.639
 start and 

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:28.669
 at the time he can leave 

00:02:28.669 --> 00:02:29.689
 polygons 

00:02:29.689 --> 00:02:31.979
 through the points 

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:34.249
 of attraction 

00:02:34.249 --> 00:02:36.789
 with an imposing bishop etc. 

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:39.059
 or perpendicular 

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:41.009
 that this theater already offers 

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:42.719
 automatically 

00:02:42.719 --> 00:02:44.199
 he took that 

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:48.359
 during the direct advisor of nelinha because it acts you to operate 

00:02:49.029 --> 00:02:53.590
 automatic tools to hurry and we do not even know with 

00:02:53.589 --> 00:02:55.559
 example if you 

00:02:55.559 --> 00:03:00.199
 positional so took this way see that your mind is locked up 

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:02.549
 in parallel with OIC 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:04.070
 or in parallel 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:05.439
 at eight o'clock 

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:07.779
 to see the line with sizes 

00:03:07.779 --> 00:03:10.129
 for finished protect 

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:12.769
 he laments everything perfect the methane 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:14.970
 click on the first point on the bridge 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.399
 to the side you wish collins and drawn 

00:03:18.399 --> 00:03:21.399
 rd the goal for example 

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:27.909
 police again 

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:32.279
 once again 

00:03:32.279 --> 00:03:35.119
 Just pay for having a little 

00:03:35.119 --> 00:03:38.119
 returns to the command still 

00:03:43.249 --> 00:03:44.359
 time 

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:47.099
 closing to vettel and then 

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:48.209
 clicking 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:51.209
 they look bad 

00:03:52.059 --> 00:03:56.739
 good following target demonstration should hit or speak now 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:59.939
 on the tool 

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:02.819
 It's great to be here. 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:05.819
 in computer graphics any object 

00:04:07.369 --> 00:04:08.929
 want to paste 

00:04:08.929 --> 00:04:12.409
 in fact it is composed of one year is with this perimeters 

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:15.609
 in then you will observe 

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:17.749
 at the command line 

00:04:17.749 --> 00:04:19.159
 you 

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:22.159
 pempered 24 sides 

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:25.729
 these then 

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:28.729
 will compose 

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:32.169
 the format saas type 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:35.240
 pyrography suspected of being softer this should 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:37.960
 before you start earning 1 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:39.259
 no hór mar 

00:04:39.259 --> 00:04:42.539
 a greater number of sides for example I will put here also 

00:04:44.819 --> 00:04:46.840
 with the theme enter 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:50.870
 and must to a new circus realize that now he already has 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:54.990
 the softer approach with respect to the first the same procedure will be given 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:56.590
 with bows 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:59.529
 the chat where the date comes goes 

00:04:59.529 --> 00:05:02.689
 increase the capacity of the lips to increase the 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:06.770
 the archer came from time through a point 

00:05:08.759 --> 00:05:11.969
 the second point 

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:13.599
 of your 

00:05:13.599 --> 00:05:15.009
 opening 

00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:16.550
 that are related 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:18.120
 with your ray 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:21.120
 since having the bow is a 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:25.520
 the stretch was lacking 

00:05:26.379 --> 00:05:28.210
 the Pauline year command 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:31.630
 are also commanded by the Rossi pushed pequim known form of 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:32.930
 latex 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:36.059
 and I think it is that the center battle 

00:05:36.059 --> 00:05:37.990
 will win the perch 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:41.199
 with freedom 

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:44.199
 the command was mine 

00:05:44.789 --> 00:05:47.089
 allows you to proceed further 

00:05:47.089 --> 00:05:48.650
 free 

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:51.650
 Cuba 

00:05:54.189 --> 00:05:56.569
 through it until you 

00:05:56.569 --> 00:05:59.550
 of various segments and understandings 

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:01.189
 dra 

00:06:01.189 --> 00:06:06.099
 I have been traveling consumerism memory considered no spare time used 

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:09.979
 in situations at the moment the city 

00:06:09.979 --> 00:06:12.949
 so you can win the seas 

00:06:12.949 --> 00:06:14.460
 with accuracy 

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:17.059
 there may even be what the command line 

00:06:17.059 --> 00:06:20.959
 only that during the process for example noda seeing if it imposes 

00:06:21.659 --> 00:06:24.659
 in the heart of the retired inform the amount sides 

00:06:25.819 --> 00:06:28.270
 the center 

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:30.740
 circle prevent work 

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:33.779
 you can inject for example 2 

00:06:33.779 --> 00:06:35.960
 reader 3 

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:37.099
 time 

00:06:37.099 --> 00:06:41.219
 is one of those sparing to give up the area two grandchildren and 30 dot 

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:46.990
 The same happens with polygons when they have them as initially 

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:47.860
 center 

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:50.029
 and may even have reported Ryan 

00:06:50.029 --> 00:06:52.619
 in case itapipoca in itáqui 

00:06:52.619 --> 00:06:55.919
 he will grant this paulista 

00:06:55.919 --> 00:06:57.619
 for example a comma 

00:06:57.619 --> 00:06:58.629
 5 

00:06:58.629 --> 00:07:00.719
 I have it here 

00:07:00.719 --> 00:07:02.419
 your perch here 

00:07:02.419 --> 00:07:04.430
 could be 

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:05.589
 registered 

00:07:05.589 --> 00:07:08.589
 the other spoke conference a meter and a half 

00:07:10.809 --> 00:07:11.710
 what's up 

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:14.599
 in the next and sectoral we will talk about it 

00:07:14.599 --> 00:07:16.399
 the votes to that effect 

00:07:16.399 --> 00:07:17.119
 two of us
