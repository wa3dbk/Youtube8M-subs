00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
there it is right there in the desk

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.190 
there it is right there in the desk
alright<00:00:45.180> so<00:00:45.270> that's<00:00:45.360> number<00:00:45.480> one<00:00:45.840> for<00:00:46.079> this

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
alright so that's number one for this

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.130 
alright so that's number one for this
level<00:00:46.379> and<00:00:46.590> number<00:00:46.969> 22<00:00:47.969> for<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.750> game<00:00:48.899> so

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
this is the next main objective which is

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.380 
this is the next main objective which is
to<00:00:54.210> get<00:00:54.510> to<00:00:54.719> irons<00:00:55.379> is<00:00:55.620> office<00:00:56.129> and<00:00:56.399> you'll

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
to get to irons is office and you'll
