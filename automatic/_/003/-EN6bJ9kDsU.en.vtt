for<00:00:50.579> phone<00:00:50.850> displays<00:00:51.239> and<00:00:51.570> there<00:00:51.989> is

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
for phone displays and there is

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.720 
for phone displays and there is
something<00:00:52.320> about<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.559> g4<00:00:52.920> size<00:00:53.190> that<00:00:53.489> seemed

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
something about the g4 size that seemed

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.779 
something about the g4 size that seemed
just<00:00:54.090> right<00:00:55.010> from<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.100> front<00:00:56.280> it<00:00:56.520> actually

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
just right from the front it actually

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.819 
just right from the front it actually
looks<00:00:56.940> a<00:00:57.030> lot<00:00:57.210> like<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.449> G<00:00:57.600> flex<00:00:57.809> to<00:00:58.170> LG's

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
looks a lot like the G flex to LG's

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.590 
looks a lot like the G flex to LG's

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
year and that's because the default

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.579 
year and that's because the default
display<00:01:02.579> is<00:01:02.850> actually<00:01:03.210> curved<00:01:03.480> as<00:01:03.660> well<00:01:03.870> it's

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
curved is much more slight though and
