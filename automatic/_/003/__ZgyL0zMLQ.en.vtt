00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:34.250 
warm in here so it's nice and supple if

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.160 
warm in here so it's nice and supple if
you<00:00:34.699> try<00:00:34.910> to<00:00:34.970> fit<00:00:35.239> it<00:00:35.420> when<00:00:35.629> it's<00:00:35.780> freezing

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:36.170

00:00:39.009 --> 00:00:39.019 
cold then it's a lot more difficult

00:00:39.019 --> 00:00:41.590 
cold then it's a lot more difficult
because<00:00:39.080> obviously<00:00:39.890> it's<00:00:40.430> a<00:00:40.489> vinyl<00:00:40.970> and<00:00:41.180> it

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:41.600 
because obviously it's a vinyl and it

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.170 
because obviously it's a vinyl and it
will<00:00:41.720> be<00:00:41.870> a<00:00:41.900> lot<00:00:42.110> stiffer<00:00:42.579> therefore<00:00:43.579> just

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:44.180 
will be a lot stiffer therefore just

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.030 
will be a lot stiffer therefore just
warm<00:00:44.449> it<00:00:44.570> up<00:00:44.780> using<00:00:45.080> an<00:00:45.290> air<00:00:45.440> dryer<00:00:45.769> or
