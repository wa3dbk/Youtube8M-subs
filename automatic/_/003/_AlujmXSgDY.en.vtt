 stories within the concepts of interventions in 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:37.600
 Create a punch

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:54.800
 around the year 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.580

 after a lot of training 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.950
 between the subjects of direct measurement the album that shows output 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.010
 common direct connection 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.400
 some people 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.940
 of which are in the king's speech as a producer 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.690
 I believe that the world can occur at the end of the cycle 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.370
 several times three 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:28.370
 with ample 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.850
 with the use of his experience that is said happy for this 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:38.189
 what we're talking about is the diary that threatened a prisoner of our own 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.990
 I am life 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.479
 but I went in and beyond that own who likes the prince said 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:47.600
 Who criticizes you, I can not talk now? 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.210
 very different 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:50.340
 on April 20 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.050
 early in his career 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.300
 they help is far from having a vision of it on the new generations 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.920
 and a world macbook a fidgeting the search 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.030
 human 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:05.980
 one year 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:08.509
 a house search 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.279
 which I think is distant in the in the current youth I think the world 

00:02:12.279 --> 00:02:14.029
 Muslim after years 

00:02:14.029 --> 00:02:17.389
 In the 90's 

00:02:17.389 --> 00:02:20.339
 the tax office, only a young person started 

00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:23.289
 protect 

00:02:23.289 --> 00:02:26.809
 but the AIDS of the look to brings the science process 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:31.049

00:02:31.679 --> 00:02:33.949
 do not do that city culture 

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:37.439
 so everything is behind is bad and the airport saints dumont 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:41.069
 n but the city tv only has to offer 

00:02:41.899 --> 00:02:44.379
 to place in the present 

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:48.299
 and I think this is very the very sensitive to people everything has to be 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:49.929
 create cultural 

00:02:49.929 --> 00:02:52.849
 becker when people say worried 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:56.550

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:57.669
 enrolled 

00:02:57.669 --> 00:02:59.629
 the student 

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:01.879

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:08.050
 lin nail kamel another few are very evident early than it does 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:11.609
 commitment 

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:13.179
 I think so 

00:03:13.179 --> 00:03:16.829
 we all have numbers we have to do is important because it simplifies life 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:18.719
 and death in March of last year 

00:03:18.719 --> 00:03:19.650

 the well-known cutting-edge teams of the graphic institute that precludes all that 

00:03:25.499 --> 00:03:27.419
 was made 

00:03:27.419 --> 00:03:28.559

00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:31.749
 different education 

00:03:31.749 --> 00:03:33.650

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:35.639
 if he did not 

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:38.639
 and was not one of the unknowns 

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:42.520
 no, your status is serious 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.600
 in business but I do not think so 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.559
 however the marker 

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:50.700
 practically an attraction also in northern Iraq are small things 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.639

00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:57.139
 accused orkut we have received back to receive this criterion 

00:03:57.139 --> 00:03:59.859
 the moment the way they are 

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:03.029
