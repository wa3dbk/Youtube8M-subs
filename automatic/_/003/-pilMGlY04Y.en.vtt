over the obesity in our culture I think
that<00:02:57.400> that<00:02:57.640> is<00:02:57.820> definitely<00:02:58.090> a<00:02:58.750> road<00:02:59.110> that<00:02:59.470> you

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
that that is definitely a road that you

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.920 
that that is definitely a road that you
should<00:02:59.860> look<00:02:59.980> at<00:03:00.160> because<00:03:00.400> it<00:03:00.850> is<00:03:01.390> a<00:03:01.420> full<00:03:01.720> body

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930

it's<00:03:07.060> a<00:03:07.150> way<00:03:07.390> to<00:03:08.340> possibly<00:03:09.340> get<00:03:09.760> out<00:03:09.880> of<00:03:10.000> the
