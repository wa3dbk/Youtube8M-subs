00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
so often I get asked the question what's

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.719

the<00:01:18.240> cause<00:01:18.509> of<00:01:18.540> an<00:01:18.869> eating<00:01:19.049> disorder<00:01:19.290> and<00:01:19.920> I

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
the cause of an eating disorder and I

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.389 
the cause of an eating disorder and I
would<00:01:20.880> have<00:01:21.060> to<00:01:21.180> say<00:01:21.360> there's<00:01:21.600> several

00:01:22.389 --> 00:01:22.399 
would have to say there's several

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:25.940 
would have to say there's several
emotions<00:01:23.399> are<00:01:23.790> big<00:01:24.210> part<00:01:24.570> of<00:01:24.720> it<00:01:24.869> I<00:01:25.110> don't

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
emotions are big part of it I don't

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.600 
emotions are big part of it I don't
think<00:01:26.130> that<00:01:26.880> society<00:01:27.390> plays<00:01:28.170> as<00:01:28.590> big<00:01:29.280> of<00:01:29.310> a

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
think that society plays as big of a

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.200 
think that society plays as big of a
role<00:01:29.820> as<00:01:30.210> so<00:01:30.659> many<00:01:30.960> people<00:01:31.500> think<00:01:32.090> you<00:01:33.090> know

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
role as so many people think you know

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.660 
role as so many people think you know
there<00:01:33.390> are<00:01:33.539> pictures<00:01:33.840> of<00:01:34.020> model<00:01:34.670> models

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
there are pictures of model models

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.340 
there are pictures of model models
everywhere<00:01:36.060> and<00:01:36.450> they're<00:01:36.570> airbrush

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
everywhere and they're airbrush

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.240 
everywhere and they're airbrush
I<00:01:37.380> myself<00:01:37.770> was<00:01:38.369> airbrush<00:01:39.030> several<00:01:39.570> times<00:01:40.250> so

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
I myself was airbrush several times so

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.679 
I myself was airbrush several times so
much<00:01:41.429> so<00:01:41.729> that<00:01:41.759> my<00:01:42.030> eyes<00:01:42.060> were<00:01:42.509> different

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
much so that my eyes were different

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.980 
much so that my eyes were different
colors<00:01:43.200> and<00:01:43.380> pictures<00:01:43.770> than<00:01:44.039> what<00:01:44.159> they<00:01:44.310> were

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
colors and pictures than what they were

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.240 
colors and pictures than what they were
however<00:01:45.990> I<00:01:46.289> think<00:01:46.830> really<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:48.000> main<00:01:48.270> calls

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
however I think really the main calls

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.680 
however I think really the main calls
physiologically<00:01:50.250> I<00:01:50.459> think<00:01:50.850> it<00:01:50.970> would<00:01:51.090> be<00:01:51.240> low

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:51.690 
physiologically I think it would be low

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:56.419 
physiologically I think it would be low
zinc<00:01:52.049> low<00:01:52.920> zinc<00:01:53.340> is<00:01:53.549> a<00:01:53.610> huge<00:01:54.649> huge<00:01:55.649> proponent

00:01:56.419 --> 00:01:56.429 
zinc low zinc is a huge huge proponent

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:58.760 
zinc low zinc is a huge huge proponent
