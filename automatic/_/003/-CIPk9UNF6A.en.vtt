00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.510 

so<00:00:00.420> the<00:00:00.690> next<00:00:00.810> thing<00:00:01.230> we're<00:00:01.530> going<00:00:01.680> to<00:00:01.740> do<00:00:01.920> is<00:00:02.190> I

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:02.520 
so the next thing we're going to do is I

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.349 
so the next thing we're going to do is I
think<00:00:02.580> we<00:00:02.939> have<00:00:02.990> filed<00:00:03.990> out<00:00:04.430> the<00:00:05.430> inside<00:00:06.029> of

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
think we have filed out the inside of

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.410 
think we have filed out the inside of
the<00:00:06.870> door<00:00:07.049> hole<00:00:07.470> a<00:00:07.790> large<00:00:08.790> a<00:00:08.970> little<00:00:09.300> bit

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
the door hole a large a little bit

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.870 
the door hole a large a little bit
larger<00:00:09.960> so<00:00:10.139> that<00:00:10.620> we<00:00:10.920> can<00:00:11.160> fit<00:00:11.550> our<00:00:11.820> door<00:00:12.719> knob

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:13.880 
larger so that we can fit our door knob

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:18.560 
larger so that we can fit our door knob
into<00:00:14.990> it<00:00:15.990> so<00:00:16.170> we're<00:00:16.350> going<00:00:16.440> to<00:00:17.270> note<00:00:18.270> the

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
into it so we're going to note the

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.750 
into it so we're going to note the
direction<00:00:19.020> since<00:00:19.470> this<00:00:19.619> is<00:00:19.830> a<00:00:19.980> passage<00:00:20.460> door

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
direction since this is a passage door

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.529 
direction since this is a passage door
we<00:00:21.240> want<00:00:21.449> to<00:00:21.720> place<00:00:22.109> the<00:00:22.460> angle<00:00:23.460> of<00:00:23.580> the<00:00:24.119> strike

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
we want to place the angle of the strike

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.820 
we want to place the angle of the strike
so<00:00:25.170> that<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:25.500> door<00:00:25.769> can<00:00:25.800> close<00:00:27.590> let's<00:00:28.590> see<00:00:28.769> if

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
so that the door can close let's see if

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.529 
so that the door can close let's see if
they'll<00:00:29.010> sit<00:00:29.369> in<00:00:29.460> there<00:00:29.580> oh<00:00:29.670> yeah<00:00:29.849> see<00:00:30.150> how<00:00:30.330> now

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
they'll sit in there oh yeah see how now

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.870 
they'll sit in there oh yeah see how now
that's<00:00:30.840> fitting<00:00:31.260> down<00:00:31.439> in<00:00:31.619> there<00:00:31.740> nicer<00:00:32.189> since

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
that's fitting down in there nicer since

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.790 
that's fitting down in there nicer since
we<00:00:33.059> filed<00:00:33.300> out<00:00:33.600> that<00:00:33.809> little<00:00:34.050> area<00:00:34.290> in<00:00:34.559> there

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
we filed out that little area in there

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.830 
we filed out that little area in there
now<00:00:35.280> we're<00:00:35.460> going<00:00:35.550> to<00:00:35.610> just<00:00:35.850> do<00:00:36.000> a<00:00:36.030> test<00:00:36.480> fit<00:00:36.719> on

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:38.840 
now we're going to just do a test fit on

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.760 
now we're going to just do a test fit on
now<00:00:39.840> I<00:00:39.899> need<00:00:40.200> to<00:00:40.230> figure<00:00:40.800> which<00:00:41.610> side<00:00:42.590> do<00:00:43.590> we

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
now I need to figure which side do we

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.709 
now I need to figure which side do we
want<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.219> say<00:00:44.399> this<00:00:44.640> is<00:00:44.789> just<00:00:44.969> a<00:00:45.059> passage

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
want the say this is just a passage

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.959 
want the say this is just a passage
doorway<00:00:46.260> but<00:00:46.920> I<00:00:46.980> think<00:00:47.340> we're<00:00:47.520> going<00:00:47.670> to<00:00:47.760> put

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
doorway but I think we're going to put

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.420 
doorway but I think we're going to put
this<00:00:48.180> out<00:00:48.450> here<00:00:48.890> so<00:00:49.890> we're<00:00:50.010> going<00:00:50.100> to<00:00:50.219> put<00:00:50.370> a

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
this out here so we're going to put a

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.490 
this out here so we're going to put a
trial<00:00:50.789> fit<00:00:51.239> now<00:00:51.600> you<00:00:51.660> notice<00:00:51.930> that<00:00:52.110> there's<00:00:52.440> a

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
trial fit now you notice that there's a

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.369 
trial fit now you notice that there's a
rounded<00:00:53.070> side<00:00:53.430> on<00:00:53.760> this<00:00:54.239> and<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.960> rounded

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
rounded side on this and the rounded

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.860 
rounded side on this and the rounded
side<00:00:55.649> will<00:00:55.829> go<00:00:55.980> into<00:00:56.190> here<00:00:56.579> like<00:00:56.820> that<00:00:57.059> so

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
side will go into here like that so

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.860 
side will go into here like that so
we're<00:00:58.170> going<00:00:58.379> to<00:00:59.180> do<00:01:00.180> a<00:01:00.210> trial<00:01:00.570> fit<00:01:01.050> in<00:01:01.379> here

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:02.870 
we're going to do a trial fit in here

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:07.130 
we're going to do a trial fit in here
oops<00:01:03.870> it'll<00:01:04.170> go<00:01:04.320> like<00:01:04.470> this<00:01:04.860> and<00:01:05.780> see<00:01:06.780> if<00:01:06.810> this

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
oops it'll go like this and see if this

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.899 
oops it'll go like this and see if this
is<00:01:07.350> going<00:01:07.650> to<00:01:07.770> work<00:01:09.290> okay<00:01:10.290> that<00:01:10.560> looks<00:01:10.880> ok<00:01:11.880> so

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
is going to work okay that looks ok so

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.670 
is going to work okay that looks ok so
that's<00:01:12.689> all<00:01:12.869> fitting<00:01:13.320> in<00:01:13.439> place<00:01:14.000> looks<00:01:15.000> like

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:15.680 
that's all fitting in place looks like

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.420 
that's all fitting in place looks like
sticking<00:01:16.680> out<00:01:16.860> a<00:01:16.890> little<00:01:17.040> bit<00:01:17.689> i'll<00:01:18.689> set<00:01:19.020> about

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430 
sticking out a little bit i'll set about

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.910 
sticking out a little bit i'll set about
just<00:01:20.430> a<00:01:20.580> little<00:01:20.850> bit<00:01:20.939> of<00:01:21.060> wood<00:01:21.330> or<00:01:21.689> what<00:01:21.900> now<00:01:22.500> it

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
appears as though i'm going to need to

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.969 
appears as though i'm going to need to
route<00:01:26.970> or<00:01:28.310> clean<00:01:29.310> out<00:01:29.460> a<00:01:29.490> little<00:01:29.939> bit<00:01:30.299> more

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:30.979 
route or clean out a little bit more

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:36.200 
route or clean out a little bit more
from<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.130> top<00:01:32.579> and<00:01:33.079> the<00:01:34.079> bottom<00:01:35.090> just<00:01:36.090> a

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
from the top and the bottom just a

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.460 
from the top and the bottom just a
little<00:01:36.420> bit<00:01:36.780> so<00:01:39.079> this<00:01:40.079> is<00:01:40.170> how<00:01:40.290> it<00:01:40.439> is

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
little bit so this is how it is

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.440 
little bit so this is how it is
sometimes<00:01:40.920> in<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.610> real<00:01:41.850> world<00:01:42.119> you<00:01:42.299> just

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
sometimes in the real world you just

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.679 
sometimes in the real world you just
have<00:01:42.840> to<00:01:45.290> fine-tune<00:01:46.290> it<00:01:46.560> just<00:01:46.860> a<00:01:46.979> little<00:01:47.009> bit

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:47.689 
have to fine-tune it just a little bit

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:51.200 
have to fine-tune it just a little bit
ok<00:01:48.689> here<00:01:48.930> we<00:01:48.960> go

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:59.960 

a<00:01:55.400> triumph<00:01:56.400> it<00:01:56.820> again<00:01:57.240> of<00:01:57.479> our<00:01:58.140> doorknob<00:01:58.970> it's

00:01:59.960 --> 00:01:59.970 
a triumph it again of our doorknob it's

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.050 
a triumph it again of our doorknob it's
looking<00:02:00.420> pretty<00:02:00.720> good<00:02:00.960> now<00:02:01.020> I<00:02:01.650> think<00:02:02.100> that's

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
looking pretty good now I think that's

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.810 
looking pretty good now I think that's
fitting<00:02:03.630> nicely<00:02:04.550> everything's<00:02:05.550> fitting

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
fitting nicely everything's fitting

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:11.930 
fitting nicely everything's fitting
nicely<00:02:08.660> hmm<00:02:10.100> sticking<00:02:11.100> out<00:02:11.280> a<00:02:11.310> little<00:02:11.430> bit

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
nicely hmm sticking out a little bit

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.020 
nicely hmm sticking out a little bit
right<00:02:12.750> there<00:02:12.810> what's<00:02:13.260> going<00:02:13.380> on<00:02:13.739> okay<00:02:14.280> there

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
right there what's going on okay there

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.800 
right there what's going on okay there
we<00:02:15.060> go<00:02:15.180> that's<00:02:15.690> better<00:02:15.950> that's<00:02:16.950> better<00:02:17.810> okay

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
we go that's better that's better okay

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.150 
we go that's better that's better okay
looks<00:02:19.110> like<00:02:19.200> we're<00:02:19.440> getting<00:02:19.590> somewhere<00:02:19.980> now

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
looks like we're getting somewhere now

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:25.060 
looks like we're getting somewhere now
and<00:02:20.459> then<00:02:21.209> we'll<00:02:21.420> try<00:02:21.810> to<00:02:22.100> put<00:02:23.100> this<00:02:23.280> side<00:02:23.640> on

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.070 
and then we'll try to put this side on

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:28.160 
and then we'll try to put this side on
just<00:02:26.070> fit<00:02:26.400> it<00:02:26.519> on<00:02:26.640> there<00:02:27.000> sometimes<00:02:27.989> you<00:02:28.080> have

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
just fit it on there sometimes you have

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.590 
just fit it on there sometimes you have
to<00:02:28.290> turn<00:02:28.530> these<00:02:28.739> little<00:02:29.070> knobs<00:02:29.310> around<00:02:29.910> the

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
to turn these little knobs around the

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.340 
to turn these little knobs around the
door<00:02:31.140> lock<00:02:31.410> knob<00:02:31.739> to<00:02:32.040> get<00:02:32.190> it<00:02:32.280> to<00:02:32.660> the<00:02:33.660> seat<00:02:34.110> in
