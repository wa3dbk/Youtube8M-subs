00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.100 
that for whatever reason I just won't
stream<00:01:54.180> if<00:01:54.360> I'm<00:01:54.509> you<00:01:54.659> know<00:01:54.750> I'm<00:01:54.810> not<00:01:54.840> in<00:01:55.020> the

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
stream if I'm you know I'm not in the

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.300 
stream if I'm you know I'm not in the
best<00:01:55.259> mood<00:01:55.439> or<00:01:55.680> something<00:01:55.710> like<00:01:56.040> that<00:01:56.100> because

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
best mood or something like that because

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.080 
best mood or something like that because
I<00:01:56.430> always<00:01:56.520> try<00:01:56.880> to<00:01:56.909> be<00:01:57.210> really<00:01:58.200> excited<00:01:58.799> and<00:01:59.090> I

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
I always try to be really excited and I

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.730 
I always try to be really excited and I
guess<00:02:00.420> motivated<00:02:01.020> when<00:02:01.140> I<00:02:01.200> screen<00:02:01.500> I<00:02:01.530> think

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
guess motivated when I screen I think

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.410 
guess motivated when I screen I think
it's<00:02:01.860> really<00:02:02.040> cool<00:02:02.310> that<00:02:02.369> the<00:02:02.820> phase<00:02:03.119> one

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
it's really cool that the phase one

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.719 
it's really cool that the phase one
actually<00:02:03.930> just<00:02:04.110> came<00:02:04.229> out<00:02:04.439> because<00:02:05.340> it<00:02:05.640> gives

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
actually just came out because it gives

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.520 
actually just came out because it gives
people<00:02:05.969> a<00:02:06.149> lot<00:02:06.270> more<00:02:06.450> motivation<00:02:07.140> it<00:02:07.229> makes<00:02:07.380> it

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
people a lot more motivation it makes it

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.680
