00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.689 

one<00:04:28.900> kind<00:04:29.199> of<00:04:29.350> cheap<00:04:29.560> element<00:04:30.010> to<00:04:30.100> the<00:04:30.220> game<00:04:30.250> is

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:30.699 
one kind of cheap element to the game is

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:32.490 
one kind of cheap element to the game is
that<00:04:30.760> after<00:04:31.360> you've<00:04:31.480> destroyed<00:04:31.900> all<00:04:32.169> the

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
enemies on a screen if you come back to

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:37.530 
enemies on a screen if you come back to
that<00:04:34.930> screen<00:04:35.230> they<00:04:35.770> respawn<00:04:36.180> yeah<00:04:37.180> it's<00:04:37.389> one

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:37.540 
that screen they respawn yeah it's one

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:41.070 
that screen they respawn yeah it's one
of<00:04:37.570> those<00:04:37.750> games<00:04:38.520> come<00:04:39.520> on<00:04:39.610> back<00:04:39.880> up<00:04:40.060> there<00:04:40.270> are

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.080 
of those games come on back up there are

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.790 
of those games come on back up there are
you<00:04:41.260> stupid

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 
you stupid

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.820 
you stupid
fats

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:44.830 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:48.030 

blue<00:04:45.340> snails<00:04:46.290> how<00:04:47.290> kind<00:04:47.500> of<00:04:47.530> enemies<00:04:47.889> are

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:48.040 
blue snails how kind of enemies are

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.770 
blue snails how kind of enemies are
these<00:04:48.220> anyway

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:48.780 
these anyway

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:51.540 
these anyway
of<00:04:49.780> course<00:04:50.110> the<00:04:50.320> cheapness<00:04:50.560> works<00:04:51.040> both<00:04:51.280> ways

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:51.550 
of course the cheapness works both ways

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:53.580 
of course the cheapness works both ways
and<00:04:51.850> if<00:04:52.180> you<00:04:52.270> find<00:04:52.479> a<00:04:52.630> room<00:04:52.870> where<00:04:53.139> the<00:04:53.229> enemies

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:53.590 
and if you find a room where the enemies

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:55.680 
and if you find a room where the enemies
are<00:04:53.620> easily<00:04:54.040> destroyed<00:04:54.520> you<00:04:55.030> can<00:04:55.060> return<00:04:55.510> to

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:55.690 
are easily destroyed you can return to

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:57.930 
are easily destroyed you can return to
the<00:04:55.780> room<00:04:55.960> over<00:04:56.410> and<00:04:56.560> over<00:04:56.740> again<00:04:56.940> continuing

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:57.940 
the room over and over again continuing

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:00.270 
the room over and over again continuing
to<00:04:58.120> reap<00:04:58.330> the<00:04:58.510> rewards<00:04:59.020> this<00:04:59.650> is<00:04:59.830> a<00:04:59.860> great<00:05:00.100> way

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:00.280 
to reap the rewards this is a great way

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.550 
to reap the rewards this is a great way
to<00:05:00.310> restore<00:05:00.880> your<00:05:01.000> energy<00:05:01.060> and<00:05:01.660> also<00:05:02.139> to<00:05:02.350> gain

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:02.560

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:07.129 
to restore your energy and also to gain
more<00:05:02.770> force<00:05:03.160> which<00:05:03.850> can<00:05:04.090> lead<00:05:04.270> to<00:05:04.300> a<00:05:04.479> powerup

I<00:05:17.770> really<00:05:18.070> enjoyed<00:05:18.460> this<00:05:18.639> game<00:05:18.760> there<00:05:19.120> is<00:05:19.150> one

00:05:19.529 --> 00:05:19.539 
I really enjoyed this game there is one

00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:20.940 
I really enjoyed this game there is one
thing<00:05:19.720> I<00:05:19.810> have<00:05:19.840> to<00:05:19.990> complain<00:05:20.410> about<00:05:20.470> and

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:20.950 
thing I have to complain about and

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:23.100 
thing I have to complain about and
that's<00:05:21.190> the<00:05:21.400> sheer<00:05:21.700> size<00:05:22.030> of<00:05:22.330> these<00:05:22.479> levels<00:05:22.960> I

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:23.110 
that's the sheer size of these levels I

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:25.080 
that's the sheer size of these levels I
mean<00:05:23.139> they're<00:05:23.380> just<00:05:23.530> huge<00:05:23.950> and<00:05:24.550> you'll<00:05:24.880> often

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:25.090 
mean they're just huge and you'll often

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:27.120 
mean they're just huge and you'll often
find<00:05:25.450> yourself<00:05:25.510> having<00:05:25.900> to<00:05:26.050> backtrack<00:05:26.380> quite

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:27.130 
find yourself having to backtrack quite

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:28.800 
find yourself having to backtrack quite
a<00:05:27.160> bit<00:05:27.460> to<00:05:27.850> get<00:05:27.970> back<00:05:28.030> to<00:05:28.389> where<00:05:28.539> you<00:05:28.630> need<00:05:28.750> to

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:28.810 
a bit to get back to where you need to

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:31.680 
a bit to get back to where you need to
be<00:05:29.280> it<00:05:30.280> also<00:05:30.430> doesn't<00:05:30.760> help<00:05:30.940> that<00:05:31.060> many<00:05:31.449> of<00:05:31.600> the

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:31.690 
be it also doesn't help that many of the

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:33.650 
be it also doesn't help that many of the
rooms<00:05:31.930> look<00:05:32.200> very<00:05:32.470> similar<00:05:32.919> to<00:05:33.100> the<00:05:33.190> next<00:05:33.460> one

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:33.660 
rooms look very similar to the next one

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:36.450 
rooms look very similar to the next one
it<00:05:34.660> wasn't<00:05:34.840> so<00:05:35.260> crazy<00:05:35.500> that<00:05:35.770> I<00:05:35.919> had<00:05:36.130> to<00:05:36.220> draw<00:05:36.430> a

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:36.460 
it wasn't so crazy that I had to draw a

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:38.490 
it wasn't so crazy that I had to draw a
map<00:05:36.700> or<00:05:36.910> anything<00:05:36.940> like<00:05:37.360> that<00:05:37.419> but<00:05:37.870> it<00:05:38.320> got

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:38.500 
map or anything like that but it got

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:41.520 
map or anything like that but it got
pretty<00:05:38.710> close<00:05:39.780> the<00:05:40.780> music<00:05:41.110> kept<00:05:41.289> me<00:05:41.410> going

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:41.530 
pretty close the music kept me going

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:43.529 
pretty close the music kept me going
though<00:05:41.860> and<00:05:42.190> the<00:05:42.460> sheer<00:05:42.669> quirkiness<00:05:43.120> of<00:05:43.360> some

00:05:43.529 --> 00:05:43.539 
though and the sheer quirkiness of some

00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:54.060 
though and the sheer quirkiness of some
of<00:05:43.599> these<00:05:43.660> enemies

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:54.070 

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:56.770 

interestingly<00:05:55.070> the<00:05:55.610> game<00:05:55.820> had<00:05:56.030> two<00:05:56.300> totally

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:56.780 
interestingly the game had two totally

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:59.110 
interestingly the game had two totally
different<00:05:56.840> soundtracks<00:05:57.710> the<00:05:58.310> normal<00:05:58.760> setting

00:05:59.110 --> 00:05:59.120 
different soundtracks the normal setting

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:01.240 
different soundtracks the normal setting
which<00:05:59.300> I'm<00:05:59.480> listening<00:05:59.810> to<00:05:59.960> right<00:06:00.140> now<00:06:00.200> and<00:06:00.710> a

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:01.250 
which I'm listening to right now and a

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:03.370 
which I'm listening to right now and a
special<00:06:01.790> one<00:06:01.970> which<00:06:02.540> utilized<00:06:03.110> the

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:03.380 
special one which utilized the

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:05.650 
special one which utilized the
soundboard<00:06:03.830> 2<00:06:04.160> expansion<00:06:04.820> it<00:06:05.240> was<00:06:05.390> a<00:06:05.420> higher

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:05.660 
soundboard 2 expansion it was a higher
