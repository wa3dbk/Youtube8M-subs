 hello everyone my name is Alberto Guzman 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.960
 and today we are going to learn how to install a 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.940
 rom cyanogenmod on our samsung 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.940
 galaxy s 4 declared 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:14.580
 yes 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.260
 before continuing with the video tutorial 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:26.390
 I want to explain to you that this tutorial is 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:28.910
 exclusively for the samsung galaxy s 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.490
 4 declared and under no circumstances 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.650
 I tried to do it on a Haitian phone 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:38.269
 anti or mobile you because it can damage your 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:42.170
 team this phone is a sgh and 337 m 

00:00:38.269 --> 00:00:43.580
 in cyanogenmod the code is jf l de jean 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.900
 canadian and the version that we're going 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:47.030
 install is an action today in mod 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:48.810
 knightley that is updated all the 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:52.000
 nights 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:54.370
 obviously to do this installation 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.120
 of this role have to be users and 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:59.680
 supervisors that down the 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.590
 Description I'm going to leave all 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.660
 links of the how-to tutorial 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:07.710
 phone and how can root users be 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:11.860
 where they can get rice and 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:13.330
 beds that are the balls that we 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.990
 let's do before installing chrome 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:18.760
 first of all turn it off 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.750
 or press the power button 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.750
 and they do not pay 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.990
 ok now to restart our phone 

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:33.870
 in recovery mode already for those who are 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:37.380
 root users 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:42.080
 you have to press the power button the 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.080
 home button and volume + button 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:47.390
 once our phone looks the 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:50.030
 samsung logo let's go the button 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:53.610
 power and we let us tighten up 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:56.490
 that goes up in the recovery 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.260
 there is already going to go up in the recovery and what 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:02.400
 is what we are going to do we are going to do 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:05.870
 whites datafactory now like to the 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.870
 league and each factor and ready 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:25.230
 back we're going to make the other data cache 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.230
 partition 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.940
 we give you 10 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:42.010
 once we finish we go back 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:46.450
 once he has done the whites we are going to 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:49.420
 give install shift and we will give choice 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:52.480
 are explain and look where in the 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:54.100
 card we keep in our rom and we go 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.060
 here where it was that in this case 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:57.060
 It's the semen set 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.440
 and let's give them here 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.990
 give a little bit what was installed although 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.350
 I'm going to tell the video and I'm going to 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:08.350
 advance 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:17.140
 once installed our 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:20.510
 let's now install the regulated 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:24.890
 We will give choice from explain of 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:27.370
 new and let's find the one that says gap and 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:27.370
 Street 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:32.680
 in this case it would be this 

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:35.379
 10 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:37.870
 and we hope this will install talde 

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:40.959
 little bit less since it is the 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:43.840
 Google applications is a file 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:48.310
 less heavy as it comes too now 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:50.270
 let's go back to the beginning and with the button 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:54.080
 of home 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:56.560
 with the power button let's give it 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:58.599
 ribot system now 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:03.030
 and automatically the phone is going to 

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:03.030
 restart in the temple 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:09.370
 provided 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:10.930
 of routing a new one is installed a rum a 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:14.109
 new branch 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:17.070
 the phone takes around a 

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:20.229
 minute or one minute 50 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:22.560
 in climbing but that's completely 

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:22.560
 normal 

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:28.120
 that is that as the rom for the first time 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:28.120
 going up then 

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:34.749
 very well we have here the beginning of 

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:36.090
 cyanogenmod there we can choose our 

00:04:34.749 --> 00:04:38.910
 language 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:41.060
 in this case I'm going to leave it that way 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:44.000
 English like this 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:47.030
 English from the USA 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.340
 and let's give it the chip 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:50.960
 because obviously when you what 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:54.440
 install you are going to put your 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:57.980
 google account but to try the rom 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:05:01.600
 I'm going to jump all that and I can 

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:04.139
 teach that she is a pretty smart rom 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:06.930
 what it is 

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:12.300
 good kitkat we have here our 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:16.529
 phone with cyanogenmod 111 a rom 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:19.560
 based on 4.4 kitkat and it's pretty 

00:05:16.529 --> 00:05:22.349
 optimized for our phone and it's 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:26.069
 for me one of the best with which 

00:05:22.349 --> 00:05:29.710
 can take advantage of the experience of 

00:05:26.069 --> 00:05:32.560
 android the purest of which 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:36.200
 samsung you get him you 're good what 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:38.630
 I train here I do not like it at all 

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:42.160
 let's go to the settings to try 

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:42.160
 that a version 4.4 points 

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:51.760
 there we see the android logo 4.4 points 

00:05:53.880 --> 00:06:00.020
 and here we see an animation that are 

00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:00.020
 all versions of Android 

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:07.260
 and nothing that has been all my name is 

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:08.639
 Alberto Guzman for Android 100 x 35 y 

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:10.760
 remember that we are all androids 

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:13.270
 boricuas 

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:13.270
 ah
