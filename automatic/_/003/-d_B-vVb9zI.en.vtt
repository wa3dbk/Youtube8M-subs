00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
that unwrap UVW creates so I have here

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.410 
that unwrap UVW creates so I have here
model<00:00:15.710> low<00:00:16.710> poly<00:00:16.949> model<00:00:17.039> and<00:00:17.430> if<00:00:18.090> I<00:00:18.269> apply

model low poly model and if I apply
unwrap<00:00:19.410> you'll<00:00:19.740> be<00:00:19.920> modified<00:00:20.429> to<00:00:20.670> it<00:00:20.820> we<00:00:21.480> can

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
unwrap you'll be modified to it we can

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.320 
unwrap you'll be modified to it we can
see<00:00:21.900> these<00:00:22.109> green<00:00:22.679> lines<00:00:22.920> appear<00:00:23.609> which

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
see these green lines appear which

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.499 
see these green lines appear which
represent<00:00:24.960> the<00:00:25.050> seams<00:00:25.410> that<00:00:26.119> unwrapped<00:00:27.119> UB

00:00:27.499 --> 00:00:27.509 
represent the seams that unwrapped UB

represent the seams that unwrapped UB
modifier<00:00:28.220> creates<00:00:29.220> on<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:29.849> default

00:00:30.909 --> 00:00:30.919 
modifier creates on the default

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:34.280 
modifier creates on the default
sometimes<00:00:31.919> they<00:00:32.820> look<00:00:33.000> okay<00:00:33.360> and<00:00:33.630> you<00:00:33.990> can<00:00:34.140> use

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
sometimes they look okay and you can use

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.170 
sometimes they look okay and you can use
them<00:00:34.530> but<00:00:34.560> sometimes<00:00:35.250> you<00:00:35.460> just<00:00:35.490> want<00:00:35.910> to<00:00:36.060> get

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
them but sometimes you just want to get

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.860 
them but sometimes you just want to get
rid<00:00:36.420> of<00:00:36.480> them<00:00:36.980> so<00:00:37.980> here<00:00:38.880> are<00:00:39.030> two<00:00:39.240> ways<00:00:39.450> how<00:00:39.840> you

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
rid of them so here are two ways how you

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.060 
rid of them so here are two ways how you
can<00:00:40.200> do<00:00:40.320> that<00:00:40.820> so<00:00:41.820> you<00:00:41.850> start<00:00:42.360> with<00:00:42.660> your<00:00:43.070> mesh

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
can do that so you start with your mesh

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.980 
can do that so you start with your mesh
and<00:00:45.030> you<00:00:45.060> can<00:00:46.130> right<00:00:47.130> click<00:00:47.160> on<00:00:47.550> it<00:00:47.700> and

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:47.990 
and you can right click on it and

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:52.010 
and you can right click on it and
convert<00:00:48.990> it<00:00:49.110> to<00:00:49.140> editable<00:00:49.380> mesh<00:00:49.770> and<00:00:50.460> go<00:00:51.240> under

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
convert it to editable mesh and go under

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.340 
convert it to editable mesh and go under
utilities<00:00:52.590> and<00:00:53.160> click<00:00:53.790> on<00:00:53.970> more<00:00:54.210> and<00:00:54.650> select

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
utilities and click on more and select

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:02.030

uvw remove click OK

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:07.010 
uvw remove click OK
sometimes<00:01:03.000> you<00:01:03.270> have<00:01:03.480> to<00:01:03.690> do<00:01:03.840> it<00:01:04.020> twice

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.349 

and<00:01:07.350> then<00:01:07.770> just<00:01:08.009> select<00:01:08.340> your<00:01:08.460> model<00:01:09.210> and

and then just select your model and
click<00:01:10.049> on<00:01:10.259> remove<00:01:10.640> UVW<00:01:12.020> and<00:01:13.369> that's<00:01:14.369> pretty

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
click on remove UVW and that's pretty

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:14.990 
click on remove UVW and that's pretty
much<00:01:14.670> it

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
much it

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.169 
much it
going<00:01:15.600> back<00:01:15.929> to<00:01:15.979> modify<00:01:16.979> panel<00:01:17.189> right<00:01:17.969> click

00:01:18.169 --> 00:01:18.179 
going back to modify panel right click

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:20.660 
going back to modify panel right click
on<00:01:18.329> it<00:01:18.420> again<00:01:19.069> convert<00:01:20.069> it<00:01:20.189> to<00:01:20.219> editable<00:01:20.399> poly

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
on it again convert it to editable poly

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.469 
on it again convert it to editable poly
and<00:01:21.380> apply<00:01:22.380> unwrap<00:01:23.130> you<00:01:23.460> be<00:01:23.610> modified<00:01:24.119> to<00:01:24.149> it

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
and apply unwrap you be modified to it

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.600 
and apply unwrap you be modified to it
as<00:01:24.780> you<00:01:25.079> can<00:01:25.259> see<00:01:25.469> here<00:01:27.170> the<00:01:28.170> green<00:01:28.409> scene<00:01:28.920> seam

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
as you can see here the green scene seam

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.660 
as you can see here the green scene seam
lines<00:01:29.850> are<00:01:30.329> not<00:01:30.770> present<00:01:31.770> anymore<00:01:31.950> and<00:01:32.340> if<00:01:32.520> you

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
lines are not present anymore and if you

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.069 
lines are not present anymore and if you
open<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.209> UV<00:01:33.420> editor<00:01:33.979> you<00:01:34.979> can<00:01:35.009> see<00:01:35.899> we<00:01:36.899> get

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
open the UV editor you can see we get

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:42.810 
open the UV editor you can see we get
this<00:01:38.179> model<00:01:39.179> without<00:01:39.630> seams<00:01:40.020> at<00:01:40.200> all

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:49.170 

so<00:01:43.450> the<00:01:43.930> other<00:01:44.140> way<00:01:44.409> is<00:01:45.250> to

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:49.180 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:53.660 

to<00:01:49.750> apply<00:01:49.990> I<00:01:50.080> unwrap<00:01:51.040> you<00:01:51.250> be<00:01:51.370> modified<00:01:51.820> and

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
to apply I unwrap you be modified and

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.910 
to apply I unwrap you be modified and
going<00:01:54.670> to<00:01:54.790> polygon<00:01:55.180> selection<00:01:55.510> and<00:01:55.920> pressing

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
going to polygon selection and pressing

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.980 
going to polygon selection and pressing

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
polygons and under Edit UVs

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:07.110 
polygons and under Edit UVs
you<00:02:02.200> just<00:02:02.500> select<00:02:02.830> a<00:02:03.070> plane<00:02:04.410> for<00:02:05.410> Y<00:02:05.620> and<00:02:06.120> click

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:07.120 
you just select a plane for Y and click

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:10.930 
you just select a plane for Y and click
on<00:02:07.330> quick<00:02:07.630> planar<00:02:08.289> map

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.490 

and<00:02:11.540> you're<00:02:12.080> done<00:02:13.340> it's<00:02:14.210> the<00:02:14.390> same<00:02:14.660> thing<00:02:15.170> and

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
if you open UV editor again you get a

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.160 
if you open UV editor again you get a
little<00:02:19.340> bit<00:02:19.430> a<00:02:19.640> different<00:02:19.700> kind<00:02:20.510> of<00:02:20.600> look<00:02:20.990> of

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
little bit a different kind of look of

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:26.860 
little bit a different kind of look of
your<00:02:23.110> model<00:02:24.110> as<00:02:24.290> before<00:02:24.860> and<00:02:25.190> this<00:02:25.970> this<00:02:26.450> this

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
your model as before and this this this

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:32.530 
your model as before and this this this
this<00:02:27.710> technique<00:02:28.220> I<00:02:28.490> prefer<00:02:30.760> when<00:02:31.760> I<00:02:31.790> create<00:02:32.300> my

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
this technique I prefer when I create my

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.670 
this technique I prefer when I create my
models<00:02:33.340> so<00:02:34.720> this<00:02:35.720> is<00:02:35.810> pretty<00:02:35.960> much<00:02:36.170> it<00:02:36.350> for
