00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:08.220
 Hello everyone, you ate and we continue 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.440
 consider starcraft replays 2 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.230
 Well, today we have protas against 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.420
 protoss nick and all this week will be 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.150
 is also dedicated to nickname because in 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:21.900
 comments you already say why one 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:25.080
 durable like this 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.800
 turret 11 so immediately go on 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.920
 intelligence 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.900
 naturally different angles the game we have 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.420
 I'll tell you a short 6 minutes 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.160
 so especially for a long game not 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.809
 count on 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.930
 At first, we are all standard pylon 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:42.750
 worker and stuff, we can 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.120
 it is natural to see on the tab 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.700
 production but here is red to those 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.110
 decides to make a proxy proxy barracks 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.440
 natural most likely two pieces 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:55.230
 so then yellow quickly come on 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.629
 base and kill the whole thing naturally 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.390
 give iran don't ask very hard to find 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.579
 but thanks to intelligence you can understand that 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.400
 something that is not here so that's not as 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:08.810
 once walked completely along the trajectory 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:11.100
 sees that even the pylon is not there for some reason 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.170
 noticed that there is even gas but 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.890
 There are no other buildings, but this immediately suggests 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:21.060
 the thought that the opponent summer dreams someone 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:23.130
 proxy barracks here nickname looks out 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.680
 it first checks the base 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.390
 then he will follow the trajectory 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.030
 somewhere here and everything is natural 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.920
 this thing he noticed here rather 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.259
 just not just zil kibu is likely 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.409
 even a stalker and because cybernet to 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:40.400
 coming here too and here's the nickname we have it all 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.650
 the case is here 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.780
 he did after all come down here 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:47.390
 unit most likely it will do 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.310
 because cybernetics is not there everything is all 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:52.190
 logical nick starts to attack and 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:55.640
 thus shows that it is all 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:58.310
 found here already coming out first force then 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.860
 kills the cork that sawed the gate 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:04.000
 take them just forgot about her and here at 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:07.179
 we have almost too ready two 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.619
 hut but bostanuli 

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:12.200
 gate in which no one is strictly here 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.670
 there is a fight here there is a small 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.280
 advantage because there is 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:19.640
 cork but in theory you can now got out 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:21.290
 the other will come out and calm everything 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.480
 this case will help here too 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:27.500
 additional trial and that the forces were 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:29.990
 Protas are generally impudent and puts 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:34.190
 bring the pylon here so 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:37.670
 say warpad stalkers when war by 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:40.220
 law but although the orb has not yet been investigated 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.080
 not even beginning to be explored now 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:45.050
 nickname will be a little problem because 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:47.720
 two gold against two stalkers is all 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:49.850
 business quickly die first done here 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.250
 the cork flies too taken to her 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:53.750
 responded naturally I drank it here 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.540
 rather today is not for war pasta it 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:58.070
 so he could do the whole thing below 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.769
 highlight them believe a few traffic jams 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:02.720
 and yours are all equal now 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:06.080
 only thought poor stalker 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:08.390
 stalker shipped it take back 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.430
 so that everything was not bayonets here this pylon 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:13.430
 He always highlights everything 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:17.090
 retreat back unprofitable and now just 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:18.980
 look at anyone what pm because here 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:23.360
 control goes very cruel 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:25.460
 Stalkers are exchanged and still comes out 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.620
 one extra breaks them sometimes 

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:30.350
 traffic jams to 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:35.060
 stalker shot not panikovsky 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:38.060
 stalker on traffic jams thereby saves 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:38.750
 energy and periodically it makes it 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:42.460
 it's all about 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:45.620
 get out here we have this 

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:48.860
 tiny extraction of minerals and gas 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:51.440
 more workers are not built and now need 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:53.030
 as fast as possible niku kill the pylon here 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:56.260
 there is already a slight superiority 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:59.590
 the number of stalkers and 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:03.350
 hunt she removes they still finish off 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:05.440
 paw raises that push failed because 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:08.120
 what well when do you always push 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:11.720
 the one who has the advantage 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:14.840
 and because of this it is simply written to the game and 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:16.730
 man goes about mistakes i don't know 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:21.130
 what you say may be worth 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:24.560
 still dig more stalkers and 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:26.840
 so in arrogant not to reduce the amount 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:29.150
 mining samples but build at least 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:33.110
 a couple more pieces to increase by 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:35.360
 minerals went faster here warp 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:37.970
 it would study to on stalker and already in 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:42.230
 impudent rushed here because on 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:43.580
 The main building 9 was sometimes energy co 

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:46.000
 the parties were not competent 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:49.220
 made he had an advantage over 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.470
 the workers and he sometimes led them to 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:54.440
 the enemy's stalker was distracted by them and 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:56.139
 thus sometimes exchanging themselves in 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:58.780
 plus and 

00:04:56.139 --> 00:05:01.780
 and most likely still depends on the micro 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:05.349
 controls that players do in this 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:07.210
 situations if a person is mistaken then this 

00:05:05.349 --> 00:05:10.090
 he is worth losing or winning 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:11.800
 well for today all of this from 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:14.560
 so short a short release on 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:18.659
 fused turned out and see you in 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:18.659
 next releases bye
