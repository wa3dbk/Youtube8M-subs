 Hello, how about youtube friends? 

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:07.359
 greets diego hernÃ¡ndez good in this 

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:09.250
 new video I come to present you a 

00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:11.530
 program that serves to make 

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:14.230
 overclocking to our video card 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:16.780
 in a safe and easy way if you ask 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:19.120
 what is this good for? This is for 

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:21.190
 take advantage and give more power to our 

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:23.890
 video card when playing or 

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:26.289
 make good frames this program to 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:29.680
 I have worked perfectly and not 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:32.050
 It has given me no error I clarify 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:34.030
 I recommend that you do this on a laptop 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:37.149
 Well, the safest thing is not to 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:39.729
 I recommend that you update your 

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:42.819
 graphics card before doing the steps 

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:45.370
 of this tutorial in the description of 

00:00:42.819 --> 00:00:47.679
 video I'll be leaving the official link 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.719
 the program just open the page 

00:00:47.679 --> 00:00:52.649
 they will be coming out what is the 

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:52.649
 download of the program 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:08.360
 Once the file is downloaded 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:12.940
 will be something like this 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.940
 you right click and extract here 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:21.430
 and they will have two files but 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:23.860
 We only deal this file you 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:26.200
 we right click and execute as 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:31.200
 administrator 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:31.200
 we select the language we give next 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.900
 we accept the terms 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.560
 we give next 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:43.090
 and let's install 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:56.640
 once the installation is finished 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:59.759
 we uncheck this box and we give 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.950
 end they will be appearing the 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:06.470
 interface of the program and we're going to 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.470
 concentrate only in this box 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:12.920
 good by default to you it will appear 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:16.280
 another amount in that box what I 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:19.250
 I recommend that you increase it by 20 or 25 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:21.620
 megahertz and if it does not give them 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:25.190
 no problem can increase a 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:27.620
 little more than 10 to 15 megahertz then 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:30.960
 we go to settings and we go to 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:34.970
 the fan tab 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.970
 and check this box 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.950
 finally we only press this button 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:47.250
 we give you to apply we restart our 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:50.610
 computer so that changes arise 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:53.010
 effect my latest recommendations are 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.140
 that they do not touch many things and that 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.420
 surpass megahertz since 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:59.720
 can burn the video card and if 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.400
 I burn it, I do not take responsibility 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.650
 well this would be all I hope them 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.200
 work give me a like to the video 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.440
 subscribe we'll see each other until the next 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.440
 bye
