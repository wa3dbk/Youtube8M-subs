in there I'll just shush this around a
little<00:02:09.840> bit<00:02:10.550> just<00:02:11.550> so<00:02:11.640> that<00:02:11.730> it<00:02:12.200> goes<00:02:13.200> in

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
little bit just so that it goes in

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:27.380 
little bit just so that it goes in
evenly<00:02:20.450> for<00:02:21.450> a<00:02:21.540> second<00:02:25.760> so<00:02:26.760> I've<00:02:26.880> now<00:02:27.060> placed

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
evenly for a second so I've now placed

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.380 
evenly for a second so I've now placed
it<00:02:27.630> into<00:02:27.930> the<00:02:28.080> bread<00:02:28.260> machine<00:02:28.590> and<00:02:29.340> I'm<00:02:30.180> now

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
it into the bread machine and I'm now

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.140 
it into the bread machine and I'm now
choosing<00:02:31.130> the<00:02:32.130> first<00:02:32.370> of<00:02:32.580> all<00:02:32.730> switching<00:02:33.060> it

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
choosing the first of all switching it

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.040 
choosing the first of all switching it
on<00:02:33.239> and<00:02:34.190> then<00:02:35.190> choosing<00:02:35.610> from<00:02:36.060> the<00:02:36.239> menu<00:02:36.630> the

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
on and then choosing from the menu the

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.220 
on and then choosing from the menu the
quick<00:02:37.650> menu

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
quick menu

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:44.060 
quick menu
so<00:02:40.230> that's<00:02:40.440> programmed<00:02:41.070> to<00:02:41.370> and<00:02:42.739> then<00:02:43.739> the

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
so that's programmed to and then the

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:49.220 
so that's programmed to and then the
color<00:02:44.430> which<00:02:44.880> I<00:02:45.090> still<00:02:45.510> like<00:02:45.920> medium<00:02:46.920> and<00:02:48.230> then

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
color which I still like medium and then

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.460 
color which I still like medium and then
the<00:02:49.500> loaf<00:02:49.709> size<00:02:50.239> let<00:02:51.239> me<00:02:51.330> just<00:02:51.570> check<00:02:51.810> I<00:02:52.170> think

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
the loaf size let me just check I think

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:57.729 
the loaf size let me just check I think
it's<00:02:52.620> two<00:02:52.860> pound<00:02:54.019> no<00:02:55.019> actually<00:02:55.860> this<00:02:56.190> is<00:02:56.250> not

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:57.739 
it's two pound no actually this is not

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:00.650 
it's two pound no actually this is not
so<00:02:58.739> I<00:02:58.980> will<00:02:59.190> be<00:02:59.340> putting<00:02:59.519> it<00:02:59.790> on<00:03:00.030> two<00:03:00.299> and<00:03:00.510> a

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
so I will be putting it on two and a

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:14.960 
so I will be putting it on two and a
half<00:03:05.209> and<00:03:07.910> close<00:03:08.910> it<00:03:09.239> down<00:03:10.130> and<00:03:11.130> start<00:03:13.970> and

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
half and close it down and start and

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:16.850 
half and close it down and start and
there<00:03:15.180> it<00:03:15.330> goes<00:03:15.360> immediately<00:03:15.900> it'll<00:03:16.530> start

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
there it goes immediately it'll start

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.250 
there it goes immediately it'll start
doing<00:03:17.220> that<00:03:17.400> and<00:03:17.790> I'll<00:03:18.420> catch<00:03:18.630> up<00:03:18.690> with<00:03:18.900> you

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
doing that and I'll catch up with you

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.240 
doing that and I'll catch up with you
once<00:03:19.470> it's<00:03:19.680> done<00:03:20.900> so<00:03:21.900> this<00:03:22.470> is<00:03:22.530> actually<00:03:23.100> more

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
once it's done so this is actually more

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.300 
once it's done so this is actually more
like<00:03:23.519> it's<00:03:24.030> not<00:03:24.150> a<00:03:24.209> dough<00:03:24.600> it's<00:03:25.079> more<00:03:25.260> likely

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
like it's not a dough it's more likely

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.940 
like it's not a dough it's more likely
we'll<00:03:26.880> see<00:03:27.090> how<00:03:27.300> it<00:03:27.450> turns<00:03:27.660> out<00:03:28.290> as<00:03:28.590> I<00:03:28.740> said

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
we'll see how it turns out as I said

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:30.680 
we'll see how it turns out as I said
I've<00:03:29.100> never<00:03:29.310> done<00:03:29.580> this<00:03:29.730> before<00:03:29.790> so<00:03:30.150> we<00:03:30.510> shall

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
I've never done this before so we shall

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:36.830 
I've never done this before so we shall
see<00:03:32.630> so<00:03:33.630> here<00:03:34.110> we<00:03:34.230> go<00:03:34.470> I<00:03:35.210> hope<00:03:36.210> you<00:03:36.360> can<00:03:36.600> see

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840

observations<00:04:02.820> number<00:04:03.209> one<00:04:03.330> I<00:04:03.480> would<00:04:03.690> double

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.320 
observations number one I would double

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:08.030 
observations number one I would double
the<00:04:04.500> recipe<00:04:05.150> and<00:04:06.170> number<00:04:07.170> two<00:04:07.410> I<00:04:07.440> think<00:04:07.920> I

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
the recipe and number two I think I

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:13.300 
the recipe and number two I think I
would<00:04:08.250> do<00:04:08.520> this<00:04:08.850> one<00:04:09.209> on<00:04:09.510> a<00:04:09.959> light<00:04:10.440> crust

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:16.580 

haven't<00:04:14.310> tasted<00:04:14.489> it<00:04:14.790> yet<00:04:15.150> needed<00:04:15.780> wait<00:04:16.290> and

waiting<00:04:16.890> for<00:04:16.919> it<00:04:17.100> to<00:04:17.160> cool<00:04:17.430> down<00:04:17.489> and<00:04:18.060> we<00:04:18.090> will

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:18.540 
waiting for it to cool down and we will

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:22.430 
waiting for it to cool down and we will
