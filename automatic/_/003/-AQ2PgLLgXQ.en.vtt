it seems to work pretty well I know my
school<00:00:39.570> is<00:00:39.600> not<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:39.870> best<00:00:39.960> in<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.200> world

group of guys in another group come so

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.609 
group of guys in another group come so

and when I fell down there and I save
some<00:01:37.979> sort<00:01:38.159> of<00:01:38.189> memory<00:01:38.430> loss<00:01:38.549> which<00:01:38.880> I'm<00:01:39.030> sure

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
some sort of memory loss which I'm sure

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.060 
some sort of memory loss which I'm sure
maybe<00:01:39.390> one<00:01:39.630> or<00:01:39.750> two<00:01:39.780> people<00:01:40.079> have<00:01:40.409> but<00:01:40.680> not<00:01:40.829> me

you've seen on many videos I'm sure and

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.090 
you've seen on many videos I'm sure and
that's<00:02:45.900> probably<00:02:46.200> a<00:02:46.260> bit<00:02:46.380> of<00:02:46.470> a<00:02:46.530> waste<00:02:46.770> but<00:02:47.040> I

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
that's probably a bit of a waste but I

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.080 
that's probably a bit of a waste but I
just<00:02:47.220> want<00:02:47.400> to<00:02:47.520> get<00:02:47.610> through<00:02:47.670> this<00:02:47.790> quickly

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
since you get a time bonus and then I

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.700 
since you get a time bonus and then I
think<00:02:51.210> I<00:02:51.300> finish<00:02:51.600> this<00:02:51.630> in<00:02:51.960> I'm<00:02:52.470> not<00:02:52.650> sure

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
look at the end floor it it's pretty

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.890
