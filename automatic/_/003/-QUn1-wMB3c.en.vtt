again do you realize how you sound or

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:25.390 
again do you realize how you sound or
are<00:03:22.730> you<00:03:22.970> deaf<00:03:23.390> to<00:03:23.659> it<00:03:23.810> as<00:03:24.049> you<00:03:24.409> condemn<00:03:25.040> my

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
are you deaf to it as you condemn my

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.420 
are you deaf to it as you condemn my
actions<00:03:26.090> perhaps<00:03:27.049> you<00:03:27.260> should<00:03:27.500> ask<00:03:27.709> yourself

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 
actions perhaps you should ask yourself

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:39.500 
actions perhaps you should ask yourself
how<00:03:28.849> well<00:03:29.209> you<00:03:29.599> knew<00:03:29.989> her<00:03:30.280> really<00:03:31.280> knew<00:03:31.849> her

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.839 

indeed<00:03:40.650> because<00:03:41.650> from<00:03:42.010> all<00:03:42.220> that<00:03:42.400> I<00:03:42.459> have

00:03:42.839 --> 00:03:42.849 
indeed because from all that I have

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:45.030 
indeed because from all that I have
heard<00:03:43.090> you<00:03:43.300> are<00:03:43.510> constantly<00:03:44.170> placing<00:03:44.680> her<00:03:44.830> in

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
heard you are constantly placing her in

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.070 
heard you are constantly placing her in
danger<00:03:45.550> and<00:03:45.730> you<00:03:45.940> know<00:03:46.120> very<00:03:46.540> little<00:03:46.660> about

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:47.080 
danger and you know very little about

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:49.589 
danger and you know very little about
her<00:03:47.380> at<00:03:47.560> all<00:03:47.590> so<00:03:48.370> your<00:03:48.580> preaching<00:03:48.940> is<00:03:49.270> not<00:03:49.450> only

00:03:49.589 --> 00:03:49.599 
her at all so your preaching is not only

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:50.729 
her at all so your preaching is not only
irritating<00:03:50.410> me

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:50.739 
irritating me

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:54.089 
irritating me
it<00:03:51.370> is<00:03:51.640> a<00:03:51.690> hypocrisy<00:03:52.690> I<00:03:52.720> commonly<00:03:53.440> observed<00:03:53.590> in

00:03:54.089 --> 00:03:54.099 
it is a hypocrisy I commonly observed in

00:03:54.099 --> 00:04:02.630 
it is a hypocrisy I commonly observed in
the<00:03:54.190> Neverwinter<00:03:55.000> nobility<00:03:55.989> captain

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:07.290 

very<00:04:03.640> well<00:04:03.970> I<00:04:04.239> am<00:04:04.480> listening<00:04:04.810> that<00:04:06.000> that<00:04:07.000> was<00:04:07.269> a

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:07.300 
very well I am listening that that was a

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:09.870 
very well I am listening that that was a
great<00:04:07.660> deal<00:04:07.900> more<00:04:07.959> than<00:04:08.349> I<00:04:08.739> thought<00:04:09.130> she<00:04:09.670> could

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:09.880 
great deal more than I thought she could

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:11.910 
great deal more than I thought she could
have<00:04:10.030> remained<00:04:10.390> here<00:04:10.810> and<00:04:10.989> been<00:04:11.140> safe<00:04:11.500> but<00:04:11.769> yet

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:11.920 
have remained here and been safe but yet

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:22.920 
have remained here and been safe but yet
she<00:04:12.130> followed<00:04:12.580> you<00:04:12.940> why<00:04:21.150> still<00:04:22.150> despite<00:04:22.750> what

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930 
she followed you why still despite what

you<00:04:23.050> have<00:04:23.229> said<00:04:23.470> she<00:04:24.040> is<00:04:24.160> still<00:04:24.430> the<00:04:24.610> reason

00:04:24.719 --> 00:04:24.729 
you have said she is still the reason

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:27.120 
you have said she is still the reason
why<00:04:25.030> I<00:04:25.060> have<00:04:25.419> to<00:04:25.600> fight<00:04:25.810> this<00:04:25.990> war<00:04:26.290> because<00:04:26.860> no

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
why I have to fight this war because no

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:28.890 
why I have to fight this war because no
one<00:04:27.310> else<00:04:27.520> has<00:04:27.760> the<00:04:27.940> strength<00:04:28.240> to<00:04:28.360> do<00:04:28.630> it

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:28.900 
one else has the strength to do it

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:30.629 
one else has the strength to do it
or<00:04:29.050> is<00:04:29.200> willing<00:04:29.410> to<00:04:29.590> make<00:04:29.800> the<00:04:29.950> choices<00:04:30.250> that<00:04:30.490> I

can

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:39.190 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:42.810 

I<00:04:39.280> did<00:04:40.030> what<00:04:40.180> I<00:04:40.300> had<00:04:40.330> to<00:04:40.810> do<00:04:41.020> always<00:04:41.760> they<00:04:42.760> were

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:45.480 
I did what I had to do always they were
hard<00:04:43.300> decisions<00:04:44.110> but<00:04:44.740> they<00:04:44.830> had<00:04:45.040> to<00:04:45.160> be<00:04:45.280> made

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:45.490 
hard decisions but they had to be made

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:47.910 
hard decisions but they had to be made
by<00:04:45.670> someone<00:04:46.060> and<00:04:46.810> if<00:04:46.930> no<00:04:47.110> one<00:04:47.290> would<00:04:47.440> do<00:04:47.620> it<00:04:47.740> I

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:47.920 
by someone and if no one would do it I

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:50.730 
by someone and if no one would do it I
would<00:04:48.250> and<00:04:48.850> before<00:04:49.360> you<00:04:49.570> judge<00:04:50.020> me<00:04:50.050> for<00:04:50.500> my
