00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:25.400
 Then people are welcome back to 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:28.460
 pokémon tcg tutorial series or the 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:31.369
 pokémon trading kagame and finally has 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:34.430
 houses and energy different from the types 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:35.360
 of pokémon agreed energies that exist 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.690
 is different 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.790
 they are grass fire water there the psycho 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.040
 fight darkness and metal 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:45.020
 already the types of pokémon still have more 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.800
 two daughters dragon and without co as well as 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.899
 I already told you 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.899
 but the guys energy them as they already 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:53.600
 I told you I could use some attack 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:55.609
 of the Pokémon or to do some action 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.339
 a Katrina pain will depend a lot on the 

00:00:55.609 --> 00:01:02.480
 played in full you can only use one 

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:05.239
 letter of energy for everything in a Pokemon 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:08.330
 ie are three Pokémon in the bank and a 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:10.940
 active I can only equip one flesh 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:13.400
 energy and any pokémon outside this 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:16.460
 so neither can I do more 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:18.950
 unless an effect of a pokémon the 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.990
 effect of a coach card do with 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.420
 that I can equate more than one letter 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.259
 per shift and to be able to match the 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.780
 energy 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:30.380
 just put it through my 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:32.149
 very simple pokémon and the law of skate 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.450
 energy I've already told of these guys 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:37.399
 there is also special energy letter I 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.490
 I will not be able to speak of all now nor 

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:43.340
 I want to talk, I'll just make a video. 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.750
 about it so do not worry about it 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.829
 I will talk about energy in the future. 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.469
 special 

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:51.649
 so that's it and think it was the tutorial 

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:54.079
 about types of letters of course I had 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:56.420
 which divide in three steps by explaining 

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:58.310
 about each one because it really is a 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.950
 very time consuming to explain 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:03.770
 and it may not be small this video 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:06.380
 here the last of the three on types of 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:09.229
 letters or should each have 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:11.930
 Pokémon can stay in the houses of 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:14.750
 beaches and that is the prize cards you 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:17.810
 you can see here on the bank screen and 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:20.510
 active pokémon the coaching cards you 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.909
 next to the right of the letter 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:25.610
 active and after using the effect of it you 

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:26.420
 discards her discard pile plus one 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.030
 katana 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:31.220
 can also be located on the battery and 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.920
 premiums because we do not know which 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:36.170
 type of letter is that of fraternity and 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:39.110
 lastly the energy houses are 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:41.630
 located behind the pokémons or 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:44.480
 she can stand naked behind the active pokémon 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:46.489
 behind the pokémons of the bank or in the 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:49.220
 pile of prizes where you can pull 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:51.560
 levers to a special power in the 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:55.010
 part of the prizes and of course after a 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:56.720
 Dying Pokémon their energies will also 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.700
 along with a saucer pokémon says 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.620
 So, you have to take your car very well. 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.720
 strategy so you do not put too much 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.420
 necessary energies for only one 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.970
 pokémon not to lose all of them 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:11.930
 so this is the one that was the fourth tori 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.560
 how to play the pokémon tcg then it is 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.930
 that 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.880
 I liked the second video and of course 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.319
 be able to follow this series further if 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:20.930
 please enter the channel if you are not 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:25.840
 So that's it, I'll see you in the 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:25.840
 Next video until next spoke
