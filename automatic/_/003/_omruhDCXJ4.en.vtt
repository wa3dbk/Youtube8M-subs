it<00:00:57.559> on<00:00:57.680> it's<00:00:58.720> surprisingly<00:00:59.720> a<00:00:59.809> lot<00:01:00.019> easier<00:01:00.439> on

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710 
it on it's surprisingly a lot easier on

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.899 
it on it's surprisingly a lot easier on
steeper<00:01:01.670> things<00:01:01.909> and<00:01:02.409> vert<00:01:03.549> mainly<00:01:04.549> because

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:04.909 
steeper things and vert mainly because

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:07.660 
steeper things and vert mainly because
you're<00:01:05.150> doing<00:01:05.330> a<00:01:05.390> Smith<00:01:05.630> grind<00:01:05.659> so<00:01:06.400> your<00:01:07.400> truck
