00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:04.890
 hi guys and welcome back with a 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:06.960
 brand new video today we are on a game 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.599
 really very nice called 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.820
 whistle that will allow us to create the 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.040
 our cardboard so today we will try to 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.470
 transform myself into a cardboard 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.730
 animated let's see what comes up like 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.830
 always invite you to leave a nice one 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:23.640
 thumb up and start right away 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:27.660
 then perfect we start then that is the 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.840
 your personal cartoon boy or 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:35.100
 girl since I have to do the same 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:37.230
 I would put boyfriend then good now 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.649
 we have to set the haircut 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:43.559
 today as they went to cut then 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:46.129
 these would avoid them it seems that 60 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:49.219
 years otherwise these are mines and bombs 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:52.310
 not too many reality is yes perhaps 

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:54.980
 they could go 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:57.380
 but let me see that it shields him 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:00.100
 the camera here not so I have to 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.100
 to compare 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:05.780
 we keep them could use these are 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.500
 even better here I know these are these 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.160
 reality 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:12.620
 yes i would say i am these perfect there 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.850
 are the hair cabbages there are that there 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.590
 is for all types 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.810
 then where is the gold color where is the 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.910
 gold color that is the golden jump the fee 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.070
 it is called precisely because golden color 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:24.410
 gold so let's put this hair 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:27.619
 this is what I would say most gold color 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:31.310
 this or this or not this is a brown 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:34.910
 ok perfect but let's see how much now 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:36.770
 we must set the face as good as 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:38.360
 cabbage only facade to do a thing 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:44.240
 silhouette 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:48.080
 then perfect let's see here is here 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:49.130
 here is maybe we are approaching 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.900
 this a little better 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:55.910
 I guess I know this miss to this one 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:58.280
 perfect this point from the color of the 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:00.259
 skin and since I am quite white 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:06.110
 put this no this is too it seems 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:09.619
 like a ghost so I maybe in ray 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:11.990
 this yes yes yes yes reality the camera 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.520
 that is the white yellow of mine then this 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:15.260
 camera makes me even more white 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:21.230
 so I could disappear for a moment 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:24.860
 to the other ok apart from these crap 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:28.460
 then we choose the eyelashes well the eyelashes 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:30.620
 quite huge 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:32.540
 so no these are bad kind 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.480
 seems to mean that I kill that 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:39.640
 sky ok touches set these no 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:42.319
 these goodbye 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.450
 oh well i set this up is perfect 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:46.870
 clouds that come closer to us 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:50.500
 perfect eyes 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:53.170
 oh god that sucks no because then a 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:57.280
 I like these but it's not like there 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:03:01.019
 have opened so I have to find 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:04.870
 something eyes a little tighter and 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:06.430
 small ok I put in more remains 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:10.450
 because they are typical 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:11.829
 then I also have these are you 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:15.250
 these do not even serve what I see 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:20.019
 others because they are these secrets always 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:23.470
 ok the mouth i put this ok is not that 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:23.859
 the mouth of the low milcios for this 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:29.790
 stuff 

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:33.430
 no this is evil this year 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:36.159
 would get something happy ok me 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:39.459
 I would say that this can go even if a 

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:42.459
 little malandrina how to say perfect then 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:43.629
 let's see what we find nasso this is the 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:48.010
 my favourite 

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:51.370
 ok so maybe this is what I would say 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:53.410
 just opt ​​for this yes ok facts 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:55.720
 at the moment there is none or mine 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:58.690
 mustaches are on the mouth then made 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:00.970
 fantastic students also a goatee 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:04.510
 oh well bhatti I'd say skip them because 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:07.389
 I don't have any glasses, usually not 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:09.099
 I wear them so we may not wear them 

00:04:07.389 --> 00:04:12.790
 reality 

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:16.510
 so no I want these ok it seems 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:18.789
 like a crazy perfect t-shirt 3 a 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:21.549
 nice shirt no this kind did 

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:24.820
 Too much of a gangster was a super hero 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:26.979
 this from archer is this from spiderman 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:29.530
 but let's see if there's a shirt from 

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:31.440
 this ball was waived this golden 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:35.170
 from batman 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:37.900
 this to give okaro of show 

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:39.940
 there is that of batman that is the situation of 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:43.660
 spider man iron man 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:46.810
 what is this from hulk ninja to no io 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:50.100
 I say that we have captain america 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:55.030
 naruto even this dell'akatsuki 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:57.970
 no dragon ball that is, it puts me too much 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:05:00.790
 a choice too difficult though hyok 3 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:06.000
 or for this that is spectacular spider 

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:09.340
 man I do not know at this point I would put 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.560
 Captain America I like it too perfect 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:13.450
 then I also like others 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:15.540
 practically everyone but I like this one 

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:18.220
 more like my character 

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:21.460
 chaplain really would say no what 

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:25.510
 we have a nun thing about this color 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:28.060
 of one spectacular piece that is this one 

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:30.610
 operation is full of devil accounts if 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:32.350
 I'm okay, let's take this as a pirate, not 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:33.880
 it is to be targeted, however, that what 

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:39.370
 then we attach everything else 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:42.160
 will remain a sponge yes no spectacular 

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:45.570
 because of the money in hand since long 

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:47.620
 roma no this is too bad here 

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:53.340
 I like this 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:59.050
 I would say to leave that is this 

00:05:53.340 --> 00:06:02.470
 is holding but a fantastic 

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:07.000
 yes all vegetables of all kinds on 

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:09.880
 boxing gloves a plunger is ok 

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:14.260
 here we can also choose it 

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:16.419
 background we put something beautiful but 

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:17.500
 looks like it looks like there's an earring either 

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:19.630
 conceals the earring 

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:21.760
 no because I love you an earring I have to 

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:25.480
 take power away such a thing 

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:28.150
 it's perfect so we totally modify it 

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:30.340
 so the face is not convenient to put 

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:35.080
 these things 

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:39.400
 oh well these are the ni comics protections 

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:42.990
 we are not interested in them or that they are 

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:48.720
 already preset perfect face 

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:51.580
 save it and save it also in the photos 

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:54.700
 perfect here is the final result 3 that 

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:59.500
 little came to me well enough 

00:06:54.700 --> 00:07:03.610
 looks like from the ok not a lot but a 

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:05.380
 very well from there we can stay and da 

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:07.270
 what I thought was an earring in 

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:09.729
 actually it was not an earring was 

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:12.039
 simply the glow I had 

00:07:09.729 --> 00:07:14.950
 set first though but it also seems 

00:07:12.039 --> 00:07:15.310
 an earring then two birds with one 

00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:18.580
 broad bean 

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:20.020
 as they say perfect guys 

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:21.910
 so I would say that for this video he can 

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:23.680

00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:25.720
