00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:38.960 
knowing how the spawns are going to be

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.870 
knowing how the spawns are going to be
changed<00:00:39.440> based<00:00:39.680> on<00:00:39.920> where<00:00:40.160> you<00:00:40.340> are<00:00:40.550> in<00:00:40.580> where

the<00:00:42.590> map<00:00:42.740> slum<00:00:43.010> is<00:00:43.220> tricky<00:00:43.610> is<00:00:43.760> because<00:00:44.180> if<00:00:44.330> you

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:44.450 
the map slum is tricky is because if you

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:45.910 
the map slum is tricky is because if you
kill<00:00:44.660> them<00:00:44.810> so<00:00:45.050> many<00:00:45.140> times<00:00:45.290> in<00:00:45.680> a<00:00:45.740> certain

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:45.920 
kill them so many times in a certain

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.070 
kill them so many times in a certain
area<00:00:46.190> they<00:00:46.820> will<00:00:47.000> spawn<00:00:47.330> on<00:00:47.600> the<00:00:47.690> other<00:00:47.840> side

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:48.080 
area they will spawn on the other side

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:49.780 
area they will spawn on the other side
of<00:00:48.110> the<00:00:48.290> map<00:00:48.470> that's<00:00:48.650> what<00:00:48.890> these<00:00:49.100> two<00:00:49.370> red

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:49.790 
of the map that's what these two red

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:51.520 
of the map that's what these two red
boxes<00:00:50.300> are<00:00:50.420> for<00:00:50.600> but<00:00:50.900> there<00:00:51.050> is<00:00:51.200> a<00:00:51.230> way<00:00:51.380> to

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:51.530 
boxes are for but there is a way to

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.590 
boxes are for but there is a way to
prevent<00:00:52.220> this<00:00:52.400> and<00:00:52.670> still<00:00:52.910> be<00:00:53.030> able<00:00:53.120> to<00:00:53.270> stay

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 
prevent this and still be able to stay

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.330 
prevent this and still be able to stay
in<00:00:53.630> the<00:00:53.780> same<00:00:53.930> spot<00:00:54.140> if<00:00:54.620> you<00:00:54.860> throw<00:00:55.040> a<00:00:55.070> little

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:55.340 
in the same spot if you throw a little

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.160 
in the same spot if you throw a little
equipment<00:00:55.760> down<00:00:56.120> such<00:00:56.480> as<00:00:56.600> a<00:00:56.630> bouncing<00:00:57.050> betty

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170 
equipment down such as a bouncing betty

equipment down such as a bouncing betty
or<00:00:57.410> claim<00:00:57.650> or<00:00:57.890> the<00:00:58.070> enemy<00:00:58.400> will<00:00:58.640> not<00:00:58.850> spawn

00:00:59.230 --> 00:00:59.240 
or claim or the enemy will not spawn

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:00.880 
or claim or the enemy will not spawn
there<00:00:59.510> and<00:00:59.690> they<00:00:59.810> will<00:00:59.960> stay<00:01:00.140> spawning<00:01:00.530> back

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:00.890 
there and they will stay spawning back

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:02.830 
there and they will stay spawning back
at<00:01:01.070> a<00:01:01.160> flat<00:01:01.460> these<00:01:01.700> two<00:01:01.880> things<00:01:02.090> are<00:01:02.270> extremely

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:02.840 
at a flat these two things are extremely

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.450 
at a flat these two things are extremely
crucial<00:01:03.020> to<00:01:03.290> the<00:01:03.380> spawn<00:01:03.590> trap<00:01:03.890> a<00:01:03.920> day<00:01:04.100> because

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 
crucial to the spawn trap a day because

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:05.950 
crucial to the spawn trap a day because
if<00:01:04.580> you<00:01:04.670> do<00:01:04.790> not<00:01:04.910> have<00:01:05.120> those<00:01:05.330> there<00:01:05.630> they<00:01:05.840> will

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960 
if you do not have those there they will

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.810 
if you do not have those there they will
obviously<00:01:06.230> have<00:01:06.530> an<00:01:06.650> easy<00:01:06.830> path<00:01:07.130> way<00:01:07.370> to<00:01:07.430> two

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:07.820 
obviously have an easy path way to two

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.580 
obviously have an easy path way to two
flags<00:01:08.120> and<00:01:08.570> next<00:01:08.780> thing<00:01:08.900> you<00:01:08.960> know<00:01:09.080> you<00:01:09.290> may<00:01:09.530> be

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
everybody can lay tactical insertions on

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.640 
everybody can lay tactical insertions on
the<00:02:33.180> other<00:02:33.300> side<00:02:33.570> near<00:02:33.780> the<00:02:33.810> B<00:02:34.050> flag<00:02:34.290> and<00:02:34.530> this

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
the other side near the B flag and this

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.050 
the other side near the B flag and this
will<00:02:34.800> allow<00:02:35.040> them<00:02:35.220> to<00:02:35.370> hold<00:02:35.550> the<00:02:35.640> spawn<00:02:35.850> trap

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
will allow them to hold the spawn trap

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.640 
will allow them to hold the spawn trap
even<00:02:36.270> longer<00:02:36.630> the<00:02:36.900> sixth<00:02:37.200> and<00:02:37.290> final<00:02:37.410> guys

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
even longer the sixth and final guys

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:38.690 
even longer the sixth and final guys
should<00:02:37.830> be<00:02:37.920> at<00:02:38.010> the<00:02:38.130> fountain<00:02:38.430> the<00:02:38.490> best

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
should be at the fountain the best

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:39.980 
should be at the fountain the best
weapon<00:02:39.060> of<00:02:39.150> choice<00:02:39.180> for<00:02:39.540> this<00:02:39.660> guy<00:02:39.840> would

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
weapon of choice for this guy would

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:41.750 
weapon of choice for this guy would
probably<00:02:40.290> be<00:02:40.410> a<00:02:40.440> sniper<00:02:40.740> rifle<00:02:40.860> in<00:02:41.280> this<00:02:41.520> body

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760
