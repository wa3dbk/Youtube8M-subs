00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.899
 but now we are with you this one 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:09.300
 we will make the whole block as a separate link 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.700
 Well, it's generally made easier 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:15.030
 simple what we do we just do it ourselves 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:18.630
 unit sofa he turn into a simple ordinary 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:21.449
 the link immediately says that before this 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:24.029
 it was impossible to do that is links not 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:27.300
 block elements could be placed there 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.400
 more than one element validator at once 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.170
 swore at such a site it was very 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.570
 badly 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:36.750
 however now in html fifth it is allowed 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.850
 and the code will be correct and so let's we 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.870
 keep a look at what we have 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:45.149
 it turned out so we update see that 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.980
 we had a reference everything became a link 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.660
 only now this text is with us 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.140
 looks wrong 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.780
 see yes therefore let's start changing 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.449
 and so we see what is waiting for us div block 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:02.370
 then there is a reference so let's us 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:07.310
 here it is now copy so here goes 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:10.409
 reference and here we will post 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:15.420
 the following reference ip 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:18.630
 and here we will write the text color text 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.950
 pound text color pro 100 color per 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.400
 thought text 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:29.430
 equals lattice 27 27 27 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:31.950
 ; keep updating look cheeks 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.229
 see from back to its place perfectly 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.100
 and now let's do that when 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.659
 hover 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:42.150
 our blog he changed his color so therefore 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:45.930
 here the principle of the link and the block announcement is not 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:49.700
 match exactly in size let's 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:56.270
 do the following so sofa wasps 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:02:01.200
 write: hover so minute 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:09.530
 and here we write the next background so 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:13.960
 lattice e0 ะต.ั. f4. prepare and 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:22.030
 border let's get one pixel 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:28.580
 solid and here we put the grill b fd5 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:29.660
 dd ; keep updating and look 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.600
 on hover 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:36.850
 we see the block is changing perfectly 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.850
 did an interactive blog
