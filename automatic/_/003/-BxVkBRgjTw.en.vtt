a viewer on dermtv this week asked an

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:12.930 
a viewer on dermtv this week asked an
important<00:00:11.140> question<00:00:11.350> is<00:00:11.830> it<00:00:12.400> safe<00:00:12.610> to<00:00:12.820> use

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:12.940 
important question is it safe to use

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:15.660 
important question is it safe to use
exfoliants<00:00:13.660> on<00:00:13.780> your<00:00:13.900> face<00:00:14.139> if<00:00:14.469> your<00:00:15.250> broken

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:15.670 
exfoliants on your face if your broken

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:18.269 
exfoliants on your face if your broken
capillaries<00:00:16.240> and<00:00:16.510> the<00:00:17.080> answer<00:00:17.410> is<00:00:17.560> with<00:00:18.070> one

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:18.279 
capillaries and the answer is with one

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:21.480 
capillaries and the answer is with one
exception<00:00:18.430> yes<00:00:19.330> it<00:00:19.510> is<00:00:19.630> safe<00:00:19.980> so<00:00:20.980> if<00:00:21.279> you're

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:21.490 
exception yes it is safe so if you're

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:23.550 
exception yes it is safe so if you're
using<00:00:21.640> gentle<00:00:22.180> chemical<00:00:22.869> exfoliants<00:00:23.529> like

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:23.560 
using gentle chemical exfoliants like

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.180 
using gentle chemical exfoliants like
glycolic<00:00:23.710> or<00:00:24.460> salicylic<00:00:25.119> that's<00:00:25.990> fine<00:00:26.289> and<00:00:26.590> if

glycolic or salicylic that's fine and if
you're<00:00:27.310> doing<00:00:27.520> gentle<00:00:27.940> physical<00:00:28.600> exfoliation

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:29.050 
you're doing gentle physical exfoliation

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.470 
you're doing gentle physical exfoliation
like<00:00:29.550> microdermabrasion<00:00:30.550> or<00:00:30.939> even<00:00:31.240> shaving

that<00:00:32.140> won't<00:00:32.410> break<00:00:32.590> capillaries<00:00:33.250> but<00:00:33.790> the<00:00:33.910> one

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:34.090 
that won't break capillaries but the one

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:36.630 
that won't break capillaries but the one
exception<00:00:34.600> is<00:00:34.750> retinoids<00:00:35.559> now<00:00:36.460> usually

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:36.640

diagram this is the epidermis and this

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:13.279 
diagram this is the epidermis and this
is<00:01:10.840> where<00:01:11.080> your<00:01:11.650> chemical<00:01:12.399> exfoliants<00:01:13.060> work

00:01:13.279 --> 00:01:13.289 
is where your chemical exfoliants work

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:16.230 
is where your chemical exfoliants work
also<00:01:14.289> where<00:01:14.439> physical<00:01:14.890> exfoliants<00:01:15.520> work<00:01:15.670> they

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
also where physical exfoliants work they

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.289 
also where physical exfoliants work they
take<00:01:16.509> away<00:01:16.659> this<00:01:17.380> layer<00:01:17.649> of<00:01:17.890> dead<00:01:18.070> cells

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
take away this layer of dead cells

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.330 
take away this layer of dead cells
however<00:01:19.299> the<00:01:19.780> broken<00:01:20.140> capillaries<00:01:20.740> are<00:01:20.920> down

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.340 
however the broken capillaries are down

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.190 
however the broken capillaries are down
here<00:01:21.670> in<00:01:21.789> the<00:01:21.880> second<00:01:22.270> layer<00:01:22.420> in<00:01:22.630> the<00:01:22.840> dermis

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 
here in the second layer in the dermis

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.249 
here in the second layer in the dermis
and<00:01:23.350> it's<00:01:23.439> these<00:01:23.619> blue<00:01:23.890> lines<00:01:24.159> and<00:01:24.490> red<00:01:24.759> lines

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
and it's these blue lines and red lines

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.899 
and it's these blue lines and red lines
well<00:01:26.259> the<00:01:26.979> dead<00:01:27.159> cells<00:01:27.460> that<00:01:27.579> are<00:01:27.759> being

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:27.909 
well the dead cells that are being

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:30.959 
well the dead cells that are being
removed<00:01:28.240> by<00:01:28.570> exfoliation<00:01:29.500> are<00:01:29.649> opaque<00:01:30.310> they

00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:30.969 
removed by exfoliation are opaque they

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:33.359 
removed by exfoliation are opaque they
sort<00:01:31.240> of<00:01:31.299> obscure<00:01:31.929> the<00:01:32.409> appearance<00:01:32.859> of<00:01:33.009> what's

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:33.369 
sort of obscure the appearance of what's

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:35.849 
sort of obscure the appearance of what's
below<00:01:33.729> it<00:01:33.759> if<00:01:34.390> you<00:01:34.929> take<00:01:35.140> these<00:01:35.320> dead<00:01:35.590> cells

00:01:35.849 --> 00:01:35.859 
below it if you take these dead cells

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:38.069 
below it if you take these dead cells
away<00:01:36.159> it's<00:01:36.789> a<00:01:36.969> little<00:01:37.210> bit<00:01:37.329> like<00:01:37.479> dusting<00:01:37.929> off

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:38.079 
away it's a little bit like dusting off

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:40.529 
away it's a little bit like dusting off
of<00:01:38.259> painting<00:01:38.679> it<00:01:39.100> reveals<00:01:39.490> all<00:01:39.909> the<00:01:39.939> details

00:01:40.529 --> 00:01:40.539 
of painting it reveals all the details

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:44.099 
of painting it reveals all the details
below<00:01:40.950> so<00:01:41.950> if<00:01:42.280> you<00:01:42.520> regularly<00:01:43.090> exfoliate<00:01:43.840> and

00:01:44.099 --> 00:01:44.109 
below so if you regularly exfoliate and

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:46.469 
below so if you regularly exfoliate and
get<00:01:44.619> rid<00:01:44.799> of<00:01:44.829> this<00:01:45.009> opaque<00:01:45.549> layer<00:01:45.789> up<00:01:46.060> here

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:46.479 
get rid of this opaque layer up here

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:48.090 
get rid of this opaque layer up here
you're<00:01:46.990> really<00:01:47.259> going<00:01:47.380> to<00:01:47.439> be<00:01:47.530> able<00:01:47.679> to<00:01:47.920> see

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
you're really going to be able to see

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.310 
you're really going to be able to see
into<00:01:48.670> the<00:01:48.789> skin<00:01:49.060> better<00:01:49.299> and<00:01:49.570> therefore

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.320 
into the skin better and therefore

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.830 
into the skin better and therefore
anything<00:01:50.590> below<00:01:51.340> the<00:01:51.549> surface<00:01:51.759> like<00:01:52.659> the

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
anything below the surface like the

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.719 
anything below the surface like the
capillaries<00:01:53.409> that<00:01:53.439> are<00:01:53.590> broken<00:01:53.920> and<00:01:54.249> enlarged

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:54.729 
capillaries that are broken and enlarged

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:56.370 
capillaries that are broken and enlarged
are<00:01:55.179> going<00:01:55.390> to<00:01:55.479> be<00:01:55.539> more<00:01:55.719> apparent

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
are going to be more apparent

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.609 
are going to be more apparent
so<00:01:57.219> while<00:01:57.749> exfoliation<00:01:58.749> by<00:01:59.289> and<00:01:59.499> large

00:01:59.609 --> 00:01:59.619 
so while exfoliation by and large

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:01.410 
so while exfoliation by and large
doesn't<00:02:00.369> increase<00:02:00.759> the<00:02:00.939> number<00:02:01.179> of<00:02:01.210> broken

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
doesn't increase the number of broken

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.020 
doesn't increase the number of broken
capillaries<00:02:02.109> you<00:02:02.259> have<00:02:02.439> it<00:02:02.710> can<00:02:03.340> make<00:02:03.850> the

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
capillaries you have it can make the

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.289 
capillaries you have it can make the
ones<00:02:04.210> you<00:02:04.359> have<00:02:04.389> more<00:02:05.289> apparent<00:02:06.179> usually<00:02:07.179> it

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:07.299 
ones you have more apparent usually it

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:10.260 
ones you have more apparent usually it
