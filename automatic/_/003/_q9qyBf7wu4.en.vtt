00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:10.210
 next we will scratch the ending yes 

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:12.190
 d here is hot for the weather and even that 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:14.160
 makes the pan heated to 400 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.260
 degrees with granite volga laminate 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.960
 quartz son flying out blowtorch 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.140
 heated to one and a half thousand degrees and 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:22.120
 palm trees do not calm down until we find out what 

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:23.740
 temperature is able to withstand the boundary 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:25.619
 poorly known as granite block of ice 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.820
 dropping on the slabs caused in that 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.820
 find out we will go to the factory 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.110
 fans of boundaries therefore conical rocks 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.210
 Prime especially than already boundaries so popular 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.660
 now as kitchen countertops with 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.190
 another facet and durable material on 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:59.630
 can it be made to him 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:01.360
 can become hot tubs cool 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.920
 looks took all the tests to make sure 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.420
 what wonderful qualities there are and 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:06.910
 granite let's do some 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:08.010
 attempts at others 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.720
 we compare the limits of artificial stone 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.990
 compositions laminate start let's start with 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:13.040
 that one saratov 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.710
 In addition, I would not recommend doing 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:16.360
 it is with one positive true 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.740
 capitals but we have an experiment so 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:19.760
 I want to save 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:21.670
 and that's what will happen 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.590
 according to p and h i will scratch 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.620
 each sample from the beginning with a sharp knife 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:28.020
 davide santon metal 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.850
 washcloth at night to see how much 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.840
 damage they will inflict on him 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.570
 scratched from the knife but generally he 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.270
 adequately withd with metal 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.290
 washcloth 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.380
 the hall is however positive in this case 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.050
 realities are still definitely left 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.800
 scratch marks 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.630
 clear as for artificial stone 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.190
 according to him is a binder escalation 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.590
 with resin I don't see any scratches 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.870
 and after all such granite and probably I can Italy 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:55.010
 for eternity he would have nothing this 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:56.750
 artificial stone tiger thread won 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.750
 victories in this test 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.090
 from 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.640
 midfielder go under arrest for 40 other test 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.390
 will inherit from hot if we 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:07.880
 just look at the surface 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.729
 will react to high temperatures 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.419
 here i have a skillet which 

00:02:11.419 --> 00:02:13.309
 stuffed forgot to shake degrees right 

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:15.349
 I will set to lure the surface smooth 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:17.340
 portfolio and 40 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.069
 tactics consider what is burning hot 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:22.069
 the pan will make us seeds 

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:25.370
 when the funds remain reported so 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.209
 scary now square composer 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:29.249
 the deficit has not changed the pattern on black what 

00:02:29.249 --> 00:02:31.679
 we saw the result 

00:02:31.679 --> 00:02:33.090
 is it enough yes 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.940
 definitely stayed for that purpose now 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.400
 you can see plates from Moldova 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.790
 we continue on I would be glad 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.189
 artificial stone where boundaries 

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:43.180
 without them they must be very stable 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.680
 Yerevan cast now temperature 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.790
 about 420 and degree information 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.180
 artificial stone is usually 95 percent 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.540
 consists of quartz and a binder resin 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.430
 from March of strong plastic 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:54.939
 but melt years 

00:02:54.939 --> 00:02:57.309
 naivety club not a speck project 

00:02:57.309 --> 00:03:00.309
 smooth move UAH however 

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:03.799
 no, everything is cool, no 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:06.559
 thermal conductivity 

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:08.749
 he wins again 

00:03:08.749 --> 00:03:10.609
 their activities hot pan not 

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:11.999
 left a mark on the border where 

00:03:11.999 --> 00:03:14.499
 artificial stone without hesitation can 

00:03:14.499 --> 00:03:17.109
 to increase 

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:19.009
 knew the temperature of the gas flame 

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:21.019
 a blowtorch over a thousand six hundred 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:23.679
 degrees 

00:03:23.679 --> 00:03:24.859
 in July 

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:26.759
 last yes we already knew that he 

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:29.619
 inadvertently rositski roast collapse 

00:03:29.619 --> 00:03:31.269
 let's get artificial stone 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:33.999
 on the contrary do not forget that in this cell with 

00:03:33.999 --> 00:03:36.049
 by adding pitch stavropol you saw 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:37.799
 what happened composer this 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:39.419
 feel the heat too 

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:41.879
 release in a little discoloration but he 

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:43.499
 did a fine love now 

00:03:43.499 --> 00:03:45.249
 proceed to the natural map 

00:03:45.249 --> 00:03:47.849
 makes no trace of any remains 

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:49.609
 the question of shortage how much can bear 

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:51.479
 the border is time to arrange and 

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:52.760
 final composition 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.009
 we will go to the extreme sternik 

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:57.179
 then he released several 

00:03:57.179 --> 00:03:59.389
 pyrotechnic mixture of time with 

00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:01.389
 iron oxide or the markets of what effects 

00:04:01.389 --> 00:04:03.379
 x he would be our cool team 

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:04.809
 preparing the mixture in the pot to 

00:04:04.809 --> 00:04:06.629
 put it on a granite slab doctor 

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:08.559
 you don't want to deal with this thing 

00:04:08.559 --> 00:04:10.739
 At home, the cinema may heat up. 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:12.849
 up to two and a half thousand degrees 

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:13.949
 Uzbektourism 

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:15.969
 but also in different regions the market 

00:04:15.969 --> 00:04:19.019
 May was good worthy 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:21.099
 ideally which we have a termite boundary 

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:22.400
 May Savings Bank 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.400
 it'll be cool 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:42.389
 five look like it happened 

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:44.389
 volcanic eruption right on this boundaries 

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:45.840
 rf placed flowers 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.270
 June gene 2 3 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:50.270
 prosecutors gave early 

00:04:53.779 --> 00:04:55.699
 as er wrote 

00:04:55.699 --> 00:04:57.779
 This tape when returned in the middle 

00:04:57.779 --> 00:04:58.809
 of this 

00:04:58.809 --> 00:05:01.169
 we can win this milk here 

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:04.169
 roam centers 

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:09.240
 I don't have 2 cop left on my stone 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:10.800
 stage two don't worry about 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.720
 border in your kitchen and if only you 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.889
 do not solve the thermite devices 

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:17.729
 now i'm honestly red wine 

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:19.490
 can lead the border more harm 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:21.419
 than red-hot frying pan 

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:22.740
 or technology and communication 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:24.699
 immediately wipe the main thing in Asia 

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:26.160
 second day always use all 

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.160
 together 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:32.259
 plane further or as cut one of 

00:05:32.259 --> 00:05:34.240
 the strongest stones we will suffer the earth 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:36.360
 trace his Putin's clowning tabletop 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:37.650
 if we see really 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:39.400
 the glass is broken easier the hard 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:40.150
 surface 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:41.570
 and what you need to develop 

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:43.110
 by myself
