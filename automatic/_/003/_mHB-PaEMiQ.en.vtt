00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
there you have a decent chance of

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.160 
there you have a decent chance of
getting<00:00:56.160> a<00:00:56.219> legendary<00:00:56.699> for<00:00:57.449> me<00:00:57.570> I've<00:00:57.840> noticed

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
getting a legendary for me I've noticed

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.959 
getting a legendary for me I've noticed
that<00:00:58.289> I<00:00:58.350> get<00:00:58.530> a<00:00:58.559> brown<00:00:58.800> one<00:00:59.070> legendary<00:00:59.489> per<00:00:59.760> 5

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
that I get a brown one legendary per 5

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.549 
that I get a brown one legendary per 5
catches<00:01:00.270> that's<00:01:01.109> just<00:01:01.289> what<00:01:01.410> I've<00:01:01.530> been

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
catches that's just what I've been

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.110 
catches that's just what I've been
averaging<00:01:01.829> and<00:01:02.640> I've<00:01:02.730> gotten<00:01:02.969> some<00:01:03.090> pretty

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
averaging and I've gotten some pretty

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.050 
averaging and I've gotten some pretty
decent<00:01:03.420> loot<00:01:03.780> from<00:01:03.989> doing<00:01:04.290> that<00:01:04.439> but<00:01:05.070> that's

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
decent loot from doing that but that's

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.060 
decent loot from doing that but that's
that<00:01:06.510> this<00:01:06.659> is<00:01:06.840> more<00:01:06.990> or<00:01:07.080> less<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.740> method

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
that this is more or less the the method

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.530 
that this is more or less the the method
for<00:01:08.250> farming<00:01:08.520> legendaries<00:01:09.060> and<00:01:09.270> it's<00:01:09.360> really

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
for farming legendaries and it's really

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.710 
for farming legendaries and it's really
easy<00:01:09.630> you<00:01:10.439> can<00:01:10.590> do<00:01:10.740> this<00:01:10.920> as<00:01:11.369> a<00:01:11.430> fresh<00:01:11.729> 70<00:01:12.180> it's

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
easy you can do this as a fresh 70 it's

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.210 
easy you can do this as a fresh 70 it's
probably<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.140> easier<00:01:13.409> things<00:01:13.650> to<00:01:13.740> do<00:01:14.010> as<00:01:14.189> a

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
probably the easier things to do as a

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.800 
probably the easier things to do as a
fresh<00:01:14.520> 70<00:01:15.000> just<00:01:15.210> because<00:01:15.450> you<00:01:15.540> don't<00:01:15.720> really

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
fresh 70 just because you don't really

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.749 
fresh 70 just because you don't really
have<00:01:15.900> any<00:01:16.229> gear<00:01:16.500> and<00:01:16.799> you<00:01:17.250> actually<00:01:17.400> get<00:01:17.610> some

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
have any gear and you actually get some

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.789 
have any gear and you actually get some
yellows<00:01:18.119> another<00:01:18.360> step<00:01:18.659> too<00:01:18.840> so<00:01:19.200> you<00:01:19.590> can<00:01:19.619> get

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
yellows another step too so you can get

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.440 
yellows another step too so you can get
you<00:01:20.040> can<00:01:20.189> find<00:01:20.400> some<00:01:20.610> little<00:01:20.729> little<00:01:21.240> nice

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450
