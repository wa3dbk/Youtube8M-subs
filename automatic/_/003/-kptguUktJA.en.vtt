00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
that as you can see here it's not quite

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.730 
that as you can see here it's not quite
lining<00:01:54.359> up<00:01:54.509> and<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.109> reason<00:01:55.349> for<00:01:55.499> that<00:01:55.560> is

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
lining up and the reason for that is

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.349 
lining up and the reason for that is
because<00:01:55.770> all<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.459> texts<00:01:56.729> I've<00:01:56.849> done<00:01:56.999> earlier

00:01:57.349 --> 00:01:57.359 
because all the texts I've done earlier

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:59.269 
because all the texts I've done earlier
was<00:01:57.479> from<00:01:57.630> a<00:01:57.719> different<00:01:57.899> time<00:01:58.229> and<00:01:58.409> a<00:01:58.679> done

00:01:59.269 --> 00:01:59.279 
was from a different time and a done

00:01:59.279 --> 00:02:00.800 
was from a different time and a done
slightly<00:01:59.579> different<00:01:59.999> settings<00:02:00.299> so<00:02:00.509> it's<00:02:00.630> very

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
slightly different settings so it's very

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.239 
slightly different settings so it's very
important<00:02:01.229> to<00:02:01.289> use<00:02:01.409> the<00:02:01.439> same<00:02:01.709> template<00:02:02.099> each

00:02:02.239 --> 00:02:02.249 
important to use the same template each

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:03.620 
important to use the same template each
time<00:02:02.520> to<00:02:02.700> get<00:02:02.819> things<00:02:02.969> to<00:02:03.149> line<00:02:03.299> up<00:02:03.450> properly

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
time to get things to line up properly

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.620 
time to get things to line up properly
so<00:02:04.529> going<00:02:05.399> back<00:02:05.609> into<00:02:05.789> it<00:02:06.029> select<00:02:06.509> the

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
so going back into it select the

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.690 
so going back into it select the
template<00:02:06.989> we've<00:02:07.169> just<00:02:07.469> done<00:02:07.679> and<00:02:07.919> basically

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
template we've just done and basically

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.609 
template we've just done and basically
just<00:02:09.179> rename<00:02:09.539> it<00:02:09.720> to<00:02:09.750> whatever<00:02:09.989> you<00:02:10.229> want<00:02:10.410> and

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
just rename it to whatever you want and

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.520 
just rename it to whatever you want and
so<00:02:11.550> I'm<00:02:11.610> just<00:02:11.640> got<00:02:11.880> caught<00:02:12.239> test2<00:02:12.870> you<00:02:13.349> may

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
so I'm just got caught test2 you may

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.320 
so I'm just got caught test2 you may
have<00:02:13.709> to<00:02:13.860> adjust<00:02:13.950> the<00:02:14.220> size<00:02:14.460> if<00:02:14.670> your<00:02:14.880> text<00:02:15.120> is

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
have to adjust the size if your text is

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.839 
have to adjust the size if your text is
longer

00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:15.849 
longer

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:20.580 
longer
but<00:02:16.090> yeah<00:02:17.829> make<00:02:18.280> sure<00:02:18.459> it's<00:02:18.640> same<00:02:19.060> 2x1<00:02:19.540> and<00:02:19.959> now

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
but yeah make sure it's same 2x1 and now

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:21.629 
but yeah make sure it's same 2x1 and now
you'll<00:02:20.859> see<00:02:21.040> that<00:02:21.159> they'll<00:02:21.340> line<00:02:21.609> up

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:21.639 
you'll see that they'll line up

00:02:21.639 --> 00:02:24.869 
you'll see that they'll line up
perfectly<00:02:21.959> just<00:02:22.959> like<00:02:23.109> that<00:02:23.290> so<00:02:23.920> that's<00:02:24.609> it

00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:24.879 
perfectly just like that so that's it

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:29.550 
perfectly just like that so that's it
basically<00:02:25.680> not<00:02:26.680> much<00:02:26.859> to<00:02:27.099> it<00:02:27.420> as<00:02:28.420> for<00:02:28.780> my<00:02:28.900> a<00:02:29.109> DW

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
basically not much to it as for my a DW

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.879 
basically not much to it as for my a DW
e^x<00:02:30.010> settings<00:02:30.370> I've<00:02:30.639> just<00:02:30.849> got<00:02:31.030> my<00:02:31.060> icon<00:02:31.599> size

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:31.889 
e^x settings I've just got my icon size

00:02:31.889 --> 00:02:34.949 
e^x settings I've just got my icon size
to<00:02:32.889> the<00:02:33.069> absolute<00:02:33.430> maximum<00:02:33.730> which<00:02:34.150> is<00:02:34.180> 200<00:02:34.870> and

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
to the absolute maximum which is 200 and

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:37.280 
to the absolute maximum which is 200 and
that's<00:02:35.200> important<00:02:35.620> to<00:02:35.680> get<00:02:35.799> the<00:02:35.889> icons<00:02:36.219> so<00:02:36.459> big

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
that's important to get the icons so big

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.390 
that's important to get the icons so big
because<00:02:38.290> it<00:02:38.409> works<00:02:38.590> well<00:02:38.799> for<00:02:38.829> tablets<00:02:39.280> I

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
because it works well for tablets I

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.360 
because it works well for tablets I
guess<00:02:39.900> for<00:02:40.900> animation<00:02:41.409> I've<00:02:41.650> just<00:02:41.889> got<00:02:42.129> the

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
guess for animation I've just got the

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.899 
guess for animation I've just got the
stripe

00:02:42.899 --> 00:02:42.909 
stripe

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:47.520 
stripe
animation<00:02:44.549> sliding<00:02:45.549> but<00:02:46.510> you<00:02:47.169> can<00:02:47.260> get<00:02:47.379> some

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
animation sliding but you can get some

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.129 
animation sliding but you can get some
pretty<00:02:47.709> interesting<00:02:47.919> effects<00:02:48.430> when<00:02:48.700> you<00:02:48.760> are

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:49.139 
pretty interesting effects when you are

00:02:49.139 --> 00:02:51.240 
pretty interesting effects when you are
decide<00:02:50.139> to<00:02:50.290> change<00:02:50.500> that<00:02:50.709> to<00:02:50.919> different

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
decide to change that to different

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.959 
decide to change that to different
things<00:02:53.069> another<00:02:54.069> point<00:02:54.340> here<00:02:54.519> I've<00:02:54.609> got<00:02:54.849> a

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:54.969 
things another point here I've got a

00:02:54.969 --> 00:02:56.490 
things another point here I've got a
pretty<00:02:55.239> cool<00:02:55.480> wallpaper<00:02:55.810> that<00:02:55.959> I<00:02:56.019> found<00:02:56.290> it's

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
pretty cool wallpaper that I found it's

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.479 
pretty cool wallpaper that I found it's
called<00:02:57.780> what's<00:02:58.780> called<00:02:59.019> Exodus<00:02:59.500> and<00:02:59.709> it's

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489 
called what's called Exodus and it's

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:01.800 
called what's called Exodus and it's
kind<00:03:00.699> of<00:03:00.760> just<00:03:00.879> like<00:03:00.969> all<00:03:01.209> these<00:03:01.329> blocks<00:03:01.659> that

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
kind of just like all these blocks that

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.080 
kind of just like all these blocks that
follow<00:03:02.469> your<00:03:02.680> hand<00:03:02.889> movements<00:03:03.340> and<00:03:03.489> generate

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
follow your hand movements and generate

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.179 
follow your hand movements and generate
according<00:03:04.959> to<00:03:05.139> where<00:03:05.439> your<00:03:05.560> finger<00:03:05.829> presses

00:03:06.179 --> 00:03:06.189 
according to where your finger presses

00:03:06.189 --> 00:03:09.179 
according to where your finger presses
which<00:03:06.370> is<00:03:06.519> pretty<00:03:06.699> cool<00:03:07.769> yeah<00:03:08.769> on<00:03:09.040> any

00:03:09.179 --> 00:03:09.189 
which is pretty cool yeah on any

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:11.490 
which is pretty cool yeah on any
wallpaper<00:03:09.459> this<00:03:10.239> kind<00:03:10.449> of<00:03:10.540> setup<00:03:11.230> looks

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
wallpaper this kind of setup looks

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.589 
wallpaper this kind of setup looks
pretty<00:03:11.739> awesome<00:03:12.150> so<00:03:13.150> if<00:03:13.239> you<00:03:13.359> want<00:03:13.480> to<00:03:13.540> be

00:03:13.589 --> 00:03:13.599 
pretty awesome so if you want to be

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:15.119 
pretty awesome so if you want to be
really<00:03:13.900> crazy<00:03:14.079> you<00:03:14.290> can<00:03:14.409> actually<00:03:14.530> try<00:03:15.069> this

00:03:15.119 --> 00:03:15.129 
really crazy you can actually try this

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:17.069 
really crazy you can actually try this
you<00:03:15.459> can<00:03:15.609> output<00:03:15.760> absolutely<00:03:16.689> everything<00:03:16.930> on

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:17.079 
you can output absolutely everything on

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:19.740 
you can output absolutely everything on
random<00:03:17.409> so<00:03:17.590> that<00:03:17.620> is<00:03:17.889> a<00:03:18.280> twe<00:03:18.849> X<00:03:19.090> transition

well and you can actually come up some
really<00:03:25.989> cool<00:03:26.169> combinations<00:03:26.799> that<00:03:26.919> are<00:03:27.069> you'll

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
really cool combinations that are you'll

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:29.789 
really cool combinations that are you'll
probably<00:03:28.239> the<00:03:28.449> thought<00:03:28.720> of<00:03:28.870> so<00:03:29.109> you<00:03:29.590> just

00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:29.799 
probably the thought of so you just

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:31.020 
probably the thought of so you just
choose<00:03:29.979> the<00:03:30.009> one<00:03:30.189> that<00:03:30.220> suits<00:03:30.489> you<00:03:30.729> but

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
choose the one that suits you but

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:32.339 
choose the one that suits you but
probably<00:03:31.359> don't<00:03:31.629> leave<00:03:31.750> it<00:03:31.870> going<00:03:32.139> all<00:03:32.259> the

00:03:32.339 --> 00:03:32.349 
probably don't leave it going all the

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:34.679 
probably don't leave it going all the
time<00:03:32.379> because<00:03:32.650> a<00:03:32.739> bit<00:03:32.949> chaotic<00:03:33.099> but<00:03:34.060> um<00:03:34.239> yeah

00:03:34.679 --> 00:03:34.689 
time because a bit chaotic but um yeah

00:03:34.689 --> 00:03:35.879 
time because a bit chaotic but um yeah
so<00:03:34.870> I<00:03:34.900> guess<00:03:34.959> that<00:03:35.199> pretty<00:03:35.319> much<00:03:35.439> wraps<00:03:35.650> up<00:03:35.829> the

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:35.889 
so I guess that pretty much wraps up the
