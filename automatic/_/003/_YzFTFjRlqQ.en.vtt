 This is the third in the world Moscow

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:51.680
 and clicking the next window 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.040

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:06.720
 and after the landing of our bases 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:07.520
 data 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.300
 you may not be as many as here 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.600
 just one or two 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.600

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.590
 I am with this statement to our what for example

 besides the trampoline saved settings 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:39.340

 but despite the fact that to the shoulders 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.650
 because you can't naturally 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:04.190
 denied keeping with 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:05.340

00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:15.649
 we gave the ending 

00:02:15.649 --> 00:02:17.159
 someone saved 

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:20.159
 click on the button brix 

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:22.819
 now i'm going to completely 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:25.819
 Bryanskenergo psychologist as a monk 

00:02:26.859 --> 00:02:29.239
 and reinstall to produce 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:32.239
 recovery procedure 

00:02:33.419 --> 00:02:35.199
 these are all registered 

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:38.079

00:02:47.469 --> 00:02:50.759
 in the interest of 10 paintings statistical 

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:57.150
 look at the construction site honda my set up 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.150
 here and no 

00:03:01.029 --> 00:03:02.819
 world the case again will not have to 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:04.629
 appear after we import 

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:07.629
 moshe saved 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:12.189
 here they must be once more the moment 

00:03:12.189 --> 00:03:15.189
 at 0 38 so the player is not selected 

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:19.119
 but now we will restore 

00:03:19.119 --> 00:03:21.639
 logs to parnas database and everything will become 

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:24.639
 as needed 

00:03:28.029 --> 00:03:30.100
 she is so long 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:31.640
 many of london reinforcement law 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.439
 committed was not possible 

00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:37.769
 WHO and now there 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:40.219
 not ready 

00:03:40.219 --> 00:03:42.409
 so 

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:45.769
 we select the file menu 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:49.149
 further menu item until office side 

00:03:49.149 --> 00:03:50.869
 news starts 

00:03:50.869 --> 00:03:53.829
 recovery report 

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:56.419
 can not list all databases center 

00:03:56.419 --> 00:03:59.289
 which is known on this computer 

00:03:59.289 --> 00:04:02.269
 so you need to finish this side 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:04.379
 this is what 

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:06.409
 we are going to install the given 

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:09.409
 deal 

00:04:10.219 --> 00:04:13.139
 so we find the file that is saved 

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:14.539
 relief table 

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:17.539
 and on the internet 

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:21.319
 you see two databases but install 

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:23.759
 can only one of them 

00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:25.240
 at once 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.990
 This is due to the fact that 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:28.740
 Fao information is recorded 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.319
 configurations 

00:04:30.319 --> 00:04:32.379
 is a base of help 

00:04:32.379 --> 00:04:34.319
 which will load when 

00:04:34.319 --> 00:04:37.610
 the start of the match 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:39.830
 then the question was really raised 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:43.150
 the situation is now 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:46.189
 but the central issue 

00:04:46.189 --> 00:04:48.659
 if you have a hard time saying or writing 

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:50.930
 but then you always 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:53.270
 but i'm an old database will 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:54.530
 it was her so about this 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:56.180
 don't worry 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:58.979
 next we pressed the start of the story then 

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:00.960
 click Hess in all these experienced 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:02.300
 I confirm that we 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:05.499
 280 

00:05:05.499 --> 00:05:08.119
 now we are invited to lead and 

00:05:08.119 --> 00:05:09.219
 plucked up 

00:05:09.219 --> 00:05:12.219
 would hold to cancellation by deed 

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:18.449
 Now we see that in the status window of our 

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:21.159
 database recovery is in progress 

00:05:21.159 --> 00:05:23.769
 in this particular base there are few hands where 

00:05:23.769 --> 00:05:25.779
 then about fifty thousand 

00:05:25.779 --> 00:05:26.859
 so the recovery process 

00:05:26.859 --> 00:05:29.759
 only takes a few minutes 

00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:32.229
 if your base is a million real it 

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:35.650
 may take an hour with her all the more so 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:38.349
 be tolerant 

00:05:38.349 --> 00:05:40.539
 although it is much faster than there is 

00:05:40.539 --> 00:05:42.339
 keep it wide and then them 

00:05:42.339 --> 00:05:44.659
 import final percents 

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:47.009
 and here you see what we called not 

00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:48.430
 were quoted 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:51.870
 and no mistakes 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:54.870
 Now we will run the match 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:04.460
 I already mentioned that there should have been 

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:07.080
 stop at the construction site of my care 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:09.479
 friends have not recovered 

00:06:09.479 --> 00:06:12.479
 here 

00:06:13.409 --> 00:06:15.229
 these were also imported 

00:06:15.229 --> 00:06:17.249
 settings authors here 

00:06:17.249 --> 00:06:20.689
 we no longer need anything but tried 

00:06:20.689 --> 00:06:23.819
 we are not yet 

00:06:23.819 --> 00:06:25.779
 I made changes here this account 

00:06:25.779 --> 00:06:27.779
 add yourself a few of it 

00:06:27.779 --> 00:06:30.779
 parameters here they are not preserved 

00:06:32.389 --> 00:06:34.029
 in this way 

00:06:34.029 --> 00:06:36.149
 my function is ducato restoration 

00:06:36.149 --> 00:06:38.860
 Paz will help you 

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:41.069
 move it the same committee itself with 

00:06:41.069 --> 00:06:43.689
 minimal disappeared 

00:06:43.689 --> 00:06:45.949
 Well, that's all 

00:06:45.949 --> 00:06:48.499
 in conclusion, I would like to answer sweet cherry 

00:06:48.499 --> 00:06:50.889
 Sechuku begin in shawls 

00:06:50.889 --> 00:06:54.540
 You can still see 80 on us 

00:06:54.539 --> 00:06:56.240
 criticized otherwise 

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:58.349
 and also read the manual 

00:06:58.349 --> 00:07:00.279
 core issues 

00:07:00.279 --> 00:07:00.829
 by program
