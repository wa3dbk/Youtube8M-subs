this<00:01:33.649> is<00:01:33.800> what<00:01:33.920> a<00:01:33.950> pioneer<00:01:34.520> looks<00:01:34.759> like

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:35.050 
this is what a pioneer looks like

creativity the great power of tools like
the<00:02:08.000> Macintosh<00:02:08.450> is<00:02:08.920> precisely<00:02:09.920> that<00:02:10.250> you

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
the Macintosh is precisely that you

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:12.100 
the Macintosh is precisely that you
can't<00:02:10.610> predict<00:02:11.090> where<00:02:11.450> they're<00:02:11.599> going<00:02:11.840> to<00:02:11.930> go

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.800 
can't predict where they're going to go
the<00:02:12.770> future<00:02:13.250> of<00:02:13.400> creation<00:02:14.060> it's<00:02:14.450> really

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
the future of creation it's really

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.199 
the future of creation it's really
bringing<00:02:15.260> people<00:02:15.580> together<00:02:16.580> and<00:02:16.910> bringing

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:30.460 

nobody<00:02:28.460> had<00:02:28.670> any<00:02:28.790> idea<00:02:28.910> 30<00:02:29.450> years<00:02:29.720> ago<00:02:29.990> what

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
nobody had any idea 30 years ago what

nobody had any idea 30 years ago what
the<00:02:30.680> world<00:02:30.860> was<00:02:31.040> going<00:02:31.160> to<00:02:31.220> be<00:02:31.280> like<00:02:31.520> now<00:02:32.000> or

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:32.240 
the world was going to be like now or

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:33.780 
the world was going to be like now or
how<00:02:32.420> these<00:02:32.630> tools<00:02:32.870> were<00:02:33.080> going<00:02:33.290> to<00:02:33.380> be<00:02:33.470> used

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
how these tools were going to be used

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.850 
how these tools were going to be used
they<00:02:34.790> are<00:02:34.820> interesting<00:02:35.570> precisely<00:02:36.470> because

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
they are interesting precisely because

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.680 
they are interesting precisely because
you<00:02:37.400> don't<00:02:37.760> know<00:02:37.940> how<00:02:38.120> they're<00:02:38.330> going<00:02:38.480> to<00:02:38.570> be

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
you don't know how they're going to be

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.559 
you don't know how they're going to be
used<00:02:38.960> tomorrow

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:41.569 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:43.270 

and<00:02:41.930> that's<00:02:42.170> the<00:02:42.409> beauty<00:02:42.739> and<00:02:42.829> the<00:02:42.950> power<00:02:42.980> of

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
and that's the beauty and the power of

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.939 
and that's the beauty and the power of
