we<00:00:00.599> set<00:00:00.810> up<00:00:00.840> the<00:00:01.020> transit<00:00:01.439> so<00:00:01.530> we<00:00:01.650> could<00:00:01.770> see

00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:01.979 
we set up the transit so we could see

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.349 
we set up the transit so we could see
everything<00:00:02.419> this<00:00:03.419> now<00:00:03.659> becomes<00:00:04.020> our<00:00:04.319> are

00:00:05.349 --> 00:00:05.359 
everything this now becomes our are

00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:07.280 
everything this now becomes our are
typically<00:00:06.359> on<00:00:06.480> a<00:00:06.509> plan<00:00:06.870> you'll<00:00:07.109> have<00:00:07.259> a

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
typically on a plan you'll have a

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.049 
typically on a plan you'll have a
benchmark<00:00:07.620> the<00:00:08.099> surveyor<00:00:08.460> will<00:00:08.700> come<00:00:08.910> and

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
benchmark the surveyor will come and

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.180 
benchmark the surveyor will come and
he'll<00:00:09.179> set<00:00:09.360> a<00:00:09.389> stake<00:00:09.750> he'll<00:00:10.710> drive<00:00:10.920> a<00:00:10.950> little

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
he'll set a stake he'll drive a little

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:12.770 
he'll set a stake he'll drive a little
nail<00:00:11.370> on<00:00:11.580> the<00:00:11.639> ground<00:00:11.880> drive<00:00:12.179> a<00:00:12.210> stake<00:00:12.540> with<00:00:12.750> a

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
nail on the ground drive a stake with a

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.509 
nail on the ground drive a stake with a
nail<00:00:12.990> in<00:00:13.139> the<00:00:13.170> head<00:00:13.259> then<00:00:14.219> it<00:00:14.370> put<00:00:14.490> another

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
nail in the head then it put another

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.220 
nail in the head then it put another
stake<00:00:15.000> like<00:00:15.179> this<00:00:15.330> next<00:00:15.599> to<00:00:15.750> it<00:00:15.839> you'll<00:00:15.990> write

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
stake like this next to it you'll write

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.769 
stake like this next to it you'll write
on<00:00:16.379> this<00:00:16.529> stake<00:00:17.029> what<00:00:18.029> he's<00:00:18.210> shooting<00:00:18.570> on<00:00:18.660> the

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
on this stake what he's shooting on the

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.510 
on this stake what he's shooting on the
top<00:00:18.960> of<00:00:19.109> the<00:00:19.170> nail<00:00:19.380> and<00:00:19.650> then<00:00:19.920> that'll<00:00:20.250> be<00:00:20.279> your

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
top of the nail and then that'll be your

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.429 
top of the nail and then that'll be your
mark<00:00:20.730> or<00:00:21.000> it<00:00:21.270> could<00:00:21.449> be<00:00:21.570> a<00:00:21.600> manhole<00:00:22.050> cover<00:00:22.289> in

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
mark or it could be a manhole cover in

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.259 
mark or it could be a manhole cover in
the<00:00:22.560> street<00:00:22.859> or<00:00:23.130> it<00:00:23.400> could<00:00:23.580> be<00:00:23.699> a<00:00:23.730> nail<00:00:24.029> and<00:00:24.240> a

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
the street or it could be a nail and a

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.779 
the street or it could be a nail and a
power<00:00:24.480> pole<00:00:24.840> or<00:00:25.140> anything<00:00:25.890> he<00:00:26.039> designates<00:00:26.640> as

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
power pole or anything he designates as

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.859 
power pole or anything he designates as
the<00:00:26.939> benchmark<00:00:28.220> then<00:00:29.220> you<00:00:29.400> then<00:00:30.029> you<00:00:30.060> take<00:00:30.539> his

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
the benchmark then you then you take his

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.690 
the benchmark then you then you take his
his<00:00:31.320> number<00:00:31.740> it<00:00:31.859> could<00:00:31.980> be<00:00:32.130> seventy<00:00:32.550> nine

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
his number it could be seventy nine

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.280 
his number it could be seventy nine
point<00:00:32.969> sixty<00:00:33.390> three<00:00:33.570> hundredths<00:00:34.020> they<00:00:34.110> always

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
point sixty three hundredths they always

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.110 
point sixty three hundredths they always
work<00:00:34.469> in<00:00:34.620> tenths<00:00:35.010> and<00:00:35.160> hundredths<00:00:35.610> okay

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
work in tenths and hundredths okay

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.139 
work in tenths and hundredths okay
surveyors<00:00:36.739> so<00:00:37.739> then<00:00:37.980> you<00:00:38.129> you<00:00:38.579> have<00:00:38.610> to<00:00:38.879> since

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
surveyors so then you you have to since

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:40.369 
surveyors so then you you have to since
we're<00:00:39.270> working<00:00:39.540> in<00:00:39.660> feet<00:00:39.840> and<00:00:39.960> inches<00:00:40.079> you

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
we're working in feet and inches you

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.979 
we're working in feet and inches you
have<00:00:40.500> to<00:00:40.680> use<00:00:41.340> one<00:00:41.520> of<00:00:41.550> those<00:00:41.730> engineers<00:00:42.690> rules

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
have to use one of those engineers rules

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.020 
have to use one of those engineers rules
to<00:00:43.290> figure<00:00:43.680> out<00:00:43.770> what<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.100> conversion<00:00:44.489> is<00:00:44.760> and

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
to figure out what the conversion is and

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.250 
to figure out what the conversion is and
I<00:00:45.059> can<00:00:45.210> show<00:00:45.360> you<00:00:45.420> that<00:00:45.629> later<00:00:45.780> when<00:00:46.050> we<00:00:46.079> go

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
I can show you that later when we go

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.450 
I can show you that later when we go
into<00:00:46.379> tools<00:00:46.640> but<00:00:49.010> but<00:00:50.010> we<00:00:50.129> don't<00:00:50.309> have

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
into tools but but we don't have

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.619 
into tools but but we don't have
anything<00:00:50.789> like<00:00:51.030> that<00:00:51.090> we<00:00:51.329> don't<00:00:51.420> have<00:00:51.600> a

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
anything like that we don't have a

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.900 
anything like that we don't have a
surveyor<00:00:52.050> nobody's<00:00:52.500> come<00:00:52.739> out<00:00:52.770> to<00:00:53.250> give<00:00:53.670> us<00:00:53.699> a

half a pot of below that point so all

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.429 
half a pot of below that point so all
we're<00:01:14.369> doing<00:01:14.729> is<00:01:14.939> taking<00:01:15.540> that<00:01:15.960> measurement

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
we're doing is taking that measurement

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.520 
of an inch right look at the pot were
cutting<00:01:28.159> so<00:01:29.159> we<00:01:29.400> went<00:01:29.610> took<00:01:29.909> off<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.299> half

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
cutting so we went took off the half

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.830 
cutting so we went took off the half
then<00:01:31.530> we<00:01:31.590> counted<00:01:32.100> one<00:01:32.310> two<00:01:32.640> three<00:01:33.090> four<00:01:33.420> five

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
the level of the dirt roughly that she's

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.330 
the level of the dirt roughly that she's
shot<00:02:35.660> over<00:02:35.959> there<00:02:36.049> cause<00:02:36.380> here<00:02:36.680> here's<00:02:37.250> a

shot over there cause here here's a

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.580 
shot over there cause here here's a
little<00:02:37.700> footing<00:02:38.030> you've<00:02:38.180> dug<00:02:38.420> we're<00:02:39.410> going<00:02:39.530> to

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
little footing you've dug we're going to

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.339 
little footing you've dug we're going to
be<00:02:39.739> forming<00:02:40.190> a<00:02:40.340> two<00:02:40.610> by<00:02:40.760> twelve<00:02:41.299> and<00:02:41.630> two<00:02:42.200> by

00:02:42.339 --> 00:02:42.349 
be forming a two by twelve and two by

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:44.710 
be forming a two by twelve and two by
something<00:02:42.890> that<00:02:43.130> we<00:02:43.370> have<00:02:43.519> to<00:02:43.670> rip<00:02:43.850> to<00:02:44.209> equal<00:02:44.630> a

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
something that we have to rip to equal a

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.110 
something that we have to rip to equal a
full<00:02:44.930> potta<00:02:45.260> off<00:02:46.100> the<00:02:46.370> bottom<00:02:46.640> of<00:02:46.700> the<00:02:46.760> footing

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
full potta off the bottom of the footing

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.759 
full potta off the bottom of the footing
we're<00:02:47.239> forming<00:02:47.569> on<00:02:47.720> the<00:02:47.810> inside<00:02:48.230> so<00:02:48.560> that<00:02:48.680> we

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:48.769 
we're forming on the inside so that we

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:50.500 
we're forming on the inside so that we
have<00:02:48.920> a<00:02:49.160> perfect<00:02:49.489> mother<00:02:49.880> wall<00:02:50.150> all<00:02:50.390> the<00:02:50.420> way

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
have a perfect mother wall all the way

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.280 
have a perfect mother wall all the way
down<00:02:50.720> to<00:02:50.870> the<00:02:50.959> dirt<00:02:51.519> then<00:02:52.519> 5<00:02:53.390> and<00:02:53.600> 7/8<00:02:53.989> over

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
down to the dirt then 5 and 7/8 over

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.490 
down to the dirt then 5 and 7/8 over
that<00:02:54.799> right<00:02:55.030> the<00:02:56.030> stem<00:02:56.269> walls<00:02:56.480> 5<00:02:56.750> and<00:02:56.930> 7/8<00:02:57.319> wide

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
that right the stem walls 5 and 7/8 wide

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.710 
that right the stem walls 5 and 7/8 wide
you<00:02:57.920> know<00:02:58.040> what<00:02:58.220> um<00:02:58.519> are<00:02:59.269> you<00:02:59.329> gonna<00:02:59.450> make<00:02:59.630> it

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
you know what um are you gonna make it

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.930 
you know what um are you gonna make it
up<00:02:59.810> now<00:02:59.930> exactly<00:03:00.410> so<00:03:00.590> we<00:03:01.069> need<00:03:01.280> to<00:03:01.430> relook<00:03:01.790> at

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
up now exactly so we need to relook at

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:03.849 
up now exactly so we need to relook at
that<00:03:02.180> because<00:03:02.690> I<00:03:02.810> think<00:03:02.870> your<00:03:03.200> calculations

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:03.859 
that because I think your calculations

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:06.759 
that because I think your calculations
are<00:03:04.040> wrong<00:03:04.160> okay<00:03:04.840> well<00:03:05.840> whatever<00:03:06.019> it<00:03:06.260> is<00:03:06.380> we're

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:06.769 
are wrong okay well whatever it is we're

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:09.009 
are wrong okay well whatever it is we're
not<00:03:06.859> even<00:03:06.920> there<00:03:07.220> yet<00:03:07.280> but<00:03:08.269> this<00:03:08.540> is<00:03:08.600> the<00:03:08.840> most

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:09.019 
not even there yet but this is the most

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:11.319 
not even there yet but this is the most
important<00:03:09.500> point<00:03:09.709> so<00:03:09.889> this<00:03:10.850> is<00:03:11.060> what<00:03:11.209> we're

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:11.329 
important point so this is what we're

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:13.000 
important point so this is what we're
laying<00:03:11.510> out<00:03:11.750> is<00:03:11.930> the<00:03:12.079> top<00:03:12.260> of<00:03:12.470> this<00:03:12.590> 2<00:03:12.829> by

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
laying out is the top of this 2 by

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:21.220 
laying out is the top of this 2 by
little<00:03:13.880> -<00:03:14.690> by<00:03:14.840> that<00:03:15.590> we've<00:03:15.709> got<00:03:15.859> here<00:03:17.620> so<00:03:20.230> and

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
little - by that we've got here so and

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.410 
little - by that we've got here so and
then<00:03:21.709> this<00:03:21.829> this<00:03:22.130> one<00:03:22.310> goes<00:03:22.489> on<00:03:22.609> the<00:03:22.730> inside<00:03:22.880> I

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
then this this one goes on the inside I

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.129 
then this this one goes on the inside I
mean<00:03:23.900> on<00:03:24.260> the<00:03:24.470> outside<00:03:25.720> because<00:03:26.720> we<00:03:26.900> don't

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:27.139 
mean on the outside because we don't

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:28.900 
mean on the outside because we don't
care<00:03:27.380> you<00:03:28.040> know<00:03:28.130> what<00:03:28.310> the<00:03:28.400> concrete<00:03:28.790> does

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:28.910 
care you know what the concrete does

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:30.309 
care you know what the concrete does
stuff<00:03:29.150> underneath<00:03:29.420> and<00:03:29.660> go<00:03:29.750> against<00:03:29.989> the<00:03:30.170> dirt

00:03:30.309 --> 00:03:30.319 
stuff underneath and go against the dirt

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:33.370 
stuff underneath and go against the dirt
on<00:03:30.560> the<00:03:30.739> outside<00:03:31.989> so<00:03:32.989> what<00:03:33.230> we're

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
on the outside so what we're

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.250 
on the outside so what we're
establishing<00:03:33.709> right<00:03:34.250> now<00:03:34.459> is<00:03:34.760> that<00:03:35.260> point

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
establishing right now is that point

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.920 
establishing right now is that point
right<00:03:36.859> there<00:03:36.920> and<00:03:37.430> our<00:03:37.940> string<00:03:38.359> running<00:03:38.599> all

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:38.930 
right there and our string running all

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:42.530 
right there and our string running all
the<00:03:39.049> way<00:03:39.079> around<00:03:39.470> at<00:03:39.829> that<00:03:40.010> point

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.330 

okay<00:03:43.540> so<00:03:44.110> we<00:03:44.200> need<00:03:44.350> another<00:03:44.500> string<00:03:44.980> once<00:03:45.190> we

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
okay so we need another string once we

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.660 
okay so we need another string once we
get<00:03:45.460> these<00:03:45.670> lines<00:03:46.060> up<00:03:46.270> so<00:03:46.480> this<00:03:47.320> shot<00:03:47.920> at<00:03:48.190> 42

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:48.670 
get these lines up so this shot at 42

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:54.060 
get these lines up so this shot at 42
and<00:03:48.700> a<00:03:48.880> half<00:03:49.470> from<00:03:50.470> there<00:03:51.780> to<00:03:52.780> there<00:03:53.020> seven<00:03:53.920> and

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:54.070 
and a half from there to there seven and

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:55.860 
and a half from there to there seven and
nine<00:03:54.190> sixteenths<00:03:54.790> we<00:03:55.120> subtracted<00:03:55.720> that<00:03:55.810> from

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
nine sixteenths we subtracted that from

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:57.750 
nine sixteenths we subtracted that from
that<00:03:56.230> and<00:03:56.500> came<00:03:56.740> up<00:03:56.890> with<00:03:57.070> thirty<00:03:57.280> four<00:03:57.580> and

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
that and came up with thirty four and

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.140 
that and came up with thirty four and
fifteen<00:03:57.910> sixteen<00:03:59.460> that's<00:04:00.460> all<00:04:00.670> we've<00:04:00.820> done<00:04:00.850> so

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.150 
fifteen sixteen that's all we've done so

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.840 
fifteen sixteen that's all we've done so
far<00:04:01.180> so<00:04:01.930> to<00:04:01.990> get<00:04:02.440> that<00:04:02.800> thirty<00:04:03.550> four<00:04:03.790> and

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:03.850 
far so to get that thirty four and

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:05.340 
far so to get that thirty four and
