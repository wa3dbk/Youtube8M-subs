00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:07.970 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.640 

around<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.210> area<00:01:09.510> you<00:01:09.780> are<00:01:09.810> required<00:01:10.290> to<00:01:10.500> do

monkey

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.880 

and<00:02:18.000> after<00:02:18.390> a<00:02:18.450> certain<00:02:18.600> amount<00:02:18.810> of<00:02:19.020> time<00:02:19.260> the

and after a certain amount of time the

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.280 
and after a certain amount of time the
thing<00:02:20.820> in<00:02:20.940> the<00:02:21.000> middle<00:02:21.030> starts<00:02:21.750> spinning<00:02:22.080> back

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
thing in the middle starts spinning back

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.440 
thing in the middle starts spinning back
to<00:02:22.440> its<00:02:22.560> normal<00:02:22.740> direction<00:02:23.640> so<00:02:23.910> you<00:02:23.970> have<00:02:24.420> a

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
to its normal direction so you have a

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.020 
to its normal direction so you have a
time<00:02:24.720> limit<00:02:24.920> on<00:02:25.920> this<00:02:26.370> first<00:02:26.640> one<00:02:26.820> it<00:02:26.910> doesn't

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
time limit on this first one it doesn't

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.930 
time limit on this first one it doesn't
display<00:02:27.390> the<00:02:27.450> time<00:02:27.690> limit<00:02:27.990> and<00:02:29.390> once<00:02:30.390> you<00:02:30.720> have

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
done each little each part there's three

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.230 
done each little each part there's three
sections<00:02:36.270> each<00:02:36.540> part<00:02:36.960> each<00:02:37.170> section<00:02:38.240> once

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.240 
sections each part each section once

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.160 
sections each part each section once
completed<00:02:39.690> will<00:02:40.280> light<00:02:41.280> up<00:02:41.640> part<00:02:42.120> of<00:02:42.390> the<00:02:42.840> big

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
completed will light up part of the big

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
so the enemies in this water

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.330 
so the enemies in this water
strangely<00:03:33.540> enough<00:03:33.750> the<00:03:34.260> water<00:03:34.890> doesn't<00:03:35.100> put

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340

avoid them they don't do anything so
this<00:03:50.780> is<00:03:50.930> like<00:03:51.080> the<00:03:51.230> first<00:03:51.550> big<00:03:52.550> swimming<00:03:52.970> area

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:53.540 
this is like the first big swimming area

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.470 
this is like the first big swimming area
in<00:03:53.660> the<00:03:53.780> game<00:03:53.960> you<00:03:54.380> should<00:03:54.560> really<00:03:54.740> learn<00:03:54.950> to

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
in the game you should really learn to

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.420 
in the game you should really learn to
master<00:03:56.480> swimming<00:03:57.200> in<00:03:57.290> the<00:03:57.350> scam<00:03:57.620> no<00:03:58.250> one

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.410 
really says difficult you press a button

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:03.460 
really says difficult you press a button
to<00:04:00.710> move<00:04:00.830> forwards<00:04:01.340> and<00:04:01.640> then<00:04:02.140> right<00:04:03.140> to<00:04:03.380> move

good thing and you get rewarded gears

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:19.539 
good thing and you get rewarded gears
worth<00:04:16.970> 25<00:04:17.660> for<00:04:17.930> doing<00:04:18.170> that<00:04:18.320> and<00:04:18.650> thus<00:04:19.310> are

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:19.549 
worth 25 for doing that and thus are

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:24.300 
worth 25 for doing that and thus are
difficult<00:04:19.910> tasks

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:27.120 

now<00:04:24.910> there<00:04:25.300> will<00:04:25.570> be<00:04:25.630> a<00:04:25.780> point<00:04:26.080> in<00:04:26.500> this<00:04:26.740> level

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
now there will be a point in this level

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:29.070 
now there will be a point in this level
which<00:04:27.460> is<00:04:27.669> very<00:04:27.910> difficult<00:04:28.210> where<00:04:28.780> there's<00:04:29.020> a

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
which is very difficult where there's a

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.740 
which is very difficult where there's a
current<00:04:29.530> in<00:04:29.680> the<00:04:29.800> water<00:04:29.950> and<00:04:30.690> you<00:04:31.690> are

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:31.750 
current in the water and you are

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.350 
current in the water and you are
required<00:04:32.080> to<00:04:32.740> fall<00:04:33.130> off<00:04:33.370> the<00:04:33.669> edge<00:04:33.790> of<00:04:34.060> the

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:34.360 
required to fall off the edge of the

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.180 
required to fall off the edge of the
waterfall<00:04:35.020> because<00:04:35.440> of<00:04:35.710> the<00:04:35.800> current<00:04:36.100> is

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:36.190 
waterfall because of the current is

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:37.860 
waterfall because of the current is
pushing<00:04:36.430> the<00:04:36.610> water<00:04:36.760> off<00:04:36.940> the<00:04:36.970> waffle<00:04:37.450> that's

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:37.870 
pushing the water off the waffle that's

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:39.510 
pushing the water off the waffle that's
why<00:04:38.080> you<00:04:38.139> can<00:04:38.440> hear<00:04:38.680> the<00:04:38.919> waterfall<00:04:39.220> sound

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 
why you can hear the waterfall sound

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:40.409 
why you can hear the waterfall sound
back<00:04:39.790> now

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:40.419 
back now

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:45.420 
back now
the<00:04:41.110> idea<00:04:41.440> is<00:04:41.680> you're<00:04:42.100> meant<00:04:42.310> to<00:04:44.190> fall<00:04:45.190> off<00:04:45.310> the

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:45.430 
the idea is you're meant to fall off the

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:50.909 
the idea is you're meant to fall off the
waterfall<00:04:45.639> and<00:04:46.120> obtain<00:04:47.280> one<00:04:48.280> of<00:04:48.310> the<00:04:49.919> gears

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:50.919 
waterfall and obtain one of the gears

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:52.890 
waterfall and obtain one of the gears
during<00:04:51.520> the<00:04:51.580> process<00:04:52.030> which<00:04:52.419> could<00:04:52.570> be<00:04:52.660> a<00:04:52.690> nine

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:52.900 
during the process which could be a nine

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:55.020 
during the process which could be a nine
but<00:04:53.680> if<00:04:53.770> you<00:04:53.889> use<00:04:54.130> the<00:04:54.430> other<00:04:54.490> character<00:04:54.910> to

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:55.030 
but if you use the other character to

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:56.909 
but if you use the other character to
talk<00:04:55.210> about<00:04:55.389> you<00:04:55.540> back<00:04:55.750> to<00:04:55.990> the<00:04:56.110> place<00:04:56.590> you're

00:04:56.909 --> 00:04:56.919 
talk about you back to the place you're

00:04:56.919 --> 00:05:02.090 
talk about you back to the place you're
