00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
I'll show you how now our system is

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.780 
I'll show you how now our system is
composed<00:00:34.530> of<00:00:34.770> two<00:00:34.950> components<00:00:35.430> this<00:00:35.579> is<00:00:35.700> the

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
composed of two components this is the

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.060 
composed of two components this is the
part<00:00:36.000> that<00:00:36.030> goes<00:00:36.239> outside<00:00:36.450> as<00:00:36.989> you<00:00:37.680> can<00:00:37.800> see<00:00:37.950> on

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
part that goes outside as you can see on

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.860 
part that goes outside as you can see on
the<00:00:38.160> front<00:00:38.309> here<00:00:38.610> here<00:00:38.820> are<00:00:38.910> our<00:00:39.000> solar<00:00:39.329> panels

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870

that<00:00:39.960> power<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.770> thing<00:00:40.980> inside<00:00:41.670> here<00:00:42.329> we<00:00:42.719> got

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
that power the thing inside here we got

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.470 
that power the thing inside here we got
a<00:00:42.930> lot<00:00:43.230> going<00:00:43.590> on<00:00:43.710> these<00:00:44.399> electronics<00:00:45.149> in<00:00:45.300> here

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
a lot going on these electronics in here

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.869 
a lot going on these electronics in here
will<00:00:45.930> sort<00:00:46.680> through<00:00:46.860> all<00:00:46.950> of<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.309> data<00:00:47.460> that

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
will sort through all of the data that

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.610 
will sort through all of the data that
the<00:00:48.000> sensor<00:00:48.300> picks<00:00:48.480> up<00:00:48.780> and<00:00:48.960> send<00:00:49.500> it

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
the sensor picks up and send it

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.680 
the sensor picks up and send it
wirelessly<00:00:49.910> inside<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.030> house<00:00:51.210> to<00:00:51.510> our

you<00:01:02.579> ever<00:01:02.670> wanted<00:01:02.969> to<00:01:03.059> know<00:01:03.149> now<00:01:03.930> our<00:01:04.049> first

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
you ever wanted to know now our first

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.940 
you ever wanted to know now our first
step<00:01:04.470> is<00:01:04.949> to<00:01:05.790> put<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.000> anemometer<00:01:06.540> or<00:01:06.990> wind

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
step is to put the anemometer or wind

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.350 
step is to put the anemometer or wind
gage<00:01:08.189> in<00:01:08.460> place<00:01:10.820> now<00:01:11.820> it's<00:01:11.939> real<00:01:12.090> easy<00:01:12.119> to

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
gage in place now it's real easy to

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.719 
gage in place now it's real easy to
install<00:01:12.720> this<00:01:13.110> because<00:01:13.470> we<00:01:13.650> get<00:01:14.100> a<00:01:14.130> bolt<00:01:14.430> with

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
install this because we get a bolt with

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.510 
install this because we get a bolt with
the<00:01:14.909> kit<00:01:15.439> it<00:01:16.439> goes<00:01:16.650> right<00:01:16.890> through<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.250> hole

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
the kit it goes right through the hole

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.469 
the kit it goes right through the hole
there<00:01:19.430> but<00:01:20.430> probably<00:01:20.700> will<00:01:20.850> do<00:01:20.970> well<00:01:21.150> to<00:01:21.330> just

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
there but probably will do well to just

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.149 
there but probably will do well to just
screw<00:01:21.840> it<00:01:21.930> on<00:01:22.049> in<00:01:22.259> there<00:01:22.439> we've<00:01:22.710> got<00:01:22.740> a<00:01:22.890> nut

going<00:01:57.119> to<00:01:57.210> use<00:01:57.329> this<00:01:57.479> mounting<00:01:57.930> tube<00:01:58.170> and

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
going to use this mounting tube and

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.399 
going to use this mounting tube and
attach<00:01:58.920> it<00:01:59.399> to<00:01:59.460> this<00:01:59.729> post<00:02:00.030> right<00:02:00.180> here<00:02:00.409> just

like in the real estate game the three
most<00:02:03.180> important<00:02:03.750> things<00:02:03.960> are<00:02:04.170> location

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
most important things are location

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.180 
most important things are location
location<00:02:04.890> location<00:02:05.930> you<00:02:06.930> see<00:02:07.170> the<00:02:07.530> sensor<00:02:07.979> can

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
location location you see the sensor can

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.880 
location location you see the sensor can
send<00:02:08.489> its<00:02:08.670> data<00:02:08.729> line<00:02:09.300> aside<00:02:09.660> so<00:02:10.229> if<00:02:10.530> it's<00:02:10.709> not

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
send its data line aside so if it's not

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.280 
send its data line aside so if it's not
impaired<00:02:11.459> in<00:02:11.640> any<00:02:11.760> way<00:02:11.970> it'll<00:02:12.360> go<00:02:12.510> up<00:02:12.540> to<00:02:12.750> 400

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290

but<00:02:13.709> if<00:02:13.770> you<00:02:13.860> got<00:02:13.980> a<00:02:14.040> tree<00:02:14.430> or<00:02:14.670> a<00:02:14.730> wall<00:02:14.970> in<00:02:15.390> the

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
but if you got a tree or a wall in the

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.540 
but if you got a tree or a wall in the
way<00:02:15.660> then<00:02:16.319> it's<00:02:16.680> going<00:02:16.830> to<00:02:16.890> cut<00:02:17.099> way<00:02:17.310> down<00:02:17.340> on

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
way then it's going to cut way down on

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.270 
way then it's going to cut way down on
the<00:02:17.819> amount<00:02:18.030> of<00:02:18.090> transmission<00:02:19.069> now<00:02:20.069> what

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
the amount of transmission now what

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.860 
the amount of transmission now what
we're<00:02:20.400> going<00:02:20.520> to<00:02:20.550> do<00:02:20.790> is<00:02:21.180> use<00:02:21.510> the<00:02:21.660> hardware

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
we're going to do is use the hardware

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.870 
we're going to do is use the hardware
that<00:02:22.020> they<00:02:22.290> gave<00:02:22.470> us<00:02:22.620> here<00:02:22.890> this<00:02:23.610> little

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
that they gave us here this little

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.510 
that they gave us here this little
saddle<00:02:24.239> piece<00:02:24.480> and<00:02:24.800> some<00:02:25.800> pretty<00:02:26.099> good<00:02:26.310> sized

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
saddle piece and some pretty good sized

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.699 
saddle piece and some pretty good sized
lag<00:02:26.819> screws<00:02:27.300> I've<00:02:27.720> already<00:02:28.020> pre<00:02:28.260> drilled<00:02:28.500> some

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
lag screws I've already pre drilled some

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:30.860 
lag screws I've already pre drilled some
holes<00:02:28.739> here<00:02:29.099> so<00:02:29.489> we'll<00:02:29.640> just<00:02:29.819> run<00:02:30.060> these<00:02:30.239> on<00:02:30.300> in

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
holes here so we'll just run these on in

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:42.920 
holes here so we'll just run these on in
but<00:02:31.260> we<00:02:31.380> don't<00:02:31.410> run<00:02:31.800> them<00:02:31.920> in<00:02:32.040> all<00:02:32.190> the<00:02:32.340> way<00:02:41.930> now

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
but we don't run them in all the way now

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
but we don't run them in all the way now
the<00:02:42.989> reason<00:02:43.290> we<00:02:43.349> didn't<00:02:43.590> tighten<00:02:43.890> the

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
the reason we didn't tighten the

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.530 
the reason we didn't tighten the
hardware<00:02:44.310> down<00:02:44.519> is<00:02:44.760> because<00:02:45.120> it<00:02:45.239> makes<00:02:45.420> it

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
hardware down is because it makes it

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.020 
hardware down is because it makes it
easier<00:02:45.870> to<00:02:46.019> slide<00:02:46.170> this<00:02:46.560> tube<00:02:46.799> in<00:02:47.010> there<00:02:47.220> now

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
easier to slide this tube in there now

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.770 
easier to slide this tube in there now
we<00:02:48.480> can<00:02:48.630> just<00:02:48.810> go<00:02:48.959> on<00:02:49.080> and<00:02:50.180> put<00:02:51.180> that<00:02:51.360> in<00:02:51.480> place

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
we can just go on and put that in place

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.600 
we can just go on and put that in place
and<00:02:52.110> then<00:02:52.380> add<00:02:52.739> another<00:02:52.950> one<00:02:53.310> down<00:02:53.459> at<00:02:53.580> the

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
and then add another one down at the

00:02:53.610 --> 00:03:05.930 
and then add another one down at the
bottom<00:02:54.080> and<00:02:55.080> we<00:02:55.260> got<00:02:55.410> it<00:02:55.530> made<00:02:55.769> now<00:03:04.610> the<00:03:05.610> unit

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
bottom and we got it made now the unit

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.670 
bottom and we got it made now the unit
just<00:03:05.970> slides<00:03:06.390> in<00:03:06.599> place<00:03:06.810> in<00:03:07.019> the<00:03:07.110> tube<00:03:07.290> we<00:03:07.470> just

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
just slides in place in the tube we just

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.890 
just slides in place in the tube we just
mounted<00:03:08.030> remember<00:03:09.030> now<00:03:09.150> this<00:03:09.330> is<00:03:09.510> our<00:03:09.630> solar

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
mounted remember now this is our solar

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.720 
mounted remember now this is our solar
panel<00:03:10.349> and<00:03:10.500> it<00:03:10.620> needs<00:03:10.830> to<00:03:10.920> be<00:03:11.069> facing<00:03:11.310> south

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
panel and it needs to be facing south

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:12.740 
panel and it needs to be facing south
because<00:03:11.940> in<00:03:12.269> the<00:03:12.390> Northern<00:03:12.720> Hemisphere

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
because in the Northern Hemisphere

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.509 
because in the Northern Hemisphere
that's<00:03:13.739> where<00:03:13.950> it's<00:03:14.069> going<00:03:14.190> to<00:03:14.220> get<00:03:14.340> the

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
that's where it's going to get the

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:16.640 
that's where it's going to get the
maximum<00:03:15.000> amount<00:03:15.239> of<00:03:15.330> sunshine<00:03:15.840> which<00:03:16.380> means

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
maximum amount of sunshine which means

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.259 
maximum amount of sunshine which means
it<00:03:16.769> will<00:03:16.860> keep<00:03:17.010> our<00:03:17.220> unit<00:03:17.519> powered<00:03:17.850> up<00:03:18.030> better

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
it will keep our unit powered up better

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:20.750 
it will keep our unit powered up better
and<00:03:18.510> as<00:03:19.079> we<00:03:19.230> turn<00:03:19.470> it<00:03:19.590> around<00:03:19.680> we<00:03:20.100> also<00:03:20.310> want<00:03:20.700> to

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
and as we turn it around we also want to

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.449 
and as we turn it around we also want to
make<00:03:20.910> sure<00:03:21.150> that<00:03:21.750> the<00:03:21.989> horizontal<00:03:22.410> arm<00:03:23.070> of<00:03:23.340> the

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
make sure that the horizontal arm of the

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:25.819 
make sure that the horizontal arm of the
anemometer<00:03:24.209> is<00:03:24.420> facing<00:03:25.109> south<00:03:25.290> because<00:03:25.709> the

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:25.829 
anemometer is facing south because the

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:28.099 
anemometer is facing south because the
unit<00:03:26.130> is<00:03:26.299> calibrated<00:03:27.299> to<00:03:27.420> pick<00:03:27.600> up<00:03:27.750> the<00:03:27.870> wind

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:28.109 
unit is calibrated to pick up the wind

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:31.490 
unit is calibrated to pick up the wind
speed<00:03:28.560> in<00:03:29.370> that<00:03:29.430> direction<00:03:30.109> well<00:03:31.109> now<00:03:31.260> that<00:03:31.410> we

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
speed in that direction well now that we

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:32.539 
speed in that direction well now that we
have<00:03:31.530> our<00:03:31.739> sensor<00:03:32.069> aimed<00:03:32.250> in<00:03:32.430> the<00:03:32.459> right

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 
have our sensor aimed in the right

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:34.370 
have our sensor aimed in the right
direction<00:03:32.850> we<00:03:33.299> want<00:03:33.480> to<00:03:33.569> lock<00:03:33.750> it<00:03:33.930> down<00:03:34.079> with<00:03:34.350> a

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
direction we want to lock it down with a

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.210 
direction we want to lock it down with a
few<00:03:34.620> bows<00:03:35.060> there<00:03:36.060> we<00:03:36.209> go

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
few bows there we go

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.069 
few bows there we go
now<00:03:38.220> this<00:03:38.370> container<00:03:38.790> is<00:03:39.030> our<00:03:39.359> rain<00:03:39.600> collector

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:40.079 
now this container is our rain collector

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:42.050 
now this container is our rain collector
the<00:03:40.200> waterfalls<00:03:40.739> in<00:03:41.010> and<00:03:41.310> then<00:03:41.910> it<00:03:42.030> goes

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
the waterfalls in and then it goes

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:43.849 
the waterfalls in and then it goes
through<00:03:42.450> this<00:03:42.569> little<00:03:42.630> bitty<00:03:43.260> hole<00:03:43.530> down

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:43.859 
through this little bitty hole down

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:46.220 
through this little bitty hole down
there<00:03:44.100> in<00:03:44.250> the<00:03:44.340> bottom<00:03:44.489> and<00:03:44.850> it<00:03:45.660> falls<00:03:45.930> down<00:03:46.049> on

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
there in the bottom and it falls down on

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.620 
there in the bottom and it falls down on
these<00:03:46.530> buckets<00:03:46.980> down<00:03:47.250> here<00:03:47.609> which<00:03:48.030> alternate

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
these buckets down here which alternate

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:49.970 
these buckets down here which alternate

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
back and forth and give us a very

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.860 
back and forth and give us a very
accurate<00:03:50.549> reading<00:03:50.730> now<00:03:51.540> you're<00:03:51.690> probably

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
accurate reading now you're probably

accurate reading now you're probably
wondering<00:03:52.049> what<00:03:52.470> happens<00:03:52.769> if<00:03:52.889> you've<00:03:53.010> got

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
wondering what happens if you've got

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.729 
wondering what happens if you've got
some<00:03:53.370> airborne<00:03:54.180> debris<00:03:54.870> that's<00:03:55.350> floating

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
some airborne debris that's floating

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:56.210 
some airborne debris that's floating
around

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
around

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:57.740 
around
wouldn't<00:03:56.639> it<00:03:56.670> clog<00:03:56.940> up<00:03:57.150> the<00:03:57.299> rain<00:03:57.480> gauge

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
wouldn't it clog up the rain gauge

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.809 
wouldn't it clog up the rain gauge
that's<00:03:58.560> why<00:03:58.829> they<00:03:59.010> have<00:03:59.190> this<00:03:59.340> little<00:03:59.670> bitty

00:03:59.809 --> 00:03:59.819 
that's why they have this little bitty

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:01.879 
that's why they have this little bitty
strainer<00:04:00.209> right<00:04:00.480> here<00:04:00.780> so<00:04:01.350> that<00:04:01.380> we<00:04:01.590> can<00:04:01.739> put

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:01.889 
strainer right here so that we can put

up<00:04:08.880> you<00:04:09.030> know<00:04:09.120> normally<00:04:09.600> you<00:04:09.900> put<00:04:10.139> the<00:04:10.260> console

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
up you know normally you put the console

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:12.440 
up you know normally you put the console
inside<00:04:11.160> the<00:04:11.310> house<00:04:11.489> but<00:04:11.730> the<00:04:11.880> weather<00:04:12.060> is<00:04:12.239> so

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
inside the house but the weather is so

inside the house but the weather is so
pretty<00:04:12.780> today<00:04:13.049> I<00:04:13.380> thought<00:04:13.799> it'd<00:04:13.950> be<00:04:14.069> nice<00:04:14.310> to

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
pretty today I thought it'd be nice to

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.789 
pretty today I thought it'd be nice to
stay<00:04:14.790> out<00:04:14.970> here<00:04:15.079> let's<00:04:16.079> take<00:04:16.229> a<00:04:16.289> look<00:04:16.500> and<00:04:16.650> see

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
stay out here let's take a look and see

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:18.560 
stay out here let's take a look and see
what<00:04:17.010> kind<00:04:17.039> of<00:04:17.340> readings<00:04:17.760> our<00:04:17.970> weather<00:04:18.209> Center

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
what kind of readings our weather Center

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:21.589 
what kind of readings our weather Center
is<00:04:18.690> giving<00:04:18.870> us<00:04:20.120> well<00:04:21.120> I<00:04:21.150> see<00:04:21.389> that<00:04:21.510> our

00:04:21.589 --> 00:04:21.599 
is giving us well I see that our

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:24.080 
is giving us well I see that our
temperature<00:04:22.049> is<00:04:22.080> 74<00:04:22.890> degrees<00:04:22.919> the<00:04:23.580> wind<00:04:23.820> is

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
temperature is 74 degrees the wind is

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:25.520 
temperature is 74 degrees the wind is
moving<00:04:24.599> around<00:04:24.810> out<00:04:25.020> there<00:04:25.229> they're<00:04:25.409> about

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
moving around out there they're about

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.080 
moving around out there they're about
nine<00:04:25.800> miles<00:04:26.130> per<00:04:26.310> hour

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
nine miles per hour

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:28.610 
nine miles per hour
that<00:04:27.330> means<00:04:27.570> the<00:04:27.690> windchill<00:04:28.080> factor<00:04:28.500> would

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
that means the windchill factor would

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:29.870 
that means the windchill factor would
have<00:04:28.770> a<00:04:28.800> little<00:04:29.040> bit<00:04:29.190> of<00:04:29.310> effect<00:04:29.580> on<00:04:29.699> our
