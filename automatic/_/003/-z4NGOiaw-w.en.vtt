and the power mode and it'll be

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:32.740 
and the power mode and it'll be
interesting<00:00:14.730> to<00:00:15.150> see<00:00:15.389> how<00:00:15.540> that<00:00:15.599> drives

Paloma is gonna be an interesting one
for<00:00:35.280> me<00:00:35.430> cause<00:00:35.460> I<00:00:35.730> do<00:00:35.910> drive<00:00:36.180> like<00:00:36.420> a<00:00:36.450> grandma

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
for me cause I do drive like a grandma

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.660 
for me cause I do drive like a grandma
so<00:00:37.320> let's<00:00:37.710> see<00:00:37.890> if<00:00:38.040> I<00:00:38.100> can<00:00:38.250> do<00:00:38.370> it<00:00:38.400> some<00:00:38.640> justice

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:47.800 

no<00:00:43.179> I

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:47.810 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:50.980 

you<00:00:48.380> can<00:00:48.530> head<00:00:48.740> up<00:00:48.770> something<00:00:49.280> like<00:00:49.990> the

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:50.990 
you can head up something like the

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:59.680 
you can head up something like the
engine<00:00:53.320> it's<00:00:54.320> more<00:00:54.530> meaty<00:00:55.340> growls

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:03.680 
silage do they power mode it sounds so

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:09.800 
silage do they power mode it sounds so
noisy<00:01:03.920> back<00:01:04.400> the<00:01:04.580> parser

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.050 

in<00:01:10.409> case<00:01:10.590> you<00:01:10.770> have<00:01:10.920> to<00:01:11.040> miss<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.460> combustion

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
in case you have to miss the combustion

in case you have to miss the combustion
engine<00:01:12.420> as<00:01:12.570> my<00:01:12.720> physics<00:01:13.200> tell<00:01:13.470> her<00:01:14.630> because<00:01:15.630> I

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
engine as my physics tell her because I

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.690 
engine as my physics tell her because I
really<00:01:16.020> say<00:01:16.170> that<00:01:16.200> at<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.560> v60<00:01:17.100> about<00:01:17.460> three

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
really say that at the v60 about three

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.640 
really say that at the v60 about three
three<00:01:18.090> modes<00:01:18.390> to<00:01:18.659> drive<00:01:18.900> in

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:23.650 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.620

isn't it I've just driven the Volvo v60

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.370 
isn't it I've just driven the Volvo v60
hybrid<00:01:31.570> it's<00:01:32.230> a<00:01:32.500> really<00:01:32.920> entertaining<00:01:33.490> drive

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:38.830 
dragon eggs but it's almost like three

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:40.350 
dragon eggs but it's almost like three

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:40.360 
different personalities it's almost

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.400 
different personalities it's almost
three<00:01:40.630> thousand<00:01:41.200> one<00:01:42.480> there<00:01:43.480> but<00:01:43.870> having<00:01:44.290> said

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:44.410 
three thousand one there but having said

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:46.110 
three thousand one there but having said
that<00:01:44.470> though<00:01:44.740> it's<00:01:44.890> seamless<00:01:45.400> the<00:01:45.430> transition

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:46.120 
that though it's seamless the transition

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.300 
that though it's seamless the transition
between<00:01:46.300> one<00:01:46.540> mode<00:01:47.410> and<00:01:47.680> the<00:01:47.800> other<00:01:47.830> which<00:01:48.100> is

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
between one mode and the other which is

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.750 
between one mode and the other which is
really<00:01:48.610> impressive<00:01:48.850> how<00:01:49.210> I<00:01:49.360> managed<00:01:49.900> to<00:01:50.760> make

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:51.760
