to make a shovel etc that's actually
something<00:03:01.520> we<00:03:01.700> could<00:03:01.820> do<00:03:01.910> right<00:03:02.060> now<00:03:02.180> is<00:03:02.210> make

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
something we could do right now is make

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:03.880 
something we could do right now is make
some<00:03:02.600> staring<00:03:02.900> tools<00:03:03.110> like<00:03:03.380> I<00:03:03.470> was<00:03:03.590> talking

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 
some staring tools like I was talking

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:07.060 
some staring tools like I was talking
about<00:03:04.960> myself<00:03:05.960> a<00:03:06.170> little<00:03:06.260> work<00:03:06.530> bench<00:03:06.800> down

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:07.070 
about myself a little work bench down

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:13.870 
about myself a little work bench down
here<00:03:08.050> pop<00:03:09.050> it<00:03:09.230> right<00:03:09.320> there

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:19.330 

enough<00:03:14.630> starting<00:03:15.020> to<00:03:15.110> make<00:03:15.260> three<00:03:18.160> so<00:03:19.160> we'll

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
enough starting to make three so we'll

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.530 
enough starting to make three so we'll
do<00:03:19.430> that

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.199 

stone<00:03:24.260> like<00:03:25.129> because<00:03:25.519> it's<00:03:25.700> a<00:03:25.790> much<00:03:25.939> harder

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
stone like because it's a much harder

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:27.580 
stone like because it's a much harder
material<00:03:26.629> than<00:03:26.750> would<00:03:26.900> obviously<00:03:27.230> it

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
material than would obviously it

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:32.380 
material than would obviously it
degrades<00:03:27.950> fast<00:03:28.250> slower<00:03:28.909> slower<00:03:30.640> it<00:03:31.640> also<00:03:32.120> cuts

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
degrades fast slower slower it also cuts

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:38.059 
degrades fast slower slower it also cuts
through<00:03:32.659> things<00:03:32.840> a<00:03:32.959> lot<00:03:33.109> faster

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:38.069 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:42.699 

right<00:03:38.700> now<00:03:38.879> I'm<00:03:39.090> on<00:03:39.239> a<00:03:39.299> quest<00:03:39.390> for<00:03:40.969> say<00:03:41.969> iron

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:42.709 
right now I'm on a quest for say iron

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:46.569 
right now I'm on a quest for say iron
because<00:03:43.709> iron<00:03:43.950> is<00:03:44.629> it's<00:03:45.629> the<00:03:45.719> next<00:03:45.989> step<00:03:46.139> up

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:46.579 
because iron is it's the next step up

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:53.400 
because iron is it's the next step up
you<00:03:47.579> could<00:03:47.760> say

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.410 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:57.090 

torch<00:03:54.250> down<00:03:54.690> it's<00:03:55.690> important<00:03:56.260> to<00:03:56.410> keep<00:03:56.440> things

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:57.100 
torch down it's important to keep things

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.830 
torch down it's important to keep things
lit<00:03:57.520> while<00:03:57.760> you're<00:03:57.970> mining<00:03:58.300> down<00:03:58.560> because
