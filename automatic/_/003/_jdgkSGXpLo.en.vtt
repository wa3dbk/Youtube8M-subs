00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
sheer lashing that's where you want to

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.150 
sheer lashing that's where you want to
attach<00:00:05.609> too<00:00:06.359> sparse<00:00:06.799> parallel<00:00:07.799> to<00:00:07.950> each<00:00:08.010> other

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
attach too sparse parallel to each other

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.390 
attach too sparse parallel to each other
like<00:00:08.280> this<00:00:08.690> begin<00:00:09.690> this<00:00:09.870> not<00:00:10.559> i'm<00:00:11.160> going<00:00:11.219> to

type 0 pitch you're on your first bar
very<00:00:13.860> simple<00:00:14.340> okay<00:00:15.320> and<00:00:16.400> take<00:00:17.400> your<00:00:18.050> two<00:00:19.050> parts

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
very simple okay and take your two parts

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:20.840 
very simple okay and take your two parts
together<00:00:19.560> and<00:00:19.890> you<00:00:19.980> can<00:00:20.070> start<00:00:20.340> wrapping

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
together and you can start wrapping

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:29.689 
together and you can start wrapping
around<00:00:20.939> here<00:00:21.650> you<00:00:22.650> want<00:00:22.859> to<00:00:22.949> go<00:00:23.039> about<00:00:24.260> 70<00:00:25.260> x<00:00:28.699> 67

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
around here you want to go about 70 x 67

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.490 
around here you want to go about 70 x 67
okay<00:00:30.510> i'm<00:00:31.260> going<00:00:31.470> to<00:00:31.529> want<00:00:31.740> to<00:00:31.880> wrap<00:00:32.880> it<00:00:33.090> twice

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:33.500 
okay i'm going to want to wrap it twice

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.020 
okay i'm going to want to wrap it twice
means<00:00:34.500> coming<00:00:34.739> in<00:00:34.950> between<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.370> two<00:00:35.550> spars

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
means coming in between the two spars

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.360 
means coming in between the two spars
and<00:00:36.540> will<00:00:36.899> over<00:00:37.320> your<00:00:37.469> curves<00:00:38.480> 12<00:00:40.219> now<00:00:41.219> we'll

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
two parallel Spurs clipped what we use

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.700 
two parallel Spurs clipped what we use
is<00:01:10.970> for<00:01:11.210> is<00:01:12.820> any<00:01:13.820> frame<00:01:14.150> okay<00:01:14.900> this<00:01:15.259> right<00:01:15.500> here

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
is for is any frame okay this right here

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.040 
is for is any frame okay this right here
make<00:01:15.920> an<00:01:16.040> amazing<00:01:16.159> frame<00:01:16.700> in<00:01:17.509> put<00:01:17.900> another

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:18.050 
make an amazing frame in put another

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:20.200 
make an amazing frame in put another
spark<00:01:18.440> cross<00:01:18.649> the<00:01:18.770> bottom<00:01:19.130> here<00:01:19.310> first<00:01:19.670> make<00:01:20.060> a

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.210 
spark cross the bottom here first make a

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.460 
spark cross the bottom here first make a
frame<00:01:20.950> also<00:01:22.479> you<00:01:23.479> can<00:01:23.720> use<00:01:23.750> this<00:01:24.080> to<00:01:24.140> make<00:01:24.409> a

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:24.470 
frame also you can use this to make a

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.820 
frame also you can use this to make a
flagpole<00:01:26.110> then<00:01:27.110> you<00:01:27.200> got<00:01:27.320> a<00:01:27.380> couple<00:01:27.500> walking

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:27.830 
flagpole then you got a couple walking

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.120 
flagpole then you got a couple walking
sticks<00:01:28.250> you<00:01:28.840> make<00:01:29.840> your<00:01:29.990> lashes<00:01:30.200> like<00:01:30.830> this

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
sticks you make your lashes like this

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.010 
sticks you make your lashes like this
that<00:01:31.369> make<00:01:31.640> it<00:01:31.759> higher<00:01:31.970> of<00:01:32.420> course<00:01:32.660> if<00:01:32.929> you're

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
that make it higher of course if you're

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:34.870 
that make it higher of course if you're
going<00:01:33.140> to<00:01:33.200> do<00:01:33.320> this<00:01:33.560> probably<00:01:34.550> wouldn't<00:01:34.789> do

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
going to do this probably wouldn't do

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.580 
going to do this probably wouldn't do
the<00:01:35.000> fracking<00:01:35.450> down<00:01:35.630> the<00:01:35.720> center<00:01:38.320> you'd<00:01:39.320> leave

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
the fracking down the center you'd leave

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:41.620 
the fracking down the center you'd leave
it<00:01:39.740> open<00:01:40.130> you<00:01:40.340> make<00:01:40.759> your<00:01:40.940> turns<00:01:41.270> a<00:01:41.479> little

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
it open you make your turns a little

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.180 
it open you make your turns a little
tighter<00:01:41.840> when<00:01:42.080> they<00:01:42.170> did<00:01:42.320> it<00:01:42.440> leave<00:01:42.770> it<00:01:42.860> open

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:43.190 
tighter when they did it leave it open

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:45.340 
tighter when they did it leave it open
and<00:01:43.520> the<00:01:43.850> way<00:01:44.000> to<00:01:44.060> increase<00:01:44.600> pressure<00:01:44.869> on<00:01:45.110> that

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
and the way to increase pressure on that

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.260 
and the way to increase pressure on that
then<00:01:45.590> would<00:01:46.160> be<00:01:46.310> to<00:01:46.340> drive<00:01:46.640> a<00:01:46.670> wedge<00:01:46.970> down

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
then would be to drive a wedge down

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:48.820 
then would be to drive a wedge down
between<00:01:47.450> the<00:01:47.720> two<00:01:47.960> spars<00:01:48.289> and<00:01:48.560> that<00:01:48.679> will

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:48.830 
between the two spars and that will

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.550 
between the two spars and that will
tighten<00:01:49.009> up<00:01:49.220> that<00:01:49.280> shear<00:01:49.700> right<00:01:49.910> okay<00:01:50.560> that's

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
tighten up that shear right okay that's

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.770 
tighten up that shear right okay that's
your<00:01:51.649> shear<00:01:51.950> lashing<00:01:52.460> and<00:01:52.640> it's<00:01:53.270> most<00:01:53.479> common

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
your shear lashing and it's most common

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.820 
your shear lashing and it's most common
uses<00:01:53.990> for<00:01:54.170> an<00:01:54.470> a-frame<00:01:56.110> in<00:01:57.110> your<00:01:57.410> pioneering

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:57.830 
uses for an a-frame in your pioneering

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.910 
uses for an a-frame in your pioneering
projects<00:01:58.340> on<00:01:58.580> it<00:01:58.729> cheer<00:01:59.599> lashing<00:01:59.989> start<00:02:00.830> with

projects on it cheer lashing start with
