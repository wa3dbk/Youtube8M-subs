 We need two tablespoons of oil 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.270
 vegetable let's start 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.340
 combine a spoonful of sugar 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:40.100

 of garlic powder mix everything well until 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:58.460
 that everything is well stirred and with this 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.950
 seasoning mix the chicken adds so much 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.929
 seasoning as you think necessary but 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.840
 reserve approximately one tablespoon of 

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:07.520
 this for the vegetables stir well the 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.890
 chicken so that all the pieces are 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.430
 well seasoned and reserve them for a 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.400
 moment 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.439
 now in a wok or in a large skillet to 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.930
 medium-high temperature I heat one 

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:21.060
 teaspoon of vegetable oil since the 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.939
 oil is hot add the chicken and 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.650
 skip it for three or four minutes not 

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:28.349
 it is necessary for the chicken to cook 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.840
 completely at that time since it 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:32.670
 will finish sewing later the only thing 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.530
 What we want is for the chicken to change a 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.989
 little color but without browning it 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.329
 too much after three or four 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:41.549
 minutes remove the chicken from the pan and 

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:43.980
 reserve it for a moment returns to 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:46.650
 preheating the same pan adds a 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.810
 tablespoon more of vegetable oil and since 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:53.250
 is hot add the onion and the 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:55.920
 carrot sauté for a minute 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:58.770
 and then add the peppers and 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.840
 Peas scramble a bit and season the 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:02.640
 with half a tablespoon of the mixture of 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.880
 spices that we made at the beginning of 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.410
 this video and skip for 3 more minutes or 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.990
 until the vegetables have the 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.970
 texture that you want to me I like that 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:14.160
 my vegetables are a little crispy 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:16.440
 so I never cook them for more than 5 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.690
 minutes but if you prefer the 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:21.030
 softer vegetables cook them for a 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:23.040
 little more time since the vegetables 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.770
 have the texture that you want 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.720
 now add a spoonful of honey and 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:30.000
 a spoonful of lemon juice and 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.950
 return the chicken to the stir fry 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.450
 all right for the chicken to absorb the 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:36.030
 honey and lemon juice 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:38.970
 now taste the seasoning and add more salt 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:41.760
 and pepper if they think it necessary too 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.860
 add the broken chili or the two or three 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.680
 Japanese chillies or two or three chilies 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:48.360
 tree and continue sautéing for two or 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.220
 three more minutes or until the chicken 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.860
 is fully cooked and well 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:55.590
 hot and that's all they are ready 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:57.660
 to serve I served this dish with 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:59.460
 a little white rice and decorate it with 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:02.180
 a bit of chopped scallion 

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:02.180
 a good profit 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.780
