00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
autofocus of growth of course and here's

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:13.429 
autofocus of growth of course and here's
a<00:01:06.000> speaker's<00:01:08.479> the<00:01:09.479> micro<00:01:10.760> USB<00:01:11.760> port<00:01:12.090> and<00:01:12.439> this

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
a speaker's the micro USB port and this

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.590 
a speaker's the micro USB port and this
one<00:01:14.100> is<00:01:14.280> for<00:01:14.520> your<00:01:14.610> headphone<00:01:15.770> there<00:01:16.770> so<00:01:17.700> the

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
one is for your headphone there so the

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.450 
one is for your headphone there so the
one<00:01:18.869> thing<00:01:18.900> that's<00:01:19.530> going<00:01:19.860> for<00:01:20.070> this<00:01:20.220> though

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
one thing that's going for this though

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.230 
one thing that's going for this though
is<00:01:20.490> that<00:01:20.869> it<00:01:22.009> looks<00:01:23.009> so<00:01:23.130> much<00:01:23.369> better<00:01:23.580> than<00:01:23.939> the

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
is that it looks so much better than the

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.130 
is that it looks so much better than the
cherry<00:01:24.540> mobile<00:01:24.750> flare<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:25.610> it's<00:01:26.610> easier<00:01:27.330> to

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
cherry mobile flare and it's easier to

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.749 
cherry mobile flare and it's easier to
hold<00:01:28.369> because<00:01:29.369> of<00:01:29.579> its<00:01:29.880> rounded<00:01:30.390> corners<00:01:30.900> see

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:31.759 
hold because of its rounded corners see

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:36.940 
hold because of its rounded corners see
there<00:01:32.759> it's<00:01:33.030> a<00:01:33.170> concave<00:01:34.170> or<00:01:34.229> something<00:01:35.840> there

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
there it's a concave or something there

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.480 
there it's a concave or something there
so<00:01:37.950> again<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:39.290> difference<00:01:40.290> between<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:41.009> this

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
so again the difference between the this

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.850 
so again the difference between the this
the<00:01:42.119> chair<00:01:42.390> mobile<00:01:42.750> purrs<00:01:42.960> and<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.560> cherry

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
the chair mobile purrs and the cherry

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.429 
the chair mobile purrs and the cherry
mobile<00:01:44.100> flare<00:01:44.759> is<00:01:45.329> that<00:01:45.630> it<00:01:45.930> has<00:01:46.140> a<00:01:46.170> lower

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
mobile flare is that it has a lower

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.800 
mobile flare is that it has a lower
clocks<00:01:46.829> eat<00:01:47.130> this<00:01:47.700> one<00:01:47.970> of<00:01:48.590> 1<00:01:49.590> gigahertz<00:01:49.950> and

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
clocks eat this one of 1 gigahertz and

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.690 
clocks eat this one of 1 gigahertz and
well<00:01:51.810> this<00:01:52.290> looks<00:01:52.500> so<00:01:52.710> much<00:01:52.860> better<00:01:53.070> and<00:01:53.369> it's

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
well this looks so much better and it's

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.980 
well this looks so much better and it's
easier<00:01:54.090> to<00:01:54.960> hold<00:01:55.670> alright<00:01:56.670> so<00:01:57.420> again<00:01:57.450> this<00:01:57.840> is

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
easier to hold alright so again this is

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.680 
easier to hold alright so again this is
