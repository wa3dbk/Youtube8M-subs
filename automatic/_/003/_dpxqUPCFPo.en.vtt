00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:07.910
 to Palazzo Magnani 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:10.849
 preparations for the great are in full swing 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:13.579
 shows piero della francesca the drawing 

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:16.580
 between art and science that will be inaugurated 

00:00:13.579 --> 00:00:19.609
 Saturday 14 March and the central body 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:22.609
 of the exhibition is represented by the 7 

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:25.580
 codes between Latin and vernacular of the 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:28.330
 prospect pingendi that will be exposed 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:31.789
 for the first time simultaneously 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:35.360
 in the perspective room 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:39.260
 pingendi the seven were reunited 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:42.620
 editions of this manuscript for the 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:46.430
 first time after 500 years they are all 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:49.190
 the heart is gathered in Palazzo Magnani 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:52.280
 therefore central to the exhibition is in the 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.329
 copy where the drawings are autographs 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.930
 di piero della francesca e 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:59.420
 of the copy of the panizzi library 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:02.660
 along with other specimens coming 2 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:06.500
 from the Ambrosian library 1 from 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:09.170
 palatina library of parma entirely 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.890
 autograph written by pier della 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.790
 francesca 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:16.400
 in addition , the 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.979
 specimens of the national library de 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:22.759
 france of paris of the bibliothÃ¨que 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:25.390
 national of bordeaux and the specimen 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:25.390
 of the british library 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:34.509
 the importance of these volumes of these 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:38.350
 manuscripts lies in the fact that they are the 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:41.380
 only testimonials along with the 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:43.509
 bug at the level and to the team and e 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.860
 of the entire graphic corpus of piero 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:47.440
 of francesca 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:52.570
 therefore the exhibition allows to see the 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:56.500
 fundamental drawings and hand of piero 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:02:01.420
 these drawings for his works ad 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:03.460
 fresco or his paintings in the days 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.830
 past she arrived at Palazzo Magnani 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:08.830
 an important work by piero della 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:12.730
 francesca the magnificent detached fresco 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:15.880
 of the saint ludovico from tolosa has traveled 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:18.290
 like all the works of this exhibition with 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.750
 a thousand precautions 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:23.390
 sized boxes are made 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:26.180
 for the work they are the boxes they have 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:28.069
 a fireproof structure inside but 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.840
 above all the work never enters into 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:31.939
 contact with the scores of the case 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.760
 because in fact you don't cover everything 

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:36.470
 dressed in very soft materials that 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.140
 also allow the work of 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.439
 amortize if we want the path that 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.439
 do 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:48.540
 as you see a detached fresco 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:52.390
 detached fresco by itself is enough 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:54.640
 stable however it is inserted in one 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.170
 structure in this case of fiberglass 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.210
 what this means means that 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:01.240
 when traveling, be careful 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:04.560
 also to the jolts that can that can 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.560
 receive on the road 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:12.709
 and a great emotion to be here at 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:16.359
 in front of Piero della Francesca and del 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:20.329
 his saint ludovico who was positioned 

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:22.459
 a few minutes ago in Palazzo Magnani in 

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:25.189
 an exhibition context that already exists 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:26.329
 perceives to be very elegant and 

00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:28.639
 refined 

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:30.620
 in addition to the patronage of the ministry of goods 

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:34.069
 cultural and patronage of the region 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:36.680
 emilia romagna we had for this 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:39.590
 shows piero della francesca the drawing 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:41.060
 between art science and the high patronage of 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:43.609
 President of the Republic 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:47.269
 we dedicate this to all the people of Reggio 

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:49.400
 to all those who have contributed to 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:52.780
 make this great show this 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.780
 extraordinary cultural event
