00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.259
 I'm so stressed out all over 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.259
 Time 

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:15.299
 are you stressed most people 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.880
 Stress in life is almost cool 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:21.359
 I have become in answer to him 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.980
 stressed that everything is loose like her 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.539
 all in a good mood not stress 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.789
 permanent stress most people 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.500
 are somehow stressed but stress is 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.130
 yes, not something with you 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.530
 happens 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.530
 Stress is a reaction to that 

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:37.020
 There are influences and one point is the one 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.670
 wrong priorities that's what 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.680
 People are stressed if they do not do everything 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.120
 live in her fast gate 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:47.130
 that's a life glass and that's it 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.880
 important things in life you are packing 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:49.530
 in there 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.120
 Many people start with these 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.710
 unimportant things and pack the 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.770
 unimportant things in life 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.530
 in the life glass then they have that 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.520
 everything so unimportant in that 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:06.539
 you have to go in here 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:09.299
 yes this is so facebook and facebook 

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:12.330
 not really central in the 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.979
 live or youtube videos look yes that 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.990
 they are very unimportant then come 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.780
 things are so moderately important 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.450
 brecht spend time with the people 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:24.630
 you do not really like it that way 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:26.549
 Moderately important or job it is important 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.619
 is clear but is somehow too moderate 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:33.270
 right and then you ask the top of it 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:35.400
 drive into life glass on your car 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.500
 Bike is so moderately important and then 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.869
 The other things the things come 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.570
 actually important who family 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:45.150
 friends and suddenly you could do more 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.070
 I did not want to get it all 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.850
 pure where family friends I have then 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.130
 but also managed for example 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.140
 Health or belief are so important 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.530
 I do not want to import important things 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.270
 life glass it is already full 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.080
 what to do 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:11.500
 The British put differently 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:13.360
 are let's rewind time prost 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.300
 the right things in your life the 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:20.440
 Right priority take family 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:26.470
 friends important things and feel them 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:29.860
 if your life fits in very well 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:31.690
 max looks full but there still has 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.520
 what else place namely the things the 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:41.950
 not really that important 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:44.890
 we got them in and then we got them 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:50.920
 You see, you look great, but there you go 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:54.360
 something unimportant things and 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.360
 There is really no room for you 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.700
 still a lot of unimportant purely what yes 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:04.320
 also nice is because unimportant is yes 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.320
 not always stupid 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:10.970
 and suddenly you know there fits completely 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:13.400
 I'm not much in my life 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:15.800
 stressed because I love the things 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.810
 have given proper politics do you think 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:25.210
 now it is full or looks great 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:25.210
 but that fits in a lot 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:37.349
 extremely much pasta in you ask yourself 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:38.700
 now perhaps also for what is 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:41.489
 now this chocolate milk 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:43.670
 that's just chocolate milk then 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:48.200
 no matter how full your life may be 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:48.200
 chocolate milk still fits
