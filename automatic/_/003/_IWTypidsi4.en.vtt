Dooku branch I guess you could call it
and<00:01:46.670> I<00:01:47.060> have<00:01:47.270> to<00:01:47.420> say<00:01:47.630> this<00:01:47.900> is<00:01:49.480> extremely

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:50.480 
and I have to say this is extremely

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.530 
and I have to say this is extremely
annoying<00:01:50.840> and<00:01:51.320> extremely<00:01:52.160> long<00:01:52.430> level<00:01:52.880> except

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:53.540 
annoying and extremely long level except

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.720 
annoying and extremely long level except
I<00:01:54.110> don't<00:01:54.680> know<00:01:54.830> about<00:01:54.950> extremely<00:01:55.400> annoying

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:55.730 
I don't know about extremely annoying

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:57.850 
I don't know about extremely annoying
maybe<00:01:56.120> kind<00:01:56.840> of<00:01:56.930> annoying<00:01:57.170> but<00:01:57.560> it<00:01:57.740> is

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
maybe kind of annoying but it is

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.640 
maybe kind of annoying but it is
incredibly<00:01:58.520> long<00:01:58.820> I<00:01:59.060> think<00:01:59.120> it<00:01:59.930> split<00:02:00.410> up<00:02:00.500> into

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:00.650 
incredibly long I think it split up into

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:02.110 
incredibly long I think it split up into
three<00:02:00.920> parts<00:02:00.950> and<00:02:01.340> I<00:02:01.430> think<00:02:01.670> when<00:02:01.820> they're<00:02:01.940> all

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:02.120 
three parts and I think when they're all

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.420 
three parts and I think when they're all
together<00:02:02.240> is<00:02:02.690> like<00:02:02.840> 30<00:02:03.260> minutes<00:02:03.500> or<00:02:03.830> something

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 
together is like 30 minutes or something

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.840 
together is like 30 minutes or something
it<00:02:04.610> was<00:02:04.670> this<00:02:05.090> really<00:02:05.690> long<00:02:05.870> level<00:02:06.580> so<00:02:07.580> the

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 
it was this really long level so the

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.630 
it was this really long level so the
first<00:02:08.149> one<00:02:08.479> is<00:02:08.780> really<00:02:09.290> the<00:02:09.440> first<00:02:09.740> of<00:02:10.010> the

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
first one is really the first of the

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.460 
first one is really the first of the
three<00:02:11.030> things<00:02:11.450> that<00:02:11.600> you<00:02:11.720> need<00:02:11.870> to<00:02:11.900> do<00:02:12.140> is

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
three things that you need to do is

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.560 
three things that you need to do is
really<00:02:12.950> easy<00:02:13.070> you<00:02:13.460> just<00:02:13.580> need<00:02:13.790> to<00:02:14.060> go<00:02:14.390> over

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:14.570 
really easy you just need to go over

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:16.300 
really easy you just need to go over
this<00:02:14.690> bridge<00:02:15.020> which<00:02:15.470> you'll<00:02:15.710> be<00:02:15.860> doing<00:02:16.100> two

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
this bridge which you'll be doing two

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.260 
this bridge which you'll be doing two
other<00:02:16.490> times<00:02:16.880> and<00:02:17.240> kill<00:02:17.900> this<00:02:19.030> small<00:02:20.030> base

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
other times and kill this small base

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.600 
other times and kill this small base
here<00:02:20.540> the<00:02:20.570> small<00:02:21.050> group<00:02:21.740> of<00:02:21.890> barracks<00:02:22.310> and

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
here the small group of barracks and

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.920 
here the small group of barracks and
like<00:02:23.600> three<00:02:23.960> barracks<00:02:24.350> so<00:02:25.510> kill<00:02:26.510> all<00:02:26.660> of<00:02:26.780> those

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
like three barracks so kill all of those

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:28.630 
like three barracks so kill all of those
and<00:02:27.260> don't<00:02:27.470> build<00:02:27.710> anything<00:02:28.040> on<00:02:28.430> the<00:02:28.610> other

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
and don't build anything on the other

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.310 
and don't build anything on the other
side<00:02:29.060> of<00:02:29.150> the<00:02:29.210> bridge<00:02:29.420> because<00:02:29.870> over<00:02:30.200> there

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:30.320 
side of the bridge because over there

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.890 
side of the bridge because over there
it's<00:02:30.620> kind<00:02:31.460> of<00:02:31.700> it's<00:02:32.000> almost<00:02:32.360> pointless

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
it's kind of it's almost pointless

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.630 
it's kind of it's almost pointless
unless<00:02:33.200> you<00:02:33.560> build<00:02:33.770> barracks<00:02:34.250> over<00:02:34.430> there

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
unless you build barracks over there

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.400 
unless you build barracks over there
that<00:02:34.820> would<00:02:34.880> be<00:02:35.000> more<00:02:35.180> useful<00:02:35.330> than<00:02:35.600> cannons

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
that would be more useful than cannons

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.050 
that would be more useful than cannons
or<00:02:36.620> anything<00:02:36.830> else<00:02:37.100> because<00:02:37.550> those<00:02:37.850> would

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
or anything else because those would

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:39.310 
or anything else because those would
just<00:02:38.120> not<00:02:38.570> be<00:02:38.600> good

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:39.320 
just not be good

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.980 
just not be good
so<00:02:39.770> those<00:02:40.760> would<00:02:41.000> those<00:02:41.390> aren't<00:02:41.690> even<00:02:41.780> in

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:41.990 
so those would those aren't even in

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:43.750 
so those would those aren't even in
range<00:02:42.260> and<00:02:42.470> anything<00:02:42.860> to<00:02:42.950> shoot<00:02:43.190> on<00:02:43.370> this<00:02:43.550> side

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
range and anything to shoot on this side

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.630 
range and anything to shoot on this side
so<00:02:44.150> don't<00:02:44.390> waste<00:02:44.750> your<00:02:44.930> stud<00:02:45.230> also<00:02:46.100> collect<00:02:46.489> as

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
so don't waste your stud also collect as

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.310 
so don't waste your stud also collect as
many<00:02:46.760> studs<00:02:47.120> as<00:02:47.270> you<00:02:47.360> can<00:02:47.570> so<00:02:47.840> you<00:02:47.930> can<00:02:47.989> buy<00:02:48.290> a

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.320 
many studs as you can so you can buy a

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.370 
many studs as you can so you can buy a
lot<00:02:48.770> of<00:02:48.830> things<00:02:49.630> little<00:02:50.630> sis<00:02:50.780> many<00:02:51.020> things<00:02:51.230> as

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380 
lot of things little sis many things as

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:54.610 
lot of things little sis many things as
you<00:02:51.410> are<00:02:52.130> allowed<00:02:52.489> to<00:02:52.520> and<00:02:53.000> a<00:02:53.750> kind<00:02:54.050> of<00:02:54.110> a<00:02:54.200> cool

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
you are allowed to and a kind of a cool

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.650 
you are allowed to and a kind of a cool
trick<00:02:54.980> for<00:02:55.010> these<00:02:55.370> barracks<00:02:55.940> if<00:02:56.120> you<00:02:56.270> are<00:02:56.480> in<00:02:56.570> a

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
trick for these barracks if you are in a

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.199 
trick for these barracks if you are in a
speeder<00:02:56.959> and<00:02:57.260> you<00:02:57.350> just<00:02:57.620> park<00:02:58.250> yourself<00:02:58.700> right

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
speeder and you just park yourself right

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:00.970 
speeder and you just park yourself right
in<00:02:59.420> front<00:02:59.750> of<00:02:59.900> the<00:02:59.959> barracks<00:03:00.320> opening<00:03:00.739> you

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
in front of the barracks opening you

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.410 
in front of the barracks opening you
will<00:03:01.130> kill<00:03:01.400> all<00:03:01.580> the<00:03:01.700> droids<00:03:01.880> as<00:03:02.090> they<00:03:02.209> come

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
will kill all the droids as they come

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:03.970 
will kill all the droids as they come
out<00:03:02.450> so<00:03:02.600> you<00:03:02.840> can<00:03:03.080> shoot<00:03:03.410> it<00:03:03.590> pretty<00:03:03.860> much

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
out so you can shoot it pretty much

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.400 
out so you can shoot it pretty much
endlessly<00:03:04.430> and<00:03:04.730> of<00:03:05.720> course<00:03:05.930> it's<00:03:06.140> gonna<00:03:06.200> be<00:03:06.380> a

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
endlessly and of course it's gonna be a

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:09.720 
endlessly and of course it's gonna be a
random<00:03:06.620> cutscene<00:03:07.160> of<00:03:07.959> one<00:03:08.959> Jordan<00:03:09.440> a

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
random cutscene of one Jordan a

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.880 
random cutscene of one Jordan a
apparently<00:03:10.730> smarter<00:03:11.180> droid<00:03:11.510> 2<00:03:12.110> like<00:03:12.260> ah<00:03:12.470> what

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
apparently smarter droid 2 like ah what

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:14.560 
apparently smarter droid 2 like ah what
the<00:03:12.920> heck<00:03:13.280> okay<00:03:13.640> fine<00:03:13.850> instead<00:03:14.209> another<00:03:14.330> new

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:14.570 
the heck okay fine instead another new

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:18.190 
the heck okay fine instead another new
troops<00:03:14.870> and<00:03:15.430> just<00:03:16.450> getting<00:03:17.450> speeders<00:03:17.870> to<00:03:18.050> walk

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
troops and just getting speeders to walk

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.990 
troops and just getting speeders to walk
over<00:03:18.500> there<00:03:18.620> or<00:03:18.950> move<00:03:19.310> over<00:03:19.580> there<00:03:19.730> quicker

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
over there or move over there quicker

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.420 
over there or move over there quicker
and<00:03:20.360> this<00:03:20.720> part<00:03:21.050> is<00:03:21.290> pretty<00:03:21.590> much<00:03:21.980> the<00:03:22.100> same<00:03:22.250> as

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
and this part is pretty much the same as

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.009 
and this part is pretty much the same as
the<00:03:22.550> last<00:03:22.670> one<00:03:22.880> it's<00:03:23.150> gonna<00:03:23.239> have<00:03:23.510> it<00:03:23.720> take

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:24.019 
the last one it's gonna have it take

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:25.410 
the last one it's gonna have it take

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
some force field and some silver

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.150 
some force field and some silver
structures<00:03:26.420> which<00:03:26.750> you'll<00:03:27.380> need<00:03:27.590> to<00:03:27.769> either

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160 
structures which you'll need to either

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.520 
structures which you'll need to either
use<00:03:28.760> their<00:03:29.030> cannons<00:03:29.600> or<00:03:29.750> build<00:03:29.959> your<00:03:30.019> own<00:03:30.140> to

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
use their cannons or build your own to

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
use their cannons or build your own to
destroy<00:03:31.690> so<00:03:32.690> just<00:03:33.019> the<00:03:34.209> yea-ah<00:03:35.860> just<00:03:36.860> skip<00:03:37.130> to

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:37.550 
destroy so just the yea-ah just skip to

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:40.240 
destroy so just the yea-ah just skip to
the<00:03:37.580> other<00:03:37.820> side<00:03:38.180> and<00:03:38.630> for<00:03:39.350> for<00:03:39.920> some<00:03:40.070> of<00:03:40.190> these

the other side and for for some of these

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.160 
the other side and for for some of these
vehicles<00:03:41.180> that<00:03:41.300> you're<00:03:41.480> in<00:03:41.570> you<00:03:41.720> can<00:03:41.900> if<00:03:42.050> you

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
doing on the top is kind of what I was

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:04.880 
doing on the top is kind of what I was
talking<00:04:03.780> about<00:04:03.840> before<00:04:04.080> just<00:04:04.560> sitting

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
talking about before just sitting

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:08.330 
talking about before just sitting
speeder<00:04:05.250> and<00:04:06.380> this<00:04:07.380> Canon<00:04:07.860> was<00:04:07.980> just<00:04:08.160> shooting

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
speeder and this Canon was just shooting

speeder and this Canon was just shooting
that<00:04:08.610> crap<00:04:09.060> out<00:04:09.300> of<00:04:09.330> me<00:04:09.570> so<00:04:09.870> I<00:04:10.370> don't<00:04:11.370> oh<00:04:11.670> yeah

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:13.770 
your mind just killed it barracks but

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:15.890 
your mind just killed it barracks but
when<00:04:14.760> you're<00:04:14.910> doing<00:04:15.300> this<00:04:15.390> kind<00:04:15.570> of<00:04:15.690> thing

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
when you're doing this kind of thing

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.300 
when you're doing this kind of thing
kill<00:04:16.200> the<00:04:16.320> things<00:04:16.530> I<00:04:16.709> don't<00:04:16.860> have<00:04:16.950> shields

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
kill the things I don't have shields

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.250 
kill the things I don't have shields
first<00:04:17.549> though<00:04:17.850> if<00:04:18.090> possible<00:04:18.720> if<00:04:18.870> they<00:04:19.049> don't

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
first though if possible if they don't

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:20.630 
first though if possible if they don't
have<00:04:19.380> shields<00:04:19.680> and<00:04:19.769> have<00:04:19.860> a<00:04:19.920> silver<00:04:20.250> thing<00:04:20.489> and

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:20.640 
have shields and have a silver thing and

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:22.220 
have shields and have a silver thing and
then<00:04:20.730> go<00:04:20.880> for<00:04:21.090> the<00:04:21.120> shields<00:04:21.780> I<00:04:21.870> don't<00:04:22.080> have<00:04:22.170> a

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:22.230 
then go for the shields I don't have a

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:24.500 
then go for the shields I don't have a
simple<00:04:22.590> thing<00:04:22.680> but<00:04:22.740> kill<00:04:23.670> whatever's<00:04:24.090> easiest

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510 
simple thing but kill whatever's easiest

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:26.690 
simple thing but kill whatever's easiest
pretty<00:04:25.050> much<00:04:25.230> and<00:04:25.530> make<00:04:25.950> the<00:04:26.070> base<00:04:26.250> and<00:04:26.580> then

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:26.700 
pretty much and make the base and then

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.030 
pretty much and make the base and then
call<00:04:27.540> down<00:04:27.750> a<00:04:27.780> lot<00:04:28.110> of<00:04:28.200> barracks<00:04:28.530> and<00:04:28.650> cannons

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.040 
call down a lot of barracks and cannons

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.800 
call down a lot of barracks and cannons
especially<00:04:29.610> in<00:04:29.730> the<00:04:29.820> next<00:04:30.090> one<00:04:30.270> which<00:04:30.480> is<00:04:30.630> its

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
especially in the next one which is its

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:34.960 
especially in the next one which is its
own<00:04:30.990> video<00:04:31.290> because<00:04:31.770> it<00:04:31.860> looks<00:04:32.340> so<00:04:32.520> dang<00:04:33.390> long

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:34.970 
own video because it looks so dang long

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:37.460 
own video because it looks so dang long
but<00:04:35.970> that's<00:04:36.540> pretty<00:04:36.660> much<00:04:36.780> it<00:04:37.020> for<00:04:37.140> this<00:04:37.260> one

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470 
but that's pretty much it for this one

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:39.470 
but that's pretty much it for this one
just<00:04:37.710> go<00:04:38.160> around<00:04:38.430> the<00:04:38.730> take<00:04:39.030> over<00:04:39.240> the<00:04:39.360> other

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:39.480 
just go around the take over the other

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:41.720 
just go around the take over the other
bases<00:04:39.900> and<00:04:40.230> that'll<00:04:40.500> be<00:04:40.620> it<00:04:40.710> for<00:04:40.740> this<00:04:40.950> third

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:41.730 
bases and that'll be it for this third

00:04:41.730 --> 00:07:10.560 
bases and that'll be it for this third
of<00:04:42.030> this<00:04:42.180> level

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:10.570 

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:19.290 

Oh<00:07:12.750> drop<00:07:13.750> on<00:07:15.480> bail<00:07:16.510> hey<00:07:16.990> stop
