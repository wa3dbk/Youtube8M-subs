carrying and part of what I typically

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.439 
carrying and part of what I typically
carry<00:00:15.859> here<00:00:16.859> in<00:00:16.980> south<00:00:17.190> Mississippi<00:00:17.940> is<00:00:18.090> some

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
carry here in south Mississippi is some

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.900 
carry here in south Mississippi is some
large<00:00:18.930> blade<00:00:19.470> machete<00:00:20.400> type<00:00:20.760> blade<00:00:22.640> it's<00:00:23.640> just

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
large blade machete type blade it's just

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.089 
large blade machete type blade it's just
really<00:00:24.119> thick<00:00:24.449> down<00:00:24.660> here<00:00:24.930> so<00:00:25.230> an<00:00:25.500> axe<00:00:25.740> is

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
really thick down here so an axe is

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.519 
really thick down here so an axe is
great<00:00:26.970> but<00:00:27.269> quite<00:00:27.599> honestly<00:00:27.990> unless<00:00:28.289> I'm

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
great but quite honestly unless I'm

going to build a log cabin I can

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.389 
going to build a log cabin I can
probably<00:00:30.119> get<00:00:30.420> along<00:00:30.689> better<00:00:31.160> in<00:00:32.160> my

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
probably get along better in my

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:33.979 
probably get along better in my
environment<00:00:32.730> here<00:00:33.149> with<00:00:33.329> a<00:00:33.360> machete

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
environment here with a machete

about that

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:03.349 
about that
very<00:00:56.460> thick<00:00:56.760> spine<00:01:00.649> it<00:01:01.649> is<00:01:02.010> I<00:01:02.399> got<00:01:03.000> it<00:01:03.149> in<00:01:03.300> a

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
very thick spine it is I got it in a

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.820 
very thick spine it is I got it in a
trade<00:01:03.660> and<00:01:03.960> when<00:01:04.229> I<00:01:04.260> got<00:01:04.530> it<00:01:05.360> it<00:01:06.409> it<00:01:07.409> would<00:01:07.530> it's

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
trade and when I got it it it would it's

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.310 
trade and when I got it it it would it's
razor-sharp<00:01:08.280> I<00:01:08.729> mean<00:01:08.880> I<00:01:09.000> honed<00:01:09.689> it<00:01:09.869> for<00:01:10.049> a<00:01:10.080> few

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
razor-sharp I mean I honed it for a few

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.870 
razor-sharp I mean I honed it for a few
minutes<00:01:10.470> and<00:01:10.799> that<00:01:10.950> could<00:01:11.100> shave<00:01:11.280> my<00:01:11.549> arm<00:01:11.700> with

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
minutes and that could shave my arm with

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.090 
minutes and that could shave my arm with
pretty<00:01:12.180> much<00:01:12.360> every<00:01:12.659> part<00:01:12.869> of<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.020> blade<00:01:13.200> now

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
pretty much every part of the blade now

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.230 
pretty much every part of the blade now
the<00:01:14.640> previous<00:01:14.970> owner<00:01:15.270> had<00:01:15.840> nicked<00:01:17.000> the<00:01:18.000> blade

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
the previous owner had nicked the blade

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.460 
the previous owner had nicked the blade
right<00:01:18.509> here<00:01:19.310> and<00:01:20.689> probably<00:01:21.689> wasn't<00:01:22.020> happy

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
right here and probably wasn't happy

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:23.899 
right here and probably wasn't happy
when<00:01:22.619> he<00:01:22.740> did<00:01:22.920> that<00:01:22.950> he<00:01:23.070> probably<00:01:23.369> thought<00:01:23.670> oh

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
when he did that he probably thought oh

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.060 
when he did that he probably thought oh
that's<00:01:24.180> terrible<00:01:24.390> and<00:01:24.750> and<00:01:25.500> I<00:01:25.619> understand<00:01:26.009> I

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
that's terrible and and I understand I

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.520 
that's terrible and and I understand I
feel<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.310> same<00:01:26.460> way<00:01:26.640> when<00:01:26.820> I<00:01:26.850> do<00:01:27.439> things<00:01:28.439> like

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
feel the same way when I do things like

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.289 
feel the same way when I do things like
that<00:01:28.650> with<00:01:28.920> my<00:01:29.100> blades<00:01:29.369> but<00:01:29.670> you<00:01:29.790> know<00:01:29.909> this<00:01:30.090> is

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
that with my blades but you know this is

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.069 
that with my blades but you know this is
such<00:01:30.509> a<00:01:30.689> hard<00:01:31.640> fan<00:01:32.640> edge<00:01:33.030> I'm<00:01:33.390> not<00:01:33.630> surprised

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
such a hard fan edge I'm not surprised

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.490 
such a hard fan edge I'm not surprised
that<00:01:34.200> happened<00:01:34.680> and<00:01:34.950> I<00:01:36.439> wouldn't<00:01:37.439> change

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
that happened and I wouldn't change

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.260 
that happened and I wouldn't change
anything<00:01:37.860> about<00:01:38.220> this<00:01:38.549> knife<00:01:38.790> whatever

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
anything about this knife whatever

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.810 
anything about this knife whatever
characteristics<00:01:40.229> that<00:01:40.470> caused<00:01:41.250> it<00:01:41.520> to<00:01:41.670> get

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
characteristics that caused it to get

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.469 
characteristics that caused it to get
that<00:01:42.000> little<00:01:43.340> kind<00:01:44.340> of<00:01:44.430> ding<00:01:44.700> on<00:01:44.939> on<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.329> edge

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
that little kind of ding on on the edge

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.740 
that little kind of ding on on the edge
there<00:01:46.220> certainly<00:01:47.220> are<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.700> same<00:01:48.119> parts<00:01:48.450> of<00:01:48.630> it

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
there certainly are the same parts of it

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.310 
there certainly are the same parts of it
they<00:01:48.899> give<00:01:48.930> it<00:01:49.170> this<00:01:50.450> razor-sharp<00:01:51.450> edge<00:01:51.960> and

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
they give it this razor-sharp edge and

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.550 
they give it this razor-sharp edge and
