had<00:02:11.760> originally<00:02:12.300> intended

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
had originally intended

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.840 
had originally intended
so<00:02:13.300> it<00:02:13.420> really<00:02:13.660> wasn't<00:02:14.530> that<00:02:14.800> great<00:02:15.430> and<00:02:15.730> it

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
so it really wasn't that great and it

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.200 
so it really wasn't that great and it
was<00:02:15.970> canceled<00:02:16.600> after<00:02:16.840> only<00:02:17.200> eight<00:02:17.650> issues

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
was canceled after only eight issues

was canceled after only eight issues
this<00:02:19.210> run<00:02:19.480> would<00:02:19.660> finish<00:02:19.960> with<00:02:20.080> Darkseid's

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
this run would finish with Darkseid's

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.410 
this run would finish with Darkseid's
death<00:02:21.100> however<00:02:21.370> this<00:02:21.730> would<00:02:21.910> lay<00:02:22.120> to<00:02:22.180> be

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
death however this would lay to be

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.870 
death however this would lay to be
reckoned<00:02:22.960> in<00:02:23.200> a<00:02:23.320> Justice<00:02:23.800> League<00:02:24.040> storyline

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
reckoned in a Justice League storyline

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.250 
reckoned in a Justice League storyline
in<00:02:25.800> 1984<00:02:26.800> DC<00:02:27.400> wanted<00:02:27.850> to<00:02:28.150> kill<00:02:28.480> off<00:02:28.720> the<00:02:29.110> New

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.610 
Gods
so<00:02:30.310> they<00:02:30.430> started<00:02:30.880> reprinting<00:02:31.810> the<00:02:32.110> original

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
so they started reprinting the original

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.920 
so they started reprinting the original
New<00:02:32.800> Gods<00:02:32.980> story<00:02:33.400> and<00:02:33.700> Jack<00:02:34.240> Kirby<00:02:34.480> had<00:02:34.810> to

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
New Gods story and Jack Kirby had to

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:36.990 
New Gods story and Jack Kirby had to
write<00:02:35.140> something<00:02:35.710> called<00:02:35.980> even<00:02:36.340> new<00:02:36.670> gods

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
write something called even new gods

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.400 
write something called even new gods
must<00:02:37.480> die

must die

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.260 
must die
and<00:02:38.500> this<00:02:39.010> really<00:02:39.490> is<00:02:39.670> kind<00:02:39.940> of<00:02:40.030> irrelevant

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270 
and this really is kind of irrelevant

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:42.990 
and this really is kind of irrelevant
because<00:02:41.020> it<00:02:41.170> was<00:02:41.290> quickly<00:02:41.530> reckoned<00:02:42.160> as<00:02:42.430> well

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
because it was quickly reckoned as well

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.740

some people I know really didn't enjoy

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.130 
some people I know really didn't enjoy
it<00:03:48.670> so<00:03:48.790> it<00:03:48.880> is<00:03:49.000> a<00:03:49.030> bit<00:03:49.209> of<00:03:49.330> a<00:03:49.420> hit<00:03:49.930> or<00:03:50.110> miss

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:50.140 
it so it is a bit of a hit or miss

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:52.560 
it so it is a bit of a hit or miss
series<00:03:50.950> but<00:03:51.459> like<00:03:51.730> I<00:03:51.760> said<00:03:52.030> it<00:03:52.209> is<00:03:52.330> written
