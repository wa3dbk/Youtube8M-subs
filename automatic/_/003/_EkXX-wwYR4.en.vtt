00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:19.789
 probably thursday 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:22.560
 if one of you 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.560
 we know all 

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:29.349
 asina fishing 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:32.349
 and worse enemy 

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:36.830
 especially when we are at the table for nothing 

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:38.490
 outside caracas 

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:41.490
 together we will lower the protective tide 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.190
 you buy the selections of the fmf type of fabrics that is called 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.270
 then they will continue low you should have a group well go 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:55.160
 a manga 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.160
 this seems difficult 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.650
 what we do is 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.650
 trim 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:07.960
 abuse because 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.830
 maybe because 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.830
 if we cut 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.200
 that's the right thing to do 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:26.090
 those of wenger with greater vigilance marcelo martins and tomás pascual well 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:27.200
 Elaborated 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.580
 and then this type of eta this edeeste rest the rest of the television 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:32.320
 is going to put 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.320
 in front 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.270
 citing part that we all pay 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.020
 and I the other part 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.520
 and all of it 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.280
 with fishing line 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.690
 to make them more 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.710
 resistant and endure more the graves martínez 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.120
 we have is that there are other types of plastic materials 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.280
 from the box office is 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.310
 vicentillo or greater and plastic 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.210
 with which we can also do nation 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:10.709
 we mark students inc 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.039
 manzur we mark 

00:02:13.039 --> 00:02:15.449
 we report it 

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:16.739
 and we do is 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:20.359
 here we see that it can be the youngest most ductile plus malleable sea 

00:02:21.249 --> 00:02:22.839
 easier to handle 

00:02:22.839 --> 00:02:24.809
 and we do the same 

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:27.809
 we supported and we did 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:32.319
 the lic 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:34.899
 the ideal material 

00:02:34.899 --> 00:02:38.249
 cc these bags for me the ideal material is these bags 

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:46.159
 18 thousand 

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:55.779
 then it can be seen through perfectly though sectors 

00:02:57.439 --> 00:03:00.529
 this contribution that also quite well 

00:03:00.529 --> 00:03:03.529
 the idea is that as 1 c keeps 

00:03:05.789 --> 00:03:08.689
 this always band promoting 

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:11.419
 and it's how you're going to protect 

00:03:11.419 --> 00:03:14.419
 one of the sun 

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:18.859
 since we have reported all this is explained because 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:21.599
 CD 

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:24.029
 people lasa 

00:03:24.029 --> 00:03:27.439
 of the figures 

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:29.299
 I think everyone 

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:31.339
 fritz 

00:03:31.339 --> 00:03:33.209
 to be able to have them 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:36.209
 the hat 

00:03:38.929 --> 00:03:41.309
 the first day this sector and masters 

00:03:41.309 --> 00:03:44.309
 let's put it into practice so you can see how it works 

00:03:47.779 --> 00:03:49.789
 we go 

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:52.789
 to sunny places 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:02.209
 let's see how this works 

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:06.159
 the porteños hat 

00:04:09.279 --> 00:04:12.279
 until he started to celebrate 

00:04:13.399 --> 00:04:16.399
 but we have the screen 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.349
 we show with this one 

00:04:27.349 --> 00:04:30.300
 we are as we are 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.610
 we hope that the same 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:35.550
 despite the softer 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:38.559
 this tool perfectly what we treat 

00:04:38.559 --> 00:04:41.559
 I do not say it to convert 

00:04:42.279 --> 00:04:44.999
 if desired 

00:04:44.999 --> 00:04:46.520
 we can do this 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.520
 cigna plus the square in the network 

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:52.800
 leave your wake 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.800
 soon 35 centimeters 

00:04:56.379 --> 00:04:58.389
 few 20 

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:01.389
 what we can not stop this way 

00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:08.849
 in the country of the world that has a lot of history 

00:05:12.559 --> 00:05:14.749
 we want it 

00:05:14.749 --> 00:05:16.809
 we can use it 

00:05:16.809 --> 00:05:19.809
 directly in the face 

00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:29.409
 it is perfectly 

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:32.839
 if we cover ourselves with the sun 

00:05:32.839 --> 00:05:35.770
 at 20 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:38.770
 so make practical simple 

00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:44.789
 and I hope we have results pts pj also back 

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:49.900
 we propose changing 

00:06:02.779 --> 00:06:04.259
 good luck 

00:06:04.259 --> 00:06:04.829
 good fishing
