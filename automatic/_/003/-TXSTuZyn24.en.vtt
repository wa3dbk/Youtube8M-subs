00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:51.060
 seat altea with its a point 6 engine 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.950
 there that is just 100 hp and well 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.890
 such a big car ca n't do too much there 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.600
 expected but here on the flat 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.880
 he still leads the way in dutch roads 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.550
 fine 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.290
 I was also in power did ask myself 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:05.460
 wonder how this is when you are seen with hiding 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.380
 have grabbed and collapsed 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.270
 the salvage goes abroad perhaps 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.370
 do you come a bit too short but well it 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.690
 is vacation entity 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.030
 so let it come over you 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:18.090
 I would say yes what does your babysitter stand in 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.380
 this car drives well has 153,000 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.990
 kilometer on the counter 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.800
 and I have to say he is well used 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:26.280
 by 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:28.710
 in the interior yes is everywhere 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.120
 the scratches and bitches in it 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:32.250
 exterior still looks very neat 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.680
 mind you, he is just normal 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:37.500
 used as a family car that street u 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.880
 well off but good at the sheep company 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.800
 they really have everything under control 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.630
 taken to a new timing belt 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.300
 I have to say I like the piece 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:47.480
 really neat and tidy 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:49.220
 so yes technical 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.410
 nothing is missing for years and they have it 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.000
 6 engine is also known as ours 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.100
 immortal 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.680
 yes and this generation of the volkswagen 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:02.390
 group that is just a very good one 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:08.150
 so he offers years of driving pleasure and 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:09.590
 what the garage owner already indicated 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.720
 yes it is of course a car that whole 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.550
 affordable is not too expensive 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:16.130
 a lot of money in road tax and consumption 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:18.770
 neither so it really is a car 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:21.170
 what you can do with 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:22.670
 yes the seat altea in itself yes I have to 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:25.010
 I say the model is very timeless 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.630
 will be over the years he is you 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:29.120
 not really outdated, yes, he sees 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:30.680
 out and mpv but don't imagine that already 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.570
 too much of for you can't do the 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.490
 seats dance no longer a third party 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:36.800
 sit your genes 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:38.180
 no removable seat they would 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.920
 all are very limited 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:41.480
 yes it is just a hatchback of the high 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:44.000
 building actually 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.350
 nicest detail and I always like the LPF 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.550
 windshield wipers if you see it that way 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:48.050
 then it seems like you have none 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:49.790
 has wipers but so come 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:53.840
 yes from the window styles 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:55.610
 knock down and yes that saves 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.600
 air resistance in between that saves again 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:58.760
 consumption 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:02.230
 well i think it is effective or it too 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.230
 worked that is just fresh 2 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.950
 yes further is this car in the course of the 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:10.500
 what to sit in for years 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:12.450
 unit on that I think is the bluetooht 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.730
 has to do with your phone i sit 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:16.139
 microphone above the interior mirror 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:17.250
 I hope I had I know how 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:20.310
 it works because my you need that kind 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:21.620
 things really don't ask that I know who 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:24.240
 can only concern me with driving 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.680
 and works fine in this car four 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:29.550
 seasons tie your strip well 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:31.440
 those are nice and quiet also arsk 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:33.300
 no usually if you try the boat or 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.280
 a line of tires drives and gives the floor 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:37.590
 extra noise am not bothered by this 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:40.260
 there a stressful one 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:42.870
 nice and comfortable car 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:44.610
 works great because worked inside 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:47.729
 may seem a bit worn but if 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:50.750
 So it you are driving your car really feel 

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:50.750
 very good to me 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:55.270
 are you just as enthusiastic about this 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.890
 cars I you can enter it 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:58.230
 and how do you do that again send one 

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:00.580
 email to vacation car-net 

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:04.180
 autoweek.nl and after that I would like one 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:05.860
 read a story of 500 words in which you 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:07.240
 explained when you go on vacation 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:08.920
 where you are going and which 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:11.140

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:18.310
 well the one with the most original story 

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:20.470
 who wins this holiday cart and it 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:21.490
 best thing is you are not just the car 

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:23.710
 on top it takes another six months 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:25.300
 warranty on top of them give you one year 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:27.370
 breakdown assistance and they pay and the year 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:30.180
 insurance for you so it's better 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:30.180
 goes as a backup with it
