00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279 
lore 3d tutorial today we're going to be

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:07.030 
lore 3d tutorial today we're going to be
talking<00:00:05.430> about<00:00:05.549> measurement<00:00:06.270> in<00:00:06.390> blender<00:00:06.750> now

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:07.040 
talking about measurement in blender now

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.669 
talking about measurement in blender now
for<00:00:08.040> architectural<00:00:08.610> projects<00:00:09.059> a<00:00:09.620> lot<00:00:10.620> of

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
for architectural projects a lot of

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.060 
for architectural projects a lot of
architects<00:00:11.219> use<00:00:11.400> programs<00:00:11.880> such<00:00:12.179> as<00:00:13.070> archicad

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
architects use programs such as archicad

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.550 
architects use programs such as archicad
autocad<00:00:17.690> sketchup<00:00:18.690> and<00:00:18.840> so<00:00:18.990> on<00:00:19.050> and<00:00:19.170> so<00:00:19.289> forth

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
autocad sketchup and so on and so forth

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.220 
autocad sketchup and so on and so forth
and<00:00:19.800> they<00:00:20.160> say<00:00:20.400> i<00:00:20.670> had<00:00:21.270> questions<00:00:21.689> today<00:00:21.960> from

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
and they say i had questions today from

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.920 
and they say i had questions today from
a<00:00:22.350> person<00:00:22.740> at<00:00:23.460> my<00:00:23.609> work<00:00:23.880> they<00:00:24.480> were<00:00:24.570> telling<00:00:24.779> me

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
a person at my work they were telling me

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.029 
a person at my work they were telling me
i'll<00:00:25.230> look

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
i'll look

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.550 
i'll look
programs<00:00:27.000> like<00:00:27.180> Brenda<00:00:27.510> blender<00:00:27.869> sorry<00:00:28.260> just

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
programs like Brenda blender sorry just

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.109 
programs like Brenda blender sorry just
don't<00:00:28.800> have<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.160> right<00:00:29.310> function<00:00:29.939> for

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
don't have the right function for

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.870 
don't have the right function for
measurement<00:00:30.539> so<00:00:31.019> it's<00:00:31.980> a<00:00:32.160> lot<00:00:32.340> harder<00:00:32.550> to

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
measurement so it's a lot harder to

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.729 
measurement so it's a lot harder to
measure<00:00:33.180> what<00:00:33.660> an<00:00:33.780> actual<00:00:34.079> wall<00:00:34.290> length<00:00:34.559> is

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
measure what an actual wall length is

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.200 
measure what an actual wall length is
because<00:00:35.100> everything's<00:00:35.460> in<00:00:35.550> blender<00:00:35.880> units

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
because everything's in blender units

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.310 
because everything's in blender units
hard<00:00:37.170> to<00:00:37.350> measure<00:00:37.530> an<00:00:37.860> area<00:00:38.160> or<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:39.750> angle<00:00:40.200> of

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
hard to measure an area or the angle of

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.440 
hard to measure an area or the angle of
a<00:00:40.410> corner<00:00:40.770> and<00:00:40.890> so<00:00:41.100> on<00:00:41.160> so<00:00:41.399> forth<00:00:41.820> and<00:00:41.940> they

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
a corner and so on so forth and they

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.709 
a corner and so on so forth and they
they<00:00:42.870> base<00:00:43.110> that<00:00:43.440> on<00:00:43.649> the<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:44.670> excuse<00:00:45.390> why

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
they base that on the the excuse why

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.139 
they base that on the the excuse why
they<00:00:45.899> didn't<00:00:46.200> use<00:00:46.230> blender<00:00:46.800> I<00:00:47.059> thought<00:00:48.059> to

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
they didn't use blender I thought to

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.610 
they didn't use blender I thought to
myself<00:00:48.270> well<00:00:48.600> that's<00:00:48.809> quite<00:00:49.200> a<00:00:49.230> good<00:00:49.350> point

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
myself well that's quite a good point

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:50.959 
myself well that's quite a good point
really<00:00:49.829> if<00:00:49.980> you're<00:00:50.100> using<00:00:50.250> architecture

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
really if you're using architecture

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.479 
really if you're using architecture
you're<00:00:51.870> doing<00:00:52.050> architectural<00:00:52.559> projects<00:00:53.010> you

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
you're doing architectural projects you

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.729 
you're doing architectural projects you
really<00:00:53.760> want<00:00:53.940> a<00:00:54.030> program<00:00:54.449> that<00:00:54.629> does<00:00:54.809> um<00:00:55.110> have

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
really want a program that does um have

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.170 
really want a program that does um have
proper<00:00:56.039> measurements<00:00:56.489> and<00:00:56.579> so<00:00:56.699> and<00:00:56.850> so<00:00:56.879> forth

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
proper measurements and so and so forth

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.990 
proper measurements and so and so forth
because<00:00:57.329> it's<00:00:57.510> a<00:00:57.539> very<00:00:57.719> precise<00:00:58.079> business<00:00:59.000> but

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
because it's a very precise business but

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.180 
because it's a very precise business but
I<00:01:00.239> did<00:01:00.750> find<00:01:01.079> that<00:01:01.199> blender<00:01:01.559> has<00:01:01.649> some<00:01:01.890> really

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
I did find that blender has some really

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.399 
I did find that blender has some really
good<00:01:02.399> functionality<00:01:02.879> for<00:01:03.300> such<00:01:03.930> things<00:01:04.229> and

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
good functionality for such things and

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.050 
good functionality for such things and
I'll<00:01:04.530> show<00:01:04.739> you<00:01:04.799> them<00:01:04.920> now<00:01:04.979> so<00:01:05.339> if<00:01:05.430> we<00:01:05.580> open<00:01:06.000> up

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
I'll show you them now so if we open up

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.760 
I'll show you them now so if we open up
blender<00:01:06.450> and<00:01:06.600> click<00:01:06.720> into<00:01:06.960> our<00:01:07.080> blank<00:01:07.320> space

going<00:01:17.909> to<00:01:17.970> tell<00:01:18.150> blender<00:01:18.570> what<00:01:19.020> type<00:01:19.200> of<00:01:19.229> unit

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
going to tell blender what type of unit

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:20.840 
going to tell blender what type of unit
I<00:01:19.830> want<00:01:20.009> for<00:01:20.220> my<00:01:20.310> measurements

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
I want for my measurements

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.120 
I want for my measurements
Imperial<00:01:21.420> or<00:01:21.540> metric<00:01:21.570> so<00:01:22.170> we're<00:01:22.650> going<00:01:22.799> to<00:01:22.890> the

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
Imperial or metric so we're going to the

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.999 
Imperial or metric so we're going to the
scene<00:01:23.490> over<00:01:24.299> here<00:01:24.450> on<00:01:24.509> our<00:01:24.659> right<00:01:24.810> and<00:01:25.049> I'll

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.499 
scene over here on our right and I'll
enable<00:01:26.310> metric<00:01:27.950> now<00:01:28.950> I<00:01:29.189> noticed<00:01:29.790> if<00:01:29.939> I<00:01:30.030> press<00:01:30.210> 5

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
enable metric now I noticed if I press 5

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.230 
enable metric now I noticed if I press 5
on<00:01:30.780> my<00:01:30.810> numpad<00:01:31.200> one<00:01:31.409> top<00:01:31.680> view<00:01:31.950> it'll<00:01:32.850> tell<00:01:33.060> me

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
on my numpad one top view it'll tell me

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.700 
on my numpad one top view it'll tell me
that<00:01:34.130> the<00:01:35.780> under<00:01:36.780> top<00:01:36.960> also<00:01:37.170> it'll<00:01:37.470> tell<00:01:37.680> me

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
that the under top also it'll tell me

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.280 
that the under top also it'll tell me
that<00:01:37.979> what<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.520> size<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:38.970> smallest<00:01:39.299> blender

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
that what the size the smallest blender

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.620 
that what the size the smallest blender
unit<00:01:40.590> visible<00:01:41.070> is<00:01:41.430> so<00:01:41.850> these<00:01:41.970> some<00:01:42.270> tiny

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
unit visible is so these some tiny

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.929 
unit visible is so these some tiny
little<00:01:42.780> cubes<00:01:43.140> in<00:01:43.320> here<00:01:43.619> a<00:01:43.770> 10<00:01:44.340> centimeters<00:01:44.850> if

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
little cubes in here a 10 centimeters if

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.660 
little cubes in here a 10 centimeters if
we<00:01:45.060> zoom<00:01:45.360> out<00:01:45.509> one<00:01:45.840> small<00:01:46.799> skewer<00:01:47.280> you<00:01:47.430> can<00:01:47.520> see

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
we zoom out one small skewer you can see

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.280 
we zoom out one small skewer you can see
these<00:01:47.909> ones<00:01:48.090> here<00:01:48.420> and<00:01:48.570> there<00:01:48.689> 1<00:01:48.930> meter

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
these ones here and there 1 meter

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.480 
these ones here and there 1 meter
keep<00:01:49.740> zooming<00:01:49.920> out<00:01:51.740> these<00:01:52.740> large<00:01:53.100> blender

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
keep zooming out these large blender

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.209 
keep zooming out these large blender
units<00:01:53.759> here<00:01:53.909> are<00:01:54.060> 10<00:01:54.390> meters<00:01:54.600> so<00:01:55.590> that's<00:01:55.710> that

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
units here are 10 meters so that's that

apart<00:03:32.200> from<00:03:32.440> one<00:03:32.739> so<00:03:33.160> we've<00:03:33.280> got<00:03:33.400> one<00:03:33.550> little

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
apart from one so we've got one little

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.820

a<00:03:35.980> very<00:03:36.190> quick<00:03:36.670> ormer<00:03:37.000> it's<00:03:37.209> a<00:03:37.360> lot<00:03:37.540> like

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
a very quick ormer it's a lot like

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.620 
a very quick ormer it's a lot like
ArchiCAD<00:03:38.320> and<00:03:38.440> those<00:03:38.590> programs<00:03:39.070> I<00:03:39.280> can<00:03:39.700> tell

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:40.630 
ArchiCAD and those programs I can tell

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:42.270 
ArchiCAD and those programs I can tell
it<00:03:40.720> a<00:03:40.780> precise<00:03:41.140> measurement<00:03:41.560> and<00:03:41.860> it'll<00:03:41.980> snap

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
it a precise measurement and it'll snap

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.100 
it a precise measurement and it'll snap
straight<00:03:42.640> to<00:03:42.730> that<00:03:42.850> measurement<00:03:43.150> so<00:03:43.780> first<00:03:43.989> we

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:44.110 
straight to that measurement so first we

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:46.920 
straight to that measurement so first we
have<00:03:44.200> to<00:03:44.380> tell<00:03:44.560> blender<00:03:45.040> to<00:03:46.000> extrude<00:03:46.450> the

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930 
have to tell blender to extrude the

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:49.550 
have to tell blender to extrude the

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 
as the degrees for each corner so if I

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.600 
as the degrees for each corner so if I
grab<00:04:55.349> and<00:04:55.500> move<00:04:55.620> that<00:04:55.770> will<00:04:55.889> also<00:04:56.220> tell<00:04:56.490> me

it looks scary and I'll have to open it

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:16.550 
it looks scary and I'll have to open it
up<00:05:15.419> in<00:05:15.570> ArchiCAD<00:05:15.990> or<00:05:16.080> something<00:05:16.380> like<00:05:16.470> that
