00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.500
 columbia pictures presents this 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:11.420
 video tutorial will tell you what to do if 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:14.429
 screen you get an error failed 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:17.279
 run windows because of corrupted or 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.160
 missing file this applies 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.650
 windows xp operating system 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:25.010
 so consider a few ways 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:27.330
 the first way is 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:27.980
 will try to restore the boot 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.410
 sector 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:33.899
 mean to do it under this video 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:37.280
 there will be a link to a video lesson in which everything 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:42.690
 detailed and clear 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:45.090
 told if the first way you do not 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.250
 helped move to the second method 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.340
 the second way is to 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.670
 restore the operating system with 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:57.239
 using a restore point that is 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:59.850
 make a rollback also under this video will 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:04.830
 link to the second way to solve the problem 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:06.780
 there everything is told in great detail if 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.619
 the second method did not help you 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.960
 most likely you will have 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:15.740
 reinstall the system but you still 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.729
 try more detail 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:21.090
 take a closer look first and 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:23.520
 the second way you can in principle 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:28.409
 start immediately with the second way he 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:30.720
 should help you and so all the same when 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.159
 you will be taken to the desktop when you have 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.500
 everything will be fine you will need 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.890
 find out why you had this 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.180
 system32 error problem 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:42.570
 basically this error may occur 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.240
 if your hard drive is not ok then 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.040
 there needs to be replaced 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.780
 but there are other ways wrong 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.970
 installed game or wrong 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.259
 turned off computer means after 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.540
 get to the desktop 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.810
 you will need to check your hard 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:01.390
 drive using the program specifically 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:03.940
 Also under this video there will be a link like 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.740
 All this done on the link to the video lesson 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:10.300
 how to check your hard drive that is 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:11.430
 test if you find out what 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:15.459
 your hard drive 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:17.110
 bad condition means basically 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:18.730
 useless to reinstall windows 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.040
 because if you do it 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.800
 it lasts a very short mod can 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.080
 be a week can be a little bigger and again 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:29.950
 this system32 error will occur 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:31.900
 or some other mistakes if you 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:35.020
 tough if you find out what your tough 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:37.870
 disk okay mean the problem was in 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:38.670
 another computer is wrong turned off 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:43.840
 or 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:47.610
 installed some kind of left toy here and 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:51.700
 all in general I wanted to say that is 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:54.330
 go and watch video tutorials on yes 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:58.720
 by reference the first way the second way 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:03:01.570
 they should help you if not then 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.100
 will have to reinstall the system from 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:06.250
 be sure to check after this 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:10.150
 hard drive also how to check hard 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:13.230
