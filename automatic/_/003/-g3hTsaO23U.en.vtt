got some the hook and something's had a
bit<00:03:00.090> so<00:03:00.540> I'm<00:03:00.630> basically<00:03:00.900> loud<00:03:01.440> and<00:03:01.680> up<00:03:01.799> lining

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
bit so I'm basically loud and up lining

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.850 
bit so I'm basically loud and up lining
it<00:03:02.760> up<00:03:02.970> according<00:03:03.930> to<00:03:03.959> like<00:03:04.200> what<00:03:04.440> comes<00:03:04.650> first

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
it up according to like what comes first

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.000 
it up according to like what comes first
in<00:03:05.130> order<00:03:05.310> as<00:03:05.640> you<00:03:05.790> can<00:03:05.910> see<00:03:06.500> let's<00:03:07.500> listen<00:03:07.890> to

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
in order as you can see let's listen to

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:23.410 
in order as you can see let's listen to
what<00:03:08.160> this<00:03:08.340> is

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.370 

okay<00:03:24.420> so<00:03:24.480> typically<00:03:25.170> it's<00:03:25.319> the<00:03:25.410> same<00:03:25.650> thing<00:03:25.950> I

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 
okay so typically it's the same thing I

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:32.930 
okay so typically it's the same thing I
can<00:03:28.380> basically<00:03:28.799> get<00:03:29.130> rid<00:03:29.160> of<00:03:29.310> this<00:03:30.709> and<00:03:31.940> the

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
can basically get rid of this and the

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:36.229 
can basically get rid of this and the
first<00:03:33.120> thing<00:03:33.389> I<00:03:33.569> would<00:03:33.630> like<00:03:33.900> to<00:03:34.049> do<00:03:34.910> it<00:03:35.910> start

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
first thing I would like to do it start

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:38.059 
first thing I would like to do it start
color<00:03:36.540> coding<00:03:36.989> things<00:03:37.230> because<00:03:37.709> I<00:03:37.769> know<00:03:37.829> what

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:38.069 
color coding things because I know what

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:41.059 
color coding things because I know what
it<00:03:38.160> is<00:03:38.310> let's<00:03:38.609> listen<00:03:39.000> to<00:03:39.180> this<00:03:39.859> he<00:03:40.859> did<00:03:41.040> a

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:41.069 
it is let's listen to this he did a

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:44.420 
it is let's listen to this he did a
great<00:03:41.280> job<00:03:41.310> of<00:03:42.620> labeling<00:03:43.620> everything<00:03:43.859> so<00:03:44.250> when

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
great job of labeling everything so when

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:47.300 
great job of labeling everything so when
it<00:03:44.579> load<00:03:44.790> up<00:03:45.000> I<00:03:45.319> anybody<00:03:46.319> practically<00:03:47.160> know

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
it load up I anybody practically know

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.129 
it load up I anybody practically know
what's<00:03:47.489> going<00:03:47.730> on<00:03:47.850> here<00:03:48.090> so<00:03:48.569> I<00:03:48.600> noticed<00:03:49.049> to

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:49.139 
what's going on here so I noticed to

00:03:49.139 --> 00:04:00.160 
what's going on here so I noticed to
leave<00:03:49.350> oh<00:03:49.530> cool<00:03:56.510> alright<00:03:57.510> so<00:03:57.840> leave<00:03:58.230> vocal<00:03:59.090> red

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.170 
leave oh cool alright so leave vocal red

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:05.089 
leave oh cool alright so leave vocal red
and<00:04:01.170> all<00:04:02.069> of<00:04:02.340> these<00:04:02.489> are<00:04:02.549> hooks<00:04:03.889> except<00:04:04.889> for

00:04:05.089 --> 00:04:05.099 
and all of these are hooks except for

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:23.750 
and all of these are hooks except for
what<00:04:05.489> is<00:04:05.579> this<00:04:09.440> yes

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.909 

okay<00:04:24.760> so<00:04:24.820> typically<00:04:25.540> I<00:04:25.570> guess<00:04:25.870> this<00:04:26.139> basically

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:26.919 
okay so typically I guess this basically

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:30.530 
okay so typically I guess this basically
like<00:04:27.280> a<00:04:27.840> list<00:04:28.840> sample<00:04:29.260> sound<00:04:29.800> like<00:04:29.949> a

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:30.540 
like a list sample sound like a

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:34.020 
like a list sample sound like a
telephone<00:04:31.540> something<00:04:32.520> any<00:04:33.520> record<00:04:33.850> on<00:04:33.940> a

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.030 
telephone something any record on a

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:35.700 
telephone something any record on a
telephone<00:04:34.300> ever<00:04:34.630> took<00:04:34.840> recording<00:04:35.440> into<00:04:35.620> the

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:35.710 
telephone ever took recording into the

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:39.780 
telephone ever took recording into the
microphone<00:04:36.190> so<00:04:37.740> other<00:04:38.740> than<00:04:39.280> that<00:04:39.460> we're

microphone so other than that we're

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:44.719 
microphone so other than that we're
gonna<00:04:39.910> lay<00:04:40.090> with<00:04:40.240> these<00:04:40.389> hooks<00:04:42.210> purple<00:04:43.260> and
